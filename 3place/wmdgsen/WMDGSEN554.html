<h4 id="chapter-xxxvi-on-the-eve">CHAPTER XXXVI On the Eve</h4>
<p>1774-89</p>
<p>I. RELIGION AND THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>F INANCIALLY the Catholic Church was the soundest institution in</p>
<p>he country. It owned some six per cent of the land, and other
property, valued in sum at from two to four billion livres, with an
annual income of 120,000,000 livres. 1 It received an additional
123,000,000 in tithes levied on the produce and livestock of the soil. 2
These revenues, in the view of the Church, were needed for its various
functions of promoting family life, or- ganizing education (before
1762), forming moral character, supporting social order, distributing
charity, tending the sick, offering to meditative or unpolitical spirits
a monastic refuge from the confusion of the crowd and the tyranny of the
state, and inculcating a judicious mixture of fear, hope, and
resignation in souls condemned, by the natural inequality of men, to
poverty, hardship, or grief.</p>
<p>All this it claimed to do through its clergy, which constituted about
one half of one per cent of the population. Their number had fallen
since 1779, 3 and the monasteries were in serious decline. “Many monks,”
we are told, “were favorable to the new ideas, and read the writings of
the philos - ophers.” 4 Hundreds of monks abandoned the monastic life,
and were not replaced; between 1766 and 1789 their number in France fell
from 26,000 to 17,000; in one monastery from eighty to nineteen, in
another from fifty to four. 5 A royal edict of 1766 closed all
monasteries having fewer than nine inmates, and raised the permitted age
for taking vows from sixteen to twenty- one for men, to eighteen for
women. Monastic morals were lax. The Archbishop of Tours wrote in 1778:
“The Gray Friars [Franciscans! are in a state of degradation in this
province; the bishops complain of their de- baucheries and disorderly
life.” 6 On the oth er hand the nunneries were in good condition. There
were 37,000 nuns in the 1,500 convents of France in 1774; 7 their morals
were good, and they actively fulfilled their tasks of educating girls,
serving in hospitals, and offering asylum to widows, spin- sters, and
women broken in the battle of life.</p>
<p>The secular clergy prospered in the sees and languished in the
parishes. There were many devoted and industrious bishops, some worldly
idling ones. Burke, visiting France in 1773, found a few prelates guilty
of avarice, but the great majority impressed him by their learning and
integrity. 8 An historian familiar with the literature of scandal
concluded: “It may be broadly stated that the vices which had infected
the whole body of the</p>
<p>900</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI )</p>
<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>9 °</p>
<p>clergy during the sixteenth century had disappeared by the
eighteenth. De- spite the law of celibacy the country curates were, as a
rule, moral, austere, virtuous men.” 9 These parish priests complained
of the pride of class in the bishops, who were all nobles; of the
requirement to transmit to the bishop the greater part of the tithes,
and of the consequent poverty that compelled the curates to till the
soil as well as serve the Church. Louis XVI was moved by their protests,
and arranged that their salaries should be raised from five hundred to
seven hundred livres per year. When the Revolution came many of the
lower clergy supported the Third Estate. Some bishops, too, favored
political and economic reform, but most of them remained adamant against
any changes in the Church or the state. 10 When the treasury of France
neared bankruptcy the wealth of the Church offered a tempting contrast,
and bondholders, worried about the ability of the government to pay
interest or principal on their loans, began to see in the expropriation
of church prop- erty the only road to national solvency. The spreading
rejection of the Christian creed concurred with this economic urge.</p>
<p>Religious belief flourished in the villages, waned in the towns; and
in these the women of the middle and lower classes kept their
traditional piety. “My mother,” Mme. Vigee - Lebrun recalled, “was very
pious. I too was pious at heart. We used always to hear High Afass and
attend the services of the Church.” 11 The churches were crowded on
Sundays and holydays. 12 But among the men unbelief had captured half
the leading spirits. In the nobility a gay skepticism had become fas
hionable, even among the women. “The fashionable world for ten years
past,” wrote Mercier in his Tableau de Paris in 1783, “has not attended
Alass”; or, if they did go, it was “so as not to scandalize their
lackeys, who know that it is on their account.” 13 The upper middle
class followed the lead of the aristocracy. In the schools “many
teachers were infected with unbelief after_i77i”; 14 many students
neglected Atass, and read the philosophes. In 1789 Father Bonnefax
declared: “The gravest scandal, and that which will entail the most
fatal consequences, is the almost absolute abandonment of religious
teaching in the public schools.” 15 In one college, it was said, “only
three imbeciles” believed in God. 16</p>
<p>Among the clergy belief varied inversel y with income. The prelates
“ac - cepted the ‘utilitarian morality’ of the philosophes , and kept
Jesus only as a discreet front.” 17 There were hundreds of abbes like
Alably, Condillac, Aforellet, and Raynal, who themselves were
philosophes , or adopted the cur- rent doubts. There were bishops like
Talleyrand, who made little pretense to Christian belief; there were
archbishops like Lomenie de Brienne, of whom Louis XVI complained that
he did not believe in God. 18 Louis re- fused to have a priest teach his
son, lest the boy lose religious faith. 19</p>
<p>The Church continued to demand censorship of the press. In 1770 the
bishops sent to the King a memoir on “the dangerous consequences of lib-
erty of thinking and printing.” 20 The government had relaxed, under
Louis XV, the laws against the entry of Protestants into France;
hundreds of them were now in the kingdom, living under political
disabilities, in marriages un- recognized by the state, and in daily
fear that the old laws of Louis XIV</p>
<p>902</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>would at any moment be enforced. In July, 1775, an assembly of the
Catho- lic clergy petitioned the King to forbid Protestant meetings,
marriages, or education, and to exclude Protestants from all public
office; it also asked that the age of permitted monastic vows be
restored to sixteen. 21 Turgot pleaded with Louis XVI to ignore these
proposals, and to relieve the Protestants of their disabilities; the
hierarchy joined in the campaign to displace him. In 1781 the second
edition of Raynal’s Histoire philosophique des deux Indes was burned by
order of the Parlement of Paris, and the author was banished from
France. Buffon was attacked by the Sorbonne for outlining a natural
evolution of life. In 1785 the clergy demanded life imprisonment for
persons thrice condemned of irreligion. 22</p>
<p>But the Church, weakened by a century of attacks, could no longer
domi- nate public opinion, and it could no longer rely on the “secular
arm” to im - plement its decrees. Louis XVI, after much worry about his
coronation oath to stamp out heresy, yielded to the pressure of liberal
ideas, and issued in 1787 an edict of toleration prepared by Males
herbes: “Our justice does not permit us to exclude any longer, from the
rights of the civil state, those of our subjects who do not profess the
Catholic religion.” 23 The edict still ex - cluded non-Catholics from
public office, but it gave them all other civil rights, admitted them to
the professions, legitimized their marriages past and future, and
allowed them to celebrate their religious services in private homes. We
should add that a Catholic bishop, M. de La Luzerne, vigorously
supported the emancipation of the Protestants, and full freedom of
religious worship. 24</p>
<p>No class in the cities of France was so disliked by the educated male
minority as the Catholic clergy. The Church was hated, said de
Tocqueville, “not because the priests claimed to regulate the affairs of
the other world, but because they were landed proprietors, lords of
manors, tithe owners, and administrators in this world.” 25 A peasant
wrote to Necker in 1788: “The poor suffer from cold and hunger while the
canons [cathedral clergy] feast and think of nothing but fattening
themselves like pigs that are to be killed for Easter.” 26 The middle
classes resented the exemption of church wealth from taxation.</p>
<p>Most previous revolutions had been against the state or the Church,
rarely against both at once. The barbarians had overthrown Rome, but
they had accepted the Roman Catholic Church. The Sophists in ancient
Greece, the Reformers in sixteenth-century Europe, had rejected the
prevailing religion, but they had respected the existing government. The
French Revolution at- tacked both the monarchy and the Church, and
undertook the double task and jeopardy of removing both the religious
and the secular props of the existing social order. Is it any wonder
that for a decade France went mad?</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>LIFE ON THE EDGE</li>
</ol>
<p>The philosophers had recognized that, having rejected the theological
foundations of morality, they were obligated to find another basis,
another</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>903</p>
<p>system of belief that would incline men to decent behavior as
citizens, hus- bands, wives, parents, and children. 27 But they were not
at all confident that the human animal could be controlled without a
supernaturally sanctioned moral code. Voltaire and Rousseau finally
admitted the moral necessity of popular religious belief. Mably,
addressing to John Adams in 1783 some Ob- servations sur le
gouvernement… des Etats unis d’Amerique, warned him that indifference in
matters religious, however harmless it might be in en- lightened and
rational individuals, is fatal to the morals of the masses. A gov-
ernment, he suggested, must control and direct the t hought of these
“chil - dren” just as parents do with the young. 28 Diderot, in the
second half of his life, pondered how to devise a natural ethic, and
admitted his failure:’ “I have not even dared to write the first line;…
I do not feel myself equal to this sublime work.” 29</p>
<p>What sort of morality prevailed in France after forty years of
attacks upon supernatural beliefs? In answering this question we must
not idealize the first half of the eighteenth century. Fontenelle,
shortly before his death in 1757, said he wished he could live sixty
years more “to see what universal infidelity, depravity, and dissolution
of all ties would turn to.” 30 If that state - ment (which was probably
unfair to the middle and lower classes) gave a true picture of
upper-class morals in France before the Encyclopedic (1751), we should
hardly be justified in ascribing to the philosophes the defects of
morality in the second half of the century. Other factors than the
decline of religious belief were weakening the old moral code. The
growth of wealth enabled men to finance sins that had been too costly
before. Restif de La Bretonne showed a good bourgeois lamenting the
deterioration of French character by the passage of population from
villages and farms to cities; 31 young men escaped from the discipline
of the family, the farm, and the neighborhood to the corrosive contacts
and opportunities of city life, and the protective anonymity of city
crowds. In Les Nuits de Paris Restif described the Paris of the 1780s as
a maelstrom of juvenile delinquents, petty thieves, professional
criminals, and prostitutes female and male. Taine sup- posed that the
France of 1756- 88 was diseased with “vagrants, mendicants, every
species of refractory spirit,… foul, filthy, haggard, and savage, en-
gendered by the system; and upon each social ulcer they gathered like
vermin.” 32 This human waste of the social organism was the product of
human nature and Bourbon rule, and can hardly be ascribed to philosophy
or the decay of religious belief.</p>
<p>Possibly some of the gambling that flourished in Paris (as in London)
was connected with unbelief; but everybody joined in it, pious and
impious alike. In 1776 all private lotteries were suppressed to be
merged in the Loterie Royale. Nevertheless, some part of the sexual
chaos in the upper classes could reasonably be attributed to atheism. In
Choderlos de Laclos’ Les Liai - sons danger euses (1782) we find
fictional aristocrats exchanging notes on the art of seduction, laying
plans to have a fifteen-year-old girl deflowered as soon as she left the
convent, and professing a philosophy of moral nihilism. The protagonist,
the Vicomte de Valmont, argues that all men are equally evil in their
desires, but that most men fail to effect them because they allow</p>
<p>904 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>moral traditions to intimidate them. The wise man, Valmont holds,
will pursue whichever sensations promise him most pleasure, and will
disdain all moral inhibitions. 33 Some Greek Sophists, we recall,
reached similar conclu- sions after discarding the gods. 34</p>
<p>This philosophy of amoralism, as all the world now knows, was carried
ad nauseam by the Comte — usually miscalled Marquis — de Sade. Born in
Paris in 1 740, he served twelve years in the army, was arrested and
condemned to death for homosexual offenses (1772), escaped, was
captured, escaped again, was captured again, and was committed to the
Bastille. There he wrote sev- eral novels and plays, as obscene as his
imagination could make them: chiefly Justine (1791) and Histoire de
Juliette , 011 Les Prosperites du vice (1792). Since there is no God, he
argued, the wise man will seek to realize every de- sire so far as he
can without incurring earthly punishment. All desires are equally good;
all moral distinctions are delusions; abnormal sexual relations are
legitimate, and are not really abnormal; crime is delightful if you
avoid detection; and there are few things more delicious than beating a
pretty girl. Readers were shocked less by de Sade’s amoralism than by
his suggestion that the total destruction of the human race would
afflict the cosmos so little that “it would no more interrupt its course
than if the entire species of rab - bits or hares were extinguished.” 35
In 1789 de Sade was removed to a lunatic asylum at Charenton; he was
released in 1790, was recommitted as incurable in 1803, and died in
1814.</p>
<p>The philosophers might plead that this amoralism was a sickly non
sequitur from their criticism of the Christian theology, and that a sane
mind would recognize moral obligations with or without religious belief.
Many people did. And among the normal population of France — even of
Paris — there were in these years many elements of moral regeneration:
the rise of sentiment and tenderness; the triumphs of romantic love over
marriages of convenience; the young mother proudly nursing her child;
the husband courting his own wife; the family restored to unity as the
soundest source of social order. These developments were often allied
with some remnants of the Christian creed, or with the semi-Christian
philosophy of Rousseau; but the atheist Diderot gave them enthusiastic
support.</p>
<p>The death of Louis XV was followed by a reaction against his
sensuality. Louis XVI gave good example by his simple dress and life,
his fidelity to his wife, and his condemnation of gambling. The Queen
herself joined in the fashion of simplicity, and led the revival of
sensibility and sentiment. The French Academy annually awarded a prize
for outstanding virtue. 36 Most literature was decent; the novels of
Crebillon fils were put aside, and Ber- nardin de Saint- Pierre’s Paul
et Virginie set the tone of moral purity in love. Art reflected the new
morality; Greuze and Mme. Vigee-Lebrun celebrated children and
motherhood.</p>
<p>Christianity and philosophy together nourished a humanitarianism that
spread a thousand works of philanthropy and charity. During the hard
win- ter of 1784 Louis XVI devoted three million livres to relief of the
poor; Marie Antoinette contributed 200,000 from her own purse; many
others</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ON THE EVE 905</p>
<p>followed suit. King and Queen helped to finance the Deaf and Dumb
School established by the Abbe de L’fipee in 1778 to teach his new deaf
-and-dumb alphabet, and the School for Blind Children organized by
Valentin Haiiy in</p>
<ol start="1784" type="1">
<li>Mme. Necker founded (1778) an asylum and hospital for the poor,
which she personally superintended for ten years. The churches,
monasteries, and convents distributed food and medicines. It was in this
reign that a cam- paign took form to abolish slavery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Manners, like morals, reflected the age of Rousseau; never, under the
Bourbons, had they been so democratic. Class distinctions remained, but
they were tempered with greater kindliness and wider courtesy. Untitled
men of talent, if they had learned to wash and bow, were welcomed in the
most pedigreed homes. The Queen leaped from her carriage to help a
wounded postilion; the King and his brother the Comte d’Artois put their
shoulders to the wheel to help a workman disengage his cart from the
mud. Dress became simpler: wigs disappeared, and gentlemen discarded,
except at court, their embroideries, laces, and swords; by 1789 it was
difficult to tell a man’s class from his garb. When Franklin captured
France even the tailors surrendered to him; people appeared in the
streets “dressed a la Frank - lin, in coarse cloth… and thick shoes.”
37</p>
<p>The ladies of the bourgeoisie dressed quite as handsomely as those of
the court. After 1780 the women abandoned the clumsy hoopskirt, but
fortified themselves with stiff petticoats worn one over the next like a
Chinese puzzle. Bodices were cut low in front, but the bosom was usually
covered with a triangular kerchief called a fichu (fastening); these
could be thickened to conceal underdevelopment; so the French called
them trompeurs or men- teuvs — deceivers or liars. 38 Coiffures
continued high, but when Marie An- toinette lost much of her hair during
one of her confinements she replaced the tower style with curls, and the
new fashion spread through the court to Paris. There were two hundred
styles of women’s hats; some were precarious edifices of wire, feathers,
ribbons, flowers, and artificial vegetables; but in their easier hours
women followed the style affected by the Queen at the Petit Trianon,
covering the head with a simple scarf. In the greatest revolu- tion of
all, some women wore low heels or comfortable mules. 39</p>
<p>A healthier way of life accompanied the change to easier dress. A
growing minority went in for “natural living”: no corsets, no servant s,
more outdoor living, and, whenever possible, a retreat from the city to
the country. Arthur Young reported: “Everybody that have country seats
is at them, and those who have not visit those who have. This revolution
in French manners is certainly one of the best features they have taken
from England. Its intro- duction was the easier because of the magic of
Rousseau’s writings.” 40 But much of this “return to nature” was talk or
sentiment rather than action or reality; life in Paris still ran a dizzy
race with concerts, operas, plays, horse races, water sports, card
games, dances, balls, conversation, and salons.</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE SALON NITRES</li>
</ol>
<p>French women adorned the decline of feudalism not only with the
charms of their persons and their dress, but also with their unrivaled
ability to make French society no mere gathering of gossips but a vital
part of the nation’s intellectual life. Gibbon, after renewing in 1777
his acquaintance with the salons of Paris, wrote:</p>
<p>If Julian could now revisit the capital of France [where he had been
born in a.d. 331], he might converse with men of science and genius
capable of under- standing and instructing a disciple of the Greeks; he
might excuse the graceful follies of a nation whose martial spirit has
never been enervated by the in- dulgence of luxury; and he must applaud
the perfection of that inestimable art which softens and refines and
embellishes the intercourse of social life. 41</p>
<p>And in a letter he added: “It has always seemed to me that in
Lausanne, as well as in Paris, the women are far superior to the men.”
42</p>
<p>The older salonnieres were reluctantly leaving the scene. Mme.
Geoffrin, as we have seen, died in 1777. Mme. du Deffand almost spanned
the century by entering history as one of the Regent’s mistresses 43 and
opening a salon that continued from 1739 to 1780. She had lost most of
the literary lions to Julie de Lespinasse and the new salons, and Horace
Walpole, coming to her for the first time in 1765, found her assortment
of aging aristocrats unexcit- ing. “I sup there twice a week, and bear
all her dull company for the sake of the Regent” 44 — i.e., for her
lively memories of that remarkable interregnum which had set the tone of
French society and morals for the next sixty years. But (Horace added)
she herself “is delicious [at sixty -eight], as eager about what happens
every day as I am about the last century.”</p>
<p>He admired her mind so rapturously — having never met such brilliance
in the still-suppressed women of England — that he went to her every
day, and paid her compliments that seemed to restore her golden days.
She gave him a special chair, which was always reserved for him; she had
him pampered with every form of womanly solicitude. Herself somewhat
masculine, she was not displeased by his almost effeminate delicacy.
Unable to see him, she could mold her image of him close to her heart’s
desire, and fell in love with that image. Able to see her, he could
never forget her age and her physical helplessness. When he went back to
England she wrote him letters almost as warm with devotion as those of
Julie de Lespinasse to Guibert, and written in as fine a prose as that
age could show. His replies tried to check her ela- tion; he shivered at
the thought of what the Selwyns of England would do with such a juicy
morsel for satire. She suffered his reproofs, reaffirmed her love,
agreed to call it friendship, but assured him that in France friendship
was often deeper and stronger than love. “I belong to you more than to
my - self…. I wish I could send you my soul instead of a letter. I would
will- ingly give up years of my life to be sure of being alive when you
come back to Paris.” She compared him to Montaigne, “and this is the
highest praise I could give you, for I find no mind as just or as clear
as his.” 45</p>

<p>ON THE EVE</p>

<p>He went to Paris again in August, 1767. She awaited him with virginal
excitement. “At last, at last, no sea divides us. I cannot make myself
believe that a man of your importance, with jiis hands on the wheel of a
great gov- ernment, and therefore of Europe, could… leave everything to
come and see an old sibyl in the comer of a convent. It is really too
absurd, but I am enchanted…. Come, my tutor!… It is not a dream — I know
I am</p>
<p>awake — I shall see you today!” She sent her carriage for him ; he
went to her at once. For six weeks he gladdened her with his presence
and saddened her with his cautions. When he had gone back to England she
could think only of his returning to Paris. “You will make my sunset far
more beautiful and happy than my noon or my dawn. Your pupil, who is as
submissive as a child, only wishes to see you.” 48</p>
<p>On March 30, 1773, he asked her to write no more. 47 Then he
relented, and the correspondence was resumed. In February, 1775, he
asked her to re- turn all his letters. She complied, with a delicate
suggestion that he recipro- cate. “You will have enough to light your
fires for a long time if you add to - fered to replace it out of his own
income; she did not think it necessary.</p>
<p>The collapse of her romance darkened the natural pessimism of a woman
who missed the colors of life but knew its shallows and depths. Even in
her blindness she could see through all gallant surfaces to the
indefatigable self- ishness of the self. “My poor tutor,” she asked
Walpole, “have you met only monsters, crocodiles, and hyenas? As for me
I see only fools, idiots, liars, en- vious and sometimes perfidious
people…. Everyone I see here dries up my soul. I find no vir tue, no
sincerity, no simplicity, in anyone.” 49 Little reli - gious belief
survived to comfort her. Yet she continued her suppers, usually twice a
week, and often dined our, if only to avoid the boredom of days as dark
as the nights.</p>
<p>At last she, who had learned to hate life, stopped clutching at it,
and re- conciled herself to death. The illnesses that plague old age had
mounted and combined, and she felt too weak, at eighty-three, to combat
them. She sum- moned a priest and made, without much faith, her
surrender to hope. In Au- gust, 1780, she sent her last letter to
Walpole:</p>
<p>I am worse today…. I cannot think that this condition means anything
but the end. I am not strong enough to be frightened, and as I am not to
see you again I have nothing to regret…. Amuse yourself, my friend, as
well as you can. Do not distress yourself about my condition…. You will
regret me, for one is glad to know that one is loved. 50</p>
<p>She died on September 23, having left to Walpole her papers and her
dog. Many other salonnieres continued the great tradition: Mesdames
d’Hou - detot, d’fipinay, Denis, de Genlis, Luxembourg, Condorcet,
Boufflers, Choi - seul, Gramont, Beauharnais (wife of an uncle to
Josephine). Add to all these</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>he last great pre-Revolutionary salon — Mme. Necker’s. About 1770 she
be - gan her Friday receptions; later she received also on Tuesdays,
when music ruled; there the Gluck-Piccini war divided the diners, and
Mile. Clairon united them by reciting passages from her favorite roles.
On Fridays one might meet there Diderot, A 4 armontel, Morellet,
d’Alembert (after Julie’s death), Saint- Lambert, Grimm (after Mme.
d’£pinay’s death), Gibbon, Raynal, Buffon, Guibert, Galiani, Pigalle,
and Suzanne’s special literary friend, An - toine Thomas. It was at one
of these gatherings (April, 1770) that the idea was broached of a statue
to Voltaire. There Diderot muzzled his heresies, and became almost
refined. “It is regrettable to me,” he wrote to Mme. Necker, “that I did
not have the good fortune of knowing you sooner. You would certainly
have inspired in me a sense of pureness and delicacy that would have
passed from my soul into my works.” 51 Others did not report so
favorably. Marmontel, though he remained her friend for twenty-five
years, described Suzanne in his Memoirs: “Unacquainted with the manners
and customs of Paris, she had none of the charms of a young
Frenchwoman…. She had no taste in her dress, no ease in her demeanor, no
charm in her po- liteness, and her mind, as well as the expression of
her face, was too com- pletely adjusted to possess grace. Her most
attractive qualities were those of decorum, sincerity, an d kindliness
of heart.” 52 Aristocratic ladies did not take</p>
<p>In 17 66 she gave birth to the future A 4 me. de Stael. Germaine
Necker, growing up among philosophers and statesmen, became a pundit at
ten. Her precocious intelligence made her the pride of her parents until
her willful and excitable temperament proved hard on her mother’s
nerves. Suzanne, more conservative every day, subjected Germaine to
strict discipline; the daughter rebelled, and discord in the elegant
home rivaled the chaos in the finances of the state. Necker’s
difficulties in trying to stave off governmental bankruptcy despite the
American war, and Mme. Necker’s resentment of every criticism that he
received in the press, added to the mother’s unhappi - ness, and Suzanne
began to long for the calm life that she had led in Switzer- land.</p>
<p>In 1786 Germaine married, and took over part of the duties of hostess
in her mother’s salon. But the French salon was now in decline; literary
discus - sion was giving way to eager and partisan politics. “I have no
literary news to give you,” Suzanne wrote to a friend in 1786. “Such
conversation is no longer the fashion; the crisis is too great; people
do not care to play chess on the edge of a precipice.” 55 In 1790 the
family moved to Coppet, a chateau</p>

<p>ON THE EVE</p>

<li>MUSIC</li>
</ol>
<p>“As far as music is concerned,” Mozart wrote from Paris on May 1,
1778, “I am surrounded by mere brute beasts…. Ask anyone you like— pro-
vided he is not a Frenchman born — and if he knows anything about the
matter he will say exactly the same…. I shall thank Almighty God if I
escape with my taste unspoiled.” 56 These were hard words, but Grimm and
Goldoni agreed with them; 57 however, all three critics were foreigners.
The musical taste of the upper-class Parisians reflected their manners,
inclining to restraint of expression and regularity of form; it still
echoed the age of Louis XIV. Yet it was precisely in these first years
of the new reign that half of Paris lost restraint, and perhaps good
manners, in the excitement of the battle over Piccini and Gluck. And
note Julie de Lespinasse’s letter of Sep - tember 22, 1774: “I go
constantly to Orfe et Eurydice. I long to hear a dozen times a day that
air w hich rends me,… ‘J’ai perdu mon Eury - dice.’” 58 Paris was not
dead to music, though it imported more than it pro - duced.</p>
<p>In 1751 Frangois-Joseph Gossec, aged seventeen, came from his native
Hainaut to Paris with a letter of introduction to Rameau. The old master
secured for him a post as conductor of the private orchestra maintained
by Alexandre- Joseph de La Popeliniere. For that “band” Gossec composed
(1754 f.) symphonies antedating Haydn’s first by five years, and in 1754
he published quar tets antedating Haydn’s by a year. In 1760 he
presented in the Church of St. Roch his Messe des Morts , which
originated the idea of playing the wind instruments of the Tuba uiirwn
outside the church. There was no end to Gossec’s enterprise and versatil
ity. In 1784 he founded the Lcole Royale du Chant, which became the
nucleus of the renowned Paris Conservatoire de Musique. He achieved a
moderate success in opera, comic and serious. He adjusted himself to the
Revolution, and composed some of its most famous songs, including the
“Hymn to the Supreme Being” for Robespierre’s celebration (June 8,
1794). He survived all political modula - tions, dying in 1 829 at the
age of ninety-five.</p>
<p>The dominant figure in the French opera of this period was Andre</p>
<p>Gretry. Like so many others prominent in French music in the
eighteenth century, he was an alien, born at Liege in 1741, son of a
violinist. On the day of his first Communion, he tells us, he asked God
to let him die at once un- less he was destined to be a good man and a
great musician. That day a rafter fell on his head and severely wounded
him; he recovered, and concluded that a noble future was divinely
promised him. 59 From the age of sixteen he suffered periodically from
internal hemorrhages, vomiting six cups of blood in a day; he was
subject to fevers and occasional delirium, and at times he went almost
mad from inability to stop some strain of music from turning round and
round in his head. Even bad music could be forgiven to a man who was so
tormented and yet kept his good cheer through seventy-two years.</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>At the age of seventeen he composed six symphonies, good enough to
secure from a cathedral canon the means of going to Rome. If we may be-
lieve the engaging Memoires which he published in 1797, he walked all
the way. 90 During his eight years in Italy he was influenced by the
success of Pergolesi to compose comic operas. Coming to Paris (1767), he
received encouragement from Diderot, Grimm, and Rousseau. He studied the
dra- matic art of Mile. Clairon, developed a special skill in adjusting
his music to the accents and inflexions of dramatic speech, and achieved
in his operas a lyric delicacy and tenderness that seemed to reflect the
spirit of Rousseau, and the return to simplicity and sentiment in French
life. He continued to be popular throughout the Revolution, which
ordered his works to be pub- lished at the government’s e xpense; arias
from his operas were sung by revolutionary crowds. Napoleon gave him a
pension. Everybody liked him because he had so few of the stigmata of
genius: he was kindly, affectionate, sociable, modest, spoke well of his
rivals, and paid his debts. He loved Rous- seau, though Rousseau had
offended him; in his old age he bought the Hermitage, where Rousseau had
lived. In that cottage, on September 24, 1813, while Napoleon was
fighting all Europe, Gretry died.</p>
<p>V. ART UNDER LOUIS XVI</p>
<p>Now the style Louis Seize, which had begun almost with the birth of
Louis XVI (1754), continued its reaction against the sinuous
irregularities of baroque and the feminine delicacies of rococo, and
moved toward the masculine lines and symmetrical proportions of a
neoclassical art inspired by the excavations at Herculaneum and the
Greco-Roman fervor of Winckel- mann. The most famous example of the new
style in architecture is the Petit Trianon; it is amusing that Mme. du
Barry and Marie Antoinette, who were not on speaking terms, agreed in
enjoying this modest tribute to classical order and simplicity. Another
pretty example is the present Palais de la Legion d’Honneur, built as
the Hotel Salm (1782) by Pierre Rousseau on the left bank of the Seine.
A more massive product of the style is the Palais de Justice as rebuilt
in 1776, with its magnificent wrought-iron grille fronting the Cour de
Mai. The Theatre National de l’Odeon (1779) took a somber Doric form;
more amiable is the theater raised at Amiens (1778) by Jacques Rous-
seau in a union of classical and Renaissance. At Bordeaux Victor Louis
built (1775) on classical lines an immense theater which Arthur Young
described as “by far the most magnificent in France; I have seen nothing
that ap - proaches it.” 61</p>
<p>Interior decoration retained French elegance. Tapestry was going out
of fashion except as covering for armchairs and sofas; painted wallpaper
was coming in from China, but was used chiefly in bedrooms; the walls of
salons were generally divided into panels of treated wood, carved or
painted with figures or floral arabesques rivaling the best in Italy.
The finest furniture in the France of Louis XVI was designed and made by
two Germans, Jean-</p>

<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>9 1 1</p>
<p>Henri Riesener and David Roentgen; the Wallace Collection has some
en- viable examples made for Marie Antoinette and the Petit Trianon.</p>
<p>Sculpture flourished. Pigalle, Falconet, and Jean-Jacques Caffieri
lived on from the days of Louis XV. Augustin Pajou, who had begun work
in that reign, now came into his own. Under commissions from Louis XVI
he carved decorations for the Palais-Royal and the Palais-Bourbon. In
his Psyche Abandoned ’, 62 he tried to reconcile two elements in the new
age- tender sentiment and classic form. He transmitted his art — and
gave his daughter in marriage — to Clodion, whose real name was Claude
Michel. Clodion carved a way to prosperity with terra-cotta groups
slightly erotic, and reached his zenith with a statue of Montesquieu. 63
All the ecstasy of the flesh sings in the Nymph and Satyr now in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>
<p>The supreme sculptor of the age was Jean-Antoine Houdon. His father
was a porter, but in an art school. Born in Versailles, Jean breathed
sculpture from the statues with which Louis XIV had peopled the gardens
of Le Notre. After studying with Pigalle he won the Prix de Rome at
twenty, and sallied off to Italy (1760). The St. Bruno that he carved in
Rome so pleased Clement XIV that he commented, “The Saint would speak,
were it not that the rules of his order impose silence.” 64 In Paris he
carved or cast a succession of Dianas; one in bronze, in the Huntington
Collection, is a marvel of classic features and French grace. More
famous is the bronze Diane Nue now in the Louvre; it was refused a place
in the Salon of 1785, perhaps because (said a critic) “she was too
beautiful and too nude to be exposed to the public,” 65 more probably
because the statue violated the traditional conception of Diana as
chaste.</p>
<p>Houdon, like so many artists of the eighteenth century, found more
profit in contemporary portraits than in inviolable goddesses.
Nevertheless he re- solved to be fair with the facts, and to show a
character rather than a face. He spent many hours in the dissecting
rooms of medical schools, studying anatomy. When possible he made
careful measurements of the sitter’s head, and carved or cast the statue
to correspond. When question arose as to whether a corpse that had been
exhumed in Paris was really, as claimed, that of John Paul Jones, the
shape and measurements of the skull were compared with those of the
portrait that Houdon had cast in 1781, and the agreement was so close
that the identity was accepted as confirmed. 66 He cut into the marble
of his Mirabeau all the ravages of smallpox, and showed every shadow and
wrinkle, even the fire and depth of the eyes, and the lips parted in
readiness to speak.</p>
<p>Soon all the Titans of the upheaval were glad to sit for him, and he
trans- mitted them to us with a fidelity that turned marble and bronze
into the flesh and soul of history. So we now can see Voltaire,
Rousseau, Diderot, d’Alem - bert, Buffon, Turgot, Louis XVI, Catherine
II, Cagliostro, Lafayette, Na- poleon, Ney. When Voltaire came to Paris
in 1778 Houdon made several statues of him: a bronze bust now in the
Louvre, showing exhaustion and weariness; a similar marble bust now in
the Victoria and Albert Museum;</p>
<p>912</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>another in the Wallace Collection; an idealized smiling head ordered
by Frederick the Great; and, most famous of all, the statue presented by
Mme. Denis to the Comedie-Frangaise: Voltaire seated in a flowing robe,
bony fingers grasping the arms of the chair, thin lips, toothless mouth,
some gaiety still in the wistful eyes — this is one of the great statues
in the history of art. In that same year, hearing of Rousseau’s death,
Houdon hurried to Ermenon - ville and took a death mask of Voltaire’s
rival; from this he made the bust now in the Louvre; this too is a
masterpiece.</p>
<p>There were American heroes also, and Houdon made such lifelike heads
of them that coins of the United States still bear his likenesses of
Washing- ton, Franklin, and Jefferson. When Franklin returned to America
in 1785 Houdon went with him; he hastened to Mt. Vernon and persuaded
the busy and impatient Washington to sit for him, on and off, for a
fortnight; so he made the statue that adorns the state capitol at
Richmond, Virginia — a man of granite, sombered with costly victories
and remaining tasks. Here again is that union of body and soul which is
the sign and seal of Houdon’s art.</p>
<p>Such sculpture would have made painting a minor delicacy had it not
been that Greuze and Fragonard continued to work throughout the reign
and the Revolution, and that Jacques-Louis David, a painter, in a career
as meteoric as Napoleon’s, rose to a dictatorship over all the arts in
France. He learned</p>
<p>Back in Paris, he exhibited a succession of classical subjects
severely drawn: Andromache Weeping over the Dead Body of Hector (1783),
The Oath of the Horatii (1785), The Death of Socrates (1787), Brutus
Return- ing from Condenming His Sons to Death (1789). 67 (In the legend
as told by Livy, Lucius Junius Brutus, as praetor of the young Roman
Republic (509 b.c.), sentenced his own sons to death for conspiring to
restore the kings.) David had painted this last picture in Rome; when he
offered it to the Academy in Paris its exhibition was forbidden; the art
public protested; finally the canvas was shown, and added to the
revolutionary fever of the time. Paris saw in these paintings, and in
the stern ethic they conveyed, a double revolt — against aristocratic
rococo and royal tyranny. David became the radical hero of the Paris
studios.</p>
<p>During the Revolution he was elected to the Convention, and in
January, 1793, he voted for the execution of the King. Another deputy
who had so voted was slain by a royalist (January 20, 1793); the body
was exhibited to the public as that of a republican martyr; David
painted T he Last Moments</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>913</p>
<p>of Lepeletier; the Convention hung it in its chamber. When Marat was
slain by Charlotte Corday (July 13, 1793), David pictured the dead man
lying half immersed in his bath; seldom had art been so realistic, or so
calcu- lated to arouse feeling. These two paintings established the
martyrology of the Revolution. David worked enthusiastically for Danton
and Robespierre; in return he was made director of all art in Paris.</p>
<p>When Napoleon took power with the Roman title of consul, David</p>
<p>painted for him as zealously as he had done for the leaders of the
Terror. He saw Bonaparte as the Son of the Revolution, fighting to keep
the kings of Europe from restoring their like to France. When Napoleon
made himself emperor (1804) David’s adoration was not subdued; and
Napoleon made him painter to the imperial court. The artist produced for
him several fa- mous pictures: Napoleon Crossing the Alps, The
Coronation of Josephine by Napoleon, and The Distribution of the Eagles;
these immense paintings were later placed on the walls of rooms in the
palace at Versailles. Mean- while David displayed his versatility with
excellent portraits of Mme. Re- camier and Pope Pius VI. 68 When the
Bourbons were restored David was banished as a regicide; he retired to
Brussels, where his wife (who had left him in 1791 because of his
revolutionary ardor) came to share his exile. Now he returned to
classical subjects, and to the sculptural style of painting favored by
Mengs. In 1825, aged seventy-seven, he ended one of the most spectacular
careers in the history of art.</p>
<p>Among his portraits is one of Mme. Vigee-Lebrun, who rejected revolu-
tion and preferred kings and queens. Toward the end of her eighty-seven
years (1755-1842) she published memoirs giving a pleasant account of her
youth, a sad story of her marriage, an itinerary of her artistic
odyssey, and a picture of a good woman shocked by the violence of
history. Her father, a portrait painter, died when she was thirteen,
leaving no fortune, but Elisa- beth had been so apt a pupil that by the
age of sixteen she was earning a good income from her portraits. In 1776
she married another painter, Pierre Lebrun, grandnephew of the Charles
Le Brun who had been master of arts for Louis XIV. Her husband (she
tells us) squandered her fortune and his through “his unbri dled passion
for women of bad morals, joined to his fond- ness for gambling.” 69 She
bore him a daughter (1778), and soon thereafter</p>
<p>In 1779 she painted Marie Antoinette, who so fancied her as to sit
for twenty portraits. The two women became such friends that they sang
to- gether the tender airs with which Gretry was drawing tears from
Paris eyes. This royal favor, and the genteel elegance of her work,
opened all doors to the attractive painter. She made every woman
beautiful, putting roses into faded cheeks; soon every moneyed lady
itched to sit. She received such high fees that she was able to maintain
an expensive apartment and a salon fre- quented by the best musicians of
Paris.</p>
<p>Despite her friendship with the Queen, she went out three times to
por- tray Mme. du Barry at Louveciennes. On the third occasion (July 14,
1789) she heard the sound of cannon firing in Paris. She returned to the
city to find</p>
<p>9 H ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>hat the Bastille had been taken, and that the victorious populace was
carry- ing noble heads on bloody pikes. On October 5, while another mob
was tramping to Versailles to make the King and Queen their captives,
she gath- ered what she could of her belongings and began thirteen years
of voluntary exile. In Rome she made the familiar portrait of herself
and her daughter. 70 At Naples she pictured Lady Hamilton as a
bacchante. 71 She painted in Vienna, Berlin, and St. Petersburg; and
when the Revolution had run its course she returned to France (1802).
There, triumphant over all vicissi- tudes, she lived another forty
years, wisely dying before revolution was re- newed.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>LITERATURE</li>
</ol>
<p>In the brief period between 1774 and 1789 French literature produced
some memorable works that still find readers and move minds: the Maximes
of Chamfort, the Paul et Virginie of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, the
Liaisons danger euses of Choderlos de Laclos (of which we have said
enough), and the chaotic but revealing volumes of Restif de La
Bretonne.</p>
<p>These were islands erupting from a literary sea of schools,
libraries, read- ing circles, lectures, newspapers, magazines,
pamphlets, and books — such a froth and ferment of ink as the world had
never known before. Only a small minority of the French people could
read; 72 nevertheless millions of them were thirsty for knowledge and
bursting with ideas. Encyclopedias, com- pendiums of science, outlines
of knowledge, were in wide demand. The phil- osophes and the reformers
were investing high hopes in the spread of edu- cation.</p>
<p>Though the Jesuits were gone and the schools were now controlled by
the state, most of the teaching was still in the hands of the clergy.
The univer- sities, rigidly orthodox in religion and politics, had
fallen into torpor and disrepute, and were only beginning, at the end of
the century, to notice the sciences. But public lectures on science were
eagerly attended, and technical schools were multiplying. In the
colleges nearly all the students were of the middle class; young nobles
went rather to one or another of the twelve mili- tary academies that
Saint-Germain had set up in or after 1776. (In one of these, at Brienne,
Napoleon Bonaparte was studying.) College students, we are told,
“frequently formed organizations to support political demonstra -
tions”; 73 and as there were at this time more college graduates than
the French economy could use, the placeless ones became voices of
discontent; such men wrote pamphlets that stoked the fires of
revolt.</p>
<p>The rich had private libraries, enviably housed, of books
luxuriously</p>
<p>bound and sometimes read. The middle and lower classes used
circulating li- braries, or bought their books — nearly all paperbacks —
from stalls or stores. In 1774 the sale of books in Paris was estimated
to be four times that of much more populous London. 74 Restif de La
Bretonne reported that reading had made the workers of Paris
“intractable.” 75</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI )</p>
<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>9 r 5</p>
<p>Newspapers were growing in number, size, and influence. The old Ga-
zette de France, established in 1631, was still the official — and
distrusted — purveyor of political news. The Mercure de France, which
had begun in 1672 as the Mercure galant, had in 1790 a circulation of
thirteen thousand copies, which was thought excellent; Mirabeau called
it the ablest of the French newspapers. 76 The Journal de Paris, the
first French daily, began publication in 1777; the more famous Moniteur
did not appear till Novem- ber 24, 1789. There were many provincial
newspapers, like the Courier de Provence, which was edited by Mirabeau
fils.</p>
<p>Pamphlets were an inundation that finally swept everything before
them. In the last months of 1788 some 2,500 were published in France. 77
Some had historic effect, like the Abbe Sieyes’ Qu’est -ce que le
Tiers-etat? or Camille Desmoulins’ La France libre. By July, 1 789, t he
press was the strongest force in France. Necker described it, in 1784,
as “an invisible power which, though without wealth, without weapons,
and without an army, dictates alike to town and court, and even in the
palaces of kings.” 78 Songs played a part in the agitation; Chamfort
called the government a monarchy limited by popular airs. 79</p>
<p>Chamfort himself was snatched up into the revolutionary current, and
passed from being persona grata at court to taking part in storming the
Bas- tille. Born the son of a village grocer (1741), he came to Paris
and lived on his wits and wit. Women housed and fed him merely to have
the stimulus of his conversation. He wrote several dramas, one of which,
performed at Fon- tainebleau, so pleased Marie Antoinette that she
persuaded the King to give him a pension of twelve hundred livres. He
was made secretary to a sister of Louis XVI, and received an additional
two thousand livres a year. Every- thing seemed to bind him to the royal
cause, but in 1783 he met Mirabeau, and was soon changed into a caustic
critic of the government. It was he who gave Sieyes the catching title
for his famous pamphlet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inspired by La Rochefoucauld, Vauvenargues, and Voltaire,
he jotted down “maxims” expressing his sa rdonic view of the world. Mme.
Helvetius, who for years kept him as a house guest at Sevres, said,
“When - ever I had a conversation with Chamfort in the morning, I was
saddened for the rest of the day.” 80 He thought life a hoax upon hope.
“Hope is a ch arla- tan that always deceives us; and as for myself, my
happiness began only when I abandoned hope.” 81 “If the cruel truths,
the sad discoveries, the secrets of society, which compose the knowledge
of a man of the world who has reached the age of forty, had been known
to this same man at the age of twenty, either he would have fallen into
despair or he would have deliberately become corrupt.” 82 Coming at the
end of the Age of Reason, Chamfort laughed at reason as less a master of
passion than a tool of evil. “Man, in the actual state of society, seems
more corrupted by his reason than by his passions.” 83 As for women,
“whatever evil a man can think of them, there is no woman who does not
think still worse of them than he does.” 84 Marriage is a snare.
“Marriage and celibacy are both of them troublesome; we should prefer
that one whose inconveniences are not without remedy.” 85</p>
<p>9 1 6 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>“Women give to friendship only what they borrow from love,” 86 and
“love, such as it exists in society, is nothing but an exchange of

<p>When Chamfort stepped out of palaces and mansions into the streets of
Paris his pessimism was inten sified. “Paris, city of amusement and
pleasure, where four fifths of the people die of grief,… a place that
stinks and where no one loves.” 88 The only cure for these slums would
be childlessness. “It is unfortunate for mankind, fortunate for tyrants
, that the poor and mis- erable do not have the instinct or pride of the
elephant, who does not repro- duce in captivity.” 89</p>
<p>Chamfort at times indulged in an ideal. “It is necessary to unite
contraries: the love of virtue with indifference to public opinion; the
taste for work with indifference to fame; and the care of one’s health
with indifference to life.” 90 For some years he thought to give meaning
to life by dedicating him - self to revolution, but five years of
dealing with Mirabeau, Danton, Marat, and Robespierre regenerated his
despair. It seemed to him then that the Rev- olutionary motto “Liberty,
equality, fraternity” had come to mean “Be my brother or I’ll kill you.”
91 He cast in his lot with the Girondins, and lashed the more radical
leaders with his reckless wit. He was arrested, but was soon released.
Threatened again with arrest, he shot and stabbed himself. He lin- gered
till April 13, 1794, an d died after saying to Sieyes, “I go at last out

<p>If the influence of Voltaire predominated in Chamfort, that of
Rousseau was complete and avowed in Jacques-Henri Bernardin de
Saint-Pierre. At the age of thirty-one (1768) he went as an engineer on
a governmental com- mission to the He de France, now called Mauritius.
In that mountainous, rainy, fruitful island he found what he thought was
Rousseau’s “state of na - tu re”— men and women living close to the
earth and free from the vices of civilization. Returning to France
(1771), he became a devoted friend of Jean-Jacques, learned to tolerate
his tantrums, and to think of him as another saviour for mankind. In a
Voyage a File de France (1773) he described the simple life and
sustaining religious faith of the island’s population. The bishop of Aix
saw in this book a wholesome reaction against Voltaire, and secured for
the author a royal pension of a thousand livres. Bernardin re- sponded
with Etudes de la nature (1784) and Les Harmonies de la nature (1796),
in which he described the wonders of plant and animal life, and argued
that the many instances of apparent adaptation, purpose, and design
prove the existence of a supreme intelligence. He went beyond Rousseau
in exalting feeling above reason. “The further reason advances, the more
it brings us evidence of our nothingness; and far from calming our
sorrows by its researches, it often increases them by its light…. But
feeling… gives us a sublime impulsion, and in subjugating our reason it
becomes the noblest and most gratifying instinct in human life.” 93</p>
<p>To a second edition of the Etudes (1788) Bernardin appended a
romance,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>() N THE EVE</p>
<p>9 l l</p>
<p>Paul et Virginie , which has remained a classic of French literature
through a dozen shifts of taste. Two pregnant Frenchwomen come to
Mauritius, one whose husband has died, the other whose lover has
deserted her. One gives birth to Paul, the other to Virginie. The
children grow up in a mountain valley, amid majestic scenery scented
with natural flowers. Their morals are formed by maternal devotion and
religious teaching. As soon as they reach puberty they fall in love with
each other — no one else being around. Virginie is sent to France to
collect an inheritance — which does not often happen in a state of
nature. She is offered marriage and great fortune if she will stay in
France, but she rejects them to return to Mauritius and Paul. He runs
down to the shore to see her ship approaching; he is overjoyed with
thoughts of love and happiness; but the vessel runs into shallows, is
grounded, and is shattered by a storm; Virginie is drowned in trying to
reach the shore. Paul dies of grief.</p>
<p>The little book is a prose poem, told with a simplicity of style and
a purity and music of language nowhere surpassed in French literature.
Its piety and sentiment fell in with the mood of the time, and no one
was disturbed by the fact that these virtuous women and children had
slaves. 94 Bernardin was hailed as the authentic successor of Rousseau;
women wrote to him in the same tone of devout admiration with which they
had comforted the author of Emile. Like him, Bernardin did not take
advantage of his fame; he shunned society, and lived quietly among the
poor. The Revolution left him unharmed. Amid its violence he married, at
fifty-five, Felicite Didot, aged twenty-two; she gave him two children,
who were named Paul and Virg inie. After Felicite’s death he married
again, at sixty -three, a young woman, Desiree de Pellepou, who took
care of him lovingly till his death in 1814. Before he departed he saw
the rise of Chateaubriand, who took the torch of French romanticism and
piety from his hands, and carried it into the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>There were in this age some minor books which are no longer read, but
which shared in giving voice and color to the time. Abbe Jean- Jacques
Bar- thelemy published at the age of seventy -two (1788), after working
on it for thirty years, Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grece , which
purported to de- scribe the physical appearance, the antiquities,
institutions, customs, and coins of Greece in the fourth century before
Christ, as seen by a Scythian traveler; it came on the crest of the
classic wave, and was one of the out- standing literary successes of the
age. It almost established the science of nu- mismatics in France.</p>
<p>Its popularity was rivaled by Les Ruines , ou Meditations sur les
revolu- tions des empires , which Comte Constantin de Volney issued in
1791 after four years of travel in Egypt and Syria. Seeing the shattered
remnants of an- cient civilizations, he asked, “Who can assure us that a
like desolation will not one day be the lot of our country?” We should
now hesitate to give an optimistic answer to this question, but Volney,
coming at the close of the Age of Reason, and inheriting, like
Condorcet, all its hopes for mankind,</p>
<p>9 ! 8 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>informed his readers that the collapse of those old empires had been
due to the ignorance of their peoples, and that this had been due to the
difficulty of transmitting knowledge from man to man and from generation
to genera- tion. But now these difficulties had been overcome by the
invention of print- ing. All that is needed henceforth to avert the ruin
of civilization is the wide dissemination of knowledge, which leads men
and states to reconcile their unsocial impulses with the common good. In
this equilibrium of forces war will give way to arbitration, and “the
whole species will become one great society , a single family governed
by the same spirit and by common laws, enjoying all the felicity of
which human nature is capable.” 95</p>
<p>We come to the incredible career of Nicolas-Edme Restif de La
Bretonne, called, by some contemporaries, “the Rousseau of the gutter”
and “the Vol - taire of the chambermaids”; author of some two hundred
volumes, many of them printed by his own hand and press, some
deliberately pornographic, all constituting a detailed picture of the
morals and manners of the lower classes in the reign of Louis XVI.</p>
<p>In La Vie de mon pere (1779) he gave a tenderly idealized account of
his father, Edmond, whom he remembered as having “the air of a Hercules
and the gentleness of a girl.” 96 The son recorded his own life in
sixteen meander - ing volumes entitled Monsieur Nicolas (1794-97), ^ act
a °d fiction about his vicissitudes, amours, and ideas. He was born in a
farmhouse (1737) in Sacy (one section of which was called La Bretonne),
twenty miles from Auxerre. At the age of eleven, he assures us, he first
became a father. 97 At fourteen he fell in love with Jeannette Rousseau,
seventeen, and began his lifelong adora- tion of female feet. “My
feeling for her was as pure and tender as it was intense…. Her pretty
foot was irresistible to me.” 98 Perhaps to disengage him from such
entanglements he was sent to Auxerre (1751) to serve as apprentice to a
printer. He soon seduced his master’s wife; but for this he is the sole
authority. By the age of fifteen, he tells us, he had had fifteen “mis -
tresses.” After four years of this pursuit he moved to Paris; there he
was employed as a journeyman printer, earning two and a half francs a
day, which enabled him to eat, and to pay for an occasional prostitute;
sometimes, when his funds were low, he slept with charcoal women. 99 In
1760, aged twenty-six, he married a woman almost as experienced as
himself, Agnes Lebeque; each proved unfaithful. They were divorced in
1784, not because of these peccadilloes, but because both had fallen
into authorship, and they were competing for paper, ink, and fame.</p>
<p>Nicolas had begun his career as a writer in 1767, with Le Pied de
Fan- chette, in which the piece de resistance was the lass’s foot. His
first literary success was Le Paysan perverti (1775). It tells in letter
form how the peas- ant Edmond, moving to Paris, is perverted by city
life and irreligion. A freethinker, Gaudit d’ Arras, teaches him that
God is a myth and morality a sham, that all pleasures are legitimate,
that virtue is an unwarranted imposi- tion upon the natural rights of
our desires, and that our prime obligation is</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI )</p>
<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>9 r 9</p>
<p>o live as fully as possible. 100 Arras is arrested; Edmond tells him,
“There is a God”; Arras is hanged impenitent. One contemporary called
the book “the Liaisons dangereuses of the people”; 101 Restif thought it
w ould live as long as the French language. 102 In a companion volume,
La Paysanne per- vertie (1784), he continued his attack upon amoralism
and the corruptions of city life. He used his royalties to raise himself
a notch or two on the social scale of adultery.</p>
<p>Restif’s most significant work was Les Contemporaries, which ran to
sixty-five volumes (1780-91). These short stories had an attractive
subtitle: “Aventures des plus jolies femmes de l’age present”— the
lives, loves, and manners of flower girls, chestnut sellers, charcoal
vendors, seamstresses, hair- dressers, described so realistically and
accurately that actual persons recog- nized themselves, and cursed the
author when they met him in the streets. 103 Not till Balzac was so
large a panorama of human life presented in French literature. Critics
condemned Restif’s addiction to “low subjects,” but Se - bastien
Mercier, whose Tableau de Paris (1781-90) was offering a more systematic
survey of the city, pronounced him “incontestably our greatest</p>
<p>Just before the Revolution Restif began to record, in Les Nuits de
Paris (1788-94), the incidents that he witnessed (or imagined) on his
nightly walks. Again he noted chiefly the lower depths of Paris —
beggars, porters, pickpockets, smugglers, gamblers, drunkards,
kidnapers, thieves, deviates, prostitutes, pimps, and suicides. He
claimed to have seen little happiness, much misery, and he pictured
himself as in many cases a rescuing hero. He visited the cafes near the
Palais-Royal, and saw the Revolution taking form; he heard Camille
Desmoulins’ famous call to arms; saw the victorious mob parading the
severed head of de Launay, warden of the Bastille; saw the women
marching to capture the King at Versailles. 105 Soon he tired of the
violence, the terror, the insecurity of life. He was several times in
danger of arrest, but escaped by professions of revolutionary faith.
Privately he de- nounced it all, and wi shed that “good Louis XVI could
be restored to</p>
<p>power.” 106 He berated Rousseau for having unleashed the passions of
the young, the ignorant, and the sentimental. “It is Smile that has
brought us this arrogant generation, stubborn and insolent and willful,
which speaks loudly, and silences the elderly.” 107</p>
<p>So he grew old, and repented the ideas, but not the sins, of his
youth. In 1794 he was again a poor man, rich only in memories and
grandchildren. He drew up in Volume XIII of Monsieur Nicolas a
calendrier of the men and women in his life, including several hundred
paramours, and he reaffirmed his belief in God. In 1 800 the Comtesse de
Beauharnais told Napoleon that Restif was living in poverty, without
heat in his room; Napoleon sent him money, a servant, and a guard, and
(1805) gave him a place in the ministry of police. On February 8, 1 806,
Restif died, aged seventy-two. The Countess and several members of the
Institute de France (which had refused him ad- mission) joined the
eighteen hundred commoners who followed his funeral.</p>

<p>“The more I see of the French theater,” wrote Arthur Young in 1788,
“the more I am forced to acknowledge its superiority to our own, in the
number of its good performers,… in the quality of dancers, singers, and
persons on whom the business of the theater depends, all established on
a grand scale.” 108 At the Theatre -Frangais, rebuilt in 1782, and in
many pro- vincial theaters, performances were given every night,
including Sundays. In acting there was now an interregnum: Lekain died,
and Sophie Arnould re- tired, in 1778; Talma, future favorite of
Napoleon, made his debut with the Comedie-F ran^aise in 1787, and earned
his first triumph in Marie-Joseph Chenier’s Charles IX in 1789. The most
popular playwright of the time was Michel-Jean Sedaine, who wrote
sentimental comedies that kept the French stage for a century. We salute
him and pass on to the man who, with the help of Mozart and Rossini,
gave life to Figaro, and (as he saw it) freedom to America.</p>
<p>Pierre- Augustin Caron, like Voltaire, lived twenty-four years
without knowing his historic name. His father was a watchmaker in the
St.-Denis suburb of Paris. After some rebellion he resigned himself to
follow the pater- nal trade. At the age of twenty-one he invented a new
type of escapement which enabled him to make “excellent watches as flat
and as small as may be thought fit.” 109 He pleased Louis XV with a
sample, and for Mme. de Pom- padour made one so small that it fitted
into her ring; this, he claimed, was the smallest watch ever
constructed. In 1755 he bought from its aging holder, M. Franquet, a
place among the “controllers of the royal pantry,” who waited upon the
King at his meals; it was no very exalted post, but it gave Pierre entry
to the court. A year later Franquet died; Pierre married the widow
(1756), six years older than himself; and, as she owned a small fief,
Pierre added its name to his own, and became Beaumarchais. When his wife
died (1757) he inherited her property.</p>
<p>He had never received any secondary education, but everyone — even
the aristocrats who resented his agile climb — recognized the alertness
of his mind and the quickness of his wit. In the salons and the cafes he
met Diderot, d’Alembert, and other philosophes, and imbibed the
Enlightenment. An im - provement that he had made in the pedal
arrangement of the harp caught the attention of Louis XV’s unmarried
daughters; i n 1759 he began to give them lessons on the harp. The
banker Joseph Paris-Duverney asked Beaumarchais to enlist the aid of
Mesdames Royales in securing the support of Louis XV for the Ecole
Militaire, of which the financier was a director; Pierre suc- ceeded in
this, and Paris-Duverney gave him stocks worth sixty thousand francs.
“He initiated me,” said Beaumarchais, “into the secrets of finance…. I
commenced making my fortune under his direction; by his advice I
undertook several speculations, in some of which he assisted me with his
money or his name.” 110 So Beaumarchais, following in this as in so
many</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ONTHEEVE 92 1</p>
<p>other ways the precedents set by Voltaire, became a millionaire
philosopher. By 1871 he was rich enough to buy one of the titular
secretaryships to the king, which brought him a title of nobility. He
took a fine house in the Rue de Conde, and installed in it his proud
father and sisters.</p>
<p>Two other sisters were living in Madrid — one married, the other,
Lisette, engaged to Jose Clavigo y Fajardo, editor and author, who for
six years repeatedly postponed the marriage. In May, 1764, Beaumarchais
began a long ride by stagecoach, day and night, to the Spanish capital.
He found Clavigo, who promised to marry Lisette soon, but then eluded
Beaumarchais by moving from place to place. Pierre finally caught up
with him, and de- manded his signature for a contract of marriage; Jose
excused himself on the ground that he had just taken a purgative, and
Spanish law held invalid any contract signed by a person in such a
condition. Beaumarchais threatened him; Clavigo set the forces of
government against him; the clever French- man was defeated by manana.
Abandoning that chase, he took up the pur- suit of business and
organized several companies, one for supplying Negro slaves to Spanish
colonies. (He forgot that only a year earlier he had written a poem
condemning slavery. 111 ) All these plans foundered on the Spanish gift
for procrastination. Meanwhile, however, Pierre enjoyed good company and
a titled mistress, and learned enough about Spanish manners to write his
plays about a barber of Seville. Lisette found another lover, and Beau-
marchais returned to France with nothing gained but experience. He com-
posed fascinating memoirs of his trip, from which, as we have seen,
Goethe made a drama, Clavigo (1775).</p>
<p>In 1770 Paris-Duverney died, after making a will acknowledging that
he owed Beaumarchais fifteen thousand francs. The chief heir, the Comte
de La Blache, contested this clause as a forgery. The matter was
referred to the Paris Parlement, which appointed Councilor Louis-
Valentin Goezman to pass on it. At this juncture Beaumarchais was in
jail as a result of a violent fracas with the Due de Chaulnes about a
mistress. Temporarily released, he sent a “present” of a hundred louis
d’or, and a diamond -studded watch, to Mme. Goezman as inducements to
get him a hearing before her husband; she asked an additional fifteen
louis d’or for a “secretary”; he sent them. He secured the interview;
the Councilor decided against him; Mme. Goezman returned all but the
fifteen louis d’or; Beaumarchais insisted on her returning these too;
Goezman charged him with bribery. Pierre put the matter before the
public in a series of Memoirs so vivacious and witty that they won him
wide acclaim as a brilliant debater if not quite an honest man. Voltaire
said of them: “I have never seen anything stronger, bolder, funnier,
more inter - esting, more humiliating for his foes. He fights a dozen of
them at a time, and mows them down.” 112 The Parlement ruled against his
claim to the in - heritance (April 6, 1773), in effect charged him with
forgery, and con- demned him to pay 56,300 livres in damages and
debts.</p>
<p>Released from jail (Afay 8, 1773), Beaumarchais engaged himself to
Louis XV as a secret agent on a mission to England to prevent the
circulation of a scandalous pamphlet against Mme. du Barry. He
succeeded, and continued</p>
<p>922 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>in secret service under Louis XVI, who commissioned him to return to
Lon- don and bribe Guglielmo Angelucci to refrain from publishing a
pamphlet against Marie Antoinette. Angelucci surrendered the manuscript
for 35,000 francs and departed for Nuremberg; Beaumarchais, suspecting
him to have another copy, pursued him through Germany, caught up with
him near Neustadt, and forced him to surrender the copy. Two brigands
attacked him; he fought them off, was wounded, made his way to Vienna,
was ar- rested as a spy, spent a month in jail, was freed, and rode back
to France.</p>
<p>His next exploit has more right to a place in history. In 1775
Vergennes sent him to London to report on the growing crisis between
England and America. In September Beaumarchais dispatched to Louis XVI a
report predicting the success of the American revolt, and emphasizing
the pro- American minority in England. On February 29, 1776, he
addressed to the King another letter, recommending secret French aid to
America, on the ground that France could protect herself from subjection
only by weaken- ing England. 113 Vergennes concurred with this view,
and, as we have seen, arranged to finance Beaumarchais in providing war
materials to the English colonies. Beaumarchais gave himself
wholeheartedly to the enterprise. He organized the firm of Rodrigue
Hortalez and Company, and went from one French port to another, buying
and equipping ships, loading them with pro- visions and weapons,
recruiting experienced French officers for the Ameri- can army, and
spending (he claimed) several million livres of his own in addition to
the two million supplied him by the French and Spanish govern- ments.
Silas Deane reported to the American Congress (November 29,</p>
<ol start="1776" type="1">
<li>: “I should never have completed my mission but for the generous, in
- defatigable, and intelligent exertion of M. de Beaumarchais, to whom
the United States are, on every account, more indebted than to any other
person on this side of the ocean.” 114 At the end of the war Silas Deane
calculated that America owed Beaumarchais 3,600,000 francs. The
Congress, having assumed that all the material was a gift from allies,
rejected the claim, but in 1835 it paid 80 0,000 livres to Beaumarchais’
heirs.</li>
</ol>
<p>During this feverish activity he found time to write more memorials,
ad- dressed to the public, protesting the decree of Parlement of April
6, 1773. On September 6, 1776, that decree was annulled, and all of
Beaumar chais’ civil rights were restored. In July, 1778, a court at
Aix-en-Provence ruled</p>
<p>in his favor in the matter of Paris- Duverney’s will, and
Beaumarchais could feel that at last he had cleared his name.</p>
<p>All his enterprises in love, war, business, and law were not enough
for Beaumarchais. There was a world of words, ideas, and print not yet
quite conquered. In 1767 he offered to the Comedie-F ran^aise his first
play, Eu- genie; it was presented on January 29, 1769, was well received
by the aud- ience, but was rejected by the critics. Another play, Les
Deux Amis (Jan- uary 13, 1770), failed despite the customary
preparation; “I had filled the pit with the most excellent workers, with
hands like paddles, but the efforts of the cabal” prevailed against him.
115 The literary confraternity, led by Freron, opposed him as an
intruder, a jailbird turned dramatist, just as the court at</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>9 2 3</p>
<p>Versailles was against him as a watchmaker turned noble. So, in his
next play, he made Figaro describe “the republic of letters” as “the
republic of wolves, continually at one another’s throats;… all the
insects, gnats, mosquitoes, and critics, all the envious journalists,
booksellers, censors.” 116</p>
<p>On the stage, as in life, Beaumarchais encountered a swarm of
enemies, and defeated them all. In the most creative moment of his
multiform genius he conceived Figaro: barber, surgeon, philosopher,
dressed in satin vest and breeches, his guitar slung over his shoulder,
his quick mind ready to resolve any difficulty, his wit piercing the
cant, pretenses, and injustices of his time. In one sense Figaro was not
a creation, being a new name and form for the stock figure of the clever
servant in Greek and Roman comedy, in the Commedia dell’ Arte of Italy,
in Moliere’s Sganarelle; but as we know him all but the music is
Beaumarchais’. Even the music was originally his; he first composed Le
Barbier de Seville as a comic opera, which he presented to the
Comedie-Italienne in 1772; it was rejected, but Mozart became ac-
quainted with this music while he was in Paris. 117 Beaumarchais
remodeled the opera into a comedy; this was accepted by the Comedie-F
rangaise, and was scheduled for production when the author’s
imprisonment (February 24, 1773) compelled a postponement. On his
release it was again prepared for presentation, but was adjourned
because the author was under indict- ment by the Parlement. The success
of Beaumarchais’ public self -defense in his Memoirs led the theater
again to plan the production; it was announced for February 12, 1774;
“all the boxes,” Grimm reported, “were sold up to the fifth
performance.” 118 At the last moment the government forbade the play on
the ground that it might prejudice the case still pending in the
Parlement.</p>
<p>Another year passed; a new King came, whom Beaumarchais served val-
iantly at the repeated risk of his life; permission was given; and on
February 23, 1775, The Barber of Seville finally reached the stage. It
did not go well; it was too long; and the preliminary excitement had led
the audience to expect too much. In one day Beaumarchais revised and
shortened it in a chef- d’oeuvre of surgery; the comedy was cleared from
confusing complication s, the wit was freed from excessive discourse; as
Beaumarchais put it, he re- moved the fifth wheel from the carriage. On
the second evening the play was a triumph. Mme. du Deffand, who was
there, described it as “an ex - travagant success,… applau ded beyond
all bounds.” 119</p>
<p>The Prince de Conti challenged Beaumarchais to write a continuation
play which would show Figaro as a more developed character. The author
was now absorbed in his role as savior of America, but when that had
been accomplished he returned to the stage and produced a comedy that
made more dramatic history than even the Tartuffe of Moliere. In The
Marriage of Figaro the Count Alma viva and the Rosina of The Barber of
Seville have lived through several years of marriage; he has already
tired of the charms that lured him through so many complications; his
present enterprise is to seduce Suzanne, maid to his Countess and
affianced to Figaro, who has be- come premier valet to the Count and
major-domo of the chateau. Cherubin,</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>924</p>
<p>a thirteen-year-old page, provides a graceful obbligato to the
central theme by his calf love for the Countess, who is twice his age.
Figaro has become a philosopher; Beaumarchais describes h im as “la
raison assaisoimee de gaiete et de saillies”— reason seasoned with
gaiety and sallies 120 — which is almost a definition of the esprit
gaulois, and of the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>“I was born to be a courtier,” he tells Suzanne; and when she
supposes this “is a difficult art,” he replies, “Not at all. To receive,
to take, to ask— behold the secret in three words.” 121 And in the
soliloquy which Rossini has made to resound throughout the world, he
addresses the nobles of Spain (and France) with almost revolutionary
scorn: “What have you done for so much good fortune? You gave yourselves
the trouble to be born, and nothing more; for the rest you are
sufficiently ordinary! While I, lost in the common crowd, have had to
use more science and calculation merely to sub- sist than have gone into
governing all Spain these hundred years past.” 122 He laughs at soldiers
who “kill and get themselves killed for interests quite un - known to
them. As for me, I want to know why I am furio us.” 123 Even the human
race gets its comeuppance: “To drink without being thirsty, and to make
love at all seasons — this alone distinguishes us from other animals.”
124 There were miscellaneous strokes against the sale of public offices,
the arbi- trary power of ministers, the miscarriages of justice, the
condition of prisons, the censorship and persecution of thought.
“Provided in my writings I men - tion neither the authorities nor the
state religion, nor politics, nor morals, nor the officials, nor
finances, nor the opera, nor… any person of conse- quence, I may print
whatever I like, subject to inspection by two or three censors.” 125 A
passage which the actors deleted, perhaps as coming too close to their
own recreations, accused the male sex as responsible for prostitu- tion:
men by their demands create the supply, and by their laws punish the
women who meet the demand. 126 The plot itself did not merely show the
servant cleverer than his master — this was too traditional to offend —
but it revealed the noble count as an arrant adulterer.</p>
<p>The Marriage of Figaro was accepted by the Comedie-Frangaise in 1781,
but it could not be produced till 1784. When it was read to Louis XVI he
bore with tolerant humor the incidental satire, but when he heard the
soliloquy, with derision of the nobility and the censorship, he felt
that he could not allow these basic institutions to be publicly abused.
“This is de - testable,” he exclaimed; “it must never be played. To
allow its representa - tion would be equivalent to destroying the
Bastille. This man laughs at ev- erything that ought to be respected in
a government.” 127 He forbade the staging of the piece.</p>
<p>Beaumarchais read parts of the play in private homes. Curiosity was
aroused. Some courtiers arranged that it be performed before the court;
but at the last minute this too was prohibited. At last the King yielded
to protests and requests, and agreed to sanction public performances
after careful ex- purgation of the text by censors. The premiere (April
27, 1784) was an historic event. All Paris seemed bent on attending the
first night. Nobles fought with commoners for admission; iron gates were
broken down, doors</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>ON THE EVE</p>
<p>9 2 5</p>
<p>were smashed, three persons were suffocated. Beaumarchais was there,
happy in the fracas. The success was so great that the play was
performed sixty times running, nearly always to a full house. The
receipts were unprece- dented. Beaumarchais gave all of his share —
41,999 livres — to charity. 128</p>
<p>History has thought of The Marriage of Figaro as a harbinger of
revolu- tion; Napoleon described it as “the Revolution already in
action.” 129 Some of its lines entered into the ferment of the time. In
the preface later attached to the published play Beaumarchais denied any
revolutionary intent, and he quoted from his writings passages in
defense of monarchy and aristocracy. He asked not for the destruction of
existing institutions but for the removal of abuses attached to them;
for equal justice to all classes, for greater free- dom of thought and
press, for protection of the individual against lettres de cachet and
other excesses of monarchical power. Like, his idol, Voltaire, he
rejected revolution as an invitation to chaos and the mob.</p>
<p>Through all the varied turbulence that enveloped him he continued to
study the works of Voltaire. He recognized the similarities, though
perhaps not the distance, between himself and the patriarch: the same
combination of feverish intellectual activity with canny financial
skill, the same scorn of scruples and of moral delicacy, the same
courage in fighting injustice and adversity. He resolved to preserve and
disseminate the works of Voltaire in a collected and complete edition.
He knew that this could not be done in France, where many of Voltaire’s
writings were prohibited. He went to Maurepas and told him that
Catherine II had proposed to bring out a French edition in
St. Petersburg; he argued that this would be a disgrace to France; the
minister saw the point, and promised to allow the circulation of a com-
plete edition. Charles-Joseph Pancoucke, a Paris bookseller, had secured
the rights to Voltaire’s unpublished manuscripts; Beaumarchais bought
these for 160,000 francs. He collected all the published works of
Voltaire that he could find. He imported Baskerville type from England,
and purchased paper mills in the Vosges. He secured Condorcet as an
editor and biographer. He leased an old fort at Kehl, across the Rhine
from Strasbourg, installed presses, and, despite a thousand
tribulations, brought out two editions, one in seventy volumes octavo,
the other in ninety-two volumes duodecimo (1783-90). This was the
largest publishing enterprise yet attempted in Eu- rope, not excepting
the Ency elope die. Expecting a ready sale, Beaumarchais printed fifteen
thousand sets; he sold only two thousand, partly because of campaigns
against the enterprise by the Parlement and the clergy, 130 partly
because of the political turmoil of 1788-90, and partly because the
instabil- ity of personal fortunes deterred individuals from buying so
expensive a set. Beaumarchais claimed to have lost a million livres in
the venture. However, he produced also an edition of Rousseau.</p>
<p>The Revolution which he had helped to prepare proved a misfortune for
him. In 1789 he built for himself and his third wife a costly mansion
opposite the Bastille; he filled it with fine furniture and art, and
surrounded it with two acres of land. The mobs that repeatedly rioted in
the area looked askance at such luxury; twice his house was invaded, and

<p>deaf and prematurely old, was threatened as an aristocrat. He sent a
petition to the Commune of Paris professing his faith in the Revolution;
nevertheless he was arrested (August 23, 1792); though soon set free, he
lived in daily fear of assassination. Then the wheel of fortune turned,
and he was com- missioned by the Revolutionary government (1792) to go
to Holland and buy guns for the republic. The negotiations failed; and
during his absence his property was seized, and his wife and daughter
were arrested (July 5, 1794). He rushed back to Paris, secured their
release, and was allowed to recover his property. He lived three years
more, broken in body but not in spirit, and hailed the rise of Napoleon.
He died on May 18, 1799, of an apoplectic stroke, at the age of
sixty-seven. Seldom even in French history had a man led so full and
varied and adventurous a life.</p>
