Friars</h4>
<p>1095-1300</p>
<p>I. THE MONASTIC LIFE</p>
<p>I T may be that the Church was saved not by the tortures of the
Inquisition but by the rise of new monastic orders that took out of the
mouths of heretics the gospel of evangelical poverty, and for a century
gave to the older monastic orders, and to the secular clergy, a
cleansing example of sin- cerity.</p>
<p>The monasteries had multiplied during the Dark Ages, reaching a peak
in the troubled nadir of the tenth century, and then declining in number
as secular order and prosperity grew. In France, about 1100, there were
543; about 1250 there were 287; 1 possibly this loss in the number of
abbeys was compensated by a rise in their average membership, but very
few monas- teries had a hundred monks. 2 It was still a custom in the
thirteenth century for pious or burdened parents to commit children of
seven years or older to monasteries as oblates — “offered up” to God;
St. Thomas Aquinas began his monastic career so. The Benedictine order
considered the vows taken for an oblate by his parents as irrevocable; 3
St. Bernard and the new orders held that the oblate, on reaching
maturity, might without reproach return to the world. 4 Generally an
adult monk required a papal dispensation if he wished, without sin, to
renounce his vows.</p>
<p>Before 1098 most Western monasteries followed, with variable
fidelity, some form of the Benedictine rule. A year of novitiate was
prescribed, dur- ing which the candidate might freely withdraw. One
knight drew back, says the monk Caesarius of Heisterbach, “on the
cowardly plea that he feared the vermin of the [monastic] garment; for
our woolen clothing harbors much vermin.” 5 Prayer occupied some four
hours of the monk’s day; meals were brief, and usually vegetarian; the
remainder of the day was given to labor, reading, teaching, hospital
work, charity, and rest. Caesarius tells how his monast ery, in the
famine of 1197, gave as many as 1500 “doles” of food in a day, and “kept
alive till harvest time all the poor who came to us.” 6 In the same
crisis a Cistercian abbey in Westphalia slaughtered all its flocks and
herds, and pawned its books and sacred vessels, to feed the poor. 7
Through their own labor and that of their serfs, the monks built abbeys,
churches, and cathedrals, farmed great manors, subdued marshes and
jungles</p>
<p>785</p>
<p>786 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xo tillage, practiced a hundred handicrafts, and brewed excellent
wines and ales. Though the monastery seemed to take many good and able
men from the world to bury them in a selfish sanctity, it trained
thousands of them in mental and moral discipline, and then returned them
to the world to serve as councilors and administrators to bishops,
popes, and kings.*</p>
<p>In the course of time the growing wealth of the communities
overflowed into the monasteries, and the generosity of the people
financed the occasional luxury of the monks. The abbey of St. Riquier
was not among the richest; yet it had 1 17 vassals, owned 2500 houses in
the town where it was placed, and received from its tenants yearly
10,000 chickens, 10,000 capons, 75,000 eggs… and a money rent
individually reasonable, cumulatively great. 8 Much richer were the
monasteries of Monte Cassino, Cluny, Fulda, St. Gall, St. Denis. Abbots
like Suger of St. Denis, Peter the Venerable of Cluny, or even Samson of
Bury St. Edmund’s, were mighty lords controlling immen se material
wealth and social or political power. Suger, after feeding his monks and
building a majestic cathedral, had enough resources left to half-finance
a crusade. 9 It was probably of Suger that St. Bernard wrote: “I lie if
I have not seen an abb ot riding with a train of sixty horses and more”;
10 but Suger was prime minister, and had to clothe himself in pomp to
impress the popu- lace; he himself lived with austere simplicity in a
humble cell, observing all the rules of his order so far as his public
duties would allow. Peter the Ven- erable was a good man, but he failed,
despite repeated efforts, to check the progress of the Cluniac
monasteries — once the leaders of reform — toward a corporate wealth
that enabled the monies, while owning nothing, to live in a degenerative
idleness.</p>
<p>Morals fall as riches rise, and nature will out according to men’s
means. In any large group certain individuals will be found whose
instincts are stronger than their vows. While the majority of monks
remained reasonably loyal to their rule, a minority took an easier view
toward the world and the flesh. In many cases the abbot had been
appointed by some lord or king, usually from a rank accustomed to
comfort; such abbots were above monastic rules; they enjoyed hunting,
hawking, tournaments, and politics; and their example in- fected the
monks. Giraldus Cambrensis paints a merry picture of the abbot of
Evesham: “None was safe from his lust”; the neighborhood reckoned his
offspring at eighteen; finally he had to be deposed. 11 Worldly abbots,
fat and rich and powerful, became a target of public humor and literary
diatribe. The most merciless and incredible satire in medieval
literature is a descrip-</p>
<ul>
<li>Said a great scholar not usually tender to the faults of the Church:
“The vulgar charge frequently made that medieval monks were gluttonous,
wasteful, extravagant, and profligate is belied by the hundreds of
cartularies, or inventories, which have been preserved, and which show
care, intelligence, and honesty in management. The enormous economic
betterment of medieval Europe which the monks achieved proves them as a
whole to have been intelligent landlords and agriculturalists.”—
Thompson, Economic and Social History of the Middle Ages , &lt;630. “The
most perfect and efficacious works of Christianity,” said the skeptical
Renan, “were</li>

<p>ion of an abbot by Walter Map. 12 Some cloisters were known for their
fine food and wines. We should not grudge the monks a little good cheer,
and we can understand how weary they were of vegetables, how they longed
for meat; we can sympathize with their occasional gossiping, quarreling,
and sleeping at Mass. 13</p>
<p>The monks, in vowing celibacy, had underestimated the power of a
sexual instinct repeatedly stirred by secular example and sights.
Caesarius of Heis- terbach tells a story, often repeated in the Middle
Ages, of an abbot and a young monk riding out together. The youth saw
women for the first time. “What are they?” he asked. “They be demons,”
said the abbot. “I thought,” said the monk, “that they were the fairest
things that ever I saw.” 14 Said the ascetic Peter Damian, nearing the
end of a saintly but acerbic life:</p>
<p>I, who am now an old man, may safely look upon the seared, and</p>
<p>wrinkled visage of a blear-eyed crone. Yet from sight of the more</p>
<p>comely and adorned I guard my eyes like boys from fire. Alas,</p>
<p>my wretched heart! — which cannot hold scriptural mysteries read</p>
<p>hrough a hundred times, and will not lose the memory of a form seen
but once. 15</p>
<p>To some monks virtue seemed a contest for their souls between woman
and Christ; their denunciation of woman was an effort to deaden
themselves to her charms; their pious dreams were sometimes softened
with the dews of desire; and their saintly visions often borrowed the
terms of human love. 16 Ovid was a welcome friend in some monasteries,
and not least thumbed were his manuals of the amorous art. 17 The
sculptures of certain cathedrals, the carvings of their furniture, even
the paintings in some missals, portrayed riotous monks and nuns — pigs
dressed as monks, monastic robes bulging over erect phalli, nuns
sporting with devils. 18 A relief on the Portal of the Judg- ment at
Reims shows a devil dragging condemned men to hell; among them is a
mitered bishop. Medieval ecclesiastics — perhaps seculars envying
regulars — allowed such caricatures to remain in place; modern churchmen
thought it better to have most of them removed. The Church herself was
the severest critic of her sinning members; a noble succession of
ecclesiastical reformers labored to bring monks and abbots back to the
ideals of Christ.</p>

<p>At the end of the eleventh century, simultaneously with the
purification of the papacy and the fervor of the First Crusade, a
movement of self-reform swept through Christendom, immensely improved
the secular clergy, and founded new monastic orders dedicated to the
full rigor of the Augustinian or Benedictine rule. At an unknown date
before 1039 St. John Gualbertus 19 established the order of Vallombrosa
in the “shady valley” of that name in</p>
<p>788 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XItaly, and inaugurated in it the institution of lay brothers later
developed by the mendicant orders. The Roman Synod of 1059 exhorted
canons — clergy- men sharing the labors and revenues of a cathedral — to
live in community and hold all their property in common, like the
apostles. Some were reluctant, and remained “secular canons”; many
responded, adopted a monastic rule that they ascribed to St. Augustine,
and formed semimonastic communities collectively known as Augustinian or
Austin Canons.* In 1084 St. Bruno of Cologne, having declined the
archbishopric of Reims, founded the Car- thusian order by establishing a
monastery at a desolate spot named Char- treuse, in the Alps near
Grenoble; other pious men, sick of worldly strife and clerical laxity,
formed similar Carthusian units in secluded places. Each monk worked,
ate, and slept in his own separate cell, lived on bread and milk, wore
garments of horsehair, and practiced almost perpetual silence. Three
times a week they came together for Mass, vespers, and midnight prayers;
and on Sundays and holydays they indulged themselves in conversation and
a com- mon meal. Of all the monastic orders this was the most austere,
and has kept most faithfully, through eight centuries, to its original
rule.</p>
<p>In 1 098 Robert of Molesmes, tired of trying to reform the various
Benedic- tine monasteries of which he had been prior, built a new
monastic house at a wild point called Citeaux near Dijon; and as
Chartreuse named the Car- thusians, so Citeaux named the Cistercian
monks. The third abbot of Citeaux, Stephen Harding of Dorsetshire,
reorganized and expanded the monastery, opened branches of it, and drew
up the Carta caritatis, or Charter of Love, to insure the peaceful
federal co-operation of the Cistercian houses with Citeaux. The
Benedictine rule was restored in full severity: absolute poverty was
essential, all flesh food was to be avoided, learning was to be
discouraged, verse-making was forbidden, and all splendor of religious
vestment, vessel, or building was to be shunned. Every physically able
monk was to join in manual labor in gardens and workshops that would
make the monastery in- dependent of the outside world, and give no
excuse for any monk to leave the grounds. The Cistercians outshone all
other groups, monastic or secular, in agricultural energy and skill;
they set up new centers of their order in unsettled regions, subdued
marshes, jungles, and forests to cultivation, and played a leading part
in colonizing eastern Germany, and in repairing the damage that William
the Conqueror had done in northern England. In this magnificent labor of
civilization the Cistercian monks were aided by lay brothers — conversi
— vowed to celibacy, silence, and illiteracy, 20 and working as farmers
or servants in return for shelter, clothing, and food. 21</p>
<p>These austerities frightened potential novices; the little band grew
slowly, and the new order might have died in infancy had not fresh ardor
come to it in the person of St. Bernard. Born near Dijon (1091) of a

<p>he became a shy and pious youth, loving solitude. Finding the secular
world an uncomfortable place, he determined to enter a monastery. But,
as if de- siring companionship in solitude, he made effective propaganda
among his relatives and friends to enter Citeaux with him; mothers and
nubile girls, we are told, trembled at his approach, fearing that he
would lure their sons or lovers into chastity. Despite their tears and
charms he succeeded; and when he was admitted to Citeaux ( 1 1 1 3) he
brought with him a band of twenty- nine candidates, including brothers,
an uncle, and friends. Later he persuaded his mother and sister to
become nuns, and his father a monk, on the promise that “unless thou do
penance thou shalt burn forever… and send forth smoke and stench.”
22</p>
<p>Stephen Harding came presently to such admiration for Bernard’s piety
and energy that he sent him forth ( 1 1 1 5) as abbot, with twelve other
monks, to found a new Cistercian house. Bernard chose a heavily wooded
spot, ninety miles from Citeaux, known as Clara vallis. Bright Valley,
Clairvaux. There was no habitation there, and no human life. The initial
task of the fraternal band was to build with their own hands their first
“monastery”— a wooden building containing under one roof a chapel, a
refectory, and a dormitory loft reached by a ladder; the beds were bins
strewn with leaves; the windows were no larger than a man’s head; the
floor was the earth. Diet was vegetarian</p>
<p>He was a man of moderate intellect, of strong conviction, of immense
force and unity of character. He cared nothing for science or
philosophy. The mind of man, he felt, was too infinitesimal a portion of
the universe to</p>

<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xsit in judgment upon it or pretend to understand it. He marveled at
the silly pride of philosophers prating about the nature, origin, and
destiny of the cosmos. He was shock ed by Abelard’s proposal to submit
faith to reason, and he fought that rationalism as a blasphemous
impudence. Instead of try- ing to understand the universe he preferred
to walk unquestioning and grate- ful in the miracle of revelation. He
accepted the Bible as God’s word, for otherwise, it seemed to him, life
would be a desert of dark uncertainty. The more he preached that
childlike faith the more surely he felt it to be the Way. When one of
his monks, in terror, confessed to him that he could not believe in the
power of the priest to change the bread of the Eucharist into the body
and blood of Christ, Bernard did not reprove him; he bade him receive
the sacrament nevertheless; “go and communicate with my faith”; and we
are</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIX) MONKS AND FRIARS 791</p>
<p>Despite his flair for graceful speech he cared little for any but
spiritual beauty. He covered his eyes lest they take too sensual a
delight from the lakes of Switzerland. 29 His abbey was bare of all
ornament except the crucified Christ. He berated Cluny for spending so
much on the architecture and adornment of its abbeys. “The church,” he
said, “is resplendent in its walls and wholly lacking in its poor. It
gilds its stones and leaves its children naked. With the silver of the
wretched it charms the eyes of the rich.” 30 He com - plained that the
great abbey of St. Denis was crowded with proud and armored knights
instead of simple worshipers; he called it “a garrison, a school of
Satan, a den of thieves.” 31 Suger, humbly moved by these stric - tures,
reformed the customs of his church and his monks, and lived to earn
Bernard’s praise.</p>
<p>The monastic reform that radiated from Clairvaux, and the improvement
of the hierarchy through the elevation of Bernard’s monks to bishoprics
and archbishoprics, were but a part of the influence which this
astonishing man, who asked nothing but bread, wielded on all ranks in
his half century. Henry of France, brother of the king, came to visit
him; Bernard spoke to him; on that day Henry became a monk, and washed
the dishes at Clairvaux. 32 Through his sermons — themselves so eloquent
and sensuous as to verge on poetry — he moved all who heard him; through
his letters — masterpieces of passionate pleading — he influenced
councils, bishops, popes, kings; through personal contacts he molded the
policies of Church and state. He refused to be more than an abbot, but
he made and unmade popes, and no pontiff was heard with greater respect
or reverence. He left his cell on a dozen errands of high diplomacy,
usually at the call of the Church. When contending groups chose
Anacletus II and Innocent II as rival popes (1130), Bernard supported
Innocent; when Anacletus captured Rome Bernard entered Italy, and by the
pure power of his personality and his speech roused the Lombard cities
for Innocent; the crowds, drunk with his oratory and his sanctity,
kissed his feet and tore his garments to pieces as sacred relics for
their pos- terity. The sick came to him at Milan, and epileptics,
paralytics, and othe.’ ailing faithful announced that they had been
cured by his touch. On his re turn to Clairvaux from his diplomatic
triumphs the peasants would come in from the fields, and the shepherds
down from the hills, to ask his blessing; and receiving it they would
return to their toil uplifted and content.</p>
<p>When Bernard died in 1153 the number of Cistercian houses had risen
from 30 in 1 134 (the year of Stephen Harding’s death) to 343. The fame
of his sanctity and his power brought many converts to the new order; by
1 300 it had 60,000 monks in 693 monasteries. Other monastic orders took
form in the twelfth century. About 1 1 00 Robert of Arbrissol founded
the order of Fonteviault in Anjou; in 1120 St. Norbert gave up a rich
inheritance to es- tablish the Premonstratensian order of Canons Regular
at Premontre near</p>
<p>79 2 the age of faith (chap. XXI</p>
<p>XLaon; in 1131 St. Gilbert constituted the English order of
Sempringham — the Gilbertines — on the model of Fontevrault. About 1150
some Palestinian anchorites adopted the eremitical rule of St. Basil,
and spread throughout Palestine; when the Moslems captured the Holy Land
these “Carmelites” migrated to Cyprus, Sicily, France, and England. In
1198 Innocent III ap- proved the articles of the order of Trinitarians,
and dedicated it to the ran- soming of Christians captured by Saracens.
These new orders were a saving and uplifting leaven in the Christian
Church.</p>
<p>The burst of monastic reform climaxed by Bernard died down as the
twelfth century advanced. The younger orders kept their arduous rules
with reasonable fidelity; but not many men could be found, in that
dynamic pe- riod, to bear so strict a regimen. In time the Cistercians —
even at Bernard’s Clairvaux — became rich through hopeful gifts;
endowments for “pittances” enabled the monks to add meat to their diet,
and plenty of wine; 33 they delegated all manual labor to lay brothers;
f our years after Bernard’s death they bought a supply of Saracen
slaves; 34 they developed a large and prof- itable trade in the products
of their socialistic industry, and aroused guild animosity through their
exemption from transportation tolls. 35 The decline of faith as the
Crusades failed reduced the number of novices, and disturbed the morale
of all the monastic orders. But the old ideal of living like the apos -
tles in a propertyless communism did not die; the conviction that the
true Christian must shun wealth and power, and be a man of unflinching
peace, lingered in thousands of souls. At the opening of the thirteenth
century a man appeared, in the Umbrian hills of Italy, who brought these
old ideals to vigor again by such a life of simplicity, purity, piety,
and love that men won- dered had Christ been born again.</p>

There Pietro had fallen in love with a French girl, Pica, and he had
brought her back to Assisi as his wife. When he returned from another
trip to Pro- vence, and found that a son had been born to him, he
changed the child’s name to Francesco, Francis, apparently as a tribute
to Pica. The boy grew up in one of the loveliest regions of Italy, and
never lost his affection for the Um- brian landscape and sky. He learned
Italian and French from his parents, and Latin from the parish priest;
he had no further formal schooling, but</p>
<p>The literature on Francis is partly history, partly legend. As the
legends are among the masterpieces of medieval literature, some of them
are included in the following pages, with a warning in each instance.

<p>soon entered his father’s business. He disappointed Ser Pietr o by
showing more facility in spending money than in making it. He was the
richest youth in town, and the most generous; friends flocked about him,
ate and drank with him, and sang with him the songs of the troubadours;
Francis wore, now and then, a parti- colored minstrel’s suit. 36 He was
a good -looking boy, with black eyes and hair and kindly face, and a
melodious voice. His early biographers protest that he had no relations
with the other sex, and, indeed, knew only two women by sight; 37 but
this surely does Francis some in- justice. Possibly, in those formative
years, he heard from his father about the Albigensian and Waldensian
heretics of southern France, and their new-old gospel of evangelical
poverty.</p>
<p>In 1 202 he fought in the Assisian army against Perugia, was made
prisoner, and spent a year in meditative captivity. In 1204 he joined as
a volunteer the army of Pope Innocent III. At Spoleto, lying in bed with
a fever, he thought he heard a voice asking him: “Why do you desert the
Lord for the servant, the Prince for his vassal?” “Lord,” he asked,
“what do you wish me to do?” The voice answered, “Go back to your home;
there it shall be told you what you are to do.” 38 He left the army and
returned to Assisi. Now he showed ever less i nterest in his father’s
business, ever more in religion. Near Assisi was a poor chapel of
St. Damian. Praying there in February, 1 207, Francis thought he heard
Christ speak to him from the altar, accepting his life and soul as an
oblation. From that moment he felt himself dedicated to a new life. He
gave the chapel priest all the money he had with him, and went home. One
day he met a leper, and turned away in revulsion. Rebuking himself for
unfaithfulness to Christ, he went back, emptied his purse in to the
leper’s hand, and kissed the hand; this act, he tells us, marked an era
in his spiritual life. 30 Thereafter he frequently visited the dwellings
of the lepers, and brought them alms.</p>
<p>Shortly after this experience he spent several days in or near the
chapel, apparently eating little; when he appeared again in Assisi he
was so thin, haggard, and pale, and his clothes so tattered, his mind so
bewildered, that the urchins in the public square cried out, Pazzo!
Pazzo ! —“ A madman! A madman!” Ther e his father found him, called him
a half-wit, dragged him home, and locked him in a closet. Freed by his
mother, Francis hurried back to the chapel. The angry father overtook
him, upbraided him for making his family a public jest, reproached him
for making so little return on the money spent in his rearing, and bade
him leave the town. Francis had sold his per- sonal belongings to
support the chapel; he handed the proceeds to his father, who accepted
them; but he would not recognize the authority of his father to command
one who now belonged to Christ. Summoned before the tri- bunal of the
bishop in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore, he presented himself humbly,
while a crowd looked on in a scene made memorable by Giotto’s brush. The
bishop took him at his word, and bade him give up all his prop-</p>

<p>Xerty. Francis retired to a room in the episcopal palace, and soon
reappeared stark naked; he laid his bundled clothing and a few remaining
coins before the bis hop, and said: “Until this time I have called
Pietro Bernadone my father, but now I desire to serve God. That is why I
return to him this money… as well as my clothing, and all that I have
had from him; for henceforth I desire to say nothing else tha n ’Our
Father, Who art in</p>
<p>heaven.’ ” 40 Bernadone carried off the clothing, while the bishop
covered the shivering Francis with his mantle. Francis returned to
St. Damian’s, made himself a hermit’s robe, begged his food from door to
door, and with his hands began to rebuild the crumbling chapel. Several
of the townspeople came to aid him, and they sang together as they
worked.</p>
<p>In February, 1209, as he was hearing Mass, he was struck by the words
which the priest read from the instructions of Jesus to the
apostles:</p>
<p>And as ye go, preach, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</p>
<p>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils.
Freely ye have received, freely give. Provide neither gold nor silver
nor brass in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats,
neither shoes, nor a staff. (Matt, x, 7-10.)</p>
<p>It seemed to Francis that Christ Himself was speaking, and directly
to him. He resolved to obey those words literally — to preach the
kingdom of heaven, and possess nothing. He would go back across the 1
200 years that had ob- scured the figure of Christ, and would rebuild
his life on that divine exem- plar.</p>
<p>So, that spring, braving all ridicule, he stood in the squares of
Assisi and nearby towns and preached the gospel of poverty and Christ.
Revolted by the unscrupulous pursuit of wealth that marked the age, and
shocked by the splendor and luxury of some clergymen, he denounced money
itself as a devil and a curse, bade his followers despise it as dung, 41
and called upon men and women to sell all that they had, and give to the
poor. Small audiences listened to him in wonder and admiration, but most
men passed him by as a fool in Christ. The good bishop of Assisi
protested, “Your way of living without owni ng anything seems to me very
harsh and difficult”; to which Francis replied, “My lord, if we
possessed property we should need arms to defend it.” 42 Some hearts
were moved; twelve men offered to follow his doctrine and his way; he
welcomed them, and gave them the above-quoted words of Christ as their
commission and their rule. They made themselves brown robes, and built
themselves cabins of branches and boughs. Daily they and Francis,
rejecting the old monastic isolation, went forth, barefoot and
penniless, to preach. Sometimes they would be absent for several days,
and sleep in haylofts, or leper hospitals, or under the porch of a
church. When they returned, Francis would wash their feet and give them
food.</p>
<p>They greeted one another, and all whom they met on the road, with
the</p>
<p>MONKS AND FRIARS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>795</p>
<p>ancient Oriental salutation: “The Lord give thee peace.” They were
not yet named Franciscans. They called themselves Fratres minor es,
Friars Minor, or Minorites; friars as meaning brothers rather than
priests, minor as being the least of Christ’s servants, and never
wielding, but always under, superior authority; they were to hold
themselves subordinate to even the lowliest priest, and to kiss the hand
of any priest they met. Very few of them, in this first generation of
the order, were ordained; Francis himself was never more than deacon. In
their own little community they served one another, and did manual work;
and no idler was long tolerated in the group. Intellectual study was
discouraged; Francis saw no advantage in secular knowledge except for
the accumulation of wealth or the pursuit of power; “my brethren who are
led by desire of learning will find their hands empty in the day of
tribula- tion.” 43 He scorned h istorians, who perform no great deed
themselves, but receive honors for recording the great deeds of others.
44 Anticipating Goethe’s dictum that knowledge that does not lead to
action is vain and poisonous, Francis said, Tantum homo habet de
scientia , quantum operatur —“A man has only so much knowledge as he
puts to work.” 45 No friar was to own a book, not even a psalter. In
preaching they were to use song as well as speech; they might even, said
Francis, imitate the jongleurs , and become ioculatores Dei , gleemen of
God. 46</p>
<p>Sometimes the friars were derided, beaten, or robbed of almost their
last garment. Francis bade them offer no resistance. In many cases the
miscre- ants, astonished at what seemed a superhuman indifference to
pride and prop- erty, begged forgiveness and restored their thefts. 47
We do not know if the following specimen of the Little Flowers of
St. Francis is history or legend, but it portrays the ecstatic piety
that runs through all that we hear of the saint:</p>
<p>One winter’s day as Francis was going from Perugia, suffering</p>
<p>sorely from the bitter cold, he said: “Friar Leo, although the
Friars</p>
<p>Minor give good examples of holiness and edification,
nevertheless</p>
<p>write and note down diligently that perfect joy is not to be
found</p>
<p>herein.” And Francis went his way a little farther, and said: “O
Friar Leo, even though the Friars Minor gave sight to the blind, made
the crooked straight, cast out devils, made the deaf to hear and the
lame to walk… and raised to life those who had lain four days in the
grave —write: perfect joy is never found there.” And he journeyed on
a</p>
<p>little while, and cried aloud: “O Friar Leo, if the Friar Minor knew
all</p>
<p>ongues and sciences and all the Scriptures, so that he could foretell
and reveal not only future things but even the secrets of the con-</p>
<p>science and the soul — write: perfect joy is not there.”… Yet a
little</p>
<p>farther he went, and cried again aloud: “O Friar Leo, although
the</p>
<p>Friar Minor were skilled to preach so well that he should convert all
infidels to Christ — write: not there is perfect joy.” And when this</p>
<p>79 the age of faith (chap, xxix</p>
<p>fashion of talk had continued for two miles, Friar Leo asked:…</p>
<p>“Father, prithee in God’s name tell me where is perfect j oy to
be</p>
<p>found?” And Francis answered him: “When we are come to St. Mary of
the Angels” [then the Franciscan chapel in Assisi], “wet through</p>
<p>with rain, frozen with cold, foul with mire, and tormented with</p>
<p>hunger, and when we knock at the door, and the doorkeeper comes in a
rage and says, ‘Who are you?’ and we say, ’We are two of your</p>
<p>friars,’ and he answers, ’You lie, you are rather two knaves who
go</p>
<p>about deceiving the world and stealing the alms of the poor. Begone!’
and he opens not to us, and makes us stay outside hungry and cold all
night in the rain and snow; then, if we endure patiently such cruelty…
without complaint or mourning, and believe humbly and charita- bly that
it is God who made the doorkeeper rail against us — O Friar Leo, write:
there is perfect joy! And if we persevere in our knock-</p>
<p>ing; and he issues forth, and angrily drives us away, abusing us
and</p>
<p>smiting us on the cheek, saying, ‘Go hence, you vile thieves!’— if
this we suffer patiently with love and gladness, write, O Friar Leo:
this is perfect joy! And if, constrained by hunger and by cold, we
knock</p>
<p>once more and pray with many tears that he open to us for the love of
God, and he… issues forth with a ’big knotted stick and seizes us by our
cowls and flings us on the ground, and rolls us in the snow,</p>
<p>bruising every bone in our bodies with that heavy club; if we,
think-</p>
<p>ing on the agony of the blessed Christ, endure all these things
pa-</p>
<p>iently and joyously for love of Him — write, O Friar Leo, that
here</p>
<p>a nd in this is found perfect joy.” 48</p>
<p>The remembrance of his early life of indulgence gave him a haunting
sense of sin; and if we may believe the Little Flowers he sometimes
wondered whether God would ever forgive him. A touching story tells how,
in the early days of the order, when they could find no breviary from
which to read the divine office, Francis extemporized a litany of
contrition, and bade Brother Leo repeat after him words accusing Francis
of sin. Leo at each sen- tence tried to repeat th e accusation, but
found himself saying, instead, “The mercy of God is infinite.” 49 On
another occasion, just convalescing from quartan fever, Francis had
himself dragged naked before the people in the market place of Assisi,
and commanded a friar to throw a full dish of ashes into his face; and
to the crowd he said: “You believe me to be a holy man, but I confess to
God and you that I have in this my infirmity eaten meat and broth made
with meat.” 50 The people were all the more convinced of his sanctity.
They told how a young friar had seen Christ and the Virgin con- versing
with him; they attributed many miracles to him, and brought their sick
and “possessed” to him to be healed. His charity became a legend. He
could not bear to see others poorer than himself; he so often gave to
the pass- ing poor the garments from his back that his disciples found
it hard to keep him clothed. Once, says the probably legendary Mirror of
Perfection , 51</p>
<p>MONKS AND FRIARS</p>
<p>797</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>when he was returning from Siena he came across a poor man on the
way, and said to a fellow monk: “We ought to return this mantle to</p>
<p>its owner. For we received it only as a loan until we should come
upon one poorer than ourselves…. It would be counted to us as a theft if
we should not give it to him who is more needy.”</p>
<p>His love overflowed from men to animals, to plants, even to inanimate
things. The Mirror of Perfection , unverified, ascribes to him a kind of
re- hearsal for his later Canticle of the Sun:</p>
<p>In the morning, when the sun rises, every man ought to praise God,
who created it for our use…. When it becomes night, every man</p>
<p>ought to give praise on account of Brother Fire, by which our eyes
are then enlightened; for we be all, as it were, blind; and the Lord
by</p>
<p>hese two, our brothers, doth enlighten our eyes.</p>
<p>He so admired fire that he hesitated to extinguish a candle; the fire
might ob- ject to being put out. He felt a sensitive kinship with every
living thing. He wished to “supplicate the Emperor’’ (Frederick II, a
great hunter of birds) “to tell him, for the love of God and me, to make
a special law that no man should take or kill our sisters the larks, nor
do them any harm; likewise that all the podestas or mayors of the towns,
and the lords of castles and villages, should require men every year on
Christmas Day to throw grain outside the cities and castles, that our
sisters the larks, and other birds, may have some- thing to eat.” 52
Meeting a youth who had snared some turtle dov es and was taking them to
market, Francis persuaded the boy to give them to him; the saints built
nests for them, “that ye may be fruitful and multiply”; they obeyed
abundantly, and lived near the monastery in happy friendship with the
monks, occasionally snatching food from the table at which these were
eating. 53 A score of legends embroidered this theme. One told how
Francis preached to “my little sisters the birds” on the road between
Cannora and Bevagna; and “those that were on the trees flew d own to
hear him, and stood still the while St. Francis made an end of his
sermon.”</p>
<p>My little sisters the birds, much are ye beholden to God your
Cre-</p>
<p>ator, and always and in every place ye ought to praise Him for
that</p>
<p>He hath given you a double and triple vesture. He hath given you</p>
<p>freedom to go into any place Moreover ye sow not, neither do ye</p>
<p>reap, and God feedeth you and giveth you the rivers and the foun-</p>
<p>ains for your drink; He giveth you the mountains and the valleys for
your refuge, and the tall trees wherein to build your nests; and for as
much as ye can neither spin nor sew, God clotheth you and your</p>
<p>children Therefore beware, little sisters mine, of the sin of
ingrati-</p>
<p>ude, but ever strive to praise God. 54</p>
<p>We are assured by Friars James and Masseo that the birds bowed in
reverence to Francis, and would not depart until he had blessed them.
The Fioretti or</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XLittle Flowers from which this story comes are an Italian
amplification of a Latin Actus Beati Francisci (1323); they belong less
to factual history than to literature; but there they rank among the
most engaging compositions of the Age of Faith.</p>
<p>Having been advised that he needed papal permission to establish a
reli- gious order, Francis and his twelve disciples went to Rome in
1210, and laid their request and their rule before Innocent III. The
great Pope gently coun- seled them to defer formal organization of a new
order until time should test the practicability of the ru le. “My dear
children,” he said, “your life ap - pears to me too severe. I see indeed
that your fervor is great… but I ought to consider those who will come
after you, lest your mode of life be beyond their strength.” 05 Francis
persisted, and the P ope finally yielded — incarnate strength to
incarnate faith. The friars took the tonsure, submitted themselves to
the hierarchy, and received from the Benedictines of Mt. Subasio, near
Assisi, the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, so small — some ten feet
long — that it came to be called Portiuncula — “little portion.” The
friars built them - selves huts around the chapel, and these huts formed
the first monastery of the First Order of St. Francis.</p>
<p>Now not only did new members join the order, but, to the joy of the
saint, a wealthy girl of eighteen, Clara dei Sciffi, asked his
permission to form a Second Order of St. Francis, for women (1212).
Leaving her home, she vowed herself to poverty, chastity, and obedience,
and became the abbess of a Franciscan convent built around the chapel of
St. Damian. In 1221 a Third Order of St. Francis — the Tertiaries — was
formed among laymen who, while not bound to the full Franciscan rule,
wished to obey that rule as far as pos- sible while living in the
“world,” a nd to help the First and Second Orders with their labor and
charity.</p>
<p>The ever more numerous Franciscans now ( 1 2 1 1 ) brought their
gospel to the towns of Umbria, and later to the other provinces of
Italy. They uttered no heresy, but preached little theology; nor did
they ask of their hearers the chastity, poverty, and obedience to which
they themselves were vowed. “Fear and honor God,” they said, “praise and
bless Him…. Repent… for you know that we shall soon die…. Abstain from
evil, persevere in the good.” Italy had heard such words before, but
seldom from men of such evi - dent sincerity. Crowds came to their
preaching; and one Umbrian village, learning of Francis’ approach, went
out en masse to greet him with flowers, banners, and song. 56 At Siena
he found the city in civil war; his preaching brought both factions to
his feet, and at his urging they ended their strife for a while. 57 It
was on these missionary tours in Italy that he contracted the malaria
which was to bring him to an early death.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, encouraged by his Italian success, and knowing little
of Islam, Francis resolved to go to Syria and convert the Moslems, even
the sul- tan. In 1 2 1 2 he sailed from an Italian port, but a storm
cast his ship upon the</p>
<p>MONKS AND FRIARS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>Dalmatian coast, and he was forced to return to Italy; legend,
however, tells how “St. Francis converted the soldan of Babylon.” 88 In
the same year, says a story probably also mythical, he went to Spain to
convert the Moors; but on arrival he fell so ill that his disciples had
to bring him back to Assisi. An- other questionable narrative takes him
to Egypt; he passed unharmed, we are told, into the Moslem army that was
resisting the Crusaders at Damietta; he offered to go through fire if
the sultan would promise to lead his troops into the Christian faith in
case Francis emerged unscathed; the sultan refused, but had the saint
escorted safely to the Christian camp. Horrified by the fury with which
the soldiers of Christ massacred the Moslem population at the capture of
Damietta, 39 Francis returned to Italy a sick and saddened man. To his
chilling malaria, it is said, he added in Egypt an eye infection that
would in later years almost destroy his sight.</p>
<p>During these long absences of the saint his followers multiplied
faster than was good for his rule. His fame brought recruits who took
the vows without due reflection; some came to regret their haste; and
many complained that the rule was too severe. Francis made reluctant
concessions. Doubtless, too, the expansion of the order, which had
divided itself into several houses scat- tered through Umbria, made such
demands upon him for administrative skill and tact as his mystic
absorption could hardly meet. Once, we are told, when one monk spoke
evil of another, Francis commanded him to eat a lump of ass’s dung so
that his tongue should not relish evil any more; the monk obeyed, but
his fellows were more shocked by the punishment than by the offense. 60
In 1 2 20 Francis resigned his leadership, bade his followers elect an-
other minister-general, and thereafter counted himself a simple monk. A
year later, however, disturbed by further relaxations of the original
(1210) rule, he drew up a new rule — his famous “Testament”— aiming to
restore full observance of the vow of poverty, and forbidding the monks
to move from their huts at the Portiuncula to the more salubrious
quarters built for them by the townspeople. He submitted this rule to
Honorius III, who turned it over to a committee of prelates for
revision; when it came from their hands it made a dozen obeisances to
Francis, and as many relaxations of the rule. The predictions of
Innocent III had been verified.</p>
<p>Reluctantly but humbly obedient, Francis now gave himself to a life
of mostly solitary contemplation, asceticism, and prayer. The intensity
of his devotion and his imagination occasionally brought him visions of
Christ, or Mary, or the apostles. In 1224, with three disciples, he left
Assisi, and rode across hill and plain to a hermitage on Mt. Verna, near
Chiusi. He secluded himself in a lonely hut beyond a deep ravine,
allowed none but Brother Leo to visit him, and bade him come only twice
a day, and not to come if he re- ceived no answer to his call of
approach. On September 14, 1224, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy
Cross, after a long fast and a night spent in vigil and prayer, Francis
thought he saw a seraph coming down from the sky,</p>
<p>8oo</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xbearing an image of the crucified Christ. When the vision faded he
felt strange pains, and discovered fleshy excrescences on the palms and
backs of his hands, on the soles and tops of his feet, and on his body,
resembling in place and color the wounds — stigmata — presumably made by
the nails that were believed to have bound the extremities of Jesus to
the cross, and by the lance that had pierced His side.*</p>
<p>Francis returned to the hermitage, and to Assisi. A year after the
appear- ance of the stigmata he began to lose his sight. On a visit to
St. Clara’s nun - nery he was struck completely blind. Clara nursed him
back to sight, and kept him at St. Damian’s for a month. There one day
in 1224, perhaps in the joy of convalescence, he composed, in Italian
poetic prose, his “Canticle of the Sun”: 62</p>
<p>Most High, Omnipotent, Good Lord.</p>
<p>Thine be the praise, the glory, the honor, and all benediction;</p>
<p>o Thee alone, Most High, they are due,</p>
<p>and no man is worthy to mention Thee.</p>
<p>Be Thou praised, my Lord, with all Thy creatures,</p>
<p>above all Brother Sun,</p>
<p>who gives the day and lightens us therewith.</p>
<p>And he is beautiful and radiant with great splendor;</p>
<p>of Thee, Most High, he bears similitude.</p>
<p>Be Thou praised, my Lord, of Sister Moon and the stars;</p>
<p>in the heaven hast Thou formed them, clear and precious</p>
<p>and comely.</p>
<p>Be Thou praised, my Lord, of Brother Wind,</p>
<p>and of the air, and the cloud, and of fair and of all weather,</p>
<p>by the which Thou givest to Thy creatures sustenance.</p>
<p>Be Thou praised, my Lord, of Sister Water,</p>
<p>which is much useful and humble and precious and pure.</p>
<p>Be Thou praised, my Lord, of Brother Fire,</p>
<p>by which Thou hast lightened the night,</p>
<p>and he is beautiful and joyful and robust and strong.</p>
<p>Be Thou praised, my Lord, of our Sister Mother Earth,</p>
<p>which sustains and hath us in rule,</p>
<p>and produces divers fruits with colored flowers and herbs.</p>
<ul>

<p>Be Thou praised, my Lord, of those who pardon for Thy love</p>
<p>and endure sickness and tribulations.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who will endure it in peace,</p>
<p>for by Thee, Most High, they shall be crowned.</p>
<p>In 1225 some physicians at Rieti, having to no good effect anointed
his eyes with “the urine of a virgin boy,” resorted to drawing a rod of
white -hot iron across his forehead. Francis , we are told, appealed to
“Brother Fire: you are beautiful above all creatures; be favorable to me
in this hour; you know how much I have always loved you”; he said later
that he had felt no pain. He recovered enough sight to set forth on
another preaching tour. He soon broke down under the hardships of
travel; malaria and dropsy crippled him, and he was taken back to
Assisi.</p>
<p>Despite his protestations he was put to bed in the episcopal palace.
He asked the doctor to tell him the truth, and was told that he could
barely sur- vive the autumn. He astonished everyone by beginning to
sing. Then, it is said, he added a stanza to his Canticle of the
Sun:</p>
<p>Be praised, Lord, for our Sister Bodily Death, from whom</p>
<p>no man can escape.</p>
<p>Alas for them who die in mortal sin;</p>
<p>Blessed are they who are found in Thy holy will,</p>
<p>for the second death will not work them harm. 63</p>
<p>It is said that in these last days he repented of his asceticism, as
having “of - fended his brother the body.” 64 When the bishop was called
away Francis persuaded the monks to remove him to Portiuncula. There he
dictated his will, at once modest and commanding: he bade his followers
be content with “poor and abandoned churches,” and not to accept
habitations out of har - mony with their vows of poverty; to surrender
to the bishop any heretic or recreant monk in the order; and never to
change the rule. 65</p>
<p>He died October 3, 1 2 26, in the forty-fifth year of his age,
singing a psalm. Two years later the Church named him a saint. Two other
leaders dominated that dynamic age: Innocent III and Frederick II.
Innocent raised the Church to its greatest height, from which in a
century it fell. Frederick raised the Empire to its greatest height,
from which in a decade it fell. Francis exagger- ated the virtues of
poverty and ignorance, but he reinvigorated Christianity by bringing
back into it the spirit of Christ. Today only scholars know of the Pope
and the Emperor, but the simple saint reaches into the hearts of
millions of men.</p>
<p>The order that he had founded numbered at his death some 5000
members, and had spread into Hungary, Germany, England, France, and
Spain. It proved the bulwark of the Church in winning northern Italy
from heresy back to Catholicism. Its gospel of poverty and illiteracy
could be accepted</p>
<p>802</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xby only a small minority; Europe insisted on traversing the exciting
parabola of wealth, science, philosophy, and doubt. Meanwhile even the
modified rule that Francis had so unwillingly accepted was further
relaxed (1230); men could not be expected to stay long, and in needed
number, on the heights of the almost delirious asceticism that had
shortened Francis’ life. With a milder rule the Friars Minor grew by
1280 to 200,000 monks in 8000 monasteries. They became great preachers,
and by their example led the secular clergy to take up the custom of
preaching, heretofore confined to bishops. They pro- duced saints like
St. Bernardino of Siena and St. Anthony of Padua, scien- tists like
Roger Bacon, philosophers like Duns Scotus, teachers like Alexan- der of
Hales. Some became agents of the Inquisition; some rose to be bishops,
archbishops, popes; many undertook dangerous missionary enterprises in
distant and alien lands. Gifts poured in from the pious; some leaders,
like Brother Elias, learned to like luxury; and though Francis had
forbidden rich churches, Elias raised to his memory the imposing
basilica that still crowns the hill of Assisi. The paintings of Cimabue
and Giotto there were the first products of an immense and enduring
influence of St. Francis, his history and his legend, on Italian
art.</p>
<p>Many Minorites protested against the relaxation of Francis’ rule. As
“Spir - ituals” or “Zealots” they lived in herm itages or small convents
in the Apen- nines, while the great majority of Franciscans preferred
spacious monas- teries. The Spirituals argued that Christ and His
apostles had possessed no property; St. Bonaventura agreed; Pope
Nicholas III approved the proposi- tion in 1279; Pope John XXII
pronounced it false in 1323; and thereafter those Spirituals who
persisted in preaching it were suppressed as heretics. A century after
the death of Francis his most loyal followers were burned at the stake
by the Inquisition.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ST. DOMINIC</li>
</ol>
<p>It is unjust to Dominic that his name should suggest the Inquisition.
He was not its founder, nor was he responsible for its terrors; his own
activity was to convert by example and preaching. He was of sterner
stuff than Francis, but revered him as the saintlier saint; and Francis
loved him in re- turn. Essentially their work was the same: each
organized a great order of men devoted not to self-salvation in solitude
but to missionary work among Christians and infidels. Each took from the
heretics their most persuasive weapons — the praise of poverty and the
practice of preaching. Together they saved the Church.</p>
<p>Domingo de Guzman was born at Calaruega in Castile (1170). Brought up
by an uncle priest, he was one of thousands who in those days took
Chris- tianity to heart. When famine struck Palencia he is said to have
sold all his</p>
<p>MONKS AND FRIARS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>803</p>
<p>goods, even his precious books, to feed the poor. He became an
Augustinian canon regular in the cathedral of Osma, and in 1 201
accompanied his bishop on a mission to Toulouse, then a center of the
Albigensian heresy. Their very host was an Albigensian; it may be a
legend that Dominic converted him overnight. Inspired by the advice of
the bishop and the example of some heretics, Dominic adopted the life of
voluntary poverty, went about bare- foot, and strove peaceably to bring
the people back to the Church. At Mont- pellier he met three papal
legates — Arnold, Raoul, and Peter of Castelnau. He was shocked by their
rich dress and luxury, and attributed to this their con- fessed failure
to make headway against the heretics. He rebuked them with the boldness
of a Hebrew prophet: “It is not by the display of power and pomp, nor by
cavalcades of retainers and richly houseled palfreys, nor by gorgeous
apparel, that the heretics win proselytes; it is by zealous preaching,
by apostolic humility, by austerity, by holiness.” 66 The shamed
legates, we are told, dismissed their equipage and shed their shoes.</p>
<p>For ten years (1205-16) Dominic remained in Languedoc, preaching</p>
<p>zealously. The only mention of him in connection with physical
persecution tells how, at a burning of heretics, he saved one from the
flames. 67 Some of his order proudly called lam, after his death,
Persecutor haereticorum — not necessarily the persecutor but the pursuer
of heretics. He gathered about him a group of fellow preachers, and
their effectiveness was such that Pope Honorius III (1216) recognized
the Friars Preachers as a new order, and ap- proved the rule drawn up
for it by Dominic. Making his headquarters at Rome, Dominic gathered
recruits, taught them, inspired them with his al- most- fanatical zeal,
and sent them out through Europe as far east as Kiev, and into foreign
lands, to convert Christendom and heathendom to Christianity. At the
first general chapter of the Dominicans at Bologna in 1220, Dominic
persuaded his followers to adopt by unanimous vote the rule of absolute
poverty. There, a year later, he died.</p>
<p>Like the Franciscans, the Dominicans spread everywhere as wandering,
mendicant friars. Matthew Paris describes them in the England of
1240:</p>
<p>Very sparing in food and raiment, possessing neither gold nor
silver</p>
<p>nor anything of their own, they went through cities, towns, and
vil-</p>
<p>lages, preaching the Gospel… living together by tens or sevens…
thinking not of the morrow, nor keeping anything for the next morn-
ing…. Whatsoever was left over from their table of the alms given them,
this they gave forthwith to the poor. They went shod only with the
Gospel, they slept in their clothes on mats, and laid stones for</p>
<p>pillows under their heads. 68</p>
<p>They took an active, and not always a gentle, part in the work of the
Inquisi- tion. They were employed by the popes in high posts and
diplomatic mis- sions. They entered the universities and produced the
two giants of Scholas- tic philosophy, Albertus Magnus and Thomas
Aquinas; it was they who</p>
<p>804 the age of faith (chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xsaved the Church from Aristotle by transforming him into a
Christian. To- gether with the Franciscans, the Carmelites, and the
Austin Friars they revo- lutionized the monastic life by mingling with
the common people in daily ministrations, and raised monasticism in the
thirteenth century to a power and beauty which it had never attained
before.</p>
<p>A large perspective of monastic history does not bear out the
exaggera- tions of moralists nor the caricatures of satirists. Many
cases of monastic misconduct can be cited; they draw attention precisely
because they are ex- ceptional; and which of us is so saintly that he
may demand an untarnished record from any class of men? The monks who
remained faithful to their vows — who lived in obscure poverty,
chastity, and piety — eluded both gossip and history; virtue makes no
news, and bores both readers and historians. We hear of “sumptuous
edifices” possessed by Franciscan monks as early as 1 249, and in 1271
Roger Bacon, whose hyperboles often forfeited him a hearing, informed
the pope that “the new orders are now horribly fallen from their
original dignity.” 69 But this is hardly the picture that we get from
Fra Salimbene’s candid and intimate Chronicle (1288?). Here a Franciscan
monk takes us behind the scenes and into the daily career of his order.
There are peccadilloes here and there, and some quarrels and jealousy;
but over all that arduously inhibited life hovers an atmosphere of
modesty, simplicity, broth- erliness, and peace. 70 If, occasionally, a
woman enters this story, she merely brings a touch of grace and
tenderness into narrow and lonely lives. Hear a sample of Fra
Salimbene’s guileless chatter:</p>
<p>There was a certain youth in the convent of Bologna who was called
Brother Guido. He was wont to snore so mightily in his sleep that no man
could rest in the same house with him, wherefore he was set to sleep in
a shed among the wood and straw; yet even so the brethren could not
escape him, for the sound of that accursed rumbling echoed throughout
the whole convent. So all the priests and discreet brethren gathered
together… and it was decreed by a formal sentence that he should be sent
back to his mother, who had deceived the order, since she knew all this
of her son before he was received among us. Yet was he not sent back
forthwith, which was the Lord’s doing…. For</p>
<p>Brother Nicholas, considering within himself that the boy was to
be</p>
<p>cast out through a defect of nature, and without guilt of his
own,</p>
<p>called the lad daily about the hour of dawn to come and serve him at
Mass; and at the end of the Mass the boy would kneel at his bidding
behind the altar, hoping to receive some grace of him. Then would</p>
<p>Brother Nicholas touch the boy’s face and nose with his hands, desir
- ing, by Go d’s gifts, to bestow on him the boon of health. In
brief,</p>
<p>he boy was suddenly and wholly healed, without further discomfort to
the brethren. Thenceforth he slept in peace and quiet, like any</p>
<p>dormouse. 71</p>

<p>MONKS AND FRIARS</p>
<p>805</p>
<p>V. THE NUNS</p>
<p>As early as the time of St. Paul it had been the custom, in Christian
com- munities, for widows and other lonely or devout women to give some
or all of their days and their property to charitable work. In the
fourth century some women, emulating monks, left the world and lived the
life of religious in solitude or in communities, under vows of poverty,
chastity, and obedi- ence. About 530 St. Benedict’s twin sister
Scholastica established a nunnery near Monte Cassino under his guidance
and rule. From that time Benedictine convents spread through Europe, and
Benedictine nuns became almost as numerous as Benedictine monks. The
Cistercian Order opened its first con- vent in 1125, its most famous
one, Port Royal, in 1204; by 1300 there were 700 Cistercian nunneries in
Europe. 72 In these older orders most of the nuns came from the upper
classes, 73 and nunneries were too often the repository of women for
whom their male relations had no room or taste. In 458 the Emperor
Majorian had to forbid parents to rid themselves of supernumerary
daughters by compelling them to enter a convent. 74 Entry into
Benedictine nunneries usually required a dowry, though the Church
prohibited any but voluntary offerings. 75 Hence a prioress, like
Chaucer’s, could be a woman of proud breeding and large
responsibilities, administering a spacious domain as the source of her
convent’s revenues. In those days a nun was usually called not Sister
but Madame.</p>
<p>St. Francis revolutionized conventual as well as monastic
institutions’. When Santa Clara came to him in 1212, and expressed her
wish to found for women such an order as he had founded for men, he
overlooked canonical regulations and, though himself only a deacon,
received her vows, accepted her into the Franciscan Order, and
commissioned her to organize the Poor Clares. Innocent III, with his
usual ability to forgive infractions of the letter by the spirit,
confirmed the commission (1216). Santa Clara gathered about her some
pious women who lived in communal poverty, wove and spun, nursed the
sick, and distributed charity. Legends formed around her almost as
fondly as around Francis himself. Once, we are told, a pope</p>
<p>went to her convent to hear her discourse of divine and celestial
things.</p>
<p>… Santa Clara had the table laid, and set loaves of bread thereon
that the Holy Father might bless them…. Santa Clara knelt down with</p>
<p>great reverence, and besought him to be pleased to bless the
bread….</p>
<p>The Holy Father answered: “Sister Clare, most faithful one, I
desire</p>
<p>hat thou shouldst bless this bread, and make over it the sign of the
most holy cross of Christ, to which thou hast completely devoted</p>
<p>hyself.” And Santa Clara said: “Most Holy Father, forgive me, but
I</p>
<p>should merit great reproof if, in the presence of the Vicar of
Christ,</p>
<p>I, who am a poor, vile woman, should presume to give such
benedic-</p>
<p>80 6 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xion.” And the Pope answered: “To the end that this be not imputed to
thy presumption but to the merit of obedience, I command thee, by holy
obedience, that thou… bless this bread in the name of God.”</p>
<p>And then Santa Clara, even as a true daughter of obedience, devoutly
blessed the bread with the sign of the most holy cross. Marvelous to
tell! forthwith on all those loaves the sign of the cross appeared fig-
ured most beautifully. And the Holy Father, when he saw this mira-</p>
<p>cle, partook of the bread and departed, thanking God and leaving his
blessing with Santa Clara. 76</p>
<p>She died in 1253, and was canonized soon afterward. Franciscan monks
in divers localities organized similar groups of Clarissi, or Poor
Clares. The other mendicant orders — Dominicans, Augustinians,
Carmelites — also estab- lished a “second order” of nuns; and by 1300
Europe had as many nuns as monks. In Germany the nunneries tended to be
havens of intense mysticism; in France and England they were often the
refuge of noble ladies “con - verted” from the world, or deserted,
disappointed, or bereaved. The Ancren Riwle — i.e., the Rule of the
Anchorites — reveals the mood expected of Eng- lish nuns in the
thirteenth century. It may have been written by Bishop Poore probably
for a convent at Tarrant in Dorsetshire. It is darkened with much talk
of sin and hell, and some blasphemous abuse of the female body; 77 but a
tone of fine sincerity redeems it, and it is among the oldest and
noblest specimens of English prose. 78</p>
<p>It would be a simple matter to gather, from ten centuries, some
fascinating instances of conventual immorality. A number of nuns had
been cloistered against their wills, 79 and found it uncomfortable to be
saints. Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury and Bishop Egbert of York
deemed it necessary to forbid the seduction of nuns by abbots, priests,
and bishops. 80 Bishop Ivo of Chartres (1035- 1115) reported that the
nuns of St. Fara’s Convent were practicing prostitution; Abelard (
1079-1 142) gave a similar picture of some French convents of his time;
Pope Innocent III described the convent of St. Agatha as a brothel that
infected the whole surrounding country with its evil life and repute. 81
Bishop Rigaud of Rouen ( 1 249) gave a generally favorable report of the
religious groups in his diocese, but told of one nunnery in which, out
of thirty-three nuns and three lay sisters, eight were guilty, or
suspected, of fornication, and “the prioress is drunk almost any night.”
82 Boniface VIII ( 1 300) tried to improve conventual discipline by
decreeing strict claustration, or seclusion from the world; but the
decree could not be enforced. 83 At one nunnery in the diocese of
Lincoln, when the bishop came to deposit this papal bull, the nuns threw
it at his head, and vowed they would never obey it; 84 such isolation
had probably not been in their vows. The prioress in Chaucer’s Tales had
no business there, for the Church had forbidden nuns to go on
pilgrimage. 85</p>
<p>If history had been as careful to note instances of obedience to
conventual</p>
<p>MONKS AND FRIARS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>807</p>
<p>rules as to record infractions, we should probably be able to counter
each sinful lapse with a thousand examples of fidelity. In many cases
the rules were inhumanly severe, and merited violation. Carthusian and
Cistercian nuns were required to keep silence except when speech was
indispensable — a com- mand sorely uncongenial to the gentle sex.
Usually the nuns attended to their own needs of cleaning, cooking,
washing, sewing; they made clothing for monks and the poor, linen for
the altar, vestments for the priest; they wove and embroidered hangings
and tapestries, and depicted on them, with nimble fingers and patient
souls, half the history of the world. They copied and illuminated
manuscripts; they received children to board, and taught them letters,
hygiene, and domestic arts; for centuries they provided the only higher
education open to girls. Many of them served as nurses in hospitals.
They rose at midnight for prayers, and again before dawn, and recited
the canonical hours. Many days were fast days, on which they ate no food
till the evening meal.</p>
<p>Let us hope that these hard rules were sometimes infringed. If we
look back upon the nineteen centuries of Christianity, with all their
heroes, kings, and saints, we shall find it difficult to list many men
who came so close to Christian perfection as the nuns. Their lives of
quiet devotion and cheerful ministration have made many generations
blessed. When all the sins of history are weighed in the balance, the
virtues of these women will tip the scale against them, and redeem our
race.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE MYSTICS</li>
</ol>
<p>Many such women could be saints because they felt divinity closer to
them than hands and feet. The medieval imagination was so stimulated by
all the forces of word, picture, statue, ceremony, even by the color and
quantity of light, that supersensory visions came readily, and the
believing soul felt itself breaking through the bounds of nature to the
supernatural. The human mind itself, in all the mystery of its power,
seemed a supernatural and unearthly thing, surely akin to — a blurred
image and infinitesimal fraction of — the Mind behind and in the matter
of the world; so the top of the mind might touch the foot of the throne
of God. In the ambitious humility of the mystic the hope burned that a
soul unburdened of sin and uplifted with prayer might rise on the wings
of grace to the Beatific Vision and a divine companionship. That vision
could never be attained through sensation, reason, science, or philos-
ophy, which were bound to time, the many, and the earth, and could never
reach to the core and power and oneness of the universe. The problem of
the mystic was to cleanse the soul as an internal organ of spiritual
perception, to wash away from it all stain of selfish individuality and
illusory multiplicity, to widen its reach and love to the uttermost
inclusion, and then to see, with clear and disembodied sight, the
cosmic, eternal, and divine, and thereby to</p>
<p>808 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xreturn, as from a long exile, to union with the God from Whom birth
had meant a penal severance. Had not Christ promised that the pure in
heart would see God?</p>
<p>Mystics, therefore, appeared in every age, every religion, and every
land. Greek Christianity abounded in them despite the Hellenic legacy of
reason. St. Augustine was a mystic fountain for the West; his
Concessions constituted a return of the soul from created things to God;
seldom had any mortal so long conversed with the Deity. St. Anselm the
statesman, St. Bernard the organizer, upheld the mystical approach
against the rationalism of Roscelin and Abelard. When William of
Champeaux was driven from Paris by the logic of Abelard, he founded in a
suburb (i 108) the Augustinian abbey of St. Victor as a school of
theology; and his successors there, Hugh and Rich- ard, ignoring the
perilous adventure of young philosophy, based religion not on argument
but on the mystical experience of the divine presence. Hugh (d. 1 141)
saw supernatural sacramental symbols in every phase of creation; Richard
(d. 1173) rejected logic and learning, preferred the “heart” to the
“head” a la Pascal, and described with learned logic the mystical rise
of the soul to God.</p>
<p>The passion of Italy kindled mysticism into a gospel of revolution.
Joachim of Flora — Giovanni dei Gioacchini di Fiori — a noble of
Calabria, developed a longing to see Palestine. Impressed on the way by
the misery of the people, he dismissed his retinue and continued as a
humble pilgrim. Legend tells how he passed an entire Lent in an old well
on Mt. Tabor; how, on Easter Sunday, a great splendor appeared to him,
and filled him with such divine light that he understood at once all the
Scriptures, all the future and the past. Returning to Calabria, he
became a Cistercian monk and priest, thirsted for austerity, and retired
to a hermitage. Disciples gathered, and he formed them into a new Order
of Flora, whose rule of poverty and prayer was approved by Celestine
III. In 1 200 he sent to Innocent III a series of works which he had
written, he said, under divine inspiration, but which, nevertheless, he
sub- mitted for papal censorship. Two years later he died.</p>
<p>His writings were based on the Augustinian theory — widely accepted
in orthodox circles — that a symbolic concordance existed between the
events of the Old Testament and the history of Christendom from the
birth of Christ to the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.
Joachim divided the history of man into three stages: the first, under
the rule of God the Father, ended at the Nativity; the second, ruled by
the Son, would last, ac- cording to apocalyptic calculations, 1260
years; the third, under the Holy Ghost, would be preceded by a time of
troubles, of war and poverty and ecclesiastical corruption, and would be
ushered in by the rise of a new monastic order which would cleanse the
Church, and would realize a world- wide utopia of peace, justice, and
happiness. 86</p>
<p>Thousands of Christians, including men high in the Church,
accepted</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) MONKS AND FRIARS 809</p>
<p>Joachim’s claim to divine inspiration, and looked hopefully to 1260
as the year of the Second Advent. The Spiritual Franciscans, confident
that theirs was the new Order, took courage from Joachim’s teachings;
and when they were outlawed by the Church they carried on their
propaganda through writings published under his name. In 1254 an edition
of Joachim’s main works appeared under the title of The Everlasting
Gospel, with a com- mentary proclaiming that a pope tainted with simony
would mark the close of the Second Age, and that in the Third Age the
need of sacraments and priests would be ended by the reign of universal
love. The book was con- demned by the Church; its presumptive author, a
Franciscan monk Gherardo da Borgo, was imprisoned for life; but its
circulation secretly continued, and deeply affected mystical and
heretical thought in Italy and France from St. Francis to Dante — who
placed Joachim in paradise.</p>
<p>Perhaps in excited expectation of the coming Kingdom, a mania of
religious penitence flared up around Perugia in 1259, and swept through
northern Italy. Thousands of penitents of every age and class marched in
disorderly procession, dressed only in loincloths, weeping, praying God
for mercy, and scourging themselves with leather thongs. Thieves and
usurers fell in, and restored their illegal gains; murderers, catching
the contagion of repentance, knelt before their victims’ kin and begged
to be slain; prisoners were re - leased, exiles were recalled, enmities
were healed. The movement spread through Germany into Bohemia; and for a
time it seemed that a new and mystical faith, ignoring the Church, would
inundate Europe. But in a little while the nature of man reasserted
itself; new enmities developed, sinning and murder were renewed; and the
Flagellant craze disappeared into the psychic recesses from which it had
emerged. 87</p>
<p>The mystic flame burned less fitfully in Flanders. A priest of Liege,
Lam- bert le Begue (i.e., the stutterer), established in 1184 on the
Meuse a house for women who, without taking monastic vows, wished to
live together in small semi-communistic groups, supporting themselves by
weaving wool and making lace. Similar maisons-Dieu, or houses of God,
were established for men. The men called themselves Beghards, the women
Beguines. These com- munities, like the Waldenses, condemned the Church
for owning property, and themselves practiced a voluntary poverty. A
similar sect, the Brethren of the Free Spirit, appeared about 1262 in
Augsburg, and developed in the cities along the Rhine. Both movements
claimed a mystical inspiration which absolved them from ecclesiastical
control, even from state or moral law. 88 State and Church combined to
suppress them; they went underground, emerged repeatedly under new
names, and contributed to the origin and fervor of the Anabaptists and
other radical sects in the Reformation.</p>
<p>Germany became the favorite land of mysticism in the West. Hildegarde
of Bingen (1099- 1 179), the “Sibyl of the Rhine,” li ved all but eight
of her eighty-two years as a Benedictine nun, and ended as abbess of a
convent on</p>

<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xhe Rupertsberg. She was an unusual mixture of administrator and
visionary, pietist and radical, poet and scientist, physician and saint.
She corresponded with popes and kings, always in a tone of inspired
authority, and in Latin prose of masculine power. She published several
books of visions ( Scivias ) , for which she claimed the collaboration
of the Deity; the clergy were chagrined to hear it, for these
revelations were highly critical of the wealth and corruption of the
Church. Said Hildegarde, in accents of eternal hope:</p>
<p>Divine justice shall have its hour… the judgments of God are about to
be accomplished; the Empire and the Papacy, sunk into impiety,</p>
<p>shall crumble away together…. But upon their ruins shall appear a new
nation The heathen, the Jews, the worldly and the unbeliev-</p>
<p>ing, shall be converted together; springtime and peace shall reign
over a regenerated world, and the angels will return with confidence
to</p>
<p>dwell among men. 89</p>
<p>A century later Elizabeth of Thuringia ( 1 207-3 1 ) aroused Hungary
with her brief life of ascetic sanctity. Daughter of King Andrew, she
was married at thirteen to a German prince, was a mother at fourteen, a
widow at twenty. Her brother-in-law despoiled her and drove her away
penniless. She became a wandering pietist, devoted to the poor; she
housed leprous women and washed their wounds. She too had heavenly
visions, but she gave them no publicity, and claimed no supernatural
powers. Meeting the fiery inquisitor Conrad of Marburg, she was morbidly
fascinated by his merciless devotion to orthodoxy; she became his
obedient slave; he beat her for the slightest devia- tion from his
concept of sanctity; she submitted humbly, inflicted additional
austerities upon herself, and died of them at twenty-four. 90 Her
reputation for saintliness was so great that at her funeral half-mad
devotees cut off her hair, ears, and nipples as sacred relics. 91
Another Elizabeth entered the Bene- dictine nunnery of Schonau, near
Bingen, at the age of twelve (1 141), and lived there till her death in
1165. Bodily infirmities and extreme asceticism generated trances, in
which she received heavenly revelations from various dead saints, nearly
all anticlerical. “The Lord’s vine has withered,” her guard - ian angel
told her; “the head of the Church is ill, and her members are dead….
Kings of the earth! the cry of your iniquity has risen even to me.”
92</p>
<p>Toward the end of this period the mystic tide ran high in
Germany.</p>
<p>Meister Eckhart, bom about 1260, would come to his ripe doctrine in
1326, to his trial and death in 1327. His pupils Suso and Tauler would
continue his mystic pantheism; and from that tradition of
unecclesiastical piety would flow one source of the Reformation.</p>
<p>Usually the Church bore patiently with the mystics in her fold. She
did not tolerate serious doctrinal deviations from the official line, or
the anarchic individualism of some religious sects; but she admitted the
claim of the mystics to a direct approach to God, and listened with good
humor to saintly denun- ciations of her human faults. Many clergymen,
even high dignitaries, sympa-</p>

<p>hized with the critics, recognized the shortcomings of the Church,
and wished that they too could lay down the contaminating tools and
tasks of world politics and enjoy the security and peace of monasteries
fed by the piety of the people and protected by the power of the Church.
Perhaps it was such patient ecclesiastics who kept Christianity steady
amid the delirious revelations that periodically threatened the medieval
mind. As we read the mystics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it
dawns upon us that ortho- doxy was often a barrier to contagious
superstitions, and that in one aspect the Church was belief — as the
state was force — organized from chaos into order to keep men sane.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE TRAGIC POPE</li>
</ol>
<p>When Gregory X came to the papacy in 1271 the Church was again at the
summit of her power. He was a Christian as well as a pope: a man of
peace and amity, seeking justice’rather than victory. Hoping to regain
Palestine by one united effort, he persuaded Venice, Genoa, and Bologna
to end their wars; he secured the election of Rudolf of Hapsburg as
Emperor, but soothed with courtesy and kindness the defeated candidates;
and he reconciled Guelf and Ghibelline in factious Florence and Siena,
saying to his Guelf supporters: “Your enemies are Ghibellines, but they
are also men, citizens, and Chris - tians.” 93 He summoned the prelates
of the Church to the Council of Lyons (1274); 1570 leading churchmen
came; every great state sent a representa- tive; the Greek emperor sent
the heads of the Greek Church to reaffirm its submission to the Roman
See; Latin and Greek churchmen sang together a Te Deum of joy. Bishops
were invited to list the abuses that needed reform in the Church; they
responded with startling candor; 94 and legislation was passed to
mitigate these evils. All Europe was magnificently united for a mighty
effort against the Saracens. But on the way back to Rome Gregory died
(1276). His successors were too busy with Italian politics to carry out
his plans.</p>
<p>Nevertheless when Boniface VIII was chosen pope in 1 294 the papacy
was still the strongest government in Europe, the best organized, the
best admin- istered, the richest in revenue. It was the misfortune of
the Church that at this juncture, nearing the end of a virile and
progressive century, the mightiest throne in Christendom should have
fallen to a man whose love of the Church, and sincerity of purpose, were
equaled by his imperfect morals, his personal pride, and his tactless
will to power. He was not without charm: he loved learning, and rivaled
Innocent III in legal training and wide culture; he founded the
University of Rome, and restored and extended the Vatican Library; he
gave commissions to Giotto and Arnolfo di Cambio, and helped finance the
amazing facade of Orvieto Cathedral.</p>
<p>He had prepared his own elevation by persuading the saintly but

<p>petent Celestine V to resign after a pontificate of five months — an
unprece- dented act that surrounded Boniface with ill will from the
start. To scotch all plans for a restoration, he ordered the
eighty-year-old Celestine to be kept in detention in Rome; Celestine
escaped, was captured, escaped again, wan- dered for weeks through
Apulia, reached the Adriatic, attempted a crossing to Dalmatia, was
wrecked, was cast ashore in Italy, and was brought before Boniface. He
was condemned by the Pope to imprisonment in a narrow cell at Ferentino;
and there, ten months later, he died ( 1 296) , 95</p>
<p>The temper of the new Pope was sharpened by a succession of
diplomatic defeats and costly victories. He tried to dissuade Frederick
of Aragon from accepting the throne of Sicily; when Frederick persisted
Boniface excom- municated him, and laid an interdict upon the island
(1296). Neither King nor people paid any heed to these censures; 96 and
in the end Boniface recog- nized Frederick. To prepare for a crusade he
ordered Venice and Genoa to sign a truce; they continued their war for
three years more, and rejected his intervention in making peace. Failing
to secure a favorable order in Florence, he placed the city under
interdict, and invited Charles of Valois to enter and pacify Italy ( 1
300). Charles accomplished nothing, but won the hatred of the
Florentines for himself and the Pope. Seeking peace in his own Papal
States, Boniface had attempted to settle a quarrel among the members of
the power- ful Colonna family; Pietro and Jacopo Colonna, both
cardinals, repudiated his suggestions; he deposed and excommunicated
them (1297); whereupon the rebellious nobles affixed to the doors of
Roman churches, and laid upon the altar of St. Peter’s, a manifesto
appealing from the Pope to a general coun - cil. Boniface repeated the
excommunication, extended it to five other rebels, ordered their
property confiscated, invaded the Colonna domain with papal troops,
captured its fortresses, razed Palestrina to the ground, and had salt
strewn over its ruins. The rebels surrendered, were forgiven, revolted
again, were again beaten by the warrior Pope, fled from the Papal
States, and planned revenge.</p>
<p>Amid these Italian tribulations Boniface was suddenly confronted by a
major crisis in France. Philip IV, resolved to unify his realm, had
seized the English province of Gascony; Edward I had declared war
(1294); now, to finance their struggle, both kings decided to tax the
property and personnel of the Church. The popes had permitted such
taxation for crusades, but never for a purely secular war. The French
clergy had recognized their duty of contributing to the defense of the
state that protected their possessions, but they feared that if the
power of the state to tax were unchecked, it would be a power to
destroy. Philip had already reduced the role of the clergy in France; he
had removed them from the manorial and royal courts, and from their old
posts in the administration of the government and in the council of the
king. Disturbed by this trend, the Cistercian Order refused to send
Philip the fifth of their revenues which he had asked for the war with
England, and its head</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) MONKS AND FRIARS 8 1 3</p>
<p>addressed an appeal to the Pope. Boniface had to move carefully, for
France had long been the chief support of the papacy in the struggle
with Germany and the Empire; but he felt that the economic basis of the
power and freedom of the Church would soon be lost if she could be shorn
of her revenues by state taxation of Church property without papal
consent. In February, 1 296, he issued one of the most famous bulls in
ecclesiastical history. Its first words, Clericis laicos , gave it a
name, its first sentence made an unwise admission, and its tone recalled
the papal bolts of Gregory VII:</p>
<p>Antiquity reports that laymen are exceedingly hostile to the
clergy;</p>
<p>and our experience certainly shows this to be true at present
With</p>
<p>he counsel of our brethren, and by our apostolic authority, we decree
that if any clergy… shall pay to laymen… any part of their income or
possessions… without the permission of the pope, they shall incur</p>
<p>excommunication And we also decree that all persons of whatever</p>
<p>power or rank, who shall demand or receive such taxes, or shall seize
or cause to be seized, the property of churches or of the clergy…</p>
<p>shall incur excommunication. 97</p>
<p>Philip for his part was convinced that the great wealth of the Church
in France should share in the costs of the state. He countered the papal
bull by prohibiting the export of gold, silver, precious stones, or
food, and by forbid- ding foreign merchants or emissaries to remain in
France. These measures blocked a main source of papal revenue, and
banished from France the papal agents who were raising funds for a
crusade in the East. In the bull Ineffabilis amor (September, 1296)
Boniface retreated; he sanctioned voluntary con- tributions from the
clergy for the necessary defense of the state, and con- ceded the right
of the King to be the judge of such a necessity. Philip rescinded his
retaliatory ordinances; he and Edward accepted Boniface — not as pope
but as a private person — as arbitrator of their dispute; Boniface de-
cided most of the issues in Philip’s favor; England yielded for the
moment; and the three warriors enjoyed a passing peace.</p>
<p>Perhaps to replenish the papal treasury after the decline of receipts
from England and France, perhaps to finance a war for the recovery of
Sicily as a papal fief, and another war to extend the Papal States into
Tuscany, 98 Boni- face proclaimed 1300 as a jubilee year. The plan was a
complete success. Rome had never in its history seen such crowds before;
now, apparently for the first time, traffic rules were enforced to
govern the movement of the people. 99 Boniface and his aides managed the
affair well; food was brought in abundantly and was sold at moderate
prices papally controlled. It was an advantage for the Pope that the
great sums so collected were not earmarked for any special purpose, but
could be used according to his judgment. De- spite half victories and
severe defeats, Boniface was now at the crest of his curve.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, the Colonna exiles were entertaining
Philip</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>814</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xwith tales of the Pope’s greed, injustice, and private heresies. A
quarrel arose between Philip’s aides and a papal legate, Bernard
Saisset; the legate was ar - rested on a charge of inciting to
insurrection; he was tried by the royal court, convicted, and committed
to the custody of the archbishop of Narbonne (1301). Boniface, shocked
by this summary treatment of his legate, de- manded Saisset’s immediate
release, and instructed the French clergy to suspend payment of
ecclesiastical revenues to the state. In the bull Ausculta fili
(“Listen, son”; December, 1 301) he appealed to Philip to listen
modestly to the Vicar of Christ as the spiritual monarch over all the
kings of the earth; he protested against the trial of a churchman before
a civil court, and the continued use of ecclesiastical funds for secular
purposes; and he announced that he would summon the bishops and abbots
of France to take measures “for the preservation of the liberties of the
Church, the reformation of the</p>
<p>On February 1 1, 1302, the bull Ausculta fili was officially burned
at Paris before the King and a great multitude. To forestall the
ecclesiastical council proposed by Boniface, Philip summoned the fhree
estates of his realm to meet at Paris in April. At this first
States-General in French history all three classes — nobles, clergy, and
commons — wrote separately to Rome in defense of the King and his
temporal power. Some forty-five French prelates, despite Philip’ s
prohibition, and the confiscation of their property, attended the
council at Rome in October, 1 302. From that council issued the bull
Unam sanctum, which made arrestingly specific the claims of the papacy.
There is, said the bull, but one true Church, outside of which there is
no salvation; there is but one body of Christ, with one head, not two;
that head is Christ and His representative, the Roman pope. There are
two swords or powers — the spiritual and the temporal; the first is
borne by the Church; the second is borne for the Church by the king, but
under the will and sufferance of the priest. The spiritual power is
above the temporal, and has the right to instruct it regarding its
highest end, and to judge it when it does evil. “We declare - vation
that all men should be subject to the Roman pontiff.” 102</p>
<p>Philip replied by calling two assemblies (March and June, 1303),
which drew up a formal indictment of Boniface as a tyrant, sorcerer,
murderer, embezzler, adulterer, sodomite, simoniac, idolator, and
infidel, 103 and de-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) MONKSANDFRIARS 8 1 5</p>
<p>manded his deposition by a general council of the Church. The King
com- missioned William of Nogaret, his chief legist, to go to Rome and
notify the Pope of the King’s appeal to a general council. Boniface,
then in the papal palace at Anagni, declared that only the pope could
call a general council, and prepared a decree excommunicating Philip and
laying an interdict upon France. Before he could issue it William of
Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna, heading a band of 2000 mercenaries, burst
into the palace, presented Philip’s message of notification, and
demanded the Pope’s resignation (September 7,</p>
<p>1303). B oniface refused. A tradition “of considerable
trustworthiness” 104 says that Sciarra struck the Pontiff in the face,
and would have killed him had not Nogaret intervened. Boniface was
seventy-five years old, physically weak, but still defiant. For three
days he was kept a prisoner in his palace, while the mercenaries
plundered it. Then the people of Anagni, reinforced by 400 horsemen from
the Orsini clan, scattered the mercenaries and freed the Pope.
Apparently his jailers had given him no food in the three days; for
standing in the market place he begged: “If there be any good woman who
would give me an alms of wine and bread, I would bestow upon her God’s
blessing and mine.” The Orsini led him to Rome and the Vatican. There he
fell into a violent fever; and in a few days he died (October 1 1,
1303).</p>
<p>His successor, Benedict XI (1303-4), excommunicated Nogaret, Sciarra
Colonna, and thirteen others whom he had seen breaking into the palace
at Anagni. A month later Benedict died at Perugia, apparently poisoned
by Italian Ghibellines. 105 Philip agreed to support Bertrand de Got,
Archbishop of Bordeaux, for the papacy if he would adopt a conciliatory
policy, absolve those who had been excommunicated for the attack upon
Boniface, allow an annual income tax.of ten per cent to be levied upon
the French clergy for five years, restore the Colonnas to their offices
and property, and condemn the memory of Boniface. 106 We do not know how
far Bertrand consented. He was chosen Pope, and took the name of Clement
V (1305). The cardinals warned him that his life would be unsafe in
Rome; and after some hesitation, and perhaps a pointed suggestion from
Philip, Clement removed the papal seat to Avignon, on the east bank of
the Rhone just outside the southeastern boundary of France (1309). So
began the sixty- eight years of the “Baby - lonian Captivity” of the
popes. The papacy had freed itself from Germany, and surrendered to
France.</p>
<p>Clement, against his weak will, became the humiliated tool of the
insatiable Philip. He absolved the King, restored the Colonna family,
withdrew the bull Clericislaicos, allowed the spoliation of the
Templars, and finally (1310) consented to a post-mortem trial of
Boniface by an ecclesiastical consistory at Groseau, near Avignon. In
the preliminary examinations held before the Pope and his commissioners,
six ecclesiastics testified to having heard Boni- face, a year before
his pontificate, remark that all supposedly divine laws</p>
<p>8 1 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xwere inventions of men to keep the common people in good behavior
through fear of hell; that it was “fatuous” to believe that God was at
once one and three, or that a virgin had borne a child, or that God had
become a man, or that bread could be changed into the body of Christ, or
that there was a future life. “So I believe and so I hold, as doth every
educated man. The vulgar hold otherwise. We must speak as the vulgar do,
and think and believe with the few.” So these six quoted Boniface, and
thr ee of them, later re-examined, repeated their testimony. The Prior
of St. Giles at San Gemino reported that Boniface, as Cardinal Gaetani,
had denied the resurrection of either body or soul; and several other
ecclesiastics confirmed this testimony. One ecclesiastic quoted Boniface
as saying, of the consecrated Host, “It is mere paste.” Men formerly
belonging to the household of Boniface accused him of repeated sexual
sins, natural and unnatural; others accused the supposed skeptic of
attempting magic al communication with the “powers of darkness.” 107
Before the actual trial could be held, Clement persuaded Philip to leave
the question of Boniface’s guilt to the coming ecumenical Council of
Vienne.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>RETROSPECT</li>

<p>The testimony against Boniface, true or false, reveals the
undercurrent of skepticism that was preparing to end the Age of Faith.
Likewise the blow- physical or political — given Boniface VIII at Anagni
marks in one sense the beginning of “modern times”: it was the victory
of nationalism against super - nationalism, of the state against the
Church, of the power of the sword over the magic of the word. The papacy
had been weakened by its struggle against the Hohenstaufens, and by the
failure of the Crusades. France and England had been strengthened by the
collapse of the Empire, and France had been enriched by acquiring
Languedoc with the help of the Church. Perhaps the popular support given
to Philip IV against Boniface VIII reflected public resentment of the
excesses of the Inquisition and the Albigensian Crusade. Some of Nogaret
l s ancestors, it was said, had been burned by the inquisi- tors. 108
Boniface had not realized, in undertaking so many conflicts, that the
weapons of the papacy had been blunted by overuse. Industry and commerce
had generated a class less pious than the peasantry; life and thought
were be- coming secularized; the laity was coming into its own. For
seventy years now the state would absorb the Church.</p>
<p>Looking back over the panorama of Latin Christianity, we are
impressed, above all, by the relative unanimity of religious faith among
diverse peoples,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) MONKS AND FRIARS 817</p>
<p>and the overspreading hierarchy and power of the Roman Church, giving
to Western Europe — non-Slavic, non-Byzantine Europe — a unity of mind
and morals such as it has never known again. Nowhere else in history has
an organization wielded so profound an influence over so many men for so
long a time. The authority of the Roman Republic and Empire over its
immense realm endured from Pompey to Alaric, 480 years; that of the
Mongol Em- pire or the British Empire, some 200 years; but the Roman
Catholic Church was the dominant force in Europe from the death of
Charlemagne (814) to the death of Boniface VIII ( 1 303) — 489 years.
Her organization and adminis- tration do not appear to have been as
competent as that of the Roman Empire, nor was her personnel as capable
or cultured as the men who gov- erned the provinces and cities for the
Caesars; but the Church inherited a barbarous bedlam, and had to find a
laborious way back to order and educa- tion. Even so her clergy were the
best instructed men of the age, and it was they who provided the only
education available in Western Europe during the five centuries of her
supremacy. Her courts offered the justest justice of their time. Her
papal Curia, sometimes venal, sometimes incorruptible, con- stituted in
some degree a world court for the arbitration of international disputes
and the limitation of war; and though that court was always too Italian,
the Italians were the best trained minds of those centuries, and any man
could rise to membership in that court from any rank and nation in Latin
Christendom.</p>
<p>Despite the chicanery usually accompanying collective human power, it
was good that above the states and kings of Europe there should be an
authority that could call them to account and moderate their strife. If
any world state was to be, what could seem fitter than that its seat
should be the throne of Peter, whence men, however limited, could see
with a continental eye and from the background of centuries? What
decisions would be more peaceably accepted, or could be more easily
enforced, than those of a pontiff revered as the Vicar of God by nearly
all the population of Western Europe? When Louis IX left on crusade in 1
248, Henry III of England made extreme demands upon France, and prepared
to invade; Pope Innocent IV threatened England with interdict should
Henry persist; and Henry refrained. The power of the Church, said the
skeptical Hume, was a rampart of refuge against the tyranny and
injustice of kings. 109 The Church might have realized the high
conception of Gregory VII — might have made her moral power su- preme
over the physical forces of the states — had she used her influence only
for spiritual and moral purposes, and never for material ends. When
Urban II united Christendom against the Turks the dream of Gregory was
almost realized; but when Innocent III, Gregory IX, Alexander IV, and
Boniface VIII gave the holy name of crusade to their wars against the
Albigensians, Frederick II, and the Colonnas, the great ideal broke to
pieces in papal hands stained with Christian blood.</p>
<p>8 1 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XWhere the Church was not threatened she responded with considerable
tolerance for diverse, even heretical, views. We shall find an
unexpected free- dom of thought among the philosophers of the twelfth
and thirteenth cen- turies, even among professors at universities
chartered and supervised by the Church. All that she asked was that such
discussions should be confined and intelligible only to the educated,
and should not take the form of revolution- a ry appeals to the people
to abandon their creed or the Church. 110 “The Church,” says her most
industrious recent critic, “as it embraced the whole population,
embraced also every type of mind, from the most superstitious to the
most agnostic; and many of these unorthodox elements worked far more
freely, under the cloak of outward conformity, than is generally sup-
posed.” 111</p>
<p>All in all, the picture that we form of the medieval Latin Church is
that of a complex organization doing its best, despite the human
frailties of its adherents and its leaders, to establish moral and
social order, and to spread an uplifting and consoling faith, amid the
wreckage of an old civilization and the passions of an adolescent
society. The sixth-century Church found Eu- rope a flotsam of migratory
barbarians, a babel of tongues and creeds, a chaos of unwritten and
incalculable laws. She gave it a moral code buttressed with supernatural
sanctions strong enough to check the unsocial impulses of vio- lent men;
she offered it monastic retreats for men, women, and classic manu-
scripts; she governed it with episcopal courts, educated it with schools
and universities, and tamed the kings of the earth to moral
responsibility and the tasks of peace. She brightened the lives of her
children with poetry, drama, and song, and inspired them to raise the
noblest works of art in history. Un- able to establish a utopia of
equality among unequally able men, she organized charity and
hospitality, and in some measure protected the weak from the strong. She
was, beyond question, the greatest civilizing force in medieval European
history.</p>
