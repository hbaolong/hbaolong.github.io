<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>The Great Migration</p>
<p>I. CAUSES AND WAYS</p>
<p>I N carrying the story of Sparta and Athens down to the eve of Mara-
thon we have sacrificed the unity of time to the unity of place. It
is</p>
<p>true that the cities of the mainland were older than the Greek
settlements in the Aegean and Ionia, and that these cities, in many
cases, sent out the colonies whose life we must now describe. But, by a
confusing inversion of normal sequences, several of those colonies
became greater than their mother cities, and preceded them in the
development of wealth and art. The real creators of Greek culture were
not the Greeks of what we now call Greece, but those who fled before the
conquering Dorians, fought des- perately for a foothold on foreign
shores, and there, out of their Myce- naean memories and their amazing
energy, made the art and science, the philosophy and poetry that, long
before Marathon, placed them in the forefront of the Western world.
Greek civilization was inherited by the parent cities from their
children.</p>
<p>There is nothing more vital in the history of the Greeks than their
rapid spread throughout the Mediterranean.* They had been nomadic before
Homer, and all the Balkan peninsula had seemed fluid with this movement,
but the successive Greek waves that broke upon the Aegean isles and the
western coasts of Asia were stirred up above all by the Dorian invasion.
From every part of Hellas men went out in search of homes and liberty
beyond the grasp of the enslaving conquerors. Political faction and
family feud in the older states contributed to the migration; the
defeated some- times chose exile, and the victors gave every
encouragement to their exodus. Some of the Greek survivors of the Trojan
War stayed in Asia; others, through shipwreck or adventure, settled in
the islands of the Aegean; some, reaching home after a perilous journey,
found their thrones or their wives occupied, and returned to their ships
to build new homes and fortunes abroad.” In mainland Greece, as in
modern Europe, c olonization proved a blessing in varied ways: it
provided outlets for surplus population and</p>
<p>• Cf. Pater; “Perhaps the most brilliant and animating episode in the
entire history of Greece — its early colonization.”^</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>128 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.Vl</p>
<p>adventurous spirits, and safety valves against agrarian discontent;
it estab- lished foreign markets for domestic products, and strategic
depots for the import of food and minerals. In the end it created a
commercial empire whose thriving interchange of goods, arts, ways, and
thoughts made pos- sible the complex culture of Greece.</p>
<p>The migration followed five main lines — Aeolian, Ionian, Dorian,
Euxine, Italian. The earliest began in the northern states of the
mainland, which were the first to feel the brunt of the invasions from
the north and the west. From Thessaly, Phthiotis, Boeotia, and Aetolia,
throughout the twelfth and eleventh centuries, a stream of immigrants
moved slowly across the Aegean to the region about Troy, and founded
there the twelve cities of the Aeolian League. The second line took its
start in the Peloponnesus, whence thousands of Mycenaeans and Achaeans
fled on the “Return of the Heraclids.” Some of thei.i settled in Attica,
some in Euboea; many of them moved out into the Cyclades, ventured
across the Aegean, and established in western Asia Minor the twelve
cities of the Ionian Dodecapolis. The third line was followed by Dorians
who overflowed the Peloponnesus into the Cyclades, conquered Crete and
Cyrene, and set up a Dorian Hexapolis around the island of Rhodes. The
fourth line, starting anywhere in Greece, settled the coast of Thrace,
and built a hundred cities on the shores of the Hellespont, the
Propontis, and the Euxine Sea. The fifth line moved west- ward to what
the Greeks called the Ionian Isles, thence across to Italy and Sicily,
and finally to Gaul and Spain.</p>
<p>Only a sympathetic imagination or a keen recollection of our own</p>
<p>colonial history can visualize the difiiculties that were surmounted
in this century-long migration. It was an adventure of high moment to
leave the land consecrated by the graves of one’s ancestors and guarded
by one’s hereditary deities, and go forth into strange regions
unprotected, pre- sumably, by the gods of Greece. Therefore the
colonists took with them a handful of earth from their native state to
strew upon the alien soil, and solemnly carried fire from the public
altar of their mother city to light the civic fire at the hearth of
their new settlement. The chosen site was on or near a shore, where
ships — the second home of half the Greeks — might serve as a refuge
from attack by land; better still if it were a coastal plain pro- tected
by mountains that provided a barrier in the rear, an acropolis for
defense in the town, and a promontory-sheltered harbor in the sea; best
of all if such a haven could be found on some commercial route, or by a
river mouth that received the products of the interior for export or ex-
change; then prosperity was only a matter of time. Good sites were
nearly</p>
<p>THE GREAT MIGRATION</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>always occupied, and had to be conquered by stratagem or force; the
Greeks, in such matters, recognized no morals loftier than our own* In
some cases the conquerors reduced the prior inhabitants to slavery, with
all the irony of pilgrims seeking freedom; more often they made friends
of the natives by bringing them Greek gifts, charming them with a su-
perior culture, courting their women, and adopting their gods; the
colonial Greeks did not bother about purity of race,* and could always
find in their teeming pantheon some deity sufficiently like the local
divinity to facilitate a religious entente. Above ail, the colonists
offered the products of the Greek handicrafts to the natives, secured
grain, cattle, or minerals in return, and exported these throughout the
Mediterranean — preferably to the me- tropolis, or mother city, from
which the settlers had come, and to which they retained for centuries a
certain filial piety.</p>
<p>One by one these colonies took form, until Greece was no longer the
narrow peninsula of Homeric days, but a strangely loose association of
independent cities scattered from Africa to Thrace and from Gibraltar to
the eastern end of the Black Sea. It was an epochal performance for the
women of Greece; we shall not always find them so ready to have
children. Through these busy centers of vitality and intelligence the
Greeks spread into all of southern Europe the seeds of that subtle and
precarious luxury called civilization, without which life would have no
beauty, and history no meaning.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE I01«AN CYCLADES</li>

<p>Sailing south from the Piraeus along the Attic coast, and beating
east around Sunium’s templed promontory, the traveler reaches the littl
e isle of Ceos, where, if we may believe the incredible on the authority
of Strabo and Plutarch, “there was once a law that appears to have
commanded those who were sixty years of age to drink hemlock, in order
that the food might be sufficient for the rest,” and “there was no
memory of a case of adultery or seduction over a period of seven hundred
years.”*</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why her greatest poet exiled himself from Ceos after
reaching middle age; he might have found it difficult to attain, at
home, the eighty-seven years that Greek tradition gives him. All the
Hellenic world knew Simonides at thirty, and when he died, in 469, he
was by common consent the most brilliant writer of his time. His fame as
poet and singer won him an invitation from Hipparchus, codictator of
Athens,</p>
<p>*30 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.VI</p>
<p>at whose court he found it possible to live in amity with another
poet, Anacreon. He survived the war with Persia, and was chosen again
and again to write epitaphs for memorials of the honored dead. In his
old age he lived at the court of Hieron I, dictator of Syracuse; and his
repute was then so high that in 475 he made peace in the field between
Hieron and Theron, dictator of Acragas, as hostilities were about to
begin.’ Plutarch, in his perennially pertinent essay on “Should Old Men
Govern?” tells us that Simonides continued to win the prize for lyric
poetry and choral song into very old age. When finally he consented to
die he was buried at Acragas with the honors of a king.</p>
<p>He was a personality as well as a poet, and the Greeks denounced and
loved him for his vices and eccentricities. He had a passion for money,
and his muse was dumb in the absence of gold. He was the first to write
poetry for pay, on the ground that poets had as much right to eat as
anyone else; but the practice was new to Greece, and Aristophanes echoed
the resentment of the public when he said that Simonides “would go to
sea on a hurdle to earn a groat.”’ He prided himself on having invented
a system o f mnemonics, which Cicero adopted gratefully;’ its essential
principle lay in arranging the things to be remembered into some logical
classification and sequence, so that each item would naturally lead to
the next. He was a wit, and his sharp repartees passed like a mental
currency among the cities of Greece; but in his old age he remarked that
he had often repented of speaking, but never of holding his tongue.’</p>
<p>We are surprised to find, in the extant fragments of a poet so widely
acclaimed and so liberally rewarded, that indispersible gloom which
broods over so much of Greek literature after Homer — in whose days men
were too active to be pessimists, and too violent to be bored.</p>
<p>Few and evil are the days of our life; but everlasting will be
our</p>
<p>sleep beneath the earth. . . . Small is the strength of man, and
in-</p>
<p>vincible are his errors; grief treads upon the heels of grief
through</p>
<p>his short life; and death, whom no man escapes, hangs over him at</p>
<p>last; to this come good and bad alike. . . . Nothing human is
ever-</p>
<p>lasting. Well said the bard of Chios that the life of man is even
as</p>
<p>that of a green leaf; yet few who hear this bear it in mind, for
hope</p>
<p>is strong in the breast of the young. When youth is in flower,
and</p>
<p>the heart of man is light, he nurses idle thought, hoping he will
never grow old or die; nor does he think of sickness in good health.
Fools</p>
<p>are they who dream thus, nor know how short are the days of our</p>
<p>youth and our life.’</p>
<p>CHAP.Vl) THE GREAT MIGRATION 131</p>
<p>No hope of Blessed Isles comforts Simonides, and the divinities of
Olympus, like those of Christianity in some modern verse, have become
instruments of poetry rather than consolations of the soul. When Hieron
challenged him to define the nature and attributes of God he asked for a
day’s time to prepare his answer, and the next day begged for two days
more, and on each occasion doubled the period that he required for
thought. When at last Hieron demanded an explanation, Simonides replied
that the longer he pondere d the matter the more obscure it became.“</p>
<p>Out of Ceos came not only Simonides, but his nephew and lyric succes-
sor Bacchylides, and, in Alexandrian days, the great anatomist
Erasistratus. We cannot say so much for Seriphos, or Andros, or Tenos,
or Myconos, or Sicinos, or los. On Syros lived Pherecydes (ca. 550), who
was reputed to have taught Pythagoras, and to have been the first
philosopher to write in prose. On Delos, said Greek story, Apollo
himself had been born. So sacred was the island as his sanctuary that
both death and birth were for- bidden within its borders; those about to
give birth or to die were hurriedly conveyed from its shores; and all
known graves were emptied that the island might be purified.” There,
after the repulse of the Persians, Athens and her Ionian allies would
keep the treasure of the Delian Confederacy; there, every fourth year,
the lonians met in pious but convivial assemblage to celebrate the
festival of the handsome god. A seventh-century hymn describes the
“women with fine girdles,”” the eager merchants busy at their booths,
the crowds lining the road to watch the sacred procession; the tense
ritual and solemn sacrifice in the temple; the joyous dances and choral
hymns of Delian and Athenian maidens chosen for their comeliness as well
as their song; the athletic and musical contests, and the plays in the
thea- ter under the open sky. Annually the Athenians sent an embassy to
Delos to celebrate Apollo’s birthday; and no criminal might be executed
in Ath - ens until this embassy’s return. Hence the long interval, so
fortunate for literature and philosophy, between the conviction of
Socrates and his exe- cution.</p>
<p>Naxos is the largest, as Delos is almost the smallest, of the
Cyclades. It was famous for its wine and its marble, and became rich
enough, in the sixth century, to have its own navy and its own school of
sculpture. South- east of Naxos lies Amorgos, home of the unamiable
Semonides, whose ungallant satire on women has been carefully preserved
by man-written history.* To the west lies Paros, almost composed of
marble; its citizens</p>
<p>• Semonides compares women now to foxes, asses, pigs, and the
changeful sea, and swears that no husband has ever passed through a day
without some word of censure from his wife.“</p>
<p>132 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>made their homes of it, and Praxiteles found there the translucent
stone which he would carve and polish into the warmth and texture of
human flesh. On this island, about the end of the eighth century,
Archilochus was bom, son of a slave woman, but one of the greatest lyric
singers of Greece. A soldier’s fortune led him north to Thasos where, in
a battle with the natives, he found his heels more valuable than his
shield; he took to the one and abandoned the other, and lived to turn
many a merry quip about his flight. Back in Paros he fell in love with
Neobule, daughter of the rich Lycambes. He describes her as a modest
lass with tresses falling over her shoulders, and sighs, as so many
centuries have sighed, “only to touch her hand.’”* But Lycambes,
admiring the poet’s verses more than his income, put an end to the
affair; whereupon Archilochus aimed at him and Neobule and her sister
such barbs of satiric verse that all three of them, legend as- sures us,
hanged themselves. Archilochus turned his back sourly upon the “figs and
fishes” of Paros, and became again a soldier of fortune. Finally, his
heels having failed him, he was killed in battle against the
Naxians.</p>
<p>We learn from his poems that he was a man of rough speech to both
friends and foes, with a disappointed lover’s penchant for adultery.“ We
picture him as an inspired pirate, a melodious buccaneer coarse in prose
and polished in verse; taking the iambic meter already popular in folk
songs and fashioning it into short and stinging lines of six feet; this
was the “iambic trimeter” that would become the classic medium of Greek
tragedy. He experimented gaily with dactylic hexameters, trochaic
tetrameters, and a dozen other meters,* and gave to Greek poetry the
metrical forms that it would keep to the end. Only a few broken lines
survive, and we must accept the word of the ancients that he was the
most popular of all Greek poets after Homer. Horace loved to imitate his
technical diversities; and the great Hellenistic critic, Aristophanes of
Byzantium, when asked which of Archilochus’ poems he liked best, voiced
in two words the feeling of Greece when he answered, “The longest.”“</p>
<p>A morning’s sail west of Paros is Siphnos, fam ous for its mines of
silver and gold. These were owned by the people through their
government. The yield was so rich that the island could set up at Delphi
the Siphnian Treasury with its placid caryatides, erect many another
monument, and yet distribute a substantial balance among the citizens at
the end of every</p>
<p>•Longfellow’s Evangeline^ his Hiawatha, and the final line of each
stanza in Childe HarolcTs Pilgriinage, by Byron, may serve as examples
respectively of dactylic hexameter, trochaic tetrameter, and iambic
trimeter.</p>

<p>year.“^ In 524 a band of freebooters from Samos landed on the island
and exacted a tribute of a hundred talents — the equivalent of 00,000
today. The rest of Greece accepted this heroic robbery with the
equanimity and fortitude with which men are accustomed to bear the
misfortunes of their friends.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE DORIAN OVERFLOW</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dorians, too, colonized the Cyclades, and tamed their warlike
spirits to terrace the mountain slopes patiently, that the parsimonious
rain might be held and coaxed to nourish their crops and vines. In Melos
they took over from their Bronze Age predecessors the quarrying of
obsidian, and made the island so prosperous that the Athenians, as we
shall see, spared no pains to Melos to win its support in the struggle
with Sparta. Here, in 1820, was found that Aphrodite of Melos* which is
now the most famous statue in the Western world.</p>
<p>Moving east and then south, the Dorians conquered Thera and Crete,
and from Thera sent a further colony to Cyrene. A few of them settled in
Cyprus, where, from the eleventh century, a small colony of Arcadian
Greeks had struggled for mastery against the old Phoenician dynasties.
It was one of these Phoenician kinglets, Pygmalion, of whom legend told
how he so admired an ivory Aphrodite carved by his hands that he fell in
love with it, begged the goddess to give it life, and married his
creation when the goddess complied.^ The coming of iron probably
lessened the demand for Cyprian copper, and left the island off the main
line of Greek economic advance. The cutting of the timber by the natives
to burn the copper ore, by the Phoenicians for ships and by the Greeks
for agricultural clearings, slowly transformed Cyprus into the hot and
half-barren derelict that it is today. The art of the island, like its
population, was in the Greek period a medley of Egyptian, Phoenician,
and Hellenic influences, and never attained a homogeneous character of
its own.t The Dorians were but a minority of the Greek population in
Cyprus; but in Rhodes and the southern Sporades and on the adjoining
mainland they became the ruling class. Rhodes prospered in the centuries
between Homer and Marathon, though its zenith w’ould not come till the
Hellenistic age. On a promontory jutting out from Asia, Dorian settlers
developed the city of Cnidus,</p>

Italian name of the</p>

the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A bilingual tablet unearthed
by British scholars in 1868 enabled them to decipher Cypriote writing as
a dialect of Greek expressed by syllabic signs; but the results have not
added anything of interest to universal history.</p>

<p>well situated to be a port of the coastal trade. Here the astronomer
Eudoxus would be bom, and the lystorian (or fabulist) Ctesias, and that
Sostrams who was to build the Pharos at Alexandria. Here, among the
ruins of ancient tem- ples, would be found the sad and matronly Demeter
of the British Museum.</p>
<p>Opposite Cnidus lay the island of Cos, home of Hippocrates and rival
of Cnidus as a center of Greek medical science. Apelles the painter
would be born here, and Theocritus the poet. A little to the north, on
the coast, was Hali- carnassus, birthplace of Herodotus and royal seat,
in Hellenistic days, of the Carian King Mausolus and his fond Artemisia.
This city, with Cos and Cnidus and the chief towns of Rhodes (Lindus,
Camims, and lalysus) formed the Dorian Hexapolis, or Six Cities, of Asia
Minor — weak rivals, for a time, of the Twelve Cities of Ionia.</p>

</ol>
<p>Running northwest of Caria for some ninety miles was the strip of
moun- tainous coastland, twenty to thirty miles wide, anciently known as
Ionia. Here, said Herodotus, “the air and climate are the most beautiful
in the whole world. ’”“ Its cities lay for the most part at the mouths
of rivers, or at the ends of roads, that carried the goods of the
hinterland down to the Mediterranean for shipment everywhere.</p>
<p>Miletus, southernmost of the Ionian Twelve, was in the sixth century
the richest city of the Greek world. The site had been inhabited by
Carians from Minoan days; and when, about looo b.c., the lonians came
there from Attica, they found the old Aegean culture, though in a
decadent form, waiting to serve as the advanced starting point of their
civilization. They brought no women with them to Miletus, but merely
killed the native males and married the widows;” the fusion of cultures
began with a fusion of blood. Like most of the Ionian cities, Miletus
submitted at first to kings who led them in war, then to aristocrats who
owned the land, then to “tyrants” representing the middle class. Under
the dictator Thrasybulus, at the beginning of the sixth century,
industry and trade reached their peak, and the growingwealth of Miletus
flowered forth in literature, philosophy, and art. Wool was brought down
from the rich pasture lands of the</p>
<p>interior, and turned into clothing in the textile mills of the city.
Taking a lesson from the Phoenicians and gradually bettering their
instruction, Ionian merchants established colonies as trading posts in
Egypt, Italy, the</p>
<p>CHAP.Vl) THE GREAT MIGRATION I35</p>
<p>Propontis, and the Euxine. Miletus alone had eighty such colonies,
sixty of them in the north. From Abydos, Cyzicus, Sinope, Olbia,
Trapezus, and Dioscurias, Miletus drew flax, timber, fruit, and metals,
and paid for these with the products of her handicrafts. The wealth and
luxury of the city became a proverb and a scandal throughout Greece.
Milesian merchants, overflowing with profits, lent money to enterprises
far and wide, and to the municipality itself. They were the Medici of
the Ionian Renaissance.</p>
<p>It was in this stimulating environment that Greece first developed
two of its most characteristic gifts to the world — science and
philosophy. The crossroads of trade are the meeting place of ideas, the
attrition ground of rival customs and beliefs; diversities beget
conflict, comparison, thought; superstitions cancel one another, and
reason begins. Here in Miletus, as later in Athens, were men from a
hundred scattered states; mentally active through competitive commerce,
and freed from the bondage of tradition by long, absences from their
native altars and homes. Milesians themselves traveled to distant
cities, and had their eyes opened by the civilizations of Lydia,
Babylonia, Phoenicia, and Egypt; in this way, among others, Egyp- tian
geometry and Babylonian astronomy entered the Greek mind. Trade and
mathematics, foreign commerce and geography, navigation and astron- omy,
developed hand in hand. Meanwhile wealth had created leisure; an
aristocracy of culture was growing up in which freedom of thought was
tolerated because only a small minority could read. No powerful
priesthood, no ancient and inspired text lim ited men’s thinking; even
the Homeric poems, which were to become in some sense the Bible of the
Greeks, had hardly taken yet a definite form; and in that final form
their mythology was to bear the imprint of Ionian skepticism and
scandalous merriment. Here for the first time thought became secular,
and sought rational and consistent answers to the problems of the world
and man.*</p>
<p>Nevertheless the new plant, mutation though it was, had its roots and
ancestry. The hoary wisdom of Egyptian priests and Persian Magi, per-
haps even of Hindu seers, the sacerdotal science of the Chaldeans, the
poetically personified cosmogony of Hesiod, were mingled with the natu-
ral realism of Phoenician and Greek merchants to produce Ionian philoso-
phy. Greek religion itself had paved the way by talking of Moira, or
Fate, as ruler of both gods and men: here was that idea of law, as
superior to incalculable personal decree, which would mark the essential
difference between science and mythology, as well as between despotism
and democ-</p>

<p>racy. Man became free when he recognized that he was subject to law.
That the Greeks, so far as our knowledge goes, were the first to achieve
this recognition and this freedom in both philosophy and government is
the secret of their accomplishment, and of their importance in
history.</p>
<p>Since life proceeds by heredity as well as by variation, by
stabilizing cus - tom as well as by experimental innovation, it was to
be expected that the religious roots of philosophy would form as well as
feed it, and there should remain in it, to the very end, a vigorous
element of theology. Two cur- rents run side by side in the history of
Greek philosophy: one naturalistic, the other mystical. The latter
stemmed from Pythagoras, and ran through Parmenides, Heracleitus, Plato,
and Cleanthes to Plotinus and St. Paul; the other had its first world
figure in Thales, and passed down through Anaxi- mander, Xenophanes,
Protagoras, Hippocrates, and Democritus to Epicurus and Lucretius. Now
and then some great spirit — Socrates, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius —
merged the two currents in an attempt to do justice to the un-
formulable complexity of life. But even in these men the dominant
strain, characteristic of Greek thought, was the love and pursuit of
reason.</p>
<p>Thales was bom about 640, probably at Miletus, reputedly of Phoeni-
cian parentage,” and derived much of his education fr om Egypt and the
Near East; here, as if personified, we see the transit of culture from
East to West. He appears to have engaged in business only so far as to
provide himself with the ordinary goods of life; everyone knows the
story of his successful speculation in oil presses.* For the rest he
gave himself to study, with the absorbed devotion suggested by the tale
of his falling into a ditch while watching the stars. Despite his
solitude, he interested himself in the affairs of his city, knew the
dictator Thrasybulus intimately, and advo- cated the federation of the
Ionian states for united defense against Lydia and Persia.”</p>
<p>To him tradition unanimously ascribed the introduction of
mathematical and astronomical science into Greece. Antiquity told how,
in Egypt, he calculated the heights of the pyramids by measuring their
shadows when a man’s shadow equaled his height. Returning to Ionia,
Thales pursued the fascinatingly logical study of geometry as a
deductive science, and demon-</p>
<ul>
<li>Let Arist otle tell the story: “They say that Thales, perceiving by
his skill in astrology (astronomy) that there would be great plenty of
olives that year, while it was yet winter hired at a low price all the
oil presses in Miletus and Chios, there being no one to bid against him.
But when the season came for making oil, many persons wanting them, he
all at once let them upon what terms he pleased; and raising a large sum
of money by that means, con- vinced them that it was easy for
philosophers to be rich if t hey chose it.”^</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.Vl) THE GREAT MIGRATION 137</p>
<p>strated several of the theorems later collected by Euclid.* As these
theorems founded Greek geometry, so his studies of astronomy established
that sci- ence for Western civilization, and disentangled it from its
Oriental asso- ciations with astrology. He made several minor
observations, and startled all Ionia by successfully predicting an
eclipse of the sun for May 28, 585 B,c.,“ probably on the basis of
Egyptian records and Babylonian calcula - tions. For the rest his theory
of the universe was not appreciably superior to the current cosmology of
the Egyptians and the Jews. The world, he thought, was a hemisphere
resting on an endless expanse of water, and the earth was a flat disk
floating on the flat side of the interior of this hemisphere. We are
reminded of Goethe’s remark that a man’s vices (or errors) are common to
him with his epoch, but his virtues (or insights) are his own.</p>
<p>As some Greek myths made Oceanus the father of all creation,* so</p>
<p>Thales made water the first principle of all things, their original
form and their final destiny. Perhaps, says Aristotle, he had come to
this opinion from observing “that the nutriment of everything is moist,
and that . . . the seeds of everything have a moist nature; . . . and
that from which every- thing is generated is always its first
principle.”” Or perhaps he believed that water was the most primitive or
fundamental of the three forms — gas, liquid, solid — into which,
theoretically, all substances may be changed. The significance of his
thought lay not in reducing all things to water, but in reducing all
things to one; here was the first monism in recorded history. Aristotle
describes Thales’ view as materialistic; but Thales adds that</p>
<p>In his old age he received by common consent the title of sophos, or
sage; and when Greece came to name its Seven Wise Men it placed Thales
firk. Being asked what was very difficult, he answered, in a famous
apophthegm, “To know thyself.” Asked what was very easy, he answered,
“To give advice.” To the question, what is God? he replied, “That which
has</p>
<p>neither beginning nor end.” Asked how men might live most
virtuously</p>
<p>• That a circle is bisected by its diameter; that the angles at the
base of any isosceles tri - angle are “similar” (i.e., equal) ; that the
angle i n a semicircle is a right angle; that the op- posite angles
formed by two intersecting straight lines are equal; that two triangles
having two angles and one side respectively equd are themselves
equal.^</p>

<p>and justly, he answered, “If we never do ourselves what we blame in
others.”* He died, says Diogenes Laertius,* “while present as a
spectator</p>
<p>Thales, says Strabo,* was the first of those who wrote on physiology
— i.e., on the science of nature (physis ) , or on the principle of
being and de- velopment in things. His work was vigorously advanced by
his pupil</p>
<p>Anaximander, who, though he lived from 6ii to 549 b.c., expounded a
philosophy surprisingly like that which Herbert Spencer, trembling
before his own originality, published in a.d. i860. The first principle,
says Anaxi- mander, was a vast Indefinite-Infinite (apeiron), a
boundless mass possessing no specific qualities, but developing, by its
inherent forces, into all the varied reahties of the universe.* This
animate and eternal but impersonal and unmoral Infinite is the only God
in Anaximander’s system; it is the unvary - ing and everlasting One, as
distinguished from the mutable evanescent Many of the world of things.
(Here stems the metaphysics of the Eleatic School — that only the
eternal One is real.) From this characterless Infinite are bom new
worlds in endless succession, and to it in endless succession they
return as they evolve and die. In the primordial Infinite all opposites
are con- tained — hot and cold, moist and dry, liquid and solid and gas
. . . ; in devel- opment these potential qualities become actual, and
make diverse and definite things; in dissolution these opposed qualitiM
are again resolved into the Infinite. (A source for Heracleitus as well
as for Spencer.) In this rise and fall of worlds the various elements
struggle with one another, and encroach upon each other as hostile
opposites. For this opposition they pay with dissolution; “Things perish
into those from which they have been bom.”</p>
<p>Anaximander, though he too can be guilty of astronomic bizarferies
for- givable in an age without instruments, advanced on Thales by
conceiving the earth as a cylinder freely suspended in the center of the
universe, and sustained only by being equidistant from all things.* The
sun, moon, and stars, he thought, moved in circles around the earth. To
illustrate all this Anaximander, probably on Babylonian models,
constracted at Sparta a gnomon, or sundial, on which he showed the
movement of the planets, the</p>

<p>CHAP.Vl) THE GREAT MIGRATION I39</p>
<p>obliquity of the ecliptic,* and the succession of solstices,
equinoxes, and seasons.” With the collaboration of his fellow Milesian,
Hecataeus, he established geography as a science by drawing — apparently
upon a tablet of brass — the first known map of the inhabited
world.!</p>
<p>In its earliest form, said Anaximander, the earth was in a fluid
state; external heat dried some of it into land, and evaporated some of
it into clouds; while the variations of heat in the atmosphere so formed
caused the motions of the winds. Living organisms arose by gradual
stages from the original moisture; land animals were at first fishes,
and only with the drying of the earth did they acquire their present
shape. Man too was once a feh; he could not at his earliest appearance
have been born as now, for he would have been too helpless to secure his
food, and would have been destroyed.”</p>
<p>A slighter figure is Anaximander’s pupil Anaximenes, whose first prin
- ciple was air. All other elements are produced from air by
rarefaction, which gives fire, or by condensation, which forms
progressively wind, cloud, water, earth, and stone. As the soul, which
is air, holds us together, so the air, or pneuma, of the world is its p
ervasive spirit, breath, or God.” Here was an idea that would ride out
all the storms of Greek philosophy, and find a haven in Stoicism and
Christianity.</p>
<p>This heyday of Miletus produced not only the earliest philosophy, but
the earliest prose, and the first historiography, in Greece. J Poetry
seems natural to a nation’s adolescence, when imagination is greater
than knowl - edge, and a strong faith gives personality to the forces of
nature in field, wood, sea, and sky; it is hard for poetry to avoid
animism, or for animism to avoid poetry. Prose is the voice of knowledge
freeing itself from imag- ination and faith; it is the language of
secular, mundane, “prosaic” affairs; it is the emblem of a nation’s
maturity, and the epitaph of its youth. Up to this time (600) nearly all
Greek literature had taken a poetic form; edu- cation had transmitted in
verse the lore and morals of the race; even early philosophers, like
Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Empedocles, gave their • The ecliptic (so
called becau se eclipses of the sun and moon take place in it) is the
great circle made by the apparent annual path of the sun through the
heavens. Since the plane of this circle or ecliptic is also the plane of
the earth’s orbit, the obliquity of the ecliptic is the oblique angle
(about 23°) between the plane of the earth’s equator and the plane of
its orbit around the sun.</p>
<p>t The Egyptians had drawn maps, but of limited districts.</p>

<p>systems a poetic dress. Just as science was at first a form of
philosophy, struggling to free itself from the general, the speculative,
the unverifiable, so philosophy was at first a form of poetry, striving
to free itself from mycology, animism, and metaphor.</p>
<p>It was therefore an event when Pherecydes and Anaximander expounded
their doctrines in prose. Other men of the age, whom the Greeks called
logo- grapAoj — reason writers, prose writers — began to chronicle in
the new medium the annals of their states; so Cadmus (550) wrote a
chronicle of Miletus, Eu- gaeon wrote of Samos, Xanthus wrote of Lydia.
Towards the end of the cen- tury Hecataeus of Miletus advanced both
history and geography in epochal works — the Historiai, or Inquiries,
and the Ges periodos, or Circuit of the Earth.</p>
<p>To Hecataeus and the other logographoi who appeared in this age in
most of the cities and colonies of Hellas, historia* meant any inquiry
into the facts of any matter, and was applied to science and philosophy
as well as to historiog- raphy in the modem sense. The term had a
skeptical connotation in Ionia; it signified that the miracle stories of
gods and demigod heroes were to be replaced with secular records of
events, and rational interpretations of causes and effects. In Hecataeus
the process begins; in Herodotus it advances; in Thucydides it is
complete.</p>
<p>The poverty of Greek prose before Herodotus is bound up with the</p>
<p>conquest and impoverishment of Miletus in the very generation in
which prose literature began. Internal decay followed the custom of
history in smoothing the path of the conqueror. The growth of wealth and
luxury made epicureanism fashionable, while stoicism and patriotism
seemed anti- quated and absurd; it became a bywo rd among the Greeks
that “once upon a time the Milesians were brave.”* Competition for the
goods of the earth</p>

<p>became keener as the old faith lost its power to mitigate class
strife by giv- ing scruples to the strong and consolations to the weak.
The rich, support- ing an oligarchic dictatorship, became a united party
against the poor, who wanted a democracy. The poor secured control of
the government, expelled the rich, collected the remaining children of
the rich on thresh- ing floors, set oxen upon them, and had them
trampled to death. The rich returned, recaptured power, coated the
leaders of the democracy with pitch, and then burnt them alive.” De
nobis fabula narrabitur. When, about 560, Croesus began to subject to
Lydian rule the Greek coast of Asia from Cnidus to the Hellespont,
Miletus saved its independence by refusing to help her sister states.
But in 546 Cyrus conquered Lydia, and without much difficulty absorbed
the faction-torn cities of Ionia into the Persian Empire. The great age
of Miletus was over. Science and philosophy, in the history of states,
reach their height after decadence has set in; wisdom is a harbinger of
death.</p>
<p>2 . Poly crates of Samos</p>
<p>Across the bay from Miletus, near the outlets of the Maeander, stood
the modest town of Myus, and the more famous city of Priene. There, in
the sixth century, lived Bias, one of the Seven Wise Men. As Hermippus
said, the Seven Wise Men were seventeen; for different Greeks made
different</p>
<p>lists of them, most frequently agreeing upon Thales, Solon, Bias,
Pittacus of Mytilene, Periander of Corinth, Chilon of Sparta, and
Cleobolus of Lin- dus in Rhodes. Greece respected wisdom as India
respected holiness, as Renaissance Italy respected artistic genius, as
young America naturally re- spects economic enterprise. The heroes of
Greece were not saints, or artists, or millionaires, but sages; and her
most honored sages were not theorists but men who had made their wisdom
function actively in the world. The sayings of these men became
proverbial among the Greeks, and were in some cases inscribed in the
temple of Apollo at Delphi. Peo- ple liked to quote, for example, the
remarks of Bias — that the most unfor- tunate of men is he who has not
learned how to bear misfortune; that men ought to order their lives as
if they were fated to live both a long and a short time; and that
“wisdom should be cherished as a means of traveling from youth to old
age, for it is more lasting than any other possession.”“</p>
<p>West of Priene lay Samos, second largest of Ionia’s isles. The
capital stood on the southeastern shore; and as one entered the
well-protected har-</p>
<p>142 T HE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>bor, passing the famous red ships of the Samian fleet, the city rose
as if in tiers on the hill: first the wharves and shops, then the homes,
then the fortress-acropolis and the great temple of Hera; and behind
these a succes- sion of ranges and peaks rising to a height of five
thousand feet. It was a sight to stir the patriotism of every Samian
soul.</p>
<p>The zenith of Samos came in the third quarter of the sixth century,
under Polycrates. The revenues from the busy port enabled the dictator
to end a dangerous period of unemployment by a program of public works
that called forth the admiration of Herodotus. The greatest of these
under- taking s was a tunnel that carried the city’s water supply 4500
feet through a mountain; we catch some idea of Greek ability in
mathematics and engi- neering when we learn that the two bores, begun at
opposite ends, met in the center with an error of eighteen feet in
direction and nine in height.*“</p>
<p>Samos had been a cultured center long before Polycrates. Here, about
590, the fabulous Aesop had been the Phrygian slave of the Greek ladmon.
An unconfirmed tradition tells how ladmon freed him, how Aesop traveled
widely, met Solon, lived at the court of Croesus, embezzled the money
that Croesus had commissioned him to distribute at Delphi, and met a
vio- lent death at the hands of the outraged Delphians.“ His fables,
largely taken from Eastern sources, were well known at Athens in the
classic age; Socrates, says Plutarch, put them into verse.“ Though their
form was Oriental, their philosophy was characteristically Greek. “Sweet
are the beauties of Nature, the earth and sea, the stars, and the orbs
of sun and moon. But dl the rest is fear and pain,”“ especially if one
embezzles. We can still meet him in the Vatican, where a cup from the
Periclean age rep- resents him with half-bald head and Vandyke beard,
listening profitably to a merry fox.“</p>
<p>The great Pythagoras was bom in Samos, but left it in 529 to live at
Cro- tona in Italy. Anacreon came from Teos to sing Polycrates’ charms
and to tutor his son. The greatest figure at the court was the artist
Theodorus, the Leonardo of Samos, Jack-of-all-trades and master of most.
The Greeks ascribed to him, perhaps as a cloture on research, the
invention of the level, the square, and the lathe;“ he was a skilled
engraver of gems, a metalworker, stoneworker, woodworker, sculptor, and
architect. He took part in de- signing the second temple of Artemis at
Ephesus, built a vast skias, or pavilion, for Sparta’s public
assemblies, helped to introduce clay modeling</p>

<p>into Greece, and shared with Rhoecus the honor of bringing from Egypt
or Assyria to Samos the hdllow casting of bronze.“ Before Theodorus the
Greelffl had made crude bronze statues by riveting plates of the metal
to a “bridge” of wood;“ now they were prepared to produce such
masterpieces in bronze as the Charioteer of Delphi and the Discus
Thrower of Myron. Samos was famous also for its pottery; Pliny
recommends it to us by telling us that the priests of Cybele would use
nothing but Samian potsherds in depriving themselves of their
manhood.“</p>
<p>3 . Heracleitus of Ephesus</p>
<p>Across the Caystrian Gulf from Samos stood Ionia’s most famous city—
Ephesus. Founded about looo by colonists from Athens, it prospered by
tapping the trade of both the Cayster and the Maeander. Its population,
its religion, and its art contained a strong Eastern element; the
Artemis wor- shiped there began and ended as an Oriental goddess of
motherhood and fertility. Her renowned temple had many deaths, and
almost as many resurrections. On the site of an ancient altar twice
built and twice de- stroyed, the first temple was erected about 600, and
was probably“ the earliest important edifice in the Ionic style. The
second temple was raised about 540, partly through the generosity of
Croesus; Paeonius of Ephesus, Theodorus of Samos, and Demetrius, a
priest of the shrine, shared in de- signing it. It was the largest Greek
temple that had yet been built, and was ranked without dispute among the
Seven Wonders of the World.* The city was known not only for its temple
but for its poets, its philoso- phers, and its expensively gowned
women.“ Here, as early as 690 b.c., lived Callinus, the earliest known
elegiac poet of Greece. Far greater and uglier was Hipponax, who,
towards 550, composed poems so coarse in subject, obscure in language,
pointed in wit, and refined in metrical style, that all Greece began to
talk about him, and all Ephesus to hate him. He was short and thin, lame
and deformed, and completely disagreeable. Woman, he tells us, in one of
his surviving fragments, brings two days of happiness to a man — “one
when he marries her, the other when he buries her.”” He was a ruthless
satirist, and lampooned every notable in Ephesus from the</p>

<p>lowest criminal to the highest priest of the temple. When two
sculptors, Bupalus and Athenis, exhibited an elegant caricature of him
he attacked them with such corrosive verse that some of it has proved
more durable than their stone, and sharper than the teeth of time. “Hold
my coat,” says a typically polished morsel; “I shall hit Bupalus in the
eye. I am ambidex - trous, and I never miss my aim.”“ Tradition said
that Hipponax died by suicide; but perhaps this was only a universal
wish.</p>
<p>The most illustrious son of Ephesus was Heracleitus the Obscure. Bom
about 530, he belonged to a noble family, and thought that democracy was
a mistake. “There are many bad but few good,” he said (i 1 1*), and “one
man to me is as ten thousand if he be the best” ( 1 1 3) . But even
aristocrats did not please him, nor women, nor scholars. “Abundant
learning,” he wrote with genial particularity, “does not form the mind;
if it did it would have instructed Hesiod, Pythagoras, Xenophanes and
Hecataeus” (16). “For the only real w isdom is to know that idea which
by itself will govern everything on every occasion” (19). So he went
off, like a Chinese sage, to live in the mountains and brood over the
one idea that would explain all things. Disdaining to expound his
conclusions in words intelligible to common men, and seeking in
obscurity of life and speech some safety from individuality-destroying
parties and mobs, he expressed his views in pithy and enigmatical
apophthegms On Nature, which he deposited in the temple of Artemis for
the mystification of posterity.</p>
<p>Heracleitus has been represented in modem literature as building his
philosophy around the notion of change; but the extant fragments hardly
support this interpretation. Like most philosophers he longed to find
the One behind the Many, some mind-steadying unity and order amid the
chaotic flux and multiplicity of the world. “All things are one,” he
said, as passionately as Parmenides (i); the problem of philosophy was,
what is this one? Heracleitus answered. Fire. Perhaps he was influenced
by the Persian worship of fire; probably, as we may judge from his
identification of Fire with Soul and God, he used the term symbolically
as well as liter- ally, to mean energy as well as fire; the fragments
permit no certainty. “This world . . . was made neither by a god nor by
man, but it ever was, and is, and shall be, ever-living Fire, in
measures being kindled and in measures going out” (20). Everything is a
form of Fire, either in Fire’s “downward path” through progr essive
condensation into moisture, water,</p>
<p>*The parenthetical numbers refer to the fragments of Heracleitus as
numbered by Bywater.</p>
<p>CHAP.Vl) THE GREAT MIGRATION I45</p>
<p>and earth; or in Its “upward path” from earth to water to moisture to
Fire,*”</p>
<p>Though he finds a consoling constancy in the Eternal Fire,
Heracleitus is troubled by its endless transformations; and the second
nucleus of his thought is the eternity and ubiquity of chaise. He finds
nothing static in the universe, the mind, or the soul. Nothing is,
everything becomes; no condition persists unaltered, even for the
smallest moment; everything is ceasing to be what it was, and is
becoming what it will be. Here is a new emphasis in philosophy:
Heracleitus does not merely ask, like Thales, what things are, but, like
Anaximander, Lucretius, and Spencer, how they be- came what they are;
and he suggests, like Aristotle, that a study of the sec- ond question
is the best approach to the first. The extant apophthegms do not contain
the famous formula, panta ret, ouden menei —“z〕l things flow, nothing
abides”; but antiquity is unanimous in attributing it to
Heracleitus.“</p>
<p>Hence Heracleitus passes to the third element in his philosophy — the
unity of opposites, the interdependence of contraries, the harmony of
strife. “God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit
and hunger” (36). “Good and bad are the same; goodness and badness are
one” (57 - 8); “life and death are the same; so are waking and sleeping,
youth and age” (78). All these contraries are stages in a fluctuating
move- ment, moments of the ever-changing Fire; each member in an
opposing pair is necessary to the meaning and existence of the other;
reality is the tension and interplay, the alternation and exchange, the
unity and har-</p>
<ul>
<li>Possibly Heracleitus had in mind a nebular hypothesis: the world
begins as fire (or heat or energy), it becomes gas or moisture, which is
precipitated as water, whose chemical residue, after evaporation, forms
the solids of the earth.“ Water and earth (liquid and solid) are two
stages of one process, two forms of one reality (25). “All things are
exchanged for Fire, and</li>
</ul>
<p>1^6 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.VI</p>
<p>mony, of opposites. “They understand not hew that which is at
variance</p>
<p>loosened or drawn taut, creates the harmony of vibrations called
music or a note, so the alternation and strife of opposites creates the
essence and meaning and harmony of life and change. In the struggle of
organism with organism, of man with man, of man with woman, of
generation with generation, of class with class, of nation with nation,
of idea with idea, of creed with creed, the warring opposites are the
warp and woof on the loom of life, working at cross-purposes to produce
the unseen unity and hidden concord of the whole. “From things that
differ comes the fairest attunement” (46) ; any lover will
understand.</p>
<p>All three of these principles — fire, change, and the tension unity
of con- traries — enter into Heracleitus’ conception of soul and God. He
smiles at men who “seek in vain to purify themselves from blood
-guiltiness by de- filing themselves with blood” ( 1 30) , or who “offer
prayers to these statues</p>
<p>mortality; man too, like everything else, is a changeful and fitful
flame, “kindled and put out like a light in the night” (77). Even so,
man is Fire; the soul or vital principle is part of the eternal energy
in all things; and as such it never dies. Death and birth are arbitrary
points taken in the current of things by the human analyzing mind; but
from the impartial standpoint of the universe they are merely phases in
the endless change of forms. At every instant some part of us dies while
the whole lives; at every second one of us dies while Life lives. Death
is a beginning as well as an ending; birth is an ending as well as a
beginning. Our words, our thoughts, even our morals, are prejudices, and
represent our interests as parts or groups; philosophy must see things
in the light of the whole. “To God all things are beautiful and good and
right; men deem some things wrong and some r ight” (61).</p>
<p>As the soul is a passing tongue of the endlessly changing flame of
life, so God is the everlasting Fire, the indestructible energy of the
world. He is the unity binding all opposites, the harmony of all
tensions, the sum and meaning of all strife. This Divine Fire, like life
(for the two are every- where and one), is always altering its form,
always passing upward or downward on the ladder of change, always
consuming and remaking things; indeed, some distant day, “Fire will
judge and convict all things” (26), destroy them, and make way for new
forms, in a Last Judgment</p>

<p>*47</p>
<p>or cosmic catastrophe. Nevertheless, the operations of the Undying
Fire are not without sense and order; if we could understand the world
as a whole we should see in it a vast impersonal wisdom, a Logos or
Reason or Word (65) ; and we should try to mold our lives into accord
with this way of Nature, this law of the universe, this wisdom or
orderly energy which is God (91). “It is wise to hearken not to me, but
to the Word” (i), to seek and follow the infinite reason of the
whole.</p>
<p>When Heracleitus apphes to ethics these four basic concepts of
his</p>
<p>thought — energy, change, the unity of opposites, and the reason of
the whole — he illuminates all life and conduct. Energy harnessed to
reason, wedded to order, is the greatest good. Change is not an evil but
a boon; “in change one finds rest; it is weariness to be always toiling

<p>All in all, the philosophy of Heracleitus, concentrated for us now in
130 fragments, is among the major products of the Greek mind. The theory
of the Divine Fire passed down into Stoicism; the notion of a final con-
flagration was transmitted through Stoicism to Christianity; the Logos,
or reason in nature, became in Philo and Christian theology the Divine
Word, the personified wisdom with which or through whom God creates and
governs all things; in some measure it prepared for the early modem view
of natural law. Virtue as obedience to nature became a catchword of
Stoicism; the unity of opposites revived vigorously in Hegel; the idea
of change came back into its own with Bergson. TTie conception of strife

<p>We know almost not^g of Heracleitus’ life; and of his death we have
only an unsupported story in Diogenes Laertius, which may illustrate the
prosaic ends to which our poetry may return:</p>
<p>And at last becoming a complete misanthrope, he used to spend</p>
<p>his time walking about the mountains, feeding on grasses and plants;
and in consequence of these habits he was attacked by the dropsy,</p>
<p>and so he returned to the city, and asked the physicians, in a
riddle, whether they were able to produce a drought after wet
weather.</p>
<p>And as they did not understand him, he shut himself up in a
stable</p>
<p>for oxen, and covered himself with cow dung, hoping to cause the</p>
<p>wet to evaporate from him by the warmth that this produced. And</p>

<p>Colophon, a few miles north of Ephesus, derived its name, presumably,
from the hill on whose slope it rose.* Xenophanes the anticlerical, bom
among them about 576, describ ed the Colophonians as “richly clothed in
purple garments, proud of their luxuriously dressed hair wet Avith
costly and sweet- smelling oils”; vanity has a long history.“ Here, and
perhaps at Smyrna, the poet Mimnermus (610) sang, for a people already
infected with the languid pessimism of the Blast, his melancholy odes of
fleeting youth and love. He lost his heart to Nanno, the girl who
accompanied his songs with the plaintive obbligato of the flute; and
when she rejected his love (perhaps on the ground that a poet married is
a poet dead), he im- mortalized her with a sheaf of delicate elegiac
verse.</p>

<p>CHAP.Vl) THE GREAT MIGRATION I49</p>
<p>A more famous poet lived a century later in the near-by town of Teos.
Anacreon wandered much, but in Teos he was bom (563) and died (478).
Many a court sought him, for among his contemporaries only Simonides
rivaled him in fame. We find him joining a band of emigrants to Thracian
Abdera, serving as soldier for a campaign or two, abandoning his shield
in the poetic fashion of the time, and thereafter content to brandish a
pen; spending some years at the court of Polycrates in Samos; brought
thence in official state, on a fifty-oared gaUey, to grace the palace of
Hipparchus in Athens; and at last, after the Persian War, returning to
Teos to ease his declining years with song and drink. He paid for his
excesses by living to a great age, and died at eighty-five, we are told,
of a grape pit sticking in his throat.“</p>
<p>Alexandria knew five books of Anacreon, but only disordered couplets
remain. His subjects were wine, women, and boys; his manner was one of
polished banter in tripping iambics. No topic seemed impure in his
impeccable diction, or gross in his delicate verse. Instead of the
vulgar viralence of Hipponax, or the trembling intensity of Sappho,
Anacreon offered the urbane chatter of a court poet who would play
Horace to any Augustus that pleased his fancy and paid for his wine.
Athenaeus thinks that his tipsy songs and changeful loves were a pose;®
perhaps Anacreon hid his fidelities that he might be interesting to
women, and concealed his sobriety to augment his fame. A choice legend
tells how, in his cups, he stumbled against a child and abused it with
harsh words, and how, in his age, he fell in love with this lad and did
penance with doting praise.® His &amp;OS was ambidextrous, and reached
impartially for either sex; but in his later years he gallantly gav e
the preference to women. “Lo, now,” says a pretty fragment, “golden
-haired Love strikes me with his purple ball, and calls me forth to play
with a motley-slippered maid. But she hails from lofty Lesbos, and so
finds fault with my white hair, and goes a-searching for other prey.”® A
wit of a later age wrote for Anacreon’s grave a reveal - ing
epitaph:</p>
<p>All-enchanting nurse of the wine, O Vine, grow lush and long</p>
<p>above the tomb of Anacreon. So shall the tippling friend of neat</p>
<p>liquor, who thrummed in night-long revel the lute of a lover of lads,
yet sport above his buried head the glorious cluster of some teem-</p>
<p>ing bough, and be wet evermore with the dew whose delicious scent was
the breath of his mild old mouth.®</p>

<p>From Teos the mainland staggers westward in vacillating bays and
promon- tories until, across ten miles of sea, the traveler reaches
Chios. Here, amid groves of figs and olives, and Anacreontic vines,
Homer may have spent his youth. Wine making was a major industry in
Chios, and used many slaves; in 431 the island had 30,000 freemen,
100,000 slaves.“ Chios became a clearing- house for slaves; slave
dealers bought the families of insolvent debtors from their creditors,
and purchased boys to make eunuchs of them for the palaces of Lydia and
Persia.®® In the sixth century Drimachus led his fellow slaves in
revolt, defeated all armies sent against him, established himself in a
mountain fastness, levied toll upon the richer citizens by
discriminating robbery, offered them “protection” for a consideration
after our own fashion, terrified them into deding more justly with their
slaves, gave his voluntarily severed head to his friends so that they
might claim the reward that had been promised for it, and was worshiped
for centuries afterward as the patron deity of slaves:<em>® here</em> is
an excellent epic for some Spartacus of the pen. Art and literature
flourished amid the wealth and bondage of Chios; here the Homeridae, a
guild and succes- sion of bards, had their seat; here Ion the dramatist
and Theopompus the his- torian would be bom; here Glaucus (tradition
said) discovered, about 560, the technique of welding iron; here
Archermus and his sons, Bupalus and Athenis, made the finest statuary in
sixth-century Greece.</p>
<p>Returning to the mainland, the traveler passes by the sites of
Erythrae and Qazomenae — birthplace of Pericles’ teacher and friend,
Anaxagoras. Farther</p>
<p>The northernmost of Ionia’s cities was Phocaea, still functioning as
Fokia. The river Hermus connected it almost with Sardis itself, and gave
it a lucrative advantage in the commerce of the Greeks with Lydia.
Phocaean merchants undertook distant voyages in the search for markets;
it was they who brought Greek culture to Corsica, and founded
Marseilles.</p>

<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>I5I</p>
<p>Such were the Twelve Cities of Ionia, seen superfic ially as if in an
hour’s flight through space and time. Though they were too competitive
and jealous to form a union for mutual defense, their citizens
acknowledged some solidarity of background and interest, and met
periodically on the promontory of Mycale near Priene, in the great
festival of the Panionium. Thales begged them to form a sympolity in
which every adult male would be a citizen both of his city and of a
Panionian union; but commercial rivalries were too strong, and led
rather to internecine wars than to politi- cal unity. Hence, when the
Persian attack came (546-5), the alliance im- provised for defense
proved rootlessly weak, and the Ionian cities came under the power of
the Great King. Nevertheless this spirit of independ- ence and rivalry
gave to the Ionian communities the stimulus of competi- tion and the
zest of liberty. It was under these conditions that.Ionia devel- oped
science, philosophy, history, and the Ionic capital, while at the same
time it produced so many poets that the sixth century in Hellas seems
almost as fertile as the fifth. When Ionia fell her cities bequeathed
their culture to the Athens that had fought to save them, and
transmitted to it the intellectual leadership of Greece.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>SAPPHO OF LESBOS</li>
</ol>
<p>Above the Ionian Dodecapolis lay the twelve cities of mainland
Aeolis, settled by Aeolians and Achaeans from northern Greece soon after
the fall of Troy had opened Asia Minor to Greek immigration. Most of
these cities were small, and played a modest role in history; but the
Aeolian isle of Lesbos rivaled the Ionian centers in wealth, refinement,
and literary genius. Its volcanic soil made the island a very garden of
orchards</p>
<p>and vines. Of its five cities Mytilene was the greatest, almost as
rich, through its commerce, as Miletus, Samos, and Ephesus. Towards the
end of the seventh century a coalition of the mercantile classes with
the poorer citizens overthrew the landed aristocracy, and made the
brave, rough Pit- tacus dictator for ten years, with powers like those
of his friend and fellow Wise Man, Solon. The aristocracy conspired to
recapture power, but Pittacus foiled them and exiled their leaders,
including Alcaeus and Sappho, first from Mytilene and then from Lesbos
itself.</p>
<p>Alcaeus was a roistering firebrand who mingled politics with
poetry</p>
<p>and made every other lyric raise the tocsin of revolt. Of
aristocratic birth, he attacked Pittacus with a lusty scurrility that
merited the crown of ban- ishment. He molded his own poetic forms, to
which posterity gave the</p>
<p>152 the life of GREECE (CHAP.VI</p>
<p>name “alcaics”; and every stanza, we are told, had melody and charm.
For a while he sang of war, and described his home as hung with martial
tro- phies and accouterments;’^ however, when his own c hance for
heroism came he threw away his shield, fled like Archilochus, and
complimented himself lyrically on the valor of his discretion.
Occasionally he sang of love, but dearest to his pen was the wine for
which Lesbos was as famous as for its poetry. Nun chre methusthen, he
advises us: nunc bibamus, let us drink deeply; in summer to cool our
thirst, in autumn to put a bright color upon death, in winter to warm
our blood, in spring to celebrate nature’s resurrection.</p>
<p>The rain of Zeus descends, and from high heaven</p>
<p>A storm is driven,</p>
<p>And on the running water-brooks the cold</p>
<p>Lays icy hold.</p>
<p>Then up! beat down the winter, make the fire</p>
<p>Blaze higher and higher;</p>
<p>Mix wine as sweet as honey of the bee</p>
<p>Abundantly;</p>
<p>Then drink, with comfortable wool around</p>
<p>Your temples bound.</p>
<p>We must not yield our hearts to woe, or wear</p>
<p>With wasting care;</p>
<p>For grief will profit us no whit, my friend.</p>
<p>Nor nothing mend;</p>
<p>But this is our best medicine, with wine fraught</p>
<p>To cast out thought.”</p>
<p>It was his misfortune — though he bore it with lighthearted
unconscious- ness — to have among his contemporaries the most famous of
Greek women. Even in her lifetime all Greece honored Sappho. “One
evening over the wine,” says Stobaeus, “Execestides, the nephew of Sol
on, sang a song of Sappho’s which his uncle liked so much that he bade
the boy teach it to him ; and when one of the company asked, ‘What for?’
he answered, ‘I want to learn it and die!’”” Socrates, perhaps hoping
for similar lenience, called her “The Beautiful,” and Plato wrote about
her an ecstatic epigram:</p>
<p>Some say there are Nine Muses. How careless they are!</p>
<p>Behold, Sappho of Lesbos is the Tenth!”</p>
<p>“Sappho was a marvelous woman,” said Strabo; “for in all the time of
which we have record I do not know of any woman who could rival her
even</p>
<p>CHAP.Vl) THE GREAT MIGRATION I53</p>
<p>in a slight degree in the matter of poetry.”“ As the ancients meant
Homer when they said “the Poet,” so all the Greek world knew whom
men</p>
<p>signified when they spoke of “the Poetess.”</p>
<p>Psappha, as she called herself in her soft Aeolic dialect, was bom
at</p>
<p>Eresus, on Lesbos, about 612; but her family moved to Mytilene when
she was still a child. In 593 she was among the conspiring aristocrats
whom Pittacus banished to the town of Pyrrha; already at nineteen she
was play- ing a part in public life through politics or poetry. She was
not known for beauty: her figure was small and frail, her hair and eyes
and skin were darker than the Greeks desired;“ but she had the charm of
daintiness, deli- cacy, refinement, and a brilliant mind that was not
too sophisticated to conceal her tenderness. “My heart,” she says, “is
like that of a child.”” We know from her verses that she was of a
passionate nature, one whose words, says Plutarch, “were mingled with
flames”;™ a certain sensuous quality gave body to the enthusiasms of her
mind. Atthis, her favorite pupil, spoke of her as dressed in saffron and
purple, and garlanded with flowers. She must have been attractive in her
minuscule way, for Alcaeus, exiled with her to Pyrrha, soon sent her an
invitation to romance. “Violet -crowned, pure, sweet-smiling Sappho, I
want to say something to you, but shame prevents me.” Her answer was
less ambiguous than his proposal: “If thy wishe s were fair and noble,
and thy tongue designed not to utter what is base, shame would not cloud
thine eyes, but thou wouldst speak thy just de- sires.”“ The poet sang
her praises in odes and serenades, but we hear of no further intimacy
between them.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were separated by Sappho’s second exile. Pittacus, fear
- ing her maturing pen, banished her now to Sicily, probably in the year
591, when one would have thought her still a harmless girl. About this
time she married a rich merchant of Andr os; some years later she
writes: “I have a little daughter, like a golden flower, my darling
Cleis, for whom I would not take all Lydia, nor lovely Lesbos.”* She
could afford to reject the wealth of Lydia, having inherited that of her
husband on his early death. After five years of exile she returned to
Lesbos, and became a leader of the island’s society and intellect. We
catch the glamour of luxury in one of her surviving fragments: “But I,
be it known, love soft living, and for me</p>
<p>brightness and be auty belong to the desire of the sun.”“ She became
deeply attached to her young brother Charaxus, and was vexed to her
finger tips when, on one of his mercantile journeys to Egypt, he fell in
love with the courtesan Doricha, and, ignoring his sister’s entreaties,
married her.™</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sappho too had felt the fire. Eager for an active life,
she</p>

<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>had opened a school for young women, to whom she taught poetry,
music, and dancing; it was the first “finishing school” in history. She
called her students not pupils but hetairai — companions; the word had
not yet ac- quired a promiscuous connotation. Husbandless, Sappho fell
in love with one after another of these girls. “Love,” says one
fragment, “has shaken my mind as a down-rushing wind that falls upon the
oak- trees.”® “I loved you, Atthis, long ago,” says another fragment,
“when my own girlhood was still all flowers, and you seemed to me an
awkward Uttle child.” But then Atthis accepted the attentions of a youth
from Mytilene, and Sappho ex- pressed her jealousy with unmeasured
passion in a poem preserved by Longinus and translated haltingly into
“sapphic” meter by John Adding - ton Symonds:</p>
<p>Peer of gods he seemeth to me, the blissful</p>
<p>Man who sits and gazes at thee before him.</p>
<p>Close beside thee sits, and in silence hears thee</p>
<p>Silverly speaking.</p>
<p>Laughing love’s low laughter. Oh, this, this only</p>
<p>Stirs the troubled heart in my breast to tremble!</p>
<p>For should I but see thee a Uttle moment.</p>
<p>Straight is my voice hushed;</p>
<p>Yea, my tongue is broken, and through and through me,</p>
<p>’Neath the flesh, impalpable fire runs tingUng.</p>
<p>Nothing see mine eyes, and a voice of roaring</p>
<p>Waves in my ear sounds;</p>
<p>Sweat runs down in rivers, a tremor seizes</p>
<p>All my limbs, and paler than grass in autumn.</p>
<p>Caught by pains of menacing death, I falter.</p>
<p>Lost in the love- trance.*“</p>
<p>Atthis’ parents removed her from the school; and a letter ascribed to
Sappho gives what may be her account of the parting.</p>
<p>She (Atthis?) w ept full sore to leave me behind, and said:
“Alas,</p>
<p>how sad our lot! Sappho, I swear ’tis against my will I leave
you.”</p>
<p>And I answered her: “Go your way rejoicing, but remember me,</p>
<p>for you know how I doted upon you. And if you remember not,</p>
<p>oh, then I will remind you of what you forget, how dear and beau-</p>
<p>tiful was the life we led together. For with many a garland of

<p>and sweet roses mingled you have decked your flowing locks by my
side, and with many a woven necklet, made of a hundred blossoms, your
dainty throat; and with unguent in plenty, both precious and</p>
<p>royal, have you anointed your fair young skin in my bosom. And</p>
<p>no hill was there, nor holy place, nor water-brook, whither we
did</p>
<p>not go; nor ever did the teeming noises of the early spring fill
any</p>
<p>wood with the medley-song of the nightingales but you wandered</p>
<p>thither with me.”“</p>
<p>After which, in the same manuscript, comes the bitter cry, “I shall
never see Atthis again, and indeed I might as well be dead.” This surely
is the authentic voice of love, rising to a height of sincerity and
beauty beyond good and evil.</p>
<p>The later scholars of antiquity debated whether these poems were ex-
pressions of “Lesbian love,” or merely exercises of poetic fancy and im
- personation. It is enough for us that they are poetry of the first
order, tense with feeling, vivid with imagery, and perfect in speech and
form. A fragment speaks of “the footfall of the flowering spring”;
another of “Love the limb -loosener, the bitter- sweet torment”; another
com pares the unattainable love to “the sweet apple that reddens on the
end of the bough, the very end of the bough, which the gatherers missed,
nay missed not, but could not reach so far.”“ Sappho wrote of other
topics than love, and used, even for our extant remains, half a hundred
meters; and she her- self set her poems to music for the harp. Her verse
was collected into nine books, of some twelve thousand lines; six
hundred lines survive, seldom continuous. In the year 1073 of our era
the poetry of Sappho and Alcaeus was publicly burned by ecclesiastical
authorities in Constantinople and Rome.” Then, in 1897, Grenfell and
Hunt discovered, at Oxyrhynchus in the Fayum, coffins of papier-mache,
in whose making certain scraps of old books had been use d; and on these
scraps were some poems of Sappho.™</p>
<p>Male posterity avenged itself upon her by handing down or inventing
the tale of how she died of unrequited love for a man. A passage in
Suidas™ tells how “the courtesan Sappho”— usually identified with the
poetess- leaped to death from a cliff on the island of Leucas because
Phaon the sailor would not return her love. Menander, Strabo, and others
refer to the story, and Ovid recounts it in loving detail;” but it has
many earmarks of legend, and must be left hovering nebulously between
fiction and fact. In her later years, tradition said, Sappho had
relearned the love of men. Among the Egyptian morsels is her touching
reply to a proposal of mar-</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>riage: “ If my breasts were still capable of giving suck, and my womb
were able to bear children, then to another marriage-bed not with
trembling feet would I come. But now on my skin age has brought many
lines, and Love hastens not to me with his gift of pain”— and she
advises her suitor to seek a younger wife.“ In truth we do not know when
she died, or how; we know only that she left behind her a vivid memory
of passion, poetry, and grace; and that she shone even above Alcaeus as
the most melodious singer of her time. Gently, in a final fragment, she
reproves those who would not admit that her song was finished:</p>
<p>You dishonor the good gifts of the Muses, my children, when</p>
<p>you say, “We will crown you, dear Sappho, best player of the
clear,</p>
<p>sweet lyre.” Kn ow you not that my skin is all wrinkled with age,</p>
<p>and my hair is turned from black to white? . . . Surely as starry</p>
<p>Night follows rose-armed Dawn and brings darkness to the ends of</p>
<p>the earth, so Death tracketh everything living, and catcheth it in
the end.“</p>

<li>THE NORTHERN EMPIRE</li>
</ol>
<p>North of Lesbos is little Tenedos, whose women were accounted by some
ancient travelers to be the most beautiful in Greece.” Then one follows
the adventurous Hellenes into the northern Sporades: to Imbros, and
Lemnos, and Samothrace. The Milesians, seeking to control the
Hellespont, founded, about 560, the still-living town of Abydos on its
south shore;* here Leander and Byron swam the straits, and Xerxes’ army
crossed to Europe on a bridge of boats. Farther eastward the Phocaeans
settled Lampsacus, birthplace of Epi- curus. Within the Propontis lay
two groups of islands: the Proconnesus, rich in the marble that gave the
Propontis its current name, the Sea of Marmora; and the Arctonnesus, on
whose southernmost tip the Milesians established in 757 the great port
of Cyzicus. Along the coast rose one Greek city after an- other:
Panormus, Dascylium, Apameia, Cius, Astacus, Chalcedon. Up through the
Bosporus the Greeks advanced, hungry for metals, grain, and trade,
found- ing Chrysopolis (now Scutari) and Nicopolis — “city of victory.”
Then they made their way along the southern shore of the Black Sea,
depositing towns at Heracleia, Pontica, Tieum, and Sinope-a city
splendidly adorned, says Strabo,“ with gymnasium, agora, and shady
colonnades; Diogenes the Cynic was not above being bom here. Then
Amisus, Oenoe, Tripolis, and Trapezus (Trebizond, Trabzon) — where
Xenophon’s Ten Thousand shouted with joy at the sight of the longed-for
sea. The opening up of this region to Greek</p>

<p>colonization, perhaps by Jason, later by the lonians, gave the mother
cities the same outlet for surplus population and trade, the same
resources in food, silver, and gold, that the discovery of America gave
to Europe at the beginning of modem times.®</p>
<p>Following the eastern shores of the Euxine northward into Medea’s
Colchis, the Greeks founded Phasis and Dioscurias, and Theodosia and
Panticapaeum in the Crimea. Near the mouths of the Bug and the Dnieper
they established the city of Olbia (Nikolaev) ; at the mouth of the
Dniester, the town of Tyras; and on the Danube, Troesmis. Then, moving
southward along the west shore of the Black Sea, they built the cities
of Istrus (Constanta, Kustenje), Tomi (where Ovid died), Odessus
(Varna), and Apollonia (Burgas). The histori- cally sensitive traveler
stands appalled at the antiquity of these living towns; but today’s
residents, engrossed in the tasks of their own generation, are undis -
turbed by the depth of the centuries that lie silent beneath them.</p>
<p>Then again at the Bosporus the Megarians, about 660, built Byzantium*
— yesterday Constantinople, now Istanbul. Even before Pericles this
strategic port was becoming what Napoleon would call it at the Peace of
Tilsit — the key to Europe; in the third century b.c. Polybius described
its maritime position as “more favorable to security and pros perity
than that of any other city in the world known to us.”““ Byzantium grew
rich by exacting tolls from passing ves - sels, and exporting to the
Greek world the grain of southern Russia (“Scythia”) and the Balkans,
and the fish that were netted with shameful ease as they crowded through
the narrow straits. It was its curving form, and the wealth derived from
this fishing industry, that gave the city its later name, the “Golden
Horn.” Under Pericles Athens dominated Byzantine polities, levied tolls
t here to fill her treasury in time of emergency, and regulated the
export of grain from the Black Sea as a contraband of war.®</p>
<p>Along the northern or Thracian shore of the Propontis the Greeks
built towns at Selymbria, Perinthus (Eregli), Bisanthe, Callipolis
(Gallipoli), and Sestus. Later settlements were established on the
southwestern coast of Thrace at Aph- rodisias, Aenus, and Abdera — where
Leucippus and Democritus would pro- pound the philosophy of atomistic
materialism. Off the coast of Thrace lay the island of Thasos, “bare and
ugly as a donkey’s back in the sea,” Archilochus described it,® but so
rich in gold mines that their proceeds paid all the expenses of the
government. On or near the eastern coast of Macedonia Greek gold-
seekers, chiefly Athenians, founded Neapolis and Amphipolis — whose
capture by Philip would lead to the war in which Athens was to lose her
liberty. Other Greeks, mostly from Chalcis and Eretria, conquered and
named the three-fin- gered peninsula of Chalcidice, and by 700 had
established thirty towns there,</p>
<p>• The name was probably taken from Byzas, a native king.”</p>

(birthplace of Aristotle), Scione, Mende, Potidaea, Acanthus, Cleonae,
Torone, and Olyn- thus — captured by Philip in 348 and known to us now
through the oratory of Demosthenes. Recent excavations at Olynthus have
unearthed a town of considerable extent, with many houses of two stories
and some of twenty-five rooms. In the time of Philip Olynthus appears to

between ancient Hellas and the modem world.</p>
