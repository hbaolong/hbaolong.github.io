<h4 id="chapter-xxi-the-lake-poets">CHAPTER XXI The Lake Poets</h4>
<p>1770 — 1850</p>
<p>I. AMBIENCE</p>
<p>W E here gather Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey into one awk- ward
and concurrent chapter, not because they established a school — they did
not; nor because they displayed any shared spirit in their charac- ters
or works. Coleridge’s magic verse was wrapt in mystery, strange souls
and secrets, while Wordsworth’s proseful poetry rambled contentedly with
common men, women, children, and things. Coleridge lived and died a ro-
mantic — a creature of feeling, fancies, hopes and fears; Wordsworth,
except for a romantic interlude in France, and a rebellious
pronouncement in 1798, was as classic as Crabbe, and conservatively
calm. As for Southey, his poetry was Romantic while it paid; his prose
was restrained and worthy of Dry den; his mature politics hugged the
status quo; and his life of marital stability and generous friendship
safely balanced the emotional, philosophi- cal, financial, and
geographical wanderings of the fellow poet with whom he had once dre
amed of a communal utopia on Susquehanna’s shores.</p>
<p>These men constituted a school only in the sense that they dwelt
through many years in the Lake District of northwest England — the
misty, rainy, mystic assemblage of cloud- capped mountains and silver
“meres” that makes the area from Kendal through Windermere, Ambleside,
Rydal Water, Gras- mere, Derwentwater, and Keswick to Cockermouth one of
the fairest re- gions of our planet. Not toweringly majestic — the
tallest mountain reaches only to three thousand feet; not congenial to
consumptives — the rain falls there almost daily; but the mists embrace
the mountains amicably, the sun breaks out nearly every day, and
accustomed denizens bear the wanderings of the weather because of the
peace of the villages, the evergreen foliage, the abounding flowers
happy in the dew, and the spirits of mad Coleridge and steady Wordsworth
echoing through the hills. There at Cockermouth Wordsworth was born, and
at Grasmere died; there at Keswick Coleridge lived intermittently, and
Southey forty years; there, for diverse periods, stayed De Quincey,
Arnold of Rugby, Ruskin; there, briefly, Scott and Shelley, Carlyle and
Keats came to sample Eden, and recall its laureates.</p>
<p>4*7</p>
<p>418</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXI</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>WORDSWORTH: 177O-97</li>
</ol>
<p>His mother, nee Ann Cookson, was the daughter of a linen draper in
Penrith. His father, John Wordsworth, was a lawyer, prospering as
business agent of Sir James Lowther. In their comfortable home at
Cockermouth John and Ann brought up five children: Richard, who became
an attorney and managed the poet’s finances; William and Dorothy, who
are our chief present concern; John, who went to sea and died in a
shipwreck; and Chris- topher, who became a scholar and rose to be master
of Trinity College, Cambridge. For reasons now forgotten William was not
baptized till after the birth of Dorothy a year after him, in 1771;
brother and sister were chris- tened on the same day, as if to sanction
and bless their lifelong love.</p>
<p>Dorothy, more than any of his brothers, became William’s childhood
friend. She shared his fascination with the varied nature that
surrounded them. He was keen and sensitive, she was more so, quicker to
catch the forms and colors of the vegetation, the moods and exhalations
of the trees, the lazy wanderings of the clouds, the moon benignly
shedding silver on the lakes. “She gave me eyes, she gave me ears,” the
poet was to say of his sister. She tamed his hunting impulses to chase
and kill; she insisted that he should never hurt any living thing. 1</p>
<p>When she was seven they bore the bereavement of their mother’s death.
Their father, stunned, refused to take another wife; he buried himself
in his work, and sent his children to live with relatives. Dorothy went
off to an aunt in Halifax in Yorkshire, and could now see William only
on his vaca- tions. He was sent in 1779 to a good school at Hawkshead,
near Lake Win- dermere; there he studied the Greek and Latin classics,
and began, as he said, to “spin verses.”</p>
<p>But the woods and waters of the vicinity seemed to have played a
greater role than his books in the formation of his style and character.
He was not unsocial; he took part with the other boys in the games of
youth, and some- times joined in a boisterous evening at the local inn;
but many times he walked off alone into the hills, or along the shores
of Esth waite Water or Lake Windermere. Now and then, careless of
weather and friendly to its forms, he wandered too far for security, and
knew the fears that can come to youths invading the appropriated haunts
of “lower” life; but gradually he came to feel a hidden spirit in the
growth of plants, the play and struggle of animals, the pride of the
mountains, the smiles and frowns of the kaleido- scopic sky. All these
voices from field, forest, peak, and cloud seemed to speak to him in
their own language, too secret and subtle for words, but felt by him as
assurance that the incredible multiform multitude of things about him
was no helpless mechanism of matter, but the frame of a God greater and
nearer than the distant, silent, formless deity of his prayers. He
devel- oped a mood of somber inwardness as well as outgoing
adoration.</p>
<p>In 1783 the father suddenly died. His disordered assets passed into
such</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>419</p>
<p>prolonged and expensive litigation, and the ^4,700 owed him by Sir
James Lowther were so long held back, that the available bequest,
amounting to six hundred to each of the children, fell far short of
providing for their con- tinued education. 2 Brother Richard
nevertheless found means to see William through Hawkshead.</p>
<p>In October, 1787, Wordsworth “went up” to Cambridge and entered</p>
<p>In July, 1790, he persuaded a Welsh classmate, Robert Jones, to pool
sav- ings with him to a total of twenty pounds and join him in a walking
tour on the Continent. They made their way to Lake Como, turned east
into Swit- zerland, ran short of funds, and hurried back to England and
Cambridge in time to appease the wrath of their financiers. Wordsworth
made up for a yea r’s neglect of Dorothy by spending the Christmas
holidays with her at</p>
<p>When he graduated from Cambridge (January, 1791) he disappointed many
hopes by going to London, “where for four months he lived in an
obscurity which remains almost complete.” 4 In May he took off with
Jones on a walking tour through Wales; they climbed Mount Snowdon (1,350
feet) to see the sunrise. On November 27, alone, he crossed again to
France.</p>
<p>The Revolution was then in its finest phase: a liberal constitution
had been formulated, a Declaration of the Rights of Man had been
proclaimed to the world; how could any sensitive youth, still a
fledgling in philosophy, resist that call to universal justice and
brotherhood? It was too hard for a poor scholar who had known some hurt
from titled overlords (Sir James Lowther) to condemn those Frenchmen
who, as he would put it in his auto- biographical Prelude,</p>
<p>held something up to view</p>
<p>Of a Republic where all stood thus far</p>
<p>Upon equal ground; that we were brothers all</p>
<p>In honor, as in one community,</p>
<p>Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,</p>
<p>Distinction open lay to all that came,</p>
<p>And wealth and titles were in less esteem</p>
<p>Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry. 5</p>
<p>420</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Arrived in France, he was stirred by the ardor of the nation rising
spon- taneously to arms to meet the threat of the Duke of Brunswick to
suppress the Revolution, and, if Paris resisted him, to burn it to the
ground. He be- came friends with an officer in the Revolutionary Army,
Michel de Beau- puis, who “by birth ranked with the most noble,” but now
felt obliged to defend France against invaders. This classless
dedication moved Words- worth to consider how he himself could be useful
in the cause. But he felt too frail to bear arms, and knew too little
French to serve in a civilian or political post. He settled down at
Orleans to study the language, so be- witching on a woman’s lips, so
bewilderingly deceptive in orthography.</p>
<p>He found it most charming, but largely superfluous, in Annette
Vallon, a warmhearted, warm-blooded young woman who gave him not only
instruc- tion but herself. In return he could give her nothing but his
youthful seed. He was twenty-one, she was twenty-five. When the result
announced it- self, Annette thought she deserved a wedding ring, but
William wondered: could he, who knew more Latin than French, survive as
a husband in France; or could she, as a pagan Catholic, survive in
Puritan England?</p>
<p>On October 29, 1792, he left her in Orleans and moved to Paris.
Before parting he signed a paper authorizing a M. Dufour to represent
him as the absent father at the christening of Annette’s expected child.
6 It was born on December 15, and was named Caroline.</p>
<p>By that time Wordsworth, in Paris, was immersed in the Revolution. He
attended meetings of the Jacobin Club, visited the Legislative Assembly,
made friends of Girondins. The fever of the day came upon him; he felt
himself at the center of world-shaking, history-making events:</p>
<p>Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive;</p>
<p>But to be young was very Heaven ! 7</p>
<p>Then a letter reached him from brother Richard refusing further
funds, and insisting upon his immediate return. As the Revolution did
not offer to sup- port him, he crossed to London, and tried to thaw the
frozen arteries of familial finance. Brother Richard remained lovingly
stern. Uncle William Cookson, rector of Fornsett and host of Dorothy,
closed his purse and doors to the youngster whose education had been
paid for as a prelude to sacer- dotal services, but who now seemed to
have turned into a shiftless Jacobin.</p>
<p>William was sorely hurt; he had adopted poetry as a profession, and
felt entitled, as a consecrated devotee of a Muse, to fraternal and
avuncular sup- port. Defiantly, he associated with the radicals who
frequented Johnson’s bookshop, and he continued his public support of
the Revolution. In the last fifty lines of Descriptive Sketches, which
he wrote and published in 1793, he praised the Revolution as the
liberation not of one nation only, but potentially of all mankind; and
privately, as he posthumously confessed, he rejoiced in French victories
even “when Englishmen by thousands were o’erthrown, left without glory
on the field.” 8 On February 1, 1793, France declared war on England; in
March a letter reached Wordsworth from An- nette begging him to come
back to her, but the Channel was closed to civil-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>421</p>
<p>ian travel. He did not forget her, the thought of her burned his
conscience; we shall see him, nine years later, trying to make some
amends. During those years Annette became an ardent royalist, and
William slowly discovered the virtues of the British Constitution.</p>
<p>His faith in the Revolution waned when the Terror guillotined the
Giron- dins whom he had admired (1794). About this time he was much
impressed by Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice; it
encouraged his radi - calism, but it warned against revolutions as
feeding on revolutionists. In 1795 he met Godwin himself, and was
charmed; seven times in that year he called upon the famous philosopher
in his home. Even when he himself had become an ardent conservative he
remained Godwin’s friend till death inter - vened (1836).</p>
<p>An added inducement to sobriety came when, in 1795, Raisley Calvert
bequeathed Wordsworth nine hundred pounds. Recklessly the poet lent
three hundred of this legacy to his notoriously improvident friend Basil
Montagu, and two hundred to Montagu’s intimate, Charles Douglas— in both
cases on mortgages hopefully paying ten percent. Wordsworth reckoned
that the fifty-pounds-a-year interest (it was very irregularly paid),
plus the remaining four hundred, would not suffice, even with Dorothy’s
annu - ity of twenty pounds, to finance his sister’s dream of a cottage
where they might live in a modest condominium of poetry and love. But
just then an- other friend, John Pinney of Bristol, offered them,
furnished and free, his Racedown Lodge in Dorset. So, on September 26,
1795, Wordsworth and Dorothy set up housekeeping there, and there they
remained till June, 1797, in unexpected comfort and bliss.</p>
<p>We picture him, now twenty-five, as of middle height, gaunt and
slightly stooped; his thin careless hair falling around his collar and
his ears; his dark and somber eyes looking down along an inquiring and
slightly aggressive nose; his trousers of pastoral plaid, his coat a
loose brown frock, a black handkerchief serving as a tie. He was frail
in body, strong in energy, spirit, and will; he could outwalk the
sturdiest of his guests, and could with his own arms and axe keep his
fires burning with cut or gathered wood. He was as sensitive as a poet,
as nervous as a woman; he suffered from headaches, especially when he
composed. He was often moody, inclined to hypo- chondria, easily moved
to tears; once he thought of killing himself 9 — but that is a universal
bravado. He was acquisitive, proud, self-centered, sure of his superior
sensitivity, understanding, and (forgiving that carelessly fallen seed)
moral excellence. But he was modest before Nature, holding himself her
servant and her voice for the instruction of mankind.</p>
<p>Dorothy was his opposite: small and frail; earning her face of tan
with many walks under the sun; selflessly absorbed — or selfishly
delighted — in serving her brother, never doubting his genius, keeping
their shelter clean and warm for him, tending him in his illnesses,
searching out the subtlest beauties and wonders in nature with what he
called “the shooting lights of thy wild eyes,” 10 and jotting down those
percepts in her journals for her remembrance and his use. She gave ears
and hands as well as eyes; she never</p>
<p>42 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>(visibly) tired of hearing him recite his verses, or of copying them
readably. He loved her in return, deeply but without forbidden passion,
as the dearest and least demanding of his acolytes, as a precious
delicate lateral tendril of himself.</p>
<p>To turn their home into a family, and add £ 50 to their annual
revenue, they took under their care the three-year-old Basil, son of
Basil Montagu; and they rejoiced to see their young ward “metamorphosed
from a shiver - starved plant into a lusty, blooming, fearless boy.” 11
In the spring of 1797 Dorothy’s friend Mary Hutchinson came down from
Penrith to stay with them till June 5. And on June 6, answering in his
own exuberant way an invitation sent him by Wordsworth, a youth of
twenty-five, pregnant with poetry, leaped over a gate, bounded over a
field, and entered power- fully into the lives of William and Dorothy
Wordsworth. It was Coleridge.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>COLERIDGE: 1 772-94</li>
</ol>
<p>He is the most interesting of our conglomerate, the most varied in
his talents, charms, ailments, ideas, and faults. He ran the gamut from
idealism to disaster in love and morals, in literature and philosophy.
He plagiarized from as many authors as he inspired. No aliquot portion
of a chapter can do him justice.</p>
<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge was bom October 21, 1772, the tenth and final
child of John Coleridge, schoolmaster and then vicar at Ottery St. Mary
in Devonshire, an advanced mathematician, a scholar in classical and
Ori- ental languages, the author of A Critical Latin Grammar. “S. T.
C.,” as the son would later sign himself, stumbled under this learned
heritage, and lightened it by shedding Greek or Latin tags in almost
every paragraph.</p>
<p>From his third to his seventh year, he later recalled,</p>
<p>I became fretful and timorous, and a tell-tale; the schoolboys drove
me from play, and were always tormenting me, and hence I took no
pleasure in boyish sports, but read incessantly…. At six years old I had
read Belisarius, Robinson Crusoe,… and the Arabian Nights
Entertainments…. I was haunted by specters;… I became a dreamer, and
acquired an indisposition to all bodily activity; and I was fretful, and
inordinately passionate,… slothful… , hated by the boys; — because I
could read and spell, and had… a memory and under- standing forced into
almost an unnatural ripeness, 1 was flattered and wondered at by all the
old women. And so I became very vain,… and before I was eight years old
I was a character. Sensibility, imagination, vanity, sloth, and feelings
of deep and bitter contempt for all who traversed the orbit of my
understand- ing, were even then prominent. 12</p>
<p>The death of his father (1779), whom he had loved passionately, was
an unsettling blow to Samuel. Two years later he was sent for further
educa- tion to Christ’s Hospital, which kept a charity school in London.
The food was poor, the discipline was severe; he spoke in later life of
the ignominious punishments that fell doubly hard upon a lad who felt
that he had been for- gotten by his family. They wanted him to be a
clergyman; he longed to be</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>423</p>
<p>a shoemaker. In 1830 (by which time his memory had become especially
unreliable) he told of his one “just” flogging:</p>
<p>When I was about thirteen, I went to a shoemaker, and begged him to
take me as his apprentice. He, being an honest man, immediately brought
me to Bowyer [headmaster], who got into a great rage, knocked me down,
and… asked me why I had made myself such a fool? to which I answered
that I had a great desire to be a shoemaker, and that I hated the
thought of being a clergy- man. “Why so?” said he.— “Because, to tell
you the truth, sir,” said I, “I am an infidel.” For that, without more
ado, Bowyer flogged me. 13</p>
<p>Obviously he had plucked some forbidden fruit, perhaps from the cir-
culating library in King Street. There, he later claimed in his
monumental way,</p>
<p>I read through [all the books in] the catalogue, folios and all,
whether I understood them or not,… running all risks in skulking out to
get the two volumes which I was entitled to have daily. Conceive what I
must have been at fourteen; I was in a continual fever. My whole being
was, with eyes closed to every object of present sense, to crumple
myself up in a sunny corner, and read, read, read. 14</p>
<p>There is, of course, some vain enlargement here. In any case he did
so well at Christ’s Hospital School that his family arranged to have him
accepted as a “sizar” (on a work -and-study scholarship) at Jesus
College, Cambridge (1791). There he attempted higher mathematics, and
the most difficult Greek. “I am reading Pindar, and composing Greek
verses like a mad dog…. At my leisure hours I translate Anacreon…. I am
learning to play the violin.” 15</p>
<p>As always in Coleridge, we must allow for hyperbole. In any case
he</p>
<p>neglected his health, and came down (1793) with rheumatic fever. He
found relief from the pain by taking opium. It was at that time a common
anodyne, but Coleridge fell into its habitual use. His scholastic pace
slowed, and he allowed himself more interest in current affairs.
However, he outran the allowance sent him by his family, fell into debt,
was harried by his credi- tors, and, in a desperate effort to escape
them, suddenly left Cambridge, and (December, 1793) enlisted in the army
that was being formed to fight Franc e. His brother George bought
Samuel’s release for forty guineas, and persuaded him to return to
Cambridge. He managed to graduate in 1794, but without a degree. This
hardly disturbed him, for meanwhile he had dis- covered utopia.</p>
<p>He had been prepared for this by losing his religious faith; heaven
and utopia are compensatory buckets in the well of hope. The French
Revolu- tion had stirred him as it stirred almost every literate and
unmoneyed youth in England. Now, in the spring of 1794, word came from
his friend Robert Allen at Oxford that several of the students there
were eager to reform British institutions and ways. One student,
reported Allen, was especially brilliant and had written verses
celebrating social revolt. Could Coleridge come down to Oxford and meet
these youths? In June, 1794, Coleridge came.</p>

<p>Of the Lake triad Robert Southey was the worst poet and the best man.
He was born at Bristol, son of a clothier; but from that mercantile
environ- ment his wealthy aunt, Elizabeth Tyler, often borrowed him to
be polished in the genteel society of Bath. At fourteen he was sent to
the prestigious Westminster School in London, where, doubtless
surreptitiously, he read Voltaire, Rousseau, Gibbon, and Goethe’s
Werther, and wrote some epic poetry and rebellious prose. His attack
upon corporal punishment, in the school magazine called The Flagellant,
infuriated the headmaster, who felt that he had been disarmed. Robert
was expelled just as graduation neared, but somehow he was admitted into
Balliol College, Oxford, in December,</p>
<ol start="1792" type="1">
<li>There he continued his secret operations — writing an epic, Joan of
Arc, in which he praised the French Revolution. He was engaged upon a
verse drama about Wat Tyler, the English revolutionist of 1381, when
Coleridge arrived.</li>
</ol>
<p>The older found the younger man in a brown study, for Robespierre had
sent the lustiest leaders of the Revolution — Danton and Desmoulins — to
the guillotine; were the Rights of Man ending in competitive homicide?
Cole- ridge comforted him: Europe, he explained, was decadent, worn out
with history; but every week or so, fro m Southey’s native Bristol, a
ship sailed to an America spacious, fertile, and republican. Why should
not Coleridge and Southey organize a group of stout English lads and
lasses, get them soundly married, migrate with them to Pennsylvania, and
set up a communal colony on the lovely shores of the Susquehanna’s
unpolluted stream? All that was necessary was that each male should
contribute £ 125 to the common fund. Each couple should have an equal
voice in ruling the colony, and so Cole- ridge named it a
“pantisocracy.”</p>
<p>To raise their own shares of the cost the two founding fathers joined
in writing a verse drama, The Fall of Robespierre; it was published, but
had no sale. Southey sold Joan of Arc to Cottle of Bristol for fifty
guineas. The degreeless graduates lectured in Bristol, and earned enough
to raise Southey to proposal point; Edith Fricker accepted him, and they
were married (No- vember 14, 1795). Edith’s sister Mary had already
accepted Robert Lovell and pantisocracy. Now, said Southey, it was
extremely desirable that Cole- ridge should love and marry the third
sister, Sara.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth Tyler disowned him as lost to gentility by his
lowly</p>
<p>marriage and subversive ideas, Southey accepted an invitation to
visit Lisbon as companion to an uncle who was chaplain to the British
Embassy there. The trip broadened the young pundit’s borders; he
traveled in Spain as well as Portugal; when he returned to England (May,
1796) he discovered that he loved it, and pantisocracy faded with his
youth. He studied law, found work as a journalist, and time to write
more unmemorable epics, and some famous ballads, like “The Battle of
Blenheim.” In 1803, armed with a</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE LAKE POETS 425</p>
<p>friendly annuity of £ 160, he settled down in Greta Hall, Keswick,
hardly suspecting that he would stay there to the end of his life.</p>
<p>V. COLERIDGE: 1 794-97</p>
<p>He was a cross between lively nerves and hesitant will. He loved Mary
Evans of London, but shrank from the task of maintaining her in her
wonted style; she liked his rich and ebullient spirit, but had no faith
in its earning power. She turned away, and he resigned himself to Sara
Fricker, who, plain and penniless, could keep house and bear children,
but could not inspire odes.</p>
<p>To finance his prospective marriage and his lingering dream, he
delivered more lectures in Bristol, charging a shilling for each
admission (January to June, 1795). These Condones ad Populum were
recklessly radical: they de- nounced the Established Church as the
servant of the rich and knowing no Lord but the lord of the manor. They
condemned the war with France as an attempt to suppress the Revolution
and turn back the march of history. They excused the Terror as a r
esponse to “Pitt’s War,” and they denounced the “Gag Bills” as
governmental efforts to silence the public will. They drew small though
enthusiastic audiences, but on the proceeds Coleridge took Sara Fricker
to the altar (October 4, 1795).</p>
<p>In that same autumn he first met Wordsworth. William was only two
years older than Samuel, but he had experienced the Revolution, had seen
utopia in the flesh. He shared the younger man’s dread of a Bourbon
restora - tion, but he could not interest himself in Pennsylvania; the
battlefield of ideas was in Europe; and as to the splendor of the
Susquehanna, why not be satisfied with the glory of the English Lakes?
Coleridge was only half con- vinced, but he put it in his tablets to
watch this William grow, and perhaps learn from him how to ride the
rapids of life.</p>
<p>He filled many tablets with gleanings from the books and souls he
met. He read widely, eagerly, and in a dozen fields, about men, animals,
plants, sciences, religions, philosophies, nations, literatures, arts.
His was one of the hungriest, most absorbent, and most retentive minds
of which we have any record. His memory became a storehouse from which
he drew, to the end of his life, for images, ideas, phrases, arguments,
even paragraphs. Too often he neglected to mention, or pleasantly
forgot, the source of his catch, and carelessly mingled his own notions
with borrowed goods. In the end the weight of his stores, and their
unmanageable variety, were too great for a mind wedded to freedom and
divorced from order. The storeroom nearly collapsed under its
stores.</p>
<p>Perhaps to relieve his memory, or to feed his wife, he hit upon the
idea of printing and selling a magazine almost entirely written by
himself. He buttonholed his acquaintances, and conscripted his lecture
auditors, as po- tential subscribers, and scattered a “Prospectus: That
all may know the</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>February 1796 will be published No. 1 (price four pence) of a
miscellany to be published every eighth day, under the name of The
Watchman, by S. T. Coleridge, author of Addresses to the People.” 16
Here in print, as in his lec - tures, he spoke as a bridge-burning
radical against the war, slavery, shackling of the press, and especially
against sales taxes as falling cruelly upon the common man. 17 But he
did not recommend universal adult suffrage, male or female. “We should
be bold in the avowal of pol itical truth among those only whose minds
are susceptible of reasoning; and never to the multitude, who, ignorant
and needy, must necessarily act from the impulse of inflamed passions.”
18 — Coleridge found it unbearable to fill thirty-two pages every eight
days with his own pen; increasingly they depended upon alien glean- ings
not always acknowledged. Some watchful readers protested. Circula- tion
fell, debts rose. After ten numbers The Watchman died.</p>
<p>On September 1, 1796, Coleridge’s first child was bom. He named him
David Hartley, from the English protagonist of the associationist
psychol- ogy. Here was a delectable face, but another mouth to feed.
Meanwhile he himself was feeling ailments of heart and lungs, and was
relying more and more upon opium to ease the pain. He was near the end
of his resources when a friendly liberal, Thomas Poole, offered him, at
the nominal rent of seven pounds a year, a small house near his own at
Nether Stowey, near Bridgewater. On December 31, 1796, Coleridge, Sara,
and David moved in. Sara made the place comfortable and clean. “S. T.
C.” worked in an ad - joining garden, helped to care for Poole’s poultry
and pigs, and wrote mem - orable, nonnegotiable poetry.</p>
<p>About this time, according to a memory always rich and adorned,
“Kubla Khan” was conceived, and for the most part written, in a
miraculous dream:</p>
<p>In the summer of 1797 the Author, then in ill-health, had retired to
a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton…. In consequence of a
slight in- disposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects
of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading…
in Purchas’s Pilgrim - age: “Here the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to
be built, and a stately gar- den thereunto. And thus ten miles of
fertile ground were enclosed with a wall.” The Author continued for
about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses,
during which time he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not
have composed less than from two to three hundred lines,… without any
sensation or consciousness of effort. On awakening he appeared to
himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his
pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are
here preserved.</p>
<p>This famous preface has been interpreted as a fable with which
Coleridge deceived himself or others into accepting the immaculate
conception and brief continuance of “Kubla Khan.” However, it is not
unknown that an author, after manufacturing phrases during the day,
should continue to do so in a dream; but almost always these jewels sink
into unconsciousness as the sleeper wakes. Perhaps in this case the
opium induced not only the dream but the delusion that the composition
was part of the dream. In any case Coleridge, with his characteristic
skill of rhyme and alliteration, transformed Purchas’ prose into one of
the most tempting torsos in th e English language.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>427</p>
<p>Perhaps a more important event than “Kubla,” in Coleridge’s year
1797, was an invitation to visit the Wordsworths at Racedown. He excused
him- self to Sara and David, and started off to walk nearly all the
intervening miles. He sighted his goal on June 6, and ran excitedly
across a field to his brother poet’s door. When William and Dorothy
opened it, and their hearts, to him, a new epoch began in these three
lives, and one of the most fruitful collaborations in literary
history.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>A THREESOME: 1 797-98</li>
</ol>
<p>Coleridge was then at the height of his charm. His whole body,
despite its secret pains and poisons, was responsive to the lively
interests of his mind. His handsome face — sensual mouth, finely formed
nose, gray eyes sparkling with eagerness and curiosity, his careless
black hair curling about his neck and ears — made him immediately
attractive, especially to Dorothy. It did not take her long to fall in
love with him in her shy way, always keeping William unchallengeable on
his pedestal. Coleridge was taken aback by her tininess, yet was drawn
to her by her quiet sympathy; this was a friend who would take him with
all his faults, and would overlook his shiftlessness to see his warm
feeling, his strangely recondite fancies, his shaken and bewildered
faith, the frightened malaise of a poet lost amid fac- tories and wars.
For the present, however, he hardly saw this timid sprite of a girl,
being overwhelmed by her brother.</p>
<p>Here, he realized, in this man with calm, grave face, high forehead,
medi- tative eyes, was a real and living poet, sensitive to every
vibration of things and souls, shunning the economic maelstrom, quietly
making it his life task to find fit evocative words for his insights and
dreams. Coleridge, who at that time — with The Ancient Mariner already
growing in him — was the greater poet of the two, felt the dedication in
this man, envied him his free- dom to give himself totally to poetry,
and may have wondered whether a sister is not better than a wife. “I
feel myself a little man by his side” he wrote, soon after his coming;
“and yet I do not think myself the less man than I formerly thought
myself. William is a very great man, the only man to whom at all times
and in all modes of excellence I feel myself inferior.” 18</p>
<p>So began three weeks of mutual stimulation. Each read his poems to
the other. Wordsworth read more, Coleridge talked more. “His
conversation,” Dorothy wrote, “teemed with soul, mind, and spirit. Then
he is so benevo - lent, so good-tempered and cheerful. His eye… speaks
every emotion of his animated mind.” 20</p>
<p>Usually such a triune love affair cools after three weeks, but then
Cole- ridge, loath to let it end, begged William and Dorothy to
accompany him to Nether Stowey for some return of their hospitality.
They went with him, expecting to come back to Racedown soon; but friend
Poole, learning that their lease would soon expire and could not be
renewed, found for them a handsome cottage, furnished, for ^’23 a year,
in Alfoxden, four miles from</p>
<p>428 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Coleridge; and there William and Dorothy took comfort and inspiration
for the next fifteen months.</p>
<p>In that happy period there was much walking between one nucleus and
the other of the poetic ellipse: sometimes the two men, sometimes
Coleridge and Dorothy, sometimes the three. There was a triple exchange
of feelings, observations, and ideas: Wordsworth encouraged Coleridge to
let imagina- tion be his guide; Coleridge enlarged Wordsworth’s
acquaintance with the philosophers, and challenged him to undertake an
epic. Years later, in The Prelude, Wordsworth reminded his wandering
friend of “the buoyant spirits / That were our daily portion when we
first / Together wantoned in wild Poesy.” 21 Dorothy was their bond and
catalyst; she warmed them with her praise and eager listening,
challenged them with the keenness and depth of her perceptions, and
united them as their spiritual bride. They were, said Coleridge, three
persons in one soul. 22</p>
<p>Both Wordsworth and Coleridge must have looked into the journal that
Dorothy began at Alfoxden on January 20, 1798. They must have been
struck by a line on its second page: “The hum of insects, that noiseless
noise which lives in the summer air.” But Sara Coleridge would have been
struck rather with entries for February 3 to 1 2 :</p>
<p>Feb. 3rd: Walked with Coleridge over the hills….</p>
<p>Feb. 4th: Walked a great part of the way to Stowey with
Coleridge….</p>
<p>Feb. 5th: Walked to Stowey with Coleridge….</p>
<p>Feb. nth: Walked with Coleridge near to Stowey.</p>
<p>Feb. 12th: Walked alone to Stowey. Returned in the evening with Cole-
ridge. 23</p>
<p>Sara was not happy over this ambulatory romance; it seemed sexually
inno- cent, but where would it end?</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>LYRICAL BALLADS: 1798</li>
</ol>
<p>Another stimulant came to Coleridge in January, 1798: Josiah and</p>
<p>Thomas Wedgwood — sons and heirs of the Josiah Wedgwood (1730-95) who
had made his pottery famous throughout Europe — offered the almost
penniless poet an annuity of one hundred fifty pounds (,750) on condi-
tion that he devote himself wholly to poetry and philosophy. Coleridge
wel- comed the gift in a letter of January 17, and proceeded, in an
ecstasy of cre- ation, to complete The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.</p>
<p>Armed with this proof of potency, he proposed to Wordsworth that they
should pool their new poems in collaborative volumes that would earn
them enough money to finance a trip to Germany. He hoped that a year in
Ger- many would teach him enough of the language and the culture to let
him read in the original, and with understanding, those masterpieces
which, from Kant to Goethe, had given Germany the unquestioned lead in
European philosophy, and had brought it at least to rivalry with England
and France in literature. Wordsworth was not enthusiastic about Germany,
but France</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>4 2 9</p>
<p>and north Italy were controlled by the Revolution; he fell in with
Cole- ridge’s plan.</p>
<p>In April, 1798, they invited publisher Cottle to come over from
Bristol to hear their latest verses. He came, listened, and advanced
thirty pounds for the copyright. He wished to publish also the names of
the authors, but Coleridge refused. “Wordsworth’s name,” he said to
Cottle, “is nothing, and mine stinks.” 24</p>
<p>Eighteen years later Coleridge explained the theory behind the
collabo- ration:</p>
<p>It was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons and
charac- ters supernatural, or at least romantic;… Mr. Wordsworth, on the
other hand, was to propose to himself, as his object, to give the charm
of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to
the supernatural, by awaken- ing the mind’s attention to the lethargy of
custom, and directing it to the love - liness and the wonders of the w
orld before us…. With this view I wrote “The Ancient Mariner,” and was
preparing, among other pieces, “The Dark Ladie” and the “Christabel,” in
which I should have more nearly realised my ideal. 25</p>
<p>Probably the theory took form after the poems had been written. So
with Wordsworth’s explanation, prefixed to the first edition:</p>
<p>The majority of the following poems are to be considered as
experiments. They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far
the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society
is adapted to the pur- poses of poetic pleasure. Readers accustomed to
the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers, if they
persist in reading this book to its conclusion, will perhaps frequently
have to struggle with feelings of strange- ness and awkwardness; they
will look round for poetry, and will be induced to inquire by what
species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that
title. It is desirable that such readers… should not suffer the soli-
tary word Poetry , a word of very disputed meaning, to stand in the way
of their gratification….</p>
<p>Readers of superior judgement may disapprove of the style in which
many of these pieces are executed…. It will appear to them that, wishing
to avoid the prevalent faults of the day, the author has sometimes
descended too low, and that many of the expressions are too familiar and
not of sufficient dignity. It is apprehended that the more conversant
the reader is with our elder writ- ers,… the fewer complaints of this
kind will he have to make. 26</p>
<p>Prose interfered with their poetry: the owner of the Alfoxden house
noti- fied the Wordsworths that their lease could not be renewed beyond
June 30,</p>
<ol start="1798" type="1">
<li>On June 25 William and Dorothy left for Bristol to negotiate with
Cottle. On July 10 they took a ferry across the River Severn, and walked
ten miles in Wales to Tintern Abbey. Near this “very beautiful ruin,”
and on the way back to Bristol, Wordsworth composed the first draft of
the poem that was added as the concluding piece of the Lyrical
Ballads.</li>
</ol>
<p>The little book was published on October 4, 1798, nineteen days after
the unavowed authors had left for Germany. The title was fitting:
Coleridge’s main contributions were lineal descendants of old English
ballads — tales in songlike verse; and most of Wordsworth’s
contributions were simple lyrics of simple life, in the almost
monosyllabic language of the English peasantry.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>The book opened with The Rime of the Ancient Mariner; this occupied
fif- teen of the 1 17 pages; it was the longest entry, and perhaps the
best, though England came only slowly to realize this, and Wordsworth
never.</p>
<p>The Rime has indeed many faults, but we must not stress, among these,
the absurdity of the tale; Coleridge had entered a realm of mystery and
imagination in which anything could happen, and mighty events might flow
from trifling incidents. He had to depend upon imagination, for he had
never been to sea, 27 and he had to borrow from travel books for
maritime terms and moods. Nevertheless he caught the mystic aura of old
legends, the marching rhythm of old ballads; and the old mariner carries
us with him almost to the end. It is, of course, one of the greatest
lyrics in the English language.</p>
<p>Wordsworth’s contributions were mostly examples of his finding wisdom
in simple souls. Some of these poems, like “The Idiot Boy” and “Simon
Lee,” were hilariously satirized by reviewers; but which of us has not
sym - pathized with a mother’s patient love for her harmlessly feeble
-minded child? (One line of that understanding poem tells of “the green
grass— you almost hear it growing”; 28 was this snatched from Dorothy?)
Then, after lingering with his rural types, Wordsworth concluded the
book with the meditative “Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern
Abbey.” Here he gave supreme expression to his feeling that nature and
God (Spinoza’s D eus sive Natura) are one, speaking not only through the
miracles of growth but also through those awesome and (to human short
sight) seemingly destruc- tive forces that Turner was then worshiping in
paint. To his wanderings in woods and fields, his rowing on placid lakes
and scrambling over massive rocks, to a thousand cries or whispers from
a thousand forms of life, even from the supposedly inanimate world —</p>
<p>To them I may have owed… that blessed mood,</p>
<p>In which the burthen of the mystery,</p>
<p>In which the heavy and the weary weight</p>
<p>Of all this unintelligible world,</p>
<p>Is lightened…</p>
<p>While with an eye made quiet by the power</p>
<p>Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,</p>
<p>We see into the life of things. 29</p>
<p>And then he rose to his finest profession of faith:</p>
<p>I have learned</p>
<p>To look on Nature, not as in the hour</p>
<p>Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes</p>
<p>The still, sad music of humanity.</p>
<p>Not harsh nor grating, though of ample power</p>
<p>To chasten and subdue. And I have felt</p>
<p>A presence that disturbs me with the joy</p>
<p>Of elevated thoughts: a sense sublime</p>
<p>Of something far more deeply interfused,</p>
<p>Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns.</p>
<p>And the round ocean, and the living air,</p>
<p>CHAP, xxr)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>43 1</p>
<p>And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;</p>
<p>A motion and a spirit, that impels</p>
<p>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</p>
<p>And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still</p>
<p>A lover of the meadows and the woods,</p>
<p>And mountains; and… recognize,</p>
<p>In nature and the language of the sense,</p>
<p>The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul</p>
<p>Of all my moral being. 30</p>
<p>Dorothy too had reached this healing, unifying creed, and found it
not inconsistent with her Christian faith. At the close of his hymn
Wordsworth added a paean to her as his sister soul, and bade her keep to
the end</p>
<p>Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold</p>
<p>Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon</p>
<p>Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;</p>
<p>And let the misty mountain winds be free</p>
<p>To blow against thee;… and, in after years.</p>
<p>When these wild ecstasies shall be matured</p>
<p>Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind</p>
<p>Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,</p>
<p>Thy memory be as a dwelling place</p>
<p>For all sweet sounds and harmonies… 31</p>
<p>Lyrical Ballads was not favorably received. “They are not liked by
any,” reported Mrs. Coleridge — a wife forgivably envious of her
husband’s Muse. The reviewers were so busy exposing loose joints in The
Mariner, and loose sentiment in Wordsworth’s ditties, that none of them
seems to have recog - nized The Mariner as a future fixture in all
anthologies, though some no- ticed the devout pantheism of “Tintern
Abbey.” The little book sold five hundred copies in two years, and
Coleridge ascribed some of these sales to a sailor who thought, from the
Rime, that the volume was a naval songbook. Wordsworth ascribed the
tardiness of the sale to the inclusion of The An- cient Mariner.</p>
<p>In 1799, while Coleridge was in Germany, Wordsworth prepared a sec-
ond edition of the Ballads. On June 24 he wrote to Cottle: “From what I
gather it seems that The Ancyent Mariner e has upon the whole been an
injury to the volume. [This may have been true.]… If the volume should
come to a second edition I would put in its place some little things
which would be more likely to suit the common taste.” 32 The Mariner was
ad - mitted to the second edition, with a (disarming?) note from
Wordsworth admitting its faults but pointing out its excellences.</p>
<p>This edition (January, 1801) contained a new poem by Wordsworth,
“Michael”— a tale leisurely told, in blank verse, of an
eighty-four-year-old shepherd, loyal in labor, firm in morals, loved in
his village, and of his son, who moved to the city and became a
dissolute degenerate. A new preface by Wordsworth announced in detail,
and in sentences now famous, his theory of poetry: Any object or idea
may generate poetry if it is borne on feeling and carries significance;
and any style or language can be poetic if it transmits such feeling and
significance. “Poetry is the spontaneous over -</p>
<p>43 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>flow of powerful feelings; it takes its origin from emotion
recollected in tranquillity”; 33 the artist himself must have controlled
his emotion before he can give it form. But such emotions are not
confined to the literate or the elite; they can appear in the unlettered
peasant as well as in the scholar or the lord; and perhaps in greater
purity and clarity in the simpler soul. Nor does the expression need a
special poetic vocabulary or style; the best style is the simplest, the
best words are the least discolored with pretense or pomp. Ideally the
poet should speak in the language of the common man; but even learned
words may be poetic if they convey the feeling and the moral force.</p>
<p>For in the end it is the moral import that counts in every art. Of
what use is our own skill with sound or form if it be not to seek
readier acceptance of a clarifying, healing, or ennobling thought? “A
great poet ought, to a certain degree, to rectify men’s feelings,… to
render them more sane, pure, and permanent, in short, more consonant to
nature — that is, to eternal nature and the great spirit of things. He
ought to travel before men occasionally, as well as at their sides.” 34
The ideal poet, or painter, or sculptor is a philoso - pher clothing
wisdom in art, revealing significance through form.</p>
<p>That preface played a part in history, for it helped to put an end to
the fancy language, the class prejudices, the classical references, the
mythologi- cal frills that had often littered the poetry and oratory of
the English Au- gustan Age. It declared the rights of feeling, and — in
the most unromantic style — gave another welcome to romance. Wordsworth
himself was of clas- sic mold and mood, given to thought and rule; he
provided the tranquillity of recollection, while Coleridge brought
emotion and imagination. It was an excellent collaboration.</p>

<p>Not waiting to see their book published, and helped by an additional
gift to Coleridge by Josiah Wedgwood, and an advance to Wordsworth by
his brother Richard, the two poets and Dorothy sailed on September 15,
1798, from Yarmouth to Hamburg. There, after an uninspiring visit to the
aging poet Klopstock, they separated: Coleridge went to study in the
University of Gottingen, and Wordsworth and Dorothy took a diligence to
the “free Imperial city” of Goslar, at the northern foot of the Harz
Mountains. There,</p>
<p>Meanwhile Coleridge did his best, at Gottingen, to become a German.
He</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>learned the language, and became entangled in German philosophy.
Finding no explanation of mind in the psychology of materialism, he
abandoned the mechanistic associationism of Hartley, and adopted the
idealism of Kant and the theology of Schelling, who presented Nature and
Mind as two aspects of God. He heard or read the lectures of August
Wilhelm von Schlegel on Shakespeare, and took from them many a notion
for his own later lectures on the Elizabethan drama. Drunk with ideas
and abstractions, he lost his old flair for feeling and imagery, and
abandoned poetry for philosophy. “The poet in me is dead,” he wrote, “I
have forgotton how to make a rhyme.” 36 He became the bearer of German
philosophy to England.</p>
<p>In July, 1799, he left Germany and returned to Nether Stowey. But a
year’s absence from his wife had dulled the edge of husbandry; Sara Cole
- ridge was no longer a romance, and both husband and wife were darkened
by the recent death of their second child, Berkeley. In October,
restless, he went north to see Wordsworth at Sockburn. On that visit he
held too long the hand of Sara Hutchinson, Mary’s sister; some mystic
current passed from the woman to the man, and Coleridge plunged into his
third unhappy love affair. This Sara, mindful of his obligations to the
other, gave him affection, but no more. After two years of vain wooing
he resigned himself to defeat, and wrote a touching ode , “Dejection,”
as almost the last flash of his poetry. He accompanied Wordsworth on a
walking tour of the Lake District, each looking for a home. At Keswick
he thought he had found one, but an offer of employment on the Morning
Post deflected him to London. Mean- while Wordsworth had leased a
cottage thirteen miles farther south at Gras- mere. He returned to
Sockburn and won Dorothy’s consent to the move; and on December 17,
1799, brother and sister began their long passage, mostly on foot, from
Sockburn to Grasmere, over many miles of winter- hardened and rutted
roads. On December 2 1 they made their hearth in what Wordsworth called
“Town’s End,” and what came later to be called Dove Cottage. There they
lived the hardest and happiest years of their lives.</p>

<p>From May 14, 1800, to January 1 6, 1803, Dorothy kept her “Grasmere
Journal.” Through those 150 pages we are enabled to see and feel the
daily life of brother and sister, and later, briefly, of brother,
sister, and wife. The climate of Grasmere was not made for health: rain
or snow fell almost every day, and the winter’s cold— even with snow —
might reappear in June or July. 36 Sunny days were ecstasies, and the
occasional emergence of the moon was a transfiguring revelation. The
cottage was heated with coal in fireplace and stove, but sometimes,
Dorothy noted, “I could not sleep for sheer cold.” They took the weather
stoically, grateful for spr ing and the usual gentleness of the rain;
“it rained very mildly and sweetly” occurs repeatedly in the journal.
“Sometimes Grasmere looked so beautiful that my heart almost melted
away.” 37</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXMany a walk they took, together or apart, sometimes a mile to
Ambleside for mail, sometimes half a day’s journey to Keswick after
Coleridge had settled there. Wordsworth seemed content with his
sister-bride, calling her</p>
<p>The dear companion of my lonely walk.</p>
<p>My hope, my joy, my sister, my friend,</p>
<p>Or something dearer still, if reason knows</p>
<p>A dearer thought, or, in the heart of love,</p>
<p>There is a dearer name.</p>
<p>And as late as 1802 (the year of his marriage) he referred to her as
“my love.” 38 She was content to call him “Sweet brother.” 39</p>
<p>She now had an income of forty pounds, he seventy; this (added to
some dribblings from his publications), amounting to some one hundred
forty f iounds (,500?), was their yearly income. They had one or two
servants, or poverty was so general that many a woman, spouseless, was
willing to work for bed and board. Poet and sister dressed simply:
Dorothy in gar- ments usually made by herself, even to shoes; 40 William
in peasant garb, or in cast-off clothing sent him by friends. 41 But
they kept a vegetable gar- den, and sometimes caught fish in the lake.
Moreover, the journal records, “I made tarts and pies,” 42 “bread and
pies,” 43 “pies and cakes.” 44 William was pampered.</p>
<p>But he worked too. Part of each normal day he composed, usually on
his solitary walks, from which he returned to dictate lines to Dorothy.
Also he chopped wood; dug and planted in the garden; and “William
cleared a path to the necessary,” 45 — i.e., through the snow to the
outdoor privy. Add that Dorothy brewed ale, 46 and “we borrowed some
bottles for bot - tling rum.” 47 Despite the vegetables, William
suffered from hemorrhoids, 48 and (after 1805) from weakened sight, and
insomnia; many an evening Dorothy had to read him to sleep. 49</p>
<p>Those Theocritean days were suddenly confused by money and mar-
riage. On May 24, 1802, Sir James Lowther, Earl of Lonsdale, died,
leaving his property and title to his nephew, Sir William Lowther, who
arranged to pay the money owed by Sir James to the heirs of John
Wordsworth, Sr. Apparently four thousand pounds was divided among the
children. Though the shares of William and Dorothy were not paid till
1803, William felt that his reasonable expectations warranted him in at
last offering his hand to Mary Hutchinson.</p>
<p>But the memory of Annette Vallon rankled in his conscience. Should he
not clear up his relation with her before asking Mary to take him? On
July 9, 1 802, he and Dorothy left Grasmere by coach and foot for Mary’s
pres - ent home at Gallow Hill. On July 26 they left Gallow Hill by
coach for London. There, awed by the majesty of the city as seen in the
early morn- ing from Westminster Bridge, Wordsworth composed one of his
many memorable sonnets — “Earth has not anything to show more fair.” 50
They went on to Dover, took the packet across the Channel, and on July
31 found Annette and her nine-year-old daughter, Caroline, in waiting
for them in Calais.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>We do not know what agreement they came to; we know only that four-
teen years later, when Caroline married, Wordsworth, then prospering,
settled upon her an annuity of thirty pounds (50?). The four remained at
Calais for four weeks, walking the seashore in apparent accord. Words-
worth spun off another excellent sonnet — “It is a beauteous evening,
calm and free, / The holy time is quiet as a Nun / Breathless with
adoration,”— ending with a benediction for Caroline. On August 29
Wordsworth and Dorothy left for Dover and London. Apparently he was in
no hurry, for not until September 24 did brother and sister get back to
Gallow Hill. On October 4, 1802, William and Mary were married. No
presents came to the bride, for her relatives disapproved of Mary’s
marrying “a vaga - bond.” 51 Dorothy, who only recently had written of
William in her journal as “my Beloved,” could not trust herself to
attend the ceremony. “Her feelings were wrought to an almost
uncontrollable pitch.” 52 She went up - stairs and lay “almost
insensible” until Sara Hutchinson called to her that “they are coming”
back from the church. “This,” she wrote in her journal that afternoon,
“forced me from my bed where I lay, and I moved, I knew not how,… faster
than my strength could carry me, till I met my be- loved William and
fell upon his bosom. He and John Hutchinson led me to the house, and
there I stayed to welcome my dear Mary.”</p>
<p>That same day, in a chaise, the poet, his wife, and his sister began
the long ride to Grasmere. Dorothy gradually adapted herself to the
menage d trois, and soon learned to love Mary as a sister and
confidante. Besides, Mary brought to the household her own income of
twenty pounds a year. When the Lowther payment finally arrived, it
lifted the family to bourgeois com- fort. William became an ardent
patriot, and enlisted in the Grasmere Vol- unteers for the domestic
defense of England against Napoleon.</p>
<p>To the Grasmere idyl belong some of Wordsworth’s finest lyrics (“To a
Butterfly”) ; the powerful sonnet to Milton; the ode “Resolution and
Inde - pendence,” chiding his own melancholy; and (between 1803 and
1806) the most famous of all his compositions — “Intimations of
Immortality from Rec - ollections of Early Childhood.” Seldom ha s a
philosophic fantasy been so beautifully expressed.</p>
<p>It begins on a somber note about his dimming eyesight: “Turn where -
soe’er I may, / By night or day, / The things which I have seen I now
can see no more.” He makes this a symbol of our idealistic visions
vanishing with our youth — “Where is it now, the glory and the dream?”—
and he wonders may not the helpless miracles that we are at birth have
come from a heavenly home whose memory brightens our childhood and fades
as we grow:</p>
<p>Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;</p>
<p>The soul that rises with us, our life’s star,</p>
<p>Hath had elsewhere its setting,</p>
<p>And cometh from afar;</p>
<p>Not in entire forgetfulness,</p>
<p>And not in utter nakedness,</p>
<p>But trailing clouds of glory do we come</p>
<p>From God, who is our home;</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Heaven lies about us in our infancy!</p>
<p>Shades of the prison-house begin to close</p>
<p>Upon the growing Boy,</p>
<p>But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,</p>
<p>He sees it in his joy;…</p>
<p>At length the Man perceives it die away,</p>
<p>And fade into the light of common day.</p>
<p>Therefore the poet hails the child as</p>
<p>Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep</p>
<p>Thy heritage,…</p>
<p>Thou, over whom thy Immortality</p>
<p>Broods like the Day…</p>
<p>But even we adults have some dim consciousness of that lost horizon
—</p>
<p>Blank misgivings of a Creature</p>
<p>Moving about in worlds not realized…</p>
<p>Our souls have sight of that immortal sea</p>
<p>Which brought us hither,</p>
<p>Can in a moment travel thither,</p>
<p>And see the children sport upon the shore,</p>
<p>And hear the mighty waters rolling ever more.</p>
<p>This is anthropology theologized: the child, still an animal,
rejoicing in its animal motions, limbs, and freedom; resenting every
garment, prohibi- tion, and restraint; inwardly longing for the freedom
of animal life and movement in fields or woods, in seas or the air, and
slowly, resentfully los- ing those liberties as the child becomes adult
and the youth submits to civilization. But Wordsworth would have none of
this; he was recalling Pythagoras, and hoping to find in him some bridge
back to his childhood creed. The aging man seeks the womb of his
feelings as of his life.</p>
<p>X. LOVE, LABOR, AND OPIUM: 180O-IO</p>
<p>In April, 1800, having completed his assignment with the Morning
Post, Coleridge came to Grasmere for a three- week stay with the
Wordsworths. Dorothy told him that she had found a pleasant haven for
him and his family in a large house called Greta Hall, some three miles
out of Keswick. Coleridge went, saw the place in the glory of summer,
found in one room a library of five hundred volumes, many of them grist
to his mill, and en- thusiastically signed the lease. In August, 1800,
he took his wife Sara and son Hartley from Nether Stowey to their new
home. There, on September 14, Sara gave birth to another boy, whom they
named Derwent from a nearby lake and stream. Soon the winter revealed to
them their mistake: the cold and rain aggravated Coleridge’s tendencies
to asthma and rheumatic</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>437</p>
<p>Frequently he left her to walk the three plus thirteen miles to
Keswick and Grasmere to enjoy the stimulus of Wordsworth’s conversation
and Dorothy’s affectionate attentions; and only less frequently
Wordsworth and Dorothy walked north to brighten Coleridge’s day. In
November, 1800, Sara Hutchinson came down from Gallow Hill for a stay of
several months with Mary, William, and Dorothy at Dove Cottage; and
there Coleridge resumed his pursuit of her. With unintentionally cruel
simplicity, he con- fessed to his wife his love for the second Sara, and
asked for permission to love them both. Day by day she retreated from
him into motherly cares, and he into his brooding and his books.</p>
<p>He tried to complete the ballad- story “Christabel,” which he had
begun in 1797; but he found no “fine frenzy” in him, and left the tale
unfinished. Scott and Byron praised it in its manuscript form, and may
have taken some hints from it in theme, meter, and mood; finally (1816),
at Byron’s urging, Murray printed it. It is a haunting relic of a
vanished charm.</p>
<p>After a year at Greta Hall, Coleridge, his health and funds
exhausted, felt that he could not survive another winter at the Lakes.
He was glad to receive an invitation to join the staff of the Morning
Post as an editorial writer. On October 6, 1801, he went to Grasmere to
say goodbye; on the 9th Dorothy and Mary walked with him to Greta Hall;
on the 10th he left for London, and Mary and Dorothy walked back to
Grasmere. Dorothy wrote in her journal: “C. had a sweet day for his
ride. Every sight and every sound reminded me of him, dear dear fellow…
I was melancholy and could not talk, but at last I eased my heart by
weeping — nervous blub- bering, says William. It is not so. O how many,
many reasons I have to be anxious for him.” 53</p>
<p>Arrived in London, Coleridge worked hard writing “leaders,” in which
his growing conservatism went well with the policy of the Post, the
chief organ of the semiliberal Whigs — anti-ministry but pro-property.
He con- demned slavery and the “rotten boroughs” (which regularly sent
Tories to Parliament), denounced the government for rejecting Napoleon’s
offer of peace (1800), and almost ruined Pitt with a merciless analysis
of the Prime Minister as a statesman and as a man. However, he defended
private prop- erty as the necessary base of a progressive but orderly
society, and argued that that government is best which makes “each man’s
power proportionate to his property.” 54 He wrote vigorously and
effectively; the circulation of the Post rose substantially during his
stay. 55 But that year of hectic work contributed to the breakdown of
his health. When he returned to Greta Hall (1802) he was physically and
morally exhausted — the body ailing, the husband alienated, the lover
rejected, the will a slave to opium.</p>
<p>He had begun to take the drug as early as 1791, aged nineteen. 50 He
used it to quiet his nerves, to reduce pain, to induce sleep, to retard
— or conceal from himself — the deterioration of his heart and lungs,
perhaps to resign himself to defeat. And when elusive sleep came at
last, it became a host to frightening dreams, which he hinted at in “The
Pains of Sleep” ( 1 803) :</p>

<p>His notebooks tell of an imaginary people on the moon “exactly like

<p>Perhaps his ailments and drugs, though sometimes confusing his
thought and weakening his will, opened to him areas and vistas of
perception and imagination closed to normal minds. In any case his range
of knowledge was unsurpassed in his generation, leaving Wordsworth, in
this respect, far behind. He humbled himself before Wordsworth, but
Wordsworth could seldom talk about an ything but his poems, while
Coleridge’s conversation, even in his decay, had a range, vivacity, and
interest that impressed Carlyle, and might even have silenced Mme. de
Stael. What awed him in Words- worth was the older man’s concentration
of purpose a nd steadiness of will; Coleridge was more and more
substituting the wish for the will and imagi- nation for reality.</p>
<p>He marveled at his modesty, but he was intensely self-conscious,
found himself (but in this like Wordsworth and ourselves) the most
interesting of all subjects, and was secretly and aggressively proud. He
called attention to his honesty, his austere moral code, his
indifference to money or fame; but he longed for honors, plagiarized
happily, 60 borrowed money forget- fully, left his wife and children,
and allowed his friends to support them. Perhaps opium weakened his
sexual capacity, and allowed him to mistake fancy for performance.</p>
<p>In April, 1804, seeking to reduce his asthma and rheumatic fever with
the Mediterranean air and sun, he accepted a loan of a hundred pounds
from Wordsworth, 61 and sailed to Malta, then a crucial but disputed
bastion of British power. He took with him an ounce of crude opium and
nine ounces of laudanum. On the voyage, May 13, he wrote in his notebook
a desperate prayer:</p>
<p>O dear God! give me strength of soul to make one thorough Trial — if
I land at Malta / spite of all horrors to go through one month of
unstimulated Na- ture…. I am loving and kind-hearted and cannot do wrong
with impunity, but O! I am very, very weak — from my infancy have been
so — and I exist for the moment! — Have mercy on me, have mercy on me,
Father and God ! 62</p>
<p>For almost a year he seemed to recover his self-control. In July he
was appointed private secretary to Sir Alexander Ball, governor of
Malta, and in January, 1805, he was advanced to the more responsible
post of public secretary. He worked hard, and revealed surprising powers
of judgment and application. Then, after a year of service, he was so
exhausted that he re-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>lapsed into drug addiction. He left Malta, traveled in Sicily and
Italy, and returned to England (1806). By that time he was more than
ever dependent upon opium, checking its soporific action with
brandy.</p>
<p>On October 26, 1806, he met the Wordsworths at an inn in Kendal.</p>
<p>“Never,” wrote Dorothy under that date, “did I feel such a shock as
at first sight of him”; so fat that “his eyes are lost” in his s wollen
face, and only a momentary gleam appeared or the former “divine
expression of his countenance.” 63 He went on to Keswick, and asked his
wife for a separa - tion. She refused. He left her, taking with him son
Derwent, six years old. He transferred to his wife his Wedgwood annuity,
64 but Josiah Wedgwood withdrew his share of this in 1813. Southey,
established in Greta Hall since 1803, took over the care of his
sister-in-law. Coleridge was tided over the crisis by a gift of a
hundred pounds sent anonymously by his fellow addict De Quincey, and by
the lectures that he gave at the Royal Institution in 1808, 1809, and
1810.</p>
<p>In that year the great friendship ended. Its basis had been mutual
inspira- tion to poetry; that ceased when the font of poesy dried up in
Coleridge after 1800 through physical weakening, soporific opiates,
marital alien- ation, and enthrallment by philosophy. Wordsworth had
encouraged the exchange of Muses by suggesting to Coleridge that his
genius favored prose. Coleridge had been offended by learning that all
three Wordsworths had cautioned Sara Hutchinson against encouraging his
advances. The diver- gence became a chasm when, in a letter of May 31,
1809, Wordsworth warned Poole not to involve himself too heav ily in
Coleridge’s new maga - zine (1809- 10), The Friend. “As one of
Coleridge’s nearest and dearest friends,” Wordsworth wrote:</p>
<p>I give it to you as my deliberate opinion, formed upon proofs that
had been strengthening for years, that Coleridge neither will nor can
execute anything of important benefit either to himself, his family, or
mankind. Neither his talents nor his genius, mighty as they are, nor his
vast information, will avail him anything; they are all frustrated by a
derangement of his intellectual and moral constitution. In fact he has
no voluntary power of mind whatsoever, nor is he capable of acting under
any constraint of duty or moral obligation. 65</p>
<p>This is merciless and extreme, but Wordsworth had told Coleridge as
much in a letter a few weeks before. 66 The matter was made worse when,
accord- ing to Coleridge, Basil Montagu told him that Wordsworth had
advised him not to let Coleridge lodge with him, since Coleridge, by
heavy drink- ing and otherwise, had made himself “a nuisance” at
Grasmere. 67 Words - worth later (1812) assured Coleridge that Montagu
had misquoted him. Coleridge pretended to accept the explanation, but
the broken strings could not be repaired, and the historic friendship
died.</p>

<p>Institution in London — which suffered somewhat from confusion of
thought and expression, but impressed such auditors as Charles Lamb,
Lord Byron, Samuel Rogers, Thomas Moore, and Leigh Hunt; as if by some
spontaneous esprit de corps , these and other scribes came to the
support of their maimed compeer. Henry Crabb Robinson, who numbered a
dozen English or Ger- man notables among his friends, described the
third of the London lectures as “excellent and very German.” “In the
fourth,” he reported, “the m ode of treating the subject was very
German, and much too abstract for his audi- ence, which was thin.” 68
Coleridge’s accumulation of facts, ideas, and prejudices was too
abundant to let him cleave to his announced subject; he wandered wildly
but inspired. Charles Lamb, who summarized him in a famous phrase as an
“archangel, a little damaged,” 69 concluded that it was “enough to be
within the whiff and wind of ms genius for us not to possess our souls
in quiet.” 70</p>
<p>During the years 1815-17, when Coleridge was again nearing a break-
down, he poured his aging conclusions into print. In Theory of Life
(1815) he showed a surprising knowledge of science, especially of
chemistry, which he knew through friendship with Humphry Davy; but he
rejected all at- tempts to explain mind in physicochemical terms. He
called “absurd the notion of [Erasmus] Darwin,… of man’s having
progressed from an</p>
<p>orang- outang state.” 71</p>
<p>In The Statesman’s Manual (1816) he offered the Bible as “the best
guide to political thought and foresight.”</p>
<p>The historian finds that great events, even the most important
changes in the commercial relations of the world,… had their origin not
in the combinations of statesmen, or in the practical insights of men of
business, but in the closets of uninterested theorists, in the visions
of recluse geniuses…. All the epoch- forming revolutions of the
Christian world, the revolutions of religion, and with them the civil,
social, and domestic habits of the nations concerned, have coincided
with the rise and fall of metaphysical systems. 72</p>
<p>(He may have been thinking of the results of the thoughts of Christ,
Co- pernicus, Gutenberg, Newton, Voltaire, Rousseau.) After a fair
summary of the factors that led to the French Revolution, Coleridge
concluded that the voice of the people is not the voice of God; that the
people think in passionate absolutes, and cannot be trusted with power;
73 and that the best road to reform is through the conscience and action
of an educated and propertied minority. 74 Generally the best guide to
right action, in politics as elsewhere, is the Bible, for this contains
all the important truths of history and philosophy. “Of the laboring
classes more than this is not demanded,” and “not perhaps generally
desirable…. But you,… as men moving in the higher classes of society,”
should also know history, philosophy, ana theology. The antidote to
false statesmanship is history, as “the collation of the present with
the past, and the habit of thoughtfully assimilating the events of our
own age to those of the time before.” 75</p>
<p>A Lay Sermon (1817) continued this appeal to the “higher and middle
classes” as the best vehicles of sane reform, and as guards against the
“soph -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>441</p>
<p>ists and incendiaries of the revolutionary school.” 70 But the book
recog - nized some current evils: the reckless swelling of the national
debt, a peasantry sinking into pauperism, the labor of children in the
factories. Coleridge noted “the folly, presumption, and extravagance
that followed our late unprecedented prosperity; the blind practices and
blinding passions of speculation in the commercial world, with the shoal
of ostentatious fool- eries and sensual vices.” He mourned the liability
of the new business econ - omy to periodical exaltations and
depressions, leading to breakdowns and general suffering. 77</p>
<p>He recommended some basic reforms. “Our manufacturers must consent to
regulation,” 78 especially of child labor. The state should recognize as
its “positive ends: 1. To make the means of subsistence more easy to
each individual. 2. To secure to each of its members the hope of
bettering his own condition and that of his children. 3. The development
of those facul- ties which are essential to his humanity; i.e., to his
rational and moral be- ing.” 79 He called for an organization of the
leaders in every profession to study the social problem in the
perspective of philosophy, and to offer recommendations to the
community; and this “national church should be financed by the state.”
80</p>
<p>Coleridge ended his Lay Sermon by conceding to the theologians that
no purely lay or secular wisdom can solve the problems of mankind; only
a supernatural religion and a God-given moral code can check the
inherent cupidity of men. 81 Evil is so inborn in us that “human
intelligence… alone” is “inadequate to the office of restoring health to
the will.” 82 He called for a humble return to religion, and to full
faith in Christ as God dy- ing to redeem mankind. 83</p>
<p>In 1815- 16 Coleridge composed or dictated certain “Sketches of my
Literary Life and Opinions” for use in a projected autobiography. That
volume was never completed, and Coleridge published the sketches in 1817
as Biographia Literaria, which is now our most manageable source for
Coleridge’s thought in philosophy and literature. It is remarkably
coherent</p>
<p>He began by repudiating the associationist psychology that had once
fascinated him; he rejected the notion that all thought is the
mechanical product of sensations; these, he now held, give us merely the
raw materials which the self — the remembering, comparing, continuing
personality — re- molds into creative imagination, purposive thought,
and conscious action. All our experience, conscious or not, is recorded
in the memory, which becomes the storehouse from which the mind —
consciously or not — draws up material for the interpretation of present
experience and for the illumina- tion of present choices. Here, of
course, Coleridge was following Kant. His ten months in Germany had
transformed him not only from a poet into a philosopher but from a
determinist Spinozist into a free-will Kantian. Here he fully
acknowledge d his debt. “The writings of the illustrious sage of</p>
<p>442 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Konigsberg,… more than any other work, at once invigorated and dis-
ciplined my understanding.” 84</p>
<p>From Kant Coleridge proceeded to Fichte’s exaltation of the self as
the only reality directly known, through Hegel’s contrast and union of
nature and the self, to Schelling’s subordination of nature to mind as
two sides of one reality, in which, however, nature acts unconsciously,
while mind may act consciously and reaches its highest expression in the
conscious creations of the genius. Coleridge borrowed freely from
Schelling, and often ne- glected to mention his sources; 85 but he
confessed his general debts, and added: “To me it will be happiness and
honor enough, should I succeed in rendering the system itself [of
Schelling] intelligible to my countrymen.” 86</p>
<p>The last eleven chapters of the Biographia offered a philosophical
discus - sion of literature as a product of imagination. He
distinguished between fancy and imagination: fancy is fantasy, as in
imagining a mermaid; Im- agination (capitalized by Coleridge) is the
conscious unification of parts in a new whole, as in the plot of a
novel, the organization of a book, the production of a work of art, or
the molding of the sciences into a system of philosophy. This conception
became a tool for the understanding and criticism of any poem, book,
painting, symphony, statue, building: how far does the product have, or
lack, structure — the weaving of relevant parts into a consistent and
significant whole? In those pages Coleridge offered a philosophical
basis for the Romantic movement in literature and art.</p>
<p>He completed his complex Biographia with an acute criticism of Words-
worth’s philosophy and practice of poetry. Is it true that the highest
phi - losophy of life can be found in the ways and thoughts of the
simplest men? Is the language of such men the best medium of poetry? Is
there no basic difference between poetry and prose? On all these points
the poet become critic differed courteously but pointedly and
effectively. Then he con- cluded with a healing homage to the Grasmere
sage as the greatest poet since Milton. 87</p>

<p>After some minor wanderings, the Wordsworth menage moved (1808) from
Dove Cottage to a larger house at nearby Allan Bank. There the poet
blossomed out as a landscape gardener, surrounding the house with plants
and flowers that frolicked in the Grasmere rains. In 1813 the family
moved finally to a modest estate at Rydal Mount in Ambleside, a mile
south of Grasmere. They were now prosperous, with several servants and
some titled friends. In this year Lord Lonsd ale arranged Wordsworth’s
appoint - ment as distributor of stamps for Westmorland County; this
post, retained till 1842, brought the poet an additional two hundred
pounds per year. Freed from economic worry, he spent more time in his
garden, making it the paradise of rhododendra and other flowering plants
which it still is.</p>

<p>443</p>
<p>From his window on the second floor he had an inspiring view of Rydal
Water (i.e., Lake) two miles away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1805) he completed Th e Prelude , begun in 1798; “every
day,” Dorothy noted, he “brings us in a large treat” of it from his
morning walk. 88 She and Sara Hutchinson were kept busy taking
dictation; Words- worth had learned to think in blank verse. He
subtitled the leisurely epic “The Growth of a Poet’s Mind”; it was
intended as a mental autobiography, and as a prelude to The Excursion ,
which would expound in detail the philosophy reached in that growth. He
gave the record an added intimacy by repeatedly addressing his memories
to Coleridge. He apologized for the surface egotism of the poem; it was,
he confessed, “a thing unprecedented</p>
<p>It is quite tolerable if taken in small doses. Most pleasant are the
scenes of his childhood (Books 1 and 11), his solitary woodland rambles,
when it seemed to him that in the chatter of the animals, the rustling
of the trees, even in the resonance of rocks and hills, he heard the
voice of a hidden and multiform god. So, as he sat</p>

<p>Pleasant, too, was that stolen jaunt across the Channel (vi), to feel
the happy madness of France in revolution, the exaltation of the Alps,
and then, return ing, to see the “monstrous ant - hill” called London,
with old Burke intoning in Parliament the virtues of tradition, and
“with high disdain Ex - ploding upstart Theory”; to watch the crowds
frolicking at Vauxhall or worshiping at St. Paul’s; to see or hea r the
moving multitudes, the varied races, faces, garbs, and speech, the
clatter of traffic, the smiles of prostitutes, the vendors’ cries, the
flower women’s appeals, the street singer’s hopeful serenade, the artist
chalking pictures on the flagstones, “the antic pair of monkeys on a
camel’s back”— all this the poet felt as keenly as the woods, but he
liked them not, and fled (vm) to calmer scenes where love of all-
embracing nature could teach him to understand and forgive.</p>

<p>kind back from war and revolution to love of nature and mankind. He
was discontent with his poem, 90 knowing that there were spacious
deserts around the oases. He had confessedly seen little difference
between prose and poetry, and he too often mingled them in the steady,
dulling march of his blank verse. He had made “emotion remembered in
tranquillity” the es - sence of poetry, but an emotion tranquilized
through fourteen cantos be- comes an irresistible lullaby. Generally,
the character of an epic is a great or noble action told; and thought is
too private to be epical. Even so, The Prelude leaves the resolute
reader with a sense of healthy acceptance sur- viving reality.
Wordsworth, sometimes as childish as a nursery rhyme, cleanses us with
the freshness of woods and fields, and bids us, like the imperturbable
hills, bear the storm silently, and endure.</p>
<p>Before leaving for Germany in 1798 Wordsworth had begun The Re-
cluse, on the theory that only a man who had known life and had then
withdrawn from it could judge it fairly. Coleridge urged him to develop
this into a full and final statement of his philosophy. More
specifically Coleridge suggested: “I wish you would write a poem in
blank verse, addressed to those who, in consequence of the complete
failure of the French Revolution, have thrown up all hopes for the
amelioration of man- kind, and are sinking into an almost epicurean
selfishness.” 91 They agreed that the summit of literature would be a
happy marriage of philosophy and poetry.</p>
<p>On second thought Wordsworth felt that he was not ready to meet this
challenge. He had made considerable progress with The Prelude, which
proposed to be a history of his mental development; how could he, before
completing this, write an exposition of his views? He put The Recluse
aside, and pursued The Prelude to its apparent end. Then he found his
energy and confidence waning, and the passage of the once exuberant
Cole- ridge out of his life had removed the living inspiration that once
had spurred him on. In this condition of depleted vigor and prosperous
ease he wrote The Excursion.</p>
<p>It begins well, with a description — apparently taken from the
abandoned Recluse — of the ruined cottage where lives the “Wanderer.”
This replica of Wordsworth leads the excursionist to the Solitary, who
tells how he lost his religious faith, became sated with civilization,
and retired to the peace of the mountains. The Wanderer offers religion
as the only cure for despair; knowledge is good, but it increases our
power rather than our happiness. Then he leads on to the Pastor, who
submits that the simple faith and family unity of his peasant flock are
wiser than the attempt of the philosopher to replace the wisdom of the
ages with the webs of intellectual argument. The Wanderer deplores the
artificial life of the city, and the evils of the Indus - trial
Revolution; he advocates universal education, and prophesies its “glori
- ous effects.” The Pastor, however, having the l ast word, entones a
paean to a personal God.</p>
<p>The Excursion, being a Portion of the Recluse, a Poem, was published
in</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>446</p>
<p>1814 at two guineas a copy. (Its supposed preface, The Prelude, was
not printed till 1850.) Wordsworth asked his neighbors, the Clarksons,
to help its sale among their Quaker friends, “who are wealthy and fond
of instruc - tive books”; he gave a copy to the novelist Charles Lloyd
on the under - standing that it should not be lent to anyone who could
afford to buy it; and he refused to lend it to a rich widow, who
considered two guineas as rather high a price for “part of a work.” 92
Eight months after publication only three hundred copies had been
sold.</p>
<p>The reviews were mixed. Lord Jeffrey, in the November, 1814, issue of
the Edinburgh Review, condemned the poem with an ominous beginning:
“This will never do.” Hazlitt, after praising “delightful passages, both
of natural description and of inspired reflection,” found th e poem as a
whole “long and labored,” repeating “the same conclusions till they
become flat and insipid.” 93 And Coleridge, who had called for a
masterpiece, saw in The Excursion “prolixity, repetition, and an
eddying, instead of progres - sion, of thou ght.” 94 But in his later
Table Talk Coleridge praised Books 1 and 11 (“The Deserted Cottage”) as
“one of the most beautiful poems in the language.” 95 Shelley disliked
The Excursion as marking Wordsworth’s surrender of a naturalistic
pantheism to a more orthodox conception of God; but Keats found many
inspirations in the poem, and ranked Words- worth, all in all, above
Byron. 96 Time has agreed with Keats.</p>

<li>THE SAGE OF HIGHGATE: 1816-34</li>
</ol>
<p>In April, 1 8 1 6, Coleridge, nearing physical and mental collapse at
the age of forty-three, was received as a patient by Dr. James Gillman,
of High- gate, London. Coleridge was then consuming a pint of laudanum
per day. Southey, about this time, descr ibed him as “half as big as the
house”; his frame loose and bent; his face pale, round, and flabby; his
breath short; his hands so shaky that he could hardly bring a glass to
his lips. 97 He had some loyal friends, like Lamb, De Quincey, and Crabb
Robinson, but he rarely saw his wife or children, lived mostly on
pensions or gifts, and was losing his last hold on life. Perhaps the
young physician had heard that Byron and Walter Scott had ranked this
broken man as England’s greatest man of letters; 98 in any case he saw
that Coleridge could be saved only by constant and professional
surveillance and care. With the consent of his wife, Dr. Gillman took
Coleridge into his home, fed him, treated him, comforted and cured him,
and kept him till death.</p>
<p>T he recovery of Coleridge’s mind was astonishing. The doctor so mar
- veled at the extent of his patient’s knowledge, the wealth of his
ideas, and the brilliance of his conversation that he opened his doors
to a growing circle of old and young men to whom the “damaged archangel”
talked at random, seldom with full clarity or logical order, but with
unfailing wit, zest, and effect. Fragments of these conversations,
preserved as Table Talk, still strike a spark: “Every man is born an
Aristotelian or a Platonist.”</p>

<p>He was not content to be among the first and wisest of beasts. As he
neared death he sought comfort in religion, and, as if to make sure of
his bargain, embraced it in its most orthodox available form, the Church
of England, as the pillar of English stability and morality; and
hopefully he wished it everlasting life: Esto perpetual His essay On the
Constitution of the Church and the State (1830) presented them as two
mutually necessary forms of national unity, each protecting and helping
the other. 100 He (and Wordsworth) opposed the political emancipation of
British Catholics, on the ground that the growth of “popery” would
endanger the state by de - veloping a conflict of loyalties between
patriotism and religion.</p>
<p>He took full advantage of the conservatism natural to old age. In
1818 he had supported Robert Owen and Sir Robert Peel in their campaigns
for restrictions on child labor, but in 1831 he opposed the Reform Bill
that was to break the hold of the Tories upon Parliament. He advised
against the abolition of West Indian slavery. 101 He who, more than most
philosophers, had studied and supported science, rejected the idea of
evolution, preferring “the history I find in my Bible.” 102 In the end
his capacious and far -reaching intellect yielded to ailments of body
and will, and he fell into a timid fear of every innovation in politics
or belief.</p>
<p>He lacked the steady patience to achieve constructive unity in his
work. In the Biographia Liter aria (1817), he had announced his
intention to write an opus magnum — the Logosophia — that would be the
sum, summit, and reconciliation of science, philosophy, and religion;
but all that flesh and soul would let him contribute to that enterprise
was a medley of fragments la- bored, chaotic, and obscure. To such a
pass had come the mind that De Quincey had described as “the most
capacious,… subtlest, and most comprehensive… that has yet existed among
men.” 103</p>
<p>In July, 1834, Coleridge began his adieus to life. “I am dying, b ut
without expectation of a speedy release…. Hooker wished to live to
finish his Ecclesiastical Polity, — so I own I wish life and strength
had been spared me to complete my Philosophy. For, as God hears me, the
originating, con- tinuing, and sustaining wish and design in my heart
were to exalt the glory of his name; and, which is the same thing in
other words, to promote the improvement of mankind. But visum aliter Deo
[God saw otherwise], and his will be done.” 104 Coleridge died on July
25, 18 34, aged sixty-two. Wordsworth was shaken by the passing of “the
most wonderful man he had ever known”; and Lamb, best friend of all,
said, “His great and dear spirit haunts me.” 105</p>
<ol start="14" type="I">
<li>ON THE FRINGE</li>
</ol>
<p>Charles Lamb (1775-1834) was one of several keen spirits whose
princi- pal publications place them after 1815, but who in our period
entered</p>
<p>448 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>intimately into the lives of the Lake Poets. Lamb was the closest of
Cole- ridge’s London friends. They had known each other as schoolboys at
Christ’s Hospital. There Lamb’s incurable stammering kept him from
scholastic honors. He left school at fourteen to support himself; at
seventeen he became an accountant in the East India House; and he
remained there until he was retired on a pension at the age of
fifty.</p>
<p>There was a strain of insanity in his heritage; he himself spent six
weeks in an asylum (1795-96); and in 1796 his sister Mary Ann
(1764-1847), in an insane mania, killed their mother. For several
periods Mary had been confined, but for the most part Lamb, renouncing
marriage, had her live with him till his death. She recovered
sufficiently to collaborate with him in writing Tales from Shakespeare
(1807). His own unique product was the Essays of Elia (1820-25), whose
genial style, modesty, and art revealed one of the most lovable
characters in that not too gracious age.</p>
<p>In June, 1797, still shaken by the tragedy of the previous year, he
ac- cepted an invitation from Coleridge to visit him at Nether Stowey.
As a stammerer he hardly dared talk when he found himself before two
poets — Wordsworth and Coleridge — in rival volubility. Five years later
he and his sister visited the Coleridge family in Greta Hall. “He
received us with all the hospitality in the world.” 100 Though he
himself remained a skeptic to the end, Lamb never allowed Coleridge’s
theological diversions to interfere</p>
<p>The National Portrait Gallery contains a tender portrait of Lamb by
his friend William Hazlitt (1778-1830), the liveliest and sharpest
literary critic of the time. Hazlitt visited Coleridge in 1798, and
again, at Greta Hall, in</p>
<ol start="1803" type="1">
<li>On the second occasion Wordsworth joined them, and the three set
about determining whether God existed. William Paley, as we have seen,
had recently defended the affirmative with the argument from design;
Haz- litt countered it; Wordsworth took a middle ground, affirming God
not as external to the universe and guiding it from without, but as
inherent in it as its life and mind. On that visit Hazlitt incurred the
wrath of the neighbors by seducing a schoolgirl. Fearing arrest or
worse, he fled to Grasmere, where Wordsworth gave him a night’s lodging
and, the next morning, ad - vanced him funds to pay coach fare to
London.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Coleridge and Wordsworth turned against the Revolution, and
denounced Napoleon in fervent verse, Hazlitt set them down as turncoats,
and wrote a four-volume Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (1828-30) from
Napoleon’s point of view. Meanwhile he had made his mark as a critic
with his lectures (1820) on the Elizabethan drama, and his contemporary
por- traits in The Spirit of the Age (1825); Wordsworth did not enjoy
its sa- tirical attack on the “peasant school” in literature. 107</p>
<p>The aging poet liked better Thomas De Quincey (1785-1859), who</p>
<p>offered mm a continuo of admiration. Thomas was a genius in his own
right, who was to alarm Britain in 1821 with Confessions of an

<p>Opium Eater. Beginning as a prodigy, speaking classic Greek readily
at fifteen, running away from school and Oxford as too slow for his
pace, he must have surprised himself by his delight with the
unpretentious simplicity of the Lyrical Ballads. In May, 1803, he wrote
to Wordsworth such a letter as might have turned the sol itary poet’s
head:</p>
<p>I have no other motive in soliciting your friendship than what (I
should think) every man who has read and felt the “Lyrical Ballads” must
have in common with me. The whole aggregate of pleasure I have received
from eight or nine other poets that I have been able to find since the
world began falls infinitely short of what these two enchanting volumes
have singly afforded me; — that your name is with me forever linked to
the lovely scenes of nature.</p>
<p>He added that Wordsworth would never find anyone “more ready… to
sacrifice even his life whenever it would have a chance of promoting
your interest and happiness.”</p>
<p>Wordsworth’s reply was a model of kindly instruction. “My
friendship,” he wrote, “is not in my power to give; this is a gift which
no man can make…. A sound and healthy friendship is the growth of time
and</p>
<p>circumstance; it will spring up like a wildnower when these favour,
and when they do not it is in vain to look for it.” He tried to deter
the youth from seeking a regular correspondence: “I am the most lazy and
impotent letter writer in the world.” But he added: “I shal l indeed be
very happy to see you at Grasmere.” 108</p>
<p>Despite his ardor, De Quincey let three years pass before accepting
the invitation. Then, reaching sight of Wordsworth’s cottage, he lost
courage, and, like the fabled pilgrim nearing Rome, turned back as
unworthy. But late in 1 807, at Bristol, Coleridge accepted his offer to
escort Mrs. Coleridge and her children to Keswick. On the way she
stopped with him at Dove Cottage, and now, at last, De Quincey saw
Wordsworth “plain,” as Brown - ing was so on to see Shelley. “Like a
flash of lightning I saw the figure emerge of a tallish man, who held
out his hand and saluted me with most cor- dial expressions of welcome.”

<li>southey: 1803-43</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, at Greta Hall and London, Southey, with his industrious
but uninspired pen, supported his wife Edith, his five daughters (born
between 1804 and 1812), and a fondly idolized son who died in 1816 at
the age of ten. After Coleridge’s passage to Malta Southey took over
responsibility for Mrs. Coleridge and her children. Even Wordsworth
sometimes leaned on him: when William’s brother John was lost at sea
(1805) the news threw</p>
<p>450 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>“that I loved him at once; he wept with us in our sorrow, and for
that</p>
<p>Vanity misled him for a while; he composed epic after epic, each
a</p>
<p>failure; the times were their own epic. He resigned himself to prose,
and fared better. In 1807 he published Letters from England: By Don
Manuel Alvarez Espriella, and put into the mouth of this imaginary
Spaniard a strong denunciation of child labor and other conditions in
British factories. E -g.,</p>
<p>I ventured to inquire concerning the morals of the people who were
trained up in this monstrous manner, and found… that in consequence of
herding together such numbers of both sexes, utterly uninstructed in the
commonest principles of religion and morality, they were as debauched
and profligate as human beings under the influence of such circumstances
must inevitably be; the men drunken, the women dissolute; that however
high the wages they earned, they were too improvident ever to lay by for
a time of need; and that, though the parish was not at the expense of
maintaining them as children, it had to provide for them in diseases
induced by their mode of life, or in pre- mature disability or old age.
111</p>
<p>The aristocrat’s conclusion on the English economy; “In commerce,
even more than in war, both men and beasts are considered mainly as
machines, and sacrificed with even less compunction.” 112</p>
<p>Southey soon found that he could not live by his pen, much less
support his dependents, especially in time of war, unless he adopted a
more con- servative line. The change was smoothed by a governmental
pension of one hundred sixty pounds a year (1807), and an invitation to
contribute articles regularly to the Tory Quarterly Review. In 1813 he
raised his status both as an author and as a patriot by issuing his Life
of Nelson — a clear and vivid narrative based on laborious research, and
written in an eighteenth-century style so simple, clear, and smooth that
it carries the reader along despite obtrusions of the writer’s natural
bias in favor of his hero and his country. Nelson’s infatuation with
Emma Hamilton is reduced from a decade to a paragraph.</p>
<p>Byron, Shelley, and Hazlitt mourned when Southey seemed to lower the
prestige of poetry by accepting the laureateship of England. This dis-
tinction had fallen in prestige when Pitt (1790) gave it to Henry Pye,
an obscure justice of the peace. At Pye’s death (1813) the government of
- fered the post to Walter Scott, who refused it and recommended Southey
as a deserving laborer. Southey accepted it, and was rewarded by an
increase of his pension to three hundred pounds a year. Wordsworth, who
should have had the appointment, remarked handsomely: “Southey has a
little world dependent on his industry.” 113</p>
<p>Byron, who was later to condemn Southey to obloquy and oblivion,
spoke well of him after a meeting with him at Holland House in
September, 1813: “The best - looking bard I have seen in some time.” 114
And to Thomas Moore: “To have that poet’s head and shoulders I would
almost have writ - ten his sapphics. He is certainly a prepossessing
person to look at, a man</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE LAKE POETS</p>
<p>451</p>
<p>of talent…. His manners are mild…. His prose is perfect.” 118 But
Southey’s evident anxiety to please the holders of wealth or power
brought Byron into open war against him in 1818. The unkindest cut of
all came when a group of rebels secured the manuscript of Southey’s
radical drama Wat Tyler (which he had written in 1794 and left
unprinted), and pub- lished it with joy in 1817.</p>
<p>Southey retired to Greta Hall, his library, and his wife. She had
more than once neared insanity; in 1834 her mind gave way, and in 1837
she died. Southey himself gave up the battle in 1843; and then, by
almost uni- versal consent, and over his own protests, Wordsworth was
made poet laureate.</p>
<ol start="16" type="I">
<li>WORDSWORTH EPILOGUE: 1815-50</li>
</ol>
<p>Poetry belongs to youth, and Wordsworth, living eighty years, died as
a poet about 1807, when, aged thirty -seven, he composed The White Doe
of Rylstone. By that time Walter Scott had published The Lay of the Last
Minstrel (1805); Wordsworth envied its flowing style, and used the meter
for his own “lay”— a narrative ballad about the religious wars of north
England in the twelfth year of Elizabeth I. Almost an entire family —
father and eight sons — was wiped out in one campaign. Emily, the
surviving sister, spends the rest of her life in mourning; a white doe
comes daily to comfort her, and it accompanies her in her Sabbath visits
to the tomb of the youngest brother in Bolton churchyard. When Emily
dies the doe continues, alone, those weekly trips from Rylstone to
Bolton, and lies quietly beside the grave till the Sabbath service in
the church is over, then quietly returns, through woods and streams, to
its Rylstone haunts. It is a pretty legend, gracefully and melodiously
told.</p>
<p>This was the last triumph of Wordsworth’s art. Aside from some
sonnets, which he emitted at the slightest provocation, he did no more
for poetry. Physically fifty, he looked every inch a sage, tall and
stately, wrapped in warm garments against the incalculable cold, hair
receding and carelessly tangled, head bent, eyes grave in contemplation,
as of one who, having seen Shelley and Byron pass from infancy through
ecstasy to death, now calmly awaited his turn, confident that he would
leave a monument more lasting than passionate utopias or sardonic
rhymes.</p>
<p>He had the defects of his virtues, for it takes much egotism to
preach to mankind. “Milton is his greatest idol,” wrote Hazlitt, “and he
sometimes dared to compare himself with him.” 116 He accepted praise as
unavoidable, and resented criticism as ingratitude. He loved to recite
his own poetry, as was slyly noted by Emerson, who visited him in 1833;
but he had said, in a preface of 1815, that his poems were meant to be
read aloud; and in fact they were music as well as meaning, and a lyric
deserves a lyre.</p>
<p>Of course he became conservative as he aged; it was a privilege —
perhaps</p>
<p>45 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>a duty — of years; and if Byron and Shelley did not recognize this it
may have been because they died in the dementia praecox of youth. The
de- terioration of the French Revolution from constitution to
dissolution gave Wordsworth some excuse for caution; and the brutality
of the Industrial Revolution seemed to justify his feeling that
something wholesome and beautiful had passed from England with the
replacement of the sturdy yeomanry by the factory “hand.” In 1 805 and
later, by gift or purchase, he had become the owner of several modest
properties; and as a landholder he readily sympathized with the “landed
interest” as the cement of eco - nomic order and social stability. Hence
he opposed the reform movement as a plan of the manufacturers to reduce
the cost of corn, and therefore of labor, by repealing those “Corn Laws”
that impeded, with high tariff dues, the import of foreign grain.</p>
<p>He, who had been through many years an admirer of Godwin, now re-
jected Godwin’s free individualism on the ground that individuals can
sur - vive only through a communal unity maintained by general respect
for tradition, property, and law. After 1815 he supported the government
in all its repressive measures, and was branded as an apostate from the
cause of liberty. He held his ground, and countered with his final
diagnosis of the age: “The world is running mad with its notion that its
evils are to be relieved by political changes, political remedies,
political nostrums, whereas the great evils — civilization, bondage,
misery — lie deep in the heart, and nothing but virtue and religion can
remove them.” 117</p>
<p>So he appealed to the English people to support the Church of
England. He versified some English history in forty- seven
“Ecclesiastical Sonnets” (1821), which bore us with their forgotten
heroes and sometimes surprise us by their excellence. According to Henry
Crabb Robinson, “Words - worth said he would shed his blood, if
necessary, to defend the Established Church. Nor was he disconcerted by
a laugh raised against him on account of his having before confessed
that he knew not when he had been in a church in his own country.”
118</p>
<p>We do not find that he sought comfort in religion when the world of
love around him began to crumble. In 1829 Dorothy suffered a severe
attack of stone, which permanently weakened her health and spirit.
Further attacks damaged her nervous system; after 1835 she lost the use
of her legs, and her memory failed except for events in the distant
past, and for her brother’s poems, which she could still recite. For the
next twenty years she remained in the household as helpless and quietly
insane, sitting silent in her chair near the fire, and waiting patiently
for death. In 1835 Sara Hutchinson died, and Wordsworth was left with
his wife Mary to care for his sister and his children. In 1837 he had
still sufficient fortitude to undertake, with the omnipre sent Robinson,
a six months’ tour of France and Italy. In Paris he met again Annette
Vallon and his daughter Caroline, now securely wed.</p>
<p>He died on April 23, 1850, and was buried among his neighbors in
Gras- mere churchyard. Dorothy lingered five years more, patiently
