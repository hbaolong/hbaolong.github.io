<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XPortugal Inaugurates the</p>
<p>Commercial Revolution</p>
<p>1300-1517</p>
<p>T HROUGH no natural advantages except a seacoast, but by sheet cour-
age and tenacious enterprise, little Portugal in this period made
herself one of the strongest and richest of European states. Founded as
a kingdom in 1139, her government, language, and culture reached an
established form under her best- beloved ruler, Diniz “the Laborer”—
administrator, reformer, builder, educator, patron of the arts, and
skilled practitioner of literature and love. His son Affonso IV, after
some precautionary murders, matured into a beneficent reign, in which a
growing trade with England bound the two countries into a political
amity that has endured till our time. To con- firm a prudent alliance
with rising Castile, Affonso urged his son Pedro to marry Donna Costanza
Manuel. Pedro married her, but continued to love the lovely Ines de
Castro, herself of royal lineage. After Costanza’s death Ines was an
obstacle to a second diplomatic marriage for Pedro; Affonso, after due
reluctance, had her killed (1355). Camoens, the Portuguese Mil- ton,
recounted this famous romance in his national epic, The Lusiads:</p>
<p>So against Inez came that murderous crew . . .</p>
<p>The brutes their swords in her white breasts imbrue , . .</p>
<p>And in mad wrath themselves incarnadine,</p>
<p>Nor any vengeance yet to come divine. 1</p>
<p>Pedro supplied the vengeance when, two years later, he inherited the
throne. He murdered the murderers, exhumed the corpse of his beloved,
crowned her queen, then reburied her in regal style. He ruled with a
severity nurtured by this tragedy.</p>
<p>A less exalted romance disordered the reign of his successor.
Fernando I lost his head and heart to Leonora, wife of the lord of
Pombeiro, repudiated his engagement to a Castilian princess, and married
Leonora despite her liv- ing husband and a scandalized Church. After
Fernando’s death (1383), Leonora assumed the regency, made her daughter
Beatriz queen, and be- trothed her to John I of Castile. The people
revolted against the prospect of becoming a Castilian appanage; a Cortes
at Coimbra declared the Portuguese</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xthrone elective, and chose as king Don Joao — John — son of Pedro
and In6s. Castile undertook to establish Beatriz by force; John
improvised an army, borrowed 500 archers from England, and defeated the
Castilians at Alju- barrota on August 14, 1385 — which is annually
celebrated as Portugal’s In - dependence Day.</p>
<p>“John the Great” now opened a reign of forty -eight years, and a
dynasty — the house of Aviz — that held the throne for two centuries.
Administration was reorganized, law and the judiciary were reformed, the
Portuguese lan- guage was made official, and its literature began.
Scholars here, as in Spain, continued till the eighteenth century to use
Latin, but Vasco da Lobeira wrote in the native tongue a chivalric
romance, Amadis da Gaula (c. 1400), which became in translation the most
popular secular book in Europe. Na- tional art expressed itself proudly
in the church of Santa Maria da Victoria, built at Batalha by John I to
commemorate “the Battle” of Aljubarrota; here Milan’s cathedral is
rivaled in size, and Notre Dame of Paris in the intricate splendor of
buttresses and pinnacles. In 1436 a chapel of elegant design and
decoration was added to receive the remains of the “bastard king.”</p>
<p>He was honored in his sons. Duarte — Edward — succeeded him and gov-
erned almost as well; Pedro codified the law; Henrique — “Henry the Navi
- gator”— inaugurated the commercial revolution that was to transform
the map of the globe. When John I captured Ceuta from the Moors ( 1415),
he left the twenty-one-year-old Henry as governor of that strategic
strong- hold, just across the Strait from Gibraltar. Excited by Moslem
accounts of Timbuktu and Senegal and the gold, ivory, and slaves to be
had along the West African coast, the ambitious youth determined to
explore that terrain and add it to Portugal. The Senegal River that his
informants spoke of might lead eastward to the headwaters of the Nile
and to Christian Abyssinia; a water route would be opened across Africa
from the Atlantic to the Red Sea — therefore to India; the Italian
monopoly of trade with the East would be broken; Portugal would be a
major power. The conquered region might be converted to Christianity,
and African Islam would be flanked on north and south by Christian
states, and the Mediterranean become safe for Christian navigation.
Henry does not appear to have thought of a route around Africa, 2 but
that was the historic result of his work.</p>
<p>About 1420 he set up at Sagres, on the southwestern tip of Portugal
and Europe, an informal clearing house of nautical knowledge and
enterprise. For forty years he and his aides, including Jewish and
Moslem astronomers and map makers, gathered and studied there the
accounts of sailors and travelers, and sent out into perilous seas frail
vessels powered with sails and oars and thirty to sixty men. One of
Henry’s captains had already (1418) rediscovered Madeira, which had been
seen by Genoese mariners seventy</p>
<p>CHAP, x) THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION 193</p>
<p>years before and then forgotten; now Portuguese colonists developed
its resources; soon its sugar and other products repaid the cost of
colonization, and encouraged the Portuguese government to meet Henry’s
appeals for funds. Noting the Azores marked on an Italian map of 1351,
he commis- sioned Gonzalo Cabral to find them; it was done, and in
1432-44, one after another, these jewels of the sea were added to the
Portuguese crown.</p>
<p>But it was Africa that lured Henry most insistently. Catalan and
Portu- guese navigators had sailed some 900 miles down the west coast as
far as Bojador (1341-46). There, however, the enormous westward bulge of
the great continent into the Atlantic disheartened mariners seeking the
south; they crept back to Europe with self-excusing tales of horrible
natives, a sea so thick with salt that no prow would cleave it, and
assurances that any Chris- tian who passed Bojador would be transformed
into a Negro. With similar apologies Captain Gilianes returned to Sagres
in 1433. Henry ordered him forth again, and bade him bring back a clear
account of the lands and seas south of the forbidding cape. So prodded,
Gilianes reached to 150 miles be- yond Bojador (1435), and was
astonished to find lush vegetation in equato- rial regions where,
according to Aristotle and Ptolemy, only deserts could exist under the
burning sun. Six years later Nuno Tristao sailed down to Capo Blanco,
and brought home some sturdy Negroes, who were at once baptised and
enslaved; feudal barons put them to work on Portuguese plan- tations,
and the first major result of Henry’s labors was the inauguration of the
African slave trade. Fresh financial support now came to the Prince. His
ships went out nominally to explore and convert, really to get gold,
ivory, and slaves. Captain Lanzarote in 1444 brought back 1 65
“blackamoors,” who were set to tilling the lands of the
monastic-military Order of Jesus Christ. A Portuguese contemporary
described the capture of these “black Moors”:</p>
<p>Our men, crying out, “Sant’ Iago! San Jorge! Portugal!” fell upon</p>
<p>them, killing or capturing all they could. There you might have
seen</p>
<p>mothers catch up their children, husbands their wives, each one
escap- ing as best he could. Some plunged into the sea; others thought
to hide themselves in the comers of their hovels; others hid their
children un- der the shrubs . . . where our men found them. And at last
our Lord</p>
<p>God, Who gives to all a due reward, gave to our men that day a
vic-</p>
<p>tory over their enemies; and in recompense for all their toil in
His</p>
<p>service they took 165 men, women, and children, not counting the</p>
<p>slain.®</p>
<p>By 1448 over 900 African slaves had been brought to Portugal. We
should add that, the Moslems of North Africa had anticipated the
Christians in de- veloping a slave trade, and African Negro chieftains
themselves bought</p>
<p>194 THE reformation (chap.x</p>
<p>Negro slaves from the Portuguese with ivory and gold. 4 Man was a
com- modity to human beasts of prey.</p>
<p>In 1445 Diniz Dias reached the fertile promontory named Cape Verde;
in 1446 Lanzarote explored the mouth of the Senegal; in 1456 Ca Da Mosto
found the Cape Verde Islands. In that year Prince Henry died, but the
enter- prise continued with the impetus that he had given it and the
economic gains that now financed it. Joao da Santarem crossed the
equator (1471), Diogo Cao re ached the Congo River ( 1484) ; finally,
half a century after Henry’s first expedition, Bartholomeu Dias,
fighting his way through tempest and shipwreck, rounded the southernmost
point of Africa (i486). He rejoiced to find that he could now sail
eastward; India lay straight ahead, and seemed almost in his grasp; but
his weary men forced him to turn back. Mourning the rough seas that had
broken the spirit of his men, he named the southern tip of the continent
Cabo Tormentoso; but King John II, seeing India around the bend, renamed
the point the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>Neither Dias nor the King lived to see fulfilled the dream that now
stirred all Portugal — an all-water route to India. In 1497 King Manuel,
jealous of the honors and wealth that Columbus was bringing to Spain,
commissioned Vasco da Gama to sail around Africa to India. Forced by
storms to take a circuitous route, the twenty-eight-year-old captain
voyaged some 5,000 miles through 137 days to the Cape of Good Hope,
then, through a hundred perils and tribulations, 178 days and 4,500
miles more to Calicut, a main nexus of east-west and north-south trade
in Asia; there he anchored on May 20, 1498, ten months and twelve days
after leaving Lisbon. Landing, he was at once arrested as a pirate, and
narrowly escaped execution. With remark- able courage and address he
overcame Indian suspicions and Moslem jeal- ousies, won permission for
the Portuguese to trade, took on a rich cargo of pepper, ginger,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and jewelry, and left Calicut August 29 for an
arduous year-long return to Lisbon. The Portuguese had finally found a
route to India free from the costly transshipments and tolls suffered by
the sea-and-land routes from Italy through Egypt or Arabia or Persia.
The economic results were to be, for a century, more vital to Eu- rope
than those that flowed from the discovery of America.</p>
<p>Proud of having reached the real India while the Spanish navigators
were floundering in the supposed Indies of the Caribbean, the Portuguese
till 1 500 hardly thought of trying a passage west. But in that year
Pedro Cabral, driven from the course that he had set for India via
Africa, stumbled upon Brazil; and again in that year Gaspar Corte-Real
rediscovered Labrador. In 1503 Amerigo Vespucci, sailing under the
Portuguese flag, explored the Rio Plata and Paraguay; and in 1 506
Tristao da Cunha found the South At- lantic island that bears his name.
Portuguese statesmen, however, saw little</p>
<p>CHAP, x) THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION 195</p>
<p>profit in Br azil, whereas every cargo from India fattened the royal
treasury and the purses of merchants and mariners.</p>
<p>The Portuguese government kept full control of the new trade, since
the commerce required unremitting military protection. Moslem merchants
had long since been established in Indian posts; some Indian potentates
joined them in resisting the Portuguese invasion; trade and war, money
and blood, now mingled in the far-flung commercial revolution. In 1 509
Alfonso de Albuquerque became the first governor of Portuguese India.
Waging cam- paign after campaign against Moslems and Hindus, he captured
and forti- fied Aden and Hormuz on the Arabian coast, Goa in India, and
Malacca in the Malay Peninsula; and from Malacca he brought home a
million ducats’ worth of booty. So armed, Portugal became for 1 50 years
the master of Em ropean trade with India and the East Indies. Portuguese
merchants estab- lished themselves as far east as the Moluccas (1512),
and rejoiced to find the nutmegs, mace, and cloves of these “Spice
Islands” tastier and cheaper than India’s. Still insatiate, Albuquerque
sailed with twenty vessels into the Red Sea, and proposed to the
Christian king of Abyssinia that they join forces in digging a canal
from the Upper Nile to the Red Sea, so diverting the river and turning
all Moslem Egypt into a desert. Trouble summoned Albuquer- que back to
Goa, where he died in 1515. In the following year Duarte Coelho opened
Cochin China and Siam to Portuguese trade; and in 1517 Fernao Peres de
Andrade established commercial relations with Canton and Peking.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Empire — the first modern imperialism — was now the
most extensive in the world, rivaled only by the empire that was being
built for Spain in the Americas. Lisbon became a thriving emporium,
whose waters harbored ships from romantically distant lands. There,
rather than in Venice or Genoa, the merchants of northern Europe now
found the lowest prices for Asiatic goods. Italy mourned her lost
monopoly of the Oriental trade. Slowly the Italian Renaissance, mortally
stricken by Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Luther in one generation, faded
away, while Portugal and Spain, commanders of the open sea, led the
flowering of the Atlantic states.</p>
<p>Literature and art basked in the new glory. Fernao Lopes, writing for
twenty years ( 1434-54) his voluminous Cronacas, told the story of
Portugal with a vivacity of narrative and a power of characterization
rivaling Frois- sart. Gil Vicente inaugurated the Portuguese drama with
little plays for the court and autos — acts — for public festivals
(c. 1500). A Portuguese school of painting developed, taking a lead from
Flanders but achieving its own temper and qualities. Nuno Gonsalves (ft.
1450-72) rivaled Mantegna, and almost the V an Eycks, in the somber
polyptych that he painted for the con- vent of St. Vincent: the six
panels primitive in perspective and modeling, but</p>

<p>Xthe fifty-five portraits — the best of them Henry the Navigator —
individual- ized with realistic power. To commemorate the victorious
voyage of Vasco da Gama, King Manuel “the Fortunate” commissioned the
architect Joao de Castilho to build near Lisbon, in Flamboyant Gothic,
the magnificent mon- astery of Belem ( c . 1500). Portugal had entered
her golden age.</p>
