<h4 id="chapter-ii-england-wyclif-chaucer-and">CHAPTER II England:
Wyclif, Chaucer, and</h4>
<p>he Great Revolt</p>
<p>1308-1400</p>
<p>I. THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>O N February 25,1 308, Edward II, sixth king of the house of
Plantagenet, in a solemn coronation before the hierarchy and nobility
assembled in Westminster Abbey, took the oath that England proudly
requires of all her sovereigns:</p>
<p>Archbishop of Canterbury : Sire, will you grant and keep, and by</p>
<p>your oath confirm, to the people of England, the laws and customs</p>
<p>o them granted by the ancient kings of England, your righteous and
godly predecessors, and especially the laws, customs, and privileges
granted to the clergy and people by the glorious King St. Edward</p>
<p>your predecessor?</p>
<p>King : I grant them and promise.</p>
<p>Archbishop: Sire, will you keep toward God and Holy Church,</p>
<p>and to clergy and people, peace and accord in God, entirely,
after</p>
<p>your power?</p>
<p>King: I will keep them.</p>
<p>Archbishop: Sire, will you cause to be done, in all your
judgments,</p>
<p>equal and right justice and discretion, in mercy and truth, to
your</p>
<p>power?</p>
<p>King: I will do so.</p>
<p>Archbishop: Sire, do you grant to hold and to keep the laws and</p>
<p>righteous customs which the community of your realm shall have</p>
<p>chosen, and will you defend and strengthen them to the honor of</p>
<p>God, to the utmost of your power?</p>
<p>King: I grant and promise. 1</p>
<p>Having so sworn, and being duly anointed and consecrated with holy
oils, Edward II consigned the government to corrupt and incompetent
hands, and devoted himself to a life of frivolity with Piers Gaveston,
his Ganymede. The barons rebelled, caught and slew Gaveston (1312), and
subordinated Ed- ward and England to their feudal oligarchy. Returning
in disgrace from his</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>CHAP.n) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 27</p>
<p>defeat by the Scots at Bannockburn (1314), Edward solaced himself
with a new love, Hugh le Despenser III. A conspiracy of his neglected
wife, Isabella of France, and her paramour, Roger de Mortimer, deposed
him (1326); he was murdered in Berkeley Castle by Mortimer’s agent
(1327); and his fifteen-year-old son was crowned as Edward III.</p>
<p>The noblest event of this age in English history was the
establishment (1322) of a precedent that required the consent of a
national assembly for the validity of any law. It had long been the
custom of English monarchs, in their need, to summon a “King’s Council”
of prominent nobles and prelates. In 1295 Edward I, warring at once with
France, Scotland, and Wales, and most earnestly desirous of cash and
men, instructed “every city, borough, and leading town” to send two
burgesses (enfranchised citi zens), and every shire or county to send
two knights (minor nobles) , to a national assembly that would form,
with the King’s Council, the first English Parliament. The towns had
money, which their delegates might be persuaded to vote to the king; the
shires had yeomen (freeholders), who would make sturdy archers and
pikemen; the time had come to build these forces into the structure of
British government. There was no pretense at full democracy. Though the
towns were — or by 1400 would be — free from feudal overlordship, the
urban vote was confined to a small minority of propertied men. The
nobles and clergy remained the rulers of England: they owned most of the
land, em- ployed most of the population as their tenants or serfs, and
organized and directed the armed forces of the nation.</p>
<p>The Parliament (as it came to be called under Edward III) met in the
royal palace at Westminster, across from the historic Abbey. The arch-
bishops of Canterbury and York, the eighteen bishops, and the major
abbots sat at the right of the king; half a hundred dukes, marquises,
earls, viscounts, and barons sat on his left; the Prince of Wales and
the King’s Council gath - ered near the throne; and the judges of the
realm, seated on woolsacks to remind them how vital the wool trade was
to England, attended to advise on points of law. At the opening of the
session the burgesses and knights — later known as the Commons — stood
uncovered below a bar that separated them from the prelates and lords;
now for the first time (1295) the national assembly had an Upper and a
Lower House. The united houses received from the king or his chancellor
a pronunciatio (the later “speech from the throne”) explaining the
subjects to be discussed and the appropriations de - sired. Then the
Commons withdrew to meet in another hall — usually the chapter house of
Westminster Abbey. There they debated the royal pro- posals. These
deliberations ended, they delegated a “speaker” to report the result to
the Upper House, and to present their petitions to the king. At the
close of the sessions the two houses came together again to receive
the</p>
<p>28 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. II</p>
<p>reply of the sovereign, and to be dismissed by him. Only the king had
the authority to summon or dissolve the Parliament,</p>
<p>Both houses claimed, and normally enjoyed, freedom of debate. In many
cases they spoke or wrote their minds vigorously to the ruler; on
several oc- casions, however, he had a too audacious critic jailed. In
theory the powers of Parliament extended to legislation; in practice
most of the statutes passed had been presented as bills by the royal
ministers; but the houses often sub- mitted recommendations and
grievances, and delayed the voting of funds till some satisfaction was
obtained. The only weapon of the Commons was this “power of the purse”;
but as the cost of administration and the wealth of the towns grew, the
power of the Commons rose. The monarchy was neither absolute nor
constitutional. The king could not openly and directly change a law made
by Parliament or enact a new one; but through most of the year he ruled
without a Parliament to check him, and issued executive decrees that
affected every department of English life. He succeeded to the throne
not by election but by pedigree. His person was accounted religiously
sacred; obedience and loyalty to him were inculcated with all the force
of religion, custom, law, education, and ceremonious oath. If this might
not suffice, the law of treason directed that a captured rebel against
the state should be dragged through the streets to the gallows, should
have his entrails tom out and burned before his face, and should then be
hanged. 2</p>
<p>In 1330 Edward III, eighteen, took over the government, and began one
of the most eventful reigns in the history of England. “His body was</p>
<p>comely,” says a contemporary chronicler, “and his face was like that
of a god”; 8 till venery weakened him he was every inch a king. He
almost ig- nored domestic politics, being a warrior rather than a
statesman; he yielded powers to Parliament amiably so long as it
financed his campaigns. Through his long rule he bled France white in
the effort to add her to his crown. Yet there was chivalry in him,
frequent gallantry, and such treatment of the captured French King John
as would have graced King Arthur’s court. After building the Round Tower
of Windsor with the forced labor of 722 men, he held a Round Table there
with his favorite knights; and he presided over many a chivalric joust.
Froissart tells a story, unverified, of how Ed- ward tried to seduce the
lovely Countess of Salisbury, was courteously re- pulsed, and staged a
tournament in order to feast his soul on her beauty again. 4 A charming
legend tells how the Countess dropped a garter while dancing at court,
and how the King snatched it up from the floor, and said, Honi soit qui
mal y pense — “Shame to him who evil thinks of it.” The phrase became
the motto of that Order of the Garter which Edward founded to- ward
1349.</p>
<p>Alice Perrers proved less difficult than the Countess; though
married, she</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT Z9</p>
<p>yielded herself to the avid monarch, took large grants of land in
return, and acquired such influence over him that Parliament registered
a protest. Queen Philippa (says her fond pensioner Froissart) bore all
this patiently, forgave him, and, on her deathbed, asked him only to
fulfill her pledges to charity, and, “when it shall please God to call
you hence, to choose no other sepul - cher, but to lie by my side.” 5 He
promised “with tears in his eyes,” returned to Alice, and gave he r the
Queen’s jewelry. 6</p>
<p>He waged his wars with energy, courage, and skill. War was then rated
the highest and noblest work of kings; unwarlike rulers were despised,
and three such in England’s history were deposed. If one may venture a
slight anachronism, a natural death was a disgrace that no man could
survive. Every member of the European nobility was trained to war; he
could ad- vance in possessions and power only by proficiency and bravery
in arms. The people suffered from the wars but, till this reign, had
rarely fought in them; their children lost the memory of the suffering,
heard old knightly tales of glory, and crowned with their choicest
laurels those of their kings that shed the most alien blood.</p>
<p>When Edward proposed to conquer France, few of bis councilors dared
to advise conciliation. Only when the war had dragged on through a
gener- ation, and had burdened even the rich with taxes, did the
national conscience raise a cry for peace. Discontent neared revolution
when Edward’s cam - paigns, passing from victory to failure, threatened
the collapse of the na- tion’s economy. Till 1370 Edward had profited in
war and diplomacy from the wise and loyal service of Sir John Chandos.
When this hero died, his place at the head of the King’s Council was
taken by Edward’s son, the Duke of Lancaster, named John of Gaunt from
the Gant or Ghent where he had been born. John carelessly turned the
government over to political buccaneers who fattened their purses at the
public expense. Demands for reform were raised in Parliament, and men of
good will prayed for the na- tion’s happy recovery through the King’s
speedy death. Another of his sons, the Black Prince — named probably
from the color of his armor — might have brought new vigor to the
government, but in 1376 he passed away while the old King lingered on.
T. he “Good Parliament” of that year enacted some reform measures, put
two malfeasants in jail, ordered Alice Perrers from court, and bound the
bishops to excommunicate her if she returned. After the Parliament
dispersed, Edward, ignoring its decrees, restored John of Gaunt to power
and Alice to the royal bed; and no bishop dared reprove her. At last the
obstinate monarch consented to die (1377). A son of the Black Prince
succeeded to the throne as Richard II, a lad of eleven years, amid
economic and political chaos, and religious revolt.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap, n</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>JOHN WYCLIF: 1320-84</li>
</ol>
<p>What were the conditions that led England, in the fourteenth century,
to rehearse the Reformation?</p>
<p>Probably the morals of the clergy played only a secondary role in the
drama. The higher clergy had reconciled itself to celibacy; we hear of a
Bishop Burnell who had five sons, 7 but presumably he was exceptional.
Wyclif, Langland, Gower, and Chaucer agreed in noting a predilection,
among monks and friars, for good food and bad women. But the Britons
would hardly have created a national furore over such deviations,
already hallowed by time, or about nuns who came to services with their
dogs on leash and their pet birds on their arms, 8 or monks who raced
through their incoherent prayers. (The humorous English assigned to
Satan a special assist- ant to collect all syllables dropped by
“graspers, leapers, gallopers, mumblers, fore-skippers, and fore-
runners” in such syncopated devotions, and allotted the sinner a year in
hell for each ignored or trampled syllable. 9 )</p>
<p>What gnawed at the purse nerves of laity and government was the
expand- ing and migratory wealth of the English Church. The clergy on
several occasions contributed a tenth of their income to the state, but
they insisted that no tax could be laid upon them without the consent of
their convoca- tions. Besides being represented in the Upper House of
Parliament by their bishops and abbots, they gathered, directly or by
proctors, in convocations under the archbishops of Canterbury and York,
and determined there all matters dealing with religion or the clergy. It
was usually from the ranks of the clergy, as the best-educated class in
England, that the king chose the highest officials of the state. Suits
of laymen against clergymen, touching Church property, were subject to t
he king’s courts, but the bishops’ courts had sole jurisdiction over
tonsured offenders. In many towns the Church leased property to tenants
and claimed full judicial authority over these ten- ants, even when they
committed crimes. 10 Such conditions were irritating, but the major
irritant was the flow of wealth from the English Church to the popes —
i.e., in the fourteenth century, to Avignon — i.e., to France. It was
estimated that more English money went to the pope than to the state or
the king. 11</p>
<p>An anticlerical party formed at the court. Laws were passed to make
ecclesiastical property bear a larger and steadier share in the expenses
of government. In 1333 Edward III refused to pay any longer the tribute
that King John of England had pledged to the popes in 1 2 1 3. In 1351
the Statute of Provisors sought to end papal control over the personnel
or revenues of English benefices. The First Statute of Praemunire (1353)
outlawed English- men who sued in “foreign” (papal) courts on matters
claimed by the king</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 31</p>
<p>o lie under secular jurisdiction. In 1376 the Commons officially
complained that papal collectors in England were sending great sums of
money to the pope, and that absentee French cardinals were drawing rich
revenues from English sees. 12</p>
<p>The anticlerical party at the court was led by John of Gaunt, whose
pro- tection enabled John Wyclif to die a natural death.</p>
<p>The first of the English reformers was born at Hipswell, near the
village of Wyclif, in north Yorkshire about 1320. He studied at Oxford,
became professor of theology there, and fcr a year (1360) was Master of
Balliol College. He was ordained to the priesthood, and received from
the popes various benefices or livings in parish churches, but continued
meanwhile to teach at the University. His literary activity was
alarming. He wrote vast Scholastic treatises on metaphysics, theology,
and logic, two volumes of polemics, four of sermons, and a medley of
short but influential tracts, in- cluding the famous Tractatus de civili
dominio. Most of his compositions were in graceless and impenetrable
Latin that should have made them harm- less to any but grammarians. But
hidden among these obscurities were explo- sive ideas that almost
severed Britain from the Roman Church 155 years before Henry VIII,
plunged Bohemia into civil war, and anticipated nearly all the reform
ideas of John Huss and Martin Luther.</p>
<p>Putting his worse foot forward, and surrendering to Augustine’s logic
and eloquence, Wyclif built his creed upon that awful doctrine of
predestination which was to remain even to our day the magnet and
solvent of Protestant theology. God, wrote Wyclif, gives His grace to
whomever He wishes, and has predestined each individual, an eternity
before birth, to be lost or saved through all eternity. Good works do
not win salvation, but they indicate that he who does them has received
divine grace and is one of the elect. We act according to the
disposition that God has allotted to us; to invert Heraclitus, our fate
is our character. Only Adam and Eve had free will; by their disobedience
they lost it for themselves and for their posterity.</p>
<p>God is sovereign lord of us all. The allegiance that we owe Him is
direct, as is the oath of every Englishman to the king, not indirect
through allegiance to a subordinate lord, as in feudal France. Hence the
relationship of man to God is direct, and requires no intermediary; any
claim of Church or priest to be a necessary medium must be repelled. 18
In this sense all Christians are priests, and need no ordination. God
holds dominion over all the earth and the contents thereof; a human
being can justly hold property only as His obedient vassal. Anyone who
is in a state of sin — which constitutes rebellion against the Divine
Sovereign — loses all right of possession, for rightful posses- sion
(“dominion”) requires a state of grace. Now it is clear from Scripture
that Christ intended His Apostles, their successors, and their ordained
dele-</p>
<p>32 THE REFORMATION (CHAP, D</p>
<p>gates to have no property. Any church or priest that owns property is
violating the Lord’s commandment, is therefore in a state of sin, and
conse - quently cannot validly administer the sacraments. The reform
most needed in Church and clergy is their complete renunciation of
wordly goods.</p>
<p>As if this were not troublesome enough, Wyclif deduced from his
theology a theoretical communism and anarchism. Any person in a state of
grace shares with God the ownership of all goods; ideally everything
should be held by the righteous in common. 14 Private property and
government (as some Scholastic philosophers had taught) are results of
Adam’s sin (i.e., of human nar are) and man’s inherited sinfulness; in a
society of universal virtue there would be no individual ownership, no
man-made laws of either Church or state. 15 Suspecting that the
radicals, who were at this time meditating revolt in England, would
interpret this literally, Wyclif explained that his com- munism was to
be understood only in an ideal sense; the powers that be, as Paul had
taught, are ordained by God, and must be obeyed. This flirtation with
revolution was almost precisely repeated by Luther in 1525.</p>
<p>The anticlerical party saw some sense, if not in Wyclif ’s communism,
at least in his condemnation of ecclesiastical wealth. When Parliament
again refused to pay King John’s tribute to the pope (1366), Wyclif was
engaged as peculiaris regis clericus — a cleric in the service of the
king — to prepare a defense of the act. 16 In 1 374 Edward III gave him
the rectory of Lutterworth, apparently as a retaining fee. 17 In July
1376, Wyclif was appointed to the royal commission sent to Bruges to
discuss with papal agents the continued refusal of England to pay the
tribute. When John of Gaunt proposed that the government should
confiscate part of the Church’s property, he invited Wyclif to defend
the proposal in a series of sermons in London; Wyclif complied
(September 1376), and was thereafter branded by the clerical party as a
tool of Gaunt. Bishop Courtenay of London decided to attack Gaunt
indirectly by indicting Wyclif as a heretic. The preacher was sum- moned
to appear before a council of prelates at St. Paul’s in February 1377.
He came, but accompanied by John of Gaunt with an armed retinue. The
soldiers entered into a dispute with some spectators; a fracas ensued,
and the bishop thought it discreet to adjourn. Wyclif returned unhurt to
Oxford. Courtenay dispatched to Rome a detailed accusation quoting
fifty-two pas- sages from Wyclif’s works. In May, Gregory XI issued
bulls condemning eighteen propositions, mostly from the treatise On
Civil Dominion, and ordered Archbishop Sudbury and Bishop Courtenay to
inquire whether Wyclif still held these views; if he did they were to
arrest him and keep him in chains pending further instructions.</p>
<p>By this time Wyclif had won the support not only of John of Gaunt and
Lord Percy of Northumberland but of a large body of public opinion as
well. The Parliament that met in October was strongly anticlerical.
The</p>
<p>CHAP.n) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 33</p>
<p>argument for disendowment of the Church had charms for many members,
who reckoned that if the King should seize the wealth now held by
English bishops, abbots, and priors, he could maintain with it fifteen
earls, 1,500 knights, 6,200 squires, and have £ 20,000 a year left for
himself. 18 At this time France was preparing to invade England, and the
English treasury was almost empty; how foolish it seemed to let papal
agents collect funds from English parishes for a French pope and a
college of cardinals overwhelmingly French! The King’s advisers asked
Wyclif to prepare an opinion on the question “Whether the Realm of
England can legitimately, when the neces - sity of repelling invasion is
imminent, withhold the treasure of the Realm that it be not sent to
foreign parts, although the pope demand it under pain of cen- sure and
in virtue of obedience to him?” Wyclif answered in a pamphlet that in
effect called for the severance of the English Church from the papacy.
“The pope,” he wrote, “cannot deman d this treasure except by way of
alms…. Since all charity begins at home, it would be the work not of
charity but of fatuity to direct the alms of the Realm abroad when the
Realm itself is in need of them.” Against the contention that the
English C hurch was part of, and should obey, the universal or Catholic
Church, Wyclif recommended the ecclesiastical independence of England.
“The Realm of England, in the words of Scripture, ought to be one body,
and clergy, lords, and commonalty members of th at body.” 19 This
anticipation of Henry VIII seemed so bold that the King’s advisers
directed Wyclif to make no further statements on the matter.</p>
<p>The Parliament adjourned on November 28. On December 18 the em-
battled bishops published the condemnatory bulls, and bade the
chancellor of Oxford to enforce the Pope’s order of arrest. The
university was then at the height of its intellectual independence. In
1322 it had assumed the right to depose an unsatisfactory chancellor
without consulting its formal supe- rior, the Bishop of Lincoln; in 1367
it had thrown off all episcopal control. Half of the faculty supported
Wyclif, at least in his right to express his opinions. The chancellor
refused to obey the bishops, and denied the au- thority of any prelate
over the university in matters of belief; meanwhile he counseled Wyclif
to remain in modest seclusion for a while. But it is a rare reformer who
can be silent. In March 1378, Wyclif appeared before the bish ops’
assembly at Lambeth to defend his views. As the hearing was about to
begin, the Archbishop received a letter from the mother of King Richard
II deprecating any final condemnation of Wyclif; and in the midst of the
proceedings a crowd forced its way in from the street and declared that
the English people would not tolerate any Inquisition in England.
Yielding to this combination of government and populace, the bishops
deferred decision, and again Wyclif went home unhurt — indeed,
triumphant. On March 27 Gregory XI died, and a few months later the
Papal Schism divided and</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>weakened the papacy, and the whole authority of the Church. Wyclif
re- sumed the offensive, and issued tract after tract, many in English,
extending his heresies and revolt.</p>
<p>He is pictured to us in these years as a man hardened by controversy
and made puritan by age. He was no mystic; rather, a warrior and an
organizer; and perhaps he carried his logic to merciless extremes. His
talent for vituper- ation now disported itself freely. He denounced the
friars for preaching poverty and accumulating collective wealth. He
thought some monasteries were “dens of thieves, nests of serpents,
houses of living devils.” 20 He chal - lenged the theory that the merits
of the saints could be applied to the rescue of souls from purgatory;
Christ and the Apostles had taught no doctrine of indulgences. “Prelates
deceive men by feigned i ndulgences or pardons, and rob them cursedly of
their money…. Men be great fools that buy these bulls of pardon so
dear.” 21 If the pope had the power to snatch souls from purgatory, why
did he not in Christian charity take them out at once? 22 Wi th mounting
vehemence Wyclif alleged that “many priests… defile wives, maidens,
widows, and nuns in every manner of lechery ,” 28 and de - manded that
the crimes of the clergy should be punishable by secular courts. He
excoriated curates who flattered the rich and despised the poor, who
easily forgave the sins of the wealthy but excommunicated the indigent
for unpaid tithes, who hunted and hawked and gambled, and related fake
mira- cles. 24 The prelates of England, he charged, “take poor men’s li
velihood, but they do not oppose oppression”; they “set more price by
the rotten penny than by the precious blood of Christ”; they pray only
for show, and collect fees for every religious service that they
perform; they live in luxury, riding fat horses with harness of silver
and gold; “they are robbers… malicious foxes… ravishing wolves…
gluttons… devils… apes”; 26 here even Luther’s language is forecast.
“Simony reigns in all states of the Church…. The simony of the court of
Rome does most harm, for it is most common, and under most color of
holiness, and robs most our land of men and treas- ure.” 28 The
scandalous rivalry of the popes (in the Schism), their bandying of
excommunications, their unashamed str uggle for power, “should move men
to believe in popes only so far as these follow Christ.” 27 A pope or a
priest “is a lord, yea, even a king,” in matters spiritual; but if he
assumes earthly possessions, or political authority, he is unworthy of
his of fice. “Christ had not whereon to rest His head, but men say this
pope hath more than half the Empire…. Christ was meek… the pope sits on
his throne and makes lords to kiss his feet.” 28 Perhaps, Wyclif gently
suggested, the pope is the Antichrist predicted in the First Epistle of
the Apostle John , 29 the Beast of the Apocalypse , 80 heralding the
second coming of Christ. 81</p>
<p>The solution of the problem, as Wyclif saw it, lay in separating the
Church from all material possessions and power. Christ and his Apostles
had lived in</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 35</p>
<p>poverty; so should his priests. 82 The friars and monks should return
to the full observance of their rules, avoiding all property or luxury;
88 priests “should with joy suffer temporal lordship to be taken from
them”; they should content themselves with food and clothing, and live
on freely given alms. 84 If the clergy will not disendow themselves by a
voluntary return to evangelical poverty, the state should step in and
confiscate their goods. “Let lords and kings mend them” and “constrain
priests to hold to the poverty that Christ ordained.” 38 Let not the
king, in so doing, fear the curses of the pope, for “no man’s c ursing
hath any strength but inasmuch as God Himself curseth.” 88 Kings are
responsible to God alone, from Whom they derive their dominion. Instead
of accepting the doctrine of Gregory VII and Boni- face VIII that
secular governments must be subject to the Church, the state, said
Wyclif, should consider itself supreme in all temporal matters and
should take control of all ecclesiastical property. Priests should be
ordained by the king. 37</p>
<p>The power of the priest lay in his right to administer the
sacraments. Wyclif turned to these with a full anticipation of Luther
and Calvin. He denied the necessity of auricular confession, and
advocated a return to the voluntary public confession favored by the
early Christians. “Privy confes - sion made to priests… is not needful,
but brought in late by the Fiend; for Christ used it not, nor any of His
Apostles after Him.” 38 It now makes men</p>
<p>Wyclif would not admit that these ideas were heretical, but this
theory of “consubstantiality” alarmed some of his supporters. John of
Gaunt hurried over to Oxford, and urged his friend to say no more about
the Eucharist (1381). Wyclif rejected the advice, and reaffirmed his
views in a Confessio dated May 10, 1381. A month later social revolution
flared out in England, and frightened all property owners into
discountenancing any doctrine that threatened any form of property, lay
or ecclesiastical. Wyclif now lost most of his backing in the
government, and the assassination of Archbishop Sud- bury by the rebels
promoted his most resolute enemy, Bishop Courtenay, to</p>
<p>36 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. II</p>
<p>he primacy of England. Courtenay felt that if Wyclif s conception of
the Eucharist were allowed to spread, it would undermine the prestige of
the clergy, and therefore also the foundation of the Church’s moral
authority. In May 13 82, he summoned a council of clergy to meet at the
Blackfriars’ Convent in London. Having persuaded this assembly to
condemn twenty- four propositions which he read from Wyclif ’s works, he
sent a peremptory</p>
<p>Embarrassed by the admiration expressed for him by the priest John
Ball, a chief protagonist of the revolt, Wyclif issued several tracts
dissociating himself from the rebels; he disclaimed any socialist views,
and urged his fol- lowers to submit patiently to their terrestrial lords
in the firm hope of recom- pense after death. 42 Nevertheless he
continued his pamphleteering against the Church, and organized a body of
“Poor Preaching Priests” to spread his Reformation among the people.
Some of these “Lollards” * were men of meager schooling, some were
Oxford dons. All went robed in black wool and barefoot, like the early
friars; all were warmed with the ardor of men who had rediscovered
Christ. Theirs was already the Protestant emphasis on an infallible
Bible as against the fallible traditions and dogmas of the Church, and
on the sermon in the vernacular as against a mystic ritual in a foreign
tongue. 48 For these lay priests, and for their literate hearers, Wyclif
wrote in rough and vigorous English some 300 sermons and many religious
tracts. And since he urged a return to the Christianity of the New
Testament, he set himself and his aides to translate the Bible as the
sole and unerring guide to true religion. Till that time (1381) only
small portions of Scripture had been rendered into English; a French
translation was known to the educated classes, and an Anglo- Saxon
version, unintelligible to Wyclif ’s Eng land, had come down from King
Alfred’s time. The Church, finding that heretics like the Waldensians
made much use of the Bible, had discouraged the people from reading
unauthorized translations, 44 and had deprecated the creedal chaos that
she expected when every party should make and color its own translation,
and every reader be free to make his own interpretation, of the
Scriptural text. But Wyclif was resolved that the Bible should be
available to any Englishman who could read. He appears to have
translated the New Testament himself, leaving the Old Testament to
Nicholas Hereford and John Purvey. The whole was finished some ten years
after Wyclif’s death.</p>

<p>The translation was made from Jerome’s Latin version, not from the
Hebrew</p>
<p>In 1 3 84 Pope Urban VI summoned Wyclif to appear before him in Rome.
A different summons exceeded it in authority. On December 28, 1384, the
ailing reformer suffered a paralytic stroke as he was attending Mass,
and three days later he died. He was buried in Lutterworth, but by a
decree of the Council of Constance (May 4, 1415) his bones were dug up
and cast into a near-by stream. 48 Search was made for his writings, and
as many as were found were destroyed.</p>
<p>All the major elements of the Reformation were in Wyclif: the revolt
against the worldliness of the clergy, and the call for a sterner
morality; the return from the Church to the Bible, from Aquinas to
Augustine, from free will to predestination, from salvation by works to
election by divine grace; the rejection of indulgences, auricular
confession, and transubstantiation; the deposition of the priest as an
intermediary between God and man; the protest against the alienation of
national wealth to Rome; the invitation to the state to end its
subordination to the papacy; the attack (preparing for Henry VIII) on
the temporal possessions of the clergy. If the Great Revolt had not
ended the governm ent’s protection of Wyclif’s efforts, the Refor -
mation might have taken form and root in England 130 years before it
broke out in Germany.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>THE GREAT REVOLT: 1 38 1</li>
</ol>
<p>England and Wales had in 1307 a population precariously estimated at
3,000,000 — a slow increase from a supposed 2,500,000 in 1066. 46 The
figures suggest a sluggish advance of agricultural and industrial
techniques — and an effective control of human multiplication by famine,
disease, and war — in a fertile but narrow island never meant to sustain
with its own resources any great multitude of men. Probably three
fourths of the people were peasants, and half of these were serfs; in
this regard England lagged a century behind France.</p>
<p>Class distinctions were sharper than on the Continent. Life seemed to
re- volve about two foci: gracious or arrogant lordship at one end,
hopeful or resentful service at the other. The barons, aside from their
limited duties to the king, were masters of all they surveyed, and of
much beyond. The dukes of Lancaster, Norfolk, and Buckingham had estates
rivaling those of the Crown, and the Nevilles and Percys had hardly
less. The feudal lord bound his vassal knights and their squires to
serve and defend him and wear his “liv -</p>
<p>38 THE REFORMATION (CHAP, n</p>
<p>ery.” * Nevertheless one might rise from class to class; a rich
merchant’s daughter could catch a noble and a title, and Chaucer,
reborn, would have been startled to find his granddaughter a duchess.
The middle classes assumed such manners of the aristocracy as they could
manage; they began to address one another as Master in England, Mon
seigneur in France; soon every man was a Mister or Monsieur, and every
woman a Mistress or Madame A</p>
<p>Industry progressed faster than agriculture. By 1300 almost all the
coal- fields of Britain were being worked; silver, iron, lead, and tin
were mined, and the export of metals ranked high in the nation’s foreign
trade; it was a common remark that “the kingdom is of greater value
under t he land than above.” 47 The woolen industry began in this
century to make England rich. The lords withdrew more and more lands
from the common uses formerly allowed to their serfs and tenants, and
turned large tracts into sheep en- closures; more money could be made by
selling wool than by tilling the land. The wool merchants were for a
time the wealthiest traders in England, able to yield great sums in
loans and taxes to Edward III, who ruined them. Tired of seeing raw wool
go from England to feed the clothing industry of Flan- ders, Edward
(1331 f.) lured Flemish weavers to Britain, and through their
instruction established a textile industry there. Then he forbade the
export of wool and the import of most foreign cloth. By the end of the
fourteenth century the manufacture of clothing had replaced the trade in
wool as the main source of England’s liquid wealth and had reached a
semi -capitalistic stage.</p>
<p>The new industry required the close co-operation of many crafts —
weav- ing, fulling, carding, dyeing, finishing; the old craft guilds
could not arrange the disciplined collaboration needed for economical
production; enterprising masters — entrepreneurs — gathered diverse
specializations of labor into one organization, which they financed and
controlled. However, no such factory system arose here as in Florence
and Flanders; most of the work was- still done in small shops by a
master, his apprentices, and a few journeymen, or in little rural mills
using water power, or in country homes where patient fingers plied the
loom when household chores allowed. The craft guilds fought the new
system with strikes, but its superior productivity overrode all
opposition; and the workers who competed to sell their toil and skill
were increasingly at the mercy of men who furnished capital and
management. Town proletarians “lived from hand to mouth… indifferently
clad and housed, in good times well fed, but in bad times not fed at
all.” 48 All male</p>

<li>Livery was originally, in Anglo-French, livree, a delivery or
allowance of provisions or clothing, made by a lord to a vassal. In time
the clothing took on the character of a uniform worn by the clients of a
great man in the pomp of his retinue. Guilds adopted the custom and
proudly wore their distinctive livery at their meetings and in their
parades. Such habits gave color to “Merrie England.”</li>

<p>CHAP, n) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 39</p>
<p>inhabitants of English cities were subject to conscription of their
labor for public works, but rich men could pay for substitutes. 49
Poverty was bitter, though probably less extreme than in the early
nineteenth century. Beggars abounded, and organized to protect and
govern their profession. Churches, monasteries, and guilds provided a
limping charity.</p>
<p>Upon this scene the Black Death burst as not only a catastrophic
visitation but almost as an economic revolution. The English people
lived in a climate more favorable to vegetation than to health; the
fields were green the year round, but the population suffered from gout,
rheumatism, asthma, sciatica, tuberculosis, dropsy, and diseases of eyes
and skin. 50 All classes ate a heavy diet and kept war m with alcoholic
drinks. “Few men now reach the age of forty,” said Richard Rolle about
1340, “and fewer still the age of fifty.” 51 Public sanitation was
primitive; the stench of tanneries, pigsties, and latrines sullied the
air; only the well-to-do had running water piped into their homes; the
majority fetched it from conduits or wells and could not waste it on
weekly baths. 52 The lower classes offered ready victims for the
pestilences that periodically decimated the population. In 1349 the
bubonic plague crossed from Normandy to England and Wales, and thence a
year later into Scotland and Ireland; it returned to England in 1361,
1368, 1375, 1382, 1390, 1438, 1464; all in all it carried away one
Englishman out of every three. 53 Nearly half the clergy died; perhaps
some of the abuses later com- plained of in the English Church were due
to the necessity of hastily impress- ing into her service men lacking
the proper qualifications of training and character. Art suffered;
ecclesiastical building almost stopped for a gener- ation. Morals
suffered; family ties were loosed, sexual relations overflowed the banks
within which the institution of marriage sought to confine them for
social order’s sake. The laws lacked officers to enforce them, and
were</p>
<p>The plague collaborated with war to quicken the decline of the
manorial system. Many peasants, having lost their children or other
aides, deserted their tenancies for the towns; landowners were obliged
to hire free workers at twice the former wage, to attract new tenants
with easier terms than be- fore, and to commute feudal services into
money payments. Themselves forced to pay rising prices for everything
that they bought, the landlords appealed to the government to stabilize
wages. The Royal Council re- sponded (June 18, 1349) with an ordinance
substantially as follows:</p>
<p>Because a great part of the People, and especially of Workers and</p>
<p>Servants, late died of the pestilence, and many… will not serve
unless they receive excessive wages, and some rather willing to beg in
idle- ness than by Labour to get their Living; We, considering the

Labourers, may hereafter come, have upon deliberation and treaty</p>

<li>Every person able in Body and under the Age of sixty Years,</li>

<li><p>No person shall give anything to a Beggar that is able to labour.
64</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This ordinance was so widely disregarded by employers and employees
that Parliament issued (February 9, 1 3 5 1 ) a Statute of Labourers,
specifying that no wages should be paid above the 1346 rate, fixing
definite prices for a large number of services and commodities, and
establishing enforcement machinery. A further act of 1360 decreed that
peasants who left their lands before the term of their contract or
tenancy expired might be brought back by force, and, at the discretion
of the justices of the peace, might be branded on the brow. 06 Similar
measures, of increasing severity, were enacted be- tween 1377 and 1381.
Wages rose despite them, but the strife so engendered between laborers
and government inflamed the conflict of classes, and lent new weapons to
the preachers of revolt.</p>
<p>The rebellion that ensued had a dozen sources. Those peasants who
were still serfs demanded freedom; those who were free called for an end
to feudal dues still required of them; and tenants urged that the rent
of land should be lowered to four pence (.67?) per acre per year. Some
towns were still subject to feudal overlords, and longed for
self-government. In the liberated communities the workingmen hated the
mercantile oligarchy, and journey- men protested against their
insecurity and poverty. All alike — peasants, pro- letarians, even
parish priests — denounced the governmental mismanagement of Edward
Ill’s last years, of Richard II’s earliest; they asked why English arms
had so regularly been beaten after 1369, and why such heavy taxes had
been raised to finance such defeats. They particularly abominated Arch-
bishop Sudbury and Robert Hales, the chief ministers of the young king,
and John of Gaunt as the front and protector of governmental corruption
and incompetence.</p>
<p>The Lollard preachers had little connection with the movement, but
they had shared in preparing minds for the revolt. John Ball, the
intellectual of the rebellion, quoted Wyclif approvingly, and Wat Tyler
followed Wyclif in demanding disendowment of the Church. Ball was the
“mad priest of</p>
<p>CHAP.n) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 41</p>
<p>Kent” (as Froissart called him) who taught communism to his
congregation, and was excommunicated in 13 66. 58 He became an itinerant
preacher, de- nouncing the wicked wealth of prelates and lords, calling
for a return of the clergy to evangelical poverty, and making fun of the
rival popes who, in the. Schism, were dividing the garments of Christ.
57 Tradition ascribed to him a famous couplet:</p>
<p>When Adam delved and Eve span</p>
<p>Who was then the gentleman? 68</p>
<p>— i.e., when Adam dug in the earth and Eve plied the loom, were there
any class divisions in Eden? Froissart, though so fond of the English
aristocracy, quoted Ball’s alleged views at sympathetic length:</p>
<p>My good friends, matters cannot go on well in England until all</p>
<p>hings shall be in common; when there shall be neither vassals nor</p>
<p>lords, when the lords shall be no more masters than ourselves. How
ill they behave to us! For what reason do they thus hold us in
bondage?</p>
<p>Are we not all descended from the same parents, Adam and Eve? And
what can they show why they should be more masters than ourselves?</p>
<p>… We are called slaves, and if we do not perform our service we are
beaten…. Let us go to the King and remonstrate with him; he is</p>
<p>young, and from him we may obtain a favorable answer; and if not</p>
<p>we must ourselves seek to amend our condition. 69</p>
<p>Ball was thrice arrested, and when the revolt broke out he was in
jail.</p>
<p>The poll tax of 1380 capped the discontent. The government was
nearing bankruptcy, the pledged jewels of the king were about to be
forfeited, the war in France was crying out for new funds. A tax of £
100,000 (0,000,- 000? ) was laid upon the people, to be collected from
every inhabitant above the age of fifteen. All the diverse elements of
revolt were united by this fresh imposition. Thousands of persons evaded
the collectors, and the total receipts fell far short of the goal. When
the government sent new commissioners to ferret out the evaders, the
populace gathered in force and defied them; at Brentwood the royal
agents were stoned out of the town (1381), and like scenes occurred at
Fobbing, Corringham, and St. Albans. Mass meetings of protest against
the tax were held in London; they sent encouragement to the rural
rebels, and invited them to march upon the capital, to join the in-
surgents there, and “so press the King that there should no longer be a
serf in England.” 60</p>
<p>A group of collectors entering Kent met a riotous repulse. On June 6,
1381, a mob broke open the dungeons at Rochester, freed the prisoners,
and plundered the castle. On the following day the rebels chose as their
chief Wat Tegheler, or Tyler. Nothing is known of his antecedents;
apparently he was an ex-soldier, for he disciplined the disorderly horde
into united action.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>4 *</p>
<p>(chap, n</p>
<p>and won its quick obedience to his commands. On June 8 this swelling
multi- tude, armed with bows and arrows, cudgels, axes, and swords, and
receiving recruits from almost every village in Kent, attacked the homes
of unpop ular landlords, lawyers, and governmental officials. On June io
it was welcomed into Canterbury, sacked the palace of the absent
Archbishop Sudbury, opened the jail, and plundered the mansions of the
rich. All eastern Kent now joined in die revolt; town after town rose,
and local officials ran be- fore the storm. Rich men fled to other parts
of England, or concealed them- selves in out-of-the-way places, or
escaped further damage by making a contribution to the rebel cause. On
June 1 1 Tyler turned his army toward London. At Maidstone it delivered
John Ball from jail; he joined the caval- cade, and preached to it every
day. Now, he said, would begin that reign of Christian democracy which
he had so long dreamed of and pled for; all social inequalities would be
leveled; there would no longer be rich and poor, lords and serfs; every
man would be a king. 61</p>
<p>Meanwhile related uprisings occurred in Norfolk, Suffolk,
Beverly,</p>
<p>Bridgewater, Cambridge, Essex, Middlesex, Sussex, Hertford, Somerset.
At Bury St. Edmund the people cut off the head of the prior, who had too
stoutly asserted the feudal rights of the abbey over the town. At
Colchester the rioters killed several Florentine merchants who were
believed to be cut- ting in on British trade. Wherever possible they
destroyed the rolls, leases, or charters that recorded feudal ownership
or bondage; hence the townsfolk of Cambridge burned the charters of the
University; and at Waltham every document in the abbey archives was
committed to the flames.</p>
<p>On June i 1 a rebel army from Essex and Hertford approached the
north- ern outskirts of London; on the twelfth the Kent insurgents
reached South- wark, just across the Thames. No organized resistance was
offered by the adherents of the King. Richard II, Sudbury, and Hales hid
in the Tower. Tyler sent the King a request for an interview; it was
refused. The mayor of London, William Walworth, closed the city gates,
but they were re- opened by revolutionists within the town. On June 13
the Kent forces marched into the capital, were welcomed by the people,
and were joined by thousands of laborers. Tyler held his host fairly
well in leash, but ap- peased its fury by allowing it to sack the palace
of John of Gaunt. Nothing was stolen there; one rioter who tried to
filch a silver goblet was killed by the crowd. But everything was
destroyed; costly furniture was thrown out of the windows, rich hangings
were tom to rags, jewelry was smashed to bits; then the house was burned
to the ground, and some jolly rebels who had drunk themselves to stupor
in the wine cellar were forgotten and con- sumed in the flames.
Thereafter the army turned on the Temple, citadel of the lawyers of
England; the peasants remembered that lawyers had written the deeds of
their servitude, or had assessed their holdings for taxation; there</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 43</p>
<p>oo they made a holocaust of the records, and burned the buildings to
the ground. The jails in Newgate and the Fleet were destroyed, and the
happy inmates joined the mob. Wearied with its efforts to crowd a
century of re- venge into a day, the multitudes lay down in the open
spaces of the city, and slept.</p>
<p>That evening the King’s Council thought better of its refusal to let
him talk with Tyler. They sent an invitation to Tyler and his followers
to meet with Richard the next morning at a northern suburb known as Mile
End. Shortly after dawn on June 14 the fourteen-year-old King, risking
hie life, rode out of the Tower with all of his council except Sudbury
and Hales, who dared not expose themselves. The little party made its
way through the hostile crowd to Mile End, where the Essex rebels were
already gathered; part of the Kent army followed, with Tyler at its
head. He was surprised at the readiness of Richard to grant nearly all
demands. Serfdom was to be abolished throughout England, all feudal dues
and services were to end, the rental of the tenants would be as they had
asked; and a general amnesty would absolve all those who had shared in
the revolt. Thirty clerks were at once set to work drawing up charters
of freedom and forgiveness for all districts that applied. One demand
the King refused — that the royal ministers and other “traitors” should
be surrendered to the people. Richard replied that all persons accused
of misconduct in government would be tried by orderly process of law,
and would be punished if found guilty.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this answer, Tyler and a selected band rode
rapidly to the Tower. They found Sudbury singing Mass in the chapel.
They dragged him out into the courtyard and forced him down with his
neck on a log. The executioner was an amateur, and required eight
strokes of the ax to sever the head. The insurgents then beheaded Hales
and two others. Upon the Archbishop’s head they fixed his miter firmly
with a nail driven into the skull; they mounted the heads on pikes,
carried them in procession through the city, and set them up over the
gate of London Bridge. All the remainder of that day was spent in
slaughter. London tradesmen, resenting Flemish competition, bade the
crowd kill every Fleming found in the capital. To determine the
nationality of a suspect he was shown bread and cheese and bidden name
them; if he answered brod und kase, or spoke with a Flemish brogue, he
forfeited his fife. Over 1 50 aliens — merchants and bankers — were
slain in London on that day in June, and many English lawyers, tax col-
lectors, and adherents of John of Gaunt fell under the axes and hatchets
of indiscriminate vengeance. Apprentices murdered their masters, debtors
their creditors. At midnight the sated victors again retired to
rest.</p>
<p>Informed of these events, the King returned from Mile End and went,
not to the Tower, but to his mother’s rooms near St. Paul’s. Meanwhile a
large number of the Essex and Hertford contingents, -ejoicing in their
charters</p>

<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>of freedom, dispersed toward their homes. On June 15 the King sent a
modest message to the remaining rebels asking them to meet him in the
open spaces of Smithfield outside Aldersgate. Tyler agreed. Before
keeping this rendezvous, Richard, fearing death, confessed and took the
Sacrament; then he rode out with a retinue of 200 men whose peaceful
garb hid swords. At Smithfield Tyler came forward with only a single
companion to guard him. He made new demands, uncertainly reported, but
apparently including the confiscation of Church property and the
distribution of the proceeds among the people. 82 A dispute ensued; one
of the King’s escort calle d Tyler a thief; Tyler directed his aide to
strike the man down; Mayor Walworth blocked the way; Tyler stabbed at
Walworth, whose life was saved by the armor under his cloak; Walworth
wounded Tyler with a short cutlass, and one of Richard’s squires ran
Tyler through twice with a sword. Tyler rode back to his host crying
treason, and fell dead at their feet. Shocked by what seemed to them
plain treachery, the rebels set their arrows and prepared to shoot.
Though their numbers were reduced, they were still a substantial force,
reckoned by Froissart at 20,000; probably they could have over- whelmed
the King’s retinue. But Richard now rode out bravely toward them, crying
out, “Sirs, will you shoot your king? I will be your chief and captain;
you shall have from me that which you seek. Only follow me into the
fields without.” He rode out slowly, not sure that they would heed or
spare him. The insurgents hesitated, then followed him, and most of the
royal guard mingled in their midst.</p>
<p>Walworth, however, turned sharply back, galloped into the city, and
sent orders to the aldermen of its twenty-four wards to join him with
all the armed forces they could muster. Many citizens who at first had
sympathized with the revolt were now disturbed by the murders and
pillage; every man who had any property felt his goods and his life to
be in peril; so the Mayor found an impromptu army of 7,000 men rising at
his command as if out of the earth. These he led back to Smithfield;
there he rejoined and surrounded the King; and offered to massacre the
rebels. Richard refused; the rebels had spared him when he was at their
mercy, and he would not now show himself less generous. He announced to
them that they were free to depart in safety. The Essex and Hertford
remnants rapidly melted away; the London muti- neers disappeared into
their haunts; only the Kent contingent stayed. Their passage through the
city was blocked by Walworth’s armed men, but Rich - ard ordered that no
one should molest them; they marched off in safety, and filed back in
disorder along the Old Kent Road. The King returned to his mother, who
greeted him with tears of happy relief. “Ah, fair son, what pain and
anguish have I had for you this day !” “Certes, Madam,” the boy an -
swered. “I know it well. But now rejoice and praise God, for today I
have recovered my heritage that was lost, and the realm of England too.”

<p>CHAP. Il) VVYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 45</p>
<p>Probably under the prodding of the Mayor who had saved him, Richard
on that same June 1 5 issued a proclamation banishing from London, on
pain of death, all persons who had not lived there for a year past.
Walworth and his troops searched streets and tenements for such aliens,
caught many, killed several. Among these was one Jack Straw, who
confessed, presumably under torture, that the men of Kent had planned to
make Tyler king. In the mean- time a deputation from the Essex
insurgents arrived at Waltham and de- manded of the King a formal
ratification of the promises he had made on June 14. Richard replied
that these had been made under duress, and that he had no intention of
keeping them; on the contrary, he told them, “Villeins you are still,
and villeins you shall remain”; and he threatened dread ven - geance on
any man who continued in armed rebellion. 64 The angry deputies called
upon their followers to renew the revolt; some did, but these were cut
down with great slaughter by Walworth’s men (June 28).</p>
<p>On July 2 the embittered King revoked all charters and amnesties
granted by him during the outbreak, and opened the way to a judicial
inquiry into the identity and actions of the main participants. Hundreds
were arrested and tried; 1 10 or more were put to death. John Ball was
caught at Coventry; he fearlessly avowed his leading role in the
insurrection, and refused to ask pardon of the King. He was hanged,
drawn, and quartered; and his head, with those of Tyler and Jack Straw,
replaced those of Sudbury and Hales as adornments of London Bridge. On
November 13 Richard laid before Parliament an account of his actions;
if, he said, the assembled prelates and lords and commons wished the
serfs to be freed, he was quite willing. But the members were nearly all
landowners; they could not admit the right of the King to dispose of
their property; they voted that all existing feudal re- lations should
be maintained. 65 The beaten peasants returned to their plows, the
sullen workers to their looms.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE NEW LITERATURE</li>
</ol>
<p>The English language was becoming by slow stages a fit vehicle for
literature. The Norman invasion of 1066 had stopped the evolution of
Anglo-Saxon into English, and for a time French was the official
language of the realm. Gradually a new vocabulary and idiom formed,
basically Germanic, but mingled and adorned with Gallic words and turns.
The long war with France may have spurred the nation to rebel against
this linguistic domination by an enemy. In 1362 English was declared to
be the language of law and the courts; and in 1363 the chancellor set a
precedent by opening Parliament with an English address. Scholars,
chroniclers, and philosophers (even till Francis Bacon) continued to
write in Latin to reach an international audience, but poets and
dramatists hence- forth spoke the speech of England.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>(CHAP, II</p>
<p>The oldest drama extant in English was a “mystery”— a dramatic
representa- tion of a religious story — performed in the Midlands, about
1350, under the title of The Harrowing of Hell y which staged a duel in
words, at the mouth of hell, between Satan and Christ In the fourteenth
century it became customary for the guilds of a town to present a cycle
of mysteries: a guild would prepare a scene, usually from the Bible,
carry the setting and the actors on a float, and act the scenes on
temporary stages built at populous centers in the city; and on suc-
cessive days other guilds would present later scenes from the same
Biblical nar- rative. The earliest such cycle now known is that of the
Chester mysteries of 1328; by 1400 similar cycles were presented in
York, Beverly, Cambridge, Cov- entry, Wakefield, Towneley, and London.
As early as 1182 the Latin mysteries had developed a variety called the
“miracle,” centering around the miracle or sufferings of some saint.
About 1378 another variety appeared — the “morality” — which pointed a
moral by acting a tale; this form would reach its peak in Everyman (
c. 1480). Early in the fifteenth century we hear of still another
dramatic form, doubtless then already old: the interlude, not a play
between plays but a ludus — a play or show — carried on between two or
more actors. Its subject was not restricted to religion or morality, but
might be secular, humor- ous, profane, even obscene. Minstrel troupes
played interludes in baronial or guild halls, in town or village
squares, or in the courtyard of a frequented inn. In 1 348 Exeter raised
the first-known English theater, the first European build- ing, since
classic Roman structures, specifically and regularly devoted to dramatic
representations. 66 From the interludes would evolve the comedies, and
from the mysteries and moralities would develop the tragedies, of the
lusty Elizabethan stage.</p>
<p>The first major poem — one of the strangest and strongest poems — in
the Eng- lish language called itself The Vision of William Concerning
Piers the Plowman. Nothing is known of the author except through his
poem; assuming that this is autobiographical, we may name him William
Langland and place his birth near</p>
<ol start="1332" type="1">
<li>He took minor orders, but never became a priest; he wandered to
London and earned something short of starvation by singing Psalms at
Masses for the dead. He lived dissolutely, sinned with “covetousness of
eyes and concupiscence of the flesh,” had a daughter, perhaps married
her mother, and dwelled with them in a hovel in Comhill. He describes
himself as a tall, gaunt figure, dressed in a somber robe befitting the
gray disillusionment of his hopes. He was fond of his poem, issued it
thrice (1362, 1 377, 1 394), and each time spun it out to greater
length. Like the Anglo-Saxon poets, he used no rhyme, but alliterative
verse of irregular meter.</li>
</ol>
<p>He begins by picturing himself as falling asleep on a Malvern hill,
and seeing in a dream a “field full of folk”— multitudes of rich, poor,
good, bad, young, old — and amid them a fair and noble lady whom he
identifies with Holy Church. He kneels before her and begs for “no
treasure, but tell me how I may save my ^oul.” She replies:</p>
<p>When all treasures are tried, Truth is best….</p>
<p>Whoso is true of his tongue, and telleth naught but that.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT</p>
<p>And doeth the works therewith, and willeth no man ill,</p>
<p>He is a god by the gospel… and like to Our Lord. 67</p>
<p>In a second dream he visions the Seven Deadly Sins, and under each
head he indicts the wickedness of man in a powerful satire. For a time
he abandons him- self to cynical pessimism, awaiting an early end of the
world. Then Piers (Peter) the Plowman enters the poem. He is a model
farmer, honest, friendly, generous, trusted by all, working hard, living
faithfully with his wife and children, and always a pious son of the
Church. In later visions William sees the same Piers as the human
Christ, as Peter the Apostle, as a pope, then as vanishing in the Papal
Schism and the advent of Antichrist. The clergy, says the poet, are no
longer a saving remnant; many of them have become corrupt; they deceive
the simple, absolve the rich for a consideration, traffic in sacred
things, sell heaven itself for a coin. What is a Christian to do in such
a universal debacle? He must, says William, go forth again, over all
intervening institutions and corruptions, and seek the living Christ
Himself. 68</p>
<p>Piers the Plowman contains its quota of nonsense, and its obscure
allegories weary any reader who lays upon authors the moral obligation
to be clear. But it is a sincere poem, flays rascals impartially,
pictures the human scene vividly, rises through touches of feeling and
beauty to a place second only to the Canter - bury Tales in the English
literature of the fourteenth century. Its influence was remarkable;
Piers became for the rebels of England a symbol of the righteous,
fearless peasant; John Ball recommended him to the Essex insurgents of
1381; as late as the Reformation his name was invoked in criticizing the
old religious order and demanding a new. 69 In ending his visions, the
poet returned from Piers the pope to Piers again the peasant; if all of
us, he concluded, were, like Piers, simple, practicing Christians, that
would be the greatest, the final revolution; no other would ever be
needed.</p>
<p>John Gower is a less romantic poet and figure than the mysterious
Langland. He was a rich landowner of Kent who imbibed too much
scholastic erudition, and achieved dullness in three languages. He, too,
attacked the faults of the clergy; but he trembled at the heresies of
the Lollards, and marveled at the in- solence of peasants who, once
content with beer and com, now demanded meat and milk and cheese. Three
things, said Gower, are merciless when they get out of hand: water,
fire, and the mob. Disgusted with this world, worried about the next,
“moral Gower” retired in old age to a priory, and spent his closing year
in blindness and prayer. His contemporaries admired his morals,
regretted his temper and his style, and turned with relief to
Chaucer.</p>
<p>V. GEOFFREY CHAUCER: 134O-I4OO</p>
<p>He was a man full of the blood and beer of Merrie England, capable of
taking in his stride the natural difficulties of life, drawing their
sting with a</p>
<p>48 THE REFORMATION (CHAP.n</p>
<p>forgiving humor, and picturing all phases of the English scene with a
brush as broad as Homer’s, a spirit as lusty as Rabelais’.</p>
<p>His name, like so much of his language, was of French origin; it
meant shoemaker, and probably was pronounced shosayr; posterity plays
tricks with our very names, and remembers us only to remake us to its
whim. He was the son of John Chaucer, a London vintner. He won a good
education from both books and life; his poetry abounds in knowledge of
men and women, literature and history. In 1357 “Geoffret Chaucer” was
officially listed in the service of the household of the future Duke of
Clarence. Two years later he was off to the wars in France; he was
captured, but was freed for a ransom, to which Edward III contributed.
In 1367 we find him a “yeo - man of the King’s Chamber,” with a life
pension of twenty marks ($ 1,333?) a year. Edward traveled much with his
household at his heels; presumably Chaucer accompanied him, savoring
England as he went. In 1 3 66 he married Philippa, a lady serving the
Queen, and lived with her in moderate discord till her death. 70 Richard
II continued the pension, and John of Gaunt added ten pounds (,000?)
annually. There were other aristocratic gifts, which may explain why
Chaucer, who saw so much of life, took little notice of the Great
Revolt.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant custom of those days, which admired poetry and elo-
quence, to send men of letters on diplomatic missions abroad. So Chaucer
was deputed with two others to negotiate a trade agreement at Genoa
(1372); and in 1378 he went with Sir Edward Berkeley to Milan. Who knows
but he may have met ailing Boccaccio, aging Petrarch? In any case, Italy
was a transforming revelation to him. He saw there a culture far more
polished, lettered, and subtle than England’s; he learned a new
reverence for the classics, at least the Latin; the French influence
that had molded his early poems yielded now to Italian ideas, verse
forms, and themes. When finally he turned to his own land for his scenes
and characters, he was an accomplished artist and a mature mind.</p>
<p>No man could then live in England by writing poetry. We might have
supposed that Chaucer’s pensions would keep him adequately housed, fed,
and clad; after 1378 they totaled some 0,000 in the money of our time;
besides, his wife enjoyed her own pensions from John of Gaunt and the
King. In any case, Chaucer felt a need to supplement his income by
taking various governmental posts. For twelve years (1374- 86) he served
as “con - troller of the customs and subsidie s,” and during that time
he occupied lodg - ings over the Aldgate tower. In 1380 he paid an
unstated sum to Cecilia Chaumpaigne for withdrawing her suit against him
for rape. 71 Five years later he was appointed justice of the peace for
Kent; and in 1 386 he had him- self elected to Parliament. It was in the
intervals of these labors that he wrote his poetry.</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 49</p>
<p>He describes himself, in The House of Fame, as hurrying home after he
had “made his reckonings,” and losing himself in his books, sitting
“dumb as a stone,” and living like a hermit in all but poverty,
chastity, and obedience, and setting his “wit to make books, songs, and
ditties in rime.” In his youth, he tells us, he had written “many a song
and lecherous lay.” 72 He translated Boethius’ De consolatione
philosophiae (The Consolation of Philosophy) into good prose, and part
of Guillaume de Lorris’ Romaunt de la rose into excellent verse. He
began a number of what may be called major minor poems: The House of
Fame, The Book of the Duchess, The Parliament of Fowls, and The Legend
of Good Women; he anticipated us in being unable to finish them. They
were ambitious yet timid tentatives, frank imitations, in theme and
form, of Continental origins.</p>
<p>In his finest single poem, Troilus and Criseyde, he continued to
imitate, even to translate; but to 2,730 lines that he lifted from
Boccaccio’s Filostrato</p>
<p>Despite all discounts, Chaucer’s Troilus is the first great narrative
poem in English. Scott called it “long and somewhat dull,” which it is;
Rossetti called it “perhaps the most beautiful narrative poem of
considerable length in the English language”; 78 and this too is true.
All long poems, however beautiful, become dull; passion is of poetry’s
essence, and a passion that runs to 8, 386 lines becomes prose almost as
rapidly as desire consummated. Never were so many lines required to
bring a lady to bed, and seldom has love hesitated, meditated,
procrastinated, and capitulated with such magnificent and ir- relevant
rhetoric, and melodious conceits, and facile felicity of rhyme. Only
Richardson’s Mississippi of prose could rival this Nile of verse in the
leisurely psychology of love. Yet even the heavy- winged oratory, the
infinite wordi- ness, the obstructive erudition obstinately displayed,
fail to destroy the poem. It is, after all, a philosophic tale — of how
woman is designed for love, and will soon love B if A stays too long
away. It has one character livingly portrayed: Pandarus, who in the
Iliad is the leader of the Lycian army in Troy, but here becomes the
exuberant, resourceful, undiscourageable go-be- tween to guide the
lovers to their sin; and thereby hangs a word. Troilus is a warrior
absorbed in repelling the Greeks, and scornful of men who, dallying on
soft bosoms, become the thralls of appetite. He falls deliriously in
love with Criseyde at first sight, and thereafter thinks of nothing else
but her beauty, modesty, gentleness, and grace. Criseyde, after waiting
anxiously</p>
<p>50 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. H</p>
<p>hrough 6,000 lines for this timid soldier to announce his love, falls
with relief into his arms, and Troilus forgets two worlds at once:</p>
<p>All other dredes weren from him fledde,</p>
<p>Both of the siege and his salvacioun. 74</p>
<p>Having exhausted himself in achieving this ecstasy, Chaucer hurries
over the bliss of the lovers to the tragedy that rescues it from
boredom. Criseyde’s father having deserted to the Greeks, she is sent to
them by the angry Tro- jans in exchange for the captured Antenor. The
brokenhearted lovers part with vows of everlasting fidelity. Arrived
among the Greeks, Criseyde is awarded to Diomedes, whose handsome
virility so captivates his captive that — qual plum? in vento — she
surrenders in a page what before had been hoarded through a book.
Perceiving which, Troilus plunges into battle seek- ing Diomedes, and
finds death on Achilles’ spear. Chaucer ended his amorous epic with a
pious prayer to the Trinity, and sent it, conscience-stricken, to “moral
Gower, to correct of your benignitee.”</p>
<p>Probably in 1387 he began The Canterbury Tales. It was a
brilliant</p>
<p>scheme — to join a varied group of Britons at the Tabard Inn in
Southwark</p>
<p>Who will protest at quoting once more those spring-fresh opening
lines?</p>

<p>CHAP.Il) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT</p>
<p>With him</p>
<p>… rood a gentil Pardoner…</p>
<p>His wallet lay bifom him in his lappe,</p>
<p>Bret [brim] ful of pardouns come from Rome al hoot [hot].</p>
<p>And there was a Merchant, and a Man of Laws, a “Frankeleyn” or free -
holder, a Carpenter, a Weaver, a Dyer, a “T; apier” or upholsterer, a
Cook, and a Shipman. And there was Geoffrey Chaucer himself, standing
shyly aside, “large” (fat) and difficult to embrace, and “looking
forever upon the ground as if to find a hare.” And not least was mine
host, owner of the Tabard Inn, who vows he has never entertained so
merry a company; indeed, he offers to go with them and be their guide;
and he suggests — to pass the fifty-six miles away — that each of the
pilgrims shall tell two tales going and two on the return, and that he
who tells the best “shal have a super at our aller cost”</p>
<p>Who would believe that so romantic a pen could turn in a line from
this chivalric fustian to the scatophilic obscenity of the Miller’s
Tale? But the Miller has been drinking, and foresees that his mind and
tongue will slip to their wonted plane; Chaucer apologizes for him and
himself — he must report matters honestly — and he invites the chaste
reader to skip to some story “that toucheth gentillesse… moralitee, and
holinesse.” The Prioress’s Tale begins on a sweetly religious note, then
recounts the bitter legend of a Chris- tian boy supposedly slain by a
Jew, and how the provost of the town duti- fully arrested its Jews and
tortured a number of them to death. From such piety Chaucer passes, in
the prologue to the Pardoner’s Tale, to a sharp satire on
relic-mongering peddlers of indulgences; this theme will be centuries
old when Luther trumpets it to the world. Then, in the prologue to the
Wife of Bath’s Tale, our poet reaches the nadir of his morals and the
zenith of his power. It is a riotous protest against virginity and
celibacy, put into the bawdy mouth of an expert on matrimony, a woman
who has had five hus- bands since she was twelve years of age, has
buried four of them, and looks forward to a sixth to assuage her
youth:</p>
<p>God bad us for to waxe and multiplye…</p>
<p>But of no nombre mencioun made he,</p>
<p>Of bigamy or of octogamye;</p>
<p>Why sholde men speke of it vilainye?</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. H</p>
<p>As, wolde God, it leveful were to me</p>
<p>To be refresshed half so ofte as he!…</p>
<p>Alas, alas, that ever love was synne!</p>
<p>We shall not quote her physiological confessions, nor their masculine
coun- terpart in the Somnour’s Tale, wherein Chaucer stoops to study the
anatomy of flatulence. The air is cleared when we come to the fable of
the ever obe- dient Griselda in the Oxford Cleric’s Tale; neither
Boccaccio nor Petrarch</p>
<p>Of the fifty-eight stories promised in the Prologue Chaucer gives us
only twenty-three; perhaps he felt, with the reader, that 500 pages were
enough, and that the well of his inventiveness had run dry. Even in this
bubbling stream there are muddy passages, which the judicious eye will
overleap. Nevertheless, the slow, deep current carries us buoyantly
along and gives forth an air of freshness as if the poet had lived along
green banks rather than over a London gate^-though there, too, the
Thames was not far to seek. Some of the paeans to outdoor beauty are
stereotyped literary exercises, yet the moving picture comes alive with
such naturalness and directness of feel- ing and speech, such revealing
firsthand observation of men and manners, as rarely may be found between
the covers of one book; and such a cornu- copia of images, similes, and
metaphors as only Shakespeare would again provide. (The Pardoner “mounts
the pulpit, nods east and west upon the congregation like a dove on a
bam gable.”) The East Midland dialect that Chaucer used became through
him the literary language of England: a vo- cabulary already rich enough
to express all graces and subtleties of thought. Now for the first time
the speech of the English people became the vehicle of great literary
art.</p>
<p>The material, as in Shakespeare, is mostly secondhand. Chaucer took
his stories anywhere: the Knight’s Tale from Boccaccio’s Teseide,
Griselda from the Decameron , and a dozen from the French fabliaux. The
last source may explain some of Chaucer’s obscenity; however, the most
fetid of his tales has no known source but himself. Doubtless he held,
with the Eliza- bethan dramatists, that the groundlings must be given a
bawdy sop now and then to keep them awake; he made his men and women
talk as matched their rank and way of life; besides, he repeats, they
had drunk much cheap ale. For the most part his humor is healthy — the
hearty, lusty, full-bodied humor of well-fed Englishmen before the
Puritan desiccation, marvelously mixed with the sly subtlety of modem
British wit.</p>
<p>Chaucer knew the faults, sins, crimes, follies, and vanities of
mankind, but he loved life despite them, and could put up with anybody
who did not sell buncombe too dearly. He seldom denounces; he merely
describes. He satirizes the women of the lower middle classes in the
Wife of Bath, but he</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) WYCLIF, CHAUCER, AND THE REVOLT 55</p>
<p>relishes her biological exuberance. He is ungallantly severe on
women; his mordant quips and slurs reveal the wounded husband revenging
with his pen the nightly defeats of his tongue. Yet he speaks tenderly
of love, reckons no other boon so rich, 75 and fills a gallery with
portraits of good women. He rejects the gentility that rested on birth,
and calls only him “gentil that doth gentil deeds.” But he distrusts the
fickleness of the commons, and counts any man a fool who hitches his
fortunes to popularity or mingles with a mob.</p>
<p>He was largely free from the superstitions of his time. He exposed
the impostures of alchemists, and though some of his storytellers bring
in as- trology, he himself rejected it. He wrote for his son a treatise
on the astrolabe, showing a good grasp of current astronomic lore. He
was not a very learned man, for he liked to display his learning; he
swells his pages with large patches of Boethius, and makes even the Wife
of Bath quote Seneca. He mentions some problems of philosophy and
theology, but shrugs his shoulders at them helplessly. Perhaps he felt,
like any man of the world, that a prudent philos- opher will not wear
his metaphysics on his sleeve.</p>
<p>Was he a believing Christian? Nothing could exceed the ruthlessness
and coarseness of his satire on the friars in the prologue and body of
the Som- nour’s Tale; such darts, however, had more than once been aimed
at the brothers by men of orthodox piety. Here and there he raises a
doubt of some religious dogma: no more than Luther could he harmonize
divine foreknowl- edge with man’s free will; 76 he makes Troilus expound
determinism, but in an epilogue he rejects it. He affirms his belief in
heaven and hell, but notes at some length that those are bournes from
which no attesting traveler re- turns. 77 He is disturbed by evils
apparently irreconcilable with an omnipotent benevolence, and makes
Arcite question the justice of the gods with re- proaches as bold as
Omar Khayyam’s:</p>
<p>O cruel goddes, that goveme</p>
<p>This world with binding of your word eteme,</p>
<p>And wryten in the table of athamaunt [ adamant 1</p>
<p>Your parlement, and your eteme graunt,</p>
<p>What is mankind more un-to yow holde [your estimation]</p>
<p>Than is the sheep that rouketh [huddles] in the folde?</p>

<p>And dwelleth eke in prison and areste.</p>
<p>And hath sicknesse, and great adversitee,</p>
<p>And ofte tymes giltiless, pardee!</p>
<p>What governaunce is in this prescience,</p>
<p>That giltinesse tormenteth innocence?…</p>
<p>And when a beest is dead he hath no peyne.</p>
<p>But man, after his death, must weep and ple yne.. •</p>
<p>Th’answcre of this I lete to divynis [divines]. 78</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>5&lt;S</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>In later years he tried to recapture the piety of his youth. To the
unfinished Canterbury Tales he appended a “Preces de Chaucer.” or Prayer
of Chaucer, begging forgiveness from God and man for his obscenities and
worldly vani- ties, and proposing “unto my lyves ende… to biwayle my
giltes, and to study to the salvacioun of my s oule.”</p>
<p>In those last years his joy in life yielded to the melancholy of a
man who in the decay of health and sense recalls the carefree lustiness
of youth. In 1381 he was appointed by Richard II “Clerk of our Works at
our Palace of West - minster” and other royal residences. Ten years
later, though he was little more than fifty, his health seems to have
broken down; in any case, his tasks proved too much for his strength,
and he was relieved of his office. We do not find him in any later
employment. His finances failed, and he was re- duced to asking the King
for six shillings eight pence. 79 In 1394 Richard granted him a pension
of twenty pounds a year for life. It was not enough; he asked the King
for a yearly hogshead of wine, and received it ( 1398); and when, in
that year, he was sued for a debt of fourteen pounds he could not pay
it. 80 He died on October 2 5, 1400, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey, the first and greatest of the many poets who there again bear the
beat of measured feet.*</p>

<p>’Tor God’s sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of
the death</p>
<p>“Richard II,” says Holinshed, “was seemely of shape and favour, and
of nature good enough, if the wickednesse and naughtie demeanour of such
as were about him had not altered it…. He was prodigal, ambitious, and
much given to pleasure of the bodie.” 82 He loved books, and helped
Chaucer and Froissart. He had shown courage, presence of mind, and
judicious action in the Great Revolt; but after that enervating crisis
he lapsed into enervating luxury and left the government to wasteful
ministers. Against these men a powerful opposition formed, led by
Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, Richard, Earl of Arundel, and Henry
Bolingbroke, grandson of Edward III. This faction dominated the
“Merciless Parliament” of 1388, which impeached and hanged ten of
Richard’s aides. In 1390 the King, still a youth of twenty - three, took
active charge, and for seven years he governed constitutionally — i.e.,
in harmony with the laws, traditions, and chosen representatives of
the</p>
<p>The death of Richard’s Bohemian Queen Anne ( 1 394) deprived him of a
wholesome and moderating influence. In 1396 he married Isabelle, daugh-

at his death a tenant of Abbey property.</p>

<p>er of Charles VI, in the hope of cementing peace with France; but as
she was a child of only seven years, he spent his substance on male and
female favorites. The new Queen brought a French retinue to London, and
these brought French manners, perhaps French theories of absolute
monarchy. When the Parliament of 1397 sent Richard a bill of complaint
against the extravagance of his court, he replied haughtily that such
matters were out- side the jurisdiction of Parliament. He demanded the
name of the member who had proposed the complaint; Parliament, cowed,
condemned the pro- ponent to death; Richard pardoned him.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter Gloucester and Arundel suddenly left London.
Suspecting a plot to depose him, the King ordered their arrest. Arundel
was beheaded, Gloucester was smothered to death (1397). In 1399 John of
Gaunt died, leaving a rich estate; Richard, needing funds for an
expedition to Ireland, confiscated the Duke’s property, to the horror of
the aristocracy. While the King was restoring peace in Ireland, Gaunt’s
exiled son a nd disinherited heir, Henry Bolingbroke, landed in York
with a small army that rapidly grew, as powerful nobles joined his
cause. On returning to England, Richard found his reduced forces so
outnumbered, friends falling away from him in panic, that he surrendered
his person and throne to Bolingbroke, who was crowned as Henry IV ( 1
399). So ended the Plantagenet dynasty that had begun with Henry II in 1
1 54; so began the Lancastrian dynasty that would end with Henry VI in
1461. Richard II died in prison at Pontefract (1400), aged thirty-three,
perhaps from the winter rigor of his confinement, possibly slain, as
Holinshed and Shakespeare thought, by servants of the new King.</p>
