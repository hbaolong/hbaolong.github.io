<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>Pericles and the Democratic</p>
<p>Experiment</p>
<p>I. THE RISE OF ATHENS</p>
<p>**^Tr’HE period which intervened between the birth of Pericles and
the</p>
<p>A death of Aristotle,” wrote Shelley,* “is undoubtedly, whether con -
sidered in itself or with reference to the effect which it has produced
upon the subsequent destinies of civilized man, the most memorable in
the history of the world.” Athens dominated this period because she had
won the allegiance — and the contributions — of most Aegean cities by
her leadership in saving Greece; and because, when the war was over,
Ionia was impov- erished and Sparta was disordered by demobilization,
earthquake, and in- surrection, while the fleet that Themistocles had
created now rivaled with the conquests of commerce its victories at
Artemisium and Salamis.</p>
<p>Not that the war was quite over: intermittently the struggle between
Greece and Persia continued from the conquest of Ionia by Cyrus to the
overthrow of Darius III by Alexander. The Persians were expelled from
Ionia in 479, from the Black Sea in 478, from Thrace in 475; and in 468
a Greek fleet under Cimon of Athens decisively defeated the Persians on
land and sea at the mouth of the Eurymedon.* The Greek cities of Asia
and the Aegean, for their protection against Persia, now (477) organized
under Athenian leadership the Delian Confederacy, and contributed to a
common fund in the temple of Apollo on Delos. Since Athens donated ships
instead of money, it soon exercised, through its sea power, an effective
control over its allies; and rapidly the Confederacy of equals was
trans- formed into an Athenian Empire.</p>
<p>In this policy of imperial aggrandizement all the major statesmen of
Athens — even die virtuous Aristides and later the impeccable Pericles-
joined with the unscrupulous Themistocles. No other man had deserved so
well of Athens as Themistocles, and no one was more resolved fhan he to
be repaid for it. When the Greek leaders met to give first and
second</p>

</ul>
<p>*45</p>
<p>246 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>awards to those men who had most ably defended Greece in the war,
each of them voted for himself first, and for Themistocles second. It
was he who set the course of Greek history by persuading Athens that the
road to supremacy lay not on land but on the sea, and not by war so much
as by trade. He negotiated with Persia, and sought to end the strife
between the old and the young empire in order that unimpeded commerce
with Asia might bring prosperity to Athens. Under his prodding the men,
even the women and children, of Athens raised a waU around the city, and
another around the ports at the Piraeus and Munychia; under his lead,
carried for- ward by Pericles, great quays, warehouses, and exchanges
were erected at the Piraeus, providing every convenience for maritime
trade. He knew that these policies would arouse the jealousy of Sparta,
and might lead to war between the rival states; but he was stirred on by
his vi sion of Athens’ development, and his confidence in the Athenian
fleet.</p>
<p>His aims were as magnificent as his means were venal. He used the
navy to force tribute from the Cyclades, on the ground that they had
yielded too quickly to the Persians, and had lent Xerxes their troops;
and he appears to have accepted bribes to let some cities off.’ For like
considerations he arranged the recall of exiles, sometimes keeping the
money, says Timocreon, though he had failed to obtain the recall.’ When
Aristides w as placed in charge of the public revenue he found that his
predecessors had embezzled public funds, and not least lavishly
Themistocles.* Toward 47 1 the Athe- nians, fearing his unmoral
intellect, passed a vote of ostracism upon him, and he sought a new home
in Argos. Shortly thereafter the Spartans found documents apparently
implicating Themistocles, in the secret correspond- ence of their regent
Pausanias, whom they had starved to death for enter- ing into traitorous
negotiations with Persia. Happy to destroy her ablest enemy, Sparta
revealed these papers to Athens, which at once sent out an order for
Themistocles’ arrest. He fled to Corcyra, was denied refuge there, found
brief asylum in Epirus, and thence sailed secretly to Asia, where he cl
aimed from Xerxes’ successor some reward for restraining the Greek
pursuit of the Persian fleet after Salamis. Lured by Themistocles’
promise to help him subjugate Greece,’ Artaxerxes I received him into
his counsels, and assigned the revenues of several cities for his
maintenance. Before Themistocles could carry out the schemes that never
let him rest he died at Magnesia in 449 b.c., at the age of sixty-five,
admired and disliked by all the Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>After the passing of Themistocles and Aristides the leadership of the
democratic faction at Athens descended to Ephialtes, and that of the
oli-</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 247</p>
<p>garchic or conservative faction to Cimon, son of Miltiades. Cimon had
most of the virtues that Themistocles lacked, but none of the subtlety
that abil- ity must depend upon for political success. Unhappy amid the
intrigues of the city, he secured command of the fleet, and consolidated
the liberties of Greece by his victory at the Eurymedon. Returning to
Athens in glory, he at once lost his popularity by advising a
reconciliation with Sparta. He won the Assembly’s reluctant consent to
lead an Athenian force to the aid of the Spartans against their revolted
Helots at Ithome; but the Spartans suspected the Athenians even when
bringing gifts, and so clearly distrusted Cimon’s soldiers that these
returned to Athens in anger, and Cimon was disgraced. In 461 he was
ostracized at the instigation of Pericles, and the oligarchic party was
so demoralized by his fall that for two generations the government
remained in the hands of the democrats. Four years later Pericles,
repentant (or, rumor said, enamored of Cimon’s sister Elpinice), secured
his recall, and Cimon died with honors in a naval campaign in
Cyprus.</p>
<p>Tlie leader of the democratic party at this time was a man of whom we
know strangely little, and yet his activity was a turning point in the
his- tory of Athens. Ephialtes was poor but incorruptible, and did not
long survive the animosities of Athenian politics. The popular faction
had been strengthened by the war, for in that crisis all class divisions
among freemen had for a moment been forgotten, and the saving victory at
Salamis had been won not by the army — which was dominated by the
aristocrats — but by the navy, which was manned by the poorer citizens
and controlled by the mercantile middle class. The oligarchic party
sought to maintain its privileges by making the conservative Areopagus
the supreme authority in the state. Ephialtes replied by a bitter attack
upon tWs ancient senate.* He impeached several of its members for
malfeasance, had some of them put to death,’ and persuaded the Assembly
to vote the almost complete abolition of the powers that the Areopagus
still retained. The conservative Aristotle later approved this radical
pohcy, on the ground that “the trans - fer to the commons of the
judicial functions that had belonged to the Senate appears to have been
an advantage, for corruption finds an easiei</p>
<p>• Grote’s statement, written about 1850, of the case against the
Areopagus recalls certain</p>

<p>248</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>material in a small number than in a large one.’” But the conser
vatives of the time did not see the issue so calmly. Ephialtes, having
been found unpurchasable, was assassinated in 461 by an agent of the
oUgarchy,* and the perilous task of leading the democratic party passed
down to the aris- tocratic Pericles.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>PERICLES</li>
</ol>
<p>A</p>
<p>The man who acted as commander in chief of all the physical and spir-
itual forces of Athens during her greatest age was bom some three years
before Marathon. His father, Xanthippus, had fought at Salamis, had led
the Athenian fleet in the battle of Mycale, and had recaptured the
Helles- pont for Greece. Pericles’ mother, Agariste, was a granddaughter
of the</p>
<p>Seeing that the oligarchic party was out of step with the time, he
at- tached himself early in life to the party of the demos — i.e., the
free popu- lation of Athens; then, as even in Jefferson’s day in
America, the word “people” carried certain proprietary reservations. He
approached politics in general, and each situation in it, with careful
preparation, neglecting no aspect of education, speaking seldom and
briefly, and praying to the gods that he might never utter a word that
was not to the point. Even the comic poets, who disliked him, spoke of
him as “the Olympian,” who wielded the thunder and lightning of such
eloquence as Athens had never heard before; and yet by all accounts his
speech was unimpassioned, and ap- pealed to enlightened minds. His
influence was due not only to his intelli- gence but to his probity; he
was capable of using bribery to secure state ends, but was himself
“manifestly free from every kind of corruption, an d</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT *49</p>
<p>superior to all considerations of money” and whereas Themistocles had
entered public office poor and left it rich, Pericles, we are told,
added noth- ing to his patrimony by his political career “ It showed the
good sense of the Athenians in this generation that for almost thirty
years, between 467 and 428, they elected and re-elected him, with brief
intermissions, as one of their ten strategoi or commanders; and this
relative permanence of office not only gave him supremacy on the
military board, but enabled him to raise the position of strategos
autokrator to the place of highest influence in the government. Under
him Athens, while enjoying all the privileges of democracy, acquired
also the advantages of aristocracy and dictatorship. The good government
and cultural patronage that had adorned Athens in the age of
Peisistratus were continued now with equal unity and decisive- ness of
direction and intelligence, but also with the full and annually re-
newed consent of a free citizenship. History through him illustrated
again the principle that liberal reforms are most ably executed and most
perma- nently secured by the cautious and moderate leadership of an
aristocrat enjoying popular support. Greek civilization was at its best
when democ- racy had grown sufficiently to give it variety and vigor,
and aristocracy survived sufficiently to give it order and taste.</p>
<p>The reforms of Pericles substantially extended the authority of the
peo- ple. Though the power of the heliaea had grown under Solon,
Cleisthenes, and Ephialtes, the lack of payment for jury service had
given the well to do a predominating influence in these courts. Pericles
introduced (451) a fee of two obols (34 cents), la ter raised to three,
for a day’s duty as juror, an amount equivalent in each case to half a
day’s earnings of an aveiiage Athenian of the time.” The notion that
these modest sums weakened the fiber and corrupted the morale of Athens
is hardly to be taken seriously, for by the same token every state that
pays its judges or its jurymen would long since have been destroyed.
Pericles seems also to have established a small remuneration for
military service. He crowned this scandalous generosity by persuading
the state to pay every citizen two obols annu- ally as the price of
admission to the plays and games of the official festivals; he excused
himself on the ground that these performances should not be a luxury of
the upper and middle classes, but should contribute to elevate the mind
of the whole electorate. It must be confessed, however, that Plato,
Aristotle, and Plutarch — conservatives all — were agreed that these
pittances injured the Athenian character.“</p>
<p>Continuing the work of Ephialtes, Pericles transferred to the popular
courts the various judicial powers that had been possessed by the
archons</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>and magistrates, so that from this time the archonship was more of a
bureaucratic or administrative office than one that carried the power of
forming policies, deciding cases, or issuing commands. In 457
eligibility to the archonship, which had been confined to the wealthier
classes, was ex- tended to the third class, or zeu^tai; soon thereafter,
without any legal form, the lowest citizen class, the thetes, made
themselves eligible to the office by romancing about their income; and
the importance of the thetes in the defense of Athens persuaded the
other classes to wink at the fraud.” Moving for a moment in the opposite
direction, Pericles (451) carried through the Assembly a restriction of
the franchise to the legitimate off- spring of an Athenian father and an
Athenian mother. No legal marriage was to be permitted between a citizen
and a noncitizen. It was a measure aimed to discourage intermarriage
with foreigners, to reduce illegitimate births, and perhaps to reserve
to the jealous burghers of Athens the material rewards of citizenship
and empire. Pericles himself would soon have rea- son to regret this
exclusive legislation.</p>
<p>Since any form of government seems good that brings prosperity, and
even the best seems bad that hinders it, Pericles, having consolidated
his political position, turned to economic statesmanship. He sought to
reduce the pressure of population upon the narrow resources of Attica by
estab- lishing colonies of poor Athenian citizens upon foreign soil. To
give work to the idle,” he made the state an employer on a scale
unprecedented in Greece: ships were added to the fleet, arsenals were
built, and a great com exchange was erected at the Piraeus. To protect
Athens effectively from siege by land, and at the same time to provide
further work for the unemployed, Pericles persuaded the Assembly to
supply funds for con- structmg eight miles of “Long Walls,” as they were
to be called, connect - ing Athens with the Piraeus and Phalerum; the
effect was to make the city and its ports one fortified enclosure, open
in wartime only to the sea- on which the Athenian fleet was supreme. In
the hostility with which un- walled Sparta looked upon this program of
fortification the oligarchic party saw a chance to recapture political
power. Its secret agents invited the Spartans to invade Attica and, with
the aid of an oligarchic insurrection, to put down the democracy; in
this event the oligarchs pledged themselves to level the Long Walls. The
Spartans agreed, and dispatched an army which defeated the Athenians at
Tanagra (457); but the oligarchs failed to make their revolution. The
Spartans returned to the Peloponnesus emp- ty-handed, dourly awaiting a
better opportunity to overcome the flourish- ing rival that was taking
from them their traditional leadership of Greece.</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 2 rejected the
temptation to retaliate upon Sparta, and instead, devoted his energies
now to the beautification of Athens. Hoping to make his city the
cultural center of Hellas, and to rebuild the ancient shrines — which
the Persians had destroyed — on a scale and with a splendor that would
lift up the soul of every citizen, he devised a plan for using all the
genius of Athens’ artists, and the labor of her remaining unemployed, in
a bold program for the architectural adornment of the Acropolis . “It
was his desire and design,” says Plutarch, “that the undisciplined
mechanic multi - tude . . . should not go without their share of public
funds, and yet should not have these given them for sitting still and
doing nothing; and to this end he brou ght in these vast projects of
construction.”” To finance the</p>
<p>The transference of the Delian treasury to Athens was quite
acceptable to the Athenians, even to the oligarchs. But the voters were
loath ta spend any substantial part of the fund in adorning their city —
whether through some qualm of conscience, or through a secret hope that
the money might be appropriated more directly to their needs and
enjoyment. The oli- garchic leaders played upon this feeling so cleverly
that when the matter neared a vote in the Assembly the defeat of
Pericles’ plan seemed certain. Plutarch tells a delightful story of how
the subtle leader turned the tide. “ ‘Very well,’ said Pericles; ‘let
the cost of these build ings go not to your account but to mine; and let
the inscription upon them stand in my name.’ When they heard him say
this, whether it were out of a surprise to see the greatness of his
spirit, or out of emulation of the glory of the works, they cried aloud,
bidding him spend on . . , and spare no cost till all were
finished.”</p>
<p>While the work proceeded, and Pericles’ especial protection and sup -
port were given to Pheidias, Ictinus, Mnesicles, and the other artists
who labored to realize his dreams, he lent his patronage also to
literature and philosophy; and whereas in the other Greek cities of this
period the strife of parties consumed much of the energy of the
citizens, and literature languished, in Athens the stimulus of growing
wealth and democratic free- dom was combined with wise and cultured
leadership to produce the Golden Age. When Pericles, Aspasia, Pheidias,
Anaxagoras, and Socrates attended a play by Euripides in the Theater of
Dionysus, Athens could see visibly</p>
<p>252 the life of GREECE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>the zenith and unity of the life of Greece — statesmanship, art,
science, philosophy, literature, religion, and morals living no separate
career as in the pages of chroniclers, but woven into one many-colored
fabric of a nation’s histo ry.</p>
<p>The affections of Pericles wavered between art and philosophy, and he
might have found it hard to say whether he loved Pheidias or Anaxagoras
the more; perhaps he turned to Aspasia as a compromise between beauty
and wisdom. For Anaxagoras he enter tained, we are told, “an extraor -
dinary esteem and admiration.’”® It was the philosopher, says Plato,”
who deepened Pericles into statesmanship; from long intercourse with
Anaxag- oras, Plutarch believes, Pericles derived “not merely elevation
of purpo se and dignity of language, raised far above the base and
dishonest buffoon- eries of mob eloquence, but, besides this, a
composure of countenance, and a serenity and calmness in all his
movements, which no occurrence whilst he was speaking could distu rb.”
When Anaxagoras was old, and Pericles was absorbed in public affairs,
the statesman for a time let the philosopher drop out of his life; but
later, hearing that Anaxagoras was starving, Pericles hastened to his
relief, and accepted humbly his rebuk e, that “those who have occasion
for a lamp supply it with oil.””</p>
<p>It seems hardly credible, and yet on second thought most natural,
that the stem “Olympian” should have been keenly susceptible to the
charms of woman; his self-control fought against a delicate sensibility,
and the toils of office must have heightened in him the normal male
longing for feminine tenderness. He had been many years married when he
met Aspasia. She belonged to — she was helping to create — the type of
hetaira that was about to play so active a part in Athenian life; a
woman rejecting the seclusion that marriage brought to the ladies of
Athens, and preferring to live in unlicensed unions, even in relative
promiscuity, if thereby she might enjoy the same freedom of movement and
conduct as men, and par- ticipate with them in their cultural interests.
We have no testimony to Aspasia’s beauty, though ancient writers speak
of her “small, high -arched foot,” “her silvery voice,” and her golden
hair.” Aristophanes, an unscrapu - lous political enemy of Pericles,
describes her as a Milesian courtesan who had established a luxurious
brothel at Megara, and had now imported some of her girls into Athens;
and the great comedian delicately suggests that the quarrel of Athens
with Megara, which precipitated the Peloponnesian War, was brought about
because Aspasia persuaded Pericles to revenge her upon Megarians who had
kidnaped some of her personnel.” But Axis -</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 253</p>
<p>tophanes was not an historian, and may be trusted only where he
himself is not concerned.</p>
<p>Arriving in Athens about 450, Aspasia opened a school of rhetoric and
philosophy, and boldly encouraged the public emergence and higher edu-
cation of women. Many girls of good family came to her classes, and some
husbands brought their wives to study with her.” Men also attended her
lectures, among them Pericles and Socrates, and probably Anaxagoras,
Euripides, Alcibiades, and Pheidias. Socrates said that he had learned
from her the art of eloquence,“ and some ancient gossips would have it
that the statesman inherited her from the philosopher.” Pericles now
found it admirable that his wife had formed an affection for another
man. He of- fered her her freedom in return for his own, and she agreed;
she took a third husband,” while Pericles brought Aspasia home. By his
own law of 45 1 he could not make her his wife, since she was of
Milesian birth; any child he might have by her would be illegitimate,
and ineligible to Athenian citizenship. He seems to have loved her
sincerely, even uxoiiously, never leaving his home or returning to it
without kissing her, and finally willing his fortune to the son that she
bore him. From that time onward he fore- went all social life outside
his home, seldom going anywhere except to the agora or the council hall;
the people of Athens began to complain of his aloofness. For her part
Aspasia made his home a French Enlightenment salon, where the art and
science, the literature, philosophy, and statesman- ship of Athens were
brought together in mutual stimulation. Socrates mar- veled at her
eloquence, and credited her with composing the funeral ora- tion that
Pericles delivered after the first casualties of the Peloponnesian War.”
Aspasia became the uncrowned queen of Athens, setting fashion’s tone,
and giving to the women of the city an exciting example of mental and
moral freedom.</p>
<p>The conservatives were shocked at all this, and turned it to their
pur- poses. They denounced Pericles for leading Greeks out to war
against Greeks, as in Aegina and Samos; they accused him of squandering
public funds; -finally, through the mouths of irresponsible comic
dramatists abus- ing the free speech that prevailed under his rule, they
charged him with turning his home into a house of ill fame, and having
relations with the wife of his son.” Not daring to bring any of these
matters to open trial, they attacked him through his friends. They
indicted Pheidias for em- bezzling, as they alleged, some of the gold
assigned to him for his chrysele- phantine Athena, and apparently
succeeded in convicting him; they in-</p>

<p>dieted Anaxagoras on the ground of irreligion, and the philosopher,
on Pericles’ adv ice, fled into exile; they brought against Aspasia a
like writ of impiety (graphe asebeias), complaining that she had shown
disrespect for the gods of Greece.® The comic poets satirized her
mercilessly as a Deianeira who had ruined Pericles,* and called her, in
plain Greek, a concu- bine; one of them, Hermippus, doubtless in turn a
dishonest penny, ac- cused her of serving as Pericles’ procuress, and of
bringing freeborn women to him for his pleasure.® At her trial, which
took place before a court of fifteen himdred jurors, Pericles spoke in
her defense, using all his elo- quence, even to tears; and the case was
dismissed. From that moment (432) Pericles began to lose his hold upon
the Athenian people; and when, three years later, death came to him, he
was already a broken man.</p>
<p>ra. ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Deliberation</li>
</ol>
<p>These strange indictments suffice to show how real was the limited
de- mocracy that functioned under the supposed dictatorship of Pericles.
We must study this democracy carefully, for it is one of the outstanding
experi- ments in the history of government. It is limited, first, by the
fact that only a small minority of the people can read. It is limited
physically by the difiiculty of reaching Athens from the remoter towns
of Attica. The</p>
<p>franchise is restricted to those sons, of two free Athenian parents,
who have reached the age of twenty-one; and only they and their families
enjoy civil rights, or directly bear the military and fiscal burdens
of</p>
<p>the state. Within this jealously circumscribed circle of 43,000
citizens out of an Attic population of 315,000, political power, in the
days of Pericles, is formally equal; each citizen enjoys and insists
upon isononna and equal rights at law and in the Aissembly. To the
Athenian a citi-</p>
<p>zen is a man who not only votes, but takes his turn, by lot and rote,
as mag- istrate or judge; he must be free, ready, and able to serve the
state at any time. No one who is subject to another, or who has to labor
in order to live, can have the time or the capacity for these services;
and therefore the manual worker seems to most Athenians unfit for
citizenship, though, with human inconsistency they admit the peasant
proprietor. All of the 1 15,000</p>

<li>Deianira, wife of Heracles, caused his death by presenting Kim with
a poisoned robe. Cf. Sophocles’ Trachinian Women.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 255</p>
<p>slaves of Attica, all women, nearly all workingmen, all of the 28,500
“met - ics” or resident aliens,* and consequen tly a great part of the
trading class, are excluded from the franchise.t</p>
<p>The voters are not gathered into parties, but are loosely divided
into fol- lowers of the oligarchic or the democratic factions according
as they oppose or favor the extension of the franchise, the dominance of
the Assembly, and the governmental succor of the poor at the expense of
the rich. The active members of each faction are organized into clubs
called heteureid, com- panionships. There are clubs of all kinds in
Periclean Athens — religious clubs, kinship clubs, military clubs,
workers’ clubs, actors’ clubs, political clubs, and clubs honestly
devoted to eating and drinking. The strongest of all are the oligarchic
clubs, whose members are sworn to mutual aid in politics and law, and
are bound by a common passionate hostility to those lower enfranchised
ranks that press upon the toes of the landed aristocracy and the moneyed
merchant class.” Against them stand the relatively demo - cratic party
of small businessmen, of citizens who have become wage work- ers, and of
those who man the merchant ships and the Athenian fleet; these groups
resent the luxuries and privileges of the rich, and raise up to leader-
ship in Athens such men as Cleon the tanner, Lysicles the sheep dealer,
Eucrates the tow seller, Cleophon the harp manufacturer, and Hyperbolus
the lampmaker. Pericles holds them off for a generation by a subtle mix-
ture of democracy and aristocracy; but when he dies they inherit the
gov- ernment and thoroughly enjoy its perquisites. From Solon to the
Roman conquest this bitter conflict of oligarchs and democrats is waged
with ora- tory, votes, ostracism, assassination, and civil war.</p>
<p>Every voter is of right a member of the basic governing body —
the</p>
<p>ekklesia, or Assembly; there is at this level no representative
government. Since transportation is difflcult over the hills of Attica,
only a fraction of the eligible members ever attend any one meeting;
there are rarely more than two or three thousand. Those citizens who
live in Athens or at the Piraeus come by a kind of geographical
determinism to dominate the As- sembly; in this way the democrats gain
ascendancy over the conservatives, who are for the most part scattered
among the farms and estates of Attica. The Assembly meets four times a
month, on important occasions in the agora, in the Theater of Dionysus,
or at the Piraeus, ordinarily in a semi- circular place called the Pnyx
on the slope of a hill west of the Areopagus;</p>
<p>• The Greek word, metoikoi, means “sharing the home.”</p>
<p>tThe figures are from Gomme, A. W., The Fopulation of Athens in the
Fifth and Fourth Centuries B.C., pp. 21, 26, 47. They are frankly
conjectural. The total figure includes the wives and minor children of

<p>256 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>in all these cases the members sit on benches under the open sky, and
the sitting begins at dawn. Each session opens with the sacrifice of a
pig to Zeus. It is usual to adjourn at once in case of a storm,
earthquake, or eclipse, for these are accounted signs of divine
disapproval. New legislation may be proposed only at the first session
of each month, and the member who offers it is held responsible for the
result of its adoption; if these are seriously evil another member may
within a year of the vote invoke upon him the ^aphe paranomon, or writ
of illegality, and have him fined, dis- franchised, or put to death;
this is Athens’ way of discouraging hasty legis - lation. By another
form of the same writ a new proposal may be checked by a demand that
before its enactment one of the courts shall pass upon its
constitutionality — i.e., its agreement with existing law.“ Again,
before considering a bill, the Assembly is required to submit it to the
Council of Five Hundred for preliminary examination, very much as a bill
in the American Congress, before d^cussion of it on the floor, is
referred to a committee presumed to have especial knowledge and
competence in the matter involved. The Council may not reject a proposal
outright; it may only report it, with or without a recommendation.</p>
<p>Ordinarily the presiding officer opens the Assembly by presenting
a</p>
<p>probouleuma, or reported bill. Those who wish to speak are heard in
the order of their age; but anyone may be disqualified from addressing
the Assembly if it can be shown that he is not a landowner, or is not
legally married, or has neglected his duties to his parents, or has
offended public morals, or has evaded a military obligation, or has
thrown away his shield in battle, or owes taxes or other money to the
state.® Only trained orators avail themselves of the right to speak, for
the Assembly is a difficult audi- ence. It laughs at mispronunciations,
protests aloud at digressions, expresses its approval with shouts,
whistling, and clapping of hands, and, if it strongly disapproves, makes
such a din that the speaker is compelled to leave the bema, or rostrum.®
Each speaker is allowed a given time, whose lapse is measured by a
clepsydra or water clock.® Voting is by a show of hands unless some
individual is directly and specially affected by the proposal, in which
case a secret ballot is taken. The vote may confirm, amend, or override
the Council’s report on a bill, and the decision of the Assembly is
final. Decrees for immediate action, as distinct from laws, may be en-
acted more expeditiously than new legislation; but such decrees may with
equal expedition be canceled, and do not enter into the body of Athenian
law.</p>
<p>Above the Assembly in dignity, inferior to it in power, is the boule,
or</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 257</p>
<p>Council. Originally an upper house, it has by the time of Pericles
been reduced in effect to a legislative committee of the ekklesia. Its
members are chosen by lot and rote from the register of the citizens,
fifty for each of the ten tribes; they serve for a year only, and
receive, in the fourth cen- tury, five obols per day. Since each
councilor is disqualified for re-election until all other eligible
citizens have had a chance to serve, every citizen, in the normal course
of events, sits on the boule for at least one term during his life. It
meets in the bouleuterion, or council hall, south of the agora, and its
ordinary sessions are public. Its functions are legislative, executive,
and consultative: it examines and reformulates the bills proposed to the
Assembly; it supervises the conduct and accounts of the religious and
ad- ministrative ojfficials of the city; it controls public finances,
enterprises, and buildings; it issues executive decrees when action is
called for and the As - sembly is not in session; and, subject to later
revision by the Assembly, it controls the foreign affairs of the
state.</p>
<p>To perform these varied tasks the Council divides itself into ten
prytanies, or committees, each of fifty members; and each prytany
presides over the Council and the Assembly for a month of thirty-six
days. Every morn- ing the presiding prytany chooses one of its members
to serve as chairman of itself and the Council for the day; this
position, the highest in the state, is therefore open by lot and turn to
any citizen; Athens has three hun- dred presidents every year. The lot
determines at the last moment which prytany, and which member of it,
shall preside over the Council during the month or the day; by this
device the corrupt Athenians hope to reduce the corruption of justice to
the lowest point attainable by human charac- ter. The acting prytany
prepares the agenda, convokes the Council, and formulates the
conclusions reached during the day. In this way, through Assembly,
Council, and prytany, the democracy of Athens carries out its
legislative functions. As for the Areopagus, its powers are in the fifth
century restricted to trying cases of arson, willful violence,
poisoning, or premeditated murder. Slowly the law of Greece has been
changed “from status to contract,” from the whim of one man, or the
edict of a narrow class, into the deliberate agreement of free
citizens.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Law</li>
</ol>
<p>The earliest Greeks appear to have conceived of law as sacred custom,
divinely sanctioned and revealed; themis* meant to them both these
customs and</p>
<p>• Le., what is laid down, from ti -themiy I place; cf. our doom in
its early sense of law, and the Russian dttma.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>a goddess who (like India’s Rita or China’s Tao or Tien) embodied the
moral order and harmony of the world. Law was a part of theology, and
the oldest Greek laws of property were mingled with liturgical
regulations in the ancient temple codes.*® Perhaps as old as such
religious law were the rules established by the decrees of tribal
chieftains or kings, which began as force and ended, in time, as
sanctities.</p>
<p>The second phase of Greek legal history was the collection and
co-ordination of these holy customs by lawgivers {thesmothetai) like
Zaleucus, Charondas, Draco, Solon; when such men put their new codes
into writing, the thesmoi^ or sacred usages, became nomoi^ or man-made
laws.* In these codes law freed itself from religion, and became
increasingly secular; the intention of the agent entered more fully into
judgment of the act; family liability was replaced by individual
responsibility, and private revenge gave way to statutory punishment by
the state.®’</p>
<p>The third step in Greek legal development was the accumulative growth
of a body of law. When a Periclean Greek speaks of the law of Athens he
means the codes of Draco and Solon, and the measures that have been
passed — and not repealed — by the Assembly or the Council. If a new law
contravenes an old one, the repeal of the latter is prerequisite; but
scrutiny is seldom complete, and two statutes are often found in
ludicrous contradiction. In periods of excep- tional legal confusion a
committee of nomothetaiy or law determiners, is chosen by lot from the
popular courts to decide which laws shall be retained; in such cases
advocates are appointed to defend the old laws against those who propose
to repeal them. Under the supervision of these nomothetai the laws of
Athens, phrased in simple and intelligible language, are cut upon stone
slabs in the King’s Porch; and thereafter no magistrate is allowed to
decide a case by an unwritten law.</p>
<p>Athenian law makes no distinction between a civil and a criminal
code, except that it reserves murder cases for the Areopagus, and in
civil suits leaves the complainant to enforce the court’s decree
himself, going to his aid only if he meets with resistance.*® Murder is
infrequent, for it is branded as a sacrUege as well as a crime, and the
dread of feud revenge remains if the law fails to act. Under certain
conditions direct retaliation is still tolerated in the fifth century;
when a husband finds his mother, wife, concubine, sister, or daughter in
illicit relations he is entitled to kill the male offender at once.®®
Whether a killing is intentional or not it has to be expiated as a
pollution of the city’s soil, and the rites of purification are
painfully rigid and complex. If the victim has granted pardon before
dying, no action can be brought against the killer.“ Beneath the</p>
<p>• In Periclean Athens the name thesmothetai was given to the six
minor archons who</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 259</p>
<p>Areopagus are three tribunals for homicide cases, according to the
class and origin of the victim, and according as the act was
intentional, or excusable, or not. A fourth tribunal holds court at
Phreattys on the coast, and tries those who, while exiled for
unpremeditated homicide, are now charged with another and premeditated
murder; being polluted by the first crime, they are not allowed to touch
Attic soil, and their defense is conducted from a boat near the
shore.</p>
<p>The law of property is uncompromisingly severe. Contracts are
rigorously enforced; all jurors are required to swear that they “will
not vote for an abolition of private debts, or for a distribution of the
lands or houses belong- ing to Athenians’’; and every year the head
archon, on taking office, has procla - mation made by a herald that
“what each possesses he shall remain possessor and absolute master
thereof.”“ The right of bequest is still narrow ly limited. Where there
are male children the old religious conception of property, as bound up
with a given family line and the care of ancestral spirits, demands that
the estate should automatically pass to the sons; the father owns the
property only in trust for the family dead, living, and to be born.
Whereas in Sparta (as in England) the patrimony is indivisible and goes
to the eldest son, in Athens (very much as in France) it is apportioned
among the male heirs, the oldest receiving a moderately larger share
than the others.^ As early as Hesiod we find the peasant limiting his
family in Gallic fashion, lest his estate be ruinously divided among
many sons.“ The husband’s property never descends to the widow; all that
remains to her is her dowr y. Wills are as complex in Pericles’ day as
in our own, and are couched in much the same terms as now.“ In this as
in other matters Greek legislation is the basis of that Roman law which
in turn has provided the legal foundations of Western society.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Justice</li>
</ol>
<p>Democracy reaches the judiciary last of all; and the greatest reform
ac- complished by Ephialtes and Pericles is the transfer of judicial
powers from the Areopagus and the archons to the heliaea. The
establishment of these popular courts gives to Athens what trial by jury
will win for modem Europe. The heliaea* is composed of six thousand
dicasts, or jurors, annu- ally drawn by lot from the register of the
citizens; these six thousand are distributed into ten dicasteries, or
panels, of approximately five hundred each, leaving a surplus for
vacancies and emergencies. Minor and local cases are settled by thirty
judges who periodically visit the demes or coun- ties of Attica. Since
no juror may serve more than a year at a time, and</p>
<p>• Str icdy, heliaea is the name of the place where the courts met,
and was so called (from hellos^ sun) because the sessions were held in
the open air.</p>
<p>26o the life of GREECE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>eligibility is determined by rotation, every citizen, in the average
of chance, becomes a juror every third year. He does not have to serve,
but the payment of two — later three — obols per day obtains an
attendance of two or three hundred jurors for each panel. Important
cases, like that of Socrates, may be tried before vast dicasteries of
twelve hundred men. To reduce corruption to a minimum, the panel before
which a case is to be tried is determined by lot at the last minute; and
as most trials last but a day we do not hear much of bribery in the
courts; even the Athenians find it difficult to bribe in a moment three
hundred men.</p>
<p>Despite expedition, the courts of Athens, like courts the world over,
are usu- ally behind their calendar, for the Athenians itch to litigate.
To cool this fever public arbitrators are chosen by lot from the roster
of citizens who have reached their sixtieth year; the parties to a
dispute submit their complaint and defense to one of these, again chosen
by lot at the last minute; and each party pays him a small fee. If he
fails to reconcile them he gives his judgment, solemnized by an oath.
Either party may then appeal to the courts, but these usually refuse to
hear minor cases that have not been submitted to arbitration. When a
case is accepted for trial the plea is entered or sworn to, the
witnesses make their depositions and swear to them, and all these
statements are presented to the court in written form. They are sealed
in a special box, and at a later date they are opened and examined, and
judgment is given, by a panel chosen by lot. There is no public
prosecutor; the government relies upon private citi- zens to accuse
before the courts anyone guilty of serious offenses against morals,
religion, or the state. Hence arises a class of “sycophants,” who make
such charges a regular practice, and develop their profession into an
art of black- mail; in the fourth century they earn a good lixdng by
bringing — or, better, threatening to bring — actions against rich men,
believing that a popular court will be loath to acquit those who can pay
substantial fines.* The expenses of the courts are mostly covered by
fines imposed upon convicted men. Plaintiffs who fail to substantiate
their charges are also fined; and if they receive less than a fifth of
the jurors’ votes they are subj ect to a lashing, or to a penalty of a
thousand drachmas ($ looo) . Each party in a trial usually acts as his
own lawyer, and has to make in person the first presentation of his
case. But as the com- plexity of procedure rises, and litigants detect
in the jurors a certain sensitivity to eloquence, the practice grows of
engaging a rhetor or orator, versed in the law, to support the complaint
or defense, or to prepare, in his client’s name and</p>
<p>• Crito, rich friend of Socrates, complained that it was di flScnlt
for one who wished to mind his own business to live at Athens. “For at
this very time,” he said, “there are people bring - ing actions against
me, not because they have suffered any wrongs from me, but because they
think that I would rather pay them a sum of money than have the trouble
of law proceed- ings.”“</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 26l</p>
<p>character, a speech that the client may read to the court. From these
special rhetor-pleaders comes the lawyer. His antiquity in Greece
appears from a remark in Diogenes Laertius that Bias, Wise Man of
Priene, was an eloquent pleader of causes, who always reserved his
talents for the just side. Some of these lawyers are attached to the
courts as exegetai, or interpreters; for many of the jurors have no more
legal knowledge than the parties to the case.</p>
<p>Evidence is ordinarily presented in writing, but the witness must
appear and swear to its accuracy when the grammateusy or clerk of the
court, reads it to the jurors. There is no cross-examination. Perjury is
so frequent that cases are sometimes decided in the face of explicit
sworn evidence. The testimony of women and minors is accepted only in
murder trials; that of slaves is admitted only when drawn from them by
torture; it is taken for granted that without torture they will lie. It
is a barbarous aspect of Greek law, destined to be out- done in Roman
prisons and Inquisition chambers, and perhaps rivaled in the secret
rooms of police courts in our time. Torture, in Pericle s’ day, is
forbidden in the case of citizens. Many masters decline to let their
slaves be used as wit- nesses, even when their case may depend upon such
testimony; and any per- manent injury done to a slave by torture must be
made good by those who inflicted it.“</p>
<p>Penalties take the form of flogging, fines, disfranchisement,
branding, con^ fiscation, exile, and death; imprisonment is seldom used
as a punishment. It is a principle of Greek law that a slave should be
punished in his body, but a free- man in his property. A vase painting
shows a slave hung up by his arms and legs, and mercilessly lashed.“
Fines are the usual penalty for citizens, and are assessed on a scale
that opens the democracy to the charge of fattening its purse through
unjust condemnations. On the other hand a convicted person and his
accuser are in many cases allowed to name the fine or punishment that
they think just; and the court then chooses between the suggested
penalties. Mur- der, sacrilege, treason, and some offenses that seem
minor to us are punished with both confiscation and death; but a
prospective death penalty may usually be avoided before trial by
voluntary exile and the abandonment of property. If the accused disdains
flight, and is a citizen, death is inflicted as painlessly as possible
by administering hemlock, which gradually benumbs the body from the feet
upward, killing when it reaches the heart. In the case of slaves the
death penalty may be effected by a brutal cudgeling.“ Sometimes the con-
demned, before or after death, may be hurled over a cliff into a pit
called the barathron. When a sentence of death is laid upon a murderer
it is carried out by the public executioner in the presence of the
relatives of the victim, as a concession to the old custom and spirit of
revenge.</p>
<p>The Athenian code is not as enlightened as we might expect, and
advances only moderately upon Hammurabi’s. Its basic defect is the
limitation of legal</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>rights to freemen constituting hardly a seventh of the population.
Even free women and children are excluded from the proud isonomia of the
citizens; metics, foreigners, and slaves can bring suit only through a
patron citizen. Sycophantic blackmail, frequent torture of slaves,
capital punishment for minor offenses, personal abuse in forensic
debate, the diffusion and weakening of judicial responsibility, the
susceptibility of jurors to oratorical displays, their in- ability to
temper present passions with a knowledge of the past or a wise calcula-
tion of the future — these are black marks against a system of law
envied throughout Greece for its comparative mildness and integrity, and
sufficiently dependable and practical to give to Athenian life and
property that orderly pro- tection which is so necessary for economic
activity and moral growth. One test of Athenian law is the reverence
that nearly every citizen feels for it: the law is for him the very soul
of his city, the essence of its beneficence and strength. The best
judgment of the Athenian code is the readiness with which other Greek
states adopt a large part of it. “Everyone would admit,” says Isocrates,
“that</p>
<p>Athenian law prevails throughout the Athenian Empire of two million
souls while that Empire endures; but for the rest Greece never achieves
a common system of jurisprudence. International law makes as sorry a
picture in fifth- century Athens as in the world today. Nevertheless
external trade requires some legal code, and commercial treaties
{symbola) are described by Demos- thenes as so numerous in his time that
the laws governing commercial disputes “are everywhere identical.”“
These treatises establish consular representation, guarantee the
execution of contracts, and make the judgments given in one signatory
nation valid in the others.® This, however, does not put an end to
piracy, which breaks out whenever the dominant fleet is weakened, or
relaxes its watchfulness. Eternal vigilance is the price of order as
well as of liberty; and lawlessness stalks like a wolf about every
settled realm, seeking some point of weakness which may give it entry.
The right of a city to lead foraging expeditions upon the persons and
property of other cities is accepted by some Greek states so long as no
treaty specifically forbids it.“ Religion succeeds in making temples
inviolable unless used as military bases; it protects heralds and
pilgrims to Panhellenic festivals; it requires a formal declaration of
war before hostilities, and the granting of a truce, when asked, for the
return and burial of the dead in battle. Poisoned weapons are avoided by
general custom, and prisoners are usually exchanged or ransomed at the
recognized tariff of two minas — later one mina (00) — each;® otherwise
war is nearly as brutal among the Greeks as in modem Christendom.
Treaties are numerous, and are solemn- ized with pious oaths; but they
are almost always broken. Alliances are fre-</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 263</p>
<p>quent, and sometimes generate lasting leagues, like the Delphic
Amphictyony in the sixth century and the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues in
the third. Occa- sionally two cities exchange the courtesy of
isopoliteia, by which each gives to the other’s freemen the rights of
citizenship. International arbitration may be arranged, but the
decisions arrived at in such cases are as often as not rejected or
ignored. Towards foreigners the Greek feels no moral obligation, and no
legal one except by treaty; they are barbaroi* — not quite “barbarians,”
but out - siders — aliens speaking outlandish tongues. Only in the Stoic
philosophers of the cosmopolitan Hellenistic era will Greece rise to the
conception of a moral code embracing all mankind.</p>
<p>4 . Administration</p>
<p>As early as 487, perhaps earlier, the method of election in the
choice of archons is replaced by lot; some way must be found to keep the
rich from buying, or the knaves from smiling, their way into office. To
render the selection less than wholly accidental, all those upon whom
the lot falls are subjected, before taking up their duties, to a
rigorous dokimasia, or character examination, conducted by the Council
or the courts. The can- didate must show Athenian parentage on both
sides, freedom from physi- cal defect and scandal, the pious honoring of
his ancestors, the perform- ance of his military assignments, and the
full payment of his taxes; his whole life is on this occasion exposed to
challenge by any citizen, and the pros- pect of such a scrutiny
presumably frightens the most worthless from the sortition. If he passes
this test the archon swears an oath that he will prop- erly perform the
obligations of his office, and will dedicate to the gods a golden statue
of life-size if he should accept presents or bribes.“ The fact that
chance is allowed to play so large a part in the naming of the nine
archo ns suggests the diminution which the office has suffered since
Solon’s day; its functions are now in the nature of administrative
routine. The archon basileus, whose name preserves the empty title of
king, has become merely the chief religious official of the city. Nine
times yearly the archon is required to obtain a vote of confidence from
the Assembly; his actions and judgments may be appealed to the boule or
the heliaea; and any citizen may indict him for malfeasance. At the end
of his term all his official acts, accounts, and documents are reviewed
by a board of logistai responsible to</p>
<p>• The word is cousin to the Sanskrit barbara and the Latin balbtis,
both of which mean stammering; cf. our babble. The Greeks implied by
barbaros rather strangeness of speech than lack of civilization, and
used barbarismos precisely as we, following them, use barbarism — to
mean an alien or quasi- alien distortion of a nation’s idiom.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>the Council; and severe penalties, even death, may avenge serious
miscon- duct. If the archon escapes these democratic dragons he becomes,
at the end of his year of office, a member of the Areopagus; but this,
in the fifth century, is a well-nigh empty honor, since that body has
lost nearly all its powers.</p>
<p>The archons are but one of many committees which, under the direction
and scrutiny of the Assembly, the Council, and the courts, administer
the affairs of the city. Aristotle names twenty-five such groups, and
estimates the number of municipal officials at seven hundred. Nearly all
of these are chosen annually by lot; and since no man may be a member of
the same committee twice, every citizen may expect to be a city
dignitary for at least one year of his life. Athens does not believe in
government by ex- perts.</p>
<p>More importance is attached to military than to civil office. The
ten</p>
<p>strategoi, or commanders, though they too are appointed for a year
only, and are at all times subject to examination and recall, are chosen
not by lot but by open election in the Assembly. Here ability, not
popularity, is the road to preferment; and the ekklesia of the fourth
century shows its good sense by choosing Phocion general forty-five
times, despite the fact that he is_the most unpopular man in Athens and
makes no secret of his scorn for the crowd. The functions of the
strategoi expand with the growth of international relations, so that in
the later fifth century they not only manage the army and the navy, but
conduct negotiations with foreign states, and control the revenues and
expenditures of the city. The com- mander in chief, or strategos
autokrator, is therefore the most powerful man in the government; and
since he may be re-elected year after year, he can give to the state a
continuity of purpose which its constitution might other- wise render
impossible. Through this office Pericles makes Athens for a generation a
democratic monarchy, so that Thucydides can say of the Athenian polity
that though it is a democracy in name it is really govern- ment by the
greatest of the citizens.</p>
<p>The army is identical with the electorate; every citizen must serve,
and is subject, until the age of sixty, to conscription in any war. But
Athenian life is not militarized; after a period of youthful training
there is little of martial drill, no strutting of uniforms, no
interference of soldiery with the civilian population. In active service
the army consists of light-armed in- fantry, chiefly the poorer’
citizens, carrying slings or spears; the heavy- armed infantry, or
hoplites, those prosperous citizens who can afford armor, shield, and
javelin; and the cavahy of rich men, clad in armor and helmet.</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 26 equipped with
lance and sword. The Greeks excel the Asiatics in mili- tary discipline,
and perhaps owe their achievements to a striking combina- tion of loyal
obedience on the battlefield with vigorous independence in civil
affairs. Nevertheless there is no science of war among them, no definite
principles of tactics on strategy, before Epaminondas and Philip. Cities
are usually walled, and defense is — among the Greeks as among ourselves
— more effective than offense; otherwise man might have no civilization
to record. Siege armies bring up great beams suspended by chains, and,
draw- ing the beams back, drive them forward against the wall; this is
as far as siege machinery develops before Archimedes. As for the navy,
it is kept up by choosing, each year, four hundred trierarchs, rich men
whose privi- lege it is to recruit a crew, equip a trireme with
materials supplied by the state, pay for its building and launching, and
keep it in repair; in this way Athens supports in peacetime a fleet of
some sixty ships.*</p>
<p>The maintenance of the army and the navy constitutes the chief expen-
diture of the state. Revenues come from traffic tolls, harbor dues, a
two per cent tariff on imports and exports, a twelve-drachma annual poll
tax on metics, a half -drachma tax on freedmen and slaves, a tax on
prostitutes, a sales tax, hcenses, fines, confiscations, and the
imperial tribute. The tax on farm produce, which financed Athens under
Peisistratus, is abandoned by the democracy as derogatory to the dignity
of agriculture. Most taxes are farmed out to publicans, who collect them
for the state and pocket a share as their profit. Considerable income is
derived from state ownership of mineral resources. In emergencies the
city resorts to a capital levy, the rate rising with the amount of
property owned; by this method, for exam- ple, the Athenians in 428
raise two hundred talents (,200,000) for the siege of Mytilene. Rich men
are also invited to undertake certain leiturgiai, i.e., public services,
such as equipping embassies, fitting out ships for the fleet, or paying
for plays, musical contests, and games. These “liturgies” are
voluntarily undertaken by some of the wealthy, and are forced by pub-
lic opinion upon others. To add to the discomfort of the well to do, any
citizen assigned to a liturgy may compel any other to take it from him,
or exchange fortunes with him, if he can prove the other to be richer
than himself. As the democratic faction grows in power it finds ever
more numerous occasions and reasons for using this device; and in return
the financiers, merchants, manufacturers, and landed proprietors of
Attica study the arts of concealment and obstruction, and meditate
revolution.</p>
<p>Excluding such gifts and levies, the total internal revenue of Athens
in the time of Pericles amounts to some four hundred talents (,400,000)
a</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>year; to which is added six hundred talents of contributions from
subjects and allies. This income is spent without any budget, or advance
estimate and allocation of funds. Under Pericles’ thrifty management,
and despite his unprecedented expenditures, the treasury shows a growing
surplus, which in 440 stands at 9700 talents (8,200,000); a pretty sum
for any city in any age, and quite extraordinary in Greece, where few
states — in the Peloponnesus none — have any surplus at all.“ In cities
that have such a reserve it is deposited, usually, in the temple of the
city’s god— at Athens, after 434, in the Parthenon. The state claims the
right to use not only this surplus, but, as well, the gold in the
statues which it raises to its god; in the case of Pheidias’ Athene
Parthenos this amounts to forty talents (40, -</p>
<p>000), and is so affixed as to be removable.” In the temple the city
keeps also its “theoric fund,” from which it makes the payments annually
due the citizens for attendance at the sacred plays and games.</p>
<p>Such is Athenian democracy — the narrowest and fullest in history:
nar- rowest in the number of those who share its privileges, fullest in
the direct- ness and equality with which all the citizens control
legislation, and</p>
<p>administer public affairs. The faults of the system will appear
vividly as its history unfolds; indeed, they are already noised about in
Aristophanes. The irresponsibility of an Assembly that may without check
of precedent or revision vote its momentary passion on one day, and on
the next day its passionate regret, punishing then not itself but those
who have misled it; the limitation of legislative authority to those who
can attend the ekklesia; the encouragement of demagogues and the
wasteful ostracism of able men; the fillin g of offices by lot and
rotation, changing the personnel yearly and creating a chaos of
government; the disorderliness of faction perpetually disturbing the
guidance and administration of the state — these are vital de- fects,
for which Athens will pay the full penalty to Sparta, Philip, Alexan-
der, and Rome.</p>
<p>But every government is imperfect, irksome, and mortal; we have no
reason to believe that monarchy or aristocracy would govern Athens bet-
ter, or longer preserve it; and perhaps only this chaotic democracy can
release the energy that will lift Athens to one of the peaks of history.
Never before or since has political life, within the circle of
citizenship, been so intense or so creative. This corrupt and
incompetent democracy is at least a school: the voter in the Assembly
listens to the cleverest men in Athens, the Juror in the courts has his
wits sharpened by the taking and sifting of evidence, the holder of
office is molded by executive responsibility and</p>
<p>CHAP.Xl) PERICLES AND THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT 267</p>
<p>experience into a deeper maturity of understanding and judgment; “the
city,” says Simonides, “is the teacher of the man.”“ For these reasons,
it may be, the Athenians can appreciate, and thereby call into
existence, Aes- chylus and Euripides, Socrates and Plato; the audience
at the theater has been formed in the Assembly and the courts, and is
ready to receive the best. This aristocratic democracy is no
laissez-faire state, no mere watch- man of property and order; it
finances the Greek drama, and builds the Parthenon; it makes itself
responsible for the welfare and development of its people, and opens up
to them the opportunity ou monon tou zen, alia tou eu zew — “not only to
live, but to live well.” History can afford to for - give it all its
sins.</p>
