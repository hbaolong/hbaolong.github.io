<h4 id="chapter-iii-the-life-of-the-state">CHAPTER III The Life of the
State</h4>
<p>I. THE MISTRESS DEPARTS</p>
<p>M ME. DE POMPADOUR was among the casualties of the war. For</p>
<p>some time the charm of her personality kept the King in thrall while
the nation mourned; but after the attempt of Damiens to assassinate him
(Jan- uary 5, 1757) Louis XV, suddenly conscious of God, sent word to
her that she must leave at once. He made the humane mistake of coming to
say good- bye; he found her quietly and sadly packing. Some surviving
tenderness overcame him; he asked her to remain. 1 Soon all her former
privileges and powers were restored. She negotiated with diplomats and
ambassadors; she raised and lowered ministers and generals. Marc-Pierre
de Voyer, Comte d’Argenson, had opposed her at every step; she had
sought to appease him and had been repulsed; she had him replaced by the
Abbe de Bernis as minis- ter for foreign affairs, and then by Choiseul
(1758). Reserving her tenderness for her relatives and the King, she
faced all others with a heart of steel within an ailing frame. She sent
some enemies to the Bastille, and let them stay there for years. 2
Meanwhile she feathered her nests, adorned her palaces, and or- dered a
stately mausoleum for herself beneath the Place Vendome.</p>
<p>She bore, among the people, in the Parlement, and at court, the chief
blame for French reverses in the war, but she received no credit for the
victories. She was held accountable for the unpopular alliance with
Austria, though she had been only a minor factor in that mating. She was
condemned for the disaster at Rossbach, where her man Soubise had
commanded the French; her critics did not know — or considered it
irrelevant — that Soubise had advised against giving battle, and had
been forced into it by the precipitancy of the German general. If
Soubise had had his way, if his plan of wearing out Fred- erick with
marches and desertions had been followed, if Czarina Elizaveta had not
died so inopportunely and left Russia to a young idolator of Fred- erick
— perhaps the Prussian resistance would have collapsed, France would
have received the Austrian Netherlands, and Pompadour would have been
carried on a sea of blood to national acclaim. She had failed to placate
the great god Chance.</p>
<p>The Parlement hated her for encouraging the King to ignore the Parle-
ment. The clergy hated her as friend of Voltaire and the
Encyclopedistes; Christophe de Beaumont, archbishop of Paris, said he
would “like to see her burn.” 3 When the Paris populace suffered from
the high price of bread they cried out that “that prostitute who governs
the kingdom is bringing it to ruin.” “If we had her here,” said a voice
in the mob at the Pont de la Tour - nelle, “there would soon not be
enough left of her to make relics.” 4 She dared not show herself in the
streets of Paris, and she was surrounded by</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>enemies at Versailles. She wrote to the Marquise de Fontenailles: “I
am quite alone in the midst of this crowd of petits seigneurs, who
loathe me and whom I despise. As for most of the women, their
conversation gives me a sick head- ache. Their vanity, their lofty airs,
their meannesses, and their treacheries make them insupportable.” 5</p>
<p>As the war dragged on, and France saw Canada and India snatched from
her, and Ferdinand of Brunswick kept French armies at bay, and returning
soldiers, wounded or maimed, appeared in the streets of Paris, it became
clear to the King that he had made a tragic mistake in listening to
Kaunitz and Pompadour. In 1761 he consoled himself with a new mistress,
Mile, de Romans, who bore him the future Abbe de Bourbon. Gossip said
that Pompa- dour revenged herself by accepting Choiseul as her lover, 6
but she was too weak, and Choiseul too clever, for such a liaison; to
Choiseul she surrendered her power rather than her love. Now, it may be,
she uttered the despondent prophecy, “Apres moi le deluge.’ 1 ’’’’</p>
<p>She had always been frail. Even in her youth she had spit blood; and
though we are not certain that she had tuberculosis, we know that her
cough- ing increased painfully as she turned forty. The singing voice
that had once thrilled King and court was now hoarse and strained. Her
friends were shocked by her emaciation. In February, 1764, she took to
her bed with high fever and bloody inflammation of the lungs. In April
her condition became so serious that she summoned a notary to draw up
her last testament. She left gifts to her relatives, friends, and
servants, and add ed: “If I have forgotten any of my relatives in this
will I beg my brother to provide for them.” To Louis XV she deeded her
Paris mansion, which, as the Ely see Palace, is now occupied by the
President of France. The King spent many hours at her bedside; during
her last days he seldom left the room. The Dauphin, who had always been
her foe, wrote to the bishop of Verdun: “She is dying with a courage
rare for either sex. Her lungs are full of water or pus, her heart is
congested or dilated. It is an u nbelievably cruel and painful death.” 8
Even for this last battle she kept herself richly attired, and her
parched cheeks were rouged. She reigned almost to the end. Courtiers
thronged around her couch; she distributed favors, and nominated persons
to high office; and the King acted on many of her recommendations.</p>
<p>At last she admitted defeat. On April 14 she accepted gratefully the
final sacraments that sought to solace death with hope. So long the
friend of philosophers, she tried now to recapture the faith of her
childhood. Like a child she prayed:</p>
<p>I commend my soul to God, imploring Him to have pity on it, to
forgive my sins, to grant me the grace to repent of them and die worthy
of His mercy, hoping to appease His justice through the glory of the
precious blood of Jesus Christ my Saviour, and through the intercession
of the Virgin Mary and all the saints in Paradise. 9</p>
<p>To the priest who was departing as she entered her final agony, she
whis- pered, “Wait a moment; we will leave the house together.” 10 She
died on April 15, 1764, choked by the congestion in her lungs. She was
forty-two years old.</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>It is not true that Louis took her death with indifference; he merely
con- cealed his grief. 11 “The King,” said the Dauphin, “is in great
affliction, though he controls himself with us and with everybody.” 12
When, on April 17, the woman who had been half of his life for twenty
years was carried from Versailles Palace in a cold and driving rain, he
went out on the balcony to see her depart. “The Marquise will have very
bad weather,” he said to his valet Champlost. It was not a frivolous
remark, for Champlost reported that there were tears in the royal eyes,
and that Louis added sadly, “This is the only tribute I can pay her.” 13
By her own wishes she was buried by the side of her child Alexandrine,
in the now vanished church of the Capucines in the Place Vendome.</p>
<p>The court rejoiced to be freed from her power; the populace, which
had not felt her charm, cursed her costly extravagance, and soon forgot
her; the artists and writers whom she had helped lamented the loss of a
gracious and understanding friend. Diderot was harsh: “So what remains
of this woman who cost us so much in men and money, who left us without
honor and without energy, and who overthrew the whole political system
of Europe? A handful of dust.” But Voltaire, from Ferney, wrote:</p>
<p>I am very sad at the death of Mme. de Pompadour. I was indebted to
her, and I mourn out of gratitude. It seems absurd that while an ancient
pen-pusher, hardly able to walk, should still be alive, a beautiful
woman, in the midst of a splendid career, should die at the age of
forty. Perhaps, if she had been able to live quietly, as I do, she would
be alive today…. She had justice in her mind and heart…. It is the end
of a dream. 14</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE RECOVERY OF FRANCE</li>
</ol>
<p>Not until Napoleon did France fully recover fr om the Seven Years’
War. High taxes had discouraged agriculture under Louis XIV ; they
continued to the same effect under Louis XV; thousands of acres farmed
in the seven- teenth century were left uncultivated in 1760, and were
reverting to wilder- ness. 15 Livestock was depleted, fertilizer was
lacking, the soil was starved. Peasants kept to old clumsy methods of
tillage, for taxes rose with every improvement that increased the
peasants’ wealth. Many peasants had no heat</p>
<p>Nevertheless economic recovery began as soon as peace was signed. The
government was inefficient and corrupt, but many measures were taken to
help the peasantry. Royal intendants distributed seed and built roads;
agro- nomic societies published agricultural information, established
competitions, awarded prizes; some tax collectors distinguished
themselves by their humane moderation. 16 Stimulated by the physiocrats,
many seigneurs interested them- selves in improving agricultural methods
and products. Peasant proprietors grew in number. By 1774 only six per
cent of the French population still</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>labored under serfdom. 17 But every increment of production brought a
rise in population; the land was rich, yet the average peasant holding
was small; poverty remained.</p>
<p>Out of peasant loins came the human surplus that went to man the
indus- tries in the growing towns. With a few exceptions industry was
still in the domestic and handicraft stage. Large-scale capitalistic
organizations domi- nated metallurgy, mining, soap-making, and textiles.
Marseilles in 1760 had thirty-five soap factories, employing a thousand
workers. 18 Lyons was al- ready dependent for its prosperity upon the
shifting market for the product of its looms. English carding machines
were introduced about 1750, and to- ward 1770 the jenny, working
forty-eight spindles at once, began to replace the spinning wheel in
France. The French were quicker to invent than to apply, for they lacked
the capital that England, enriched by commerce, could use to finance
mechanical improvements in industry. The steam engine had been known in
France since 1681. 19 Joseph Cugnot used it in 1769 to operate the first
known automobile; a year later this was employed to trans- port heavy
loads at four miles an hour; however, the machine got out of hand and
demolished a wall, and it had to stop every fifteen minutes to replenish
its water. 20</p>
<p>With such bizarre exceptions, transport was by horse, cart, coach, or
boat. Roads and canals were much better than in England, but inns were
worse. A regular postal service was established in 1760; it was not
quite private, for Louis XV ordered postmasters to open letters and
report any suspicious con- tent to the government. 21 Internal trade was
hampered by tolls, external trade by war and loss of colonies. The
Compagnie des Indes went bankrupt, and was dissolved (1770). Trade with
European states, however, increased sub- stantially during the century,
from 176,600,000 livres in 1716 to 804,300,000 livres in 1787; but some
of the increase merely reflected inflation. Trade with the French West
Indies flourished in sugar and slaves.</p>
<p>A gradual inflation, due partly to debasement of the currency, partly
to rising world production of gold and silver, had a stimulating effect
upon industrial and commercial enterprise; the businessman could usually
expect to sell his product at a higher price level than that on which he
had bought his labor and materials. So the middle classes swelled their
fortunes, while the lower classes had all they could do to keep income
in sight of prices. The same inflation that enabled the government to
cheat its creditors reduced the value of its revenues, so that taxes
rose as livres fell. The King became de- pendent upon bankers like the
brothers Paris, particularly Paris-Duverney, who so delighted Pompadour
with his fiscal prestidigitation that he was able, during the war, to
make or break ministers and generals.</p>
<p>The basic economic development in eighteenth-century France was the
passage of pre-eminent wealth from those who owned land to those who
controlled industry, commerce, or finance. Voltaire noted in 1755:
“Owing to the increasing profits of trade… there is less wealth than
formerly among the great, and more among the middle classes. The result
has been to lessen the distance between classes.” 22 Businessmen like La
Popeliniere could</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>7 1</p>
<p>build palaces that were the envy of nobles, and adorn their tables
with the best poets and philosophers in the realm; it was the
bourgeoisie that now gave patronage to literature and art. The
aristocracy consoled itself by hugging its privileges and displaying its
style; it insisted upon noble birth as prerequi- site to army
commissions or episcopal posts; it flaunted its armorial bearings and
proliferated pedigrees; it strove — often in vain — to keep able or
distin- guished commoners out of high administrative office and the
court. The rich bourgeois demanded that career should be open to talent
of whatever birth; and when his demand was ignored he flirted with
revolution.</p>
<p>All but the peasant phase of the class war took visible form in the
tumult and splendor of Paris. Half the wealth of France was siphoned
into the capi- tal, and half the poverty of France festered there.
Paris, said Rousseau, “is perhaps the city in the world where fortunes
are most unequal, and where flaunting wealth and the most appalling
penury dwell together.” 23 Sixty paupers were part of the official
escort for the corpse of the Dauphin’s eldest son in 1761. 24 Paris
towar d 1770 contained 600,000 of France’s 22,000,000 souls. 25 It
housed the most alert, the best-informed, and the most depraved people
in Europe. It had the best-paved streets, the most splendid avenues and
promenades, the busiest traffic, the finest shops, the lordliest
palaces, the dingiest tenements, and some of the most beautiful churches
in the world. Goldoni, coming to Paris from Venice in 1762,
marveled:</p>
<p>What crowds! What an assemblage of people of every description!… With
what a surprising view my senses and mind were struck on approaching the
Tuileries! I saw the extent of that immense garden, which has nothing
comparable to it in the universe, and my eyes were unable to measure the
length of it…. A majestic river, numerous and convenient bridges, vast
quays, crowds of carriages, an endless throng of people. 26</p>
<p>A thousand stores tempted purses and the purseless; a thousand
vendors hawked their goods in the streets; a hundred restaurants (the
word first ap- pears in 1765) offered to restore the hungry; a thousand
dealers collected, forged, or sold antiques; a thousand hairdressers
trimmed and powdered the hair or wigs of even the artisan class. In the
narrow alleys artists and crafts- men produced paintings, furniture, and
finery for the well-to-do. Here were a hundred printing shops producing
books, sometimes at mortal risk; in 1774 the book trade at Paris was
estimated at 45,000,000 livres — four times that of London. 27 “London
is good for the English,” said Garrick, “but Paris is good for
everybody.” 28 Said Voltaire in 1768, “We have over thirty thousand
people in Paris who take an interest in art.” 29 There, beyond
challenge, was the cultural capital of the world.</p>

<li>THE PHYSIOCRATS</li>
</ol>
<p>In an apartment at Versailles, under the rooms and the favoring eye
of Mme. de Pompadour, that economic theory took form which was to stir
and mold the Revolution, and shape the capitalism of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>7 2</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>The French economy had been struggling to grow despite the swaddling
clothes of regulations — by guilds and Colbert — and the Midas myth of a
mer- cantilism that mistook gold for wealth. To increase exports,
diminish im- ports, and take the “favorable balance” in silver and gold
as a prop of political and military power, France and England had
subjected their national econo- mies to a mesh of rules and restraints
helpful to economic order but harming production by hampering
innovation, enterprise, and competition. All this- said men like
Gournay, Quesnay, Mirabeau pere, Du Pont de Nemours, and Turgot — was
quite contrary to nature; man is by nature acquisitive and com-
petitive; and if his nature is freed from unnecessary trammels he will
as- tonish the world with the quantity, variety, and excellence of his
products. So, said these “physiocrats,” let nature (in Greek, physis )
rule ( kratein ); let men invent, manufacture, and trade according to
their natural instincts; or, as Gournay is said to have said, laissez
faire — 1 “let him do” as he himself thinks best. The famous phrase was
already old, for about 1 664, when Col- bert asked businessman Legendre,
“What should we [the government] do to help you?” he answered, “Nous
laisser faire— let us do it, let us alone.” 30 Jean-Claude Vincent de
Gournay was the first clear voice of the physio- crats in France.
Doubtless he knew of the protests that Boisguillebert and Vauban had
made to Louis XIV against the stifling restrictions laid upon
agriculture under the feudal regime. He was so impressed by Sir Josiah
Child’s Brief Observations Concerning Trade and Interest (1668) that he
translated it into French (1754); and presumably he had read Richard
Can- tillon’s Essay on the Nature of Commerce (c. 1734) in its French
form (1755). Some would date from this last book the birth of economics
as a “science”— a reasoned analysis of the sources, production, and
distribution of wealth. “Land,” said Cantillon, “is the source or
material from which wealth is extracted,” but “human labor is the form
which produces wealth”; and he defined wealth not in terms of gold or
money, but as “the sustenance, con - veniences, and comforts of life.”
31 This definition was i tself a revolution in economic theory.</p>
<p>Gournay was a well-to-do merchant operating at first (1729-44) in
Cadiz. After extensive business dealings in England, Germany, and the
United Provinces, he settled in Paris, and was appointed intendant du
commerce (1751). Traveling through France on tours of inspection, he
observed at first hand the restraints put by guild and governmental
regulations upon economic enterprise and exchange. He left no written
formulation of his views, but they were summarized after his death
(1759) by his pupil Turgot. He urged that existing economic regulations
should be reduced, if not re- moved; every man knows better than the
government what procedure best favors his work; when each is free to
follow his interest more goods will be produced, wealth will grow.
32</p>
<p>There are laws unique and primeval, founded on nature alone, by which
all existing values in commerce balance one another and fix themselves
at a de- termined price, just as bodies left to their own weight arrange
themselves ac- cording to their specific gravity ; 33</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>hat is, values and prices are determined by the relations of supply
and de- mand, which in turn are determined by the nature of man. Gournay
con- cluded that the state should intervene in the economy only to
protect life, liberty, and property, and to stimulate, with distinctions
and awards, the quantity and quality of production. M. Trudaine, heading
the Bureau of Commerce, accepted these doctrines, and Turgot gave them
the force of his eloquence and acknowledged probity.</p>
<p>Frangois Quesnay followed a slightly different physiocratic line. Son
of a landed proprietor, he never lost his interest in land, though he
was trained to be a physician. He made a fortune by his skill in
medicine and surgery, and rose to be physician to Alme. de Pompadour and
the King (1749). In his rooms at Versailles he gathered a coterie of
heretics — Duclos, Diderot, Buf- fon, Helvetius, Turgot… ; there they
discussed everything freely except the King, whom they dreamed of
transforming into an “enlightened despot” as the agent of peaceful
reform. Immersed in the Age of Reason, Quesnay felt that the time had
come to apply reason to economics. Though he was a self-confident
dogmatist in his works, he was in person a kindly soul, dis- tinguished
by integrity in an immoral milieu.</p>
<p>In 1750 he met Gournay, and soon became more interested in economics
than in medicine. Under careful pseudonyms he contributed essays to the
Ency elope die of Diderot. His article “Farms” ascribed their desertion
to high taxes and conscription. The arti cle “Grains” (1757) noted that
small farms were incapable of profitably using the most productive
methods, and favored large plantations managed by “entrepreneurs”— an
anticipation of the agricultural mammoths of our time. The government
should improve roads, rivers, and canals, remove all tolls on
transportation, and free the products of agriculture from all restraints
of trade.</p>
<p>In 1758 Quesnay published a Tableau economique that became the basic
manifesto of the physiocrats. Though printed by the government press in
the Palace of Versailles under the supervision of the King, it condemned
luxury as a wasteful use of wealth that might have been employed to
produce greater wealth. In Quesnay’s view only the products of the earth
constituted wealth. He divided society into three classes: a classe
productive, of farmers, miners, and fishermen; a classe disponible —
persons available for military or administrative offices; and a classe
sterile — artisans who work up the products of the earth into useful
objects, and tradesmen who bring the products to the consumer. Since
taxes laid upon the second or third class ultimately (in Quesnay’s view)
fall upon the owners of land, the most scientific and con - venient
impost would be a single tax ( impot unique) upon the annual net profit
of each parcel of land. Taxes should be collected directly by the state,
never by private financiers ( fermiers generaux). The government should
be an absolute and hereditary monarchy.</p>
<p>Quesnay’s proposals now seem to be vitiated by their underestimation
of labor, industry, commerce, and art, but to some of his contemporaries
they appeared as an illuminating revelation. The most colorful of his
followers, Victor Riqueti, Marquis de Mirabeau, thought that the T
ableau economique</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>rivaled writing and money as among the noblest inventions of history.
Born in 1715, dying in 1789, the Marquis precisely spanned the age of
Voltaire. He inherited a comfortable estate, lived like a lord, wrote
like a democrat, entitled his first book L’Ami des hommes, ou Traite de
la population (1756), and earned the name he had taken, “Friend of
Mankind.” After publishing his chef- d’oeuvre he came under the
influence of Quesnay; he revised his book accordingly, and enlarged it
into a six-volume treatise that went through forty editions and shared
in preparing the mind of France for 1789.</p>
<p>The Marquis was not as disturbed by human multiplication as Malthus
was to be in 1798. He held that a nation is made great by a large
population, and that this is made possible by “men multiplying like rats
in a barn if they have the means or subsistence” 34 — as we still see.
He concluded that every encouragement should be given to those who grow
food. The unequal dis- tribution of wealth, he thought, discourages food
production, for the estates of the rich take up land that could be
fertile farms. Mirabeau’s preface told the King that the peasants
were</p>
<p>he most productive class of all, those who see beneath them nothing
but their nurse and yours — Mother Earth; who stoop unceasingly beneath
the weight of the most toilsome labors; who bless you every day, and ask
nothing from you but peace and protection. It is with their sweat and
(you know it not!) their very blood that you gratify that heap of
useless people who are ever telling you that the greatness of a prince
consists in the value and number… of favors that he divides among his
courtiers. I have seen a tax-gathering bailiff cut off the hand of a
poor woman who clung to her saucepan, the last utensil of the household,
which she was defending from distraint. What would you have said, great
prince ? 35</p>
<p>In Theorie de Fimpot (1760) the revolutionary Marquis attacked the
tax- collecting farmers general as parasites preying upon the vitals of
the nation. The angry financiers persuaded Louis XV to imprison him in
the Chateau de Vincennes (December 16, 1760); Quesnay induced Mme. de
Pompadour to intercede; Louis released the Marquis (December 25), but
ordered him to remain on his estate at Le Bignon. Mirabeau made a virtue
of necessity by studying agriculture- at first hand and in 1763 he
issued Philosophie rurale, “the most comprehensive treatise on economics
prior to Adam Smith.” 36 Grimm called it “the Pentateuch of the
[physiocratic] sect.” 37</p>
<p>Altogether this unique Marquis wrote forty books, right up to his
dying year — all despite the trouble given him by his son, whom in
desperation he sent to prison as a measure of safety for both. Like that
son he was violent and dissolute, married for money, charged his wife
with adultery, let her return to her parents, and took a mistress. He
denounced lettres de cachet as intolerable tyranny, and later prevailed
upon the ministry to issue fifty of them to help him discipline his
family. 38</p>
<p>We find it hard to realize today the commotion raised by the
publications of the physiocrats, and the ardor of their campaigns.
Quesnay’s disciples looked up to him as the Socrates of economics; they
submitted their writ- ings to him before going to print, and in many
cases he contributed to their books. In 1767 Lemercier de la Riviere,
sometime governor of Martinique,</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>issued what Adam Smith considered “the most distinct and best
connected</p>
<p>Do you wish a society to attain the highest degree of wealth,
population, and power? Trust, then, its interests to freedom, and let
this be universal. By means of this liberty (which is the essential
element of industry) and the desire to enjoy — stimulated by competition
and enlightened by experience and example — you are guaranteed that
everyone will always act for his own greatest possible advantage, and
consequently will contribute with all the power of his particu- lar
interest to the general good, both to the ruler and to every member of
the society. 40</p>
<p>Pierre-Samuel du Pont summed up the gospel in Physiocratie (1768),
which gave the school its historic name. Du Pont spread the theory also
in two periodicals whose influence was felt all the way from Sweden to
Tus- cany. He served as inspector general of manufactures under Turgot,
and fell with Turgot’s fall (1776). He helped to negotiate with England
the treaty</p>
<p>On the face of it the physiocratie doctrine appeared to favor
feudalism, since feudal lords still owned, or drew feudal dues from, at
least a third of the land of France. But they — who had paid hardly any
taxes before 1 756 — were appalled at the notion that all taxes should
fall upon the landowners; nor could they accept the removal of feudal
tolls on the transport of goods through their domains. The middle
classes, which were thinking of new dignities, resented the idea that
they were a sterile, unproductive, part of the nation. And the
ploilosophes , though mostly agreeing with the physiocrats about relying
on the King as an agent of reform, could not accompany them in making
peace with the Church. 41 David Hume, who visited Quesnay in 1763,
thought the physiocrats “the most chimerical and arrogant set of men to
be found nowadays since the destruction of the Sorbonne.” 42 Voltaire
lampooned them (1768) in VHowme aux quarante ecus ( The Man ’with Forty
Crowns ). 43 In 1770 Ferdinando Galiani, an Italian habitue of d’Hol -
bach’s “synagogue” of atheists, issued Dialoghi sul commercio dei grant
, which Diderot in that same year translated into French. Voltaire said
that Plato and Moliere must have joined in writing this excellent
contribution to the already “dismal science” of economics. Galiani
ridiculed with Parisian wit the physiocratie notion that only the land
produces wealth. To free the trade in grains from all regulation would
(he argued) ruin the farmers of</p>

<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>France, and could produce a famine at home while clever merchants ex-
ported French grain to other states. This is precisely what happened in
1768 and 1775.</p>
<p>A story tells how Louis XV asked Quesnay what he would do if he were
king. “Nothing,” answered Quesnay. “Who, then, would govern?” “The laws”
44 — by which the phys iocrat meant the “laws” inherent in the nature of
man and governing supply and demand. The King agreed to try them. On
September 17, 1754, his ministry abolished all tolls and restraints on
the sale and transport of grains — wheat, rye, and corn — within the
kingdom; in 1764 this freedom was extended to the export of grains
except when these should reach a stated price. Left to the operation of
supply and demand, the price of bread dropped for a time, but a bad
harvest in 1765 raised it far beyond normal. The shortage of grains
reached the famine stage in 1768-69; peasants grubbed for food in
pigsties, and ate weeds and grass. In a parish of 2,200 souls 1,800
begged for bread. The people complained that while they faced
starvation, speculators were exporting grain. Critics charged the
government with profiting from the operations of these monopoleurs in a
“Pacte de Famine,” and this bitter variation on the Pacte de Famille of
1761 rang through subsequent years to accuse even the kindly Louis XVI
of benefiting from the high price of bread. Some officials were
apparently guilty, but Louis XV was not. He had commissioned certain
dealers to buy grain in good years, store it, and put it on the market
in years of scarcity; but when this was sold it was at prices too high
for the impoverished to pay. The gov- ernment took tardy remedial
measures; it imported grain and distributed it to the neediest
provinces. The public clamored for restoration of state con- trol over
the trade in grain; the Parlement joined in the demand; it was at this
juncture that Voltaire published his UHormne aux quarante ecus. The gov-
ernment yielded; on December 23, 1770, the edicts permitting free trade
in grain were revoked.</p>
<p>Despite this setback, physiocratic notions made their way, at home
and abroad. An edict of 1758 had established free trade in wool and
woolen products. Adam Smith visited Quesnay in 1765, was attracted by
his “modesty and simplicity,” and was confirmed in his own predilection
for economic liberty. He judged “the capital error of this system… to
lie in its representing the class of artificers, manufacturers, and
merchants as alto- gether barren and unproductive,” but he concluded
that “this system, with all its imperfections, is perhaps the nearest
approximation to the truth that has yet been published on the subject of
political economy.” 45 The ideas of the physiocrats accorded well with
the desire of England — already the great- est exporter among the
nations — to reduce export and import dues. The doc- trine that wealth
would grow faster under freedom from governmental re- strictions on
production and distribution found sympathetic hearing in Sweden under
Gustavus III, in Tuscany under Grand Duke Leopold, in Spain under
Charles III. Jefferson’s affection for a government that governed least
was in part an echo of physiocratic principles. Henry George acknowl-
edged the influence of the physiocrats on his advocacy of a single tax
falling</p>

<p>77</p>
<p>upon realty. 46 The philosophy of free enterprise and trade charmed
the American business class, and gave an added stimulus to the rapid
develop- ment of industry and wealth in the United States. In France the
physiocrats provided a theoretical basis for freeing the middle classes
from feudal and legal impediments to domestic trade and political
advancement. Before Quesnay died (December 16, 1774) he had the comfort
of seeing one of his friends made controller general of finance; and had
he lived fifteen years more he would have seen the triumph of many
physiocratic ideas in the Revolution.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE RISE OF TURGOT: 1 727-74</li>
</ol>
<p>Was Turgot a physiocrat? His rich and diverse background repels every
label. He came of an old family — l une bonne race,” Louis XV called it—
which had through generations filled with distinction important posts.
His father was a councilor of state and prevot des marchands — the
highest ad- ministrative office in Paris. His older brother was maitre
des requetes (secre- tary for petitions and claims), and a leading
member, of the Parlement of Paris. As a younger son, Anne-Robert-
Jacques Turgot was intended for the priesthood. In the College
Louis-le-Grand, in the Seminary of St.-Sulpice, and in the Sorbonne he
passed all tests with credit, and at the age of nineteen he became Abbe
de Brucourt. He learned to read Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, Italian,
German, and English, and to speak the last three of these languages
fluently. In 1749 he was elected a prior of the Sorbonne, and in that
capacity he delivered lectures two of which made a stir beyond the
ramparts of theology.</p>
<p>In July, 1750, he addressed the Sorbonne in Latin on “The Advantages
that the Establishment of Christianity Has Conferred upon the Human
Race”: it had rescued antiquity from superstition, had preserved many
arts and sciences, and had presented to mankind the liberating
conception of a law of justice transcending all human prejudices and
interests. “Could one hope for this from any other principle than
religion?… The Christian religion alone has… brought to light the rights
of humanity.” 47 T here is an echo of philosophy in this piety;
apparently the young prior had read Montesquieu and Voltaire, with some
effect upon his theology.</p>
<p>In December, 1750, he addressed the Sorbonne with a Tableau philoso-
phique des progres successes de /’ espr it humain. This historic
enunciation of the new religion of progress was a remarkable performance
for a youth of twenty-three. Anticipating Comte — perhaps following Vico
— he divided the history of the human mind into three stages:
theological, metaphysical, and scientific:</p>
<p>Before man understood the causal connection of physical phenomena,
noth- ing was so natural as to suppose they were produced by intelligent
beings, in- visible, and resembling themselves…. When philosophers
recognized the absurdity of these fables about the gods, but had not yet
gained an insight into natural history, they thought to explain the
causes of phenomena by abstract</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>expressions such as essences and faculties…. It was only at a later
period that, by observing the reciprocal mechanical action of bodies,
hypotheses were formed which could be developed by mathematics and
verified by experience. 48</p>
<p>Animals, said this brilliant youth, know no progress; they remain the
same from generation to generation; but man, by having learned to
accumulate and transmit knowledge, is able to improve the tools by which
he deals with his environment and enriches his life. As long as this
accumulation and trans- mission of knowledge and technology continues,
progress is inevitable, though it may be interrupted by natural
calamities and the vicissitudes of states. Progress is not uniform, nor
is it universal; some nations advance while others retreat; art may
stand still while science moves on; but the sum of the movement is
forward. For good measure Turgot predicted the American Revolution:
“Colonies are like fruit, which clings to the tree only until it is
ripe. By becoming self-sufficient, they do what Carthage did, what
America will sometime do.” 49</p>
<p>Inspired by the idea of progress, Turgot, while still in the
Sorbonne,</p>
<p>planned to write a history of civilization. Only his notes for some
sections of the project survive; from these it appears that he had
intended to include the history of language, religion, science,
economics, sociology, and psychol- ogy as well as the rise and fall of
states. 50 His father’s death having left him an adequate income, he
determined, late in 1750, to leave the ecclesiastical career. A fellow
abbe protested, and promised him rapid advancement, but Turgot replied,
according to Du Pont de Nemours, “I cannot condemn my - self to wear a
mask throughout my life.” 51</p>
<p>He had taken only minor orders, and was free to enter a political
career. In January, 1752, he became substitute attorney general, and in
December counselor in the Parlement; in 1753 he bought the office of
maitre des re- quites , in which he won a reputation for industry and
justice. In 1755-56 he accompanied Gournay on tours of inspection in the
provinces; now he learned economics by direct contact with farmers,
merchants, and manufac- turers. Through Gournay he met Quesnay, and
through him Mirabeau pere , Du Pont de Nemours, and Adam Smith. He never
listed himself as of the physiocratic school, but his money and his pen
were main supports of Du Pont’s magazine, Bphemerides.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1751) his mind and manners won him welcome in the salons
of Mme. Geoffrin, Mme. de Graffigny, Mme. du Deffand, and Mile, de
Lespinasse. There he met d’Alembert, Diderot, Helvetius, d’Holbach, and
Grimm. One early result of these contacts was his publication (1753) of
two Lettres sur la tolerance. To Diderot’s Encyclopedie he contributed
articles on existence, etymology, fairs, and markets, but when the
enterprise was con- demned by the government he withdrew as a
contributor. Traveling in Switzerland and France, he visited Voltaire
(1760), beginning a friendship that lasted till Voltaire’s death. The
sage of Ferney wrote to d’Alembert: “I have scarcely ever seen a man
more lovable or better informed.” 52 The philosophes claimed him as
their own, and hoped through him to influence the King.</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>In 1766 he wrote, for two Chinese students who were about to return
to China, a hundred-page outline of economics — Reflexions sur la
formation et la distribution des richesses. Published in the Ephemerides
(1769-70), it was acclaimed as one of the most concise and forceful
expositions of physiocratic theory. Land, said Turgot, is the only
source of wealth; all classes but culti- vators of the soil live on the
surplus that these produce beyond their own need; this surp lus
constitutes a “wages fund” from which the artisan class can be paid.
Here follows an early formulation of what came to be known as “the iron
law of wages”:</p>
<p>The wages of the worker are limited to his subsistence by competition
among the workmen…. The mere worker, who has only his arms and his
industry, has nothing except in so far as he succeeds in selling his
toil to others…. The employer pays him as little as he can; and as he
has a choice among a great number of workers, he prefers the one who
works for the least wage. The workers are therefore obliged to lower
their price in competition with one another. In every kind of work it
cannot fail to happen, and actually it does happen, that the wages of
the worker are limited to what is necessary for his subsistence. 53</p>
<p>Turgot went on to stress the importance of capital. Someone through
his savings must supply the tools and materials of production before the
worker can be employed, and he must keep the workers alive until the
sale of the product replenishes his capital. As an enterprise is never
sure of success, prof- its must be allowed to balance the risk of losing
the capital. “It is this con - tinual advance and return of capital
which constitutes… the circulation of money, that useful and fruitful
circulation which gives life to all the labors of the society,… and is
with great reason compared to the circulation of the blood in the animal
body.” 54 This circulation must not be interf ered with; profits and
interest, like wages, must be allowed to reach their natural level
according to supply and demand. Capitalists, manufacturers, merchants,
and workingmen should be free from taxation; this should fall only upon
land- owners, who will reimburse themselves by charging more for their
prod- ucts. No duty should be charged on the transport or sale of any
article of consumption.</p>
<p>In these Reflexions Turgot laid down the theoretical basis of
nineteenth- century capitalism — before the effective organization of
labor. One of the kindest and most honest men of his time could see for
the workers no better future than a subsistence wage. Yet this same man
became a devoted public servant. In August, 1761, he was appointed
intendant — the king’s supervisor — of the generalite of Limoges, one of
the poorest regions of France. He estimated that forty-eight to fifty
per cent of the income of the land went in taxes to the state and tithes
to the Church. The local peasants were sullen, the nobles uncouth. “I
have the misfortune,” he wrote to Voltaire, “of being an intendant. I
say the misfortune, for in this age of quarrels and remon- strances
there is happiness only in living the phi losophic life among one’s
books and friends.” Voltaire answered: “You will win the hearts and the
purses of Limousins… I believe that an intendant is the only person
who</p>
<p>80 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>can be useful. Can he not have the highways repaired, the fields
cultivated, the marshes drained, and can he not encourage
manufactures?”</p>
<p>Turgot did all that. He labored zealously in Limoges for thirteen
years, winning affection from the people and dislike from the nobility.
He repeat- edly — vainly — petitioned the Council of State to reduce the
tax rate. He im- proved the allotment of taxes, remedied injustices,
organized a civil service, freed the trade in grain, and built 450 miles
of roads; they were part of that nationwide road-building program (begun
by the French government in</p>
<ol start="1732" type="1">
<li>to which we owe the lovely tree-shaded highways of France today.
Before Turgot the roads had been built by corvee — the forced and unpaid
labor of the peasantry; he abolished corvee in Limoges, and paid for the
labor by a general tax on all the laity. He persuaded the inhabitants to
grow po- tatoes as human food, instead of only for animals. His vigorous
measures of relief in the famine periods of 1768-72 won universal
admiration.</li>
</ol>
<p>On July 20, 1774, a new King invited him to join the central
government. All France rejoiced, and looked to him as the man who would
save the crumbling state.</p>
<p>V. THE COMMUNISTS</p>
<p>While the physiocrats were laying the theoretical basis of
capitalism, Morelly, Mably, and Linguet were expounding socialism and
communism. As the educated classes surrendered their hopes of heaven
they consoled themselves with earthly substitutes: the well-to-do,
ignoring religious pro- hibitions, indulged themselves with wealth and
power, women and wine and art; the commoners found solace in visions of
a utopia in which the goods of the earth would be equally shared between
simple and clever, weak and strong.</p>
<p>There was no socialist movement in the eighteenth century, no such
defi- nite group as the Levellers in Cromwell’s England, or the
communistic Jes - uits of Paraguay; there were only individuals here and
there adding their voices to a mounting cry that would become, in
“Gracchus” Babeuf, a fac - tor in the French Revolution. We recall that
the priestly skeptic Jean Mes- lier, in his Testament of 1733, pleaded
for a communistic society in which the national product would be equally
shared, and men and women would mate and part as they pleased;
meanwhile, he suggested, it would help if a few kings should be killed.
55 Seven years before this proclamation came to print, Rousseau, in his
second Discourse (1755), denounced private property as the source of all
the evils of civilization; but even in that outburst he dis- claimed any
socialistic program, and by 1762 the heroes of his books were well
equipped with property.</p>
<p>In the same year with Rousseau’s Discourse on the Origin of
Inequality appeared the Code de la nature of an obscure radical of whom,
aside from his books, we know hardly anything but his last name,
Morelly. We must not confuse him with Andre Morellet, whom we have seen
as a contributor to</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>8l</p>
<p>he Encyclopedic. Morelly first roused the wits with a Traite des
qualites d’un grand roi (1751), which pictured a communistic king. In
1753 he gave his dream poetic form as Naufrage des lies flottantes, ou
La Basiliade; here the good ki ng, perhaps after reading Rousseau’s
first Discourse, leads his peo - ple back to a simple and natural life.
The best and fullest exposition of the communistic ideal was Morelly’s
Code de la nature (1755 -60). Many ascribed it to Diderot, and the
Marquis d’Argenson pronounced it superior to Montesquieu’s UEsprit des
lois (1748). Morelly thought, like Rousseau, that man is by nature good,
that his social instincts incline him to good behavior, and that the
laws corrupted him by establishing and protecting private prop- erty. He
praised Christianity for inclining to communism, and mourned that the
Church had sanctioned property. The institution of private property had
generated “vanity, fatuit y, pride, ambition, villainy, hypocrisy,
viciousness… ; everything evil resolves itself into this subtle and
pernicious element, the desire to possess.” 56 Then sophists conclude
that the nature of man makes communism impossible, whereas in real
sequence it was the violation of com- munism that perverted the natural
virtues of man. If it were not for the greed, egoism, rivalries, and
hatreds engendered by private property, men would live together in
peaceful and co-operative brotherhood.</p>
<p>The road to reconstruction must begin by clearing all obstacles to
the free discussion of morals and politics, “allowing full liberty to
wise men to attack</p>
<p>Perhaps Morelly underestimated the natural individualism of men, the
strength of the acquisitive instinct, and the opposition that the hunger
for freedom would offer to the tyranny required for the maintenance of
an un- natural equality. Nevertheless his influence was considerable.
Babeuf de- clared that he had imbibed his communism from Morelly’s Code
de la na - ture, and Charles Fourier probably took from the same source
his plan (1808) for co- operative “phalansteries,” which in turn led to
such comm u- nist experiments as Brook Farm (1841). In Morelly’s Code
occurs the fa - mous principle that came down to inspire and plague the
Russian Revolution: “ chacun selon ses facultes, a chacun selon ses
besoms”— from each according to his ability, to each according to his
needs. 58</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>The philosophies generally rejected Morelly’s system as
impracticable, and accepted private property as an unavoidable
consequence of human nature. But in 1763 Morelly found a vigorous ally
in Simon-Henri Linguet, a lawyer who attacked both law and property.
Disbarred from practice, Linguet pub- lished (1777-92) Annales
politiques, a journal in which he delivered a run- ning fire upon social
abuses. Law, he thought, had become an instrument for legalizing and
maintaining possessions originally won by force or fraud.</p>
<p>Laws are destined above all to safeguard property. Now, as one can
take away much more from the man who has than from him who has not, they
are obviously a guarantee accorded to the rich against the poor. It is
difficult to believe, and yet it is clearly demonstrable, that the laws
are in some respects a conspiracy against the majority of the human
race. 59</p>
<p>Consequently there is an inevitable class war between the owners of
property or capital and the workers who, in competition with one
another, must sell their labor to propertied employers. Linguet scorned
the claims of the phys- iocrats that the liberation of the economy from
state controls would auto- matically bring prosperity; on the contrary,
it would accelerate the con- centration of wealth; prices would rise,
and wages would lag behind. The control of prices by the rich
perpetuates the slavery of the wage earner even after slavery has been
“abolished” by law; “all that they [the former slaves] have gained is to
be constantly tormented by the fear of starvation, a mis- fortune from
which their predecessors in this lowest rank of humanity were at least
exempt”; 60 slaves were lodged and fed all the year round; but in an
uncontrolled economy the employer is free to throw his employees into
beggary whenever he can make no profit from them; then he makes begging
a crime. There is no remedy against all this, Linguet thought, but a
com- munist revolution. He did not recommend it for his time, since it
would lead more likely to anarchy than to justice, but he felt that the
conditions for such a revolt were rapidly taking form.</p>
<p>Never has want been more universal, more murderous for the class
which is condemned to it; never, perhaps, amidst apparent prosperity,
has Europe been nearer to a complete upheaval…. We have reached, by a
directly opposite route, precisely the point which Italy had reached
when the slave war [led by Spartacus] inundated it with blood and
carried fire and slaughter to the very gates of the mistress of the
world. 61</p>
<p>The Revolution came in his time despite his advice, and sent him to
the guillotine ( 1 794).</p>
<p>The Abbe Gabriel Bonnot de Mably kept his head by dying four years
before the Revolution. He came of a prominent family in Grenoble; one of
his brothers was the Jean Bonnot de Mably with whom Rousseau stayed in 1
740; another was the Condillac who made a sensation of psychology. Still
another famous relative, Cardinal de Tencin, tried to make a priest out
of him, but Gabriel stopped short at minor orders, attended the salon of
Mme. de Tencin in Paris, and succumbed to philosophy. In 1748 he
quarreled with</p>

<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>8?</p>
<p>he Cardinal and withdrew into scholarly retirement; thereafter the
only events in his life were his books, all of them once renowned.*</p>
<p>His seven years in Paris and Versailles gave him a knowledge of
politics, of international relations, and of human nature. The result
was a unique mixture of socialistic aspirations with pessimistic doubts.
Mably insisted (con- trary to Machiavelli) that the same moral standards
that are applied to in- dividuals should be applied to the conduct of
states, but he recognized that this would require an enforceable system
of international law. Like Voltaire and Morelly he was a theist without
Christianity, but he believed that moral- ity cannot be maintained
without a religion of supernatural punishments and rewards, for most
persons “are condemned to the permanent infancy of their reason.” 62 He
preferred the Stoic ethics to those of Christ, and the G reek republics
to modern monarchies. He agreed with Morelly in deriving the vices of
man not from nature but from property; this is “the fountainhead of all
the ills that afflict society.” 63 “The passion for enriching oneself
has taken</p>
<p>How much happier and finer would men be if there were no mine and
thine! Mably thought that the Indians were happier under Jesuit
communism in Paraguay than the Frenchmen of his time; that the Swedes
and the Swiss of that age, who had given up the quest for glory and
money and were con- tent with a moderate prosperity, were happier than
the English who were conquering colonies and trade. In Sweden, he
contended, character was held in greater honor than fame, and a modest
contentment was valued above great wealth. 66 Real freedom is possessed
only by those who are not anxious to be rich. In the kind of society
advocated by the physiocrats there would be no happiness, for men would
always be agitated by the desire to equal, in possessions, those more
affluent than themselves.</p>
<p>So Mably concluded that communism is the only social order that will
promote virtue and happiness. “Establish community of goods, and nothing
is thence easier than to establish equality of conditions, and to affirm
on this double foundation the well- being of man.” 67 But how can such
communism be established with men so corrupted as they now are? Here the
skeptic in Mably raises his head, and despondently admits that “no human
force today could re-establish equality without causing greater
disorders than those one</p>

<p>wished to avoid.” 68 Democracy is theoretically splendid, but in
practice it fails through the ignorance and acquisitiveness of the
masses. 69 All that we can do is to hold up communism as an ideal toward
which civilization should gradually and cautiously move, slowly changing
the habits of modern man from competition to co-operation. Our goal
should be not the increase of wealth, nor even the increase of
happiness, but rather the growth of virtue, for only virtue brings
happiness. The first step toward a better government would be the
summoning of a States-General, which should draw up a con- stitution
giving supreme power to a legislative assembly (this was done in
1789-91). The acreage possessed by any one person should be limited;
large estates should be broken up to spread peasant proprietorship;
there should be strict curbs on the inheritance of wealth; and “useless
arts” like painting and sculpture should be banned.</p>
<p>Many of these proposals were adopted in the French Revolution.
Mably’s collected works were published in 1789, again in 1792, again in
1793; and a book published soon after the Revolution listed Helvetius,
Mably, Rousseau, Voltaire, and Franklin, in that order, as the principal
inspirers of that event, and the true saints of the new dispensation.

<li>THE KING</li>
</ol>
<p>Louis XV, so far as he knew them, smiled at these communists as
negligible dreamers, and passed amiably from bed to bed. The court
continued its reck- less gambling and extravagant display; the Prince de
Soubise spent 200,000 livres to entertain the King for one day; and
every “progress” of his Majesty to one of his country seats cost the
taxpayers 1 00,000 livres. Half a hundred dignitaries had their hotels ,
or palaces, at Versailles or Paris, and ten thousand servants labored
proudly to meet the wants and foibles of nobles, prelates, mistresses,
and the royal family. Louis himself had three thousand horses, 2 1 7
carriages, 150 pages garbed in velvet and gold, and thirty physicians to
bleed and purge and poison him. The royal household in one year 1751
spent 68,- 000,000 livres — almost a quarter of the government’s
revenue. 71 The people complained, but for the most part anonymously;
every year a hundred pam- phlets, posters, satirical songs displayed the
King’s unpopularity. “Louis,” said one brochure, “if you were once the
object of our love, it was because</p>
<p>What had led to this transformation of Louis le Bien-Aime into a
despised and insulted king? He himself, aside from his extravagance,
negligence, and adulteries, was not quite as bad as vengeful history has
painted him. He was physically handsome, tall, strong, capable of
hunting all afternoon and en- tertaining women at night. His educators
had spoiled him; Villeroi had given him to understand that all France
belonged to him by inheritance and divine</p>

<p>right. The pride of sovereignty was moderated and confused by the
shadow and tradition of Louis XIV; the young King was obsessed and made
timid by a sense of his inability to meet that august standard of
grandeur and will; he became incapable of resolution, and gladly left
decisions to his ministers. His boyhood reading and his tenacious memory
gave him some acquaintance with history, and he acquired in time a
considerable knowledge of European affairs; through many years he kept
his own secret diplomatic correspond- ence. He was languidly
intelligent, and judged well and mercilessly the char- acter of the men
and women about him. He could keep pace with the best minds in his court
in conversation and wit. But apparently he accepted even the most absurd
dogmas of the theology that Fleury had poured into his youth. Religion
became an intermittent fever with him as he alternated be- tween piety
and adultery. He suffered from fear of death and hell, but gam- bled on
absolution in articulo mortis. He halted the persecution of the Jansen-
ists, and in retrospect we perceive that the philo sophes , on and off,
enjoyed considerable leeway in his reign.</p>
<p>He was sometimes cruel, but more often humane. Pompadour and Du Barry
learned to love him for himself as well as for the power he gave them.
His coldness and taciturnity were part of his shyness and self-distrust;
behind that reserve lay elements of tenderness, which he expressed
especially in his affection for his daughters; these loved him as a
father who gave them every- thing except good example. Usually his
manners were gracious, but at times he was callous, and talked too
calmly about the ailments or approaching death of his courtiers. He
quite forgot to be a gentleman in his abrupt dis- missals of d’Argenson,
Maurepas, and Choiseul; but that too may have been the result of
diffidence; he found it hard to say no to a man’s face. Yet he could
face danger bravely, as in the hunt or at Fontenoy.</p>
<p>Dignified in public, he was pleasant and sociable with his intimate
friends, preparing coffee for them with his own anointed hands. He
observed the complex etiquette that Louis XIV had established for
royalty, but he re- sented the formalism that it laid upon his life.
Often he rose before the official lever , and made his own fire so as
not to awaken the servants; more often he lingered in bed till eleven.
At night, after having been put to bed with the official coucher , he
might slip away to enjoy his mistress or even to visit, incognito, the
town of Versailles. He avoided the artificialities of the court by
hunting; on those days when he did not run off to the chase the
courtiers said, “The King is doing nothing today.” 73 He knew more about
his hounds than about his ministers. He thought that his ministers could
take care of matters better than he could; and when he was warned that
France was mov- ing toward bankruptcy and revolution, he comforted
himself with the thought that u les choses , comme elles sont, dureront
autant que moi” (things as they are will last through my time). 74</p>
<p>Sexually he was a monster of immorality. We can forgive him the
mistress that he took when the Queen was oppressed by his virility; we
can under- stand his fascination with Pompadour, and his sensitivity to
the beauty and grace and bright vivacity of women; but there is little
in royal history so</p>

<p>despicable as his serial passage through the girls prepared for his
bed in the Parc aux Cerfs. The coming of Du Barry was, by comparison, a
return to normalcy.</p>

<li>DU BARRY</li>
</ol>
<p>She began in the Champagne village of Vaucouleurs about 1743 as
Marie- Jeanne Becu, daughter of Mile. Anne Becu, who, it appears, never
revealed the father’s identity. Such mysteries were quite frequent in
the lower classes. In 1748 Anne moved to Paris and became a cook to M.
Dumonceux, who arranged to have Jeanne, aged seven, boarded in the
Convent of St.-Anne. There the pretty girl remained for nine years and,
it seems, not unhappily; she kept pleasant memories of this well-ordered
nunnery, received instruction in reading, writing, and embroidery, and
retained throughout her life a sim- ple and unquestioning piety, and a
reverence for nuns and priests; the shelter that she gave to hunted
priests in the Revolution shared in leading her to the guillotine.
75</p>
<p>When she emerged from the convent she took as her surname that of her
mother’s new mate, M. Ran£on. She was sent to a hairdresser to learn his
art, but this included seduction, and Jeanne, irresistibly beautiful,
knew not how to resist. Her mother transferred her to Mme. de La Garde
as a companion, but Madame’s visitors paid too much attention to Jeanne,
and she was soon dismissed. The millinery shop in which she became a
salesgirl attracted an unusual number of male patrons. She became the
kept woman of a succession of rakes. In 1 763 she was taken up by Jean
du Barry, a gambler who procured women for aristocratic roues. Under the
elegant name of Jeanne de Vauber- nier she served this pimp for five
years as hostess at his parties, and added some refinement to her
charms. Du Barry thought that he too, like Mme. Poisson, had discovered
a “morsel for the King.”</p>
<p>In 17 66 good King Stanislas died in Lorraine, which thereby became a
province of France. His daughter, Marie Leszczinska, the modest, pious
Queen of France, fell into a rapid decline after his death, for their
mutual love had upheld her in her long servitude to a faithless husband
in an alien environment; and on June 24, 1768, she passed away, mourned
even by the King. He gave his daughters hope that he would take no more
mistresses. But in July he saw Jeanne, who happened to be straying
through the Palace of Versailles as innocently as La Pompadour had
driven in the Senart hunting park twenty-four years before.</p>
<p>He was struck by her voluptuous beauty, her gaiety and playfulness;
here was someone who could amuse him again, and warm his cold and
melancholy heart. He sent his valet Lebel for her; “Comte” du Barry
readily agreed to part with her for a royal consideration. To appease
appearances Louis in- sisted that the girl should have a husband. The
“Comte” married her in short time to his brother Guillaume, the real but
impoverished Comte du Barry, who was brought from Levignac in Gascony
for the purpose. Jeanne bade</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>him farewell immediately after the ceremony (September 1, 1768), and
never saw him again. Guillaume was awarded a pension of five thousand
livres. He took a mistress of his own, carried her off to Levignac,
lived with her there for twenty-five years, and married her on learning
that his wife had been guillotined.</p>
<p>Jeanne, new-named Comtesse du Barry, joined the King secretly at Com-
piegne, then publicly at Fontainebleau. The Due de Richelieu asked Louis
what he saw in this new toy. “Only this,” his Majesty answered, “that
she makes me forget that soon I shall be sixty.” 76 The courtiers were
horrified. They could readily understand a man’s need of a mistress; but
to take a woman whom several of them had known as a prostitute, and
elevate her to a place above marepises and duchesses! Choiseul had hoped
to offer his sister to the King as maitresse en titre; this rejected
lady goaded her usually cau- tious brother into open hostility to the
pretty upstart, and La Barry never forgave him.</p>
<p>The new mistress was soon swimming in livres and gems. The King dow-
ered her with a pension of 1,300,000 francs, plus an annuity of 150,000
more, levied on the city of Paris and the state of Burgundy. Jewelers
hurried to supply her with rings, necklaces, bracelets, tiaras, and
other sparkling adorn- ments, for which they billed the King 2,000,000
francs in four years. Alto- gether, in those four years, she cost the
treasury 6,000,375 livres. 77 The people of Paris heard of her
brilliance, and mourned that a new Pompadour had come to swallow their
taxes.</p>
<p>On April 22, 1769, entering in a blaze of jewelry and on the arm of
Riche- lieu, she was formally presented at court. The men admired her
charms, the women received her as coldly as they dared. She bore these
slights quietly, and appeased some courtiers by the modesty of her
behavior and the melodi- ous laughter with which she regaled the King.
Even to her enemies (except Choiseul) she showed no malice; she gained
favor by bending his Majesty to issue pardons more frequently than
before. Bit by bit she gathered around her titled men and women who used
her intercession with the King. Like Pompadour, she took good care of
her relatives; she bought property and title for her mother, and secured
pensions for her aunt and her cousins. She paid the debts of Jean du
Barry, gave him a fortune, and bought for him a sump- tuous villa at
L’Isle -Jourdain. She herself won from the King the Chateau of
Louveciennes, which the Prince and Princesse de Lamballe had occupied,
on the edge of the royal park at Marly. She engaged the greatest
architect of that generation, Jacques-Ange Gabriel, to remodel the
chateau to her con- venience, and the meticulous cabinetmaker Pierre
Gouthiere to decorate it with furniture and objects of art to the value
of 756,000 livres.</p>
<p>She lacked the background of education and association that had made
Pompadour a willing and discriminating patron of literature, philosophy,
and art. But she collected a library of well-bound books, from Homer to
por- nography, from Pascal’s pious Pensees to Fragonard’s spicy
illustrations; and in 1773 she sent her homage and portrait to Voltaire
with “a kiss for each cheek.” He replied with a poem, as clever as
ever:</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>Quoi! deux baisers sur la fin de ma vie!</p>

<p>Je serai mort de plaisir au premier.* 78</p>
<p>She asked Louis XV to let Voltaire return to Paris; he refused; she
had to content herself with buying an assortment of watches from Ferney.
In 1778, when the old Master came to Paris to die, she was among the
many who climbed the stairs in the Rue de Beaune to pay her respects to
him. He was charmed, and ended by rising from his bed to escort her to
the door. On the way down she met Jacques-Pierre Brissot, the future
revolutionist; he was hoping to submit to Voltaire a manuscript on
criminal law; he had sought entry the day before and had been refused;
he was trying again. She led him back to Voltaire’s door, and arranged
for his admittance. In his Memoir es he recalled her “smile so full of
warmth and kindness.” 79</p>
<p>She was unquestionably good-natured and generous. She bore without
recrimination the enmity of the royal family, and the refusal of Marie
Antoinette to speak to her. Choiseul alone she could not forgive, and
that was because he never ceased his efforts to drive her from the
court. Soon he or she would have to go.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>CHOISEUL</li>
</ol>
<p>He came of an old Lorraine family, and was already in early life the
Comte de Stainville. He earned distinction for his bravery in the War of
the Aus- trian Succession. In 1750, aged thirty-one, he replenished the
fortunes of his family by marrying a wealthy heiress. His brilliant mind
and gay wit soon won him prominence at court, but he interrupted his
rise by opposing Pom- padour. In 1752 he changed sides and gained her
gratitude by revealing to her a plot to get her dismissed. She secured
his appointment as ambassador to Rome, then to Vienna. In 1758 he was
summoned to Paris to replace Bernis as minister for foreign affairs, and
was made a duke and peer of France. In 1761 he transferred his ministry
to his brother Cesar, but continued to direct foreign policy; he himself
took the ministries of war and marine. He became so powerful that at
times he overruled and intimidated the King. 80 He re- built both the
army and the navy; he reduced speculation and corruption in military
payments and supplies, restored discipline in the ranks, and re- placed
superannuated dignity with untitled competence in the officer corps. He
developed French colonies in the West Indies, and added Corsica to the
French crown. He sympathized with the philosophies, defended the
publica- tion of the Encyclopedie, supported the expulsion of the
Jesuits (1764), and winked at the reorganization of the Huguenots in
France. He protected Voltaire’s security at Ferney, furthered his
campaign for the Calas family, and won from Diderot an apostrophe of
praise: “Great Choiseul, you watch sleeplessly over the fortunes of the
Fatherland.” 81</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>All in all, his policies rescued France in modest measure from the
disaster brought upon her by the Austrian mesalliance. He reduced the
subsidies that France habitually paid to Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark,
and some German princes. He encouraged the efforts of Charles III to
bring Spain into the eighteenth century, and sought to strengthen both
France and Spain by the Pacte de Famille (1761) between the Bourbon
kings. The plan went awry, but Choiseul negotiated peace with England on
much better terms than the military situation appeared to support. He
foresaw the revolt of the English colonies in America, and strengthened
the French position in St.-Domingue, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French
Guiana, in the hope of establishing a new colonial domain that would
compensate France for the loss of Canada. The two Napoleons adopted the
same policy in 1803 and 1863.</p>
<p>Against these achievements we must weigh his failure to stop the
Russian penetration of Poland, and his insistence upon leading France
and Spain into renewed hostilities with England. Louis had had enough of
war, and gave an open mind to those who were working for Choiseul’s
fall. The clever Minister charmed many by his courtesy to courtiers, his
prodigal entertain- ment of friends, and his resourcefulness and
industry in the service of France; but he intensified rivalries into
enmities by open criticism and careless speech, and his unabated
opposition to Du Barry gave his foes an intimate access to the King. The
inexhaustible Richelieu supported Du Barry, and his nephew the Due
d’Aiguillon itched to replace Choiseul as head of the government. The
royal family, resenting Choiseul’s activity against the Jesuits, conde -
scended to use the scorned mistress as a tool in deposing the impious
Minister.</p>
<p>Louis repeatedly asked him to avoid war with England and with Du</p>
<p>Barry; Choiseul continued secretly to plot war and openly to scorn
the mis- tress. Finally she joined all her forces against him. On
December 24, 1770, the irritated King sent a curt message to Choiseul:
“My cousin, my dissatis - faction with your services compels me to exile
you to Chanteloupe, to which you shall take yourself within the next
twenty- four hours.” Most of the court, shocked by so abrupt a dismissal
of one who had done great things for France, dared the royal ire by
expressing their sympathy for the fallen Minister. Many nobles rode off
to Chanteloupe to solace Choiseul in his exile. It was a comfortable
banishment, for the Duke’s estate included one of the finest palaces and
most spacious private parks in France; and it was placed in Touraine,
not far from Paris. There Choiseul lived in state and elegance, for Du
Barry induced the King to send him 300,000 livres at once, and a pledge
of 60,000 livres per year. 82 The philosophes mourned his fall; “ Tout
est perdu!” cried the diners chez d’Holbach, and Diderot described them
as melting in tears.</p>

<p>Marie Terray was controleur des finances. Terray gave Du Barry all
the funds that she demanded; otherwise, however, he reduced expenditures
he- roically. He suspended amortization, and lowered the rate of
interest on governmental obligations; he devised new taxes, dues, and
fees, and doubled the tolls on internal transport; altogether he saved
36,000,000 livres, and added 15,000,000 to income. In effect he delayed
financial collapse by partial bankruptcy, but many men suffered through
governmental defaults, and added their voices to an unsettling
discontent. Soon the deficit grew again, and reached 40,000,000 livres
in the last year of the reign (1774). What would today seem to be a
modest national debt for a nation with fiscal stabil- ity was an added
cause for anxiety to those who had lent money to the government, and who
now heard with less hostility the mounting cries for change.</p>
<p>The culminating crisis in the final decade of Louis XV was the
struggle of his ministers to preserve the absolute power of the king
against the active rebellion of the parlements. These (as we have seen)
were not representative or legislative bodies like the British
Parliament; they were judicial chambers serving as appellate courts in
thirteen cities of France. In addition, like the English Parliament
versus Charles I, they claimed to defend, against royal absolutism, the
“fundamental law,” or established customs, of their regions; and since
the Regent Philippe d’Orleans had confirmed their “right of re -
monstrance” against royal or ministerial edi cts, they advanced to the
claim that no such edict could become law unless they accepted and
registered it.</p>
<p>If the parlements had been elected by the people, or by an educated
and propertied minority (as in Britain) , they might have served as a
transition to democracy, and in some measure they were a wholesome check
upon the central government; generally, therefore, the people supported
them in their conflicts with the king. Actually, however, the
parlements, almost entirely composed of rich lawyers, were among the
most conservative forces in France. As the “nobility of the robe,” these
lawyers became as exclusive as the “nobility of the sword”; “parlement
after parlement decreed that new posts carrying nobility were to be
restricted to… families already no- ble.” 83 The Paris Parlement was the
most conservative of all. It competed with the clergy in opposing
freedom of thought or publication; it banned, and sometimes burned, the
books of the philosophes. It had been won to Jansen- ism, which brought
a Calvinist theology into the Catholic Church. Voltaire noted that the
Jansenist Parlement of Toulouse tortured and killed Jean Calas, and that
the Parlement of Paris approved the execution of La Barre, while the
ministry of Choiseul reversed the Calas judgment and protected the
Encyclopedists.</p>
<p>Christophe de Beaumont, archbishop of Paris, aggravated the conflict
be- tween the Jansenists and the orthodox Catholics by ordering the
clergy under his jurisdiction to administer the sacraments only to
persons who had con- fessed to a non-Jansenist priest. The Paris
Parlement, with wide public ap- proval, forbade the priests to obey this
order; it accused the Archbishop of fomenting a schism, and s eized some
of his temporal possessions. The King’s</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE LIFE OF THE STATE 91</p>
<p>Council of State called this procedure illegally confiscatory, and
bade the Parlement withdraw from religious disputes. The Parlement
refused; on the contrary, i t drew up “Grandes Remontrances” (May 4,
1753) which in a degree foreshadowed the Revolution: they professed
loyalty to the King, but told him that “if subjects owe obedience to
kings, these on their side owe obedience to the laws”; 84 the
implication w as that the Parlement, as guardian and interpreter of the
law, would act as a supreme court over the king. On May 9 the Council of
State issued lettres de cachet banishing most members of the Paris
Parlement from the capital. The provincial parlements and the people of
Paris rose to the support of the exiles. The Marquis d’Argenson noted,
in December, that “the Parisians are in a state of subdued excite -
ment.” 85 The government, fearing a popular rising, ordered its soldiery
to patrol the streets and protect the house of the Archbishop. In March,
1754, d’Argenson wrote: “Everything is preparing for civil war.” 86
Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld devised a face-saving compromise; the
government re- called the exiles (September 7), but ordered the
Parlement and the clergy to refrain from further dispute. The order was
not obeyed. The Archbishop of Paris continued his campaign against
Jansenism, and so vigorously that Louis banished him to Conflans
(December 3). The Parlement declared that the papal bull against
Jansenism was not a rule of faith, and bade the clergy ignore it. The
government vacillated, but finally, needing a loan from the clergy to
prosecute the Seven Years’ War, it ordered the Parlement to accept</p>
<p>The violent debate turned many heads. On January 5, 1757, Robert-
Francois Damiens attacked the King in a Versailles street, and stabbed
him with a large penknife; then he stood by, awaiting arrest. Louis told
his negli- gent bodyguard, “Secure him, but let no one do him any harm.”
87 The wound proved minor, and the assailant claimed: “I had no
intention to kill the King. I might have done this had I been so
inclined. I did it only that God might touch the King’s heart, and work
on him to restore things to their former footing.” 88 In a letter from
prison to the King he repeated that “the Archbishop of Paris is the
cause of all the disturbance about the sacraments, by having refused
them.” 89 He had (he said) been aroused by the speec hes he had heard in
the Parlement; “if I had never entered a court of justice… I should
never have gotten here.” 90 Those speeches had so excited him that he
had sent for a physician to come and bleed him; none came; had he been
bled (he claimed), he would not have attacked the King. 91 The Grand’
Chambre of the Parlement tried, convicted, and sentenced him, and con-
demned his father, mother, and sister to perpetual banishment. Damiens
suf- fered the tortures prescribed by law for regicides: his flesh was
torn by red- hot pincers, he was splashed with boiling lead, he was torn
apart by four horses (March 28, 1757). Highborn ladies paid for points
of vantage from which to see the operation. The King expressed disgust
with the tortures, and sent pensions to the banished family.</p>
<p>The attempt won some sympathy for the King: Jews and Protestants
joined in prayers for his speedy recovery; but when it was learned that
the</p>

<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>wound was, in Voltaire’s phrase, only a “pinprick” ( piqure
d’epingle), the tide of public support turned back to the Parlement.
People began to discuss representative government versus absolute
monarchy. “They see in the - not be violated without violating that law
by which the kings themselves exist.” 92 The Parlement of Toulouse went
further, declaring that the law required “the free consent of the
nation”; 93 but by “nation” it meant the parlements. On July 23, 1763,
an important judicial body, the Cour des Aides, under the presidency of
the brave and honest Malesherbes, submitted to the King a report on
national poverty and the incompetence and corrup- tion in the
administration of the national finances; it begged him to “listen to</p>
<p>In the crucial struggle that resulted in the expulsion of the Jesuits
from France (1764) 95 the Paris Parlement seized the offensive, and
forced the hand of the King. In June and November the Parlement of
Rennes, supreme judi- cial court of Brittany, dispatched strong
remonstrances to Louis against the oppressive taxes levied by the Due
d’Aiguillon, then governor of the prov - ince. Receiving no
satisfaction, it suspended its sittings, and most of its mem- bers
resigned (May, 1765). Its procureur general, Louis-Rene de La Chalo-
tais, published an attack upon the central government. He, his son, and
three counselors were arrested and charged with sedition. The King
ordered the Rennes Parlement to try them; it refused, and all the
parlements of France, backed by public opinion, supported the refusal.
On March 3, 1766, Louis appeared before the Parlement of Paris, warned
it against conniving at sedi- tion, and proclaimed his resolve to rule
as an absolute monarch.</p>
<p>In my person alone resides the sovereign power…. To me alone belongs
the legislative power, unconditional and undivided. All public order
emanates from me. Mv people and I are one, and the rights and interests
of the nation, which some dare to make a body separate from the monarch,
are necessarily united with mine, and rest in my hands alone. 96</p>
<p>His vows, he added, had been not to the nation, as the Parlement
asserted, but only to God. The Parlement of Paris continued to defend
that of Rennes, but on March 20 it officially accepted, as “inevitable
maxims,” the doctrine that “the sovereignty belongs t o the king alone;
he is accountable only to God;… the legislative power resides entirely
in the person of the sover- eign.” 97 Choiseul and others urged the King
to make responsive concessions. La Chalotais and his fellow prisoners
were released, but were exiled to Saintes, near La Rochelle. D’Aiguillon
was recalled from Brittany, and joined Choiseul’s foes. The Parlement of
Rennes resumed its sittings (July, 1769).</p>
<p>Voltaire entered the conflict by issuing in 1769 his Histoire du
Parlement de Paris, par M. I’abbe Big. He denied authorship of the book,
and wrote a letter criticizing it as “a masterpiece of errors and
awkwardness, a crime</p>

<p>agains t the language”; 98 even so, it was his. Though written in
haste, it showed considerable historical research, but it lacked
impartiality; it was a long arraignment of the Parlement as a
reactionary institution that had at every turn opposed progressive
measures — e.g., the establishment of the French Academy, inoculation
for smallpox, and free administration of jus- tice. Voltaire accused the
parlements of class legislation, superstition, and religious
intolerance. They had condemned the earliest printers in France; they
had applauded the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre; they had sentenced the
Marechal d’Ancre to be burned as a witch. They had been instituted, said
Voltaire, for purely judicial functions, and had no authority to
legislate; if they took this authority they would replace the autocracy
of the king with an oligarchy of rich lawyers, entrenched beyond any
popular control. Vol- taire had written this long brief during the
ascendancy of Choiseul, whose liberal tendencies encouraged the belief
that progress could most readily be made through a king enlightened by
an enlightened minister. Diderot did not agree with Voltaire; he argued
that however reactionary the parlements had been, their claim of the
right to supervise legislation served as a desirable check on royal
tyranny. 99</p>
<p>The return of d’Aiguillon to Paris brought on a new crisis. The
Parlement</p>
<p>The multiplicity of the actions of an absolute power exercised
everywhere against the spirit and letter of the constitutive laws of the
monarchy is un- equivocal proof of a premeditated project to change the
form of government, and to substitute, for the always equal force of the
laws, the irregular actions of arbitrary power. 100</p>
<p>Then the Parlement adjourned till December 3.</p>
<p>Maupeou used the interval to prepare an uncompromising defense of
royal power. On November 27 he issued, over the King’s signature, a
decree that, while admitting the right of remonstrance, forbade any
rejection of an edict renewed after remonstrances had been heard. The
Parlement replied by re- questing the King to surrender the evil
counselors of the throne to the ven- geance of the laws. 101 On December
7 Louis summoned the Parlement to Versailles, and in an official lit de
justice he bade them accept and register the November 27 decree. On
returning to Paris the magistrates decided to ab-</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>stain from all functions of the Parlement until the November decree
should be withdrawn. Louis ordered them to resume their sittings; the
order was ignored. Choiseul tried to make peace at home to wage better
war abroad; Louis dismissed him; now Maupeou dominated the Council of
State while Du Barry fluttered about the King. She showed him Vandyck’s
portrait of England’s Charles I, and warned him of a like fate: “Your
Parlement too will cut off your head.” 102</p>
<p>On January 3, 1771, Louis again ordered the acceptance of the
November edict. The Parlement replied that the edict violated the basic
laws of France. On January 20, between one and four o’clock in the
morning, the musketeers of the King delivered to each magistrate a
lettre de cachet giving him a choice between obedience and exile from
Paris. The great majority of them pro- tested love of the King, but
remained obdurate. Within the next two days 165 members of the Paris
Parlement were banished to divers parts of France. The people cheered
them as they left their Palais de Justice.</p>
<p>Maupeou now moved to supplant the parlements with a new judicial or-
ganization. By a royal decree he set up in Paris a supreme court
composed of the Council of State and some complaisant jurists; and at
Arras, Blois, Chalons, Clermont-Ferrand, Lyons, and Poitiers he
established conseils su- perieurs as appellate courts for the provinces.
Some judiciary abuses were reformed, venality was interrupted, justice
was henceforth to be adminis- tered without charge. Voltaire hailed the
reforms and rashly predicted: “I am absolutely sure that the Chancellor
will carry off a complete victory, and that the people will love it.”
103 But the people could not contentedly accept</p>
<p>Almost without willing it the parlements, despite their conservatism,
were caught up in a ferment of revolutionary ideas. The Discourses of
Rousseau, the communism of Morelly, the proposals of Mably, the secret
meetings of Freemasons, the Encyclopedia’s exposure of abuses in the
government and the Church, the flock of pamphlets circulating through
the capital and the provinces: all these stood in violent opposition to
the claim of absolute power and divine right by a do-nothing and
sexually promiscuous King. “M. Tout le Monde”— i.e., public opinion —
was on the move as a force in history.</p>
<p>Until 1750 the brunt of criticism had fallen upon the Church, but
there- after, goaded by the suppression of the Ency clopedie , it fell
increasingly upon the state. Wrote Horace Walpole from Paris in October,
1765 :</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE STATE</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>Laughing is out of fashion…. Good folks, they have no time to laugh.
There is God and the King to be pulled down first; and men and women,
great and small, are devoutly engaged in the demolition…. Do you know
who the philosophes are, or what the term means here? In the first
place, it compre- hends almost everybody; and, in the next, means men
who, vowing war against popery, aim, many of them, at a subversion of
all religion, and still many more at the destruction of regal power.
105</p>
<p>This, of course, was an exaggeration; most of the philosophes
(Diderot particularly excepted) were supporters of monarchy, and fought
shy of revolution. They attacked the nobility and all hereditary
privilege; they pointed out a hundred abuses and called for reform; but
they shuddered at the thought of giving all power to the people. 106
Nevertheless Grimm wrote in his Correspondance for January, 1 768:</p>
<p>The general weariness with Christianity, which is manifested in all
parts, and especially in Catholic states; the disquiet which is vaguely
agitating the minds of men, and leading them to attack religious and
political abuses — [all this] is a phenomenon characteristic of our
century, as the spirit of reform was of the sixteenth, and it
foreshadows an imminent and inevitable revolution. 107</p>
<p>X. THE KING DEPARTS</p>
<p>Louis XV, like Louis XIV, lacked the art of dying in due time. He
knew that France was waiting for him to disappear, but he could not bear
to think of death. The Austrian ambassador reported in 1773: “From time
to time the King remarks concerning his age, health, and the frightful
account that he must one day render to the Supreme Being.” 108 Louis was
transiently touched by the retirement of his daughter Louise-Marie to a
Carmelite convent, al- legedly to atone for her father’s sins; there, we
are to ld, she scrubbed floors and washed laundry. When he came to see
her she reproved him for his way of life, begged him to dismiss Du
Barry, marry the Princesse de Lamballe, and make his peace with God.</p>
<p>Several of his friends died in the final years of the reign; two of
them, their hearts failing, fell dead at his feet. 109 Yet he seemed to
take a macabre pleas- ure in reminding aged courtiers of their
approaching demise. “Souvre,” he said to one of his generals, “you are
growing old; where do you wish to be buried?” “Sire,” answered Souvre,
“at the feet of your Majesty.” We are told that the reply “made the King
gloomy and pensive.” 110 Mme. du Hausset thought that “a more melancholy
man was never born.” 111</p>
<p>The King’s death was a long -delayed revenge unwittingly taken by the
sex that he had adored and debased. When his lust found even Du Barry
inadequate, he took into his bed a girl so young as to be barely nubile;
she carried the germs of smallpox, and infected the King. On April 29,
1774, the disease began to mark him. His three daughters insisted on
staying with him and nursing him, though they had acquired no immunity.
(They all con- tracted the disease, but recovered.) At night they left,
and Du Barry took their place. But on May 5 the King, wishing to receive
the sacraments, gently dismissed her: “I realize now that I am seriously
ill. The scandal of Metz</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>must not be repeated. I owe myself to God and to my people. So we
must part. Go to the Due d’Aiguillon’s chateau at Rueil, and await
further orders. Please believe that I shall always hold you in the most
affectionate regard.” 112 On May 7 the King, in a formal ceremony before
the court, declared that he repented of having given scandal to his
subjects; but he maintained that he “owed no accounting of his conduct
to anyone but God.” 113 At last he welcomed death. “Never in my life,”
he told his daughter Adelaide, “have I felt happier.” 114 He passed away
on May 10, 1774, aged sixty-four, having reigned fifty-nine years. His
corpse, which infected the air, was hurried to the royal vaults at
St.-Denis without pomp, and amid the sarcasms of the crowd that lined
the route. Once more, as in 1715, France rejoiced at the death of her
king.</p>
