<p>3ob.c.-a.d. 18</p>
<p>I. THE AUGUSTAN STIMULUS</p>
<p>I F peace and security are more favorable than war to the production
of literature and art, yet war and profound social disturbances turn up
the earth about the plants of thought and nourish the seeds that mature
in peace. A quiet life does not make great ideas or great men; but the
compulsions of crisis, the imperatives of survival, weed out dead things
by the roots and quicken the growth of new ideas and ways. Peace after
successful war has all the stimulus of a rapid convalescence; men then
rejoice at mere being, and sometimes break into song.</p>
<p>The Romans were grateful to Augustus because he had cured, even if by
a major operation, the cancer of chaos that had been consuming their
civic life. They were astonished to find themselves rich so soon after
devastation; and they were elated to note that despite their recent
defenseless disorder they were still masters of what seemed to them the
world. They looked back upon their history, from the first to this
second Romulus, from creator to restorer, and judged it epically
wonderful; they were hardly surprised when Virgil and Horace put their
gratitude, their glory, and their pride into verse, and Livy into prose.
Better still, the region they had conquered was only partly barbarous; a
large area of it was the realm of Hellenistic culture — of refined
speech, subtle literature, enlightening science, mature</p>
<p>Money was passing down, even to poets and artists, from the captors
of Egypt’s treasure, the absentee owners of Italy’s soil, and the
exploiters of the Empire’s resources and trade. Writers dedicated their
works to rich men in the hope of receiving gifts that would finance
their further toil; so Horace addressed his odes to Sallust, Aelius
Lamia, Manlius Torquatus, and Mun- atius, Plancus. Messala Corvinus
gathered about him a coterie of authors</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>234 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>whose star was Tibullus, and Maecenas redeemed his wealth and poetry
by presents to Virgil, Horace, and Propertius. Until his final irascible
years, Augustus followed a liberal policy toward literature; he was glad
to have letters and art take up the energies that had disturbed
politics; he would pay men to write books if they would let him govern
the state. His generosity to poets became so renowned that a swarm of
them buzzed around him wherever he went. When a Greek persisted, day
after day, in pressing verses into his hand as he left his palace,
Augustus retaliated by stopping, composing some lines of his own, and
having an attendant give them to the Greek. The latter offered the
Emperor a few denarii and expressed his regret that he could not give
more. Augustus rewarded his wit, not his poetry, with 100,000 sesterces.
1</p>
<p>The stream of books swelled now to proportions unknown before.
Everyone from fool to philosopher wrote poetry. 2 Since all poetry, and
most literary prose, were designed to be read aloud, gatherings were
formed at which authors read their productions to invited or general
audiences or, in rare moments of tolerance, to one another. Juvenal
thought that a compelling reason for living in the country was to escape
the poets who infested Rome. 8 In the bookshops that crowded a district
called the Argiletum, writers assembled to compute literary genius,
while impecunious bibliophiles furtively read snatches of the books they
could not buy. Placards on the walls announced new titles and their
cost. Small volumes sold for four or five sesterces, average volumes for
ten (.50); elegant editions l ike Martial’s epigrams, usually
illustrated with a portrait of the author, brought some five denarii ().
4 Books were exported to all parts of the Empire, or were published
simultaneously in Rome, Lyons, Athens, and Alexandria; 411 Martial was
pleased to learn that he was bought and sold in Britain. Even poets now
had private libraries; Ovid affectionately describes his. 5 We gather
from Martial that there were already book fanciers who collected de luxe
editions, or rare manuscripts. Augustus established two public
libraries; Tiberius, Vespasian, Domitian, Trajan, and Hadrian built
others; by the fourth century there were twenty-eight in Rome. Foreign
students and writers came to study in these libraries and in public
archives; so Dionysius came from Halicarnassus, and Di- odorus from
Sicily. Rome was now the rival of Alexandria as the literary center of
the Western world.</p>
<p>This efflorescence transformed both literature and society. Letters
and the arts took on new dignity. Grammarians lectured on living
authors; people sang snatches from them in the streets. Writers mingled
with states- men and highborn ladies in luxurious salons such as history
would never know again until the flowering of France. The aristocracy
became literary, literature became aristocratic. The lusty vigor of
Ennius and Plautus, Lucre-</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>ius and Catullus, was exchanged for a delicate beauty, or a teasing
com- plexity, in expression and thought. Writers ceased to mingle with
the people, ceased therefore to describe their ways or speak their
language; a divorce set in between literature and life that finally
sucked the sap and spirit out of Latin letters. Forms were set by Greek
models, themes by Greek tradition or Augustus’ court. Poetry, when it
could spare time from Theocritean shepherds or Anacreontic love, was to
sing didactically the joys of agriculture, the morality of ancestors,
the glory of Rome, and the splendor of its gods. Literature became a
handmaiden of statesmanship, a polyphonic sermon calling the nation to
Augustan ideas.</p>
<p>Two forces opposed this conscription of letters by the state. One was
Horace’s hated and “profane crowd,” which liked the salty tang and inde
- pendence of the old satires and plays rather than the curled and
perfumed beauty of the new. The other was that demimonde of jollity and
sin to which Clodia and Julia belonged. This younger set was in full
rebellion against the Julian laws, wanted no moral reform, had its own
poets, circles, and norms. In letters as in life the two forces fought
each other, crossing in Tibullus and Propertius, matching the chaste
piety of Virgil with the obscene audacities of Ovid, crushing two Julias
and one poet with exile, and at last exhausting each other in the Silver
Age. But the ferment of great events, the releasing leisure of wealth
and peace, the majesty of a world acknowledging Rome’s sway, overcame
the corrosion of state subsidies and produced a Golden Age whose
literature was the most perfect, in form and utterance, in all the
memory of men.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>VIRGIL</li>
</ol>
<p>The most lovable of Romans was bom in 70 b.c. on a farm near Mantua,
where the river Mincio wanders slowly toward the Po. The capital would
henceforth give birth to very few great Romans; they would come from
Italy in the century that was divided by the birth of Christ, and
thereafter from the provinces. Perhaps Virgil’s veins contained some
Celtic blood, for Mantua had long been peopled by Gauls; technically he
was a Gaul by birth, for it was only twenty-one years later that
Cisalpine Gaul received the Roman franchise from Caesar. The man who
most eloquently sang the majesty and destiny of Rome would never show
the hard masculinity of the Roman stock, but would touch Celtic strings
of mysticism, tenderness, and grace rare in the Roman breed.</p>
<p>His father saved enough as a court clerk to buy a farm and raise
bees.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>In that murmurous quietude the poet spent his boyhood; the full
foliage of the well-watered north lingered in his later memory, and he
was never really happy away from those fields and streams. At twelve he
was sent to school at Cremona, at fourteen to Milan, at sixteen to Rome.
There he studied rhetoric and allied subjects under the same man who was
to teach Octavian. Probably after this he attended the lectures of Siro
the Epicurean at Naples. Virgil tried hard to accept the philosophy of
pleasure, but his rural background had ill-equipped him. He seems to
have returned north after his education, for in 41 b.c. we find him
swimming for life to escape a soldier who seized by force his father’s
farm; Octavian and Antony had confiscated it because the region had
favored their enemies. Asinius Pollio, the learned governor of Cisalpine
Gaul, tried to have the farm returned, but failed. He atoned by giving
his patronage to the young man, and en- couraging him to continue the
Eclogues he was composing.</p>
<p>By the year 37 Virgil was drinking in the wine of fame in Rome.
The</p>
<p>Eclogues (“Selections”) had just been published and had been well
received; some verses had been recited on the stage by an actress and
had been enthusiastically applauded. 6 The poems were pastoral sketches
in the man- ner, sometimes the phrases, of Theocritus, beautiful in
style and rhythm, the most melodious hexameters that Rome had yet heard,
full of pensive tenderness and romantic love. The youth of the capital
had been long enough detached from the soil to idealize country life;
everyone was pleased to imagine himself a shepherd moving with his
flocks up and down the Apen- nine slopes, and breaking his heart with
love unreturned.</p>
<p>Realer than these Theocritan ghosts were the rural scenes. Here, too,
Virgil idealized, but he did not have to imitate. He had heard the wood-
man’s lusty song and the hovering restlessness of bees; 8 and he had
known the emptyhearted despair of the farmer who, like thousands then,
had lost his land. 9 Above all, he felt intensely the hopes of the age
for an end to faction and war. The Sibylline Books had predicted that
after the Age of Iron the Golden Age of Saturn would return. When, in 40
b.c., a son was bom to Virgil’s patron, Asinius Pollio, the poet
announced in his Fourth Eclogue that this birth would usher in
utopia:</p>
<p>Ultima Cumaei venit iamcarminis aetas;</p>
<p>magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo.</p>
<p>Iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Satumia regna;</p>
<p>iam nova progenies, caelo demittitur alto.</p>
<p>Tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum</p>
<p>desinet, ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,</p>
<p>casta fave Lucina; tuus iam regnat Apollo —</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>*37</p>
<p>“Now comes the final age [announced] in the Cumean [Sibyl’s] chant;
the great succession of epochs is bom anew. Now the Virgin * returns,
the reign of Saturn returns; now a new race descends from heaven on
high. O chaste Lucina [goddess of births]! smile upon the boy just bom,
in whose time the race of iron shall first cease, and a race of gold
shall arise throughout the world. Thine own Apollo i s now king.”</p>
<p>Ten years later these prophecies were fulfilled. The iron tools of
war were laid aside; a new generation took charge, armed and infatuated
with gold. Through the brief remainder of Virgil’s life Rome would know
no further turmoil; prosperity and happiness increased, and Augustus was
hailed as a savior, though not an Apollo. The quasi-royal court welcomed
the optimism of the poet’s verse; Maecenas invited him, liked him, and
saw in him a popular instrument of Octavian’s reforms. This jud gment
showed insight; for to all appearances Virgil, now thirty-three, was an
awkward rustic, shy to the point of stammering, shunning any public
place where he might be recognized and pointed out, ill at ease in the
voluble and aggressive fashionable society of Rome. Besides, even more
than Octavian, he was an invalid, suffering from headaches, throat
ailments, stomach dis- orders, and frequent spitting of blood. Virgil
never married, and seems to have felt no more than his Aeneas the full
abandon of love. Apparently he consoled himself for a time with the
affection of a boy slave; for the rest he was known, at Naples, as “the
virgin.” 10</p>
<p>Maecenas treated the youth generously, had Octavian restore his farm,
and suggested to him some poems glorifying agricultural life. At that
moment (37 b.c.) Italy was paying a penalty for letting so much of her
soil go to pasturage, orchards, and vines; Sextus Pompey was blocking
the import of food from Sicily and Africa, and a shortage of grain
threatened another revolution. City life was enervating the young
manhood of Italy; from every standpoint the health of the nation seemed
to require the restora- tion of farming. Virgil readily agreed; he knew
rural life; and though too frail now to bear its hardships, he was just
the man to paint its attractive features with affectionate memory. He
hid himself in Naples, and after seven years of file work emerged with
his most perfect poems, the Georgies —literally “the labor of the land.”
Maecenas was delighted, and brought Virgil south with him to meet
Octavian, then (29 b.c.) returning from his victory over Cleopatra. At
the little town of Atella the weary general rested and listened for four
enchanted days to the 2000 lines. They fell in with his policies more
completely than even Maecenas had foreseen. For he proposed now to
disband the larger part of the immense armies that had</p>
<p>• Astraea, or Justice, the last immortal to leave the earth in the
legend of the Saturnian age.</p>
<p>238 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>won the world for him, to settle his veterans on the land, and at
once to quiet them, feed the cities, and preserve the state, through
rural toil. From that moment Virgil was free to think only of
poetry.</p>
<p>In the Georgies a great artist deals with the noblest of the arts —
the cultiva- tion of the earth. Virgil borrows from Hesiod, Aratus, Cate
Varro; but he transforms their rough prose or limping lines into finely
chiseled verse. He covers dutifully the diverse branches of husbandry —
the variety and treatment of soils, the seasons for sowing and reaping,
the culture of the olive and the vine, the raising of cattle, horses,
and sheep, and the care of bees. Every aspect of farming interests and
beguiles him; he has to caution himself to get on;</p>
<p>Sed fugit interea, fugit irreparabile tempus,</p>
<p>Singula dum capti circum vectamur amore — 11</p>
<p>“But meanwhile time flies, flies irreparably, while we, charmed with
love [of our theme], linger around each single detail.” He has a word
about the diseases of animals and how to treat them. He describes the
common farm animals with understanding and sympathy; he is never through
admiring the simplicity of their instincts, the power of their passions,
the perfection of their forms. He idealizes rural life, but he does not
ignore the hardships and vicissitudes, the crippling toil, the endless
struggle against insects, the torturing pendulum of drought and storm.
Nevertheless, labor omnia vincit; 12 there is in such toil a purpose and
result that give it dignity; no Roman need feel ashamed to guide a plow.
Moral character, says Virgil, grows on the farm; all the old virtues
that made Rome great were planted and nourished there; and hardly any
process of seed sowing, protection, cultivation, weeding, and harvesting
but has its counterpart in the develop- ment of the soul. And out of the
fields, where the miracle of growth and the whims of the sky bespeak a
thousand mystic forces, the soul, more readily than in the city,
perceives the presence of creative life, and is deepened with religious
intuition, humility, and reverence. Here Virgil breaks into his most
famous lines, beginning with a noble echo of Lucretius, but passing into
a pure Virgilian strain:</p>
<p>Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,</p>
<p>atque metus omnis et inexorabile fatum</p>
<p>subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari;</p>
<p>fortunatus et ille deos qui novit agrestis,</p>
<p>Panaque Silvanumque senem Nymphasque sorores — 18</p>
<p>“Happy the man who has been able to learn the causes of things, an d
has put under foot all fear and inexorable fate, and the noise of a
greedy Hell.</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>But happy too he who knows the rural deities, Pan and old Silvanus
and the sister Nymphs.” The peasant is right in seeking to pr opitiate
the gods with sacrifice and enlist their good will; these exercises of
piety brighten the round of toil with festivals and clothe earth and
life with meaning, drama, and poetry.</p>
<p>Dryden considered the Georgies “the best poem of the best poet.” 14
It shares with the De Rerum Nature the rare distinction of being at once
didactic and beautiful. Rome did not take it seriously as a handbook of
agri- culture; we do not hear that anyone, having read it, exchanged the
Forum for a farm; indeed, as Seneca thought, Virgil may have written
these rural ecstasies precisely to please an urban taste. In any case,
Augustus felt that Virgil had performed Maecenas’ assignment marvelously
well. He called the poet to his palace and suggested a harder task, a
vastly larger theme.</p>
<p>IH. THE AENEID</p>
<p>At first the plan was to sing the battles of Octavian. 18 But the
supposed descent of his adoptive father from Venus and Aeneas led the
poet — perhaps the Emperor — to conceive an epic on the founding of
Rome. As the theme developed it came to include, by preview through
prophecy, the expansion of Rome into the Augustan empire and peace. It
would also show the role of Roman character in these achievements and
seek to make the ancient virtues popular; it would picture its hero as
reverent of the gods and guided by them, and would fall in with the
Augustan reformation of morals and faith. Virgil retired to various
lairs in Italy and spent the next ten years (29-19) on the Aeneid. He
wrote slowly, with the devotion of a Flaubert, dictating a few lines in
the fresh morning and rewriting them in the after- noon. Augustus waited
impatiently for the poem’s completion, repeatedly</p>
<p>Every schoolboy knows the story of the Aeneid. As Troy bums, the</p>
<p>ghost of the slain Hector appears to the leader of his Dardanian
allies, the</p>
<p>24° CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>“pious Aeneas,” and bids him resume from the Greeks the “holy things
and household gods” of Troy— above all, the Palladium, or image of
Pallas Athene, on the retention of which the preservation of the Trojans
was be- lieved to depend. “Seek for these” sacred symbols, says Hector,
“the city which, when you have wandered over the sea, you shall at last
establish.” 17 Aeneas escapes with his old father Anchises and his son
Ascanius. They set sail and stop at divers places; but always the voices
of the gods command them to go on. Winds drive them ashore near
Carthage, where a Phoenician princess, Dido, is founding a city. (When
Virgil wrote this, Augustus was carrying out Caesar’s plan for
rebuilding Carthage.) Aeneas falls in love with her. A convenient storm
enables them to take refuge in the same cave and to consummate what Dido
considers their marriage. For a time Aeneas accepts her interpretation,
and shares with her and his willing men the tasks of construction. But
the relentless gods — who, in classic myth, never cared much for
marriage — warn him to depart; this is not the capital that he must
make. Aeneas obeys, and leaves the mourning queen with a theme song in
his words:</p>
<p>I will never deny, O Queen, that thou hast deserved of me the ut-</p>
<p>most thou canst set forth in speech…. I never held out the bride-</p>
<p>groom’s torch, nor took the marriage vow…. But now Apollo has</p>
<p>bidden me sail…. Cease then to consume thyself and me with these
complaints. Not of my own will do I seek Italy. 18</p>
<p>Italiam non sponte sequor: this is the secret of the tale. We who,
after eight centuries of sentimental literature, judge Virgil and his
hero in its terms, attach far more significance to romantic love, and to
extramarital relations, than did either Greece or Rome. Marriage was to
the ancients a union of families rather than of bodies or souls; and the
demands of religion or fatherland were placed above the rights or whim
of the individual. Virgil treats Dido sympathetically, and rises to one
of his finest passages in telling how she flings herself upon a funeral
pyre and is burned alive; then he follows Aeneas to Italy.</p>
<p>Landing at Cumae, the Trojans march into Latium and are welcomed by
its king, Latinus. His daughter Lavinia is betrothed to Tumus, the hand-
some chief of the neighboring Rutuli. Aeneas alienates her affection and
her father; Tumus declares war upon him and Latium, and mighty battles
ensue. To refresh and encourage Aeneas the Cumaean Sibyl takes him
through the grotto of Lake Avemus into Tartarus. As Virgil writes an
Odyssey of Aeneas’ wanderings and a short Iliad of his wars, so now he
takes a lead from Odysseus’ tour of Hades, and becomes in turn an
exemplar and guide for Dante. Facilis descensus Avemi —“easy is the
descent to Hell”— says Virgil ; 19</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>2 4 I</p>
<p>but his hero finds the way tortuous, and the lower world confusingly
com- plex. There he meets Dido, who scorns his protestations of love;
there he sees the varied torments with which earthly sin is punished and
the prison house where suffer, Lucifer-like, rebellious demigods. Then
the Sibyl takes him through mystic passages to the Blissful Groves where
those who led good lives bask in green valleys and endless joys. His
father Anchises, who has died en route, expounds to him here the Orphic
doctrine of heaven, purgatory, and hell, and reveals to him in panoramic
vision the future glory and heroes of Rome. In a later vision Venus
shows him the battle of Actium and the triumphs of Augustus. His spirits
revived, Aeneas returns to the living world, kills Turnus, and scatters
death about him with epic hand. He marries the shadowy Lavinia, and when
her father dies he inherits the throne of Latium. Soon afterward he
falls in battle and is transported to the Elysian Fields. His son
Ascanius or lulus builds Alba Longa as the new capital of the Latin
tribes, and thence his descendants Romulus and Remus go forth to
establish Rome.</p>
<p>It seems unmannerly to criticize so gentle a soul as Virgil for all
these grateful flatteries to his country and his Emperor, or to find
flaws in a work that perhaps he had never wished to write and never
lived to complete. Of course it imitates Greek models; so does
practically all Roman literature except the satire and the essay. The
battle scenes are weak echoes of the Iliad’s clanging frays, and Aurora
rises as often as Homer’s rosy -fingered Dawn. Naevius, Ennius, and
Lucretius lend the poet episodes and phrases, sometimes whole lines; and
Apollonius of Rhodes, through his Argonautica, provides a model for
Dido’s tragic love. Such borrowings were judged legitimate in Virgil’s
as in Shakespeare’s days; all Mediterranean literature</p>
<p>24 2 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>To understand and appreciate the Aeneid we must at every turn remind
ourselves that Virgil was writing not a romance, but a sacred scripture
for Rome. Not that he offers any clear theology. The gods who pull the
strings of his drama are as vicious as Homer’s and not as humorously
human; indeed, all the mischief and suffering in the story are caused
not by men and women but by deities. Probably Virgil conceived these
divinities as poetical machinery, symbols of tyrannous circumstance and
disruptive chance; in general he oscillates between Jove and an
impersonal Fate as the ruler of all things. He likes the gods of the
village and the field better than those of Olympus; he loses no
opportunity to commemorate them and describe their rites; and he wishes
that his fellow men could recapture the pietas — the reverence toward
parents, fatherland, and gods — which was nourished by that primeval
rural creed. Heu pietas! heu prisca f ides / he mourns — “alas for the
old piety and faith!” But he rejects the traditional conception of a
Hades in which all the dead bear alike a gloomy fate; he plays with
Orphic and Pythagorean ideas of reincarnation and a future life, and
makes as vivid as he can the notion of a rewarding heaven, a cleansing
purgatory, and a punishing hell.</p>
<p>The real religion of the Aeneid is patriotism, and its greatest god
is Rome. The destiny of Rome moves the plot, and all the tribulations of
the tale find meaning in “the heavy task of establishing the Roman
race”— tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem. The poet is so proud of
the Empire that he looks with no envy upon the superior culture of the
Greeks. Let other peoples transform into living figures marble and
bronze, and chart the courses of the stars:</p>
<p>But thou, O Roman, must the peoples rule.</p>
<p>Thine arts shall be to teach the ways of peace,</p>
<p>To spare the humbled, and throw down the proud. 20</p>
<p>Nor does Virgil resent the death of the Republic; he knows that class
war, not Caesar, killed it; at every stage of his poem he foreshadows
the restorative rule of Augustus, hails it as Saturn’s reign returned,
and promises him, as reward, admission to the company of the gods. No
man ever fulfilled a literary commission more perfectly.</p>
<p>Why do we retain a warm affection for this pietistic, moralistic,
chauvinis- tic, imperialistic propagandist? Partly because the
gentleness of his spirit is on every page; because we feel that his
sympathies have spread from his own fair Italy to all men, even to all
life. He knows the sufferings of the lowly and the great, the obscene
ghastliness of war, the brief mortality that stalks the noblest men, the
griefs and pains, the lacrimae rerum, or “tears in things,” that mar and
accentuate the sunshine of our days. He is not merely imitating</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>Lucretius when he writes of “the nightingale mourning beneath the
poplar’s shade the loss of her young ones, whom some hard plowman has
seen and tom unfledged from their nest; all night long she cries, and
perched on a spray, renews her pitiful song, filling the woods with her
sad lament.” 21 But what draws us back to Virgil again and again is the
persistent loveliness of his speech. It is not in vain th at he pored
over every line, “licking it into shape as the she- bear does her cubs”;
22 and only the reader who has tried to write can guess the toil that
made this narrative so smooth and adorned it with so many passages of
sonorous melody that every second page cries out for quotation, and
tempts the tongue. Perhaps the poem is too uniformly beautiful; even
beauty palls upon us if its eloquence is prolonged. There is a delicate
feminine charm in Virgil, but seldom the masculine power and thought of
Lucretius or the surging tide of that “many - billowed sea” called
Homer. We begin to understand the melancholy ascribed to Virgil when we
picture him preaching beliefs that he could never recapture, writing for
ten years an epic whose every episode and line required the effort of
artifi- cial art, then dying with the haunting thought that he had
failed, that no spark of spontaneity had set his imagination on fire or
spurred his figures into life. But over his medium, if not over his
subject, the poet won a com- plete victory. Artifice has seldom achieved
a brighter miracle.</p>
<p>Two years after his death his executors gave the poem to the world.
There were some detractors: one critic published an anthology of his
defects, another listed his pilferings, another printed eight volumes of
Resemblances between lines in Virgil and in earlier poetry. 23 But Rome
soon forgave this literary communism. Horace ranked Virgil fondly with
Homer, and schools inaugurated nineteen hundred years of memorizing the
Aeneid. Plebeian and aristocrat mouthed him; artisans and shopkeepers,
tombstones and scribbled walls, quoted him; temple oracles gave
responses through ambigu- ous verses of his epic; the custom began — and
lasted till the Renaissance — of opening Virgil at random and finding
some counsel or prophecy in the first passage that struck the eye. His
fame grew until in the Middle Ages he was considered a magician and a
saint. Had he not, in the Fourth Ec- logue, predicted the coming of the
Saviour and, in the Aeneid, described Rome as the Holy City, from which
the power of religion would uplift the world? Had he not in that
terrible Book VI pictured the Last Judgment, the sufferings of the
wicked, the cleansing fire of purgatory, the happiness of the blessed in
paradise? Virgil too, like Plato, was anima naturaliter Christiana,
despite his pagan gods. Dante loved the elegance of his verse, and took
him as guide not only through hell and purgatory, but also in the art of
flowing narrative and beautiful speech. Milton thought of him when</p>
<p>244 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>writing Paradise Lost and the pompous orations of devils and men. And
Voltaire, of whom we should have expected a harsher judgment, ranked the
Aeneid as the finest literary monument left us by antiquity. 24</p>

<li>HORACE</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the pleasantest pictures in the world of letters — where
jealousy is only less rife than in love — is Virgil introducing Horace
to Maecenas. The two poets had met in 40 b.c., when Virgil was thirty
and Horace twenty- five. Virgil opened the doors of Maecenas to him a
year later, and all three remained fast friends till death.</p>
<p>In 1935 Italy celebrated the two thousandth birthday of Quintus
Horatius Flaccus. He was born in the little town of Venusia, in Apulia.
His father was an ex-slave who had risen to the dignity of a tax
collector — or, some said, a fishmonger. 25 Flaccus meant flap-eared;
Horatius was probably the name of the master whom the father had served.
Somehow the freedman prospered, sent Quintus to Rome for rhetoric, and
to Athens for philosophy. There the youth joined the army of Brutus, and
received command of a legion. It was dulce et decorum pro patria mori —
“sweet and honorable to die for one’s country”; 20 but Horace, who often
imit ated Archilochus, dropped his shield in the midst of battle and
took to his heels. After the war was over he found himself shorn of all
property and patrimony, and “bare - faced poverty drove me to writing
verses.” 27 Actually, however, he but - tered hi s bread by being a
quaestor’s clerk.</p>
<p>He was short and stout, proud and shy, disliking the common crowd and
yet not having the garb or means to move in circles whose education
might equal his own. Too cautious to marry, he contented himself with
courtesans who may have been real or may have been forms of poetic
license invented to demonstrate maturity. He wrote of prostitutes with
scholarly restraint and intricate prosody, and thought he deserved much
for not seducing married women. 28 Too poor to ruin himself sexually, he
took to books and composed Greek and Latin lyrics in the most recondite
of Greek meters. Virgil saw one of these poems and praised it to
Maecenas. The kindly epi- cure was complimented by Horace’s stammering
timidity and found a sly relish in his sophisticated thought. In 37
Maecenas took Virgil, Horace, and some others on a jaunt by canal boat,
stagecoach, litter, and foot across Italy to Brundisium. Shortly
afterward he introduced Horace to Octavian, who proposed that Horace
should become his secretary. The poet excused himself, having no passion
for work. In 34 Maecenas gave him a house and income-producing farm in
the Sabine valley of Ustica, some forty-five miles</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>chap, xn)</p>
<p>2 45</p>
<p>from Rome. Horace was now free to live in the city or the country,
and to write as authors dream of writing — with lazy leisure and
laborious care.* For a while he stayed in Rome, enjoying the life of an
amused spectator of the hurrying world. He mingled with all ranks,
studying the types that made up Rome, contemplating with clinical
pleasure the follies and vices of the capital. He pictured some of these
types in two books of Satires (34 and 30 B.c.) modeled at first on
Lucilius and later in a milder and more tolerant strain. He called these
poems sermones — not by any means sermons, but informal conversations,
sometimes intimate dialogues, in almost colloquial hexameters; he
confessed that they were prose in everything but meter, “for you would
not call one a po et who writes, as I do, lines more akin to prose.” In
these racy verses we meet the living men and women of Rome and hear them
talking as Romans talked: not the shepherds, peasants, and heroes of
Virgil, nor the legendary lechers and heroines of Ovid, but the saucy
slave, the vain poet, the pompous lecturer, the greedy philosopher, the
gabbing bore, the eager Semite, the businessman, the statesman, the
streetwalker: this at last, we feel, is Rome. With homicidal playfulness
Horace lays down for the hunter of legacies the rules for success in
that ghoulish game. 29 He laughs at the gourmets who feast on delicacies
and limp with gout. 30 He reminds the laudator temporis acti — the
“praiser of times past”— that “if some god were for taking you back to
those days you would refuse every time”; 31 the chief charm of the past
is that we know we need not live it again. He wonders, like Lucretius,
at the restless souls who in the city long for the country, and there
long for the city; who can never enjoy what they have because there is
someone who has more; who, not content with their wives, hanker with too
great and yet too little imagination for the charms of other women who
have in turn become prose to other men. Money-madness, he concludes, is
the basic disease of Rome. He asks the itching gold-seeker, “Why do you
laugh at Tantalus, from whose thirsty lips the water always moves away?
Change the name, and the story is about you”: vrutato nomine, de te
fabula narratur 32 He satirizes himself, too: he represents his slave
telling him to his face that he, the moralist, is hot-tempered, never
knows his own mind or purpose, and is the menial of his passions like
anybody else. It is doubtless to himself, as well as to others, that he
recommends the golden mean, aurea mediocritas; 83 est modus in rebus, he
says — “there’s a limit, a measure in things,” 34 which the intelligent
man will neither fall short of</p>
<p>• Horace’s estate, unearthed in 1932, turned out to be a spacious
mansion, 363 by 142 feet, with twenty -four rooms, three bathing pools,
several mosaic floors, and a large formal garden surroundea by a covered
and enclosed portico. Beyond this was an extensive farm, worked by eight
slaves and five families of leasehold coloni. 28a</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>nor exceed. In opening his second series of Satires he complains to a
friend that the first group were criticized as too savage and too weak.
He asks advice and is told, “Take a rest.” “What?” the poet objects,
“not wr ite verses at all?” “Yes.” “But I can’t sleep.” 85</p>
<p>He would have done well to take the advice for a time. His next
publica- tion, the Epodes, or “Refrains” (29 b.c.), is the least worthy
of his works: harsh and coarse, ungenerous, tastelessly and bisexually
obscene, forgiv- able only as an experiment in the iambic meters of
Archilochus. Perhaps his disgust with the “smoke and wealth and noise of
Rome” 36 had mounted to bitterness; he could not bear the pressure of
the “ignorant and evil - thinking c rowd.” He pictures himself jostled
and jostling in the human flotsam of the capital, and cries out: “O
rural home! when shall I behold you? When shall I be able, now with the
books of the ancients, now with sleep and idle hours, to quaff sweet
forgetful ness of life’s cares? When will beans, the very brethren of
Pythagoras, be served to me, and greens well larded with fat bacon? O
nights and feasts divine!” 37 His stays in Rome be - came shorter; he
spent so much time in his Sabine villa that his friends, even Maecenas,
complained that he had cut them out of his life. After the heat and dust
of the city he found the pure air, the peaceful routine, and the simple
workmen on his farm a cleansing delight. His health was poor, and like
Augustus he lived for the most part on a vegetarian diet. “My stream of
pure water, my few acres of woodland, my sure trust in a crop of corn,
bring me* more blessing than the lot of the dazzling lord of fertile
Africa.” 89 In him, as in the other Augustan poets, the lov e of country
life finds a warm expression rare in the literature of Greece. Beatus
ille qui procul negotiis —</p>
<p>Happy is he who far from business cares,</p>
<p>Even as the oldest race of men,</p>
<p>Tills with his own oxen his patrimonial fields,</p>
<p>Freed from every debt….</p>
<p>How sweet it is to lie under the ancient ilex tree,</p>
<p>Or on the matted grass,</p>
<p>While the stream flows on between high banks,</p>
<p>And the woodland birds sing,</p>
<p>And springs with leaping waters plash,</p>
<p>Inviting to soft sleep! 40</p>
<p>It should be added, however, that these lines are put with Horatian
irony into the mouth of a city moneylender, who, having uttered them, at
once forgets them and loses himself in his coins.</p>
<p>Probably it was in those quiet haunts that he labored with
“painstaking</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GOLDEN AGE 247</p>
<p>happiness ”— curiosa felicttas * — over those odes by which he knew
that his name would live or die. He was tired of hexameters, the endless
march of their measured feet, the sharp caesura cleaving the line like
some inexorable guillotine. He had enjoyed in his youth the subtle and
vivacious meters of Sappho, Alcaeus, Archilochus, and Anacreon; he
proposed now to trans- plant these “sapphics” and “alcaics,” these
iambics and hendecasyllabics, into Roman lyric form, to express his
thoughts on love and wine, religion and the state, life and death, in
stanzas refreshingly new, epigrammatically com- pact, modeled for music,
and teasing the mind with the complex skein of their weaving. He did not
intend them for simple or hurried souls; indeed, he warned such away by
the bluenosed opening of the third group:</p>
<p>Odi profanum vulgus et arceo.</p>
<p>Favete linguis. Carmina non prius</p>
<p>audita Musarum sacerdos</p>
<p>virginibus puerisque canto: —</p>
<p>“I hate and shun the profane crowd. Be silent! I, priest of the
Muses, sing for maidens and youths songs never heard before.”</p>
<p>The maidens, if they had cared to tread and skip their way
through</p>
<p>Horace’s playful inversions of speech and desire, might have been
pleasantly shocked by the chiseled epicureanism of these odes. The poet
pictures the pleasures of friendship, eating and drinking, and making
love; one would hardly surmise from such lauds that their author was a
recluse who ate little and drank less. Why disturb ourselves with Roman
politics and distant wars? he asks (anticipating the reader of these
pages). Why plan so carefully a future whose shape will laugh at our
plans? Youth and beauty touch us and flit away; let us enjoy them now,
“reclining under the pine trees, our gray locks garlanded with roses and
perfumed with Syrian nard.” 42 Even as we speak, envious time runs out;
seize the occasion, carpe diem, “snatch the day.” 43 He intones a litany
of loose ladies whom he claims to have loved: Lalage, Glycera, Neaera,
Inacha, Cinara, Candia, Lyce, Pyrrha, Lydia,</p>
<p>Tyndaris, Chloe, Phyllis, Myrtale. We need not believe all his
protestations of guilt; these were literary exercises almost compulsory
among the poets of the day; the same ladies or names had served other
pens. The now virtuous Augustus was not deceived by these iambic
fornications; he was pleased to find, among them, stately praises of his
reign, his victories, his aides, his moral reforms, and the Augustan
peace. Horace’s famous drinking song — Nunc est bibendum 44 — was
composed on receipt of the news that Cleopatra was dead and Egypt taken;
even his sophisticated soul thrilled at the thought of</p>
<p>This is the curious and happy phrase applied to Horace by Petronius.
41</p>
<p>248 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>he Empire victorious and expanding as never before. He warned his
readers that new laws could not take the place of old morals; mourned
the spread of luxury and adultery, of frivolity and cynical unbelief.
“Alas!” he says, referring to the latest war , “the shame of our scars
and crimes, and of brothers slain! What have we of this hard generation
shrunk from? What iniquity have we left untouched?” 45 Nothing could
save Rome but a return to the simplicity and steadfastness of ancient
ways. The skeptic who found it difficult to believe anything bent his
hoary head before the ancient altars, acknowledged that without a myth
the people perish, and lent his pen graciously to the ailing gods.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the world’s literature quite like these poems —
delicate and yet powerful, exquisite and masculine, subtle and
intricate, hiding their art with perfect art, and their toil with
seeming ease. This is music in another scale than Virgil’s, less
melodious and more intellectual, meant not for yout hs and maidens but
for artists and philosophers. There is rarely any passion here, or
enthusiasm, or “fine writing”; the diction is simple even where the
sentence stands on its head. But in the greater odes there is a pride
and majesty of thought, as if an emperor were speaking and not in
letters but in bronze:</p>
<p>Exegi monumentum aere perennius</p>
<p>regalique situ pyramidum altius,</p>
<p>quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens</p>
<p>possit diruere, aut innumerabilis</p>
<p>annorum series et fuga temporum.</p>
<p>Non omnis moriar. 40</p>
<p>I have raised a monument more lasting than bronze.</p>
<p>Loftier than the royal peak of pyramids;</p>
<p>No biting storm can bring it down,</p>
<p>No impotent north wind, nor the unnumbered series</p>
<p>Of the years, nor the swift course of time.</p>
<p>I shall not wholly die.</p>
<p>The slandered crowd ignored the Odes, the critics denounced them as
tiresome artifice, the puritans declaimed against the songs of love.
Augustus pronounced the poems immortal, asked for a fourth group that
would cele- brate the exploits of Drusus and Tiberius in Germany, and
chose Horace to write the carmen saeculare for the Secular Games. Horace
complied, but without inspiration. The effort of the Odes had exhausted
him. In his final work he relaxed into the conversational hexameters of
the Satires, and wrote his Epistles as from an easy chair. He had always
wanted to be a philosopher; now he abandoned himself to wisdom, even
while remaining a causewr. Since</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>a philosopher is a dead poet and a dying theologian, Horace, old at
forty-five, was ripe to discuss God and man, morals and literature and
art.</p>
<p>The most famous of these letters, named by later critics “The Art
of</p>
<p>Poetry,” was addressed Ad Phones— to some uncertain members of the
Piso clan; it was no formal treatise, but a bit of friendly advice on
how to write. Choose a subject suited to your powers, Horace says;
beware of laboring like a mountain and producing a mouse. 47 The ideal
book is that which at the same time instructs and entertains; “he who
has mingled the useful with the pleasant wins every vote”— omne tulit
punctum qui miscuit utile dulci. 4S Avoid words that are new, obsolete,
or “sesquipedalian”— foot-and-a-half words. Be as brief as clarity
allows. Go straight to the heart of the matter — in medias res. In
writing poetry do not imagine that</p>
<p>Horace himself had obeyed all these precepts but one — he had not
learned to weep. Because his feelings were too thin, or had been stifled
into silence, he seldom rose to the high art that gives form to sincere
sympathy, or to “emotion remembered in tranquillity.” He was too urbane.
Nil admirari, “to marvel at nothing,” 60 was poor advice; to the poet
everything should be a miracle, even when, like the sunrise or a tree,
it greets him every day. Horace observed life, but not too deeply; he
studied philosophy, but kept so persistently an “even mind” 61 that only
his Odes rise above a “golden me - diocrity.” C2 He honored virtue li ke
a Stoic, and respected pleasure like an Epicurean. “Who, then, is free?”
he asks, and answers, like Zeno, “The wise man, he who is lord over
himself, whom neither poverty nor death</p>
<p>Almost neglected in the Middle Ages, Horace came into his own in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the age of modern classicism, when
every statesman and pamphleteer, above all in England, turned the poet’s
phrases into prose clichds. Boilcau’s L’Art poetique</p>
<p>25O CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>nor bonds affright, who defies his passions, scorns ambition, and is
in him- self a whole.” 53 One of his noblest poems sings a Stoic
strain:</p>
<p>Iustum et tenacem propositi virum</p>
<p>si fractus inlabatur orbis</p>
<p>impavidum ferient ruinae —</p>
<p>“If a man is just and resolute, the whole world may break and fall
upon him and find him, in the ruin s, undismayed.” 64 But despite all
this he calls him - self, with engaging honesty, “a pig from Epicurus’
sty.” 58 Like Epicurus he placed more store on friendship than on love;
like Virgil he lauded the reforms of Augustus, and remained a bachelor.
He did his best to preach religion, but he had none. Death, he felt,
ends all. 86</p>
<p>His last days were ‘clouded with this thought. He had his share of
pains- stomach trouble, rheumatism, and much else. “The years as they
pass,” he mourned, “rob us of all joys, one by one.” 67 And to another
friend: “Alas, O Postumus, the fleeting years slip by; nor shall piety
hold back our wrinkles, or pressing age, or indomitable death.” 68 He
recalled how, in his first satire, he had hoped, when his time came, to
quit life contentedly, “like a guest who has had his fill.” 80 Now he
told himself: “You have played enough, eaten enough, drunk enough; it is
time for you to go.” 60 Fifteen years have passed since he had told
Maecenas that he would not long survive the financier. 61 In 8 b.c.
Maecenas died, and a few months later Horace followed him. He left his
property to the Emperor, and was laid to rest near Maecenas’ tomb.</p>
<p>V. LIVY</p>
<p>Augustan prose achieved no triumphs equal to those of Augustan verse.
Oratory subsided as the making of laws and decisions passed in reality
if not in form from Senate and assemblies to the secret chambers of the
prince. Scholarship continued its quiet course, sheltered from present
storms by its ghostly interests. It was only in the writing of history
that the age achieved a masterpiece in prose.</p>
<p>Bom in Patavium (Padua) in 59, Titus Livius came to the capital,
de-</p>
<p>voted himself to rhetoric and philosophy, and gave the last forty
years of his life (23 b.c. — a.d. 17) to writing a history of Rome. That
is all we know of him; “Rome’s historian has no history.” 63 Like Virgil
he came from the region of the Po, retained the old virtues of
simplicity and piety, and — perhaps through the pathos of distance —
developed a passionate reverence for the Eternal Gty. His work was
planned on a majestic scale and was completed; of its 142 “books” only
thirty -five have come down to us; as</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>hese fill six volumes we may judge the magnitude of the whole.
Apparently it was published in parts, each with a separate title, and
all under the general heading, Ab urbe condita —“ From the city’s
foundation.” Augustus could forgive its republican sentiments and
heroes, since its religious, moral, and patriotic tone accorded well
with the Emperor’s policies. He took Livy into his friendship and
encouraged him as a prose Virgil who was beginning where the poet had
left off. Halfway on his long journey from 753 to 9 b.c., Livy thought
of stopping, on the ground that he had already won lasting fame; he went
on, he says, because he found himself restless when he ceased to write.
64</p>
<p>Roman historians looked upon history as a hybrid child of rhetoric
and philosophy: if we may believe them, they wrote to illustrate ethical
pre- cepts with eloquent narrative — to adorn a moral with a tale. Livy
was trained as an orator; finding oratory censured and dangerous, “he
took to history,” says Taine, “so that he could still be an orator.” 65
He began with a stern preface, denouncing the immorality, luxury, and
effeminacy of the age; he buried himself in the past, he tells us, to
forget the evils of his time, “when</p>
<p>The chief faults of his work derive from this moral intent. He gives
many signs of being privately a rationalist; but his respect for
religion is so great that he accepts almost any superstition, and
litters his pages with omens, portents, and oracles, until we feel that
here too, as in Virgil, the real actors are the gods. He expresses his
doubts concerning the myths of early Rome; he gives the less credible
ones with a smile; but as he goes on he ceases to distinguish legend
from history, follows his predecessors with scant discrimi- nation, and
accepts at their face value the laudatory romances that earlier
historians had composed to ennoble their ancestry. 60 He rarely consults
original sources or monuments, and never bothers to visit the scene of
an action. Sometimes he paraphrases Polybius for pages. 67 He adopts the
old priestly method of annals, narrating events by consulates;
consequently there is in him, aside from his moral theme, no tracing of
causes, but only a succession of brilliant episodes. He makes no
distinction between the rude patres of the early Republic and the
aristocracy of his day, nor between the</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>virile plebs that had created Roman democracy and the venal mob that
had destroyed it. His prejudices are always patrician.</p>
<p>The patriotic pride that makes Rome forever right in Livy was the
secret of his greatness. It gave him an enduring happiness in his long
toil; seldom has any writer executed so vast a plan so faithfully. It
gave his readers, and still gives us, a sense of Rome’s grandeur and
destiny. This imperial con - sciousness contributed to the energy of
Livy’s style, the vigor of his char - acterizations, the brilliance and
power of his descriptions, the majestic march of his prose. The invented
speeches in which his history abounds are master- pieces of oratory, and
became models for the schools. The charm of good manners pervades the
work: Livy never shouts, never severely condemns; his sympathy is
broader than his scholarship and deeper than his thought. It fails him
forgivably when he comes to Hannibal; but he atones with a sweep and
splendor of narrative that reaches its zenith in describing the Second
Punic War.</p>
<p>His readers did not mind his inaccuracies or his bias. They liked his
style and story, and gloried in the vivid picture that he had drawn of
their past. They took the Ab urbe condita as a prose epic, one of the
noblest monu- ments of the Augustan age and mood. From that time onward
it was Livy’s book that would color for eighteen centuries men’s
conception of Rome’s history and character. Even readers in subject
lands were impressed by this massive record of unprecedented conquests
and titanic deeds. The younger Pliny tells of a Spaniard who was so
moved by Livy’s work that he traveled from far Cadiz to Rome in the hope
of seeing him. Having accom- plished his purpose and tendered his
worship, he neglected other sights and returned content to his Atlantic
home. 08</p>

<li>THE AMOROUS REVOLT</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile poetry continued to flourish, but not quite on the lines of
Augustus’ desire. Only supreme artists like Virgil or Horace can produce
good verse to governmental specifications; greater men would refuse,
lesser men are unable to comply. Of the three major sources of poetry —
religion, nature, love — two had been brought under imperial sway; the
third re- mained lawless, even in Horace’s Odes. Now, mildly in Tibullus
and Proper - tius, recklessly in Ovid, poetry escaped from the bureau of
propaganda and staged a rebellion that proceeded with mounting gaiety to
a tragic end.</p>
<p>Albius Tibullus (54-19), like Virgil, lost his ancestral lands when
the</p>
<p>Civil War reached the little town of Pedum — near Tibur — that had
seen his birth. Messala rescued him from poverty and took him in his
train to</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>*53</p>
<p>he East, but Tibullus fell ill on the way and returned to Rome. He
was happy to be free from war and politics; now he could give himself to
genderless love and the polishing of elegiac verse in the manner of the
Alexandrian Greeks. To Delia (otherwise unknown, and perhaps one name
for many) he addressed the usual supplications, “sitting like a
gatekeeper [ianitor] before her stubborn doors” 00 and reminding her, as
so many maids have been reminded, that youth comes but once and soon
steals away. It did not disturb him that Delia was married; he put the
husband to sleep with undiluted wine — but fumed when her new lover
played the same trick upon him. 70 These ancient themes might not have
harassed Augustus; what made Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid really
disagreeable to a government that was finding it hard to enlist recruits
for the army was the persuasive anti- militarism of this love-loose set.
Tibullus laughs at warriors who forage for death when they might have
been seducing women. He mourns for the age of Saturn, when, he
imagines,</p>
<p>here were no armies, no hatred, and no war…. There was no</p>
<p>war when men drank from wooden cups…. Give me but love,</p>
<p>and let others go to war…. The hero is he whom, when his chil-</p>
<p>dren have been begotten, old age overtakes in his humble cottage.</p>
<p>He follows his sheep, his son follows the lambs, while the good wife
heats the water for his weary limbs. So let me live till the white hairs
glisten on my head, and I tell in my old man’s fashion of the days</p>
<p>gone by. 71</p>
<p>Sextus Propertius (49-15) sang less simply and tenderly, and with
more learned ornaments, the same idyl of peaceful lechery. Bom in
Umbria, educated in Rome, he soon lapsed into verse; and though few
readers could fetch his thought from the wells of his pedantry, Maecenas
took him into his circle on the Esquiline. He describes with pride and
pleasure the dinners there on the banks of the Tiber, when he would
drink the wine of Lesbos in cups chiseled by great artists, and, “seated
as on a throne amid merry women,” would watch the vessels gliding by on
the river below. 72 To please his patron and his prince Propertius now
and then plucked his lyre in praise of war; but to his mistress Cynthia
he sang another tune: “Why should I raise sons for Parthian triumphs? No
child of ours shall be a soldier.” 13 Not all the martial glory in the
world, he assured her, could equal one night with Cynthia. 74</p>
<p>Of all these epicureans, light of heart and head, who spent their
lives climbing and descending the mount of Venus, Publius Ovidius Naso
was the happy model and poet laureate. Sulmo (Soloma) saw his birth (43
b.c.) in a pleasant valley of the Apennines some ninety miles east of
Rome; how</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>beautiful, from the cold exile of his later years, would seem Sulmo’s
vine - yards, olive groves, cornfields, and streams! His rich
middle-class father sent him to Rome to study law, and was shocked to
hear that the boy wished to be a poet; he held up to the lad the awful
fate of Homer, who, according to the best authorities, had died blind
and poor. So warned, Ovid managed to rise to the post of a judge in the
praetorial courts. Then, to his father’s dismay, he refused to run for
the quaestorship (from which he would have emerged a senator) , and
retired to the cultivation of literature and love. He pleaded that he
could not help being a poet; “I lisped in numbers and the numbers came.”
76</p>
<p>Ovid traveled leisurely to Athens, the Near East, and Sicily, and,
return- ing, joined the loosest circles in the capital. Possessed of
charm, wit, educa- tion, and money, he was able to open all doors. He
married twice in early manhood, was twice divorced, and then grazed for
a time in public pas- tures. “Let the past please others,” he sang; “I
congratulate myself on being bom into this age, whose morals are so
congenial to my own.” 70 He laughed at the Aeneid , and merely concluded
from it that since the son of Venus had founded Rome, it should, if only
out of piety, become the city of love. 77 He lost his head to a pretty
courtesan, whose anonymity or multiplicity he hides under the name of
Corinna. His racy couplets about her had no trouble in finding a
publisher; under the title of Amoves they were soon (14 b.c.) on the
lips and lyres of youthful Rome. “On every hand people want to know who
is this Corinna that I sing about.” 78 He mystified them, in a second
series of Amoves , by writing a pronunciamento of promiscuity:</p>
<p>It is no fixed beauty that calls my passion forth; there are a
hundred causes to keep me always in love. If it is some fair one with
modest</p>
<p>eyes downcast upon her lap, I am aflame, and her innocence is my en-
snaring; if it is some saucy jade, I am smitten because she is not
rustic simple, and gives me hope of enjoying her supple embrace on
the</p>
<p>soft couch. If she seems austere, and affects the rigid Sabine dame,
I judge she would yield, but is deep in her conceit. If you are versed
in books you win me by your rare accomplishments…. One treads</p>
<p>softly, and I fall in love with her step; another is hard, but can
be</p>
<p>softened by the touch of love. Because this one sings sweetly… I</p>
<p>would snatch kisses as she sings; this other runs with nimble fingers
over the complaining strings — who could but fall in love with such</p>
<p>cunning hands? Another takes me by her movement, swaying her</p>
<p>arms in rhythm and curving her tender side with supple art — to say
naught of myself, who take fire from every cause; put Hippolytus in</p>
<p>my place, and he will be Priapus!… Tall and short are after the</p>
<p>wish of my heart; I am undone by both…. My love is candidate</p>
<p>for the favors of them all. 79</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>Ovid apologizes for not chanting the glory of war; Cupid came and
stole a foot from his verse and left it lame. 60 He wrote a lost play,
Medea, which was well received, but for the most part he preferred “the
slothful shade of Venus,” and was content to be called “the well -known
singer of his worth- less ways.” 81 Here are the lays of the troubadours
a thousand years before - time, addressed like them to married ladies,
and making flirtation the main business of life. Ovid instructs Corinna
how to communicate with him by signs as she lies on her husband’s couch.
83 He assures her of his eternal fidelity, his strictly monogamous
adultery: “I am no fickle philanderer, not one of those who love a
hundred women at a time.” At last he wins her and intones a paean of
victory. He commends her for having denied him so long, and advises her
to deny him again, now and then, so that he may love her forever. He
quarrels with her, strikes her, repents, laments, and loves her more
madly than before. Romeo-like he begs the dawn to delay, and hopes some
blessed wind will break the axle of Aurora’s car. Corinna deceives him
in his turn, and he is furious on finding that she holds her favors
insufficiently rewarded by the homage of his verse. She kisses him into
forgiveness, but he cannot pardon the new skill of her loving; some
other master has been teaching her. 83 A few pages later he is “in love
with two maids at once, each beautiful, each tasteful in dress and
accomplish- ment.” 84 Soon, he fears, his simultaneous duties will undo
him; but he will be happy to die on the field of love. 85</p>
<p>These poems were tolerantly received by Roman society four years
after the passing of the Julian reform laws. Great Senatorial families
like the Fabii, the Corvini, the Pomponii continued to entertain Ovid in
their homes. Buoyant with success, the poet issued a manual of seduction
called Ars amatoria (2 b.c.). “I have been appointed by Venus,” he says,
“as tutor to tender love.” 80 He chastely warns readers that his
precepts must be applied only to courtesans and slaves; but his pictures
of whispered confidences, secret assignations, billets-doux, raillery
and wit, deceived husbands, and resourceful handmaids suggest the middle
and upper classes of Rome. Lest his lessons should prove too apt, he
added another treatise, Remedia cnnoris, on curing love. The best remedy
is hard work; next, hunting; third, absence; “it is also useful to
surprise your lady in the morning, before she has com- pleted her
toilette.” 00 Finally, to make the balance even, he wrote De medi -
camina faciei feminineae, a metrical manual of cosmetics, pilfered from
the Greeks. These little volumes sold so well that Ovid soared to
heights of insolent fame. “So long as I am celebrated all the world
over, it matters not to me what one or two pettifoggers say about me.”
01 He did not know that one of these pettifoggers was Augustus, that the
Prince resented his poems</p>
<p>1 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>as an insult to the Julian laws, and would not forget the insult when
imperial scandal should touch the poet’s careless head.</p>
<p>About the third year of our era Ovid married a third time. His new
wife belonged to one of the most distinguished families in Rome. Now
forty-six, the poet settled down to domestic life and seems to have
lived in mutual faith and happiness with Fabia. Age did to him what law
could not; it cooled his fires and made his poetry respectable. In the
Heroides he told again the love stories of famous women — Penelope,
Phaedra, Dido, Ariadne, Sappho, Helen, Hero; told them, perhaps, at too
great length, for repetition can make even love a bore. Startling,
however, is a sentence in which Phaedra expresses Ovid’s philosophy:
“Jove decreed that virtue is whatever brings us pleas - ure.” 92 About
a.d. 7 the poet published his greatest work, the Metamor - phoses. These
fifteen “books” recounted in engaging hexameters the renowned
transformations of inanimate objects, animals, mortals, and gods. Since
almost everything in Greek and Roman legend changed its form, the scheme
permitted Ovid to range through the whole realm of classical mythology
from the creation of the world to the deification of Caesar. These are
the old tales that until a generation ago were de rigueur in every
college, and whose memory has not yet been erased by the revolution of
our time: Phaethon’s chariot, Pyramus and Thisbe, Perseus and Andromeda,
the Rape of Proserpine, Arethusa, Medea, Daedalus and Icarus, Baucis and
Philemon, Orpheus and Eurydice, Atalanta, Venus and Adonis, and many
more; here is the treasury from which a hundred thousand poems,
paintings, and statues have taken their themes. If one must still learn
the old myths there is no more painless way than by reading this
kaleidoscope of men and gods — stories told with skeptical humor and
amorous bent, and worked up with such patient art as no mere trifler
could ever have achieved. Little wonder that at the end the confident
poet announced his own immortality: per saecula omnia vivam —“  shall
live forever.”</p>
<p>He had hardly written the words when news came that Augustus had
banished him to cold and barbarous Tomi on the Black Sea — even today
unalluring as Constanta. It was a blow for which the poet, rounding
fifty- one, was wholly unprepared. He had just composed, toward the
close of the Metamorphoses, an elegant tribute to the Emperor, whose
statesmanship he now recognized as the source of that peace, security,
and luxury which Ovid’s generation had enjoyed. He had half completed,
under the title of Fasti, an almost pious poem celebrating the religious
feasts of the Roman year. In these verses he was on the way to making an
epic out of a calendar, for he applied to the tales of the old religion,
and to the honoring of its shrines and gods, the same lucid facility,
delicacy of word and phrase, and even flow of racy narrative that he had
devoted to Greek mythology and</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>*57</p>
<p>Roman love. He had hoped to dedicate the work to Augustus as a
contribu- tion to the religious restoration and as an apologetic
palinode to the faith he once had scorned.</p>
<p>The Emperor gave no reason for his edict, and no one today can fathom
its causes confidently. He offered some hint, however, by at the same
time banishing his granddaughter Julia, and ordering that Ovid’s works
should be removed from the public libraries. The poet had apparently
played some role in Julia’s miscond uct — whether as witness,
accomplice, or principal. He himself declared that he was punished for
“an error” and his poems, and implied that he had been the unwilling
observer of some indecent scene. 03 He was given the remaining months of
the year (a.d. 8) to arrange his affairs. The decree was relegatio,
softer than exile in allowing him to retain his property, harsher in
commanding him to stay in one city. He burned his manuscripts of the
Metamorphoses, but some readers had made copies, and preserved them.
Most of his friends avoided him ; 04 a few dared the light- ning by
staying with him till his departure; and his wife, who remained behind
at his bidding, supported him with affection and loyalty. Otherwise Rome
took no notice as the bard of its joys sailed out of Ostia on the long
voyage from everything that he had loved. The sea was rough nearly all
the days of that trip, and the poet thought once that the waves would
engulf the vessel. When he saw Tomi he regretted that he had survived,
and gave himself over to grief.</p>
<p>On the voyage he had begun those verses which we know as Tristia,
“Sorrows.” Now he continued them, and sent them to his wife, his
daughter, his stepdaughter, and his friends. Probably the sensitive
Roman exaggerated the horrors of his new home: a treeless rock where
nothing would grow, and yet shut out from the sun by the Euxine mists;
the cold so bitter that in some years the snow remained all summer long;
the Black Sea stiff with ice through gloomy winters, and the Danube so
frozen that it offered no bar to the raids of hinterland barbarians upon
the city’s mixture of knife - wearing Getae and half- breed Greeks. When
he_thought of Roman skies and Sulmo’s fields his heart broke, and his
poetry, still beautiful in form and phrase, took on a depth of feeling
that it had never fathomed before.</p>
<p>These Tristia, and the poetic letters to his friends Ex Ponto — “From
the Pontus” or Black Sea— have nearly all the charms of his greater
works. A simple vocabulary that made him a pleasure even in school,
scenes vividly realized by insight and imagery, characters brought to
life by touches of psychological subtlety, phrases compact with
experience or thought,* an</p>
<p>E.g., video meliora proboque , deteriora sequor — “I see and approve
the better, I follow the worse”; est dens in nobis agitante calescimus
illo— “there is a god in us, and by his action we have the warmth of
life.”</p>
<p>258 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>unfailing grace of speech and flowing ease of line: all these stayed
with him in his exile, attended by a seriousness and tenderness whose
absence makes the earlier poems unworthy of a man. Strength of character
never came to him; as once he had spoiled his verse with superficial
sensuality, so now he flooded his lines with tears and suppliant
adulation of the Prince.</p>
<p>He envied these poems which could go to Rome. “Go, my book, and in my
name greet the places I love” and “the dear soil of my native land”; 95
perhaps, he tells it, some brave friend will hand it to a relenting
emperor. In every letter he still hopes for pardon, or pleads for at
least some milder home. He thinks each day of his wife and calls her
name in the night; he prays that he may kiss her whitened hairs before
he dies. 88 But no pardon came. After nine years of exile the broken man
of sixty welcomed death. His bones, as he had begged, were brought to
Italy and buried near the capital.</p>
<p>His prediction of lasting fame was justified by time. His hold on
the</p>
<p>Middle Ages rivaled Vir gil’s; his Metamorphoses and Heroides became
rich sources of medieval romance; Boccaccio and Tasso, Chaucer and
Spenser, drew upon him without stint; and the painters of the
Renaissance had a treasure trove of subjects in his sensuous verse. He
was the great romanticist of a classic age.</p>
<p>With his passing ended one of the great flowering epochs in the
history of letters. The Augustan was not a supreme literary age, like
the Periclean or Elizabethan; even at its best there is in its prose a
pompous rhetoric, and in its verse a formal perfection, that seldom come
from soul to soul. We find no Aeschylus here, no Euripides, no Socrates,
not even a Lucretius or a Cicero. Imperial patronage inspired and
nourished, repressed and narrowed, the literature of Rome. An
aristocratic age — like that of Augustus, or Louis XIV, or
eighteenth-century England — exalts moderation and good taste and tends
in letters to a “classic” style in which reason and form dom - inate
feeling and life. Such literature is more finished and less powerful,
more mature and less influential, than the literature of passionately
creative periods or minds. But within the classic range this age
deserved the com- pliment of its name. Never had sober judgment found
expression in such perfect art; even the madcap revelry of Ovid was
cooled into a classic mold. In him and Virgil and Horace the Latin
language as a poetic medium</p>
<p>reached its zenith. It would never be so rich and resonant, so subtle
and compact, so pliant and melodious again.</p>
