<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>The Agrarian Revolt</p>
<p>I45-78 B.C.</p>
<p>I. THE BACKGROUND OF REVOLUTION</p>
<p>T HE causes of revolution were many, the results were endless,
the</p>
<p>personalities thrown up by the crisis, from the Gracchi to
Augustus,</p>
<p>were among the most powerful in history. Never before, and never
again till our own time, were such stakes fought for, never was the
world drama more intense. The first cause was the influx of slave-grown
com from Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, and Africa, which ruined many Italian
fanners by reducing the price of domestic grains below the cost of
production and marketing. Second, was the influx of slaves, displacing
peasants in the countryside and free workers in the towns. Third, was
the growth of large farms. A law of 220 forbade senators to take
contracts or invest in commerce; flush with the spoils of war, they
bought up extensive tracts of agricultural land. Con- quered soil was
sometimes sold in small plots to colonists, and eased urban strife; more
of it was given to capitalists in part payment of their war loans to the
state; most of it was bought or leased by senators or businessmen on
terms fixed by the Senate. To compete with these lattfundia. the little
man had to borrow money at rates that insured his inability to pay;
slowly he sank into poverty or bankruptcy, tenancy or the slums.
Finally, the peasant himself, after he had seen and looted the world as
a soldier, had no taste or patience for the lonely labor and
unadventurous chores of the farm; he preferred to join the turbulent
proletariat of the city, watch without cost the exciting games of the
amphitheater, receive cheap com from the govern- ment, sell his vote to
the highest bidder or promiser, and lose himself in the impoverished and
indiscriminate mass.</p>
<p>Roman society, once a community of free farmers, now rested more and
more upon external plunder and internal slavery. In the city all
domestic service, many handicrafts, most trade, much banking, nearly all
factory labor, and labor on public works, were performed by slaves,
reducing the wages of free workers to a point where it was almost as
profitable to be idle as to toil. On the latifzmdia slaves were
preferred because they were not subject to military service, and their
number could be maintained, genera-</p>
<p>iii</p>
<p>1 12</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>tion after generation, as a by- product of their only pleasure or
their master’s vice. All the Mediterranean region was raided to produce
living machines for these industrialized farms; to the war prisoners led
in after every vic- torious campaign were added the victims of pirates
who captured slaves or freemen on or near the coasts of Asia, or of
Roman officials whose organized man hunts impressed into bondage any
provincial whom the local authorities did not dare protect. 1 Every week
slave dealers brought their human prey from Africa, Spain, Gaul,
Germany, the Danube, Russia, Asia, and Greece to the ports of the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It was not unusual for 10,000 slaves to
be auctioned off at Delos in a single day. In 177, 40,000 Sardinians, in
167, 150,000 Epirotes, were captured by Roman armies and sold as slaves,
in the latter case at approximately a dollar a head. 2 In the city the
lot of the slave was mitigated by humanizing contacts with his master
and by hope of emancipation; but on the large farms no human relation
interfered with exploitation. There the slave was no longer a member of
the household, as in Greece or early Rome; he seldom saw his owner; and
the rewards of the overseer depended upon squeezing every possible
profit from the chattels entrusted to his lash. The wages of the slave
on the great estates were as much food and clothing as would enable him
to toil from sunrise to sunset every day — barring occasional holidays —
until senility. If he complained or disobeyed, he worked with chains
about his ankles and spent the night in an ergastulum — a subterranean
dungeon that formed a part of nearly every latifundium. It was a
wasteful as well as a brutal system, for it supported hardly a twentieth
of the families that once had lived on the same acreage as freemen.</p>
<p>If we remember that at least half these slaves had once been free
(for slaves seldom fought in the wars), we can surmise the bitterness of
these broken lives, and must marvel at the rarity of their revolts. In
196 the rural slaves and free workers of Etruria rebelled; they were
beaten down by Roman legions and, Livy tells us, “many were killed or
taken prisoners; other s were scourged and crucified.” 8 In 185 a like
uprising occurred in Apulia; 7000 slaves were captured and condemned to
mines. 4 In the mines of New Carthage alone 4000 Spaniards worked as
slaves. In 139 the “First Servile War” broke out in Sicily. Four hundred
slaves accepted the call of Eunus and massacred the free population in
the town of Enna; slaves poured from the farms and private dungeons of
Sicily and swelled the number of the rebels to 70,000. They occupied
Agrigentum, defeated the forces of the Roman praetor, and held nearly
all the island till 1 3 1, when a consular army penned them into Enna
and starved them into surrender. Eunus was taken to Rome, dropped into
an underground cell, and allowed to die of hunger and lice. 6 In 133
lesser uprisings resulted in the execution of 150 slaves in</p>
<p>THE AGRARIAN REVOLT</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>”3</p>
<p>Rome, 450 in Mintumae, 4000 in Sinuessa. In that year Tiberius
Gracchus passed the agrarian law that opened the Roman Revolution.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>TIBERIUS GRACCHUS</li>
</ol>
<p>He was the son of the Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus who had earned the
gratitude of Spain by his generous administration, had served twice as
consul and once as censor, and had saved the brother and married the
daughter of Scipio Africanus. Cornelia gave him twelve children, all but
three of whom died in adolescence; and his own death left upon her the
burden of rearing Tiberius and Caius and a daughter — also named
Cornelia — who became the wife of Scipio Aemilianus. Both parents shared
in the Hellenistic culture and sympathies of the Scipionic circle.
Cornelia gathered about her a literary salon , and wrote letters of so
pure and elegant a style that they were reckoned as a distinguished
contribution to Latin literature. An Egyptian king, says Plutarch,
offered her his hand and throne in her widowhood, but she refused; she
preferred to remain the daughter of one Scipio, the mother-in-law of
another, and the mother of the Gracchi. Brought up in the atmosphere of
statesmanship and philosophy, Tiberius and Caius Gracchus knew both the
problems of Roman government and the speculations of Greek thought. They
were particularly influenced by Blossius, a Greek philosopher from
Cumae, who helped to inspire in them a passionate liberalism that
underestimated the power of the conservatives in Rome. The brothers were
almost equally ambitious, proud, sincere, elo- quent beyond reason, and
brave without stint. Caius tells how Tiberius had the agrarian tragedy
borne in upon him when, passing through Etruria, he “noted the dearth of
inhabitants, and observed that those who tilled the soil and tended the
flocks were foreign slaves.” 6 Knowing that at that time only property
holders could serve in the army, Tiberius asked himself how Rome could
preserve its leadership or independence if the sturdy peas- ants that
had once filled its legions were displaced by desolate and alien
bondsmen. How could Roman life and democracy ever be healthy with a city
proletariat festering in poverty, instead of a proud yeomanry owning and
tilling the land? A distribution of land among the poorer citizens
seemed the obvious and necessary solution of three problems: rural
slavery, urban congestion and corruption, and military decay.</p>
<p>Early in 1 3 3 Tiberius Gracchus, elected a tribune of the people,
announced his intention to submit to the Tribal Assembly three
proposals: ( 1 ) that no citizen should be permitted to hold more than
333 — or, if he had two sons, 667 — acres of land bought or rented from
the state; (2) that all other public</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>“4</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>lands that had been sold or leased to private individuals should be
returned to the state for the purchase or rental price plus an allowance
for improve- ments made; and (3) that the returned lands should be
divided into twenty- acre lots among poor citizens, on condition that
they agree never to sell their allotment, and to pay an annual tax on it
to the Treasury. It was not a utopian scheme; it was merely an attempt
to implement the Licinian laws passed in 367 b.c., which had never been
repealed and never enforced. “The beasts of the field and the birds of
the air,” said Tiberius to the poorer plebeians in one of the epochal
orations in Roman history,</p>
<p>have their holes and their hiding places; but the men who fight
and</p>
<p>die for Italy enjoy only the light and the air. Our generals urge
their</p>
<p>soldiers to fight for the graves and shrines of their ancestors.
The</p>
<p>appeal is idle and false. You cannot point to a paternal altar. You
have no ancestral tomb. You fight and die to give wealth and luxury
to</p>
<p>others. You are called the masters of the world, but there is not a
foot of ground that you can call your own. 7</p>
<p>The Senate denounced the proposals as confiscatory, charged Tiberius
with seeking a dictatorship, and persuaded Octavius, another tribune, to
prevent by his veto the submission of the bills to the Assembly.
Gracchus thereupon moved that any tribune who acted contrary to the
wishes of his constituents should be immediately deposed. The Assembly
passed the measure, and Octavius was forcibly removed from the tribune’s
bench by the lictors of Tiberius. The original proposals were then voted
into law; and the Assem- bly, fearing for Gracchus’ safety, escorted him
home. 8</p>
<p>His illegal overruling of the tribunician veto, which the Assembly
itself had long ago made absolute, gave his opponents a handle with
which to frustrate him. They declared their purpose to impeach him at
the end of his one-year term, as having violated the constitution and
used force against a tribune. To protect himself he flouted the
constitution further by seeking re-election to the tribunate for 132. As
Aemilianus and Laelius and other senators who had defended his proposals
now withdrew their support, he turned more completely to the plebs. He
promised, if re-elected, to shorten the term of military service, to
abolish the exclusive right of senators to act as jurors, and to admit
the Italian allies to Roman citizenship. Meanwhile the Senate refused
funds to the agrarian commission that had been appointed to execute
Tiberius’ laws. When Attalus III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to
Rome (133), Gracchus proposed to the Assembly that the personal and
movable property of Attalus should be sold and the proceeds distributed
to the recipients of state lands to finance the equipment of their
farms. The proposal infuriated the Senate, which saw its authority over
the</p>
<p>THE AGRARIAN REVOLT</p>
<p>”5</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>provinces and the public purse being transferred to an unmanageable
and unrepresentative Assembly largely of servile origin and alien stock.
When election day came, Gracchus appeared in the Forum with armed guards
and in mourning costume, implying that his defeat would mean his
impeachment and death. As the voting proceeded, violence broke out on
both sides. Scipio Nasica, crying that Tiberius wished to make himself
king, led the senators, armed with clubs, into the Forum. The supporters
of Gracchus, awed by patrician robes, gave way; Tiberius was killed by a
blow on the head, and several hundred of his followers perished with
him. When his younger brother Caius asked permission to bury him he was
refused, and the bodies of the dead rebels were thrown into the Tiber,
while Cornelia mourned.</p>
<p>The Senate sought to mollify the bitter plebs by consenting to the
enforce- ment of the Gracchan laws. An increase of 76,000 in the
register of citi- zens from 13 1 to 125 suggests that a large number of
land allotments was actually made. But the agrarian commission found
itself faced by many difficulties. Much of the land in question had been
obtained from the state years or generations back and its present
possessors claimed rights estab- lished and sanctified by time. Many
parcels had been bought by new owners, for a substantial price, from
those who had bought them cheaply from the government. The landowners in
Italian allied states, whose squatter rights were imperiled by the laws,
appealed to Scipio Aemilianus to defend them against the land board; and
through his influence its operations were sus- pended. Public opinion
flamed out against him; he was denounced as a traitor to the already
sacred memory of Gracchus; and one morning in 129 he was discovered dead
in his bed, apparently the victim of an assassin, who was never
found.</p>
<p>in. CAIUS GRACCHUS</p>
<p>Ruthless gossip accused Cornelia of conspiring with her daughter,
Scipio’s deformed and unloved wife, to murder him. In the face of these
calamities she sought consolation by devoting herself to her surviving
son, the last of her “jewels.” The murder of Tiberius aroused in Caius
no mere spirit of vengeance, but a resolve to complete his brother’s
work. He had served with intelligence and courage under Aemilianus at
Numantia, and he had won the admiration of all groups by the integrity
of his conduct and the simplicity of his life. His passionate
temperament, all the more vehement on occasion because so long
controlled, made him the greatest of Roman orators before Cicero, and
opened almost any office to him in a society where eloquence served only
next to bravery in the advancement of men. In the fall of 124 he was
elected tribune.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>II 6</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>More realistic than Tiberius, Caius understood that no reform can
endure which is opposed by the balance of economical or political power
in the state. He aimed to bring four classes to his support: the
peasantry, the army, the proletariat, and the businessmen. He won the
first by renewing the agrarian legislation of his brother, extending its
application to state-owned land in the provinces, restoring the land
board, and personally attending to its operations. He fed the ambitions
of the middle classes by establishing new colonies in Capua, Tarentum,
Narbo, and Carthage, and by developing these as thriving centers of
trade. He pleased the soldiers by passing a bill that they should be
clothed at the public expense. He gained the grati- tude of the urban
masses by his lex frumentaria, or com law, which com- mitted the
government to distribute wheat at six and one third asses per modius
(thirty-nine cents a peck — half the market price) to all who asked for
it. It was a measure shocking to old Roman ideas of self-reliance, and
destined to play a vital role in Roman history. Caius believed that the
grain dealers were charging the public twice the cost of production, and
that his measure, through the economy of unified operation, would
involve no loss to the state. In any case, the law turned the poor
freemen of Rome from client supporters of the aristocracy into detenders
of the Gracchi, as later of Marius and Caesar; it was the foundation
stone of that democratic move- ment which would reach its peak in
Clodius, and die at Actium.</p>
<p>Caius’ fifth measure sought to assure the power of his party by
ending the tradition whereby the richer classes in the Centurial
Assembly voted first; hereafter the centuries were on each occasion to
vote in an order determined by lot. He appeased the business class by
giving them the exclu- sive right to serve as jurors in trials for
provincial malfeasance; i.e., they were hereafter to be in large measure
their own judges. He whetted their appe- tites by proposing a tax of one
tenth, to be collected by them, on all the produce of Asia Minor. He
enriched contractors, and reduced unemploy- ment, by a program of road
building in every part of Italy. Altogether these laws, despite the
political trickery that colored some of them, formed the most
constructive body of legislation offered to Rome before Caesar.</p>
<p>Armed with such varied support, Caius was able to override custom and
win election to a second and successive tribunate. Probably it was now
that he sought to “pack” the Senate by adding to its 300 me mbers 300
more to be chosen from the business class by the Assembly. He proposed
also to extend the full franchise to all the freemen of Latium, and a
partial franchise to the remaining freemen of Italy. This, his boldest
move toward a broader democracy, was his first strategic error. The
voters showed no enthusiasm for sharing their privileges, even with men
of whom only a small minority could have attended their assemblies in
Rome. The Senate acted on its</p>
<p>THE AGRARIAN REVOLT</p>
<p>”7</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>opportunity. Almost ignored by Caius, and reduced to apparent
impotence, it saw in the brilliant tribune only a demagogic tyrant
extending his personal power through the reckless distribution of state
property and funds. Sud- denly finding an ally in the jealous
proletariat of Rome, and talcing advantage of Caius’ absence in
establishing his colony at Carthage, the Senatorial party</p>
<p>In the following year the Senate proposed the abandonment of the
colony at Carthage; all sides interpreted the measure, openly or
privately, as the first move in a campaign to repeal the Gracchan laws.
Some of Caius’ adher - ents attended the Assembly armed, and one of them
cut down a conservative who threatened to lay hands upon Caius. On the
morrow the senators appeared in full battle array, each with two armed
slaves, and attacked the popular party entrenched on the Aventine. Caius
did his best to quiet the tumult and avert further violence. Failing, he
fled across the Tiber; over- taken, he ordered his servant to kill him;
the slave obeyed and then killed himself. A friend cut off Caius’ head,
filled it with molten lead, and brought it to the Senate, which had
offered a reward of its weight in gold. 9 Of Caius’ supporters 250 fell
in the fight, 3000 more were put to death by Senatorial decree. The city
mob that he had befriended made no protest when his corpse, and those of
his followers, were flung into the river; it was busy plundering his
house. 10 The Senate forbade Cornelia to wear mourning for her son.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MARIUS</li>
</ol>
<p>The triumphant aristocracy devoted its subtlest intelligence to
undoing the constructive, rather than the demagogic, elements in Caius’
legislation. It did not; dare eject the business class from the juries,
or the contractors and publicans from their happy hunting ground in
Asia; and it allowed the com dole to stand as insurance against
revolution. Into an otherwise attrac- tive measure it inserted a clause
permitting the recipients of the new lands to sell them; soon thousands
of holders sold to the great slaveowners, and</p>
<p>Il8 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>the latifundia resumed their growth. In 1 1 8 the land board was
abolished. The masses in the capital raised no objection; they had
decided that to eat state corn in the city was better than to sweat on
the land or toil in pioneer colonies. Sloth combined with superstition
(for the soil of Carthage had been cursed) to frustrate till Caesar the
attempt to mitigate urban poverty by emigration. Wealth mounted, but it
did not spread; in 104 b.c. a moderate democrat reckoned that only 2000
Roman citizens owned property. 11 “The condition of the poor,” says
Appian, “became even worse than before. . . . The plebeians lost
everything. . . . The number of citizens and soldiers continued to
decline.” 12 More and more the legions had to be filled out with
conscripts from the Italian states; but these men had no stomach for
fighting or no love for Rome. Desertions multiplied, discipline
deteriorated, and the defense of the Republic sank to its lowest
ebb.</p>
<p>Consequently it was soon attacked, almost at the same time, on north
and south. In 1 1 3 two Germanic tribes, the Cimbri and the Teutones, as
if to give Rome a foretaste of its final fate, rolled down through
Germany in a frightening avalanche of covered wagons — 300,000 fighting
men, with their wives, children, and animals. Perhaps the word had gone
up over the Alps that Rome was in love with wealth and weary of war. The
newcomers were tall and strong and fearless, so blond that the Italians
described the children as having the white hair of old men. They met a
Roman army at Noreia (now Neumarkt, in Carinthia) and destroyed it. They
crossed the Rhine and defeated another Roman army; they poured west into
southern Gaul and overcame a third, fourth, and fifth Roman army; at
Arausio (Orange) 80,000 legionnaires and 40,000 camp followers were left
dead on the field. 18 All Italy lay open to the invaders; and a terror
rose in Rome such as it had not known since Hannibal.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time war broke out in Numidia. When Jugurtha,
grandson of Masinissa, tortured his brother to death, and tried to
deprive his cousins of their share in the kingdom, the Senate declared
war upon him (111), with a view to making Numidia a province and opening
it to Roman commerce and capital. Jugurtha bought patricians to defend
his cause and crimes before the Senate, and bribed the generals sent
against him into harmless activities or a favorable peace. Summoned to
Rome, he opened his royal purse more lavishly, and was able to return
unhindered to his capital. 14</p>
<p>Only one officer emerged from these campaigns with credit. Gaius
Marius, bom like Cicero at Arpinum, son of a day laborer, had enlisted
in the army at an early age, had won his scars at Numantia, had married
an aunt of Caesar, and despite, or because of, his lack of education or
manners, had been chosen a tribune of the plebs. In the fall of 108 he
returned from his</p>

<p>“9</p>
<p>services as lieutenant to the incompetent Quintus Metellus in Africa,
and ran for the consulate on a platform proposing that he should replace
Metellus and bring the Jugurthine War to a successful end. He was
elected, took command, and forced Jugurtha’s surrender ( 106). The
people did not learn at this time that the chief agent of this victory
was a reckless young aristocrat, Lucius Sulla; they would hear from him
later. Marius enjoyed a splendid tri- umph, and was so loved that the
Assembly, ignoring a dying constitution, elected him consul year after
year (i 04-100). The business classes sup- ported him partly because his
victories opened new fields for their enter- prises, partly because he
was clearly the only man who could repel the Celtic hordes. Rome already
recognized in Caesar’s uncle the uses of Caesar - ism; the dictatorship
of a popular leader backed by a devoted army seemed to many weary Romans
the only alternative to the oligarchic abuses of liberty.</p>
<p>After their victory at Arausio, the Cimbri had reprieved Rome by
cross- ing the Pyrenees and ravaging Spain. But in 102 they returned to
Gaul, greater in number than before, and entered into an agreement with
the Teutones for a simultaneous assault by separate routes upon the rich
plains of northern Italy. To meet the peril Marius resorted to a new
form of mili- tary enrollment, which revolutionized first the army and
then the state. He invited the enlistment of any citizen, property owner
or not; offered attrac- tive pay, and promised to release volunteers,
and give them lands, after a completed campaign. The army now formed was
composed chiefly of the city proletariat; its sentiments were hostile to
the patrician Republic; it fought not for its country, but for its
general and for booty; in this way, probably without knowing it, Marius
laid the military basis of the Caesarian revolution. He was a soldier,
not a statesman; he had no time to weigh distant political consequences.
He led his recruits over the Alps, hardened their bodies with marches
and drills, and developed their courage with attacks upon objectives
that could be easily won; until they were trained he could not risk an
engagement. The Teutones marched unhindered by his camp, asking the
Romans derisively if they had messages for their wives in Rome, with
whom the invaders proposed soon to refresh themselves; the number of the
Teutones could be judged from the six days they took to pass the Roman
camp. When they had all filed by, Marius ordered his army to fall upon
their rear. In the great battle that ensued at Aquae Sextiae (Aix in
Provence), the new le gions slew or captured 100,000 men (102). “They
say,” Plutarch reports, “that the inhabitants of Marseilles made fences
round their vineyards with the bones, and that the soil, after the
bodies had rotted and the winter rains had fallen, was so fertilized
with the putrefied matter which sank into it, that in the following
season it yielded an unprecedented</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>crop .” 15 After resting his army for several months, Marius led it
back into Italy, and met the Cimbri at Vercellae, near the Po (ioi), on
the very field where Hannibal had won his first battle against Rome. The
barbarians, to show their strength and courage, went naked in the snow,
climbed over ice and through deep drifts to summits from which they
tobogganed gaily along steep descents, using their shields as sleds . 16
In the battle that followed they were nearly all slain.</p>
<p>Marius was received in the rejoicing capital as a “second Camillus”
who had turned back a Celtic invasion, and another Romulus who had
refounded Rome. Part of the spoils he brought was bestowed upon him as a
personal reward; thereby he became a rich man, with estates big “enough
for a kingdom.” In 100 he was elected consul for the sixth time. The
tribune was Lucius Saturninus, a fiery radical who was resolved to
achieve the goals of the Gracchi by law if possible, otherwise bv force.
He pleased Marius with a bill that bestowed colonial lands upon the
veterans of the recent campaign, and Marius raised no objection when he
lowered the price of state-doled com from six and one third asses
(thirty-nine cents) to five sixths of an as (five cents) per modius, or
peck. The Senate sought to pro- tect the Treasury and itself by having a
tribune forbid the submission of these measures to a vote, but
Saturninus proceeded with the voting neverthe- less. Violence flared up
on both sides. When Saturninus’ bands killed Caius Memmius, one of the
most respected of the aristocracy, the Senate took its final resort and,
by a senatusconsultum de re publica defendenda, ordered Marius, as
consul, to suppress the revolt.</p>
<p>Marius faced the bitterest choice of his life. It seemed a miserable
end to his long career of service to the common people of Rome that he
should now attack their leaders and his former friends. And yet he too
distrusted the appeal to violence, and saw in revolution more ills than
it could cure. He led a force against the rebels, let Saturninus be
stoned to death, and then fled to a gloomy retirement, despised alike by
the people he had championed and the aristocracy he had saved.</p>
<p>V. THE REVOLT OF ITALY</p>
<p>The revolution was now passing into civil war. When the Senate asked
for help against the Cimbri from the eastern kings allied with Rome,
Nicomedes of Bithynia replied that all men of military value in his
kingdom had been sold into slavery to satisfy the extortions of the
Roman tax collectors. Preferring an army for the moment, the Senate
decreed that all males enslaved for unpaid taxes should be freed.
Hearing of this order, hundreds of slaves in Sicily, many of</p>
<p>THE AGRARIAN REVOLT</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>them Greeks from the Hellenistic East, left their masters and,
gathering before the palace of the Roman praetor, demanded their
freedom. Their owners pro- tested, and the praetor suspended the
operation of the decree. The slaves or- ganized themselves under a
religious impostor, Salvius, and attacked the town of Morgantia. The
citizens there secured the loyalty of most of their slaves by promising
to liberate them if they repelled the attack; they repelled it, but were
not freed; and many of them joined the revolt. About the same time ( 103
), some 6000 slaves in the western end of the island rose under
Athenion, a man of educa- tion and resolution. This force defeated army
after army sent against it by the praetor, and moving eastward, merged
with the rebels under Salvius. Together they mastered an army dispatched
from Italy, but Salvius died in the moment of victory. Still other
legions crossed the straits, under the consul Manius Aquilius (101 );
Athenion engaged him in single combat and was killed; the leaderless
slaves were overwhelmed; thousands of them died in the field, thousands
were returned to their masters, hundreds were shipped to Rome to fight
wild beasts in the games that celebrated Aquilius 1 triumph. Instead of
fighting, the slaves plunged their knives into one another’s hearts
until all lay dead.</p>
<p>A few years after this Second Servile war all Italy was in arms. For
almost two centuries now Rome — a tiny nation between Cumae and Caere,
between the Apennines and the sea — had ruled the rest of Italy as
subject states. Even some cities close to Rome, like Tibur and
Praeneste, had no representation in the government that ruled them. The
Senate, the assemblies, and the consuls meted out decrees and laws to
the Italian communities with the same high hand as to alien and
conquered provinces. The resources and man power of the “allies” were
drained by wars whose chief effect was to enrich a few families in Rome.
Those states that had remained loyal to Rome in the ordeal with Hannibal
had received scant reward; those that had helped him in any way had been
punished with so servile a subjection that many of their freemen joined
the slave revolts. A few rich men in the cities had been granted Roman
citizenship; and the power of Rome had everywhere been used to support
the rich against the poor. In 126 the Assembly forbade the inhabitants
of the Italian towns to migrate to Rome; and in 95 a decree of the
jealous capital expelled all residents whose citizenship was not Roman
but merely Italian.</p>
<p>A member of the aristocracy paid with his life for trying to improve
this situa- tion. M. Livius Drusus was the son of the tribune who had
rivaled Tiberius Gracchus; since his adopted son became the
father-in-law of Augustus, the family bound the beginnings of the
revolution with its end. Elected tribune in 91, he proposed three
measures: (1) to divide more state lands among the poor; (2) to restore
to the Senate its exclusive jury rights, but at the same time add 300
equites, or businessmen, to the Senate; and (3) to confer Roman
citizenship upon all the freemen of Italy. The Assembly passed the first
bill with pleasure, the second with indifference; the Senate rejected
both and declared them void. The third never reached a vote, for an
unknown assassin stabbed Drusus to death in his home.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Aroused to hope by Drusus’ bill, and convinced by his fate that
neither the Senate nor the Assembly would ever peaceably consent to
share its privileges, the Italian states prepared for revolt. A federal
republic was formed, Corfinium was named the capital, and the government
was vested in a senate of 500 men chosen from all the Italian tribes
except the Etruscans and Umbrians, who re- fused to join. Rome at once
declared war upon the secessionists. All parties in the capital
co-operated in what seemed to them a defense of the union; and every
Roman dreaded the revenge the rebel states would take if they won this
fratricidal “Social War.” * Marius emerged from his solitude, took
command, and won victory after victory while all other Roman generals
but Sulla met defeat. In three years of war 300,000 men fell, and
central Italy was devastated. When Etruria and Umbria were on the verge
of going over to the rebels, Rome pacified them by a grant of full Roman
citizenship; and in 90 the Roman franchise was offered to all Italian
freemen or freedmen who would swear fealty to Rome. These belated
concessions weakened the allies; one town after another laid down its
arms; and in 89 this ferocious and costly war ended in a sullen peace.
The Romans nullified the franchise they had granted by enrolling the new
citizens in ten new tribes, which voted only after the existing
thirty-five, and therefore usually to no use; besides, only a few of the
new citizens could attend the assem- blies in Rome. The deceived and
desolate communities bided their time. Forty years later they would open
their gates in welcome to a Caesar who offered them citizenship in a
democracy that was dead.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>SULLA THE HAPPY</li>
</ol>
<p>After a few years of peace the strife of Italians against Italians
was resumed, merely changing its name from “Social” to “Civil,” and its
scene from the towns to Rome. Lucius Cornelius Sulla was chosen one of
the consuls for 88, and took command of the army that was being prepared
to march against Mithridates of Pontus. Sulpicius Rufus, a tribune,
unwilling to put a conservative like Sulla in charge of so powerful a
force, persuaded the Assembly to transfer the command to Marius, who,
though fat and sixty- nine, was still rumbling with military ambition.
Sulla refused to let his long- awaited chance for leadership slip by
through what seemed to him the whim of an assembly spellbound by a
demagogue and bribed, he was sure, by the merchants who liked Marius. He
fled to Nola, won the army to his support, and marched at its head
against Rome.</p>
<p>Sulla was unique in his origins, character, and fate. Bom poor, he
became the defender of the aristocracy, as the aristocratic Gracchi,
Drusi, and</p>
<p>• This is the time -honored mistranslation of Bellum Sociale — the
War of the Allies (socii) against Rome.</p>
<p>CHAP.-Vl) THE AGRARIAN REVOLT 123</p>
<p>Caesar became leaders of the poor. He took his revenge upon life for
having made him at once patrician and penniless; when he conquered money
he made it serve his appetites without qualm or restraint. He was
unprepos- sessing-glaring blue eyes in a white face mixed with rough
blotches of fiery red, “like a mulberry sprinkled over with flour.” 17
His education belied his looks. He was well versed in Greek as well as
Roman literature, was a dis- criminate collector of art (usually by
military means), had the works of Aristotle brought from Athens to Rome
as part of his richest spoils, and found time, between war and
revolution, to write his Memoirs for the mis- guidance of posterity. He
was a jolly companion and a generous friend, devoted to wine, women,
battle, and song. “He lived extravagantly,” says Sallust, “yet pleasure
never interfered with his duties, except that his conduct as a husband
might have been more honorable.” 18 He made his way rapidly, above all
in the army, his happiest medium; he treated his soldiers as com- rades,
shared their work, their marches, and their dangers; “his only effort
was not to allow anyone to surpass him in wisdom or bravery.” 19 He
believed in no gods, but many superstitions. Otherwise he was the most
realistic as well as the most ruthless of the Romans; his imagination
and his feelings were always under the control of his intellect. It was
said of him that he was half lion and half fox, and that the fox in him
was more dan- gerous than the lion. 20 Living half the time on
battlefields, spending the last decade of his life in civil war, he
nevertheless preserved his good humor to the end, graced his brutalities
with epigrams, filled Rome with his laughter, made a hundred thousand
enemies, achieved all his purposes, and died in bed.</p>
<p>Such a man seemed chemically compounded of the virtues and vices
needed to subdue revolution at home and Mithridates abroad. His 35,000
trained men easily overcame the haphazard cohorts that Marius had impro-
vised in Rome. Seeing his situation helpless, Marius escaped to Africa.
Sulpicius was killed, betrayed by his servant; Sulla had the head of the
tribune affixed to the rostrum that had lately rung with its eloquence;
he rewarded the slave with freedom for his services, and death for his
treachery. While his soldiers dominated the Forum he decreed that
henceforth no measure should be offered to the Assembly except by
permission of the Senate, and that the order of voting sho uld be as in
the “Servian constitu - tion,” which gave priority and advantage to the
upper classes. He had himself chosen proconsul, allowed Cnaeus Octavius
and Cornelius Cinna to be elected consuls (87), and then marched off to
encounter Mithridates the Great.</p>
<p>He had hardly left Italy when the struggle of the plebeian populares
and the patrician and equestrian optimates was resumed. The conservative
sup- porters of Octavius fought in the Forum with die radical followers
of Cinna)</p>
<p>124 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>and in one day 10,000 men were killed. Octavius won, and Cinna fled
to organize revolt in the neighboring towns. Marius, after a winter in
hiding, sailed back to Italy, proclaimed freedom to slaves, and led a
force of 6000 men against Octavius in Rome. The rebels won, slaughtered
thousands, adorned the rostra with the heads of slain senators, and
paraded the streets with noble heads on their pikes as a model for later
revolutions. Octavius accepted death calmly as he sat in his robe s of
office on his tribune’s chair. The carnage continued for five days and
nights, the rebel terror for a year. A revolutionary tribunal subpoenaed
patricians, condemned them if they had opposed Marius, and seized their
property. A nod from Marius sufficed to send any man to death, usually
by execution there and then. All of Sulla’s friends were slain; his
property was confiscated; he was deposed from his command and was
declared a public enemy. The dead were refused burial and were left in
the streets to be devoured by birds and dogs. The freed slaves
plundered, raped, and killed indiscriminately, until Cinna gathered 4000
of them together, surrounded them with Gallic soldiery, and had them
butchered to death. 21</p>
<p>Cinna was now (86) chosen consul for the second time, Marius for the
seventh. In the first month of his new term Marius died, aged
seventy-one, worn out with hardships and violence. Valerius Flaccus,
elected in his stead, passed a bill canceling seventy-five per cent of
all debts, and then left for the East with an army of 1 2,000 men to
depose Sulla from command. Enjoy- ing undivided power at Rome, Cinna
changed the Republic into a dictator- ship, nominated all successful
candidates for major offices, and had himself elected consul for four
successive years.</p>
<p>When Flaccus left Italy, Sulla was besieging Athens, which had joined
Mithridates in revolt. Receiving nothing from the Senate for the pay of
his troops, he had financed his campaign by pillaging the temples and
treasuries of Olympia, Epidaurus, and Delphi. In March, 86, his soldiers
broke through a gate in Athens’ walls, poured in, and revenged
themselves for the city’s long -delayed welcome by a riot of slaughter
and robbery. Plutarch tells us that “there was no number ing the slain;
. . . blood flowed through the streets and far out into the suburbs.” 22
At last Sulla called a halt to the massacre, remarking generously that
he would “forgive the living for the dead.” He led his refreshed troops
northward, defeated a great force at Chaeronea and Orchomenus, pursued
its remnants across the Hellespont into Asia, and prepared to meet the
main army of the Pontic king. But meanwhile Flaccus and his legions had
also reached Asia, and Sulla was again informed that he must give up his
command. He persuaded Flaccus to let him complete the campaign;
thereupon Flaccus was killed by his lieutenant, Fimbria, who now
declared himself commander of all Roman</p>

<p>armies and advanced north against Sulla. Faced with this folly, Sulla
made a peace with Mithridates (85), by which the King was to restore all
the conquests that he had made in the war, surrender eighty galleys to
Rome, and pay an indemnity of 2000 talents. Then Sulla turned south and
met Fimbria in Lydia. Fimbria’s soldiers went over to Sulla, and Fimbria
com - mitted suicide. Master now of the Greek East, Sulla exacted 20,000
talents as indemnities and accrued taxes from the revolted cities of
Ionia. He sailed with his army to Greece, marched to Patrae, and arrived
at Brundisium in</p>

<li>Cinna tried to stop him but was killed by his troops.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sulla was bringing to the Treasury 15,000 pounds of gold and 115,000
pounds of silver, in addition to money and works of art which he
credited to his personal account. But the democratic leaders, still in
power in Rome, continued to brand him as a public enemy, and denounced
his treaty with Mithridates as a national humiliation. Reluctantly Sulla
led his 40,000 troops to the gates of Rome. Many of the aristocracy went
out to join him; one of them, Cnaeus Pompey, brought a legion recruited
entirely from his father’s clients and friends. The son of Marius led an
army out to encounter</p>
<p>Sulla had no trouble in persuading the Senate to make him dictator.
At once he issued a proscription list condemning to death forty senators
and 2600 businessmen; these last had supported Marius against him, and
had bought in at bargains the property of senators slain during the
radical regime. He offered rewards to informers, and prizes up to 12,000
denarii (200) to those who should bring him the proscribed men, alive or
dead. The Forum was adorned festively with the heads of the slain and
with periodi- cally renewed proscription lists which the citizens had to
read at frequent intervals to know if they might still live. Massacre,
banishment, and con- fiscation spread their horrors from Rome to the
provinces and fell upon</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Italian rebels and the followers of Marius everywhere. Some 4700
persons died in this aristocratic terror. “Men were butchered in the
embraces of their wives,” says Plutarch, “sons in the arms of their
mothers.” Many persons who had been neutral, or even conservative, were
proscribed, exiled, or slain; Sulla, it was said, needed their money for
his troops, his pleasures, or his friends. Confiscated property was sold
to the highest bidder or to Sulla’s favorites, and became the foundation
of many fortunes, like those of Crassus and Catiline.</p>
<p>Using his powers as dictator, Sulla issued a series of edicts — known
from his clan name as the Cornelian Laws — by which he hoped to
establish a permanently aristocratic constitution. To replace dead
citizens he enfran- chised many Spaniards and Celts and some former
slaves. He weakened the assemblies by adding these new members indebted
to him and by again ruling that no measure should be put before the
Assembly except by consent of the Senate. To stop the flocking of poor
Italians to Rome he suspended the state distribution of com; at the same
time he eased the pressure of population in the city by distributing
land to 120,000 veterans. To prevent the use of successive consulships
as in effect a dictatorship, he re-emphasized the old requirement of a
ten-year interval before the same office could be held a second time by
the same man. He lowered the prestige of the tribunate by limiting its
right of veto and malting ex-tribunes ineligible for any higher office.
He took from the business class, and restored to the Senate, the
exclusive right to serve as jurors in the higher courts; and he replaced
the farming of taxes to publicans with direct payments from the
provinces to the Treasury. He reorganized the courts, increased their
number for quicker trials, and carefully specified their functions and
fields. All the legislative, judicial, executive, social, and sartorial
privileges enjoyed by the Senate before the Gracchan revolt were
returned to it, for Sulla was certain that only a monarchy or an
aristocracy could wisely administer an empire. To renew the full
membership of the Senate he allowed the Tribal Assembly to promote to it
300 members of the “equestrian” class. To show his confidence in this
thoroughgoing restoration, he disbanded his legions and decreed that no
army should be permitted in Italy. After two years of dictatorship, he
resigned all his powers, re-established consular government, and retired
to private life (80).</p>
<p>He was safe, for he had killed nearly all who could plan his
assassination. He dismissed his lictors and guards, walked unharmed in
the Forum, and offered to give an account of his official actions to any
citizen who should ask for it. Then he went to spend his last years in
his villa at Cumae. Tired of war, of power and glory, perhaps of men, he
surrounded himself with singers, dancers, actors, and actresses; wrote
his Cornmentarii, hunted and</p>
<p>THE AGRARIAN REVOLT</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>l2 7</p>
<p>fished, ate and drank. Men had long since called him Sulla Felix,
Sulla the Happy, because he had won every battle, known every pleasure,
reached every power, and lived without fear or regret. He married five
wives, di- vorced four, and eked out their inadequacy with mistresses.
At 58 he devel- oped an ulcer of the colon so severe that “the corrupted
flesh,” says Plutarch, “broke out into lice. Many men were employed day
and night in destroying them, but they so multiplied that not only his
clothes, baths, and basins, but his very food was p olluted with them.”
23 He died of intestinal hemorrhage, after hardly a year of retirement
(78). He had not neglected to dictate his epitaph: “No friend ever
served me, and no enemy ever wronged me, whom I have not repaid in
full.” 24</p>
