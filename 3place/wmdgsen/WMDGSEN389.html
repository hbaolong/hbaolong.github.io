<h4 id="chapter-xi-the-golden-age-of-spanish">CHAPTER XI The Golden Age
of Spanish</h4>
<p>Literature</p>
<p>1556-1665</p>
<p>/. EL SIGLO DE ORO</p>
<p>44 REAT is the number of divine geniuses who live in our Spain
to-</p>
<p>Vj^ day,” wrote Cervantes in 1584.* Probably he alone then knew
that</p>
<p>What caused this cultural explosion, this brilliant concourse of
lumi- naries in literature and art? Probably the political, economic,
and religious victories of Spain — the conquest and exploitation of the
Americas, the power and profits of Spain in Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal, and India, and the triumph over the Moors in Spain and the
Turks at Lepanto. We today, far from the crises of the Spanish soul, can
hardly understand how both the dangers and the successes of those
exciting years warmed the ardor of the Catholic faith, and made most
Spaniards as proud of their religion as of their blood. Censorship and
the Inquisition, which we should have thought stifling, were accepted by
the nation as war measures neces- sary for national unity in the crusade
against Islam; and the Spanish mind, forbidden to stray from the
hallowed creed, soared within its narrowed bounds into an exalted world
of fiction, poetry, drama, architecture, sculpture, and painting.</p>
<p>But it was also an age of conscientious scholars and bold historians,
of notable works in theology, government, law, economics, geography, and
classical and Oriental studies. The learned Hallam judged that “learning
was farther advanced under Philip II than under Elizabeth.”* Certainly
education was more abundant. Poor as well as rich found their way into
the many universities; twenty new universities were in this period added
to those already renowned; and Salamanca alone had 5,856 students in</p>
<p>1551.® “No one could call himself a Caballero [gentleman] who was not
a man of letters as well.”’* Kings, ministers, nobles, and prelates
opened their purses to scholars, poets, artists, and musicians. There
were, however, some discords in the crescendo: the Church held a whip
over all teachers,</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>and Philip II, to keep Spanish universities full and Spanish minds
theologi- cally pure, forbade Spanish youth to study in any foreign
universities except Coimbra, Bologna, and Rome. After the Century of
Gold this</p>
<p>intellectual endogamy may have played a part in the cultural
sterility of Spain.</p>
<p>Two remarkable Jesuits enter the picture at this point. Baltasar
Gracian, director of a Jesuit college at Tarragona, found time to write
(1650-53) a three-volume novel, El crittcoriy describing the shipwreck
of a Spanish gentleman on the island of St. Helena, his education of the
solitary savage whom he found there (a source for Robinson Crusoe?)^
their travels to- gether in the world, and their penetrating criticism
of European civiliza- tion. Their pessimism and misogyny delighted
Schopenhauer, who called this ’’one of the best books in the world.”® A
friend gave Gracian inter- national currency by selecting from his works
three hundred paragraphs and publishing these as Ordculo manual y arte
de pmdencia (1653 ) — A Handy Oracle and Art of Worldly Wisdom,
Schopenhauer made one of the many translations. Some sample oracles:</p>
<p>Avoid outshining the master… Superiority has always been</p>
<p>detested, and most thoroughly when greatest. A little care will serve
to cloak your ordinary virtues, as you would hide your beauty in
careless dress.®</p>
<p>Mediocrity gets further with industry than superiority without
it.“^</p>
<p>There are rules to luck, for to the wise not all is accident.®</p>
<p>The perfect does not lie in quantity but in quality…. Some judge</p>
<p>books by their knees, as though they had been written to exercise</p>
<p>he arms.®</p>
<p>Think as the few, speak as the many…. The truth is for the few</p>
<p>… Let the wise man take refuge in silence; and when at times he</p>
<p>permits himself to speak, let it be in the shelter of the few and
the</p>
<p>understanding.^®</p>
<p>Know how to say No… Refusal should never be flat, the truth</p>
<p>appearing by degrees…. Employ courtliness to fill the void of the</p>
<p>denial.</p>
<p>Maturity may be recognized in the slowness with which a man</p>
<p>believes.^®</p>
<p>There is always time to add a word, but none in which to take one</p>
<p>back.^®</p>
<p>The Spanish historians were at this time the best in Europe. Philip
II</p>
<p>gathered into archives at Simancas an extensive collection of
official papers</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH LITERATURE 297</p>
<p>and o ther documents, because, he said, “chroniclers and historians
were ill informed in matters of state, and it was desirable, in order to
obviate that defect, to assemble all such materials as might prove
serviceable.”^ These archives have been a treasure for historians ever
since. Jeronimo de Zurita consulted thousands of original documents in
preparing his Anales de la Corona de Aragon (1562-80), and earned a
European reputa- tion as exactissimus scriptor.</p>
<p>The greatest of the Spanish historians, Juan de Mariana, began as the
natural son of a canon at Talavera. Left in youth to shift for himself,
he sharpened his wits on hard necessity and grinding poverty. The
Jesuits, always quick to recognize talent, gave him a rigorous
education. When he was twenty-four they sent him to teach in their
college at Rome; later to Sicily; then to Paris, where his lectures on
Aquinas drew enthusiastic audiences. His health broke down, and at the
age of thirty-seven (1574) he was allowed to retire to the house of his
order in Toledo, which he seldom left in his remaining forty-nine years.
There he wrote some im- portant treatises, one of which (as we shall see
later) caused an inter- national furor; another. On the Coinage of the
Realm, was a brave attack upon Lerma’s debasement of the currency; still
another, which he left unprinted, expounded The Errors in the Government
of the Society of Jesus. The main industry of his final forty years was
the composition of Historiae de rebus Hispaniae ( 1 592 ) , which he
wrote in Latin so that all educated Europe might learn how Spain had
risen to leadership and power. At the urging of Cardinal Bembo he
translated most of it into purest Castilian as Historia de Espana
(1601), which is the proudest</p>
<p>achievement of Spanish historiography, vivid in narrative, beautiful
in style, masterly in characterizations, fearless in honesty — “the most
re - markable union of picturesque chronicling with sober history that
the world has ev er seen.”^®</p>
<p>As, in such works, the old chronicles graduated into history as a
form of literature and philosophy, so Spanish fiction, in this age,
passed from the chivalric and pastoral romance to reach at one bound the
highest point in the history of the novel. Romances of chivalry still
abounded; everyone in Spain from St. Teresa to Cervantes read them
hungrily. Per- haps for some readers they were a relief from the exalted
intensity of Spanish religion, for the creed of the romances was love,
and the devotion of the knights was not to the Virgin but to the ladies
of their choice or fancy; to defend or possess these they would break
many a lance, and not a few laws of God or man. But the rage for such
stories was subsiding when Cervantes wrote; Montaigne and Juan Luis
Vives had already ridi- culed them; and the Cortes of Castile long ago
(1538) had complained that “much harm” was “done to men, boys, girls,
and others” by the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>romances, and that many were “seduced by them from the true Christian
doctrine.”^®</p>
<p>One other development led to the summit. In 1553 an author of un-
certain identity had written, in Lazarillo de Tormes, the first novel in
the gusto picaresco, th e “roguish style” that made a hero of some jolly
rascal (picaro), who redeemed his poverty with lawlessness and his
lawlessness with wit. In 1599 Mateo Aleman published a rollicking Vita
del ptcaro Guzman de Alfarache. Five years later Cervantes took the two
moods — the fading dream of the chivalrous knight and the humorous
wisdom of the common man — and brought them together, soul to soul, in
the most famous of all novels, and the best.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>CERVANTES: 1547-1616</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Spanish custom, which tended to name each child for</p>
<p>he saint commemorated on the day of its birth, the creator of Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza was baptized Miguel de Cervantes at Alcala
October 9, 1547. He — and perhaps his father — added the name Saavedra,
from the Castilian family with which his Galician ancestors had
intermarried in the fifteenth century. The father was an unlicensed
physician, hard of hearing and short of funds, who traveled from town to
town setting bones and alleviating minor injuries; apparently young
Aliguel accom- panied him to Valladolid, Madrid, and Seville. Nothing is
known of the boy’s education; though born in a university town, he seems
to have had no college training; he remained unchastened and uncluttered
by classics, and had to pick his knowledge of life from living.</p>
<p>The first fact that we have of him after his baptismal record is that
in 1569 a Madrid schoolmaster published a volume that included six poems
by “our dear and beloved pupil,” Cervantes. In September of that year a
Myguel de Zerbantes was arrested for dueling, and was banished from
Spain for ten years on penalty of losing his right hand. In December we
find our Miguel serving in the household of a high ecclesiastic in Rome.
On September i6, 1571, the same Miguel, probably (like Camoes) choosing
military service to escape jail, sailed from A^essina on the ship
Marquesa in the armada of Don Juan of Austria. When that fleet
encountered the Turks at Lepanto Cervantes lay ill with fever in the
hold; but as he in- sisted on playing his part, he was put in charge of
twelve men in a boat by the ship’s side; he received three gunshot
wounds, two in the chest and another that permanently maimed his left
hand — “for the glory of the right,” he said. He was returned to a
hospital in Alessina and was paid eighty-two ducats by the Spanish
government. He took part in other</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH LITERATURE 299</p>
<p>military actions — at Navarino, Tunis, and Goletta (La Goulette).
Finally he was allowed to return to Spain; but on the voyage homeward he
and his brother Rodrigo were captured by Barbary corsairs (September
26,</p>
<ol start="1575" type="1">
<li>and were sold into slavery in Algiers. The letters that he carried
from Don Juan and others persuaded his captors that Miguel was a man of
some worth; they placed a high ransom on his head, and, although his
brother was released in 1577, Aliguel was kept in bondage for five
years. Repeatedly he tried to escape, only to have the severity of his
treatment increased. The Dey, the local ruler, declared that “if he
could keep that lame Spaniard well guarded, he should consider his
capital, his slaves, and his galleys safe.”*’’’ His mother struggled to
raise the five hundred crowns demanded for his release; his sisters
sacrificed their marriage dowries for the same cause; at last (September
19, 1580) he was freed, and after an arduous journey he rejoined his
mother’s family at Madrid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Penniless and maimed, he found no way of making ends meet except to
re-enlist in the army. There are indications that he saw service in</p>
<p>Portugal and the Azores. He fell in love with a lady eighteen years
his junior and rich only in names — Catalina de Palacio Salazar y
Vozmediano of Esquivias. Goaded by love and penury, Cervantes wrote a
pastoral romance, Galatea, which he sold for 1,336 reales (68.^). The
lady now married him (1584), after which he introduced to her, and
persuaded her to rear as her own, an illegitimate daughter who had been
born to him by a transient belle a year before.*** Catalina herself bore
him no children. She berated him periodically for his poverty, but
remained apparently loyal to him, survived him, and, dying, asked to be
buried at his side.</p>
<p>The Galatea brought no further reales; its shepherds proved too elo-
quent, except in their poetry; and though Cervantes had planned a con-
tinuation, and to the end thought it his masterpiece, he never found
time or spur to complete it. For twenty- five years he tried his hand at
play- writing, and he composed some thirty plays; he considered them
excellent, and assures us that they “were all acted without any offe
ring of cucum- bers”;*® but none of them touched the public fancy or a
vein of gold. He resigned himself to a modest place in the commissary of
the army and navy (1587), and in that capacity he traveled to a score of
towns, leaving his wife at home. He helped to provision the Invincible
Armada. In 1594 he was appointed taxgatherer for Granada. He was
imprisoned at Seville for irregularities in his accounts, was released
after three months, but was dismissed from the government service. He
remained for several years in obscure poverty in Seville, trying to live
on pen and ink. Then, wandering through Spain, he was arrested again, at
Argamasilla. There</p>
<p>•The story of the captive in Do 7 i Quixote (Part I, Book iv,
chapters 12 -14) largely autobiographical.</p>
<p>300 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>in jail and in misery, says tradition, he continued writing one of
the most cheerful books in the world. Back in Madrid, he sold to
Francisco de Robles the manuscript of The Life and Adventures of the
Renoivned Don Quixote de la Mancha. It was published in 1605, and now at
last, after fifty-eight years of struggling, Cervantes touched
success.</p>
<p>Everyone e.xcept the critics hailed the book as a feast of humor and
philosophy. Philip III (says an old tale), “standing one day on the
balcony of the palace at Madrid, observed a student, with a book in his
hand, on the opposite bank of the Manzanares. He was reading, but every
now and then he interrupted his reading and gave himself violent blows
upon the forehead, accompanied with innumerable motions of ecstasy and
mirth- fulness. ‘That student,’ said the King, ‘is either out of his
wits or read - ing… Don Quixote.’</p>
<p>As in every masterpiece, there are some flaws in these eight hundred
pages. The plot is not very ingenious — a string of episodes, thickened
with irrelevant interpolated tales, and as planless as the knight, who
“rode on, leaving it to his horse’s discretion to go which way it
pleased.” Some threads of the plot are left at loose ends or get tangled
up, like the loss and unexplained reappearance of Sancho’s ass. Now and
then the lively narrative grows dull, the grammar lax, and the language
coarse; and geog- raphers pronounce the geography impossible. But what
does it matter? More and more, as we read on, carried by a genial pull
through sense and nonsense, the wonder mounts that Cervantes, amid all
his tribulations, could have put together such a panorama of idealism
and humor and could have brought the two distant poles of human
character into such il- luminating apposition. The style is as it should
be in a long narrative — not a fatiguing torrent of eloquence, but a
clear and flowing stream, sparklin g now and then with a pretty phrase
(“he had a face like a bless - ing”*^). The inventiveness of incident
continues to the end, the well of Sancho’s proverbs is never exhausted,
and the last bit of humor or pathos is as good as the first. Here, in
what C ervantes calls “this most grave, high - sounding, minute, soft,
and humorous history,” are the life and the people of Spain, described
with a love that survives impartiality, and through a thousand trivial
details that create and vitalize the revealing whole.</p>
<p>Adapting an old device, Cervantes pretends that his “history” is
taken from the manuscript of an Arabian author, Cid Hamet Ben-Engeli.
The preface declares his purpose clearly; to describe in “a satire of
knight - errantry… the fall and destruction of that monstrous heap of
ill-contrived romances… which have so strangely infatuated the greater
part of man- kind.” Chaucer had done something like this in The
Canterbury Tales (“The Rhyme of Sir Topas”), Rabelais in Gargantua,
Pulci in II Morgante maggiore; Teofilo Folengo and other “macaronic”
poets had burlesqued</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH LITERATURE</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>he knights, and Ariosto, in Orlando furioso, had made fun of his
heroes and heroines. Cervantes does not reject the romances outright;
some, like Amadis da Gaula and his own Galatea, he saves from the fire;
and he inserts a few chivalric romances into his story. In the end his
chivalrous Don, after a hundred defeats and ignominious catapults, is
seen to have been the secret hero of the tale.</p>
<p>Cervantes pictures him as an imaginative country gentleman —
ingenioso hidalgo — so bemused by the fiction that he has accumulated in
his library that he arms himself cap-a-pie in knightly costume and
sallies forth on his Rozinante to defend the oppressed, to right
iniquities, and to protect virginity and innocence. He hates injustice,
and dreams of a golden past when there was no gold, when “those two
fatal words, thine and mine, were distinctions unknown; all things were
in common in that holy age… all then was union, all love and friendship
in the world.”^^ As chivalric custom requires, he dedicates his arms,
nay, his life, to a lady. La Dulcinea del Toboso. Never having seen her,
he can picture her as the perfection of demure purity and gentle grace.
“Her neck is alabaster, her breasts are marble, her hands are ivory; and
snow would lose its whiteness near her bosom.”^® Hardened with this
marble and warmed with this sn ow, Don Quixote moves to attack a world
of wrongs. In this battle against great odds he does not feel
outnumbered, for “I alone am worth a hun - dred.” As Cervantes keeps him
company through inns and windmills, filthy ditches and stampeding swine,
he comes to love the “Knight of the Woeful Figure” as a saint as well as
a madman; in all those mis -</p>
<p>adventures and painful falls the Don remains the soul of courtesy,
com- passion, and generosity. At last the somber lunatic is transformed
by his author into a philosopher who, even in the mud, talks kindly good
sense and forgives the world that he cannot understand; and we begin to
take offense when, to hew to his charted line, Cervantes continues to
dash him to the ground. We feel for the disillusioned knight when Sancho
assures him that the only Dulcinea del Toboso known to her town is “a
strapping wench… a sizable, sturdy, manly lass” of lowly stock. The</p>
<p>knight answers him with a golden phrase, “Virtue ennobles the
blood.”<em>^ “Every man,” he tells Sancho, “is the son of his own
works.”</em>®</p>
<p>What the Don lacks is humor, which is the better half of philosophy.
Therefore Cervantes gives him, as an attendant squire, a sturdy town
laborer and son of the soil, Sancho Panza. The knight secures his serv-
ices by promising him food and drink, and the governorship of some
province in the realms they are to conquer. Sancho is a man of simple
sense and hearty appetite, who, though aWays on the verge of starvation,
remains fat to the last page; a kindly fellow, who loves his mule as his
alter ego and values its “sweet company.” He is not a typical
Spanish</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>peasant, for he is long on humor and short on dignity; but, like
any</p>
<p>Spaniard free from theological rabies, he is goodhearted and
charitable, wise without letters, and faithful to his master this side
of flagellation. He soon concludes that the Don is mad, but he too comes
to love him. “I have stuck close to my good master and kept him company
this many a month,” he says toward the end, “and now he and I are all
one.”*® It is true, for they are two sides of one humanity. The knight
in his turn comes to respect the wisdom of his squire as better rooted,
if not as noble, as his own. Sancho expresses his philosophy through
proverbs, which he strings end to end almost to the suffocation of his
thought; “A hen and a woman are lost by rambling”; “Between a woman’s
yea and nay I would not</p>
<p>engage to put a pin’s point, so close they be to one another”; “A
doctor gives his advice by the pulse of your pocket”; “Everyone is as
God made him, and often worse.”<em>^ Cervantes probably used an
anthology of such pr overbs, which he defined as “short sentences framed
on long experi - ence.”</em>® Sancho excuses his adagiorrhea on the
ground that these saws clog his windpipe and must fly out, “first come,
first served.” The Don resigns himself to the flood. “In faith,” he
says, “it would seem that thou art no saner than I am… I pronounce thee
noncompos; I pardon thee, and have done.”*®</p>
<p>The success of Don Quixote brought Cervantes two patrons, the Count
of Lemos and the Cardinal of Toledo, who gave him a small pension; now
he could support his wife, his natural daughter, his widowed sister, and
a niece. A few months after the publication of his book he and his whole
family were arrested for possible complicity in the murder of Caspar de
Ezpeleta at Cervantes’ door. Gossip said that Caspar had loved the daugh
- ter, but inquiry proved nothing, and all were released.</p>
<p>Leisurely Cervantes proceeded with Part Two of Don Quixote. In</p>
<p>1613 he interrupted this fond labor by publishing twelve Novelas
ejem- pbres. “I have given these stories the title of Exemplary,” said
the preface, “and if you look closely there is not one of them that does
not offer a useful example.”®® The first is of a gang of thieves
operating in exemplary</p>

yet well-proportioned nose, the silvery beard that less than a score of

worth counting… the body of medium height… the slightly stoop-</p>

<p>ing shoulders, the somewhat heavy build — this, I may tell you, is
the</p>
<p>author of Galatea and Don Quixote de la Mancha.^^</p>
<p>He was surprised in 1614 by the appearance of Part Two of Don</p>
<p>Quixote, not by himself but by an unidentified poacher who took the
name of Avellaneda. The preface made fun of Cervantes’ wounds, and
rejoiced at the neat trick that would ruin Cervantes’ own Part Two. The
harassed author hurried to finish his continuation and published it in
1615. Literate Spain was delighted to find this extension of remarks
quite up to the first part in imagination, vigor, and humor; through
these additional half- thousand pages the interest was kept up to the
sad if not bitter end; and the mishaps of the Don and his squire at the
court of the Duke, the reign of Sancho over his province, and the
painful tale of his beaten buttocks seemed to some to make the second
the better half. When Sancho is made governor of Barataria everyone
expects him to surpass all records of gubernatorial fatuity. On the
contrary, his good heart and common sense, his simple and just
regulations and reforms, and his wise decision in a case of rape®^ put
to shame the actualities of contemporary govern- ment. But the forces of
heartless evil are too strong for him; finally they harass him to the
point where he surrenders his office and returns with relief to his life
as squire to the Don.</p>
<p>It remains only for the knight to make a similar escape from dreams
to fact. He sets out for new adventures, but meets with a culminating
defeat, in which the victor exacts from him a pledge that he will go
home and live for a year in unknightly peace. The tired warrior
consents, but his disillusionment dries up the sources of his life. He
calls his friends to his bedside, distributes gifts, makes his will,
disavows knight-errantry, and lets his spirit doubly ebb away. Sancho
goes back to his family, and cultivates his garden in the content of a
man who has seen enough of the world to appreciate his home. In the end
his good-natured realism appears to triumph over the generous but
fanciful idealism of his master. But it is not quite so. The soul of the
knight has the last word, in the epitaph that he left for his tomb: “If
I did not accomplish great things, I died in their pursuit.” The realist
survives till his death, but the idealist then begins to live.</p>
<p>In the year that remained to him Cervantes published eight plays;
time has not confirmed his estimate of them, but has given high rank to
his La Numancia, a dramatic poem of power and beauty, celebrating the
re- sistance of that Spanish city to Roman siege (133 b.c.). Like his
knight he had his sustaining delusion; he thought that posterity would
honor him above all for his dramas, and he spoke with unbecoming but
forgivable</p>
<p>TH£ AGE OF REASON B E-GINS</p>

<p>jealousy of the incredibly successful Lope de Vega. And with
almost</p>
<p>his last breath, after ridiculing most romances, he wrote another of
his own, Fersiles y Sigismunda. Four days before his death he dedicated
it to the Count of Lemos:</p>
<p>Yesterday I received extreme unction, and today I pen this dedi-</p>
<p>cation. The time is short, my agony increases, hopes diminish…</p>
<p>And so farewell to jesting, farewell my merry humors, farewell my</p>
<p>gay friends; for I feel that I am dying, and have no desire but to
see</p>
<p>you happy in the other life.®*</p>
<p>He died April 23, 1616.*</p>
<p>In his characteristic Quixotic way he had predicted a sale of
thirty</p>
<p>million copies of his Don Quixote; the world smiled at his naivete,
and bought thirty million copies. The great story has been translated
into more languages than any book except the Bible. In Spain the
simplest villagers know about Don Quixote; and generally, again outside
of the Bible, he is “the most living, the most endearing, and the best
known character in all literature,”*^ more real than a thousand proud
notables of history. By making his story a picture of manners Cervantes
established the modern novel and opened the way for Lesage, Fielding,
Smollett, and Sterne; and he raised the new form to philosophy by making
it reveal and illumi- nate the moral gamut of mankind.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE POETS</li>
</ol>
<p>The masculine resonance of the Castilian tongue, like the melodious
grace of Tuscan Italian, lent itself willingly to music and rhyme; and
the spirit of the people responded more congenially to poetry than to
prose. Poets were as plentiful as priests. In his Laurel of Apollo
(1630), Lope de Vega described a feast and joust of poetry, where, in
his fancy, the three hundred poets of contemporary Spain fought for the
laurel crown. Such poetical contests were almost as popular with the
people as the burning of heretics. There were soporific didactic poems,
homilies in verse, ro- mances in rhyme, pastoral poetry, mock-heroic
poetry, ballads, lyrics, epics; and not all authors had the courage of
Francisco de Figueroa, who condemned his verses to an auto-da-fe.</p>
<p>The best of the epics was La Araucana (1569-89), describing the
re-</p>
<p>volt of an Indian tribe in South America; it was written by Alonso
de</p>
<p>• Only apparently on the same day as Shakespeare. England was still
using the Julian calendar; by the Gregorian, which Spain had adopted,
Shakespeare’s death fell on May 3,</p>

<p>Ercilla y Zufuga, who fought with distinction as a Spanish soldier
in</p>
<p>hat war. Perhaps the finest of the lyric poets was an Augustinian</p>
<p>monk, Luis Ponce de Leon, whose partly Jewish ancestry did not pre-
vent him from expressing the tenderest aspects of Christian piety. More
remarkable was the union in him of poet and theologian; at thirty-four
he was appointed professor of divinity at Salamanca, and he never ceased
to be attached to that university; yet his scholarly pursuits and
austere life did not stop his lyric flights. The Inquisition hailed him
before its tribunal (1572) for translating the Song of Songs into the
form of a</p>
<p>pastoral eclogue. For five years he suffered imprisonment; released,
he resumed his lectures at the university with wry words: “As we
remarked when we last met…”®® He agreed with his superiors that poetry
did not become a theologian; he left his verses unpublished, and they
did not reach print till forty years after his death. They are by common
consent the most nearly perfect productions of the Castilian tongue.</p>
<p>Luis de Gongora and Francisco Gomez de Quevedo y Villegas were</p>
<p>still more famous, for they stirred the air with controversy as well
as rhymes, and left behind them the warring schools of gongorismo and
con- ceptismo as philosophies of style. Cervantes, who had a good word
to say for all his“ rivals except Lope and Avellaneda, called Gongora “a
rare and lively genius, without a second.”®® We catch a distant echo of
the poet’s cry of hate in this stanza from his “Ode to the Armada”:</p>
<p>O Island! once so Catholic, so strong.</p>
<p>Fortress of faith, now Heresy’s foul shrine.</p>
<p>Camp of train’d war, and Wisdom’s sacred school;</p>
<p>The time hath been, such majesty was thine.</p>
<p>The luster of thy crown was first in song.</p>
<p>Now the dull weeds that spring by Stygian pool</p>
<p>Were fitting wreath for thee. Land of the rule</p>
<p>Of Arthurs, Edwards, Henries! Where are they?</p>
<p>Their mother where, rejoicing in their sway.</p>
<p>Firm in the strength of Faith? To lasting shame</p>
<p>Condemned, thou guilty blame</p>
<p>Of her who rules thee now.</p>
<p>O hateful Queen! so hard of heart and brow.</p>
<p>Wanton by turns, and cruel, fierce, and lewd.</p>
<p>Thou distaff on the throne, true virtue’s bane,</p>
<p>Wolf-like in every mood.</p>
<p>May Heaven’s just flame on thy false tresses rain!®^</p>
<p>Here was a pen worth wooing. No wonder Philip IV made the fiery</p>
<p>poet (now become a priest) his royal chaplain, binding his talents to
the</p>
<p>3o6 the age of reason begins (chap, xi</p>
<p>hrone. Gongora labored to acquire polish of style and subtlety of
phrase; he declared war upon such hasty writing as Lope de Vega’s, and
insisted that every line should be filed and purified into a gem. In his
fervor he carried art to artificiality, burdened his lines with
extravagant metaphors, epithets, inversions, and antitheses, outdoing
the euphuism of Lyly and the affectations of Marini. So, of a lass’s
entrancing charms:</p>
<p>Her twin-born sun-bright eyes</p>
<p>Might turn to summer Norway’s wintry skies;</p>
<p>And the white wonder of her snowy hand</p>
<p>Blench with surprise the son of Ethiopian land.</p>
<p>Spanish poets now divided into three camps; those who followed gon-
gorismo (or cultismo)-, those who adopted the conceptismo of (^uevedo;
and those who, like Lope de Vega, resisted both plagues.</p>
<p>At Alcala Quevedo took honors in law, theology, Latin, Greek,</p>
<p>French, Arabic, Hebrew, and dueling. Though he was shortsighted and
clubfooted, he was a peril with both rapier and pen, and his satires
were as cutting as his sword. After killing several opponents, he fled
to Sicily and Naples. At thirty-five he served there as finance
minister; he shared in Osuna’s plot against Venice (i6i8); when it
failed he was imprisoned for three years. Back in Madrid, he was not
silenced by a sinecure as secretary to Philip IV; his verses scalded the
King, the Pope, Olivares, women, and monks. His scandalous little book
El perro y la calentura — ^ The Dog and the Fever — (1625) barked at all
things, poured upon them a storm of proverbs thicker than Sancho Panza’s
and so urer; and his final advice, which he never took, was to stand
aside from the battle and “let the swill pass.”®® Greedy for enemies and
butts, Quevedo attacked the cultismo of the gongoristas and countered it
with conceptismo: instead of hunting for fanciful phrases and words, the
poet should seek ideas — and not obvious notions staled with time or
soiled by common use, but concepts of subtlety, grandeur, dignity, and
depth.</p>
<p>He was wrongly charged with writing letters that warned the King</p>
<p>o cease extravagance and dismiss incompetent ministers. He was im-
prisoned for four years in a damp cell; when he was freed his health was
ruined, and three years later he died (1645). This was no peaceful
literary career, but a life in which ink was blood and poetry was war.
Ending it, he warned his country that it too was dying:</p>
<p>I saw the ramparts of my native land.</p>
<p>One time so strong, now dropping in decay.</p>
<p>Their strength destroyed by this new age’s way</p>
<p>That has worn out and rotted what was grand.</p>

<li>LOPE DE vega: 1562-1635</li>
</ol>
<p>The dramatists, in that lively age, were as numerous as the poets.
Here- tofore, as in contemporary England, the stage had been an
impromptu contraption; strolling players peddled their art impecuniously
in the towns; and the Inquisition, struggling to control the coarseness
of their comedies, placed an interdict upon all plays (1520). When
Madrid be- came the royal residence (1561), two troupes of actors asked
the King’s permission to establish themselves permanently there.
Permission was given, the ecclesiastical ban was lifted (1572), and two
theaters were built, the Teatro de la Cruz and the Teatro del Principe —
the two names expressing the main loyalties and powers of Spain. By 1602
there were theaters also in Valencia, Seville, Barcelona, Granada,
Toledo, and Valla- dolid; by 1632 there were a thousand actors in Madrid
and seventy-six dramatists in Castile; tailors, tradesmen, and shepherds
were writing dramas; by 1800 Spain had heard thirty thousand different
plays. No other country in history — not even Elizabethan England — had
such a theatrical ecstasy.</p>
<p>The form of the theater evolved from the courtyards — surrounded by
houses and temporary stands — in which the earlier plays were performed;
so the permanent theaters were designed as tiers of seats and boxes sur-
rounding a corral. Costumes were Spanish, whatever the place or period
of the piece. The audiences were of all classes. Women came, but sat in
a special section and wore heavy veils. The actors lived in a
demoralizing insecurity between famines and feasts, consoling their
poverty and root- lessness with promiscuity and hopes. A few male
“stars” rose to wealth</p>
<p>The monarch of the Spanish stage was Lope Felix de Vega Carpio. In
1647 the Inquisition had to suppress a published credo which be gan:
“I</p>
<p>3o8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>believe in Lope de Vega the Almighty, the poet of heaven and
earth.”^“</p>
<p>He was born in Madrid, two years before Shakespeare, of a poor but
(we are assured) a noble family. At fourteen he ran away from home and
college, enlisted in the army, and saw some bloody action in the Azores.
He fell in love, but extricated himself with some minor wounds; he
penned mean epigrams on the lady, was arrested for libel, was banished
from Madrid. Re-entering the city secretly, he eloped with Isabel de
Urbina, married her, was pursued, and, to escape the law, joined the
Armada; he shared in its defeat, and his brother, killed in the battle,
died in Lope’s arms. The death of his wife released him for other
entangle - ments. He begot two children by the actress Micaela de
Lujan,^^ married again, became an official of the Inquisition (1609),
lost his second wife, was ordained a priest (1614?), and fell into new
amours.^^</p>
<p>Spain forgave him his mistresses for his plays. He wrote some
eighteen hundred, in addition to four hundred short autos sagramentales
(“sa cra- mental acts”) for performance in religious festivals. He was
reputed to have composed ten plays in one week, and one before
breakfast. Cervantes gave up before this avalanche, and called his rival
a “monster of nature.”</p>
<p>The plot in his plays is everything. The characters are seldom
studied intimately, and one might say of these dramas what Thoreau said
of news- papers — that if you merely change the names and dates, the
contents are always the same. Nearly always the story turns on two
hinges: the point of honor and the question who shall sleep with the
lady. The public never tired of variations on the latter theme, not
being allowed any of its own. Meanwhile it enjoyed the incidental humor,
the lively dialogue, the lyric</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH LITERATURE 309</p>
<p>verses that fell trippingly from the tongues of fair women and brave
men. The spirit of the romances, never extinct, took new life on the
Spanish stage.</p>
<p>The most famous of Lope’s plays is The Star of Seville (La estrella
de Sevilla). Sancho the Bold, King of Castile, comes to Seville, praises
the splendor of its streets, but asks his councilor Arias to tell him
more par- ticularly about its women.</p>
<p>King: And its ladies, divinely fair, why do you not mention them?</p>
<p>… Tell me, are you not aflame in the light of such glories?</p>
<p>Arias: Dona Leonor de Rebera seemed heaven itself, for in her</p>
<p>countenance shone the light of the springtime sun.</p>
<p>King: She is too pale…. I want a burning sun, not freezing.</p>
<p>Arias: The one who threw roses to you is Dona Mencia Coronel.</p>
<p>King: A handsome dame, but I saw others lovelier…. One I saw</p>
<p>here full of grace, whom you have left unmentioned…. Who is she who
on her balcony drew my attention, and to whom I doffed my</p>
<p>hat? Who is she whose two eyes flashed lightning like Jove’s thunder
- bolts and sent their deadly rays into my heart?…</p>
<p>Arias: Her name is Dona Stella Tabera, and Seville in homage</p>
<p>calls her its star.</p>
<p>King: And it might call her its sun…. My guiding star brought</p>
<p>me to Seville…. What means, Don Arias, will you find for me to see
her and speak with her?… O vision that inflames my inmost soul!^®</p>
<p>Stella, however, is in love with Don Sancho Ortiz, and she
indignantly repels Arias’ proposal to let the King enjoy the droit du
seigneur. Arias bribes the maid to admit the King to her mistress’ room;
Stella’s devoted</p>
<p>After producing a thousand such plays, Lope became the idol of
Madrid. Nobles and commoners showered him with admiration; the Pope sent
him the Cross of Malta and the degree of Doctor of Theology. When he</p>
<p>310 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>appeared on the streets he was surrounded by eager crowds; women and
children kissed his hands and begged his blessing. His name was given to
any object supreme in its kind: there were Lope horses, Lope melons,
Lope cigars.^® A critic who had found fault with him lived in daily fear
of death from the poet’s devotees.</p>
<p>Even so, Lope was not happy. He had been paid reasonably well for</p>
<p>his plays, but he had spent or given away his earnings as fast as
they had come; after so many successes he was poor and had to appeal for
aid to Philip IV — who, out of his bankruptcy, sent him a generous
dowry. But bereavements cut more deeply than poverty. His daughter
Marcela entered a convent; his son Lope joined the navy and was drowned;
his daughter Antonia eloped with Cristobal Tonorio, taking with her a
con- siderable quantity of paternal valuables; Lope disowned her,
Cristobal deserted her. Thinking these tribulations to be divine
punishments for his sins, Lope locked himself in a room and macerated
his flesh till the walls were stained with his blood. On August 23,
1635, he composed his last poem; “El siglo de oro.” He died four days
later, aged seventy -three. Half of Madrid joined the funeral
procession, which turned aside to pass the convent where his daughter
could bid him farewell from the window of her cell. His apotheosis was
enacted on a public stage.</p>
<p>We cannot, like Voltaire, place him beside Shakespeare; but we may
say of him that by his abounding genius, his effervescent verse, his
lovable character shining through a thousand plays, he rose to the
literary pinnacle of that Golden Age, where only Cervantes and Calderon
could reach him.</p>
<p>V. CALDERON: 160O-81</p>
<p>Others briefly challenged Lope’s supremacy. Guillen de Castro com -
posed (1591) Las mocedades del Cid (The Youth of the Cid), which some
have preferred to Corneille’s more famous imitation. Luis Velez de</p>
<p>Guevara absented himself from his law practice long enough to write
four hundred plays, including El diablo cojuelo, source of Lesage’s Le
Diable boiteux (The Lame Devil). And Tirso de Molina staged at Barce-
lona (1630) El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de pietra (The Mocker of
Seville and the Stone Guest), which established Don Juan as a sensual
blasphemer, provided the plot for Moliere’s Le Festin de pierre and Mo -
zart’s Don Giovanni, and suggested Byron’s Don Juan. In these few lines
are some hints of the immense influence of Spanish drama abroad. And in
1803 August Wilhelm von Schlegel startled Germany by announcing that in
modern drama Pedro Calderon de la Barca was second only to
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Calderon, like Murillo, concluded and outlived the Golden Age.
Son</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH LITERATURE</p>
<p>3 “</p>
<p>of a finance minister under Philip II and III, he received at
Salamanca all the education that the Jesuits could give and allow; the
religious emphasis in his training strongly colored his work and his
life. He studied law at Salamanca, but abandoned it on discovering that
he could write success- fully for the stage. One piece contained too
clear a reference to gongor- istic verbiage in the sermons of an
influential preacher; Calderon was jailed for a time, but his reputation
was made. A volume of his plays, containing La vida es sueno, was
published in 1636 and won him at once the leadership of the Spanish
theater. Philip appointed him in that year to succeed Lope de Vega as
court dramatist. In 1640 he joined a company of mounted cuirassiers and
won distinction by his gallant courage at Tarragona; in Spain, as in
Islam, the man of letters has often realized his secret dream of being a
man of deeds. Calderon’s health failing after two years of war, he was
retired on a military pension. Bereavements turned him to religion; he
became a lay member of the Franciscan order, was ordained a priest
(1651), and for ten years served a parish in Toledo while continuing to
write occasionally for the stage. After receiving all the honors of this
world, he died at the age of eighty-one, in high hopes of some reward
for having composed hundreds of autos sagramentales and having had only
one mistress.</p>
<p>His religious dramas are the finest of their kind, for there his
lyric power was sustained by sincere devotion. His secular dramas had
for a long time a wider international repute than Lope’s, being equally
beautiful as poetry and superior in thought. He lacked some of Lope’s
incredible vitality and variety; yet he too turned out “cloak -and-
sword” plays {comedias de capa y espada) with verve and skill. Only one
familiar with the Castilian tongue can appreciate him fully, but we note
that two English poets felt his genius and struggled to evoke it from
its linguistic crucible. Shelley, v/ho agreed with Schlegel about
Calderon, freely translated parts of El mdgico prodi- gioso, and Edward
Fitzgerald, in Six Dramas of Calderon (1853), tried and failed to do for
the Spanish dramatist what six years later he did so well for Omar
Khayyam.</p>
<p>The Monstrous Magician is a variant of the Faust legend. Cyprian, re-
nowned scholar of Antioch, interrupts a duel between two of his
students, who both desire Justina; he sheathes their swords by agreeing
to go to her and ascertain her preference; he goes, and he falls in love
with her at sight; she dismisses him scornfully, and then longs for him.
The students, also re- jected, console themselves with her sister Livia,
but Cyprian cannot ex- orcise his memory of Justina’s loveliness.</p>
<p>So beautiful she was — and I,</p>
<p>Between my love and jealousy,</p>
<p>Am so convul.sed with hope and fear.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>

<p>Unworthy as it may appear —</p>
<p>So bitter is the life I live,</p>

<p>My soul, forever to inherit.</p>
<p>To suffer punishment and pine.</p>
<p>So that this woman may be mine.^^</p>
<p>“I accept it,” says the Devil, but he finds Justina difficult.
Finally he</p>
<p>brings her to Cyprian; but as the scholar seeks to embrace her
Justina’s veil opens and reveals nothing but a skull. Lucifer confesses
that only the power of Christ could have played such a trick upon him.
In the end, as both Cyprian and Justina are carried away to Christian
martyrdom, she con- fesses her love.</p>
<p>Among the plays translated by Fitzgerald El alcalde de Zalamea (The
Mayor of Zalcmea) has won high praise for its technical excellence. But
La vida es sueno (Life Is a Dream) has deeper undertones. It puts aside
the old themes of honor and love, and boldly brings to the stage an
almost Oriental problem: How permanent and real are the vicissitudes and
vic- tories of life? Or are they surface illusions, maya, part of the
veil that hides the basic, lasting reality? Basileus, King of Poland,
imprisons his recently born son, of whom the stars prognosticate
rebellion against his father. Sigismund is brought up in chains among
forest animals, and grows to man- hood more savage than any unharassed
beast. The King, aging, relents and invites his son to come and share
the throne; but Sigismund, ill-trained for rule, lays about him with
such thoughtless violence that he has to be drugged into submission.
When he recovers his senses he finds himself back in his woodland den
and chains. He is told that his recent royalty was but a disordered
dream, and, believing it, he talks like Shakespeare’s defeated Richard
II:</p>
<p>’Tis plain.</p>
<p>In this world’s uncertain gleam.</p>
<p>That to live is but to dream:</p>
<p>Man dreams what he is, and wakes</p>
<p>Only when upon him breaks</p>
<p>Death’s mysterious mornin g beam.</p>
<p>The king dreams he is a king.</p>
<p>And in this delusive way</p>
<p>Lives and rules with sovereign sway;</p>
<p>All the cheers that round him ring.</p>
<p>Born of air, on air take wing.</p>
<p>And in ashes (mournful fate!)</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH LITERATURE</p>
<p>3*3</p>
<p>Death dissolves his pride and state.</p>
<p>Who would wish a crown to take,</p>
<p>Seeing that he must awake</p>
<p>In the dream beyond death’s gate?…</p>
<p>And in fine, throughout the earth,</p>
<p>All men dream, whate’er their birth….</p>
<p>What is life? A thing that seems,</p>
<p>A mirage that falsely gleams.</p>
<p>Phantom joy, delusive rest.</p>
<p>Since is life a dream at best,</p>
<p>And even dreams themselves are dreams.^®</p>
<p>Then, by another transformation very inadequately explained,
Sigismund grows out of his savagery into reason; and when a revolution
gives him the throne, he becomes a good king, humbly conscious that this
exaltation is again a dream, an insubstantial bubble in the froth of
life.</p>
<p>The speeches are painfully long, and a gongorism of fanciful phrases
waters the poetic wine; but it is a powerful play nevertheless, mingling
action with thought and sustaining dramatic suspense to the end. if we
had been differently domiciled and indoctrinated, and could understand
Castilian well, we should probably consider this one of the world’s
great plays.</p>
<p>It is impossible for us now to pull ourselves up by the bootstraps
of</p>
<p>imagination out of the prison of our time and place, and realize how
lively a role the drama played in seventeenth-century Spain, and what
influence it enjoyed. In Italy it almost drove the native tragic drama
from the boards. In France it provided plots for Hardy, Corneille,
Moliere, and a dozen others; it molded the form of French tragedy before
Racine, stressing honor and spilling rhetoric. When we recall also the
influence of Cervantes and other Spanish novelists upon Lesage, Defoe,
Fielding, and Smollett, and through them upon Dickens and Thackeray, and
when we compare the art of Elizabethan England, or even that of
contemporary France, with the architecture, the sculpture, and the
painting of Spain in that heyday, we may begin to understand why the
Spanish-speaking peoples of the world yield to none in the pride of
their heritage and their blood.</p>
