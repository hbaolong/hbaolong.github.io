<h4 id="chapter-x-portugal-and-pombal">CHAPTER X Portugal and
Pombal</h4>
<p>i 706-82</p>
<p>I. JOHN v: 1706-50</p>
<p>W HY had Portugal declined since the great days of Magellan, Vasco da
Gama, and Camoes? Once her flesh and spirit had sufficed to ex- plore
half the globe, leaving bold colonies in Madeira, the Azores, South
America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Malacca, Sumatra; now, in the eight-
eenth century, she was a tiny promontory of Europe, tied in trade and
war to England, and nourished by Brazilian gold and diamonds reaching
her by permission of the British fleet. Had her loins been exhausted by
furnishing brave men to hold so many outposts precariously poised on the
edges of the world? Had that influx of gold washed the iron out of her
veins, and relaxed her ruling classes from adventure into ease?</p>
<p>Yes, and it had enervated Portuguese industry as well. What was the
use of trying to compete in handicrafts or manufactures with artisans or
entre- preneurs of England, Holland, or France, when imported gold could
be paid out for imported clothing, food, and luxuries? The rich,
handling the gold, grew richer and more gorgeously accoutered and
adorned; the poor, kept at a distance from that gold, remained poor, and
had only hunger as a prod to toil. Negro slave labor was introduced on
many farms, and beggars made the cities noisy with their cries. William
Beckford, hearing them in 1787, reported: “No beggars equal those of
Portugal for strength of lungs, luxuri - ance of sores, profusion of
vermin, variety and arrangement of tatters, and dauntless perseverance….
Innumerable, blind, dumb, and scabby.” 1 Lisbon was not then the lovely
city that it is today. The churches and the monasteries were
magnificent, the palaces of the nobility were immense, but fully a tenth
of the population was homeless, and the tortuous alleys reeked with
rubbish and filth. 2 Yet here, as elsewhere in southern lands, the poor
had the consolations of sunny days, starry evenings, music, religion,
and pious women with tantalizing eyes. Undeterred by fleas on their
flesh and mosquitoes in the air, the people poured into the streets
after the heat had subsided, and there they danced, sang, strummed
guitars, and fought over a damsel’s smile.</p>
<p>Treaties (1654, 1661, 1703) had bound Portugal to England in a
strange symbiosis that allied them in economy and foreign policy while
keeping them enthusiastically diverse in manners and hostile in creed.
England prom- ised to protect Portugal’s independence, and to admit
Portuguese win e (port from Oporto) at a greatly reduced tariff.
Portugal pledged herself to admit</p>
<p>2 59</p>
<p>l6o ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XEnglish textiles duty free, and to side with England in any war. The
Portu- guese thought of the English as damned heretics with a good navy;
the Eng- lish looked upon the Portuguese as benighted bigots with
strategic ports. British capital dominated Portuguese industry and
trade. Pombal complained, with some exaggeration:</p>
<p>In 1754 Portugal scarcely produced anything toward her own support.
Two thirds of her physical necessities were supplied by England. England
had be- come mistress of our entire commerce, and all our foreign trade
was managed by English agents…. The entire cargo of vessels sent from
Lisbon to Brazil, and consequently the riches that were returned in
exchange, belonged to them. Nothing was Portuguese except in name. 3</p>
<p>Nevertheless enough of colonial gold, silver, and gems reached the
Portu- guese government to finance its expenses and make the king
independent of the Cortes and its taxing power. So John V, in his reign
of forty-four years, lived in sultanic ease, gracing polygamy with
culture and piety. He gave or lent enormous sums to the papacy, and
received in return the title of His Most Faithful Majesty, and even the
right to say Mass — though not to change bread and wine into the body
and blood of Christ. “His pleasures,” said Fred - erick the Great, “were
in p riestly functions; his buildings were convents, his armies were
monks, his mistresses were nuns.” 4</p>
<p>The Church prospered under a King who owed her so many absolutions.
She owned half the land, 5 and her devotees filled nine hundred
religious houses. O f the nation’s two million population some 200,000
were ecclesias - tics of some degree, or attached to a religious
establishment. The Jesuits were especially prominent, at home and in the
colonies; they had shared in win- ning Brazil for Portugal, and were
pleasing even Voltaire by their adminis- tration of Paraguay; several of
them were welcomed at court, and some of them acquired ascendancy over
the King. In the great procession of Corpus Christi the King bore one of
the poles of the canopy under which the Patriarch of Lisbon carried the
Blessed Sacrament. When Englishmen mar- veled to see the route of the
procession lined with troops and worshipers, all bareheaded and
kneeling, it was explained to them that such ceremonies, and the display
of precious vessels and miraculous relics in the churches, were a main
factor in keeping social order among the poor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Inquisition watched over the purity of the nation’s
faith and blood. John V checked the power of the institution by securing
from Pope Benedict XIII a bull allowing its prisoners to be defended by
counsel, and requiring that all its sentences be subject to review by
the king. 6 Even so the authority of the tribunal sufficed to burn
sixty-six persons in Lisbon in eleven years (1732-42). Among them was
the leading Portuguese drama- tist of the age, Antonio Jose da Silva,
who was charged with secret Judaism. On the day of his execution
(October 19, 1739) one of his plays was per- formed in a Lisbon theater.
7</p>
<p>John V loved music, literature, and art. He brought French actors and
Italian musicians to his capital. He founded the Royal Academy of
History. He financed the great aqueduct that supplies Lisbon with water.
He built,</p>
<p>CHAP. X) PORTUGAL AND POMBAL l6l</p>
<p>at a cost of fifty million francs, the Convent of Mafra (1717-32),
vaster than the Escorial, and still among the most imposing structures
in the Iberian Peninsula. To adorn the interior he summoned back from
Spain the greatest Portuguese painter of the century.</p>
<p>The eighty-four years of Francisco Vieira mingled love and art in a
ro- mance that stirred all Portugal. Born at Lisbon in 1699, he fell in
love with Ignez Elena de Lima when both were children. Enamored also of
painting, he went to Rome at the age of nine, studied there for seven
years, and, aged fifteen, won the first prize in a competition offered
by the Academy of St. Luke. Returning in 1715, he was chosen by John V
to paint a Mystery of the Eucharist. This, we are told, he finished in
six days; then he set out to find Ignez. Her titled father turned him
away, and immured the girl in a convent. Francisco appealed to the King,
who refused to intervene. He went to Rome and secured a bull annulling
Ignez’ conventual vows and author- izing the marriage. The bull was
ignored by Portuguese authorities. Fran- cisco, back in Lisbon,
disguised himself as a bricklayer, entered the convent, carried off his
beloved, and married her. Her brother shot him; he recovered and forgave
his assailant. John V made him court painter and gave him com- missions
to decorate not only the Mafra Convent but the royal palaces. After
Ignez died (1775), Francisco spent his remaining years in religious
retreat and works of charity. How many such romances of soul and blood
are lost behind the facades of history!</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>POMBAL AND THE JESUITS</li>
</ol>
<p>John V died in 1750 after eight years of paralysis and imbecility,
and his son Joseph I (Jose Manoel) began an eventful reign. He appointed
to his cabinet, as minister for war and foreign affairs, Sebastiao Jose
de Carvalho e Mello, whom history knows as the Marques de Pombal, the
greatest and most terrible minister who ever governed Portugal.</p>
<p>He was already fifty-one years old when Joseph reached the throne.
Edu- cated by the Jesuits at the University of Coimbra, he won his first
fame as an athletic and pugnacious leader of the “Mohocks” gang that
infested the streets of Lisbon. In 1733 he persuaded the highborn Dona
Teresa de No- ronha to elope with him. Her family denounced him, then
recognized his talent and promoted his political career. His wife
brought him a small for- tune; he inherited another from an uncle. He
made his way by influence, persistence, and obvious ability. In 1739 he
was appointed minister plenipo- tentiary to London. His wife retired to
a convent, and died there in 1745. In his six years in England Pombal
studied the English economy and govern- ment, noted the obedience of the
Anglican Church to the state, and perhaps shed some of his Catholic
faith. He returned to Lisbon (1744), was sent as envoy to Vienna (1745),
and there married a niece of Marshal Daun, who remained devoted to him
through all his triumphs and defeats,</p>
<p>was to earn immortality by de feating Frederick once. Pombal’s new
bride</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XJohn V had distrusted him as having “a hairy heart,” 8 as “coming
from a cruel and vindictive family,” 9 and as capable of defying a king.
Nevertheless Pombal was called home in 1749, and was raised to
ministerial office with Jesuit support. Joseph I confirmed the
appointment. Intelligence combined with industry soon gave Pombal
dominance in the new cabinet. “Carvalho,” reported a French charge
d’affaires, “may be looked upon as the chief minis - ter. He is
indefatigable, active, and expeditious. He has won the confidence of the
King his master, and in all political matters none has it more than he.”
10</p>
<p>His superiority became evident in the great earthquake of November
1,</p>
<ol start="1755" type="1">
<li>At 9:40 a.m. on All Saints’ Day, when most of the population were
worshiping in the churches, four convulsions of the earth laid half of
Lis- bon in ruins, killing over fifteen thousand people, destroying most
of the churches, sparing most of the brothels, 11 and Pombal’s home.
Many inhabit - ants ran in terror to the shores of the Tagus, but a
tidal wave fifteen feet high drowned thousands more, and wrecked the
vessels that lay in the river. The fires that broke out in every quarter
of the city claimed additional lives. In the resultant chaos the scum of
the populace began to rob and kill with impunity. The King, who himself
had narrowly escaped death, asked his ministers what should be done.
Pombal is reported to have answered, “Bury the dead and relieve the
living.” Joseph gave him full authority, and Pombal used it with
characteristic energy and dispatch. He stationed troops to main- tain
order, set up tents and camps for the homeless, and decreed immediate
hanging for anyone found robbing the dead. He fixed the prices of
provisions at those that had prevailed before the earthquake, and
compelled all incom- ing ships to unload their cargoes of food and sell
them at those prices. Helped by an undiminished influx of Brazilian
gold, he supervised the rapid rebuild- ing of Lisbon with wide
boulevards and well-paved and well-lit streets. The central part of the
city as it is today was the work of the architects and engineers who
worked under Pombal. 12</li>
</ol>
<p>His success in this demoralizing catastrophe confirmed his power in
the ministry. Now he undertook two far-reaching tasks: to free the
government from domination by the Church, and to free the economy from
domination by Britain. These enterprises required a man of steel, of
patriotism, ruthless- ness, and pride.</p>
<p>If his anticlericalism struck especially at the Jesuits, it was
primarily be- cause he suspected them of fomenting the resistance to
Portuguese appro- priation of that Paraguayan territory where the
Jesuits had since 1605 been organizing over 100,000 Indians into
thirty-one reductiones, or settlements, on a semicommunistic basis in
formal submission to Spain. 13 Spanish and Portuguese explorers had
heard of (quite legendary) gold in Paraguayan soil, and merchants
complained that the Jesuit fathers were monopolizing the ex- port trade
of Paraguay and were adding the profits to the funds of their order. In
1750 Pombal negotiated a treaty by which Portugal surrendered to Spain
the rich colony of San Sacramento (at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata)
in exchange for seven of the Jesuit “reductions” adjacent to the
Brazilian</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>PORTUGAL AND POMBAL</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>frontier. The treaty stipulated that the thirty thousand Indians in
these com- munities should emigrate to other regions, and relinquish the
land to the in- coming Portuguese. Ferdinand VI of Spain ordered the
Paraguayan Jesuits to leave the settlements, and to instruct their
subjects to depart in peace. The Jesuits claimed to have obeyed these
orders, but the Indians resisted with a passionate and violent tenacity,
which it took a Portuguese army three years to overcome. Pombal accused
the Society of Jesus of secretly encouraging this resistance. He
resolved to end all Jesuit participation in Portuguese in- dustry,
commerce, and government. Perceiving his intention, the Jesuits of
Portugal joined in efforts to overthrow him.</p>
<p>Their leader in this movement was Gabriel Malagrida. Born in Menaggio
(on Lake Como) in 1689, he distinguished himself at school by biting his
hands till the blood flowed; so, he said, he prepared himself to bear
the pains of martyrdom. He joined the Society of Jesus, and sailed as a
missionary to Brazil. From 1724 to 1735 he preached the Gospel to
Indians in the jungle. Several times he escaped death — from cannibals,
crocodiles, shipwreck, dis- ease. His beard turned white in early middle
age. He was credited with miraculous powers, and expectant crowds
followed him whenever he ap- peared in the cities of Brazil. He built
churches and convents, and founded seminaries. In 1 747 he came to
Lisbon to solicit funds from King John. He received them, sailed back to
Brazil, and established more religious houses, often sharing in the
manual labor of construction. In 1753 he was in Lisbon again, for he had
promised to prepare the Queen Mother for death. He at- tributed the
earthquake of 1755 to the sins of the people, called for a reform of
morals, and, with others of his order, predicted further earthquakes if
morals did not improve. His house of religious retreat became a focus of
plots against Pombal.</p>
<p>Some noble families were involved in these plots. They protested that
the son of an insignificant country squire had made himself master of
Portugal, holding their lives and fortunes in his hands. One of these
aristocratic factions was led by Dom Jose de Mascarenhas, Duke of
Aveiro; another was headed by the Duke’s brother -in-law, Dom Francisco
de Assiz, Marquis of Tavora. Tavora’s wife, the Marchioness Dona Leonor,
a leader of Portuguese society, was a fervent disciple and frequent
visitor of Father Malagrida. Her oldest son, Dom Luis Bernardo, the
“younger Marquis” of Tavora, was married to his own aunt. When Luis went
off to India as a soldier, this lovely and beau- tiful “younger
Marchioness” became the mistress of Joseph I; this too the Aveiros and
the Tavoras never forgave. They heartily agreed with the Jes- uits that
should Pombal be removed the situation would be eased.</p>
<p>Pombal struck back by persuading Joseph that the Society of Jesus was
se- cretly encouraging further revolt in Paraguay, and was conspiring
not only against the ministry but against the King as well. On September
19, 1757, a decree banished from the court the Jesuit confessors of the
royal family. Pombal instructed his cousin, Francisco de Almada e M en
donga, Portuguese envoy to the Vatican, to leave no ducat unturned in
promoting and financing the anti-Jesuit party in Rome. In October Almada
presented to Benedict</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXIV a list of charges against the Jesuits: that they had “sacrificed
all Chris - tian, religious, natural, and political obligations in a
blind wish… to make themselves masters of the government”; and that the
Society was actuated</p>
<p>There was some doubt whether Joseph I would support his minister in
attacking the Jesuits; but a dramatic turn of events drove the King com-
pletely to Pombal’s side. On the night of September 3, 1758, Joseph was
re - turning to his palace near Belem from a secret rendezvous, probably
with the young Marchioness of Tavora. 16 Shortly before midnight three
masked men emerged from the arch of an aqueduct and fired into the
coach, without effect. The coachman put his horse to the gallop, but a
moment later two shots came from another ambush; one shot wounded the
coachman, the other wounded the King in his right shoulder and arm.
According to a later court of inquiry a third ambush, by members of the
Tavora family, awaited the coach farther on the highway to Belem. But
Joseph ordered the coach- man to leave the main road and drive to the
house of the royal surgeon, who dressed the wounds. The resultant
events, which made a noise throughout Europe, might have been very
different if the third ambush had succeeded in the attempted
assassination.</p>
<p>Pombal acted with subtle deliberation. Rumors of the attack were
officially denied; the King’s temporary confinement was ascribed to a
fall. F or three months the secret agents of the minister gathered
evidence. A man was found who testified that Antonio Ferreira had
borrowed a musket from him on August 3 and had returned it on September
8. Another man was reported as saying that Ferreira had borrowed a
pistol from him on September 3 and had returned it a few days later.
Ferreira, said both these witnesses, was in the service of the Duke of
Aveiro. Salvador Durao, a servant in Belem, testi- fied that on the
night of the attack, while he was keeping an assignation out- side the
Aveiro home, he had overheard some members of the Aveiro family
returning from a nocturnal enterprise.</p>
<p>Pombal prepared his case with caution and audacity. He set aside the
pro- cedure required by law, which would have tried the suspected nobles
by a court of their peers; such a court would never condemn them.
Instead, as the first public revelation of the crime, the King issued on
December 9 two de- crees: one nominated Dr. Pedro Goncalves Pereira as
judge to preside over a Special Tribunal of High Treason; the other
ordered him to discover,</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>PORTUGAL AND POMBAL</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>arrest, and execute those responsible for the attempt to kill the
King. Gon- galves Pereira was empowered to disregard all customary forms
of legal proc- ess, and the tribunal was told to execute its decrees on
the day of their announcement. To these decrees Pombal added a
manifesto, posted through- out the city, relating the events of
September 3, and offering rewards to any person who would give evidence
leading to the arrest of the assassins. 17</p>
<p>On December 1 3 government officers arrested the Duke of Aveiro, his
sixteen-year-old son the Marquis of Gouveia, his servitor Antonio
Ferreira, the old and the younger Marquis of Tavora, the old Marchioness
of Tavora, all servants of these two families, and five other nobles.
All Jesuit colleges were on that day surrounded by soldiers; Malagrida
and twelve other leading Jesuits were jailed. To accelerate matters, a
royal decree of December 20 permitted (against Portuguese custom) the
use of torture to elicit confes- sions. Under torture or threat of it
fifty prisoners were examined. Several confessions implicated the Duke
of Aveiro; he himself, under torture, ad- mitted his guilt; Antonio
Ferreira acknowledged that he had fired at the coach, but swore that he
had not known that the prospective victim was the King. Under torture
several servants of the Tavoras compromised that entire family; the
younger Marquis confessed complicity; the older Marquis, tor- tured to
the point of death, denied his guilt. Pombal himself assisted at the
examination of witnesses and prisoners. He had had the mails examined;
he claimed to have found in them twenty-four letters by the Duke of
Aveiro, by several Tavoras, by Malagrida and other Jesuits, notifying
their friends or relatives in Brazil of the abortive attempt, and
promising renewed efforts to overturn the government. On January 4,
1759, the King nominated Dr. Eusebio Tavares de Sequeira to defend the
accused. Sequeira argued that the confessions, elicited under torture,
were worthless as evidence, and that all the accused nobles could prove
alibis for the night of the crime. The defense was judged unconvincing;
the intercepted letters were held to be genuine and to corroborate the
confessions; and on January 12 the court declared all indicted persons
guilty.</p>
<p>Nine of them were executed on January 1 3 in the public square of
Belem. The first to die was the old Marchioness of Tavora. On the
scaffold the executioner bent to tie her feet; she repelled him, saying,
“Do not touch me except to kill me!” 18 After bein g compelled to see
the instruments — wheel, hammer, and faggots — by which her husband and
her sons were to die, she was beheaded. Her two sons were broken on the
wheel and strangled; their corpses lay on the scaffold when the Duke of
Aveiro and the old Marquis of Tavora mounted it. They suffered the same
shattering blows, and the Duke was allowed to linger in agony until the
last of the executions — the burning alive of Antonio Ferreira — was
complete. All the corpses were burned, and the ashes were thrown into
the Tagus. Portugal still debates whether the nobles, though admittedly
hostile to Pombal, had meant to kill the King.</p>
<p>Were the Jesuits involved in the attempt? There was no doubt that
Mala- grida, in his passionate fulminations, had predicted the fall of
Pombal and the early death of the King; 19 and no doubt that he and
other Jesuits had held</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xconferences with the minister’s titled foes. He h ad implied his
awareness of a plot by writing to a lady of the court a letter begging
her to put Joseph on his guard against an imminent danger. Asked, in
jail, how he had learned of such a peril, he replied, In the
confessional. 20 Aside from this (according to an anti- Jesuit
historian) “there is no positive evidence to connect the Jes - uits with
the outrage.” 21 Pombal accused them, by their preaching and teach -
ing, of having excited their allies to the point of murder. He persuaded
the King that the situation offered the monarchy an opportunity to
strengthen itself as against the Church. On January 19 Joseph issued
edicts attaching all Jesuit property in the kingdom, and confining all
Jesuits to their houses or colleges pending settlement, by the Pope, of
the charges against them. Mean- while Pombal used the government press
to print — and his agents to distribute widely, at home and abroad —
pamphlets stating the case against the nobles and the Jesuits; this was
apparently the first time that a government had made use of the printing
press to explain its actions to other nations. These publi- cations may
have had some influence in leading to the expulsion of the Jes- uits
from France and Spain.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1759 Pombal sought from Clement XIII permission to
submit the arrested Jesuits to trial before the Tribunal of High
Treason; moreover, he proposed that henceforth all ecclesiastics accused
of crimes against the state should be tried in secular, not
ecclesiastical, courts. A per- sonal letter from Joseph to the Pope
announced the King’s resolve to expel the Jesuits from Portugal, and
expressed the hope that the Pope would ap- prove the measure as
warranted by their actions and as necessary for the protection of the
monarchy. Clement was shocked by these messages, but he feared that if
he directly opposed them Pombal would induce the King to sever all
relations between the Portuguese Church and the papacy. He recalled the
action of Henry VIII in England, and knew that France too was developing
hostility against the Society of Jesus. On August 1 1 he sent his
permission to try the Jesuits before the secular tribunal, but
explicitly confined his consent to the present case. To the King he made
a personal appeal for mercy to the accused priests; he reminded Joseph
of the past achievements of the order, and trusted that all Portuguese
Jesuits would not be punished for the mistakes of a few.</p>
<p>The papal appeal failed. On September 3, 1759 — the anniversary of
the attempted assassination — the King issued an edict giving a long
list of alleged offenses by the Jesuits, and decreeing that</p>
<p>hese religious, being corrupt and deplorably fallen away from their
holy in- stitute [rule], and rendered manifestly incapable, by such
abominable and in- veterate vices, of returning to its observance, must
be properly and effectually banished,… proscribed, and expelled from all
his Majesty’s dominions, as notorious rebels, traitors, adversaries, and
aggressors of his royal person and realm;… and it is ordered, under the
irremissible pain of death, that no person, of whatever state or
condition, is to admit them into any of his pos- sessions, or hold any
communication with them by word or writing. 22</p>
<p>Those Jesuits who had not yet made their solemn profession, and who
should petition to be released from their preliminary vows, were
exempted from the</p>

<p>PORTUGAL AND POMBAL</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>decree. All Jesuit property was confiscated by the state; the exiles
were for- bidden to take anything with them but their personal clothing.
23 From all sections of Portugal they were led in coaches or on foot to
ships that took them to Italy. Similar deportations were carried out
from Brazil and other Portuguese possessions. The first shipload of
expatriates reached Civita- vecchia on October 24, and even Pombal’s
representative there was moved to pity by their condition. Some were
weak with age, some were near starva- tion, some had died on the way.
Lorenzo Ricci, general of the Society, ar- ranged for the reception of
the survivors into Jesuit houses in Italy, and the Dominican friars
shared in extending hospitality. On June 17, 1760, the Portuguese
government suspended diplomatic relations with the Vatican.</p>
<p>The victory of Pombal seemed complete, but he knew that it was unpop-
ular with the nation. Feeling insecure, he expanded his power to full
dicta- torship, and began a reign of absolutism and terror that
continued till 1777. His spies reported to him every detected expression
of opposition to his policies or his methods; soon the jails of Lisbon
were crowded with political prisoners. Many nobles and priests were
arrested on charges of new plots against the King, or of implication in
the old plot. The Junqueira fort, mid- way between Lisbon and Belem,
became the special jail of aristocrats, many of whom were kept there
till their death. Other prisons held — some for nineteen years — Jesuits
brought from the colonies and charged with resisting the government.</p>
<p>Malagrida languished in prison for thirty-two months before being
brought to trial. The old man solaced his confinement by writing The
Heroic Life of St. Anne, the Mother of Mary, Dictated to the Reverend
Father Mala- grida by St. Anne Herself. Pombal had the manuscript
seized, and found in it several absurdities that could be labeled
heresies; St. Anne, said Malagrida, had been conceived, like Mary,
without the stain of original sin, and she had spoken and wept in her
mother’s womb. 24 Having made his own brother,</p>
<p>The French philo sophes, who in 1758 had looked upon Pombal as an “en
- lightened despot,” were not pleased with his development. They
welcomed the overthrow of the Jesuits, but they deprecated the arbitrary
methods of</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xhe dictator, the violent tone of his pamphlets, and the barbarity of
his pun- ishments. They were shocked by the treatment of the Jesuits
during their deportation, by the wholesale execution of ancient
families, and by the inhu- mane treatment of Malagrida. We have,
however, no record of their protest- ing the eight-year imprisonment of
the bishop of Coimbra for condemning Pombal’s Censorship Board, w hich
had allowed the circulation of such radical works as Voltaire’s
Philosophical Dictionary and Rousseau’s Social Contract.</p>
<p>Pombal himself preached no heresies, and went to Mass regularly. He
aimed not at the destruction of the Church but at its subjection to the
King; and when, in 1770, Clement XIV agreed to let the government
nominate to bishoprics, he made his peace with the Vatican. Joseph I, as
he neared death, rejoiced in the thought that, after all, he might die
with full benefit of clergy. The Pope sent a cardinal’s hat to Pombal’s
brother Paul, and to Pombal himself a ring bearing the papal portrait,
and a miniature framed in diamonds, and the entire cadavers of four
saints.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>POMBAL THE REFORMER</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile the dictator had left his mark upon the economy,
administra- tion, and cultural life of Portugal. With the help of
English and German officers he reorganized the army, which turned back a
Spanish invasion in the Seven Years’ War. Like Richelieu in seventeenth
-century France, he reduced the disruptive power of the aristocracy, and
centralized the govern- ment in a monarchy that could give the nation
political unity, educational development, and some protection from
ecclesiastical domination. After the execution of the Tavoras the nobles
ceased to plot against the king; after the expulsion of the Jesuits the
clergy submitted to the state. During the aliena- tion from the Vatican
Pombal appointed the bishops, and his bishops or- dained priests without
reference to Rome. A royal decree curtailed the acquisition of land by
the Church, and restrained Portuguese subjects from burdening their
estates with bequests for Masses. 28 Many convents were closed, and the
rest were forbidden to receive novices under twenty-five years of age.
The Inquisition was brought under government control: its tribunal was
made a public court, subject to the same rules as the courts of the
state; it was shorn of censorship powers; its distinction between Old
Christians and New Christians (Christianized Jews or Moors, and their
de- scendants) was abolished, for Pombal took it for granted that most
Spaniards and Portuguese had now some Semitic strain in their blood. 29
A decree of May 25, 1773, made all Portuguese subjects eligible to
civil, military, and ecclesiastical office. 30 There was no burning of
persons by the Portuguese Inquisition after that of Malagrida in 1761.
31</p>
<p>In that year Pombal abolished three quarters of the petty offices
that had hampered the administration of justice; the law courts were
made more ac- cessible, litigation was made less expensive. In 1761 he
reorganized the Treas- ury, required it to balance its books every week,
ordered yearly audits of</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>PORTUGAL AND POMBAL</p>
<p>municipal revenues and expenditures, and made some progress in the
most difficult reforms of all — the reduction of personnel and
extravagance at the royal court. The eighty cooks that had fed John V
and his entourage were weeded out; Joseph I had to content himself with
twenty. An edict of May 25, 1773, in effect abolished slavery in
Portugal, but allowed it to continue in the colonies.</p>
<p>The reformer’s hand moved everywhere. He gave governmental support to
agriculture and fisheries, and introduced the silkworm into the northern
provinces. He established potteries, glassworks, cotton mills, woolen
fac- tories, and paper plants, to end the dependence of Portugal upon
the im- portation of such products from abroad. He abolished internal
tolls in the movement of goods, and established free trade between
Portugal and her American colonies. He founded a College of Commerce to
train men for business management. He organized and subsidized companies
to take over Portuguese trade from foreign merchants and carriers; here
he — or the Portu- guese-failed, for in 1780 the commerce of Portugal
was still mostly in for- eign, chiefly in British, hands.</p>
<p>The expulsion of the Jesuits necessitated a thorough reconstruction
of education. New elementary and secondary schools, to the number of
837, were scattered over the land. The Jesuit college at Lisbon was
transformed into a College of Nobles under secular administration. The
curriculum at Coimbra was enlarged with additional courses in science.
Pombal persuaded the King to build an opera house and to invite Italian
singers to lead the casts. In 1757 he founded the Arcadia de Lisboa for
the stimulation of literature.</p>
<p>For an exciting half century (1755-1805) Portuguese literature
enjoyed a relative freedom of ideas and forms. Liberating itself from
Italian models, it acknowledged the spell of France, and felt some
zephyrs of the Enlighten- ment. Antonio Diniz da Cruz e Silva won
national fame by a satire, O Hissope (1772), describing in eight cantos
the quarrel of a bishop with his dean. Joao Anastasio da Cunha
translated Pope and Voltaire, for which he was condemned by the
Inquisition (1778) soon after Pombal’s fall. Francisco Manoel do
Nascimento, son of a longshoreman, took passionately to books, and
became the center of a group that rebelled against the Arcadian Acad-
emy as a drag on the development of national poetry. In 1778 (again
taking advantage of Pombal’s fall) the Inquisition ordered his arrest as
being ad - dicted “to modern philosophers who follow natural reason.” He
escaped to France, where he spent nearly all his remaining forty-one
years; there he wrote most of his poems, ardent for freedom and
democracy, including an ode “To the Liberty and Independence of the
United States.” His followers ranked him as second only to Camoes in
Portuguese poetry. — The most elegant and melodious verse of the age was
in a volume of love poems, A Marilia, bequeathed by Tomaz Antonio
Gonzaga, who suffered imprison- ment (1785-88) for political conspiracy,
and died in exile. — Jose Agostinho de Macedo, an Augustinian friar
unfrocked because of his dissipated life, boldly took for the subject of
his epic, O Oriente, the same subject as Camoes</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>X— the voyage of Vasco da Gama to India; he judged his poem superior
to the Lusiads and the Iliad, but we are assured that it is a dreary
performance. More interesting was a satire in six cantos, Os Burros, in
which Macedo pilloried by name men and women of all ranks, living or
dead. — His favor- ite enemy was Manuel Maria Barbosa de Bocage, who was
imprisoned by the Inquisition (1797) on a charge of spreading Voltairean
ideas in his verse and plays. The execution of Marie Antoinette turned
him back to conserva- tism in religion and politics; he recaptured his
youthful piety, and saw in the mosquito a proof of the existence of God.
32</p>
<p>The great event in the art history of Pombal’s regime was the statue
raised to Joseph I, which still st ands in Lisbon’s Black Horse Square.
Designed by Joaquim Machado de Castro, cast in bronze by Bartolommeo da
Costa, it represented the King riding a steed victoriously over serpents
symbolizing the evil forces overcome during his reign. Pombal made the
inauguration of the monument (June 6, 1775) a celebration of his
triumphant ministry. Troops of soldiery lined the square; the diplomatic
corps, the judiciary, the Senate, and other dignitaries were assembled
in full costume; then came the court, then the King and the Queen;
finally Pombal came forward and un- veiled the figures and the massive
pedestal, on which a medallion pictured the minister wearing the Cross
of Christ. Everyone but the King understood that the real subject of the
celebration was Pombal.</p>
<p>A few days after the unveiling he sent to Joseph I a rosy-colored
descrip- tion of the progress made by Portugal since 1750: the spread of
education and literacy, the growth of manufactures and trade, the
development of literature and art, the general rise in the standard of
living. Truth must make many deductions from his account: industry and
trade were growing, but very slowly, and were in financial difficulties;
the arts were stagnant, and half of Lisbon still lay (1774) in the ruins
caused by the earthquake of 1755. The natural piety of the people was
restoring ecclesiastical power. Pombal’s lordly manners and dictatorial
methods were making new enemies every day. He had enriched himself and
his relatives; he had built for himself an extravagantly costly palace.
There was hardly a noble family in the kingdom that did not have a
beloved member wasting away in jail. Everywhere in Portugal there were
secret hopes and prayers for PombaPs fall.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE TRIUMPH OF THE PAST</li>
</ol>
<p>The King was sixty years old in 1775. Illnesses and mistresses had
aged him beyond his years, and he spent hours in meditation on sin and
death. He wondered had he been right in following the policies of his
minister. Had he been just to the Jesuits? Those nobles and priests in
prison — he would gladly have pardoned them, now that he sought pardon
for himself, but how could he mention such an idea to the unrelenting
Pombal, and what could he do without Pombal? On November 12, 1776, he
suffered an apoplectic stroke, and the court almost visibly rejoiced in
expectation of a new reign and a new ministry. The heir to the throne
was his daughter Maria Francisca, who</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>PORTUGAL AND POMBAL</p>
<p>2 7 I</p>
<p>had married his brother Pedro. She was a good woman, a good wife and
mother, a kind and charitable soul, but she was also a fervent Catholic,
who had so resented Pombal’s anticlericalism that she had left the court
to live quietly with Pedro at Queluz, a few miles from the capital. The
foreign diplo- mats notified their governments to expect an early
reversal of Portuguese policies.</p>
<p>On November 18 the King received the sacraments; on November 29 Maria
became regent. One of her first acts was to end the bishop of Coim-
bra’s long imprisonment; the seventy -four-year-old prelate was restored
to his see amid almost universal rejoicing. Pombal saw his authority
waning, and noted with somber premonitions that courtiers lately
subservient to him now looked upon him as politically moribund. In a
final act of despotism he took a wild revenge upon the village of
Trefaria, whose fisherfolk had op- posed the forcible impressment of
their sons into the army; he ordered a platoon of soldiers to burn the
village down; they did it by flinging lighted torches through the
windows of the wooden cottages in the dark of night (January 23,
1777).</p>
<p>On February 24 Joseph I died; the regent became Queen Maria I (r.
1777-</p>
<p>1816), and her husband became King Pedro III (r. 1777-86). Pedro was
a man of weak mind; Maria absorbed herself in piety and charity.
Religion, which was half the life of the Portuguese people, rapidly
recovered its power. The Inquisition resumed its activity in censorship
and the suppression of heresy. Queen Maria sent forty thousand pounds to
the papacy to partially reimburse it for expenses incurred in caring for
the banished Jesuits. On the day after Joseph’s burial Queen Maria
ordered the release of eight hundred prisoners, most of them
incarcerated by Pombal for political opposition. Many of them had been
in the dungeons for twenty years; when they emerged their eyes could not
bear the sun; nearly all were in rags; many looked twice their age.
Hundreds of prisoners had died in jail. Of the 124 Jesuits who had been
imprisoned eighteen years before, only forty-five still lived. 33 Five
nobles condemned for alleged complicity in the plot to kill Joseph
refused to leave prison until their innocence had been officially de-
clared.</p>
<p>The sight of the released victims of Pombal’s hostility, and the news
of the burning of Trefaria, brought his unpopularity to the point where
he no longer ventured to show himself in public. On March 1 he sent to
Queen Maria a letter resigning all his offices and asking permission to
retire to his estate in the town of Pombal. The nobles who surrounded
the Queen de- manded his imprisonment and punishment; but when she
discovered that all the measures which they resented had been signed by
the late King, she decided that she could not punish Pombal without
laying a public stain upon her father’s memory. She accepted the
minister’s resignation, and allowed him to retire to Pombal, but she
ordered him to remain there. On March 5 he left Lisbon in a hired
chaise, hoping to escape notice; some people recog- nized him and stoned
his carriage, but he escaped. At the town of Oeiras his wife joined him.
He was seventy-seven years old.</p>
<p>Now that he was only a private citizen he was assailed from every
side by</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xsuits for debts he had neglected to pay, for injuries he had
inflicted, for properties he had taken without adequate compensation.
Bailiffs besieged his doors at Pombal with a succession of writs. “There
is not a hornet or a gnat in Portugal,” he wrote, “that does not fly to
this remote spot and buzz in my ears.” 34 The Queen helped him by
granting continuance for life of the salary he had received as minister,
and added to it a modest pension. Nevertheless countless enemies urged
the Queen to summon him to trial on charges of malfeasance and treason.
She compromised by allowing judges to visit him and subject him to
examination on the charges. They questioned him for hours at a time
through three and a half months, until the old dictator, ex- hausted,
begged for mercy. The Queen delayed action on the report of the
examination, hoping that Pombal’ s death might relieve her
embarrassment; meanwhile she sought to appease his foes by ordering
retrial of those who had been convicted of complicity in the attempt
upon her father. The new court confirmed the guilt of the Duke of Aveiro
and three of his servants, but exonerated all the rest of the accused.
The Tavoras were declared innocent, and all their honors and property
were remitted to their survivors (April 3,</p>
<p>1781). On August 16 the Queen issued a decree condemning Pombal as an
“infamous criminal,” but adding that since he had begged for pardon he
was to be left at peace in his exile and in the possession of his
property.</p>
<p>Pombal was entering upon his final illness. His body was almost
covered with pus-oozing sores, apparently from leprosy. 35 Pain kept him
from sleep- ing more than two hours in a day; dysentery weakened him;
and his doctors, as if to add to his torments, persuaded him to drink a
broth made from the flesh of snakes. He prayed for death, received the
sacraments, and ended his sufferings on May 8, 1782. Forty-five years
later a party of Jesuits, passing through the town, stopped at his grave
and recited a requiem, in triumph and pity, for the repose of his
soul.</p>
