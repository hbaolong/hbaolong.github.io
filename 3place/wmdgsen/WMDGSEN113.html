<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>XPhilip</p>
<p>I. THE SPARTAN EMPIRE</p>
<p>S PARTA now assumed for a spell the naval mastery of Greece, and</p>
<p>offered to history another tragedy of success brought low by
pride.</p>
<p>Instead of the freedom which she had promised to the cities once
subject to Athens, she levied upon them an annual tribute of a thousand
talents (,000,000), and established in each of them an aristocratic rule
con- trolled by a Lacedaemonian harmost, or governor, and supported by a
Spartan garrison. These governments, responsible only to the distant
eph- ors, practiced such corruption and tyranny that soon the new empire
was hated more intensely than the old.</p>
<p>In Sparta itself the influx of money and gifts from oppressed cities
and obsequious oligarchs strengthened the internal forces that had long
been leading to decay. By the fourth century the ruling caste had
learned how to add private luxury to public simplicity, and even the
ephors had ceased, except in outward show, to observe the Lycurgean
discipline. Much of the land, by dowries and bequests, had fallen into
the hands of women; and the wealth so accumulated gave to the Spartan
ladies — free from the care of male children — an ease of life and
morals hardly befitting their name.‘ The repeated division of some
estates had impoverished many families to a point where they could no
longer contribute their quota to the public mess, and therefore lost the
rights of citizenship; while the for- mation of large properties through
intermarriage and legacies had created in the few remaining “Equals” a
provocative concentration of wealth.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile civil war among the Persians was affecting the fortunes
of</p>
<p>• The homoioif or Equals, numbered eight thousand in 480, two
thousand in 371, seven hundred in 341.*</p>
<p>A59</p>
<p>4&lt;So THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.XI</p>
<p>XGreece. In 401 the younger Cyrus rebelled against his brother
Artaxerxes II, enlisted Sparta’s aid, and recruited an army from the
thousands of Greek and other mercenaries left idle in Asia by the sudden
termination of the Peloponnesian War. The two brothers met at Cunaxa,
between the con- verging Tigris and Euphrates; Cyrus was defeated and
slain, and all of his army was captured or destroyed except a contingent
of twelve thousand Greeks whose quickness of mind and foot enabled them
to escape into the interior of Babylonia. Hunted by the King’s forces,
the Greeks chose, in their rough democratic way, three generals to lead
them to safety. Among these was Xenophon, once a pupil of Socrates, now
a young sol- dier of fortune, destined to be remembered above all by the
Anabasis, or Ascent, in which he later described with engaging
simplicity the long “Re - treat of the Ten Thousand” up along the Tigris
and over the hills of Kur - distan and Armenia to the Black Sea. It was
one of the great adventures in human history. We are amazed at the
inexhaustible courage of these Greeks, fighting their way on foot, day
by day for five months, through two thousand miles of enemy country,
across hot and foodless plains, and over perilous mountain passes
covered with eight feet of snow, while armies and guerrilla bands
attacked them in the rear and in front and on either flank, and hostile
natives used every device to kill them, or mislead them, or bar their
way. As we read this fascinating story, made so dull for us in youth by
the compulsion to translate it, we perceive’ that the most im- portant
weapon for an army is food, and that the skill of a commander lies as
much in finding supplies as in organizing victory. More of these Greeks
died from exposure and starvation than from battle, though the battles
were as numerous as the days. When at last the 8600 survivors sighted
the Euxine at Trapezus (Trebizond), their hearts overflowed.</p>
<p>As soon as the vanguard got to the top of the mountains, a great</p>
<p>cry went up. And when Xenophon and the rear guard heard it</p>
<p>they imagined that other enemies were attacking in front — for ene-
mies were following behind them. . . . They pushed ahead to lend</p>
<p>aid, and in a moment they heard the soldiers shouting, “Tlie sea!</p>
<p>the sea!” and passing the word along. Then all the troops of the</p>
<p>rear guard likewise broke into a run, and the pack animals began</p>
<p>racing ahead. . . . And when all had reached the summit, then in-</p>
<p>deed they fell to embracing one another, and generals and captains as
weU, with tears in their eyes.*</p>
<p>For this was a Greek sea, and Trapezus a Greek city; they were safe
now, and could rest without fear of death surprising them in the night.
The</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XDC)</p>
<p>461</p>
<p>news of their exploit resounded proudly through old Hellas, and en-
couraged Philip, two generations later, to believe that a well-trained
Greek force could be relied upon to defeat a Persian army many times its
size. Unwittingly Xenophon opened the way for Alexander.</p>
<p>Perhaps this influence was already felt by Agesilaus, who in 399 had
succeeded to the throne of Sparta. Persia might have been persuaded to
overlook Sparta’s aid to Cyrus. But to the ablest of the Spartan kings a
war with Persia seemed only an interesting adventure, and he set out
with a small force to free all Greek Asia from Persian rule.* When
Artaxerxes II learned that Agesilaus was easily defeating all Persian
troops sent against him, he dispatched messengers with abundant gold to
Athens and Thebes to bribe these cities into declaring war upon Sparta.“
The effort readily succeeded, and after nine years of peace the conflict
between Athens and Sparta was renewed. Agesilaus was recalled from Asia
to meet, and barely defeat, the combined forces of Athens and Thebes at
Coronea; but in the same month the united fleets of Athens and Persia
under Conon destroyed the Spartan navy near Cnidus, and put an end to
Sparta’s brief domina - tion of the seas. Athens rejoiced, and set to
work energetically, with funds supplied by Persia, to rebuild her Long
Walls. Sparta defended herself by sending an envoy, Antalcidas, to the
Great King, offering to surrender the Greek cities of Asia to Persian
rule if Persia would enforce among the mainlan d Greeks a peace that
would protect Sparta. The Great King agreed, withdrew his financial
support from Athens and Thebes, and com- pelled all parties to sign at
Sardis (387) the “Peace of Antalcidas,” or the “King’s Peace.” Lemnos,
Imbros, and Scyros were conceded to Athens, and the major Greek states
were guaranteed autonomy; but all the Greek cities of Asia, along with
Cyprus, were declared the property of the King. Athens signed under
protest, knowing that this was the most disgraceful event in Greek
history. For a generation all the fruits of Marathon were lost; the
Greek states of the mainland remained free in name, but in effect the
power of Persia had engulfed them. All Greece looked upon Sparta as a
traitor, and waited eagerly for some nation to destroy her.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>EPAIVIINONDAS</li>
</ol>
<p>As if to strengthen this feeling, Sparta assumed the authority to
interpret and enforce the King’s Peace among the Greek states. To weaken
Thebes</p>
<p>• “In what respect,” he asked, “is the ’Great King* greater than I,
unless he is more upright and self- restrained?”*</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>462</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xshe insisted that the Boeotian Confederacy violated the autonomy
clause of the treaty, and must be dissolved. With this excuse the
Spartan army set up in many Boeotian cities oligarchic governments
favorable to Sparta and in several cases upheld by Spartan garrisons.
When Thebes protested, a Lacedaemonian force captured her citadel, the
Cadmeia, and established an oligarchy subject to Spartan domination. The
crisis aroused Thebes to unwonted heroism. Pelopidas and six companions
assassinated the four “Laconizing” dictators of Thebes, and reasserted
Theban liberty. The Confederacy was reorganized, and natned Pelopidas
its leader, or boeotarch. Pelopidas called to his aid his friend and
lover Epaminondas, who trained and led the army that reduced Sparta to
her ancient isolation.</p>
<p>Epaminondas came of a distinguished but impoverished family which
proudly traced its origin to the dragon’s teeth sown by Cadmus a
thousand years before. He was a quiet man, of whom it was said that no
one talked less or knew more.’ His modesty and integrity, his almost
ascetic life, his devotion to his friends, his prudence in counsel, his
courage and yet self- restraint in action, endeared him to all the
Thebans despite the military discipline to which he subjected them. He
did not love war, but he was convinced that no nation could lose all
martial spirit and habits and yet maintain its freedom. Elected and many
times re-elected boeotarch, he warned those who proposed to vote for
him: “Bethink yourselves once more; for if I am made general you will be
compelled to serve in my army.”“ Under his command the lax Thebans were
drilled into goo d sol- diers; even the “Greek lovers” who were so
numerous in the city were formed by Pelopidas into a “Sacred Band” of
three hundred hoplites, each of whom was pledged to stand by his friend,
in battle, to the death.</p>
<p>When a Spartan army of ten thousand troops under King Cleombrotus
invaded Boeotia, Epaminondas met it at Leuctra, near Plataea, with six
thousand men, and won a victory that influenced the political history of
Greece and the military methods of Europe. He was the first Hellene to
make a careful study of tactics; he counted on facing odds in every
battle, and concentrated his best fighters upon one wing for offense,
while the remainder were ordered to follow a policy of defense; in this
way the enemy, advancing in the center, could be disordered by a flank
attack on its left. After Leuctra Epaminondas and Pelopidas marched into
the Pelo- ponnesus, freed Messenia from its century-long vassalage to
Sparta, and founded the city of Megalopolis as a stronghold for all
Arcadians. Even into Laconia the Theban army descended — an event
without precedent for hundreds of years past. Sparta never recovered
from her losses in this</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>463</p>
<p>campaign: “She could not stand up against a single defeat,” says
Aristotle, “but was ruined through the small number of her
citizens.”’</p>
<p>Winter coming, the Thebans withdrew to Boeotia. Epaminondas, over-
reaching himself in typical Greek style, began to dream now of
establish- ing a Theban Empire to replace the unity that Athenian or
Spartan lead- ership had once given to Greece. His plans involved him in
a war with the Athenians; and Sparta, thinking to rehabilitate herself,
made an alliance with Athens. The hostile armies met at Mantinea in 362.
Epaminondas won, but was killed in action by Gryllus, son of Xenophon.
The brief hegemony of Thebes left no permanent boon to Hellas; it
liberated Greece from the despotism of Sparta, but failed, like its
predecessors, to create beyond Boeotia a coherent unity; and the
conflicts that it engendered left the Greek states disordered and
weakened when Philip came down upon them from the north.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE SECOND ATHENIAN EMPIRE</li>
</ol>
<p>Athens made a final attempt to forge such a unity. Through her
rebuilt walls and fleet, the dependability of her coinage, her
long-established facili- ties for finance and trade, she slowly won back
commercial supremacy in the Aegean. Her former subjects and allies had
learned from the wars of the last half century the need for a larger
security than individual sov- ereignty could bring; and in 378 the
majority of them combined again under Athens’ leadership. By 370 Athens
was once more the greatest power in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Industry and trade were now the substance of her economic life. The
soil of Attica had never been propitious to common tillage; patient
labor had made it fruitful through tending the olive tree and the vine;
but the Spartans had destroyed these, and few of the peasants were
Avilling to wait half a generation for new olive orchards to yield. Most
of the farmers of prewar days were dead; many of the survivors were too
discouraged to go back to their ruined holdings, and sold them at low
prices to absentee owners who could afford long-term investments. In
this way, and through the eviction of peasant debtors, the ownership of
Attica passed into a few families, who worked many of the large estates
with slaves.” The mines at Laurium were reopened, fresh victims were
sent into the pits, and new riches were transmuted 6u t of silver ore
and human blood. Xenophon” proposed a genial plan whereby Athens might
replenish her treasury through the purchase of ten thousand slaves and
their lease to the con-</p>
<p>464 THE I.IFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xtractors at Laurium. Silver was mined in such abundance that the
supply of the metal outran the production of goods, prices rose faster
than wages, and the poor bore the burden of the change.</p>
<p>Industry flourished. The quarries at Pentelicus and the potteries in
the Ceramicus had orders from all the Aegean world. Fortunes were made
by buying cheap the products of domestic handicraft or small factories,
and selling them dear in the home market or abroad. The growth of com-
merce and the accumulation of wealth in money instead of in land rapidly
multiplied the number of bankers in Athens. They received cash or valu-
ables for safekeeping, but apparently paid no interest on deposits. Soon
discovering that under normal conditions not all deposits were reclaimed
at once, the bankers began to lend funds at substantial rates of
interest, providing, at first, money instead of credit. They acted as
bail for clients, and made collections for them; they lent money on the
security of land or precious articles, and helped to finance the
shipment of goods. Through their aid, and even more through speculative
loans by private individuals, the merchant might hire a ship, transport
his goods to a foreign market, and buy there a return cargo — which, on
reaching the Piraeus, remained the property of the lenders until the
loan was repaid.^ As the fourth century progressed, a real credit system
developed: the bankers, instead of advancing cash, issued letters of
credit, money orders, or checks; wealth could now pass from one client
to another merely by entries in the banker’s books.“ Businessmen or
bankers issued bonds for mercantile loans, and every large inheritance
included a number of such bonds. Some bankers, like the ex- slave
Pasion, developed so many connections, and acquired by a dis-
criminating honesty so widespread a reputation for reliability, that
their bond was honored throughout the Greek world. Pasion’s bank had
many departments and employees, mostly slaves; it kept a complex set of
books, in which every transaction was so carefully recorded that these
accounts were usually accepted in court as indisputable evidence. Bank
failures were not uncommon, and we hear of “panics” in which bank after
bank closed its doors.” Serious charges of malfeasance were brought
against e ven the most prominent banks, and the people looked upon the
bankers with that same mixture of envy, admiration, and dislike with
which the poor favor the rich in all ages.“</p>
<p>The change from landed to movable wealth produced a feverish strug-
gle for money, and the Greek language had to invent a word, pleonexia,
to denote this appetite for “more and more,” and another word,
chrematistike, for the busy pursuit of riches. Goods, services, and
persons were increas-</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>465</p>
<p>ingly judged in terms of money and property. Fortunes were made and
unmade with a new rapidity, and were spent in lavish displays that would
have shocked the Athens of Pericles. The nouveaux riches (the Greeks had
a name for t m — neoplutoi) built gaudy houses, bedecked their women
with costly robes and jewels, spoiled them with a dozen servants, and
made it a principle to feed their guests with none but expensive drinks
and foods.“</p>
<p>In the midst of this wealth poverty increased, for the same variety
apd freedom of exchange that enabled the clever to make money allowed
the simple to lose it faster than before. Under the new mercantile
economy the poor were relatively poorer than in the days of their
serfdom on the land. In the countryside the peasants laboriously turned
their sweat into a little oil or wine; in the towns the wages of free
labor were kept down by the competition of slaves. Hundreds of citizens
depended for their maintenance upon the fees paid for attendance at the
Assembly or the courts; thousands of the population had to be fed by the
temples or the state. The number of voters (not to speak of the general
population) who had no property was in 43 1 some forty-five per cent of
the electorate; in 355 it had mounted to fifty-seven per cent.” The
middle classes, which had provided by their aggregate number and power a
balance between the aristocracy and the commons, had lost much of their
wealth, and could no longer mediate between the rich and the poor,
between an unyielding conservatism and a utopian radicalism; Athenian
society divided itself into Plato’s “two cities”— “one the city of the
poor, the other of the rich, the one at war with the other.”” The poor
schemed to despoil the rich by legislation or revolution, the rich
organized themselves for protection against the poor. The members of
some oligarchic clubs, says Aristotle, took a solemn oath: “I will be an
adversary of the people” (i.e., the com - mons), “and in the Council I
will do it all the evil that I can.”” “T he rich have become so
unsocial,” writes Isocrates, about 366, “that those who own property had
rather throw their possessions into the sea than lend aid to the needy,
while those who are in poorer circumstances would less gladly find a
treasure than s eize the possessions of the rich.””</p>
<p>In this conflict more and more of the intellectual classes took the
side of the poor.” They disdained the merchants and bankers whose wealth
seemed to be in inverse proportion to their culture and taste; even rich
men among them, like Plato, began to flirt with communistic ideas. Peri-
cles had used colonization as a safety valve to reduce the intensity of
the class struggle;” but Dionysius controlled the west, Macedonia was
expand -</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>466</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xing in the north, and Athens found it ever more difficult to conquer
and settle new lands. Finally the poorer citizens captured the Assembly,
and began to vote the property of the rich into the coffers of the
state, for redistribution among the needy and the voters through state
enterprises and fees.” The politicians strained their ingenuity to
discover new sources of public revenue. They doubled the indirect taxes,
the customs dues on imports and exports, and the hundredth on
real-estate transfers; they con- tinued the extraordinary taxes of war
time into peace; they appealed for “voluntary” contributions, and laid
upon the rich ever new opportunities (“liturgies”) to finance public
enterprises from their private funds; they resorted every now and then
to confiscations and expropriations; and they broadened the field of the
property-income tax to include lower levels of wealth.” Any man burdened
with a liturgy could by law compel another to take it over if he could
prove that the other was wealthier than he, and had borne no liturgy
within two years. To facilitate the collection of rev- enue the
taxpayers were divided into a hundred “symmories” (cosharers); the
richest members of each group were required to pay, at the opening of
each tax year, the whole tax due from the group for the year, and were
left to collect during the year, as best they could, the shares due from
the other members of the group. The result of these imposts was a
wholesale hiding of wealth and income. Evasion became universal, and as
ingenious as taxation. In 355 Androtion was appointed to head a squad of
police em- powered to search for hidden income, collect arrears, and
imprison tax evaders. Houses were entered, goods were seized, men were
thrown into jail. But the wealth still hid itself, or melted away.
Isocrates, old and rich, and furious at being saddled with a liturgy,
complained in 353: “When I was a boy, wealth was regarded as a thing so
secure as well as admirable that almost everyone affected to own more
property than he actually possessed. . . . Now a man has to be ready to
defend himself against being rich as if it were the worst of crimes.””
In other cities the process of decentralizing wealth was not so legal:
the debtors of Mytilene massacred their creditors en masse, and excused
themselves on the ground that they were hungry; the democrats of Argos
(370) suddenly fell upon the rich, killed twelve hundred of them, and
confiscated their property. The moneyed families of otherwise hostile
states leagued themselves secretly for mutual aid against popular
revolts. The middle classes, as well as the rich, began to distrust
democracy as empowered envy, and the poor began to distrust it as a sham
equality of votes stultified by a gaping inequality of wealth. The
increas- ing bitterness of the class war left Greece internally as well
as internation-</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>467</p>
<p>ally divided when Philip pounced down upon it; and many rich men in
the Greek cities welcomed his coming as the alternative to
revolution.“</p>
<p>Moral disorder accompanied the growth of luxury and the enlighten-
ment of the mind. The masses cherished their superstitions and clung to
their myths; the gods of Olympus were dying, but new ones were being
born; exotic divinities like Isis and Ammon, Atys and Bendis, Cybele and
Adonis were imported from Egypt or Asia, and the spread of Orphism
brought fresh devotees to Dionysus every day. The rising and half-alien
bourgeoisie of Athens, trained to practical calculation rather than to
mystic feeling, had little use for the traditional faith; the patron
gods of the city won from them only a formal reverence, and no longer
inspired them with moral scruples or devotion to the state.* Philosophy
struggled to find in civic loyalty and a natural ethic some substitute
for divine commandments and a surveillant deity; but few citizens cared
to live with the simplicity of Socrates, or the magnanimity of
Aristotle’s “great - minded man.”</p>
<p>As the state religion lost its hold upon the educated classes, the
individual freed himself more and more from the old moral restraints —
the son from parental authority, the male from marriage, the woman from
motherhood, the citizen from political responsibility. Doubtless
Aristophanes exagger- ated these developments; and though Plato,
Xenophon, and Isocrates agreed with him, they were all conservatives who
might be relied upon to trem- ble at any doings of the growing
generation. The morals of war improved in the fourth century, and a wave
of Enlightenment humanitarianism fol- lowed the teachings of Euripides
and Socrates, and the example of Ages- ilaus.“ But sexual and political
morality continued to decline. Bachelors and courtesans increased in
fashionable co-operation, and free unions gained ground on legal
marriage.“ “Is not a concubine more desirable than a wife?” asks a
character in a fourth - century comedy. “The one has on her side the law
that compels you to retain her, no matter how displeasing she may be;
the other knows that she must hold a man by behaving well, or else look
for another.”” So Praxiteles and then Hypereides lived with Phryne,
Aristippus with Lais, Stilpo with Nicarete, Lysias with Metaneira, the
austere Isocrates with Lagiscium.“ “The young men,” says Theopom - pus,
with a moralist’s exaggeration, “spent all their time among flute -girls
and courtesans; those who were a little older devoted themselves to

<p>•^’Now that a certain portion of mankind” says Plato (Laws, 948), “do
not believ e at all in the existence of the gods … a rational
legislation ought to do away with the oaths of the parties on either
side.”</p>

<p>bling and profligacy; and the whole people spent more on public
banquets and entertainments than on the provision necessary for the
well-being of the state.””</p>
<p>The voluntary limitation of the family was the order of the day,
whether by contraception, by abortion, or by infanticide. Aristotle
notes that some women prevent conception “ by anointing that part of the
womb upon which the seed falls with oil of cedar, or ointment of lead,
or frankincense commingled with olive oil.”*” The old families were
dying out; they</p>
<p>existed, said Isocrates, only in their tombs; the lower classes were
multiply- ing, but the citizen class in Attica had fallen from 43,000 in
43 1 to 22,000 in 400 and 21,000 in 313.” The supply of citizens for
military service suf - fered a corresponding decrease, partly from the
dysgenic carnage of war, partly from the reduced number of those who had
a property stake in the state, partly from unwillingness to serve; the
life of comfort and domes- ticity, of business and scholarship, had
replaced the Periclean life of exer- cise, martial discipline, and
public ofKce. ” Athletics were professionalized; the citizens who in the
sixth century had crowded the palaestra and the gymnasium were now
content to exert themselves vicariously by witness- ing professional
exhibitions. Young men received some grounding, as epheboi, in the art
of war; but adults found a hundred ways of escaping mili- tary service.
War itself had become professionalized by technical compli- cations, and
required the full time of specially trained men; citizen soldiers had to
be replaced with mercenaries — an omen that the leadership of Greece
must soon pass from statesmen to warriors. While Plato talked of
philoso- pher kings, soldier kings were growing up under his nose. Greek
mer- cenaries sold themselves impartially to Greek or “barbarian” ge
nerals, and fought as often against Greece as for her; the Persian
armies that Alexan- der faced were full of Greeks. Soldiers shed their
blood now not for a fatherland, but for the best paymaster that they
could find.</p>
<p>Making honorable exceptions for the archonship of Eucleides (403) and
the financial administration of Lycurgus (338-26), the political
corruption and turbulence that had followed the death of Pericles
continued during the fourth century. According to the law, bribery was
punished with death; according to Isocrates,” it was rewarded with
military and political preferment. Persia had no difiiculty in bribing
the Greek politicians to make war upon other Greek states or upon
Macedon; at last even Demos-</p>

<p>thenes illustrated the morals of his time. He was one of the noblest
of one of the lowest groups in Athens — the rhetors or hired orators who
in this century became professional lawyers and politicians. Some of
these men, like Lycurgus, were reasonably honest; some of them, like
Hypereides, were gallant; most of them were no better than they had to
be. If we may take Aristotle’s word for it, many of them specialized in
invalidating wills.“ Several of them laid up great fortunes through
political opportunism and reckless demagogy. The rhetors divided into
parties, and tore the air with their campaigns. Each party organized
committees, invented catchwords, appointed agents, and raised funds;
those who paid the expenses of all this frankly confessed that they
expected to “reimburse themselves doubly.”“ As politics grew more
intense, patriotism waned; the bitterness of faction absorbed public
energy and devotion, and left little for the city. The con- stitution of
Cleisthenes and the individualism of commerce and philosophy had
weakened the family and liberated the individual; now the free indi-
vidual, as if to avenge the family, turned around and destroyed the
state. In or near 400 the triumphant democrats, to insure the presence
of the poorer citizens at the ekklesia and thereby to prevent its
domination by the propertied classes, extended state payment to
attendance at the Assem- bly. At first each citizen received an obol (17
cents); as the cost of living rose this was increased to two obols, then
to three, until in Aristotle’s time it stood at a drachma ( $ i ) per
day.“ It was a reasonable arrangement, for the ordinary citizen towards
the end of the fourth century, earned a drachma and a half for a day’s
work; he could not be expected to leave his employ - ment without some
recompense. The plan soon gave the poor a majority in the Assembly; more
and more the well to do, despairing of victory, stayed home. It was of
no use that a revision of the constitution in 403 con- fined the power
of legislation to a body of five nomothetai, or lawmakers, selected from
the citizens chosen by lot for jury service; this new group also
inclined to the side of the commons, and its interposition lowered the
prestige and authority of the more conservative Council. Perhaps in con-
sequence of the payment for attendance, the level of intelligence in the
Assembly seems to have fallen in the fourth century — though our
authori- ties for this are prejudiced reactionaries like Aristophanes
and Plato.“ Isocrates thought that the Assembly should be paid by
Athens’ enemies to meet frequently, since it made so many mistakes.“</p>
<p>These mistakes cost Athens both her empire and her freedom. The same
lust for wealth and power that had undermined the first Confederacy now
wrecked the second. After the fall of Sparta at Leuctra Athens felt
that</p>
<p>470</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(CHAP.XK</p>
<p>it might again expand. In organizing the new empire she had pledged
her- self not to permit the appropriation of land outside of Attica by
Athenian subjects.“ Now she conquered Samos, the Thracian Chersonese,
and the cities of Pydna, Potidaea, and Methone on the coasts of
Macedonia and Thrace, and colonized them with Athenian citizens. The
allied states pro- tested, and many of them withdrew from the
Confederation. Methods of coercion and punishment that had been used and
had failed in the fifth century were used, and failed, again. In 357
Chios, Cos, Rhodes, and By- zantium declared a “Social War” of
rebellion. When two of Athens’</p>
<p>ablest generals, Timotheus and Iphicrates, judged it unwise to give
battle in a storm to the rebel fleet in the Hellespont, the Assembly
indicted them for cowardice. Timotheus was fined the impossible sum of
one hundred talents (00,000), and fled; Iphicrates was acquitted, but
never served Athens again. The rebels fought off all attempts to subdue
them, and in 355 Athens signed a peace acknowledging their independence.
The great city was left without allies, without leaders, without funds,
and without friends.</p>
<p>Possibly subtler factors entered into the weakening of Athens. The
life of thought endangers every civilization that it adorns. In the
earlier stages of a nation’s history there is little thought; action
flourishes; men are direct,</p>

<li>THE RISE OF SYRACUSE</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite a full measure of political turbulence, Syracuse, throughout
the fourth century, was one of the richest and most powerful cities in
Greece. Dionysius I, unscrupulous, treacherous, and vain, was the most
capable administrator of his time. By turning the island of Ortygia into
a fortress-</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>471</p>
<p>residence for himself, and walling in the causeway that bound it with
the mainland, he had rendered his position almost immune to attack; and
by doubling the pay of his soldiers, and leading them to easy victories,
he secured from them a personal loyalty that kept him on the throne for
thirty-eight years. Having established his government, he changed his
early policy of severity to one of conciliatory mildness, and a kind of
egalitarian despotism.* He gave choice tracts of land to his officers
and his friends, and (as a military measure) assigned nearly all the
residences on Ortygia and the causeway to his soldiers; all the
remaining soil of Syra- cuse and its environs he distributed equally
among the population, free and slave. Under his guidance Syracuse
flourished, though he taxed the peo- ple almost as severely as the
Assembly taxed the Athenians. When the women became too ornate Dionysius
announced that Demeter had ap- peared to him in a dream and bidden him
order all feminine jewelry to be deposited in her temple. He obeyed the
goddess, and the women for the most part obeyed him. Soon afterward he
“borrowed” the jewelry from Demeter to finance his campaigns.“</p>
<p>For at the bottom of all his plans lay the resolve to expel the
Carthaginians from Sicily. Envious of Hannibal’s resort to battering
machines in the siege of Selinus, Dionysius gathered into his service
the best mechanics and engi- neers of western Greece, and set them to
improve the tools of war. These men invented, among many new engines of
offense and defense, the katapelteSy or catapult, for throwing heavy
stones and similar projectiles; this and other military innovations
passed from Sicily to Greece, and were taken up by Philip of Macedon. A
call was sent out for mercenaries, and the armorers of Syracuse
manufactured in unheard-of quantities weapons and shields to fit the
habits and skills of each group of soldiers engaged. Land battles among
the Greeks had heretofore been fought by infantry. Dionysius organized a
large body of cavalry, and here, too, gave hints to Philip and
Alexander. At the same time he poured funds into the building of two
hundred ships, mostly quadriremes or quinqueremes; in speed and power
this was such an armada as Greece had never seen.t</p>
<p>• When he condemned the Pythagorean Phintias (less correctly Pythias)
to death for con - spiracy, Phintias asked leave to go home for a day to
settle his affairs. His friend Damon (not the music master of Pericles
and Socrates) offered himself as hostage, and volunteered to suffer
death in case Phintias should not return. Phintias returned; and
Dionysius, as sur- prised as Napoleon at any sincere friendship,
pardoned Phintias, and begged to be admitted into so steadfast a
comradeship.**</p>
<p>t A bireme was a galley with two banks or decks of oars; a trireme,
quadrireme, or quin- quereme probably had not three, four, or five banks
of oars, but so many men on each bench, handling so many oars through
one oarlock or port.</p>
<p>47 *</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(CHAP.xrS</p>
<p>By 397 all was ready, and Dionysius sent an embassy to Carthage to
demand the liberation of all Greek cities in Sicily from Carthaginian
rule. Anticipating a refusal, he invited these cities to expel their
foreign governments. They did; and still enraged by the memory of
Hannibal’s massacres, they put to death, with tortures seldom used by
Greeks, all Carthaginians who fell into their hands. Dionysius did his
best to stop the carnage, hoping to sell the captives as slaves.
Carthage ferried over a vast army under Hinulcon, and war went on at
inter- vals in 397, 392, 383, and 368. In the end Carthage recovered all
that Dionysius had won from her, and after the bloodshed matters stood
as before.</p>
<p>Whether through lust for power, or feeling that only a united Sicily
could end Carthaginian rule, Dionysius had meanwhile turned his arms
against the Greek cities in the island. Having subjugated them, he
crossed over into Italy, conquered Rhegium, and mastered aU southwest
Italy. He attacked Etruria and took a thousand talents from its temple
at Agylla; he planned to plunder the shrine of Apollo at Delphi, but
time did not permit. Greece mourned that in the same year (387) liberty
had fallen in the west, and in the east had been sold to Persia by the
King’s Peace. Three years before, Brennus and the Gauls had stood in
triumph at the gates of Rome. Everywhere the barbarians on the fringe of
the Greek world were growing stronger; and the ravages of Dionys- ius in
southern Italy paved the way for the conquest of its Greek settlements
first by the surrounding natives, and then by the half-barbarous Romans.
At the next Olympic games the orator Lysias called upon Greece to
denounce the new tyrant. The multitude attacke d the tents of Dionysius’
embassy, and refused to hear his poetry.</p>
<p>The same despot who, after capturing Rhegium, offered freedom to its
inhabitants if they would bring him nearly all their hoarded wealth as
ransom, and then, when the wealth had been surrendered, sold them as
slaves, was a man of wide culture, not prouder of his sword than of his
pen. When the poet Philoxenus, asked by the dictator for his opinion of
the royal verses, pronounced them worthless, Dionysius sentenced him to
the quarries. The next day the King repented, had Philoxenus released,
and gave a banquet in his honor. But when Dionysius read more of his
poetry, and asked Philoxenus to judge it, Philoxenus bade the attendants
take him back to the quarries.“ Despite such discouragements Dionysius
patronized literature and the arts, and was pleased for a moment to
enter- tain Plato, who was then (387) traveling in Sicily. According to
a wide- spread tradition reported by Diogenes Laertius, the philosopher
con- demned dictator ship. “Your words,” said Dionysius, “are those of
an old dotard.” “Your language,” said Plato, “is that of a tyrant.”
Dionysius, we</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP, xrx)</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>are told, sold him into slavery, but the philosopher was soon
ransomed by Anniceris of Gyrene.“</p>
<p>The dictator’s life was ended not by any of the assassins whom he
feared, but by his own poetry. In 367 his tragedy. The Ransom of Hector,
re- ceived first prize at the Athenian Lenaea. Dionysius was so pleased
that he feasted with his friends, drank much wine, fell into a fever,
and died.</p>
<p>The harassed city, which had borne with him as an alternative to sub-
jection by Carthage, accepted hopefully the succession of his son to the
throne. Dionysius II was now a youth of twenty-five, weak in body and
mind, and therefore, thought the crafty Syracusans, likely to give them
a mild and negligent rule. He had able advisers in Dion his uncle, and
Philistius the historian. Dion was a man of wealth, but also a lover of
letters and philosophy, and a devoted disciple of Plato. He became a
member of the Academy, and lived, at home and abroad, a life of
philosophical simplicity. It occurred to him that the malleable youth of
the new dictator offered an opportunity of establishing, if not quite
the Utopia that Plato had described to him,“ at least a constitutional
regime capable of uniting all Sicily for the expulsion of the
Carthaginian power. At Dion’s suggestion Dionysius II invited Plato to
his court, and submitted himself to Plato’s tutoring .</p>
<p>Doubtless the young autocrat put his best foot forward, and concealed
from his teacher that addiction to drink and lechery“ which had drawn
from his father the prediction that the dynasty would die with his son.
Deceived by the youth’s apparent will ingness, Plato led him towards
philosophy by its most difficult approaches — mathematics and virtue.
The ruler was told, as Confucius had told the Duke of Lu, that the first
princi- ple of government is good example, that to improve his people he
must make himself a model of intelligence and good will. All the court
began to study geometry, and to stand in diplomatic awe over figures
traced in the sand. But Philistius, eclipsed by Plato’s ascendancy,
whispered to the dictator that all this was merely a plot by which the
Athenians, who had failed to conquer Syracuse with an army and a fleet,
would capture it through a single man; and that Plato, having taken the
impregnable citadel with diagrams and dialogues, would depose Dionysius
and put Dion on the throne. Dionysius saw in these whispers an excellent
escape from geometry. He banished Dion, confiscated his property, and
gave Dion’s wife to a courtier whom she feared. Despite the dictator’s
protestations of affection, Plato left Syracuse and joined Dion in
Athens. Six years later</p>
<p>474 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.XK</p>
<p>he returned at the King’s invitation, and pled for Dion’s recall.
Dionysius refused, and Plato resigned himself to the Academy.“</p>
<p>In 357 Dion, poor in funds but rich in friends, recruited in
mainland</p>
<p>Greece a force of eight hundred men, and sailed for Syracuse. Landing
secretly, he found the people eager to aid him. With one battle — in
which, though he was now fifty, his own heroic fighting turned the tide
— he so completely defeated the army of Dionysius that the frightened
youth fled to Italy. At this juncture, with Greek impulsiveness, the
Syracusan As- sembly that he had convened removed Dion from command,
lest he should make himself dictator. Dion withdrew peaceably to
Leontini; but the forces of Dionysius, lilting this turn of events, made
a sudden attack upon the popular army, and defeated it. The leaders who
had deposed him sent appeals to Dion to hurry back and talce charge. He
came, won another victory, forgave the men who had opposed him, and then
announced a temporary dictatorship as necessary to order. Despite the
advice of his friends he refused a personal guard, being “quite ready to
die,” he said, “rather than live perpetually on the watch against
friends and foes alike.”“ Instead he maintained, amid surroundings of
wealth and power, his accus- tomed modesty of life. For though, says
Plutarch,</p>
<p>all things had now succeeded to his wish, yet he desired not to enjoy
any present advantage of his good fortune. … He was content</p>
<p>with a very frugal and moderate competency, and was indeed the</p>
<p>wonder of all men, that when not only Sicily and Carthage but all</p>
<p>Greece looked to him as in the height of prosperity, and no man</p>
<p>living greater than he, no general more renowned for valor and</p>
<p>success, yet in his guard, his attendance, his table, he seemed as
if</p>
<p>he rather communed with Plato in the Academy than lived among</p>
<p>hired captains and paid soldiers, whose solace of their toils and
dan- gers it is to eat and drink their fill, and enjoy themselves
plentifully</p>
<p>every day.“</p>
<p>If we may credit Plato, it was Dion’s aim to establish a
constitutional monarchy, to reform Syracusan life and manners on the
Spartan model, to rebuild and unify the enslaved or desolate Greek
cities of Sicily, and then to expel the Carthaginians from the island.
But the Syracusans had set their hearts on democracy, and were no more
hungry for virtue than either Dionysius. A friend of Dion murdered him,
and chaos broke loose. Dionysius hurried home, recaptured Ortygia and
the government, and ruled with the bitter cruelty of a despot deposed
and restored.</p>
<p>Undeserved fates come sometimes to individuals, but rarely to
nations.</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>The Syracusans appealed for aid to their mother city, Corinth. The
call came at a time when a Corinthian of almost legendary nobleness was
wait- ing for a summons to heroism. Timoleon was an aristocrat who so
loved liberty that when his brother Timophanes tried to make himself
tyrant of Corinth, Timoleon killed him. Cursed by his mother and
brooding</p>
<p>over his deed, the tyrannicide withdrew to a woodland retreat,
shunning all men. Hearing nevertheless of Syracuse’s need, he came out
of his re - tirement, organized a small force of volunteers, sailed to
Sicily, and de- ployed his little band with such strategy that the royal
army yielded after a brief taste of his generalship, and without killing
any one of his men. Timoleon gave the humbled tyrant money enough to
take himself to Corinth, where Dionysius spent the remainder of his life
teaching school and sometimes begging his bread.” Timoleon re
-established democracy, tore down the fortifications that had made
Ortygia a buttress of tyranny, repulsed a Carthaginian invasion,
restored freedom and democracy in the Greek cities, and made Sicily for
a generation so peaceful and prosper- ous that new settlers were drawn
to it from every part of the Hellenic world. Then, refusing public
office, he retired to private life; but the island democracies,
appreciating his wisdom and integrity, submitted all major matters to
his judgment, and freely followed his advice. Two</p>
<p>“sycophants” having indicted him on a charge of malfeasance, he
insisted, over the protests of a grateful people, on being tried without
favor accord- ing to the laws, and thanked the gods that freedom of
speech and equality before the law had been restored in Sicily. When he
died (337) all Greece looked upon him as one of the greatest of her
sons.</p>
<p>V. THE ADVANCE OF MACEDONIA</p>
<p>While Timoleon was restoring democracy for its last respite in
ancient Sicily, Philip was destroying it on the mainland. Macedonia,
despite the cultural hospitality of Archelaus, was still for the most
part a barbarous country of hardy but letterless mountaineers when
Philip came to the</p>
<p>throne (359); indeed, to the end of its career, though it used Greek
as its official language, it contributed no author, or artist, or
scientist, or philoso- pher, to the life of Greece.</p>
<p>Having lived for three years with the relatives of Epaminondas in</p>
<p>Thebes, Philip had imbibed there a modicum of culture and a wealth of
military ideas. He had all the virtues except those of civilization. He
was</p>
<p>47&lt;5 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.XI</p>
<p>XStrong in body and will, athletic and handsome, a magnificent animal
try- ing, now and then, to be an Athenian gentleman. Like his famous son
he was a man of violent temper and abounding generosity, loving battle
as much, and strong drink more. Unlike Alexander he was a Jovial
laugher, and raised to high office a slave who amused him. He liked
boys, but liked women better, and married as many of them as he could.
For a time he tried monogamy with Olympias, the wild and beautiful
Molossian prin- cess who gave him Alexander; but later his fancy
traveled, and Olympias brooded over her revenge. Most of all he liked
stalwart men, who could risk their lives all day and gamble and carouse
with him half the night. He was literally (before Alexander) the bravest
of the brave, and left a part of himself on every battlefield. “What a
man!” exclaimed his great - est enemy, Demosthenes. “For the sake of
power and dominion he had an eye struck out, a shoulder broken, an arm
and a leg paralyzed.”” He had a subtle intelligence, capable of
patiently awaiting his chance, and of mov- ing resolutely through
difficult means to distant ends. In diplomacy he was affable and
treacherous; he broke a promise with a light heart, and was always ready
to make another; he recognized no morals for governments, and looked
upon lies and bribes as humane substitutes for slaughter. But he was
lenient in victory, and usually gave the defeated Greeks better terms
than they gave one another. All who met him — except the obstinate
Demosthenes — liked him, and ranked him as the strongest and most inter-
esting character of his time.</p>
<p>His government was an aristocratic monarchy in which the king’s pow -
ers were limited by the duration of his superior strength of arm or
mind, and by the willingness of the nobles to support him. Eight hundred
feudal barons made up the “King’s Companions”; they were great
landowners who despised the life of cities, crowds, and books; but when,
with their consent, the King announced a war, they came out of their
estates physi- cally fit and drunkenly brave. In the army they sejyed as
cavalry, riding the sturdy horses of Macedonia and Thrace, and trained
by Philip to fight in a close formation that could change its tactics at
once and as one at the commander’s word. Beside these was an infantry of
rugged hunters and peasants, arrayed in “phalanxes”: sixteen rows of men
pointing their lances over the heads — or resting them on the shoulders
— of the rows ahead of them, making each phalanx an iron wall. The
lance, twenty-one feet long, was weighted at the rear, so that when held
aloft it projected fifteen feet forward. As each row of soldiers marched
three feet before the next, the lances of the first five rows projected
beyond the phalanx, and the lances</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>477</p>
<p>of the first three rows had a greater reach than the six-foot javelin
of the nearest Greek hoplite. The Macedonian soldier, after hurling his
lance, fought with a short sword, and protected himself with a brass
helmet, a coat of mail, greaves, and a lightweight shield. Behind the
phalanx came a regiment of old-fashioned archers, who shot their arrows
over the heads of the lancers; then came a siege train with catapults
and battering rams. Resolutely and patiently — playin g Frederick
William I to Alexander’s Fred - erick — Philip di^ed this army of ten
thousand men into the most power- ful fighting instrument that Europe
had yet known.</p>
<p>With this force he was determined to unify Greece under his
leadership; then, with the help of all Hellas, he proposed to cross the
Hellespont and drive the Persians out of Greek Asia. At every step
toward this end he found himself running counter to the Hellenic love of
freedom; and in trying to overcome this resistance he almost forgot the
end in the means. His first move brought him into conflict with Athens,
for he sought to win possession of the cities that Athens had acquired
on the Macedonian and Thracian coasts; these cities not only blocked his
way to Asia, they also controlled rich gold mines and a taxable trade.
While Athens was ab- sorbed in the “Social War” that ended her second
empire, Philip seized Amphipolis (357), Pydna, and Potidaea (356), and
answered the protests of Athens with fine compliments to Athenian
literature and art. In 355 he took Methone, losing an eye in the siege;
in 347, after a long campaign of chicanery and bravery, he captured
Olynthus. He now controlled all the European coast of the north Aegean,
had an income of a thousand talents a year fro m the mines of Thrace,”
and could turn his thoughts to winning the support of Greece.</p>
<p>To finance his campaigns he had sold thousands of captives — many of
them Athenians — into slavery, and had lost the good will of Hellenes.
It was fortunate for him that during these years the Greek states were
exhaust- ing themselves in a second “Sacred War” (356 -46) over the
spoliation of the Delphic treasury by the Phocians. The Spartans and
Athenians fought for the Phocians, the Amphictyonic League — Boeotia,
Locris, Doris, Thes- saly-fought against them. Losing, the Amphictyonic
Council besought the help of Philip. He saw his opportunity, came
swiftly down through the open passes, overwhelmed the Phocians (346),
was received into the Delphic Amphictyony, was acclaimed as the
protector of the shrine, and accepted an invitation to preside over all
the Greeks at the Pythian games. He cast his eyes upon the divided
states of die Peloponnesus, and felt that he could win all of them
except weakened Sparta to accept him as leader</p>

<p>Xin a Greek Confederacy that might free all Greeks in the east and
the west. But Athens, listening at last to Demosthenes, saw in Philip
not a liberator but an enslaver, and decided to fight for the jealous
sovereignty of the city-state, and the preservation of that free
democracy which had made her the light of the world.</p>

<p>The Vatican statue of the great orator is one of the masterpieces
of</p>
<p>Hellenistic realism. It is a careworn face, as if every advance of
Philip had cut another furrow into the brow. The body is thin and
wearied; the aspect is that of a man who is about to make a final appeal
for a cause that he considers lost; the eyes reveal a restless life, and
foresee a bitter death.</p>
<p>His father was a manufacturer of swords and bedframes, who bequeathed
to him a business worth some fourteen talents (4,000). Three execu- tors
administered the property for the boy, and squandered it so generously
on themselves that when Demosthenes reached the age of twenty (363) he
had to sue his guardians to recover the remains of his inheritance. He
spent most of this in fitting out a trireme for the Athenian navy, and
then settled down to earn his bread by writing speeches for litigants.
He could compose better than he could speak, for he was weak in body and
defective in articulation. Sometimes, says Plutarch, he prepared pleas
for both the opposed parties to a dispute. Meanwhile, to overcome his
impediments, he addressed the sea with a mouth full of pebbles, or
declaimed as he ran up a hill. He worked hard, and his only distractions
were courtesans and boys. “What can one do with Demosthenes?” his
secretary complained. “Everything that he has thought of for a whole
year is thrown into con- fusion by one woman in one night.”“ After years
of effort he became one of the richest lawyers at the Athenian bar,
learned in technicalities, convincing in discourse, and flexible in
morals. He defended the banker Phormio against precisely such charges as
he had brought against his guardians, took substantial fees from private
persons for introducing and pressing legislation, and never answered the
accusation of his colleague Hypereides that he was receiving money from
the Persian King to stir up war against Philip.“ At his zenith his
fortune was ten times as large as that which his father had left

<p>was paid to defend. He denounced the dependence of Athens upon mer-
cenary troops, and insisted that the citizens who received money from
the theoric fund should earn it by seiwing in the army; his courage rose
to the point of demanding that this fund should be used not to pay
citizens to attend religious ceremonies and plays, but to organize a
better force for the defense of the state.* He told the Athenians that
they were degenerate slackers who had lost the military virtues of their
progenitors. He refused to admit that the city-state had stultified
itself with faction and war, and that the times called for the unity of
Greece; this unity, he warned, was a phrase to conceal the subjugation
of Greece to one man. He detected the ambitions of Philip from their
first symptoms, and begged the Athenians to fight to retain their allies
and colonies in the north.</p>
<p>Against Demosthenes and Hypereides and the party of war stood</p>
<p>Aeschines and Phocion and the party of peace. Very likely both sides
were bribed, the one by Persia, the other by Philip,“ and both were
sincerely moved by their own agitation. Phocion was by common consent
the most honest statesman of his time — a Stoic before Zeno, a
philosophical product of Plato’s Academy, an orator who so despised th e
Assembly that when it applauded him he asked a friend, “Have I not
unconsciously said some - thing bad?”“ Forty -five times he was chosen
strategos, far surpassing the record of Pericles; he served ably as a
general in many wars, but spent most of his life in advocating peace.
His associate Aeschines was no stoic, but a man who had risen from
bitter poverty to a comfortable income. His youth as a teacher and an
actor helped him to become a fluent speaker, the first Greek orator, we
are told, to speak extempore with success;“ his rivals wrote out their
speeches in advance. Having served with Phocion in several engagements,
he adopted Phocion’s policy of compromising with Philip instead of
making war; and when Philip paid him for his efforts his enthusiasm for
peace became an edifying devotion.</p>
<p>Twice Demosthenes indicted Aeschines on the charge of receiving</p>
<p>Macedonian gold, and twice failed to convict him. Finally, however,
the martial eloquence of Demosthenes, and the southward advance of
Philip, persuaded the Athenians to forego for a time the distribution of
the theoric fund, and to employ it in war. In 338 an army was hastily
organized, and marched north to face the phalanxes of Philip at Boeotian
Chaeronea. Sparta</p>
<p>• The theoric (i.e., s pectacle) fund had now been extended to so
many festivals as almost to pauperize a large part of the citizenry.
“The Athenian Republic,” says Glotz, “had be - come a mutual benefit
society, demanding from one class the wherewithal to support another.”“
T he Assembly had made it a capital crime to propose any diversion of
this rund to other purposes.</p>
<p>480 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.XI</p>
<p>Xrefused to help, but Thebes, feeling Philip’s fingers at her throat,
sent her Sacred Band to fight beside the Athenians. Every one of its
three hundred members died on that battlefield. The Athenians fought
almost as bravely, but they had waited too long, and were not equipped
to meet so novel an army as the Macedonian. They broke and fled before
the sea of lances that moved upon them, and Demosthenes fled with them.
Alexander, Phil- ip’s eighteen -year-old son, led the Macedonian cavalry
with reckless cour- age, and won the honors of a bitter day.</p>
<p>Philip was diplomatically generous in victory. He put to death some
of the anti-Macedonian leaders in Thebes, and set up his partisans there
in oligarchic power. But he freed the two thousand Athenian prisoners
that he had taken, and sent the charming Alexander and the judicious
Antipater to offer peace on condition that Athens recognize him as the
general of all Greece against the common foe. Athens, which had expected
harsher terms, not only consented, but passed resolutions showering
compliments upon the new Agamemnon. Philip convened at Corinth a
synedrion, or assem- bly, of the Greek states, formed them (except
Sparta) into a federation modeled on the Boeotian, and outlined his
plans for the liberation of Asia. He was unanimously chosen commander in
this enterprise; each state pledged him men and arms, and promised that
no Greek anywhere should fight against him. Such sacrifices were a small
price to pay for his distance.</p>
<p>The results of Chaeronea were endless. The unity that Greece had
failed to create for itself had been achieved, but only at the point of
a half-alien sword. The Peloponnesian War had proved Athens incapable of
organiz- ing Hellas, the aftermath had shown Sparta incapable, the
Theban hegem- ony in its turn had failed; the wars of the armies and the
classes had worn out the city-states, and left them too weak for
defense. Under the circum- stances they were fortunate to find so
reasonable a conqueror, who pro- posed to withdraw from the scene of his
victory, and leave to the con- quered a large measme of freedom. Indeed
Philip, and Alexander after him, watchfully protected the autonomy of
the federated states, lest any one of them, by absorbmg others, should
grow strong enough to displace Mace- don. One great liberty, however,
Philip took away — the right of revolu- tion. He was a frank
conservative who considered the stability of property an indispensable
stimulus to enterprise, and a necessary prop to government. He persuaded
the synod at Corinth to insert into the articles of federation a pledge
against any change of constitution, any social transformation, any
political reprisals. In each state he lent his influence to the side of
property, and put an end to confiscatory taxation.</p>

<p>He had laid his plans well, except for Olympias; in the end his fate
was determined not by his victories in the field but by his failure with
his wife. She frightened him not only by her temper but by participating
in the wildest Dionysian rites. One night he found a snake lying beside
her in bed, and was not reassured by being told that it was a god.
Worse, Olym- pias informed him that he was not the real father of
Alexander; that on the night of their wedding a thunderbolt had fallen
upon her and set her afire; it was the great god Zeus-Ammon who had
begotten the dashing prince. Discouraged by such varied competition,
Philip turned his amours to other women; and Olympias began her revenge
by telling Alexander the secret of his divine paternity.“ One of
Philip’s generals. Attains, made matters worse by prop osing a toast to
Philip’s expected child by a second wife, as promising a “legitimate”
(i.e., completely Macedonian) heir to the throne. Alexander flung a
goblet at his head, crying, “Am I, then, a bas - tard?” Philip drew his
sword against his son, but was so drunk that he could not stand.
Alexander laughed at him: “Here,” he said, “is a man preparing to cross
from Europe into Asia, who cannot step surely from one couch to
another.” A few months later one of Philip’s officers, Pau - sanias,
having asked redress from Philip for an insult from Attalus, and
receiving no satisfaction, assassinated the King (336). Alexander,
idolized by the army and supported by Olympias,* seized the throne,
overcame all opposition, and prepared to conquer the world.</p>
