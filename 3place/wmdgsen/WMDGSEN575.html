<h4 id="chapter-v">CHAPTER V</h4>
<p>Mary Queen of Scots</p>
<p>1542-87</p>
<p>I. THE FAIRY QUEEN</p>
<p>W ITHIN the interlocking dramas of the Scottish Reformation and</p>
<p>Elizabethan politics the tragedy of Mary Stuart moved with all
the</p>
<p>fascination of beauty, passionate love, religious and political
conflict, mur- der, revolution, and heroic death. Her ancestry almost
assured a violent end. She was the daughter of the Stuart James V of
Scotland and of</p>
<p>Mary of Guise, Lorraine, and France; she was the granddaughter of</p>
<p>Margaret Tudor, who was the daughter of Henry VII of England; she was
therefore niece, loosely called cousin, of “Bloody Mary” and Elizabeth;
by common consent she was the legitimate heir to the English crown if
Elizabeth should die without issue; and for those who — like all
Catholics (and, at one time, Henry VIII) — considered Elizabeth a
bastard and there- fore ineligible to rule, Mary Stuart, and not
Elizabeth Tudor, should have succeeded to the throne of England in 1558.
To make tragedy certain, Mary, on becoming Queen of France (1559),
allowed her followers and her state papers to call her Queen of England.
It had long been a vain pretense of French kings to be also kings of
England, and of English kings to be also kings of France; but in this
case the pretense came close to a generally acknowledged claim.
Elizabeth could not be sure of her crown as long as Mary lived. Only
common sense could have saved the situation, and sovereigns rarely stoop
so low.</p>
<p>Mary was offered kingdoms within a year of her birth. Within a week
of her birth her father’s death made her Queen of Scots. Henry VIII,</p>
<p>hoping to unite Scotland as an appanage to England, proposed that the
infant be betrothed to his son Edward, be sent to England, and be</p>
<p>there brought up, presumably as a Protestant, to be Edward’s Queen.
Her Catholic mother accepted, instead, the offer of Henry II of France
(1548) to give her in marriage to his son the Dauphin. To guard her
against being kidnaped into England, Mary, aged six, was hurried off to
France. She remained there thirteen years, was educated with the royal
children, and became completely French in spirit, being already half
French in blood. As she matured into youth she developed all the charms
of young woman- hood in beauty of features and form, sprightliness of
mind, and merry grace</p>
<p>1 10</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>of ways and speech. She sang sweetly, played the lute well, talked
Latin, and wrote poetry that poets affected to praise. Courtiers
throbbed to “the snow of her pure face” (Brantome),^ “the gold of her
curled and plaited hair” (Ronsard),* the slender elegance of her hands,
the fullness of her bust; and even the grave and sober L’Hopital thought
that such loveliness must be the vesture of a god.® She became the most
attractive and accomplished figure at the most polished court in Europe.
When, aged sixteen, she married the Dauphin (April 24, 1558), and still
more when, aged seventeen, she became through his accession Queen of
France, all the hopes of a fanciful dream seemed to have come true.</p>
<p>But Francis II died (December 5, 1 560) after two years of rule.
Mary, a widow at eighteen, thought of retiring to an estate in Touraine,
for she loved France. But meanwhile Scotland had gone Protestant; it was
in danger of being lost to France as an ally. The French government held
it to be Mary’s duty to go to Edinburgh and lead her native land
back</p>
<p>to the French alliance and the Catholic faith. Unwillingly, Mary
reconciled herself to leaving the comforts and brilliance of French
civilization for life in a Scotland which she could barely remember, and
which she</p>
<p>pictured as a land of barbarism and cold. She wrote to the leading
Scot- tish nobles, affirming her fidelity to Scotland; she did not tell
them that in her marriage contract she had deeded Scotland to the kings
of France if she died without issue. The nobles, Protestant as well as
Catholic, were charmed; the Scottish Parliament invited her to come and
possess her throne. She asked Elizabeth for a safe-conduct through
England; it was refused. On August 14, 1561, Mary sailed from Calais,
bidding France a tearful farewell, and gazing at the receding coast till
nothing remained but the sea.</p>
<p>Five days later she disembarked at Leith, the port of Edinburgh, and
dis- covered Scotland.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SCOTLAND, 1560-61</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a nation of ancient roots and rooted ways: bound by the rough
highlands of the north to a feudal regime of almost independent nobles
organizing and exploiting a half-primitive culture of hunting, herding,
and tenant tillage; favored in the south by lovely lowlands fertile with
rain but darkened by long winters and crippling cold; a people
struggling to create a moral and civilized order out of illiteracy,
illegitimacy, cor- ruption, lawlessness, and violence; riddled with
superstition, and sending witches to the stake; seeking in a tense
religious faith some hope of a less arduous life. To offset the divisive
power of the barons, the kings had</p>
<p>1 12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>supported the Catholic clergy, and had dowered these with wealth
lead- ing to venality, lethargy, and concubines.^ The nobles itched for
the riches of the Church; they debased the clergy by filling
ecclesiastical of- fices with their worldly sons; they declared for the
Reformation and made the Scottish Parliament, which they controlled, the
master alike of Church and state.</p>
<p>External danger was the strongest incentive to internal unity.
England felt unsafe in an island shared with her by untamed Scots; time
and again she sought, by diplomacy, marriage, or war, to bring Scotland
under English rule. Fearful of absorption, Scotland allied herself with
a France traditionally hostile to England. Cecil advised Elizabeth to
support the Protestant nobles against their Catholic Queen; so Scotland
would be divided and would cease to be a peril to England or a support
to France. Moreover, the Protestant leaders, if successful, might reject
Mary, en- throne a Protestant noble, and make all Scotland Protestant;
privately Cecil dreamed of uniting such a Scotland to England by
persuading Eliza- beth to marry such a king.® When France sent a force
into Scotland to suppress the Protestants, Elizabeth dispatched an army
to protect them and drive out the French. Beaten in the field, the
French representatives in Scotland signed at Edinburgh (July 6, 1560) a
fateful treaty requiring not only that the French should leave Scotland
but that Mary should cease to claim the throne of England. On the advice
of her husband, Francis II, Mary refused to ratify the treaty. Elizabeth
took note.</p>
<p>The religious situation was equally confused. The Scottish “Refor ma-
tion Parliament” of 1560 officially abolished Catholicism, and
established Calvinist Protestantism, as the religion of the state; but
these acts did not receive from Mary the royal ratification then
required to make parlia- mentary decrees the law of the land. Catholic
priests still held most of the Scottish benefices; half the nobles were
“papists,” and John Hamilton, of royal blood, still came to Parliament
as the Catholic primate of Scot- land. In Edinburgh, however, and in
St. Andrews, Perth, Stirling, and Aberdeen, a large proportion of the
middle classes had been won to Calvin- ism by devoted preachers under
the lead of John Knox.</p>
<p>In the year before Mary’s coming Knox and his aides drew up a Book of
Discipline defining their doctrine and purposes. Religion was to mean
Protestantism; “the godly” were to mean Calvinists alone; “idolatry” was
to include “the Mass, invocation of saints, adoration of images, and the
keeping … of the same,” and “the obstinate maint ainers and teachers of
such abominations ought not to escape the punishment of the civil
magistrate.” All doctrine “repugnant to” the Gospel was to “be utterly
suppressed as damnable to man’s salvation.”® Ministers were to be
elected</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>“3</p>
<p>and were to have control of the Scottish universities — St. Andrews,
Glas- gow, and Aberdeen. The wealth of the Catholic Church and the
continued ecclesiastical tithes were to be devoted to the needs of the
ministers, the education of the people, and the relief of the poor. The
new Kirk, and not the secular state, was to legislate on morals and
prescribe penalties for offenses — drunkenness, gluttony, profanity,
extravagance of dress, op- pression of the poor, obscenity, fornication,
and adultery. All who resisted the new doctrine or persistently absented
themselves from its services were to be turned over to the secular arm,
with the Kirk’s re commendation that they be put to death.’’</p>
<p>However, the lords who dominated Parliament refused to accept the
Book of Discipline (January 1561). They had no relish for a powerful and
independent Kirk, and they had their own plans for using the wealth of
the superseded Church. The Book remained the goal and guide of the
Kirk’s development.</p>
<p>Defeated in his attempt to establish a theocracy — a government by
priests claiming to speak for God — Knox labored with massive tenacity
to organize the new ministry, to find funds for its support, and to
spread it throughout Scotland in the face of a still functioning
Catholic clergy. The dogmatic force of his preaching and the enthusiasm
of his congrega- tion made him a power in Edinburgh and in the state.
The Catholic Queen would have to reckon with him before she could
consolidate her rule. HI. MARY AND KNOX: I561-65</p>
<p>She had arranged to arrive in Scotland a fortnight before she was ex-
pected, for she had feared some opposition to her landing. But word of
her arrival at Leith spread through the capital, and soon the streets
were crowded with people. They were surprised to find that their Queen
was a pretty and vivacious girl not yet nineteen years old; most of them
cheered her as she rode gracefully on her palfrey to Holyrood Palace;
and there the lords, Protestant and Catholic, welcomed her, proud that
Scotland had so charming a ruler, who might someday, in person or
through a son, bring England under a Scottish sovereign.</p>
<p>The two portraits® that have come down to us support her reputation
as one of the most beautiful women of her time. We cannot tell how far
the now nameless painters idealized her, but in both cases we see the
finely molded features, the lovely hands, the luxuriant chestnut hair
that entranced barons and biographers. Yet those pictures hardly reveal
to us the real attractiveness of the young Queen — her buoyant spirit,
her “laugh - ing mouth,” her nimble -witted speech, her fresh
enthusiasm, her capacity</p>
<p>II4 the age of reason begins (chap. V</p>
<p>for kindness and friendliness, her longing for affection, her
reckless ad- miration of strong men. It was her tragedy that she wished
to be a woman as well as a queen — to feel all the warmth of romance
without abating the</p>
<p>She tried hard to meet the manifold dangers of her situation, poised
between grasping lords, hostile preachers and a decadent Catholic clergy
that did no honor to her trusting faith. She chose as leaders of her
Privy Council two Protestants: her bastard half-brother Lord James
Stuart, later Earl of Murray (or Moray), aged twenty-six, and William
Maitland of Lethington, thirty-six, who had more intellect than his
character could handle, and who shifted from side to side in compromises
till his death. The goal of Lethington’s diplomacy was admirable — the
union of England and Scotland as the only alternative to a consuming
hostility. In May of 1562 Mary sent him to England to arrange an
interview between herself and Elizabeth; Elizabeth consented, but her
Council demurred, fearing that even the most indirect admission of
Mary’s claim to the succession would encourage Catholic attempts to
assassinate Elizabeth. The two queens corresponded with diplomatic
affection, while each sought to play cat to the other’s mouse.</p>
<p>Mary’s first three years of rule were a success in everything but
religion. Though she could never reconcile herself to the climate or the
culture of Scotland, she sought, with dances, masques, and charm, to
make Holy- rood Palace a little Paris in a subarctic zone, and most of
the lords thawed under the sun of her gaiety; Knox growled that they
were bewitched. She allowed Murray and Lethington to administer the
kingdom, which they did reasonably well. For a time even the religious
problem seemed to be solved by her concessions. When papal agents urged
her to restore</p>
<p>Catholicism as the oflScial religion of the land she replied that
this was at present impossible; Elizabeth would forcibly intervene. To
appease the Scottish Protestants she issued (August 26, 1561) a
proclamation forbid-</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>”5</p>
<p>ding the Catholics to attempt changes in the established religion,
but she asked to be allowed to practice her own worship privately and to
have Mass said for her in the royal chapel.^® On Sunday, August 24, Mass
was there celebrated. A few Protestants gathered outside and demanded
that “the idolatrous priest should die’V^ but Murray barred their entry
into the chapel, while his aides led the priest to safety. On the
following Sun- day Knox denounced the lords for permitting the Mass, and
told his congregation that to him one Mass was more offense than ten
thousand armed foes.^^</p>
<p>The Queen sent for him and strove to win his tolerance. On September
4, in her palace, the two faiths met in a historic interview, whose
details are known to us only fr om Knox’s report.^® She reproached him
for having stirred up rebellion against the duly constituted authority
of her mother, and for having written his “blast” against “the monstrous
regiment of women” — which had denounced all female sovereigns. He
answered that “if to rebuke idolatry be to raise subjects against their
princes, then cannot I be excused, for it has pleased God … to make me
one (amongst many) to disclose unto this realm the vanity of the
papistical religions, and the deceit, pride, and tyranny of that Roman
Antichrist,” the Pope. As for the blast, “Madam, that book was written
most especially against that wicked Jezebel of England,” Mary Tudor.
Knox’s report continues:</p>
<p>“Think ye (quod she) that subjects may resist their princes?”</p>
<p>“If (he 〔Knox〕 replied) their princes exceed their bounds … it is
no</p>
<p>doubt they may be resisted, even by power.”</p>
<p>. . . The Queen stood as it were amazed … At length she said:</p>
<p>“Well, then, I perceive that my subjects shall obey you, and not</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>“God forbid (answered he) that ever I take upon me to command</p>
<p>any to obey me, or yet to let subjects at liberty to do what
pleaseth</p>
<p>them. But my travail is that both princes and subjects obey God . .
.</p>
<p>And this subjection, Madam, unto God and unto His troubled Church, is
the greatest dignity that flesh can get upon this earth.”</p>
<p>“Yea (quod she), but ye are not the Kirk that I will nourish. I
will</p>
<p>defend the Kirk of Rome, for I think it is the true Kir k of
God.”</p>
<p>“Your will (quod he). Madam, is no reason; neither doth your</p>
<p>thought make that Roman harlot to be the true and immaculate spouse
of Jesus Christ. And wonder not. Madam, that I call Rome a harlot,</p>
<p>for that Church is altogether polluted with all kind of spiritual
fornica- tion . . .”</p>
<p>“My conscience (said she) is not so.”</p>
<p>If this conversation is faithfully reported, it was a dramatic
confronta- tion of monarchy with theocratic democracy, of Catholicism
with Cal- vinism. If we may believe Knox, the Queen took his reproofs
without</p>
<p>Il6 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. V</p>
<p>retaliation, merely saying, “Ye are oure sain 〔overmuch sore〕 for
me”; she went off to dinner, and Knox to his ministry. Lethington wished
“Mr. Knox would deal more gently with her, being a young princess unper-
suaded.”^*</p>
<p>His followers did not feel that he had been too hard with her. When
she appeared in public some called her idolater, and children informed
her that hearing Mass was a sin. The Edinburgh magistrates issued a de-
cree of banishment for “monks, friars, priests, nuns, adulterers, and
all sic filthy persons.”^® Mary deposed the magistrates and ordered new
elec - tions. At Stirling the priests who tried to minister to her were
driven off with bloody heads, “while she wept helplessly.”^® The General
Assembly of the Kirk demanded that she should be forbidden to hear Mass
anywhere, but the lords of the Council refused to comply. In December
1561 a hot dispute arose between the Council and the Kirk over the
distribution of ecclesiastical revenues: the Protestant ministers were
allotted a sixth, the Queen a sixth, the Catholic clergy (still in the
great majority) two thirds. Knox summarized the matter by saying that
two parts were given to the Devil and the third was divided between the
Devil and God.^^ The</p>
<p>ministers received, on an average, one hundred marks (,333?) per
year.^®</p>
<p>Throughout the ensuing year the clergy of the Kirk continued to de-
nounce the Queen. They were scandalized by the masques and revels, the
singing, dancing, and flirting, that went on at Mary’s court. She
diminished her amusements in deference to the protests, but the
ministers felt that she had yet far to go, for she still heard Mass.
“John Knox,” wrote a con - temporary, “thundereth out of the pulpit, so
that I fear nothing so much as that one day he will mar all. He ruleth
the roost, and of him all men stand in fear.”^® Here again the
Reformation came to grips with the</p>
<p>Renaissance.</p>
<p>On December 15, 1562, Mary summoned Knox. Before Murray, Leth-
ington, and others she accused him of teaching his followers to hate
her. He answered, he says, that “princes . . . are more exercised in
fiddling and flinging than in reading or hearing of God’s most blessed
word; and</p>
<p>fiddlers and flatterers . . . are more precious in their eyes than
men of wisdom and gravity, who, by wholesome admonition, might beat down
in them some part of that vanity and pride whereunto all are born, but
in princes t ake deep root and strength by wicked education.” According
to Knox, the Queen replied (with unwonted meekness), “If ye hear any -
thing of myself that mislikes you, come to myself and tell me, and I
shall hear you”; and he answered, “I am called. Madam, to a public
function within the Kirk of God, and was appointed by God to rebuke the
sins and vices of all. I am not appointed to come to every man in
particular</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>II7</p>
<p>to show him his offense, for that labor were infinite. If your Grace
please to frequent the public sermons, then doubt I not but that ye
shall fully understand both what I like and mislike.”*®</p>
<p>She let him go in peace, but the war of faiths went on. At Easter
of</p>
<p>1563 several Catholic priests who had violated the law by saying Mass
were seized by local agents and were threatened with death for
idolatry.®^ Some were jailed, some escaped and hid in the woods. Mary
sent for Knox once more and interceded for the imprisoned priests; he
replied that if she would enforce the law he would guarantee Protestant
docility; other- wise he thought the papists deserved a lesson. “I
promise to do as you require,” she said, and for a moment they were
friends. At her order the Archbishop of St. Andrews and forty-seven
other priests were tried for saying Mass and were sentenced to prison.
The ministers rejoiced, but a week later (May 26, 1563), when Mary and
her ladies attended Parlia- ment in their best raiment and some of t he
people cried “God bless that sweet face!” the ministers denounced “the
targetting 〔tasseling〕 of their tails,” and Knox wrote, “Such stinking
pride of women . . . was never seen before in Scotland.”®^</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter he heard that Lethington was trying to arrange
a</p>
<p>marriage between Mary and Don Carlos, son of Philip II. Feeling that
such a marriage would be fatal to Scottish Protestantism, Knox spoke his
mind on the subject in a sermon preached to the nobles attending Parlia-
ment:</p>
<p>And now , my Lords, to put an end to all, I hear of the Queen’s</p>
<p>marriage . . . This, my Lords, will I say: Whensoever the nobility
of</p>
<p>Scotland professing to Lord Jesus consents that an infidel (and
all</p>
<p>papists are infidels) shall be head to your sovereign, ye do so far
as in ye lieth to banish Christ Jesus from this realm.^*</p>
<p>The Queen lost her temper. She summoned him and asked (he reports),
“What have ye to do with my marriage? Or what are ye in thi s common-
wealth?” He made a famous reply: “A subject born within the same,</p>
<p>madam. And albeit I neither be earl, lord, nor baron within it, yet
has God made me (how abject that ever I be in your eyes) a profitable
member within the same.”*^ Mary broke into tears and bade him leave
her.</p>
<p>His boldness reached its peak in October (1563). A crowd again</p>
<p>gathered about the royal chapel to protest against the Mass that was
about to be said there. Andrew Armstrong and Patrick Cranstoun entered
the chapel and frightened the priest into retiring. The Queen, who had
not been present, ordered the trial of the two Calvinists for invading
her premises. On October 8 Knox sent out a letter bidding all “my
brethren,</p>
<p>Il8 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. V</p>
<p>of al l estates 〔classes〕, that have preferred the truth,” to
attend the trial. The Queen’s Council judged this call to be treason,
and cited Knox to stand trial before her. He came (December 21, 1563),
but so great a crowd of his supporters gathered in the courtyard and on
the stairs and “even to the chamber door where the Queen and her Council
sat,” and he defended himself so skillfully, that the Council acquitted
him, and the Queen said, “Mr. Knox, you may return to your home for this
night.” “I pray God,” he replied, “to purge your heart from
papistry.”^®</p>
<p>On Palm Sunday, 1564, the indomitable prophet, aged fifty-nine, mar-
ried his second wife, Margaret Stuart, aged seventeen, a distant
relative of the Queen. A year later the Queen too married a second
time.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE QUEEN IN LOVE: 1 565-68</li>
</ol>
<p>Whom could she marry without a diplomatic mess? A Spaniard? But
France and England would protest, and Protestant Scots would rage. A
Frenchman? But England would oppose, even to war, any renewal of the
Scottish-French alliance. An Austrian — the Archduke Charles? But Knox
from the pulpit already thundered against union with a Catholic
“infidel,” and Elizabeth let Mary know that marriage with a Hapsburg —
old foes of the Tudors — ^would be construed as a hostile act.</p>
<p>In a moment of passion Mary cut the diplomatic knot. Matthew Stuart,
Earl of Lennox, who held himself to be the next in line to Mary for the
Scottish throne, had lost his estates by supporting Henry VIII against
Scotland, and had fled to England to elude the Scots’ revenge; now (Octo
- ber 1564) he thought it timely to return. Soon thereafter came his
nine- teen-year-old son Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who through his
mother was (like Mary) descended from Henry VII of England. Mary was</p>
<p>charmed by the beardless youth; she admired his skill at tennis and
on the lute; she forgave his vanity as the due of his good looks, and
rushed into love before she could discern his lack of mind. On July 29,
1565, over the protests of Elizabeth and half her own Council, Mary made
the lad her husband and named him king. Murray retired from the Council
and joined the enemies of the headstrong Queen.</p>
<p>She enjoyed a few months of troubled happiness. Her need for love had
mounted in her four years of widowhood; it was pleasant to be de- sired!
She gave her love unstintedly, and without stint she lavished gifts upon
her mate. “All dignities that she can indue him with,” reported - came
dictatorial and insolent, and he demanded joint powers of rule with</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS II9</p>
<p>the Queen. Meanwhile he caroused, drank heavily, alienated the
Council, had fits of jealousy, and suspected Mary of adultery with David
Rizzio.</p>
<p>Who was Rizzio? An Italian musician, he had come to Scotland in 1561,
aged twenty-eight, in the train of the ambassador from Savoy. Mary, fond
of music, attached him to her service as organizer of musical fetes. She
en- joyed his wit, his quick intelligence, his varied Continental
culture. As he knew French and Latin well and wrote a fine Italian hand,
she used him also as secretary. Soon she let him draft as well as write
her foreign correspondence; he became an adviser, a power; he shared in
directing policy; he ate with the Queen; sometimes he sat closeted with
her far into the night. The Scottish nobles, seeing themselves
superseded, and suspect- ing Rizzio of serving the Catholic cause,
plotted to destroy him.</p>
<p>At first Damley himself had been captivated by the clever Italian.
They had played together, slept together. But as Rizzio’s functions and
honors grew, and Damley’s foolishness reduced him to political
impotence, the affection of the King for the servant-become-minister
descended the gamut of feeling to hatred. When Mary became pregnant
Damley thought she was bearing Rizzio’s child. Randolph believed it;
and, a generation later, Henri Quatre quipped that James I of England
must be “the modern</p>
<p>Solomon,” since his father was the harpist David.^^ Having warmed his
courage with whiskey, Damley joined with the Earl of Morton, Baron
Ruthven, and other nobles in a plot to murder Rizzio. They signed a</p>
<p>“band” pledging themselves to uphold Protestantism in Scotland and to
give Damley the “crown matrimonial” — full rights as Scot land’s king —
and the right of succession should Mary die. Damley promised to protect
the signers from the consequences “of whatever crime,” and to restore
Murray and other banished lords.^®</p>
<p>On March 6, 1 566, Randolph revealed the plot to Cecil.<em>® On March
9 it was carried out. Damley entered the boudoir where Mary, Rizzio, and
Lady Argyll were at supper; he grasped and held the Queen; Morton,
Ruthven, and others rushed in, dragged Rizzio from the room over Mary’s
helpless protests, and stabbed him to death on the stairs — fifty-sbc
wounds for good measure and sure. Someone rang the town tocsin; a crowd
of armed citizens marched on the palace, proposing to cut Mary “to col -
lops,”</em>® but Damley persuaded them to disperse. All that night and
the next day Mary remained in Holyrood Palace, a prisoner of the
assassins. Meanwhile she played upon Darnley’s terror and love, and he
helped and accompanied her when, on the following night, she escaped and
fled to Dunbar. There, vowing revenge, she issued an appeal to all loyal
sup- porters to come to her defense. Perhaps to divide her enemies, she
re- called Murray to her Council.</p>
<p>The most effective of those who offered her protection was James</p>
<p>Hepburn, fourth Earl of Bothwell. A strange and fateful character:
not</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>handsome, but strong of body, passions, and will; an adventurer on
land and sea, skilled with sword and rapier; cowing men with his cool
audacity, alluring women with his talk, his recklessness, and his
reputation for seducing them; but also a man of superior education, a
lover of and author of books in an age when many a noble Scot could not
write his name. At first the Queen had disliked him, for he had spoken
ill of her; but that is one way of winning a woman’s interest. Then,
seeing his martial qualities, she had appointed him Lieutenant of the
Border; hearing of his familiarity with ships, she had made him Lord
Admiral; learning of his desire for Lady Jane Gordon’s hand, she
promoted their marriage.</p>
<p>Now, fearing the assassins of Rizzio and suspecting her husband’s com
- plicity, she turned to Bothwell for protection and advice. She did not
take to him precipitately, but his masculine qualities of courage,
vigor, and confidence were those that her feminine nature had longed for
and had not found in Francis II or Damley. She noted how respect for his
sword and his troops drove the conspirators into hiding or submission;
soon she felt secure enough to return to Holyrood. Though Knox had
approved the murder of Rizzio, Mary quieted the ministers for a while by
making better provision for their maintenance. The common Scots, never
in love with the lords, sympathized with her, and for a few months more
she enjoyed a general popularity. “I never saw the Queen so much
beloved, esteemed, and honored,” wrote the French ambassador, “or so
great harmony among her subjects.”®^ Never theless, as she approached
her confinement she was obsessed with the thought that she would be
murdered or deposed in her helplessness.®® When she safely gave birth to
a boy (June 19, 1566), all Scotland rejoiced, as if foreseeing that this
lad would be king of both Scotland and England. Mary was in apogee.</p>
<p>But she was miserable with Darnley. He resented her renewed trust in
Murray and her rising admiration for Bothwell. There was talk that</p>
<p>Bothwell would kidnap the royal infant and rule in its name.®®
Darnley accused the nobles of killing Rizzio and claimed innocence; in
revenge they sent to the Queen proof of his participation.®^ Argyll,
Lethington, and Bothwell proposed to the Queen that she should divorce
him; she ob- jected that this might endanger the succession. Lethington
replied that they would find some means of freeing her from Darnley
without prejudice to her son. She did not approve; she offered rather to
retire from Scotland to let Darnley rule; and she ended the interview
with a caution: “I will that ye do nothing whereby any spot may be laid
to my honor or con- science; and therefore, I pray you, let the matter
be as it is, abiding till God of His goodness put remedy ther eto.”®®
Several times now she talked of suicide.®®</p>
<p>In or about October 1566, Argyll, Sir James Balfour, Bothwell,
and</p>
<p>perhaps Lethington signed a pact to get rid of Darnley. The Earl of
Len-</p>

<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>I2I</p>
<p>nox got wind of the plot and warned his son; Darnley, who had been
living apart from Mary, joined his father in Glasgow (December 1566).
There he fell ill, apparently from smallpox, though rumors of poison
rose. Mean- while Mary’s developing intimacy with Bothwell put her under
suspicion of adultery; Knox openly called her a whore.®^ She seems to
have ap- proached Archbishop Hamilton about arranging a divorce of
Bothwell from his wife. She offered to visit Darnley; he sent her an
insulting reply; she went to him nevertheless (January 22, 1567),
asserted her fidelity, and reawakened his love. She begged him to return
to Edinburgh, where, she promised, she would nurse him back to health
and happiness.</p>
<p>Here the “Casket Letters” enter upon the scen e, and the rest of
the</p>
<p>story hinges in part on their authenticity, which is still in dispute
after four hundred years. They were allegedly found in a silver casket
which was presented by Mary to Bothwell and was taken from a servant of
Bothwell on June 20, 1567, by agents of the nobles who were then seek-
ing to dethrone the Queen. The casket was opened on the following day by
Morton, Lethington, and other members of the Privy Council. As</p>
<p>exhibited soon thereafter to the Scottish Parliament, and later to
the Eng- lish commission that tried Mary in 1568, the contents were
eight letters and some fragmentary poems, all in French, undated and
unaddressed but allegedly from Mary to Bothwell. The lords of the
Council swore to the Scottish Parliament that the letters were genuine
and had not been tam- pered with; Mary claimed that they had been
forged. Her son apparently considered them authentic, for he destroyed
them;®® only copies remain. Continental rulers, shown copies, acted as
if believing them genuine.®® Elizabeth at first questioned, then
hesitantly accepted, their authenticity. Our first impulse on reading
them is to doubt that a woman meditating the murder of her husband would
so carelessly and extensively express her intentions in letters
entrusted to carriers who might be intercepted or corrupted; it appears
improbable that letters so incriminating to Both- well should have been
preserved by him; and it is equally improbable that anyone in Scotland,
even the clever Lethington (who is especially sus- pected), could have
forged any substantial part of these letters in the single day between
the capture of the casket and the display of the letters to the Council
or the Parliament. The most incriminating letter — the second — is
strangely long, taking up ten pages in print; if it was forged it is a
most remarkable forgery, for its emotional content seems as true to
Mary’s nature as its writing is like her hand. It shows Mary as a
pitying, hesitating, and ashamed accomplice in the murder of
Darnley.*</p>
<p>• Critical opinion inclines to describe the letters as mostly
genuine, with some interpola - tions. Lord Acton, informed. Catholic,
and honest, thought four of the letters genuine, the second forged.^”
Their text can be read in Andrew Lang’s Mystery of Mary Stuart,
391-44.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>The ailing, fearful, trusting King allowed himself to be carried
across Scotland in a litter and placed in the old parsonage of Kirk o’
Field on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Mary explained that she could not
at once take him to Holyrood, lest he infect their child. For two weeks
he lay there. Mary visited him daily and nursed him so sedulously that
his</p>
<p>strength returned, and he wrote to his father (February 7, 1567), “.
. . my good health is the . . . sooner come through the good treatment
of . . . the Queen, which I assure you hath all this while, and yet
doth, use herself like a natural and loving wife. I hope yet that God
will lighten our hearts with joy that have so long been afflicted with
trouble.”*^ Why she should have nursed him back through tedious weeks if
she knew that he was to be killed is part of the mystery of Mary Stuart.
On the evening of</p>
<p>February 9 she left him to attend the wedding of one of her maids at
Holyrood. That night an explosion occurred in the Kirk o’ Field house,
and in the morning Damley was found dead in the garden.</p>
<p>Mary at first behaved like an innocent woman. She mourned and</p>
<p>lamented and vowed vengeance; she had her room draped in black and
curtained from the light, and she remained there in darkness and
solitude. She ordered a judicial inquiry, and proclaimed a reward in
money and land for infonnation leading to the capture of the criminals.
When plac- ards appeared on city walls charging Bothwell with the
murder, some implicating the Queen, a proclamation called upon the
accusers to come forth with their evidence and promised the informers
protection and rewards. The author(s) of the placards refused to appear,
but the Earl of Lennox urged the Queen to bring Bothwell to trial at
once. Bothwell seconded their demand. On April 12 he stood trial;
Lennox, either lack- ing proofs or fearing Bothwell’s soldiers in the
capital, remained in Glas - gow; Bothwell was acquitted, and the
Parliament officially declared him innocent. On April 19 he persuaded
Argyll, Huntly, Morton, and a</p>
<p>dozen other nobles to sign “Ainslee’s band,” attest ing their faith
in his innocence, pledging themselves to defend him, and approving his
mar- riage with Mary. She now favored Bothwell publicly and added to the
many costly presents that she had already given him.</p>
<p>On AprU 23 she visited her son at Stirling; she was fated never to
see him again. On her way back to Edinburgh she and Lethington were way-
laid by Bothwell and his soldiers and were carried by force to Dunbar
(April 24). Lethington protested; Bothwell threatened to kill him. Mary
saved him and he was released; thereafter he joined the enemies of the
Queen. At Dunbar negotiations were resumed for Bothwell’s divorce. On
May 3 he and Mary returned to Edinburgh; she declared herself free from
constraint; on May 7 he was granted a divorce, and on the fifteenth, her
Catholic confessor having refused to marry them, they were married</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>according to the Protestant rite by the once Catholic Bishop of
Orkney. Catholic Europe, formerly devoted to Mary, now turned against
her as a lost soul. The Catholic clergy of Scotland stood aloof from
her; the</p>
<p>Protestant ministry called for her deposition; the populace was
hostile; a sympathetic few attributed her reckless infatuation to a love
potion given her by Bothwell.</p>
<p>On June 10 an armed band surrounded Borthwick Castle, where Mary and
Bothwell were staying. They escaped, Mary dressed as a man. At Dunbar
Bothwell gathered a thousand men, and with them he and Mary sought to
force their way back to Edinburgh. They were opposed at</p>
<p>Carberry Hill (June 15) by an equal force bearing a banner painted
with figures of Darnley dead and the child James VI. Bothwell offered to
settle the issue by single combat; Mary Refused to allow him; she agreed
to surrender if Bothwell were permitted to escape; later she claimed
that the rebel leaders had promised loyalty to her if she joined them
peacefully.^* Bothwell fled to the coast and made his way to Denmark;
there, after ten years of imprisonment by the Danish King, he died at
the age of forty- two (1578).</p>
<p>Mary accompanied her captors to Edinburgh amid cries of soldiers and
populace: “Burn the whore! Burn her!” “Kill her!” “Drown her!”^® She was
placed under guard in the provost’s house; under her window, where she
appeared disheveled and half clad, the crowd continued to threaten her
with the coarsest epithets. On June 17, over her wild protests, she was
removed to a remote and more secure imprisonment on an island in Loch
Leven, a lake some thirty miles north of the capital. There, accord- ing
to her secretary Claude Nau, she gave birth prematurely to twins.^^ She
sent an appeal to the French government; it refused to interfere.
Elizabeth instructed her envoy to promise Mary protection and to
threaten the nobles with dire punishment if they should harm the Queen.
Knox called for Mary’s execution, and predicted that God would scourge
Scot - land with a great plague if Mary should be spared.^® On June 20
the lords secured the Casket Letters. She appealed to the Parliament for
a hearing; it refused, on the ground that the letters sufficiently
disposed of her case. On July 24 she signed her abdication, and Murray
was made regent for her son.</p>
<p>For almost eleven months she remained a captive in Lochleven Castle.
Gradually the rigor of her confinement was relaxed; she ate with the
family of William Douglas, lord of the castle; his younger brother
George fell in love with her and helped her to escape (March 25, 1568).
She was captured, but on May 2 she tried again and succeeded. Protected
by young Douglas, she reached the mainland, where she was met by a party
of Catholics. They rode through the night to the Firth of Forth, crossed
it.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>and found refuge in the home of the Hamiltons. In five days six
thousand men gathered there, sworn to set her again on the throne. But
Murray called the Protestants of Scotland to arms; at Langside, near
Glasgow, the two forces met (May 13); Mary’s ill -disciplined army was
overwhelmed. She took flight once more and rode wildly through three
nights to</p>
<p>Dundrennan Abbey on Solway Firth. Now she returned to its donor the
diamond that Elizabeth had once given “her dearest sister,” and she
added a message: “I send back to its Queen this jewel, the token of her
promised friendship and assistance.”^® On May 16, 1568, she crossed
Solway Firth in an open fishing boat, entered England, and left her fate
to her rival.</p>
<p>V. expution: 1568-87</p>
<p>From Carlisle she dispatched another message to Elizabeth, asking for
an interview in which she might explain her behavior. Elizabeth, on
prin- ciple averse to supporting rebellion against a legitimate
sovereign, was inclined to invite her, but her Council confused her with
cautions. If Mary were allowed to proceed to France, the French
government would be tempted to send an army to Scotland to restore her
and make Scotland again a Ca tholic ally of France and a thorn in
England’s rear; Mary’s</p>
<p>claim to the throne of England would then be supported by French arms
as well as by English Catholics. If Mary remained free in England she
would iways be a possible source and center of Catholic revolt, and</p>
<p>England was at heart still predominantly Catholic. If England
should</p>
<p>force the Scottish nobles to re-enthrone their Queen, their lives
would be endangered and England would lose her Protestant allies in
Scotland. Cecil would probably have agreed with Hallam that the forcible
deten- tion of the Queen of Scots violated all law, “natural, public,
and munici - pal,”®^ but he felt that his overriding responsibility was
to protect England.</p>
<p>As one function of diplomacy is to dress realism in morality, Mary
was told that before her request for an interview with Elizabeth could
be granted she must clear herself of various charges before a trial
commission. Mary replied that she was a queen and could not be judged by
lay com- missioners,- especially of another nation, and she demanded
freedom to return to Scotland or go to France. She asked to meet Morton
and Leth- ington in Elizabeth’s presence, and promised to prove them
guilty of Darn - ley’s death. The English Council ord ered her removed
from Carlisle (as too near the border) to Bolton Castle, near York (July
13, 1568). Mary submitted to loose imprisonment there on Elizabeth’s
promise, “Put your - self in my hands without reserve; I will listen to
nothing which shall be said against you; your honor shall be safe, and
you shall be restored to</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>your throne.”^* So mollified, Mary consented to appoint
representatives</p>
<p>The trial commission met at York October 4, 1568. Mary was repre-</p>
<p>sented by seven men, chiefly John Leslie, Catholic Bishop of Ross,
and the Catholic Lord Herries of the western marches of Scotland;
Elizabeth had appointed three Protestants: the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl
of Sussex, and Sir Ralph Sadler. Before them appeared Murray, Morton,
and Leth- ington, who privately showed the Englishmen the Casket
Letters. If, they said, Mary would recognize Murray as regent and agree
to reside in England on a large pension from Scotland, the letters would
not be made public. Norfolk, who dreamed of marrying Mary and thereby
becoming King of Eng land on Elizabeth’s death, refused, and Sussex
wrote to Eliza - beth that Mary seemed likely to prove her case.®®</p>
<p>Elizabeth ordered the trial transferred to Westminster. There Murray
laid the Casket Letters before her Council. Opinion remained divided as
to the authenticity of the documents; but Elizabeth ruled that she could
not receive Mary until the authenticity had been disproved. Mary asked
to be shown the letters, either originals or copies; the commissioners
re- fused, and Mary never saw either copies or originals.®^ The
commission disbanded without announcing a decision (January ii, 1569);
Murray was received by Elizabeth and then returned to Scotland with the
letters; Mary, angry and defiant, was removed to stricter custody at
Tutbury on the Trent. Foreign governments protested; Elizabeth replied
that if they saw the evidence that had been presented to the commission
they would consider her treatment of Mary rather lenient than severe.®®
The Spanish ambassador advised Philip to invade England and promised the
collabora- tion of Catholic north England. Philip was skeptical of such
aid, and Alva warned him that Elizabeth might order Mary’s death at the
first sign of invasion or revolt.</p>
<p>Revolt came. On November 14, 1569, the earls of Northumberland and
Westmorland led a rebel army of 5,700 men into Durham, overthrew the
Anglican Communion board, burned the Book of Common Prayer, restored the
Catholic altar, and heard Mass. They planned a dash into Tutbury to
release Mary, but Elizabeth balked them by transferring Mary to Coventry
(November 23, 1569). The Earl of Sussex, with an army</p>
<p>largely composed of Catholics, rapidly suppressed the rebellion.
Elizabeth ordered all captured insurgents and their conniving servants
to be hanged, and “the bodies were not to be removed, but remain till
they fell to pieces</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>where they hung.”®® Some six hundred men were so disposed of, and
their property was confiscated by the Crown. Northumberland and Westmor-
land escaped to Scotland. In February 1570 Leonard Dacres led another
uprising of Catholics; he too was defeated and fled across the
border.</p>
<p>In January 1570 Knox wrote to Cecil advising him to order Mary’s</p>
<p>death at once, for “if ye strike not at the root, the branches that
appear to be broken will bud again.”®^ He had now finished his History
of the Reformation of Religioun toithin the Realme of Scotland — a book
making no pretense to impartiality, a narrative inaccurate but vivid and
vital, a style quaint and idiomatic, sharp with the tongue of a preacher
who called a whore a whore. A bitter man but a great man, building his
dream to pow er more complete than Calvin’s, hating heartily, fighting
bravely, consuming to the last flicker the incredible energy of a
tenacious will. By 1572 he had worn himself out. He could no longer walk
unsupported, but he had himself aided every Sunday to hi s pulpit at
St. Giles’s. On November 9, 1572, he preached for the last time, and the
entire con- gregation escorted him to his home. He died on November 24,
aged sixty- seven, almost as poor as he had been born; he “had not made
merchandise of the Word of God.” He left posterity to judge him. “What I
have been to my country, albeit this unthankful age will not know, yet
the ages to come will be compelled to bear witness to the truth.”®® Few
men have had so decisive an influence upon the beliefs of a people; few
of his time equaled him in encouragement given to education, fanaticism,
and self- government. He and Mary divided the soul of Scotland between
them: he was the Reformation, she was the Renaissance. She lost because
she did not know, like Elizabeth, how to marry them.</p>
<p>Mary, like some restless tiger caged, tried every comer and
possibility of escape. In March 1571 Roberto di Ridolfi, a Florentine
banW active in London, made himself an intermediary between Mary, the
Spanish ambassador, the Bishop of Ross, Alva, Philip, and Pope Pius V.
He pro- posed that Alva should send Spanish troops into England from the
Nether- lands, that a Catholic force should simultaneously invade
England from Scotland, that Elizabeth should be dethroned, that Mary
should be made Queen of England and Scotland, and that Norfolk should
marry her.</p>
<p>Norfolk was told of the plan, did not clearly approve of it, did not
reveal it. Mary tentatively consented.®* The Pope gave Ridolfi money for
the enterprise and promised to recommend it to Philip;®^ Philip made his
own approval conditional on Alva’s; Alva ridiculed the project as
visionary, and nothing came of it but tragedy for Mary’s friends.
Letters of Ridolfi and Norfolk were found on arrested servants of Mary
and the Duke; Norfolk, Ross, and several Catholic nobles were
imprisoned; Norfolk was tried for treason and convicted. Elizabeth
hesitated to sign the death</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>warrant of so prominent a noble, but Cecil, the English Parliament,
and the Anglican hierarchy called for the execution of both Norfolk
and</p>
<p>Mary. Elizabeth compromised by sending Norfolk to the block (June
2,</p>
<p>1572). When news reached England of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew
(August 22), there were revived cries for the death of Mary,®® but</p>
<p>Elizabeth still refused.</p>
<p>Only by remembering that Mary’s captivity lasted almost nineteen</p>
<p>years can we understand her desperation and her sense of bitter
wrong. Her place of imprisonment was repeatedly changed, lest the
sympathy felt for her in the neighborhood and among her custodians
should beget or abet new plots. The conditions of her confinement were
humane. She was permitted to receive her French pension of ^ 1,200 a
year; the Eng- lish government gave her a substantial sum for food,
medical treatment, servants, and entertainment; she was allowed to
attend Mass and other Catholic services. She tried to pass the long
hours with embroidery, read- ing, gardening, and play with her pet
spaniels. As her hope of freedom faded, she lost interest in caring for
herself; she took less exercise and be- came flaccid and fat. She
suffered from rheumatism; sometimes her legs were so swollen that she
could not walk. By 1577, when she was only thirty-five, her hair had
turned white, and thereafter she covered it with a wig.</p>
<p>In June 1583 she offered, if released, to withdraw all claim to the
Eng- lish crown, never more to communicate with conspirators, to live
any- where in England according to Elizabeth’s choice, never to go more
than ten miles from that residence, and to submit to surveillance by
neighboring gentlemen. Elizabeth was advised not to trust her.</p>
<p>Mary resumed her schemes for escape. By a variety of desperate
devices she managed to correspond secretly with the French and Spanish
ambas- sadors and governments, with her adherents in Scotland, and with
repre- sentatives of the Pope. Letters were smuggled in and out, in the
washing, in books, in sticks, in wigs, in the lining of shoes. But the
spies of Cecil and Walsingham uncovered every plot in time. Even among
the students and priests at the Jesuit college in Reims Walsingham had
an agent who kept him informed.</p>
<p>The romantic aura of the captive Queen touched the sympathy of many
young Englishmen, and aroused the ardor of Catholic youths. In 1583
Francis Throckmorton, Catholic nephew of Elizabeth’s late ambassador to
France, organized another plot to release her. He was soon detected;
tortured into confession, he moaned, “I have disclosed the secrets of
her who was the dearest to me in all the world.”®* He died under the
execu - tioner’s ax at the age of thirty.</p>
<p>A year later William Parry, a spy in Cecil’s service, induced a
papal</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>nuncio in Paris to forward to Gregory XIII a request for a plenary
in-</p>
<p>dulgence on the ground that he was entering upon a dangerous attempt
to free Mary Stuart and bring England back to the Catholic Church. The
papal secretary of state replied (January 30, 1584) that the Pope had
seen Parry’s petition, rejoiced at his resolve, was sending him the
desired in - dulgence, and would reward his efforts.®® Parry took this
reply to Cecil. Another English spy, Edmund Neville, accused Parry of
urging him to assassinate Elizabeth. Parry was arrested, confessed, was
hanged, and, still alive, was cut down and dismembered.®^</p>
<p>Angered by a long succession of conspiracies, and frightened by the
assassination of William of Orange, Elizabeth’s Council drew up
(October</p>
<ol start="1584" type="1">
<li>a “Bond of Association” pledging the signers never to accept, as
successor to their Queen, any person in whose behalf Elizabeth’s life
had been attempted, and to prosecute to the death any person involved in
such an enterprise. The bond was signed by the Council, by most members
of Parliament, and by prominent men throughout England. A year later
Parliament gave it the sanction of law.</li>

<p>It did not deter further plots. In 1586 John Ballard, a Roman
Catholic priest, induced Anthony Babington, a rich young Catholic, to
organize a conspiracy for the assassination of Elizabeth, the invasion
of England by armies from Spain, France, and the Low Countries, and the
enthrone- ment of Mary. Babington wrote to Mary about the plot, told her
that six Catholic nobles had agreed to “get rid of the usurper of the
throne,” and asked her approval of the plan. In a letter of July 17,
1586, Mary ac- cepted Babington’s proposals, gave no explicit consent to
the assassination of Elizabeth, but promised rewards for the success of
the undertaking.®^ The messenger to whom her secretary entrusted this
reply was a secret agent of Walsingham; he had the letter copied and
sent the copy to Wal- singham and the letter itself to Babington. On
August 14 Babington and Ballard were arrested; soon three hundred
prominent Catholics were jailed; the two leaders confessed, and Mary’s
secretary was induced to acknowl - edge the authenticity of Mary’s
letter.®® Thirteen of the conspirators were</p>

<p>a polite plea for mercy, but Elizabeth thought that such a plea came
with poor grace from a government that had massacred thousands of
Protestants without trial. Most of Scotland now defended its Queen, but
her son made only a halfhearted intercession, for he suspected that,
because of his Protestantism, she had disowned him in her will. His
agent in London suggested to Walsingham that James VI, though anxious
that his mother should not be beheaded, might be reconciled to much if
the English Parliament would confirm his title to succeed Elizabeth, and
if Elizabeth would increase the pension she had been sending him. The
very canny Scot dallied so greedily that the citizens of Edinburgh
hooted him in the streets.®* Nothing remained between Mary and death but
Elizabeth’s hesitation.</p>
<p>The harassed Queen allowed almost three months to drag by before she
made up her mind, and then she did not. She was capable of generosity
and mercy, but she was tired of living every day in fear of
assassination by the adherents of a woman who had claimed her throne.
She considered the danger of invasion from France, Spain, and Scotland
in protest against the execution of a queen; and she calculated the
possibility that she herself might suffer a natural or violent death in
time to let Mary and Catholicism inherit England. Cecil urged her to
sign the death warrant and promised to take full responsibility for the
results. She thought to avoid decision by intimating that Sir Amias
Paulet, Mary’s keeper, could clea r up the con- fusion by ordering
Mary’s execution on a merely verbal understanding that the Queen or her
Council desired it; but Paulet refused to act without a written order
from Elizabeth. Finally she signed the warrant; her sec- retary, William
Davison, delivered it to the Council, which at once dis- patched it to
Paulet before Elizabeth could change her mind.</p>
<p>Mary, who during this long delay had begun to hope, met the news at
first with unbelief, then with courage. She wrote a touching letter to
Elizabeth, asldng her to “permit my poor desolated servants … to carry
away my corpse, to bury it in holy ground, with the other queens of
France.” On the morning of her execution, we are told, she wrote a
little Latin poem having all the grace and fervor of a medieval
hymn;</p>
<p>O Domine Deus! speravi in te.</p>
<p>O care mi Jesu! nunc libera me.</p>
<p>In dura catena, in misera poena, desidero te;</p>
<p>Languendo, gemendo, et genu flectendo,</p>
<p>Adoro, imploro, ut liberes me.*®®</p>
<p>• O Lord God! I have hoped in Thee.</p>
<p>0 my dear Jesus! now free me.</p>
<p>In cruel chains, in bitter pain, I desire Thee.</p>
<p>Longing, moaning, and bending the knee,</p>
<p>1 pdore. I implore, that you set me free.</p>

<p>She asked to be allowed to confess to her Catholic chaplain; she was
re- fused. Her jailers offered her an Anglican dean instead; she
rejected him. She robed herself royally to meet death, arranged her
false hair carefully, and covered her face with a white veil. A golden
crucifix hung from her neck, an ivory crucifix was in her hand. She
inquired why her attendant women were forbidden to be present at her
execution; she was told that they might make a disturbance; she promised
that they would not, and she was allowed to take two of them and four
men. Some three hundred English gentlemen were admitted to the scene in
the great hall of Fother- ingay Castle (February 8, 1587). Two masked
executioners asked and received her forgiveness. When her women began to
cry she checked them, saying, “I promised for you.” She knelt and
prayed, then laid her head upon the block. The wig fell from her severed
head and disclosed her white hair. She was forty-four years old.</p>
<p>Pardon is the word for all. Pardon for Mary, who labored bravely
to</p>
<p>be a just as well as a joyful queen; we cannot believe that she who
tended her husband so long and brought him back to health had consented
to his murder; we can forgive the young woman who gave up everything for
a love however foolish; we must pity the desolate woman who came to
England for refuge and found, instead, nineteen years of imprisonment;
and we can understand her wild attempts to regain her liberty. But we
can also f orgive the great Queen, whose councilors insisted on Mary’s
confine - ment as vital to England’s security, who saw her life and
policy continually threatened by plots to free and enthrone her rival,
and who prolonged that cruel captivity only because she could not bring
herself to end it with a warrant for Mary’s execution. They were both
noble women: one noble and hastily emotional, the other noble and
hesitantly wise. Fitly they lie near each other in Westminster Abbey,
reconciled in death and peace.</p>
