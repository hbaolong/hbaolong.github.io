<h4 id="chapter-xvii">CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<p>The Mind and Heart of the Jew</p>
<p>500-1300</p>
<p>I. LETTERS</p>
<p>I N every age the soul of the Jew has been torn between the resolve
to make his way in a hostile world, and his hunger for the goods of the
mind. A Jewish merchant is a dead scholar; he envies and generously
honors the man who, escaping the fever of wealth, pursues in peace the
love of learning and the mirage of wisdom. The Jewish traders and
bankers who went to the fairs of Troyes stopped on the way to hear the
great Rashi expound the Talmud. 1 So, amid commercial cares, or
degrading poverty, or mortal contumely, the Jews of the Middle Ages
continued to produce grammarians, theologians, mystics, poets,
scientists, and philosophers; and for a while ( 1 1 50-1 200) only the
Moslems equaled them in widespread literacy and intellectual wealth. 2
They had the advantage of living in contact or communication with Islam;
many of them read Arabic; the whole rich world of medieval Moslem
culture was open to them; they took from Islam in science, medicine, and
philosophy what they had given in religion to Mohammed and the Koran;
and by their mediation they aroused the mind of the Christian West with
the stimulus of Saracen thought.</p>
<p>Within Islam the Jews used Arabic in daily speech and written prose;
their poets kept to Hebrew, but accepted Arabic meters and poetic forms.
In Christendom the Jews spoke the language of the people among whom they
lived, but wrote their literature, and worshiped Yahveh, in the ancient
tongue. After Maimonides the Jews of Spain, fleeing from Almohad
persecu- tion, abandoned Arabic for Hebrew as their literary medium. The
revival of Hebrew was made possible by the devoted labors of Jewish
philologists. The Old Testament text had become difficult to understand
through lack of vowels and punctuation; three centuries of scholarship —
from the seventh to the tenth — evolved the “Masoretic” (tradition
-sanctioned) text by adding vowel points, accent strokes, punctuation
marks, verse separations, and mar- ginal notes. Thereafter any literate
Jew could read the Scriptures of his people.</p>
<p>Such studies compelled the development of Hebrew grammar and
lexicogra- phy. The poetry and learning of Menachem ben Saruk (910-70)
attracted the</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>396 the age of faith (chap. xvii</p>
<p>attention of Hasdai ben Shaprut; the great minister called him to
Cordova, and encouraged him in the task of compiling a dictionary of
Biblical Hebrew. Menachem’s pupil Jehuda ibn Daud Chayuj ( c . 1000) put
Hebrew grammar upon a scientific basis with three Arabic works on the
language of the Bible; Chayuj’s pupil Jonah ibn Janaeh (995 -1050) of
Saragossa surpassed him with an Arabic Book of Critique that advanced
Hebrew syntax and lexicography; Judah ibn Quraish of Morocco (fl. 900)
founded the comparative philology of the Semitic languages by his study
of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic; the Qaraite Jew Abraham al-Fasi (i.e.,
of Fez, c. 980) furthered the matter with a dictionary in which all the
words of the Old Testament were reduced to their roots alpha- betically
arranged. Nathan ben Yechiel of Rome (d. 1106) excelled all other Jewish
lexicographers with his dictionary of the Talmud. In Narbonne Joseph
Kimchi and his sons Moses and David (1160-1235) labored for generations
in these fields; David’s Michlol, or Compendium , became for centuries
the author - itative grammar of Hebrew, and was a constant aid to King
James’ translators of the Bible. 3 These names are chosen from a
thousand.</p>
<p>Profiting from this widespread scholarship, Hebrew poetry emancipated
itself from Arabic exemplars, developed its own forms and themes, and
pro- duced in Spain alone three men quite equal to any triad in the
Moslem or Christian literature of their age. Solomon ibn Gabirol, known
to the Chris- tian world as the philosopher Avicebron, was prepared by
his personal trag- edy to voice the feelings of Israel. This “poet among
philosophers, and phi - losopher among poets,” as Heine called him , 4
was born at Malaga about 1021. He lost both parents early, and grew up
in a poverty that inclined him to morose contemplation. His verses
caught the fancy of Yekutiel ibn Hassan, a high official in the Moslem
city-state of Saragossa. There for a time Gabirol found protection and
happiness, and sang the joy of life. But Yekutiel was assassinated by
enemies of the emir, and Gabirol fled. For years he wandered through
Moslem Spain, poor and sick, and so thin that “a fly could now bear me
up with ease.” Samuel ibn N aghdela, himself a poet, gave him refuge at
Granada. There Solomon wrote his philosophical works, and pledged his
poetry to wisdom:</p>
<p>How shall I forsake wisdom?</p>
<p>I have made a covenant with her.</p>
<p>She is my mother, I am her dearest child;</p>
<p>She hath clasped her jewels about my neck. . . .</p>
<p>While life is mine my spirit shall aspire</p>
<p>Unto her heavenly heights. . . .</p>
<p>I will not rest until I find her source. 5</p>
<p>Presumably his impetuous pride caused his quarrel with Samuel. Still
a youth in his late twenties, he resumed his wandering poverty;
misfortune humbled his spirit, and he turned from philosophy to
religion:</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW</p>
<p>Lord, what is man? A carcass fouled and trodden,</p>
<p>A noxious creature brimming with deceit,</p>
<p>A fading flower that shrivels in the heat. 6</p>
<p>His poetry took at times the somber grandeur of the Psalms:</p>
<p>Establish peace for us, O Lord, We wander ever to and fro,</p>
<p>In everlasting grace, Or sit in chains in exile drear;</p>
<p>Nor let us be of The e abhorred, Yet still proclaim, where’er we
go,</p>
<p>Who art our dwelling place. The splendor of our Lord is here. 7</p>
<p>His masterpiece, Kether Malkuth (Royal Crown), celebrated the
greatness of God as his early poems had celebrated his own:</p>
<p>From Thee to Thee I fly to win Unto Thy mercy I will cling</p>
<p>A place of refuge, and within Until Thou hearken pitying;</p>
<p>Thy shadow from Thy anger hide, Nor will I quit my hold of Thee</p>
<p>Until Thy wrath be turned aside. Until Thy blessing light on me.
8</p>
<p>The richness and variety of Jewish culture in Moslem Spain were
summed up in the Ibn Ezra family at Granada. Jacob ibn Ezra held an
important post in the government of King Habbus under Samuel ibn
Naghdela. His home was a salon of literature and philosophy. Of his four
sons, reared in this at- mosphere of learning, three reached
distinction: Joseph rose to high office in the state, and to leadership
of the Jewish community; Isaac was a poet, a sci- entist, and a
Talmudist; Moses ibn Ezra (i 070-1 139) was a scholar, a phi- losopher,
and the greatest Jewish poet of the generation before Halevi. His happy
youth ended when he fell in love with a beautiful niece, whose father
(his older brother Isaac) married her to his younger brother Abraham.
Moses left Granada, wandered through strange lands, and fed his hopeless
passion with poetry. “Though thy lips drop honey for others to sip, live
on, breathe myrrh for others to inhale. Though thou art false to me, yet
shall I be true to thee till the cold earth claims her own. My heart
rejoices in the nightingale’s song, though the singer soars above me and
afar.” 9 In the end, like Gabirol, he tuned his harp to piety, and sang
psalms of mystic surrender.</p>
<p>Abraham ben Meir ibn Ezra — whom Browning used as a mouthpiece of
Victorian philosophy — was a distant relative, but an intimate friend,
of Moses ibn Ezra. Born in Toledo in 1093, his youth knew hunger, and
thirsted for knowledge in every field. He too wandered from town to
town, from occu- pation to occupation, luckles s in all; “were candles
my merchandise,” he said, with the wry humor of the Jew, “the sun would
never set; if I sold burial shrouds, men would live forever.” He
traveled through Egypt and Iraq to Iran, perhaps to India, back to
Italy, then to France and England; at seventy- five he was returning to
Spain when he died, still poor, but acclaimed throughout Jewry for both
his poetry and his prose. His works were as varied</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>as his domiciles — on mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, religion;
his poems ranged through love and friendship, God and nature, anatomy
and the sea- sons, chess and the stars. He gave poetic form to ideas
ubiquitous in the Age</p>
<p>of Faith, and he anticipated Newman</p>
<p>O God of earth and heaven,</p>
<p>Spirit and flesh are Thine!</p>
<p>Thou hast in wisdom given</p>
<p>Man’s inward light divine</p>
<p>My times are in Thy hand,</p>
<p>Thou knowest what is best;</p>
<p>in a Hebrew melody:</p>
<p>And where I fear to stand</p>
<p>Thy strength brings succor blest.</p>
<p>Thy mantle hides my sins,</p>
<p>Thy mercies are my sure defense;</p>
<p>And for Thy bounteous providence</p>
<p>Thou wilt demand no recompense . 10</p>
<p>His contemporaries valued him chiefly for his Biblical commentaries
on every book of the Old Testament. He defended the authenticity and
divine inspiration of the Hebrew Scriptures, but interpreted as
metaphors the an- thropomorphic phrases applied to the Deity. He was the
first to suggest that the Book of Isaiah was the work of two prophets,
not one. Spinoza consid- ered him a founder of rational Biblical
criticism. 11</p>
<p>The greatest European poet of his age was Jehuda Halevi (1086-1
147?). Born at Toledo a year after its capture by Alfonso VI of Castile,
he grew up in security under the most enlightened and liberal Christian
monarch of the time. One of his early poems pleased Moses ibn Ezra; the
older poet invited Jehuda to come and stay with him in Granada; there
Moses and Isaac ibn Ezra entertained him for months in their homes. His
verses were read, his epi- grams were repeated, in every Jewish
community in Spain. His poetry re- flected his genial character and his
fortunate youth; he sang of love with all the skill and artifice of a
Moslem or Provencal troubadour, and with the sen- suous intensity of the
Song of Songs. One poem — “The Garden of His De - light”— put into
fervent verse the frankest passages of that erotic masterpiece: Come
down, her beloved; why tarriest thou</p>
<p>To feed amid her gardens?</p>
<p>Turn aside to the couch of love,</p>
<p>To gather her lilies.</p>
<p>Secret apples of her breasts</p>
<p>Give forth their fragrance;</p>
<p>For thee she hideth in her necklaces</p>
<p>Precious fruits shining like light. …</p>
<p>She would shame, but for her veil,</p>
<p>All the stars of heaven . 12</p>
<p>Leaving the Ibn Ezras’ courteous hospitality, Halevi went to Lucen a,
and studied for several years in the Jewish academy there; he took up
medicine, and became an undistinguished practitioner. He founded a
Hebrew institute in Toledo, and lectured there on the Scriptures. He
married, and had four children. As he grew older he became more
conscious of Israel’s misfortunes</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 399</p>
<p>than of his own prosperity; he began to sing of his people, their
sorrows, and their faith. Like so many Jews, he longed to end his days
in Palestine.</p>
<p>O City of the World 〔Jerusalem〕, beauteous in proud splendor!</p>
<p>Oh, that I had eagle’s wings that I might fly to thee,</p>
<p>Till I wet thy dust with my tears!</p>
<p>My heart is in the East, while I tarry in the West . 18</p>
<p>Comfortable Spanish Jews accepted such verses as a poetical pose, but
Halevi was sincere. In 1 141, leaving his family in good hands, he began
an arduous pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Unfavorable winds drove his ship off
course to Alexandria. There the Jewish community feted him, and begged
him not to venture into Jerusalem, then in the Crusaders’ hands. After
some delay he went on to Damietta and Tyre, and thence, for some unknown
reason, to Damascus. There he disappeared from history. Legend says that
he made his way to Jerusalem, knelt at the first sight of it, kissed the
earth, and was trampled to death by an Arab horseman. 14 We do not know
if he ever reached the city of his dreams. We do know that at Damascus,
perhaps in the last year of his life, he composed an “Ode to Zion” that
Goet he ranked among the greatest poems in world literature. 15</p>
<p>Art thou not, Zion, fain</p>
<p>To send forth greetings from thy sacred rock</p>
<p>Unto thy captive train</p>
<p>Who greet thee as the remnants of thy flock? . . .</p>
<p>Harsh is my voice when I bewail thy woes;</p>
<p>But when in fancy’s dream</p>
<p>I see thy freedom, forth its cadence flows,</p>
<p>Sweet as the harps that hung by Babel’s stream. . . .</p>
<p>I would that, where God’s Spirit was of yore</p>
<p>Poured out unto thy holy ones, I might</p>
<p>There too my soul outpour!</p>
<p>The house of kings and throne of God wert thou;</p>
<p>How comes it then that now</p>
<p>Slaves fill the throne where sat thy kings before?</p>
<p>Oh, who will lead me on</p>
<p>To seek the posts where, in far distant years,</p>
<p>The angels in their glory dawned upon</p>
<p>Thy messengers and seers?</p>
<p>Oh, who will give me wings</p>
<p>That I may fly away,</p>
<p>And there, at rest from all my wanderings,</p>
<p>The ruins of my heart among thy ruins lay?</p>

<p>Naked and barefoot, to thy ruined fanes</p>

<li>THE ADVENTURES OF THE TALMUD</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jews of that golden age in Spain were too prosperous to be as
deeply religious as their poets became in declining years; they produced
verses joy- ous and sensuous and graceful, and expressed a philosophy
that confidently reconciled the Holy Scriptures with Greek thought. Even
when Almohad fanaticism drove the Jews from Moslem into Christian Spain
they continued to prosper; and Jewish academies flourished under
Christian tolerance in To- ledo, Gerona, and Barcelona in the thirteenth
century. But in France and Germany the Jews were not so fortunate. They
crowded their narrow quar- ters timidly, and gave their best minds to
the study of the Talmud. They did not bother to justify their faith to
the secular world; they never questioned its premises; they consumed
themselves in the Law.</p>
<p>The academy founded by Rabbi Gershom at Mainz became one of the</p>
<p>CHAP, xvn) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 4OI</p>
<p>most influential schools of its time; hundreds of students gathered
there, and shared with Gershom in editing and clarifying, through two
generations of labor, the Talmudic text. A similar role was played in
France by Rabbi She- lomoh ben Yitzhak ( 1 040- 1105), fondly called
Rashi from the first letters of his title and his name. Born at Troyes
in Champagne, he studied in the Jewish academies of Worms, Mainz, and
Speyer; returning to Troyes, he supported his family by selling wine,
but gave every leisure hour to the Bible and the Talmud. Though not
officially a rabbi, he founded an academy at Troyes, taught there for
forty years, and gradually composed commentaries on the Old Testament,
the Mishna, and the Gemara. He did not try, as some Span- ish scholars
had done, to read philosophical ideas into the religious texts; he
merely explained these with such lucid learning that his Talmudic
commen- taries are now printed with the Talmud. The modest purity of his
character and his life won him reverence among his people as a saint.
Jewish communi- ties everywhere in Europe sent him questions in theology
and law, and gave legal authority to his replies. His old age was
saddened by the pogroms of the First Crusade. After his death his
grandsons Samuel, Jacob, and Isaac ben Meir continued his work. Jacob
was the first of the “tosaphists”: for five gen - erations after Rashi
the French and German Talmudists revised and amended his commentaries
with tosafoth or “supplements.”</p>
<p>The Talmud had hardly been completed when Justinian outlawed the book
(553) as “a tissue of puerilities, fables, iniquities, insults,
imprecations , heresies, and blasphemies.” 17 Thereafter the Church
seems to have forgotten the existence of the Talmud; few theologians of
the Latin Church could read the Hebrew or Aramaic in which it was
written; and for 700 years the Jews were free to study the cherished
volumes — so sedulously that they in turn seem almost to have forgotten
the Bible. But in 1239 Nicholas Donin, a French Jew converted to
Christianity, laid before Pope Gregory IX an in- dictment of the Talmud
as containing shameful insults of Christ and the Vir- gin, and
incitations to dishonesty in dealing with Christians. Some of the
charges were true, for the assiduous compilers had so reverenced the
tannaim and amoraim as to include in the haggadic or popular portion of
the Gemara occasional remarks in which irate rabbis had struck back at
Christian cri- tiques of Judaism. 18 But Donin, now more Christian than
the Pope, added several charges that could not be substantiated: that
the Talmud considered it permissible to deceive, and meritorious to
kill, a Christian, no matter how good; that the Jews were allowed by
their rabbis to break promises made under oath; and that any Christian
who studied the Jewish Law was to be put to death. Gregory ordered all
discoverable copies of the Talmud in France, England, and Spain to be
turned over to the Dominicans or the Fran- ciscans; bade the monks
examine the books carefully; and commanded that the books be burned if
the charges proved true. No record has been found of the aftermath of
this order. In France Louis IX directed all Jews to sur-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>render their copies of the Talmud on pain of death, and summoned four
rabbis to Paris to defend the book in public debate before the King,
Queen Blanche, Donin, and two leading Scholastic philosophers — William
of Au- vergne and Albertus Aiagnus. 19 After three days’ inquiry the
King ordered all copies of the Talmud to be burned ( 1 240) . Walter
Cornutus, Archbishop of Sens, interceded for the Jews, and the King
allowed many copies to be restored to their owners. But the Archbishop
died soon afterward, and some monks were of opinion that this was the
judgment of God on the royal leni- ence. Convinced by them, Louis
ordered the confiscation of all copies of the Talmud; twenty-four
cartloads were brought to Paris, and were committed to the flames ( 1
242 ) . The possession of the Talmud was prohibited in France by a papal
legate in 1 248; and thereafter rabbinical studies and Hebrew litera-
ture declined in all of France except Provence.</p>
<p>A similar debate took place in Barcelona in 1263. Raymond of
Penafort, a Dominican monk in charge of the Inquisition in Aragon and
Castile, under- took to convert the Jews of these states to
Christianity. To equip his preachers he arranged for the teaching of
Hebrew in the seminaries of Chris- tian Spain. A converted Jew, Paul the
Christian, assisted him, and so im- pressed Raymond with his knowledge
of both Christian and Jewish theology that the monk arranged a
disputation between Paul and Rabbi Moses ben Nachman of Gerona before
King James I of Aragon. Nachmanides came re- luctantly, fearing victory
as much as defeat. The debate continued for four days, to the delight of
the King; apparently the amenities were reasonably observed. In 1264 an
ecclesiastical commission commandeered all copies of the Talmud in
Aragon, obliterated the anti-Christian passages, and returned the books
to their owners. 20 In an account that Nachmanides wrote of his debate
for the Jewish synagogues of Aragon he spoke of Christianity in terms
that seemed to Raymond grossly blasphemous. 21 The monk protested to the
King, but it was not till 1 266 that James, yielding to papal
insistence, banished Nachmanides from Spain. A year later the rabbi died
in Palestine.</p>

<li>SCIENCE AMONG THE JEWS</li>
</ol>
<p>Jewish science and philosophy in the Middle Ages were almost entirely
domi- ciled in Islam. Isolated and scorned, and yet influenced by their
neighbors, the Jews of medieval Christendom took refuge in mysticism,
superstition, and Mes- sianic dreams; no situation could have favored
science less. Religion, however, encouraged the study of astronomy, for
on this depended the correct determina- tion of the holydays. In the
sixth century the Jewish astronomers of Babylonia substituted astronomic
calculation for direct observation of the heavens; they based the year
on the apparent movements of the sun, and the months on the phases of
the moon; gave Babylonian names to the months; made some months “full”
with thirty days, some “defective” with twenty -nine; and then
reconciled</p>

<p>the lunar with the solar calendar by inserting a thirteenth month
every third, sixth, eighth, eleventh, fourteenth, seventeenth, and
nineteenth year in a nine- teen-year cycle. In the East the Jews dated
events by the Seleucid calendar, which began at 3 1 2 b.c.; in Europe,
in the ninth century, they adopted the present “Jewish era,” anno mundi
— 1 year of the world”— beginning with the supposed creation in 3761
b.c. The Jewish calendar is as clumsy and sacred as our own.</p>
<p>One of the earliest astronomers in Islam was the Jewish scholar
Mashallah (d. c. 815). His De scientia motus or bis was translated from
Arabic into Latin by Gerard of Cremona, and won wide acclaim in
Christendom. His treatise De mercibus ( On Prices ) is the oldest extant
scientific work in the Arabic tongue. The foremost mathematical treatise
of the age 22 was the Hibbur ha-meshihah — on algebra, geometry, and
trigonometry — of Abraham ben Hiyya of Barcelona ( 1065-1 1 36), who
also composed a lost encyclopedia of mathematics, astronomy, optics, and
music, and the earliest surviving Hebrew treatise on the calendar.
Abraham ibn Ezra, in the next generation, found no conflict between
writing poetry and advancing combinatorial analysis. These two Abrahams
were the first Jews to write scientific works in Hebrew rather than in
Arabic. Through such books, and a flood of translations from Arabic into
Hebrew, Moslem science and philosophy invaded the Jewish communities of
Europe, and broadened their intellectual life beyond purely rabbinical
lore.</p>
<p>Profiting in some measure from Islamic science, but also recapturing
their own traditions of the healing art, the Jews of this period wrote
outstanding treatises on medicine, and became the most esteemed
physicians in Christian Europe. Isaac Israeli ( c . 855-^. 955) acquired
such fame as an ophthalmologist in Egypt that he was appointed physician
to the Aghlabid court at Qairwan. His medical works, translated from
Arabic into Hebrew and Latin, were acclaimed as classics throughout
Europe; they were used as textbooks at Salerno and Paris, and were
quoted, after 700 years of life, in Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy
(1621). Tradition describes Isaac as indifferent to wealth, an obstinate
bachelor, and a centenarian. Probably contemporary with him was Asaf
ha-Jehudi, the obscure author of a recently discovered manuscript
reckoned to be the oldest extant medical work in Hebrew, and remarkable
for its teaching that the blood circulates through the arteries and the
veins; had he surmised the function of the heart he would have
completely anticipated Harvey. 23</p>
<p>In Egypt, after the arrival of Maimonides (1 165), the medical art
was domi- nated by Jewish practitioners and texts. Abu al-Fada of Cairo
wrote the principal ophthalmological treatise of the twelfth century,
and al-Kuhin al-Attar com- posed ( c . 1275) a pharmacopoeia still used
in the Moslem world. The Jewish physicians of southern Italy and Sicily
served as one medium through which Arabic medicine entered Salerno.
Shabbathai ben Abraham (913-70), called Donnolo, born near Otranto, was
captured by Saracens, studied Arabic medicine at Palermo, and then
returned to practice in Italy. Benvenutus Grassus, a Jeru- salem Jew,
studied at Salerno, taught there and at Montpellier, and wrote a
Practica oculorum (c. 1250) which Islam and Christendom alike accepted
as the definitive treatise on diseases of the eye; 224 years after its
publication it was chosen as the first book to be printed on its
theme.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>404</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>Rabbinical schools, especially in southern France, gave courses in
medicine, partly to provide rabbis with a secular income. Jewish
physicians trained in the Hebrew academy at Montpellier helped to
develop the famous Montpellier school of medicine. The appointment of a
Jew as regent of the faculty in 1 300 drew upon his people the wrath of
the medical authorities in the University of Paris; the Montpellier
school was forced to close its doors to Jews (1301), and the Hebrew
physicians of the city shared in the banishment of the Jews from France
in 1306. By this time, however, Christian medicine had been
revolutionized by Jewish and Moslem example and influence. The Semitic
practitioners had long since put behind them the theory of sickness as
“possession” by demons; and the success of their rational diagnosis and
therapy had weakened the belief of the people in the efficacy of relics
and other supernatural means of cure.</p>
<p>The monks and secular clergy whose abbeys and churches housed relics
and drew pilgrims found it hard to accept this revolution. The Church
condemned the intimate reception of Jewish doctors into Christian homes;
she suspected that these men had more physic than faith, and she dreaded
their influence upon sick minds. In 1246 the Council of Beziers forbade
Christians to employ Jewish physi - cians; in 1267 the Council of Vienna
forbade Jewish physicians to treat Christians. Such prohibitions did not
prevent some prominent Christians from availing themselves of Jewish
medical skill; Pope Boniface VIII, suffering from an eye ailment, called
in Isaac ben Mordecai; 24 Raymond Lully complained that every monastery
had a Jewish physician; a papal legate was shocked to find that this was
also the fate of many nunneries; and Christian kings of Spain enjoyed
Jewish medical care down to the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. Sheshet
Benveniste of Barcelona, physician to King James I of Aragon (1213-76),
wrote the chief gynecological treatise of his time. The Jews lost their
ascendancy in the medical practice of Christendom only when Christian
universities, in the thirteenth cen- tury, adopted rational
medicine.</p>
<p>For so mobile and scattered a people the Jews contributed little to
the science of geography. Nevertheless the outstanding travelers of the
twelfth century were two Jews — Petachya of Ratisbon and Benjamin of
Tudela — who wrote valuable Hebrew narratives of their journeys through
Europe and the Near East. Ben- jamin left Saragossa in 1160, leisurely
visited Barcelona, Marseilles, Genoa, Pisa, Rome, Salerno, Brindisi,
Otranto, Corfu, Constantinople, the Aegean Isles, An- tioch, every
important city in Palestine, and Baalbek, Damascus, Baghdad, and Persia.
He returned by ship through the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea to Egypt,
Sicily, and Italy, and thence overland to Spain; he reached home in
1173, and died soon afterward. His main interest was in the Jewish
communities; but he described with fair accuracy and objectivity the
geographic and ethnic features of each country on his route. His account
is less fascinating, but probably more reliable, than the reports made
by Marco Polo a century later. It was translated into nearly all
European languages, and remained till our time a favorite book with the
Jews. 25</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 405</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE RISE OF JEWISH PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>The life of the mind is a composition of two forces: the necessity to
believe in order to live, and the necessity to reason in order to
advance. In ages of pov- erty and chaos the will to believe is
paramount, for courage is the one thing needful; in ages of wealth the
intellectual powers come to the fore as offering preferment and
progress; consequently a civilization passing from poverty to wealth
tends to develop a struggle between reason and faith, a “warfare of
science with theology.” In this conflict philosophy, dedicated to seeing
life whole, usually seeks a reconciliation of opposites, a mediating
peace, with the result that it is scorned by science and suspected by
theology. In an age of faith, where hardship makes life unbearable
without hope, philosophy in- clines to religion, uses reason to defend
faith, and becomes a disguised the- ology. Among the three faiths that
divided white civilization in the Middle Ages this was least true of
Islam, which had most wealth, truer of Christen- dom, which had less,
truest of Judaism, which had least. And Jewish phi- losophy ventured
from faith chiefly in the prosperous Jewry of Moslem Spain.</p>
<p>Medieval Jewish philosophy had two sources: Hebrew religion and Mos-
lem thought. Most Jewish thinkers conceived of religion and philosophy
as similar in content and result, differing only in method and form:
what religion taught as divinely revealed dogma, philosophy would teach
as ra- tionally demonstrated truth. And most Jewish thinkers from Saadia
to Maimonides made this attempt in a Moslem milieu, derived their
knowledge of Greek philosophy from Arabic translations and Moslem
commentaries, and wrote in Arabic for Moslems as well as Jews. Just as
Ashari turned against the Mutazilites the weapons of reason, and saved
the orthodoxy of Islam, so Saadia, who left Egypt for Babylonia in the
very year (915) of Ashari’s conversion from skepticism, saved Hebrew
theology by his polemic industry and skill; and Saadia followed not only
the methods of the Moslem mutakallimun, but even the details of their
arguments. 26</p>
<p>Saadia’s victory had the same effect in Eastern Judaism as al -
Ghazali’s in Eastern Islam: it combined with political disorder and
economic decline to smother Hebrew philosophy in the Orient. The rest of
the story belongs to Africa and Spain. At Qairwan Isaac Israeli found
time, amid his medical prac- tice and writing, to compose some
influential philosophical works. His Essay on Definitions gave several
terms to Scholastic logic; his treatise On the Ele- ments introduced
Aristotle’s Physics to Hebrew thought; his Book of Soul and Spirit
replaced the creation story of Genesis with a Neoplatonist scheme of
progressive emanations (“splendors”) from God to the material world;
here was one source of the Cabala.</p>
<p>Ibn Gabirol had more influence as a philosopher than as a poet. It is
one of</p>
<p>4° 6 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>the jeux d? esprit of history that the Scholastics quoted him with
respect as Avicebron, and thought him a Moslem or a Christian; not till
1846 did Salo- mon Munk discover that Ibn Gabirol and Avicebron were
one. 27 The mis- understanding had almost been prepared by Gabirol’s
attempt to write philosophy in terms fully independent of Judaism. His
anthology of proverbs — Choice of Pearls — took nearly all its
quotations from non-Jewish sources, though Hebrew folklore is peculiarly
rich in pointed and pithy apothegms. One pearl is quite Confucian: “How
shall one take vengeance on an enemy? By increasing one’s good
qualities.” 28 This is pra ctically a summary of the treatise On the
Improvement of the Moral Qualities, which Gabirol seems to have composed
at twenty-four, when philosophy is unbecoming. By an arti- ficial
schematism the young poet derived all virtues and vices from the five
senses, with platitudinous results; but the book had the distinction of
seeking to construct, in the Age of Faith, a moral code unsupported by
religious belief. 29</p>
<p>With like audacity Gabirol’s chef - d’oeuvre— Mekor Hayim — refrained
from quoting either the Bible, the Talmud, or the Koran. It was this
unusual supernationalism that made the book so offensive to the rabbis
and, when translated into Latin as Fons vitae ( The Fountain of Life),
so influential in Christendom. Gabirol accepted the Neoplatonism that
permeated all Arabic philosophy, but he imposed upon it a voluntarism
that stressed the action of the will in God and man. We must, said
Gabirol, assume the existence of God as first substance, first essence,
or primary will, in order to understand the ex- istence or motion of
anything at all; but we cannot know the attributes of God. The universe
was not created in time, but flows in continuous and graduated
emanations from God. Everything in the universe except God is composed
of matter and form; these always appear together, and can be sepa- rated
only in thought. 30 The rabbis repudiated this Avicennian cosmology as a
disguised materialism; but Alexander of Hales, St. Bonaventure, and Duns
Scotus accepted the universality of matter under God, and the primacy of
will. William of Auvergne nominated Gabirol as “the noblest of all phi -
losophers,” and thought him a good Christian.</p>
<p>Jehuda Halevi rejected all speculation as vain intellectualism; like
al- Ghazali he feared that philosophy was undermining religion — not
merely by questioning dogma, or ignoring it, or interpreting the Bible
metaphorically, but even more by substituting argument for devotion.
Against the invasion of Judaism by Plato and Aristotle, and the
seduction of Jews by Moham- medanism, and the continuing attacks of
Qaraite Jews upon the Talmud, the poet wrote one of the most interesting
books of medieval philosophy — the Al-Khazari (c. 1140). He presented
his ideas in a dramatic mise-en-scene — the conversion of the Khazar
king to the Jewish faith. Luckily for Halevi the book, though written in
the Arabic language, used the Hebrew alphabet, which confined its
audience to educated Jews. For the story, bringing a</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 407</p>
<p>bishop, a mullah, and a rabbi before the curious king, makes short
work of both Mohammedanism and Christianity. When the Christian and the
Mos- lem quote the Hebrew Scriptures as the word of God, the king
dismisses them and keeps the rabbi; and most of the book is the
conversation of the rabbi instructing a docile and circumcised king in
Judaic theology and ritual. Says the royal pupil to his teacher: “There
has been nothing new since your religion was promulgated, except certain
details concerning paradise and hell.” 31 So encouraged, the rabbi
explains that Hebrew is the language of God, that God spoke directly
only to the Jews, and that only the Jewish prophets were divinely
inspired. Halevi smiles at philosophers who proclaim the supremacy of
reason, and subject God and the heavens to their syllo- gisms and
categories, while obviously the human mind is merely a fragile and
infinitesimal fraction of a vast and complex creation. The wise man (who
is not necessarily learned) will recognize the weakness of reason in
transmun- dane affairs; he will keep to the faith given him in the
Scriptures; and he will believe and pray as simply as a child. 32</p>
<p>Despite Halevi, the fascination of reason survived, and the
Aristotelian in- vasion continued. Abraham ibn Daud (1 110-80) was as
deeply Jewish as Halevi; he defended the Talmud against the Qaraites,
and proudly narrated the History of the Jewish Kings in the Second
Commonwealth. But along with countless Christians, Moslems, and Jews of
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he aspired to prove his faith with
philosophy. Like Halevi, he was born in Toledo, and made his living as a
physician. His Arabic Kitab al-aqidah al-rafiah ( Book of the Sublime
Faith) gave the same answer to Halevi that Aquinas would give to the
Christian enemies of philosophy: the peaceful defense of a religion
against nonbelievers requires reasoning, and cannot rest upon simple
faith. A few years before Averroes ( 1 1 26-98) , a generation before
Maimonides (1135-1204), a century before St. Thomas Aquinas (1224-74),
Ibn Daud labored to reconcile the faith of his fathers with the
philosophy of Aristotle. The Greek would have been amused to find
himself the recipient of such a triple compliment, or to learn that the
Jewish philoso- phers knew him only in the summaries of al-Farabi and
Avicenna, who knew him through imperfect translations and a Neoplatonist
forgery. Truer than St. Thomas to their common Aristotelian source, Ibn
Daud, like Averroes, claimed immortality only for the universal psyche,
not for the individual soul; 33 here, Halevi might have complained,
Aristotle triumphed over the Talmud as well as the Koran. Jewish
philosophy, like medieval philosophy in general, had begun with
Neoplatonism and piety, and was culminating in Aristotle and doubt.
Maimonides would take his start from this Aristotelian stand of Ibn
Daud, and would face with courage and skill all the problems of reason
in conflict with faith.</p>
<p>408</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>V. MAIMONIDES: 1 1 35- 1 2 04</p>
<p>The greatest of medieval Jews was born in Cordova, son of the distin-
guished scholar, physician, and judge Maimon ben Joseph. The boy
received the name of Moses, and it became an adage among Jews that “from
Moses to Moses there a rose none like Moses.” His people knew him as
Moses ben Mai - mon, or, more briefly, Maimuni; when he became a famous
rabbi the initials of his title and his name were combined into the fond
appellation Rambam; and the Christian world expressed his parentage by
terming him Maimonides. A probably legendary story tells how the boy
showed a distaste for study, and how the disappointed father, calling
him “the butcher’s son,” packed him off to live with the father’s former
teacher, Rabbi Joseph ibn Migas. 34 From this poor beginning the second
Moses became adept in Biblical and rabbinical literature, in medicine,
mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy; he was one of the two most
learned men of his time. His only rival was Averroes. Strange to say,
these outstanding thinkers, born in the same city only nine years apart,
seem never to have met; and apparently Maimonides read Aver- roes only
in old age, after his own books had been written. 35</p>
<p>In 1148 Berber fanatics captured Cordova, destroyed churches and
syna- gogues, and gave Christians and Jews a choice between Islam and
exile. In 1 159 Maimonides, with his wife and children, left Spain; for
nine years they lived in Fez, pretending to be Moslems; 36 for there,
too, no Jews or Chris- tians were allowed. Maimonides justified
superficial adherence to Islam among endangered Jews in Morocco by
arguing that “we are not asked to render active homage to heathenism,
but only to recite an empty formula; the Moslems themselves know that we
utter it insincerely in order to circum- vent bigots.” 37 The head rabbi
of Fez did not agree with him, and suffered martyrdom in 1165. Fearing
the same fate, Maimonides left for Palestine; thence he moved to
Alexandria (1165) and old Cairo, where he lived till his death. Soon
recognized as one of the ablest practitioners of his time, he be- came
personal physician to Saladin’s eldest son, Nur -ud-Din Ali, and to Sal-
adin’s vizier al -Qadi al-Fadil al-Baisani. He used his favor at court
to secure protection for the Jews of Egypt; and when Saladin conquered
Palestine Maimonides persuaded him to let the Jews settle there again.
38 In 1177 Mai- monides was made Nagid or head of the Jewish community
in Cairo. A Mos- lem jurist indicted him (1187) as an apostate from
Islam, and demanded the usual death penalty; Maimonides was saved by the
vizier, who ruled that a man converted to Mohammedanism by force could
not rightly be considered a Moslem. 39</p>
<p>During these busy years in Cairo he composed most of his books. Ten
medical works in Arabic transmitted the ideas of Hippocrates, Galen,
Dios- corides, al-Razi, and Avicenna. Medical Aphorisms reduced Galen to
1500 CHAP. XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 409</p>
<p>short statements covering every branch of medicine; it was translated
into Hebrew and Latin, and was frequently quoted in Europe under the
formula Diocit Rabbi Moyses. For Saladin’s son he wrote a treatise on
diet; and for Saladin’s nephew al -Muzaffar I, Sultan of Hamah, he
composed an Essay on Intercourse ( Maqala fi-l-jima) — on sexual
hygiene, impotence, priapism, aphrodisiacs The introduction to this work
struck an unhackneyed note:</p>
<p>Our Lord His Majesty 〔al-Muzaffar〕 — may God prolong his</p>
<p>power! — ordered me to compose a treatise that would help him in-
crease his sexual powers, as he . . . had some hardship in this way. . .
.</p>
<p>He does not wish to depart from his customs concerning sexual inter-
course, is alarmed by the abatement of his flesh, and desires an aug-
mentation 〔of his virility〕 on account of the increasing number of his
female slaves. 40</p>
<p>To these writings Maimonides added several monographs — on poisons,
asthma, hemorrhoids, and hypochondria — and a learned Glossary of Drugs.
Like all books, these medical works contain several items not in accord
with the passing infallibilities of our time — e.g., if the right testis
is larger than the left, the first child will be male; 41 but they are
marked by an earnest desire to help the sick, by a courteous
consideration of contrary opinions, and by wisdom and moderation of
prescription and advice. Maimonides never pre- scribed drugs where diet
could serve. 42 He warned against overeating: “The stomach must not be
made to swell like a tumor.” 43 He thought that wine was healthful in
moderation. 44 He recommended philosophy as a training in the mental and
moral balance and calm conducive to health and lon- gevity. 45</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-three Maimonides began a commentary on the
Mishna, and labored on it for a decade amid commerce, medicine, and
peril- ous journeys by land and sea. Published at Cairo (1158) as Kitab
al-siraj, or Book of the Lamp , its clarity, erudition, and good
judgment at once placed Maimonides, still a youth of thirty-three, next
to Rashi as a commentator on the Talmud. Twelve years later he issued
his greatest work, written in Neo-Hebraic, and provocatively called
Mishna Torah. Here, in logical order and lucid brevity, were arranged
all the laws of the Pentateuch, and nearly all those of the Mishna and
the Gemaras . “I have entitled this work Mishna Torah 〔Repetition of
the Law〕,” said the introduction, “for the reason that a person who
first reads the written Law 〔the Pentateuch〕 and then this
compilation, will know the whole oral Law, without needing to consult
any other book.” 46 He omitted some Talmudic regulations concerning
omens, amulets, and astrology; he was among the few medieval thinkers
who rejected astrology. 47 He classified the 613 precepts of the Law
under fourteen heads, devoted a “book” to ea ch head, and undertook not
only to explain each law, but to show its logical or historical
necessity. Only one</p>
<p>410 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>of the fourteen books has been translated into English; it forms a
substan- tial volume; we may judge the immensity of the original.</p>
<p>It is clear from this work, and from the later Guide to the
Perplexed, that Maimonides was not openly a freethinker. He endeavored
as far as he could to reduce Scriptural miracles to natural causes, but
he taught the divine in- spiration of every word in the Pentateuch, and
the orthodox rabbinical doc- trine that the whole oral Law had been
transmitted by Moses to the elders of Israel . 48 Perhaps he felt that
the Jews could not claim less for their Scrip- tures than the Christians
and Moslems claimed for them; perhaps he, too, considered social order
impossible without belief in the divine origin of the moral code. He was
a stern and dictatorial patriot: “All Israelites are bound to follow
everything in the Babylonian Talmud, and we should force the Jews of
every land to adhere to the customs established by the Talmudic sages.”
49 A bit more liberal than most Moslems and Christians of the time, he
thought that a virtuous and monotheistic non- Jew would go to heaven,
but he was as severe as Deuteronomy or Torquemada on heretics within the
Hebrew pale; any Jew who repudiated the Jewish Law should be put to
death; and “according to my opinion, all members of an Israelite
community which has insolently and presumptuously transgressed any of
the divine precepts must be put to death .” 50 He anticipated Aquinas in
defending death for heresy on the ground that “cruelty against those who
mislead the people to seek vanity is real clemency to the world”; 51 and
he acce pted without trouble the Scriptural penalty of death for
witchcraft, murder, in- cest, idolatry, violent robbery, kidnaping,
filial disobedience, and breaking the Sabbath . 52 The condition of the
Jews migrating from ancient Egypt and trying to form a state out of a
destitute and homeless horde may have warranted these laws; the
precarious status of the Jews in Christian Europe or Moslem Africa,
always subject to attack, conversion, or demoralization, required a hard
code to forge order and unity; but in these matters (and be- fore the
Inquisition) Christian theory, and probably Jewish practice, were more
humane than Jewish law. A better side of this stern spirit shows in
Maimonides’ advice to the Jews of his age: “If heathens should say to
Israel - ites, ‘Surrender one of your number to us that we may put him
to death,’ they should all suffer death rather than surrender a single
Israelite to them.” 53</p>
<p>Pleasanter is his picture of the scholar growing into a sage. He
approved the rabbinical sayin g that “a bastard who is a scholar 〔of
the Law〕 takes precedence of an ignorant high priest.” 54 He advised
the scholar to give three hours daily to earning a living, nine hours to
studying the Torah. Be- lieving environment more influential than
heredity, he counseled the student to seek association with good and
wise men. The scholar should not marry until he has reached the maturity
of his learning, has acquired a trade, and has bought a home . 55 He may
marry four wives, but should cohabit with each of them only once a
month.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 41 1</p>
<p>Although connubial intercourse with one’s wife is always permit -</p>
<p>ted, this relation too should be invested by the scholar with
sanctity.</p>
<p>He should not be always with his spouse, like a rooster, but
should</p>
<p>fulfill his marital obligation on Friday nights. . . . When
cohabiting,</p>
<p>neither husband nor wife should be in a state of intoxication,
lethargy, or melancholy. The wife should not be asleep at the time .
56</p>
<p>And so at last is produced the sage. He</p>
<p>cultivates extreme modesty. He will not bare his head or his body. .
. . When speaking he will not raise his voice unduly. His speech with
all men will be gentle He will avoid exaggeration or affected
speech.</p>
<p>He will judge everyone favorably; he will dwell on the merits of</p>
<p>others, and never speak disparagingly of anybody . 67</p>
<p>He will avoid restaurants except in extreme emergency; “the wise man
will eat nowhere except at home and at his own table.” 58 He will study
the Torah every day until his death. He will beware of false Messiahs,
but will never lose his faith that some day the real Messiah will come,
and restore Israel to Zion, and bring all the world to the true faith,
and to abundance, brotherhood, and peace. “ The other nations vanish,
but the Jews last for- ever.” 69</p>
<p>The Mishna T or ah irritated the rabbis; few could forgive the
presumption of aiming to displace the Talmud; and many Jews were
scandalized by the reported assertion of Maimonides 60 that he who
studies the Law is higher than he who obeys it. Nevertheless the book
made its author the leading Jew of the time. All Eastern Israel accepted
him as its counselor, and sent him questions and problems; it seemed for
a generation that the Gaonate had been revived. But Maimonides, not
pausing to enjoy his renown, began work at once on his next book. Having
codified and clarified the Law for orthodox Jews, he turned to the task
of restoring to the Jewish fold those who had been seduced by philosophy
or lured into the Qaraite communities of hereti- cal Jews in Egypt,
Palestine, or North Africa. After another decade of labor he issued to
the Jewish world his most famous work, the Guide to the Per- plexed
(1190). Written in Arabic with Hebrew characters, it was soon translated
into Hebrew as Moreh Nebuchim, and into Latin, and aroused one of the
bitterest intellectual tempests of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>“My primary object,” says the introduction, “is to explain certain
words occurring in the Proph etic books”— i.e., the Old Testament. Many
Biblical terms and passages have several meanings; literal,
metaphorical, or symboli- cal. Taken literally, some of them are a
stumbling block to persons sincerely religious but also respectful of
reason as man ’s highest faculty. Such persons must not be forced to
choose between religion without reason or reason without religion. Since
reason was implanted in man by God, it cannot be contrary to God’s
revelation. Where such contradictions occur, Maimonides</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>412</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>suggests, it is because we take literally expressions adapted to the
imaginative and pictorial mentality of the simple, unlettered people to
whom the Bible was addressed.</p>
<p>Our sages have said, It is impossible to give a full account of the
crea- tion to man. … It has been treated in metaphors in order that the
un- educated may comprehend it according to the measure of their facul-
ties and the feebleness of their apprehension, while educated persons
may take it in a different sense . 61</p>
<p>From this starting point Maimonides advances to a discussion of
deity. That some supreme intelligence rules the universe he deduces from
the evi- dences of design in nature; but he ridicules the notion that
all things have been made for the sake of man . 62 Things exist only
because God, their source and life, exists; “if it could be supposed
that He does not exist, it would follow that nothing else could possibly
exist.” Since in this way it is essential that God e xist, His existence
is identical with His essence. Now “a thing which has in itself the
necessity of existence, cannot have for its existence any cause
whatever.” # 63 Since God is intelligent, He must be incorporeal;
therefore all Biblical passages implying physical organs or attributes
in God must be interpreted figuratively. In truth, says Maimonides
(probably fol- lowing the Mutazilites), we cannot know anything of God
except that He exists. Even the nonphysical terms that we use of Him —
intelligence, omnip- otence, mercy, affection, unity, will — are
homonyms; i.e., they have differ- ent meanings when applied to God than
as used of man. Just what their meaning is in God’s case we shall never
know; we can never define Him; we must not ascribe to Him any positive
attributes, qualities, or predicates whatever. When the Bible tells how
God or an angel “spoke” to the Proph - ets, we must not imagine a voice
or sound. “Prophecy consists in the most perfect development of the
imaginative faculty”; it is “an emanation from the Divine Being” through
dream or ecstatic vision; what the Prophets re - late took place not in
actuality, but only in such vision or dream, and must in many cases be
interpreted allegorically . 64 “Some of our sages clearly stat ed that
Job never existed, and that he is a poetic fiction . . . revealing the
most important truths.” 65 Any man, if he develops his faculties to
their height, is capable of such prophetic revelations; for human reason
is a continuing revelation, not basically different from the vivid
insight of the prophet. Did God create the world in time, or is the
universe of matter and motion, as Aristotle thought, eternal? Here, says
Maimonides, reason is baffled; we can prove neither the eternity nor the
creation of the world; let us therefore hold to our fathers’ faith in
its creation . 66 He proceeds to interpret the creation story of Genesis
allegorically: Adam is active form or spirit; Eve</p>

<p>is passive matter, which is the root of all evil; the serpent is
imagination. 67 But evil is no positive entity; it is merely the
negation of good. Most of our misfortunes are due to our own fault;
other evils are evil only from a human or limited standpoint; a cosmic
view might discover in every evil the good or need of the whole. 68 God
permits to man the free will that lets him be a man; man sometimes
chooses evil; God has foreseen the choice, but does not determine
it.</p>
<p>Is man immortal? Here Maimonides applies to the full his capacity for
mystifying his readers. In the Guide he avoids the question, except to
say that “the soul that remains after death is not the soul that lives

<p>The storm subsided for a time, and he busied himself in his work as a
physician, and in writing responsa to doctrinal and ethical inquiries

him not to expect</p>

<p>He was prematurely worn out. Richard I of England sought him as per-
sonal physician, but Maimonides could not accept the invitation.
Saladin’s vizier, seeing his exhaustion, pensioned him. He died in 1
204, aged sixty-nine. His remains were conveyed to Palestine, where his
tomb may still be seen in Tiberias.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE MAIMONIDEAN WAR</li>
</ol>
<p>Maimonides’ influence was felt in Islam and Christendom as well as in
the Jewish world. Mohammedan pundits studied the Guide under the
direction of Jewish teachers; Latin translations of it were used at the
universities of Montpellier and Padua; and it was frequently quoted at
Paris by Alexander of Hales and William of Auvergne. Albertus Magnus
followed the lead of Maimonides on many points; and St. Thomas often
considered the views of Rabbi Moyses, if only to reject them. Spinoza,
with perhaps some lack of historical understanding, criticized
Maimonides’ allegorical interpretation - ides some ideas on prophecy,
miracles, and the attributes of God. 76</p>
<p>In Judaism itself Maimonides’ influence was revolutionary. His own
pos - terity carried on his work as scholars and Jews: his son Abraham
ben Moses succeeded him as Nagid and court physician in 1205; his
grandson David ben Abraham and his great-grandson Solomon ben Abraham
also succeeded to the leadership of the Egyptian Jews; and all three
continued the Mai- monidean tradition in philosophy. For a while it
became fashionable to Aristotelize the Bible through allegorical
legerdemain, and to reject the historicity of its narratives; Abraham
and Sarah, for example, were merely a legend representing matter and
form; and Jewish ritual laws had only a</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 415</p>
<p>symbolical purpose and truth. 77 The whole structure of Judaic
theology seemed about to fall upon the heads of the rabbis. Some of them
fought back vigorously: Samuel ben Ali of Palestine, Abraham ben David
of Pos- quieres, Meir ben Todros Halevi Abulafia of Toledo, Don Astruc
of Lunel, Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier, Jonah ben Abraham Gerundi
of Spain, and many more. They protested against “selling the Scriptures
to the Greeks,” denounced the attempt to replace the Talmud with
philosophy, deplored Maimonides’ doubts on immortality, and rejected his
unknowable God as a metaphorical abstraction that would never stir a
soul to piety or prayer. The followers of the mystic Cabala joined in
the attack, and dese- crated Maimonides’ tomb. 78</p>
<p>The Maimonidean war divided the Jewish communities of southern France
precisely when orthodox Christianity was waging there a war of
extermina- tion against the Albigensian heresy. And as Christian
orthodoxy defended itself against rationalism by banning the books of
Aristotle and Averroes from tbe universities, so Rabbi Solomon ben
Abraham of Montpellier — per- haps to forestall Christian attacks upon
Jewish congregations as harboring rationalists — took the unusual step
of anathematizing the philosophical works of Maimonides, and
excommunicating all Jews who should study profane science or literature,
or who should treat the Bible allegorically. The sup- porters of
Maimonides, led by David Kimchi and Jacob ben Machir Tibbon, retaliated
by persuading the congregations of Lunel, Beziers, and Narbonne in
Provence, and those of Saragossa and Lerida in Spain, to excommunicate
Solomon and his followers. Solomon now took a still more startling step:
he denounced the books of Maimonides to the Dominican Inquisition at
Mont- pellier as containing heresies dangerous to Christianity as well
as Judaism. The monks accommodated him, and all procurable publications
of the phi- losopher were burned in public ceremonies at Montpellier in
1 2 34, and at Paris in 1242. Forty days later the Talmud itself was
burned at Paris.</p>
<p>These events drove the supporters of Maimonides to bitter fury. They
arrested the leading adherents of Solomon at Montpellier, convicted them
of informing against fellow Jews, and condemned them to have their
tongues cut out; apparently Solomon was put to death. 79 Rabbi Jonah,
regretting his share in the burning of Maimonides’ books, cam e to
Montpellier, did public penance in the synagogue, and undertook a
pilgrimage of repentance to Moses ben Maimon’s grave. But Don Astruc
resumed the war by proposing a rabbinical ban on any study of the
profane sciences. Nachmanides and Asher ben Yehiel supported him; and in
1305 Solomon ben Abraham ben Adret, the revered and powerful leader of
the Barcelona congregations, issued a decree of excommunication against
any Jew who should teach, or should before the age of twenty-five dare
to study, any secular science ex- cept medicine, or any non-Jewish
philosophy. The liberals of Montpellier replied by excommunicating any
Jew who debarred his son from the study</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>416</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>of science . 80 Neither ban had any wide effect; Jewish youths, here
and there, continued to study philosophy. But the great influence of
Adret and Asher in Spain, and the growth of persecution and fear
throughout a Europe now subject to the Inquisition, drove the Jewish
communities back into intellec- tual as well as ethnic isolation. The
study of science declined among them; purely rabbinical studies ruled
the Hebrew schools. After its escapade with reason the Jewish soul,
haunted with theological terrors and an encompass- ing enmity, buried
itself in mysticism and piety.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE CABALA</li>
</ol>
<p>The isles of science and philosophy are everywhere washed by mystic
seas. Intellect narrows hope, and only the fortunate can bear it gladly.
The medieval Jews, like the Moslems and the Christians, covered reality
with a thousand superstitions, dramatized history with miracles and
portents, crowded the air with angels and demons, practiced magical
incantations and charms, frightened their children and themselves with
talk of witches and ghouls, lightened the mystery of sleep with
interpretations of dreams, and read esoteric secrets into ancient
tomes.</p>
<p>Jewish mysticism is as old as the Jews. It received influences from
the Zoroastrian dualism of darkness and light, from the Neoplatonist
substitution of emanations for creation, from the Neopythagorean
mysticism of number, from Gnostic theosophies of Syria and Egypt, from
the apocrypha of early Christianity, from the poets and mystics of
India, Islam, and the medieval Church. But its basic sources were in the
Jewish mentality and tradition themselves. Even before Christ there had
circulated among the Jews secret interpretations of the creation story
in Genesis and of Chapters I and X of Ezekiel; in the Mishna it was
forbidden to expound these mysteries except privately to a single and
trustworthy scholar. Imagination was free to con- ceive accounts of what
had preceded the creation or Adam, or what would follow the destruction
of the world. Philo’s theory of the Logos or Divine Wisdom as the
creative agency of God was a lofty sample of these specula- tions. The
Essenes had secret writings which were zealously guarded from
disclosure, and Hebrew apocrypha like the Book of Jubilees expounded a
mystic cosmogony. A mystery was made of the Ineffable Name of Yahveh:
its four letters — the “Tetragrammaton”— were whispered to hold a hidden
meaning and miraculous efficacy, to be transmitted only to the mature
and discreet. Akiba suggested that God’s instrument in creating the
world was the Torah or Pentateuch, and that every word or letter of
these holy books had an occult significance and power. Some Babylonian
Geonim ascribed such occult powers to the letters of the Hebrew
alphabet, and to the names of the angels; he who knew those names could
control all the forces of na-</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 417</p>
<p>ture. Learned men played with white or black magic — marvelous
capacities obtainable through alliance of the soul with angels or
demons. Necromancy, bibliomancy, exorcism, amulets, incantations,
divination, and casting of lots played their part in Jewish as in
Christian life. All the wonders of astrology were included; the stars
were letters, a mysterious sky-writing that only the initiate could
read. 81</p>
<p>Sometime in the first century a.d. there appeared in Babylonia an
esoteric book called Sefer Yezira — The Book of Creation. Mystic
devotees, including Jehuda Halevi, attributed its composition to Abraham
and God. Creation, it taught, had been effected through the mediation of
ten sefiroth — numbers or principles: the spirit of God, three
emanations therefrom — air, water, and fire, three spatial dimensions to
the left, and three dimensions to the right. These principles determined
the content, while the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet
determined the forms through which creation could be understood by the
human mind. The book elicited learned commentaries, from Saadia to the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>About 840 a Babylonian rabbi brought these mystic doctrines to the
Jews of Italy, whence they spread to Germany, Provence, and Spain. Ibn
Gabirol was probably influenced by them in his theory of the
intermediate beings between God and the world. Abraham ben David of
Posquieres used the “secret tradition” as a means of drawing Jews away
from the rationalism of Maimonides. His son Isaac the Blind and his
pupil Azriel were probably the authors ( c . 1 190) of the
Sefer-ha-Bahir, or Book of Light , a mystical com- mentary on the first
chapter of Genesis; here the demiurgic emanations of the Sefer Yezira
were changed into Light, Wisdom, and Reason; and this triplication of
the Logos was offered as a Jewish Trinity. 82 Eleazar of Worms
(1176-1238) and Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia (1240-91) offered the Secret
Doctrine as a more profound and rewarding study than the Talmud. Like
Islamic and German mystics, they applied the sensuous language of love
and marriage to the relation between the soul and God.</p>
<p>By the thirteenth century the word qabala, tradition, had come into
gen- eral use to describe the Secret Doctrine in all its phases and
products. About 1 295 Moses ben Shem Tob of Leon published the third
Cabalistic classic, the Sefer ha-Zohar, or Book of Splendor. He ascribed
its composition to Simon ben Yohai, a tanna of the second century;
Simon, said Moses, had been in- spired by the angels and the ten
sefiroth to reveal to his esoteric readers se- crets formerly reserved
for the days of the coming Messiah. All the elements of the Cabala were
brought together in the Zohar: the all-inclusiveness of a God knowable
only through love, the Tetragrammaton, the creative demi- urges and
emanations, the Platonic analogy of macrocosm and microcosm, the date
and mode of the Messiah’s coming, the pre -existence and transmigra-
tion of the soul, the mystical meaning of ritual acts, numbers, letters,
points, and strokes, the use of ciphers, acrostics, and the backward
reading of words,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>418</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>the symbolical interpretation of Biblical texts, and the conception
of woman as sin and yet as also the embodiment of the mystery of
creation. Moses of Leon marred his performance by making Simon ben Yohai
refer to an eclipse of 1 264 in Rome, and use several ideas apparently
unknown before the thir- teenth century. He deceived many, but not his
wife; she confessed that her Moses thought Simon an excellent financial
device. 83 The success of the book inspired similiar forgeries, and some
later Cabalists paid Moses in his own counterfeit by publishing their
speculations under his name.</p>
<p>The influence of the Cabala was far-reaching. For a time the Zohar
rivaled the Talmud as the favorite study of the Jews; some Cabalists
attacked the Talmud as antiquated, literalistic logic-chopping; and some
Talmudists, in- cluding the learned Nachmanides, were strongly
influenced by the Cabalistic school. Belief in the authenticity and
divine inspiration of the Cabala was widespread among European Jews. 84
Their work in science and philosophy suffered correspondingly, and the
Golden Age of Maimonides ended in the brilliant nonsense of the Zohar.
Even upon Christian thinkers the Cabala exer- cised some fascination.
Raymond Lully ( 1 235? — ! 315) adapted from it the number and letter
mysticism of his Ars magna ; Pico della Mirandola ( 1463-</p>

<li><p>thought that he had found in the Cabala final proofs for the
divinity of Christ. 83 Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, Robert Fludd,
Henry More, and other Christian mystics fed on its speculations;
Johannes Reuchlin (1455-</p></li>
<li><p>confessed to poaching upon the Cabala for his theology; and
perhaps Cabalistic ideas infected Jakob Bohme (1575-1624). If a greater
proportion of Jews than of Moslems or Christians sought consolation in
mystic revela- tions, it was because this world turned its worst face to
them, and forced them, for life’s sake, to cloak reality in a web of
imagination and desire. It is the unfortunate who must believe that God
has chosen them for His own.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>RELEASE</li>
</ol>
<p>From mystic exaltation, Messianic disillusionment, periodic
persecution, and the hard routine of economic life, the medieval Jews
found refuge in the obscurity of their congregations and the
consolations of their ritual and creed. They celebrated with piety the
festivals that recalled their history, their tribulations, and their
ancient glory, and patiently adjusted to their urban existence the
ceremonies that once had divided the agricultural year. The vanishing
Qaraites kept the Sabbath in darkness and cold, lest they violate the
Law by kindling fires or lighting lamps; but most Jews, while the rabbis
winked, brought in Christian friends or servitors to keep the fires
burning and tend the lights. Every chance for a banquet was seized with
generosity and pomp: the family gave a feast on the circumcision or
confirmation of a son, the betrothal or marriage of a son or daughter,
the visit of a noted scholar or</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) MIND AND HEART OF THE JEW 419</p>
<p>relative, the occurrence of some religious festival. Sumptuary
regulations of the rabbis forbade the providers of such banquets to
invite more than twenty men, ten women, five girls, and all relatives up
to the third generation. A wedding feast sometimes lasted a week, and
not even the Sabbath was allowed to interrupt it. The bridal pair were
crowned with roses, myrtle, and olive branches; their path was strewn
with nuts and wheat; barley grains were thrown over them as a hint to
fertility; songs and quips accompanied every stage of the event; and in
later medieval days a professional jester was engaged to ensure full
merriment. Sometimes his jests were mercilessly truthful; but almost
always he accepted Hillel’s genial decree, that “every bride is beau -
tiful.” 86</p>
<p>So the passing generation celebrated its own replacement, rejoiced in
its children’s children, and subsided into a harassed but kindly old
age. We see the faces of such old Jews in Rembrandt’s portraits:
features bearing the his - tory of the people and the individual, beards
breathing wisdom, eyes haunted with sad memories but softened with
indulgent love. Nothing in Moslem or Christian morals could surpass the
mutual affection of young and old in Judaism, the love that overlooks
all faults, the quiet guidance of immaturity by experience, and the
dignity with which the life fully lived accepts the naturalness of
death.</p>
<p>When he made his will the Jew left not only worldly goods to his
offspring, but spiritual counsel. “Be one of the first in synagogue,”
reads the will of Eleazar of Mainz ( c . 133 7); “do not speak during
prayers; repeat the re - sponses; and after the service do acts of
kindness.” And then the final instruction:</p>
<p>Wash me clean, comb my hair, trim my nails, as I was wont to do
in</p>
<p>my lifetime, so that I may go clean to my eternal resting place, just
as I used to go on every Sabbath to the synagogue. Put me in the ground
at the right hand of my father; if the space be a little narrow, I am
sure that he loves me well enough to make room for me by his side.
87</p>
<p>When the last breath was drawn, the eyes and mouth of the dead were
closed by the eldest son or the most distinguished son or relative; the
body was bathed and anointed with aromatic unguents, and wrapped in
spotless linen. Almost everyone belonged to a burial society, which now
took the corpse, watched over it, gave it the last religious rites, and
accompanied it to the grave. In the funeral the pallbearers walked with
bare feet; the women pre- ceded the bier, chanted a dirge, and beat a
drum. Any stranger who encoun- tered the procession was expected to fall
in with it and accompany it to the grave. Usually the coffin was placed
near those of dead relatives; to be buried was for a man “to lie with
his fathers,” “to be gathered unto his people.” The mourners did not
despair. They knew that though the individual might die, Israel would
carry on.</p>
