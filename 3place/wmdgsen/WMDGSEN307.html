<h4 id="chapter-xxiv">CHAPTER XXIV</h4>
<p>The Economic Revolution</p>
<p>1066-1300</p>
<p>I. THE REVIVAL OF COMMERCE</p>
<p>E VERY cultural flowering finds root and nourishment in an expansion
of commerce and industry. Moslem seizure of eastern and southern
Mediterranean ports and trade, Moslem, Viking, and Magyar raids,
political disorder under the successors of Charlemagne, had driven
European eco- nomic and mental life to nadir in the ninth and tenth
centuries. The feudal protection and reorganization of agriculture, the
taming of Norse pirates into Norman peasants and merchants, the repulse
and conversion of the Huns, the recapture of the Mediterranean by
Italian trade, the reopening of the Levant by the Crusades, and the
awakening contact of the West with the more advanced civilizations of
Islam and Byzantium, provided in the twelfth century the opportunity and
stimulus for the recovery of Europe, and supplied the material means for
the cultural blossoming of the twelfth century and the medieval meridian
of the thirteenth. For society, as well as for an individual, primuvi
est edere, deinde philosophari — eating must come before philosophy,
wealth before art.</p>
<p>The first step in the economic revival was the removal of restraints
on inter- nal trade. Shortsighted governments had levied a hundred
charges upon the transport and sale of goods — for entering ports,
crossing bridges, using roads or rivers or canals, offering goods for
purchase at markets or fairs. Feudal barons felt justified in exacting
tolls on wares passing through their domains, as states do now; and some
of them gave real protection and service to mer- chants by armed escorts
and convenient hospitality.* But the result of state and feudal
interference was sixty-two toll stations on the Rhine, seventy- four on
the Loire, thirty-five on the Elbe, seventy-seven on the Danube . . . ;
a merchant paid sixty per cent of his cargo to carry it along the Rhine
. 1 Feudal wars, undisciplined soldiery, robber barons, and pirates on
rivers and seas, made roads and waterways a martial risk to merchants
and travelers. The Truce and Peace of God helped land commerce by
proclaiming relatively safe periods for travel; and the growing power of
the kings diminished rob-</p>
<ul>
<li>Some feudal mansions hung their shields, or displayed their coats of
arms, above their portals as a sign of readiness to provide hospitality;
hence such later roadhouse signs as “The Red Eagle,” “The Golden Lion,”
“The Gray Bear.”</li>
</ul>
<p>614</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIv) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 615</p>
<p>bery, established uniform measures and weights, limited and regulated
tolls, and removed tolls altogether from certain roads and markets in
the time of the great fairs.</p>
<p>Fairs were the life of medieval trade. Pedlars, of course, carried
small wares from door to door, artisans sold their products in their
shops, market days gathered sellers and buyers in the towns; barons
sheltered markets near their castles, churches allowed them in their
yards, kings housed them in holies or stores in the capitals. But
wholesale and international trade centered in the regional fairs
periodically held at London and Stourbridge in England, at Paris, Lyons,
Reims, and the Champagne in France, at Lille, Ypres, Douai, and Bruges
in Flanders, at Cologne, Frankfort, Leipzig, and Liibeck in Ger- many,
at Geneva in Switzerland, at Novgorod in Russia The most famous</p>
<p>and popular of these fairs took place in the county of Champagne at
Lagny in January, at Bar-sur-Aube in Lent, at Provins in May and
September, at Troyes in September and November. Each of these six fairs
lasted six or seven weeks, so that in sequence they provided an
international market through most of the year; they were conveniently
located to bring the prod- ucts and merchants of France, the Lowlands,
and the Rhine Valley into con- tact with those of Provence, Spain,
Italy, Africa, and the East; altogether they constituted a major source
of French wealth and power in the twelfth century. Originating as early
as the fifth century in Troyes, they declined when Philip IV ( 1 285-1
314), having taken Champagne from its enlightened counts, taxed and
regulated the fairs into penury. In the thirteenth century they gave
place to maritime commerce and ports.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding and navigation had slowly improved since Roman days.
Hundreds of coastal cities had good lighthouses; many — like
Constantinople, Venice, Genoa, Marseille, Barcelona — had commodious
docks. Vessels were usually small, with half a deck or none, and
carrying some thirty tons; so limited, they could ascend rivers far
inland; hence towns like Narbonne, Bordeaux, Nantes, Rouen, Bruges,
Bremen, though some distance from the sea, were accessible to
ocean-going ships, and became flourishing ports. Some Mediterranean
vessels were larger, carrying 600 tons and 1 500 passengers; 2 Venice
gave Louis IX a ship 108 feet long, manned by 1 10 men. The ancient
galley was still the regular type, with high ornamental poop, one or two
masts and sails, and a low hull for two or three banks of oars — which
might total 200. Most oarsmen were free enlisted men; galley slaves were
rare in the Middle Ages. 3 The art of tacking before the wind, known in
the sixth century, developed leisurely until the twelfth, when — mostly
on Italian ships — fore and aft rigs were added to the old square sail;
4 but the chief motive power still remained in the oars. The compass, of
doubtful origin,* appeared in Christian navigation about 1200; Sicilian
mariners made it available in</p>

<p>rough waters by resting the magnetic needle on a movable pivot; 5
even so another century passed before mariners (the Norse excepted)
dared leave sight of land and steer a straight course across open sea.
From November 1 1 to February 22 ocean voyages were exceptional; they
were forbidden to ships of the Hanseatic League; and most Mediterranean
or Black Sea ship- ping halted in that period. Sea travel was as slow as
in antiquity; from Mar- seille to Acre took fifteen days. Voyages were
not recommended for health; piracies and shipwrecks were numerous, and
the sturdiest stomachs were up- set. Froissart tells how Sir Herve de
Leon took fifteen days tossing between Southampton and Harfleur, and
“was so troubled that he had never health afterward .” 8 As poor
compensation, fares were low; sixpence paid for a Channel crossing in
the fourteenth century; and proportionate costs for freight and long
voyages gave water transport an advantage that in the thir- teenth
century transformed the political map of Europe.</p>
<p>The Christian reconquest of Sardinia (1022), Sicily (1090), and
Corsica (1091) from the Saracens opened the Straits of Messina and the
central Mediterranean to European shipping; and the victories of the
First Crusade regained all but the southern ports of that sea. So
unshackled, commerce bound Europe into a widening web of trade routes,
and connected it not only with Christians in Asia, but with Islamic
Africa and Asia, even with India and the Far East. Goods from China or
India came through Turkestan, Persia, and Syria to Syrian or Palestinian
ports; or through Mongolia to the Caspian and the Volga; or by boat to
the Persian Gulf, up the Tigris or Euphrates, and over mountains and
deserts to the Black Sea, or the Caspian, or the Medi- terranean; or by
the Red Sea through canals or caravans to Cairo and Alex- andria. From
the Moslem ports of Africa trade — mostly Christian in the thirteenth
century — fanned outward to Asia Minor and Byzantium; to Cyprus, Rhodes,
and Crete; to Salonika, the Piraeus, Corinth, and Patras; to Sicily,
Italy, France, and Spain. Constantinople added her luxury products to
the stream of goods, and fed the traffic up the Danube and the Dnieper
to Central Europe, Russia, and the Baltic states. Venice, Pisa, and
Genoa cap- tured the westward Byzantine trade, and fought like savages
for the Chris- tian mastery of the sea.</p>
<p>Strategically placed between the East and West athwart the Mediter-
ranean, with ports facing in three directions upon that sea, and with
northern cities commanding the passes of the Alps, Italy was
geographically bound to profit most from the trade of Europe with
Byzantium, Palestine, and Islam. On the Adriatic stood Venice, Ravenna,
Rimini, Ancona, Bari, Brin- disi, Taranto; on the south, Crotone; along
her west coast Reggio, Salerno, Amalfi, Naples, Ostia, Pisa, and Lucca
carried a rich commerce, and Flor- ence, the banker, pulled the
financial strings; the Arno and the Po took some of the trade inland to
Padua, Ferrara, Cremona, Piacenza, and Pavia; Rome drew the tithes and
fees of European piety to her shrines; Siena and Bologna</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIV) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 617</p>
<p>stood at the generative crossing of great interior roads; Milan,
Como, Brescia, Verona, and Venice gathered into their laps the fruits of
the trade that moved over the Alps to and from the Danube and the Rhine.
Genoa domi- nated the Tyrrhenian Sea as Venice ruled the Adriatic; her
merchant fleet numbered 200 vessels manned by 20,000 men; her trading
ports reached from Corsica to Trebizond. Like Venice and Pisa, Genoa
traded freely with Islam: Venice with Egypt, Pisa with Tunisia, Genoa
with Moorish Africa and Spain. Many of them sold arms to the Saracens
during the Crusades. Powerful popes like Innocent III denounced all
traffic with the Moslems, but gold ran thicker than faith or blood, and
the “blasphemous trade” went on. 7</p>
<p>Her wars with Venice weakened Genoa, and the ports of southern France
and western Spain reached out for a share of Mediterranean commerce.
Mar- seille, stagnant during the Moslem ascendancy, recaptured for a
time her old pre-eminence; but nearby Montpellier, stimulated by her
polyglot popula- tion and culture of Gauls, Moslems, and Jews, rivaled
Marseille in the twelfth century as a southern gateway of France.
Barcelona profited from the old Jewish mercantile families that remained
after its reconquest from Islam; there and at Valencia Christian Spain,
blocked by the Pyrenees, found contact with the Mediterranean world.
Cadiz, Bordeaux, La Rochelle, and Nantes sent their ships along the
Atlantic coasts to Rouen, London, and Bruges; Genoa in the thirteenth
century, Venice in 1317, sent vessels through Gibraltar to all these
Atlantic ports; by 1 300 trade over the Alps diminished, and Atlantic
commerce began to lift the Atlantic nations to that leadership which
Columbus would ensure.</p>
<p>France grew rich on her rivers, liquid strands of unifying trade;
the</p>
<p>Rhone, Garonne, Loire, Saone, Seine, Oise, and Moselle fructified her
com- merce as well as her fields. Britain could not yet rival her; but
the Cinque (Five) Ports on the Channel welcomed foreign ships and goods;
and the Thames at London was already in the twelfth century bordered
with a con- tinuous line of docks, where exports of cloth, wool, and tin
paid for spices from Arabia, silks from China, furs from Russia, and
wines from France. Busier still — busier than any other northern port —
was Bruges, commercial capital and outlet of a Flanders rich in both
agriculture and industry. There, as in Venice and Genoa, the east-west
crossed the north-south axis of Euro- pean trade. Situated near the
North Sea coast opposite England, it imported English wool to be woven
by Flemish or French looms; sufficiently inland to give safe harbor, it
attracted the fleets of Genoa, Venice, and western France, and allowed
them to reallocate their wares along a hundred routes to minor ports. As
ocean transport became safer and cheaper, overland commerce de- clined,
and Bruges succeeded to the Champagne fairs as the northern focus of
European trade. Heavy river traffic on the Meuse, the Scheldt, and the
Rhine brought to Bruges the goods of western Germany and eastern France
for export to Russia, Scandinavia, England, and Spain. Other towns were
nour-</p>
<p>6 l8 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>ished by that river trade: Valenciennes, Cambrai, Tournai, Ghent, and
Ant- werp on the Scheldt; Dinant, Liege, and Maestricht on the
Meuse.</p>
<p>Bruges was the chief western member of the Hanseatic League. To pro-
mote international co-operation against external competition, to arrange
congenial association for merchants stationed away from home, to protect
themselves from pirates, highwaymen, fluctuating currencies, defaulting
debtors, tax collectors, and feudal tolls, the commercial towns of
northern Europe formed in the twelfth century various alliances, which
the Germans called hanses^i.t., unions or guilds. London, Bruges, Ypres,
Troyes, and twenty other cities formed the “London Hanse.” Liibeck,
which had been founded in 1158 as an outpost of German war and trade
with Scandinavia, entered into a similar union with Hamburg (1210) and
Bruges (1252).* Gradually other cities joined — Danzig, Bremen,
Novgorod, Dorpat, Magde- burg, Thorn, Berlin, Visby, Stockholm, Bergen,
London; at its height in the fourteenth century the League bound
fifty-two towns. It held the mouths of all the great rivers — Rhine,
Weser, Elbe, Oder, Vistula — that brought the products of Central Europe
to the North or Baltic Sea; it controlled the trade of northern Europe
from Rouen to Novgorod. For a long time it monopo- lized the herring
fisheries of the Baltic, and the trade of the Continent with England. It
established courts for the settlement of disputes among its mem- bers,
defended its members against lawsuits from without, and at times waged
war as an independent power. It made laws regulating the commercial
oper- ations, even the moral conduct, of its member cities and men; it
protected its merchants from arbitrary legislation, taxes, and fines; it
enforced boycotts against offending cities; it punished default,
dishonesty, or the purchase of stolen goods. It established a “factory”
or trading post in each member city, kept its merchants under its own
German laws wherever they went, and forbade them to marry
foreigners.</p>
<p>The Hanseatic League was for a century an agency of civilization.
It</p>
<p>cleared the Baltic and North Seas of pirates, dredged and
straightened water- ways, charted currents and tides, marked off
channels, built lighthouses, ports, and canals, established and codified
maritime law, and in general sub- stituted order for chaos in northern
European trade. By organizing the mer- cantile class into powerful
associations, it protected the bourgeoisie against the barons, and
promoted the liberation of cities from feudal control. It sued the king
of France for League goods ruined bv his troops, and forced the king of
England to pay for Masses to redeem from purgatory the souls of
Hanseatic merchants drowned by Englishmen. 8 It spread German commerce,
language, and culture eastward into Prussia, Livonia, and Estonia, and
made great cities of Konigsberg, Libau, Memel, and Riga. It controlled
the prices and qualities of goods traded in by its members, and
established such a reputa-</p>

<p>tion for integrity that the name Easterlings (Men from the East),
which the English gave them, was adopted by the English as meaning
sterling worth, and was in this form attached to silver or pound as
meaning trustworthy or real.</p>
<p>But in time the Hanse became an oppressor as well as a defender. It
limited too tyrannically the independence of its constituents; forced
cities into mem- berships by boycotts or violence; fought its
competitors by fair means or foul; it was not above^hiring pirates to
injure a rival’s trade. It organized its own armies, and set itself up
as a state within many states. It did what it could to oppress and
suppress the artisan class from which it derived its wares; all
laborers, and many others, came to fear and hate it as the most powerful
of all monopolies ever engaged in the restraint of trade. When the
workers of England revolted in 1381, they pursued all the Hanseatics
even into church sanctuaries, and murdered all those who could not say
“bread and cheese” with a pure English accent. 9</p>
<p>About 1 1 60 the Hanse seized the Swedish island of Gotland, and
developed Visby as a base and bastion for the Baltic trade. Decade by
decade it extended its control over the commerce and politics of
Denmark, Poland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. In
thirteenth-century Russia, reported Adam of Bremen, Hanseatic merchants
“are as plentiful as dung . . . and strive as hard to get a marten skin
as if it were everlasting salvation.” 10 They fixed their seat at
Novgorod on the Volkhov, lived there as an armed merchant garrison, u
sed St. Peter’s Church as a warehouse, stacked wine casks around its
altar, guarded these stores like ferocious dogs, and fulfilled all the
outward observances of religious piety. 11</p>
<p>Not content, the League turned its thoughts to controlling the trade
of the Rhine. Cologne, which had formed a hanse of its own, was forced
into subordination. But farther south the Hanseatic was stopped by the
Rhenish League, formed in 1 2 54 by Cologne, Mainz, Speyer, Worms,
Strasbourg, and Basel. Still farther south Augsburg, Ulm, and Nuremberg
handled the trade that came up from Italy; to this day one may see in
Venice the Fondaco de’ Tedeschi, their depot on the Grand Canal.
Regensburg and Vienna stood at the western end of the great Danube
artery that took the products of inland Germany through Salonika into
the Aegean, or through the Black Sea to Constantinople, Russia, Islam,
and the East. So European trade came full circle, and the web of
medieval commerce was complete.</p>
<p>What sort of men were the merchants who sent their goods along these
routes amid the suspicious faces, strange tongues, and jealous creeds of
a dozen lands? They came from many peoples and countries, but a great
num- ber of them were Syrians, Jews, Armenians, or Greeks. They were
seldom such businessmen as we know today, safe and sedentary behind a
desk in their own city. Usually they moved with their goods; often they
traveled great</p>
<p>620 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>distances to buy cheaply where the products they wanted abounded, and
returned to sell dear where their goods were rare. Normally they sold,
as well as bought, wholesale — en gros, said the French. The English
translated en gros into grosser , and used this first form of the word
grocer to mean one who sold spices in bulk. 12 Merchants were
adventurers, explorers, knights of the caravan, armed with daggers and
bribes, ready for highwaymen, pirates, and a thousand tribulations.</p>
<p>The variety of laws and the multiplicity of jurisdictions were
perhaps the worst of their harassments, and the progressive formulation
of an interna- tional law of commerce and navigation was one of their
major achievements. If a merchant traveled by land he was subject to a
new court, and perhaps different laws, at every feudal domain; if his
wares were spilled upon the road, the local lord could claim them. If
his ship was stranded it belonged by the “law of wreck” to the landlord
upon whose shores it fell; a Breton lord boasted that a dangerous rock
on his coast was the most precious stone in his crown. 13 For centuries
the merchants fought this abuse; in the twelfth they began to secure its
abrogation. Meanwhile the international Jewish traders had accumulated
for their own use a code of mercantile law; these regulations became the
foundation of the law merchant of the eleventh century. 14 This ms
mercatorum grew year by year through the ordinances issued by lords or
kings for the protection of merchants or visitors from foreign states.
Special courts were established to administer the law merchant; and
significantly these courts disregarded such old forms of evidence or
trial as torture, duel, or ordeal.</p>
<p>As early as the sixth century in the laws of the Visigoths, foreign
merchants had received the right, in disputes affecting only themselves,
to be judged by delegates from their own countries; so began that
consular system by which a trading nation maintained abroad “consuls,”
counselors, to protect and aid their nationals. Genoa established such a
consulate at Acre in 1180; French cities followed suit in the twelfth
century. Agreements among nations — even between Christian and Moslem
states — for such consular rights were among the best medieval
contributions to international law.</p>
<p>A measure of maritime law had survived from antiquity; it never
ceased among the enlightened merchants of Rhodes; and one of the oldest
maritime codes was the Code des Rhodiens of 1167. The Lois d’Oleron were
issued at the end of the twelfth century by an island off Bordeaux to
govern the wine trade, and were adopted by France, Flanders, and
England. The Han- seatic League published a detailed code of maritime
regulations for its members: precautions to be taken for the safety of
passengers and cargo, obligations of rescuer and rescued, duties and
wages of captains and crews, and conditions under which a merchant
vessel might or should become a man-of-war. Penalties in these codes
were severe, but apparently severity was necessary to establish
traditions and habits of nautical discipline and re-</p>

that modern men might for four centuries be free.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PROGRESS OF INDUSTRY</li>
</ol>
<p>The development of industry kept pace with the expansion of commerce;
wider markets stimulated production, and mounting production nourished
trade.</p>
<p>Transport progressed least. Most medieval highways were avenues of
dirt and dust or mud; no crown or culverts carried water from the road;
holes and pools abounded; fords were many, bridges few. Burdens were
carried on pack mules or horses rather than in carts, which could not so
well avoid the holes. Carriages were large and clumsy, rode on iron
tires, and had no springs; 16 they were so uncomfortable, however
ornate, that most men and women pre- ferred to travel on horseback —
both sexes astride. Until the twelfth century the maintenance of roads
depended upon the owner of the adjoining prop- erty, who wondered why he
should spend to mend what chiefly transients used. In the thirteenth
century Frederick II, inspired by Moslem and Byzan- tine examples,
ordered the repair of roads in Sicily and southern Italy; and about the
same time the first “royal highways” were built in France— by lay- ing
stone cubes in a loose bed of earth or sand. In the same century the
cities began to pave their central streets. Florence, Paris, London, and
the Flemish towns built excellent bridges. In the twelfth century the
Church organized religious fraternities for the repair or construction
of bridges, and offered in- dulgences to those who shared in the work;
such freres pontifs built the bridge at Avignon, which still preserves
four arches from their hands. Some monastic orders, pre-eminently the
Cistercians, toiled to keep roads and bridges functioning. From 1176 to
1209 king, clergy, and citizens contrib- uted funds or labor to raising
London Bridge; houses and a chapel rose over it, and twenty stone arches
carried it across the Thames. Early in the thir- teenth century the
first known suspension bridge was thrown over a gorge in the
St. Gotthard Pass of the Alps.</p>
<p>Roads being painful, waterways were popular, and played the leading
role in the transport of goods. One boat could carry as much as 500
animals, and far more cheaply. From the Tagus to the Volga the rivers of
Europe were its main highways, and their direction and outlets
determined the spread of population, the growth of towns, and often
national military policy. Canals were innumerable, though locks were
unknown.</p>
<p>Whether by boat or by land, travel was arduous and slow. A bishop
took twenty-nine days to go from Canterbury to Rome. Couriers with fresh
relays of horses could make a hundred miles a day; but private couriers
were costly, and the post (re-established in Italy in the twelfth
century) was normally</p>
<p>62 2 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>confined to government affairs. Here and there — as between London
and Oxford or Winchester — a regular stagecoach service was available.
News, like men, traveled slowly; intelligence of Barbarossa’s death in
Cilicia took four months to reach Germany. 16 Medieval man could eat his
breakfast with- out being disturbed by the industriously collected
calamities of the world; or those that came to his ken were fortunately
too old for remedy.</p>
<p>Some advances were made in the harnessing of natural power. The
Domes- day Book recorded 5000 water mills in England in 1086; and a
drawing of 1 1 69 pictures a water wheel whose leisurely revolutions
were multiplied to high speed by a succession of diminishing gears. 17
With such acceleration the water wheel became a basic instrument of
industry; a water-driven sawmill appears in Germany in 1 245 ; 18 one
water mill at Douai (1313) was used in making edged tools. The windmill,
first reported in western Europe in 1105, spread rapidly after Christian
notice of its wide use in Islam; 19 Ypres alone had 1 20 in the
thirteenth century.</p>
<p>Improved tools and expanding needs encouraged an outburst of mining.
The commercial demand for a reliable gold coinage, and the increasing
ability of people to satisfy the passion for jewelry, led to renewed
washing of gold grains from rivers, and the mining of gold in Italy,
France, England, Hun- gary, and above all in Germany. Toward 1175 rich
veins of copper, silver, and gold were found in the Erz Gebirge (i.e.,
ore mountains) ; Freiberg, Gos- lar, and Annaberg became the centers of
a medieval “gold rush”; and from the little town of Joachimsthal came
the word joachimsthaler — meaning coins mined there — and, by inevitable
shortening, the German and English words thaler and dollar . 20 Germany
became the chief provider of precious metal for Europe, and its mines
formed the foundation — its commerce the framework — of its political
power. Iron was mined in the Harz Mountains and in West- phalia, in the
Lowlands, England, France, Spain, and Sicily, and once more in ancient
Elba. Derbyshire mined lead, Devon, Cornwall, and Bohemia tin, Spain
mercury an d silver, Italy sulphur and alum, and‘Salzburg took its name
from its great deposits of salt. Coal, used in Roman England but
apparently neglected in the Saxon period, was mined again in the twelfth
century. In 1237 Queen Eleanor abandoned Nottingham Castle because of
fumes from the coal burned in the town below; and in 1301 London forbade
the use of coal because smoke was poisoning the city — medieval
instances of a sup- posedly modern woe. 21 Nevertheless by the end of
the thirteenth century coal was actively mined at Newcastle and Durham,
and elsewhere in Eng- land, Belgium, and France.</p>
<p>The ownership of mineral deposits became a confusion of laws. When
feudal tenure was strong the lord claimed all mineral rights in his
land, and mined the deposits with his serfs. Ecclesiastical properties
made similar claims, and used serfs or hired miners to exhume valuable
deposits from their land. Frederick Barbarossa decreed that the
sovereign was sole proprietor of all</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 623</p>
<p>minerals in the soil, and that these could be worked only by firms
under state control. 22 This reassumption of the “regalian right” usual
under the Roman emperors became the law of medieval Germany. In England
the crown claimed all silver and gold deposits; baser metals could be
mined by the land- owner on payment of a “royal - ty” to the king.
23</p>
<p>Smelting was by charcoal, and used up much wood in still primitive
fur- naces. Even so the coppersmiths of Dinant produced fine brass
wares; the ironworkers of Liege, Nuremberg, Milan, Barcelona, and Toledo
made excel- lent arms and tools; and Seville was renowned for its steel.
Toward the end of the thirteenth century cast iron (fused at 1 535
degrees C.) began to replace wrought iron (softened by 800 degrees C.) ;
nearly all previous ironworking had been by hammering — the smiting from
which the smith derived his Saxon name. Bell founding was an important
industry, for cathedrals and town bel- fries rivaled one another in the
weight, sonority, and timbre of their bells. Coppersmiths made curfews (
convr e-feus ) to cover hearth fires when cur- few rang. Saxony was
famous for its bronze founders, England for its pewter — a mixture of
copper, bismuth, antimony, and tin. Wrought iron made ele- gant window
gratings, majestic grilles for cathedral choirs, and mighty hinges that
spread in varied forms over doors for strength and ornament. Goldsmiths
and silversmiths were numerous, for gold or silver plate served not only
to display or disguise one’s worth, but also to hedge a man against
deflated currencies, and to give him, in emergency, a form of wealth
con- vertible into food or goods.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century the textile industry in Flanders and Italy
assumed a large-scale, semicapitalist structure, in which thousands of
workers pro- duced goods for the general market, and earned profits for
investors whom they seldom saw. In Florence the Arte della Lana , or
Wool Guild, had great factories ( fondachi ) where washers, fullers,
sorters, spinners, weavers, in- spectors, and clerks worked under one
roof, with materials, tools, and looms over which they had no ownership
or control. 24 Wholesale cloth merchants organized factories, provided
equipment, secured labor and capital, fixed wages and prices, arranged
distribution and sale, took the risks of enterprise, bore the losses of
failure, and reaped the profits of success. 25 Other employers preferred
to farm out the raw material to individual workers or families who, with
their own equipment, would turn it into finished products at home, and
would deliver these to the merchant for a wage or price; in this manner
thou- sands of men and women in Italy, Flanders, and France were brought
into industrial occupations. 20 Amiens, Beauvais, Lille, Laon,
St. Quentin, Provins, Reims, Troyes, Cambrai, Tournai, Liege, Louvain —
above all, Ghent, Bruges, Ypres, and Douai — became whirlpools of such
commission industry, famous for their artistry and their revolts. Laon
gave its name to laruon (a linen), Cambrai to cambric, and the diaper
pattern took its name from d’ Ypres. 27 At Ghent 2300 weavers worked at
looms; Provins had 3 200 in the thirteenth cen-</p>
<p>624 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>tury. 28 A dozen Italian cities had their own textile industries. At
Florence in the twelfth century the Arte della Lana specialized in the
production of dyed woolen goods; early in the thirteenth century the
Arte di Calimala, or Cloth Guild, organized an extensive business in the
import of wool and the export of finished fabrics. By 1306 Florence had
300 textile factories, and by 1336, 30,000 textile workers. 20 Genoa
made fine velvets and gold-threaded silks. Toward the end of the
thirteenth century Vienna imported Flemish weavers, and soon had a
flourishing textile industry of her own. England had almost a monopoly
in northern Europe’s production of wool; it sent most of its products to
Flanders, and thereby bound that country to it in policy and war. The
town of Worstead, in Norfolk, gave its name to a variety of woolen
cloth. Spain also turned out fine wool; her merino sheep were a main
source of her national income.</p>
<p>The Arabs had brought the culture and manufacture of silk to Spain in
the eighth century, and to Sicily in the ninth; and Valencia, Cartagena,
Seville, Lisbon, and Palermo continued the arts after becoming
Christian. Roger II imported Greek and Jewish silk weavers from Corinth
and Thebes into Pa-</p>
<p>lermo in 1147, and housed them in a palace; through these men and
their children sericulture spread through Italy. Lucca organized the
manufacture of silk on a capitalistic scale, rivaled by Florence, Milan,
Genoa, Modena, Bologna, and Venice. The art crossed the Alps, and
developed skilled prac- titioners in Zurich, Paris, and Cologne.</p>
<p>A hundred other crafts rounded out the scope of medieval industry.
Pot- ters glazed earthenware vessels by powdering their moistened
surface with lead and baking them in a gentle heat, adding copper or
bronze to the lead if they wished a green instead of a yellow glaze. As
buildings and fires became more costly in the growing cities of the
thirteenth century, tiles replaced thatched roofs; London made the
change mandatory in 1212. The building trades must have been competent,
for some of the sturdiest structures existing in Europe date from this
period. Industrial glass was made for mirrors, win- dows, and vessels,
but on a relatively small scale. Cathedrals had the finest glass ever
produced, but many houses had none. Glass blowing was practiced in
western Europe from at least the eleventh century; probably the art had
never ceased in Italy from its heyday under the Roman Empire. Paper,
till the twelfth century, was imported from the Moslem East or Spain;
but in 1 190 a paper mill was opened at Ravensburg in Germany, and in
the thir- teenth century Europe began to make paper from linen. Hides
were among the leading articles of international commerce, and tanning
was universal; glovers, saddlers, purse makers, shoemakers, and cobblers
were jealously dis- tinct. Furs were brought in from north and east, and
were dressed for royalty, nobility, and bourgeoisie. Wine and beer
served instead of central heating, and many towns profited by a
municipal monopoly of brewing. The Ger- mans already led the world in
this ancient art; and Hamburg, with 500</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 625</p>
<p>breweries in the fourteenth century, owed most of its prosperity to
its ale.</p>
<p>Aside from textiles, industry remained in the handicraft stage.
Workers serving a local market — bakers, cobblers, blacksmiths,
carpenters, etc. — con- trolled their own equipment and product, and
remained individually free. Most industry was still carried on in the
homes of the workers, or in shops attached to their homes; and most
families performed for themselves many of the tasks now delegated to
shops or factories — baked their bread, wove their clothing, mended
their shoes. In this domestic industry progress was slow; tools were
simple, machines few; motives of competition and profit did not
stimulate men to invention, or the replacement of human skill with
mechanical power. And yet this may have been the most wholesome form of
industrial organization in history. Its productivity was low, its degree
of contentment was probably and relatively high. The worker remained
near his family; he determined the hours and (in some measure) the price
of his work; his pride in his skill gave him character and confidence;
he was an artist as well as an artisan; and he h ad the artist’s
satisfaction of seeing an integral product taking form under his
hands.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MONEY</li>
</ol>
<p>The commercial and industrial expansion revolutionized finance. Com-
merce could not advance by barter; it required a stable standard of
value, a convenient medium of exchange, and ready access to investment
funds.</p>
<p>Under Continental feudalism the great lords and prelates exercised
the right of mintage, and European economy suffered from a bedlam of
curren- cies worse than today’s. Counterfeiters an d coin clippers
multiplied the chaos. The kings ordered such gentry to be dismembered,
or emasculated, or boiled alive; 30 but they themselves repeatedly
debased their currencies.* Gold be- came scarce after the barbarian
invasions, and disappeared from the coinages of Western Europe after the
Moslem conquest of the East; between the eighth and the thirteenth
centuries all such coinages were in silver or baser metals. Gold and
civilization wax and wane together.</p>
<p>In the Byzantine Empire, however, gold was coined throughout the
Middle Ages. As contact between West and East grew, Byzantine gold
coins, called bezants in the West, began to circulate through Europe as
the most honored money in Christendom. In 1 228 Frederick II, having
observed the beneficent effect of a stable gold currency in the Near
East, minted in Italy the first gold coins of western Europe. He called
them augustales in frank emulation of Augustan coins and prestige; they
deserved the name, for though imitative, they were of noble design, and
reached at once the highest level of medieval</p>

<p>numismatic art. In 1 252 both Genoa and Florence issued gold coins;
the Flor- entine florin, equaling in value a pound of silver, was the
more beautiful and viable, and was accepted throughout Europe. By 1284
all the major nations of Europe except England had a trustworthy gold
coinage — an achievement sacrificed in the turmoil of the twentieth
century.</p>
<p>By the end of the thirteenth century the kings of France had bought
up or confiscated nearly all seignorial rights to the coining of money.
The French monetary system kept till 1789 the terms, though hardly the
values, established by Charlemagne: the livre or pound of silver; the
sou or twentieth part of a livre ; and the denier or twelfth part of a
sou. This system was brought to England by the Norman invasion; there,
too, the “pound sterling” was divided into twenty parts — shillings —
and each of these into twelve parts — pence. The English took the words
pound, shilling, and penny from the German Pfund, Schilling , and
Pfennig; but took the signs for them from the Latin: £ from libra, s.
from solidus , d. from denarius. England did not arrive at a gold
currency till 1343; her silver currency, however, as established by
Henry II (1154-89), remained the most stable in Europe. In Germany the
silver mark was coined in the tenth century, at half the value of the
French or British pound.</p>
<p>Despite these developments, medieval currencies suffered from
fluctua- tions of value, the unsteady ratio of silver to gold, the power
of the kings and cities — sometimes of nobles and ecclesiastics — to
call in all coins at any time, charge a fee for reminting, and issue new
coins debased with more alloy. Through the dishonesty of the mints,
through the more rapid increase of gold than of goods, through the
convenience of redeeming national debts in de- preciated money, an
irregular deterioration affected all European currencies through
medieval and modern times. In France the livre had in 1789 only 1.2 per
cent of its value under Charlemagne. 32 We may judge the fall of money
from some typical prices: at Ravenna in 1268 a dozen eggs cost “a
penny”; at London in 1328 a pig cost four shillings, an ox fifteen; 33
in thirteenth- century France three francs bought a sheep, six a pig. 34
History is inflation- ary.*</p>
<p>Where did the money come from that financed and expanded commerce and
industry? The greatest single provider was the Church. She had an un-
paralleled organization for raising funds, and had always a liquid
capital available for any purpose; she was the greatest financial power
in Christen- dom. Moreover, many individuals deposited private funds for
safekeeping with churches or monasteries. From her wealth the Church
lent money to persons or institutions in difficulty. Loans were made
chiefly to villagers</p>

in 1200 as worth forty times its value in 1930. 35 Ignoring fluctuations

currency or precious metal in 1948.</li>

<p>seeking to improve their farms; they acted as land banks and played a
benefi- cent role in promoting a free peasantry. 36 As early as 1070
they lent money to neighboring lords in exchange for a share in the
revenues of the lords’ property; 37 through these mortgage loans the
monasteries became the first banking corporations of the Middle Ages.
The abbey of St. Andre in France did so flourishing a banking business
that it hired Jewish moneylenders to manage its financial operations. 38
The Knights Templar lent money on inter- est to kings and princes, lords
and knights, churches and prelates; their mort- gage business was
probably the largest in the world in the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>But these loans by church bodies were usually for consumption or for
political use, seldom for financing industry or trade. Commercial credit
began when an individual or a family, by what Latin Christendom called
commenda, commended or entrusted money to a merchant for a specific
voyage or enterprise, and received a share of the profits. Such a silent
or “sleeping” partnership was an ancient Roman device, probably
relearned by the Christian West from the Byzantine East. So useful a way
of sharing in profits without directly contravening the ecclesiastical
prohibition of interest was bound to spread; and the “company” ( com
-panis , bread-sharer) or fam- ily investment became a societas , a
partnership in which several persons, not necessarily kin, financed a
group or series of ventures rather than one. Such financial
organizations appeared in Genoa and Venice toward the end of the tenth
century, reached a high development in the twelfth, and largely ac-
counted for the rapid growth of Italian trade. These investment groups
often distributed their risk by buying “parts” in several ships or
ventures at a time. When, in fourteenth-century Genoa, such shares (
partes ) were made trans- ferable, the joint-stock company was born.</p>
<p>The greatest single source of finance capital — i.e., funds to meet
the pre- income costs of an undertaking — was the professional
financier. He had begun in antiquity as a money-changer, and had long
since developed into a moneylender, investing his own and other people’s
money in enterprises, or in loans to churches, monasteries, nobles, or
kings. The role of the Jews as moneylenders has been exaggerated; they
were powerful in Spain, and for a time in Britain, weak in Germany,
outdone in Italy and France by Christian financiers. 39 The chief lender
to the kings of England was William Cade; the chief lenders in
thirteenth-century France and Flanders were the Louchard and Crespin
families of Arras; 40 William the Breton described Arras at that time as
“glutted with usurers.” 41 Another center of northern finance was
the</p>
<p>In these days (1235) the abominable plague of Cahorsians raged so</p>
<p>fiercely that there was scarcely any man in all England,
especially</p>
<p>among the prelates, who was not entangled in their nets. The king</p>
<p>62 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>was indebted to them for an incalculable account. They circum-</p>
<p>vented the indigent in their necessities, cloaking their usury under
the pretense of trade. 42</p>
<p>The papacy for a time entrusted its financial affairs in England to
the Cahors- ian bankers; but their ruthlessness so offended the English
that one of their number was murdered at Oxford, Bishop Roger of London
pronounced an anathema upon them, and Henry III banished them from
England. Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, lamented on his deathbed
the extortions of “the merchants and exchangers of our lord the Pope,”
who “are harder than the Jews.” 43</p>
<p>It was the Italians who developed banking to unprecedented heights in
the thirteenth century. Great banking families rose to supply the sinews
of far- reaching Italian trade: the Buonsignori and Gallerani in Siena,
the Fresco- baldi, Bardi, and Peruzzi in Florence, the Pisani and
Tiepoli in Venice. . . . They extended their operations beyond the Alps,
and lent great sums to the ever-needy kings of England and France, to
barons, bishops, abbots, and towns. Popes and kings employed them to
collect revenues, manage mints and finances, advise on policy. They
bought wool, spices, jewelry, and silk wholesale, and owned ships and
hotels from one end of Europe to the other. 44 By the middle of the
thirteenth century these “Lombards,” as the North called all Italian
bankers, were the most active and powerful financiers in the world. They
were hated at home and abroad for their exactions, and were envied for
their wealth; every generation borrows, and denounces those who lend.
Their rise dealt a heavy blow to Jewish international banking, and they
were not above recommending the banishment of these patient competitors.
45 The strongest of the “Lombards” were the Florentine banking firms, of
whom eighty are recorded between 1260 and 1 3 47 - 46 They financed the
po- litical and military campaigns of the papacy, and reaped rich
rewards; and their position as papal bankers provided a useful cover in
operations that were hardly in harmony with the views of the Church on
interest. They made profits worthy of modern times; the Peruzzi, for
example, paid a forty per cent dividend in 1 308. 47 But these Italian
firms almost atoned for their greed by their vitalizing services to
commerce and industry. When their tide ebbed they left some of their
terms — banco, credito, debito, cassa (money box, cash), conto, disconto
, conto corrente , netto , bilanza, banco, rotta (bank broken,
bankruptcy) — in almost all European languages. 48</p>
<p>As these words suggest, the great money firms of Venice, Florence,
and Genoa, in or before the thirteenth century, developed nearly all the
functions of a modern bank. They accepted deposits, and carried current
accounts — between parties having an unfinished series of money
transactions. As early as 1 1 7 1 the Bank of Venice arranged exchanges
of accounts among its clients by mere bookkeeping operations. 49 They
made loans, and as security they accepted jewelry, costly armor,
government bonds, or the right to collect</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 629</p>
<p>taxes or manage the public revenue. They received goods in bond for
transfer to other countries. Through their international connections
they were able to issue letters of credit by which a deposit made in one
country would be returned to the depositor, or his appointee, in another
country — a device long known to the Jews, the Moslems, and the
Templars/’ 0 Conversely, they wrote</p>
<p>Insurance too had its beginnings in the thirteenth century. The
merchant guilds gave their members insurance against fire, shipwreck,
and other mis- fortunes or injuries, even against lawsuits incurred for
crimes — whether the members were guilty or innocent. 52 Many
monasteries offered a life annuity: in return for a sum of money paid
down, they promised to provide the donor with food and drink, sometimes
also with clothes and lodging, for the rest of his life. 53 As early as
the twelfth century a Bruges banking house offered insurance on goods;
and a chartered insurance company was apparently es- tablished there in
1 3 io. 54 The Bardi of Florence, in 1318, accepted insurance risks on
overland assignments of cloth.</p>
<p>The first government bonds were issued by Venice in 1157. The needs
of war led the republic to exact forced loans from the citizens; and a
special department ( Camera degli lmpresidi ) was set up to receive rhe
loans, and give the subscribers interest-bearing certificates as state
guarantees of repay- ment. After 1206 these government bonds were made
negotiable and trans- ferable; they could be bought or sold, or used as
security for loans. Similar certificates of municipal indebtedness were
accepted at Como in 1250 as equivalent to metal currency. Since paper
money is merely a governmental promise to pay, these negotiable gold
certificates marked the beginning of paper money in Europe. 55</p>
<p>The complicated operations of the bankers, the papacy, and the
monarchies required a careful system of bookkeeping. Archives and
account books swelled with records of rents, taxes, receipts,
expenditures, credits, and debts. The accounting methods of imperial
Rome, lost in western Europe in the seventh century, continued in
Constantinople, were adopted by the Arabs, and were revived in Italy
during the Crusades. A fully developed system of</p>
<p>630 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>double-entry bookkeeping appears in the communal accounts of Genoa in
1 340; the loss of Genoese records for the years from 1 278 to 1 340
leaves open the probability that this advance was also an achievement of
the thirteenth century. 50</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>INTEREST</li>
</ol>
<p>The greatest obstacle to the development of banking was the
ecclesiastical doctrine of interest. This had three sources: Aristotle’s
condemnation of in - terest as an unnatural breeding of money by money,
57 Christ’s condemnation of interest, 58 and the reaction of the Fathers
of the Church against commer- cialism and usury in Rome. Roman law had
legalized interest, and “honor - able men” like Brutus had charged
merciless rates. Ambros e had denounced the theory that one may do what
he likes with his own:</p>
<p>“My own,” say you? What is your own? When you came from</p>
<p>your mother’s womb, what wealth did you bring with you? That</p>
<p>which is taken by you, beyond what suffices you, is taken by vio-</p>
<p>lence. Is it that God is unjust in not distributing the means of life
to us equally, so that you should have abundance while others are in
want?</p>
<p>Or is it not rather that He wished to confer upon you marks of
His</p>
<p>kindness, while He crowned your fellow man with the virtue of pa-</p>
<p>tience? You, then, who have received the gift of God, think you that
you commit no injustice by keeping to yourself alone what would be the
means of life to many? It is the bread of the hungry you cling to, it is
the clothing of the naked you lock up; the money you bury is the
redemption of the poor . 50</p>
<p>Other Church Fathers had verged upon communism. “The use of all that
is in the world,” said Clement of Alexandria, “ought to be common to all
men. But by injustice one man has called this his own, another that; and
so has come division among men.” 00 Jerome held all profit unjust;
Augustine con - sidered all “business” an evil, as “turning men from
seeking true rest, which is God.” 01 Pope Leo I had rejected these ext
reme doctrines; but the mood of the Church continued unsympathetic to
commerce, suspicious of all specula- tion and profit, hostile to all
“engrossing,” “forestalling,” and “usury”— by which last term the Middle
Ages meant any interest charge whatever. “Usury,” said Ambrose, “is
whatever is added to the capital”; 02 and Gratian embodied this blunt
definition in the canon law of the Church.</p>
<p>The councils of Nicaea (325), Orleans (538), Macon (585), and Clichy
(626) had forbidden the clergy to lend money for gain. The capitularies
of Charlemagne for 789, and the Church councils of the ninth century,
extended the prohibition to laymen. The revival of Roman law in the
twelfth century emboldened Irnerius and the “glossators” of Bologna to
defend interes t, and they were able to quote Justinian’s Code in its
behalf. But the Third Council</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 6 3 1</p>
<p>of the Lateran (i 179) renewed the prohibition, and decreed “that
manifest usurers shall not be admitted to communion, nor, if they die in
sin, to Chris- tian burial; and no priest shall accept their alms.” 03
Innocent III must have taken a more lenient view, for in 1 206 he
advised that in certain cases a dowry “should be committed to some
merchant,” so that an income mi ght be de- rived from it “by honest
gain.” 04 Gregory IX, however, returned to the conception of usury as
any receipt of any profit on a loan; 65 and this remained the law of the
Roman Church till 1917.</p>
<p>The wealth of the Church was in land, not in trade; she scorned
merchants as the feudal baron scorned them; land and labor (including
management) seemed to her the only true creators of wealth and value.
She resented the rising power and opulence of a mercantile class not too
well disposed to feudal landowners or to the Church; she had for
centuries thought of all moneylenders as Jews; and she felt justified in
rebuking the hard terms ex- acted by moneylenders from needy
ecclesiastical institutions. By and large, the effort of the Church to
control the profit motive was an heroic assertion of Christian morality;
it formed a wholesome contrast to the imprisonment or enslavement of
debtors that had disgraced Greek, Roman, and barbarian life and law. W e
cannot be sure that men are happier today than they would have been had
the view of the Church prevailed.</p>
<p>For a long time the legislation of governments supported the position
of the Church; and the prohibition of interest was enforced in the
secular courts. 06 But commercial necessity proved stronger than fear of
prison or hell. The expansion of trade and industry demanded the use of
idle money by active enterprise; states at war or in other emergencies
found it easier to bor- row than to tax; guilds both lent and borrowed
at interest; landowners ex- tending their property, or leaving for
crusades, welcomed the moneylender; churches themselves, and
monasteries, survived their crises or rising costs or needs by recourse
to the Lombards, the Cahorsians, or the Jews.</p>
<p>The wits of men found many subterfuges from the law. A borrower would
sell land cheap to the lender, leave him the usufruct as interest, and
later repurchase the land. Or the landowner sold to the lender some or
all of the annual rents or revenues of his land; if, for example, A sold
to B for 00 the rents of a parcel yielding f 10.00 a year, B was in
effect lending A 00 at ten per cent. Many monasteries invested their
funds by buying such “rent charges”— above all in Germany, where the
word for interest, Zins , grew out of the medieval Latin for rents,
census .° 7 Towns borrowed money by deeding to the lender a share in
their revenues. 68 Individuals and institu- tions, including
monasteries, lent money in return for secret gifts or fictitious sales.
09 Pope Alexande r III complained in 1163 that “many of the clergy”
(chiefly monastic) “while they shrink from common usury as from a thing
too plainly condemned, do notwithstanding lend money to others who are
in need, take their possessions in pledge, and receive the fruits
therefrom accru-</p>

<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>ing beyond the principal lent.” 70 Some borrowers pledged themselves
to pay “damages” increasing for every day or month of delay in repaying
a loan; and’ the date of payment was placed so early as to make such
concealed inter- est inevitable; 71 on this basis the Cahorsians lent
money to certain monasteries on terms equivalent to sixty per cent per
year. 72 Many banking firms openly lent at interest, and claimed
immunity on the theory that the law applied only to individuals. The
cities of Italy made no excuses for paying interest on their government
bonds. In 1 208 Innocent III remarked that if all usurers were ex-
cluded from the Church as canon law demanded, all churches might as well
be closed. 73</p>
<p>The Church reluctantly adjusted herself to realities. St. Thomas
Aquinas, about 1250, courageously formulated a new ecclesiastical
doctrine of inter- est: the investor in a business enterprise might
legitimately share in the gain if he actually shared in the risk or the
loss; 74 and loss was interpreted to include any delay in the repayment
of the loan beyond a stipulated date. 75 St. Bona- ventura and Pope
Innocent IV accepted the principle, and widened it to legitimize a
payment made to a lender in return for the temporary loss of the use of
his capital. 76 Some fifteenth-century canonists admitted the right of
states to issue interest-bearing bonds; Pope Martin V in 1425 legalized
the sale of rent charges; after 1400 most European states repealed their
laws against interest; and the Church prohibition survived as a dead
letter which all agreed to ignore. The Church tried to find a solution
by encouraging St. Bernardino of Feltre and other ecclesiastics in
establishing, from 1251 on, montes pietatis — u h s of love”— where
trustworthy persons in need, by de- positing some article as a pledge,
might obtain loans without interest. But these precursors of our
pawnbrokers’ shops touched only a small sector of the problem; the needs
of commerce and industry remained, and capital rose to meet them.</p>
<p>The professional moneylenders exacted high rates of interest not so
much because they were conscienceless devils as because they ran great
risks of loss and head. They could not always enforce their contracts
through appeals to the law; their accumulations were subject to
requisition by kings or emperors; they could at any moment be banished,
and were at all times damned. Many loans were never repaid; many
borrowers died bankrupt; some went on cru- sades, were excused from
paying interest, and never returned. When bor- rowers defaulted, the
lenders could only make up the loss by raising rates on other loans; the
good loan had to pay for the bad one, as the price of com- modities
bought must include the cost of commodities spoiled before sale. In
twelfth-century France and England the interest rate ranged between 3 3
Vi per and 43 1 /sper; 77 sometimes it rose to 86per; in prosperous
Italy it sank to 1 2 perper to 20per ; 78 Frederick II, about 1240,
tried to lower the rate to 10per, but soon paid more than that to
Christian moneylenders. As late as 1409 the government of Naples allowed
40per as the legal maximum. 70 The</p>

<p>interest rate fell as the security of loans rose, and as the
competition of lenders increased. Gradually, through a thousand
experiments and errors, men learned to use the new financial tools of a
progressive economy, and the Age of Money began in the Age of Faith.</p>
<p>V. THE GUILDS</p>
<p>In ancient Rome there were countless collegia, scholae, sodalitates,
artes — associations of artisans, merchants, contractors, political
clubs, secret frater- nities, religious brotherhoods. Did any of these
survive to beget the medieval guilds?</p>
<p>Two letters of Gregory I (590-604) refer to a corporation of soap
makers at Naples, and to another of bakers at Otranto. In the law code
of the Lom- bard King Rotharis (636-52) we read of magistri Comacini —
apparently master masons from Como, who speak of one another as
collegantes — col- leagues of the same collegium . 80 Associations of
transport workers are men- tioned in seventh-century Rome and in
tenth-century Worms. 81 The ancient guilds continued in the Byzantine
Empire. In Ravenna we find references to many scholae or economic
associations — in the sixth century to bakers, in the ninth to notaries
and merchants, in the tenth to fishermen, in the eleventh to victualers.
We hear of artisan ministeria in ninth-century Venice, and of a
gardeners’ schola in eleventh -century Rome. 82 Doubtless most of the
ancient guilds in the West succumbed to the barbarian invasions, and the
resulting reruralization and poverty; but some seem to have survived in
Lombardy. When commerce and industry recovered in the eleventh century
the condi- tions that had begotten the collegia regenerated the
guilds.</p>
<p>Consequently these were strongest in Italy, where the old Roman
institu- tions were best preserved. In Florence, in the twelfth century,
we find arti — “arts,” craft unions— of notaries, clothiers, wool
merchants, bankers, physi- cians and druggists, mercers or silk dealers,
furriers, tanners, armorers, innkeepers 83 These guilds were apparently
modeled on those of Constan- tinople. 84 North of the Alps the
destruction of the ancient collegia was presumably more complete than in
Italy; yet we find them mentioned in the laws of Dagobert I (630), the
capitularies of Charlemagne (779, 789), and the ordinances of Archbishop
Hincmar of Reims (852). In the eleventh century the guilds reappear in
France and Flanders, and multiply rapidly as charites, frairies
(brotherhoods), or compagnies. In Germany the guilds (hanse) stemmed
from old Markgenossenschaften — local associations for mutual aid,
religious observances, and holiday hilarity. By the twelfth cen- tury
many of these had become trade or craft unions; and by the thirteenth
century these were so strong that they contested political as well as
economic authority with the municipal councils. 85 The Hanseatic League
was such a</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>634</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>guild. The first mention of English guilds is in the laws of King Ine
(688-</p>
<ol start="726" type="1">
<li>, which speak of gegildan — associates who helped one another to pay
any wergild assessed against them. The Anglo-Saxon word gild (cf. the
German Geld , the English gold and yield) meant a contribution to a
common fund, and later the society that administered the fund. The
oldest reference to English trade guilds is dated 109 3. 86 By the
thirteenth century nearly every important town in England had one or
more guilds, and a kind of municipal “guild socialism” held sway in
England and Germany.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nearly all the guilds of the eleventh century were merchant guilds:
they included only independent merchants and master workmen; they
excluded all persons dependent upon others. They were frankly
institutions in restraint of trade. They usually persuaded their towns
to keep out, by a high protec- tive tariff or elsewise, goods
competitive with their own; such alien goods, if allowed to enter the
town, were sold at prices fixed by the affected guild. In many cases a
merchant guild obtained from commune or king a local or national
monopoly in its line or field. The Paris Company for the Transit of
Merchandise by Water almost owned the Seine. By city ordinance or eco-
nomic pressure the guild usually compelled craftsmen to work only for
the guild or with its consent, and to sell its products only to or
through the guild.</p>
<p>The greater guilds became powerful corporations; they dealt in a
variety of goods, purchased raw materials wholesale, provided insurance
against losses, organized the food supply and sewage disposals of their
towns, paved streets, built roads and docks, deepened harbors, policed
highways, super- vised markets, regulated wages, hours, conditions of
labor, terms of appren- ticeship, methods of production and sale, prices
of materials and wares. 87 Four or five times a year they fixed a “just
price” that in their judgment gave fair stimulus and reward to all
parties concerned. They weighed, tested, counted all products bought or
sold in their trade and area, and did their best to keep inferior or
dishonest goods from the market. 88 They banded to- gether to resist
robbers, feudal lords and tolls, refractory workmen, tax- levying
governments. They took a leading part in politics, dominated many
municipal councils, effectively supported the communes in their
struggles against barons, bishops, and kings, and themselves evolved
into an oppressive oligarchy of merchants and financiers.</p>
<p>Usually each guild had its own guild hall, which in the later Middle
Ages might be architecturally ornate. It had a complex personnel of
presiding aldermen, recorders, treasurers, bailiffs, sergeants. … It had
its own courts to try its members, and required its members to submit
their disputes to the guild court before resorting to state law. It
obligated its members to help a fellow guildsman in sickness or
distress, to rescue or ransom him if attacked or jailed. 80 It
supervised the morals, manners, and dress of its members, and fixed a
penalty for coming to meeting stockingless. When two members of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIv) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 635</p>
<p>the Leicester Merchants’ Guild engag ed in fisticuffs at Boston Fair,
their fellows fined them a barrel of beer, to be co-operatively drunk by
the guild. 90 Each guild had an annual feast for its patron saint, when
a brief prelude of prayer sanctioned a day of moist exuberance. It
shared in financing and adorning the city’s churches or cathedral, and
in preparing and performing those miracle plays which mothered the
modern drama; and in municipal parades its dignitaries marched in
gorgeous liveries, displaying the banners of their trade in colorful
pageantry. It provided for its members insurance against fire, flood,
theft, imprisonment, disability, and old age. 91 It built hos - pitals,
almshouses, orphanages and schools. It paid for the funerals of its
dead, and for the Masses that would rescue their souls from purgatory.
Its pros- perous decedents seldom failed to remember it in their
wills.</p>
<p>Normally excluded from these merchant guilds, and yet subject to
their economic regulations and political power, the craftsmen in each
industry began in the twelfth century to form in each town their own
craft guilds. In 1099 we find guilds of weavers in London, Lincoln, and
Oxford, and, soon afterward, of fullers, tanners, butchers, goldsmiths.
. . . Under the names of arti, Xunfte, metie rs, “companies,”
“mysteries,” they spread throughout Eu - rope in the thirteenth century;
Venice had fifty-eight, Genoa thirty-three, Florence twenty-one, Cologne
twenty-six, Paris one hundred. About 1254 Etienne Boileau, “provost of
merchants”— secretary of commerce — under Louis IX, issued an official
Livre des Metiers , or Book of T rades, giving the rules and regulations
of 101 Paris guilds. The division of labor in this list is astonishing:
in the leather industry, for example, there were separate unions for
skinners, tanners, cobblers, harness makers, saddlers, and makers of
fine leather goods; in carpentry there were distinct unions of chest
makers, cabi- netmakers, boatbuilders, wheelwrights, coopers, twiners.
Each guild jeal- ously guarded its craft secrets, fenced in its field of
work against outsiders, and engaged in lively jurisdictional disputes.
92</p>
<p>In the spirit of the times the craft guild took a religious form and
a patron saint, and aspired to monopoly. Ordinarily no one might follow
a craft unless he belonged to its guild. 93 The guild leaders were
annually elected by full assemblies of their craft, but were often
chosen by seniority and wealth. Guild regulations determined — as far as
merchant guilds, municipal ordi- nances, and economic law would allow —
the conditions under which the members worked, the wages they received,
the prices they charged. Guild rules limited the number of masters in an
area, and of apprentices to a master; forbade the industrial employment
of wome n except the master’s wife, or of men after six p.m.; and
punished members for unjust charges, dishonest deal- ing, and shoddy
goods. In many cases the guild proudly stamped its products with its
“trademark” or “〔guild〕 hallmark,” certifying their quali ty; 94 the
cloth guild of Bruges expelled from the city a member who had forged
the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>636</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Bruges hallmark on inferior goods . 95 Competition among masters in
quantity of production or price of product was discouraged, lest the
cleverest or hard- est masters become too rich at the expense of the
rest; but competition in quality of product was encouraged among both
masters and towns. Craft, like merchant, guilds, built hospitals and
schools, provided diverse insurance, succored poor members, dowered
their daughters, buried the dead, cared for widows, gave labor as well
as funds to building cathedrals and churches, and pictured their craft
operations and insignia in cathedral glass.</p>
<p>The fraternal spirit among the masters did not prevent a sharp
gradation of membership and powers in the craft guilds. At the bottom
was the appren- tice, ten to twelve years old, bound by his parents, for
a period of from three to twelve years, to live with a master workman,
and serve him in shop and home. In return he received food, clothing,
shelter, and instruction in the trade; in the later years of his
service, wages and tools; at the. end of his term, a gift of money to
start him on his own. If he ran away he was to be returned to his master
and punished; if he continued to abscond he was forever de- barred from
the craft. On completing his service he became a journeyman (serviteur,
gar g on, compagnon, varlet) , passing from one master to another as a
day ( journee ) laborer. After two or three years the journeyman, if he
had enough capital to open his own shop, was examined for technical
ability by a board of his guild; if he passed he was made a master.
Sometimes — but only in the later Middle Ages — the candidate was
required to submit to the governors of the guild a “masterpiece”— a
satisfactory sample of his craft.</p>
<p>The graduate craftsman, or master, owned his tools, and usually
produced goods directly on order of the consumer, who in some cases
provided the materials, and might at any time come in and watch the
work. The middle- man, in this system, did not control the avenues
between the maker and the user of goods. The scale of the craftsman’s
operations was limited by the market for which he produced, which was
usually his town; but he was not dependent upon the fluctuations of a
general market, or the mood of distant investors or purchasers; he did
not know the economic paranoia of alternat- ing exaltations and
depressions. His hours were long — eight to thirteen hours a day; but he
chose them himself, worked in a wisely leisurely way, and enjoyed many a
religious holiday. He ate nourishing food, bought sturdy furniture, wore
simple but durable clothing, and had at least as wide a cul- tural life
as the master workman of today. He did not read much, and was spared
much stupefying trash; but he shared actively in the song and dance, the
drama and ritual, of his community.</p>
<p>Throughout the thirteenth century the craft guilds waxed in number
and power, and provided a democratic check on the oligarchic merchant
guilds. But the craft guilds in turn became an aristocracy of labor.
They tended to restrict mastership to masters’ sons; they underpaid
their journeymen, who in the fourteenth century weakened them with
repeated revolt; and they</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 637</p>
<p>raised ever higher barriers against entry into their membership or
their towns . 96 They were excellent organizations for an industrial age
when dif- ficulties of transportation often narrowed the market to local
buyers, and capital accumulations were not yet sufficiently rich and
fluid to finance large- scale undertakings. When such funds appeared the
guilds — merchant or craft — lost control of the market, and therefore
of the conditions of work. The Industrial Revolution destroyed them in
England by the slow fatality of economic change; and the French
Revolution abruptly disbanded them as hostile to that freedom and
dignity of work that for a bright moment they had once sustained.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE COMMUNES</li>
</ol>
<p>The economic revolution of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, like
those of the eighteenth and the twentieth, caused a revolution in
society and government. New classes rose to economic and political
power, and gave to the medieval city that virile and pugnacious
independence which culmi- nated in the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The question of heredity versus environment affects the cities, as
well as the guilds, of Europe; were they the lineal descendants of Roman
munici- palities, or new concretions deposited by the stream of economic
change? Many Roman cities maintained their continuity through centuries
of chaos, poverty, and decay; but only a few in Italy and southeastern
France kept the old Roman institutions, and fewer still the old Roman
law. North of the Alps, barbarian laws had overlaid the Roman heritage;
and in some measure the political customs of the German tribe or village
had seeped even into ancient municipalities. Most transalpine towns
belonged to feudal domains, and were ruled by the will and appointees of
their feudal lords. Municipal institutions were alien, feudal
institutions natural, to the Teutonic conquer- ors. Outside of Italy,
the medieval city rose through the formation of new commercial centers,
classes, and powers.</p>
<p>The feudal town had grown up, usually on elevations, at the junction
of roads, or along vital waterways, or on frontiers. Around the walls of
the feudal castle or fortified monastery the modest industry and trade
of the townsmen or burgesses had slowly developed. When Norse and Magyar
raids subsided, this extramural activity expanded, shops multiplied, and
mer- chants and craftsmen, once transient, became settled residents of
the town. In war, however, insecurity returned; and the extramural
population built a second wall, of wider circumference than the feudal
moat, to protect it- self, its shops, and its goods. The feudal baron or
bishop still owned and ruled this enlarged town as part of his domain;
but its growing population was increasingly commercial and secular,
fretted under feudal tolls and controls, and plotted to win municipal
liberty.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>638</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>Out of old political traditions and new administrative needs an
assembly of citizens and a corps of officials took form; and more and
more this “commune”— the body politic — regulated the affairs of the
city — the body geographical. Towards the end of the eleventh century
the merchant lead- ers began to demand from the feudal overlords
charters of communal free- dom for the towns. With characteristic
shrewdness they played one overlord against the other — baron against
bishop, knight against baron, king against any of them or all. The
townsmen used diverse means to achieve municipal freedom: they took a
solemn oath to refuse and resist baronial or episcopal tolls or taxes;
they offered the lord a flat sum, or an annuity, for a charter; on the
royal domain they won autonomy by money grants, or services in war;
sometimes they bluntly announced their independence, and fought a
violent revolution. Tours fought twelve times before its liberty was
won. Lords in need or debt, especially in preparing for a crusade, sold
charters of self-government to the towns that they held in fief; many
English cities in this way won their local autonomy from Richard I. Some
lords, above all in Flanders, granted charters of incomplete freedom to
cities whose com- mercial development enhanced baronial revenues. The
abbots and bishops resisted longest, for their consecration oath bound
them not to lower the income of their abbeys or sees — by which their
many ministrations were financed; hence the struggle of the towns
against their ecclesiastical owners was most bitter and prolonged.</p>
<p>The Spanish kings favored the communes as foils to a troublesome
nobil- ity, and the royal charters were many and liberal. Leon received
its charter from the king of Castile in 1020, Burgos in 1073, Najera in
1076, Toledo in 1085; and Compostela, Cadiz, Valencia, Barcelona soon
followed. In Ger- many feudalism, in Italy the cities, profited from the
mutual exhaustion of Empire and papacy in the war of investitures and
other conflicts between Church and state. In northern Italy the cities
attained a political vigor hardly known before or since. As the Alpine
streams fed the great rivers of Lom- bardy and Tuscany, and these
accommodated commerce and fertilized the plains, so the commerce of
transalpine Europe and western Asia, meeting in northern Italy,
generated there a mercantile bourgeoisie whose wealth re- built old
cities, raised up new ones, financed literature and art, and proudly
cast off feudal bonds. The nobility from their castles in the
countryside fought a losing war against the communal movement; yielding,
they took up residence in the city, and swore loyalty to the commune.
The bishops, who for centuries had been the real and able governors of
the Lombard towns, were subdued with the help of the popes, whose
authority they had long ig nored. In 1080 we hear of “consuls” governing
Lucca; in 1084 we find them at Pisa, in 1098 at Arezzo, in 1099 at
Genoa, in 1105 at Pavia, in 1138 at Florence. The cities of northern
Italy continued till the fifteenth century to acknowledge the formal
sovereignty of the Empire, and indited</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 639</p>
<p>their state papers in its name; 97 but in practice and effect they
were free; and the ancient regime of city-state was revived, with all
its chaos and stimulus.</p>
<p>In France the enfranchisement of the cities involved a long and often
vio- lent struggle. At Le Mans (1069), Cambrai (1076), and Reims (1 139)
the ruling bishops, by excommunication or force, succeeded in
suppressing the communes set up by the citizens; at Noyon, however, the
bishop of his own accord gave a charter to the town (1 108). St. Quentin
freed itself in 1080, Beauvais in 1099, Marseille in 1 100, Amiens in 1
1 13. At Laon in 1 1 15 the citizens took advantage of their corrupt
bishop’s absence to est ablish a com- mune; on his return he was bribed
to take oath to protect it; a year later he induced King Louis VI to
suppress it. In the monk Guibert of Nogent’s ac - count of what followed
we sample the intensity of the communal revolution:</p>
<p>On the fifth day of Easter week . . . there arose a disorderly
noise</p>
<p>throughout the city, men shouting “Commune!” . . . Citizens now</p>
<p>entered the bishop’s court with swords, battle -axes, bows, hatchets,
clubs, and spears, a very great company. . . . The nobles rallied from
all sides to the bishop. . . . He, with some helpers, fought them
off</p>
<p>with stones and arrows He hid himself in a cask . . . and
piteously</p>
<p>implored them, promising that he would cease to be their bishop,</p>
<p>would give them unlimited riches, and would leave the country. And as
they with hardened hearts jeered at him, one named Bernard, lift- ing
his battle-ax, brutally dashed out the brains of that sacred, though
sinner’s, head; and he, slipping between the hands of those who held
him, was dead before he reached the ground, stricken by another</p>
<p>blow under the eye-sockets and across the nose. There brought to his
end, his legs were cut off, and many another wound inflicted. Thibaut,
seeing a ring on the Bishop’s finger, and not being able to draw it off,
cut off the finger. 08</p>
<p>The cathedral was fired, and was razed to the ground. Thinking to
take two steps at once, the pillagers began to sack and burn the
mansions of the aris- tocracy. A royal army stormed the city, and joined
nobles and clergy in massacring the population. The commune was
suppressed. Fourteen years later it was restored; and the citizens
labored with pious enthusiasm to re- build the cathedral that they or
their fathers had destroyed.</p>
<p>The struggle continued for a century. At Vezelay ( 1 106) the people
killed Abbot Arnaud and set up a commune. Orleans rose in 1137, but
failed. Louis VII granted Sens a charter in 1 146, but revoked it three
years later on peti- tion of the abbot within whose domains the city
lay; the populace killed the abbot and his nephew, but failed to
re-establish the commune. The bishop of Tournai fought a civil war for
six years ( 1 190-6) to overthrow the com- mune; the pope excommunicated
all the citizens. On Easter Sunday of 1194 the people of Rouen sacked
the houses of the cathedral canons; in 1207 the city was put under a
papal interdict. In 1235 at Reims the stones brought</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>640</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>into the city to rebuild the cathedral were seized by the populace
and were used for missiles and barricades in a revolt against the
highest ecclesiastic in Gaul; he and his canons fled, and did not return
until two years later, when the pope induced Louis VII to abolish the
commune. Many cities of France never succeeded, till the Revolution, in
establishing their freedom; but in north France most of the cities were
freed between 1080 and 1200, and, under the stimulus of liberty, entered
upon their greatest age. It was the communes that built the Gothic
cathedrals.</p>
<p>In England the kings won the support of the cities against the
nobility by granting them charters of limited self-government. William
the Conqueror gave such a charter to London; similar charters were
yielded by Henry II to Lincoln, Durham, Carlisle, Bristol, Oxford,
Salisbury, and Southampton; and in 1 20 1 Cambridge bought its communal
rights from King John. In Flan- ders the ruling counts made substantial
concessions to Ghent, Bruges, Douai, Tournai, Lille . . . but overcame
all attempts at complete municipal inde- pendence. Leyden, Haarlem,
Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Delft, and other Dutch cities obtained charters of
local autonomy in the thirteenth century. In Ger- many the liberation
was long drawn out, and mostly peaceful; the bishops, who had for
centuries ruled the cities as feudatories of the emperors, yielded to
Cologne, Trier, Metz, Mainz, Speyer, Strasbourg, Worms, and other cities
the right to select their own magistrates and make their own laws.</p>
<p>By the end of the twelfth century the communal revolution was won in
western Europe. The cities, though seldom completely free, had thrown
off their feudal masters, ended or reduced feudal tolls, and severely
limited ecclesiastical rights. The Flemish cities forbade the
establishment of new monasteries, and the bequest of land to churches;
they restricted the right of the clergy to be tried by episcopal courts,
and contested clerical control of primary schools.“ The mercantile
bourgeoisie now dominated municipal and economic life. In nearly all the
communes the merchant guilds were recognized as self-governing bodies;
in some cases the commune and the merchant guild were identical
organizations; usually the two were distinct, but the commune rarely
contravened the interests of the guilds. The lord mayor of London was
chosen by the city guilds. Now, for the first time in a thousand years,
the possession of money became again a greater power than the possession
of land; nobility and clergy were challenged by a rising plutocracy.
Even more than in antiquity the mercantile bourgeoisie turned its
wealth, energy, and ability to political advantage. In most cities it
elimi- nated the poor from assemblies or offices. It oppressed the
manual worker and the peasant, monopolized the profits of commerce,
taxed the commu- nity heavily, and spent much of the revenue in internal
strife, or in external wars to capture markets and destroy competitors.
It tried to suppress artisan associations, and refused them the right to
strike, under penalty of exile or death. Its regulation of prices and
wages aimed at its own good, to the serious</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 641</p>
<p>detriment of the working class. 100 As in the French Revolution, the
defeat of the feudal lords was a victory chiefly for the business
class.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the communes were a magnificent reassertion of human
lib- erty. At the call of the bell from the town campanile, the citizens
flocked to assemble, and chose their municipal officers. The cities
formed their own communal militia, defended themselves lustily, defeated
the trained troops of the German emperor at Legnano (1176), and fought
one another to mu- tual exhaustion. Though the administrative councils
soon narrowed their membership to a mercantile aristocracy, the
municipal assemblies were the first representative government since
Tiberius; they, rather than Magna Carta, were the chief parent of modern
democracy. 101 The atavistic relics of feudal or tribal law —
compurgations, duels, ordeals — were replaced by the legal and orderly
examination of witnesses; the wergild or blood price gave way to fines,
imprisonment, or corporal punishment; the law’s delays were reduced,
legal contracts replaced feudal status and loyalties, and a whole new
body of business law created a new order in European life.</p>
<p>The young democracy leaped at once to a semisocialistic state-managed
economy. The commune minted its own currency, ordered and supervised
public works, built roads, bridges, and canals, paved some city streets,
or- ganized the food supply, forbade forestalling, engrossing, or
regrading, brought seller and buyer into direct contact at markets and
fairs, examined weights and measures, inspected commodities, punished
adulteration, con- trolled exports and imports, stored grain for lean
years, provided grain at fair prices in emergencies, and regulated the
prices of essential foods and beer. When it found that a price set too
low discouraged the production of a desirable commodity, it allowed
certain wholesale prices to seek their own level through competition,
but established courts or “assizes” of bread and ale to keep the retail
price of these necessities in constant relation with the cost of wheat
or barley. 102 Periodically it published a list of fair prices. It
assumed that for every commodity there must be a “just price,” combining
costs of materials and labor; the theory ignored supply and demand, and
fluctuations in the value of currency. Some communes, like Basel or
Genoa, assumed a monopoly of the trade in salt; others, like Nuremberg,
brewed their own beer, or stored corn in municipal granaries. 103 The
flow of goods was impeded by municipal protective tariffs; 104 and in
some cases by requir- ing transient merchants to expose their goods for
sale in the town before passing through. 105 As in our century, these
regulations were often circum- vented by the subtlety of refractory
citizens; “black markets” were numer - ous. 100 Many of these
restrictive ordinances brought more harm than good, and soon ceased to
be enforced.</p>
<p>But all in all, the work of the medieval communes did credit to the
skill and courage of the businessmen who managed them. Under their
leadership Europe experienced in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
such prosperity</p>
<p>642 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>as it had not known since the fall of Rome. Despite epidemics,
famines, and wars, the population of Europe swelled under the communal
system as not for a thousand years before. The population of Europe had
begun to de- cline in the second century, and had probably reached nadir
in the ninth century. From the eleventh century to the Black Death
(1349) it rose again with the resurrection of commerce and industry. In
the region between the Moselle and the Rhine it probably multiplied
tenfold; in France it may have reached 20,000,000 — hardly less than in
the eighteenth century. 107 The economic revolution involved a migration
from country to city almost as definite as in recent times.
Constantinople with 800,000, Cordova and Pa- lermo with half a million
each, had long been populous; but before 1100 only a few cities north of
the Alps had more than 3000 souls. 108 By 1 200 Paris had some 100,000;
Douai, Lille, Ypres, Ghent, Bruges, approximately 50,000 each; London
20,000. By 1300 Paris had 150,000, Venice, Milan, Florence</p>

</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>20.000, Frankfort, Basel, Hamburg, Norwich, York 10,000. Of course
all these figures are loose and hazardous estimates.</p>
<p>The growth of population was both a result and a cause of the
economic development: it came from improved protection of life and
property, better exploitation of natural resources through industry, and
the wider spread of food and goods through rising wealth and trade;
conversely it offered an expanding market to commerce and industry, to
literature, drama, music, and art. The competitive pride of the communes
turned their wealth into cathedrals, city halls, bell towers, fountains,
schools, and universities. Civi- lization crossed seas and mountains in
the wake of trade; from Islam and Byzantium it swept over Italy and
Spain, and marched over the Alps into Germany, France, Flanders, and
Britain. The Dark Ages became a mem- ory, and Europe was alive again
with lusty youth.</p>
<p>We must not idealize the medieval town. It was picturesque (to the
mod- ern eye) with castle-crowned hill and towered wall, with thatched
or tiled houses, cottages, and shop 9 crowding gregariously around
cathedral, castle or public square. But for the most part its streets
were narrow and tortuous alleys (ideal for defense and shade), where men
and beasts moved to the clatter of hoofs and words and wooden shoes, and
with the leisureliness of an age that had no machines to spare its
muscle and wear its nerves. Around maijy of the city dwellings were
gardens, chicken coops, pig pens, cow pas- tures, dunghills. London was
finicky and decreed that “he who will nourish a pig, let him keep it in
his own house”; elsewhere the swine rooted freely among the open garbage
piles. 111 Every now and then heavy rains swelled the rivers and flooded
fields and cities, so that men rowed boats into West- minster Palace.
112 After rain the streets would be muddy for days; men wore boots then,
and fine ladies were borne in carriages or chairs, undulating from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 643</p>
<p>hole to hole. In the thirteenth century some cities paved their main
streets with cobblestones; in most cities, however, the streets were
unpaved, unsafe for foot or nose. Monasteries and castles had good
drainage systems; 113 cot- tages usually had none. Here and there were
grassy or sandy squares, with a pump from which people might drink, and
a trough for passing animals.</p>
<p>North of the Alps houses were nearly all of wood; only the richest
nobles and merchants built of brick or stone. Fires were frequent, and
often swept unchecked through a town. In 1 1 88 Rouen, Beauvais, Arras,
Troyes, Pro- vins, Poitiers, and Moissac were all destroyed by fire;
Rouen was burned down six times between 1200 and 1225. 114 Tile roofs
became the custom only in the fourteenth century. Fire fighting was by
bucket brigades, heroic and incompetent. Watchmen were provided with a
long hook to pull down a burning house if it threatened other buildings.
Since all wished to live near the castle for security, buildings rose to
several stories, sometimes six; and the upper floors projected
charmingly and alarmingly over the street. Towns issued ordinances
limiting the height of buildings.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties — hardly felt because felt by nearly all —
life could be interesting in the medieval city. Markets were crowded,
talk was plenti- ful, dress and goods were colorful, pedlars cried their
wares, craftsmen plied their trades. Strolling players might be
performing a miracle or mystery play in the square; a religious
procession might pass down the street, with proud merchants and sturdy
workers marching, and gaudy floats and sol- emn vestments and stirring
song; some glorious church might be a-building; some pretty lass might
lean from a balcony; the town belfry might summon the citizens to
meeting or to arms. At sunset curfew rang, and bade all people hasten
home, for there were no lights in the streets except candles in win-
dows, and here and there a lamp before a shrine. A nocturnal burgher
would have his servants precede him with torches or lanterns and arms,
for police were rare. The wise citizen retired early, shunning the
tedium of illiterate evenings, and knowing that at dawn the noisy cocks
would crow, and work would clamor to be done.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>The growth of industry and commerce, the spread of a money economy,
and the rising demand for labor in the towns transformed the
agricultural regime. The municipalities, eager to get new “hands,”
announced that any person living in a town for 366 days without being
claimed, identified, and taken as a serf, became automatically free, and
would enjoy the protection of the commune’s laws and power. In 1106
Florence invited all the peasants of the surrounding villages to come
and live there as freemen. Bologna and</p>
<p>644 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>other towns paid feudal lords to let their serfs move into the city.
A large number of serfs escaped, or were invited, to open new lands east
of the Elbe, where they became automatically free.</p>
<p>Those who remained on the manor showed a troublesome resistance to
feudal dues long sanctioned by time. Emulating the town guilds, many
serfs formed rural associations — confreries, conjurations — and bound
themselves by oath to act together in refusing feudal dues. They stole
or destroyed seignorial charters that recorded their bondage or
obligations; they burned down the castles of obstinate seigneurs; they
threatened to abandon the do- main if their demands were not met. In
1100 the villeins of St. Michel-de- Beauvais announced that they would
thereafter marry any woman they pleased, and would give their daughters
to any man who pleased them. In 1 102 the serfs of St. Arnoul-de-Crepy
refused their abbot lord the tradi- tional heriot, or death due, or to
pay a fine for letting their daughters marry outside the domain. Similar
rebellions broke out in a dozen towns from Flanders to Spain. The feudal
lords found it increasingly difficult to make a profit out of serf
labor; rising resistance required costly superintendence at every turn;
villein labor in manorial shops proved more expensive, and less
competent, than the free labor that produced like goods in the
towns.</p>
<p>To keep the peasants on the land, and make their labor profitable to
him- self, the baron commuted the old feudal dues for money payments,
sold freedom to serfs who could pay for it with their savings, leased
more and more of the demesne to free peasants for a money rental, and
hired free labor for the workshops on his estate. Year by year,
following the lead of the Moslem and Byzantine East, western Europe,
from the eleventh to the thir- teenth century, passed from payments
predominantly in kind to payments predominantly in currency. Feudal
landlords, desiring the manufactured products that commerce laid before
their eyes, craved money with which to purchase them; going off to the
Crusades, they wanted money rather than food and goods; governments
demanded taxes in money, not in kind; the landlords yielded to the
course of events, and sold their products for cash instead of consuming
them by laborious migration from villa to villa. The change to a money
economy proved costly for the feudal landlords; the commutations and
rents they received acquired the fixity of medieval cus- tom, and could
not be raised as rapidly as the value of money fell. Many of the
aristocracy had to sell their land — usually to the rising bourgeoisie ;
some nobles, as early as 1250, died landless or destitute. 115 Early in
the fourteenth century King Philip the Fair of France freed the serfs on
the royal domain, and in 1 3 1 5 his son Louis X or dered the liberation
of all serfs “on fair and suitable conditions.” 116 Gradually, from the
twelfth to the sixteenth cen - tury, at different times in divers
countries west of the Elbe, serfdom gave place to peasant
proprietorship; the feudal manor broke up into small estates, and the
peasantry rose in the thirteenth century to a degree of freedom and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIv) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 645</p>
<p>prosperity that it had not known for a thousand years. The seignorial
courts lost their jurisdiction over the peasants, and the village
community elected its own officers, who swore allegiance not to the
local lord but only to the crown. The emancipation in western Europe was
not quite complete till 1789; many feudal lords still claimed the old
rights in law, and would try, in the fourteenth century, to restore them
in fact; but the movement toward free and mobile labor could not be
stopped so long as commerce and indus- try grew.</p>
<p>The new stimulus of freedom co-operated with an immense widening of
the agricultural market to improve the methods, tools, and products of
til- lage. The rising population of the towns, the increase of wealth,
the new facilities of finance and trade expanded and enriched the rural
economy. New industries created a demand for industrial crops — sugar
cane, aniseed, cumin, hemp, flax, vegetable oils, and dyes. The nearness
of populous towns promoted cattle raising, dairy farming, and market
gardening. From thou- sands of vineyards in the valleys of the Tiber,
the Arno, the Po, the Guadal- quivir, the Tagus, the Ebro, the Rhone,
the Gironde, the Garonne, the Loire, the Seine, the Moselle, the Meuse,
the Rhine, and the Danube wine flowed along the rivers and over land and
sea to console the toilers of Europe’s fields, workshops, and counting
rooms; even England, from the eleventh to the sixteenth century, made
wine. To feed the hungry towns, where fast days were numerous and meat
was costly, great fleets went out into the Baltic and North Seas to
bring in herring and other fish; Yarmouth owed its life to the herring
trade; the merchants of Liibeck acknowledged their debt to it by carving
herrings on their pews; 117 and honest Dutchmen ad- mitted that they had
“built upon herrings” the proud city of Amsterdam. 118</p>
<p>Agricultural technique slowly improved. The Christians learned from
the Arabs in Spain, Sicily, and the East; and the Benedictine and
Cistercian monks brought old Roman and new Italian tricks of farming,
breeding, and soil preservation to the countries north of the Alps. The
strip system was aban- doned in laying out new farms, and each farmer
was left to his own initiative and enterprise. In Flanders fields
reclaimed from swamps the peasants of the thirteenth century practiced a
three-field rotation of crops, in which the soil was used each year, but
was triennially replenished by fodder or legu- minous plants. Powerful
teams of oxen drew iron plowshares more deeply into the soil than
before. Most plows, however, were still ( 1 300) of wood; only a few
regions knew the use of manure; and wagon wheels were sel- dom shod with
iron tires. Cattle raising was difficult because of prolonged droughts;
but the thirteenth century saw the first experiments in the cross- ing
and acclimatization of breeds. Dairy farming was unprogressive; the
average cow in the thirteenth century gave little milk, and hardly a
pound of butter per week. (A well-bred cow now yields ten to thirty
pounds of butter per week.)</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>646</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>While their masters fought one another, the peasants of Europe fought
the greater battle, more heroic and unsung, of man against nature.
Between the eleventh and the thirteenth century the sea had thirty-five
times swept over barriers and across the Lowlands, creating new gulfs
and bays where once there had been land, and drowning 100,000 persons in
a century. From the eleventh to the fourteenth century the peasants of
these regions, under their princes and abbots, transported blocks of
stone from Scandinavia and Germany, and built the “Golden Wall” behind
which the Belgians and the Dutch have developed two of the most
civilized states in history. Thousands of acres were rescued from the
sea, and by the thirteenth century the Low- lands were latticed with
canals. From 1 179 to 1257 the Italians cut the fa- mous Naviglio
Grande, or Great Canal, between Lake Maggiore and the Po, fertilizing
86,485 acres of land. Between the Elbe and the Oder patient immigrants
from Flanders, Frisia, Saxony, and the Rhineland turned the marshy
Mooren into rich fields. The superabundant forests of France were
progressively cleared, and became the farms that through centuries of
po- litical turmoil have kept France fed. Perhaps it was this mass
heroism of clearance, drainage, irrigation, and cultivation, rather than
any victories of war or trade, that provided the foundation on which, in
final analysis, rest all the triumphs of European civilization in the
last 700 years.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE CLASS WAR</li>
</ol>
<p>In the early Middle Ages there had been only two classes in western
Europe: German conquerors and native conquered; by and large the later
aristocracies in England, France, Germany and northern Italy were de-
scendants of the conquerors, and remained conscious of this blood
relation- ship even amid their wars. In the eleventh century there were
three classes: the nobles, who fought; the clergy, who prayed; and the
peasants, who worked. The division became so traditional that most men
thought it or- dained by God; and most peasants, like most nobles,
assumed that a man should patiently continue in the class into which he
had been born.</p>
<p>The economic revolution of the twelfth century added a new class —
the burgesses or bourgeoisie — the bakers, merchants, and master
craftsmen of the towns. It did not yet include the professions. In
France the classes were called etats — estates or states — and the
bourgeoisie was reckoned as the tiers etat , or “third estate.” It
controlled municipal affairs, and won entry into the English Parliament,
the German Diet, the Spanish Cortes, and the States- General — the
rarely convened national parliament of France; but it had, be- fore the
eighteenth century, little influence on national policy. The nobles
continued to rule and administer the state, though they were now a minor
force in the cities. They lived in the country (except in Italy),
scorned city</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 647</p>
<p>dwellers and commerce, ostracized any of their class who married a
bour- geois, and were certain that an aristocracy of birth is the only
alternative to a plutocracy of business, or a theocracy of myths, or a
despotism of arms. Nevertheless the wealth that came from commerce and
industry began now to compete — and in the eighteenth century would
surpass — the wealth that came from the ownership of land.</p>
<p>The rich merchants fretted over aristocratic airs, and scorned and
ex- ploited the craftsman class. They lived in ornate mansions, bought
fine furniture, ate exotic foods, and garbed themselves in costly dress.
Their wives covered expanding forms with silks and furs, velvets and
jewelry; and Jeanne of Navarre, Queen of France, was piqued to find
herself welcomed into Bruges by 600 bourgeois ladies as gorgeously robed
as herself. The nobles complained, and demanded sumptuary laws to check
this insolent display; such laws were periodically passed; but as the
kings needed bour- geois support and funds, these laws were only
spasmodically enforced.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of urban population favored the bourgeois owners of
city realty; and the consequent unemployment made it easier to manage
the manual working class. The proletariat of servants, apprentices, and
jour- neymen had little education and no political power, and lived in a
poverty som etimes more dismal than the serf’s. A thirteenth -century
day laborer in England received some two pence per day — roughly
equivalent, in purchas- ing power, to two dollars in the United States
of America in 1948. A car- penter received four and one eighth pence
(.12) per day; a mason three and one eighth, an architect twelve pence
plus traveling expenses and occa- sional gifts. 110 Prices, however,
were commensurately low: in England in 1300 a pound of beef cost a
farthing (twenty-one cents); a fowl one penny (eighty-four cents); a
quarter of wheat five shillings nine and one half pence (7.90). 120 The
work day began at dawn and ended at dusk — sooner on the eve of Sunday
or a feast day. There were some thirty feast days in the year, but in
England probably not more than six exempted the people from toil. The
hours were a bit longer, the real wages no worse — some would say higher
121 — than in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century England.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the thirteenth century the class struggle became
class war. Every generation saw some revolt of the peasantry,
particularly in France. In 1251 the oppressed peasantry of France and
Flanders rose against their secular and ecclesiastical landlords.
Calling themselves Pastoureux (Shepherds), they formed a kind of
revolutionary crusade under the lead of an unlicensed preacher known as
“the Master of Hungary.” They marched from Flanders through Amiens to
Paris; discontented peasants and prole - takes joined them en route,
until they numbered over a hundred thousand men. They bore religious
banners, and proclaimed devotion to King Louis IX, then a prisoner of
the Moslems in Egypt; but they were ominously armed with clubs, daggers,
axes, pikes, and swords. They denounced the corrup-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>648</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>tion of government, the tyranny of the rich over the poor, the
covetous hypocrisy of priests and monks; and the populace cheered their
denunci- ations. They assumed the ecclesiastical rights of preaching,
granting abso- lution, and performing marriages, and slew some priests
who opposed them. Passing on to Orleans, they massacred scores of clergy
and university students. But there and at Bordeaux the police overcame
them; their leaders were captured and executed; and the wretched
survivors of the futile march were hunted like dogs and dispersed into
divers haunts of misery. Some escaped to England, and raised a minor
peasant uprising, which was in turn suppressed. 122</p>
<p>In the industrial towns of France the craft guilds rose in repeated
strikes or armed insurrection against the political and economic
monopoly and dic- tation of the merchant class. In Beauvais the mayor
and some bankers were manhandled by 1 500 rioters ( 1 2 3 3 ) . At Rouen
the textile workers rebelled against the merchant drapers, and killed
the mayor who intervened (1281). At Paris King Philip the Fair dissolved
the workers’ unions on the ground that they were plotting revolution
(1295, 1307). Nevertheless the craft guilds won admission to the
municipal assemblies and magistracies at Mar- seille (1213), Avignon,
Arles (1225), Amiens, Montpellier, Nimes. . . . Sometimes a member of
the clergy would side with the rebels, and give them slogans. “All
riches,” said a thirteenth -century bishop, “come from theft; every rich
man is a thief or the heir of a thief.” 123 Similar revolts disordered
the Flanders towns. Despite the penalty of death or banishment for
strike leaders, the coppersmiths of Dinant rose in 1255, the weavers of
Tournai in 1281, of all Ghent in 1274, of Hainault in 1292. The workers
of Ypres, Douai, Ghent, Lille, and Bruges joined in revolt in 1 302,
defeated a French army at Courtrai, won the admission of their
representatives to communal councils and offices, and revoked the
oppressive legislation with which the mercantile oligarchy had harassed
the crafts. Acquiring power for a time, the weavers sought to fix — even
to reduce — the wages of the fullers, who then allied themselves with
the merchant rich. 124</p>
<p>t In 1 19 1 the merchant guilds won control of London; soon afterward
they offered King John an annual payment if he would suppress the
weavers’ guild; John complied (1200). 123 In 1194 one William Fitzobert
or Long- beard preached to the poor of London the need of a revolution.
Thousands listened to him eagerly. Two burgesses sought to kill him; he
fled into a church, was forced out by smoke, and committed hara-kiri
almost by the Japanese ritual. His followers worshiped him as a martyr,
and kept as sacred the soil that had received his blood. 120 The
popularity of Robin Hood, who robbed great lords and prelates but was
kind to the poor, suggests the class feeling in twelfth-century
Britain.</p>
<p>The bitterest conflicts took place in Italy. At first the workers
joined</p>
<p>with the merchant guilds in a series of bloody insurrections against
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) THE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION 649</p>
<p>nobles; by the end of the thirteenth century this struggle was won.
For a time the industrial population shared in the government of
Florence. Soon, however, the great merchants and entrepreneurs secured
ascendancy in the city council, and imposed such arduous and arbitrary
rules upon their em- ployees that the struggle entered, in the
fourteenth century, its second phase — sporadic and intermittent war
between the rich industrialists and the work- ers in the factories. It
was amid these scenes of civil strife that St. Francis preached the
gospel of poverty, and reminded the nouveaux riches that Christ had
never had any private property. 127</p>
<p>The communes, like the guilds, declined in the fourteenth century
through the expansion of a municipal into a national economy and market,
in which their rules and monopolies obstructed the development of
invention, in- dustry, and trade. They suffered further through their
chaotic internal strife, their ruthless exploitation of the surrounding
countryside, their nar- row municipal patriotism, their conflicting
policies and currencies, their petty wars upon one another in Flanders
and Italy, and their inability to organize themselves into an autonomous
confederation that might have sur- vived the growth of the royal power.
After 1300 several French communes petitioned the king to assume their
governance.</p>
<p>Even so the economic revolution of the thirteenth century was the
making of modern Europe. It eventually destroyed a feudalism that had
completed the function of agricultural protection and organization, and
had become an obstacle to the expansion of enterprise. It transformed
the immobile wealth of feudalism into the fluent resources of a
world-wide economy. It provided the machinery for a progressive
development of business and industry, which substantially increased the
power, comforts, and knowledge of European man. It brought a prosperity
that in two centuries could build a hundred cathedrals, any one of which
presumes an amazing abundance and variety of means and skills. Its
production for an extending market made possible the national economic
systems that underlay the growth of the modern states. Even the class
war that it let loose may have been an added stimulant to the minds and
energies of men. When the storm of the transition had subsided, the
economic and political structure of Europe had been trans- formed. A
flowing tide of industrv and commerce washed away deep-rooted
impediments to human development, and carried men onward from the
scattered glory of the cathedrals to the universal frenzy of the
Renaissance.</p>
