Burgundy</h4>
<p>i 3 6 3 - i 5 i 5</p>
<p>I. THE ROYAL DUKES</p>
<p>B Y its position on the eastern flank of France around Dijon, and by
the subtle statesmanship of its dukes, Burgundy emerged with little harm
from the Hundred Years’ War, and became for half a century the brightest
spot in transalpine Christendom. When the Burgundian ducal family of the
Capetian line became extinct, and the duchy reverted to the French
Crown, John II gave it to his fourth son Philip (1363) as a reward for
valor at Poitiers. During his forty-one years as Duke of Burgundy,
Philip the Bold (Philippe le Hardi) managed so well, and married so
diplomatically, that Hainaut, Flanders, Artois, and Franche-Comte came
under his rule; and the duchy of Burgundy, technically a province of
France, became in effect an independent state, enriched by Flemish
commerce and industry, and graced by the patronage of art.</p>
<p>John the Fearless ( Jean sans Peur ), by a fine web of alliances and
in- trigues, stretched his power to the bursting point, and France felt
challenged to resist. Louis, Duke of Orleans, ruling France for his mad
brother Charles VI, allied France with the Holy Roman Empire in a plan
to check the un- wisely fearless Duke. J ohn’s hired assassins killed
him; violent strife ensued between the Burgundian party and the
Armagnacs — followers of Louis’ father-in-law the Count of Armagnac —
for the control of French policy; and John in turn died under an
assassin s knife (1419). His son Philip the Good renounced all feudal
allegiance to France, allied Burgundy with Eng- land, and annexed
Tournai, Namur, Brabant, Holland, Zeeland, Limburg, and Louvain. When he
made his peace with France (1435) he exacted the recognition of his du
chy’s practical sovereignty, and the cession of Luxem - bourg, Liege,
Cambrai, and Utrecht. Burgundy was now at its zenith, rival- ing in
wealth and power any kingdom in the West.</p>
<p>Philip might not win from tender minds his title “the Good.” He was
not above chicanery and cruelty and unmannerly flares of wrath. But he
was a devoted son, an excellent administrator, and a fond father even to
his sixteen illegitimate offspring. He loved women royally, had
twenty-four mistresses, prayed and fasted, gave alms, and made his
capitals — Dijon, Bruges, and</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>EPISODE IN BURGUNDY</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>”7</p>
<p>Ghent — the art foci of the Western world outside of Italy. His long
rult brought to Burgundy and its provinces such affluence that few of
his sub- jects made any fuss about his sins. The Flemish towns fretted
under his mastery, and mourned to see their old guild organization and
communal liberties yielding to a national economy under a centralized
government. Philip and his son Charles suppressed their revolts but
allowed them a con- ciliatory peace, for they knew that from the
industry and commerce of these cities came the richest ducal revenues.
Before Philip the regions of the lower Rhine had been fragments, as
diverse in institutions and policies as in race and speech; he bound
them into a unified state, gave them order, and sec- onded their
prosperity.</p>
<p>Burgundian society at Bruges, Ghent, Liege, Louvain, Brussels, and
Dijon was now (1420-60) the most polished and amorous in Europe, not
except- ing the contemporary Florence of Cosimo de’ Medici. The dukes
preserved all the forms of chivalry; it was Philip the Good who founded
the Order of the Golden Fleece ( 1429) ; and it was in part from her
Burgundian allies that England took the chivalric pomp and glamour that
brightened the rough surface of English manners, glorified the campaigns
of Henry V, and shone in the pages of Froissart and Malory. The
Burgundian nobles, shorn of in- dependent power, lived chiefly as
courtiers, and developed all the graces of dress and bearing that could
adorn parasitism and adultery. 1 Merchants and manufacturers robed
themselves like royalty, and fed and gowned their wives as if preparing
the scene for Rubens. Under so loving a duke monog- amy would have been
lese-majeste. John of Heinsberg, the jolly Bishop of Liege, spawned a
dozen bastards; John of Burgundy, Bishop of Cambrai, had thirty-six
children and grandchildren begotten out of wedlock; many of the elite,
in this eugenic age, were so born. 2 Prostitutes could be found at al-
most any time and price at the public baths. At Louvain they pretended
to be landladies, offering accommodations for students. 8 Festivals were
many and extravagant; famous artists were engaged to design the pageants
and decorate the floats; and people came over frontiers and seas to view
gorgeous spec- tacles in which nude women played the part of ancient
goddesses and nymphs. 4</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE RELIGIOUS SPIRIT</li>
</ol>
<p>In somber contrast with this effervescent society were the saints and
mystics who, under these dukes, gave Holland a high place in religious
his- tory. Jan van Ruysbroeck, a Brussels priest, retired at fifty
(1343) to an Augustinian monastery at Groenendael, near Waterloo, where
he devoted himself to mystical contemplation and compositions. He
professed that the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>Holy Spirit guided his pen; nevertheless his pantheism verged upon a
denial of individual immortality.</p>
<p>God Himself is swallowed up with all the blessed in an absence of</p>
<p>modes… an eternal loss of self…. The seventh degree is attained</p>
<p>when, beyond all knowledge or all knowing, we discover in ourselves a
bottomless not-knowing; when, beyond all names given to God or to
creatures, we come to expire, and pass over in eternal namelessness,
where we lose ourselves… and contemplate all these blessed spirits which
are essentially sunken away, merged and lost in their super-</p>
<p>essence, in an unknown darkness without mode.®</p>
<p>The Netherlands # and Rhenish Germany saw in this period a profusion
of lay groups — Beghards, Beguines, Brethren of the Free Spirit — whose
mys- tic raptures led often to piety, social service, quietism, and
pacifism, some- times to a rejection of the sacraments as unnecessary,
and occasionally to a cheerful acceptance of sin as quite swallowed up
in union with God. 8 Gerrit (Geert, Gerard) Groote of Deventer, after
receiving a good education at Cologne, Paris, and Prague, spent many
days with Ruysbroeck at Groen- endael, and was moved to make the love of
God the pervading motive of his life. Having received deacon’s orders
(1379), he began to preach in the towns of Holland, in the vernacular,
to audiences so large that the local churches could not hold them;
people left their shops and meals to hear him. Scrupulously orthodox in
doctrine, and himself a “hammer of heretics,” he nevertheless attacked
the moral laxity of priests as well as of laymen, and demanded that
Christians should live strictly in accord with the ethics of Christ. He
was denounced as a heretic, and the bishop of Utrecht withdrew from all
deacons the right to pr each. One of Groote’s followers, Floris
Radewijnszoon, drew up a semi-monastic, semi-communistic rule for the
“Brethren of the Common Life,” who lived in a Fraterhuis at Deventer
with Groote at their head, and — without taking monastic vows — occupied
them- selves with manual labor, teaching, religious devotions, and
copying manu- scripts. Groote died at forty-four (1384) of a pestilence
contracted while nursing a friend, but his Brotherhood spread its
influence through 200 Fraterhuizen in Holland and Germany. The schools
of the Brotherhood gave the pagan classics a prominent place in their
curriculum, preparing the way for the Jesuit schools that took over
their work in the Counter Refor- mation. The Brethren welcomed printing
soon after its appearance, and used it to disseminate their moderna
devotio. Alexander Hegius at Deventer (1475-98) was a memorable example
of the type that fortunate students have known — the saintly teacher who
lives only for the instruction and moral</p>

original sense as approxi - mately embracing both modem Belgium and
Holland.</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) EPISODE IN BURGUNDY I29</p>
<p>guidance of his pupils. He improved the curriculum, centered it
around the classics, and won the praise of Erasmus for the purity of his
Latin style. When he died he left nothing but his clothes and his books;
everything else he had secretly given to the poor. 7 Among the famous
pupils of Deventer were Nicholas of Cusa, Erasmus, Rudolf Agricola, Jean
de Gerson, and the author of The Imitation of Christ.</p>
<p>We are not sure who wrote this exquisite manual of humility. Probably
it was Thomas Hamerken of Kempen in Prussia. In the quiet of his cell in
the monastery of Mt. St. Agnes near Zwolle, Thomas a Kempis (1380-1471)
gathered from the Bible, the Fathers of the Church, and St. Bernard
passages expounding the ideal of unworldly piety as conceived by
Ruysbroeck and Groote, and rephrased them in simple mellifluous
Latin.</p>
<p>What will it avail thee to be engaged in profound discussions of
the</p>
<p>Trinity, if thou be void of humility, and art thereby displeasing to
the Trinity? Truly, sublime words do not make a man holy and just,
but</p>
<p>a virtuous life maketh him dear to God. I had rather feel compunction
than know how to define it. If thou knewest the whole Bible by heart,
and the sayings of all the philosophers, what would it profit thee with-
out the love of God, and without grace? Vanity of vanities, and all is
vanity, except to love God, and Him only to serve. This is the highest
wisdom, by contempt of the world to tend toward the Kingdom of</p>
<p>Heaven Yet learning is not to be blamed… for that is good in it-</p>
<p>self and ordained by God, but a good conscience and a virtuous
life</p>
<p>are always to be preferred</p>
<p>He is truly great who hath great love. He is truly great that is
little</p>
<p>in his own eyes, and that maketh no account of any height of
honor.</p>
<p>He is truly wise who casteth aside all earthly things as dung, that
he may win Christ. ;..</p>
<p>Fly the tumult of men as much as thou canst, for the treating of</p>
<p>worldly affairs is a great hindrance…. Truly it is misery to live
on</p>
<p>he earth. — It is a great matter to live in obedience, to be under
a</p>
<p>superior, and not to be at our own disposing. It is much safer to
obey than to govern…. The cell, constantly dwelt in, groweth sweet.
8</p>
<p>There is a gentle eloquence in the Imitation that echoes the profound
sim- plicity of Christ s sermons and parables. It is an ever needed
check on the intellectual pride of frail reason and shallow
sophistication. When we are weary of facing our responsibilities in life
we shall find no better refuge than Thomas a Kempis’ Fifth Gospel. But
who shall teach us how to be Christians in the stream and storm of the
world?</p>
<p>I 3°</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>HI. SPARKLING BURGUNDY: 1363-1465</p>
<p>Despite such deprecating Thomases, the provinces under Burgundian
rule indulged in considerable intellectual activity. The dukes
themselves — Philip the Good above the rest — collected libraries and
encouraged literature and art. Schools multiplied, and the University of
Louvain, founded in 1426, wa soon among the leading educational centers
of Europe. Georges Castellain’ Cloronique des dues de Bourgogne recorded
the history of the duchy with rhetorical effulgence and a minimum of
philosophy, but in a vigorous French that shared with Froissart and
Comines in forming that favorite medium of clear and graceful prose.
Private groups organized Chambers of Rhetoric ( Rederijkers ) for
contests in oratory and poetry and the performance of plays. The two
languages of the realm — the French or Romance of the Wal- loons in the
south and the German dialects of the Flemings and Dutch in the north —
rivaled each other in producing poets who repose in the peace of
oblivion.</p>
<p>The supreme expression of the duchy was in art. Antwerp began in 1352
its vast, many-aisled cathedral, and finished it in 1518; Louvain raised
the beautifully proportioned St. Pierre — another casualty of the second
World War. Men and cities were so rich that they could afford mansions
or town halls almost as magnificent as the churches that they conceded
to God. The bishops who governed Liege housed themselves and their
administrative staff in the largest and most elegant palace in the
Lowlands. Ghent built its guild- hall in 1325, Brussels its town hall in
1410-55, Louvain in 1448-63; Bruges added its hotel de ville in 1
377-142 1, and crowned it with a world-famous belfry ( 1393-96) that
served as a landmark to mariners far out at sea. While these noble
Gothic structures expressed the pride of cities and merchants, the dukes
and aristocracy of Burgundy financed for their palaces and tombs a
brilliant outburst of sculpture, painting, and manuscript illumination.
Flem- ish artists, frightened from France by war, flocked back to their
own cities. Philip the Bold gathered a veritable pleiad of geniuses to
adorn his summer residence at the Chartreuse de Champmol — a Carthusian
monastery in the “gentle field” adjoining Dijon.</p>
<p>In 1 386 Philip commissioned Jean de Marville to design for him an
elabo- rate mausoleum in the Chartreuse. When Marville died ( 1389)
Claus Sluter of Holland continued the work; when Sluter died ( 1406) his
pupil Claus de Werve carried on; at last (141 1) the tomb was completed,
and received the bones of the Duke, now seven years dead. In 1793 a
revolutionary assembly at Dijon ordered the dismantling of the great
sepulcher, and its components were scattered or destroyed. In 1827 the
communal fathers, breathing a re- verse political breeze, collected the
remaining pieces, and housed them in</p>
<p>CHAP. VI)</p>
<p>EPISODE IN BURGUNDY</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>he Dijon Museum. The Duke and his Duchess, Marguerite of Flanders,
lie in handsome alabaster on a massive marble slab; and below them forty
pleurant figures — sole survivors of the ninety carved — mourn the ducal
death in silent and graceful grief. For the portal of the chapel at the
Chartreuse, Sluter and his pupils (1391-94) chiseled out five superb
figures: the Virgin receiving the homage of Philip and Marguerite,
presented to her by John the Baptist and St. Catherine of Alexandria. In
the courtyard Sluter set up his master work, the Puits de Mo’ise, Well
of Moses: a pedestal bearing statues of Moses, David, Jeremiah,
Zachariah, Isaiah, and Daniel, originally surmounted by a “calvary” or
crucifixion scene, of which not hing remains but a somber, noble head of
Christ crowned with thorns. No sculpture of such masculine power and
unique audacity had been seen in Europe since the best days of Roman
art.</p>
<p>The painters formed as remarkable a dynasty as the sculptors. The
minia- turists still found patrons: Count William of Hainaut paid well
for the illu- mination of Les tres belles heures de Notre Dame (
c. 1414);* and the unknown genius (perhaps Hubert van Eyck) set a model
and pace for a thou- sand Lowland landscape artists by depicting with
microscopic zeal a port with ships beached or in full sail, passengers
disembarking, sailors and long- shoremen at their diverse tasks, waves
breaking on a crescent shore, white clouds moving stealthily across the
sky — all in the space of a picture card. In 1392 Melchior Broederlam of
Ypres brightened the Chartreuse de Champmol with the oldest significant
panel extant outside of Italy. But Broederlam and the artists who
painted the walls and statuary of the monas- tery used traditional
tempera — mixing their colors with some gelatinous ma- terial. Nuances
of shading and tint, and translucency of tone, were hardly attainable by
these means, and moisture could ruin the finished work. As early as 1329
Jacques Compere of Ghent had experimented with colors mixed in oil.
Through a hundred years of trial and error the Flemings de- veloped the
new technique; and in the first quarter of the fifteenth century it
revolutionized pictorial art. When Hubert van Eyck and his younger
brother Jan painted The Adoration of the Lamb for the cathedral of
St. Bavon at Ghent, they not only established the superiority of oil as
a vehicle of color; they produced one of the supreme masterpieces in the
history of painting, for whose sake St. Bavon has been a goal of
pilgrimage ever since.</p>
<p>In form this greatest of fifteenth-century paintings — this “pivot of
the history of the art,” Goethe called it 9 — is a folding polyptych of
six panels, painted on wood, with twelve pictures on each side; opened,
it is eleven feet high, fourteen feet wide. In the center of the lower
row is an imaginary countryside, with a city</p>
<p>Also known as Les heures de Turin. Some of these miniatures were
destroyed in the fire of the Biblioteca Nazionale of Turin in 1904; but
photographic reproductions of these remain, %nd several originals
survive in Turin’s Museo</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>of majestic towers — the Heavenly Jerusalem — rising in the distance
beyond the hills; in the foreground a well of the Water of Life; farther
back an altar whereon a lamb symbolizing Christ pours out its
sacrificial blood, while patriarchs and prophets, Apostles and martyrs,
angels and saints, gather around in rapt adora- tion. In the upper
center a throned figure, looking like some benevolent Semitic
Charlemagne, is designated as God the Father — a naturally inadequate
representa- tion of deity, but a noble conception of a wise ruler and
just judge. It is surpassed, in this painting, by only one figure — the
Virgin, a soft-featured, blond Teutonic type not so much of beauty as of
purity and modesty; the Sistine Madonna is less nobly conceived. On
Mary’s left is a group of angels; at the extreme left a naked Adam, thin
and sad, “remembering in misery a happy time.” To the right of God the
Father is John the Baptist, very sumptuously robed for a shepherd
preaching in the wilderness. At the extreme right stands a naked Eve,
somber and hardly fair, mourning paradise lost; she for a time, like
Adam at the other end, shocked a chilly Flanders unaccustomed to the
nude in life or art. Above her, Cain slays his brother as a symbolic
prelude to history.</p>
<p>The reverse of the polyptych declines from the exalted type of the
inner panels. In the middle row an angel at the left and Mary at the
right, separated by a room, picture the Annunciation — the faces
stereotyped, the hands remarkably fine, the draperies as lovely as any
in Flemish painting. At the bottom is a Latin poem of four lines; some
words have been worn out by the centuries; the rest reads: “Hubertus van
Eyck, great and skilled beyond any other, bega n the heavy task, and
Johannes, second in art… encouraged by the bequest of Jodocus Vyd. This
verse on the sixth of May calls you to behold the finished work”; and in
the</p>
<p>Perhaps there is in this epochal picture an undue profusion of
figures and minutiae: every man, woman, angel, flower, branch, blossom,
beast, stone, and gem is reproduced with heroic patience and fidelity —
to the amusement of Mi- chelangelo, who saw in Flemish realism a
sacrifice of central significance to incidental and irrelevant detail.
11 But nothing in contemporary Italy rivaled this painting in scope,
conception, or effect; and in later pictorial art only the Sistine
Chapel ceiling of Michelangelo surpasses it, and the Vatican frescoes of
Raphael, and probably Leonardo’s Last Supper before it began its long
decay. Even in its own day all literate Europe talked of the Adoration.
Alfonso the Magnanimous pleaded with Jan van Eyck to come to Naples and
paint for him such men and</p>
<ul>
<li>The Adoration of the Lamb has survived many restorations and
vicissitudes. It was retouched in 1550, 1663, 1825, 1829, 1859, 1936,
1951. The major pordons were removed by the French Revolutionary Army to
Paris in 1794, and were returned in 1816. The wings (without Adam and
Eve) were sold to an art dealer (1816), were bought by the Berlin Museum
(1821), and were restored to Ghent by the Treaty of Versailles (1919).
In the second World War the polyptych was removed to France for
protection; in 1942 it was taken by the Germans; in 1944 it was hidden
in Austrian salt mines; in 1946 it was restored to its chapel in the
church of St. Bavon by the Army of the United States. 10</li>

<p>women, with golden hair, as sang in this picture but were so rare in

<p>Hubert van Eyck moves out of our ken after 1432,* but we can vaguely
follow Jan through a prosperous career. Philip the Good made him varlet
de chotmbre (then a position of much dignity and affluence), and sent
him abroad with embassies as a jewel from the Burgundian crown. Some
twenty- four extant paintings are ascribed to him, and nearly every one
is a chef- d’oeuvre. Dresd en has a Virgin and Child second only to the
Adoration in the Van Eyck production; Berlin boasts The Man with the
Fink — a dour face strangely incongruous with the fondled flower;
Melbourne has the bril- liantly colored “Ince Hall Madonna” hardly nine
i nches by six, yet valued at 50,000; Bruges treasures The Madonna with
Canon van der Paele — the Virgin lovely from her flowing hair to the hem
of her marvelously wrinkled gown, the Canon fat and bald and
good-natured, one of the great portraits of the fifteenth century;
London shows the newlyweds Giovanni Arnolfini and his spouse in an
interior sparkling with mirror and chandelier; the Frick Collection in
New York has recently acquired, at unstated but enormous cost, a richly
colored Virgin and Child with Sts. Bar birr a and Elizabeth; Washington
has an Annunciation remarkable for its illusion of spatial depth, and
for the splendor of Gabriel’s raiment, which steals the scene from Mary;
and the Louvre owns The Madonna with Chancellor Rolin , with a
fascinating landscape of winding river, crowded bridge, tow- ered city,
flowered gardens, and a range of hills rising to greet the sun. In all
of these, besides their full-bodied colors, there is a resolve to
picture the donors as they were and looked, to reveal on a face the life
its owner had led, the thoughts and feelings that through the years had
formed the features into a confession of character. In such portraits
the medieval spirit of ideali- zation is set aside, and a modern
naturalism — perhaps reflecting middle-class secularism — is in full
swing.</p>
<p>Many other painters reached renown in that fertile land and age:
Petrus Christus, Jacques Daret, Robert Campin (“the Master of
Flemalle”). We bow to them humbly and pass on to Campin’s pupil Roger de
la Pasture. By the age of twenty-seven Roger had made such a name for
himself in his native Tournai that it gave him twice the three measures
or casks of wine that it had voted to Jan van Eyck. Nevertheless he
accepted an invitation to be official painter for Brussels, and
thenceforth gave his name the Flemish form Rogier van der Weyden. In
1450, aged fifty-one, he went to Rome for the jubilee, met Italian
painters, and was feted as a world celebrity; possibly</p>
<p>• Uncertainly attributed to him are five paintings: an Annunciation
(New York) ; The Three Maries at the Sepulcher (Vierhouten, van
Beuningen Collection); a small Madonna in Frankfurt; and two wings of an
altarpiece (New York), representing the Crucifixion and the Last
Judgment with almost Boschian diablerie.</p>
<p>134 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. VI</p>
<p>oil painting in Italy was advanced by his influence. When he died at
Brussels in 1464 he was the most widely renowned artist in all
Europe.</p>
<p>He is preserved in quantity. He too painted Philip the Good, Rolin —
Philip’s chancellor for forty years — Charles the Bold, and many other
celebrities. Beauti- ful beyond description is the Portrait of a Lady in
the Washington National Gallery — embodied pugnacity and piety, modesty
and pride. In portraiture Rogier was too romantic to match- Jan van
Eyck; but in his religious pictures he revealed a tenderness and
refinement of sentiment, and an emotional intensity, missing in Jan’s
masculine and matter -of-fact art; here, it may be, the French or
Italian spirit spoke through the Flemish form, 12 and the medieval mood
revived. Like the Italians, Rogier recorded the vital episodes in the
moving story of Mary and her Son: Gabriel announcing to a startled girl
that she is to be the mother of God; the Infant in the manger; the
adoration of the Magi; St. Luke painting the Virgin as she nurses her
Babe; the visit of Mary to Elizabeth; the mother happily contemplating
her Child; the presentation in the temple; the Crucifixion; the descent
from the cross; the Resurrection; the Last Judgment. In this final scene
Rogier reached his apogee, in a complex polyptych probably designed, but
not quite worthy, to rival The Adoration of the Lamb. It was painted for
Rolin, and is now in the pretty hospital that the great chancellor
founded in Beaune. In the central panel Christ sits in judgment, but
more tem- pered with mercy than in Michelangelo; on either side angels
robed in gleaming white carry the instruments of His passion and death;
below them Michael the Archangel weighs in a scale the good and the bad;
at the left Mary kneels in adoration and supplication; on one side the
saved genuflect in grateful prayer, on the other the damned tumble in
terror into hell. Almost as famous as this painting is a triptych in
Antwerp illustrating the Seven Sacraments with sym- bolic scenes. And
then, lest we think him quite lost in pious ecstasy, Rogier paints a
bathing beauty, and two youths peeping at her through a chink in the
wall, with that anomalous anatomical curiosity which satisfaction never
satisfies.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>CHARLES THE BOLD*. 1 46 5-7 7</li>
</ol>
<p>All this effervescence evaporated under the hot temper of Charles le
Temeraire, the Rash, commonly miscalled the Bold. Rogier van der Weyden
pictured him as the handsome, serious, black-haired young Count of
Charo- lais, who led his father’s armies to bloody victories and champed
the bit waiting for him to die. In 1465 Philip the Good, sensing his
impatience, yielded the governm ent to him, and relished the youth’s
ambition and energy.</p>
<p>Charles resented the division of his duchy into northern and southern
provinces severed in space and diverse in speech; he resented more the
feudal fealty that he owed for some of these provinces to the French
King, for</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>EPISODE IN BURGUNDY</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>others to the German Emperor. He longed to make Greater Burgundy,
like the Lotharingia (Lorraine) of the ninth century, a middle kingdom
between Germany and France, physically coherent and politically
sovereign. Even, at times, he mused that the opportune deaths of a few
intervening heirs would hand him the French, English, and Imperial
crowns, and raise him to a pinnacle beside the loftiest figures in
history. 18 To realize these dreams he organized the best standing army
in Europe, taxed his subjects beyond prece- dent, disciplined himself to
every hardship and trial, and gave neither his mind nor his body,
neither his friends nor his foes, any respite of ease or peace.</p>
<p>However, Louis XI thought of Burgundy as still an appanage of France,
and fought his rich vassal with superior strategy and guile. Charles
joined French nobles in war against Louis; he won some further towns,
and the lasting enmity of an undiscourageable king. In that struggle
Dinant and Liege revolted against Burgundy and declared for France, and
some enthusi- asts at Dinant labeled a hanged effigy of Charles as the
bastard son of a care- less priest. Charles shot down the walls of the
city, gave it over to three days of pillage by his troops, enslaved all
men, expelled all women and children, burned all buildings to the
ground, and threw 800 of the rebels, bound hand and foot, into the Meuse
(1466). Philip died in the following June, and the Count of Charolais
became Charles the Bold. He renewed the war with Louis, and compelled
his company and co-operation in the siege of repeat- edly rebellious
Liege. The starving citizens offered Charles all their goods in return
for their lives; he rejected the bargain; the city was plundered down to
the last dwelling and chapel; chalices were snatched from the hands of
priests celebrating Mass; all captives who could not pay a heavy ransom
were drowned (1468). 14</p>
<p>The world, though long inured to violence, could not forgive Charles
his severity, nor his unfeudal imprisonment and humiliation of his King.
When he conquered Gelderland, acquired Alsace, and stepped on Imperial
toes by interfering in Cologne and besieging Neuss, all his neighbors
took steps to check him. Peter van Hagenbach, whom he had appointed to
govern Alsace, so provoked the citizens with his insolence, rapacity,
and cruelty, that they hanged him; and as Swiss merchants h ad been
among Peter’s victims, and French gold was strategically distributed in
Switzerland, and the cantons felt their liberties imperiled by the
spread of Charles’s power, the Swiss Con - federation declared war on
him to the death (1474). Charles left Neuss, turned south, conquered
Lorraine — so for the first time uniting the ends of his duchy — and
marched his army over the Jura into Vaud. The Swiss were the doughtiest
warriors of the age; they defeated Charles near Granson, and again near
Morat ( 1476) ; the Burgundians were routed, and Charles neared insanity
in his grief. Lorraine saw its chance and rebelled; the Swiss sent
men.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>Louis sent money, to help the revolt. Charles formed a new army,
fought the allies near Nancy, and in that battle met defeat and death
(1477). On the morrow his body, stripped naked by ghouls, was found half
submerged in a pond, the face frozen fast in the ice. He was forty-four
years old. Bur- gundy was absorbed into France.</p>
<p>V. ART IN THE LOWLANDS: I465-I515</p>
<p>Southern Flanders declined for a time after Philip the Good.
Political disturbances drove many weavers to England; the growth of the
British clothing industry took trade and raw materials from the Flemish
cities; by 1520 English cloth crowded the markets of Flanders itself.
Brussels, Mechlin, and Valenciennes survived through superior lace,
carpets, tapestries, and jewelry, Namur by its leather, Louvain through
its university and its beer. About 1480 the canal that brought the sea
to Bruges began to silt its bed; heroic efforts were made to clear it;
wind and sand won; after 1494 seagoing vessels could no longer reach
Bruges. Soon its merchants, then its workers, left Bruges for Antwerp,
which deep-draught ships could enter by the estu- aries of the Scheldt.
Antwerp signed agreements with English exporters, and shared with Calais
the British trade with the Continent.</p>
<p>Life in Holland existed by grace of the dykes, which had to be
repeat- edly rebuilt, and might at any time collapse; some gave way in
1470 and drowned 20,000 of the population. The only major industry was
the capture and cure of herring. Holland produced many of the famous
painters of this period, but was too poor to hold them; all but Geertgen
tot Sint Jans mi- grated to Flanders.</p>
<p>There, even in cities that suffered decline, rich burghers dressed
gor- geously, dwelt in sturdy brick houses luxuriously furnished — hung
with the tapestries of Arras or Brussels, and gleaming with the brass
vessels of Dinant. They built lovely churches like Notre Dame du Sablon
at Brussels and St. Jacques at Antwerp, raised stone by stone the
towering fagade of Antwerp Cathedral, and began the proud town hall of
Ghent. They financed the painters, sat for portraits, bribed heaven with
votive art, and allowed their women to read books. Perhaps it was their
earthy mood that led Flemish painting, in its second flowering, to
stress realism and landscape even in reli- gious pictures, and to seek
new subjects in homes and fields.</p>
<p>Dirk Bouts inaugurated realism with the exaggerations natural to
innovators. He came from his native Haarlem to Brussels, studied there
under Rogier van der Weyden, settled in Louvain, and painted for its
church of St. Pierre a polyptych. The Last Supper, with an interesting
panel — Passover in a Jewish Family — which seemed to suggest that the
Last Supper was the celebration of</p>
<p>CHAP, VI ) EPISODE IN BURGUNDY 137</p>
<p>an orthodox Hebrew rite by Jews still faithful to Judaism. For a
chapel in the same church Bouts painted The Martyrdom of St. Erasmus
with a shocking literalness: two executioners turn a windlass that
slowly draws the intestines from the naked saint. In The Martyrdom of
St. Hippolytus four horses, driven in four directions, pull out the arms
and legs of the holy victim. In The Beheading of the Innocent Knight a
cavalier, vengefully accused by an unsuccessfully amorous empress of
trying to seduce her, has his head cut off; the bleeding corpse
straddles the foreground, the severed head rests comfortably in the
widow’s lap; Bouts almost redeems his violence with the calm content of
the dying and the dead. There are vivid colors in these paintings, now
and then a good landscape or perspective; but their mediocre drawing,
rigid figures, and lifeless faces sug- gest that time does not always
winnow wisely.</p>
<p>Probably Hugo van der Goes took his surname from Goes in Zeeland, and
was another instance of Ho lland’s generating and losing genius. In 1467
he was admitted to the guild of painters at Ghent. It bespeaks the
repute of Flemish painting that an Italian merchant in Flanders chose
him to paint an immense triptych for the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova
in a Florence already teeming with artists. Hugo chose for his theme the
phrase Quern genuit adoravit — u Whom she bore she adored.” The life
-size figure of the Virgin, rapt in reverence, is masterly; a shepherd
at the left anticipates the magic of Raphael and Titian; the winter
landscape is a novel achievement in delicate fidelity to nature.
Vigorous realism, original composition, accurate drawing, incisive
delineation of char- acter, placed Van der Goes at the top of the
Flemish school in the third quarter of the fifteenth century. Whether to
find more quiet for his work, or to calm the religious fears that
obsessed him, he entered a monastery near Brussels (c.</p>
<p>1475)1 where he continued to paint and (says a brother monk) drink
excessively. The notion that God had destined him for eternal damnation
darkened his sober moments, and drove him into insanity. 15</p>
<p>Vespasiano da Bisticci tells us that about 1468 Duke Federigo of
Urbino sent to Flanders for a painter to decorate his study, since he
“knew of no one in Italy who understood how to paint in oil colors.” 16
Joost van Wassenhoeve, a, friend of Van der Goes’, accepted the call,
settled in Urbino, and came to be known as Justus van Ghent. He composed
for the learned Duke twenty-eight pictures of philosophers, and for an
Urbino fraternity an altarpiece, The Institution of the Sacrament.
Though these works are Flemish in style, they date a growing ex- change
of influence between Flanders and Italy: an increased use of oil, and a
trend to realism, in Italian painters, and the infiltration of Italian
idealism and techniques into Flemish art.</p>
<p>Hans Memling, though we have no record of his visiting Italy, brought
into his painting an elegance and delicacy that he may have acquired
from the painters of Cologne, or from Rogier van der Weyden, or that may
have come up from Venice and along the Rhine to Mainz. Bom near Mainz,
and probably named from his native Momlmgen, Hans left Germany for Flan-
ders and Bruges about 1465. There, three years later, Sir John Donne, a
visit-</p>
<p>I3§ THE REFORMATION (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>ing Englishman, commissioned him to paint a Virgin Enthroned. It was
conventional in conception and composition, but it already displayed
Mem- ling’s technical competence, his refinement of feeling, and his
professional piety. St. John the Baptist was represented with Flemish
realism, St. John the Evangelist with Fra Angelico idealism; and the
rising individualism of art betrayed itself in the surreptitious
portrait of Memling peering around a pillar.</p>
<p>Like Perugino a generation later, Memling made a hundred Madonnas,
tenderly maternal, divinely calm. They hang on museum walls wherever the
eye can reach: in Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Florence, Lisbon, Madrid,
Paris, London, New York, Washington, Cleveland, Chicago. Two of the best
are in the hospital of St. John at Bruges; Mary dominates The Mystic
Marriage of St. Catherine, where almost every figure is superb; she
presides again in The Adoration of the Child, but there the Magi — one a
veritable Privy Councilor Goethe — capture the scene. In a panoramic
painting at Munich Memling pictured all the major episodes in the
recorded life of Christ. In another at Turin he told the story of the
Passion with such a medley of men and women as even Brueghel would find
it hard to outnum- ber. For the organ case of a monastery at Najera, in
Spain, he composed a triptych of Chr ist Surrounded by Angels, rivaling
Melozzo da Forli’s Angeli Musicanti of a few years before; and the
Antwerp Museum did not think itself bilked when it paid 240,000 francs
(,200,000?) for this picture in</p>
<ol start="1896" type="1">
<li>17 Another multiple altarpiece, The Last Judgment, was painted for
Iacopo Tani, an agent for Lorenzo de’ Medici in Bruges; it was put on a
ship bound for Italy, but the vessel was seized by a Hanseatic skipper,
who kept the cash and let the picture go to the Marienkirche of Danzig.
18 In these major works, and in individual panels, Memling painted some
admirable portraits: Martin van Nieuwenhoev and A Woman — stately un-
der her lofty hat and with her many rings — both in the hospital at
Bruges; A Young Man in the London Gallery; An Old Man in New York;
The</li>
</ol>
<p>Man with an Arrow in Washington. They do not reach the inspiration or
penetration of Titian or Raphael or Holbein, but they catch simple
surfaces with workmanlike skill. The occasional nudes — Adam and Eve,
Bathsheba at the Bath — do not allure.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his career Memling decorated for the hospital
in</p>
<p>Bruges a Gothic shrine designed to receive the relics of St. Ursula.
In eight panels he told how the pious maiden, betrothed to Prince Conon,
deferred their marriage till she might make a pilgrimage to Rome; how
she sailed, with 11,000 virgins, up the Rhine to Basel, led them
trippingly over the Alps, basked in the blessings of the Pope, and how,
on their return, all 1 1,001 were martyred by pagan Huns at Cologne.
Nine years later (1488) Carpaccio told</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) EPISODE IN BURGUNDY I 39</p>
<p>he same pretty absurdity, with more accurate drawing and finer
coloring, for the School of St. Ursula in Venice.</p>
<p>It is unfair to Memling, or any painter, to look at his pictures
wholesale; each was meant for a separate time and place, and there
conveyed his lyric quality. To view them in the gross is at once to
perceive his limitations — his narrowness of range and style, the
monotony of his portraits, even of his modest Madonnas with their
streaming golden hair. The surface is lovely or true, and shines with
smooth, bright hues; but the brush rarely reaches to the soul beneath,
to the secret loneliness, wonderment, aspirations, griefs. There is no
life in Memlin g’s women; and when he unclothes them we are chagrined to
find them all stomach and tiny breasts. Perhaps the fashion in such
items was different then than now; even our desires may be indoctrina-
tion. Yet we must acknowledge that when Memling died (1495) he was, by
the common consent of his patrons and his rivals, the leading painter
north of the Alps. If other artists felt his faults more keenly than
their own, they could not match the delicacy of his style, the purity of
his sentiment, the splendor of his coloring. For a generation his
influence was supreme in the Flemish school.</p>
<p>Gerard David continued the mood. Coming from Holland to Bruges about
1483, he felt the spell of Memling’s aria dolce; his Madonnas are almost
identical</p>
<p>Son of a Louvain blacksmith, Massys was received into the painters’
guild of St. Luke at Antwerp in 1491, aged twenty-five. St. Luke,
however, would hardly have approved The Feast of Herod , where Herodias
prods with a carving knife the severed head of the Baptist, nor The
Entombment of Christy where Joseph of Arimathea plucks blood clots from
the hair of the bloodless corpse. Having married twice and buried seven
children, Massys had some steel in his fiber, some acid in his oils. So
he catches a courtesan in the act of cozening an old money- lender out
of his coin; and in a gentler mood he shows a banker counting his gold
while hi s wife looks on in mingled appreciation and jealousy. Yet
Massys’ Madonnas are more human than Memling’s; one (in Berlin) kisses
and fondles her Child as any mother would; and the bright blue, purple,
and red of her gar- ments accentuate her beauty When it came to
portraiture Massys could pene- trate behind the face to the character
more successfully than Memling, as in the remarkable Study for a
Portrait in the Musee Jacquemart-Andr6 in Paris. It was to Massys that
Peter Gillis turned when (1517) he wished to send to Thomas More
faithful similitudes of Erasmus and himself. Quentin did well with
Gillis, but his Erasmus had the ill luck to be followed by Holbein’s.
When Diirer (1520)</p>
<p>140 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. VI</p>
<p>and Holbein (1526) came to Antwerp it was to Massys that they paid
their highest respects as the dean of Flemish art.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, there had appeared in Brabant the most original
and absurd artist in Flemish history. Here and there in Massys — as in
the leering mob in Christ Shawn to the People (Madrid), or the ugly
faces in an Adora- tion of the Magi (New York) — were such gnarled and
brutal heads as Leo- nardo drew in the satirical byplay of his pen.
Hieronymus Bosch made a successful business of such grotesqueries. Born,
and spending most of his life, in Bois-le-Duc (in northern Brabant, now
southern Holland), he came to be known by its Flemish name, ’s
Hertogenbosch, finally Bosch. Fora time he painted the usual religious
themes, and in some, like the Adoration of the Magi in Madrid, he verged
on normality. But his sense of the ridiculous came to dominate his
imagination and his art. Perhaps in chilhood he had been frightened by
medieval tales of imps and ghosts, of demons starting from be- hind any
rock or sprouting from a tree; now he would caricature those hob-
goblins in curative satire, and laugh them out of mind. He resented with
an artist’s sensitivity the botches of humanity— the bizarre or ugly or
deformed — and depicted them with a macabre mixture of wrath and glee.
Even in idyllic scenes like The Nativity (Cologne) he gave the
foreground to the nose of a cow; in The Adoration of the Magi (New York)
peasants peek through windows and archways at the Virgin and her Child.
Yet in this last picture he painted with consummate draftsmanship a
majestic St. Peter and a Negro king whose stately dignity puts the other
figures in the shade. But as Bosch proceeded with the story of Christ he
darkened the pictures with bestial faces, ferocious eyes, enormous
noses, grimly protruding and voracious lips. Passing to the legends of
the saints, he portrayed a surprisingly tender St. John the Evangelist
in an unusual landscape of islands and sea; but in a cor- ner he placed
a contemplative devil — with a monkish cowl, rat’s tail, and
entomological legs — patiently waiting to inherit the earth. In The
Tempta- tion of St. Anthony he surrounded the desperate anchorite with
gay courte- sans and weird imaginings — a dwarf with legs rooted in his
shoulders, a bird with the legs of a goat, a jug with the legs of a cow,
a rat bestridden by a witch, a minstrel capped with a horse’s skull.
Bosch took the grotesques from the Gothic cathedrals, and made a world
of them.</p>
<p>He was anything but a realist. Now and then he drew a scene from
life, as in The Prodigal’s Son, but there too he exaggerated the
ugliness, the poverty, and the fear. His Hay Ride is no merrymaking in
the month of May, but a bitter illustration of “all flesh is grass.” 19
Atop the load all is ideal: a youth plays music for a girl who sings;
behind them two lovers kiss, and an angel kneels; above them Christ
hovers in the clouds. But on the ground a murderer stabs his fallen
enemy, a procuress invites a lass to prostitution,</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) EPISODE IN BURGUNDY 141</p>
<p>a quack sells panaceas, a fat priest receives offerings from nuns,
the cart wheels crush some careless celebrants. At the right a company
of devils, aided by apes, drag the damned into hell. Philip II, King of
Spain and gloom, hung this piece in his Escorial. Near it he placed a
companion piece, The Pleasures of the World. Around a pool, in which
naked men and women bathe, rides a procession of nudes on animals partly
zoological, partly phan- tasmagorical; spikes and thorns enter the
picture from every side; in the foreground two nudes clasp each other in
a waltz, while a huge bird gazes on them in philosophical amusement. One
shutter shows the creation of Eve as the source of all evil; another
displays the tortures and contortions of the damned. It is a marvel of
composition, of clever drawing, of diseased imagi- nation-veritable
Bosch.</p>
<p>Can it be that even in the dawn of modernity there were millions of
simple and impressionable Christians who had nightmares like these? Was
Bosch one such? Hardly, for in a portrait of him in the library at Arras
he is shown in old age, in full vigor of mind and sharpness of eye; he
is a man of the world who has survived his satirical rage, and can look
upon life with the humor of one who will soon be out of the mess. He
could not have painted these ghoulish fancies so skillfully if they had
still possessed him. He stood above them, not so much amused as angry
that humanity had ever harbored them. That his contemporaries enjoyed
his productions as pictorial pranks rather than as theological terrors
appears from the wide market found by prints made from engravings of his
works. A generation later Pieter Brueghel would exorcise these devils,
and transform these hobgoblins into a healthy and jolly multitude; and
four centuries later neurotic artists would reflect the neuroses of
their time by painting sarcastic fantasies redolent of Hieron- ymus
Bosch.</p>
<p>A more conventional figure closed this chapter in Flemish painting.
Bom in Maubeuge, and thence also named Mabuse, Jan Gossaert came to
Antwerp in 1503, probably after learning his art from David in Bruges.
In 1507 he was in- vited to the court of Duke Philip of Burgundy — one
of Philip the Good’s erotic by-products. Jan accompanied the Duke to
Italy, and returned with some finesse added to his brush, and a flair
for nudes and pagan mythologies; his Adam and Eve made the unclothed
body attractive for the first time in Flemish art. Mary with the Child
and Angels and St. Luke Drawing the Madonna echoed Italy in their fat
cherubs and Renaissance architectural backgrounds, and The Agony in the
Garden may have owed to Italy its brilliant representation of moonlight.
But Gossaert’s forte was portraiture. No Fleming since Jan van Eyck had
turned out such a searching character study as the fan Carondelet in the
Louvre; here the artist concentrated on face and hands, and revealed the
moneyed ancestry, the stoic administrator, the mind made somber by the
burdens of authority. Massys had brought to an end that first line of
Flemish painting which had</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>reached nobility in the Van Eycks; Gossaert imported from Italy those
novelties of technique, elegances of ornament, graces of line,
subtleties of chiaroscuro and portraiture, that would in the sixteenth
century (barring Brueghel) turn Flemish painting from its native skill
and genius, and leave it in suspended excellence until its culmination
under Rubens and Van Dyck.</p>
<p>Charles the Bold left no son, but he had betrothed his daughter Mary
to M aximilian of Austria in the hope that the Hapsburgs would protect
Bur- gundy from France. When Louis XI nevertheless appropriated the
duchy, Mary fled to Ghent. There, as the price of being accepted as
their constitu- tional sovereign by Flanders, Brabant, Hainaut, and
Holland, she signed the Groote Privilege (February 1477), which pledged
her to enter into no mar- riage, levy no taxes, declare no war, without
the consent of the “Estates” or assemblies of the signatory provinces.
By this and later charters, including the Joyeuse Entrie, as Brabant
termed its own grant of local liberty, the Netherlands began a
century-long struggle for independence. But Mary’s marriage to
Maximilian (August 1477) brought the powerful Hapsburgs into the
Lowlands. When Mary died (1482) Maximilian became regent. When
Maximilian was elected emperor (1494) he transmitted the regency to his
son Philip. When Philip died (1506) his sister, Margaret of Austria, was
appointed governor- general by the Emperor. When Philip’s son, the
future Charles V, then fifteen, was declared of age (1515), the
Netherlands became part of a vast Hapsburg empire under one of the
crartiest and most ambitious rulers in history. Thereby would hang a
tale.</p>
