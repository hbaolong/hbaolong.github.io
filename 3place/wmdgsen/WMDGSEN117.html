<p>Greece and Macedon</p>
<p>I. THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER</p>
<p>H istorians divide the past into epochs, years, and events, as</p>
<p>thought divides the world into groups, individuals, and things;
but</p>
<p>history, like nature, knows only continuity amid change: historia non
jack saltum — hktoTy makes no leaps. Hellenistic Greece did not feel
Alexan- der’s death as “the end of an age”; it looked upon him as the
beginning of “modern” times, and as a symbol of vigorous youth rather
than a factor in decay; it was convinced that it had now entered upon
its richest maturity, and that its leaders were as magnificent as any in
the past except the in- comparable young King himself.’ In many ways it
was right. Greek civ - ilization did not die -with Greek freedom; on the
contrary it conquered new areas and spread in three directions as the
formation of vast empires broke down the political barriers to
communication, colonization, and trade. Still enterprising and alert,
the Greeks moved by hundreds of thousands into Asia and Egypt, Epirus
and Macedon; and not only did Ionia flower again, but Hellenic blood,
language, and culture made its way into the interior of Asia Minor, into
Phoenicia and Palestine, through Syria and Babylonia, across the
Euphrates and the Tigris, even to Bactria and India. Never had the Greek
spirit shown more zest and courage; never had Greek letters and arts won
so wide a victory.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why historians are wont to end their histories of
Greece with Alexander; after him the extent and complexity of the Greek
world baffle any unified view or continuous narrative. There were not
only three major monarchies — Macedonia, Seleucia, and Egypt; there were
a hundred Greek city-states, of all degrees of independence; there was a
maze of alliances and leagues; there were half-Greek states in Epirus,
Judea, Pergamum, Byzantium, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Galatia, Bactria; and
in the west were Greek Italy and Sicily, tom between aging Carthage and
youth- ful Rome. Alexander’s rootless empire was too loosely bound
together by language, communication, customs, and faith to survive him.
He had left not one but several strong men behind him, and none could be
content with less than sovereignty. The size and diversity of the new
realm dis-</p>
<p>557</p>
<p>55^ THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>missed all thought of democracy; self-government, as the Greeks
under- stood it, presupposed a city-state whose citizens could come
periodically to a common meeting place; and besides, had not the
philosophers of demo- cratic Athens denounced democracy as the
enthronement of ignorance, envy, and chaos? Alexande r’s successors— who
were therefore termed Diadochi — hsidi been Macedonian chieftains, long
accustomed to rule by the sword; democracy, except as the occasional
consultation of their aides, never entered their heads. After some minor
trials at arms which disposed of lesser contenders, they divided the
empire into five parts (321) — An- tipater taking Macedonia and Greece,
Lysimachus Thrace, Antigonus Asia Minor, Seleucus Babylonia, and Ptolemy
Egypt. They did not bother to call a confirming synod of the Greek
states. From that moment, except for some fitful interludes in Greece,
and the aristocratic republic of Rome, monarchy ruled Europe until the
French Revolution.</p>
<p>The basic principle of democracy is freedom inviting chaos; the basic
prin- ciple of monarchy is power inviting tyranny, revolution, and war.
From Philip to Perseus, from Chaeronea to Pydna (338-168), the foreign
and civil wars of the city-states were supplemented by the external and
internal wars of the king- doms, for the perquisites of government
tempted a hundred generals to contests for thrones. Violence was as
popular, condottieri as numerous and brilliant, in Hellenistic Greece as
in Renaissance Italy. When Antipater died Athens re- volted again, and
put to death old Phocion, who had ruled it as justly as possible in
Antipater’s name. Cassander, Antipater’s son, recaptured the city for
Macedon (318), widened the franchise to holders of a thousand drachmas,
and left as his regent the philosopher, scholar, and dilettante
Demetrius of Phalerum, who gave the city ten years of prosperity and
peace. Meanwhile Antigonus I (“Cyclops”) dreamed of uniting all of
Alexander’s empire under his one eye; he</p>
<p>• Damocles, sought out everywhere by Demetrius and at last about to
be captured, killed himself by plunging into a caldron of boiling
water.* We must not misjudge ^e Athenians from one such instance of
virtue.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXin) GREECE AND MACEDON 559</p>
<p>Four years later (279), taking advantage of the disorder brought on
by the struggle for power in the eastern Mediterranean, a horde of
Celts, or “Gauls,” under Brennus* marched down through Macedonia into
Greece.</p>
<p>and likewise old women, and babes at their mothers’ breasts; they</p>
<p>drank the blood, and feasted on the flesh of infants that were
fat.</p>
<p>High-spirited women, and maidens in their flower, committed sui-</p>
<p>cide . . . those that survived were subjected to every kind of
outrage.</p>
<p>. . . Some of the women rushed upon the swords of the Gauls, and</p>
<p>voluntarily courted death; to others death came from absence of food
or sleep, as these merciless barbarians ravished them in turn, and</p>
<p>wreaked their lusts upon them whether dying or dead.t®</p>
<p>After suffering years of such devastation, the Greeks of Asia bought
oflF the invaders, and persuaded them to retire into northern Phrygia
(where their settlements become knovm as Galatia), Thrace, and the
Balkans. For two generations the Gauls levied fear tribute from Seleucus
I and the Greek cities of the Asiatic coasts and the Black Sea;
Byzantium alone paid them 40,000 a year.J“ As the emperors and generals
of Rome were to be occupied, in the third century after Christ, in
repelling barbarian inroads, so the kings and generals of Pergamum,
Seleucia, and Macedonia gave much of their resources and energies, in
the third century before Christ, to driv- ing back the recurring waves
of Celtic invasion. Throughout its history ancient civilization lived on
the edge of a sea of barbarism that repeatedly threatened to inundate
it. The stoic courage of citizens perpetually pre-</p>

account of Greek inva - sions into Asia, Italy, or Sicily.</p>

<p>S6o THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. Xmi</p>
<p>pared had once kept back the peril; but stoicism was dying in Greece
pre- cisely at the time that devised its classic formulation and its
name.</p>
<p>Antigonus II, son of Demetrius Poliorcetes and called “Gonatas”
for</p>
<p>reasons now unknown, drove the Gauls out of Macedonia, put down the
revolt of Apollodorus, and ruled Macedonia with ability and moderation
for thirty-eight years (277-39). He gave generously to literature,
science, and philosophy, brought poets like Aratus of Soli to his court,
and formed a lifelong friendship with Zeno the Stoic; he was the first
of that very discontinuous line of philosopher-kings which ended in
Marcus Aurelius. Nevertheless it was during his reign that Athens made a
last bid for free- dom. In 267 the nationalist party came into power
under the leadership of a young pupil of Zeno’s, Chremonides. It secured
the aid of Egypt, ousted the Macedonian troops, and announced the
liberation of A^ens. Antigonus came down at his leisure and recaptured
the city (262), but dealt with it as became one who respected philosophy
and old age. He established garrisons in the Piraeus, on Salamis, and at
Sunium, and en- joined Athens from engaging in alliances or wars; for
the rest he left the city completely free.</p>
<p>Other Greek states were solving in other ways the problem of recon-
ciling liberty with order. About 279 little Aetolia, peopled like
Macedon with half-barbarous and never-conquered mountaineers, began to
organize the cities of northern Greece — chiefly those of the Delphic
Amphictyony — into the Aetolian League; and about the same time the
Achaean League of Patrae, Dyme, Pellene, and other towns attracted to
its membership many cities of the Peloponnese. In either league the
constituent municipalities kept control of all local government, but
surrendered their armed forces and foreign relations to a federal
council, and a strategos, elected by such of the citizens as could
attend the annual assembly at Aegium in Achaea, or at Thermus in
Aetolia. Each league maintained peace, and established common-measures,
weights, and coinages throughout its area — an achieve- ment in
co-operation that makes the third century in some ways politically
superior to the age of Pericles.</p>
<p>The Achaean League was transformed into a first-class power by Aratus
of Sicyon. At the age of twenty this new Themistocles freed Sicyon from
its dictator by a night attack with a handful of men. By eloquence and
subtle negotiation he persuaded all the Peloponnesus except Sparta and
Elis to join the League, which chose him as its strategos annually for
ten years (245-35). With a few hundred men he secretly entered Corinth,
scaled the almost inaccessible Acrocorinthus, routed the Macedonian
troops, and re-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) GREECE AND MACEDON 561</p>
<p>Stored the city to freedom. Passing on to the Piraeus, he bribed the
Mace- donian garrison to surrender, and announced the liberation of
Athens. From that moment to the Roman conquest Athens enjoyed a unique
self-gov- ernment — militarily powerless, but left inviolate by the
Hellenistic states because her universities had made her the
intellectual capital of the Greek world. Athens turned to philosophy,
and contentedly disappeared from political history.</p>
<p>Now at the height of their power, the two leagues began to weaken
themselves by war with each other and class war within. In 220 the
Aetoli- an League, wi th Sparta and Elis, fought the bitter “Social” War
against the Achaean League and Macedon. Aratus, the defender of freedom,
was also the protector of wealth; in each city the League supported the
party of property. The poorer citizens complained that they could not
afford to attend the distant assemblies of the League, and were thereby
in effect disfranchised; they were skeptical of a liberty that meant the
full privilege of the clever and the strong to exploit the simple and
the weak; more and more they gave their applause to demagogues who
called for a redistribu- tion of the land. Like the rich of a century
before, the poor began to favor Macedonia against their own
governments.</p>
<p>Macedonia, however, was ruined by the honesty of Antigonus III. He
had assumed power as regent for his stepson, Philip, and had promised to
surrender the throne upon Philip’s coming of age. The cynics of the time
called him “Doson”— the Promiser — apparently because they took it for
granted that he was lying. But he kept his word, and in 22 1 Philip V,
aged seventeen, began a long reign of intrigue and war. He was a man of
cour- age and capacity, but of unscrupulous subtlety. He seduced the
wife of .^atus’ son, poisoned Aratus, killed his own son on suspicion of
con - spiracy, and arranged banquets of poisoned wine for those who
stood in the way of his plans.’ He enlarged and enriched Macedonia, and
left it more populous and prosperous than for one hundred and fifty
years past. But in 215, fearful of the growing power of Rome, he made
the historic mistake of allying himself with Hannibal and Carthage. A
year later Rome declared war upon Macedonia, and began the conquest of
Greece.</p>

<li>THE STRUGGLE FOR ’WEALTH</li>
</ol>
<p>Athenaeus, who is as reliable as any gossip, tells us that Demetrius
of Phalerum, about 310, took a census of Athens, and reported 2 1,000
citizens, 10,000 metics or aliens, and 400,000 slaves.“ The last figure
is incredible.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>562</p>
<p>(chap. XXIH</p>
<p>but we know nothing that contradicts it. Very probably the number of
rural slaves had grown; estates were becoming larger, and were being
worked more and more by slaves under a slave overseer managing for an
absentee landlord.* Under this system a more scientific agriculture
devel- oped; Varro knew fifty Greek manuals of the art. But the
processes of erosion and deforestation had already gutted much of the
land. Even in the fourth century Plato had expressed the belief that
rain and flood, in the flow of time, had carried away much of the arable
surface of Attica; the surviving hills, in his metaphor, were a skeleton
from which the flesh had been washed away.” Many areas of Attica were in
the third century so denuded of topsoil that their ancient farms were
abandoned. The for- ests of Greece were vanishing, and timber, like
food, had to be brought in from abroad.” The mines at Laurium were worn
out and almost deserted; silver could be gotten more cheaply from Spain;
and the gold mines of Thrace, which had once poured their wealth into
Athens, now enriched the treasury and beautified the coinage of
Macedon.</p>
<p>While the source of a virile and independent citizenry was drying up
in the villages, industry and the class war were progressing in the
towns. Small factories, and the slaves in them, were growing in number
at Athens, as in all the larger cities of the Hellenistic world. Slave
dealers accompanied the armies, bought unransomed captives, and sold
them at three or four minas ($ 1 50 or 00) a head in the great slave
markets of Delos and Rhodes. Some scruples, moral or economic, were felt
about this ancient institution. A humanitarian sentiment arose as a
by-product of philosophy; the cos- mopolitan spirit of the age was
negligent of racial distinctions; and casual hired labor, which could be
thrown upon public relief whenever it ceased to be privately profitable,
was in many circumstances cheaper ^an slave labor that had to be
continuously maintained.” Towards the close of this period there was a
substantial rise in manumissions.</p>
<p>Commerce languished in the older cities, but flourished in the new.
The Greek ports of Asia and Egypt grew at the expense of the Piraeus;
and even on the mainland it was Chalcis and Corinth that caught the
swelling currents of Hellenistic trade. Through these strategically
situated and well- equipped centers, as through Antioch, Seleucia,
Rhodes, Alexandria, and Syracuse, a busy stream of merchants flowed,
spreading a cosmopolitan and skeptical point of view. Bankers
multiplied, and lent not only to traders and proprietors but to cities
and governments.” Some cities, like Delos and Byzantium, had public or
national banks holding government funds and managed by state officials.”
In 324 Antimenes of Rhodes organized the</p>
<p>GREECE AND MACEDON</p>
<p>CHAP, xxin)</p>
<p>563</p>
<p>first known system of insurance by guaranteeing owners, for a premium
of eight per cent, against loss from the flight of their slaves.“ The
release of Persian accumulations and the quickened circulation of
capital reduced the rate of interest to ten per cent in the third
century and seven per cent in the second. Speculation was widespread,
but not organized. Some manipulators sought to raise prices by limiting
production; there were advocates of restricting crops to keep up the
purchasing power of the farming community.“ Prices in general were high,
again because of the Achaemenid treasuries that Alexander had poured
into the currency of the world; but at the same time, and partly by the
same cause, trade was fa- cilitated, production was stimulated, and
prices gradually fell back to a nor- mal range. The wealth of the
wealthy grew beyond any precedent in Greek history. Homes became
palaces, furniture and carriages more sump- tuous, servants more
numerous; dinners became orgies, and women became show windows of their
husbands’ prosperity.”</p>
<p>Wages lagged behind rising prices, and rapidly followed their fall.
They could support a single man only, and made for celibacy, pauperism,
and depopulation; they left a diminishing economic distance between free
worker and slave. Employment was irregular, and thousands of men aban-
doned the mainland cities for mercenary soldiering abroad, or to hide
their poverty in rural isolation.” The Athenian government relieved t he
desti- tute with grants of corn; the rich amused them with free tickets
to cele- brations and games. The wealthy stinted in wages but were
generous in charity; often they lent money to their cities without
interest, or rescued them from bankruptcy with large gifts, or built
public works out of their private funds, or endowed temples or
universities, or paid handsomely for the statues or the poems that
published their features or their largess. The poor organized themselves
into unions for mutual aid, but they could do little against the power
and cleverness of the rich, the conservatism of the peasants, and the
readiness of otherwise rival governments and leagues to exchange armed
assistance in suppressing revolts.” The freedom of un - equal abi lity
to accumulate or starve brought on again, as in Solon’s days, an extreme
concentration of wealth. The poor lent readier ear to socialistic
gospels; their spokesmen called for the cancellation of debts, the
redivision of the land, and the confiscation of large fortunes; the
boldest now and then proposed the liberation of the slaves.”</p>
<p>The decay of religious belief promoted the growth of compensatory
utopias: Zeno the Stoic described an ideal communism in his Republic
(ca. 300), and his follower lambulus (ca. 250) inspired Greek rebels
with</p>
<p>564 the life of GREECE (CHAP. XXHI</p>
<p>a romance in which he described a Blessed Isle in the Indian Ocean
(per- haps Ceylon) ; there, he reported, all men were equal, not only in
rights but in ability and intelligence; all worked equally, and shared
equally in the product; all took equal part, turn by turn, in
administering the govern- ment; neither wealth nor poverty existed
there, nor any war of the classes; nature produced fruit abundantly of
her own accord, and men lived in harmony and universal love.‘°“</p>
<p>Some governments nationalized certain industries: Priene took over
the saltworks, Miletus the textile factories, Rhodes and Cnidus the
potteries; but the governments paid as low wages as the private
employer, and squeezed all possible profit from the labor of their
slaves. The gulf between rich and poor widened;^ the class war became
bitterer than before. Every city, young or old, echoed with the hatred
of class for class, with uprisings, massacres, suppressions,
banishments, and the destruction of property and life. When one faction
won it exiled the other and confiscated its goods; when the exiles
returned to power they revenged themselves in kind, and slaughtered
their enemies; imagine the stability of an economic system subject to
such decerebrations and disturbances. Some ancient Greek cities were so
devastated by class strife that industry and men fled irom them, grass
grew in the streets, cattle came there to graze.” Polybius, writing
about 150 B.C., describes certain timeless phases of the war from the
view- point of a rich conservative:</p>
<p>When they (the radical leaders) have made the populace ready</p>
<p>and greedy to receive bribes, the virtue of democracy is
destroyed,</p>
<p>and it is transformed into a government of violence and the
strong</p>
<p>hand. For the mob, habituated to feed at the expense of others, and
to have its hopes of a livelihood in the property of its neighbors,
as</p>
<p>soon as it has found a leader sufficiently ambitious and daring, . .
.</p>
<p>produces a reign of violence. Then come tumultuous assemblies,</p>
<p>massacres, banishments, redivisions of land.”</p>
<p>It was war and class war that weakened mainland Greece to the point
of being easily overcome by Rome. The bitter ruthlessness of the victors
— the destruction of crops, vineyards, and orchards, the razing of
farmhouses, the selling of captives into davery — ruined one locality
after another, and left an empty shell for the ultimate enemy. A land so
wasted by strife, by erosion, deforestation, and the listless tillage of
impoverished tenants or slaves, could not compete with the alluvial
plains of the Orontes, the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Nile. The
northern cities were no longer</p>
<p>GREECE AND MACEDON</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>565</p>
<p>on the great routes of trade; they had lost their navies, and could
not con- trol the sources and avenues of the grain supply that Athens
and Sparta had mastered in their imperial da^ys. The centers of power,
even of lit- erary and artistic creation, passed back again to Asia and
Egypt, from which, a thousand years before, Greece had humbly learned
her letters and her arts.</p>
<p>ra. THE MORALS OF DECAY</p>
<p>The failure of the city-state accelerated the decay of the orthodox
re- ligion; the gods of the city had proved helpless to defend it, and
had for- feited belief. The population was intermingled with foreign
merchants who had no share in the city’s civic or religious life, and
whose amused skepticism spread among the citizens. The mythology of the
ancient local gods survived among the peasantry and the simple
townsfolk, and in the official rites; the educated used it for poetry
and art, the half-liberated attacked it bitterly, the upper classes
supported it as an aid to order, and discountenanced open atheism as bad
taste. The growth of large states brought on a sympolity of the gods and
made for a vague monotheism, while philosophers strove to formulate
pantheism for the literate in a man- ner not too obviously incompatible
with orthodox belief. About 300 Euhemerus of Messana in Sicily published
his Hiera Anagrapha (literally Holy Scriptures, or Records), in which he
argued that the gods were either personified powers of nature, or, more
often, human heroes deified by popular imagination or gratitude for
their benefits to mankind; that myths were allegories, and that
religious ceremonies were originally exer- cises in commemoration of the
dead. So Zeus was a conqueror who had died in Crete, Aphrodite was the
founder and patroness of prostitution, and the story of Cronus eating
his children was only a way of saying that cannibalism had once existed
on the earth. The book had a sharply atheis- tic effect in third-
century Greece.*”**</p>
<p>Skepticism, however, is uncomfortable; it leaves the common heart and
imagination empty, and the vacuum soon draws in some new and encour-
aging creed. The victories of philosophy and Alexander cleared the way
for novel cults. Athens in the third century was so disturbed by exotic
faiths, nearly all of them promising heaven and threatening hell, that
Epi- curus, like Lucretius in first-century Rome, felt called upon to
denounce religion as hostile to peace of mind and joy of life. The new
temples, even</p>

<p>6 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>in Athens, were now usually dedicated to Isis, Serapis, Bendis,
Adonis, or some other alien deity. The Eleusinian mysteries flourished,
and were imi- tated in Egypt, Italy, Sicily, and Crete; Dionysus
Eleutherios — the Lib- erator-remained popular until he was absorbed
into Christ; Orphism won fresh devotees as it renewed contact with the
Eastern faiths from which it had sprung. The old religion had been
aristocratic, and had excluded for- eigners and slaves; the new Oriental
cults accepted all men and women, alien or bond or free, and held out to
all classes the promise of eternal life.</p>
<p>Superstition spread while science reached its apogee. Theophrastus’
por - trait of the Superstitious Man reveals how frail was the fihn of
culture even in the capital of enlightenment and philosophy. The number
seven was unspeakably holy; there were seven planets, seven days of the
week, seven Wonders, seven Ages of Man, seven heavens, seven gates of
hell. Astrology was rejuvenated by commerce with Babylonia; people took
it for granted that the stars were gods who ruled in detail the
destinies of individuals and states; character, even thought, was
determined by the star or planet under which one had been born, and
would therefore be jovial, or mercurial,, or saturnine; even the Jews,
the least superstitious of all peo- ples, expressed good wishes by
saying Mazzol-tov — ^Mzy your planet be favorable.’”* Astronomy fought
for its life against astrology, but finally succumbed in the second
century a.d. And everywhere the Hellenistic world worshiped Tyche, the
great god Chance.</p>
<p>Only an act of persistent imagination, or a gift for observation, can
en- able us to realize what it means to a nation to have its traditional
religion die. Classic Greek civilization had been built upon a patriotic
devotion to the city-state, and classic morality, though rooted in
folkways rather than in faith, had been powerfully reinforced by
supernatural beljef. But now neither faith nor patriotism survived in
the educated Greek; civic frontiers had been erased by empires; and the
growth of knowledge had secularized morals, marriage, parentage, and
law. For a time the Periclean Enlighten- ment helped morality, as in
modem Europe; humanitarian feelings were developed, and aroused —
ineffectually — a keener resentment against war; arbitration grew among
cities and men. Manners were more polished, argument more urbane;
courtesy trickled down, as in our Middle Ages, from the courts of the
kings, where it was a matter of personal safety and royal prestige; when
the Romans came Greece was amazed at their bad manners and blunt ways.
Life was more refined; women moved about in it more freely, and
stimulated the males to unwonted elegance. Men shaved now, especially in
Byzantium and Rhodes, where the laws forbade it as effeminate.” But the
pursuit of pleasure consumed the adult life of the</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) GREECE AND M A C E D O N 567</p>
<p>upper classes. The old problem of ethics and morals — to reconcile
the nat- ural epicureanism of the individual with the necessary stoicism
of the state — found no solution in religion, statesmanship, or
philosophy.</p>
<p>Education spread, but spread thin; as in all intellectual ages it
stressed knowledge more than character, and produced masses of
half-educated people who, uprooted from labor and the land, moved about
in unplaced discontent like loosened cargo in the ship of state. Some
cities, like Miletus and Rhodes, established public — i.e.,
government-supported — schools; at Te- os and Chios boys and girls were
educated together, with an impartiality that only Sparta had shown.**
The gymnasium developed into a high school or college, with classrooms,
lecture hall, and library. The palaestra flour- ished, and proved
popular in the East; but public games had degenerated into professional
contests, chiefly boxing, in which strength counted for more than skill;
the Greeks, who had once been a nation of athletes, became now a nation
of spectators, content to vsdtness rather than to do.</p>
<p>Sexual morality was relaxed even beyond the loose standards of the
Periclean age. Homosexualism remained popular; the youth Delphis “is in
love,” says Theocritus’ Simaetha, “but whether for a woman or for a man
I cannot say.”” The courtesan still reigned: Demetrius Poliorcetes
levied a tax of two hundred and fifty talents (50,000) upon the
Athenians, and then gave it to his mistress Lamia on the ground that she
needed it for soap; which led the angry Athenians to remark how unclean
the lady must be.*“ Dances of naked women were accepted as part of the
mores, and were performed before a Macedonian king.” Athenian life was
portrayed</p>
<p>Greek women participated actively in the cultural pursuits of the
time, and contributed to letters, science, philosophy, and art.
Aristodama of Smyrna gave recitals of her poetry throughout Greece, and
received many honors. Some philosophers, like Epicurus, did not hesitate
to admit women into their schools. Literature began to stress the
physical loveliness of woman rather than her worth and charm as a
mother; the literary cult of feminine beauty arose in this period
alongside the poetry and fiction of romantic love. The partial
emancipation of woman was accompanied by a revolt against wholesale
maternity, and the limitation of the family became the outstanding
social phenomenon of the age. Abortion was punishable only if practiced
by a woman against the wish of her husband, or at the instigation of her
seducer. When a child came it was in many cases exposed. Only one family
in a hundred, in the old Greek cities, reared more than one daughter:
“Even a rich man,” reports Poseidippus, “always exposes a daugh- ter.”
Sisters were a rarity. Families with no child, or only one, were</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>568</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>numerous. Inscriptions enable us to trace the fertility of
seventy-nine families in Miletus about 200 b.c.: thirty-two had one
child, thirty-one had two; altogether they had one hundred and eighteen
sons and twenty-eight daughters.”“ At Eretria only one family in twelve
had two sons; hardly any had two daughters. Philosophers condoned
infanticide as reducing the pressure of population; but when the lower
classes took up the practice on a large scale, the death rate overtook
the birth rate. Religion, which had once frightened men into fertility
lest their dead souls be untended, no longer had the power to outweigh
considerations of comfort and cost. In the colonies immigration replaced
the old families; in Attica and the Pelo- ponnesus immigration trickled
down to a negligible figure, and population declined. In Macedonia
Philip V forbade the limitation of the family, and in thirty years
raised the man power of the country fifty per cent;“ we may judge from
this how widespread the practice of limitation had become, even in half-
primitive Macedon. “In our time,” wrote Polybius about 150 B.C.,</p>
<p>the whole of Greece has been subject to a low birth rate and a gen-
eral decrease of the population, owing to which cities have become
deserted and the land has ceased to yield fruit. . . . For as men
had</p>
<p>fallen into such a state of luxury, avarice, and indolence that they
did not wish to marry, or, if they married, to rear the children bom
to</p>
<p>them, or at most but one or two of them, so as to leave these in
afflu- ence and bring them up to waste their substance — the evil
insensibly but rapidly grew. For in cases where, of one or two children,
the one was carried off by war and the other by sickness, it was evident
that the houses must have been left empty . . . and by small degrees
cities became resourceless and feeble.”</p>

<li>REVOLUTION IN SPARTA</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile that concentration of wealth, which everywhere in Greece
was enflaming the eternal conflict of classes, produced in Sparta two
at- tempts at revolutionary reform. Isolated by its mountain barriers,
Sparta had maintained its independence, had fought back the Macedonians,
and had bravely defeated the immense army of Pyrrhus (272). But the
greed of the strong generated from within the ruin that enemy forces had
failed to bring from without. The Lycurgean laws against alienating the
land from the family by sale, or dividing it in bequests, had been
abrogated,® and the fortunes made by Spartans in empire or war had gone
to buying</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps because the latter had led to family limitation, as in modem
France.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) GREECE AND MACEDON 569</p>
<p>up the soil.“ By 244 the 700,000 acres of Laconia were owned by one
hun- dred families,“ and only seven hundred men had preserved the rights
of citizenship. Even these no longer ate in common; the poor could not
make the necessary contribution, while the rich preferred to feast in
private. A large majority of the families that had once enjoyed the
franchise had sunk into poverty, and called for a cancellation of debts
and a redivision of the land.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of monarchy that the attempt to reform this
condition came from the Spartan kings. In 242 Agis IV and Leonidas
succeeded to the dual throne. Convinced that Lycurgus had meant the land
to be equally divided among all freemen, Agis proposed to redistribute
it, to annul all debts, and to restore the semicommunism of Lycurgus.
Those landowners whose property was mortgaged supported the move for
cancellation; but when the measure had been passed they resisted
violently the remaining elements of Agis’ reforms. At the instigation of
Leonidas, Agi s was mur- dered, along with his mother and his
grandmother, both of whom had vol- unteered to surrender their great
estates for division among the people. In this royal drama the noblest
characters were women. Chilonis, daughter of Leonidas, was the wife of
Cleombrotus, who supported Agis. When Leonidas was exiled, and
Cleombrotus seized his throne, Chilonis left her triumphant husband to
share her father’s banishment; when Leonidas re - captured power and
exiled Cleombrotus, Chilonis chose exile with her hus- band.”</p>
<p>Leonidas, to get the rich property of Agis’ widow into his family,
com - pelled her to marry his son Cleomenes. But Cleomenes fell in love
with his wife, and imbibed from her the ideas of the dead king. When he
came to the throne as Cleomenes III he resolved to carry out Agis’
reforms. Having won over the army by his courage in war, and the people
by the simplicity of his life, he abolished the oligarchic ephorate on
the ground that Lycurgus had never sanctioned it; he killed fourteen
resisters, exiled eighty, canceled all debts, divided the land among the
free population, and restored the Lycurgean discipline. Not content, he
set out to conquer the Peloponnese for the revolution. The proletariat
everywhere hailed him as a liberator, and many towns surrendered to him
gladly; he took Argos, Pellene, Phlius, Epidaurus, Hermione, Troezen, at
last even rich Corinth. The ferment of his program spread; in Boeotia
the payment of debts was abandoned, and the state appropriated funds to
appease the poor; in Megalopolis the philosopher Cercidas pled with the
rich to aid the needy before revolution destroyed all wealth.“ When
Cleomenes invaded Achaea and defeated Aratus all upper-class Greece
trembled for its prop-</p>
<p>570</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>erty. Aratus appealed to Macedonia. Antigonus Doson came down, over-
whelmed Cleomenes at Sellasia (221), and restored the oligarchic regime
in Lacedaemon. Cleomenes fled to Egypt, tried and failed to win the help
of Ptolemy III, tried and failed to rouse the Alexandrians to
revolution, and killed himself.“</p>
<p>The class war continued. A generation after Cleomenes the people of
Sparta overthrew the government, and set up a revolutionary
dictatorship. Philopoemen, who had succeeded Aratus as head of the
Achaean League, invaded Laconia, and restored the rule of property. As
soon as Philopoe- men had gone the people rose again, and set up Nabis
as dictator (207). Nabis was a Syrian Semite who had been captured in
war and sold into slavery at Megalopolis; smarting under suppressed
ability, he had revenged himself by organizing a revolt among the
Helots. Now he gave Spartan citizenship to aU freemen, and freed all the
Helots with one word. When the rich obstructed him he confiscated their
wealth and cut off their heads. The news of his doings went abroad, and
he found it a simple matter, with the help of the poorer classes, to
conquer Argos, Messenia, Elis, and part of Arcadia. Everywhere he
nationalized large estates, redistributed the land, and abolished
debts.“ The Achaean League, unable to overthrow him, appealed to Rome
for aid. Flamininus came, but Nabis offered so resolute a resistance
that the Roman accepted a truce by which Nabis was to release the
imprisoned rich, but would retain his power. At this juncture Nabis was
assassinated by an agent of the Aetolian League (192).“ Four years later
Philopoemen marched in again, propped up the oligarchs, abol- ished the
Lycurgean regimen, and sold three thousand of Nab is’ followers into
slavery. The revolution was ended, but so was Sparta; it continued to
exist, but it played no further part in the history of Greece.</p>
<p>V. THE ASCENDANCY OF RHODES</p>
<p>Frightened by the violence of faction and drawn by the movements of
popu- iation, trade and capital passed from the mainland and sought new
havens in the Aegean. Delos, once rich through Apollo, flourished in the
second century as a free port under the protection of Rome and the
management of Athens. The litde isle was crowded with alien merchants,
business ofiices, palaces and hovels, and the diverse temples of exotic
faiths.</p>
<p>Rhodes reached her zenith in the third century, and was then by
common consent the most civilized and beautiful city in Hellas. Strabo
described the great port as “so far superior to all others in harbors,
roads, walls, and improve -</p>
<p>GREECE AND MACEDON</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>571</p>
<p>merits that I am unable to speak of any other city as equal to it, or
even as almost equal to it.”“ Situated at one of the crossroads of the
Mediterranean, in a posi- tion to take advantage of that expanding trade
which Alexander’s conquests had made possible between Europe, Egypt, and
Asia, Rhodes’ spacious harbors re - placed Tyre and the Piraeus as a
port of reshipment for goods, and as a clearing- house for the
organization and financing of commerce in the eastern sea. Her merchants
established a profitable reputation for honesty, her banks and her
government for stability, in a world of treachery and change; her
powerful fleet, manned by her citizens, cleared the Aegean of pirates,
maintained an equal security for the merchant vessels of all nations,
and established a code of mari- time law so ably devised and so widely
accepted that it governed Mediterranean trade for centuries, and passed
down into the marine law of Rome, Constanti- nople, and Venice.</p>
<p>Having freed herself from Macedonian domination by her heroic
resistance.to Demetrius Poliorcetes (305), Rhodes steered successfully
through the troubled politics of the age by maintaining a wise
neutrality, or by going to war only to check the growth of an aggressor
state, or to preserve the freedom of the seas. She united many of the
Aegean cities in an “Island League,” and exercised her presidency so
fairly that no one questioned her right to lead. Her government — an
aristocracy resting on a democratic base as in republican Rome — ruled
the synoecized cities of Lindus, Camirus, lalysus, and Rhodes with skill
and com- parative justice, gave to alien residents such privileges as
Athens had never yielded to her metics, protected a large population of
slaves so well that when in danger it dared to arm them, and laid upon
the rich men of the city the obliga- tion to take care of the poor.“ The
state met its expenses by a two per cent tax upon imports and exports.
It lent money generously, sometimes without inter- est, to cities in
distress.</p>
<p>When Rhodes herself was physically ruined by an earthquake (225), all
the Greek world came to her aid, for everyone recognized that her
disappearance from the Aegean would lead to commercial and financial
chaos. Hieron II sent one hundred gold talents (00,000), and set up in
the restored city a statuary group showing the people of Rhodes being
crowned by the people of Syracuse. Ptolemy III sent three hundred
talents* of silver; Antigonus III sent three thou- sand, together with
great quantities of timber and pitch for building; his queen Chryseis
gave three thousand talents of lead, and 150,000 bushels of corn. Seleu-
cus III sent 300,000 bushels of com and ten fully equipped quinqueremes.
“As for the towns that contributed each according to its means,” says
Polybius, “it would be difficult to enumerate them.”“ It was a bright
interlude in the dark annals of political history, one of the rare
occasions when all the Greek world thought and acted as one.</p>
