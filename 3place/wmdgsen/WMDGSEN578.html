<h4 id="chapter-vlli">CHAPTER VllI</h4>
<p>The Great Rebellion</p>
<p>1625-49</p>
<p>I. THE CHANGING ECONOMY</p>
<p>T he revolution that enthroned Parliament and killed a king — 144</p>
<p>years before Eouis XVI atoned for his ancestry — had its roots in</p>
<p>economic conflict and religious rivalry.</p>
<p>Feudalism was an organization and dependency of agriculture;
monarchy, in Western Europe, was an organization and culmination of
feudalism; it was tied by its roots to an economy of landlords and land.
In England two economic developments cut these feudal roots. One was the
growth of the “gentry,” the untitled owners of minor estates, who, on
the land, ranked between the titled nobility and the yeomanry, or
peasant</p>
<p>proprietors. They fretted under a king, a court, and a code of
laws</p>
<p>still thinking or fashioned in feudal terms; they bought or
captured</p>
<p>seats in the House of Commons; they longed for a government
submissive to a Parliament submissive to themselves. The other
development was the expanding wealth of the bourgeoisie — ^bankers,
merchants, manu- facturers, lawyers, physicians — and its demand for
political representation commensurate with its economic power. These
revolutionary factors had no common interest; they collaborated only in
the attempt to check the pedigreed landlords, the snobbish court, and a
king who considered a hereditary aristocracy the necessary source of
economic and political order and stability.</p>
<p>Year by year the English economy was changing its base and fulcrum
from static land to movable money. Before 1540 a brass factory required
an investment of 00 (in United States currency of 1958); in 1620,</p>
<p>25,000. By 1650 capitalistic undertakings involving large outlays of
funds had developed alum factories in Yorkshire, paper manufactures at
Dartford, cannon foundries at Brendeley, and deep-level mines that were
called upon for more and more coal, copper, tin, iron, and lead. In 1550
only a few English mines produced more than 300 tons a year; in 1640
several gave 20,000 tons each. Artisans using metal depended on mining
and metallurgical industries concentrated under capitalistic control.
Tex- tile organizations furnished material to shops employing 500 to
1,000 workers, and to weavers and sewers scattered among thousands of
houses</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>in towns and villages. Agriculture itself was sharing in the
capitalistic conversion of production: capitalists bought and enclosed
large tracts of land to provide meat for the towns and wool for
factories at home and abroad. England’s foreign commerce grew tenfold
between 1610 and</p>
<ol start="1640" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Not in England’s memory had the gap been so wide between rich and
poor. “The laborer’s service sank to the worst scale of remuneration
during the first half of the seventeenth century, for the price of food
increas ed while wages remained stationary.”^ Taking 100 as a base, the
real wages of English carpenters stood at 300 about 1380, at 370 in
1480, at 200 under Elizabeth, at 120 under Charles I — ^the lowest in
four hundred years.* Unemployment was so great in 1634 that Charles
compelled the demolition of a newly erected mechanical sawmill because
it threw so many sawyers out of work.* War with France raised taxes, war
in France disrupted the export trade, bad harvests (1629-30) inflated
prices to the verge of starvation;* the swelling economy burst in
depressions (1629-32,</p>
<p>1638). All these factors collaborated with religious strife to drive
many English families to America, and to plunge England into a civil war
that changed the face and destiny of the nation.</p>
<p>The class war became also a conflict of regions and moral codes. The
north was overwhelmingly agricultural and largely Catholic, however
clandestinely; London and the south were increasingly industrial and
Protestant. The new business class, while cherishing its monopolies and
protective tariffs, demanded a free economy, in which wages and prices
would be determined by the supply of labor and goods; in which there
would be no feudal or governmental control of production, distribution,
profit, or property; and in which no stigma would be attached to com-
mercial occupations, the charging of interest, or the manipulation of
wealth. The barons and their peasants clung to the feudal concept of
mutual obligation and group responsibility, of state regulation of wages
and prices, of limits by custom and law to conditions of employment and
profit. The barons protested that the new mercantile economy, producing
for a national or international market, was disrupting class relations
and social stability. They (and the gentry and the government) felt
their own solvency threatened by the effects of inflation on the value
of the tradi- tional dues, rents, or taxes upon which they depended.
They looked with angry disdain upon the lawyers who shared so
prominently in administra- tion, and the merchants who ruled the cities.
They dreaded the power of mercantile London, which, with a population of
some 300,000 out of England’s 5,000,000, was able to finance an army and
a revolution.</p>

<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE RELIGIOUS CALDRON: 1 624-49</li>
</ol>
<p>The new King, raised in the old feudal and social code of the land,
and lost in the London of merchants and Puritans, was troubled beyond
pa- tience by the variety and the intensity of religious beliefs. The
right of individual judgment, which every new opinion preached until it
came to power, united with the spread of the Bible to encourage the
diversity of sects. One pamphleteer (1641) listed twenty-nine; another
(1646), 180. Besides the cleavage between Catholics and Protestants,
there was the tense division of Protestants into Anglicans,
Presbyterians, and Puritans, and of Puritans into Independents who
dreamed of a republic, Quakers who opposed war, violence, and oaths,
Millenarians — or Fifth Monarchy Men — ^who believed that Jesus would
soon come to establish His personal rule on earth, Antinomians who
argued that the elect of God were exempt from human laws, and Brownist
Separatists, and Seekers, and Ranters. A member of Parliament complained
that “mechanical men” (artisans) were setting up pulpits and preaching
their own hot brands of faith, many of them clothing economic or
political demands in Scriptural texts. And there were Anabaptists, who
administered baptism only to adults; and Baptists, who separated from
the Separatists (1606) and divided (1633) into General Baptists
rejecting, and Particular Baptists accepting, the Calvinist doctrine of
predestination.</p>
<p>The multiplication of sects, and their spirited debates, led a small
minor- ity to doubt all forms of Christianity. Bishop Fotherby mourned
(1622) that “the Scriptures (with many) have lost their authority, and
are</p>
<p>thought only fit for the ignorant and t he idiotic.”® And the
Reverend James Cranford (1646) spoke of “multitudes” who “have changed
their faith either to Skepticism … or Atheism, to believe nothing.”® A
pamphlet entitled Hell Broke Loose: A Catalogue of the Many Spreading
Errors, Heresies, and Blasphemies of These Times (1646) cited, as the
first heresy, the opinion “that the Scripture, whether a true manuscript
〔an authentic</p>
<ul>
<li>reveal〕 a divine God.”^ Another heresy declared that “right Reason
is the rule of Faith, and … we are to believe the Scriptures, and the
doc- trines of the Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection, so far as we see
them agreeable to reason, and no further.”® A large number of doubters
denied hell and the divinity of Christ. A growing number of thinkers,
who came to be called deists, sought a compromise between skepticism and
religion by proposing a Christianity confined to the belief in God and
immortality. Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, gave this via media a
philosophical formulation in a remarkable essay on truth, De veritate
(1624). Truth,</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP, vm) THE GREAT REBELLION 187</p>
<p>said Herbert, is independent of Scripture, and cannot be decreed by a
church or any other authority. The best test of truth is universal
assent. Consequently the wisest religion would be a “natural” rather
than a re - vealed religion, and would limit itself to doctrines
generally accepted by the different creeds: that there is a Supreme
Being, that He should be worshiped chiefly by virtuous living, and that
good conduct will be</p>
<p>rewarded, and bad conduct punished, either here or in a life
hereafter. Herbert, says Aubrey, died “serenely,” after being refused
the sacra - ments.®</p>
<p>Parliament was more worried about Catholicism than about heresy. In
1634 the Catholics in England were probably a quarter of the popula-
tion,^® and, despite all laws and perils, there were still some 335
Jesuits there.^^ Prominent nobles accepted the old faith. George
Calvert, Lord Baltimore, announced his conversion in 1625; in 1632
Charles gave him a charter to found the colony that became Maryland. The
Catholic Queen, Henrietta Maria, sent an emissary to Rome (1633) to
solicit a cardinal’s hat for a British subject. The Anglican King
offered to allow a Catholic bishop to reside in England if Urban VIII
would support Charles’s plan for some diplomatic marriages (1634); the
Pope refused. The Catholics called for religious tolerance, but
Parliament — remembering Catholic in- tolerance, the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew, and the Gunpowder Plot, and loath to risk inquiry into
Protestant titles to once Catholic property — demanded instead the full
enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. A str ong “no popery” sentiment,
especially in the gentry and the middle class, opposed alike the. influx
of Catholic priests into England and the growing approximation of
Anglican to Catholic ritual and thought.</p>
<p>The Established Church enjoyed the full protection of the state. The
Anglican creed and worship were legally compulsory; even the Thirty-
nine Articles were made law of the land (1628). The Anglican bishops
claimed the Apostolic Succession — ^that is, that they had been ordained
by an Apostle; and they rejected the Presbyterian and Puritan assertion
that others than bishops might validly ordain a minister. Many Anglican
ecclesiastics in this age were men of great learning and good will.
James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, was a real scholar despite his
famous calculation (in his Annales Veteris Testamenti, 1650) that God
had</p>
<p>created the world on October 22, 4004 b.c. — i chronological slip
that was made semiofficial in editions of the Authorized Version.*® John
Hales, chaplain to an English embassy in Holland, preached doubt,
reason, and toleration:</p>
<p>The ways that lead us to . . . any knowledge … are but two:
first,</p>
<p>experience, secondly ratiocination. They that come and tell you
what</p>
<p>i88</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Aall</p>
<p>to believe, what you are to do, and tell you not why, they are
not</p>
<p>physicians but leeches . . . The chiefest sinew and strength of
wisdom is not easily to believe. . . . Those things which we reverence
for</p>
<p>antiquity, what were they at their first birth? Were they false? Time
cannot make them more true. The circumstance of time … is merely
impertinent … It is not the variety of opinions but our own perverse
wills — ^who think it meet that all should be conceited 〔of the same
thought〕 as ourselves are — ^which hath so inconvenienced the Church.
Were we not so ready to anathematize each other where we concur not in
opinion, we might in hearts be united . . . Two parts there are that do
completely make up a Christian man — a true faith and an</p>
<p>honest conversation 〔conduct〕. The first, though it seems the
worthier, and gives us the name of Christians, yet the second, in the
end, will</p>
<p>prove the surer . . . There is no kind of man . . . though he be
an</p>
<p>heathen and idolater, unto whom the skirts of Christian compassion do
not reach.^*</p>
<p>Hale’s generosity was not reciprocated by some “idolaters.” A Jesuit,
writing under the name “Edward Knott” a tract entitled Charity Mis -
taken (1630), maintained that, barring accidents, no Protestant could be
saved.^* The condemned were reassured by William Chillingworth, whose
The Religion of Protestants a Safe Way to Salvation (1637)</p>
<p>standing theological treatise of the time. Chillingworth knew both
sides: he had been converted to Catholicism, had returned to
Protestantism, and still had his reservations; he had, said Clarendon,
“contracted such a habit of doubting that by degrees he grew confident
of nothing, and a skeptic, at least, in the greatest mysteries of
religion.”^®</p>
<p>The most eloquent of these Caroline Anglicans was Jeremy Taylor. His
sermons are still readable, and more moving than Bossuet’s; even a
French - man has been stirred by them.^® Taylor was an ardent Royalist,
a chaplain in the army of Charles I. When the Presbyterians and the
Puritans con- trolled Parliament and abused the once intolerant
Anglicans intolerantly, he issued The Liberty of Prophesying (1646), a
timid call for toleration: any Christian who accepted the Apo stles’
Creed should be received within the amity of the Church, and Catholics
were to be left free unless they insisted on papal sovereignty over
England and kings.* Taylor was cap- tured and imprisoned by the
Parliamentary party in the Civil War, but after the Restoration he was
raised to the episcopacy, and his ardor for toleration cooled.</p>
<p>The growing influence of Catholicism appeared in the predominant</p>
<p>Anglican of the age. William Laud was a man of ideas and will, born
to</p>
<p>•In 1631, in Massachu setts Bay Colony, Roger Williams advocated
unlimited toleration for Catholics, Jews, and infidels.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>rule or die, strictly virtuous, severely strict, and resolute to the
point of irascible inflexibility. Like a good churchman, he took it for
granted that a unifled religious belief was indispensable to successful
government, and that a complex ceremonial was necessary for a
tranquilizing and effectual faith. To the sorrow of Presbyterians and
Puritans, he proposed to recall the arts to the service of the Church,
to beautify the altar, the pulpit, and the baptismal font, to restore
the cross to the ritual and the surplice to the priest. As a special
mountain of offense, he ordered the Communion table, which heretofore
had been placed in the center of the chancel (where it had sometimes
served as a hat stand), to be put behind a railing at the eastern end of
the church. These changes were mostly a revival of Eliza- bethan customs
and laws, but to the Puritans, who loved simplicity, they represented a
backsliding to Catholicism and the renewal of a class separa- tion
between priest and congregation. Laud seems to have felt that the
Catholic Church was right in surrounding religion with ceremony and
endowing the priest with an aura of sanctity.^^ The Roman Church appre-
ciated his views, even to offering him a cardinal’s hat.^® He
courteously refused, but the offer appeared to support the reproaches of
the Puritans. They called him the forerunner of Antichrist. Charles made
him Arch- bishop of Canterbury (1633) and a commissioner of the
treasury. Another archbishop was made Chancellor of Scotland. People
complained that ecclesiastics were returning to political power, as in
the heyday of the medieval Church.</p>
<p>From his Lambeth Palace the new Primate of All England set himself to
remolding English ritual and morals. He made a hundred new enemies by
levying, through the Court of High Commission (a judiciary body</p>
<p>set up by Elizabeth, and now predominantly ecclesiastical), severe
fines from persons convicted of adultery; and the victims found little
comfort in his devoted use of the fines to repair the decaying
St. Paul’s Cathedral</p>
<p>The brutality of the punishments exacted under Laud’s regime must be
visualized to understand his fate. In 1628, at his instigation, a
Puritan minister, Alexander Leighton, was indicted before the Star
Chamber as the admitted author of a book that called the institution of
bishops anti- Christian and Satanic. He was put in irons and was kept in
solitary con- finement for fifteen weeks in an unheated cell “full of
rats and mice, an d open to snow and rain.” His hair fell out, his skin
peeled off. He was tied to a stake and received thirty-six stripes with
a heavy cord upon his naked</p>

<p>back; he was placed in the pillory for two hours in November’s frost
and snow; he was branded in the face, had his nose slit and his ears cut
off, and was condemned to life imprisonment.<em>® In 1633 Ludowyc
Bowyer, who had charged Laud with being a Catholic at heart, was fined,
branded, mutilated, and sentenced to imprisonment for life.</em>^
William Prynne, fire- brand of the Puritans, in News from Ipswich (1636)
denounced Laud’s bishops as servants of the pope and the Devil, and
recommended hanging for bishops; he was branded on both cheeks, had his
ears cut off, and was jailed till the Long Parliament freed him (1640).
A woman who in- sisted on keeping Saturday as the Sabbath was imprisoned
for eleven years.**</p>
<p>Laud’s chief enemies, the Puritans, agr eed with him on the necessity
of intolerance. They thought it a reasonable conclusion from the divine
origin of Christianity and the Scriptures; anyone who opposed a faith so
founded must be a criminal or a fool, and society should be protected
from the many damnations that would follow from his teaching. The
Presbyterians pleaded with Parliament (1648) to legislate life imprison-
ment for all who continued to teach Catholic, Arminian, Baptist, or
Quaker views, and death for all who denied the doctrines of the Trinity
or the Incarnation. Cromwell’s Independents, however, offered toleration
to all who would accept the fundamentals of Christianity, but they
excluded Catholics, Unitarians, and defenders of prelacy.*®</p>
<p>There were so many parties among the Puritans that it is a rare
general- ization that can hold of them all. Most of them adhered to a
strict Calvin- ism, to individual political liberty, to the right of
congregations to run their own affairs without episcopal supervision,
and to a worship uncere- monious, egalitarian, and divorced from the
distractions of religious art. They agreed with the Presbyterians in
theology, but rejected presbyteries as tending to exercise episcopal
power. They insisted on a literal inter- pretation of Scripture, and
condemned the pretense of reason to sit in judgment on revealed truth.
They attached as much reverence to the Old Testament as to the New; they
applied to themselves the Judaic conception of the chosen people; they
baptized their children with the names of Old Testament patriarchs and
heroes; they thought of God in terms of a stem Yahveh, and added the
Calvinistic conviction that most men were the “children of wrath,”
doomed before their birth, by the arbitr ary will of a relentless deity,
to everlasting hell; and they ascribed the salvation of the few “elect”
not to good works but to divine grace granted at divine whim. Some of
them thought they talked to God; some, thinking them- selves damned,
went about the streets groaning in anticipation of their eternal
sufferings. The thunderbolts of God seemed always to hang over the heads
of men.</p>
<p>CHAP. Vin) THE GREAT REBELLION 191</p>
<p>In this self- imposed Terror “Merrie England” almost disappeared. The
humanism of the Renaissance, the lusty naturalism of the Elizabethans,
yielded to a sense of sin, a fear of divine vengeance, which looked upon
most pleasures as wiles of Satan and challenges to God. The old monastic
fears of the flesh returned, perhaps to a larger proportion of the
people than ever in known history before. Prynne declared all embraces
“lewd,” all mixed dancing “lascivious.”^® To most Puritans music,
stained glass, religious images, surplices, anointed priests were
obstacles to direct com- munion with God. They studied the Bible with
devoted diligence and quoted its phrases in nearly every speech, in
almost every paragraph; some zealots embroidered their clothing with
Scriptural texts; the espe- cially godly added “Verily” or “Yea, verily”
to attest sincerity or truth. Good Puritans prohibited the use of
cosmetics and banned hairdressing as vanity; they earned the nickname
“Roundheads” because they cut their hair close to the head. They
denounced the theater as scandalous (it was), the baiting of bears and
bulls as barbarous, the morals of the court as pagan. They condemned
festival jollities, ringing bells, gathering around the Maypole,
drinking healths, playing cards. They forbade all games whatever on the
Sabbath; that day was to be kept for God, and it was no longer to bear
the heathen name Sunday. They — Milton among them — cried out in anger
when Charles I and Laud, renewing an edict of</p>
<p>James I, issued (1633) a “Declaration of Sports” sanctioning Sunday
games after Sunday prayers. The Puritans extended their Sabbatarianism —
the advocacy of blue Sundays — to Christmas; they lamented the style of
celebrating the birth of Christ with merrymaking, dancing, and games;
they rightly ascribed many Christmas customs to pagan origins; they de-
manded that Christmas should be made a solemn day of fasting and atone-
ment; and in 1644 they prevailed upon Parliament to sanction this view
by law.</p>
<p>As Protestantism had stressed the sermon beyond Catholic precedent,
so Puritanism expanded it even beyond Protestant custom. A hunger for
sermons gnawed at some hearts; the mayor of Norwich moved to London to
hear more preaching; a mercer resigned from a congregation because it
provided only one sermon per Sunday. Special “lecturers” arose to ease
this hunger — laymen hired by a parish to preach a Sunday sermon addi-
tional to what the regular minister offered. Most Puritan preachers took
their function with high seriousness; they terrified their audiences
with descriptions of hell; some of them denounced sinners publicly by
name; one pointed out the drunkards in his congregation and, talking of
whores, specified as an example the wife of a chief parishioner; another
told his auditors that if adultery, swearing, cheating, and Sabbath
breaking could lead a man to heaven, the whole parish would be saved.®^

<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>ministers felt it their duty to prescribe or proscribe the conduct,
dress, studies, and amusements of the people. They forbade the
observance of the holydays established by pagan custom or the Catholic
Church, and so added some fifty working days to the year.<em>® A call to
duty sounded throughout the Puritan ethic, and with it a stem
inculcation of courage, self-reliance, pmdence, thrift, and work. It was
an ethic congenial to the middle class; it made for industrious workers
and gave a religious sanction to mercantile enterprise and private
property. Poverty, not wealth, was a sin; it revealed lack of personal
character and divine grace.</em>®</p>
<p>Politically, the Puritans aspired to a democratic theocracy in
which</p>
<p>there would be none but moral and religious distinctions among men,
no ru ler but Christ, no law but God’s Word. They resented the heavy
taxes that supported the Anglican Church; their businessmen felt
themselves milked by that expensive and superior Establishment; the
“trading part of a nation,” said one pamphleteer, “is devoured in this
Prelatical Gulph.”®® The Puritans defended wealth, but scorned the idle
luxury of the nobility. They carried morality to excess, as later ages
carried liberty; but perhaps their inhuman code was a necessary
corrective to the loose morals of Elizabethan England. They produced
some of the strongest characters in history — Cromwell and Milton, and
the men who conquered the Ameri- can wilderness. They defended and
transmitted to us parliamentary gov- ernment and trial by jury. To them,
in part, England owes the solid</p>
<p>sobriety of the British character, the stability of the British
family, and the integrity of Britain’s ofiicial life. Nothing is
lost.</p>

<li>THE puritans AND THE THEATER</li>
</ol>
<p>The first victory of the Puritans was in their war against the
theater. Everything that distinguished them — their theology of “elect”
and “repro - bate,” their strict morality, their sdlemn mood and
Biblical speech — had been ridiculed on the stage with gross and
unforgivable caricature. And in 1629 came the culminating crime; a
French actress dared to replace a boy in taking a female part in a play
at the Blackfriars. She was pelted with apples and rotten eggs.</p>
<p>The new dramatists might have appeased the Puritan party, for, though
now and then they stooped to conquer the groundlings with ribaldry, by
and large they were gentlemen. Philip Massinger’s A New Way to Pay Old
Debts (1625) satirized not prim virtue but monopolistic greed; there was
no soaring poetry in it, no crackling wit, no winging imagery; but the
unscrupulous extortioner was brought to justice in the end, and five
acts transpired without a trull. John Ford angled for an audience by

<p>titling a play ’Tw Pity She’s a Whore, b ut this and The Broken
Heart</p>
<p>(both 1633) kept a decent pitch, and might still hold the boards if
modern audiences could stomach the holocausts of their denouements.</p>
<p>The Puritans fired their hottest shot against the theater when their
most fearless protagonist, William Prynne, sent to the press (1632) his
Histrio- mastix, the Players Scourge. Prynne was a lawyer and made no
claim to impartiality; he presented a thousand-page brief for the
plaintiff. By quo- tations from the Bible, from the Fathers of the
Church, and even from the pagan philosophers, he proved that the drama
had been invented by Satan and had begun as a form of devil worship.
Most plays are blasphemous and obscene, full of amorous embraces, wanton
gestures, and lust-arousing music, song, and dance; all dancing is
devilish, and its every pace is a step to hell; most actors are profane
and godless criminals. “The Church of God, not the playhouse, is the
only ‘proper’ school; the Scriptures, sermons, and devout and pious
books … are the only lectures” (reading) fit for Christians. And if they
need diversion,</p>
<p>they have the several prospects of the sun, the moon, the
planets,</p>
<p>the stars, with all the infinite variety of creatures, to delight
their</p>
<p>eyes. They have music of all birds … to please their ears; the
in-</p>
<p>comparably delicate odoriferous scents and perfumes of all herbs,</p>
<p>all flowers, fruits to refresh their noses; the savoury tastes of all
edible creatures . . . the pleasures that orchards, rivers, gardens,
ponds,</p>
<p>woods . . . can afford them; the comfort of friends, kindred,
hus-</p>
<p>bands, wives, children, possessions, wealth, and all other
external</p>
<p>blessings that God hath bestowed upon them.®^</p>
<p>The argument was learned and eloquent, but it called all
actresses</p>
<p>whores, and the Queen had just imported some actresses from France
and was herself rehearsing a part in a court masque. Henrietta Maria
took offense, and Laud indicted Prynne for seditious libel. The author ,
pro- tested that he had had no intention of libeling the Queen; he
apologized for the intemperance of his book; nevertheless, with a
severity which the Puritans long remembered, he was debarred from the
practice of law, was fined the impossible sum of £ 5,000 (50,000?), and
was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was placed in the pillory, and
both his ears were cut off.®* From his prison he issued News from
Ipswich (1636), in which he denounced Anglican prelates as devilish
traitors and ravenous wolves, and recommended that these bishops be
hanged. He was pilloried again, and the stumps of his ears were shorn
away. He remained in jail until the Long Parliament freed him in
1640.</p>
<p>In 1642 the Parliament ordered all the theaters of England
closed.</p>
<p>This was at first a war measure, apparently limited to “these
calamitous times,” but it remained in force till 1656. The long career

<p>There were at least two men in England who could look out upon the
seething scene with perspective and calm. John Selden was so learned
that men said, “Quod Seldenm nescit nemo seif’ — What Selden does not
know, nobody knows. As an antiquarian he collected state records of pre-
Norman England and compiled an authoritative Titles of Honor (1614); as
an Orientalist he made a European reputation with his study of poly-
theism, De diis Syris (1617); as a jurist he expounded rabbinical law
and wrote a History of Tythes refuting the claim of the divine origin of
tithes; as an M.P. he took part in impeaching Buckingham and Laud and in
draw- ing up the Petition of Right; he was twice imprisoned. He attended
the Westminster Assembly as a lay delegate “to see wild asses fight,”
and pleaded</p>
<p>recorded by his secretary, became an English classic. Shall we sample
him?</p>
<p>’Tis a vain thing to talk of an heretic, for a man can think no other
-</p>
<p>wise than he does think. In the primitive times there were many</p>
<p>opinions. One of these being embraced by some prince . . . the
rest</p>
<p>were condemned as heresies . . . No man is the wiser for his
learning; it may administer matter to work in . . . but wit

<p>wisdom are bom with a man . . . Wise men say nothing in dangerous
times. The lion . . . called the sheep to ask her if his breath
smelled;</p>
<p>she said Yes; he bit off her head for a fool. He called the wolf
and</p>
<p>asked him; he said No; he tore him to pieces for a flatterer. At
last</p>
<p>he called the fox, and asked him. Why 〔said the fox〕, he had got
a</p>
<p>cold and could not smell.*®</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne was a fox. Born in London (1605), educated at</p>
<p>Winchester School, Oxford, Montpellier, Padua, and Leiden, absorbing
arts and sciences and history at every turn, he resigned himself to the
practice of medicine at Norwich. He sublimated his uroscopies by jotting
down his ideas de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis (“on all things and a
few others”), and eloquently concealed his theology in Religio medici
(1642), one of the milestones in English prose. Here is a British Mon-
taigne, quite as quaint and fanciful, as undulant and diverse, perhaps
bor- rowing from him in the pages of friendship,®^ subordinating his
skepti- cism to conformity, relishing reason and professing faith,
congested with classical allusions and derivatives, but loving the art
and the music of words, and using style as “the antiseptic of
decay.”</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII )</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>He was by education inclined to doubt. His longest work, Pseudodoxia
epidemica (1646), explained and chastised hundreds of “false opinions
epidemic” in Europe — that a carbuncle gives light in the dark, that an
elephant has no joints, that the phoenix regenerates itself from its own
ashes, that the salamander can live in fire, that the unicorn has a
horn, that swans sing before their death, that the forbidden fruit was
an apple, that “the toad pisseth and this way diffuseth its venom.”<em>®
But, like every iconoclast, he had his icons. He accepted angels,
demons, palmistry, and witches;</em>® in 1664 he shared in the
condemnation as witches of two women, who were soon thereafter hanged
protesting their innocence.*^</p>
<p>He had no fancy for women, and thought sex ridiculous:</p>
<p>I was never yet once, and commend their resolutions who never</p>
<p>marry twice … I could be content that we might procreate like</p>
<p>trees, without conjunction, or that there were any way to perpetuate
the world without this trivial and vulgar way of union; it is the</p>
<p>foolishest act a wise man commits in all his life; nor is there
anything that w ill more deject his cool’d imagination, when he shall
consider</p>
<p>what an odd and unworthy piece of folly he hath committed.*®</p>
<p>As to his titular topic, he is apologetically Christian:</p>
<p>For my religion, though there be several circumstances that might</p>
<p>persuade the world I have none at all (as the general scandal of
my</p>
<p>profession, the natural course of my studies, the indifferency of
my</p>
<p>behavior and discourse in matters of religion, neither violently
de-</p>
<p>fending one, nor with that common ardor and contention opposing</p>
<p>another), yet, in despite hereof, I dare without usurpation the
honor- able style of Christian. Not that I merely owe this title to the
font,</p>
<p>my education, or the clime wherein I was born . . . but having in</p>
<p>my riper years and confirmed judgment seen and examined all.*®</p>
<p>He feels that the marvels and the order of the world declare a divine
mind — “nature is the art of God.”^® He confesses to having
entertained</p>
<p>In his later years he was moved to meditation on death by the
unearth- ing of some ancient sepulchral urns in Norfolk, and he recorded
his</p>
<p>thoughts in a desultory masterpiece of English prose, Hydriotaphia,
Urne- Buriall (1658). He recommends cremation as the least vain method
of</p>

<p>(chap. VHI</p>
<p>disencumbering the earth of ourselves. “Life is a pure flame, and we
live by an invisible Sun within us”; but we flicker out with ignominious
haste. “Generations pass while some trees stand, and old families last
not three</p>
<p>Bless me in this life with but peace of my conscience, command</p>
<p>of my affections, the love of Thyself and my dearest friends, and
I</p>
<p>shall be happy enough to pity Caesar. These are, O Lord, the humble
desires of my most reasonable ambition, and all I dare call happiness on
earth; wherein I set no rule or limit to thy Hand or Providence.</p>

<p>V. CAROLINE POETRY</p>
<p>Meanwhile a bevy of minor bards — each of whom is someone’s major
love — amused the leisurely with amorous rhymes and tuneful piety; and
because the King Kked them and they sang his cause through all
vicissitudes, history knows them as the Cavalier Poets. Robert Herrick
apprenticed his pen to Ben Jonson, and thought for a time that a bowl of
wine would make a book of verse; he drank to Bacchus for hours on end,
and then studied for the ministry. He took courses in love, pledged
himself to prefer mistresses to marriage,^® and counseled virgins to
“gather rosebuds” while they bloomed. His “Corinna” received further
prodding:</p>
<p>Get up, get up for shame! The blooming mom</p>
<p>Upon her wings presents the god unshorn.</p>
<p>See how Aurora throws her fair</p>
<p>Fresh-quilted colors through the air;</p>
<p>Get up, sweet Slug-a-bed, and see</p>
<p>The dew bespangling herb and tree …</p>
<p>Come, let us go, while we are in our prime.</p>
<p>And take the harmless folly of the time!</p>
<p>We shall grow old apace, and die</p>
<p>Before we know our liberty . . .</p>
<p>Then while time serves, and we are but decaying.</p>
<p>Come, my Corinna, come, let’s go a -Maying.^^</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>And so in many of the wanton poems that he published in 1648 in the
collection Hesperides; even in our loose days they need expurgation to
suit Everyman. But eating is also necessary, so Herrick left his beloved
London (1629), and — taking Catullus with him — ^went sorrowfully to be
vicar of a modest parsonage in distant Devonshire. Soon he began to
write Noble Numbers, or Pious Pieces, and first a prayer for
absolution:</p>
<p>For those my unbaptised rhymes,</p>
<p>Writ in my wild unhallowed times,</p>
<p>For every sentence, clause, and word.</p>
<p>That’s not inlaid with Thee (my Lord),</p>
<p>Forgive me, God, and blot each line</p>
<p>Out of my book that is not Thine.^*</p>
<p>In 1647 the Puritans deprived him of his benefice. He starved loyally
through the dour days of the Commonwealth, but was restored by the
Restoration to his vicarage, and died there at eighty-four, Corinna lost
in the dusk of memory.</p>
<p>Thomas Carew did not live so long, but he too found time for mis-</p>
<p>tresses. Drunk with the inexplicable charms of woman, he sang them in
such rapt detail (“A Rapture”), and with such cavalier contempt for</p>
<p>chastity, that other poets reproved him for his licentious
exactitude. The Puritans could not forgive Charles I for making him a
gentleman of the privy chamber, but perhaps the King pardoned the matter
for the form; in these Caroline poets all the Gallic finesse of Ronsard
and the Pleiade is imported to grace with delicate art the indelicacies
of desire.</p>
<p>Sir John Suckling crowded much living into his thirty-three
years.</p>
<p>Born in 1609, he inherited a great fortune at eighteen, made the
Grand Tour, was knighted by Charles I, fought under Gustavus Adolphus in
the Thirty Years’ War, returned to England (1632) to become by his</p>
<p>good looks, his wit, and his generous wealth a favorite at the court.
He was, says Aubrey, “the greatest gallant of his time, and the greatest
game - ster, both for bowling and cards . . . His sisters would come to
the . . . bowling green, crying for fear he should lose all their
portions.”^® He invented cribbage. He never married, but entertained “a
great number of ladies of quality”; at one party he served the ladies,
as des sert, silk stock- ings, then a great luxury.®® His play Aglaura
was produced with lavish scenery, paid for from his purse. He raised his
own troops to fight for the King and risked his life in an attempt to
rescue the King’s minister. Sir Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford,
from the Tower. Frustrated, he fled to the Continent, and there,
deprived of his fortune, he took poison and died.</p>
<p>Richard Lovelace too served the King in war and verse, and he too</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>was rich and handsome, “the most amiable and beautiful person that
ever eye beheld”®^ — so Anthony a Wood saw him at Oxford. In 1642 he
headed a delegation from Kent to petition the Long Parliament
(transiently</p>
<p>Presbyterian) for the restoration of the Anglican liturgy. For this
audacious orthodoxy he was imprisoned for seven weeks. His Althea came
to com- fort him, and he made her immortal with a line:</p>
<p>When Love with unconfined wings</p>
<p>Hovers within my gates.</p>
<p>And my divine Althea brings</p>
<p>To whisper at the grates;</p>
<p>When I lie tangled in her hair</p>
<p>And fettered to her eye,</p>
<p>The birds that wanton in the air</p>
<p>Know no such liberty. . . .</p>
<p>Stone walls do not a prison make.</p>
<p>Nor iron bars a cage;</p>
<p>Minds innocent and quiet take</p>
<p>That for an hermitage;</p>
<p>If I have freedom in my love</p>
<p>And in my soul am free,</p>
<p>Angels alone, that soar above,</p>
<p>Enjoy such liberty</p>
<p>He went off to the wars again in 1645 — and apologized to his
betrothed (Lucy Sacheverell) in “To Lucasta, Going to the Wars”:</p>
<p>Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind</p>
<p>That from the nunnery</p>
<p>Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind</p>
<p>To war and arms I fly. . . .</p>
<p>Yet this inconstancy is such</p>
<p>As thou too shalt adore;</p>
<p>I could not love thee, dear, so much.</p>
<p>Loved I not honour more.®^</p>
<p>On the false report of his death in battle, Lucasta (chaste Lucy)
mar- ried another suitor. Having lost both his lady and his fortune in
the</p>
<p>Royalist cause, Lovelace was reduced to depend upon the charity of
his friends for food, and he who had worn cloth of silver and gold
now</p>
<p>dressed in rags and lived in slums. He died of consumption in 1658,
aged forty.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>He might have learned the art of survival from Edmund Waller, who
managed to be active for sixty years on both sides of the Great
Rebellion, became the most popular poet of his time, outlived Milton,
and died in bed at eighty-one (1687). He entered Parliament at sixteen,
went mad at twenty-three, recovered, married a London heiress at
twenty-five, buried her three years later, and soon wooed “Sacharissa”
(Lady Dorothy Sidney) with a fresh variant of an ancient theme:</p>
<p>Go, lovely Rose!</p>
<p>Tell her, that wastes her time and me.</p>
<p>That now she knows,</p>
<p>When I resemble her to thee,</p>
<p>How sweet and fair she seems to be.</p>
<p>Tell her, that’s young.</p>
<p>And shuns to have her graces spied.</p>
<p>That hadst thou sprung</p>
<p>In deserts, where no men abide.</p>
<p>Thou must have unrecommended died. . . .</p>
<p>Then die! that she</p>
<p>The common fate of all things rare</p>
<p>May read in thee;</p>
<p>How small a part of time they share</p>
<p>That are so wondrous sweet and fair!</p>
<p>One other hardly minor poet enters this period. Richard Crashaw
burned with religious ardor rather than with the fevers of the flesh.
His father, an Anglican clergyman, wrote tracts against Catholicism and
filled his son with fears of popery; Richard became a Catholic. He was
expelled from Cambridge (1644) for supporting the King; he fled from
England to</p>
<p>Paris, where he consoled his poverty with visions of God. The Spanish
mystics were to him a revelation of religious intensity and devotion.
Stand- ing before a picture of St. Teresa, he envied her transfixion by
the dart of Christ, and begged her to accept him as her selfless
disciple:</p>
<p>By the full kingdom of that final kiss</p>
<p>That seized thy parting soul, and sealed thee His;</p>
<p>By all the heavens thou hast in Him</p>
<p>(Fair sister of the seraphim);</p>
<p>By all of Him we have in thee.</p>
<p>Leave nothing of myself in me.</p>
<p>Let me so read thy life that I</p>
<p>Unto all life of mine may die.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VIH</p>
<p>This and other poems he gave to the world in Steps to the Temple</p>
<p>(1646), an ambivalent mixture of pious ecstasies and poetic conceits.
Through him and a like but later poet, Henry Vaughan, we perceive that
not all England was in those hectic days divided into Puritans and Cava-
liers, but that amid the fury of poetical and theological war some
spirits found religion neither in massive shrines and hypnotic ritual,
nor in fearful dogmas and proud election, but in the childlike, trustful
communion of the baffled and surrendering soul with a humane and
forgiving God.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>CHARLES I VERSUS PARLIAMENT: 1 62 5-29</li>
</ol>
<p>And now this tragic King over whom all England was to fight, what</p>
<p>sort of man and monarch was he? Before the storm soured the milk of
human kindness in him, he was a reasonably good man — a loving son, an
unusually faithful husband, a loyal friend, a father idolized by his
chil- dren. He had begun the struggle of life by fighting a congenital
weakness of physique; he could not walk till he was seven. He overcame
this defect by resolute pursuit of vigorous sports, until in maturity he
could ride and hunt with the best. He suffered from an impediment of
speech; until ten he could hardly speak intelligibly; his father thought
of having an operation performed on the boy’s tong ue. Charles gradually
improved, but to the end of his life he stammered and had to counter his
difficulty by speaking slowly.®^ When his popular brother Henry died,
leaving him heir apparent, Charles was suspected of complicity in the
death; the charge was unjust, but it shared in darkening the Prince’s
mood. He preferred a studious solitude to the bibulous hilarity of his
father’s court. He became</p>
<p>Charles’s parentage and marriage contributed to his ruin. He
inherited his father’s conception of the royal prerogative as absolute,
with power to make as well as administer laws, to rule without
Parliament, and to override laws enacted by Parliament. This view seemed
justified by prece- dents and was taken for granted in France and Spain;
it was encouraged</p>
<p>CHAP, vin)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>in Charles by Buckingham, the court, and the Queen. Henrietta Maria
had been reared at the French court in the very days •when Richelieu was
making her brother Louis XIII absolute over everybody but Richelieu. She
had come to England as an avowed Catholic, bringing priests in her
bridal train, and her faith had been made more intense by the
disabilities she saw it suffer there. She had all the allure of beauty,
vivacity, and wit, and the fuU Medicean flair for politics. Inevitably
she urged her devoted husband to alleviate the lot of English Catholics;
doubtless she dreamed of converting the King himself. She gave him six
children; it must have cost him many a struggle to resist her wish that
they might be brought up Catholic. But he had developed a sincere
attachment to the Anglican Church, and he realized that his England was
predominantly Protestant and hostile to a threatening papacy.</p>
<p>Charles’s first Parliament met on June i8, 1625. One hundred lords —
peers and bishops — ^sat in the upper house; five hundred men, three
fourths of them Puritan,®® had been elected to the Commons by various
forms of financial or pohtical skulduggery;®* there was no pretense of
democracy. Probably the level of ability in this Parliament was higher
than an adult suffrage would have returned; here were Coke, Selden, Pym,
Sir John Eliot, Sir’Thomas Wentworth, and others marked for history. The
total - plained that taxes had been levied without its consent; it was
resolved to compel hereafter an annual summoning of Parliament and an
annual examination, by ParUament, of governmental expenditures. Charles
took umbrage at these economies and intentions, and when plague
threatened London he seized the excuse to dissolve the Parliament
(August 12, 1625).</p>
<p>The government was now in the hands of Buckingham. Charles had not
merely inherited the amiable, reckless Duke from his father; he had been
brought up with him, had traveled with him, in a companionship that made
it difficult for the King to see in his friend an unwise and disastrous
counse- lor. Buckingham, with the support of Parliament, had led James
into war with Spain; Parliament now refused to finance the war. The Duke
or-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VHI</p>
<p>ganized an armada to go out and capture Spanish spoils or ports; it
failed utterly, and the returning soldiers, unpaid and demoralized,
spread rape, robbery, and defeatism in the coastal towns.</p>
<p>Desperate for funds, Charles resigned himself to calling his second
Parlia- ment. The opposition grew stronger with his needs. The House
warned him not to levy taxes without parliamentary sanction. Eliot, once
a friend of the Duke, excoriated him as a corrupt incompetent who had
grown richer with each failure of strategy or policy. Parliament
appointed a com- mittee to investigate Buckingham; Charles rebuked it,
saying, “I would not have the House to question my servants, much less
one that is so near me.” Eliot advised Parliament to withhold any grant
of funds until the King admitted its right to demand the removal of a
minister; Charles angrily re- minded Parliament that he could at any
time dismiss it; the Commons re- plied by formally impeaching Buckingham
— accusing him of treason and demanding his dismissal (May 8, 1626); it
informed the King that until this was done it would grant no funds. The
King dissolved the Parliament (June 15). The issue of ministerial
responsibility was left to the future.</p>
<p>But Charles was again destitute. A large quantity of royal plate was
sold. “Free benevolences” — gifts to the King — ^were asked of the
country; the yield was slight; British money was pro-Parliament. Charles
ordered his agents to collect tonnage and poundage dues despite lack of
Parliamentary consent, and to seize the goods of merchants who failed to
pay; he com- manded the ports to maintain the fleet; he allowed his
agents to impress men into military service. English and Danish troops,
fighting for Protes- tantism in Germany, were being overwhelmed by the
Imperialists; Eng- land’s Danish allies demanded the subsidy she had
promised them. Charles ordered a forced loan — every taxpayer was to
lend the government one per cent of the value of his land, five per cent
of the worth of his personal property. Rich opponents were jailed, poor
opponents were hustled into the army or the navy. Meanwhile English
merchants delivered materials at Bordeaux and La Rochelle to Huguenots
embattled with Richelieu; France declared war on England (1627).
Buckingham led a fleet to attack the French at La Rochelle; the
expedition failed. The ^ 200,000 raised by the loan was soon spent, and
Charles was again at his money’s end. He summoned his third
Parliament.</p>
<p>It met on March 17, 1628. Coke, Eliot, Wentworth, and John Hampden
were returned, and, for the first time, Huntingdon Borough sent up a
sturdy squire named Oliver Cromwell. Charles, in his speech from the
throne, sternly c alled for funds, and added, with reckless insolence,
“Take not this as threatening; I scorn to threaten any but my equals.”®®
Parliament pro - posed 350,000, but, before voting it, required the
King’s consent to a “Petition of Right” (May 28, 1628) which became a
historic landmark in the rise of Parliament to mastery:</p>

<p>tallage or aid shall be laid or levied by the King . . . without the
good will and assent of the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons,
knights,</p>
<p>burgesses, and other the freemen of the commonalty . . . your
sub-</p>
<p>jects have inherited this freedom, that they should not be compelled
to contribute to any tax, tallage, aid, or other like charge not set
by</p>
<p>common consent in Parliament.</p>
<p>The petition went on to protest against forced loans, and the King’s
viola - tion of the rights of habeas corpus and trial by jury as
embodied in the Magna Charta of 1215. “We shall know by this
〔petition〕 if Parliaments live or die,” said Coke. Charles gave it an
ambiguous consent; Parliament</p>
<p>Parliament, moving forward, requested the King to dismiss Bucking-
ham; Charles refused. Suddenly both sides were startled to find this
issue taken out of their hands. John Felton, a wounded ex-soldier
weighed down with debts, angry at the arrears of his pension, and
inflamed by pamphlets, bought a butcher’s knife, walked sixty miles from
London to Portsmouth, plunged the weapon into Buckingham’s breast, and
yielded himself to the authorities (Augu.st 23, 1628). Buckingham’s
wife, soon to give birth, col- lapsed at sight of the corpse. Felton,
overcome with remorse, sent her his apologies and begged her
forgiveness; she gave it. He was executed with- out torture.</p>
<p>The Parliament admonished the King that his continued collection of
tonnage and poundage dues violated the Petition of Right; Charles
replied that such dues had not been mentioned in the document;
Parliament en- couraged merchants to refuse to pay them.®* Reasserting
its right to legislate for religion despite the ecclesiastical supremacy
of the king, it proclaimed a strictly Calvinist, anti-Arminian
interpretation of the Thirty-nine Articles as the law of England; it
proposed, of its own authority, to enforce re- ligious conformity on
this basis, and to deal out penalties to Catholics and Arminians
alike.®® Charles ordered the Parliament to adjourn; the Speaker,
obeying, left the chair; but Parliament refused to adjourn, and members
compelled the Speaker to resume the chair. Sir John Eliot now (March
2,</p>
<ol start="1629" type="1">
<li>offered three resolutions which made it a capital crime to introduce
“Popery, or Arminianism, or other opinions disagreeing from the true and
orthodox Church,” to counsel, or take any share in, the collection of
ton - nage or poundage dues not sanctioned by Parliament, or to pay such
un- sanctioned dues. The Speaker refused to put the motions to a vote;

<p>member put them; the House acclaimed and passed them. Then, learning
that the King’s troops were about to enter and dismiss the Parliament,
it moved its own adjournment and dispersed.</p>
<p>On March 5 Charles ordered the imprisonment of Eliot, Selden, and</p>
<p>seven other members of Parliament on charges of sedition. Six of them
were soon released; three were condemned to heavy fines and long
imprison- ment; Eliot died in the Tower, aged thirty-eight (1632).</p>

<li>CHARLES absolute: 1629-4O</li>
</ol>
<p>Eleven years — the longest such interval in English history — ^were
to pass without the assembling of Parliament. Charles was now free to be
an absolute king. Theoretically he was claiming no more than James,
Eliza- beth, and Henry VIII; practically he was claiming more, for they
had</p>
<p>never stretched the royal prerogative so near the breaking point as
Charles was doing by levying unsanctioned taxes, forcing loans,
billeting soldiers on citizens, making arbitrary arrests, denying
prisoners the rights of habeas corpus and trial by jury, extending the
tyranny and severity of the Star Chamber in political, and of the Court
of High Commission in ecclesiastical, trials. But Charles’s basic
mistake was his failure to recognize that the</p>
<p>Amid this crisis, before it drew the nation’s blood, the economy pros
- pered, for Charles, like his father, was a man of peace and, through
most of his reign, kept England out of war, while Richelieu exhausted
France and Germany became a wilderness. The harassed King did what he
could to mitigate the natural concentration of wealth. He ordered a halt
to en- closures, annulled all those made in five Midland counties
between 1625 and 1630, and fined six hundred recalcitrant landlords.®^
He had the wages of textile workers raised in 1629, 1631, 1637; he bade
the justices of the peace exercise better ccmtrol over prices; he
appointed commissions to pro- tect the wage scale and supervise poor
relief; and Laud made new enemies by warning employers not to “grind the
faces of the poor.”** But at the same time the government granted, and
profited from, monopolies in soap, salt, starch, beer, wine, and hides;
it kept to itself a monopoly in coal, buy- ing it at eleven shillings a
caldron and selling it for seventeen in summer and nineteen in winter;®*
and these monopolies too ground the faces of the poor. During this
period over twenty thousand Puritans emigrated to New England.</p>
<p>Charles pleaded that he had to find some ways to pay the costs of

<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>

<p>eminent. In 1634 he tried, disastrously, a new tax. Precedents
existed for requiring coastal cities, in return for the protection
afforded them by the navy, to fit out vessels for it in time of war, or,
instead, to contribute “ship money” to the government for the
maintenance of the fleet. Charles now (1635), without precedent, exacted
this ship money from all England in time of peace, alleging the (quite
real) need to rebuild the dilapidated navy for emergency and to protect
British commerce from Channel piracy. Many resisted the new levy. To
test its legality John Hampden refused to pay it; he was indicted, but
was left free. He was a well-to-do Puritan of Buckinghamshire, no
firebrand, but a quiet man (said the Royalist Claren- don) of
“extraordinary sobriety and strictness,”®^ who hid firmness in courtesy
and leadership in modesty.</p>
<p>His trial was long delayed, but came to court at last in November
1637. The lawyers for the Crown cited precedents for the ship-money tax,
and held that the king, in time of peril, had the right to call for
financial aid without waiting to assemble Parliament. Hampden’s
attorneys replied that</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had extended his blunders to Scotland. He shocked the
Presbyterian Scots by marrying a Catholic and extending the authority of
the bishops over the presbyteries of the Kirk. He alarmed half the
nobility by an “Act of Revocation” (1625) revoking all grants of Church
or Crown lands made to Scottish families since the accession of Mary
Stuart. He named to the Privy Council of Scotland five bishops and an
archbishop, John Spottiswoode, and (1635) made this prelate Chancellor —
&gt; the first churchman to be appointed to that office since the
Reformation. When, after irritating delays, he came to Scotland to be
crowned (1633), he allowed the bishops to carry out the ritual with the
almost Catholic ceremonies of the Anglican Church — vestments, candles,
altar, and crucifix. Determined to enforce their authority over the
presbyteries, the Scottish bishops drew up a set of liturgical rules,
which, because emended and approved by the Archbishop of C anterbury,
came to be known as “Laud’s Canons.” These gave the king full
jurisdiction over all ecclesiastical mat - ters, forbade assemblies of
the clergy except at the king’s call, restricted the right of teaching
to persons licensed by a bishop, and limited ordina- tion to candidates
accepting these canons.®® Charles sanctioned the canons and ordered them
proclaimed in all Scottish churches. The Presbyterian</p>
<p>2o6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>ministers protested that half the Reformation was thereby annulled,
and they warned that Charles was preparing to submit Britain to Rome.
When an attempt was made, in St. Giles’s Church, Edinburgh, to conduct
a</p>
<p>service according to the new formulas, a riot broke out; sticlcs and
stones were hurled at the officiating dean; Jenny Geddes flung her stool
at his head, crying, “Thou foul thief, wilt thou say Mass at my lug
〔ear〕.^”*®</p>
<p>On February 28, 1638, representatives of the Scottish ministry and
laity signed at Edinburgh the National Covenant, reaffirming the
Presbyterian faith and ritual, rejecting the new canons, and pledging
themselves to de- fend the Crown and the “true religion.” Nearly all
Scotland, urged on by the ministers, subscribed to this covenant.
Spottiswoode and all but four of the bishops fled to England. The
General Assembly of the Kirk at</p>
<p>Glasgow repudiated all bishops, and declared the Kirk to be
independent of the state. Charles sent orders to the Assembly to
disperse or be charged with treason; it continued its sittings. The King
mustered an unenthusiastic army of 21,000 men and advanced toward
Scotland; the “Covenanters” raised 26,000 men aflame with patriotic and
religious fervor. When the two forces came face to face Charles agreed
to submit the issues to a free Scottish^Parliament and an unhindered
Assembly of the Kirk; a truce was signed at Berwick (June 18, 1639), and
the “First Bishops’ War” ended without shedding blood. But the new
Assembly, convened at Edinburgh (August 12, 1639), confirmed the
“treasonable” decisions of the Glasgow conference, and the Scottish
Parliament ratified the acts of the Assembly. Both sides prepared for
the “Second Bishops’ War.”</p>
<p>In this crisis Charles called to his aid a man as resolute and
thorough (this word was his motto) as the King was vacillating and
incompetent. Thomas Wentworth had reached Parliament at twenty-one
(1614), and had often voted against the King. Charles won him over by
making him presi- dent of the Council of the North, rewarded his
vigorous enforcement of the royal policies by appointing him to the
Privy Council, and sent him as Lord Deputy to Ireland (1632), where his
“Thorough” policy of merci - less efficiency stamped out rebellion and
created an angry peace. In 1639 he was made Earl of Strafford and chief
counselor to Charles. He advised the King to raise a large army,
suppress the Covenanters, and face a re- calcitrant Parliament with an
irresistible force. But a large army required large funds, which could
hardly be raised without Parliament. Reluctantly, Charles summoned his
fourth Parliament. When this “Short Parliament” met (April 13, 1640), he
displayed to it an intercepted letter in which Covenanters had solicited
the aid of Louis XIII;®^ against such treason.</p>

<p>argued the King, he had the right to organize an army, John Pym
secretly communicated with Covenanters, decided that their cause was
akin to Parliament’s case against the King, and persuaded the Parliament
to deny the King the subsidies and arrange an alliance with the Scots,
Charles dis- solved the Short Parliament as traitorous (May 5, 1640),
Riots broke out in London; a mob attacked the palace of Archbishop Laud;
not finding him, it killed a Catholic who refused to join in Protestant
worship,*®</p>
<p>Charles moved north with an improvised army. The Scots came down over
the border, defeated the English (August 20, 1640), and took pos-
session of northern England, The helpless monarch agreed to pay them
;^85 o a day until a satisfactory treaty could be concluded; he could
not pay, and the Scottish army remained around Newcastle as a decisive
ally of the English Parliament in its war with the King, Bewildered and
desper- ate, Charles called a council of peers to meet him at York, They
advised him that his authority was on the verge of collapse, and that he
must find some accommodation with his enemies. For the last time he
summoned a Parliament, the longest and most fateful in English
history.</p>
<p>VIII, THE LONG PARLIAMENT</p>
<p>It assembled at Westminster November 3, 1640. The House was com-
posed of some five hundred men, the “flower of the English gentry and
the educated laity , , , an aristocratic and not a popular house,”*®
repre - senting the wealth rather than the people of England, but
standing clearly for the future against the past. The majority of the
Short Parliament were returned, brooding revenge, Selden, Hampden, and
Pym were again on hand, and Oliver Cromwell, though not yet a leader,
was a man of mark. It is impossible, at this distance, to picture him
objectively, for since his rise and till today historians have described
him as an ambitious hypocrite’® or a statesman- saint.” A personality so
ambivalent probably encloses — sometimes he harmonizes — in his
character the opposite qualities that beget such contradictory
estimates. This may be the key to Cromwell,</p>
<p>He was one of those landowners without pedigree who stood outside the
glamour of government, but paid uncomfortably for its maintenance. And
yet he too had ancestors. His father, Robert Cromwell, had a modest
estate in Huntingdon, worth three hundred pounds a year; his great-
grandfather, Richard Williams, the nephew of Henry VIII’s minister</p>
<p>Thomas Cromwell, changed his name to Cromwell, and received, from
minister or King, manors and revenues confiscated from the Catholic
Church.’® Oliver was one of ten children and was the only one who sur -
vived infancy. His grammar-school instructor was a fervent preacher
who</p>
<p>2o8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, vin</p>
<p>wrote a treatise proving the pope to be Antichrist, and another
recording the divine punishment of notorious sinners. In 1616 Oliver
entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where the headmaster was
Samuel Ward, who died in prison (1643) for taking a strong Puritan stand
ag ainst Laud’s inno - vations and Charles’s “Declaration of Sports.”
Apparently Oliver left</p>
<p>Cambridge without graduating. Later (1638) he accused himself of some
youthful wickedness:</p>
<p>You know what my manner of life hath been. Oh, I have lived in</p>
<p>a loved darkness, and hated light; I was a chief, the chief, of
sinners.</p>
<p>This is true: I hated godliness; yet God had mercy on me. Oh, the</p>
<p>riches of His mercy! Praise Him for me — pray for me, that He who</p>
<p>hath begun a good work would perfect it in the day of Christ.’^®</p>
<p>He experienced all the ecstasies of repentance; he had hallucinations
of death and other mental terrors that left him permanently touched with
melancholy, and for the rest of his life he spoke in terms of Puritan
piety. He setded down, married, had nine children, and became so model a
citizen that in 1628, aged twenty-eight, he was chosen to represent
Huntingdon in Parliament. He sold his Huntingdon property for 1,800 in
1631 and</p>
<p>moved to St. Ives, later to Ely. When Cambridge returned him to
Parlia- ment in 1640 he was described by another member as “very
ordinarily appareled” in “a plain cloth suit . . . His linen not very
clean … a speck or two of blood upon his little 〔neck〕 band,” his face
“swollen and red - dish,” his voice “sharp and untunable,” his temper
“exceeding fiery,” but under firm control.’’^ He bided his time, talked
with God, and had the strength of ten. As yet, however, God chose other
instruments.</p>
<p>It was John Pym who revealed the angry mood of the Parliament by
denouncing Strafford as a secret papist plotting to bring in an army
from Ireland, to overthrow Parliament, and to “alter law and
religion.”’® On No - vember II, 1640, the House of Commons — ^which had
never forgiven his desertion to the King — impeached the Earl as a
traitor and had him sent to the Tower. On December 16, having declared
the new Anglican canons illegal, it impeached Archbishop Laud on grounds
of “popery” and treason, and had him too sent to the Tower. S elden
later confessed, “We charge the prelatical clergy with popery to make
them odious, though we know they are guilty of no such thing.”’® Charles
was so bewildered by these uncom - promising moves that he took no
action to protect his aides. The Queen justified the Parliament’s fears
by asking her confessor to solicit aid from the</p>
<p>Excitement and passion mounted on both sides. A “Root and Branch”
faction among the London radicals — which included Milton —
petitioned</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>Parliament to abolish episcopacy and restore the government of the
Church to the people; it branded as abominable the opinion of some
bishops “that the pope is not Antichrist . . . and that salvation is
attainable in that</p>
<ul>
<li>Catholic〕 religion.”‘^® The House rejected the petition, but voted
the de - barment of the clergy from all legislative and judicial
functions. The Lords agreed, with the proviso that bishops should retain
their seats in the upper house. This, however, was precisely what the
Commons wished to end, for it expected that the bishops in the Lords
would always vote for the King. Pamphlets defending or attacking
episcopacy made the issue boil. Bishop Joseph Hall claimed divine right
for it on the ground that it had been established by the Apostles or
Christ; five Presbyterian publicists replied in a famous pamphlet under
the pseudonym “Smectymnuus,” com - posed of their initials; five later
blasts were contributed by Milton. On May 27, 1641, Cromwell again
proposed the total abolition of the episco- pacy; the bill was passed by
the House, rejected by the Lords. On Sep- tember I the Commons resolved
that “scandalous pictures” of the Trinity, all images of the Virgin
Maiy, all crosses and “superstitious figures” should be removed from
English churches, and that all “dancing and other sports” were to be
avoided on the Lord’s Day. Another wave of iconoclasm swept over
England; altar rails and screens were taken down, stained-glass win-
dows were smashed, statues were demolished, pictures were cut to
shreds.^® The House again passed a bishops’ exclusion bill on October
23. The Kling appealed to the Lords, declaring that he was resolved to
die in the main- tenance of the existing doctrine and discipline of the
Anglican Church; he did. His intervention secured the defeat of the
bill, but hostile crowds prevented the bishops from attending
Parliament. Twelve of them signed a protest, declaring that any
legislation passed in their absence would be mill and void. Parliament
impeached and imprisoned them. Finally the Lords ratified the exclusion
bill (February 5, 1642), and bishops no longer sat in Parliament.</li>
</ul>
<p>The victorious Commons proceeded to consolidate its power. It bor-
rowed money from the city of London to finance its maintenance. It
passed bills requiring triennial Parliaments and forbidding the
dissolution of any Parliament within fifty days of its convening, or of
the present Parliament without its consent. It reformed taxation and the
judiciary. It abolished the Star Chamber and the Court of High
Commission. It ended monopolies and the levy of ship money, and
rescinded the verdict against Hampden. It granted the King the right to
collect tonnage and poundage dues, but only for periods specified by
Parliament. Charles agreed to these measures, and the Parliament passed
from reform to revolution.</p>
<p>In March 1641 it brought Strafford to trial; in April it pronounced
him guilty of treason and sent the bill of attainder to the King for
signature.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>Against Laud’s advice, Charles appeared in the Lords and declared
that though he was ready, to disqualify Strafford from office he would
never consent to condemn him for treason. The Commons pronounced this
royal appearance a violation of parliamentary privilege and freedom. On
the next day “great multitudes” gathered about the House of Lords and
the palace of the King, crying “Justice! justice!” and demanding
Strafford’s death. The frightened Privy Council begged Charles to yield;
he refused. The Archbishop of York added his plea for signature; nobles
warned the King that his own life and the lives of tlie Queen and his
children were in</p>
<p>danger; he still refused. Finally the condemned man himself sent him
a message advising him to sign, as the only alternative to mob
violence.*® Charles signed and never forgave himself. On May 12, 1641,
Strafford was led out to execution. Laud stretched out his hands through
the bars of his cell window to bless him as he passed. “Thorough” died
without</p>
<p>whimpering, before a hostile crowd.</p>
<p>His execution sharpened the division of the House into what later
came to be the rival parties of Whigs and Tories — those who favored and
those who opposed the further transference of power from king to
Parliament. Men like Lucius Cary (Viscount Falkland) and Edward Hyde
(future Earl of Clarendon), both of whom had supported Parliament,
wondered now whether the King, having been so severely chastened, might
not be a de- sirable bulwark against mob rule in London, Puritan rule in
religion, and a runaway Parliament that would disestablish the Church,
threaten private property, and imperil the whole class structure of
British life. Pym, Hamp- den, and Cromwell might have admitted these
dangers, but there was an- other that touched them more closely: they
had gone so far that they feared for their lives if Charles should
recover power. At any moment the King might bring over a half-Catholic
army from Ireland as Strafford had proposed to do. For its own safety
Parliament decided to maintain the friendly army of Scots in the north
of England. It sent the Scots an initial gift of £ 300,000 and pledged a
monthly subsidy of £ 23 , 000 .^^</p>
<p>The fears of the Parliament were sharpened by the sudden outbreak of
a wild revolt in Ireland (October 1641). Phelim O’Neill, Rory O’More
III, and other leaders called for a war of liberation — of Ulster from
its English colonists, of Catholics from oppression, of Ireland from
England. Inflamed by the memory of merciless persecutions and brutal
evictions, the rebels fought with a fury that made them barbarous; the
English in Ireland, de- fending what now seemed to them their legitimate
property as well as their lives, returned barbarity with ferocity, and
every victory became a massacre. The English Parliament wrongly
suspected the King of having fomented the revolt to restore Catholicism
in Ireland and later in England; it refused his request for funds to
raise an army to rescue the English in</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>2II</p>
<p>the Pale; such an army might be turned against Parliament itself. The
Irish revolt continued throughout the English revolution.</p>
<p>The revolution took a further step when Charles advanced two of the
excluded and impeached bishops to higher place. Indignant Commoners
proposed a “Grand Remonstrance” which would summarize and publicize the
case of Parliament against the King, and would compel him to give
Parliament the right to veto his appointments to important posts. Many
conservatives felt that the measure would transfer executive power to
the Parliament and reduce the King to impotence. The division of parties
be- came acute, the debate more violent; members clutched their swords
to emphasize their words; Cromwell later declared that if the bill had
lost he would have taken ship to America.®* It passed by eleven votes,
and on De- cember I, 1641, it was presented to the King. It began by
affirming its loyalty to the Crown. It proceeded to list in detail the
offenses which the King had given Parliament and the injuries he had
inflicted upon the country. It reviewed the abuses which parliamentary
reforms had cor- rected; it charged “papists . . . bishops, and the
corrupt part of the clergy,” and self-seeking councilors and courtiers,
with plotting to make England Catholic. It pointed to repeated
violations of the Petition of Right and to highhanded dissolutions of
elected Parliaments. It asked the King to call an assembly of divines to
restore the Anglican worship to its pre-Laudian form. It proposed that
he remove from his Council all opponents of the Parliament’s policies,
and employ hereafter only “such counselors, ambas - sadors, and other
ministers … as the Parliament have cause to confide in; without which
they could not give his Majesty such supplies for his own support, or
such assistance for the Protestant party beyond the seas, as was
desired.”®*</p>
<p>Charles took his time answering this ultimatum. On December 1 5
Parlia- ment went over his head to the people by ordering publication of
the Grand Remonstrance. Charles then replied. He agreed to call a synod
to repress all invasions of “popery”; he refused to deprive the bishops
of their votes in Parliament; he insisted on his right to call to his
Council, and to public employment, such men as he thought fit; and he
again asked for funds. Instead, the Commons proposed a “Militia Bill”
which would give it control of the army.</p>
<p>Charles, so regularly irresolute, now rushed into a bold stroke
that</p>
<p>Parliament denounced as an act of war. On January 3, 1642, his
attorney general, before the Lords, indicted, in the King’s name, five
members of the lower house — Pym, Hampden, Holies, Heselrige, Strode —
on a charge of treason for seeking to turn the army from obedience to
the King and for encouraging a “foreign power” (Scotland) to invade
England and make war upon the King. On the next day Charles, supported
by</p>
<p>2t2 THE Age of reason begins (chap, vni</p>
<p>three hundred soldiers whom he left at the door, entered the House of
Commons to arrest the five men; they were not there, having taken refuge
in friendly homes; “I see,” said the baffled King, “all the birds are
flown.” As he walked out he was rebuked with cries of “Privilege!”; for
such royal and armed invasion of Parliament was manifestly illegal. In
fear of whole- sale arrest, the Commons moved to the Guildhall, under
protection of the citizens. When Charles left London for Hampton Court,
the Commons, including the five indicted men, returned to Westminster.
Queen Henri- etta fled secretly to France with the Crown jewels to buy
aid for the King. Charles left for the north with the Great Seal. He
tried to enter Hull and secure the military supplies there; the town
refused to admit him; he moved on to York. Parliament ordered all armed
forces to obey only Parliament (March 5, 1642). Thirty-five peers and
sixty-five Commoners seceded from Parliament and joined Charles at York.
Edward Hyde now became chief adviser to the King.</p>
<p>On June 2 Parliament transmitted to Charles nineteen propositions</p>
<p>whose acceptance it held to be essential to peace. He was to turn
over to Parliament control of the army and all fortified places.
Parliament was to revise the liturgy and the government of the Church.
It was to appoint and dismiss all ministers of the Crown and the
guardians of the King’s children, and was to have authority to exclude
from the upper house all peers hereafter created. Charles rejected the
proposals as in effect a destruc- tion of the monarchy. As if rehearsing
the French Revolution, Parliament appointed a Committee of Public
Safety, and ordered that “an army shall be forthwith raised” (July 12).
Cromwell and others left for their home boroughs to organize volunteers.
In an appeal to the nation (August 2), Parliament based its revolt not
on the desirability of parliamentary sover- eignty, but on the imminence
of a Catholic uprising in England; and it warned the country that
victory for the King would be followed by a general massacre of
Protestants.®^ On August 17 its agents seized the military stores at
Hull. On August 27, 1642, Charles unfurled his standard at Nottingham
and began the Civil War.</p>

<p>England was now divided as seldom in known history before. London,
the ports, the manufacturing towns, in general the south and the east,
most of the middle class, part of the gentry, and practically all
Puritans were for Parliament. Oxford and Cambridge, the west and the
north, most of the aristocracy and the peasantry, and nearly all
Catholics and episcopalian Anglicans stood with the King. The House of
Commons was itself divided:</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>some 300 members were on the rebel side, some 175 were Royalists. In
the Lords 30 of the 1 10 peers sided at first with Parliament. The
balance of wealth fell against the King; London had half the money of
the nation and lent heavily to the revolution; Charles could not borrow
anywhere; the navy was against him, and it blocked foreign aid; he had
to rely upon gifts and men from the great estates, whose owners felt
that their landed interest depended on his victory. Some chivalric
virtues and sentiment sur- vived in the old families; they gave their
loyalty to the King without stint; they fought and died like gentlemen.
The colorful Cavaliers, their hair in ringlets, their horses in gay
accouterment, had all the romance of the war on their side, and all the
poets but Milton. The money was with Parliament. The gauge of blood
began at Edgehill (October 23, 1642). Each army had some 14,000 men. The
Royalists were led by Prince Rupert, the twenty-two-year- old son of
Charles’s sister, Elizabeth of Bohemia; the “Roundheads,” by Robert
Devereux, third Earl of E ssex. The result was indecisive, but Essex
withdrew his forces, and the King marched on to make Oxford his
headquarters. Nehemiah Wallington, a fervent or politic Puritan, called
it a great victory for Parliament and God:</p>
<p>Herein we see God’s great mer cy . . . for, as I hear, the
slaughter</p>
<p>was in all 5,517; but ten of the enemy’s side were slain to one of
ours.</p>
<p>And observe God’s wonderful works, for those that were slain of our
side were mostly of them that ran away; but those that stood most</p>
<p>valiantly to it, they were most preserved. . . .</p>
<p>If I could relate how admirably the hand of Providence ordered</p>
<p>our artillery and bullets for the destruction of the enemy! . . . Oh,
how God did guide their bullets . . . that some fell down before them
〔of</p>
<p>our side〕, some grazed along, some bullets went over their heads,
and some one side of them! Oh, how seldom or never were they hurt, that
stood valiant to it, by their bullets! . . . This is the Lord’s doing,
and</p>
<p>it is marvelous in my eyes.*®</p>
<p>However, matters went poorly for Parliament in the ensuing spring.
Queen Henrietta stole back to England with arms and ammunition and
joined Charles at Oxford. Essex dallied while his army was eroded by
desertion and disease. Hampden was mortally wounded in a skirmish at
Chalgrove Field. A Parliamentary force was defeated at Adwalton Moor
(June 30, 1643), another was destroyed at Roundway Down (July 13);
Bristol fell to the King. In this nadir of its fortunes. Parliament
turned to Scotland for help. On September 2 2 it signed with Scottish
commissioners a “Solemn League and Covenant” which pledged the Scots to
send an army to Parliament’s aid in return for 30,000 a month, on
condition that</p>
<p>Parliament establish in England and Ireland the Presbyterian form
of</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VlII</p>
<p>Protestantism — church government by presbyteries free from episcopal
control. In the same month Charles made peace with the Irish insurgents,
and imported some of them to fight for him in England. English Catholics
rejoiced, Protestants turned increasingly against the King. In January
1644 the Irish invaders were defeated at Nantwich, and the Scottish
invaders advanced into England. The Civil War now involved three nations
and four faiths.</p>
<p>On July I, 1643, the Westminster Assembly — 12 1 English divines,
thirty English laymen, and (later) eight Scottish delegates — ^met to
define the new Presbyterian Protestantism of England. Hampered by
Parliamentary domination, it dragged out its conferences through six
years. A few mem- bers, favoring episcopacy, withdrew; a small group of
Puritan Independents demanded that each congregation should be free from
presbyteries as well as from bishops; the majority, following the pledge
and the will of Parlia- ment, favored the rule of religion in England
and Ireland, as in Scotland, by presbyters, presbyteries, provincial
synods, and general assemblies. Parliament abolished the Anglican
episcopacy (1643), adopted and legis- lated the Presbyterian
organization and creed (1646), but gave itself a veto power over all
ecclesiastical decisions. In 1647 the Assembly issued the Westminster
Confession of Faith, Larger Catechism, and Smaller Cate- chism,
reaffirming the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination, election, and
reprobation.* The decisions of the Westminster Assembly were set aside
by the restoration of the Stuart dynasty and the Anglican Church, but
the confession and the catechisms have remained in theoretical force in
the Presbyterian churches of the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>The Assembly and the Parliament agreed in rejecting the plea of the
minor sects for religious toleration. The incorporated city of London
petitioned Parliament to suppress all heresies. In 1648 the Commons
passed bills punishing with life imprisonment the opponents of infant
baptism, and with death those who denied the Trinity, or the
Incarnation, or the divine inspiration of the Bible, or the immortality
of the soul.®^ Several Jesuits were executed between 1642 and 1650; and
on January 10, 1645, Archbishop Laud, aged seventy-two, was led from the
Tower to the block. Parliament felt that it was engaged in a war to the
death and that it was no time for amenities. Cromwell, however, stood
out for some measure of</p>

<p>toleration. In 1643 he organized at Cambridge a regiment which came
to be called the Ironsides — a name originally given by Prince Rupert to
Crom- well himself. Into this company he welcomed men of any faith —
except Catholics and Episcopalians — “who had the fear of God before
them and made some conscience of what they did.”®* When a Presbyterian
officer wished to cashier a lieutenant colonel as an Anabaptist,
Cromwell protested, “Sir, the state, in choosing men to serve it, takes
no notice of their opinions; if they be willing to serve it faithfully,
that suffices.”*® He asked Parliament (1644) to “endeavour the finding
out some way how far tender consciences, who cannot in all things submit
to the common 〔ecclesiastical〕 rule . . . may be borne with according
to the Word.”®® Parliament ignored the request, but he continued to
practice a compara- tive toleration in his regiments, and during his
ascendancy in England.</p>
<p>Cromwell’s development as a general was one of the surprises of the
war. He shared with Lord Ferdinando Fairfax the honors of a victory
at</p>
<p>Winceby (October ii, 1643). At Marston Moor (July 2, 1644)
Fairfax</p>
<p>was routed, but Cromwell’s Ironsides saved the day. Other
Parliamentary leaders, the earls of Essex and Manchester, suffered
reverses or failed to follow up their successes; Manchester frankly
admitted his unwilling- ness to overthrow the King. To get rid of these
titled generals, Cromwell pro posed a “Self - denying Ordinance”
(December 9, 1644) by which all members of Parliament were to resign
their commands. The proposal was defeated; it was revived and passed
(April 3, 1645); Essex and Manchester retired; Sir Thomas Fairfax, son
of Ferdinando, was made commander in chief, and he soon appointed
Cromwell lieutenant general in charge of the cavalry. Parliament ordered
the formation of a “New Model” army of 22,000 men. Cromwell undertook to
train it.</p>
<p>He had had no military experience before the war, but his force
of</p>
<p>character, his steadiness of purpose and will, his skill in playing
upon the religious and political feelings of men, enabled him to mold
his regi- ments into a unique discipline and loyalty. The Puritan faith
equaled the Spartan ethic in making invincible soldiers. These men did
not “swear like a trooper”; on the contrary, no oaths were heard in
their camp, but many sermons and prayers. They stole not, nor raped, but
they invaded churches to rid them of religious images and “prelatical”
or “papistical” clergymen.®^ They shouted with joy or fury when they
encountered the enemy. And they were never beaten. At Naseby (June 14,
1645), when the Royalists were routing Sir Thomas Fairfax’s infantry,
Cromwell with his new cavalry turned the defeat into so thorough a
victory that the King lost all his infantry, all his artillery, half his
cavalry, and copies of his cor- respondence, which were published to
show that he planned to bring more Irish troops into England and to
repeal the laws against Catholics.</p>
<p>From that time Charles’s affairs rapidly worsened. The Marquis of
Mont -</p>

<p>rose, his heroic general in Scotland, after many victories, was
routed at Philiphaugh and fled to the Continent. On July 30, 1645, the
Parliamentary army took Bath; on August 23 Rupert surrendered Bristol to
Fairfax. The King turned in all directions for help, in vain. On every
side and pretext his troops, feeling their cause hopeless, went over to
the enemy. By sepa- rate and devious negotiations he tried to divide his
foes — ^the Independents from the Parliament, Parliament from the Scots
— and failed. He had al- ready sent his pregnant wife across hostile
country to find ship for France; now he bade Prince Charles escape from
England by whatever possible means. He himself, disguised and with but
two attendants, made his way to the north and surrendered to the Scots
(May 5, 1646). The First Civil War was in effect at an end.</p>
<p>X. THE radicals: 1646-48</p>
<p>Charles had been led to hope that the Scots would treat him as still
their King; they preferred to consider him their prisoner. They offered
to help him regain his throne if he would sign the Solemn League and
Covenant making the Presbyterian form of Christianity compulsory
throughout the British Isles; he refused. The English Parliament sent
commissioners to the Scots at Newcastle, proposing to accept Charles as
King on condition that he accept the Covenant, consent to the
proscription of leading Royalists, and allow Parliament to control all
armed forces and name all high officials of the state; he refused.
Parliament offered the Scots 400,000 to pay their arrears and expenses
if they would return to Scotland and surrender the King to English
commissioners. The Scottish Parliament agreed. It ac- cepted the money
not as a price for the King, but as just reimbursement for its outlay in
the war; Charles, however, felt that he had been bartered for gold. He
was removed to Holmby House in Northamptonshire (Jan- uary 1647) as
prisoner of the English Parliament.</p>
<p>The English army, now encamped at Saffron Walden, forty miles from
London, reviewed its victories and called for commensurate rewards. The
cost of maintaining these thirty thousand men had compelled Parliament
to raise taxes to twice their maximum under Charles; even so it owed the
soldiers from four to ten months of back pay. Moreover, the Puritan In-
dependents, defeated in Parliament, were gaining the upper hand in the
army, and Cromwell, their leader, was suspected of ambitions
inconsistent with the sovereignty of Parliament. Worse yet, there were
in his regiment “Levelers” who rejected all distinctions of rank in
Church and state, and who called for manhood suffrage and religious
liberty. A few of them were anarchist communists; William Walwyn
declared that all things</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>should be in common; then “there would be no need for government, for
there would be no thieves or criminals.”®^ John Lilburne, the most un -
discourageable of the Levelers after every arrest and punishment, was
“the most popular man in England” ( 1646).®® Cromwell was attacked as a
Leveler, but, though sympathetic with them, he was hostile to their
ideas, feeling that in the England of that day democracy would lead to
chaos.</p>
<p>Parliament, now Presbyterian, resented the threat implied in the
nearness of so large and troublesome an army so potently Independent. It
passed a bill to disband half of it and to enroll the rest as volunteers
for service in Ireland. The soldiers demanded their arrears; Parliament
voted them a part in cash, the remainder in promises. The army refused
to disband until fully paid. Parliament reopened negotiations with the
King, and nearly reached an agreement with him to restore him on his
consenting to accept the Covenant for three years. Warned of this, a
squad of cavalry raided Holmby House, captured the King, and took him to
Newmarket (June 3-5, 1647). Cromwell hurried to Newmarket and made
himself head of a Council of the Army. On January 10 the army began a
leisurely march upon London. En route it sent to Parliament a
declaration formulated chiefly by Cromwell’s able son -in-law Henry
Ireton, which condemned the absolutism of Parliament as no better than
the King’s, and demanded the election of a new Parliament by a wider
suffrage. Parliament was between two fires, for the merchants, the
manufacturers, and the populace of Lon- don, fearing occupation by the
army, clamored for the restoration of the King on almost any terms. A
city crowd invaded Parliament (July 26), and compelled it to invite the
King to London and to put the militia under Presbyterian command.
Sixty-seven Independents left Parliament for the army.</p>
<p>On August 6 the troops entered London, bringing the King with them.
The sixty-seven Independents were escorted back to their places in
Parlia- ment. From that time until Cromwell took supreme authority, the
army dominated Parliament. It was not chaotic or unprincipled; it
maintained order in the city and within its own ranks; and its demands,
though prob- ably impracticable at the time, were sanctioned by
posterity. In the</p>
<p>pamphlet The Case of the Army Truly Stated (October 9, 1647) it
called for freedom of trade, abolition of monopolies, and restoration of
common lands to the poor, and urged that no man be forced to testify
against him- self in court.®^ In An Agreement of the People (October 30)
it proclaimed that “all power is originally and essentially in the whole
body of the</p>
<p>people”; that the only just government is through representatives
freely chosen by manhood suffrage; that therefore kings and lords, if
allowed to exist, should be subordinate to the House of Commons; that no
man should be exempt from the laws; and that all should enjoy fuU
religious liberty.®®</p>
<p>2i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>“Every man born in England, the poor man, the meanest man in the king
- dom,” said Colonel Rainsborough, ought to have a voice in choosing
those who made the laws of the land by which he was to live and
die.®®</p>
<p>Cromwell quieted the debate by summoning its leaders to prayer. The
Levelers charged him with hypocrisy and with secret negotiations for
restoring the King, and he confessed that he still believed in monarchy.
He explained to the democrats that the resistance to their proposals
would be too formidable to be overcome by mere “fleshly strength,” and
after long argument he persuaded the leaders to reduce their demand for
uni- versal suffrage to a request for an extension of the franchise.
Some soldiers refused to compromise; they wore the Agreement in their
hats, and ignored Cromwell’s command to remove it. He had three
ringleaders ar - rested; they were tried by court-martial and condemned
to death; he ordered them to throw dice for their lives; the one who
lost was shot. Discipline revived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the King escaped from his army captors, made his way to the
coast and the Isle of Wight, and found friendly lodging in Carisbrooke
Castle (November 14, 1647). He was heartened by news of Royalist re-
bellions against Parliament in the countryside and in the fleet.
Scottish com- missioners in London secredy offered a Scottish army to
re-enthrone him if he would adopt Presbyterian Christianity and suppress
other forms of religion. He accepted this “engagement,” but limited it
to three years. The commissioners left London to raise an army. The
Scottish Parliament ratified their plan for an invasion of England, and
issued a manifesto (May 3, 1648) requiring all Englishmen to take the
Covenant, to suppress all forms of religion except the Presbyterian, and
to disband the Independent army. The English Parliament saw itself
superseded and England subordi- nated to Scotland if these proposals
came into force. It hurriedly made its peace with Cromwell and persuaded
him to lead his troops against the Scots; doubtless it was glad to put
him at a distance and in peril. After three days of pleading he
prevailed upon the army to follow him back to battle. It went
reluctantly, and some leaders vowed that if they again saved Eng- land,
it would be their “duty … to call Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to
account for the blood he had shed.”®^</p>

<p>Cromwell’s energy made short work of the Second Civil War. While</p>
<p>Fairfax put down Royalist revolts in Kent, Oliver turned west and
cap- tured a Royalist stronghold in Wales. The Scots crossed the Tweed
on July 8 and moved with alarming speed to within forty miles of
Liverpool.</p>
<p>CHAP, vni)</p>
<p>THE GREAT REBELLION</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>At Preston, in Lancashire, Cromwell’s nine thousand men met twice
that</p>
<p>While Cromwell and his army were saving Parliament, it plotted to
pro- tect itself from them by reopening negotiations for the restoration
of the King. But it insisted that he should sign and enforce the
Covenant; he would not. The returning army offered to support his
restoration with severe limitations on the royal prerogative; he refused
(November 17). To prevent his being restored by Parliament, the army
captured him again and lodged him in Hurst Castle, opposite the Isle of
Wight. Parliament con- demned the action and voted to accept the King’s
latest terms as a basis for settlement. The army leaders, anticipating
death if Charles were restored, declared that none might be permitted to
pass into the House but such as had continued “faithful to the public
interest.” Early on December 6 Colonel Thomas Pride and a troop of
soldiers surrounded and invaded the House of Commons and barred or
expelled 140 Royalist and Presbyterian members; forty who resisted were
jailed.*® Cromwell approved the action, and joined in voting for the
speedy trial and execution of the King.</p>
<p>Of the five hundred members who in 1640 had composed the House of
Commons only fifty- six now remained. This “Rump Parliament,” by a
majority of six, passed an ordinance declaring it treason for a king to
make war upon Parliament. The Lords rejected the ordinance as beyond the
authority of the Commons; the Commons thereupon (January 4, 1649) re-
solved that the people were, “under God, the original of all just
power”; that the Commons, as representing the people, had “the supreme
power in this nation”; and that therefore its enactments, without the
consent of the Lords or the king, had the force of law. On January 6
they named 135 commissioners to try the King. One commissioner, Algernon
Sidney, told Cromwell they had no legal authority to try a king.
Cromwell lost his temper. “I tell you,” he cried, “we will cut off his
head with the crown upon it.”*® The army leaders made a last attemp t to
avoid regicide; they offered to acquit Charles if he would agree to the
sale of the bishops’ lands and resign the power to veto the ordinances
of Parliament. He said he could not, for he had sworn to be faithful to
the Church of England. There was no question of his courage.</p>
<p>The trial began on January 19, 1649. The sixty or seventy impromptu
judges who consented to act sat on a raised dais at one end of
Westminster Hall, soldiers stood at the other, spectators thronged the
galleries; Charles was seated in the center, alone. The presiding
officer, John Bradshaw, stated the charge and asked the King to answer.
Charles denied the authority of the court to try him, or that it
represented the people of England, and claimed that government by a Rump
Parliament dominated by the army was a worse tyranny than any he had
ever shown. The galleries cried,</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VIU</p>
<p>“God save the King!” The pulpits condemned the trial; Bradshaw feared
for his life in the streets. Prince Charles dispatched from Holland a
sheet bearing only his signature, and promised the judges to abide by
any terms they would write over his name if they would spare his
father’s life.^®® Four nobles offered to die in Charles’s stead; they w
ere refused.<sup>®</sup> Fifty- nine judges, including Cromwell, signed
the death sentence. On January 30, before a vast and horror-stricken
crowd, the King went quietly to his death. His head was severed with one
blow of the executioner’s ax. “There was such a groan by the thousands
then present,” wrote an eyewitness, “as I never heard before and desire
I may never hear again.”<sup>®</sup></p>
<p>Was the execution legal? Of course not. On the basis of existing law,
the Parliament progressively and rudely appropriated royal rights
sanctioned by the precedents of a hundred years. By definition a
revolution is il- legal; it can advance to the new only by violating the
old. Charles was sincere in defending the powers he had inherited from
Elizabeth and James; he was sinned against as well as sinning; his fatal
error lay in not recognizing that the new distribution of wealth
required, for social stabil- ity, a new distribution of political
power.</p>
<p>Was the execution just? Yes, so far as war is just. Once law is set
aside by trial at arms, the defeated may ask for mercy, but the victor
may exact the ultimate penalty if he judges it necessary as a preventive
of renewed resistance, or as a deterrent to others, or as protection for
the lives of himself and his followers. Presumably a triumphant King
would have hanged Cromwell, Ireton, Fairfax, and many more, perhaps with
the tortures regularly allotted to persons convicted of treason.</p>
<p>Was the execution wise? Probably not. Cromwell apparently believed
that a live king, no matter how securely imprisoned, would be a stimulus
to repeated Royalist revolts. But so would the King’s son, unreachable
in France or Holland, as yet unblemished with his father’s faults, and
soon to be glorified with romance. The execution of Charles I led to a
foreseeable revulsion of national feeling, which in eleven years
restored his line. Sub- sequent history suggests that mercy would have
been wisdom. When Charles’s son James II gave equally great offense, the
Glorious Revolution of 1688, managed with aristocratic finesse,
deliberately allowed him to escape to France; and the results of that
deposition were permanent. How- ever, it was the earlier Rebellion that
made the later Revolution possible in all its swift effectiveness.</p>
<p>The Great Rebellion corresponded both to the Huguenot uprisings in
sixteenth-century France and, despite many differences, to the French
Revolution of 1789 — ^in the first case the insurrection of a stem and
simple Calvinism, sinewed by mercantile wealth, against a ritualistic
Church and</p>

<p>221</p>
<p>an absolutist government; in the second case the revolt of a national
as- sembly, expressing the power of the purse and the middle class,
against a landed aristocracy led by a well-meaning but blundering ruler.
By 1789 the English had digested their two rebellions, and could look
with horror and eloquence upon a revolution that, like its own,
incarnadined a country and killed a king because the past had tried to
stan^ still.</p>
