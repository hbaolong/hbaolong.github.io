<p>Athens</p>
<p>I. Hesiod’s boeoha</p>
<p>E ast of Megara the road divides — south to Athens, north to
Thebes.</p>
<p>Northward the route is mountainous, and draws the traveler up to</p>
<p>the heights of Mt. Cithaeron. Far to the west Parnassus is visible.
Ahead, across lesser heights and far below, is the fertile Boeotian
plain. At the foot of the hill lies Plataea, where 100,000 Greeks
annihilated 300,000 Persians. A little to the west is Leuctra, where
Epaminondas won his first great vic- tory over the Spartans. Again a
little west rises Mt. Helicon, home of the Mus es and Keats’s “blushful
Hippocrene”— that famous fountain, the Horse’s Spring, which, we are
assured, gushed forth when the hoof of the winged steed Pegasus struck
the earth as he leaped toward heaven.’ Directly north is Thespiae,
always at odds with Thebes; and close by is the fountain in whose waters
Narcissus contemplated his shadow — or, another story said, that of the
dead sister whom he loved.*</p>
<p>In the little town of Ascra, near Thespiae, lived and toiled the
poet</p>
<p>Hesiod, second only to Homer in the affection of the classic Greeks.
Tra- dition gave 846 and 777 as the dates of his birth and death; some
modem scholars bring him down to 650;* probably he lived a century
earlier than that.* He was bom at Aeolian Cyme in Asia Minor; but his
father, tired of poverty there, migrated to Ascra, which Hesiod
describes as “miserable in winter, insufferable in summer, and never
good”<em>— like most of the places in which men live. As Hesiod, farm
hand and shepherd boy, followed his flocks up and down the slopes of
Helicon he dreamed that the Muses breathed into his body the soul of
poetry. So he wrote and sang, and won prizes in musical contests,</em>
even, some said, from Homer himself.’</p>
<p>Loving like any young Greek the marvels of mythology, he composed* a
Theogony, or Genealogy of the Gods, of which we have a thousand halt-
ing lines, giving those dynasties and families of deities which are as
vital to religion as the pedigrees of kings are to history. First he
sang of the</p>

<p>99</p>
<p>Muses themselves, because they were, so to speak, his neighbors on
Heli- con, and in his youthful imagination he c ould almost see them
“dancing with delicate feet” on the mountainside, and “bathing their
soft skins” in the Hippocrene/ Then he described not so much the
creation as the pro- creation of the world — how god begot god until
Olympus overflowed. In the be ginning was Chaos; “and next broad
-bosomed Earth, ever secure seat of all the immortals”; in Greek
religion the gods live on the earth or within it, and are always close
to men. Next came Tartarus, god of the nether world; and after him Eros,
or Love, “fairest of the gods.”“ Chaos begot Darkness and Night, which
begot Ether and Day; Earth begot Mountains and Heaven, and Heaven and
Earth, mating, begot Oceanus, the Sea. We capitalize these names, but in
Hesiod’s Greek there were no capitals, and for all we know he meant
merely that in the beginning was chaos, and then the earth, and the
inners of the earth, and night and day and the sea, and desire begetting
all things; perhaps Hesiod was a philosopher touched by the Muses and
personifying abstractions into poetry; Empedocles would use the same
tricks a century or two later in Sicily From such a theology it would be
but a step to the natural philosophy of the lonians.</p>
<p>Hesiod’s mythology revels in monsters and blood, and is not averse to
theological pornography. Out of the mating of Heaven (Uranus) and Earth
(Ge or Gaea) came a race of Titans, some with fifty heads and a hundred
hands. Uranus liked them not, and condemned them to gloomy Tartarus. But
Earth resenting this, proposed to them that they should kill their
father. One of the Titans, Cronus, undertook the task. Then “huge Ge
rejoiced, and hid him in ambush; in his hand she placed a sickle with
jagged teeth, and suggested to him all the stratagem. Then came vast
Heaven, bringing Night 〔Erebus〕 with him, and, eager for love, brooded
around Earth, and lay stretched on all sides.” Thereupon Cronus
mutilated his father, and threw the flesh into the sea. From the drops
of blood that fell upon the earth came the Furies; from the foam that
formed around the flesh as it floated on the waters rose Aphrodite.*“
The Titans captured</p>
<p>Such, according to Hesiod, were the births and ways of the gods.

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>too, is the tale of Prometheus, Far-Seer and Fire-Bringer; here, in
tedious abundance, are some of the divine adulteries that enabled so
many Greeks, like Mayflower Americans, to trace their pedigrees to the
gods — one would never have guessed that adultery could be so dull. We
do not know how far these myths were the popular outgrowth of a
primitive and almost sav- age culture, and how far they are due to
Hesiod; few of them are men- tioned in the healthy pages of Homer. It is
possible that some measure of the disrepute into which these tales
brought the Olympians in days of philosopHcal criticism and moral
development is to be ascribed to the gloomy fancy of Ascra’s bard.</p>
<p>In the only poem universally conceded to Hesiod he descends from</p>
<p>Olympus to the plains, and writes a vigorous georgic of the farmer’s
life. The Works and Days takes the form of a long reproof and counsel to
the poet’s brother Perseus, who is so strangely pictured that he may be
only a literary device. “Now will I speak to thee with good intent, thou
exceed - ing foolish Perseus.”” This Perseus, we are told, has cheated
Hesiod of Hesiod’s inheritance; and now the poet, in the first of known
sermons on - ern wind, the moaning forests and crashing pines, the
beasts “shunning the white sn ow” and huddling fearfully in their folds
and stalls.* How cozy then is a well-built cottage, the lasting reward
of courageous and prudent toil! There the domestic tasks go on despite
the storm; then a wife is a helpmate indeed, and repays a man for the
many tribulations she has caused him.</p>
<p>Hesiod cannot quite make up his mind about helpmates. He must have
been a bachelor or a widower, for no man with a living wife would have
spoken so acridly of woman. It is true that at the end of our fragment
of the Theogony the poet begins a chivalrous Catalogue of Women,
recount- ing the legend of those days when heroines were as numerous as
men, and</p>
<p>ATHENS</p>
<p>IO&gt;</p>
<p>CHAP.V)</p>
<p>most of the gods were goddesses. But in both of his major works he
tells with bitter relish how all human ills were brought to man by the
beautiful Pandora. Angered by Prometheus’ theft of fire from Heaven,
Zeus bids the gods mold woman as a Greek gift for man. He</p>
<p>bade Hephaestus with all speed mix earth with water, and endue it</p>
<p>with man’s voice and strength, and to liken in countenance to im
-</p>
<p>mortal goddesses the fair, lovely beauty of a maiden. Then he
bade</p>
<p>Athena teach her how to weave the highly wrought web, and golden
Aphrodite to shed around her head grace, and painful desire, and</p>
<p>cares that waste the limbs; but to endue her with a dog-like mind</p>
<p>and tricky manners he charged the messenger Hermes. . . . They</p>
<p>obeyed ^us . . . and the herald of the gods placed within her a</p>
<p>winning voice; and this woman he called Pandora, because all who</p>
<p>dwelt in Olympian mansions bestowed on her a gift, a mischief to</p>
<p>inventive men.”</p>
<p>Zeus presents Pandora to Epimetheus, who, though he has been warned
by his brother Prometheus not to accept gifts from the gods, feels that
he may^ yield to beauty this once. Now Prometheus has left with
Epimetheus a mysterious box, with instructions that it should under no
circumstances be opened. Pandora, overcome with curiosity, opens the
box, whereupon ten thousand evils fly out of it and begin to plague the
life of man, while Hope alone remains. From Pandora, says Hesiod, “is
the race of tender women; from her is a pernicious race; and tribes of
women, a great hurt, dwell with men, helpmates not of consuming poverty
but of surfeit. . . . So to mortal men Zeus gave women as an evil.”“</p>
<p>But alas, says our vacillating poet, celibacy is as bad as marriage;
a lonely old age is a miserable thing, and the property of a childless
man reverts at his death to the clan. So, after all, a man had better
marry — though not before thirty; and he had better have children —
though not more than one, lest the property be divided.</p>

<p>Before this Fall of Man, says Hesiod, the human race lived
through</p>
<p>many happy centuries on the earth. First the gods, in the days of
Cronus (Virgil’s Satumia regna), had made a Golden Race of men, who
were</p>
<p>Such is the theology of history with which Hesiod explains the
poverty and injustice of his time. These ills he knew by sight and
touch; but the past, which the poets had filled with heroes and gods,
must have been nobler and lovelier than this; surely men had not always
been as poor and harassed and petty as the peasants whom he knew in
Boeotia. He does not realize how deeply the faults of his class enter
into his own outlook, how narrow and earthly, almost commercial, are his
views of life and labor, women and men. What a fall this is from the
picture of human</p>
<p>ATHENS</p>

<p>103</p>
<p>affairs in Homer, as a scene of crime and terror, but also of
grandeur and nobility! Homer was a poet, and knew that one touch of
beauty redeems a multitude of sins; Hesiod was a peasant who grudged the
cost of a wife, and grumbled at the impudence of women who dared to sit
at the same table with their husbands.“ Hesiod, with rough candor, shows
us the ugly basement of early Greek society — the hard poverty of serfs
and small farmers upon whose toil rested all the splendor and war sport
of the aris- tocracy and the kings. Homer sang of heroes and princes for
lords and ladies; Hesiod knew no princes, but sang his lays of common
men, and pitched his tune accordingly. In his verses we hear the
rumblings of those peasant revolts chat would produce in Attica the
reforms of Solon and the dictatorship of Peisistratus.*</p>
<p>In Boeotia, as in the Peloponnese, the land was owned by absentee
nobles who dwelt in or near the towns. The most prosperous of the cities
were built around Lake Copais, now dry but once supplying a complex
system of irrigation tunnels and canals. Late in the Homeric Age this
tempting region was invaded by peoples who took their name from that Mt.
Boeon, in Epirus, near which they had had their home. They captured
Chaeronea (near which Philip was to put an end to Greek liberty),
Thebes, their future capital, and finally the old Minyan capital,
Orchomenos. These and other towns, in classic days, joined under the
leadership of Thebes in a Boeotian Confederacy, whose common affairs
were managed by annu- ally chosen boeotarchs, and whose peoples
celebrated together at Coronea the festival of Panboeotia.</p>
<p>It was the custom of the Athenians to laugh at the Boeotians as dull-
witted, and to attribute this obtuseness to heavy eating and a moist and
foggy climate — very much as the French used to diagnose the English.
There may have been some truth in this, for the Boeotians play an unpre-
possessing part in Greek history. Thebes, for example, aided the Persian
invaders, and was a thorn in the side of Athens for centuries. But in
the other side of the scales we place the brave and loyal Plataeans,
plod ding Hesiod and soaring Pindar, the noble Epaminondas and the
completely lovable Plutarch. We must beware o f seeing Athens’ rivals
only though Athens’ eyes.</p>

age of eighty, he</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>

<li>DELPHI</li>
</ol>
<p>From Plutarch’s city, Chaeronea, one passes at the continuous risk of
his life over a dozen mountains into Phocis, to reach, on the very slope
of Parnassus, the sacred city of Delphi. A thousand feet below is the
Crisaean plain, bright with the silver leaves of ten thousand olive
trees; five hundred feet farther down is an inlet of the Oirinthian
Gulf; ships move with the stately, silent slowness of distance over
waters deceptively motionless. Be- yond are other ranges, clothed for a
moment in royal purple by the setting sun. At a turn in the road is the
Castalian Spring, framed in a gorge of per- pendicular cliffs; from the
heights, legend said (adding another fable to his own), the citizens of
Delphi hurled the wandering Aesop; over them, says history, Philomelus
the Phocian drove the defeated Locrians in the Second Sacred War.*”
Above are the twin peaks of Parnassus, where th e Muses dwelt when they
tired of Helicon. Greeks who climbed a hundred tortuous miles to stand
on this mountainside — poised on a ledge between mist-shrouded heights
and a sunlit sea, and surrounded on every side with beauty or terror —
could hardly doubt that beneath these rocks Hved some awful god. Time
and again earthquake had rumbled here, frightening away the plundering
Persians, and a century later the plundering Phocians, and a century
later the plundering Gauls; it was the god protecting his shrine. As far
back as Greek tradition could reach, worshipers had gathered here to
find in the winds among the gorges, or the gases escaping from the
earth, the voice and will of deity. The great stone that nearly closed
the cleft from which the gases came was, to the Greeks, the center of
Greece, and therefore the omphalos, as they called it, the umbilicus or
very navel of the world.</p>
<p>Over that navel they built their altars, in older days to Ge, Mother
Earth, later to her bright conqueror Apollo. Once a terrible serpent had
guarded the gorge, holding it against men; Phoebus had slain him with an
arrow, and, as the Pythian Apollo, had become the idol of the shrine.
There, when an earlier temple was destroyed by fire (548), the rich
Alcmaeonids, aristocrats exiled from Athens, rebuilt it with funds
subscribed by all Greece and augmented by their own; they gave it a
fagade of marKlp , sur-</p>
<p>• Twice the Greeks waged Sacred Wars over the perquisites of Apollo’s
temple: once in 595-85, when the southern Greeks put an end to the
exacting of greedy tolls by the people of neighboring Cirrha from
pilgrims passing to Delphi through their port; and again m 356-46, when
an allied Greek army under Philip of Macedon ousted the Phocians who had
captured Delphi and appropriated the temple funds. The first war led to
the neutralization of Delphi and the establishment of the Pythian games;
the second led to the Macedonian conquest of Greece.</p>
<p>ATHENS</p>
<p>CHAP.V)</p>

<p>rounded it with a Doric peristyle, and supported it with Ionic
colonnades within; seldom had Greece seen so magnificent a shrine. A
Sacred Way wound up the slope to the sanctuary, adorned at every step
with statues, porticoes, and “treasuries”— miniature temples buUt in the
sacred precincts (at Olympia, Delphi, or Delos) by Greek cities as
repositories for their funds, or as their individual tributes to the
god. A hundred years before the battle of Marathon, Corinth and Sicyon
raised such treasuries at Del- phi; later, Athens, Thebes, and Gyrene
rivaled them, Cnidus and Siphnos surpassed them. Amid them all, as a
reminder that Greek drama was a part of Greek religion, a theater was
built into the face of Parnassus. Far above all the rest was a stadium,
where Greece practiced its favorite wor- ship of health, courage,
beauty, and youth.</p>
<p>Imagination pictures the scene in the days of Apollo’s festival—
fervent pilgrims crowding the road to the sacred city, filling noisily
the inns and tents thrown up to shelter them, passing curiously and
skeptically among the booths where subtle traders displayed their wares,
mounting in religious procession or hopeful pilgrimage to Apollo’s
temple, laying before it their offering or sacrifice, chanting their
hymns or saying their prayers, sitting awed in the theater, and plodding
up half a thousand trying steps to wit- ness the Pythian games or gaze
in wonder at mountains and sea. Life once passed this way in all its
eagerness.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>THE LESSER STATES</li>
</ol>
<p>In the western mainlands of Greece life was content to be rural and
subdued throughout Greek history — and is so today. In Locris, Aetolia,
Acamania, and Aeniania men were too close to primitive realities, too
far from the quickening currents of communication and trade, to have
time or skill for literature, philosophy, or art; even the gymnasium and
the theater, so dear to Attica, found no home here; and the temples were
artless village shrines stirring no national sentiment. At long
intervals modest towns arose, like Amphissa in Locris, or Aetolian
Naupactus, or little Calydon, where once Meleager had hunted the boar
with AtsJanta.* On the west coast near Calydon is the modem Mesolongion,
or Missolonghi, where Marco Bozzaris fought and Byron died.</p>
<p>• A wild boar having devastated the fields of Calydon, Meleager, sen
of Calydon’s King Oeneus, organized a hunt for it, with such aides as
Theseus, Castor and Pollux, Nestor, Jason, and the fair-faced,
fleet-footed Atalanta. Several heroes were slain by the boar, but
Atalanta shot it and Meleager killed it. Atalanta, sought by many wooers
in her Arcadian home, agreed to marry any one of them that could outrun
her, but those who lost were to be put to death. Hippomenes won by
dropping as he ran the three golden apples of the Hesperides given him
by Aphrodite; Atlanta stooped to pick them, and lost the race. Of
Meleager’s secret love for Atalanta, and his tragic death, the reader
may learn in Swinburne’s Atdanta</p>
<p>I06 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. V</p>
<p>Between Acamania and Aetolia runs the greatest river of Hellas — the
Ache- lous, which the imaginative Greeks worshiped as a god, and
appeased with prayer and sacrifice. Near its sources in Epirus rises the
Spercheus, along whose banks in the little state of Aeniania once lived
the pre-Homeric Achaeans, and a small tribe called Hellenes, whose name,
by the whims of usage, was adopted by all the Greeks. Towards the east
lay Thermopylae, called “Hot Gates” because of its warm sulphur springs
and its narrow strategic pass, from north to south, between mountains
and the Malic Gulf. Then over Mt. Othrys and through Achaea Phthiotis
one descends into the great plains of Thessaly.</p>
<p>Here at Pharsalus Caesar’s weary troops wiped out the forces of
Pompey. Nowhere else in Greece were the crops so rich as in Thessaly, or
the horses so spirited, or the arts so poor. Rivers ran from all
directions into the Peneus, making a fertile alluvial soil from the
southern boundary of the state to the foot of the northern ranges.
Through these mountains the Peneus slashes its way across Thessaly to
the Thracian Sea. Between the peaks of Ossa and Olym- pus it carves the
Vale of Tempe (i.e., a cutting), where for four miles the angry river is
hemmed in by precipitous cliffs rising a thousand feet above the stream.
Along the great rivers were many cities — Pherae, Crannon, Tricca,
Larisa, Gyrton, Elatea — ruled by feudal barons living on the toil of
serfs. Here, in the extreme north, is Mt. Olympus, tallest of Greek
peaks, and home of the Olympian gods. On its northern and eastern slopes
lay Pieria, where the Muses had dwelt before they moved to Helicon.*
Southward, and along the gulf, ran Magnesia, piling up mountains from
Ossa to Pelion.</p>
<p>Beginning a few miles across the strait from Magnesia, the great
island of Euboea stretches its length along the shores of the mainland
between inner gulfs and outer Aegean, and pivots itself on a peninsula
at Chalcis that almost binds it to Boeotia. The island’s backbone is a
range that continues Olympus, Ossa, Pelion, and Othrys, and ends in the
Cyclades. Its coastal plains were rich enough to lure lonians from
Attica in the days of the Dorian invasion, and to lead to its conquest
by Athens in 506 on the plea that Athens, if blockaded at the Piraeus,
would starve without Euboean grain. Neighboring deposits of copper and
iron and banks of murex shells gave Chalcis its wealth and its name; for
a time it was the chief center of the metallurgical industry in Greece,
mak- ing unrivaled swords and excellent vases of bronze. The trade of
the island, helped by one of the first Greek coinages, passed out from
Chalcis, enriched its citizens, and led them to found commercial
colonies in Thrace, Italy, and Sicily. The Euboean system of weights and
measures became almost universal in Greece; and the alphabet of Chalcis,
given to Rome by the Euboean colony</p>

<p>of Italian Cumae, became through Latin the alphabet of modem Europe.
A few miles to the south of Chalcis was its ancient rival, Eretria.
There Menede- mus, a pupil of Plato, established a school of philosophy,
but for the rest neither Eretria nor Chalcis wrote its name very
distinctly into the record of Greek thought or art.</p>
<p>From Chalcis a bridge, lineal descendant of the wooden span built in
41 1 B.C., leads the traveler across the Euripus strait back into
Boeotia. A few miles south on the Boeotian coast lay the little town of
Aulis, where Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter to the gods. In this
region once lived an insignificant tribe, the Graii, who joined the
Euboeans in sending a colony to Cumae, near Naples; from them the Romans
gave to all the Hellenes whom they encountered the name Graici, Greeks;
and from that circumstance all the world came to know Hellas by a term
which its own inhabitants never applied to themselves.* Far- ther south
is Tanagra, whose poetess Corinna won the prize from Pindar about 500
B.C., and whose potters, in the fifth and fourth centuries, would make
the most famous statuettes in history. Five miles south again and we are
in Attica. From the peaks of the Pames range we can make out the hills
of Athens.</p>

<li>The Background of Athens</li>

<p>The very atmosphere seems different — clean, sharp, and bright; each
year here has three hundred sunny days. We are at once reminded of
Cicero’s comment on “Athens’ clear air, which is said to h ave
contributed to the keenness of the Attic mind.”” Rain falls in Attica in
autumn and winter, but seldom in summer. Fog and mist are rare. Snow
falls about once a year in Athens, four or five times a year on the
surrounding moun- taintops.” The summe rs are hot, though dry and
tolerable; and in the low- lands, in ancient days, malarial swamps
detracted from the healthiness of the air.” The soil of Attica is poor;
nearly everywhere the basic rock lies close to the surface, and makes
agriculture a heartbreaking struggle for the simplest goods of life.*
Only adventurous trade, and the patient culture of the olive and the
grape, made civilization possible in Attica.</p>
<p>It is all the more surprising that on this arid peninsula so many
towns should have appeared. They are everywhere: at every harbor along
the coast, in every valley among the hills. An active and enterprising
people</p>
<p>• “Attica,” says Thucydides (i, i), “because of the poverty of its
soil, enjoyed from a very remote period freedom from faction 〔? 〕 and
invasion.”</p>

<p>had setded Attica in or before neolithic days, and had hospitably
received and intermarried with lonians — a mixture of Pelasgo-Mycenaeans
and Achaeans“*— fleeing from Boeotia and the Peloponnesus’in the face of
the northern migrations and invasions. Here was no conquering alien race
exploiting a native population, but a complex Mediterranean stock, of
medium stature and dark features, directly inheriting the blood and cul-
ture of the old Helladic civilization, proudly conscious of its
indigenous quality,® and excluding from its national sanctuary, the
Acropolis, those half-barbarian upstarts, the Dorians.®</p>
<p>Relationships of blood gave them their social organization. Each
family belonged to a tribe, whose members claimed the same divine heroic
ances- tor, worshiped the same deity, joined in the same religious
ceremony, had a common archon (governor) and treasurer, owned together
certain communal lands, enjoyed among themselves the rights of
intermarriage and bequest, accepted obligations of mutual aid,
vengeance, and defense, and slept at last in the tribal burial place.
Each of the four tribes of Attica was composed of three phratries or
brotherhoods, each phratry of thirty clans or gentes {gene), and each
clan, as nearly as possible, of thirty heads of families.® This kinship
classification of Attic society lent itself not only to military
organization and mobilization, but to so clannish an aristocracy of old
families that Cleisthenes had to redistribute the tribes before he could
establish democracy.</p>
<p>Each town or village was probably in origin the home of a clan, and
some- times took its name from the clan, or from the god or hero whom it
wor- shiped, as in the case of Athens. The traveler entering Attica from
eastern Boeotia would come first to Oropus, and receive no very
favorable impres- sion; for Oropus was a frontier town, as terrifying to
the tourist as any such today. “Oropus,” says Dicaearchus (?) about 300
b.c., “is a nest of hucksters. The greed of the customhouse officials
here is unsurpassed, their roguery inveterate and bred in the bone. Most
of the people are coarse and truculent in their manners, for they have
knocked the decent members of th e community on the head.”® From Oropus
southward one moved through a close succession of towns: Rhamnus,
Aphidna, Deceleia (a strate- gic point in the Peloponnesian War),
Acharnae (home of Aristophanes’ pugnacious pacifist Dicaeopolis),
Marathon, and Brauron — in whose great temple stood that statue of
Artemis which Orestes and Iphigenia had brought from the Tauric
Chersonese, and where, every four years, as much of Attica as could come
joined in the piety and debauchery of the Brauronia, or feast of
Artemis.® Then Prasiae and Thoricus; then the silver-mining region of

<p>then, at the very point of the peninsula, Sunium, on whose cliffs a
lovely temple rose as a guide to mariners and their hopeful offering to
the incal- culable Poseidon. Then up the western coast (for Attica is
half coast, and its very name is from aktike, coastland) past
Anaphlystus to the isle of Salamis,* home of Ajax and Euripides; then to
Eleusis, sacred to Demeter and her mysteries; and then back to the
Piraeus. Into this sheltered port, neglected before Themistocles
revealed its possibiUties, ships were to bring the goods of all the
Mediterranean world for the use and pleasure of Athens. The barreimess
of the soil, the nearness of the coast, the abundance of har- bors lured
the people of Attica into trade; their courage and inventiveness won for
them the markets of the Aegean; and out of that commercial em- pire came
the wealth, the power, and the culture of Athens in the Periclean
age.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Athens under the Oligarchs</li>
</ol>
<p>These towns of Attica were not only the background but the mem-</p>
<p>bers of Athens. We have seen how, according to Greek belief, Theseus
with a benevolent “synoecism” had brought the people of Attica into one
political organization, with one capitakf Five miles from the Piraeus,
and in a nest of hills — Hymettus, Pentelicus, and Pames — Athens grew
around the old Mycenaean acropolis; and all the landowners of Attica
were its citizens. The oldest families, and those with the largest
holdings, wielded the balance of power; they had tolerated the kingship
when disorder threat- ened, but when quiet and stability returned they
reasserted their feudal domination of the central government. After Kng
Codrus had died in heroic self-sacrifice against the invading Dorians, |
they announced (so the story went) that no one was good enough to
succeed him, and replaced the king with an archon chosen for life. In
752 they limited the tenure of the archonship to ten years, and in 683
to one. On the latter occasion they divided the powers of the office
among nine archons: an archon eponymos, who gave his name to the year as
a means of dating events; an archon basileus, who bore the name of king
but was merely head of the state religion; a polemarchos, or mihtary
commander; and six thesmothetai, or lawmakers. As in Sparta and Rome, so

<p>democracy, but a recapture of mastery by a feudal aristocracy — one
more swing of the pendulum in the historical alternation between
localized and centralized authority. By this piecemeal revolution the
royal office was shorn of all its powers, and its holder was confined to
the functions of a priest. The word king remained in the Athenian
constitution to the end of its ancient history, but the reality was
never restored. Institutions may with impunity be altered or destroyed
from above if their names are left unchanged.</p>
<p>The Eupatrid oligarchs — i.e., the well-born ruling few — continued
to govern Attica for almost five centuries. Under their rule the
population was divided into three political ranks: the hippes, or
knights, who owned horses* and could serve as cavalry; the zeugitai, who
owned a yoke of oxen and could equip themselves to fight as hoplites or
heavy-armed troops; and the thetes, hired laborers who fought as
light-armed infantry. Only the first two were accounted citizens; and
only the knights could serve as archons, judges, or priests. After
completing their term of office the archons, if no scandal had tarnished
them, became automatically and for life members of the boule or Council
that met in the cool of the evening on the Areopagus, or Ares’ hill,
chose the archon s, and ruled the state. Even under the monarchy this
Senate of the Areopagus had limited the authority of the king; now,
under the oligarchy, it was as supreme as its counterpart in Rome.”</p>
<p>Economically the population fell again into three groups. At the
top</p>
<p>were the Eupatrids, who lived in relative luxury in the towns while
slaves and hired men tilled their holdings in the country, or merchants
made profits for them on their loans. Next in wealth were the demiurgoi,
or pub- lic workmen — i.e., professional men, craftsmen, traders, and
free laborers. As colonization opened up new markets, and coinage
liberated trade, the rising power of this class became the explosive
force that under Solon and Peisistratus won for it a share in the
government, and under Cleisthenes and Pericles raised it to the zenith
of its influence. Most of the laborers were freemen; slaves were as yet
in the minority, even in the lower classes.”— Poorest of all were the
georgoi, literally land workers, small peas- ants struggling against the
stinginess of the soil and the greed of money- lenders and baronial
lords, and consoled only with the pride of owning a bit of the
earth.</p>
<p>Some of these peasants had once held extensive tracts; but their
wives had been more fertile than their land, and in the course of
generations their • The mark of a gentleman then, as in the days of

<p>holdings had been divided and redivided among their sons. The
collective ownership of property by clan or patriarchal family was
rapidly passing away, and fences, ditches, and hedges marked the rise of
jealously indi- vidual property. As plots became smaller and rural life
more precarious, many peasants sold their lands — despite the fine and
disfranchisement that punished such sales — and went to Athens or lesser
towns to become traders or craftsmen or laborers. Others, unable to meet
the obligations of owner- ship, became tenant tillers of Eupatrid
estates, hectem oroi, or “share -crop- pers” who kept a part of the
produce as their pay.” Still others struggled on, borrowed money by
mortgaging their land at high rates of interest, were unable to pay, and
found themselves attached to the soil by their creditors, and working
for them as serfs. The holder of the mortgage was considered to be the
hypothetical owner of the property until the mortgage was satisfied, and
placed upon the mortgaged land a stone slab announcing this ownership.”
Small holdings became small er, free peasants fewer, great holdings
greater. “A few proprietors,” says Aristotle, “owned all the soil, and
the cultivators with their Avives and children were liable to be sold as
slaves,” even into foreign parts, “on failure to pay their rent” or
their debts.“ Foreign trade, and the replacement of barter with coin-
age, hurt the peasant further; for the competition of imported food kept
the prices of his products low, while the prices of the manufactured
arti- cles that he had to buy were determined by forces beyond his
control, and rose inexplicably with every decade. A bad year ruined many
farmers, and starved some of them to death. Rural poverty in Attica
became so great that war was welcomed as a blessing: more land might be
won, and fewer mouths would have -to be fed.“</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the towns, the middle classes, unhindered by law, were
reducing the free laborers to destitution, and gradually replacing them
with slaves.“ Muscle became so cheap that no one who could afford to buy
it deigned any longer to work with his hands; manual labor became a sign
of bondage, an occupation unworthy of freemen. The landowners, jealous
of the growing wealth of the merchant class, sold abroad the corn that
their tenants needed for food, and at last, under the law of debt, sold
the Athenians themselves.“</p>
<p>For a time men hoped that the legislation of Draco would remedy these
evils. About 620 this thesmothete, or lawmaker, was commissioned to cod-
ify, and for the first time to put into writing, a system of laws that
would restore order in Attica. So far as we know, the essential advances
of his code were a moderate extension, among the newly rich, of
eligibility to the archonship, and the replacement of feud vengeance
with law: here*-</p>
<p>II2 THE LIFE OF GREECE (cHAP. V</p>
<p>after the Senate of the Areopagus was to try all cases of homicide.
The last was a basic and progressive change; but to enforce it, indeed
to persuade vengeful men to accept it as more certain and severe than
their own re- venge, he attached to his laws penalties so drastic that
after most of his legislation had been superseded by Solon’s he was
remembered for his punishments rather than for his laws. Draco’s code
congealed the cruel customs of an unregulated feudalism; it did nothing
to relieve debtors of slavery, or to mitigate the exploitation of the
weak by the strong; and though it slightly extended the franchise it
left to the Eupatrid class full control of the courts, and the power to
interpret in their own way all laws and issues affecting their
interests.“ The owners of property were pro- tected more zealously than
ever before; petty theft, even idleness, was punished in the case of
citizens with disfranchisement, in the case of others with death.*“</p>
<p>As the seventh century drew to a close the bitterness of «the
helpless poor against the legally entrenched rich had brought Athens to
the edge of revo- lution. Equality is unnatural; and where ability and
subtlety are free, in- equality must grow until it destroys itself in
the indiscriminate poverty of social war; liberty and equality are not
associates but enemies. The con- centration of wealth begins by being
inevitable, and ends by being fatal. “The disparity of fortune between
the rich and the poor,” say s Plutarch, “had reached its height, so that
the city seemed to be in a truly dangerous condition, and no other means
for freeing it from disturbances . . . seemed possible but a despotic
power.”“ The poor, finding their situation worse with each year — the
government and the army in the hands of their mas- ters, and the corrupt
courts deciding every issue against them“ — began to talk of a violent
revolt, and a thoroughgoing redistribution of wealth.“ The rich, unable
any longer to collect the debts legally due them, and angry at the
challenge to their savings and their property, invoked ancient laws,“
and prepared to defend themselves by force against a mob that seemed to
threaten not only property but all established order, all religion, and
all civilization.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">

<p>It seems incredible that at this juncture in Athenian affairs, so
often re- peated in the history of nations, a man should have been found
who, with- out any act of violence or any bitterness of speech, was able
to persuade the rich and the poor to a compromise that not only averted

<p>• “Those that stole a cabbage or an apple were to suffer even as

<p>CHAP, v)</p>

<p>but established a new and more generous political and economic order
for the entire remainder of Athens’ independent career. Solon’s peaceful
revo - lution is one of the encouraging miracles of history.</p>
<p>His father was a Eupatrid of purest blood, related to the descendants
of King Codrus and, indeed, tracing his origin to Poseidon himself.
His</p>
<p>mother was cousin to the mother of Peisistratus, the dictator who
would first violate and then consolidate the Solonian constitution. In
his youth Solon participated lustily in the life of his time: he wrote
poetry, sang the joys of “Greek friendship,”“ and, like another
Tyrtaeus, stirred the peo - ple with his verses to conquer Salamis.“ In
middle age his morals improved in inverse ratio to his poetry; his
stanzas became dull, and his counsel excel- lent. “Many undeserving men
are rich,” he tells us, “while their betters are poor. But we will not
exchange what we are for what they have, since the one gift abides while
the other passes from man to man.” The ri ches of the rich “are no
greater than his whose only possessions are stomach, lungs and feet that
bring him joy, not pain; the blooming charms of lad or maid; and an
existence ever in harmony with the changing seasons of life.”“ Once,
when a sedition occurred in Athens, he remained neutral, luckily before
his own reputed legislation making such caution a crime.“ But he did not
hesitate to denounce the methods by which the wealthy had reduced the
masses to a desperate penury.“</p>
<p>If we may believe Plut arch, Solon’s father “ruined his estate in
doing benefits and kindnesses to other men.” Solon took to trade, and
became</p>

<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>released; those sold into servitude abroad were reclaimed and freed;
and such enslavement was forbidden for the future. It was characteristic
of humanity t hat certain of Solon’s friends, getting wind of his
intention to cancel debts, bought on mortgage large tracts of land, and
later retained these without paying the mortgages; this, Aristotle tells
us with a rare twinkle in his style, was the origin of m any fortunes,
that were later “sup - posed to be of immemorial antiquity.”” Solon was
under suspicion of having connived at this and of having profited by it,
until it was discovered that as a heavy creditor he himself had lost by
his law.“ The rich protested unanswerably that such legislation was
confiscation; but within a decade opinion became almost unanimous that
the act had saved Attica from revolution.“</p>
<p>Of another Solonian reform it is difficult to speak with clearness or
cer- tainty. Solon, s ays Aristotle, “superseded the Pheidonian
measures”— that is, the Aeginetan coinage theretofore used in Attica —
“by the Euboic sys - tem on a larger scale, and made the mina,* which
had contained seventy drachmas, now contain a hundred.”“ According to
Plutarch’s fuller ac - count, Solon “made the mina, which before passed
for seventy -three drach- mas, go for a hundred, so that, though the
number of pieces in a payment was equal, the value was less; which
proved a considerable benefit to those that were to discharge great
debts, and no loss to the creditors.”“ Only the genial and generous
Plutarch could devise a form of inflation that would relieve debtors
without hurting creditors — except that doubtless in some cases half a
loaf is better than none.t</p>
<p>More lasting than these economic reforms were those historic decrees
that created the Solonian constitution. Solon prefaced them with an act
of amnesty freeing or restoring all persons who had been jailed or ban-
ished for political offenses short of trying to usurp the government. He
went on to repeal, directly or by implication, most of Draco’s
legislation; the law concerning murder remained.““ It was in itself a
revolution that the laws of Solon were applied without distinction to
all freemen; rich and • For the value of Athenian coins, see below.

<p>t Grote and many others interpreted Plutarch’s statement to mean that
Solon had depre - ciated the currency by twenty-seven per cent and had
thereby given relief to landlords who, themselves debtors to others,
were deprived of the mortgage returns upon which they had depended for
meeting their obligations.®* Such inflation, however, would have fallen
as a second blow upon those landlords who had lent sums to merchants; if
it helped any class, it helped these merchants rather than the landlords
or the peasants — whose mortgages had alrwdy been forgiven. Possibly
Solon had no thought of debasing the currency, but wished merely to
substitute, for a monetary standard that had been found convenient in
trading with the Peloponnesus, another that would facilitate trade with
the rich and growing markets of Ionia, where the Euboic standard was in
common use.®</p>
<p>ATHENS</p>
<p>CHAP.V)</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>poor were now subject to the same restraints and the same penalties.
Rec- ognizing that his reforms had been made possible by the support of
the mercantile and industrial classes and signified their accession to a
substan- tial share in the government, Solon divided the free population
of Attica into four groups according to their wealth: first, the
pentacosiomedvnmi, or five-hundred-bushel men, whose annual income
reached five hundred measures of produce, or the equivalent thereof;*
second, the hippes, whose income was between three and five hundred
measures; third, the zeugitai, with incomes between two and three
hundred measures; and fourth, the thetes, all other freemen. Honors and
taxes were determined by the same rating, and the one could not be
enjoyed without paying the other; fur- thermore, the first class was
taxed on twelve times, the second class on ten times, the third class on
only five times, the amount of its annual in- come; the property tax was
in effect a graduated income tax.® The fourth class was exempt from
direct taxation. Only the first class was eligible to the archonship or
to military commands; the second class was eligible to lower offices and
to the cavalry; the third was privileged to join the heavy- armed
infantry; the fourth was expected to provide the common soldiers of the
state. This peculiar classification weakened the kinship organiza- tion
upon which the oligarchy had rested its power, and established the new
principle of “timocracy”— government by honor or prestige as fr ankl y
determined by t axable wealth. A similar “plutocracy” prevailed, through
- out the sixth and part of the fifth century, in most of the Greek
colonies.</p>
<p>At the head of the new government Solon’s code left the old

<p>nized their official conduct during the year, and could debar them,
if it chose, from their usual graduation into the Senate. More important
still, though it did not seem so, was the admission of the lowest class
of the citi- zens to full parity with the higher classes in being
eligible to selection by lot to the heliaea — z body of six thousand
jurors that formed the various courts before which all matters except
murder and treason were tried, and to which appeal could be made from
any action of the magistrates. “Some believe,” says Aristotle, “that
Solon intentionally introduced obscurity into his laws, to enable the
commons to use their judicial power for their own political
aggrandizement”; for since, as Plutarch adds, “their differ - ences
could not be adjusted by the letter, they would have to bring all their
causes to the judges, who were in a manner masters of the laws.”“ This
power of appeal to popular courts was to prove the wedge and citadel of
Athenian democracy.</p>
<p>To this basic legislation, the most important in Athenian history,
Solon added a miscellany of laws aimed at the less fundamental problems
of the time. First he legalized that individualization of property which
custom had already decreed. If a man had sons he was to divide his
property among them at his death; if he died childless he might bequeath
to anyone the property that in such cases had heretofore reverted
automatically to the clan.“ With Solon begins, in Athens, the right and
law of wills. Himself a businessman, Solon sought to stimulate commerce
and industry by open- ing citizenship to all aliens who had a skilled
trade and came with their families to reside permanently at Athens. He
forbade the export of any produce of the soil except olive oil, hoping
to turn men from growing sur- plus crops to practicing an industry. He
enacted a law that no son should be obliged to support a father who had
not taught him some specific trade.“ To Solon — not to the later
Athenians — the crafts had their own rich honor and dignity.</p>
<p>Even into the dangerous realm of morals and manners Solon offered
laws. Persistent idleness was made a crime, and no man who lived a life
of debauchery was permitted to address the Assembly.™ He legalized and
taxed prostitution, established public brothels licensed and supervised
by the state, and erected a temple to Aphrodite Pandemos from the
revenues. “Hail to you, Solon!” sang a contemporary Lecky. “You bought
public women for the benefit of the city, for the benefit of the
morality of a city that is full of vigorous young men who, in the
absence of your wise insti- tution, would give themselves over to the
disturbing annoyance of the bet- ter women.”” He enacted the un

<p>for the violation of a free woman, but anyone who caught an adulterer
in the act was allowed to kill him there and then. He limited the size
of dowries, wishing that marriages should be contracted by the affection
of mates and for the rearing of children; and with childlike
trustfulness he forbade women to extend their wardrobes beyond three
suits. He was asked to legislate against bachelors, but refused, saying
that, after all, “a</p>
<p>To all of his laws Solon attached penalties, milder than Draco’s but
still severe; and he empowered any citizen to bring action against any
person whom he might consider guilty of crime. That his laws might be
the bet- ter known and obeyed he wrote them down in the court of the
archon basileus upon wooden rollers or prisms that could be turned and
read. Unlike Lycurgus, Minos, Hammurabi, and Numa, he made no claim that
a god had given him these laws; this circumstance, too, revealed the
temper of the age, the city, and the man. Invited to make himself a
permanent dictator he refused, saying that dictatorship was “a very fair
spot, but there</p>

<p>pupil of Aristode before the Stagirite was bom. Tradition attributed
to him the motto that was inscribed upon the temple of Apollo at Delphi
— meden agm, nothing in excess;” and all Greeks agreed in placing him
among the Seven Wise Men.</p>
<p>The best proof of his wisdom was the lasting effect of his
legislation. Despite a thousand changes and developments, despite
intervening dic- tatorships and superficial revolutions, Cicero could
say, five centuries later, that the laws of Solon were still in force at
Athens.™ Legally his work marks the end of government by incalculable
and changeable decrees, and the beginning of government by written and
permanent law. Asked what made an orderly and well- constituted state,
he replied, “When the people obey the rulers, and the rulers obey the
laws.”” To his legislation Attica owed the liberation of its farmers
from serfdom, and the establishment of a peasant proprietor class whose
ownership of the soil made the little armies of Athens sufiice to
preserve her liberties for many generations. When, at the close of the
Peloponnesian War, it was proposed to limit the fran- chise to
freeholders, only five thousand adult freemen in all Attica failed to
satisfy this requirement.™ At the same time trade and industry were
freed from political disabilities and financial inconveniences, and
began that vigorous development which was to make Athens the commercial
leader of the Mediterranean. The new aristocracy of wealth put a premium
upon intelligence rather than birth, stimulated science and education,
and pre- pared, materially and mentally, for the cultural achievements
of the Golden Age.</p>
<p>In 572, at the age of sixty-six, and after serving as archon for
twenty-two years, Solon retired from office into private life; and
having bound Athens, through the oath of its officials, to obey his laws
unchanged for ten years,™ he set out to observe the civilizations of
Egypt and the East. It was now, apparently, that he made his famous
remark — “I grow old while always learning.”“ At Heliopolis, says
Plutarch, he studied Egyptian history and thought under the tutelage of
the priests; from them, it is said, he heard of the sunken continent
Atlantis, whose tale he told in an unfinished epic which two centuries

<p>paragon of wealth, having arrayed himself in all his paraphernalia,
asked Solon did he not account him, Croesus, a happy man; and how Solon,
with Greek audacity, replied:</p>
<p>The gods, O King, have given the Greeks all other gifts in mod-</p>
<p>erate degree; and so our wisdom, too, is a cheerful and a homely,</p>
<p>not a noble and kingly, wisdom; and this, observing the numerous</p>
<p>misfortunes that attend all conditions, forbids us to grow
insolent</p>
<p>upon our present enjoyment, or to admire any man’s happiness that may
yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future</p>
<p>has yet to come, with every possible variety of fortune; and him</p>
<p>only to whom the divinity has continued happiness unto the end do we
call happy; to salute as happy one that is still in the midst of</p>
<p>life and hazard we think as little safe and conclusive as to crown
and proclaim as victorious the wresder that is yet in the ring.”</p>
<p>This admirable exposition of what the Greek dramatists mean by hybris
— insolent prosperity — has the ring of Plutarch’s eclectic wisdom; we
can only say that it is better phrased than Herodotus’ report, and that
both accounts belong, presumably, to the realm of imaginary
conversations. Cer- tainly both Solon and Croesus, in the manner of
their deaths, justified the skepticism of this homily. Croesus was
dethroned by Cyrus in 546, and (if we may rephrase Herodotus with Dante)
knew the bitterness of re- membering, in his misery, the happy time of
his splendor, and the stem warning of the Greek. And Solon, returning to
Athens to die, saw in his last years the overthrow of his constitution,
the establishment of a dictator- ship, and the apparent frustration of
all his work.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Dictatorship of Peisistratus</li>
</ol>
<p>The conflicting groups which he had dominated for a generation had
resumed, upon his departure from Athens, the natural play of politics
and intrigue. As in the passionate days of the French Revolution, three
parties struggled for power: the “Shore,” led by the merchants of the
ports, who favored Solon; the “Plain,” led by the rich landowners, who
hated Solon; and the “Mountain,” a combination of peasants and town
laborers who still fought for a redistribution of the land. Like
Pericles a century later, Peisistratus, though an aristocrat by birth
and fortune, manners and tastes, accepted the leadership of the commons.
At a meeting of the Assembly he displayed a wound, claiming that it had
been inflicted upon him by</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>the enemies of the people, and asked for a bodyguard. Solon
protested; knowing the subtlety of his cousin, he suspected that the
wound had been self-inflicted, and that the bodyguard would open the way
to a dictator- ship. “Ye men of Athens,” he warned them, “I am wiser
than some of you, and braver than others: wiser than those of you who do
not perceive the treachery of Peisistratus, and braver than those who
are aware of it, but out of fear hold their peace.”“ Nevertheless the
Assembly voted that Peisistratus should be allowed a force of fifty men.
Peisistratus collected four hundred men instead of fifty, seized the
Acropolis, and declared a dic- tatorship. Solon, having published to the
Athenians his opinion that “each man of you, individually, walketh with
the tread of a fox, but collectively ye are geese,”“ placed his arms and
shield outside his door as a symbol of resigning his interest in
politics, and devoted his last days to poetry. The wealthy forces of the
Shore and the Plain united for a moment and expelled the dictator (556).
But Peisistratus secretly made his peace with the Shore, and, probably
with their connivance, re-entered Athens under circumstances that seemed
to corroborate Solon’s ju dgment of the collec- tive intelligence. A
tall and beautiful woman, arrayed in the armor and costume of the city’s
goddess Athena, and seated proudly in a chariot, led the forces of
Peisistratus into the city, while heralds announced that the patron d
eity of Athens was herself restoring him to power (550). “The people of
the city, fully persuaded,” says Herodotus, “that the woman was the
veritable goddess, prostrated themselves before her, and received
Peisistratus back.”“ The leaders of the Shore t urned against him again
and drove him into a second exile (549) ; but in 546 Peisistratus once
more returned, defeated the troops sent out against him, and this time
main- tained his dictatorship for nineteen years, during which the
wisdom of his policies almost redeemed the picturesque unscrupulousness
of his means.</p>
<p>The character of Peisistratus was a rare union of culture and
intellect, administrative vigor and personal charm. He could fight
ruthlessly, and readily forgive; he could move in the foremost cqrrents
of the thought of his time, and govern without the intellectual’s
vacillation of purpose and timidity of execution. He was mild of manner,
humane in his decisions, and generous to all. “His administration,” says
Aristotle, “was temperate , and showed the statesman rather than the
tyrant.”” He made few reprisals upon regenerate enemies, but he banished
irreconcilable opponents, and distributed their estates among the poor.
He improved the army and built up the fleet as security against external
attack; but he kept Athens out of war, and maintained at home, in a city
so recently disturbed by class hos-</p>

<p>tility:, such order and content that it was common to say that he had
brought back the Golden Age of Cron us’ reign.</p>
<p>He surprised everyone by making little change of detail in the
Solonian constitution. Like Augustus he knew how to adorn and support
dictator- ship with democratic concessions and forms. Archons were
elected as usual, and the Assembly and the popular courts, the Council
of Four Hun- dred and the Senate of the Areopagus met and functioned as
before, except that the suggestions of Peisistratus found a very
favorable hearing. When a citizen accused him of murder he appeared
before -the Senate and offered to submit to trial, but the complainant
decided not to press the charge. Year by year the people, in inverse
proportion to their wealth, became reconcUed to his rule; soon they were
proud of him, at last fond of him. Probably Athens had needed, after
Solon, just such a man as Peisistratus: one with sufficient iron in his
blood to beat the disorder of Athenian life into a strong and steady
form, and to establish by initial compulsion those habits of order and
law which are to a society what the bony structure is to an animal — its
shape and strength, though not its creative life. When, after a
generation, the dictatorship was removed, these habits of order and the
framework of Solon’s constitution remained as a heritage for democ -
racy. Peisistratus, perhaps not knowing it, had come not to destroy the
law but to fulfill it.</p>
<p>His economic policies carried on that emancipation of the people
which Solon had begun. He settled the agrarian question by dividing
among the poor the lands that belonged to the state, as well as those of
banished aris- tocrats; thousands of dangerously idle Athenians were
settled upon the sod; and for centuries afterward we hear of no serious
agrarian discontent in Attica.“ He gave employment to the needy by
undertaking extensive public works, building a system of aqueducts and
roads, and raising great temples to the gods. He encouraged die mining
of silver at Laurium, and issued a new and independent coinage. To
finance these undertakings he laid a ten per cent tax upon all
agncultural products; later he seems to have reduced this to 5 per
cent.“ He planted strategic colonies on the Dar- danelles, and made
commercial treaties with many states. Under his rule trade flourished,
and wealth grew not among a few only, but in the com- munity as a whole.
The poor were made less poor, the rich not less rich. That concentration
of wealth which had nearly tom the dty into civil war was brought under
control, and the spread of comfort and oppor- tunity laid the economic
bases of Athenian democracy.</p>
<p>Under Peisistratus and his sons Athens was physically and mentally

<p>formed. Till their time it had been a second-rate city in the Greek
world, lagging behind Miletus, Ephesus, Mytilene, and Syracuse in wealth
and cul- ture, in vitality of life and mind. Now new buildings of stone
and marble reflected the radiance of the day; the old temple of Athena
on the Acropo- lis was beautified with a Doric peristyle; and work was
begun on that tem- ple of Olympian Zeus whose stately Corinthian
columns, even in their ruins, brighten the road from Athens to her port.
By establishing the Pana- thenaic games and giving them a Panhellenic
character, Peisistratus brought to his city not honor only, but the
stimulus of foreign faces, competition, and ways; under his rule the
Panathenaea became the great national fes- tival, whose impressive
ceremonial still moves on the frieze of the Par- thenon. To his court,
by public works and private beneficence, Peisistratus attracted
sculptors, architects, and poets; in his palace was collected one of the
earliest libraries of Greece. A committee appointed by him gave to the
Iliad and the Odyssey the form in which we know them. Under his
administration and encouragement Thespis and others lifted drama from a
mummers’ mimicry to a form of art ready to be filled out by the
great</p>
<p>The “tyranny” of Peisistratus was part of a general movement in the
commercially active cities of sixth-century Greece, to replace the
feudal rule of a landowning aristocracy with the political dominance of
the mid- dle class in temporary alliance with the poor.* Such
dictatorships were brought on by the pathological concentration of
wealth, and the inabil- ity of the wealthy to agree on a compromise.
Forced to choose, the poor, like the rich, love money more than
political liberty; and the only political freedom capable of enduring is
one that is so pruned as to keep the rich from denuding the poor by
ability or subtlety and the poor from robbing the rich by violence or
votes. Hence the road to power in Greek commer- cial cities was simple:
to attack the aristocracy, defend the poor, and come to an understanding
with the middle classes.“ Arrived at power, the dictator abolished
debts, or confiscated large estates, taxed the rich to finance public
works, or otherwise redistributed the overconcentrated wealth; and while
attaching the masses to himself through such measures, he secured the
support of the business community by promoting trade with state coinage
and commercial treaties, and by raising the social prestige of the
bourgeoisie. Forced to depend upon popularity instead of hereditary</p>

<p>power, the dictatorships for the most part kept out of war, supported
reli- gion, maintained order, promoted morahty, favored the higher
status of women, encouraged the arts, and lavished revenues upon the
beautification of their cities. And they did all these things, in many
cases, while pre- serving the forms and procedures of popular
government, so that even under despotism the people learned the ways of
liberty. When the dictator- ship had served to destroy the aristocracy
the people destroyed the dic- tatorship; and only a few changes were
needed to make the democracy of freemen a reality as well as a form.</p>
<p>5 . The Establishment oj Democracy</p>
<p>When Peisistratus died, in 527, he left his power to his sons; his
wisdom had survived every test except that of parental love. Hippias
gave promise of being a wise ruler, and for thirteen years continued the
policies of his father. Hipparchus, his younger brother, was harmlessly,
though expen- sively, devoted to love and poetry; it was at his
invitation that Anacreon and Simonides came to Athens. The Athenians
were not quite pleased to see the leadership of the state pass down
without their consent to the young Peisistratids, and began to realize
that the dictatorship had given them everything but the stimulus of
freedom. Nevertheless Athens was prosperous, and the quiet reign of
Hippias might have gone on to a peace- ful close had it not been for the
unsmooth course of true Greek love.</p>
<p>Aristogeiton, a man of middle age, had won the love of the young</p>
<p>Harmodius, then, sa ys Thucydides,“ “in the flower of youthful
beauty.” But Hipparchus, equally careless of gender, also solicited the
lad’s love. When Aristogeiton heard of this he resolved to kill
Hipparchus and at the same time, in self -protection, to overthrow the
tyranny. Harmodius and others joined him in the conspiracy (514). They
murdered Hipparchus as he was arranging the Panathenaic procession, but
Hippias eluded them and had them slain. To complicate the tale a
courtesan Leaena, mistress of Harmodius, died bravely under torture,
having refused to betray the surviving conspirators; if we may believe
Greek tradition, she bit off her tongue and spat it in the face of her
torturers to make sure that she would not answer their questions.”</p>
<p>Though the people lent no visible support to this revolt, Hippias was
frightened by it into replacing his hitherto mild rule with a r^ime of
sup- pression, espionage, and terror. The Athenians, strengthened by a
gen- eration of prosperity, could afford now to demand the luxury of
liberty;</p>
<p>1*4 the life of GREECE (CHAP.V</p>
<p>gradually, as the dictatorship grew harsher, the cry for freedom grew
louder; and Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who had conspired for love and
passion rather than for democracy,* were transformed by popular imagina-
tion into the martyrs of liberty. Off in Delphi the Alcmaeonids, who had
been re-exiled by Peisistratus, saw their opportunity, raised an army,
and marched upon Athens with the announced intention of deposing
Hippias. At the same time they bribed the Pythian oracle to tell all
Spartans who consulted her that Sparta must overthrow the tyranny at
Athens. Hippias successfully resisted the forces of the Alcmaeonids; but
when a Lacedae- monian army joined them he withdrew to the Areopagus.
Seeking the security of his children in the event of his own death, he
sent them secretly out of Athens; but they were captured by the
invaders, and Hippias, as the price of their safety, consented to
abdication and exile (510). The Alcmaeonids, led by the courageous
Cleisthenes,t entered Athens in tri- umph; and on their heels came the
banished aristocrats, prepared to cele- brate the return of their
property and their power.</p>
<p>In the election that ensued, Isagoras, representing the aristocracy,
was chosen to be chief archon. Cleisthenes, one of the defeated
candidates, aroused the people to revolt, overthrew Isagoras, and set up
a popular dictatorship. The Spartans again invaded Athens, seeking to
restore Isa- goras; but the Athenians resisted so tenaciously that the
Spartans retired, and Cleisthenes, the Alcmaeonid aristocrat, proceeded
to establish democ- racy (507).</p>
<p>His first reform struck at the very framework of Attic aristocracy
—</p>
<p>those four tribes and 360 clans whose leadership, by centuries of
tradi- tion, was in the hands of the oldest and richest families.
Cleisthenes abol - ished this kinship classification, and replaced it
with a territorial division into ten tribes, each composed of a
(varying) number of demes. To prevent the formation of geographical or
occupational blocs, such as the old parties of Mountain, Shore, and
Plain, each tribe was to be composed of an equal number of demes, or
districts, from the city, from the coast, and from the interior. To
offset the sanctity that religion had given to the old division,
religious ceremonies were instituted for each new tribe or deme, and a
famous ancient hero of the locality was made its deity or patron saint.
Freemen of foreign origin, who had rarely been admitted to the franchise
under the aristocratic determination of citizenship by descent, now

<p>matically became citizens of the demes in which they lived. At one
stroke the roll of voters was almost doubled, and democracy secured a
new sup- port and a broader base.</p>
<p>Each of the new tribes was entitled to name one of the ten stratdgoi,
or generals, who now joined the polemarch in command of the army; and
each tribe elected fifty members of the new Council of 501 which now
replaced Solon’s Council of Four Hundred and assumed the most vital
powers of the Areopagus. These councilors were chosen for a year’s term,
not by election but by lot, from the list of all citizens who had
reached the age of thirty and had not already served two terms. In this
strange inauguration of representative government both the aristocratic
principle of birth and the plutocratic principle of wealth were
overridden by the new device of the lot, which gave every citizen an
equal chance not only to vote, but to hold office in the most
influential branch of the government. For the Council so elected
determined all matters and proposals to be submitted for approval or
rejection to the Assembly, reserved to itself various judicial powers,
exercised wide administrative functions, and super- vised all officials
of the state.</p>
<p>The Assembly was enlarged by the access of new citizens, so that a
full meeting of its membership would have meant an attendance of
approxi- mately thirty thousand men. All these were eligible for service
in the hel~ iaea, or courts; but the fourth class, or thetes, were
still, as under Solon, ineligible to individual office. The powers of
the Assembly were enlarged by the institution of ostracism, which
Cleisthenes seems to have added as a protection for the young democracy.
At any time, by a majority of votes written secretly upon potsherds
(ostraka), the Assembly, in a quorum of six thousand members, might send
into exile for ten years any man who in its judgment had become a danger
to the state. In this way ambitious leaders would be stimulated to
conduct themselves with circumspection and moderation, and men suspected
of conspiracy could be disposed of without the law’s delay. The
procedure required that the Assembly should be asked, “Is there any man
among you whom you think vitally dangerous to the state? If so, whom?”
The Assembly might then vote to ostracize any one citizen — not
excepting the mover of the motion.* Such exile involved no confiscation
of property, and no disgrace; it was merely democracy’s way of cutting
off the “tallest ears of com.”“ Nor did the Assembly abuse its power. In
the ninety years between the introduction of ostracism and its disuse at
Athens, only ten persons were banished by it from Attica.</p>
<p>A similar institution was used at Argos, Megara, and Syracuse.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>One of these, we are told, was Cleisthenes himself. But in truth we
do not know his later history; it was absorbed and lost in the
brilliance of his work. Beginning with a thoroughly unconstitutional
revolt, he had estab- lished, in the face of the most powerful families
in Attica, a democratic con- stitution that continued in operation, with
only minor changes, to the end of Athenian liberty. The democracy was
not complete; it applied only to freemen, and still placed a modest
property limitation upon eligibility to individual office.* But it gave
all legislative, executive, and judicial power to an Assembly and a
Court composed’ of the citizens, to magistrates ap- pointed by and
responsible to the Assembly, and to a Council for whose members all
citizens might vote, and in whose supreme authority, by the operation of
the lot, at least one third of them actually shared for at least a year
of their lives. Never before had the world seen so liberal a fran-
chise, or so wide a spread of political power.</p>
<p>The Athenians themselves were exhilarated by this adventure into sov-
ereignty. They realized that they had undertaken a difficult enterprise,
but they advanced to it with courage and pride, and, for a time, with
unwonted self-restraint. From that moment they knew the zest of freedom
in action, speech, and thought; and from that moment they began to lead
all Greece in literature and art, even in statesmanship and war. They
learned to re- spect anew a law that was their own considered will, and
to love with unprecedented passion a state that was their unity, their
power, and then: fulfillment. When the greatest empire of the age
decided to destroy these scattered cities called Greece, or to lay them
under tribute to the Great King, it forgot that in Attica it would be
opposed by men who owned the soil that they tilled, and who ruled the
state that governed them. It was for- tunate for Greece, and for Europe,
that Cleisthenes completed his work, and Solon’s, twelve years before
Marathon.</p>
