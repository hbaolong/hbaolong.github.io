Robert Bruce to John Knox</h4>
<p>1300-1561</p>
<p>I. THE INDOMITABLE SCOTS</p>
<p>T HE warm and genial south generates civilization; the cold and hardy
north repeatedly conquers the lax and lazy south, and absorbs and</p>
<p>ransforms civilization. The extreme north — Scotland, Norway, Sweden,
Finland — fights the almost Arctic elements to provide some welcome to
civili- zation, and to contribute to it in the face of a thousand
obstacles.</p>
<p>In Scotland the sterile, roadless Highlands encouraged feudalism and
dis- couraged culture, while the green and fertile Lowlands invited
invasion after invasion by Englishmen who could not understand why
Scotland should not receive their overflow and their kings. The Scots,
anciently Celtic, medi- evally mingled with Irish, Norse, Angles,
Saxons, and Normans, had by 1500 merged into a people narrow as their
peninsula in feelings and ideas, deep as their mists in superstition and
mythology, proud as their promontories, rough as their terrain,
impetuous as their torrents; at once ferocious and tender, cruel and
brave, and always invincible. Poverty seemed rooted in geography, and
manners in poverty; so parsimony grew out of the grudging soil. The
peasants were too burdened with toil to have time for letters, and the
nobles who kept them in bondage prided themselves on illiteracy, finding
no use for the alphabet in their feuds or wars. The mountains and clans
divided the sparse population into passionate jealousies that gave no
quarter in war, no security in peace. The nobles, having nearly all the
mili- tary power in their private bands, dominated the Parliament and
the kings; the Douglases alone had 5,000 retainers, and revenues
rivaling the Crown’s.</p>
<p>Before 1500 industry was primitive and domestic, commerce was pre-
carious, cities were few and small. All Scotland had then some 600,000
in- habitants — half of Glasgow’s number today. Glasgow was a minor
fishing town; Perth was, till 1452, the capital; Edinburgh had 16,000
souls. The individual, local, and national spirit of independence
expressed itself in vil- lage and township institutions of
self-government within the framework of feudalism and monarchy. The
burghers — the enfranchised citizens of the towns — were allowed
representatives in the Parliament or Assembly of Estates, but they had
to sit, not in their own Commons as in England, but</p>
<p>602</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) FROM ROBERT BRUCE TO JOHN KNOX 603</p>
<p>amid the feudal landowners, and their voice and vote were lost in the
noble majority. Unable to buttress their power against the nobles by an
alliance, as in France, with rich merchants and populous cities, the
kings sought sup- port in the affluence and influence of the Church. The
nobles, always at odds with the kings, learned to hate the Church and
love her property, and joined in the universal cry that national wealth
was being siphoned to Rome. In Scotland it was the nobles — not, as in
England, the kings and merchants — who made the Reformation, i.e., freed
secular from ecclesiastical power. 1</p>
<p>Through its hold on the piety of the people the Scottish Church
achieved opulence amid dulling poverty and transmundane hopes. A papal
envoy, toward the end of the fifteenth century, reported to the pope
that ecclesias- tical income in Scotland equaled all other income
combined. 2 The preachers and the burghers almost monopolized literacy.
The Scottish clergy were already in the sixteenth century noted for
scholarship, and it was the Church, of course, that founded and
maintained the universities of St. Andrews and Aberdeen. After 1487 the
bishops and abbots were “nominated”— in effect appointed — by the kings,
who used these offices as rewards for political serv- ices or as
sinecures for their illegitimate sons. James V endowed three of his
bastards with the ecclesiastical revenues of Kelso, Melrose, Holyrood,
and St. Andrews. The worldly tastes of these royal appointees were in a
measure responsible for the deterioration of the clergy in the sixteenth
century.</p>
<p>But the general laxity of morals and discipline that marked the
Church in the later Middle Ages was evident in Scotland long before the
royal nomi- nation of the prelacy. “The corruption of the Church, bad
every where throughout Europe in the fifteenth century,” writes the
strongly Catholic Hilaire Belloc, “had in Scotland reached a degree
hardly known elsewhere”; 8 hence, in part, the indifference with which
the common people, though orthodox in creed, would look upon the
replacement of Catholic with Prot- estant clergymen. In 1425 King James
I complained of monastic dissoluteness and sloth; in 1455 a chaplain at
Linlithgow, before receiving his appointment, had to give bond that he
would not pawn the property of his church, and would not keep a
“continual concubine.” 4 Cardinal Beaton had eight bas - tards, and
slept with Marion Ogilvy on the night before he went to meet his Maker;
6 John, Archbishop Hamilton, obtained from divers sessions of the
Scottish Parliament letters of legitimation for his increasing brood.
The pre- Reformation poets of Scotland spared no words in satirizing the
clergy; and the clergy themselves, in the Catholic provincial synod of
1549, ascribed the degradation of the C hurch in Scotland to “corruption
in morals and profane lewdness of life in churchmen of almost all
ranks.” 6 We should add, how - ever, that the morals of the clergy
merely reflected those of the laity — above all, of the nobles and the
kings.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>604</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>ROYAL chronicle: 13 14-1554</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic fact in the history of the Scottish state is fear of
England. Eng- lish kings, for England’s safety from rear attack, time
and again tried to annex Scotland to the English crown. Scotland, to
protect itself, accepted alliance with England’s perennial enemy,
France. Thereby hangs this chron - With bows and arrows and battle-axes
the Scots won freedom from England at Bannockburn (1314). Robert Bruce,
having there led them to victory, ruled them till his death by leprosy
(1329). His son David II, like Scottish kings from time beyond memory,
was crowned on the sacred “Stone of Destiny” in the abbey of Scone. When
Edward III of England began the Hundred Years’ War with France he
thought it wise first to secure his northern front; he defeated the
Scots at Halidon Hill, and set up Edward Balliol as his puppet on the
Scottish throne (1333). David II regained the crown only by paying the
English a ransom of 100,000 marks (,667,000? ). As he left no direct
heir at his death (1371), the kingdom passed to his nephew Robert
Stuart, with whom the fateful Stuart dynasty began.</p>
<p>The war of Britain’s two halves a gainst the whole was soon resumed.
The French sent an army to Scotland; Scots and French ravaged the border
coun- ties of England, took Durham, and put to death all its inhabitants
— men, women, children, nuns, monks, priests. Playing the next move in
this royal chess, the English invaded Scotland, burned Perth and Dundee,
and de- stroyed Melrose Abbey (1385). Robert III carried on; but when
the English captured his son James (1406) he died of grief. England kept
the boy king in genteel imprisonment u ntil the Scots signed the
“Perpetual Peace” (1423), renouncing all further co-operation with
France.</p>
<p>James I had picked up, in captivity, considerable education, and an
English bride. In honor of this “milk - white dove” he composed, in the
Scots tongue. The King’s Quair (i.e., book), an allegorical poem of
surprising merit for a king. Indeed James was remarkable in a dozen
ways. He was one of the best wrestlers, runners, riders, archers,
spearmen, craftsmen, and musicians in Scotland, and he was a competent
and beneficent ruler. He imposed penal- ties upon dishonest commerce and
negligent husbandry, built hospitals, re- quired taverns to close at
nine, turned the energies of youth from football to martial exercises,
and demanded a reform of ecclesiastical discipline and monastic life.
When his active reign began (1424) he pledged himself to put down chaos
and crime in Scotland, and to end the private wars of the nobles and
their feudal despoti sm; “if God gives me but a dog’s life I will make
the key keep the castle and the bracken keep the cow”— i.e., end rob-
bery of homes and cattle — “through all Scotland.” 7 A Highland thief
robbed</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) FROM ROBERT BRUCE TO JOHN KNOX 605</p>
<p>a wo man of two cows; she vowed that she would ne’er wear shoon till
she had walked to the King to denounce the weakness of the law. “You
lie,” said the thief; “I will have you shod”; and he nailed horseshoes
to her naked feet. She found her way to the King nevertheless. He had
the robber hunted down, had him led about Perth with a canvas picture of
the crime, and saw to it that the brute was safely hanged. Meanwhile he
quarreled opportunely with obstructive barons, brought a few to the
scaffold, confiscated excess holdings, taxed the lords as well as the
burgesses, and gave the government the funds it needed to replace many
tyrannies with one. He called to the Parliament the lairds — proprietors
of the lesser estates — and made them and the middle class an offset to
the nobles and the clergy. In 1437 a band of nobles killed him.</p>
<p>The sons of the nobles whom he had cut down in life or property con-
tinued against James II their struggle against the centralizing
monarchy. While the new king was still a lad of seven his ministers
invited the young Earl of Douglas, and a younger brother, to be the
King’s guests; they came, were given a mock trial, and were beheaded
(1440). Twelve years later James II himself invited William, Earl of
Douglas, to his court at Stirling, gave him a safe-conduct, entertained
him royally, and slew him on the charge that he had had treasonable
correspondence with England. The King captured all English strongholds
in Scotland but one, and was blown to bits by the accidental explosion
of his own cannon. James III paid the penalty of his father’s
lawlessness; after many ferocious encounters he was captured by nobles
and summarily killed (1488). James IV married Margaret Tudor, sister of
Henry VIII; through that marriage Mary Queen of Scots would later claim
the English throne. Nevertheless, when Henry joined Spain, Austria,
Venice, and the papacy in attacking France (1511), James felt bound to
help Scotland’s old ally, now so imperiled, by in vading England. On
Flodden Field he fought with mad courage while many of his men turned
and fled; and in that disaster he died (1513).</p>
<p>James V was then but a year old. An involved struggle ensued for the
regency. David Beaton — an ecclesiastic distinguished by ability,
courage, and appreciation of women — secured the prize, was made
Archbishop of St. Andrews, then Cardinal, and trained the young King in
fervent allegiance to the Church. In 1538 James married Mary of
Lorraine, sister of Francis, Duke of Guise, the leader of the Catholic
party in dogma-divided France. The Scottish nobility, increasingly
anticlerical, looked with interest at the current divorce of England
from the papacy, envied English lords appropri- ating or receiving
church prope rty, and took “wages” from Henry VIII to oppose their
King’s alliance with France. When James V waged war on England the
nobles refused to support him. Defeated at Solway Moss ( 1 542 ) , he
fled in shame to Falkland, and died there on December 14. On

<p>8 his wife had given birth to Mary, who, six days old, became Queen
of Scots.</p>
<p>Beaton produced a will in which the late King had named him regent
for the infant Queen. The nobles questioned the authenticity of the
document, imprisoned the Cardinal, and chose as regent James, Earl of
Arran; but Arran released Beaton and made him chancellor. When Beaton
renewed the alliance with France, Henry VIII resolved on merciless war.
To his army in the north he sent orders to burn and destroy everything
in its path, “putting nan, woman, and child to fire and sword without
exception where any resistance shall be made,” and particularly “sparing
no creature alive” in Beaton’s St. Andrews. 8 The army did its best;
“abbey and grange, castle and hamlet, were buried in a common ruin”; 9
for two days Edinburgh was sacked and burned; farm villages for seven
miles around were pillaged and razed; 10,000 horned cattle, 12,000
sheep, 1,300 horses, were led away to England (1544). Sir James
Kirkcaldy, Norman Leslie, and other Scottish gentlemen offered to help
the English “burn places belonging to the extreme</p>
<p>Arran resumed charge of the government. To assure French help he
prom- ised the infant Queen Mary Stuart to the French dauphin; and to
prevent her seizure by the English she was clandestinely sent to France
(August 13, 1 548). The accession of Mary Tudor in England ended for a
time the danger of further English invasions; Catholicism now ruled on
both sides of the border. F rench influences prevailed upon Arran to
resign the regency (1554) to Mary of Lorraine, mother of the absent
Queen. She was a woman of intelligence, patience, and courage, who
yielded only to the overwhelming spirit of the age. Dowered with the
culture of the French Renaissance, she smiled tolerantly at the rival
religious dogmas that raged around her. She ordered the release of
several imprisoned Protestants, and allowed such free- dom of preaching
and worship to “heretics” that many Eng lish Protestants, fleeing from
Mary Tudor, found refuge, and were allowed to form congre- gations,
under Mary of Lorraine. She was the most humane and civilized ruler that
Scotland had known for centuries.</p>

<ol start="13" type="a">

</ol>
<p>The propaganda of reform was already a hundred years old in Scotland.
In 1433 Paul Crawar was accused of importing the doctrines of Wyclif and
Huss; he was convicted by the Church and burned by the state. In 1494
thirty “Lollards of Kyle” were summoned before the Bishop of Glasgow on
charges of repudiating religious relics and images, auricular
confession, priestly ordination and powers, transubstantiation,
purgatory, indulgences, Masses for the dead, clerical celibacy, and
papal authority; 18 here was almost a summary of the Reformation twenty-
three years before Luther’s Theses. Apparently the accused men
recanted.</p>
<p>Soon after 1523 the writings of Luther entered Scotland. A Scots
transla- tion of Wyclif’s New Testament circulated in manuscript, and a
cry arose for a Christianity based exclusively on the Bible. Patrick
Hamilton went to Paris and Louvain, studied Erasmus and Greek
philosophy, went on to Wit- tenberg, returned to Scotland swelling with
the new dogmas, preached justification by faith, was invited by James
(uncle of David) Beaton, then Archbishop of St. Andrews, to come and
explain himself, came, stood his ground, and was burned (1528). Two
other “professors,” as the early Scot - tish reformers called
themselves, were burned in 1534. Four men were hanged, and one woman was
drowned, in 1544; according to the not always reliable Knox, she went to
her death with a sucking babe at her breast. 14</p>
<p>These murders had been too scattered in time and place to arouse any
powerful public reaction; but the hanging of George Wishart touched the
souls of many, and was the first effective event of the Scottish
Reformation. About 1 543 Wishart translated the First Helvetic
Confession; unfortunately this Protestant declaration ordered secular
powers to punish heretics. 15 From that time the Swiss forms of
Protestantism — at first humanely Zwinglian, then rigorously Calvinist —
more and more displaced Lutheranism in the Scot- tish movement. Wishart
preached in Montrose and Dundee, bravely tended the sick in a plague,
and expounded the new faith in Edinburgh at a time when David Beaton was
holding a convocation of Scottish clergy there. The Cardinal had him
arrested and tried for heresy; he was convicted, strangled, and burned (
1 546).</p>
<p>Among his converts was one of the most powerful and influential
figures in history. John Knox was born between 1505 and 1515 near
Haddington. His peasant parents destined him for the priesthood; he
studied at Glasgow, was ordained ( c. 1532), and became known for his
learning in both civil and canon law. His autobiographical History of
the Reformation of Religion ’• within the Realm of Scotland says nothing
of his you th, but suddenly intro- duces him (1546) as the ardent
disciple and fearless bodvmiard of George</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>&lt;08</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>Wishart, bearing a heavy two- handed sword. After Wishart’s arrest
Knox wandered from one hiding place to another; then, at Easter of 1547,
in the castle of St. Andrews, he joined the band that had killed
Cardinal Beaton.</p>
<p>Feeling a need for religion, the hunted men asked Knox to be
their</p>
<p>preacher. He protested his unfitness, and consented, and they soon
agreed that they had never heard such fiery preaching before. He called
the Roman Church “the Synagogue of Satan,” and identified her with the
awful beast described in the Apocalypse. He adopted the Lutheran
doctrine that man is saved “only by faith that the blood of Jesus Christ
purges us from all sins.” 16 In July a French fleet sailed up and
bombarded the castle. For four weeks the besieged held out; finally they
were overpowered, and for nineteen months Knox and the others labored as
galley slaves. We have few details of their treatment, except that they
were importuned to hear Mass, and (Knox tells us) stoutly refused.
Perhaps those bitter days, and the cut of the over- seer’s lash, shared
in sharpening Knox’s s pirit to hatred and his tongue and pen to
violence.</p>
<p>When the captives were freed (February 1549), Knox took service as a
Protestant clergyman in England, on a salary from the Somerset govern-
ment. He preached every day in the week, “if the wicked car cass would
permit.” We of today, who do not often enjoy sermons, can but faintly
imagine the hunger that the sixteenth century felt for them. The parish
priests had left preaching to the bishops, who had left it to the
friars, who were occasional. In Protestantism the preachers became
journals of news and opinion; they told their congregation the events of
the week or day; and religion was then so interwoven with life that
nearly every occurrence touched the faith or its ministers. They
denounced the vices and errors of their parishioners, and instructed the
government as to its duties and faults. In 1551 Knox, preaching before
Edward VI and Northumberland, asked how it was that the most pious
princes had so often the most ungodly coun- cilors. The Duke tried to
silence him with a bishopric, but failed.</p>
<p>Mary Tudor was more dangerous, and after some cautious dallying Knox
fled to Dieppe and Geneva ( 1 5 54). Calvin recommended him to an
English- speaking congregation at Frankfurt, but his code and
countenance proved too severe for his hearers, and he was asked to
leave. He returned to Geneva (1555), and we may judge the force of
Calvin’s character from the influence that he now exerted upon a
personality as positive and powerful as his own. Knox described Geneva
under Calvin as “the most perfect school of Christ that ever was on
earth since the days of the Apostles.” 17 Calvinism suited his temper
because that faith was sure of itself, sure of being inspired by God,
sure of its divine obligation to compel the individual in conduct and
creed, sure of its right to direct the state. All this sank into Knox’s
spirit, and through him into Scottish history. Anticipating with horror
the rule of Cath-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) FROM ROBERT BRUCE TO JOHN KNOX 609</p>
<p>olic Mary Stuart in Scotland, he asked Calvin and Bullinger whether a
people might righteously refuse to obey “a magistrate who enforces
idolatry and condemns true religion.” They would not commit themselves,
but John Knox knew his own mind.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1555, now presumably fifty years old, he showed the
tender side of a rough character by returning to Mary Tudor’s England,
going to Berwick, and marrying Margaret Bowes because he loved her
mother. Mrs. Elizabeth Bowes had five sons, ten daughters, and a
Catholic husband. She was won to Protestantism by Knox’s preaching; she
confided her domestic troubles to him; he found pleasure in advising
her, and comfort in her friend- ship, and apparently the relationship
remained spiritual to the end. When Margaret married Knox, Mrs. Bowes
left her husband and went to live with her daughter and her confessor.
The wife died after five years of marriage. Knox married again, but
Mrs. Bowes remained with him. Rarely in history has a mother-in-law been
so loving and so loved.</p>
<p>The strange trio went on to Scotland, where Mary of Lorraine still
found tolerance useful in winning the support of the Protestant faction
in the nobility. He praised the Regent as “a princess hono rable,
endowed with wisdom and graces singularly.” 18 He organized Protestant
congregations in Edinburgh and elsewhere, and made such influential
converts as William Maitland, Laird of Lethington, and Mary Stuart’s
illegitimate brother, James Stuart, destined to be regent as Earl of
Murray or Moray. An ecclesiastical court, disliking this development,
summoned Knox to give an account of his doings. He chose discretion, and
slipped out of Scotland with his wife and her mother (July 1 556). In
his absence the ecclesiastical court burned him in effigy. This painless
martyrdom ennobled him in the eyes of the Scottish Protestants, and from
that moment, wherever he was, he was accepted as the leader of the
Scottish Reform.</p>
<p>In Geneva, as pastor of an English congregation, he developed the
full Calvinist program of ministerial supervision over the morals and
manners of his parishioners. At the same time he invited Mrs. Anne
Locke, whom he had converted in London, to leave her husband and come
with her daughter to live near him in Geneva. He wrote her irresistible
letters:</p>
<p>Dearest sister, if I could express the thirst and languor which I</p>
<p>have for your presence, I shall appear to pass measure. Yea, I
weep</p>
<p>and rejoice in remembrance of you; but that would evanish by the</p>
<p>comfort of your presence, which I assure you is so dear to me that if
the charge of this little flock here, gathered in Christ’s name, did
not</p>
<p>impede me, my presence should anticipate my letter Were it not</p>
<p>hat partly ye be impeded by your head [husband]… in my heart</p>
<p>I would have wished, yea, and cannot cease to wish, that it would</p>
<p>please God to guide you to this place. 18</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>^CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>Over the opposition of her “head” Mrs. Locke left London and arrived
in Geneva (1557) with a son, a daughter, and a maid. The daughter died a
few days later, but Mrs. Locke remained near Knox, and helped the aging
and now less comforting Mrs. Bowes to m inister to the preacher’s needs.
We have no evidence of sexual relations, and we hear of no complaint
from Mrs. Knox; we hardly hear of her at all. The old home-breaker would
be mothered, and had his way in Christ’s name.</p>
<p>He had his way in almost everything. Like so many great men, he was
physically small, but his broad shoulders warned of strength, and his
stern visage announced certitude and demanded authority. Black hair,
narrow forehead, dense eyebrows, penetrating eyes, intrusive nose, full
cheeks, large mouth, thick lips, long beard, long fingers — here were
incarnate devotion and will to power. A man of fanatical energy, who
liked to preach two or three times a week for two or three hours at a
time, and, in addition, governed public affairs and private lives — no
wonder that “in twenty -four hours I have not four free to natural
rest.” 20 His courage was tempered with timely timidity; he had the good
sense to flee from imminent death; he was accused of urging Protestants
to perilous revolution in England and Scotland while himself remaining
at Geneva or Dieppe; yet he faced a hundred dangers, denounced the
corrupt Northumberland to his face, and would later pro- claim democracy
to a queen. No money could buy him. He thought or claimed that his voice
was the voice of God. Many accepted his claim, and hailed him as a
divine oracle; hence when he spoke, said an English ambas- sador, “he
put more life in us than 500 trumpets blustering in our ears.” 21</p>
<p>The Calvinist creed was one source of his strength. God had divided
all men into the elect and the damned; Knox and his supporters were of
the elect, and were therefore divinely destined to victory; their
opponents were reprobates, and sooner or later h ell would be their
home. “We are per - suaded,” he wrote, “that all which our adversaries
do is diabolical.” 22 For such God-damned opponents no Christian love
was due, for they were sons of Satan, not of God; there was no good in
them whatever, and it would be well to exterminate them completely from
the earth. He rejoiced in that “perfect hatred which the Holy Ghost
engendereth in the hearts of God’s elect against the contemners of His
holy statutes.” 28 In conflict with the reprobate all methods were
justified — lies, treachery, 24 flexible contradictions of policy. 26
The cause hallowed the means.</p>
<p>Yet Knox’s moral philosophy, on its surface, was precisely the
opposite of Machiavelli’s. He did not admit that statesmen should be
freed from the moral code required of citizens; he demanded that
governors and governed alike should obey the precepts of the Bible. But
the Bible to him meant chiefly the Old Testament; the thundering
prophets of Judea were more to his pur- pose than the man on the cross.
He would bend the nation to his will or</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) FROM ROBERT BRUCE TO JOHN KNOX 6l</p>
<p>Xburn it with flaming prophecies. He claimed prophetic power, and
correctly predicted Mary Tudor’s early death and Mary Stuart’s fall— or
were these wishes luckily fulfilled? He was an undeceivable judge of
other men’s char - acters, sometimes of his own. “Of nature I am
churlish,” he handsomely con - fessed; 26 and he attributed his flight
from Scotland to human weakness and “wickedness.” 21 There w as a rough
humor behind his growl, and he could be gentle as well as violent. He
gave himself in full-blooded sincerity to his task, which was to set up
the sway of a cleansed and learned priesthood over mankind, beginning
with the Scots. He argued that a virtuous priesthood would be inspired
by God, so that in a society so administered God and Christ would be the
king. He believed in a theocracy, but did more for democracy than any
other man of his time.</p>
<p>His writings were no literary exercises; they were political
thunderclaps. They rivaled Luther’s in vigor of vituperation. The Roman
Church was to him, as to Luther, a “harlot… altogether polluted with all
kinds of spiritual fornication.” 28 Catholics were “pestilent papists”
and “Mass -monge rs,” 29 and their priests were “bloody wolves.” 30 No
man of that eloquent age was more eloquent. When Mary Tudor married
Philip II, Knox burst out in A Faithful Admonition to the Professors of
God’s Truth in England ( 1 554) : Has not Mary shown herself</p>
<p>o be an open traitress to the Imperial Crown of England… to bring</p>
<p>in a stranger and make a proud Spaniard King, to the shame, dishonor,
and destruction of the nobility; to the spoil from them and theirs of
their honors, lands, possessions, chief offices, and promotions; to the
utter decay of the treasures, commodities, navy, and fortifications of
the Realm; to the abasing of the yeomanry, to the slavery of the com-
monalty, to the overthrow of Christianity and God’s true religion;</p>
<p>and finally to the utter subversion of the whole public estate and
com- monwealth of England?… God, for His great mercy’s sake, stir up</p>
<p>some Phinehas, Elijah, or Jehu, that the blood of abominable
idolators may pacify God’s wrath that it consume not the whole
multitude! 81</p>
<p>But now and then, though more rarely, he wrote passages of tenderness
and beauty worthy of St. Paul, who inspired them, as in A Letter… to His
Brethren in Scotland:</p>
<p>I will use no threatenings, for my good hope is that ye shall
walk</p>
<p>as the sons of light in the midst of this wicked generation; that
ye</p>
<p>shall be as stars in the night season, who yet are not changed in the
darkness; that ye shall be as wheat amongst the cockle… that ye shall be
of the number of the prudent virgins, daily renewing your lamps</p>
<p>with oil, as they that patiently do abide the glorious apparition
and</p>
<p>coming of the Lord Jesus, whose omnipotent spirit rule and
instruct,</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP.XXVn</p>
<p>illuminate and comfort your hearts, and minds in all assaults now and
ever. 82</p>
<p>More characteristic was the First Blast of the Trumpet against the
Mon- strous Regiment of Women , written at Dieppe in 1558 against what
seemed to Knox a plague of women rulers in Europe — Mary Tudor, Mary of
Lor- raine, Mary Stuart, and Catherine de Medicis. We can understand his
horror at Mary Tudor’s application of his principles. But even if Mary
had not persecuted, Knox would have considered her a monster, a
political freak, violating the normal rule that men should govern
states. He began:</p>
<p>Wonder it is that amongst so many pregnant wits as the Isle of</p>
<p>Great Britain hath produced, so many godly and zealous preachers as
England did sometime nourish, and amongst so many learned, and</p>
<p>men of grave judgment, as this day by Jezebel [Mary Tudor] are</p>
<p>exiled, none is found so stout of courage, so faithful to God…
that</p>
<p>hey dare admonish the inhabitants of that Isle how abominable be-
fore God is the Empire or Rule of a wicked woman, yea, of a traitor- ous
and bastard; and what may a people or nation left destitute of a lawful
head do by authority of God’s Word in electing and appoint -</p>
<p>ing common rulers and magistrates…. We hear the blood of our</p>
<p>brethren, the members of Christ Jesus, most cruelly to be shed, and
the monstrous empire of a cruel woman… we know to be the only</p>
<p>occasion of all those miseries….</p>
<p>To promote a woman to bear rule, superiority, dominion, or em-</p>
<p>pire above any realm, nation, or city is repugnant to Nature,
con-</p>
<p>umely to God, a thing most contrarious to His revealed will and</p>
<p>approved ordinance; and finally it is the subversion of good order,
of all equity and justice…. For who can deny but it is repugnant to</p>
<p>Nature that the blind shall be appointed to lead and conduct such as
do see? That the weak, sick, and impotent persons shall nourish and keep
the whole strong? And finally that the foolish, mad, and</p>
<p>phrenetic shall govern the discreet, and give counsel to such as be
of sober mind? And such be all women, compared unto men in bearing of
authority…. Woman in her greatest perfection was made to serve and obey
man, not to rule and command him. 33</p>
<p>For this Knox quoted indisputable Scriptural authority; but when he
passed to history, and sought for examples of states ruined by women
rulers, he was evidently perplexed to find their record much better than
that of the kings. Nevertheless he concluded with confident
damnation:</p>
<p>Cursed Jezebel of England, with the pestilent and detestable</p>
<p>generation of papists, make no little bragging and boast that they
have triumphed not only against Wyatt, but also against all such as
have</p>
<p>enterprised anything against them…. I fear not to say that the day
of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) FROM ROBERT BRUCE TO JOHN KNOX 6 1 3</p>
<p>vengeance, which shall apprehend that horrible monster Jezebel of</p>
<p>England… is already appointed in the council of the Eternal….</p>
<p>Let all men be advertised, for the Trumpet has once blown. 84</p>
<p>Knox took the manuscript of his Blast to Geneva, had it printed
secretly and without his name, and sent copies to England. Mary banned
the book as an incitation to rebellion, and made its possession a
capital crime.</p>
<p>Knox returned to the attack in An Appellation to the Nobility and
Estates of Scotland (July 1558):</p>
<p>None provoking the people to idolatry * ought to be exempted</p>
<p>from the punishment of death The same ought to be done where-</p>
<p>soever Christ Jesus and His Evangel is so received… that the magis-
trates and people have solemnly avowed and promised to defend the same;
as under King Edward of late days was done in England. In</p>
<p>such place, I say, it is not only lawful to punish to the death such
as</p>
<p>labor to subvert the true religion, but the magistrates and people
are bound to do so unless they will provoke the wrath of God against</p>
<p>hemselves…. I fear not to affirm that it had been the duty of the</p>
<p>nobility, judges, rulers, and people of England not only to have</p>
<p>resisted and againstanded Mary, that Jezebel… but also to have pun-
ished her to the death. 36</p>
<p>Knox urged the people of Scotland to apply this doctrine of
legitimate rebellion to Mary of Lorraine. He complained that the Regent
had sur- rounded herself with French courtiers and soldiers who were
eating the spare substance of the Scots:</p>
<p>While strangers are brought in to suppress us, our commonwealth,</p>
<p>and posterity; while idolatry is maintained, and Christ Jesus His
true religion despised, while idle bellies and bloody tyrants, the
bishops, are maintained and Christ’s true messengers persecuted; while,
finally, virtue is contemned and vice extolled… what godly man can
be</p>
<p>offended that we shall seek reformation of these enormities (yes,
even by force of arms, seeing that otherwise it is denied us)?… The</p>
<p>punishment of such crimes as are idolatry, blasphemy, and others</p>
<p>hat touch the majesty of God, doth not appertain to kings and chief
rulers only, but also to the whole body of that people, and to every</p>
<p>member of the same, according to that possibility and occasion which
God doth minister to revenge the injury done against His glory. 37</p>
<p>There is a strange mixture of revolution and reaction in Knox’s
appeals. Many thinkers, including French Huguenots like Hotman and
Jesuits like</p>
<p>a # “By idolatry/’ Knox wrote in 1560, “we understand the Mass, inv
ocation of saints, adora- tion of images, and the keeping and retaining
of the same, and all honoring of God not contained in His Holy Word.”
85</p>
<p>6 14 the reformation (chap.xxvii</p>
<p>Mariana, were to agree with him on the occasional justification of
tyran- nicide. Yet his conviction that those who were sure of their
theology should suppress — if necessary, kill — their opponents harked
back to the darkest practices of the Inquisition. Knox took the
thirteenth chapter of Deuteron- omy as still in force, and interpreted
it literally. Every heretic was to be put to death, and cities
predominantly heretical were to be smitten with the sword and utterly
destroyed, even to the cattle therein, and every house in them should be
burned down. Knox confesses that at times these merciless commandments
appalled him:</p>
<p>To the carnal man this may appear a rigorous and severe judgment,
yea, it may rather seem to be pronounced in rage than in wisdom.</p>
<p>For what city was ever yet in which… were not to be found many</p>
<p>innocent persons, as infants, children, and some simple and ignorant
souls who neither did nor could consent to… impiety? And yet we find no
exception, but all are appointed to the cruel death. But in such cases
God wills that all creatures stoop, cover their faces, and desist from
reasoning when commandment is given to execute His judg-</p>
<p>ments. 38</p>
<p>We must not try Knox by our own frail standards of tolerance; he
voiced with hard consistency the almost universal spirit of the time.
His years in Geneva, where Servetus had just been burned, confirmed his
own tendency toward stem literalism and proud certainty; and if he read
Castellio’s plea for toleration, he was presumably reassured by Beze’s a
nswer to it. Yet an obscure Anabaptist in those same years penned a
criticism of Calvinism, under the title of Careless by Necessity;
Scottish Protestants sent it to Knox to be confuted, and for a moment
the voice of reason whispered amid the war of faiths. The author
wondered how the Calvinists, after knowing Christ’s conception of a
loving Father, could believe that God had created</p>
<p>Unconvinced by reason, and believing himself faithful to the spirit
of</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVn) FROM ROBERT BRUCE TO JOHN KNOX 615</p>
<p>Christ, Knox in 1559, when England was under a Protestant queen, sent
to its people A Brief Exhortation advising them to atone for the Marian
perse- cution by making the Calvinist creed and its moral discipline
compulsory throughout the land. England rejected the advice. In that
year Knox re- turned to Scotland to preside over the ideology of its
revolution.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE CONGREGATION OF JESUS CHRIST: 1557-60</li>
</ol>
<p>His appeals to the Scots to throw off the yoke of Rome had combined
with the preaching of other reformers, the influx of Protestants from
Eng- land, the infiltration of Bibles and pamphlets from England and the
Conti- nent, the land-hunger of Scottish nobles, and their irritating
displacement by powdered Frenchmen at the court, to raise the
temperature of revolt to the bursting point. The populace of Edinburgh,
firmly Catholic in 1543, bore most directly and resentfully the influx
of supercilious Gauls during the re- gency of Mary of Lorraine.
Everything was done to make life miserable for the intruders. Feeling
rose on both sides, and as the clergy supported the French, the spirit
of nationalism took on anti-Catholic overtones. Religious processions —
in which effigies of the Virgin and the saints were carried and
apparently worshiped, and relics were reverently displayed and kissed —
aroused increasing ridicule and doubt. In September 1557, a group of
enthu- siastic skeptics seized the image of St. Giles, in the “Mother
Kirk” of that name in Edinburgh, doused it in a pond, and later burned
it to ashes. Accord- ing to Knox similar iconoclastic sallies occurred
in all parts of the country.</p>
<p>On December 3, 1557, a “Common Band” of anticlerical nobles— Argyll,
Glencairn, Morton, Lome, and Erskine — met at Edinburgh (which had be-
come the capital in 1542), and signed the “First Scottish Covenant.”
They called themselves “Lords of the Congregation of Jesus Christ,” as
opposed to the “Congregation of Satan”— i.e., the Church. They pledged
themselves to maintain “the most blessed Word of God,” called for a
“reformation in religion and government,” and demanded from the Regent
the liberty to “use ourselves -in matters of religion and conscience as
we must answer to God.” They resolved to establish reformed churches
throughout Scotland, and announced that the Book of Common Prayer,
prescribed for England under Edward VI, was to be adopted by all their
congregations. The Cath- olic bishops protested against this bold
schism, and urged Archbishop Hamil- ton to suppress it. Reluctantly he
ordered the burning (April 28, 1558) of Walter Milne — an aged priest
who had unfrocked himself, married, and taken to preaching the Reformed
faith among the poor. The people had high respect for the old man; they
voiced their horror at this last burning of</p>

the site of his death. When another preacher was summoned to trial his
defenders took up arms, forced their way into the Regent’s presence, and
warned her that</p>
<p>He took his time, but on May 2, 1559, he reached Edinburgh. On May 3
he preached at Perth the sermon that let loose the revolution. It was a
sermon, he tells us, “vehement against idolatry”; it explained “what
idolatry and what abomination was in the Mass,” and “what commandment
God had given for the destruction of t he monuments thereof.” 41 The
“rascal multitude,” as he describes it, got out of hand. When a priest
in a neighboring church tried to celebrate Mass a youth cried out: “This
is intolerable, that when God by His Word hath plainly damned idolatry,
we shall stand to see it used in despite.” The priest, in Knox’s
account, “gave the child a great blow, who in anger took up a stone, and
casting at the priest, did hit the tabernacle and broke down an image;
and immediately the whole multitude that were about cast stones, and put
hands to the said tabernacle, and to all other monuments of idolatry.”
42 The crowd poured into three monasteries, pillaged them, smashed the
images, but allowed the friars to carry away whatever their shoulders
could bear. “Within two days these three great places… were so destroyed
that the walls only did remain.” 43</p>
<p>The Regent was between fires. Her brother, the Cardinal of Lorraine,
advised her to imitate Mary Tudor and cut down the leading Protestants;
while in and around Perth the victorious rebels were threatening to kill
any priest who dared to say Mass. 44 And on May 22 the Lords of the
Congrega- tion, now backed by their armed retainers, sent her an ominous
ultimatum:</p>
<p>To the Queen’s Grace Regent, all humble duty and obedience</p>
<p>premised: As heretofore, with jeopardy of our lives, and yet with</p>
<p>willing hearts, we have served the authority of Scotland and your</p>
<p>Grace… so now with most dolorous minds we are constrained, by</p>
<p>unjust tyranny proposed against us, to declare unto your Grace, that
except this cruelty be stayed by your wisdom, we will be compelled</p>
<p>o take the sword of just defense against all that shall pursue us for
the</p>
<p>matter of religion This cruel, unjust, and most tyrannical murder</p>
<p>intended against towns and multitudes was, and is, the only cause of
our revolt against our accustomed obedience, which, in God’s pres -
ence, we faithfully promise to our Sovereign Mistress [Mary Queen</p>
<p>of Scots], to her husband, and unto your Grace Regent; provided</p>
<p>hat our consciences may live in that peace and liberty which
Christ</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) FROM ROBERT BRUCE TO JOHN KNOX 6lJ</p>
<p>Jesus hath purchased unto us by His blood…. Your Grace’s obedi ent
subjects in all things not repugnant to God. — The Faithful Congrega-
tion of Jesus Christ in Scotland. 45</p>
<p>At the same time the Congregation dispatched an appeal to the nobles
to support the revolt; and another public letter warned “the generation
of Antichrist, the pestilent prelates and their shavelings… that if ye
proceed in this your malicious cruelty ye shall be treated, wheresoever
ye shall be</p>
<p>apprehended, as murderers and open enemies of God Contract of
peace</p>
<p>shall never be made until ye desist from your open idolatry and cruel
perse- cution of God’s children.” 46</p>
<p>Regent Mary entered Perth with what troops she could muster. But the
friends of the Congregation gathered in armed array, and Mary,
perceiving that she could not overcome them, signed a truce (May 29,
1559). Knox retired to St. Andrews, and, over archiepiscopal
prohibitions, preached in the parish church against idolatry (June 1
1-14). Moved by his fervor, his hearers removed “all monuments of
idolatry” from the ch urches of the city, and burned these images before
the eyes of the Catholic clergy. 47 The archbishop fled to Perth; but
the forces of the Congregation, claiming that Mary had violated the
truce by using French funds to pay her Scottish troops, attacked and
captured that citadel (June 25). On the twenty-eighth they sacked and
burned the abbey of Scone. If we may believe the sometimes imaginative
Knox, a “poor aged matron,” watching the conflagration, said: “Now I see
and understand that God’s judgments are just. Since my re - membrance
this place hath been nothing else but a den of whoremongers. It is
incredible… how many wives have been adulterated, and virgins de-
flowered, by the filthy beasts that have been fostered in this den, but
espe- cially by that wicked man… the bishop.” 48</p>
<p>Mary of Lorraine, now so seriously ill that she momentarily expected
death, fled to Leith, and tried to delay the victorious Protestants with
ne- gotiations until aid might come from France. The Congregation
outplayed her by winning support from Elizabeth of England. Knox wrote
the Queen a letter assuring her that she had not been included in his
trumpet blast against female sovereigns. William Cecil, Elizabeth’s
first minister, advised her to help the Scottish revolution as a move
toward bringing Scotland into political dependence upon England; this,
he felt, was a legitimate protection against Mary Stuart, who, on
becoming Queen of France (1559), had claimed also the throne of England
on the ground that Elizabeth was a bastard usurper. Soon an English
fleet in the Firth of Forth blocked any landing of French aid for the
Regent, and an English army joined the Con- gregation s forces in
attacking Leith. Mary of Lorraine retired to the castle of Edinburgh,
and — havincr kissed her retinue one by one-died (June 10,</p>
<p>6l8 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>1560). She was a good woman cast for the wrong part in an inescapable
tragedy.</p>
<p>Her last defenders, blockaded and starving, surrendered. On July 6, 1
560, the representatives of the Congregation, of Mary Stuart, France,
and Eng- land, signed the Treaty of Edinburgh, whose articles were to
enter deeply into the later conflict between Mary and Elizabeth. All
foreign troops except 120 French were to leave Scotland; Mary Stuart and
Francis II relinquished claim to the English crown; Mary was
acknowledged Queen of Scotland, but she was never to make war or peace
without the consent of the Estates; these were to name five of the
twelve men in her privy council; no foreigner or clergyman was to hold
high office; and a general amnesty was to be declared, with exceptions
to be specified by the Estates. It was a humiliating peace for the
absent Queen, and a remarkable and almost bloodless triumph for the
Congregation.</p>
<p>The Parliament that met on August 1, 1560, accepted, with only eight
dissenting votes, a Confession of Faith drawn up by Knox and his aides
and softened in some clauses by Maitland of Lethington. As still the
official creed of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, some major
articles should be com- memorated:</p>
<p>I. We confess and acknowledge one only God… in three</p>
<p>persons.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>We confess and acknowledge this our God to have created</li>

dominion over all that has not been, are not, or shall not be regen-</p>

<p>Baptism and the Supper…. Not that we imagine any transubstantia- tion
of bread into God’s natural body… but, by the operation of</p>

<p>purgation of the Religion appertains; so that not only are they
ap-</p>
<p>pointed for civil policy, but also for maintenance of the true
Religion, and for suppressing of idolatry and superstition whatsoever….
49</p>
<p>Pursuant to this Confession the Scottish Reformation Parliament repu-
diated the jurisdiction of the pope, made the Reformed creed and ritual
compulsory, and forbade celebration of the Mass on pain of corporal
punish- ment and confiscation of goods for the first offense, exile for
the second, death for the third. But as the nobles who controlled the
Parliament wanted land rather than blood, and did not take the Calvinist
theology literally, the persecution of those Scots who still remained
Catholic was kept compar- atively mild, and never came to corporal
punishment. Now that the nobles were allowed to reject purgatory as a
myth, they claimed to have been cheated in some part of their patrimony
by ancestral donations of land or money to pay priests to say Masses for
the dead, who, on the new theology, were irrevocably saved or damned
before the creation of the world. So the appropriation of ecclesiastical
property could be pleasantly phrased as the restoration of stolen goods.
Most of the Scottish monasteries were closed, and their wealth was taken
by the nobles. At first no provision was made by the government for the
Calvinist ministers; these had been used as ideological aides in the
revolution, but the nobles had now lost interest in theology. Knox and
his fellow preachers, who had risked and sacrificed so much for the new
order, had expected the property of the Church to be applied to the
support of the Kirk and its clergy. They petitioned Parliament for such
an arrangement; they received no reply, but were finally allotted a
sixth of the spoils. Finding this inadequate, they turned against the
grasping aristocracy, and began the historic alliance of Scottish
Presbyterianism with democracy.</p>
<p>Of all the Reformations, the Scottish shed the least blood, and was
the most permanent. The Catholics suffered silently; their bishops fled;
mos parish priests accepted the change as no worse than episcopal
exactions and visitations. Rural districts lost their wayside crosses,
ancient shrines of pil- grimage were deserted, the saints no longer
provided easeful holydays.</p>

bitter wars between Scots and Englishmen. Soon the weaker nation would
give the stronger land a king, and Britain would be one.</p>
