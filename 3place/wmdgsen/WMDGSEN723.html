<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>Voltaire in France</p>
<p>I. IN PARIS: 1729-34</p>
<p>O N returning from England, late in 1728 or early in 1729,
Voltaire</p>
<p>took an inconspicuous lodging in St.-Germain-en-Laye, eleven miles
northwest of Paris. He mobilized his friends to secure informal
annulment of his exile from France and then from the capital. They
succeeded, even to getting his royal pension restored; by April he was
again bobbing about Paris. At one gathering he heard the mathematician
La Condamine calcu- late that anyone who should buy all the tickets in a
lottery just issued by the city of Paris would make a fortune. Voltaire
rushed off, borrowed money from his banker friends, bought all the
tickets, and won as predicted. The Comptroller General refused to pay;
Voltaire took the matter to the courts, won his case, and was paid. 1
Later in this year 1729 he traveled 150 miles — in two nights and a day
— from Paris to Nancy to buy shares in the public funds of the Duke of
Lorraine; this venture too brought him sub- stantial gains. Voltaire the
poet and philosopher was supported by Voltaire the financier.</p>
<p>In 1730 we see him back in Paris, feverish with enterprise. He had
usu- ally several literary irons in the fire, passing from one to
another as if find- ing refreshment in the change without losing time.
Now he was writing Letters on the English, and a History of Charles XII,
and The Death of Mademoiselle Lecouvreur , and the beginnings of La
Pucelle ( The Maid). One day in 1730 the guests of the Due de Richelieu,
discussing Jeanne d’Arc, suggested to Voltaire that he write her
history. Jeanne had not yet been accepted as the uncanonized patron
saint of France; to the freethinker Voltaire the supernatural elements
in her legend seemed to invite a humor- ous treatment; Richelieu dared
him try it; Voltaire composed the proem that day. His plaint for
Lecouvreur was not yet published, but his bum- bling friend Nicolas
Thieriot recited it too widely, and theological hornets resumed their
buzzing around Voltaire’s head. As if hungry for ene mies he staged on
December 1 1 the story of Lucius Junius Brutus, who, in Livy’s account,
had expelled King Tarquinius and shared in setting up the Roman
Republic; the play denied the inviolability of kings, and proclaimed the
right of the people to change their rulers. The actors complained that
there</p>
<p>3&lt;5i</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>was no love theme in the plot; Paris agreed that this was an absurd
innova- tion; after fifteen performances it was withdrawn. Sixty-two
years later it was revived with great success, for Paris was in a mood
to guillotine Louis XVI.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had secured the royal privilege to publish his Histoire
de Charles XII, roi de Suede. Here was a subject that could hardly
offend Louis XV or the Church, and it should please the Queen by its
very favor- able treatment of her father, Stanislas. An edition of 2,600
copies was printed when, without a word of warning, the royal permission
was sud- denly withdrawn, and the whole edition was confiscated except a
copy in Voltaire’s possession. He protested to the Keeper of the Seals;
he was in - formed that a change in foreign policy made it necessary to
please Charles’s opponent and vi ctim, Augustus “the Strong,” who was
still king of Poland. Voltaire resolved to ignore the prohibition. He
moved in disguise to Rouen, lived there for five months as an “English
lord,” and directed the secret printing of his history. By October,
1731, it was circulating freely and sell- ing like fiction.</p>
<p>Some critics claimed there was too much fiction in it; a learned
historian has called it “a romance,” vivid in narrative, inaccurate in
detail. 2 Yet Vol - taire had prepared the book with scholarly care. He
had not only examined masses of state papers, but he had gone out of his
way to consult men who could give him firsthand information: ex-King
Stanislas, the Marechal de Saxe, the Duchess of Marlborough,
Bolingbroke, Axel Sparre (who had been at the battle of Narva), Fonseca
(a Portuguese physician who had served in Turkey during Charles’s stay
there), and Baron Fabrice (former secretary to Charles). Moreover,
Voltaire had lived for a while with Baron von Gortz, Charles’s favorite
minister; the execution of von Gortz in 1719 may have turned Voltaire to
study the “Lion of the North.” In 1740 Joran Nordberg, who had served
Charles as chaplain, published memoirs in which he pointed out
inaccuracies i n Voltaire’s narrative; Voltaire incorporated these
corrections in subsequent editions. There were other flaws, especially
in the detailed descriptions of battles. Later critics 3 argued that
Voltaire had overrated Charles as “perhaps the most extraordi nary man
who has ever been on earth, who united in himself all the great
qualities of his ancestors, and who had no other defect or unhappiness
except to have them all in excess.” 4 The last word may redeem the
hypertrophe. Voltaire ex - plained that Ch arles “carried all the heroic
virtues to that excess at which they become faults”; he listed these as
prodigality, rashness, cruelty, tyr - anny, and inability to forgive; he
showed how these faults in her King had injured Sweden; and he concluded
that C harles “was an extraordinary rather than a great man.” 5 In any
case the book was a work not only of scholarship but of art — of
structure, form, color, and style. Soon all edu-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE 363</p>
<p>cated Europe was reading Charles XII, and Voltaire’s reputation
achieved a spread and depth that it had not had before.</p>
<p>After his return from Rouen (August 5, 1731), Voltaire became the</p>
<p>house guest of the Comtesse de Fontaine-Martel in her mansion near
the Palais-Royal. She found him such pleasant company that she continued
to lodge and feed him till May, 1733. He presided with incomparable
vivacity at her literary suppers, and staged plays, preferably his own,
in her private theater. During that st ay he wrote the libretto for
Rameau’s Samson (1732). It was presumably from the Comtesse’s box at the
Theatre -Fran- §ais that he saw the failure of his Eriphile (1732), and
the rapturous success of his romantic tragedy Zaire (August 13, 1732).
He wrote to a friend:</p>
<p>Never piece was so well played as Zaire at the fourth representa-</p>
<p>tion. I wished you there; you would have seen that the public did not
hate your friend. I appeared in a box, and the whole pit clapped me.</p>
<p>I blushed, I hid myself, but I should be a hypocrite if I did not
confess to you that I was sensibly touched . 6</p>
<p>Of all his dramas this remained to the end his favorite. They are all
dead now, slain by changing fashions pf mood and style; but we should
exhume at least one of them, for they played a fond and exciting role in
his life. Zaire is a Christian captured in her infancy by the Moslems
during the Crusades, and brought up in the Islamic faith; she knows
little of France except that it is the land of her birth. She is now a
beauty in the seraglio of the Sultan Orosmane at Jerusalem. He has
fallen in love with her, she with him; and when the play opens she is
about to become his wife. An- other Christian captive, Fatima,
reproaches her for forgetting that she was once a Christian. In Zaire’s
reply Voltaire expresses the geographical de - termination of religious
belief:</p>
<p>Our thoughts, our manners, our religion, all</p>
<p>Are formed by custom, and the powerful bent</p>
<p>Of early years. Born on the banks of Ganges</p>
<p>Zaire had worshiped pagan deities;</p>
<p>At Paris I had been a Christian; here</p>
<p>I am a happy Mussulman. We know</p>
<p>But what we learn; the instructing parent’s hand</p>
<p>Graves in our feeble hearts those characters</p>
<p>Which time retouches, and examples fix</p>
<p>So deeply in the mind, that nought but God</p>
<p>Can e’er efface . 7</p>
<p>Voltaire depicts Orosmane with evident predilection as a man with all
the virtues except patience. The Christians are shocked to see that a
Moslem</p>
<p>364</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>can be as decent as any Christian, and the Sultan is surprised to
find that a Christian can be good. He refuses to keep a harem and
pledges himself to monogamy. But Voltaire is just to his Christian
characters too; he writes gracious lines on the beauty of the truly
Christian life. One Christian, Nerestam, also captured in infancy, grows
up with Zaire; he is freed on his pledge to return with ransoms for ten
Christian captives. He goes, returns, devotes his private fortune to
make up the required sum. Orosmane rewards him by liberating not ten but
a hundred Christians. Nerestam grieves that these do not include either
Zaire or Lusignan, once (1186-87) the Christian king of Jerusalem. Zaire
pleads with Orosmane for Lusignan’s release; it is granted; the aged
King identifies Zaire as his daughter and Nerestam as his son. She is
torn between her love for the generous Sultan and the de- mand of
loyalty to her father, her brother, and their faith. Lusignan appeals to
her to abandon Orosmane and Islam:</p>
<p>Oh, think on the pure blood</p>
<p>Within thy veins, the blood of twenty kings,</p>
<p>All Christians like myself, the blood of heroes,</p>
<p>Defenders of the faith, the blood of martyrs!</p>
<p>Thou art a stranger to thy mother’s fate ;</p>
<p>Thou dost not know that in the very moment</p>
<p>That gave thee birth I saw her massacred</p>
<p>By those barbarians whose detested faith</p>
<p>Thou hast embraced. Thy brothers, the dear martyrs,</p>
<p>Stretch forth their hands from heaven, and wish to embrace</p>
<p>A sister; oh, remember them! That God,</p>
<p>Whom thou betrayest, for us and for mankind</p>
<p>Even in this place expired. . . .</p>
<p>Behold the sacred mountain where</p>
<p>Thy Saviour bled; the tomb whence he arose</p>
<p>Victorious; in each path where’er thou treadest</p>
<p>Shalt thou behold the footsteps of thy God;</p>
<p>Wilt thou renounce thy Maker?. . .</p>
<p>Zaire. Dear author of my life,</p>
<p>My father, speak: What must I do?</p>
<p>Lusignan. Remove</p>
<p>At once my shame and sorrow with a word,</p>
<p>And say thou art a Christian</p>
<p>Zaire. Then, my lord,</p>
<p>I am a Christian. . . .</p>
<p>Lusignan. Swear thou wilt keep the fatal secret.</p>
<p>Zaire. I swear . 8</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>365</p>
<p>When Nerestam learns that she still intends to marry Orosmane he is
tempted to kill her. He relents, but insists that she accept baptism;
she agrees. He sends her a note appointing time and place for the
ceremony; Orosmane, not knowing that Nerestam is her brother, mistakes
the message for a love note. He comes upon Zaire as she keeps the
appointment, stabs her, finds out that the supposed lovers are brother
and sister, and kills himself.</p>
<p>It is a plot cleverly conceived, consistently and dramatically
developed, told in flowing melodious verse; and though the sentimental
passages now seem overdone, we can understand why Paris took Zaire and
Orosmane to its heart, and why the good sad Queen wept when the play was
per- formed for the court at Fontainebleau. Soon it was translated and
produced in England, Italy, and Germany. Now Voltaire was hailed as the
greatest living French poet, fit successor to Corneille and Racine. This
did not rejoice Jean Baptiste Rousseau, French poet surviving in exile
at Brussels; he judged Z dire “trivial and flat, … an odious melang e of
piety and liber- tinage.” Voltaire retorted with a long discourse in
verse, Le Temple de gotit ( The Temple of Taste), pillorying Rousseau
and exalting Moliere.</p>
<p>His head was in the stars, but he did not cease to work. In the
winter of 1732-33 he studied mathematics and Newton with his future
victim Mau- pertuis, rewrote Lriphile, revised Zaire and Charles XII,
collected materials for Le Siecle de Louis XIV, put the finishing
touches on his Lettres sur les Anglais, produced a new play, Adelaide,
and wrote innumerable trifles — letters, compliments, invitations,
epigrams, amorous ditties — all agleam with wit in smoothly polished
verse. When his landlady bountiful, Mme. de Fontaine-Martel, died, he
moved to a house on the Rue du Long-Point, and engaged in the business
of exporting wheat. Then, mingling commerce with romance, he met (1733)
Gabrielle fimilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise du Chatelet. With
that unique and enterprising woman his life was to be mingled till her
death.</p>
<p>She was now twenty-six (he thirty-eight), and she already had a
varied career behind her. Daughter of the Baron de Breteuil, she
received an un- usual education. At twelve she knew Latin and Italian,
sang well, played the spinet; at fifteen she began to translate the
Aeneid into French verse; then she added English, and studied
mathematics with Maupertuis. At nine- teen she married the
thirty-year-old Marquis Florent Claude du Chatelet- Lomont. She gave him
three children, but otherwise they did not see very much of each other;
he was usually with his regiment; she remained near the court, gambling
for high stakes and experimenting with love. When her first paramour
left her she took poison, but was forcibly saved by an emetic. She bore
with experienced composure her desertion by a second gallant, the Due de
Richelieu, for all France knew his mobility.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Meeting the Marquise at dinner, Voltaire was not disturbed but rather
delighted with her ability to converse on mathematics, astronomy, and
Latin poetry. Her physical allure was not irresistible. Other women de-
scribed her with relish. Hear Mme. du Def fand: “A woman big and dry,
without hips, a shallow chest, . . . big arms, big legs, enormous feet,
very small head, sharp features, pointed nose, two 〔!〕 small eyes of
marine green, dark complexion, . . . bad teeth.” 9 The Marquise de
Crequi con - curr ed: “She was a giantess … of wonderful strength, and
was, besides, a marvel of awkwardness. She had a skin like a nutmeg
grater, and alto- gether she resembled an ugly grenadier. And yet
Voltaire spoke of her beauty!” 10 And handsome Saint -Lambert made
clandestine love to her when she was forty-two. We cannot trust these
sisterly verdicts; femina feminae felis. We gather from her portraits
that £milie was tall and mascu- line, with high forehead, proud look,
features not unattractive, and we are co mforted to be told that she had
a “bust voluptuous but firm.” 11</p>
<p>Perhaps she had just enough of the man in her to complement the woman
in Voltaire. However, she used every feminine device to round out her
rather angular charms — cosmetics, perfume, jewels, lace. Voltaire
smiled at her love of ornament, but he admired her enthusiasm for
science and phi- losophy. Here was a woman who, even in the hum and
froth of Paris and Versailles, could retire from the gambling table to
study Newton and Locke. She not only read Newton, she understood him; it
was she who translated the Principia into French. Voltaire found it
convenient to have the same woman as his fellow student and his
mistress. Already in 1734 he counted himself her accepted lover: “God!
what pleasures I taste in your arms! How fortunate I am that I can
admire her whom I love!” 12</p>

<li>LETTERS ON THE ENGLISH</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1733 and 1 7 34, after much tribulation, he published his first
contribu- tion to the Enlightenment. It took the form of twenty-four
letters ad- dressed from England to Thieriot. These, translated into
English, were is- sued in London (1733) as Letters concerning the
English Nation. But to print the originals in France was to risk the
liberty of both author and printer. Voltaire eliminated some passages,
and tried to get governmen- tal permission to publish the rest. Refused,
he again resorted to clandes- tine publication in Rouen. He warned Jore,
the printer, not to let any of this impression circulate for the
present, but early in 1734 several copies, entitled Lettres
philosophiques, reached Paris. A pirate publisher secured a copy, and
printed a large edition without Voltaire’s knowledge. Meanwhile</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE 367</p>
<p>he and Madame du Chatelet had gone to the Chateau of Montjeu, near
Au- tun, 190 miles from Paris, to attend the wedding of Richelieu.</p>
<p>The book began with four letters on the English Quakers. These, Vol-
taire pointed out, had no ecclesiastical organization, no priests, and
no sac- raments; yet they practiced the precepts of Christ more
faithfully than any other Christians he had ever known. He described or
imagined a visit to one of them:</p>
<p>“My dear sir,” I said, “have you been baptized?”</p>
<p>“No,” replied the Quaker, “nor have my brethren.”</p>
<p>“How now, morbleul” I cried, “then you are not Christians?”</p>
<p>“My son,” he answered, in a mild and quiet voice, “do not swear.</p>
<p>We are Christians, and try to be good Christians; but we do not think
that Christianity consists in throwing cold water, with a little salt,
upon the head.”</p>
<p>“Eh, ventrebleuV ’ I protested, “not to speak of this impiety,
have</p>
<p>you forgotten that Jesus Christ was baptized by John?”</p>
<p>“My friend, no more oaths. . . . Christ received baptism from
John,</p>
<p>but he himself never baptized anyone. We are the disciples not of
John but of Christ.”</p>
<p>“Alas, my poor man,” I said, “how you would be burned in the land</p>
<p>of the Inquisition! . . .”</p>
<p>“Are you circumcised?” he asked.</p>
<p>I replied that I had not that honor.</p>
<p>“Very well, then,” he said; “you are a Christian without being cir
-</p>
<p>cumcised, and I am a Christian without being baptized.”</p>
<p>Baptism, like circumcision, said the Quaker, was a pre-Christian
custom, su- perseded by the new Gospel of Christ. And he (or Voltaire)
added a word on war:</p>
<p>“We shall never go to war; not because we fear death, . . . but</p>
<p>because we are not wolves or tigers or bulldogs but men,
Christians.</p>
<p>Our God, who bade us love our enemies, . . . surely does not want</p>
<p>us to cross the sea to cut the throats of our brothers merely because
murderers dressed in red, with hats two feet high, recruit citizens</p>
<p>while making a noise with two sticks on the stretched skin of an
ass.</p>
<p>And when, after victory, all London is brilliant with
illuminations,</p>
<p>and the sky is aflame with fireworks, and the air resounds with
thanks- givings, with church bells, organs, and cannon, we mourn in
silence</p>
<p>over the slaughter that caused such public joy . 13</p>
<p>France had almost destroyed itself to compel all Frenchmen to one
faith; Voltaire dilated on the comparative toleration of religious
differences in</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>England. “This is a land of sects. An Englishman, like a free man,
goes to heaven by whatever route he chooses .” 14 Voltaire contrasted
the morals of the English clergy with those of their French compeers,
and congratulated the English on having no abb es. “When they learn that
in France young men, known for their debauches and raised to the prelacy
by intrigues, compose tender songs, give long and exquisite dinners
almost every day,</p>
<p>. . . and call themselves the successors of the Apostles, they thank
God that they are Protestants .” 15</p>
<p>Letter vm turned the Voltairean stiletto upon French government.</p>
<p>Only the English nation has managed to regulate the power of kings by
resisting them, . . . and has finally established this wise govern-</p>
<p>ment in which the prince, all powerful to do good, has his hands tied
against doing evil. 〔Here Voltaire echoes a famous sentence from Fene-
lon’s Telemaque .〕 . . . To establish liberty in England has been</p>
<p>costly, no doubt; the idol of despotism has been drowned in seas of
blood; but the English do not think thev have purchased good laws too
dearly. Other nations have had no less troublous times, but the blood
they have shed for the cause of their liberty has only cemented their
servitude . 16</p>
<p>In England the right of habeas corpus forbids imprisonment without
stated cause, and requires an open trial by jury; in France you have
lettres de ca- chet . Voltaire noted, praised, and exaggerated, fourteen
years before Mon- tesquieu, a certain “separation of powers” in the
English government, and the working harmony between king, lords, and
commons. He pointed out that in England no tax could be levied without
consent of Parliament, and that “no man is exe mpt from paying certain
taxes . . . because he is a no- ble or a priest .” 17 In England the
younger sons of the nobility enter into commerce and the professions; in
France</p>
<p>the merchant so often hears his profession spoken of with disdain
that he is foolish enough to blush for it. I do not know, however, which
is more useful to a state — a well-powdered nobleman who knows exactly
the time when the King gets up or goes to bed, and gives himself an air
of grandeur while playing the role of a slave, … or a businessman</p>
<p>who 〔like Voltaire’s London host Falkener〕 enriches his country,
dis - patches from his office orders to Surat and Cairo, and contributes
to the happiness of the world . 18</p>
<p>Finally, in a passage that laid down a program for France, Voltaire
claimed that</p>
<p>the English constitution has, in fact, arrived at the point of
excellence, in consequence of which all men are restored to those
natural rights</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>369</p>
<p>which in nearly all monarchies they are deprived of. These rights are
entire liberty of person and property; freedom of the press; the right
of being tried in all criminal cases by a jury of independent men; the
right of being tried only according to the strict letter of the law;
the</p>
<p>right of every man to profess, unmolested, what religion he chooses .
19</p>
<p>Voltaire must have known that only a part of the population enjoyed
these “natural rights”; that liberty of person was not secure from the
press ga ng; that there were limits to freedom of speech in religion and
politics; that Dissenters and Catholics were excluded from public
office; that judges could be bribed to override the law. He was writing
no dispassionate de- scription of English realities; he was using
England as a whip to stir up re- volt in France against oppression by
state or Church. The fact that nearly all these rights are now taken for
granted in civilized countries illuminates the achievement of the
eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Just as important in its effect on modern thought was Voltaire’s
praise of Bacon, Locke, and Newton. He applied to the impeached Bacon
Boling- broke’s judgment on Marlborough: “He was so great a man that I
do not recollect whether he had any faults or n ot .” 20 “This great
man,” he added, “is the father of experimental philosophy”— not by the
experiments that Ba- con made, but by his powerful appeals for the
advancement of scientific re- search. Here was the thought that would
lead Diderot and d’Alemb ert to name Bacon as the chief inspiration of
their Ency elope die.</p>
<p>To Locke Voltaire devoted nearly all of Letter xm. He found in him
not only a science of the mind instead of a mythology of the soul, but
an im- plicit philosophy that, by tracing all knowledge to sensation,
turned Euro- pean thought from divine revelation to human experience as
the exclusive source and basis of truth. And he welcomed Locke’s
suggestion that con - ceivably matter might be enabled to think. This
sentence especially stuck in the throat of the French censors, and had
much to do with their condem- nation of the book; they seemed to foresee
in it the materialism of La Met- trie and Diderot. Voltaire refused to
commit himself to materialism, but he revised Descartes’ “I think,
therefore I am” into “I am a body and I think; I know no more.”</p>
<p>Letter xiv advised the French to free themselves from Descartes and
study Newton. “Public opinion in England on these two thinkers is that
the first was a dreamer and the other a sage.” Voltaire honored
Descartes’ con - tribution to geometry, but he could not assimilate the
whirlpools of the Cartesian cosmology. He admitted that there was
something dreamy, or at least soporific, in Newton’s essays on ancient
chronology and the Apoca - lypse; Newton wrote these, Voltaire amiably
suggested, “to console man - kind for his otherwise too great
superiority over them .” 21 He himself as yet found Newton very
difficult, but the assemblage of men prominent in gov-</p>
<p>370</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>ernment as well as in science at Newton’s funeral had left upon him
an im - pression that determined him to study the Principia and make
himself an apostle of Newton to France. Here too he sowed the seed of
the Encyclo- pedic and the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Finally, he shocked religious thought in France by subjecting the
Pensees of Pascal to a hostile critique. He had not intended to include
this in the Lettres; it had nothing to do with England, but he had sent
it from England to Thieriot in 1728; the piratical publisher appended it
as Letter xxv; and the result was that the Jansenists — who worshiped
Pascal and controlled the Parlement of Paris — now exceeded the Jesuits
(who had no love for Pascal) in denouncing Voltaire. Voltaire was
constitutionally incapable of agreeing with Pascal: he was at this stage
(except in his plays) a militant rationalist who had not yet found a
place for feeling in his philosophy. Still young, exuberant, enjoying
life amid his heroic tribulations, he reacted against Pas- cal’s
despondent pessimism: “I shall dare to take the part of the human
race</p>
<p>These Remarques sur les Pensees de Pascal are not Voltaire at his
best. He had not prepared them for publication, he had no chance to
revise them; and later events — like the Lisbon earthquake — removed the
youthful bloom from his optimism. Despite this unconsidered appendage
the Lettres philosophiques were a milestone in French literature and
thought. Here for the first time appeared the short, sharp sentences,
the unmistakable clarity, the gay wit and deflating irony, that were
henceforth to be a literary signa- ture overriding all cautious denials
of authorship; this book and the Lettres per sane s set the tone of
French prose from the Regency to the Revolution. Moreover, it
constituted one of the strongest links in that junction of the French
and British intellects which Buckle rated “by far the most impor - tant
fact in the history of the eighteenth centur y.” 25 It was a declaration
of war and a map of campaign. Rousseau said of these letters that they
played a large part in the awakening of his mind; there must have been
thousands of young Frenchmen who owed the book a similar debt. Lafayette
said it made him a republican at the age of nine. Heine thought “it was
not neces - sary for the censor to condemn this book; it would have been
read without that.” 26</p>
<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>Church and state, King and Parlement, felt that they could not bear
in si- lence so many wounds. The printer was sent to the Bastille, and a
lettre de cachet was issued for the arrest of Voltaire wherever found.
On May 11, 1734, an agent of police appeared at Montjeu with a warrant,
but Voltaire, wa rned probably by Maupertuis and d’Argental, had left
five days before, and was already beyond the frontier of France. On June
10, by an order of the Parlement, all discoverable copies of the book
were burned by the pub- lic hangman in the courtyard of t he Palais de
Justice as “scandalous, con - trary to religion, good morals, and the
respect due to authority.”</p>
<p>Before learning of Voltaire’s safe arrival in Lorraine, the Marquise
du Chatelet wrote to a friend: “To know that he, with such health and
imagi - nation as he has, is in a prison … I do not find in myself
constancy</p>
<p>enough to support the idea.” She and the Duchesse de Richelieu
enlisted the aid of titled women to obtain a pardon. The Keeper of the
Seals agreed to have the order of arrest rescinded if Voltaire would
disavow authorship of the book; he knew quite well that Voltaire was the
author, but lent him- self to the ruse; he was one of a succession of
governmental officials who tempered censorship now and then by looking
the other way. Voltaire readily agreed to disclaim authorship; this
would be a white lie eminently forgivable; besides, the book that he was
to disavow had been distributed without his consent. To the Duchesse
d’Aiguillon he wrote:</p>
<p>They say I must retract. Very willingly. I will declare that Pascal
is</p>
<p>always right; . . . that all priests are gentle and disinterested; .
. .</p>
<p>that monks are neither proud nor given to intrigue nor stinking; that
the Holy Inquisition is the triumph of humanity and tolerance. 27</p>
<p>The order of arrest was withdrawn, with the proviso that Voltaire
should remain at a respectful distance from Paris. He passed from
chateau to cha- teau near the border, and was welcomed by the nobles,
who were not very pious and not at all fond of a centralized and
absolute monarchy. He re- ceived an invitation to reside at the court of
Holstein, with a pension of ten thousand francs a year; he refused it.
28 In July he retired to the chateau of Mme. du Chatelet at Cirey in
Champagne. There, as the paying guest of his mistress and her husband,
he entered upon the happiest years of his life.</p>

</ol>
<p>Cirey is now a village of 230 inhabitants in the departement of
Haute- Marne in northeastern France, only a few miles from Lorraine.
Mme. Denis, Voltaire’s niece, described it in 1738 as “a frightful
solitude . . .</p>
<p>372</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>tains and uncultivated land.” 29 Perhaps Voltaire loved it for this
isolation— a quiet spot where he could study science, write history and
philosophy, and be forgotten by the French government, or, if harassed
by it, could es- cape in an hour’s dash into Lorraine.</p>
<p>The chateau was a dilapidated relic of the thirteenth century, rarely
used by the Du Chatelets, and long since unfit for civilized living. The
Marquis had little interest or funds to repair it; Voltaire lent him
forty thousand francs for this purpose at five per cent interest, which
the Marquis was not called upon to pay. A few rooms were made habitable;
Voltaire moved in, ordered the construction of a new wing, and
superintended the rehabilita- tion of the rest. In November the Marquise
arrived with two hundred par- cels of baggage, revised Voltaire’s
repairs to her taste, and settled down— she who had spent most of her
adult years at or near the court — to a life of study and bigamous
devotion. The amiable Marquis stayed with her and Voltaire, on and off,
till 1740, gracefully keeping a separate apartment and separate
mealtimes; thereafter he spent most of his time with his regiment.
France marveled less at the husband’s complaisance than at the lovers’
fi - delity.</p>
<p>In December Madame returned to Paris, attended the Duchesse de Ri-
chelieu in her confinement, and persuaded the government to cancel the
ex- clusion of Voltaire from the capital (March 2, 1735). He came to
Paris, and stayed there a few weeks with his mistress. But his past
pursued him. Parts of his scandalous Pucelle were going the rounds; he
himself could not resist reading juicy passages to his friends; and now
his anti-Christian Epis- tle to Urania , written fifteen years before,
was issued by a pirate publisher. He denied its authorship as a matter
of course, but it had the earmarks of his style and thought, and no one
believed his denial. Again he fled to Lor- raine, and thence cautiously
back to Cirey. He received indirect assurances from the government that
if he remained there, and gave no further of- fense, he would not be
molested. Mme. du Chatelet rejoined him, bringing her daughter, her son,
and their tutor; her third child had died. Now at last this philosophic
honeymoon began.</p>
<p>Each of the philosophers had a separate suite of rooms, at opposite
ends of the chateau. Voltaire’s was composed of anteroom ,
study-library, and bedroom. The walls were hung with red velvet
tapestries or with pictures; of these he accumulated a costly
collection, including a Titian and several Teniers; and there were
statues of Venus, Cupid, and Hercules, and a large portrait of their new
friend the Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia. There was such cleanliness
in these rooms, according to Mme. de Graffigny, that “one could kiss the
floor.” 30 The Marquise’s apartment was in different taste, light yellow
and pale blue, with paintings by Veronese and Watteau,</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>373</p>
<p>picture ceiling, marble floor, and a hundred little boxes, bottles,
rings, gems, and toilet articles lying about in her pretty boudoir.
Between the two suites ran a large hall fitted up as a laboratory for
physics and chemistry, with air pumps, thermometers, furnaces,
crucibles, telescope, microscopes, prisms, compasses, scales. There were
several guest rooms, not so well equipped. Despite tapestries, the
woodland winds still slipped through cracks, win- dows, and doors; in
winter it took thirty-six fireplaces, burning six cords of wood per day,
to keep the chateau tolerably warm. We can imagine the number of
servants. Add a theater, for Voltaire loved to act, especially in his
own plays; the Marquise, he assures us, was an excellent actress;
guests, tutor, and servants rounded out the cast. Sometimes operas were
sung there, for Madame (on the same authority) had a “voix divine.” Also
there were</p>
<p>But play was an incident, work was the order of the day. The
lovers</p>
<p>sometimes collaborated in the laboratory, but usually they worked in
their separate quarters, hardly seeing each other during the day except
at the main meal, which came toward noon. The Marquis quit the table
before the conversation began; Voltaire, too, often left the others to
entertain them- selves, and stole back to his study. He had his own
silver service there, for he sometimes ate alone. We rightly think of
him as a vivacious talker; he could be the life of any gathering; but he
hated small talk. “It is frightful,” he said, “the time we spend in talk
. We ought not to lose a minute. The greatest expenditure we can make is
of time .” 31 Occasionally he hunted venison for exercise.</p>
<p>We must not picture the philosophic mates as angels. Madame could be
harsh, overbearing, even cruel. She was a bit straitened in purse,
severe and parsimonious with her servants, and she protested when
Voltaire paid his more. She had no physical modesty; she thought nothing
of completely dis- robing in the presence of their secretary Longchamp,
or of having him pour warm water upon her as she lay in the bath . 32
She secretly read some of the letters written by or to her guests; but
of this we have only the testi- mony of another woman . 33 As for V
oltaire, he had a hundred faults, which will appear in due course. He
was as vain as a poet and could pout like a child; he took offense
readily and had many a quarrel with his lady. These, however, were but
passing clouds that accentuated the sunshine of their days. Voltaire
soon recovered his spirits and good cheer, and never tired of telling
his friends how happy he was, and how he loved Madame, in his own
passionless way. He wrote to her a hundred little poems of affection,
each a cameo of compact art. One such literary gem accompanied a ring
into which his portrait had been engraved:</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Barter grave ces traits destines pour vos yeux;</p>
<p>Avec quelque plaisir daignez les reconnoitre!</p>
<p>Les votres dans mon coeur furent graves bien mieux,</p>
<p>Mais ce fut par un plus grand maitre , 34 *</p>
<p>And she, for her part, said, “I could not be away from him for two
hours without pain.” 35</p>
<p>Of the two she was the more deeply devoted to science. She exercised
the unwritten law of feminine domain by hiding the half-finished manu-
script of Voltaire’s Siecle de Louis XIV, and sternly directing him to
sci - ence as the proper study of modern man. Mme. de Graffigny, who was
their guest in 1738, described her as more assiduous in her scientific
pur- suits than Voltaire, as spending most of the day and much of the
night at her desk, sometimes till five or seven o’clock in the morning.
38 Maupertuis came occasionally to Cirey to continue her lessons in
mathematics and physics; perhaps those visits, a nd Madame’s open
admiration for Mauper - tuis’ intellectual attainments, stirred in the
sensitive Voltaire a jealousy that</p>
<p>Was she a real scholar or did she put on science as a fashionable
dress? Mme. du Deffand and several other ladies thought that her studies
were a pose. The Marquise de Crequi alleged that “algebra and geometry
had the effect of making her half crazy, while her pedantry on the
subject of her learning made her insupportable. In reality she muddled
up everything that she had learned.” 37 But hear Mme. de Graffigny
describe a session at Cirey:</p>
<p>This morning the lady of the house read us a geometrical calculation
of an English dreamer. . . . The book was in Latin, and she read it
to</p>
<p>us in French. She hesitated a moment at each period, and I supposed
it was to understand the mathematical calculations. But no; she
translated easily the mathematical terms; the numbers, the
extravagances, nothing stopped her. Is not that really astonishing?
38</p>
<p>Voltaire assured Thieriot that Mme. du Chatelet understood English
well, knew all the philosophical works of Cicero, and was deeply
interested in mathematics and metaphysics. 39 She once bettered the
physicist and Academician de Mairan in a discussion of kinetic energy.
40 She read Cicero and Virgil in Latin, Ariosto and Tasso in Italian,
Locke and Newton in English. When Algarotti visited Cirey she conversed
with him in Italian. She wrote, but did not publish, a six-volume Examen
de Genese, based on the work of English deists, and exposing the
contradictions, improbabilities, immoralities, and injustices of the
Bible. Her Traite de la bonheur was an</p>

<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>375</p>
<p>original discourse on the foundations of happiness; these, she
thought, were health, love, virtue, rational self-indulgence, and the
pursuit of knowledge. She translated Newton’s Principia from Latin into
French; edited by Clair - aut, it was published in 1756, six years after
her death. She composed an Exposition abregee du systeme du monde, which
was published in 1759, and which Voltaire, perhaps gallantly, pronounced
superior to his Elements de la philosophie de Newton (1738). 41 When the
Academie des Sciences offered (1738) a prize for the best essay on the
nature and diffusion of fire, and Voltaire entered the competition, she
secretly wrote and submitted her own essay, incognito; she wrote it at
night to conceal it from Voltaire, “since in my essay I opposed nearly
all of his ideas.” 42 Neither won the prize, which went to Euler, but
her paper, as well as Voltaire’s, was printed by the Academy. Each
praised the other’s work in an ecstasy of amor in - tellectualis.</p>
<p>For his own essay Voltaire carried on many experiments, some in his
lab- oratory, some in a foundry at neighboring Chaumont. 43 He studied
calcina- tion, and came close to discovering oxygen. 44 In May, 1737, we
find him writing to the Abbe Moussinot in Paris, asking for a chemist to
come and live at Cirey for a hundred ecus per year and board; but the
chemist must also know how to say Mass on Sundays and holydays in the
chapel of the chateau. 45 As for himself, he believed now only in
science. “That which our eyes and mathematics demonstrate to us,” he
wrote in 1741, “we must hold to be true. In all the rest we must say
only, ‘I do not know.’” 46 Philosophy at this time meant to him only a
summary of science.</p>
<p>It was in this sense that he used the term in his Elements de la
philosophie de Newton. He sought the royal privilege for its
publication, but was re- fused. An edition appeared in Amsterdam (1738)
without his consent; his own edition came out there in 1741. It was a
substantial volume of 440 pages, a splendid example of what the French,
with no derogatory intent, call vulgarisation — that is, an attempt to
make the difficult and recondite</p>
<p>Despite these efforts Voltaire had neither the spirit nor the
limitations of</p>
<p>37 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>a scientist. It is said that he failed as a scientist; we should
rather say that he was too rich and varied a personality to give himself
fully and finally to sci- ence. He used science as a liberation of the
mind; that done, he passed on to poetry, drama, philosophy in its
largest sense, and humanitarian involve- ment in the basic affairs of
his time. “We should introduce into our exist - ence all imaginable
modes, and open every door of the soul to all sorts of knowledge and
feeling. So long as these do not go in pell-mell, there is plenty of
room for everything.” 48 So he wrote at this time (1734) a Dis - cours
sur I’homme , largely echoing Pope’s Essay on Man, even to sanction -
ing the quite un- Voltairean idea that “all is right.” 49 He composed in
these years most of La Pucelle d’ Orleans, perhaps as a relief from
Newton. And he expounded his own philosophy in a Traite de metaphysique
which he judiciously refrained from publishing.</p>
<p>It was as unique as all his productions. He began by imagining
himself to be a visitor from Jupiter or Mars; so, he thought, he could
not be expected to reconcile his views with the Bible. Landing among the
Kaffirs of South Africa, he concludes that man is an animal with black
skin and wooly hair. Passing to India, he finds men with yellow skin and
straight hair; he con- cludes that man is a genus composed of several
distinct species, not all de- rived from one ancestor. 50 He judges from
the appearances of order in the world, and of purposeful design of
organs in animals, that there is an intel- ligent deity designing the
whole. He sees no evidence of an immortal soul in man, but he feels that
his will is free. Long before Hume and Adam Smith, he derives the moral
sense from fellow feeling, sym-pathy. Long be- fore Helvetius and
Bentham, he defines virtue and vice as “that which is useful or
injurious to the society.” 51 We shall look at the Traite again</p>
<p>How different from t his treatise was Voltaire’s rollicking
versification of Jeanne d’ Arc’s history! If we open that mock epic
today we must remem - ber that French speech and French literature were
freer then than in the first half of the twentieth century. We have seen
an example in the Lettres persanes of the magistrate Montesquieu;
Diderot was even freer, not only in Les Bijoux indiscrets but in Jacques
le fataliste. Compared with these La Pucelle, as finally published by
Voltaire in 1756, is innocuously mild; pre- sumably the privately
circulated original was more Rabelaisian. The grave Condorcet defended
the poem, and we are told that Malesherbes, a high official in the
French government, learned it by heart. 52 A sedulous search has found
some mildly sensual passages in the twenty-one cantos; they are as
forgivable as similar pictures in Ariosto; and they are redeemed by many
passages of graphic description and vigorous narrative. Like many
French- men of his time, Voltaire thought of Jeanne as a healthy and
simple peasant girl, probably of bastard birth, given to superstitions
and hearing “voices”;</p>
<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>and he suspected that France would have been saved from the Goddams
(Jeanne’s name for the English invaders) even if she had never been
born. Otherwise, and allowing for some historical blunders, he told the
story faithfully, merely salting it with humor.</p>
<p>Turning his head toward the dauntless Joan,</p>
<p>Thus spake the King, in a majestic tone</p>
<p>Which any might have feared but her alone:</p>
<p>“Joan, hear me: if thou art a maid, avow.”</p>
<p>She answered: “Oh, great Sire, give orders now</p>
<p>That doctors sage, with spectacles on nose,</p>
<p>Who, versed in female mysteries, can depose;</p>
<p>That clerks, apothecaries, matrons tried</p>
<p>Be called at once the matter to decide;</p>
<p>Let them all scrutinize, and let them see.”</p>
<p>By this sage answer Charles knew she must be</p>
<p>Inspired and blessed with sweet virginity.</p>
<p>“Good,” said the King, “since you know so well,</p>
<p>Daughter of heaven, I prithee, instant tell</p>
<p>What with my fair one passed last night in bed?</p>
<p>Speak free.” “Why, nothing happened,” Joan said.</p>
<p>Surprised, the King knelt down and cried aloud,</p>
<p>“A miracle!” then crossed himself and bowed . 53</p>
<p>Voltaire amused his guests by reading a canto or two of La Pucelle to
warm a winter evening. Usually Mme. du Chatelet kept the swelling manu-
script under lock and key, but Voltaire carelessly allowed some parts of
it to circulate among his friends. Parts were copied, and went the
rounds of impolite society more widely than was wise. The fear that the
French gov- ernment would prosecute him — not for the obscenity of the
poem but for its incidental satire of monks, Jesuits, prelates, popes,
and the Inquisition — became one of the haunting worries of Voltaire’s
life.</p>
<p>He was more serious with Alzire , which had a happy premiere at the
Theatre-Frangais on January 27, 1736. It made theatrical history by
dress- ing the actors in the costumes of the indicated time and place —
the Spanish conquest and spoliation of Peru. Alvarez, the Spanish
governor of the fallen state, pleads with the victors to abate their
cruelty and greed:</p>
<p>We are the scourge</p>
<p>Of this new world, vain, covetous, unjust. . . .</p>
<p>We alone</p>
<p>Are the barbarians here; the simple savage,</p>
<p>Tho’ fierce by nature, is in courage equal,</p>
<p>In goodness our superior . 54</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>378</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Paris acclaimed the piece for twenty successive nights, paying 53,640
li- vres. Voltaire gave his share of the receipts to the players.</p>
<p>On August 8, 1736, he received his first letter from Frederick of
Prussia; so began a remarkable correspondence and a tragic friendship.
In this same year he published a poem, Le Mondain ( The Worldly Man),
which reads like an answer, by anticipation, to Rousseau’s Discourse on
the Arts and Sciences (1750). Voltaire had no patience with the
visionaries who were idealizing the “friendly and flowing savage,” or
were recommending a “re - turn to nature” as an escape from the strains,
hypocrisies, and artifices of modern life. He himself was quite
comfortable amid his tribulations, and he thought he ought to say a good
word for civilization. He saw no virtue in poverty, and no harmony
between bugs and love. Primitive men may have been communists, but only
because they had nothing; and if they were so- ber it was only because
they had no wine. “For my part I thank the wise nature that for my
happiness gave me birth in this age so decried by our melancholy
critics. This profane time is just right for my ways. I love lux- ury,
even a soft life 〔mo llesse〕, all the pleasures, the arts in their
variety, cleanliness, taste, and ornaments.” All this seemed to him
clearly preferable to the Garden of Eden. “My dear father Adam, confess
that you and Mad - ame Eve had long nails black with dirt, and that your
hair was a bit out of order. … In vain have scholars sought to locate
the Garden of Eden;</p>
<p>. . . the terrestrial paradise is wh ere I am.”</p>
<p>The ecclesiastics did not like this picture of Adam and Eve; they
insisted that the Book of Genesis was good history, and they did not
agree with Voltaire about Adam’s nails and Eve’s hair. Again the word
went forth for the arrest of the impious devil of Cirey. Again friends
warned him, and he decided to travel. On December 21, 1736, he left
Cirey and Emilie, and made his way to Brussels, disguised as the
merchant Revol. His admirers there laughed at his disguise, and, in his
honor, staged Alzire. Jean Baptiste Rousseau warned the Bruxellois that
Voltaire had come to preach atheism. Voltaire moved on to Leiden, where
crowds collected to see him, and to Amsterdam, where he supervised the
printing of his book on Newton. The Marquise bega n to fear that he
would never return. “Two weeks ago,” she wrote to d’Argental, “I was in
torture if I let two hours pass without seeing him; I wrote to him from
my room to his; now two weeks have gone by, and I don’t know where he is
or what he is doin g. … I am in a terrible state.” 55 At last he
returned (March, 1737), vowing that only his love for her could keep him
in a France that so hounded him.</p>
<p>In May, 1739, the lovers went to Brussels, where Voltaire used his
legal and other wits to defend the Marquise in a suit affecting her
property. Then, with her husband, they went on to Paris, where Voltaire
offered two plays, Mahomet and MSrope, to the Comedie-Fran^aise, and
Madame saw</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>through the press her three- volume Institutions de physique. In
these “les - sons” she played truant from both Voltaire and Newton by
favoring the monadic philosophy of Leibniz. In September they returned
to Cirey, and soon afterward to Brussels for a long stay. Thence, in
September, 1740, Voltaire hurried to Cleves for his first meeting with
Frederick — now king — who refused to include fimilie in his invitation.
In November he traveled 350 painful miles to Berlin, hoping to play
diplomat for Cardinal Fleury; more of this later, fimilie meanwhile went
to Fontainebleau, where she la- bored to secure permission for Voltaire
to reside in Paris; apparently Cirey had become a bore. On November 2 3
she wrote to d’Argental:</p>
<p>I have been cruelly rewarded for all that I have done at
Fontaine-</p>
<p>bleau. I have adjusted the most difficult matters; I have obtained
for M. de Voltaire the right to return to his country openly; I won him
the</p>
<p>good will of the ministry, and paved his way for acceptance by
the</p>
<p>Academies; in a word, I have given him back in three weeks all
that</p>
<p>he has taken pains to lose in six years.</p>
<p>And do you know how he repays such zealous devotion? He informs me
dryly that he has gone to Berlin, knowing perfectly well that he is
piercing my heart, and leaves me in a state of indescribable torture. .
. .</p>
<p>A fever has seized me, and I hope soon to end my life. . . . And
would you believe that the thought that is uppermost in my mind, when I
feel that my grief will kill me, is the terrible sorrow my death would
bring to M. de Voltaire? … I cannot bear the idea that the memory of
me</p>
<p>will one day cause him unhappiness. All those who have loved him</p>
<p>must refrain from reproaching him.</p>
<p>Voltaire tore himself away from Potsdam and royal adulation to rejoin
his mistress. On the way back he sent to Frederick a letter that gives
his side of the matter:</p>
<p>I abandon a great monarch who cultivates and honors an art which</p>
<p>I idolize, and I go to join a person who reads nothing but the
meta-</p>
<p>physics of Christian Wolff 〔the expositor of Leibniz〕. I tear
myself</p>
<p>from the most amiable court in Europe for a lawsuit. I did not
leave</p>
<p>your adorable court to sigh like an idiot at a woman’s knees. But,
Sire, that woman abandoned for me everything for which other women</p>
<p>abandon their friends. There is no sort of obligation which I am
not</p>
<p>under to her. . . . Love is often ridiculous, but pure friendship
has</p>
<p>rights more binding than a king’s commands . 56</p>
<p>He was reunited with fimilie at Brussels, which, because of her
pro-</p>
<p>longed lawsuit, became their second home. In May, 1741, they attended
the premiere of Mahomet at Lille, and received an ovation. They
returned</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>to Brussels elated, but sombered by a growing consciousness that
their idyl was over. Her love was still strong, even if possession was
its soul, but Vol- taire’s fire was escaping through his pen. In July,
1741, he apologized to her for his failing ardor:</p>
<p>Si vous voulez que j’aime encore,</p>
<p>Rendez-moi Page des amours;</p>
<p>Au crepuscule de mes jours</p>
<p>Rejoignez, s’il se pent, Paurore.</p>
<p>On meurt deux fois, je le vois bien:</p>
<p>Cesser d’ aimer et d’etre aimable</p>
<p>C’est une mort insupportable;</p>
<p>Cesser de vivre, ce n’est rien . 57#</p>
<p>In August, 1742, they went to Paris to assist at the presentation of
Ma- homet at the Theatre-Fran§ais. Voltaire sought from Cardinal Fleury
an official permit for the performance; the Cardinal consented. The
Paris pre- miere (August 19) was the literary event of the year;
magistrates, priests, and poets were numerous in the packed audience.
All seemed satisfied ex- cept some of the clergy, who claimed that the
play was “a bloody satire against the Christian reli gion.” Freron,
Desfontaines, and others joined in the complaint; and though the
Cardinal felt that these critics were injuring their own cause, he sent
private advice to Voltaire to withdraw the play. This was done after the
fourth performance before a full house. Voltaire and fimilie returned in
angry frustration to Brussels.</p>
<p>Was Mahomet anti-Christian? Not quite. It was against fanaticism and
bigotry, but it portrayed the Prophet in a hostile light that should
have pleased all Christians innocent of history. Voltaire pictured
Mahomet as a conscious deceiver who foists his new religion upon a
credulous people, uses their faith as a spur to war, and conquers Mecca
by ordering his fanat- ical devotee, Seide, to assassinate the resisting
sheik Zopir. When Seide hesi- tates, Mahomet reproves him in terms that
seemed to some auditors a reflec- tion on the Christian priesthood:</p>
<p>And dost thou pause? Presumptuous youth, ’tis impious</p>
<p>But to deliberate. Far from Mahomet</p>
<p>Be all who for themselves shall dare to judge. . . .</p>
<p>Those who reason are not oft</p>
<p>Prone to believe. Thy part is to obey.</p>
<p>Have I not told thee what the will of Heaven</p>
<p>Determines? . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>“If you wish me still to love, bring me back the age of loves; in
the twilight of my days revive, if it is possible, the dawn. We die
twice, I see it well. To cease to love and be lovable is a death
unbearable; to cease to live is nothing.”</li>

<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>381</p>
<p>Knowest thou holy Abram here</p>
<p>Was born, that here his sacred ashes rest —</p>
<p>He who, obedient to the voice of God,</p>
<p>Stifled the cries of nature, and gave up</p>
<p>His darling child? The same all-powerful Being</p>
<p>Requires of thee a sacrifice; to thee</p>

<p>Strike, then, and by the blood</p>

<p>Seide kills the old man, who, dying, recognizes him as his own son.
This, of course, was an attack upon the use of religion to sanction
murder and fo- ment war. Voltaire meant it so, and in a letter to
Frederick he gave, as ex- amples of pious crimes, the assassination of
William of Orange and of Henry III and Henry IV of France. But he denied
that the play was an at- tack upon religion; it was a plea to make
Christianity Christian.</p>
<p>Cardinal Fleury consoled him by commissioning him (September, 1742)
to try his hand at turning the policy of Frederick to friendship
with</p>
<p>France. Voltaire, proud to be a diplomat, visited the King at Aachen;
Frederick saw through his purposes, and answered his politics with
poetry. Voltaire returned to Paris, Lmilie, and the drama. On February
20, 1743, his greataest play, Merope, was produced by the
Comedie-Fran§aise with a success that for a while silenced his
enemies.</p>
<p>Several plays had already been written on the theme; Euripides had
used it in a drama of which only fragments remain. In a preliminary
letter Vol- taire acknowledged his special indebtedness to Marchese
Francesco Sci- pione di Maffei of Verona, who had produced a Merope in
1713. It was a distinction of these plays that their interest turned on
parental rather than sexual love. At the final curtain, we are told,
most of the audience was in tears. For the first time in the history of
the French theater there were calls for the author to show himself on
the stage. According to the accepted ac- count he complied, creating a
precedent which Lessing deplored; according to other sources Voltaire
refused to go on the stage, though urged to do so by the two duchesses
in whose box he sat; he merely stood up for a moment and acknowledged
the applause. 59 Frederick gave it as his judgment that Merope was “one
of the finest tragedies ever written.” 80 Gibbon thought the final act
equal to anything in Racine. 61</p>
<p>The success of Merope was alloyed for Voltaire by the failure,
soon</p>
<p>afterward, of his candidacy for a seat in the Academy. He campaigned
for it eagerly, even to proclaiming himself “a true Catholic” and the
author of “many pages sanctified by religion.” 62 Louis XV at first
favored him, but was deterred by his new minister Maurepas, who
protested that it would</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>be unseemly to let so profane a spirit succeed to the seat vacated by
the death of Cardinal Fleury. The seat was given to the bishop of
Mirepoix. Frederick urged Voltaire to abandon a country that so little
honored its geniuses, and come and live with him in Potsdam. Mme. du
Chatelet ob- jected. The French government advised him to accept the
invitation for a time, and to serve as its secret agent in Berlin.
Longing to play politics, Vol- taire agreed, and undertook again the
racking ride across France, Belgium, and Germany. He spent six weeks
(August 30 to October 12, 1743) in the enterprise. Frederick again
laughed at his politics and praised his poetry. Voltaire returned to
fimilie at Brussels. In April, 1744, they resumed their residence at
Cirey, and tried to revive their dying love.</p>
<p>In her Traite de la bonheur the Marquise thought that “of all the
passions the desire for knowledge is the one which contributes most to
happiness, for it is the one which make s us least dependent upon each
other.” Never - theless she called love</p>
<p>the greatest of the good things that are within our grasp, the only
one to which even the pleasure of study should be sacrificed. The
ideal</p>
<p>would be two individuals who would be so attracted to each other</p>
<p>that their passions would never cool or become surfeited. But one
can- not hope for such harmony of two persons; it would be too
perfect.</p>
<p>A heart which would be capable of such love, a soul which would be so
steadfast and so affectionate, is perhaps bom once in a century. 63</p>
<p>In a touching letter she summed up her surrender of this hope:</p>
<p>I was happy for ten years in the love of the one who had conquered my
soul, and those ten years I spent in perfect communion with</p>
<p>him. . . . When age and illness had reduced his affection, a long
time passed before I noticed it; I loved for two; I spent my whole life
with him, and my trusting heart enjoyed the ecstasy of love, and the
illusion of believing itself to be loved. … I have lost this happy
state. 64</p>
<p>What was it that had turned Voltaire from love to a kind of
intermittent fidelity? He seems to have been sincere in pleading the
decline of his phys- ical powers; yet we shall find him, within a year,
“sighing like an i diot at a woman’s knees.” The truth was that he had
exhausted one phase of his life and interest — Mme. de Chatelet and
science. The isolation of Cirey would have palled much sooner on an
average mind; it was a blessing only when the police pursued him and
science called. But now he had tasted again the pleasures of Paris arid
premieres; he was even playing a part in national pol- itics. If only
from a distance he felt the glamour of the court. His friend the Marquis
d’Argenson had become chief minist er, his friend and debtor the</p>

<p>Due de Richelieu was first chamberlain to the King, and Louis himself
had relented. In 1745 the Dauphin was to marry the Infanta Maria Teresa
Ra- faela; a lordly festival must be prepared; Richelieu commissioned
Voltaire to write a play for the occasion. But Rameau was to write the
music; poet and composer had to work together; Voltaire must come to
Paris. In Sep- tember, 1 744, the lovers bade goodbye to Cirey and moved
to the capital.</p>

<p>He was now fifty years old. He had for a long time been dying
annually; “it is most certain,” he wrote to Thieriot in 1735, “that I
have but a few years to live.” 65 He had then li ved forty-one years; he
was to live forty- three more. How did he manage this? When he fell
seriously ill at Chalons- sur- Marne in 1748, and a physician prescribed
some drugs, Voltaire “told me,” his secretary reported, “that he would
follow none of the se directions, for he knew how to manage himself as
well in sickness as in health, and he would continue to be his own
doctor, as he had always been.” In such crises he fasted for a while,
then ate a little broth, toast, weak tea, barley and water. Secretary
Longchamp adds:</p>
<p>Thus it was that M. de Voltaire cured himself of a malady which</p>
<p>probably would have had grave consequences if he had delivered him-
self up to the Aesculapius of Chalons. His principle was that our health
depends upon ourselves; that its three pivots are sobriety, temperance
in all things, and moderate exercise; that in almost all diseases which
are not the result of serious accidents, or of radical vitiation of the
internal organs, it suffices to aid nature, which is endeavoring to
restore us; that it is necessary to confine ourselves to a diet more or
less strict and pro- longed, suitable liquid nourishment, and other
simple means. In this manner I always saw him regulate his conduct as
long as I lived with him. 66</p>
<p>He was as skilled as a banker in the management and investment of his
funds. He was an importer, a poet, a contractor, a dramatist, a
capitalist, a philosopher, a moneylender, pensioner, and heir. His frien
d d’Argenson helped him to make a fortune in military supplies. 67 He
had inherited part of his father’s wealth; in 1 745 the death of his
brother Armand left to him the income of the remainder. He made large
loans to the Due de Richelieu, the Due de Villars, the Prince de Guise,
and others. He had much trouble recapturing the principal, but he
compensated himself with interest. 68 In 1735 Richelieu owed him 46,417
livres, on which the Duke paid four thou- sand livres per year. 69 In
the case of the unreliable M. de Breze, Voltaire</p>
<p>3»4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>asked ten per cent. Much of his money he invested in bonds of the
city of Paris at five or six per cent. He had often to instruct his
agent to dun his debtors: “It is necessary, my friend, to ask, to ask
again, to press, to see, to importune — but not to persecute — my
debtors for my annuities and ar- rears.” 70 His secretary calculated in
1749 that Voltaire’s income was eighty thousand livres per year. 71 He
was not a moneygrubber or a miser. He re- peatedly gave money or other
assistance to young students, and lent a help- ing hand or voice to
Vauvenargues, Marmontel, La Harpe; we have seen him surrendering to the
actors the proceeds of his plays. When he lost forty thousand livres
through the bankruptcy of a farmer general to whom he had lent that sum,
he took it calmly, using the wise words taught him in his youth: “The
Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the
Lord.”</p>
<p>If he had had less money to take care of, and more flesh on his
bones, he might have been less sensitive, nervous, and irritable. He was
generous and considerate, usually cheerful, good-humored, vivacious; he
was capable of warm and steadfast friendship, and quick to forgive an
injury that did not hurt his pride; but he could not with patience bear
criticism or hostility (“I envy the beasts two things,” he said: “their
ignorance of evils to come, and their ignorance of what is said of them”
72 ). His sha rp wit aroused many enemies. Freron, Piron, Desfontaines
attacked him or his ideas with a vio- lence far greater than came from
the clergy; we shall listen to them by and by. Voltaire returned blow
for blow, despite Mme. du Chatelet’s counsel to be silent. He called
them hot names, marshaled his friends to war against them; the Marquise
was hard put to it to keep him from rushing to Paris to whip or
challenge Desfontaines; he even thought of invoking the censorship to
suppress the more virulent of his foes. He had all the defects of his
quali- ties, and a few more.</p>
<p>He found in Rameau a man as proud and irritable as himself; their co-
operation was a trial for both; but at last the libretto and the music
were complete, the players and musicians were rehearsed; La Princesse de
Na- varre went off well (February 23, 1745). A month later Voltaire was
given a room in the palace, near what he described in his very private
correspond- ence as “the most stinking merde - t in Versailles.” The
Marquise du Chatelet resumed at court the place that she had sacrificed
for Voltaire; she had now the dizzy privilege of sitting in the presence
of the Queen. The rise of Mme. de Pompadour favored Voltaire; he had
known her when she was Mme. d’fitioles, had visited her home, had
written trivia in her praise. At her urging the King appointed him
(April 1 ) royal historiographer, with a salary of two thousand livres
per year.</p>
<p>He was soon required to earn his fee. On May 1 1, 1745, the French
de-</p>

<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>feated the English at Fontenoy; d’Argenson asked for a
commemorative</p>
<p>Drunk with a mixture of fame and royalty, Voltaire began another cam-
paign for admission to the Academy. He left no stone unturned. On Au-
gust 17, 1745, he sent a copy of Mahomet to Benedict XIV, asking might
he dedicate it to him. The amiable Pope replied (September 19) :</p>
<p>This day sevennight I was favored with your excellent tragedy of</p>
<p>Mahomet, which I have read with great pleasure. … I have the high-
est esteem for your merit, which is so universally acknowledged. . .
.</p>
<p>I have the highest opinion of your honor and sincerity.</p>
<p>I . . . here give you my apostolical benediction. 73</p>
<p>Voltaire was so delighted with this accolade that he wrote to the
Pope a let- ter of fervent appreciation, en ding: “With the utmost
respect and grati - tude I kiss your sacred feet.” 74 He proclaimed to
Paris his attachment to the Catholic faith and his admiration for the
Jesuits. He multiplied his praises of Pompadour and the King. Pompadour
pleaded for him, the King con- sented, and at last, May 9, 1746, the
Academy admitted the leading poet and dramatist of the age. To make his
cup run over, he was appointed (De- cember 22) gentilhomme ordinaire de
la chambre — “gentleman in ordinary of the chamber,” privileged to wait
upon the King.</p>
<p>Probably it was in these days of success and satisfaction that he
com- posed his tale Babonc, ou le Monde comme il va. Babouc, a gentleman
of Scythia, sets out to see the world, and especially how things are in
Persia (i.e., France). He is shocked by the wars, the political
corruption, the pur- chase of offices, the farming of taxes, and the
wealth of the “Magi” (the -</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>tion. As for himself, however, he will imitate the “truly wise,” who
“live among themselves in retirement and tranquillity.” 75 Was Voltaire
already lonesome for Cirey?</p>
<p>In any case he was not fashioned for a courtier. With incredible
tactless- ness he celebrated the success of the French at Bergen op Zoom
with a poem in which he spoke of Louis as flying from the victory to the
arms of Pompadour, and charged both of them to keep what they had
conquered. The Queen was outraged; so were her children; half the court
denounced the poet’s impudence. Meanwhile Mme. du Chatelet had relapsed
into gambling; in one evening she lost 84,000 francs. Voltaire, on her
shoulder, warned her in English that she was playing with cheats; some
of the play- ers understood and protested. News of this scandalous
candor ran through the court, leaving the poet scarcely a friend in
Versailles or Fontainebleau. Voltaire and Emilie fled to Sceaux (1747)
and the still surviving Duchesse du Maine. There he remained for two
months in a remote apartment hid- den from public view. And there he
tried to forget his plight by writing some of those delightful contes or
romans which helped to make him the most popular author in all the
literature of France. Apparently he read them, of an evening, to the
intimate guests who constituted the Duchess’s private court. Hence their
brevity, their gay satire and bubbling wit.</p>
<p>The longest of these stories written in the years 1746-50 was Z adig,
or The Mystery of Fate. Zadig is an amiable, rich, well-educated young
Baby- lonian, “as wise as it is possible for a man to be. . . .
Instructed in the sci - ences of the ancient Chaldeans, he understood
the principles of natural philosophy, . . . and knew as much of
metaphysics as has ever been</p>
<p>known in any age, that is, little or nothing at all.” 76 He is about
to marry the lovely Semina when he is attacked by brigands, and suffers
a wound that develops into an abscess in the left eye. The famous
physician Hermes is brought in from Memphis: he examines the wound, and
announces that Zadig will lose the eye. “Had it been the right eye, I
could easily have cured it, but the wounds of the left eye are
incurable.” Semina, declari ng that she has an unconquerable aversion to
one-eyed men, abandons Zadig and mar- ries his rival. In two days the
abscess breaks of its own accord; soon the eye is completely cured;
Hermes writes a book to prove that this is impossible. Zadig pleases
King Moabdar with his wise counsels, and Queen Astarte with his good
looks; she falls in love with him; he flees to a distant city. On the
way he sees a man beating a woman; he responds bravely to her cries for
help; he interferes, is murderously assailed, and slays the man; the
woman rails at him for having killed her lover. Zadig proceeds, and is
sold into slavery. . . . Zadig “then imagined men as in fact they are,
insects devouring one another on a drop of mud.”</p>
<p>Memnon the Philosopher told the s tory of a man who “one day con
-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>387</p>
<p>ceived the insane idea of becoming wholly reasonable.” He finds
himself in a hopeless and besieged minority, encounters a hundred
calamities, and decides that the earth is an insane asylum to which the
other planets deport their lunatics. 77</p>
<p>The Travels of Scarmentado takes a young Cretan to country after
coun- try, opening up ever new vistas of fanaticism, chicanery, cruelty,
or igno- rance. In France the provinces are devastated by religious
wars; in England Queen Mary burns five hundred Protestants, in Spain the
people sniff with relish the odor of roasted heretics. In Turkey
Scarmentado narrowly es- capes circumcision; in Persia he gets involved
in the conflict between the Sunna and Shi‘a sects of Islam; in China he
is denounced by the Jesuits as a distinguished Dominican. At last he
returns to Crete. “As I had now seen all that was rare, good, or
beautiful on earth, I resolved for the future to see nothing but my own
home. I took a wife, and soon suspected that she deceived me; but
notwithstanding this doubt, I still found that of all condi- tions of
life this was much the happiest.” 78</p>
<p>Micr omegas developed the ideas of relativity exploited by Swift in
The Travels of Lemuel Gulliver. “Mr. Micromegas,” as befitted an
inhabitant of the great star Sirius, is “120,000 royal feet” tall, and
fifty thousand around the waist; his nose is 6,333 f eet l° n g from
stem to stern. In his 670th year he travels to polish his education.
Roaming about space, he alights upon the planet Saturn; he laughs at the
pygmy stature — only six thousand feet or so — of its people, and
wonders how these underprivileged Saturnians, with only seventy- two
senses, can ever know reality. “To what age do you commonly live?” he
asks an inhabitant. “Alas,” cries the Saturnian, “few, very few on this
globe outlive five hundred revolutions around the sun 〔these, according
to our way of reckoning, amount to about fifteen thou- sand years〕. So,
you see, we in a manner begin to die the very moment we are bom. . . .
Scarce do we learn a little when death intervenes before we can profit
by experience.” 79 The Sirian invites the Saturnian to j oin him in
visiting other stars. They stumble upon the planet Earth; the Sirian
wets his feet, the Saturnian is nearly drowned, as they walk through the
Medi- terranean. Reaching soil, they see masses of the tiny inhabitants
moving about in great excitement. When the Sirian discovers that a
hundred thou- sand of these earthlings, covered with hats, are slaying
or being slain by an equal number covered with turbans, in a dispute
〔the Crusades〕 over “a pitiful molehill 〔Palestine〕 no longer than
his he el,” he cries out indig - nantly, “Miscreants! … I have a good
mind to take two or three steps and trample the whole nest of such
ridiculous assassins under my feet.” 80</p>
<p>All this was general and genial, and might have passed without a
stir. But in 1748 Voltaire troubled the winds of Paris with a little
pamphlet called The Voice of the Sage and the People, which attacked the
French Church</p>
<p>388</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>at a very sensitive point — its property. “In France, where reason
becomes more developed every day, reason teaches us that the Church
ought to con- tribute to the expenses of the nation in proportion to its
revenues, and that the body set apart to teach justice ought to begin by
being an example of it.” He claimed that monasteries were wasting the
seed of men and the resources of the land in vain idleness. He accused
“superstition” of assassi - nating rulers and shedding streams of blood
in persecution and war, and re- minded sovereigns that no philosopher
had ever raised his hand against his king. If kings would unite with
reason and divorce themselves from super- stition, how much happier the
world would be! 81 Rarely has so short an essay roused so long a storm.
Fifteen counter- Voices were published to answer the anonymous
“Sage.”</p>
<p>During Voltaire’s hibernation at Sceaux, Mme. du Chatelet paid her
gam - bling debts and quieted the resentment of the winners at
Voltaire’s descrip - tion of them. She brought him back to Paris, where
he supervised the pub- lication of his novelettes. Uncomfortable
nevertheless, he thought it wise to accept the invitation of Stanislas
Leszczynski to visit his court at Lune- ville — some eighteen miles from
Nancy, the capital of Lorraine. After a la- borious journey the tired
lovers reached Luneville (1748); but a fortnight later a letter from
d’Argental informed Voltaire that the actors of the Comedie-Fran§aise
were ready to go into rehearsal of his play Semiramis, and needed him to
coach them in the interpretation of his lines. This play meant much to
him. Pompadour, in the goodness of her sinful soul, had brought the
impoverished Crebillon pere back to the stage, and had given a lead to
the applause; Marivaux had dared to rank the old man’s dramas above
Voltaire’s; the thin -skinned poet had resolved to prove his superiority
by writing plays on the same themes that Crebillon had used. So he
hurried back to Paris, leaving fimilie in perilous freedom at Luneville,
and on Au- gust 29, 1748, Semiramis had a successful premiere. After the
second per- formance he hastened in disguise to the Cafe Procope and
listened to the comments of those who had seen his play. There were some
favorable judg- ments, which he accepted as his due, and some
unfavorable, which pained him all the more because he had to bear them
in silence. He profited from the criticisms to revise the play; it had a
good run; and now it ranks among his best.</p>
<p>He hastened back through September storms halfway across France to
Luneville, nearly dying en route at Chalons. When Frederick urged him to
continue on to Potsdam he excused himself on the ground that his ill-
nesses had made him lose half his hearing and several teeth, so that he
would be merely carrying a corpse to Berlin. Frederick replied: “Come
without teeth, without ears, if you cannot come otherwise, so long as
that inde-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE 389</p>
<p>finable something which makes you think, and inspires you so
beautifully, comes with you.” 82 Voltaire chose to stay with Lmilie.</p>
<p>V. LIEBESTOD</p>
<p>Good “King” Stanislas loved literature, had read Voltaire, was
infected with Enlightenment. In 1749 he would publish his own manifesto,
The Christian Philosopher, which his daughter the Queen of France would
read with sad displeasure. She warned him that his ideas smelled
strongly of Voltaire’s; but the old man relished the ideas as well as
the wit of Voltaire;</p>
<p>Another officer of Stanislas’ court was Marquis Jean Francois de
Saint- Lambert, captain of the guards. Mme. du Chatelet had first met
him in 1747, when he was thirty-one and she forty-one; it was a
dangerous age for a woman whose lover had become only a devoted friend.
By the spring of 1 748 she was writing to the handsome officer love
letters of almost girlish abandon. “Come to me as soon as you are
dressed.” “I shall fly to you as soon as I have supped.” Saint -Lambert
responded gallantly. Sometime in October Voltaire surprised them in a
dark alcove conversing amorously. Only the greatest philosopher can
accept cuckoldom graciously. Voltaire did not at once rise to the
occasion; he reproached them volubly, but re- tired to his room when
Saint- Lambert offered to give him “satisfaction”— i.e., to kill him at
dawn. Lmilie came to Voltaire at two o’clock in the</p>
<p>morning. She assured him of her eternal love, but gently reminded him
that “for a long time you have complained . . . that your strength
abandons you. . . . Ought you to be offended that it is one of your
friends who sup- plies your place?” She embraced him, called him the old
pet names. His anger melted. “Ah, madame,” he said, “you are always
right. But since things must be as they are, at least let them not pass
before my eyes.” The next evening Saint-Lambert called upon Voltaire and
apologized for his challenge. Voltaire embraced him. “My child,” he told
him, “I have for - gotten all. It was I who was in the wrong. You are in
the happy age of love and delight; enjoy those moments, too brief. An
old invalid like me is not made for these pleasures.” The next night all
three supped together. 83 This menage a trois continued until December,
when Madame decided she must go to Cirey to arrange her finances.
Voltaire accompanied her. Frederick renewed his invitation; Voltaire was
now inclined to accept it.</p>

<p>But soon after her arrival at Cirey the Marquise confided to him that
she was pregnant, and that, at her age, now forty-three, she did not
expect to survive childbirth. Voltaire sent word to Frederick not to
expect him, and asked Saint-Lambert to come to Cirey. There the three
lovers devised a plan to secure the legality of the child. Madame urged
her husband to come home to accelerate some business. He was not
disturbed to find two lovers supplementing him; he enjoyed the
hospitality they gave him. The Mar- quise put on all her charms of dress
and caress. He drank, and consented to make love. Some weeks later she
told him that she had indications of pregnancy. He embraced her with
pride and joy; he proclaimed the ex- pected event to all and sundry, and
everyone offered him congratulations; but Voltaire and Saint- Lambert
agreed to “class the child among Mme. du Chatelet’s miscellaneous works
〔oeuvres melees 〕.” 8 ’ 1 The Marquis and Saint - Lambert returned to
their posts.</p>
<p>In February, 1749, Emilie and Voltaire moved to Paris. There she</p>
<p>worked on her translation of the Principia, aided by Clairaut. Two
letters to Saint-Lambert (May 18 and 20) reveal her character:</p>
<p>No, it is not possible for my heart to express to you how it
adores</p>
<p>you. Do not reproach me for my Newton; I am sufficiently punished for
it. Never have I made a greater sacrifice to reason than in remain- ing
here to finish it. … I get up at nine, sometimes at eight; I work</p>
<p>till three; then I take my coffee; I resume work at four; at ten I
stop</p>
<p>I talk till midnight with M. de Voltaire, who comes to supper with
me; at midnight I go to work again, and continue till five in the
morn-</p>
<p>ing. … I finish the book for reason and honor, but I love only you .
85</p>
<p>On June 10 Frederick, thinking Voltaire freed by Saint-Lambert from
further responsibility for Mme. du Chatelet, urgently renewed his
invita- tion to Potsdam. Voltaire replied: “Not even Frederick the Great
. . . can prevent me from carrying out a duty from which nothing can
dispense me. … I will not leave a woman who may die in September. Her
lying-in has every likelihood of being very dangerous; but if she
escapes I promise you, Sire, that I will come and pay my court in
October.” 86</p>
<p>In July he took her to Luneville, where she could have proper medical
attendance. The fear of death troubled her — to be taken off just when
she had found love again, just when her years of study were to be
crowned with the publication of her book. On September 4 she gave birth
to a daughter. On September 10, after much suffering, she died.
Voltaire, over- come with grief, stumbled out of her room, fell, and
remained unconscious for some time. Saint- Lambert helped to revive him.
“Ah, my friend,” said Voltaire, “it is you who have killed her. . . .
Oh, my God, monsieur,</p>

<p>VOLTAIRE IN FRANCE</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>what could have induced you to get her into that condition?” Three
days later he asked Longchamp for the ring that had been removed from
the dead woman’s hand. It had once held his own portrait; Longchamp
found in it Saint- Lambert’s. “Such are women,” exclaimed Voltaire. “I
took</p>
<p>Richelieu out of that ring. Saint-Lambert expelled me. That is the
order of nature; one nail drives out another. S o go the affairs of this
world.” 87 Madame was buried at Luneville with the highest honors of
Stanislas’ court, and was soon followed by her child.</p>
<p>Voltaire and the Marquis retired to Cirey. Thence Voltaire replied to
some letters of condolence from Paris:</p>
<p>You make my consolation, my dear angels; you make me love the</p>
<p>unhappy remainder of my life. … I will confess to you that a
house</p>
<p>which she inhabited, although overwhelming me with grief, is not dis-
agreeable to me. … I do not fly from that which speaks to me of her.</p>
<p>I love Cirey; . . . the places which she embellished are dear to me.
I</p>
<p>have not lost a mistress, I have lost half of myself, a soul for
whom</p>
<p>mine was made, a friend of twenty years, whom I knew in her
infancy.</p>
<p>The most tender father loves not otherwise his only daughter. I love
to find again everywhere the idea of her. I love to talk with her hus-
band, with her son. 88</p>
<p>And yet he knew that he would waste away if he remained a widower in
isolated Cirey. He sent his books, scientific apparatus, and art
collection to Paris, and followed them on September 25, 1749. On October
12 he established himself in the capital, in a spacious mansion in the
Rue Traver- siere.</p>

<p>He easily persuaded his niece to come and play hostess for him, since
she had for some time been his paramour.</p>
<p>Born (1712) Marie Louise Mignot, she was the daughter of Voltaire’s
sister Catherine. When Catherine died (1726), Voltaire assumed the pro-
tection of her children. In 1738, aged twenty-six but graced with a
hand- some dowry from her uncle, Marie Louise married Captain Nicolas
Charles Denis, a minor official in the government. Six years later Denis
died, just about the time that Voltaire and the Marquise removed to
Paris. The widow sought comfort in Voltaire’s arms, and he found new
warmth in hers. Apparently his avuncular affection was soon transformed
into some- thing quite uncanonical. In a letter of March 23, 1745, he
addressed his</p>
<p>39 2 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>niece as “my beloved.” 89 * This could have been a term of innocent
affec - tion, but in December, two years before the Marquise met
Saint-Lambert, Voltaire sent to the merry widow a letter which must be
quoted verbatim to be believed:</p>
<p>Vi baccio mille volte. La mia anima baccia la vostra, mio cazzo,
mio</p>
<p>cuore sono innamorati di voi. Baccio il vostro gentil culo e tutta
la</p>
<p>vostra persona . 90 t</p>
<p>Mme. Denis modestly crossed out some of these words, but presumably
she responded amorously, for Voltaire wrote to her from Versailles on
Decem- ber 27, 1745:</p>
<p>My dear one, . . . you tell me that my letter gave pleasure even
to</p>
<p>your senses. Mine are like yours; I could not read the delicious
words you wrote without feeling inflamed to the depths of my being. I
paid your letter the tribute I should like to pay to the whole of your
per-</p>
<p>son. … I will love you until death. 92</p>
<p>In three letters of 174 6: “I count on kissing my beloved a thousand
times.” 93 “I should like to live at your feet and die in your arms.” 94
“When shall I be able to live with you, forgotten by the whole world?”
95 And on July 27, 1748:</p>
<p>Je ne viendrais que pour vous e se il povero stato della mia
salute</p>
<p>me lo permesse mi gitturai alle vostre genochia e baccarei tutte la
vostra Belta. In tanto io figo mille baccii alle tonde poppe y alle
transportatrici natiche , a tutta la vostra persona che m’ha fatto tante
volte rizzare e m’ha annegato in un flume di delizie. 9e t</p>
<p>There is a dangerous age in men as well as in women; it lasts longer,
and commits incredible follies. Voltaire was the most brilliant man of
his cen-</p>

<li>This and the subsequent excerpts are taken from manuscript letters
discovered by Theo- dore Besterman in 1957, and purchased by the
Pierpont Morgan Library of New York from the descendants of Mme. Denis.
Dr. Besterman, director of the Institut et Musee Voltaire at Les
Delices, Geneva, published the text with a French translation as Lettres
d? amour de Voltaire a sa niece (Paris, 1957), and with an English
translation as The Love Letters of Vol - taire to His Niece (London,
1958). All but four of the 1 42 letters are in Voltaire’s hand. Some of
them are in Italian, which Mme. Denis could understand. The letters
range from 1742 to 1750, but only three are definitely dated, so that
their exact chronology is not certain. The dates given in our text are
those assigned by Dr. Besterman.</li>

<p>t “I kiss you a thousand times. My soul kisses yours; my cazzo y my
heart are enamored of you. I kiss your pretty bottom and all your
person.” 91</p>
<p>t Translation by Dr. Besterman: “I shall be coming 〔to Paris〕 only
for yo u, and if my miserable condition permits, I will throw myself at
your knees and kiss all your beauties. In the meantime I press a
thousand kisses on your round breasts, on your ravishing bottom, on all
your person, which has so often given me erections and plunged me into a
flood of delight.” 97</p>

<p>tury, but we should not rank him among the wise. A hundred times he
fell into such foolishness, indiscretions, extremes, and childish
tantrums as re- joiced his enemies and grieved his friends. Now,
forgetting that verba volant but scripta manent, he put himself at the
mercy of a niece who ap- parently was fond of him, but who loved his
money with an expansive embrace; we shall find her using her power over
him, and aggrandizing her fortune, to the day of his death. She was not
a bad woman in terms of the time. But perhaps she went beyond the code
of her age in taking a suc- cession of lovers — Baculard d’Arnaud,
Marmontel, the Marquis de Ximenes —to second her uncle’s attentions. 98
Marmontel described her favorably in 1 747 : “That lady was agreeable
with all her ugliness; and her easy and un - affected character had
imbibed a tincture of that of her uncle. She had much of his taste, his
gaiety, his exquisite politeness; so that her society was liked and
courted.” 99</p>
<p>On the day of Mme. du Chatelet’s death Voltaire wrote to his
niece:</p>
<p>My dear child, I have just lost a friend of twenty years. For a
long</p>
<p>time now, you know, I have not looked upon Madame du Chastellet
〔sic〕 as a woman, and I am sure that you will enter into my cruel
grief.</p>
<p>It is frightful to have seen her die in such circumstances and for
such a reason. I am not leaving Monsieur du Chastellet in our mutual
sor- row. . . . From Cirey I shall come to Paris to embrace you, and
to</p>
<p>seek in you my one consolation, the only hope of my life . 100</p>
<p>During the eight months that he now spent in the capital he received
new urgings from Frederick, and he was in a mood to accept. Frederick
offered him the post of chamberlain, free lodgings, and a salary of
5,000 thalers. 101 Voltaire, who was a financier as well as a
philosopher, asked the Prussian King to advance him, as a loan,
sufficient funds to defray the cost of the journey. Frederick complied,
but with sly reproof likened the poet to Horace, who thought it wise to
“mix the useful with the agreeable.” 102 Voltaire asked permission from
the French King for his departure; Louis readily agreed, saying to his
intimates, “This will make one madman the more at the court of Prussia,
and one less at Versailles.” 103</p>
<p>On June 10, 1750, Voltaire left Paris for Berlin.</p>
