<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>The Fallow South</p>
<p>1648-1715</p>
<p>I. CATHOLIC ITALY</p>
<p>I T IS part of the wordless wisdom of the peasant that soil nearing
ex- haustion from abundant bearing may be restored by letting it lie
fallow for a season, plowed, perhaps, but not sown. Italy, after the
consuming fertility of the Renaissance, rested. Her incredible vitality
subsided to a quieter pace, as if gathering strength for new
achievements to come. So we must not expect from the Italy of this and
the succeeding age — between Bernini and Bonaparte — such fruits as
poured from her horn of plenty in her golden centuries. We visit her
again, satisfied if now and then, in cities echoing with history, we can
hear minor voices attesting un-</p>
<p>extinguished life.</p>
<p>She was, of course, still Catholic; this is part of her soul, and
could</p>
<p>hardly be taken from her without violating her spirit. The poor were
abused by the rich, who naturally controlled the governments and made
the laws. The rich explained that if the poor were better paid they
would become disorderly and insolent. The women, except in the flowering
of their beauty, were exploited by the men and the race. Under these
con- ditions the lower classes and the then weaker sex found solace in
the ministrations of the Church. Their faith in the divine justice
upheld them against the inhumanity of man; the sins of their hot tongues
and pagan flesh were readily pardoned by the lenient priests and amiable
monks whom they fed so hopefully; their burdened days were gratefully
interrupted by the lazy festivals of their protective saints. Those
saints and the com- passionate Virgin Mother, by intercession at the
throne of God, would save them from the horrors of hell; the indulgences
distributed by the Church would shorten their stay in purgatory; sooner
or later they would be admitted to a Paradise — even more beautiful than
Italy — where there would be no landlords, no taxes, no tithes, no toil,
no war, no grief, and no pain.</p>
<p>So they bore with patience, humor, and song the exactions of
their</p>
<p>omnipresent clergy, who absorbed at least a third of the nation’s r
evenues. They loved their churches as isles of peace in the war of life.
They saw with pride, not resentment, the splendor of St. Peter’s and the
Vatican; these were the product of their pennies and their artisans;
they belonged to the</p>
<p>428</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>429</p>
<p>poor even more than to the rich; and they were not too grand for the
tomb of the first Apostle, or for the home of the head of Christendom,
the Servant of the Servants of God. If that Holy Father punished attacks
upon the Church, it was only to prevent fools from destroying the moral
edifice built upon religious belief, only to preserve the faith that
made a heroic poem from the prose of toil.</p>
<p>The Italian Inquisition was relatively human in this age. Its most
famous victim was a Spanish priest, Miguel de Molinos, born in
Saragossa, domiciled in Rome. In 1675 he published a Guida spirituale,
which argued that though devotion to Jesus and the Church was a help
toward the highest religious state, yet the worshiper who had given
himself to direct communion with God might safely ignore all priestly
intermediation and all churchly ritual. In a further tract Molinos
opined that a devotee confident in his freedom from mortal sin might
rightly receive the Eucharist without previously confessing to a priest.
Molinos’ Guide proved especially attractive to women; hundreds of them —
including Princess Borghese and Queen Chris- tina — sought his counsel
and sent him gifts. Many nuns took to the new quietism, discarded their
rosaries, and wrapt themselves in a proud liaison with God. Several
Italian bishops, complaining of a movement that mini- mized church
services and contributions, appealed to Innocent XI to sup- press it. 1
Jesuits and Franciscans attacked Molinos as putting an almost Protestant
emphasis upon faith above “works.” The Pope for a time pro - tected him,
but in 1685 the Roman Inquisition arrested him, and soon there- after
almost a hundred of his followers. He had amassed four thousand gold
crowns (0,000?) by levying a small charge for his epistolary advice; we
may judge the number of correspondents from the cost, twenty-three
ducats (87.50?), of the postage on letters received by him on the single
day of his arrest. 2</p>
<p>After examining the prisoners the Inquisition drew up a series of
accusa- tions: chiefly that Molinos had justified the breaking of
crucifixes and religious images as impeding the quiet of union with God;
that he had discouraged persons from taking religious vows or entering
religious orders; and that he had led his disciples to believe that
nothing done by them after attaining divine union could be a sin.
Perhaps under stress of imprison- ment, torture, or fear, he confessed
to excusing the destruction of images, and to dissuading from monastic
vows persons whom he thought unfit; he admitted that for many years he
had practiced “the most indecent acts with two women”; he “had not
deemed this sinful, but a purification of the soul”; and thereby “he
enjoyed a closer union with God.” 3 The Inquisition con - demned sixty-
eight propositions found in Molinos’ books, letters, or con - fessions,
and on September 3, 1687, it indicted him in a public auto-da-fe. A
great crowd attended, and demanded that he be burned; but the
Inquisi-</p>
<p>43 ° TH E AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>tion contented itself with ordering his confinement for life. He died
in prison in 1697.</p>
<p>Our sympathies may go more readily to those Alpine “heretics” whom
Milton mourned in his son net “On the Late Massacher in Piedmont.” In
the valleys hiding between Savoyard Piedmont and French Dauphine dwelt
the Vaudois, descendants of the Waldenses who had preceded and survived
the Reformation, and who had preserved their Protestant faith through a
hundred fluctuations of law and government. In 1655 Duke Charles</p>
<p>Emmanuel II of Savoy joined Louis XIV in organizing an army to force
the conversion of these Vaudois. The resultant slaughter aroused the in-
dignation of Cromwell, who secured from Mazarin an order ending</p>
<p>the persecution. But after the deaths of the Protector and the
Cardinal the oppression was renewed, and when the Edict of Nantes was
revoked the French state resumed its effort to exterminate Protestantism
from the prov- ince. The Vaudois laid down their arms on a promise of
amnesty;</p>
<p>then, unarmed, three thousand of them, including women, children, and
old men, were massacred (1686). The still unconverted survivors were
allowed to migrate to the environs of Geneva. A later Duke of Savoy,
Victor Amadeus, finding himself, in the kaleidoscope of politics, allied
not with France but against her, invited the Vaudois to return to their
valleys (1696). They came, fought in his service, and thereafter were
allowed to worship the Unknown in their own trusting way.</p>
<p>The poor were as poor in the Papal States as elsewhere in Italy. The
Curia, or papal court, like any government, taxed its subjects to the
point of diminishing returns, and never had funds enough for its
purposes and personnel. Cardinal Sacchetti warned Pope Alexander VII
(1663) that the tax collectors were impoverishing the population to the
verge of despair. “The people, having no more silver or copper or linen
or furniture to satisfy the rapacity of the commissioners, will be next
obliged to sell themselves to meet the burdens laid upon them by the
Camera” (the legislative chamber of the Curia) .* The Cardinal
complained of venality in the papal judiciary, of verdicts bought and
sold, of suits prolonged for years, of violence and tyranny experienced
by losers who dared to appeal from a lower to a higher official. These
“oppressions,” said Sacchetti, “exceed those inflicted upon the
Israelites in Egypt. People not conquered by the sword, but subjected to
the Holy See, … are more inhumanly treated than the slaves in Syria or
Africa. Who can witness these things without tears of sorrow?” 5 Amid
the poverty of the masses several noble families related</p>
<p>The popes of this period were neither ascetics like Pius V nor
statesmen like Sixtus V; they were usually good men too weak to overcome
the human vices around them, or to keep an eye upon the thousand
loopholes and crannies that let corruption pass or hide in the
administration of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>431</p>
<p>Church. Perhaps no institution so vast in its scope and tasks can be
kept clear of the faults inherent in the nature of man. Innocent X
(1644-55), “blameless of life and upright in principle,” 6 labored to
moderate taxation, to check the exploitation of papal revenues by greedy
nobles, and to maintain order and justice in his states. As pictured by
Velazquez he has every semblance of a powerful character, but he allowed
others to govern for him, and let Olimpia Maidalchini, his ambitious and
acquisitive sister-in- law, influence his appointments and policies.
Cardinals and envoys humbled themselves before her, and she became
scandalously wealthy on their gifts; but when Innocent died she
professed herself too poor to pay for his funeral. 7</p>
<p>In the conclave that chose his successor a cardinal is said to have
ex- claimed, “This time we must seek an honest man.” 8 They found him in
Fabio Chigi, who became Alexander VII (1655-67). He did his best to
cleanse the papal administration of venality and delay; he banished his
esurient nephews to Siena; he reduced the public debt. But the
corruption around him was too extensive and pervasive to be overcome. He
yielded, let his nephews return to Rome, and gave them lucrative posts;
one of them soon amassed a fortune. 9 Power passed from Alexander’s
tired hands to the cardinals, who claimed more and more authority in the
government of the Church. An aristocracy of families boasting cardinals
replaced the absolute monarchy that the Council of Trent had confirmed
to the popes.</p>
<p>Clement IX (1667-69) renewed the struggle against nepotism. He</p>
<p>allowed his relatives some modest privileges, but he turned his back
upon petitioners for place. Hundreds had come from his native Pistoia,
confident that he would raise them to affluence; he refused them; they
lampooned him; we perceive again that the nature of man is the same in
the oppressor and the oppressed, and that the people are the chief
source of the evils that surround them. The new Pope was a man of peace
and justice. Whereas his predecessor, at the urging of Louis XIV, had
issued a troublemaking bull against the Jansenists, Clement effected a
truce in that quarrel within the Church. It was a misfortune that he
died after only two years of rule.</p>
<p>Clement X (1670-76) was eighty at his accession; he left matters to
the cardinals (as they had planned), but he concluded his pontificate
without reproach. Innocent XI (1676-89), says the Protestant Ranke, was
a man “remarkable for humility, . . . most gentle and placid in
disposition,”</p>
<p>conscientious in morals and resolute in reforms. 10 He discontinued
the “college” of apostolic notaries, “of which,” says a Catholic
historian, “the appointments were regularly bought and sold.” 11 He
abolished manv useless offices, privileges, and exemptions, balanced the
papal budget for the first time in many years, and established such a
reputation for fiscal integrity that the Curia was now able to borrow
money at three per cent . He was “a virtuous man,” wrote Voltaire, “a
wise pontiff, a poor theologian,</p>
<p>43 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>a courageous, resolute, and magnificent prince.” 12 He tried in vain
to moderate the precipitation of James II in Catholicizing England.
He</p>
<p>condemned the violence used by Louis XIV against the Huguenots; men
“must be led to the temple,” he said, “not dragged into it.” 13 He had
no reason to love the proud King who claimed over the Church in France
almost as full authority as that which Henry VIII had asserted in
England. To reduce crime in Rome Innocent XI annulled the right of
asylum</p>
<p>previously accorded to the residences of ambassadors; Louis insisted
on retaining that right for his envoys, and even for the streets
adjacent to the French embassy, and in 1687 his ambassador entered Rome
with a regi- ment of cavalry to enforce the royal claim. The Pope
censured the</p>
<p>ambassador, and laid an interdict upon the Church of St. Louis, where
the ambassador worshiped in Rome. Louis appealed to a general council,
imprisoned the papal nuncio in France, and seized the territory of
Avignon, which had belonged to the papacy since 1348. Hence Innocent XI
looked with -equanimity upon the expedition of Protestant William III of
Orange to unseat Catholic James II and bring England into a coalition
against France. He co-operated with the efforts of Leibniz to reunite
Catholicism and Protestantism; he sanctioned concessions which were
pronounced satisfactory in the uiversities of Protestant Germany; an
Englishman called him “a Protestant pope.” 14</p>
<p>Innocent XI died before he could see the triumph of his aims; but</p>
<p>during the pontificates of Alexander VIII (1689-91) and Innocent
XII</p>
<p>(1691-1700) the French ambassador relinquished the right of asylum,
Avignon was returned to the papacy, the French clergy transferred its
allegiance from king to pope, and the Grand Alliance restored the
balance of power against aggressive France. In the War of the Spanish
Succession Clement XI (1700-21) found himself caught between the violent
divisions of Europe; he threw his influence hesitantly now upon one
side, now upon the other; in the end the kings divided the spoils — even
Sicily and Sardinia, technically papal fiefs — without consulting him.
In like manner the Treaty of Westphalia had ignored the protests of
Innocent X. The intensification of nationalism involved the weakening of
the papacy, and shared with the growth of science in promoting
secularism and lessening the role of religion in European life.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>ITALIAN ART</li>
</ol>
<p>Art as well as politics felt this mounting rivalry between the
sacred</p>
<p>and the profane. Ecclesiastics were still the richest patrons,
commissioning structures, paintings, statuary, metalwork, and
decoration; but the</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>aristocracy now multiplied palaces faster than churches, courted
posterity with portraits, and dowered it with collections of art. In
seventeenth- century Italy the two streams of patronage ran side by side
in a colorful descent from the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Turin was rising to affluence under the Savoy dukes. For the
Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista, Guarino Guarini designed the
Cappella del</p>
<p>Santissimo Sudario, the Chapel of the Most Holy Shroud (in which, the
faithful believed, Joseph of Arimathea had wrapped the corpse of
Christ). The dome of the great Church of San Filippo, begun by Guarini,
collapsed as it neared completion; it was restored by Filippo Iuvara,
who was born (1676) seven years before Guarini ’s death. Perhaps we
shall meet Iuvara again.</p>
<p>In Genoa the master building of this time was the Palazzo
Durazzo,</p>
<p>built by Falcone and Cantone in 1650, bought by the house of Savoy in
1817, and thenceforth serving as the Palazzo Reale; its famous Hall of
Mirrors, foreshadowing the Galerie des Glaces (1678) of Versailles, was
shattered in the Second World War; it is not true that Mars ever loved
Venus. The outstanding Genoese painter was now Alessandro Magnasco, whom
we may sample by the Synagogue in the Chicago Art Institute, or by the
Bohemian Repast in the Louvre.</p>
<p>Venice persisted in breeding heroes and artists. What could be more
heroic than the defense of Candia against the Turks? Through a quarter
of a century the soldiers and sailors of the Porte assailed Crete, then
a Venetian colony; 100,000 Turks died in those passionate campaigns; 15
and though a Turkish army of 50,000 men took some minor cities in the
island, the capital stood siege for twenty years, repulsing thirty-two
attacks. In 1667 Francesco Morosini was sent to command the starving
garrison. It surrendered at last (1668), but no one spoke any longer of
Venetian degeneration. In 1693, when Morosini, aged seventy-five, took
charge of the Venetian fleet, the Turks withdrew at its approach, awed
by his very name. He was still the sort of man portrayed by Tintoretto
and Veronese — courage incarnate and merciless.</p>
<p>Baldassare Longhena was another of this septuagenarian mold. Many
years back (1632) he had designed that stately mistress of the lagoons,
Santa Maria della Salute; now, forty-seven years later, he built the
Palazzo Pesaro on the Grand Canal — powerful and beautiful with its
double columns and multiple cornices; and in 1680 (aged seventy-six) the
Palazzo Rezzonico, where Browning was to die. Sebastiano Ricci, another
hardy plant, bore the Venetian seed through half the Continent. Bom
(1659) at Belluno in the province of Venezia, he went to Florence to
decorate the Palazzo Marucelli, then followed the line of least
starvation to Milan, Bologna, Piacenza, Rome, Vienna, London. He spent
ten years in England,</p>
<p>434</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>painted in Chelsea Hospital, Burlington House, and Hampton Court</p>
<p>Palace, and narrowly missed appointment to decorate the new
St. Paul’s. Then to Paris, where he was elected to the Academie des
Beaux-Arts. His Diana and Nymphs 16 is as voluptuous as Boucher, as
gracious as Correggio. Surviving till 1734, Ricci transmitted his skills
to the eighteenth century, and prepared for the Indian summer of
Venetian painting under Tiepolo.</p>
<p>The Bolognese school had not quite spent its force. Carlo Cignani won
fame with his frescoes in the cath edral at Forli. Giuseppe Maria Crespi
(“Lo Spagnuolo”) revealed in his Self -Portrait 17 a man absorbed,
forgetting all troubles if allowed to paint. Giovanni Battista Salvi
(“II Sassoferrato”) rendered the selflessness of devotion in The Madonna
Praying , 16 and showed us, in his Virgin and Child , 16 just such a
simple mother, happy in her bambino, as one may see any day among the
poor of Italy.</p>
<p>Two reigns of Tuscan grand dukes carried Florence, Pisa, and
Siena</p>
<p>through this age: Ferdinand II and Cosimo III. In 1659 Siena began
its renowned palio: the ten wards provided a procession, in picturesque
costumes, along streets adorned with architecture, bunting, flowers, and
vivacious women alluringly dressed; then the chosen horsemen of the
wards competed madly in a race for the cloak (palio) of the Madonna to
whom the devout city had long since dedicated its life and soul.
Florence had now only minor painters. Carlo Dolci continued, with
lessened art, the senti- mental, heaven-brooding Virgins and saints of
Guido Reni; all the world knows his St. Cecilia . 26 Justus Sustermans,
who migrated from Flanders to Florence, painted portraits that are among
the arresting surprises in the Pitti Gallery — not least the majestic
head of Galileo. So, and not as in the horned monster of Michelangelo,
Moses might have looked, giving laws.</p>
<p>In Rome art was recovering from the restraints of the Counter
Reforma- tion. The popes returned in subdued measure to the spirit of
the Renais- sance, encouraging literature, drama, architecture,
sculpture, and painting. Innocent X restored the Capitol and the Church
of San Giovanni in</p>
<p>Laterano. Alexander VII commissioned Bernini to raise a quadruple
cordon of granite guardsmen around St. Peter’s Square (1655 -67) — 284
columns and 88 pilasters, successfully transmuting gold into stone. In
the same reign Pietro da Cortona rebuilt the Church of Santa Maria della
Pace, where Raphael’s Sibyls still pondered fa te; and Girolamo Rainaldi
joined with his son Carlo in erecting the handsome Church of Sant’
Agnese in the Piazza Navona. Father and son collaborated again in
designing the Church of Gesu e Maria; and Carlo reared the shrine of
Santa Maria in Campitelli to shelter an image of the Virgin which was
believed to have stopped the plague of 1656. Cardinals and nobles housed
and buried themselves palatially. Now rose the Palazzo Doria and the
exuberantly baroque gallery in the Palazzo Colonna; and for the
Bolognetti family, in the Church of</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>Gesu e Maria, Francesco Cavallini carved a tomb that must have made
the living envious of the dead.</p>
<p>Many painters testified to the survival of their art in Rome.
Carlo</p>
<p>Maratti was courted there, in the second half of the seventeenth
century, as the pictorial protagonist of late baroque. His portrait of
Clement IX 21 remembered Velazquez’ Innocent X, but it came off well
enough; his Madonna ’with Saints in Paradise 22 repeated a hundred such,
but it is beautiful. When Clement XI wished to have Raphael’s Vatican
frescoes restored he assigned to Maratti this delicate operation,
dangerous to the restorer as well as to the pictures; and it was
competently done. Giovanni Battista Gaulli (“II Baciccio”) was chosen by
the Jesuits to paint the vault</p>
<p>The greatest Italian painters were now in Naples. Everything
flourished there — music, art, literature, politics, drama, hunger,
murder, and always the gay, furious, melodious pursuit of feminine
curves by agitated men. Salvator Rosa was moved by all these elements of
life. His father was an architect, an uncle taught him painting, his
brother-in-law was a pupil of Ribera, and Salvator himself was in time
admitted to that august studio. Another teacher transmitted to him the
technique of drawing battle scenes. Salvator became especially famous
for such pictures, which can be seen in the Naples Museo Nazionale or
the Louvre. From battles he passed to landscapes, but there too his wild
spirit favored Nature in her tantrums, as in the Louvre canvas of heavy
clouds and darkened earth abruptly il- luminated by lightning that in a
moment shatters rocks and withers trees. Lanfranco persuaded him to go
to Rome and cultivate cardinals; he went and prospered, but in 1646 he
hurried back to Naples to participate in Masaniello’s revolt. When that
collapsed he returned to Rome, painted high ecclesiastics, and wrote a
scornful satire of ecclesiastical luxury. He accepted the invitation of
Cardinal Giancarlo de’ Medici to come and live with him in Florence;
there he remained nine years, painting, playing music, writing poetry,
taking part in plays. Again in Rome, he took a house on the Pincian
Hill, where Poussin and Lorrain had lived. The dignitaries of the
Church, smiling at his tirades, and loving his brush more than his
pen.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>

<p>flocked to him for portraits; for a decade he was the most popular
painter in Italy. He made the customary pictures of saints and myths,
but in his etchings he indulged his sympathy for poor soldiers and
harassed peasants; and these etchings are among his finest works.</p>
<p>His fame was rivaled only by another Neapolitan. Luca Giordano was
already an artist at eight; then he painted, in the Church of Santa
Maria la Nuova, two angels so graceful that the Viceroy, seeing them,
marveled, and sent the boy some gold pieces, with a recommendation to
Ribera. For nine years Luca studied with that brooding master,
astonishing everyone with his readiness in copying masterpieces and
imitating styles. He longed to go to Rome and examine the famous
frescoes of Raphael, but his father, who lived by selling Luca’s
paintings and drawings, protested. Lu ca absconded secretly; soon he was
copying con furia in the Vatican, in St. Peter’s, in the Palazzo Famese.
His father followed him, and again lived by selling his son’s obiter
picta ; a story has it that Luca got his nickname, Fa -Presto, from his
fath er’s urging him to speed.</p>
<p>Having absorbed Rome, he went on to Venice and painted, in the</p>
<p>manner of Titian and Correggio, pictures hardly distinguishable from
their masterpieces. But he painted originals too, which won acclaim; we
may judge them from the powerful Crucifixion and Deposition from the
Cross in the Venetian Academy. Returning to Naples, he decorated a dozen
churches and palaces with a competence and celerity that reduced his
rivals to picking flaws. Invited to Florence by Cosimo III (1679), he
won</p>
<p>plaudits for his frescoes in the Cappella Corsini. His friend Carlo
Dolci fell into such deep melancholy at seeing Luca’s success that he
soon died; 23 fond Italy tells as many legends about her artists as
about her saints. In another story the Spanish Viceroy at Naples
commissioned a large panel for the Church of St. Francis Xavier; raged
when, after long deferments, he found no work done on the assignment;
and was amazed, two days later, to find it complete and beautiful. “The
painter of this picture,” exclaimed the</p>
<p>Viceroy, “is either an angel or a demon.” 24</p>
<p>The fame of the demonic angel reached Madrid; soon Luca was pressed
with invitations from Charles II to join the Spanish court. Though the
King was approaching bankruptcy, he sent the artist a gratuity of
fifteen hundred ducats, and put a royal galley at Luca’s disposal for
the trip. When Giordano neared Madrid (1692), six royal coaches met him
on the road. Soon thereafter, aged sixty-seven, Giordano began work in
the Escorial. He adorned with frescoes the grand staircase of the
monastery; and on the vault of the church he painted a “facsimile” of
the heavens, showing Charles V and Philip II in Paradise — all their
sins forgiven as a courtesy from the Trinity to the Hapsburgs. In the
next two years he executed a large number of frescoes, which Spanish
historians of art rank as the best ever made in</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>437</p>
<p>the Escorial. 25 There and in the Alcazar, or royal palace, at
Madrid, and at Buen Retiro and in the churches of Toledo and the
capital, he painted so many pictures, with such industry, that his
rivals taunted him with work- ing eight hours a day and on holydays. Nor
did it please them that he amassed an unseemly fortune, living
abstemiously but buying costly jewels as a safe investment, since
everything would change but human vanity. All the court honored him, and
Charles II, in a lucid moment, called him greater than a king.</p>
<p>Charles died in 1700. Giordano remained in Spain despite the
consequent War of the Spanish Succession, and when Philip V came to the
throne he continued to receive lucrative and difficult commissions. In
1702 he returned to Italy, stopped in Rome to kiss the papal foot, and
reached Naples in triumph. On ceilings in the Certosa, or Carthusian
Monastery, of San Martino, overlooking the city, he painted in
forty-eight hours a series of frescoes that displayed an energy and
skill almost incredible in a man of seventy- two years (1704). A year
later he died, sighing, “O Napoli , sospiro mio!” (O Naples, breath of
my life!) 26</p>
<p>At his death his fame was equaled by that of no other artist in
his</p>
<p>generation. Dutch burgomasters competed with emperors and kings to
buy his paintings, and in far-off England Matthew Prior sang the praises
of “divine Jordain.” Laymen admired the richness of his colors, the
force of his figures, the grandeur of his conceptions, the power of his
presentation. But artists, recovering from this stupor mundi, pointed to
the signs of haste in Luca Fa- Presto’s work, the incongruous mingling
of pagan and Christian ideas or subjects in the same scene, the strained
or affected attitudes, the excessive glare of light, the absence of
harmony and repose. Luca had long since replied to his critics by
defining a good painter as one whom the public likes. 27 It is difficult
to refute such a definition, since there is no objective standard of
excellence or good taste; but we may find the least subjective test of
greatness in the extent of a man’s influence in space and time, and the
least subjective measure of a reputation in its ability to survive.
Giordano had the happiness of a successful life, and feels no hurt from
his dying fame.</p>
<p>Francesco Solimena was forty-eight when Fa-Presto died, but his four-
score years and ten carried the Neapolitan school almost to the middle
of the eighteenth century. Luca had painted the nave of the monastery at
Monte Cassino; Francesco painted the choir; both works succumbed in the
Second World War. But the museums preserve Solimena’s art: in Vienna The
Rape of Oreithyia, a fleshly rapture of male muscles and female
contours; in the Louvre an echo and challenge of Raphael in Heliodorus
Driven from the Temple; and in Cremona a Madonna Addolorata accom-</p>

<li>THE CHRISTINE ODYSSEY</li>
</ol>
<p>The arts were now but a small part of the cultural life of Rome. Here
were also hundreds of musicians, poets, dramatists, scholars, and
historians. Museums, libraries, and colleges offered the treasures of
the past to the student, and academies gave encouragement to literature
and science. The decorative conceits of Marini still infected Italian
verse, but the sting of Tassoni’s satires, the fire of Marini’s
sensualism, and the bubbling flow of Tasso’s stanzas had given Italian
poetry a stimulus and an afflatus still felt in lyric souls.</p>
<p>The greatest lyric poet of modem times, should we believe Macaulay ,
28 was Vincenzo da Filicaia. He celebrated in grateful odes the
deliverance of Vienna by Sobieski, he welcomed Christina to Rome with
ecstatic flattery, and he voiced with angry shame the subjection of his
country to foreign arms:</p>
<p>Italia, O Italia, doomed to wear</p>
<p>The fatal wreath of loveliness, and so</p>
<p>The record of illimitable woe</p>
<p>Branded forever on thy brow to bear!</p>
<p>Would that less beauty and more vigor were</p>
<p>Thy heritage! that they who madly glow</p>
<p>For that which their own fury layeth low</p>
<p>More terrible might find thee, or less fair ! 29</p>
<p>Henry Hallam, after wandering as a learned linguist through all
the</p>
<p>literature of Europe, thought that not Filicaia but Carlo Alessandro
Guidi had “raised himself to the highest point that any lyric poet of
Italy has attained,” and that “his ode on Fortune 〔was〕 at least equal
to any in the Italian language .” 30 No on e still uncomfortable in
Italian can settle this dispute between Macaulay and Hallam, between
Guidi and Petrarch, be- tween Filicaia and Byron or Shelley or
Keats.</p>
<p>Guidi was one of several poets who warbled their rhymes in
Christina’s Roman salon. The Queen of Sweden had formerly won renown not
only as head of a great power but as a patron and paragon of learning,
the eager hostess of Salmasius and Descartes. Now her abandonment of a
crown for a faith, her conversion from the Protestantism that her father
had died to save, and her pilgrimage through the courts of Europe to
kiss the feet of the Pope — these were events that rivaled wars and
revolutions in fascinating the European mind.</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>439</p>
<p>She was twenty-eight years old when she left Sweden (1654). Her
cousin Charles X, whom she had nominated to her throne, gave her fifty
thousand crowns to gild her journey, and the Swedish Diet voted her a
substantial income, and the rights of a queen over her retinue. Hurrying
through Denmark, she reached Hamburg, where she scandalized the natives
by putting up at the house of a Jewish financier, who as her financial
agent had served her faithfully. She passed incognita through Protestant
Holland, but in Catholic Antwerp she assumed her own dress. There she
royally received the Archduke Leopold, and Elizabeth of Bohemia (another
dethroned Queen), and Elizabeth’s daughter the Princess Elizabeth
(another pupil of Descartes). Then to Brussels, where she was hailed
with bonfires, fireworks, cannon salvos, and applauding crowds. For a
time she gave herself joyously to balls, tournaments, hunting parties,
and plays; Mazarin sent a company of actors from Paris to entertain her.
On Christmas Eve she made private abjuration of the Lutheran faith, and
announced her resolve to “listen to no more sermons.” 31 She dallied in
Flanders while the Roman Curia prepared plans for her official reception
into the Church and Italy. Leaving Brussels, she traveled leis urely
into Austria. “At Innsbruck she made her formal profession of the
Catholic creed. Her progress through Italy to Rome was as glorious as
that of a victorious Caesar. Town after town adorned itself to greet
her; fetes and spectacles were arranged in her honor at Mantua, Bologna,
Faenza, Rimini, Pesaro, Ancona; at last (Decem- ber 19, 1655) she
entered Rome amid a blaze of illuminations that made a game of her
disguise. On the morrow she proceeded to the Vatican and was welcomed by
Alexander VII. After she had been three days in Rome she was escorted
from it to make the formal entry that had been scheduled by the high
ecclesiastics. Riding a white horse in prancing state, she passed
through a triumphal arch and the Porta del Popolo into the city, between
lines of soldiery and crowds of populace. It was as if the old Church
felt that in the abjuration of one woman the whole Protestant
Reformation had been annulled.</p>
<p>All that consummated, Christina was allowed to rule her own days,</p>
<p>receiving prelates, potentates, and pundits, visiting museums,
libraries, academies, and ruins, and astonishing her guides by her
knowledge of Italian history, literature, and art. The great families
overwhelmed her with banquets, gifts, and compliments; Cardinal Colonna,
aged fifty, fell in love with her, serenaded her, and had to be banished
to save the dignity of the Church. Soon she found herself entangled in
the rivalries of French and Spanish factions at the papal court. Sweden,
financing with difficulty a war with Poland, interrupted the payment of
her allotted revenue. She pawned her jewels, and received a loan from
the Pope.</p>
<p>In July, 1656, she set out on a visit to France. There too she
was</p>
<p>honored as a queen. She entered Paris on a white charger richly
caparisoned;</p>
<p>44° the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XV</p>
<p>a thousand cavaliers rode forth to meet her; crowds cheered her;
officials smothered her with oratorical flowers. The current Due de
Guise, sent by Mazarin to escort her, described her as</p>
<p>not tall, but she has a plump waist and large hips, handsome arms, a
white and well-made hand, but more that of a man than a woman.</p>
<p>. . . The face is large without being out of shape. . . . Nose
aquiline,</p>
<p>mouth rather big but not disagreeable; . . . eyes very fine and full
of fire. … A very odd headgear . . . : a mafs wig, thick and high. . .
.</p>
<p>She is shod like a man, and she has the tone of voice and nearly all
the actions of a man. She affects to play the amazon . . . She is very
civil and cajoling, speaks eight languages, principally French — as well
as if she were born in Paris. She knows more than our Academy with the
Sorbonne added;. understands painting admirably, as she does all other
things. A very extraordinary person. 32</p>
<p>Sh e was lodged in the King’s apartment in the Louvre. Later the Due
de Guise led her to Compiegne, where she was received by Louis XIV, then
a handsome lad of eighteen. Court ladies fluttered about her, but were
disconcerted by her masculine dress and speech. Mme. de Motteville
thought she “looked at first sight like a disreputable gypsy,” but
“after . . . I began to get accustomed to her clothes … I noticed that
her eyes were fine and sparkling, that there was gentleness in her face,
and kindness mingled with pride. Finally I perceived with amazement that
she pleased me.” 33 Generally, however, the women who embroidered French
manners, fashions, gaiety, tact, and grace were offended by Christina’s
carelessness in dress, her “immoderate laughter, 〔 and〕 her
freethinking in speech, as much on religion as on topics about which the
proprieties of her sex de- manded more reserve. . . . She professed to
despise all women on account of their ignorance, and took pleasure in
conversing with men, on evil topics as much as good ones. She observed
none of the rules.” 84 Voltaire thought that the ladies of France judged
this unruly queen too harshly for her failure to follow the norm. “There
was not,” he said, “one woman at the French court whose intellect was
equal to hers.” 35 Christina, for her part, set down the court ladies as
too affected, the men as too feminine, and both as insincere. At Senlis,
on the way back from Compiegne to Paris, she asked to see “a demoiselle
named Ninon 〔de Lenclos〕, cele brated for her vice, her loose way of
living, her beauty, and her wit. To her alone, of all the women she saw
in France, did she show any signs of regard.” 38 She found Ninon
temporarily confined to a convent. Christina conversed gaily with her,
and approved her avoidance of marriage. 37 After visiting the cultural
institutions and notable art of France, Christina returned to Italy
(November, 1656).</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>44I</p>
<p>In September, 1657, she visited France again. She was not as formally
received as before, but she was lodged semiregally at Fontainebleau.
There she alarmed France by what she appears to have thought a
legitimate use of her royal rights over her retinue. The Marchese
Monaldeschi, her equerry, entered into a conspiracy against her, which
she detected by intercepting his letters. He made matters worse by
accusing another on her staff of the plot. She confronted him with his
incriminating letters; she ordered a priest to hear his confession and
give him absolution, and then she had the Marchese put to death by her
guards. France was shocked, and even those who recognized the rights
which the Swedish Diet had granted her over her attendants were
scandalized that so sudden and arbitrary a use of her authority had been
made in rooms belonging to the King of France.</p>
<p>Though Christina was allowed to spend that winter in Paris, enjoying
plays and balls, the court was much relieved when she left for Italy
(May, 1658).</p>
<p>The interruption of her income from Sweden placed her in such straits
that she is said to have asked the Emperor Leopold I for an army which
she herself would lead against Charles X; she was dissuaded from this
martial enterprise by an annuity of twelve thousand scudi from Pope
Alexander VII. Twice she visited Sweden (1660, 1667) to regain her
revenues, and perhaps her crown. The revenues were restored to her, but
she was not welcomed in Stockholm; the Lutheran clergy accused her of
plotting to convert the nation to Catholicism, and she was forbidden to
hear Mass in her apartments. After each of these visits to Sweden she
retired to Hamburg. Thence in 1668 she sent agents to Warsaw to enter
her candidacy for the Polish throne, left vacant by the abdication of
John Casimir; Pope Clement IX supported her claim, but the Polish Diet
rejected her for many reasons, one of which was her refusal to marry;
not all the empire of the world, she said, would reconcile her to
matrimony. 88 She returned to Italy in Novem- ber, 1668, and remained
there till her death.</p>
<p>Those final twenty years were the most gracious of her life. Her
apart- ments in the Palazzo Corsini became the leading salon in Rome,
the rendezvous of prelates, scholars, composers, nobles, and foreign
diplomats. There she welcomed Alessandro Scarlatti, and received from
Arcangelo Corelli the dedication of his first published sonatas. Her
rooms were embellished with paintings, statues, and other forms of art
chosen with a taste admired by conoisseurs; and the manuscripts she
collected were later reckoned among the choicest in the Vatican Library.
She discouraged the artificial style that had developed in Italian
verse, and influenced Guidi to lead a movement back to the purity of
language, and directness of expression, prevalent under the Medici. Her
own memoirs were a model of simple and forceful speech, and her
Aphorisms were the sharp and pithy pronouncements of a woman of the
world who did not let her piety hamper</p>
<p>442</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>her enjoyment of life. She was no bigot. She condemned the violence
of French Catholics in enforcing the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
“I look upon France,” she wrote, “a s a sick person, whose arms and legs
have been cut off in order to treat her for a disorder of which she
would have been completely cured by the exercise of gentleness and
patience.” 39 Bayle thought these sentiments a remnant of her Protestant
rearing; she reproved him for this interpretation; he wrote her an
apology; she forgave him on condition that he send her new or curious
books. 40</p>
<p>She died in 1689, aged sixty- three, and was buried in St. Peter’s.
Three years after her death Giovanni Maria Crescimbeni founded in her
memory the Arcadian Academy, whose first members were chiefly those who
had formerly gathered under her wing. They continued the old association
of poetry with pastoralism; they called themselves shepherds, took
bucolic names, and held their meetings in the fields. They established
branches in the principal cities of Italy, and, despite their
constitutional artifice, they ended the reign of conceits in Italian
poetry.</p>

<p>In that gay society of seventeenth-century Italy music was the
note</p>
<p>and air of life. A passionate people, kept in unwilling peace by
Spain and the papacy, waged wars in operas, and fought love combats in
madrigals.</p>
<p>Musical instruments took a hundred forms. The organ was now an</p>
<p>embellished bellows with two keyboards for the hands and one for the
feet, plus diverse stops; and of course there were “portative” organs
for the street. As early as 1598 we hear of another keyboard instrument,
called piano e forte, which was listed as owned and played by Duke
Alfonso II at Modena; but how far this differed from the clavicembalo
(harpsichord) and the spinetta is still a mystery. A century passes
before we hear of the pianoforte again. In 1709 Bartolommeo Cristofori,
instrument maker to the music- loving Prince Ferdinand de’ Medici at
Florence, displayed what he called a “gravicembalo col piano e forte”
This differed slightly and yet vitally from the harpsichord: the note
was sounded by a little hammer rising to strike a string, and the sound
could be made low or loud by varying the touch of the fingers on the key
— whereas in previous keyboard instruments the note had been produced by
a plectrum (of quill or hard leather) rising to pluck the string, and no
variation was possible in the force of the sound.* The pianoforte slowly
replaced the harpsichord in the • One of Cristofori’s pianofortes, dated

<p>eighteenth century, not only because it could play “soft and loud,”
but because the hammers wore out less rapidly than the plectra.</p>
<p>The violin had evolved out of the lyre in the sixteenth century,
chiefly at Brescia.* Andrea Amad had brought the art of violinmaking to
Cremona, and there his grandson Nicolo surpassed all rivals in the craft
until he himself was excelled by his pupils Andrea Guameri and Antonio
Stradivari. The Guarneri too were a dynasty: Andrea an d his sons Pietro
“de Mantua” and Giuseppe I, his grandson Pietro II “de Venezia,” and his
grandnephew Giuseppe II “del Gesu” — who made the violin preferred by
Paganini to all others. The oldest violin signed by Stradivari is dated
1666, when he was twenty-two years old; it was labeled antonius
stradivarius cremonensis alumnus nicoli amati faciebat anno 1 666,
followed by his personal</p>
<p>symbol — a Maltese cross and his initials, A.S., enclosed in a double
circle. Later he signed himself with proud si mplicity “Stradivarius.”
He worked incessantly, ate frugally, lived ninety-three years, and
amassed such a fortune by the superior beauty, construction, tone, and
finish of his instru- ments that ricco come Stradivari became Cremonese
for opulence. He is known to have made 1,1 16 violins, violas, and
violoncellos; 540 of his violins exist today; some have sold for ten
thousand dollars. 41 The secret of his varnish has been lost.</p>
<p>The improvement in instruments encouraged the development of the
orchestra, and the composition and performance of instrumental music.
Composers and virtuosos discovered in the violin a flexibility of
movement and range of tone impossible for the human voice; they could
run up and down the chromatic scale with literally ineffable ease; they
could build and frolic with variations; they could escape from the
grooves of melody and launch upon new rhythms, evolutions, and
experiments. When many instru- ments were combined the composition could
be freed from the dance as well as from song, and could mount on its own
wings in new sequences, combinations, and forms. Tommaso Vitali led the
way with violin sonatas of unprecedented richness of invention, and
helped to establish the progres- sion of quick, slow, and lively
movements. Arcangelo Corelli, as composer and virtuoso, prepared for
eighteenth-century chamber music with his sonatas for the violin; he and
Vitali in Italy, Kuhnau and Heinrich von Biber in Germany, gave
structure and form to the sonata as a piece to be sounded by instruments
only, in contrast to cantatas as compositions to be sung by the voice.
It was Corelli who set the form of the concerto grosso — two violins and
one violoncello leading an orchestra of strings — with such simple and
melodious productions as his Christmas Concerto (1712); so he opened a
path for the concertos of Vivaldi and Handel and the suites of Bach.
Corelli’s compositions retained their popularity so far into the *

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>eighteenth century that Buriley, writing about 1780, thought their
fame wo uld endure “as long as ihe present system of music shall
continue to delight the ears of mankind.” 42</p>
<p>As Corelli was now the favorite composer for the violin, so
Alessandro Stradella, with solos, duets, trios, and oratorios, dominated
the vocal music of this age. His life itself was a music drama, and has
been made into a play and an opera. As a teacher of singing at Venice he
achieved a tragic success. One of his aristocratic pupils, Ortensia,
though affianced to the Venetian senator Alvise Contarini, eloped with
Alessandro to Rome. The senator sent assassins to slay them. These
sensitive cutthroats, hearing him sing the lead- ing part in his
“Oratorio di San Giovanni Battista” in the Church of San Giovanni in
Laterano, were so touched by the music that (so the story avers) they
abandoned their assignment and warned Stradella and his mistress to seek
some safe obscurity. The lovers fled to Turin, but soon Alessandro
became dangerously famous there by his compositions and his voice.
Contarini sent two unmusical ruffians to kill him; they attacked him,
and left him for dead. He recovered, married Ortensia, and moved with
her to Genoa. There the senatorial hirelings found them, and stabbed
them both to death (168 2). 48 The oratorio that allegedly saved his
life remained popular for a century, and prepared the way for
Handel.</p>
<p>Opera had by this time become a craze in Italy. Venice alone had
sixteen opera houses in 1699, and heard nearly a hundred different
operas between 1662 and 1680. 44 The melodious spectacle was only
slightly less fashionable in Naples. In Rome it symbolized the advancing
secularization of music; Clement IX himself, before his elevation to the
papacy, composed some musical comedies. 46 There was a temporary decline
in the quality of Italian opera after Monteverdi; the plots lost in
dignity and significance, but gained in absurdity and violence.
Francesco Cavalli, a pupil of Monteverdi, developed the solo aria as the
most delectable feature of the performance; soon the audiences demanded
a succession of dramatic airs, and bore the intervals impatiently.
Castrated boys or men took many soprano or con- tralto parts, but prima
donnas now began to rival queens. Milton addressed Latin lyrics to
Leonora Baroni, and Naples turned out en masse to welcome Leonora’s
mother, Adriana Basile, the most thrilling soprano of her time. Stage
machinery probably reached its ne plus ultra in this age: in seven-
teenth-century Venice, according to Molmenti, the Theater of San
Cassiano could show on demand a royal palace, a forest, an ocean,
Olympus, and heaven; and in one case a ballroom, fully illuminated, with
all its furniture and dancers, was suspended over the permanent stage,
and was lowered to it, or raised out of view, as the story required. 48
Marcantonio Cesti sought to rescue opera from the aria; he gave more
scope and prominence to the overture, more logic and sobriety to the
story, and varied the singing with</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>445</p>
<p>recitative. Both Cesti and Corelli were musical missionaries,
bringing Italian opera the one to Paris under Louis XIV, the other to
Vienna under Leopold I. Operatically Europe north of the Alps was an
Italian colony. 47</p>
<p>The dominant figure in the composition of operas was now Alessandro
Scarlatti. His son Domenico has crowded out the father in current
repute, but until recently “Scarlatti” meant Alessandro, and Domenico
was an arpeggio to a famous name. Born in Sicily (1659), Alessandro came
to Rome when he was thirteen, studied for a while under Carissimi,
composed cantatas, was stirred by the work and career of Stradella, and,
at the age of twenty, produced his first known opera, Uerrore innocente.
Christina of Sweden liked it, took Alessandro under her wing, and
produced his next operas in her private theater. In 1684 he accepted
appointment as maestro di cappella to the Spanish Viceroy at Naples. He
remained there for</p>
<p>eighteen years, producing operas in such rapid succession that by the
time of his death they numbered at least 1 14, of which only half
survive. It was probably in this period that Solimena painted the
remarkable portrait that hangs in the Naples Conservatorio di Musica — a
slender face, all sensitivity, concentration, and resolution.</p>
<p>The War of the Spanish Succession disturbed Naples, and threw Scar-
latti’s salary so far in arrears that he removed to Florence with his
wife and family, and composed and produced operas under the patronage of
Prince Ferdinand. A year later he passed to Rome as maestro di cappella
to Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, a gay and accomplished ecclesiastic who had
succeeded Christina as center and patron of the arts in Rome, and who
divided his profane energies among art, literature, music, and
mistresses. 48 In 1707 Alessandro went to Venice, where he produced his
masterpiece, Mitridate Eupatore, an opera distinguished by complete
absence of love interest. In that year Naples came under Austrian rule;
the new Viceroy invited Scarlatti to return to his former post; he
agreed, and spent there the next decade of his life, at the zenith of
his fame.</p>
<p>His operas set a style that endured for half a century. Scarlatti
made the overture a substantial composition unconnected with the opera,
and di- vided it into three movements that remained standard till
Mozart: allegro, adagio, and allegro. To the aria he gave its typical
eighteenth-century dominance and its da capo form, in which the third
section repeats the first; he infused it with passion, tenderness, and
romantic coloratura, and made it a vehicle for castrato feats of
virtuosity and improvisation, but its frequency artificially interrupted
the feeling and the action. He resisted for a time the popular demand
for sentimental airs; finally he yielded to it, and for fifty years the
music drama enjoyed a thousand triumphs with- out producing works
capable of buffeting the tides of taste. Opera de- clined till Gluck
startled it to new life and form, in Vienna (1762) and Paris, with the
haunting loveliness of Orfeo ed Euridice.</p>

Pyrenees, agreed to give no further aid to Portugal. Alfonso VI turned
to England for help; Catherine of Braganza was sent to London as the
bride of Charles II (1663), bringing as her dowry Bombay, Tangier, and £
500,000; in return, England sent troops and arms. With this and other
support, but above all by their own efforts, leadership, and discipline,
the Portuguese drove back one Spanish army after another, until, by the
Treaty of Lisbon (1668), Spain formally recognized the independence of
Portugal.</p>
<p>Pedro II strengthened the ties with England by the Methuen Treaty</p>
<p>( 1703) : each nation agreed to give preferential tariffs to the
other; Portugal would import manufactured goods from England, England
would import wine and fruit from Portugal; so the eighteenth-century
English drank port wine from Oporto, instead of “clear” claret from
Bordeaux. This economic alliance gave Portugal and her remaining
colonies a lasting pro- tection from Spain and France.</p>
<p>In 1693 the gold fields of Minas Gerais were discovered in Brazil;
soon they brought to Pedro II such bullion that after 1697 he ruled
without summoning the Cortes to vote him funds, and maintained at Lisbon
one of the most sumptuous courts in Europe. American gold, however, pro-
duced the same results in Portugal as in Spain: it was used to pay for
manufactured articles from abroad, instead of financing industrial
enter- prise at home; the native economy remained listlessly
agricultural; and even the vineyards around Oporto fell into English
hands, being bought with Portuguese gold secured in English trade.</p>
<p>Portuguese authors continued to enliven letters with deeds. Francisco
Manuel de Melo of Lisbon, after studying at the Jesuit College of S.
Antao, joined Spanish regiments bound for Flanders, survived several
battles, fought for the Spanish King in the Catalan rebellion, and wrote
its history ( Historia de la guerra de Cataluna ) in one of the many
classics contributed by the Portuguese to Spanish literature. When
Portugal declared itself free from Spain he offered his services to John
IV; welcomed, he equipped and led a Portuguese fleet. Having fallen in
love with the intoxicating Countess of Villa Nova, he was arrested on
the instigation of her husband, and spent nine years in jail. Released
on condition of exile to Brazil, he went to live at Bahia (Baia), where
he wrote his Apologos dialogaes. He was allowed to return in 1659. In
his remaining seven years he published works on morals and literature,
some poetry, and a play that anticipated</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>447</p>
<p>the theme and humor of Moliere’s Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. Though he
wrote in Spanish, Portugal properly claims him as among her most
brilliant sons.</p>
<p>Antonio Vieira was another. Born in Lisbon (1608), he was taken
in</p>
<p>childhood to Brazil, was educated by die Jesuits at Bahia, entered
their order, and astonished everyone by proposing, in eloquent sermons
and pamphlets, that Christianity be practiced by governments. Sent on a
mis- sion to Portugal (1641), he so impressed John IV by the integrity
of his character and the variety of his powers that he was made a member
of the royal Council; there he had no small part in planning the
victories that restored the independence of his country. He disturbed
established ideas by advocating the reform of the Inquisition, the
taxation of all persons regardless of class, the admission of Jewish
merchants to Portugal, and the abolition of the distinction between “Old
Christians” and “New Christians” (converted Jews) . He was one example,
in many, of the vitality, versatility, and frequent liberalism of the
Jesuits.</p>
<p>Back in Brazil (1652), he was sent as a missionary to Maranhao, but
he so uncompromisingly condemned the barbarity and morals of the slave-
owners that they had him banished to Portugal (1654). He pleaded before
the King the cause of the oppressed Indians, and secured some ameliora-
tion of their condition. Returning to South America (1655), he spent six
years as “the Apostle of Brazil,” traveling hundreds of miles on the</p>
<p>Amazon and its tributaries, risking his life daily among savage
tribes and natural perils, teaching the arts of civilization to the
natives, and so cour- ageously defending them against their overlords
that these again secured his transfer to Portugal (1661). There the
Inquisition arrested him on the charge that his writings contained
dangerous heresies and reprehensible extravagances (1665). He was
horrified by the conditions in the prisons of the Inquisition — five men
crowded into a cell nine feet by eleven, where the sole natural light
came from a slit in the ceiling, and the vessels were changed only once
a week. 49 He was released after two years, but was forbidden to write
or preach or teach. He went to Rome (1669), was welcomed and honored by
Clement X, and fascinated cardinals and com- moners with his eloquence.
Christina of Sweden vainly begged him to be her spiritual director. He
laid before the Pope a detailed indictment of the Inquisition as a blot
on the honor of the Church and a blight on the</p>
<p>prosperity of Portugal. Clement ordered that all cases before the
Portuguese Inquisition be referred to Rome, and Innocent XI suspended
that body for five years.</p>
<p>Victorious but lonesome for Indians, Vieira sailed once more to
Brazil (1681), and labored there as Jesuit teacher and missionary till
his death at eighty-nine. His works, in twenty-seven volumes, contain
much mystical</p>

<li>THE COLLAPSE OF SPAIN: 1665-17OO</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1665 Spain was still the greatest empire in Christendom. She ruled
the southern Netherlands, Sardinia, Sicily, the kingdom of Naples, the
duchy of Milan, and vast areas in North and South America. But she had
lost the naval and military power needed to control the commerce and
destiny of this scattered realm. Her costly armadas had been destroyed
by the English (1588) and the Dutch (1639); her armies had suffered
decisive defeats at Rocroi (1643) and Lens (1648); her diplomats, in the
Peace of the Pyrenees (1659), had acknowledged the triumph of France.
Her</p>
<p>economy depended upon the influx of gold and silver from America, and
that flow was repeatedly interrupted by Dutch or English fleets. Her re-
liance on foreign gold, and the scorn of her people for trade, had
Stunted her commerce and her industries. Much Spanish commerce was
carried in foreign vessels. Spanish shipping plying between Spain and
America was seventy-five per cent less in 1700 than in 1600.
Manufactured articles were imported from England and Holland, and were
paid for only in part by the export of wine, oil, iron, or wool; the
balance was paid in bullion, so that American gold merely passed through
Spain and Portugal on the way to England, France, and the United
Provinces. Cordova and Valencia, once famous for their crafts, were in
conscious and querulous decay. The expulsion of the Moriscos had injured
agriculture, and the frequent de- basement of the coinage had
demoralized finance. Roads were so bad, transport so primitive, that
towns near the sea or on navigable rivers found it cheaper to import
goods, even grain, from abroad than to bring them in from sources in
Spain. Exorbitant taxes, including a sales tax of four- teen per cent,
strove to sustain the wars of Spain against incredibly un- yielding
enemies presumably cursed by God. The standard of living was so reduced
that countless Spaniards abandoned their farms, their shops, at last
their country. Infantile mortality was high, and there was apparently
some furtive limitation of the family. Thousands of men and women be-
came barren monks or nuns, and other thousands went off to adventure in
distant lands. Seville, Toledo, Burgos, and Segovia lost part of their
population; Madrid, in the seventeenth century, fell from 400,000 to
200, ooo. 54 Spain was dying of gold.</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>449</p>
<p>Amid the spreading and intensifying poverty the upper classes both
hoarded and displayed their wealth. Long enriched by native exploitation
or imported treasure, the nobles kept their wealth from investment in
in- dustry or commerce, and dazzled one another with gems and precious
metal, with costly entertainments and magnificent equipage. The Duke of
Alva had 7,200 plates and 9,600 other vessels of silver; the Prince of
Stigliano made for his wife a sedan chair of gold and coral, so heavy
that it was unfit for use. The Church too remained rich, grew richer, 53
amid surrounding penury. The Archbishop of Santiago proposed to build an
entire chapel of silver; dissuaded, he built it all of marble. 54 The
blood of the people was the soil of wealth and the glory of God.</p>
<p>The Inquisition was as strong as ever, stronger than the government.
Autos-da-fe were less frequent than before, but only because heresy had
been burned out. The disabilities of Catholics in England could hardly
compare with the perils of Protestants in Spain. Cromwell was unable to
protect English merchants there. The English ambassador’s Protestant
servant was arrested by the Inquisition in 1691, and in that year the
corpse of the ambassador’s Anglican chaplain was exhumed a nd mutilated
by the people. The burning of converted Jews accused of secret Judaism
con- tinued. In Majorca the Inquisition built for itself a handsome
palace from the wealth confiscated in a single investigation. 55 The
populace warmly approved such bonfires, though many nobles sought to
discourage them. When in 1680 Charles II expressed the wish to see an
auto-da-fe, the artisans of Madrid volunteered to erect an amphitheater
for the sacred spectacle; during their work they cheered one another to
haste and industry by devout exhortations; it was truly a labor of love.
Charles and his young bride attended in full regalia; 120 prisoners were
judged, and twenty-one were burned to death in a caldron in the Plaza
Major; it was the greatest and most splendid auto-da-fe in the history
of Spain; and a book of 308 pages was published describing and
commemorating the event. 56 In 1696 Charles appointed a Junta Magna to
examine the abuses of the Inquisition; it submitted a report revealing
and condemning many evils, but the In- quisitor General persuaded the
King to consign the “terrible indictment” to oblivion; when, in 1701,
Philip V called for it, no copy could be found. 57 The Inquisition,
however, moved thereafter with more measured pace, and abated its
conflagrations.</p>
<p>The Church tried to redeem its wealth, and buttress the faith, by
financ- ing art. In 1677 Francisco de Herrera el Mozo designed the
second ca- thedral of Saragossa, called del Pilar from its boasting a
pillar on which the Virgin was believed to have descended from heaven.
Baroque archi- tecture now came to Spain; almost overnight the Spanish
mood passed from Gothic gloom to decorative extravagance. The great name
here is Jose</p>
<p>450</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>Churriguera; churrigueresca became for a time a name for Spanish
baroque. Born at Salamanca in 1665, he expressed his exuberant energy in
architec- ture, sculpture, cabinetry, and painting. Coming to Madrid at
the age of twenty-three, he entered a competition to design a catafalque
for the obsequies of Queen Maria Luisa; he won, and the confused
structure, 58 formed with fantastic pillars and broken cornices, and
embellished with skeletons, crossbones, and skulls, established his
reputation for fantastic skill. About 1690 he returned to Salamanca, and
for ten years labored there, adorning the cathedral, building the high
altar in the Church of San Esteban, and the magnificent hall of the city
council. In Madrid, toward the close of his life, he designed the facade
of the Church of San Tomas; dying (1725), he left the further
construction to his sons,</p>
<p>Geronimo and Nicolas; during their operations the dome fell, crushing
many workers and worshipers. A relatively moderate form of Chur-</p>
<p>rigueresque migrated to Mexico, where it produced some of the
loveliest buildings in North America.</p>
<p>Sculpture continued to be a powerful expression of the Spanish
spirit. Sometimes the power came from a bizarre realism, as when it
showed in gory detail the head of John the Baptist or some other severed
saint. The Museum of Valladolid had two such heads of St. Paul. 58 Altar
screens were still a favorite form; so Pedro Roldan carved the great
screens in the parish church of the cathedral, and in the Hospital de la
Caridad, at Seville; and his daughter Luisa Roldana, the outstanding
woman sculptor of Spain, raised in the cathedral of Cadiz a group
centering about Nuestra Senora de las Angustias — “Our Lady of the
Sorrows.” Pe dro de Mena dominated the age with his nudes (so rare in
Spanish art), his Virgins, and his choir stalls in the Malaga cathedral,
while his San Francisco, in the Seville ca- thedral, is among the finest
examples of Hispanic sculpture. Toward the end of the seventeenth
century the art shared in the general deterioration. Panels were loaded
with ornament, images were equipped with mechanisms for moving the head,
the eyes, and the mouth; real hair and dresses, and always color, were
added in efforts to reach the simplest public imagina- tion and taste.
/</p>
<p>The age of the giants was past in Spanish painting, but many
minor</p>
<p>heroes remained. Juan Carreno de Miranda, who succeeded Velazquez as
court painter, was almost as loved as he; a man modest and kindly, and
so absorbed in his work that at times he could not recall whether he had
eaten or not. His portraits of Charles II and the court so pleased the
young King that he was offered knighthood and the Cross of Santiago;
Carreno refused the distinction as beyond his merit. Madrid in those
days delighted in the story of el cantarillo de miel, the jar of honey.
Gregorio Utande, an obscure artist, had painted for the Carmelite nuns a
picture for which</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) THE FALLOW SOUTH 451</p>
<p>he asked a hundred ducats; they thought this too much, but agreed to
let Carreno decide. Before Carreno heard of this, Utande presented him a
jar of honey, and begged him to retouch the picture. This was done, much
to its improvement. Carreno was surprised when the nuns called upon him
to appraise it. He refused, but a third artist valued it at two hundred
ducats, and the secret was kept till the price was paid.</p>
<p>In his later years Carreno eased the way for one of his
successors.</p>
<p>Claudio Coello worked day and night at his easel, with indifferent
results. Carreno befriended him, and secured permission for him to study
and copy the works of Titian, Rubens, and Vandyck in the royal
galleries. The</p>
<p>experien ce helped Claudio to mature, and in 1684, a year before
Carreno’s death, Coello was appointed painter to the King. He achieved
national re- nown by his Sagrada Forma, which showed the “Sacred Wafer”
being presented to Charles II for an altar in the Escorial. The legend
behind the picture expresses the temper of Spain. In the war with the
Dutch (said the story) a consecrated Host had been trodden underfoot by
some impious Calvinists; drops of blood had flowed from the injured
wafer, at once converting one of the desecrators; the rescued Host had
been reverently carried to Vienna, and had been sent as a gift to Philip
II; since then it had been periodically exhibited, stained with Christ’s
blood, to awed wor- shipers. Coello showed the King and his principal
courtiers kneeling in adoration before the miraculous bread; half a
hundred figures appeared in the picture, nearly all individualized, and
arranged in a perspective of re- markably illusory depth. 60 After this
work, which he had taken two years to complete, Coello was the
undisputed master of all artists in the capital. Six years later (1692)
he was suddenly eclipsed by the arrival of Luca Fa-Presto Giordano from
Italy; Luca was at once given the leading role in redecorating the
Escorial. Luca made matters worse by praising Claudio’s pictures. Coello
finished the painting on which he was engaged, but then laid aside his
brush. A year after Giordano’s arrival Coello died, aged fifty - one,
allegedly of disappointment and jealousy. 61</p>
<p>Meanwhile Seville had seen the birth and death (1630-90) of the last
great figure in Spanish painting before Goya. Juan de Valdes Leal, like
Coello, was of Portuguese parentage and Spanish birth. After some years
in Cordova, he moved to Seville to challenge the ascendancy of Murillo.
He was too proud to offer to his patrons the sentimental loveliness of
demure Madonnas. He painted the Virgin in her Assumption, but his heart
and power went rather into uncompromising pictures belittling the pleas-
ures of life and pointing to inevitable death. He showed St. Anthony
turn- ing in terror from the beauty of women. 62 In Ictu Oculi (In the
Twinkling of an Eye ) represented Death as a skeleton putting out life’s
candle, whose brief illumination reveals, in chaos on the floor, the
apparatus of worldly</p>
<p>452</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>pursuits and glory — books, armor, a bishop’s miter, a king’s crown,
a chain of the order of the Golden Fleece. In a variation on this idea
Leal showed a charnel pit littered with corpses, skeletons, and skulls,
and, above these, a fair hand holding a balance in which one scale
contains the symbols of a knight, the other the insignia of a bishop;
the one scale labeled nimas (no more), the other labeled nimenos (no
less) — layman and ecclesiastic alike found wanting in the scales of
God. Murillo, viewing the first of these two paintings, said to Valdes,
“Comrade, it is a picture which can - not be looked at without holding
one’s nose” 68 — which might have been praise of the painter’s realism,
or the reaction of a healthy mind to decadent art.</p>
<p>Decadence was the order of the day. No great literary figure
dignified the age, no great drama took the stage. The universities were
languishing amid the general destitution and obscurantism; at Salamanca,
in this period, the enrollment of students fell from 7,800 to 2,076. 64
The Inquisition and the Index Librorum Prohibitorum labored successfully
to exclude from Spain all literature displeasing to the Church; for a
century Spain was hermetically sealed against the movements of the
European mind. And decadence in person sat symbolically on the
throne.</p>
<p>Charles II became king at the age of four (1665). During his minority
the country was formally ruled by his mother, Queen Mariana, actually by
her Jesuit confessor, Johannes Eberhard Nithard, then by her lover
Fernando Valenzuela. Disorder mounted, and the competent ministry of
another Don Juan of Austria was too brief to halt decay. In 1677 the
sixteen-year-old King assumed the government and presided helplessly
over the debacle. Persistent intermarriage within the Hapsburg family
may have contributed to his debility of body and mind. The Hapsburg chin
was in Charles so prognathous that he could not chew; his tongue was so
large that his speech could hardly be understood. Till the age of ten he
had been treated as an infant in arms. He could barely read; he had re-
ceived little education; and the superstitions and legends of his faith
were his dearest heritage. A leading Spanish historian describes him as
“sickly, imbecile, and highly superstitious”; he “believed himself to be
possess ed by the Devil, and was the plaything of the ambitions of all
who surrounded him.” 65 He married twice, but “it was a matter of public
knowledge that</p>
<p>The disintegration of Spain now became a European tragedy. Despite
taxation, inflation, and the exploitation of American mines, the
government was so near to bankruptcy that it could not pay the interest
on its debt, and even the royal table had to stint the service of the
King. The ad-</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE FALLOW SOUTH</p>
<p>453</p>
<p>ministrative bureaucracy, underpaid, was venal and indolent. Poverty
was so desperate that people murdered for bread; bands of starving
people broke into homes to rob and kill; and twenty thousand beggars
roamed the streets of Madrid. The police, unable to obtain their pay,
disbanded and joined the criminals.</p>
<p>Amid the chaos, insecurity, and desolation the poor, crippled,
half-</p>
<p>demented King, feeling death upon him, faced in bewilderment and
vacilla- tion the problem of fixing the succession to his throne. His
power being theoretically absolute, one line of his writing would
suffice to bequeath his empire in four continents to either Austria or
France. His mother pleaded for Austria, but Charles resented her
scheming, and the shrewish rapacity of his German wife. The French
ambassador reminded him that since the dowry of Louis XIV’s Spanish
bride had not yet been paid, her renunciation of the succession was
annulled; Louis was urging her rights, and had the power to enforce
them. If Charles overrode those rights, Europe would flame into war, and
Spain might be torn to pieces in the strife. Charles broke down under
the burden of decision; he wept, and complained that some witch had laid
unbearable misfortunes upon him. While he listened to confusing
arguments rioters besieged his palace, cry- ing out for bread.</p>
<p>In September, 1700, Charles took to his bed of death. The French
party among the factions surrounding him won the Archbishop of Toledo,
primate of Spain, to its side; he remained day and night with the dying
King, and reminded him that only Louis XIV had the power to keep the
Spanish empire intact, and to use it as a bastion of the Catholic
Church. Pope Innocent XII, under the urging of Louis, advised Charles to
favor France. At last Charles yielded, and signed the fatal will that
left all his dominions to Philip, Duke of Anjou, grandson of the French
King (Oc- tober 3, 1700). On November 1 Charles died, aged thirty-nine
but seeming to be eighty. The race of the Spanish Hapsburgs came to an
end in a sunset red with the threat of war.</p>
