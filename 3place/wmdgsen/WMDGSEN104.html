<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XThe Struggle for Freedom</p>
<p>I. MARATHON</p>
<p>N the reigns of Darius, Xerxes, and Artaxerxes,” says Herodotus,</p>
<p>J- “Greece suffered more sorrows than in twenty generations before.’”
The Greek nation had to pay the penalty of its development; spreading
everywhere, it was bound sooner or kter to come into conflict with a
major power. Using water as their highway, the Hellenes had opened up a
trade route that extended from the eastern coast of Spain to the
farthest ports of the Black Sea. This European water route —
Greco-Italian-Sicilian — com- peted more and more with the Oriental land
and water route — Indo-Perso- Phoenician; and thereby arose a lasting
and bitter rivalry in which war, by all human precedents, was
inevitable, and in which the battles of Lade, Marathon, Plataea, Himera,
Mycale, the Eurymedon, the Granicus, Issus, Arbela, Cannae, and Zama
were merely incidents. The European system won against the Oriental
partly because transport by water is cheaper than transport by land, and
partly because it is almost a law of history that the rugged, warlike
north conquers the easygoing, art-creating south.</p>
<p>In the year 512 Darius I of Persia crossed the Bosporus, invaded
Scythia, and, marching westward, conquered Thrace and Macedon. When he
re- turned to his capitals he had enlarged his realm to embrace Persia,
Afghanis- tan, northern India, Turkestan, Mesopotamia, northern Arabia,
Egypt, Cyprus, Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, the eastern Aegean, Thrace,
and Macedonia; the greatest empire that the world has yet seen had
overex- tended itself to include and awaken its future conqueror. Only
one im- portant nation remained outside this vast system of government
and trade, and that was Greece. By 510 Darius had hardly heard of it
outside Ionia. “The Athenians,” he asked— “who are they?’” About 506 the
dictator Hippias, deposed by revolution at Athens, fled to the Persian
satrap at Sardis, begged for help in regaining his power, and offered,
in that event, to hold Attica under the Persian dominion.</p>
<p>To this temptation there was added in 500 a timely provocation. The
Greek cities of Asia Minor, under Persian rule for half a century,
suddenly dismissed their satraps and declared their independence.
Aristagoras of</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>CHAP. X) THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM 235</p>
<p>Miletus went to Sparta to enlist its aid, without success; he passed
on to Athens, mother city of many Ionian towns, and pleaded so well that
the Athenians sent a fleet of twenty ships to support the revolt.
Meanwhile the lonians were acting with a chaotic vigor characteristic of
the Greeks;</p>
<p>each rebel city raised its own troops, but kept them under separate
com- mand; and the Milesian army, led with more bravery than wisdom,
marched upon Sardis and burned the great city to the ground. The Ionian
Confed- eracy organized a united fleet, but the Samian contingent
secretly made terms with the Persian satrap, and when, in 494, the
Persian navy met the Ionian at Lade, in one of the major sea battles of
history, the half hundred ships of the Samians sailed away without
fighting, and many other con- tingents followed their example.® The
defeat of the lonians was com- plete, and Ionian civilization never
quite recovered from this physical and spiritual disaster. The Persians
laid siege to Miletus, captured it, killed the males, enslaved the women
and children, and so completely plundered the city that Miletus became
from that day a minor town. Persian rule was re-established throughout
Ionia, and Darius, resentful of Athenian inter- ference, resolved to
conquer Greece. Little Athens, as the result of her generous assistance
to her daughter cities, found herself face to face with an empire
literally a hundred times greater than Attica.</p>
<p>In the year 491 a Persian fleet of six hundred ships under Dads
struck across the Aegean from Samos, stopped on the way to subdue the
Cyclades, and reached the coast of Euboea with 200,000 men. Euboea
submitted after a brief struggle, and the Persians crossed the bay to
Attica. They pitched their camp near Marathon, because Hippias had
advised them that in that plain they could use their cavalry, in which
they were overwhelmingly superior to the Greeks.*</p>
<p>All Greece was in turmoil at the news. The Persian arms had never yet
been defeated, the advance of the Empire had never yet been stopped; how
could a nation so weak, so scattered, so unused to unity, hold back this
wave of Oriental conquest? The northern Greek states were loath to
resist so monstrous a power; Sparta hesitatingly prepared, but allowed
superstition to delay its mobilization; little Plataea acted quickly,
and sent a large proportion of its citizens by forced marches to
Marathon. At Athens Miltiades freed and enlisted slaves as well as
freemen, and led them over the mountains to the battlefield. When the
rival armies met, the Greeks had some twenty thousand men, the Persians
probably one hundred thousand.’ The Persians were brave, but they were
accustomed to indi- vidual fighting, and were not trained for the mass
defense and attack of</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xthe Greeks. The Greeks united discipline with cdurage, and though
they committed the folly of dividing the command among ten generals,
each supreme for a day, they were saved by the example of Aristides, who
yielded his leadership to Miltiades.* Under this blunt soldier’s
vigorous strategy the small Greek force routed the Persian horde in what
was not only one of the decisive batdes, but also one of the most
incredible vic- tories, of history. If we may accept Greek testimony on
such a matter, 6,400 Persians, but only 192 Greeks, fell at Marathon.
After the battle was over the Spartans arrived, mourned their tardiness,
and praised the victors.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>ARISTIDES AND THEMISTOCLES</li>
</ol>
<p>The strange mixture of nobility and cruelty, idealism and cynicism,
in Greek character and history was illustrated by the subsequent careers
of Miltiades and Aristides. Inflated by the praise of all Greece,
Miltiades asked the Athenians to equip a fleet of seventy ships, to be
under his un- checked command. When the ships were ready Miltiades led
them to Paros, and demanded of its citizens one hundred talents (00,000)
on pain of wholesale death. The Athenians recalled him and flned him
fifty talents; but Miltiades died soon after, and the fine was paid by
his son Cimon, the future rival of Pericles.®</p>
<p>The man who had yielded place to him at Marathon survived the pit-
falls of success. Aristides was in life and manners a Spartan at Athens.
His quiet, staid character, his modest simplicity and undiscourageable
hon- esty won him the title of the Just; and when, in a drama of
Aeschylus’, the passage occurred —</p>
<p>For not at seeming just, but being so.</p>
<p>He aims; and from his depth of soil below</p>
<p>Harvests of wise and prudent counsels grow —</p>
<p>all the audience turned to look at Aristides, as the living
embodiment of the poet’s lines.® When the Greeks captured the camp o f
the Persians at Mara- thon, and found great wealth in their tents,
Aristides was left in charge of it, and “neither took anything for
himself, nor suffered others to do it”;” and when, after the war, the
allies of Athens were induced to con - tribute annually to the treasury
of Delos as a fund for common defense, Aristides was chosen by them to
fix their payments, and none protested his decisions. Nevertheless, he
was more adn^ed than popular. Though</p>
<p>CHAP.X) THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM *37</p>
<p>a close friend of Cleisthenes, who had so extended democracy, he was
of the opinion that democracy had gone far enough, and that any further
empowerment of the Assembly would lead to administrative corruption and
public disorder. He exposed malfeasance wherever he found it, and made
many enemies. The democratic party, led by Themistocles, used
Cleisthenes’ recently established device of ostracism to get rid of him,
and in 482 the only man in Athenian history that was at once famous and
hon- est was exiled at the height of his career. All the world knows —
though again it may be only a fable — how Aristides inscribed his own
name on the ostracon for a letterless citizen who did not know him, but
who, with the resentment of mediocrity for excellence, was tired- of
hearing him called the Just. When Aristides learned of the decision he
expressed the hope that Athens would never have occasion to remember
him.“</p>
<p>The historian is constrained to admit that the public men of Athens
were properly equipped with the unscrupulousness that sometimes enters
into statesmanship. As much as Alcibiades at a later age, Themistocles
was a very flame of ability; “he has a claim on our admiration quite
extraordinary</p>
<p>Themistocles and Aristides fell in love with the same girl, Stesilaus
of Ceos, and that their animosity outlived the beauty that had aroused
it.” Neverthe - less it was Themistocles whose foresight and energy
prepared for, and carried through, the victory of Salamis — the most
crucial battle in Greek history. As far back as 493 he had planned and
begun a new harbor for Athens at the Piraeus; now, in 482, he persuaded
the Athenians to forego a distribution of money due them from the
proceeds of the silver mines at Laurium, and to devote the sum to the
building of a hundred triremes. Without this fleet there could have been
no resistance to Xerxes.</p>
<p>HI. XERXES</p>
<p>Darius I died in 485, and was succeeded by Xerxes I. Both father and
son were men of ability and culture, and it would be an error to think
of</p>
<p>238 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xthe Greco-Persian War as a contest between civilization and
barbarism. When Darius, before invading Greece, sent heralds to Athens
and Sparta to demand earth and water as symbols of submission, both
cities had put the heralds to death. Troubled by portents, Sparta now
repented of this violation of international custom, and asked for two
citizens to go to Persia and surrender themselves to any punishment that
the Great King might exact in retribution. Sperthias and Bulis, both of
old and wealthy families, volunteered, made their way to Xerxes, and
offered to die in atonement for the killing of Darius’ messengers.
Xerxes, says Herodotus,” “answer ed with true greatness of soul that he
would not act like the Lacedaemonians, who, by killing the heralds, had
broken the laws which all men held in common. As he had blamed such
conduct in them, he would never be guilty of it himself.”</p>
<p>Xerxes prepared leisurely but thoroughly for the second Persian
attack upon Greece. For four years he collected troops and materials
from all the provinces of his realm; and when, in 481, he at last set
forth, his army was probably the largest ever assembled in history
before our own cen- tury. Herodotus reckoned it, without moderation, at
2,641,000 fighting men, and an equal number of engineers, slaves,
merchants, provisioners, and prostitutes; he tells us, with perhaps a
twinkle in his eye, that when Xerxes’ army drank water whole rivers ran
dry.” It was, naturally and fatally, a highly heterogeneous force. There
were Persians, Medes, Baby- lonians, Afghans, Indians, Bactrians,
Sogdians, Sacae, Assyrians, Armenians, Colchians, Scyths, Paeonians,
Mysians, Paphlagonians, Phrygians, Thra- cians, Thessalians, Locrians,
Boeotians, Aeolians, lonians, Lydians, Carians, Gilirians, Cypriotes,
Phoenicians, Syrians, Arabians, Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans, and many
more. There were footmen, cavalrymen, chariots, ele- phants, and a fleet
of transports and fighting triremes numbering, accord- ing to Herodotus,
1 207 ships in all. When Greek spies were caught in the camp, and a
general ordered their execution, Xerxes countermanded the order, spared
the men, had them conducted through his forces, and then set them free,
trusting that when they had reported to Athens and Sparta the extent of
his preparations, the remainder of Greece would hasten to
surrender.”</p>
<p>In the spring of 480 the great host reached the Hellespont, where</p>
<p>Egyptian and Phoenician engineers had built a bridge that was among
the most admired mechanical achievements of antiquity. If again we may
fol- low Herodotus, 674 ships of trireme or penteconter size were
distributed in two rows athwart the strait, each vessel facing the
current, and moored</p>
<p>CHAP.X) THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM 239</p>
<p>with a heavy anchor. Then the builders stretched cables of flax or
papyrus over each row of ships from bank to bank, bound the cables to
every ship, and made them taut with capstans on the shore. Trees were
cut and sawn into planks, and these, laid across the cables, were
fastened to them and to one another. The planks were covered with
brushwood, and this with earth, and the whole was trodden down to
resemble a road. A bulwark was erected on each side of the causeway high
enough to keep animals from taking fright at sight of the sea.“
Nevertheless many of the beasts, and</p>
<p>The army marched overland through Thrace and down into Macedonia and
Thessaly, while the Persian fleet, hugging the coasts, avoided the
storms of the Aegean by passing southward through a canal dug by forced
labor across the isthmus at Mt. Athos to the length of a mile and a
quarter. Wherever the army ate two meals, we are told, the city that fed
it was utterly ruined; Thasos spent four hundred silver talents —
approximately a million dollars — in playing host to Xerxes for a day.”
The northern Greeks, even to the Attic frontier, surrendered to fear or
bribery, and allowed their troops to be added to Xerxes’ millions. Only
Plataea and Thespiae, in the north, prepared to fight.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>SALAMIS</li>
</ol>
<p>How can we imagine, today, the terror and desperation of the south’
em Greeks at the approach of this polyglot avalanche? Resistance seemed
insane; the loyal states could not muster one tenth of Xerxes’ force. Fo
r once Athens and Sparta worked together with single mind and heart.
Delegates were sped to every city in the Peloponnesus to beg for troops
or supphes; most of the states co-operated; Argos refused, and never
lived down her disgrace. Athens fitted out a fleet that sailed north to
meet the Persian armada, and Sparta dispatched a small force under King
Leonidas to halt Xerxes for a while at Thermopylae. The two navies met
at Arte- misium, off the northern coast of Euboea. When the Greek
admirals saw the overwhelming number of the enemy’s vessels they were of
a mind to ■ withdraw. The Euboeans, fearing a descent of the Persians
upon their</p>
<p>240 the life of GREECE (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xshores, sent to Themistocles, commander of the Athenian contingent,
a bribe of thirty talents (80,000) on condition that he persuade the
Greek leaders to fight; he succeeded by sharing the bribe.“ With
characteristic</p>
<p>Meanwhile Leonidas, despite the most heroic resistance in history,
had been overwhelmed at the “Hot Gates,” not so much by the bravery of
the Persians as by the treachery of Hellenes. Certain Greeks from
Trachis not only betrayed to Xerxes the secret of the indirect route
over the moun-</p>
<p>tains, but led the Persian force by that approach to attack the
Spartans in the rear. Leonidas and his three hundred elders (for he had
chosen only fathers of sons to go with him, lest any Spartan family
should be extin- guished) died almost to the last man. Of the two
Spartan survivors one fell at Plataea, the other hanged himself for
shame.“ The Greek historians assure us that the Persians lost 20,0 00,
the Greeks 300.“ Over the tomb of the latter heroes was placed the most
famous of Greek epitaphs: “Go, stranger, and tell the Lacedaemonians
that we lie here in obedience to their laws.””*</p>
<p>When the Athenians learned that no barrier now remained between
Athens and the Persians, proclamation was made that every Athenian
should save his family as best he could. Some fled to Aegina, some to
Salamis, some to Troezen; some of the men were enlisted to fill up the
crews of the fleet that was returning from Artemisium. Plutarch paints”
a touching picture of how the tame animals of the city followed their
masters to the shore, and howled when the overladen vessels drew off
without them; one dog, be- longing to Pericles’ father, Xanthippus,
leaped into the sea and swam alongside his ship to Salamis, where it
died of exhaustion.” We may judge of the excitement and passion of those
days when we learn that an Athenian who, in the Assembly, advised
surrender, was killed there and then, and</p>
<p>CHAP.X) THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM 241</p>
<p>that a crowd of women went to his house and stoned his wife and
children to death.“ When Xerxes arrived he found the city almost
deserted, and gave it over to pillage and fire.</p>
<p>Soon afterward the Persian fleet, twelve hundred strong, entered the
Bay of Salamis. Against it were ranged three hundred Greek triremes,
still under divided command. The majority of the admirals were op- posed
to risking an engagement. Resolved to force action upon the Greeks,
Themistocles resorted to a stratagem that would have cost him his life
had the Persians won. He sent a trusted slave to Xerxes to tell him that
the Greeks were intending to sail away during the night, and that the
Per- sians could prevent this only by surrounding the Greek fleet.
Xerxes ac- cepted the advice, and on the next morning, with every escape
blocked, the Greeks were compelled to give fight. Xerxes, seated in
state at the foot of Mt. Aegaleus, on the Attic shore across from
Salamis, watched the action, and noted the names of those of his men who
fought with especial bravery. The superior tactics and seamanship of the
Hellenes, and the confusion of tongues, minds, and superfluous ships
among the Orientals, finally decided the issue in favor of Greece.
According to Diodorus the invaders lost two hundred vessels, the
defenders forty; but we do not have the Persian side of the story. Few
of the Greeks, even from the lost ships, died; for being all excellent
swimmers, they swam to land when their boats foundered.“ The remnant of
the Persian fleet fled to the Hellespont, and the subtle Themistocles
sent his slave again to Xerxes to say that he had dissuaded the Greeks
from pursuit. Xerxes left 300,000 men under command of Mar- donius, and
with the rest of his troops marched back in humiliation to Sardis, a
large part of his force dying of pestilence and dysentery on the
way.</p>
<p>In the same year as Salamis — possibly, as the Greeks would have it,
on the same day (September 23, 480 b.c.) — the Greeks of Sicily fought
the Car- thaginians at Himera. We do not know that the Phoenicians of
Africa were acting in concert with those who supported Xerxes and so
largely manned his fleet; perhaps it was only a coincidence that Greece
found itself as- saulted in east and west at once.“ In the traditional
account Hamilcar, the Carthaginian admiral, arrived at Panormus with
3000 ships and 300,000 troops; he proceeded thence to lay siege to
Himera, where he was met by Gelon of Syracuse with 55,000 men. After the
fashion of Punic generals, Hamilcar stood aside from the battle, and
burned sacrificial victims to his gods as the contest raged; when his
defeat became evident he threw him-</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xself into the fire. A tomb was erected to him on the site; and there
his grandson Himilcon, seventy years afterwards, slaughtered 3000 Greek
cap- tives in revenge.“</p>
<p>A year later (August, 479) the liberation of Greece was completed by
almost simultaneous engagements on land and sea. Mardonius’ a rmy, liv-
ing leisurely on the country, had pitched its camp near Plataea on the
Boeotian plain. There, after two weeks of waiting for propitious omens,
a Greek force of 1 10,000 men, led by the Spartan king Pausanias, joined
issue with them in the greatest land battle of the war. The non-Persians
in the invading force had no heart for the conflict, and took to flight
as soon as the Persian contingent, which bore the point of the attack,
began to waver. The Greeks won so overwhelming a victory that (according
to their his- torians) they lost but 159 men, while of the Persian force
260,000 were slain.* On the same day, the Greeks aver, a Greek squadron
met a Persian flotilla off the coast of Mycale, the central meeting
place of all Ionia. The Persian fleet was destroyed, the Ionian cities
were freed from Persian rule, and control of the Hellespont and the
Bosporus was won by the Greeks as they had won it from Troy seven
hundred years before.</p>
<p>The Greco-Persian War was the most momentous conflict in European
history, for it made Europe possible. It won for Western civilization
the opportunity to develop its own economic life — unburdened with alien
trib- ute or taxation — and its own political institutions, free from
the dictation of Oriental kings. It won for Greece a clear road for the
first great experi- ment in liberty; it preserved the Greek mind for
three centuries from the enervating mysticism of the East, and secured
for Greek enterprise full freedom of the sea. The Athenian fleet that
remained after Salamis now opened every port in the Mediterranean to
Greek trade, and the commer- cial expansion that ensued provided the
wealth that financed the leisure and culture of Periclean Athens. The
victory of little Hellas against such odds stimulated the pride and
lifted up the spirit of its people; out of very gratitude they felt
called upon to do unprecedented things. After cen- turies of preparation
and sacrifice Greece entered upon its Golden Age.</p>
<p>•These figures from Herodotus” are pr esumably an outburst of
patriotic imagination. Plutarch, trying to be impartial, raises the
Greek loss to 1360, and Diodorus Siculus, though always generous with
numbers, lowers the Persian loss to 100,000;^ but even Plutarch and
Diodorus were Greeks.</p>
