<h4 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h4>
<p>The Triumph of the Barbarians</p>
<p>325-476</p>
<p>I. THE THREATENED FRONTIER</p>
<p>P ERSIA was but one sector of a 10,000-mile frontier through which,
at any point and at any moment, this Roman Empire of a hundred nations
might be invaded by tribes unspoiled by civilization and envious of its
fruits. The Persians in themselves were an insoluble problem. They were
growing stronger, not weaker; soon they would reconquer nearly all that
Darius I had held a thousand years before. West of them were the Arabs,
mostly pen- niless Bedouins; the wisest statesman would have smiled at
the notion that these somber nomads were destined to capture half the
Roman Empire, and all Persia too. South of the Roman provinces in Africa
were Ethiopians, Libyans, Berbers, Numidians, and Moors, who waited in
fierce patience for the crumbling of imperial defenses or morale. Spain
seemed safely Roman behind its forbidding mountains and protecting seas;
none surmised that it would become in this fourth century German, and in
the eighth Moham- medan. Gaul now surpassed Italy in Roman pride, in
order and wealth, in Latin poetry and prose; but in every generation it
had to defend itself against Teutons whose women were more fertile than
their fields. Only a small im- perial garrison could be spared to
protect Roman Britain from Scots and Piets on the west and north and
from Norse or Saxon pirates on the east or south. Norway’s shores were a
chain of pirate dens; its people found war less toilsome than tillage,
and counted the raiding of alien coasts a noble occupa- tion for hungry
stomachs or leisure days. In southern Sweden and its isles the Goths
claimed to have had their early home; possibly they were indige- nous to
the region of the Vistula; in any case they spread as Visigoths south-
ward to the Danube, and as Ostrogoths they settled between the Dniester
and the Don. In the heart of Europe — bounded by the Vistula, the
Danube, and the Rhine — moved the restless tribes that were to remake
the map, and rename the nations, of Europe: Thuringians, Burgundians,
Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Frisians, Gepidae, Quadi, Vandals, Alemanni,
Suevi, Lombards, Franks. Against these ethnic tides the Empire had no
protective wall except in Britain, but merely an occasional fort and
garrison along the roads or rivers that marked the frontier limit
(limes) of the Roman realm. The higher birth rate outside the Empire,
and the higher standard of living within it, made</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARBARIANS 23</p>
<p>immigration or invasion a manifest destiny for the Roman Empire then
as for North America today.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should modify the tradition that speaks of these German
tribes as barbarians. It is true that in calling them barbari the Greeks
and Romans meant no compliment. The word was probably brother to the
Sanskrit var- vara, which meant a rough and letterless churl; 1 it
appears again in Berber. But it was not for nothing that for five
centuries the Germans had touched Roman civilization in trade and war.
By the fourth century they had long since adopted writing and a
government of stable laws. If we except the Merovingian Franks, their
sexual morals were superior to those of the Romans and the Greeks.*
Though they lacked the civility and graces of a cultured people, they
often shamed tbe Romans by their courage, hospi- tality, and honesty.
They were cruel, but hardly more so than the Romans; they were probably
shocked to find that Roman law permitted the torturing of freemen to
extort confessions or testimony. 3 They were individualistic to the
point of chaos, while the Romans had now been tamed to sociability and
peace. In their higher ranks they showed some appreciation of literature
and art; Stilicho, Ricimer, and other Germans entered fully into the
cul- tural life of Rome, and wrote a Latin that Symmachus professed to
enjoy. 4 In general the invaders — above all, the Goths — were civilized
enough to admire Roman civilization as higher than their own, and to aim
rather at ac- quiring it than at destroying it; for two centuries they
asked little more than admission to the Empire and its unused lands; and
they shared actively in its defense. If we continue to refer to the
German tribes of the fourth and fifth centuries as barbarians, it will
be in surrender to the convenience of custom, and with these
reservations and apologies.</p>
<p>South of the Danube and the Alps the swelling tribes had already
entered the Empire by peaceable immigration, even by royal invitation.
Augustus had begun the policy of settling barbarians within the
frontier, to replenish vacant areas and legions that the infertile and
unmartial Romans no longer filled; and Aurelius, Aurelian, and Probus
had adoped the plan. By the end of the fourth century the Balkans and
eastern Gaul were predominantly Ger- man; so was the Roman army; many
high offices, political as well as military, were in Teutonic hands.
Once the Empire had Romanized such elements; now the immigrants
barbarized the Romans. 5 Romans began to wear fur coats in barbarian
style, and to let their hair flow long; some even took to trousers,
evoking outraged imperial decrees (397, 41 6). 6</p>
<p>The cue for the great invasion came from far-off Mongolian plains.

<p>24 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. II</p>
<p>Hsiung-nu, or Hiung-nu, or Huns, a division of the Turanian stock,
occu- pied in our third century the region north of Lake Balkash and the
Aral Sea. According to Jordanes, their chief weapon was their
physiognomy.</p>
<p>By the terror of their features they inspired great fear in those</p>
<p>whom perhaps they did not really surpass in war. They made their</p>
<p>foes flee in horror because their swarthy aspect was fearful, and
they had … a shapeless lump instead of a head, with pinholes rather than
eyes. They are cruel to their children on the very day of their
birth.</p>
<p>For they cut the cheeks of the males with a sword, so that before
they receive the nourishment of milk, they must learn to endure wounds.
Hence they grow old beardless, and with faces scarred by the sword.</p>
<p>They are short in stature, quick in bodily movement, alert horsemen,
ready in the use of bow and arrow, broad-shouldered, and with firm set
necks always erect in pride. 7</p>
<p>War was their industry, pasturing cattle was their recreation. “Their
country,” said a proverb, “is the back of a horse.” 8 Armed with arrows
and knives, equipped with courage and speed, driven by the exhaustion of
their lands and the pressure of their eastern enemies, they advanced
into Russia about 355, overcame and absorbed the Alani, crossed the
Volga (372?), and attacked the almost civilized Ostrogoths in the
Ukraine. Ermanaric, the cen- tenarian Ostrogothic King, fought bravely,
was defeated, and died, some said, by his own hand. Part of the
Ostrogoths surrendered and joined the Huns; part fled west into the
lands of the Visigoths north of the Danube. A Visigothic army met the
advancing Huns at the Dniester, and was over- whelmed; a remnant of the
Visigoths begged permission of the Roman au- thorities on the Danube to
cross the river and settle in Moesia and Thrace. The Emperor Valens sent
word that they should be admitted on condition that they surrender their
arms, and give up their youths as hostages. The Visigoths crossed, and
were shamelessly plundered by imperial officials and troops; their girls
and boys were enslaved by amorous Romans; but after diligent bribery the
immigrants were allowed to keep their arms. Food was sold them at famine
prices, so that hungry Goths gave ten pounds of silver, or a slave, for
a joint of meat or a loaf of bread; at last the Goths were forced to
sell their children into bondage to escape starvation.® When they showed
signs of revolt the Roman general invited their leader Fritigern to a
banquet, plotting to kill him. Fritigern escaped, and roused the
desperate Goths to war. They pillaged, burned, and killed until almost
all Thrace was laid waste by their hunger and their rage. Valens hurried
up from the East and met the Goths on the plains of Hadrianople with an
inferior force mostly composed of barbarians in the service of Rome
(378) . The result, in the words of Am- mianus, was “the most disastrous
de feat encountered by the Romans since Cannae” 594 years before. 10 The
Gothic cavalry prevailed over the Roman infantry, and from that day till
the fourteenth century the strategy and tac-</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARBARIANS 2 5</p>
<p>tics of cavalry dominated the declining art of war. Two thirds of the
Roman army perished, Valens himself was seriously wounded; the Goths set
fire to the cottage in which he had taken refuge, and the Emperor and
his attendants died in the flames. The victorious horde marched upon
Constantinople, but failed to pierce the defenses organized by Valens’
widow Dominica. The Visigoths, joined by Ostrogoths and Huns who crossed
the unprotected Danube, ravaged the Balkans at will from the Black Sea
to the borders of Italy.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE SAVIOR EMPERORS: 364-408</li>
</ol>
<p>In this crisis the Empire did not cease to produce able rulers. On
Jovian’s death the army and Senate had passed the crown to Valentinian,
a blunt and Greekless soldier recalling Vespasian. With the consent of
the Senate he had appointed his younger brother Valens as Augustus and
Emperor in the East, while he himself chose the apparently more
dangerous West. He refortified the frontiers of Italy and Gaul, built up
the army to strength and discipline, and again drove the encroaching
Germans back across the Rhine. From his capital at Milan he issued
enlightened legislation forbidding infanticide, founding colleges,
extending state medicine in Rome, reducing taxes, re- forming a debased
coinage, checking political corruption, and proclaiming freedom of creed
and worship for all. He had his faults and his weaknesses; he was
capable of cold cruelties to enemies; and if we may believe the his-
torian Socrates, he legalized bigamy to sanction his marriage with
Justina, 11 whose beauty had been too generously described to him by his
wife. Never- theless, it was a tragedy for Rome that he died so soon
(375). His son Gratian succeeded to his power in the West, lived up to
his father for a year or two, then abandoned himself to amusements and
the chase, and left the govern- ment to corrupt officials who put every
office and judgment up for sale. The general Maximus overthrew him and
invaded Italy in an effort to displace Gratian’s successor and half
brother Valentin ian II; but the new Emperor of the East, Theodosius I
the Great, marched westward, defeated the usurper, and set the young
Valentinian firmly on his Milan throne (388) .</p>
<p>Theodosius was a Spaniard. He had distinguished himself as a general
in Spain, Britain, and Thrace; he had persuaded the victorious Goths to
join his army instead of fighting it; he had ruled the Eastern provinces
with every wisdom except tolerance; and half the world looked in awe at
his astonishing assemblage of handsome features and majestic presence,
ready anger and readier mercy, humane legislation and sternly orthodox
theology. While he was wintering at Milan a disturbance characteristic
of the times broke out in Thessalonica. The imperial governor there,
Botheric, had imprisoned for scandalous immorality a charioteer popular
with the citizens. They de- manded his release; Botheric refused; the
crowd overcame his garrison, killed</p>
<p>2 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>him and his aides, tore their bodies to pieces, and paraded the
streets display- ing the severed limbs as emblems of victory. The news
of this outburst stirred Theodosius to fury. He sent secret orders that
the entire population of Thes- salonica should be punished. The people
were invited into the hippodrome for games; hidden soldiery fell upon
them there, and massacred 7000 men, women, and children (390) . 12
Theodosius sent a second order mitigating the first, but it came too
late.</p>
<p>The Roman world was shocked by this savage retaliation, and Ambrose,
who administered with stoic Christianity the see of Milan, wrote to the
Em- peror that he, the Bishop, could not again celebrate Mass in the
imperial pres- ence until Theodosius should have atoned before all the
people for his crime. Though privately remorseful, the Emperor was
reluctant to lower the prestige of his office by so public a
humiliation. He tried to enter the cathe- dral, but Ambrose himself
barred the way. After weeks of vain efforts Theo- dosius yielded,
stripped himself of all the insignia of empire, entered the cathedral as
a humble penitent, and begged heaven to forgive his sins (390). It was
an historic triumph and defeat in the war between Church and state.</p>
<p>When Theodosius returned to Constantinople, Valentinian II, a lad of
twenty, proved inadequate to the problems that enmeshed him. His aides
de- ceived him, and took power into their venal hands; his master of the
militia, the pagan Frank, Arbogast, assumed imperial authority in Gaul;
and when Valentinian went to Vienne to assert his sovereignty he was
assassinated (392). Arbogast, inaugurating a long line of barbarian
kingmakers, raised to the throne of the West a mild and manageable
scholar. Eugenius was a Chris- tian, but so intimate with the pagan
parties in Italy that Ambrose feared him as another Julian. Theodosius
marched westward again, to restore legitimacy and orthodoxy with an army
of Goths, Alani, Caucasians, Iberians, and Huns; among its generals were
the Goth Gainas who would seize Constanti- nople, the Vandal Stilicho
who would defend Rome, and the Goth Alaric who would sack it. In a
two-day battle near Aquileia, Arbogast and Eu- genius were defeated
(394); Eugenius was surrendered by his soldiers and slain; Arbogast died
by his own hand. Theodosius summoned his eleven- year-old son Honorius
to be Emperor of the West, and named his eighteen- year-old son Arcadius
as co-Emperor of the East. Then, exhausted by his campaigns, he died at
Milan (395) , in the fiftieth year of his age. The Empire that he had
repeatedly united was again divided, and except briefly under Justinian
it would never be united again.</p>
<p>Theodosius’ sons were effeminate weaklings nursed in an enfeebling se
- curity. Though their morals were almost as excellent as their
intentions, they were not made to be pilots in a storm; they soon lost
hold of affairs, and sur- rendered administration and policy to their
ministers: in the East to the cor- rupt and avaricious Rufinus, in the
West to the able but unscrupulous Stilicho. In 398 this noble Vandal
arranged the marriage of his daughter</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARBARIANS 27</p>
<p>Maria to Honorius, hoping to be the grandfather as well as the
father-in-law of an emperor. But Honorius proved to be as free of
passion as of intellect; he spent his time feeding the imperial poultry
with tender affection, and Maria died a virgin after having been for ten
years a wife. 13</p>
<p>Theodosius had kept the Goths at peace by employing them in war, and
by paying them an annual subsidy as allies. His successor refused to
continue this subsidy, and Stilicho dismissed his Gothic troops. The
idle warriors craved money and adventure, and their new leader, Alaric,
provided both with a skill that outplayed the Romans in diplomacy as
well as war. Why, he asked his followers, should the proud and virile
Goth submit to be a hireling of effete Romans or Greeks, instead of
using his courage and his arms to cut out from the dying Empire a
kingdom of his own? In the very year of Theo- dosius’ deat h, Alaric led
almost the whole mass of Thracian Goths into Greece, marched unhindered
through the pass of Thermopylae, massacred en route all men of military
age, enslaved the women, ravaged the Pelopon- nesus, destroyed the
temple of Demeter at Eleusis, and spared Athens only on receiving a
ransom that absorbed most of the city’s movable wealth (396). Stilicho
went to the rescue, but too late; he maneuvered the Goths into an
indefensible position, but made truce with them when a revolution in
Africa called him back to the West. Alaric signed an alliance with Arca-
dius, who allowed him to settle his Goths in Epirus. For four years the
Em- pire was at peace.</p>
<p>It was during those years that Synesius of Cyrene, half Christian
bishop and half pagan p hilosopher, in an address before Arcadius’
luxury -loving court at Constantinople, described with clarity and force
the alternatives that faced Greece and Rome. How could the Empire
survive if its citizens continued to shirk military service, and to
entrust its defense to mercenaries recruited from the very nations that
threatened it? He proposed an end to luxury and ease and the enlistment
or conscription of a citizen army aroused to fight for country and
freedom; and he called upon Arcadius and Honorius to rise and smite the
insolent barbarian hosts within the Empire, and to drive them back to
their lairs behind the Black Sea, the Danube, and the Rhine. The court
applauded Synesius’ address as an elegant oratorical exercise, and
returned to its feasts. 14 Meanwhile Alaric compelled the armorers of
Epirus to make for his Goths a full supply of pikes, swords, helmets,
and shields.</p>
<p>In 401 he invaded Italy, plundering as he came. Thousands of refugees
poured into Milan and Ravenna, and then fled to Rome; farmers took
shelter within the walled towns, while the rich gathered whatever of
their wealth they could move, and frantically sought passage to Corsica,
Sardinia, or Sicily. Stilicho denuded the provinces of their garrisons
to raise an army capable of stemming the Gothic flood; and at Pollentia,
on Easter morning of 402, he pounced upon the Goths, who had interrupted
pillage for prayer. The battle was indecisive; Alaric retreated, but
ominously toward unpro-</p>

<p>28</p>
<p>(chap, n</p>
<p>tected Rome; and only a massive bribe from Honorius persuaded him to
leave Italy.</p>
<p>The timid Emperor, on Alaric’s approach to Milan, had thought of
trans - ferring his capital to Gaul. Now he cast about for some safer
place, and found it in Ravenna, whose marshes and lagoons made it
impregnable by land, and its shoals by sea. But the new capital trembled
like the old when the barbarian Radagaisus led a host of 200,000 Alani,
Quadi, Ostrogoths, and Vandals over the Alps, and attacked the growing
city of Florentia. Stilicho once more proved his generalship, defeated
the motley horde with a rela- tively small army, and brought Radagaisus
to Honorius in chains. Italy breathed again, and the imperial court of
patricians, princesses, bishops, eunuchs, poultry, and generals resumed
its routine of luxury, corruption, and intrigue.</p>
<p>Olympius, the chancellor, envied and distrusted Stilicho; he resented
the great general’s apparent connivance at Alaric’s repeated escapes,
and thought he detected in him the secret sympathy of a German with
German invaders. He protested against the bribes that on Stilicho’s
prompting had been paid or pledged to Alaric. Honorius hesitated to
depose the man who for twenty- three years had led Rome’s armies to
victory and had saved the West; but when Olympius persuaded him that
Stilicho was plotting to put his son on the throne, the timid youth
consented to his general’s death. Olympius at once sent a squad of
soldiers to carry out the decree. Stilicho’s friends wis hed to resist;
he forbade them, and offered his neck to the sword (408) .</p>
<p>A few months later Alaric re-entered Italy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ITALIAN BACKGROUND</li>
</ol>
<p>The Western Roman Empire, toward the end of the fourth century, pre-
sented a complex picture of recovery and decline, of literary activity
and sterility, of political pomp and military decay. Gaul prospered, and
threat- ened Italian leadership in every field. Of the approximately
70,000,000 souls in the Empire, 20,000,000 or more were Gauls, hardly
6,000,000 were Ital- ians; 15 the rest were mostly Greek-speaking
Orientals; Rome itself since 100 a . d . had been ethnically an Oriental
city. Once Rome had lived on the East, as modern Europe lived on its
conquests and colonies till the middle of the twentieth century; the
legions had sucked the products and precious metals of a dozen provinces
into the mansions and coffers of the victors. Now conquest was ended and
retreat had begun. Italy was forced to depend upon its own human and
material resources; and these had been dangerously re- duced by family
limitation, famine, epidemics, taxation, waste, and war. In- dustry had
never flourished in the parasitic peninsula; now that its markets were
being lost in the East and Gaul, it could no longer support the
urban</p>

<p>population that had eked out doles by laboring in shops and homes.
The col- legia or guilds suffered from inability to sell their votes in
a monarchy where voting was rare. Internal trade fell off, highway
brigandage grew; and the once great roads, though still better than any
before the nineteenth century, were crumbling into disrepair.</p>
<p>The middle classes had been the mainstay of municipal life in Italy;
now they too were weakened by economic decline and fiscal exploitation.
Every property owner was subject to rising taxes to support an expanding
bu- reaucracy whose chief function was the collection of taxes.
Satirists com- plained that “those who live at the expense of the public
funds are more numerous than those who provide them.” 16 Corruption
consumed much of the taxes paid; a thousand laws sought to discourage,
detect, or punish the malversation of governmental revenue or property.
Many collectors over- taxed the simple, and kept the change; in
recompense they might ease the tax burdens of the rich for a
consideration . 17 The emperors labored to secure an honest collection;
Valentinian I appointed in each town a Defender of the City to protect
citizens from the chicanery of the susceptores; and Honorius remitted
the taxes of towns that were in financial straits. Nevertheless, if we
may believe Salvian, some citizens fled across the frontier to live
under barbarian kings who had not yet learned the full art of taxation;
“the agents of the Treasury seemed more terrible than the enemy.” 18
Under these con - ditions the incentives to parentage weakened, and
populations fell. Thou- sands of arable acres were left untilled,
creating an economic vacuum that conspired with the surviving wealth of
the cities to draw in the land-hungry barbarians. Many peasant
proprietors, unable to pay their taxes or to defend their homes against
invasion or robbery, turned their holdings over to richer or stronger
landlords, and became their coloni or cultivators; they bound themselves
to give the lord a proportion of their produce, labor, and time in
return for guaranteed subsistence, and protection in peace and war. Thus
Italy, which would never know full feudalism, was among the first
nations to prepare its foundations. A like process was taking form in
Egypt, Africa, and Gaul.</p>
<p>Slavery was slowly declining. In a developed civilization nothing can
equal the free man’s varying wage, salary, or profit as an economic
stimulus. Slave labor had paid only when slaves were abundant and cheap.
Their cost had risen since the legions had ceased to bring home the
human fruits of vic- tory; escape was easy for the slaves now that
government was weak; besides, slaves had to be cared for when they ailed
or aged. As the cost of slaves mounted, the owner protected his
investment in them by more considerate treatment; but the master still
had, within limits, the power of life and death over his chattels , 19
could use the law to recapture fugitive slaves, and could have his
sexual will with such of them, male or female, as pleased his ambi-
dextrous fancy. Paulinus of Pella complimented himself on the chastity
of</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>3 °</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>his youth, when “I restrained my desires . . . never accepted the
love of a free woman . . . and contented myself with that of female
slaves in my house- hold.” 20</p>
<p>The majority of the rich now lived in their country villas, shunning
the turmoil and rabble of the towns. Nevertheless, most of I taly’s
wealth was still drawn to Rome. The great city was no longer a capital,
and seldom saw an emperor, but it remained the social and intellectual
focus of the West. And here was the summit of the new Italian
aristocracy — not as of old an hereditary caste, but periodically
recruited by the emperors on the basis of landed wealth. Though the
Senate had lost some of its prestige and much of its power, the senators
lived in splendor and display. They filled with competence important
administrative posts, and provided public games out of their private
funds. Their homes were congested with servants and expen- sive
furniture; one carpet cost 00, ooo. 21 The letters of Symmachus and
Sidonius, the poetry of Claudian, reveal the fairer side of that lordly
life, the social and cultural activity, the loyal service of the state,
the genial friend- liness, the fidelity of mates, the tenderness of
parental love.</p>
<p>A priest of Marseille, in the fifth century, painted a less
attractive picture of conditions in Italy and Gaul. Salvian’s book On
the Government of God ( c . 450) addressed itself to the same problem
that generated Augustine’s City of God and Orosius’ History Against the
Pagans— How could the evils of the barbarian invasions be reconciled
with a divine and beneficent Provi- dence? These sufferings, Salvian
answered, were a just punishment for the economic exploitation,
political corruption, and moral debauchery of the Roman world. No such
ruthless oppression of poor by rich, he assures us, could be found among
the barbarians; the barbarian heart is softer than the Roman’s; and if
the poor could find vehicles they would migrate en masse to live under
barbarian rule. 22 Rich and poor, pagan and Christian within the Empire,
says our moralist, are alike sunk in a slough of immorality rarely known
in history; adultery and drunkenness are fashionable vices, virtue and
temperance are the butts of a thousand jokes, the name of Christ has
become a profane expletive among those who call Him God. 28 Contrast
with all this, says our second Tacitus, the health and vigor and bravery
of the Germans, the simple piety of their Christianity, their lenient
treatment of conquered Romans, their mutual loyalty, premarital
continence, and marital fidelity. The Vandal chieftain Gaiseric, on
capturing Christian Carthage, was shocked to find a brothel at almost
every corner; he closed these dens, and gave the prostitutes a choice
between marriage and banishment. The Roman world is degenerating
physically, has lost all moral valor, and leaves its defense to
mercenary foreigners. How should such cowards deserve to survive? The
Roman Empire, Salvian concludes, “is either dead, or drawing its last
breath,” even at the height of its luxury and games. Moritur e t ridet —
it laughs and dies. 24</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARBARIANS 31</p>
<p>It is a terrible picture, obviously exaggerated; eloquence is seldom
accu- rate. Doubtless then, as now, virtue modestly hid its head, and
yielded the front page to vice, misfortune, politics, and crime.
Augustine paints almost as dark a picture for a like moralizing end; he
complains that the churches are often emptied by the competition of
dancing girls displaying in the theaters their disencumbered charms. 25
The public games still saw the slaugh- ter of convicts and captives to
make a holiday. We surmise the lavish cruelty of such spectacles when
Symmachus writes that he spent 00,000 on one celebration, and that the
twenty-nine Saxon gladiators who were scheduled to fight in the arena
cheated him by strangling one another in compact suicide before the
games began. 26 In fourth-century Rome there were 175 holidays in the
year; ten with gladiatorial contests; sixty-four with circus perform-
ances; the rest with shows in the theaters. 27 The barbarians took
advantage of this passion for vicarious battle by attacking Carthage,
Antioch, and Trier while the people were absorbed at the amphitheater or
the circus. 28 In the year 404 a gladiatorial program celebrated at Rome
the dubious victory of Stilicho at Pollentia. Blood had begun to flow
when an Oriental monk, Telemachus, leaped from the stands into the arena
and demanded that the combats cease. The infuriated spectators stoned
him to death; but the Em- peror Honorius, moved by the scene, issued an
edict abolishing gladiatorial games.* Circus races continued till 549,
when they were ended by the ex- haustion of the city’s wealth in the
Gothic wars.</p>
<p>Culturally, Rome had not seen so busy an age since Pliny and Tacitus.
Music was the rage; Ammianus 29 complains that it had displaced
philosophy, and had “turned the libraries into tombs”; he describes
gigantic hydraulic organs, and lyres as large as chariots. Schools were
numerous; everyone, says Symmachus, had an opportunity to develop his
capacities. 30 The “universi - ties” of professors paid by the state
taught grammar, rhetoric, literature, and philosophy to students drawn
from all the Western provinces, while the en- compassing barbarians
patiently studied the arts of war. Every civilization is a fruit from
the sturdy tree of barbarism, and falls at the greatest distance from
the trunk.</p>
<p>Into this city of a million souls, about the year 365, came a Syrian
Greek of noble birth and handsome figure, Ammianus Marcellinus of
Antioch. He had been a soldier on the staff of Ursicinus in Mesopotamia
as an active partic- ipant in the wars of Constantius, Julian, and
Jovian; he had lived before he wrote. When peace came in the East he
retired to Rome, and undertook to complete Livy and Tacitus by writing
the history of the Empire from Nerva to Valens. He wrote a difficult and
involved Latin, like a German writing</p>

of Antioch; the tale may be a pious fraud.</h1>
<p>32 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. II</p>
<p>French; he had read too much Tacitus, and had too long spoken Greek.
He was a frank pagan, an admirer of Julian, a scorner of the luxury that
he ascribed to the bishops of Rome; but for all that he was generally
impartial, praised many aspects of Christianity, and condemned Julian’s
restriction of academic freedom as a fault “to be overwhelmed with
eternal silence.” 81 He was as well educated as a soldier can find time
to be. He believed in demons and theurgy, and quoted in favor of
divination its archopponent Cicero. 82 But he was, by and large, a blunt
and honest man, just to all fac- tions and men; “no wordy deceit adoi^is
my tale, but untrammeled faithful - ness to facts.” 88 He h ated
oppression, extravagance, and display, and spoke his mind about them
wherever found. He was the last of the classic historians; after him, in
the Latin world, there were only chroniclers.</p>
<p>In that same Rome whose manners seemed to Ammianus snobbish and
corrupt, Macrobius found a society of men who graced their wealth with
courtesy, culture, and philanthropy. He was primarily a scholar, loving
books and a quiet life; in 399, however, we find him serving as vicarius
, or imperial legate, in Spain. His Commentary on Cicero’s Dream of
Scipio became a popular vehicle of Neoplatonist mysticism and
philosophy. His chef- d’oeuvre, quoted by almost every historian these
last 1500 years, was the Saturnalia , or Feast of Saturn , a
“Curiosities of Literature” in which the author gathered the
heterogeneous harvest of his studious days and bookish nights. He
improved upon Aulus Gellius while poaching upon him, by putting his
material into the form of an imaginary dialogue among real men —
Praetextatus, Symmachus, Flavian, Servius, and others — gathered to
celebrate the three-day feast of the Saturnalia with good wine, good
food, and learned conversation. Disarius, a physician, is asked some
medical questions: Is a sim- ple better than a varied diet? — Why do
women rarely, and old men so regu- larly, get drunk? — “Is the nature of
women colder or hotter than that of men?” There is a discourse on the
calendar, a long analysis of Virgil’s vo - cabulary, grammar, style,
philosophy, and plagiarisms; a collection of bons mots from all ages; a
treatise on rich banquets and rare foods. In the evenings lighter
questions amuse these pundits. Why do we blush with shame and pale with
fear? — Why does baldness begin at the top of the head? — Which came
first, the chicken or the egg? ( Ovunrne prius fuerit an gallina?) 34
Here and there in the medley are some noble passages, as when the
senator Praetextatus speaks of slavery:</p>
<p>I shall value men not by their status but by their manners and
their</p>
<p>morals; these come from our character, that from chance. . . .
You</p>
<p>must seek for your friends, Evangelus, not only in the Forum or
the</p>
<p>Senate, but in your own house. Treat your slave with gentleness and
goodness, admit him to your conversation, occasionally even into</p>
<p>your intimate council. Our ancestors, removing pride from the mas-
ter and shame from the slave, called the former pater familias, the</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>CHAP.n) the triumph of the barbarians</p>
<p>latter familiaris (i.e., one of the family). Your slaves will respect
you</p>
<p>more readily than they will fear you. 35</p>
<p>It was some such circle as this that, about 394, welcomed into its
number a poet destined to sing the swan song of Rome’s magnificence.
Claudius Claudianus, like Ammianus, was born in the East, and spoke
Greek as a mother tongue; but he must have learned Latin at an early age
to write it so fluently well. After a short stay in Rome he went to
Milan, found a place on Stilicho’s staff, became unofficial poet
laureate to the Emperor Honorius, and married a lady of birth and
wealth; Claudian had an eye to the main chance, and did not propose to
be buried in Potter’s Field. He served Stilicho with melodious
panegyrics and with savagely vituperative poems against Stilicho’s
rivals. In 400 he returned to Rome, an d was gratefully acclaimed when,
in a poem “On the Consulate of Stilicho,” he wrote for the Eternal City
a eulogy worthy of Virgil himself:</p>
<p>Consul all but peer of the gods, protector of a city greater than</p>
<p>any that on earth the air encompasses, whose amplitude no eye can
measure, whose beauty no imagination can picture, whose praise no voice
can sound, who raises a golden head under the neighboring</p>
<p>stars, and with her seven hills imitates the seven regions of heaven;
mother of arms and of law, who extends her sway over all the earth, and
was the earliest cradle of justice: this is the city which, sprung</p>
<p>from humble beginnings, has stretched to either pole, and from one
small place extended its power so as to be coterminous with the
light</p>
<p>of the sun ’Tis she alone who has received the conquered into her</p>
<p>bosom, and like a mother, not an empress, protected the human race
with a common name, summoning those whom she has defeated to share her
citizenship, and drawing together distant races with bonds of affection.
To her rule of peace we owe it that the world is our</p>
<p>home, that we can live where we please, and that to visit Thule and
explore its once dreaded wilds is but a sport; thanks to her, all
and</p>
<p>sundry may drink the waters of the Rhone a nd quaff Orontes’</p>
<p>stream. Thanks to her we are all one people. 38</p>
<p>The grateful Senate raised a statue to Claudian in Trajan’s Forum “as
to the most glorious of poets,” who had united Virgil’s felicity with
Homer’s power. After further verses in honor of remunerative subjects,
Claudian turned his talents to The Rape of Proserpine, and told the old
tale with haunt- ing pictures of land and sea, and a tender note that
recalls the Greek love romances of the time. In 408 he learned that
Stilicho had been assassinated, and that many of the general’s friends
were being arrested and executed. We do not know the remainder of his
story.</p>
<p>In Rome, as in Athens and Alexandria, substantial pagan minorities
sur- vived, and 700 pagan temples were still standing at the end of the
fourth</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>century. 37 Jovian and Valentinian I do not seem to have closed the
temples opened by Julian. The Roman priests still (394) met in their
sacred colleges, the Lupercalia were celebrated with their old
half-savage rites, and the Via Sacra now and then resounded with the
prescient bellowing of oxen driven to sacrifice.</p>
<p>The most highly respected of Rome’s latter -day pagans was Vettius
Prae- textatus, leader of the pagan majority in the Senate. All men
admitted his virtues — integrity, learning, patriotism, fine family
life; some compared him to old Cato and Cincinnatus. Time remembers
better his friend Symmachus (345-410), whose letters paint so pleasant a
picture of that charming aris- tocracy which thought itself immortal on
the eve of death. Even his family seemed immortal: his grandfather had
been consul in 330, his father prefect in 364; he himself was prefect in
384, and consulin 39 1 . His son was a praetor, his grandson would be
consul in 446, his great-grandson would be consul in 485, his
great-great-grandsons would both be consuls in 522. His wealth was
immense; he had three villas near Rome, seven others in Latium, five on
the Bay of Naples, others elsewhere in Italy, s o that “he could travel
up and down the peninsula and be everywhere at home.” 38 No one is
recorded as having grudged him this wealth, for he spent it generously,
and redeemed it with a life of study, public service, blameless morals,
and a thousand acts of inconspicuous philanthropy. Christians as well as
pagans, barbarians as well as Romans, were among his faithful friends.
Perhaps he was a pagan before he was a patriot; he suspected that the
culture that he represented and en- joyed was bound up with the old
religion, and he feared that the one could not fall without the other.
Through fidelity to the ancient rites the citizen would feel himself a
link in a chain of marvelous continuity from Romulus to Valentinian, and
would learn to love a city and a civilization so bravely built^hrough a
thousand years. Not without reason his fellow citizens chose Quintus
Aurelius Symmachus as their representative in their last dramatic
struggle for their gods.</p>
<p>In 380 the Emperor Gratian, won to a passionate -orthodoxy by the
elo- quent Ambrose, proclaimed the Nicene Creed as compulsory “on all
the peoples subject to the governments of our clemency,” and denounced
as “mad and insane” the followers of other faiths. 39 In 382 he ordered
an end to payments by the imperial or municipal treasuries for pagan
ceremonies, vestal virgins, or priests; confiscated all lands belonging
to temples and priestly colleges; and bade his agents remove from the
Senate House in Rome that statue of the goddess Victory which Augustus
had placed there in 29 b.c., and before which twelve generations of
senators had taken their vows of allegiance to the emperor. A delegation
headed by Symmachus was appointed by the Senate to acquaint Gratian with
the case for Victoria; Gratian refused to receive them, and ordered
Symmachus banished from Rome (382). In 383 Gratian was killed, and the
hopeful Senate sent a deputation to his sue-</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARBARIANS 35</p>
<p>cessor. The speech of Symmachus before Valentinian II was acclaimed
as a masterpiece of eloquent pleading. It was not expedient, he argued,
to end so abruptly religious practices that had through a millennium
been associated with the stability of social order and the prestige of
the state. After all, “What does it matter by what road each man seeks
the truth? By no one road can men come to the understanding of so great
a mystery” (uno inner e non potest perveniri ad tarn grande secretum) .
40 ’</p>
<p>The young Valentinian was moved; Ambrose tells us that even the
Chris- tians in the imperial council advised the restoration of the
statue of Victory. But Ambrose, who had been absent on a diplomatic
mission for the state, overruled the council with an imperious letter to
the Emperor. He took up one by one the arguments of Symmachus, and
countered them with charac- teristic force. In effect he threatened to
excommunicate the ruler if the plea should be granted. “You may enter
the churches, but you will find no priest there to receive you, or you
will find them there to forbid you entrance.” 41 Valentinian denied the
Senate’s appeal.</p>
<p>The pagans of Italy made a last effort in 393, risking all on
revolution. The half-pagan Emperor Eugenius, refused recognition by
Theodosius, and hop- ing to enlist the pagans of the West in his
defense, restored the statue of Victory, and boasted that after
defeating Theodosius he would stable his horses in Christian basilicas.
Nicomachus Flavianus, son-in-law of Symma- chus, led an army to support
Eugenius, shared in the defeat, and killed him- self. Theodosius marched
into Rome, and compelled the Senate to decree the abolition of paganism
in all its forms (394). When Alaric sacked Rome the pagans saw in the
humiliation of the once lordly city the anger of their neglected gods.
The war of the faiths broke the unity and morale of the people, and when
the torrent of invasion reached them they could only meet it with mutual
curses and divided prayers.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE BARBARIAN FLOOD</li>
</ol>
<p>As a postscript to the assassination of Stilicho, Olympius ordered
the slaughter of thousands of Stilicho’s followers, including the
leaders of his barbarian legions. Alaric, who had awaited his
opportunity behind the Alps, seized it now. He complained that the 4000
pounds of gold that the Romans had promised him had not been paid; in
return for this payment he pledged the noblest Gothic youth as hostages
for his future loyalty. When Honorius refused, he marched over the Alps,
pillaged Aquileia and Cremona, won to his side 30,000 mercenaries
resentful of the slaughter of their leaders, and swept down the
Flaminian Way to the very walls of Rome (408). No one resisted him
except a solitary monk who denounced him as a robber; Alaric bemused him
by declaring that God Himself had commanded the invasion.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>3&lt;S</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>The frightened Senate, as in Hannibal’s day, was stampeded into
barbarism; it suspected Stilicho’s widow as an accomplice of Alaric, and
put her to death. Alaric responded by cutting off every avenue by which
food could enter the capital. Soon the populace began to starve; men
killed men, and women their children, to eat them. A delegation was sent
to Alaric, asking terms. They warned him that a million Romans were
ready to resist; he laughed, and answered, “The thicker the hay, the
more easily it is mowed.” Relenting, he consented to withdraw on
receiving all the gold and silver and valuable movable property in the
city. “What will then be left to us?” the envoys asked. “Your lives,”
was the scornful reply. Rome chose further resistance, but starvation
compelled a new offer of surrender. Alaric accepted 5000 pounds of gold,
30,000 pounds of silver, 4000 silk tunics, 3000 skins, 3000 pounds of
pepper.</p>
<p>Meanwhile an incalculable number of barbarian slaves, escaping from
their Roman masters, entered th’e service of Alaric. As if in
compensation, a Gothic leader, Sarus, deserted Alaric for Honorius, took
with him a consid- erable force of Goths, and attacked the main
barbarian army. Alaric, holding this to be a violation of the truce that
had been signed, again besieged Rome. A slave opened the gates; the
Goths poured in, and for the first time in 800 years the great city was
taken by an enemy (410). For three days Rome was subjected to a
discriminate pillage that left the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul
untouched, and spared the refugees who sought sanctuary in them. But the
Huns and slaves in the army of 40,000 men could not be controlled. Hun-
dreds of rich men were slaughtered, their women were raped and killed;
it was found almost impossible to bury all the corpses that littered the
streets. Thousands of prisoners were taken, among them Honorius’ half
sister Galla Placidia. Gold and silver were seized wherever found; works
of art were melted down for the precious metals they contained; and many
masterpieces of sculpture and pottery were joyously destroyed by former
slaves who could not forgive the poverty and toil that had generated
this beauty and wealth. Alaric restored discipline, and led his troops
southward to conquer Sicily; but in that same year he was stricken with
fever, and died at Cosenza. Slaves diverted the flow of the river
Busento to bare a secure and spacious grave for him; the stream was then
brought back to its course; and to conceal the spot the slaves who had
performed these labors were slain. 42</p>
<p>Ataulf (Adolf), Alaric’s brother -in-law, was chosen to succeed him
as king. He agreed to withdraw his army from Italy on condition that he
should be given Placidia in marriage, and that his Visigoths, as
foederati of Rome, should receive southern Gaul, including Narbonne,
Toulouse, and Bordeaux, for their self-governed realm. Honorius refused
the marriage; Placidia consented. The Gothic chieftain proclaimed that
his ambition was not to destroy the Roman Empire but to preserve and
strengthen it. He marched his army out of Italy, and by a judicious
mixture of diplomacy and</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARBARIANS 37</p>
<p>force founded the Visigothic kingdom of Gaul, theoretically subject
to the Empire, and with its capital at Toulouse (414). A year later he
was assas- sinated. Placidia, who loved him, wished to remain a
perpetual widow, but was awarded by Honorius to the general Constantius.
After the death of Constantius (421) and Honorius (423), Placidia became
regent for her son Valentinian III, and for twenty-five years ruled the
Empire of the West with no discredit to her sex.</p>
<p>Even in Tacitus’ days the Vandals were a numerous and powerful na
tion, possessing the central and eastern portions of modern Prussia. By
the time of Constantine they had moved southward into Hungary. Their
armies having suffered an overwhelming defeat at the hands of the
Visigoths, the remain- ing Vandals asked permission to cross the Danube
and enter the Empire. Constantine consented, and for seventy years they
increased and multiplied in Pannonia.The successes of Alaric stirred
their imagination; the withdrawal of legions from beyond the Alps to
defend Italy left the rich West invitingly open; and in 406 great masses
of Vandals, Alani, and Suevi poured over the Rhine and ravaged Gaul.
They plundered Mainz, and massacred many of the inhabitants. They moved
north into Belgica, and sacked and burned the imperial city of Trier.
They bridged the Meuse and the Aisne, and pillaged Reims, Amiens, Arras,
and Tournai, almost reaching the English Channel. Turning south, they
crossed the Seine and the Loire into Aquitaine and wreaked their vandal
fury upon almost all its cities except Toulouse, which was heroically
defended by its Bishop Exuperius. They paused at the Pyre- nees, then
turned east and pillaged Narbonne. Gaul had seldom known so thorough a
devastation.</p>
<p>In 409 they entered Spain, 1 00,000 strong. There, as in Gaul and the
East, Roman rule had brought oppressive taxation and orderly administra-
tion, wealth concentrated in immense estates, a populace of slaves and
serfs and impoverished freemen; and yet, by the mere grace of stability
and law, Spain was now among the most prosperous of Roman provinces, and
Merida, Cartagena, Cordova, Seville, and Tarragona were among the
richest and most cultured cities of the Empire. Into this apparently
secure peninsula the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani descended; for two years
they plundered Spain from the Pyrenees to the Strait, and extended their
conquest even to the African coast. Honorius, unable to defend Roman
soil with Roman arms, bribed the Visigoths of southwestern Gaul to
recapture Spain for the Empire; their able King Wallia accomplished the
task in well-planned campaigns (420) ; the Suevi retreated into
northwest Spain, the Vandals southward into the Andalusia that still
bears their name; and Wallia shamed the faithlessness of Roman diplomats
by restoring Spain to the imperial power.</p>
<p>Still hungry for conquest and bread, the Vandals crossed over into
Africa (429). If we may believe Procopius 43 and Jordanes, 44 they came
by the</p>
<p>38 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. II</p>
<p>invitation of the Roman governor of Africa, Boniface, who wished
their aid against his rival Aetius, successor to Stilicho; the story is
of uncertain au- thority. In any case the Vandal king was quite capable
of originating the plan. Gaiseric was the proud bastard son of a slave,
lame but strong, ascetic in regimen, undaunted in conflict, furious in
anger, cruel in enmity, but with an unbeaten genius for both negotiation
and war. Arrived in Africa, his 80,000 Vandal and Alani warriors, women,
and children were joined by the savage Moors, long resentful of Roman
domination, and the Donatist heretics, who had been persecuted by the
orthodox Christians, and now welcomed a new rule. Out of a population of
some 8,000,000 souls in Roman North Africa, Boniface could muster only a
negligible number to help his small regular army; overwhelmingly
defeated by Gaiseric’s horde, he retreated to Hippo, where the aged
St. Augustine aroused the population to heroic re- sistance. For
fourteen months the city stood siege (430-1); Gaiseric then withdrew to
meet another Roman force, and so overwhelmed it that Valen- tinian’s
ambassador signed a truce recognizing the Vandal conquest in Africa.
Gaiseric observed the truce until the Romans were off their guard; then
he pounced upon rich Carthage and took it without a blow (439). The
nobles and the Catholic clergy were dispossessed of their property, and
were ban- ished or enserfed; lay and ecclesiastical property was seized
wherever found, and torture was not spared to discover its hiding place.
45</p>
<p>Gaiseric was still young. Though a capable administrator, who
reorganized Africa into a lucrative state, he was happiest when engaged
in war. Building a great fleet, he ravaged with it the coasts of Spain,
Italy, and Greece. No one could tell where his cavalry-laden ships would
land next; never in Roman history had such unhindered piracy prevailed
in the western Mediterranean. At last the Emperor, as the price of the
African corn on which Ravenna as well as Rome lived, made peace with the
barbarian king, and even pledged him an imperial daughter in marriage.
Rome, soon to be destroyed, continued to laugh and play.</p>
<p>Three quarters of a century had passed since the Huns had
precipitated the barbarian invasions by crossing the Volga. Their
further movement west- ward had been a slow migration, less like the
conquest of Alaric and Gaiseric than like the spread of colonists across
the American continent. Gradually they had settled down in and near
Hungary and h.ad brought under their rule many of the German tribes.</p>
<p>About the year 433 the Hun king Rua died, and left his throne to his
nephews Bleda and Attila. Bleda was slain — some said by Attila — about
444, and Attila (i.e., in Gothic, “Little Father”) ruled divers tribes
north of the Danube from the Don to the Rhine. The Gothic historian
Jordanes describes him, we do not know how accurately:</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARBARIANS 39</p>
<p>He was a man born into the world to shake the nations, the scourge of
all lands, who in some way terrified all mankind by the rumors</p>
<p>noised abroad concerning him. He was haughty in his walk, rolling</p>
<p>his eyes hither and thither, so that the power of his proud spirit
ap-</p>
<p>peared in the movement of his body. He was indeed a lover of war,</p>
<p>yet restrained in action; mighty in counsel, gracious to
suppliants,</p>
<p>and lenient to those who were once received under his protection.</p>
<p>He was short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his
eyes were small, his beard was thin and sprinkled with gray. He had
a</p>
<p>flat nose and a swarthy complexion, revealing his origin. 46</p>
<p>He differed from the other barbarian conquerors in trusting to
cunning more than to force. He ruled by using the heathen superstitions
of his people to sanctify his majesty; his victories were prepared by
the exaggerated stories of his cruelty which perhaps he had himself
originated; at last even his Christian enemies called him the “scourge
of God,” and were so terrified by his cunning that only the Goths could
save them. He could neither read nor write, but this did not detract
from his intelligence. He was not a savage; he had a sense of honor and
justice, and often proved himself more magnani- mous than the Romans. He
lived and dressed simply, ate and drank moder- ately, and left luxury to
his inferiors, who loved to display their gold and silver utensils,
harness, and swords, and the delicate embroidery that attested the
skillful fingers of their wives. Attila had many wives, but scorned that
mixture of monogamy and debauchery which was popular in some circles of
Ravenna and Rome. His palace was a huge loghouse floored and walled with
planed planks, but adorned with elegantly carved or polished wood, and
re- inforced with carpets and skins to keep out the cold. His capital
was a large village probably on the site of the present Buda — a city
which until our century was by some Hungarians called Etzelnburg, the
City of Attila.</p>
<p>He was now (444) the most powerful man in Europe. Theodosius II of
the Eastern Empire, and Valentinian of the Western, both paid him
tribute as a bribe to peace, disguising it among their peoples as
payments for services rendered by a client king. Able to put into the
field an army of 500,000 men, Attila saw no reason why he should not
make himself master of all Europe and the Near East. In 441 his generals
and troops crossed the Danube, cap- tured Sirmium, Singidunum
(Belgrade), Naissus (Nish) andSardica (Sofia), and threatened
Constantinople itself. Theodosius II sent an army against them; it was
defeated; and the Eastern Empire won peace only by raising its yearly
tribute from 700 to 2100 pounds of gold. In 447 the Huns entered Thrace,
Thessaly, and Scythia (southern Russia), sacked seventy towns, and took
thousands into slavery. The captured women were added to the wives of
the captors, and so began generations of blood mixture that left traces
of Mongol features as far west as Bavaria. These Hun raids ruined</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>the Balkans for four centuries. The Danube ceased for a long time to
be a main avenue of commerce between East and West, and the cities on
its banks decayed.</p>
<p>Having bled the East to his heart’s content, Attila turned to the
West and found an unusual excuse for war. Honoria, sister of Valentinian
III, having been seduced by one of her chamberlains, had been banished
to Constanti- nople. Snatching at any plan for escape, she sent her ring
to Attila with an appeal for aid. The subtle King, who had his own brand
of humor, chose to interpret the ring as a proposal of marriage; he
forthwith laid claim to Honoria and to half the Western Empire as her
dowry. Valentinian’s minis - ters protested, and Attila declared war.
His real reason was that Marcian, the new Emperor of the East, had
refused to continue payment of tribute, and Valentinian had followed his
example.</p>
<p>In 45 1 Attila and half a million men marched to the Rhine, sacked
and burned Trier and Metz, and massacred their inhabitants. All Gaul was
ter- rified; here was no civilized warrior like Caesar, no Christian —
however Arian — invader like Alaric and Gaiseric; this was the awful and
hideous Hun, the flagellum del come to punish Christian and pagan alike
for the enormous distance between their professions and their lives. In
this crisis Theodoric I, aged King of the Visigoths, came to the rescue
of the Empire; he joined the Romans under Aetius, and the enormous
armies met on the Catalaunian Fields, near Troyes, in one of the
bloodiest battles of history: 162,000 men are said to have died there,
including the heroic Gothic King. The victory of the West was
indecisive; Attila retreated in good order, and the victors were too
exhausted, or too divided in policy, to pursue him. In the following
year he invaded Italy.</p>
<p>The first city to fall in his path was Aquileia; the Huns destroyed
it so completely that it never rose again. Verona and Vicenza were more
leniently treated; Pavia and Milan bought off the conqueror by
surrendering their movable wealth. The road to Rome was now open to
Attila; Aetius had too small an army to offer substantial resistance;
but Attila tarried at the Po. Valentinian III fled to Rome, and thence
sent to the Hun King a delegation composed of Pope Leo I and two
senators. No one knows what happened at the ensuing conference. Leo was
an imposing figure, and received most credit for the bloodless victory.
History only records that Attila now re- treated. Plague had broken out
in his army, food was running short, and Marcian was sending
reinforcements from the East (452).</p>
<p>Attila marched his horde back over the Alps to his Hungarian capital,
threatening to return to Italy in the next spring unless Honoria should
be sent him as his bride. Meanwhile he consoled himself by adding to his
harem a young lady named Ildico, the frail historic basis of the
Nibelungenlied’s Kriemhild. He celebrated the wedding with an unusual
indulgence in food and drink. On the morrow he was found dead in bed
beside his young wife;</p>
<p>CHAP.Il) the triumph of the barbarians 41</p>
<p>he had burst a blood vessel, and the blood in his throat had choked
him to death (45 3). 47 His realm was divided amofig his sons, who
proved incom- petent to preserve it. Jealousies broke out among them;
the subject tribes refused their allegiance to a disordered leadership;
and within a few years the empire that had threatened to subdue the
Greeks and the Romans, the Germans and the Gauls, and to put the stamp
of Asia upon the face and soul of Europe, had broken to pieces and
melted away.</p>
<p>V. THE FALL OF ROME</p>
<p>Placidia having died in 450, Valentinian III was free to err in the
first person. As Olympius had persuaded Honorius to kill Stilicho who
had stopped Alaric at Pollentia, so now Petronius Maximus persuaded
Valen- tinian to kill Aetius who had stopped Attila at Troyes.
Valentinian had no son, and resented the desire of Aetius to espouse his
son to Valentinian’s daughter Eudocia. In a mad seizure of alarm the
Emperor sent for Aetius and slew him with his own hand (454) . “Sire,”
sai d a member of his court, “you have cut off your right hand with your
left.” A few months later</p>
<p>4 *</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Chaos in Italy was now complete. A half century of invasion, famine,
and pestilence had left thousands of farms ruined, thousands of acres
untilled, not through exhaustion of the soil but through the exhaustion
of man. St. Am- brose ( c . 420) mourned the devastation and
depopulation of Bologna, Modena, Piacenza; Pope Gelasius (c. 480)
described great regions of north- ern Italy as almost denuded of the
human species; Rome itself had shrunk from 1,500,000 souls to some
300,000 in one century; 49 all the great cities of the Empire were now
in the East. The Campagna around Rome, once rich in villas and fertile
farms, had been abandoned for the &amp;curity of walled towns; the towns
themselves had been contracted to some forty acres as a means of
economically walling them for defense; and in many cases the walls were
improvised from the debris of theaters, basilicas, and temples that had
once adorned the municipal splendor of Italy. In Rome some wealth still
remained even after Gaiseric, and Rome and other Italian cities would
re- cover under Theodoric and the Lombards; but in 470 a general
impoverish- ment of fields and cities, of senators and proletarians,
depressed the spirits of a once great race to an epicurean cynicism that
doubted all gods but Priapus, a timid childlessness that shunned the
responsibilities of life, and an angry cowardice that denounced every
surrender and shirked every martial task. Through all this economic and
biological decline ran political decay: aris- tocrats who could
administer but could not rule; businessmen too absorbed in personal gain
to save the peninsula; generals who won by bribery more than they could
win by arms; and a bureaucracy ruinously expensive and irremediably
corrupt. The majestic tree had rotted in its trunk, and was ripe for a
fall.</p>
<p>The final years were a kaleidoscope of imperial mediocrities. The
Goths of Gaul proclaimed one of their generals, Avitus, emperor (455) ;
the Senate refused to confirm him, and he was transformed into a bishop.
Majorian (456-61) labored bravely to restore order, but was deposed by
his patricius or prime minister, the Visigoth Ricimer. Severus (461-5)
was an inefficient tool of Ricimer. Anthemius (467-72) was a half -pagan
philosopher, un- acceptable to the Christian West; Ricimer besieged and
captured him and had him killed. Olybrius, by grace of Ricimer, ruled
for two months (472), and surprised himself by dying a natural death.
Glycerius (473) was soon deposed, and for two years Rome was ruled by
Julius Nepos. At this junc- ture a new conglomeration of barbarians
swept down into Italy — Heruli, Sciri, Rugii, and other tribes that had
once acknowledged the rule of Attila. At the same time a Pannonian
general, Orestes, deposed Nepos, and estab- lished his son Romulus
(nicknamed Augustulus) on the throne (475). The new invaders demanded
from Orestes a third of Italy; when he refused they slew him, and
replaced Romulus with their general Odoacer (476). This son of Attila’s
minister Edecon was not without ability; he convened the cowed Senate,
and through it he offered to Zeno, the new Emperor of the</p>
<p>CHAP, n) the triumph of the BARBARIANS 43</p>
<p>East, sovereignty over all the Empire, provided that Odoacer might as
his patricius govern Italy. Zeno consented, and the line of Western
emperors came to an end.</p>
<p>No one appears to have seen in thi s event the “fall of Rome”; on the
con - trary, it seemed to be a blessed unification of the Empire, as
formerly under Constantine. The Roman Senate saw the matter so, and
raised a statue to Zeno in Rome. The Germanization of the Italian army,
government, and peasantry, and the natural multiplication of the Germans
in Italy, had proceeded so long that the political consequences seemed
to be negligible shifts on the surface of the national scene. Actually,
however, Odoacer ruled Italy as a king, with small regard for Zeno. In
effect the Germans had conquered Italy as Gaiseric had conquered Africa,
as the Visigoths had conquered Spain, as the Angles and Saxons were
conquering Britain, as the Franks were conquering Gaul. In the West the
great Empire was no more.</p>
<p>The results of the barbarian conquest were endless. Economically it
meant reruralization. The barbarians lived by tillage, herding, hunting,
and war, and had not yet learned the commercial complexities on which
cities thrived; with their victory the municipal character of Western
civilization ceased for seven centuries. Ethnically the migrations
brought a new mingling of racial elements — a substantial infusion of
Germanic blood into Italy, Gaul, and Spain, and of Asiatic blood into
Russia, the Balkans, and Hungary. The mixture did not mystically
reinvigorate the Italian or Gallic population. What happened was the
elimination of weak individuals and strains through war and other forms
of competition; the compulsion laid upon everyone to develop strength,
stamina, and courage, and the masculine qualities that long security had
suppressed; the renewal, by poverty, of healthier and simpler habits of
life than those which the doles and luxuries of the cities had bred.
Politically the conquest replaced a higher with a lower form of
monarchy; it augmented the authority of persons, and reduced the power
and protec- tion of laws; individualism and violence increased.
Historically, the conquest destroyed the outward form of what had
already inwardly decayed; it cleared away with regrettable brutality and
thoroughness a system of life which, with all its gifts of order,
culture, and law, had worn itself into senile debility, and had lost the
powers of regeneration and growth. A new begin- ning was now possible:
the Empire in the West faded, but the states of modern Europe were born.
A thousand years before Christ northern invaders had entered Italy,
subdued and mingled with its inhabitants, borrowed civi- lization from
them, and with them, through eight centuries, had built a new
civilization. Four hundred years after Christ the process was repeated;
the wheel of history came full turn; the beginning and the end were the
same. But the end was always a beginning.</p>
