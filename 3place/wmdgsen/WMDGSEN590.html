<p>XXThe Islamic Challenge</p>
<p>1566-1648</p>
<p>I. THE TURKS</p>
<p>AMID the internal conflicts of Christendom, political or
theological,</p>
<p>JTx. some thoughtful men were disturbed by the apparent neutrality
with which Providence looked upon the greater contest between
Christianity and Mohammedanism. That faith had been driven from Spain,
but DaruH- Islam (“the world of Islam”) was still immense. It included
Indonesia and northern India; indeed, this was the age of the brilliant
Mohammedan Mogul dynasty at Delhi (1526-1707). It embraced Afghanistan,
much of Central Asia, and all of Iran, where in this period Persian art
would display its sunset glory. West of Persia the Islamic realm was the
Ottoman or Turkish Empire, then rivaled in extent only by the empire of
Spain. It kept in its grasp all the coasts of the Black Sea, controlled
the mouths of the Danube, the Dnieper, and the Dniester, and helped its
allies, the Tatar khans, to control the Crimea and the piouth of the
Don. It took in Armenia, Asia Minor, Syria, Arabia — all the Near East.
There it held the most famous cities of the ancient and medieval world:
Babylon, Nineveh, Baghdad, Damascus, Antioch, Tarsus, Smyrna (Izmir),
Nicaea (Iznik), Mecca, and Jerusalem, where by Moslem permission
Christians worshiped at the tomb of Christ. In the eastern Mediterranean
it secured the great islands of Cyprus, Rhodes, and Crete. North Africa
was overwhelmingly Moslem, from the Red Sea to the Atlantic: Egypt was
governed by pashas ap- pointed by the sultans; Tripoli, Tunisia,
Algeria, and Morocco were ruled by local Mohammedan dynasties whose
submission to the sultans varied inversely with their distance from
Constantinople. This was the age of the Saadian dynasty (1550-1668) in
Morocco, when its capital, Aiarrakech, hummed with commerce and shone
with art. In Europe the Ottoman power extended from the Bosporus through
Hellas (usually including Athens and Sparta), the Balkans, and Hungary
to within a hundred miles of Vienna; through Dalmatia to the gates of
Venice; through Bosnia</p>
<p>and Albania to just a leap across the Adriatic into papal Italy.
There, and at besieged Vienna, the great debate was not between
Protestants and Catholics, but between Christianity and Islam. Within
that Moslem cordon Christendom lived its divided life.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE 519</p>
<p>No matter how far west Islam reached, it remained Oriental.
Constanti- nople was a window on Europe, but Ottoman roots stretched too
far back into Asia to let proud Turkey ape the West. In some parts of
Islam the heat of the desert or the tropics burned out the vital
spirits; the uninhabited distances discouraged commerce; men could not
bestir themselves so acquisitively as the West Europeans; they
cultivated immobility and were more readily content. The unchanging
crafts of Islam were exquisite, but required time and taste and did not
lend themselves to large-scale industry. The caravans were patient, but
they could not compete with the com- mercial fleets of Portugal, Spain,
England, and the Netherlands, which used all-water routes to India;
however, some ports on the Mediterranean, like Smyrna, prospered from
the transfer of goods between ships and caravans. The Mohammedan
religion inspired men to hopeful bravery in war, but to an enervating
fatalism in peace; it lulled them with dervish dances and mystic dreams;
and though it had in its youth allowed great science, it had now
frightened philosophy into a scholasticism of barren pedantry. The ulema
— the scholar-theologians who wrote the laws on the basis of the Koran —
formed the children in faithful orthodoxy, and saw to it that no Age of
Reason should raise its head in Islam. There the conflict between
religion and philosophy gave religion a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Moreover, that religion made easy conquests in lands won from Chris-
tendom. In Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria the East-
ern Christian Church still had patriarchs, but the Christian population
was rapidly diminishing. In Asia Minor the Armenians and in Egypt the
Copts remained Christian, but generally in Asia, Africa, and the Balkans
the masses had gone over to Mohammedanism. Probably the reasons were
prac- tical: if they remained Christian they were excluded from public
office, they paid a substantial tax in lieu of military service, and of
every ten children they had to surrender a son to be reared as a Moslem
Janissary for the army or the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Otherwise the Christians in Islam enjoyed a religious toleration such
as no Christian ruler would have dreamed of according to Mohammedans in
Christian states. At Smyrna, for example, the Moslems had fifteen
mosques, the Christians seven churches, the Jews seven synagogues.^ In
Turkey and the Balkans the Greek Orthodox Church was protected by
Turkish authori- ties from any molestation in their worship.^ Pepys
thought that most of Hungary yielded to the Turks because it had more
religious liberty under Ottoman rule than under the Catholic emperors.®
This was certainly true of heterodox Christians. “The Calvinists of
Hungary and Transylvania, and the Unitarians of the latter countr y,”
reported Sir Thomas Arnold, “preferred to submit to the Turks rather
than fall into the hands of the fanatical House of Hapsburg,” and “the
Protestants of Silesia looked with</p>
<p>520</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXlonging upon Turkey, and would gladly have purchased religious
freedom at the price of submission to Muslim nile.”^ More striking still
is the judg - ment of the leading Christian authority on the history of
modem Greece;</p>
<p>Many Greeks of high talent and moral character were so sensible</p>
<p>of the superiority of the Mohammedans that, even when they escaped
being drafted into the sultan’s household as tribute children, they vol
- untarily embraced the faith of Mahomet. The moral superiority of</p>
<p>Ottoman society must be allowed to have had as much weight in</p>
<p>causing these conversions … as the personal ambition of
individuals.®</p>
<p>This “moral superiority” of the seventeenth -century Ottomans is
difficult to assess. Tavernier, who traveled and traded in Moslem lands
in 1631-33, 1638- 43, and later, reported, “Turkey is full of thieves,
that keep in troops together, and waylay merchants on the road.”® The
Turks were known for their calm benevolence, but the same religion that
tamed their unsocial impulses in pea ce released them violently in war
with “infidels.” The en - slavement of captured Christians was
sanctioned, and there were slave- capturing raids by Turks on Christian
lands near Ottoman frontiers;’^ how- ever, in number and cruelty the
Turkish trade in slaves lagged far behind the Christian slave raids in
Negro Africa. Sexual indulgence was apparently more abundant and
enervating in Islam than in Christendom, though it was usually kept
within the orderly limits of polygamy. Turkish society was almost
exclusively male, and since there was no permitted association of men
with women outside the home, the Moslems found companionship in
homosexual relationships, platonic or physical. Lesbianism flourished in
the zenana.®</p>
<p>Among a large minority there was an active though circumscribed in-
tellectual life. Literacy was probably higher in European Turkey, in the
seventeenth century, than in Christendom. We may judge the abundance of
the literature from a bibliography that Hajji Khalfah compiled (1648) of
over 25,000 books in the Arabic, Turkish, and Persian languages. Hun-
dreds of volumes were available on theology, jurisprudence, science,
medi- cine, rhetoric, biography, and history.® Prominent among the
historians was Ahmed ibn Muhammad, whose History of the Mohammedan
Dynasties of Spain has often buttressed our story; we have known him
chiefly as al- Maqqari, so named from his native village in Algeria.
Most of his book is made up of passages transcribed or abridged from
earlier narratives, yet it is a remarkable production for its time,
giving an account not merely of politics and war, but of morals, law,
women, music, literature, and medicine, and bringing the record to life
with vivid details and humanizing anec- dotes.</p>
<p>Nearly every literate Turk wrote poetry, and (as in Japan) the
rulers</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE</p>
<p>competed zealously in the game. Mehmet Suleiman Oglou, more melodi-
ously known as Fuzuli, composed the finest love lyrics of the age; they
sound silly in the poor translation available in En^ish, but we catch
his meaning — that the young women of Baghdad were warm and soft and
smooth to the touch, timid and tender till yoked. Mahmud Abdu’l Baqi
(d. 1600), greatest of Ottoman lyric poets, after being the favorite
singer of Suleiman the Magnificent, continued to warble for thirty-four
years after his patron’s death. Nefi of Erzurum (d. 1635) wrote satires
with a sting, one of which must have reached Allah, for while Murad IV
was reading it a thunderbolt fell at the royal feet; so the Sultan tore
up the volume and banished the poet from Constantinople. He was soon
recalled; but another satire pricked Vizier Beyram Pasha, who had him
beheaded.^</p>
<p>Ottoman art still produced masterpieces. The Mosque of Ahmed I rose
in 1610 to dominate the capital with its six soaring minarets, its
succession of swelling domes, the massive fluted columns of its
interior, its mosaic arches, lordly script, and shining ornament. Five
years later Ahmed dedi- cated to his favorite wife the lovely
Yeni-Valide-Jamissi Mosque. Two majestic mosques were added to Damascus
in this period; and in Adrianople the unrivaled architect Sinan, who had
designed the Mosque of Suleiman, built for Selim II a temple that some
rank higher than any in Constan- tinople.</p>
<p>No civilization has surpassed Islam in the making of artistic tiles.
See, for example, those in the Mosque of Ahmed I, or, still more
beautiful, those that adorn the entrance to the mausoleum of Selim II,
near St. Sophia’s: bouquets of white and blue flowers in a field of
green, blue, and red sprays and foliage; living flowers could not be
fairer, and might envy this</p>
<p>permanence. In this age Iznik — where, thirteen centuries back,
Constantine had presided over the historic council that fixed the
Christian creed — ^was famous for its lustered tiles; there are
convincing samples in the Metropoli- tan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>Miniature painting in Turkey echoed that of Persia, which we shall
look at presently. Calligraphy was in so high repute (story had it that
a line of handwriting by Mir Imad was sold for a gold piece even in his
lifetime)^^ that no book was printed in Turkey before 1728. In textiles
too the Turks were pupils of the Persians, but they yielded to no others
in excellence. Turkish rugs were not quite as delicate in texture,
intricate in design, or rich in color as the Persian, but they stand
high in the history of this art. Already in the fifteenth century
Turkish rugs had won renown in the West, for we see them in the
paintings of Mantegna, and later in Pinturic- chio, Paris Bordone, and
Holbein. Many Tudor mansions were carpeted with Turkish rugs; even the
hardy Cromwell had twenty-two;^® and we find them represented in the
Gobelin tapestries illustrating the life of Louis XIV. The West was
learning that the East had arts as well as guns.</p>
<p>522</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXn. LEPANTO</p>
<p>The rulers of the West, however, had to watch the guns, for Ottoman
sultans had announced their intention of making all Europe Moslem. The
manpower and the wealth of their sprawling realm gave them the largest
and best-equipped army in Europe. The Janissaries alone numbered over
fifty thousand. Perhaps the salvation of the West, and of Christianity,
lay in the very vastness of the Ottoman Empire; distances were too great
to bring the scattered resources to a point. And the sultans, though
they con- stituted a more enduring dynasty (1288-1922) than any
Christian ruling family, were deteriorating through the opportunities of
the harem, and were delegating their government to transitory viziers
whose insecurity tempted them to cushion their fall by feathering their
nests.</p>
<p>So Selim II, who succeeded Suleiman the Magnificent in 1566, was a
dis- solute idler, whose one stroke of genius lay in entrusting both
admin- istration and policy to his able vizier, Mohammed SokoUi. The
Turkish assaults upon the Holy Roman Empire were interrupted; Emperor
Maxi- milian II bought peace with an annual tribute of thirty thousand
ducats, and Sokolli turned to nearer game. Arabia had preserved its
independence religiously, but now (1570) it was conquered for the Porte.
The Aegean Sea was still dotted with Venetian possessions hampering
Turkish fleets and trade; Lala Mustafa was sent against Cyprus with
sixty thousand men. Venice appealed to the Christian powers for help;
only the Pope and Spain responded. Pius V had not forgotten that in 1566
a Turkish fleet had threatened Ancona, the papal port and fortress on
the Adriatic. Philip II knew that the Moors of Spain, suffering under
his blows, had appealed to the Sultan for help (1569), and that their
embassy had been favorably received. The diplomatic situation was
illuminating. The Emperor would not join in war against Turkey, for he
had just signed a treaty of peace and could not honorably or safely
break it. France opposed any plan that would raise the power or prestige
of Spain, and she cultivated the friendship of the Turks as an aid
against the Emperor. England feared that a common enterprise with Philip
would leave her at the mercy of Catholic Spain in case of victory.
Venice worried lest victory bring Spanish power into the Adriatic and
end Venetian monopoly of that sea. Pius labored for a year to overcome
these hesitations; he had to consent to the use of ec- clesiastical
revenues by Venice and Spain; finally (May 20, 1571) the three powers
joined in a Holy League and prepared for war.</p>
<p>During these negotiations the Turkish attack upon Cyprus had
proceeded with great losses on both sides. Nicosia was taken after a
siege of forty-five days; twenty thousand of its inhabitants were put to
the sword. Famagusta resisted for almost a year; when it fell (August 6,
1571) its heroic defender.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE 523</p>
<p>Marcantonio Bragadino, was flayed alive, and his skin, stuffed with
straw, was sent to Constantinople as a trophy.</p>
<p>So prodded, the Holy League gathered its forces. Savoy, Florence,</p>
<p>Parma, Lucca, Ferrara, Urbino, and Venice’s old enemy, Genoa, contrib
- uted vessels and men. At Naples Don Juan of Austria received the
admiral’s flag in solemn ceremony from Cardinal de Granvelle. On
September i6, after the sailors and soldiers had been given the
Eucharist by the Jesuits and Capuchins who were attached to the
expedition, the armada sailed from Messina past the toe and heel of
Italy across the Strait of Otranto to the island of Corfu. Here the news
came of the massacres and atrocities that had attended the fall of
Cyprus. The thirst for revenge animated the crews, and shouts of
“Vittoria! Vittoria! Viva Cristo!” rose from the</p>
<p>fleet as Don Juan gave the order to advance to battle.</p>
<p>On October 7, 1571, the armada moved through the Gulf of Patras</p>
<p>into the Gulf of Corinth. There, off the port of Lepanto, the Turkish
navy was waiting, with 222 galleys, 60 smaller vessels, 750 cannon,
34,000 soldiers, 13,000 sailors, 41,000 rowers. The Christians had 207
galleys, 6 greater Venetian galleasses mounting heavy guns, 30 smaller
vessels, 1,800 cannon, 30,000 soldiers, 12,900 sailors, 43,000 rowers.^®
The Chris- tian fleet carried a standard of Christ crucified; the
Turkish carried the Sultan’s standard, bearing the name of Allah
embroidered in gold. The right wing of the Christians gave way before
the Turks, but the left wing,</p>
<p>under the Venetians, turned sturdy resistance into disciplined
attack, and the artillery of the galleasses killed thousands of Turks.
Don Juan ordered his flagship to steer straight for that of the Ottoman
admiral, Muesinade Ali. When they met, the Don’s 300 Spanish veterans
boarded the Turkish galley; a Capuchin monk led them to the assault,
waving a crucifix aloft; the battle was decided when the vessel was
captured, and All’s seve red head was hoisted upon his own flagstaff The
morale of the Turks collapsed. Forty of their ships escaped, but 117
were captured and 50 others were sunk or burned. Over 8,000 Turks died
in the battle, 10,000 were taken prisoner, and most of these were
distributed as slaves among the victors. Some 12,000 Christian slaves,
rowing in the Turkish galleys, were freed. The Christians lost 12
galleys and 7,500 men killed, including members of the oldest and most
prominent families in Italy. It was unquestionably the greatest naval
battle of modern times. Cervantes, who was among the 7,500 wounded
Christians, described it as “the most memorable occasion that either
past or present ages have beheld, and which perhaps the future will
never parallel.”*^®</p>
<p>It should have been the most decisive batde in modern history, but
the</p>
<p>• Hardly a hundred miles to the northwest, near Actium on the present
Gulf of Arta, Octavian with 400 warships had snatched the mastery of the
ancient Mediterranean world from Antony and Cleopatra and their 500
men-of-war (September 2, 31 b.c.).</p>
<p>524 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXexhaustion of the rowers, the damaged condition of the victorious
fleet, and the rise of a violent storm prevented pursuit of the Turks.
Quarrels sprang up among the Christians over the distribution of the
glory and the spoils. As Spain had contributed half the ships and
expense, Venice a third, and the papacy a sixth, the booty was divided
accordingly. The Turkish prisoners were allotted in like proportion;
Philip II received 3,600 slaves in chains, and out of the Pope’s share
Don Juan was granted 174 slaves as an honorarium.^® Some Christian
leaders wished to keep as slaves the Chris- tians freed from the Turkish
galleys, but Pius V forbade it.^^</p>
<p>All Catholic Europe rejoiced when news of the triumph arrived. Venice
decked itself with garlands and art; men kissed each other when they met
in the street; Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese painted vast pictures of
the battle, and the Venetian leader, Sebastiano Veniero, was feted for
days and nights and at last was chosen doge. Rome, where, since the
departure of the armada from Messina, clergy and laity had spent hours
each day in anxious prayer, broke out in Te Deums of joy and relief; and
Pius V, organizer of victory, almost canonized Don Juan by applying to
him the words of the Gospel: “There was a man sent from God, whose name
was John” (John i, 6). Masses were s aid, fireworks were set off, salvos
of artil- lery were fired. The Pope begged the victors to assemble
another fleet; he besought the rulers of Europe to seize the opportunity
by uniting in a crusade to drive the Turks out of Europe and the Holy
Land. He appealed to the Shah of Persia and Sheik Mutahat of Arabia
Felix to join the Chris- tians in the attack upon the Ottomans.^® But
France, jealous of Spain, pro- posed to the Sultan, soon after Lepanto,
a direct alliance against Philip II.*^® Intelligence of this offer
shared with other factors in dissuading Philip from further enterprise
against the main Turkish power. He was involved in disputes with England
and in the mess that Alva was making in the Netherlands; he resented
Venetian insistence on monopolizing trade in the Adriatic, and he feared
that another victory over the Turks would rehabil- itate the crumbling
empire of Venice and strengthen her as a rival to Spain. Pius V, worn
out with victory and defeat, died on May i, 1572, and the Holy League
died with him.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>DECLINE OF THE StJLTANS</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile the Turks, with an energy that dismayed the West, built
another fleet, as great as that which had been almost destroyed. Within
• In 1536 France had obtained the first Turkish “capitulations,” and
these had been renewed in 1569. They were not surrenders but a treaty —
named from its chapters or headings {capita ) — chiefly agreeing that
French subjects in Turkish lan&lt;k should be governed and tried by
French law (“extraterritorial jurisdiction”). Turkey signed similar
capitulations with England in 1580 and with the Umted Provinces in
1613.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE 525</p>
<p>eight months after Lepanto a Turkish flotilla of 150 ships roamed the
seas looking for the Christian armada, which was too disorganized to
venture from its havens. Encouraged by all to continue the war, but
helped by none, Venice made peace with the Porte (March 7, 1573), not
only ceding Cyprus but paying the Sultan an indemnity that covered the
cost of tlie island’s conquest. The Turks had lost the battle and won
the war. How far they were from enfeeblement appears in the confident
proposal made by Sokolli to Venice (1573) that if she joined Turkey in
war against Spain, they would help her to conquer the Kingdom of Naples
as rich amends for losing Cyprus. Venice rejected the proposal as
inviting the Turkish domination of Italy and Christendom. In October Don
Juan refurbished his glory by capturing Tunis for Spain; but within a
year the Turks, now with a fleet of 250 vessels, recaptured the city,
and massacred the</p>
<p>Spaniards who had newly settled there; for good measure they raided
the coasts of Sicily. Selim II died in 1574, but Sokolli carried on the
administra- tion and the war.</p>
<p>It is a problem for philosophers that historians see a decline of
Ottoman power in the reign of Murad III (1574-95), who loved
philosophers. But he loved women too, and he begot 103 children from not
quite so many wives. His favorite wife , “Baffo” the Venetian slave,
enslaved him with her charms, mingled in affairs of state, and accepted
bribes to use her influence. Sokolli’s authority was undermined, and
when he aroused fanat - ical opposition among the populace by proposing
to build an observatory in Stamboul, he was assassinated (1579),
probably at Murad’s behest. Chaos ensued. The currency was debased; the
Janissaries mutinied against being paid in bad coin; bribery corroded
the bureaucracy; a pasha boasted that he had bribed the Sultan. Murad
abandoned himself to venery and died of debauchery.</p>
<p>“Baffo” wielded almost as much influence over her son Mohammed III
(1595-1603) as she had over his father. He began his reign in ortho- dox
fashion by murdering nineteen of his brothers as an inducement to
domestic peace; but Murad’s fertility had made this problem difficult;
many of his sons were left dangerously alive. Corruption and disorder
spread. War with Austria and Persia annulled victories with defeats.
Ahmed I (1603-17), facing the rise of Shah Abbas I as a powerful leader
in Persia, decided to concentrate Turkish forces on the eastern front.
To free them in the West he ordered his agents to sign with Austria the
Peace of Zsitva- Torok (1606), the first treaty that the proud Turks
condescended to sign outside Constantinople. Austria paid the Sultan
200,000 ducats, but was excused from any further tril)ure. Transylvania
now voluntarily accepted Ottoman suzerainty. Persia too made peace ( 1 6
1 1 ) , giving Turkey, as a war indemnity, a million pounds of silk.
Altogether this reign was marked with success and sanity, except for
continued revolts of the Janissaries.</p>

<p>XXAhmed was a man of piety and good will. He tried, and failed, to
end the rule of imperial fratricide.</p>
<p>Othman II (1617-22) proposed to discipline and reform the
Janissaries; they demurred and killed him. They forced his imbecile
brother Mustafa I to take the throne, but Mustafa was sane enough to
abdicate (1623) in favor of his twelve-year-old nephew Murad IV (162
3-40) . The Janissaries chose the grand viziers and slew them whenever
it seemed time for a change. They invaded the royal palace and compelled
Sultana Kussem to open the treasury vaults to appease them. In 1631 they
came again, pursued the young Sultan into his private apartments, and
demanded the heads of seventeen officials. One of them, Hafiz, offered
himself to the crowd as a sacrifice; they cut him to pieces. Murad, as
yet impotent, faced them with what seemed an idle threat: “So help me
God, ye men of blood, who fear not Allah, nor are ashamed before his
Prophet, a terrible vengeance shall overtake you.”^® He bided his time,
for med a corps of loyal troops, and arranged the assassination of one
after another of the men who bad led the mutinies. Further attempts at
rebellion were crushed with savage feroc- ity, and occasionally the
Sultan, like Peter the Great, shared personally in carrying out the
sentences of death. He killed all of his brothers but one, whom he
thought harmlessly imbecile. Reveling in royal authority, he decreed the
capital penalty for using tobacco, coffee, opium, or wine. Altogether,
we are told, 100,000 persons were executed in his reign, not counting
deaths in war.®^ For a moment social order and administrative integrity
were restored. Feeling now reasonably secure, Murad took the field
against the Persians, accepted himself the challenge of a Persian war-
rior to single combat, slew him, captured Baghdad (1638), and concluded
a victorious peace. When he returned to Constantinople the populace re-
ceived him with wild acclaim. A year later he died of gout brought on by
drunkenness. He was twenty-eight years old.</p>
<p>After him the Turkish decline was resumed. Ibrahim I (1640-48) had
escaped death from his brother by being, or pretending to be, feeble-
minded. Under his careless rule anarchy and corruption were renewed. He
made war on Venice and sent an expedition against Crete. The Vene- tians
blockaded the Dardanelles. The people of Constantinople began to starve.
The army revolted and strangled the Sultan. The Christian West,
recalling the story of Rome’s Praetorian Guard, concluded that Turkish
power need no longer be feared. Within thirty-five years the Turks were
again at Vienna’s gates.</p>

<p>THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE</p>
<p>527</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>SHAH ABBAS THE GREAT: I587-1629</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a boon to the Christian West that from 1577 to 1638, while
first France and then Germany were crippled by the wars of religion, the
Turks, who might have pushed their western frontier to Vienna, directed
their energies against Persia. Here too religion offered a pretext to
disguise the lust for power. The Turks, following the Sunna, or
traditional forms of Mohammedanism, denounced as heretics the Persians,
who accepted the heterodox Shi‘a, and condemned as usurpers all caliphs
since Ali, the Prophet’s son -in-law. The real casus belli, of course,
was more abdominal than theological — the desire of ruling minorities
for additional land, re- sources, and taxable population. By a series of
persistent wars the Ottoman Turks advanced to the Euphrates, the
Caucasus, and the Caspian Sea, absorbing the new Persian capital,
Tabriz, and the old Arab capital, Bagh- dad. Pedro Teixeira described
Baghdad, about 1615, as a substantial city of Arabs, Persians, Turks,
and Jews, living in twenty thousand brick houses, amid a crowded
movement of pack bullocks, camels, horses, asses, and mules; the men
cleanly dressed, “many of the women handsome, and nearly all have fine
eyes, peering over or through their veils.”“ One public official was
entirely devoted to protecting strangers.</p>
<p>East of Baghdad and the Euphrates lay the disunited states of
Iran,</p>
<p>reaching to the Caucasus and the Caspian on the northwest, to
Turkistan on the northeast, Afghanistan on the east, the Indian Ocean on
the south, the Persian Gulf on the southeast. These scattered members
waited for a unifying soul.</p>
<p>Abbas the Great was the fifth Shah, or king, of that Safavid
dynasty</p>
<p>which Ismail I had founded at Tabriz in 1502. During the long
reign</p>
<p>(1524-76) of the second Shah, Tamasp I, the new state suffered many
in- cursions by the Turks. After his death they invaded and annexed the
Persian provinces of Iraq, Luristan, and Khuzistan. Meanwhile the Uzbeks
came down from Transoxiana, captured Herat, Mashhad, and Nishapur, and
overran Persia’s eastern provinces. When Abbas, aged thirty, suc -
ceeded to the throne without a capital (1587), he made peace with the
Turks and marched eastward to meet the lesser foe. After years of war he
recaptured Herat and drove the Uzbeks from Persia. He was now eager to
face the Turks, but his army was depleted by losses, disordered by
tribal jealousies, and lacking in the latest means of inflicting
death.</p>
<p>About this time (1598) two adventurous Englishmen, Sir Anthony</p>
<p>Sherley and his younger brother Robert, arri . ed in Persia on a
trade mission from England. They brought valuable presents, military
experience, and an expert founder of cannon. With their help Shah Abbas
reorganized</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXhis army, equipped it with muskets as well as swords, and soon had
five hundred pieces of artillery. He led this new force against the
Turks, drove them from Tabriz (1603), and recovered Erivan, Shirvan, and
Kars. The Turks sent against him an avalanche of 100,000 men; Abbas,
with 60,000, defeated them (1605); Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Mosul, and
Baghdad were recovered, and Abbas ruled from the Euphrates to the
Indus.</p>
<p>Even before these arduous campaigns he had begun (1598) to build a
new capital farther removed than Tabriz from invaders, and less
desecrated with alien memories and Sunni feet. Isfahan was already two
thousand years old (though not under that name), and had 80,000
population. About a mile from this ancient city the Shah had his
engineers lay out a rectangular space as the Maidan-i-Shah, or Royal
Square, 1,674</p>
<p>540 wide, and bordered with trees. On two sides ran promenades
covered against rain and sun. On the south side rose the Masjid-i-Shah,
the Royal Mosque; on the east, the Mosque of Lutf Allah and a royal
palace; the remainder of the periphery was occupied by shops, inns, and
schools. West of the maidan ran an avenue two hundred feet wide, the
Chahar Bagh (“Four Gardens”), flanked by trees and gardens, and ado rned
with pools and fountains. On either side of this parkway were the
palaces of the ministers of state. Through the city flowed the River
Zayand, spanned by three masonry bridges; one of these, the Allah Verdi
Khan, was a picturesque structure 1,164 f®®t with a broad paved roadway
and</p>
<p>on each side arcades for pedestrians. The new town was watered and
cooled with streams, reservoirs, fountains, and cascades. The whole
design was as excellent a piece of town planning as that age anywhere
knew.<em>® When Chardin visited Isfahan in 1673 he was astonished to
find a great metropolis of administration, commerce, crafts, and arts,
with 1,500 villages surrounding it and an urban population of 300,000
souls. The city and its suburbs had 162 mosques, 48 colleges, 273 public
baths, and 1,800 cara- vanserais, or inns. Tavernier, seeing Isfahan in
1664, described it as equaling Paris in extent, but only a tenth as
populous, for every family had its own house and garden, and there were
so many trees that it seemed “rather a forest than a city.”</em>^ It is
a pleasant picture, but Tavernier adds, “There are before every door
certain troughs to receive the filth and ordure of each family, which
the peasants come daily to carry away to dung their grounds. … You shall
also meet with little holes against the walls of the houses in the open
street, where the Persians are not ashamed to squat and urinate in sight
of all the world.”*®</p>
<p>Alert to the fact that Western Europe was grateful to him for keeping
the Turks busy in the East, Shah Abbas sent Sir Anthony Sherley and
others on missions to establish relations with Christian governments,
and to open up exports of Persian silk free from Turkish intermediaries.
When</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE 529</p>
<p>European envoys came to Isfahan he housed them palatially and gave
them full religious freedom. Having captured five thousand Armenians in
his Turkish campaigns, he did not enslave them, but allowed them to
develop their own center at Julfa, near Isfahan; and he profited from
their commercial activity and finesse. There they built their own church
and decorated it with a mixture of Christian iconography and Moslem
deco- ration. Sometimes Abbas played with the idea of fusing all
religions into one and “imposing peace in heaven and on earth.”^® In a
more realistic mood he used the Shi‘a fervor of the Persians as a means
of national morale. He encouraged his people to make pilgrimages to
Mashhad as the Mecca of Persian Islam, and he himself walked the eight
hundred miles from Isfahan to Mashhad to offer his devotions and
gifts.</p>
<p>Therefore the architecture with which he made Isfahan gleam was</p>
<p>chiefly religious; like the medieval Church in the West, he would
trans- mute the pennies of the poor into temples whose grandeur, beauty,
and peace would be a pride and a possession for all. The most impressive
structure in the new capital was the Maspd-i-Shah, which Abbas built in
1611-29. The maidan is its majestic plaza and approach; the whole square
seems to lead to that embracing portal. The eye is caught first by the
flanking minarets and their lacery of overhanging turrets, from which
the muezzin proclaims the unity of God; then by the resplendent faience
that covers the portal frame, and by the inscription frieze offering
this shrine as a gift from Abbas to Allah; in Persia even the alphabet
is art. Within the arch the walls are clustered with stalactites
spangled with white flowers. Then the inner court, open to the sun; then
through further arches into the sanctuary under the great dome. One must
go outside again to study the dome, its majestic Kufic lettering, its
swelling and yet graceful form, faced with enameled tiles of blue and
green flowing in arabesques over an azure ground. Despite the enmity of
time this is “even now one of the most beautiful buildings in the
world.”®’</p>
<p>Less imposing, more delicate, is the mosque that Shah Abbas raised
(1603-18) in honor of his saintly father-in-law, the
Masjid-i-Sheikh-Lutf- Allah: an elegant portal, a sanctuary and mihrab
of exquisite faience, but, above all, an interior of incredible beauty —
arabesques, geometrical figures, flowers, and scrolls in perfect,
unified design. Here is abstract art, but with a logic and structure and
consequence that offer the mind no bewilder- ing chaos, but intelligible
order and mental peace.</p>
<p>On the east side of the maidan the Shah built an open throne under a
great arch, the Ala Kapi, or Sublime Portal; there he gave audience, or
watched the horse races or polo matches in the maidan* Behind this
gate</p>
<p>• The marble goalposts still stand in t he square. The game of polo
came to Europe from Persia.</p>

<p>XXwere the royal gardens, containing several palaces used by the Shah
for special purposes. One of these survives, much chastised by time: the
Chihil Sutun (Forty Ojlumns), an audience chamber and throne room
supported by twenty plane-tree columns faced with mirror glass, and a
long- gallery adorned with oil paintings depicting events in the life of
the Shah. The doors of the palace were of lacquered wood decorated with
garden scenes and floral scrolls; two of these doors are in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Still in place is the brilliant stucco
decoration, in gilt and colors, of the audience chamber ceiling; here
again abstract art is brought to perfec- tion in logic and design.</p>
<p>From his many palaces, and from his camp, Shah Abbas directed the
life of his expanding realm. Like most great rulers, he interested
himself in every phase of his people’s life. He built roads and bridges
and had miles of road paved with stone. He encouraged manufactures,
foreign trade, and the extraction of minerals from the soil. He built
dams, spread irrigation, brought clean water to the towns. He restored
injured cities — Mashhad, Qasvin, Tabriz, Hamadan. “He often disguised
himself,” said Tavernier, “and went about Isfahan like an ordinary
inhabitant, under pretense of buying and selling, making it his business
to discover whether merchants used false weights or measures. . . .
Finding two culprits, he had them buried alive.”®* This was the Oriental
way of establishing law: in the imperfection of surveillance and police,
severity of punishment aimed to check the natural lawlessness of men.
Probably a long career in war ac- centuated in Shah Abbas this use of
cruelty as deterrent or revenge; he killed one of his sons and blinded
another.®* Yet this same man composed poetry, financed many charities,
and supported many arts.</p>
<p>His death (1629) ended the zenith of Safavid art and rule, but the
order that his co-ordinated energy had built endured for almost another
century. Despite a succession of weak shahs, the Safavid dynasty
maintained itself till its cataclysmic collapse under the Afghan
conquest of Persia (1722-30). And even in that period of political
decline Safavid art continued to rank among the most refined products of
human taste and skill.</p>
<p>V. safavid PERSIA: 1576-1722</p>
<p>Let us look at the Safavid period from the death of Tamasp I (1576)
to its end in 1722, for this is a cultural development that cannot be
cut to fit European chronology. Several Occidental travelers have left
us illuminating accounts of Persia in this age: Pedro Teixeira, who was
there in 1600; the Jesuit Father Kiusinski, who lived in Isfahan from
1702 to 1722 and wrote a History of the Revolution of Persia, covering
the whole Safavid dynasty;</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE</p>
<p>531</p>
<p>Jean Tavernier, who described at length his travels (1631-68) in
Turkey, Persia, India, and the East Indies; and Jean Chardin, who
reported in ten volumes his stay in Persia from 1664 to 1677. Though he
encountered the simoon near the gulf, Chardin fell in love with Iran; he
preferred Isfahan to Paris in summertime, and found such “an exquisite
beauty in the air of Persia” that, he wrote, “I can neither forget it
myself, nor forbear mentioning it to everybody”; he thought that the
clear Persian sky had influenced Persian art to brilliance of luster and
color and had happily affected the Persians in body and mind.**® He
believed that the Persians had profited from their mixture with the
people of Georgia and the</p>
<p>Caucasus, whom he rated the handsomest and bravest in the world — but
not quite as handsome as a Persian horse.®^</p>
<p>This once fertile Eden, home of jeweled caliphs and melodious poets,
had been ruined by Mongol incursions, disruptions of government, the
neglect and silting of lifeblood canals, the shifting of trade routes;
and the dis- covery of an all-water passage from Western Europe to India
and China had left Persia commercially becalmed. Some trade, however,
moved down the rivers to the Persian Gulf. In 1515 the Portuguese
captured Hormuz, the leading gulf port, and they held it for a century;
but in 1622 the</p>
<p>army of Shah Abbas, aided by the ships of the English East India Com-
pany, expelled the Portuguese from Hormuz; the Shah built another
commercial depot nearby at Bandar Abbas (the Port of Abbas), and the
trade that developed there helped to finance the art and luxury of his
reign. Caravans still passed from the West to the East through Persia,
and left some wealth in the towns on their way. Teixeira described
Aleppo as a city of 26,000 homes — many of them built of well- wrought
stone, and some fit for princes — with a population of Moslems,
Christians, and Jews; it had clean and handsome public baths, and
several streets were paved with marble slabs.®*</p>
<p>Most industry was still in the handicraft stage — medieval,
painstaking, artistic, slow; but Aleppo had a silk factory, and tobacco
was grown</p>
<p>throughout the land. According to Chardin the Persians had a filter
system for smoking: they passed the smoke through water, and thereby it
was “purged of all the oily and gross qualities of the tobacco.”®®
Smoking be - came a necessity to the Persians; “they had rather go
without their dinners than their pipes.”®^ Shah Abbas was an exception;
he despised the habit and tried to cure his courtiers of it with a
trick. He had horse manure dried and substituted for tobacco in the
vessels from which they filled their pipes; he explained that this was a
costly product presented to him by the vizier of Hamadan. They smoked it
and praised it to the skies; “it smells</p>

have contributed to the</p>

<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap,</p>
<p>XXlike a thousand flowers,” vowed one guest. “Cursed be that drug,”
cried Shah Abbas, “that cannot be distinguished from the dung of
horses.”®® Any man gifted with ability and courtesy could rise to a
place in the</p>
<p>Shah’s court; there was no aristocracy of birth.®® In all classes and
sexes dress was essentially the same: a robe reaching to the knees,
tight sleeves, a broad girdle (sometimes of flowered silk) around the
waist, a silk or cotton shirt under the robe, breeches gathered at the
ankles, and a turban topping all. The women were “very richly habited,”
wrote Tavernier, and “httle otherwise than the men. . . , They wear
breeches like the men.”®^ The women lived in the privacy of the zenana,
seldom stirring from their homes, and then rarely on foot. There were
three sexes. Much of the love poetry was addressed by men to boys, and
Thomas Herbert, an Englishman at Abbas’ court, saw “Ganymede boys in
vests of gold, rich bespangled turbans, and choice sandals, their curled
hair dangling about their shoulders, with rolling eyes and vermilion
cheeks.”®®</p>
<p>Chardin noted a decrease in population in his time and ascribed it
to</p>
<p>First, the unhappy inclination which the Persians have, to commit</p>
<p>that abominable sin against nature, with both sexes.</p>
<p>Secondly, the immoderate luxury 〔sexual freedom〕 of the
country.</p>
<p>The women begin there to have children betimes, and continue fruit-
ful but a little while; and as soon as they get on the wrong side of</p>
<p>thirty they are looked upon as old and superannuated. The men like-
wise begin to visit women too young, and to such an excess, that</p>
<p>though they enjoy several, they have never the more children for</p>
<p>it. There are also a great many women who make themselves abortive,
and take remedies against growing pregnant, because 〔when〕 they</p>
<p>have been three or four months gone with child, their husbands take
to other women, holding it . . . indecency to lie with a woman so far in
her time.®®</p>
<p>Despite polygamy there were many prostitutes. Drunkenness was wide-
spread, though Mohammedan law forbade wine. Coffee shops abounded; the
plant received its European from its Arabic name, qahivah.<em>’’
Cleanliness was more common in person than in speech; bathhouses were
numerous and were sometimes artistically adorned, but there was much
profanity and obscenity.’</em>^ “Great dissemblers and flatterers,”
Tavernier called them, and they were much given to cheating, reports
Chardin, but he adds, “They are the most kind people in the world,”
tolerant and hospitable, with “the most engaging ways, the most
complying temper, the smoothest . . , tongues . . . altogether the most
civilized people of the East,”®® They were fond of music, and usually
their poets sang the poems they had composed.</p>

popularity</p>

<p>THE ISLAMIC CHALLENGE</p>
<p>533</p>
<p>at the court of the Moguls in Delhi, but none of them in this period
found a Fitzgerald to phrase them for Western ears. We learn that Urfi
of</p>
<p>Shiraz was at the top of Persian poetry in the sixteenth century; he
thought himself at least superior to Sa‘di; but which of us provincials
has ever heard of him? His verses were better liked than himself, as we
gather from the “friends” who came to enjoy his mortal illness:</p>
<p>My body hath fallen into this state, and my eloquent friends</p>
<p>stand like pulpits round my bed and pillow.</p>
<p>One draws his hand through his beard and cocks his neck,</p>
<p>saying, “O life of thy father! To whom is fortune constant?</p>
<p>One should not set one’s heart on ignoble rank and wealth;</p>
<p>where is the Empire of Jamshid and the name of Alexander?”</p>
<p>Another, with soft voice and sad speech, begins, drawing his</p>
<p>sleeve across his moist eyes:</p>
<p>“O my life! All have this road by which they must depart;</p>
<p>we are all travelers on the road, and time bears forward</p>
<p>the riders.”</p>
<p>Another, adorning his speech with smoother words, says . . .</p>
<p>“Collect thyself … let not thy heart be troubled, for I</p>
<p>will with single purpose collect thy verse and prose.</p>
<p>After copying and correcting it, I will compose an introduction</p>
<p>like a casket of pearls in support of thy claims.” . . .</p>
<p>May God . . . give me health again, and thou shalt see what</p>
<p>wrath I will pour on the heads of these miserable</p>
<p>hypocrites!^®</p>
<p>Urfi’s rival in rhyme was Sa’ib of Isfahan. He followed the fashion
of migrating to Delhi, as French and Flemish artists of that age went to
Rome. But after two years he returned to Isfahan, and became poet
laureate to Shah Abbas II (1642-66). He was something of a philosopher,
fertile in fragments of measured wisdom:</p>
<p>All this talk of infidelity and religion finally lead^ to one
place;</p>

<p>The only thing that troubles me about the Resurrection Day is
this.</p>
<p>That one will have to look again upon the faces of mankind.^^</p>
<p>If the music of Persian poetry eludes us, the enjoyment of Safavid
art is not beyond our reach, for here is a speech that all can
understand. The</p>
<p>534</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXskill, finesse, and taste that had been formed in Iran through two
thousand years now flowered in architecture, pottery, illumination,
calligraphy, woodcarving, metalwork, textiles, tapestries, and rugs,
that are among the prizes of the world’s museums today. The best
architecture of the age, as we have noted, was under Abbas I at Isfahan.
There the second of his name built the Talar Ashraf (1642); and there,
in the twilight of the</p>
<p>Safavids, Shah Husein raised the Madrasa Madar-i-Shah — ^the College
of the Mother of the Shah — which Lord Curzon rated “one of the
stateliest r uins in Persia.”^® But other cities boasted new
architectural achievements: the Madrasa-i-Khan at Shiraz, the great
mausoleum of Kwaja Rabi at Mashhad, the now ruined but still lovely
shrine of Qadam-Gah at Nisha- pur, and the Blue Mosque of Erivan.</p>
<p>Shah Abbas I founded at Isfahan an academy of painting, where
students were required, as part of their discipline, to copy famous
miniatures, in which beauty of design and delicacy of drawing
predominated over the subjects and the figures. Now — apparently under
European influence —</p>
<p>the secular painters allowed themselves to deviate from orthodox
Moham- medan custom by making miniatures in which a human figure stood
out as the major theme. Here the sequence inverted the Italian; in the
painting of the Renaissance the landscape was at first neglected, then
it became incidental background, then (perhaps as individualism declined
under the Counter Reformation) it predominated over the figures; but in
Islamic painting the human figure was at first excluded, then it was
permitted as incidental, and only in the later stages (perhaps as
individualism grew with wealth) did it predominate in the design. So in
The Falconer<em>^ a green- robed noble sports a bird on his wrist,
against a minor background of golden flowers; and in The Poet Seated in
a Garden</em>’’ every detail</p>
<p>reveals the characteristic Persian elegance. Another innovation
developed mural painting, of which we have seen an example in the Chihil
Sutun. But the great masters still devoted themselves chiefly to the
adornment of the Koran, or the illustration of literary classics like
Firdausi’s Shahnama or Sa’di’s Gulistan — which Mawlana Hasan of Baghdad
illuminated in liquid gold.</p>
<p>Supreme in the painting of this second Safavid period was
Riza-i-Abbasi, who added the Shah’s name to his own in gratitude for
royal patronage. For a generation his renown was brighter than Bihzad’s.
After him the art declined; the sensitivity of the artist and the
refinement or subtlety of his design passed into effeminate excess.
Meanwhile the Persian style, having itself felt a Chinese influence,
affected in turn the miniature painting at the court of the Moguls, and
even their architecture. Grousset thought that the Taj Mahal was “but a
new chapter in the art of Isfahan.”^®</p>
<p>Calligraphy was still a major art in Persia; Mir Imad was almost as
loved by Shah Abbas for his meticulous copies of older manuscripts as
Riza-i-Abbasi</p>

<p>for his miniatures. Books were cherished for their form as well as
their content; a beautiful binding delighted eyes and touch quite as
much as a delicate vase. Artists signed covers as proudly as paintings;
so a gold-stamped leather binding of t he early seventeenth century is
inscribed “the work of Muhammud Salih Tabrizi’V® ^ cover of papier -
mache, painted in lacquer, is signed “Ali Riza” and is dated 1713.®®
Both are temptingly beautiful.</p>
<p>In the Persian cities it is the painted tiles that, next to the
domes, or on them, strike the eye; and their age arouses wonder at the
ceramic art that could give such permanence to such brilliance. This
immortalizing of color by glazing it with fire was an old skill in
Persia; the glazed tiles of Achaemenid Susa (400 B.c.) were already
perfect in their kind. Alloys of gold, silver, copper, and other metals
were fused to make more lustrous colors, especially in ruby red and
turquoise blue; and a double firing hardened the clay and the glaze
against the bite of centuries. The Armenians probably employed Persian
potters to make the tiles in their Christian church at Julfa — as
delicate in design as a miniature. Even more beautiful are the painted
tiles in the Kevorkian Collection, ascribed to Isfahan and the second
half of the seventeenth century.®^</p>
<p>The potters continued, at Isfahan, Kashan, and elsewhere, to make
luster- ware — bottles, bowls, vases, plates, flagons, cups — painted
under glaze in varied colors on divers grounds. Mosaic faience became a
favorite material to cover the walls of mosques and palaces. Shah Abbas
imported Chinese porcelain and his potters tried to duplicate it, but
they lacked the precise soils and skills. Again under the prodding of
the ruler, attempts were made at Isfahan and Shiraz to rival Venetian
glass. The metalworkers excelled in carving and inlay- ing brass; a good

<p>Textiles were a major industry and art. Designers, weavers, and dyers
oc- cupied a large section of Isfahan and were numbered in the
thousands. Their products formed the staple of the export trade, giving
Persia a world-wide reputation for satins, velvets, taffetas,
embroideries, and silks. When Abbas wished to confer a special gift he
usually chose some masterpiece of the Persian looms; “The numbers of
garments he thus bestows is infinite,” reported Chardin.®^ The Shah and
his court were dressed, on ceremonial occasions, in silks and brocades
whose beauty seemed to Chardin unequaled by any court costumes in
Europe. “The art of dyeing,” he wrote, “seems to have been more improved
in Persia than in Europe, their colors being much more solid and bright,
and not fading so soon.”®^ The velvets of Kashan were unrivaled
anywhere; some fragments are among the trophies in the museums of
Boston, New York, San Francisco, and Washington. One of the prizes
captured by the Christian armies in the repulse of the Turks from Vienna
(1683) was a carpet of brocaded silk velvet, apparently made in Isfahan
under Shah Abbas.®^</p>
<p>Persian textiles reached their apogee in the design and weaving of
rugs, and the age of Shah Abbas saw the final glory of this art in Iran.
A carpet was almost as necessary to a Persian as his clothing. Thomas

<p>ported, in the seventeenth century: “In their houses they ha ve
little furni- ture or household stuff, except it be their carpets and
some copper works. . . . They eat on the ground, sitting on carpets
cross-legged, as do tailors. There is no man so simple but he sitteth on
a carpet better or worse; and the whol e house or room … is wholly
covered with carpets.”®® Colors ran now to deep scarlet or wine red; but
to balance this exuberance the design was restful, if only because it
carried out with satisfying logic some basic theme. This might be
geometrical, and endless were the variations that here made Euclid
beautiful. More often the design was floral, bringing to the eye, in
rich but orderly array, the favorite products of a Persian garden —
flowers in vases or loosely strewn, or flowers imagined rather than
seen, with leisurely, gracefully trailing arabesques. Sometimes the
garden itself provided the design: trees, shrubs, flower beds, and
flowing water were isciplined into geometry. Or the design was centered
around a large medallion dangling pendants to each end; or it might
display animals in frolic or the chase.</p>
<p>Then came infinite labor and patience: stretching the threads in a
vertical warp on the loom, interweaving them with the horizontal threads
of the weft, and sewing little knots of colored wool or silk into the
warp to form the “pile” and the design; there might be 1,200 knots in a
square inch, or 90,000,000 in a rug twenty-three feet square.®® Slavery
seems woven into this art, but the worker prided himself on the accuracy
and finesse of his work, transforming the chaos of his materials into an
order and harmony and hierarchy of parts in a whole. Such rugs were made
at a dozen centers in Persia, Afghanistan, and the Caucasus, to grace
palaces, mosques, and homes, and to serve as precious gifts to
potentates or friends.</p>
<p>Persian carpets and Persian illumination went through similar
develop- ments in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: they received
a Chinese influence in “cloud” and other designs, they in their turn
influenced the arts in Turkey and India, and they reached their final
peak of excellence under the Safavids. By 1790 the production of Persian
rugs was on a quan- tity basis, hurriedly designed and woven for a
larger and less exacting mar- ket, chiefly European. Even then, however,
there were some exceptional pieces unequaled in texture, color, and
design anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Such was Persia, such was Islam, in this last flowering of their
power and art — a civilization profoundly unlike ours of the West, and
at times con- temptuously hostile, denouncing us as polytheists and
materialists, laughing at our matriarchal monogamy, and sometimes coming
in avalanches to bat- ter down our gates; we could not be expected to
understand it, or admire its art, when the great debate was between
Moslem and Christian, not yet between Darwin and Christ. The competition
of the cultures is not over.</p>

<p>but for the most part it has ceased to shed blood, and they are now
free to mingle in the osmosis of mutual influence. The East takes on our
in- dustries and armaments and becomes Western, the West wearies of
wealth and war and seeks inner peace. Perhaps we shall help the East to
mitigate poverty and superstition, and the East will help us to humility
in philosophy and refinement in art. East is West and West is East, and
soon the twain will meet.</p>
