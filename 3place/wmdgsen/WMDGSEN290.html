<h4 id="chapter-vii">CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>The Persians</p>
<p>224-641</p>
<p>I. SASANIAN SOCIETY</p>
<p>B EYOND the Euphrates or the Tigris, through all the history of
Greece and Rome, lay that almost secret empire which for a thousand
years had stood off expanding Europe and Asiatic hordes, never
forgetting its Achaemenid glory, slowly recuperating from its Parthian
wars, and so proudly maintaining its unique and aristocratic culture
under its virile Sa- sanian monarchs, that it would transform the
Islamic conquest of Iran into a Persian Renaissance.</p>
<p>Iran meant more, in our third century, than Iran or Persia today. It
was by its very name the land of the “Aryans,” and included Afghanistan,
Baluchi - stan, Sogdiana, and Balkh, as well as Iraq. “Persia,”
anciently the name of the modern province of Fars, was but a
southeastern fraction of this empire; but the Greeks and Romans,
careless about “barbarians,” gave the name of a part to the whole.
Through the center of Iran, from Himalayan southeast to Cau- casian
northwest, ran a mountainous dividing barrier; to the east was an arid
lofty plateau; to the west lay the green valleys of the twin rivers,
whose peri- odic overflow ran into a labyrinth of canals, and made
Western Persia rich in wheat and dates, vines, and fruits. Between or
along the rivers, or hiding in the hills, or hugging desert oases, were
a myriad villages, a thousand towns, a hundred cities: Ecbatana, Rai,
Mosul, Istakhr (once Persepolis), Susa, Seleucia, and magnificent
Ctesiphon, seat of the Sasanian kings.</p>
<p>Ammianus describes the Persians of this period as “almo st all
slender, somewhat dark . . . with not uncomely beards, and long, shaggy
hair.” 1 The upper classes were not shaggy, nor always slender, often
handsome, proud of bearing, and of an easy grace, with a flair for
dangerous sports and splen- did dress. Men covered their heads with
turbans, their legs with baggy trou- sers, their feet with sandals or
laced boots; the rich wore coats or tunics of wool and silk, and girt
themselves with belt and sword; the poor resigned themselves to garments
of cotton, hair, or skins. The women dressed in boots and breeches,
loose shirts and cloaks and flowing robes; curled their black hair into
a coil in front, let it hang behind, and brightened it with flowers. All
classes loved color and ornament. Priests and zealous Zoroastrians
affected white cotton clothing as a symbol of purity; generals preferred
red; kings</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>THE PERSIANS</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>*37</p>
<p>distinguished themselves with red shoes, blue trousers, and a
headdress topped with an inflated ball or the head of a beast or a bird.
In Persia, as in all civilized societies, clothes made half the man, and
slightly more of the woman.</p>
<p>The typical educated Persian was Gallicanly impulsive, enthusiastic,
and mercurial; often indolent, but quickly alert; g iven to “mad and
extravagant talk . . . rather crafty than courageous, and to be feared
only at long range” 2 — which was where they kept their enemies. The
poor drank beer, but nearly all classes, including the gods, preferred
wine; the pious and thrifty Persians poured it out in religious ritual,
waited a reasonable time for the gods to come and drink, then drank the
sacred beverage themselves . 3 Persian manners, in this Sasanian period,
are described as coarser than in the Achaemenid, more refined than in
the Parthian ; 4 but the narratives of Procopius leave us with the
impression that the Persians continued to be better gentlemen than the
Greeks . 3 The ceremonies and diplomatic forms of the Persian court were
in large measure adopted by the Greek emperors; the rival sovereigns
addressed each other as “brother,” provided immunity and safe -conducts
for foreign diplomats, and exempted them from customs searches and dues
. 6 The con- ventions of European and American diplomacy may be traced
to the courts of the Persian kings.</p>
<p>“Most Persians,” Ammianus reported, “are extravagantly given to ven -
ery ,” 7 but he confesses that pederasty and prostitution were less
frequent among them than among the Greeks. Rabbi Gamaliel praised the
Persians for three qualities: “They are temperate in eating, modest in
the privy and in marital relations .” 8 Every influence was used to
stimulate marriage and the birth rate, in order that man power should
suffice in war; in this aspect Mars, not Venus, is the god of love.
Religion enjoined marriage, celebrated it with awesome rites, and taught
that fertility strengthened Ormuzd, the god of light, in his cosmic
conflict with Ahriman, the Satan of the Zoroastrian creed . 9 The head
of the household practiced ancestor worship at the family hearth, and
sought offspring to ensure his own later cult and care; if no son was
born to him he adopted one. Parents generally arranged the marriage of
their chil- dren, often with the aid of a professional matrimonial
agent; but a woman might marry against the wishes of her parents.
Dowries and marriage settle- ments financed early marriage and
parentage. Polygamy was allowed, and was recommended where the first
wife proved barren. Adultery flourished . 10 The husband might divorce
his wife for infidelity, the wife might divorce her husband for
desertion and cruelty. Concubines were permitted. Like the ancient Greek
hetairai, these concubines were free to move about in public, and to
attend the banquets of the men ; 11 but legal wives were usually kept in
private apartments in the home ; 12 this old Persian custom was
bequeathed to Islam. Persian women were exceptionally beautiful, and
perhaps men had to be guarded from them. In the Shahnama of Firdausi it
is the women who</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>I 3 8</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>yearn and take the initiative in courtship and seduction. Feminine
charms overcame masculine laws.</p>
<p>Children were reared with the help of religious belief, which seems
indis- pensable to parental authority. They amused themselves with ball
games, athletics, and chess, 13 and at an early age joined in their
elders’ pastimes— archery, horse racing, polo, and the hunt. Every
Sasanian found music nec- essary to the operations of religion, love,
and war; “music and the songs of beautiful women,” said Firdausi,
“accompanied the scene” at royal banquets and receptions; 14 lyre,
guitar, flute, pipe, horn, drum, and other instruments abounded;
tradition avers that Khosru Parvez’ favorite singer, Barbad , com- posed
360 songs, and sang them to his royal patron, one each night for a year.
15 In education, too, religion played a major part; primary schools were
situated on temple grounds, and were taught by priests. Higher education
in literature, medicine, science, and philosophy was provided in the
celebrated academy at Jund-i-Shapur in Susiana. The sons of feudal
chiefs and provin- cial satraps often lived near the king, and were
instructed with the princes of the royal family in a college attached to
the court. 16</p>
<p>Pahlavi, the Indo-European language of Parthian Persia, continued in
use. Of its literature in this age only some 600,000 words survive,
nearly all deal- ing with religion. We know that it was extensive; 17
but as the priests were its guardians and transmitters, they allowed
most of the secular material to perish. (A like process may have deluded
us as to the overwhelmingly reli- gious character of early medieval
literature in Christendom.) The Sasanian kings were enlightened patrons
of letters and philosophy — Khosru Anushir- van above all: he had Plato
and Aristotle translated into Pahlavi, had them taught at Jund-i-Shapur,
and even read them himself. During his reign many historical annals were
compiled, of which the sole survivor is the Karnamak- i-Artakhshatr, or
Deeds of Ardashir, a mixture of history and romance that served Firdausi
as the basis of his Shahnama. When Justinian closed the schools of
Athens seven of their professors fled to Persia and found refuge at
Khosr u’s court. In time they grew homesick; and in his treaty of 533
with Justinian, the “barbarian” king stipulated that the Greek sages
should be allowed to return, and be free from persecution.</p>
<p>Under this enlightened monarch the college of Jund-i-Shapur, which
had been founded in the fourth or fifth century, became “the greatest
intellectual center of the time.” 18 Students and teachers came to it
from every quarter of the world. Nestorian Christians were received
there, and brought Syriac translations of Greek works in medicine and
philosophy. Neoplatonists there planted the seeds of Sufi mysticism;
there the medical lore of India, Persia, Syria, and Greece mingled to
produce a flourishing school of therapy. 19 In Persian theory disease
resulted from contamination and impurity of one or more of the four
elements — fire, water, earth, and air; public health, said Persian
physicians and priests, required the burning of all putrefying
matter,</p>
<p>CHAP. VII ) THE PERSIANS 139</p>
<p>and individual health demanded strict obedience to the Zoroastrian
code of cleanliness. 20</p>
<p>Of Persian astronomy in this period we only know that it maintained
an orderly calendar, divided the year into twelve months of thirty days,
each month into two seven-day and two eight-day weeks, and added five
inter- calary days at the end of the year. 21 Astrology and magic were
universal; no important step was taken without reference to the status
of the constellations; and every earthly career, men believed, was
determined by the good and evil stars that fought in the sky — as angels
and demons fought in the human soul — the ancient war of Ormuzd and
Ahriman.</p>
<p>The Zoroastrian religion was restored to authority and affluence by
the Sasanian dynasty; lands and tithes were assigned to the priests;
government was founded on religion, as in Europe. An archimagus, second
only to the king in power, headed an omnipresent hereditary priestly
caste of Magi, who controlled nearly all the intellectual life of
Persia, frightened sinners and rebels with threats of hell, and kept the
Persian mind and masses in bondage for four centuries. 22 Now and then
they protected the citizen against the tax- gatherer, and the poor
against oppression. 23 The Magian organization was so rich that kings
sometimes borrowed great sums from the temple treasuries. Every
important town had a fire temple, in which a sacred flame, supposedly
inextinguishable, symbolized the god of light. Only a life of virtue and
ritual cleanliness could save the soul from Ahriman; in the battle
against that devil it was vital to have the aid of the Magi and their
magic — their divinations, incantations, sorceries, and prayers. So
helped, the soul would attain holiness and purity, pass the awful assize
of the Last Judgment, and enjoy everlasting happiness in paradise.</p>
<p>Around this official faith other religions found modest room.
Mithras, the sun god so popular with the Parthians, received a minor
worship as chief helper of Ormuzd. But the Zoroastrian priests, like the
Christians, Moslems, and Jews, made persistent apostasy from the
national creed a capital crime. When Mani ( c . 2 1 6-76) , claiming to
be a fourth divine messenger in the line of Buddha, Zoroaster, and
Jesus, announced a religion of celibacy, pacifism, and quietism, the
militant and nationalistic Magi had him crucified; and Manicheism had to
seek its main success abroad. To Judaism and Christianity, however, the
Sasanian priests and kings were generally tolerant, much as the popes
were more lenient with Jews than with heretics. A large number of Jews
found asylum in the western provinces of the Persian Empire. Christi-
anity was already established there when the Sasanians came to power; it
was tolerated until it became the official faith of Persia ’s immemorial
enemies, Greece and Rome; it was persecuted after its clergy, as at
Nisibis in 3 38, took an active part in the defense of Byzantine
territory against Shapur II, 24 and the Christians in Persia revealed
their natural hopes for a Byzantine victory. 25 In 341 Shapur ordered
the massacre of all Christians in his Empire; entire</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>villages of Christians were being slaughtered when he restricted the
proscrip- tion to priests, monks, and nuns; even so 16,000 Christians
died in a perse- cution that lasted till Shapur’s death (379). Yezdegird
I (399 -420) restored religious freedom to the Christians, and helped
them rebuild their churches. In 422 a council of Persian bishops made
the Persian Christian Church inde-</p>
<p>Within the framework of religious worship and dispute, governmental
edicts and crises, civil and foreign wars, the people impatiently
provided the sinews of state and church, tilling the soil, pasturing
flocks, practicing handi - crafts, arguing trade. Agriculture was made a
religious duty: to clear the wilderness, cultivate the earth, eradicate
pests and weeds, reclaim waste lands, harness the streams to irrigate
the land — these heroic labors, the people were told, ensured the final
victory of Ormuzd over Ahriman. Much spiritual solace was needed by the
Persian peasant, for usually he toiled as tenant for a feudal lord, and
paid from a sixth to a third of his crops in taxes and dues. About 540
the Persians took from India the art of making sugar from the cane; the
Greek Emperor Heraclius found a treasury of sugar in the royal palace at
Ctesiphon (627) ; the Arabs, conquering Persia fourteen years later,
soon learned to cultivate the plant, and introduced it into Egypt,
Sicily, Mo- rocco, and Spain, whence it spread through Europe. 26 Animal
husbandry was a Persian forte; Persian horses were second only to Arab
steeds in pedigree, spirit, beauty, and speed; every Persian loved a
horse as Rustam loved Rakush. The dog was so useful in guarding flocks
and homes that the Persians made him a sacred animal; and the Persian
cat acquired distinction universally.</p>
<p>Persian industry under the Sasanians developed from domestic to urban
forms. Guilds were numerous, and some towns had a revolutionary
proletar- iat. 27 Silk weaving was introduced from China; Sasanian silks
were sought for everywhere, and served as models for the textile art in
Byzantium, China, and Japan. Chinese merchants came to Iran to sell raw
silk and buy rugs, jewels, rouge; Armenians, Syrians, and Jews connected
Persia, Byzantium, and Rome in slow exchange. Good roads and bridges,
well patrolled, enabled state post and merchant caravans to link
Ctesiphon with all provinces; and harbors were built in the Persian Gulf
to quicken trade with India. Govern- mental regulations limited the
price of corn, medicines, and other necessaries, and prevented “comers”
and monopolies. 28 We may judge the wealth of the upper classes by the
story of the baron who, having invited a thousand guests to dinner, and
finding that he had only 500 dinner services, was able to bor- row 500
more from his neighbors. 29</p>
<p>The feudal lords, living chiefly on their rural estates, organized
the exploi- tation of land and men, and raised regiments from their
tenantry to fight the nation’s wars. They trained themselves to battle
by following the chase with passion and bravery; they served as gallant
cavalry officers, man and animal armored as in later feudal Europe; but
they fell short of the Romans in dis-</p>

<p>141</p>
<p>ciplining their troops, or in applying the latest engineering arts of
siege and defense. Above them in social caste were the great aristocrats
who ruled the provinces as satraps, or headed departments of the
government. Adminis- tration must have been reasonably competent, for
though taxation was less severe than in the Roman Empire of East or
West, the Persian treasury was often richer than that of the emperors.
Khosru Parvez had 60,000,000 in his coffers in 626, and an annual income
of $ 1 70,000,000 30 — enormous sums in terms of the purchasing power of
medieval silver and gold.</p>
<p>Law was created by the kings, their councilors, and the Magi, on the
basis of the old Avestan code; its interpretation and administration
were left to the priests. Ammianus, who fought the Persians, reckoned
their judges as “up - right men of proved experience and legal
learning.” 31 In general, Persians were known as men of their word.
Oaths in court were surrounded with all the aura of religion; violated
oaths were punished severely in law, and in hell by an endless shower of
arrows, axes, and stones. Ordeals were used to detect guilt: suspects
were invited to walk over red-hot substances, or go through fire, or eat
poisoned food. Infanticide and abortion were forbidden with heavy
penalties; pederasty was punished with death; the detected adulterer was
banished; the adulteress lost her nose and ears. Appeal could be made to
higher courts, and sentences of death could be carried out only after
review and approval by the king.</p>
<p>The king attributed his power to the gods, presented himself as their
vice- gerent, and emulated their superiority to their own decrees. He
called him- self, when time permitted, “K ing of Kings, King of the
Aryans and the non- Aryans, Sovereign of the Universe, Descendant of the
Gods”; 32 Shapur II added “Brother of the Sun and Moon, Companion of the
Stars.” Theoret - ically absolute, the Sasanian monarch usually acted
with the advice of his ministers, who composed a council of state.
Masudi, the Moslem historian, praised the “excellent administration of
the” Sasanian “kings, their well - ordered policy, their care for their
subjects, and the prosperity of their do- mains.” 33 Said Khosru
Anushirvan, according to Ibn Khaldun: “Without army, no king; without
revenues, no army; without taxes, no revenue; with- out agriculture, no
taxes; without just government, no agriculture.” 34 In nor - mal times
the monarchical office was hereditary, but might be transmitted by the
king to a younger son; in two instances the supreme power was held by
queens. When no direct heir was available, the nobles and prelates chose
a ruler, but their choice was restricted to members of the royal
family.</p>
<p>The life of the king was an exhausting round of obligations. He was
ex- pected to take fearlessly to the hunt; he moved to it in a brocaded
pavilion drawn by ten camels royally dressed; seven camels carried his
throne, one hundred bore his minstrels. Ten thousand knights might
accompany him; but if we may credit the Sasanian rock reliefs he had at
last to mount a horse, face in the first person a stag, ibex, antelope,
buffalo, tiger, lion, or some other</p>

<p>of the animals gathered in the king’s park or “paradise.” Back in his
palace, he confronted the chores of government amid a thousand
attendants and in a maze of officious ceremony. He had to dress himself
in robes heavy with jewelry, seat himself on a golden throne, and wear a
crown so burdensome that it had to be suspended an invisible distance
from his immovable head. So he received ambassadors and guests, observed
a thousand punctilios of protocol, passed judgment, received
appointments and reports. Those who approached him prostrated
themselves, kissed the ground, rose only at his bidding, and spoke to
him through a handkerchief held to their mouths, lest their breath
infect or profane the king. At night he retired to one of his wives or
concubines, and eugenically disseminated his superior seed.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SASANIAN ROYALTY</li>
</ol>
<p>Sasan, in Persian tradition, was a priest of Persepolis; his son
Papak was a petty prince of Khur; Papak killed Gozihr, ruler of the
province of Persis, made himself king of the province, and bequeathed
his power to his son Shapur; Shapur died of a timely accident, and was
succeeded by his brother Ardashir. Artabanus V, last of the Arsacid or
Parthian kings of Persia, re- fused to recognize this new local dynasty;
Ardashir overthrew Artabanus in battle (224), and became King of Kings
(226). He replaced the loose feudal rule of the Arsacids with a strong
royal power governing through a central- ized but spreading bureaucracy;
won the support of the priestly caste by restoring the Zoroastrian
hierarchy and faith; and roused the pride of the people by announcing
that he would destroy Hellenistic influence in Persia, avenge Darius II
against the heirs of Alexander, and reconquer all the ter- ritory once
held by the Achaemenid kings. He almost kept his word. His swift
campaigns extended the boundaries of Persia to the Oxus in the north-
east, and to the Euphrates in the west. Dying (241), he placed the crown
on the head of his son Shapur, and bade him drive the Greeks and Romans
into the sea.</p>
<p>Shapur or Sapor I (241-72) inherited all the vigor and craft of his
father. The rock reliefs represent him as a man of handsome and noble
features; but these reliefs were doubtless stylized compliments. He
received a good edu- cation, and loved learning; he was so charmed by
the conversation of the Sophist Eustathius, the Greek ambassador, that
he thought of resigning his throne and becoming a philosopher. 35 Unlike
his later namesake, he gave full freedom to all religions, allowed Mani
to preach at his court, and declared that “Magi, Manicheans, Jews,
Christians, and all men of whatever religion should be left undisturbed”
in his Empire. 30 Continuing Ardashir’s redaction of the Avesta, he
persuaded the priests to include in this Persian Bible secular works on
metaphysics, astronomy, and medicine, mostly borrowed from</p>

<p>India and Greece. He was a liberal patron of the arts. He was not as
great a general as Shapur II or the two Khosrus, but he was the ablest
administrator in the long Sasanian line. He built a new capital at
Shapur, whose ruins still bear his name; and at Shush tar, on the Karun
River, he raised one of the major engineering works of antiquity — a dam
of granite blocks, forming a bridge 1710 feet long and 20 feet wide; the
course of the stream was tempo- rarily changed to allow the
construction; its bed was solidly paved; and great sluice gates
regulated the flow. Tradition says that Shapur used Roman engi- neers
and prisoners to design and build this dam, which continued to function
to our own century. 37 Turning reluctantly to war, Shapur invaded Syria,
reached Antioch, was defeated by a Roman army, and made a peace (244)
that restored to Rome all that he had taken. Resenting Armenia’s co
-opera- tion with Rome, he entered that country and established there a
dynasty friendly to Persia (252). His right flank so protected, he
resumed the war with Rome, defeated and captured the Emperor Valerian
(260), sacked An- tioch, and took thousands of prisoners to forced labor
in Iran. Odenathus, governor of Palmyra, joined forces with Rome, and
compelled Shapur again to resign himself to the Euphrates as the
Roman-Persian frontier.</p>
<p>His successors, from 272 to 302, were royal mediocrities. History
makes short shrift of Hormizd II (302-9) , for he maintained prosperity
and peace. He went about repairing public buildings and private
dwellings, especially those of the poor, all at state expense. He
established a new court of justice devoted to hearing the complaints of
the poor against the rich, and often presided himself. We do not know if
these strange habits precluded his son from inheriting the throne; in
any case, when Hormizd died, the nobles im- prisoned his son, and gave
the throne to his unborn child, whom they con- fidently hailed as Shapur
II; and to make matters clear they crowned the foetus by suspending the
royal diadem over the mother’s womb. 38</p>
<p>With this good start Shapur II entered upon the longest reign in
Asiatic history (309-79). From childhood he was trained for war; he
hardened his body and will, and at sixteen took the government and the
field. Invading eastern Arabia, he laid waste a score of villages,
killed thousands of captives, and led others into bondage by cords
attached to their wounds. In 337 he renewed the war with Rome for
mastery of the trade routes to the Far East, and continued it, with
pacific intervals, almost till his death. The conversion of Rome and
Armenia to Christianity gave the old struggle a new intensity, as if the
gods in Homeric frenzy had joined the fray. Through forty years Shapur
fought a long line of Roman emperors. Julian drove him back to
Ctesiphon, but retreated ingloriously; Jovian, outmaneuvered, was forced
to a peace (363) that yielded to Shapur the Roman provinces on the
Tigris, and all Armenia. When Shapur II died Persia was at the height of
its power and prestige, and a hundred thousand acres had been improved
with human blood.</p>

<p>ranian people known to the Greeks as Ephthalites, and mistakenly
called “White Huns,” captured the region between the Oxus and the
Jaxartes. The Sasanian King Bahram V (420-38), named Gur — “the wild
ass”— because of his reckless hunting feats, fought them successfully;
but after his death they spread through fertility and war, and built an
empire extending from the Caspian to the Indus, with its capital at
Gurgan and its chief city at Balkh. They overcame and slew King Firuz
(459-84), and forced King Balas</p>
<p>(484-8) to pay them tribute.</p>
<p>So threatened in the east, Persia was at the same time thrown into
chaos by the struggle of the monarchy to maintain its authority against
the nobles and the priests. Kavadh I (488-531 ) thought to weaken these
enemies by encour- aging a communist movement which had made them the
chief object of its attack. About 490 Mazdak, a Zoroastrian priest, had
proclaimed himself God- sent to preach an old creed: that all men are
born equal, that no one has any natural right to possess more than
another, that property and marriage are human inventions and miserable
mistakes, and that all goods and all women should be the common property
of all men. His enemies claimed that he condoned theft, adultery, and
incest as natural protests against property and marriage, and as
legitimate approximations to utopia. The poor and some others heard him
gladly, but Mazdak was probably surprised to receive the approval of a
king. His followers began to plunder not only the homes but the harems
of the rich, and to carry off for their own uses the most illustrious
and costly concubines. The outraged nobles imprisoned Kavadh, and set
his brother Djamasp upon the throne. After three years in the “Castle of
Obliv - ion” Kava dh escaped, and fled to the Ephthalites. Eager to have
a dependent as the ruler of Persia, they provided him with an army, and
helped him to take Ctesiphon. Djamasp abdicated, the nobles fled to
their estates, and Ka- vadh was again King of Kings (499). Having made
his power secure, he turned upon the communists, and put Mazdak and
thousands of his follow- ers to death. 39 Perhaps the movement had
raised the status of labor, for the decrees of the council of State were
henceforth signed not only by princes and prelates, but also by the
heads of the major guilds. 40 Kavadh ruled for another generation;
fought with success against his friends the Ephthalites, inconclusively
with Rome; and dying, left the throne to his second son Khosru, the
greatest of Sasanian kings.</p>
<p>Khosru I (“Fair Glory,” 531 -79) was called Chosroes by the Greeks,
Kisra by the Arabs; the Persians added the cognomen Anushirvan
(“Immortal Soul”) . When his older brothers conspired to depose him, he
put all his broth - ers to deat h, and all their sons but one. His
subjects called him “the Just”; and perhaps he merited the title if we
separate justice from mercy. Procopius described him as “a past master
at feigning piety” and breaking his word; 41 but Procopius was of the
enemy. The Persian historian al-Tabari praised Khosru’s “penetration,
knowledge, intelligence, courage, and prudence,” and</p>

He com- pletely reorganized the government; chose his aides for ability
regardless of rank; and raised his son’s tutor, Buzurgmihr, to be a
celebrated vizier. He replaced untrained feudal levies with a standing
army disciplined and com- petent. He established a more equitable system
of taxation, and consolidated Persian law. He built dams and canals to
improve the water supply of the cities and the irrigation of farms; he
reclaimed waste lands by giving their cultivators cattle, implements,
and seed; he promoted commerce by the con- struction, repair, and
protection of bridges and roads; he devoted his great energy zealously
to the service of his people and the state. He encouraged — compelled —
marriage on the ground that Persia needed more population to man its
fields and frontiers. He persuaded bachelors to marry by dowering the
wives, and educating their children, with state funds. 43 He maintained
and educated orphans and poor children at the public expense. He
punished apostasy with death, but tolerated Christianity, even in his
harem. He gath- ered about him philosophers, physicians, and scholars
from India and Greece, and delighted to discuss with them the problems
of life, government, and death. One discussion turned on the question,
“What is the greatest misery?” A Greek philosopher answered, “An
impoverished and imbecile old age”; a Hindu replied, “A harassed mind in
a diseased body”; Khosru’s vizier won the dutiful acclaim of all by
saying, “For my part I think the extreme misery is for a man to see the
end of life approaching without having practiced vir- tue.” 44 Khosru
supported literature, science, and scholarship with substantial
subsidies, and financed many translations and histories; in his reign
the uni- versity at Jund-i-Shapur reached its apogee. He so guarded the
safety of for- eigners that his court was always crowded with
distinguished visitors from abroad.</p>
<p>On his accession he proclaimed his desire for peace with Rome.
Justinian, having designs on Africa and Italy, agreed; and in 532 the
two “brothers” signed “an eternal peace.” When Africa and Italy fell,
Khosru humorously asked for a share of the spoils on the ground that
Byzantium could not have, won had not Persia made peace; Justinian sent
him costly gifts. 45 In 539 Khosru declar ed war on “Rome,” alleging
that Justinian had violated the terms of their treaty; Procopius
confirms the charge; probably Khosru thought it wise to attack while
Justinian’s armies were still busy in the West,</p>

<p>looted its treasures, burned down all its buildings except the
cathedral, massa- cred part of the population, and sent the remainder
away to people a new “Antioch” in Persia. Then he bathed with delight in
that Mediterranean</p>
<p>But Khosru was not through with war. About 570, at the request of the
Himyarites of southwest Arabia, he sent an army to free them from their
Abyssinian conquerors; when the liberation was accomplished the Himyar-
ites found that they were now a Persian province. Justinian had made an
alliance with Abyssinia; his successor Justin II considered the Persian
expul- sion of the Abyssinians from Arabia an unfriendly act; moreover,
the Turks on Persia’s eastern border secretly agreed to join in an
attaack upon Khosru; Justin declared war (572). Despite his age, Khosru
took the field in person, and captured the Roman frontier town of Dara;
but his health failed bim, he suffered his first defeat (578) , and
retired to Ctesiphon, where he died in 579, at an uncertain age. In
forty-eight years of rule he had won all his wars and battles except
one; had extended his empire on every side; had made Persia stronger
than ever since Darius I; and had given it so competent a system of
administration that when the Arabs conquered Persia they adopted that
sys- tem practically without change. Almost contemporary with Justinian,
he was rated by the common consent of their contemporaries as the
greater king; and the Persians of every later generation counted him the
strongest and ablest monarch in their history.</p>
<p>His son Hormizd IV (579-89) was overthrown by a general, Bahram</p>
<p>Cobin, who made himsel f regent for Hormizd’s son Khosru II (589),
and a year later made himself king. When Khosru came of age he demanded
the throne; Bahram refused; Khosru fled to Hierapolis in Roman Syria;
the Greek Emperor Maurice offered to restore him to power if Persia
would withdraw from Armenia; Khosru agreed, and Ctesiphon had the rare
experi- ence of seeing a Roman army install a Persian king (596) .</p>

any Pe rsian since Xerxes, and prepared his empire’s fall. When Phocas
murdered</p>
<p>Khosru turned over the conduct of the war to his generals, retired to
his luxurious palace at Dastagird (some sixty miles north of Ctesiphon),
and gave himself to art and love. He assembled architects, sculptors,
and painters to make his new capital outshine the old, and to carve
likenesses of Shirin, the fairest and most loved of his 3000 wives. The
Persians complained that she was a Christian; some alleged that she had
converted the King; in any case, amid his holy war, he allowed her to
build many churches and monas- teries. But Persia, prospering with
spoils and a replenished slave supply, could forgive its king his
self-indulgence, his art, even his toleration. It hailed his victories
as the final triumph of Persia over Greece and Rome, of Ormuzd over
Christ. Alexander at last was answered, and Marathon, Salamis, Plataea,
and Arbela were avenged.</p>
<p>Nothing remained of the Byzantine Empire except a few Asiatic ports,
some fragments of Italy, Africa, and Greece, an unbeaten navy, and a be-
sieged capital frenzied with terror and despair. Heraclius took ten
years to build a new army and state out of the ruins; then, instead of
attempting a costly crossing at Chalcedon, he sailed into the Black Sea,
crossed Armenia, and attacked Persia in the rear. As Khosru had
desecrated Jerusalem, so now Heraclius destroyed Clorumia, birthplace of
Zoroaster, and put out its sacred inextinguishable light (624) . Khosru
sent army after army against him; they were all defeated; and as the
Greeks advanced Khosru fled to Ctesiphon. His</p>

were slain before his eyes; finally another son, Sheroye, put him to

<li>SASANIAN ART</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the wealth and splendor of the Shapurs, the Kavadhs, and the
Khosrus noth- ing survives but the ruins of Sasanian art; enough,
however, to heighten our wonder at the persistence and adaptability of
Persian art from Darius the Great and Persepolis to Shah Abbas the Great
and Isfahan.</p>
<p>Extant Sasanian architecture is entirely secular; the fire temples
have dis- appeared, and only royal palaces remain; and these are
“gigantic skeletons,” 49 with their ornamental stucco facing long since
fallen away. The oldest of these ruins is the so-called palace of
Ardashir I at Firuzabad, southeast of Shiraz. No one knows its date;
guesses range from 340 b.c to a.d. 460. After fifteen centuries of heat
and cold, theft and war, the enormous dome still covers a hall one
hundred feet high and fifty-five wide. A portal arch eighty-nine feet
high and forty-two wide divided a fagade 170 feet long; this fagade
crumbled in our time. From the rectangular central hall squinch arches
led up to a circular dome.* By an unusual and interesting arrangement,
the pressure of the dome was borne by a double hollow wall, whose inner
and outer frames were spanned by a barrel vault; and to this
reinforcement of inner by outer wall were added external buttresses of
attached pilasters of heavy stones. Here was an architecture quite
different from the classic columnar style of Persepolis — crude and
clumsy, but using forms that would come to perfection in the St. Sophia
of Justinian.</p>
<p>Not far away, at Sarvistan, stands a similar ruin of like uncertain
date: a fagade of three arches, a great central hall and side rooms,
covered by ovoid domes, barrel vaults, and semicupolas serving as
buttresses; from these half domes, by r emoving all but their sustaining
framework, the “flying” or skeletal buttress of Gothic architecture may
have evolved. 51 Northwest of Susa another ruined palace, the
Ivan-i-Kharka, shows the oldest known example of the transverse vault,
formed with diagonal ribs. 52 But the most impressive of Sasanian relics
— which frightened the conquering Arabs by its mass — was the royal
palace of Ctesiphon, named by the Arabs Taq-i-Kisra, or Arch of Khosru
(I). It may be the building described by a Greek historian of a.d. 638,
who tells how Justinian “provided Greek marble for Chosroes, and skilled
artisans who built for him a palace in the Roman style, not far from
Ctesiphon.” 53 The north wing collapsed in 1888; the dome is gone; three
immense walls rise to a height of one hundred and five feet, with a
fagade horizontally divided into five tiers of blind arcades. A lofty
central arch — the highest (eighty-five feet) and widest (seventy-two
feet) ellipti- cal arch known — opened upon a hall one hundred and
fifteen by seventy-five</p>

<p>feet; the Sasanian kings relished room. These ruined facades imitate
the less ele- gant of Roman front elevations, like the Theater of
Marcellus; they are more impressive than beautiful; but we cannot judge
past beauty by present ruins.</p>
<p>The most attractive of Sasanian remains are not the gutted palaces of
crumbling sun- baked brick, but rock reliefs carved into Persia’s
mountainsides. These gigan - tic figures are lineal descendants of the
Achaemenid cliff reliefs, and are in some cases juxtaposed with them, as
if to emphasize the continuity of Persian power, and the equality of
Sasanian with Achaemenid kings. The oldest of the Sasanian sculptures
shows Ardashir trampling upon a fallen foe — presumably the last of the
Arsacids. Finer are those at Naqsh-i-Rustam, near Persepolis,
celebrating Ardashir, Shapur I, and Bahram II; the kings are drawn as
dominating figures, but, like most kings and men, they find it hard to
rival the grace and symmetry of the animals. Similar reliefs at
Naqsh-i-Redjeb and at Shapur present powerful stone portraits of Shapur
I and Bahram I and II. At Taq-i-Bustan — “Arch of the Garden”— near
Kermanshah, two column-supported arches are deeply cut into the cliff;
reliefs on the inner and outer faces of the arches show Shapur II and
Khosru Parvez at the hunt; the stone comes alive with fat elephants and
wild pigs; the foliage is carefully done, and the capitals of the
columns are handsomely carved. There is in these sculptures no 6reek
grace of movement or smoothness of line, no keen individualization, no
sense of perspective, and little modeling; but in dignity and majesty,
in masculine vitality and power, they bear compari- son with most of the
arch reliefs of imperial Rome.</p>
<p>Apparently these carvings were colored; so were many features of the
palaces; but only traces of such painting remain. The literature,
however, makes it clear that the art of painting flourished in Sasanian
times; the prophet Mani is reported to have founded a school of
painting; Firdausi speaks of Persian magnates adorn- ing their mansions
with pictures of Iranian heroes; 54 and the poet al-Buhturi (d. 897)
describes the murals in the palace at Ctesiphon. 55 When a Sasanian king
died, the best painter of the time was called upon to make a portrait of
him for a collection kept in the royal treasury. 56</p>
<p>Painting, sculpture, pottery, and other forms of decoration shared
their de- signs with Sasanian textile art. Silks, embroideries,
brocades, damasks, tapestries, chair covers, canopies, tents, and rugs
were woven with servile patience and masterly skill, and were dyed in
warm tints of yellow, blue, and green. Every Persian but the peasant and
the priest aspired to dress above his class; presents often took the
form of sumptuous garments; and great colorful carpets had been an
appanage of wealth in the East since Assyrian days. The two dozen
Sasanian textiles that escaped the teeth of time are the most highly
valued fabrics in existence. 57 Even in their own day Sasanian textiles
were admired and imitated from Egypt to Japan; and during the Crusades
these pagan products were favored for clothing the relics of Christian
saints. When Heraclius captured the palace of Khosru Parvez at
Dastagird, delicate embroideries and an immense rug were among his most
precious spoils. 58 Famous was the “winter carpet” of Khosru Anushirvan,
designed to make him forget winter in its spring and summer scenes:
flowers and fruits made of inwoven rubies and diamonds grew, in this
carpet.</p>

<p>beside walks of silver and brooks of pearls traced on a ground of
gold . 50 Harun al-Rashid prided himself on a spacious Sasanian rug
thickly studded with jewelry . 60 Persians wrote love poems about their
rugs . 61</p>
<p>Of Sasanian pottery little remains except pieces of utilitarian
intent. Yet the ceramic art was highly developed in Achaemenid times,
and must have had some continuance under the Sasanians to reach such
perfection in Mohammedan Iran. Ernest Fenellosa thought that Persia
might be the center from which the art of enamel spread even to the Far
East ; 62 and art historians debate whether Sasanian Persia or Syria or
Byzantium originated lusterware and cloisonne.* 63 Sasanian metalworkers
made ewers, jugs, bowls, and cups as if for a giant race; turned them on
lathes; incised them with graver or chisel, or hammered out a design in
repousse from the obverse side; and used gay animal forms, ranging from
cock to lion, as handles and spouts. The famo us glass “Cup of Khosru”
in the Biblio - theque Nationale at Paris has medallions of crystal
glass inserted into a network of beaten gold; tradition reckons this
among the gifts sent by Harun to Charle- magne. The Goths may have
learned this art of inlay from Persia, and may have brought it to the
West . 64</p>
<p>The silversmiths made costly plate, and helped the goldsmiths to
adorn lords, ladies, and commoners with jewelry. Several Sasanian silver
dishes survive — in the British Museum, the Leningrad Hermitage, the
Bibliotheque Nationale, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; always with
kings or nobles at the hunt, and animals more fondly and successfully
drawn than men. Sasanian coins sometimes rivaled Rome’s in beauty, as in
the issues of Shapur I . 65 Even Sasanian books could be works of art;
tradition tells how gold and silver trickled from the bindings when
Mani’s books were publicly burned . 66 Precious materials were also used
in Sasanian furniture: Khosru I had a gold table inlaid with costly
stones; and Khosru II sent to his savior, the Emperor Maurice, an amber
table five feet in diameter, supported on golden feet and encrusted with
gems . 67</p>
<p>All in all, Sasanian art reveals a laborious recovery after four
centuries of Parthian decline. If we may diffidently judge from its
remains, it does not equal the Achaemenid in nobility or grandeur, nor
the Islamic Persian in inventiveness, delicacy, and taste; but it
preserved much of the old virility in its reliefs, and fore- shadowed
something of the later exuberance in its decorative themes. It wel-
comed new ideas and styles, and Khosru I had the good sense to import
Greek artists and engineers while defeating Greek generals. Repaying its
debt, Sasanian art exported its forms and motives eastward into India,
Turkestan, and China, westward into Syria, Asia Minor, Constantinople,
the Balkans, Egypt, and Spain. Probably its influence helped to change
the emphasis in Greek art from classic representation to Byzantine
ornament, and in Latin Christian art from wooden ceilings to brick or
stone vaults and domes and buttressed walls. The great portals and
cupolas of Sasanian architecture passed down into Moslem mosques and
Mogul palaces and shrines. Nothing is lost in history: sooner or later
every crea- tive idea finds opportunity and development, and adds its
color to the flame of life.</p>

<li>THE ARAB CONQUEST</li>
</ol>
<p>Having killed and succeeded his father, Sheroye — crowned as Kavadh
II — made peace with Heraclius; surrendered Egypt, Palestine, Syria,
Asia Minor, and western Mesopotamia; returned to their countries the
captives taken by Persia; and restored to Jerusalem the remains of the
True Cross. Heraclius reasonably rejoiced over so thorough a triumph; he
did not observe that on the very day in 629 when he replaced the True
Cross in its shrine a band of Arabs attacked a Greek garrison near the
River Jordan. In that same year pestilence broke out in Persia;
thousands died of it, including the King. His son Ardashir III, aged
seven, was proclaimed ruler; a general, Shahr-Baraz, killed the boy and
usurped the throne; his own soldiers killed Shahr-Baraz, and dragged his
corpse through the streets of Ctesiphon, shouting, “Who - ever, not
being of royal blood, seats himself upon the throne of Persia, will
share this fate”; the populace is always more royalist than the king.
Anarchy now swept through a realm exhausted by twenty-six years of war.
Social disintegration climaxed a moral decay that had come with the
riches of victory. 08 In four years nine rulers contested the throne,
and disappeared through assassination, or flight, or an abnormally
natural death. Provinces, even cities, declared their independence of a
central government no longer able to rule. In 634 the crown was given to
Yezdegird III, scion of the house of Sasan, and son of a Negress. 00</p>
<p>In 632 Mohammed died after founding a new Arab state. His second suc-
cessor, the Caliph Omar, received in 634 a letter from Muthanna, his
general in Syria, informing him that Persia was in chaos and ripe for
conquest. 70 Omar assigned the task to his most brilliant commander,
Khalid. With an army of Bedouin Arabs inured to conflict and hungry for
spoils, Khalid marched along the south shore of the Persian Gulf, and
sent a characteristic message to Hormiz d, governor of the frontier
province: “Accept Islam, and</p>
<p>thou art safe; else pay tribute A people is already upon thee, loving
death</p>
<p>even as thou lovest life.” 71 Hormizd challenged him to single
combat; Khalid accepted, and slew him. Overcoming all resistance, the
Moslems reached the Euphrates; Khalid was recalled to save an Arab army
elsewhere; Muthanna replaced him, and, with reinforcements, crossed the
river on a bridge of boats. Yezdegird, still a youth of twenty-two, gave
the supreme command to Rus- tam, governor of Khurasan, and bade him
raise a limitless force to save the state. The Persians met the Arabs in
the Battle of the Bridge, defeated them, and pursued them recklessly;
Muthanna re-formed his columns, and at the Battle of El-Bowayb destroyed
the disordered Persian forces almost to a man (624). Moslem losses were
heavy; Muthanna died of his wounds; but the Caliph sent an abler
general, Saad, and a new army of 30,000 men. Yezdegird replied by arming
1 20,000 Persians. Rustam led them across the Euphrates</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>I 5 2</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>to Kadisiya, and there through four bloody days was fought one of the
de- cisive battles of Asiatic history. On the fourth day a sandstorm
blew into the faces of the Persians; the Arabs seized the opportunity,
and overwhelmed their blinded enemies. Rustam was killed, and his army
dispersed (636) . Saad led his unresisted troops to the Tigris, crossed
it, and entered Ctesiphon.</p>
<p>The simple and hardy Arabs gazed in wonder at the royal palace, its
mighty arch and marble hall, its enormous carpets and jeweled throne.
For ten days they labored to carry off their spoils. Perhaps because of
these im- pediments, Omar forbade Saad to advance farther east; “Iraq,”
he said, “is enough.” 72 Saad complied, and spent the next three years
establishing Arab rule throughout Mesopotamia. Meanwhile Yezdegird, in
his northern prov- inces, raised another army, 150,000 strong; Omar sent
against him 30,000 men; at Nahavand superior tactics won the “Victory of
Victories” for the Arabs; 100,000 Persians, caught in narrow defiles,
were massacred (641). Soon all Persia was in Arab hands. Yezdegird fled
to Balkh, begged aid of China and was refused, begged aid of the Turks
and was given a small force; but as he started out on his new campaign
some Turkish soldiers murdered him for his jewelry (652). Sasanian
Persia had come to an end.</p>
