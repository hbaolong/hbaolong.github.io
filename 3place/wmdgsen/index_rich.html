pursued its masterpieces as modern collectors roam over conti- nents to
find a picture or a vase. The most famous of Chinese calligraphers was
Wang Hsi-chih (ca. 400 a.d.); it was on the Chinese characters as formed
by his graceful hand that the characters were cut when block- printing
began. The great T’ang emperor, T’ai Tsung, resorted to theft to get
from Pien-tsai a scroll written by Wang Hsi-chih. There- upon Pien-tsai,

French, confusing the Bohemian exiles with Gypsies who in the fifteenth
century were entering Western Europe, supposedly from Bohemia, made
Bohbne their word for Gypsy. The name Gypsy is a corruption of Egyptian
, and reflects the claim of the tribe to have come from “Little Egypt.”
Burton traces them to India. 17 In Byzantine lands they took the name
Rom — i.e., (eastern) Roman; in the Balkans and Central Europe they were
called by variants of Atzigan ( Czigany , Zigeuner, Zingari ), a word of
uncertain origin. In European records they first appear in the early
fourteenth century as wandering groups of craftsmen, musicians, dancers,
fortunetellers, and — in general belief — thieves. By 1414 they reached
Ger- many, by 1422 Italy, by 1427 France, by 1500 England. Usually they
accepted baptism, but they took religion and the Commandments lightly,
and soon ran afoul of the Inquisition. They were expelled from Spain
(1499), the Holy Roman Empire (1500, 1548), and France (1561). Aside
from the gay varicolored dress and ornaments or their more prosperous
women, their contribution to civilization lay in dancing and music —
whose alternations of sadness and exuberance have inspired some major
composers.](WMDGSEN477.html)</h1>

chief source for the Marian persecution is John Foxe’s Rerum in ecclesi
a gestarum commentarii (1559), translated into English as Acts and
Monuments (1563), and familiarly known as The Book of Martyrs, This
vivid description of the trials and deaths of the Protes- tants became,
next to the Bible, a cherished household possession among the Puritans;
and though the Jesuit Father Parsons published (1603) five volumes
assailing its accuracy, it had a powerful influence in forming the mood
of Oliver Cromwell’s England. Many Protestant churchmen have criticized
it for exaggeration, misquotation, prejudice, and carelessness with
details; 55 a Catholic historian compares it, in reliability, with
medieval legends of the saints, but concludes that, though many details
are dubious, “no one doubts that these events did so happen.”

greatness, and deplored the Empire as a gay landslide to dissolution.
Yet he recognized the corrup- tion of politics in the Republic, and the
political splendor of the Empire under “the wisdom of Nerva, t he glory
of Trajan, the valor of Hadrian, and the virtue of the two Antonines”;
75 here Montesquieu gave a lead to Gibbon and Renan in naming that
period the noblest and happiest in the history of government. In those
philosopher-kings too Montesquieu found the ethics of the Stoics, which
he clearly preferred to the Christian. His admiration for the Romans of
the Republic passed down to the French en- thusiasts of the Revolution,
and shared in changing French government, martial methods, and
art.</a></h4>
