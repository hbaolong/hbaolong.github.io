the Republic</h4>
<p>I 49 2_I 534</p>
<p>I. THE PROPHET</p>
<p>T HE advantage of hereditary rule is continuity; its nemesis is
medioc- rity. Piero di Lorenzo succeeded without trouble to his
father’s</p>
<p>power, but his character and his mis judgments forfeited the
popularity upon which the rule of the Medici had been based. He was
endowed with a violent temper, a middling mind, a vacillating will, and
admirable inten- tions. He continued Lorenzo’s generosity to artists and
men of letters, but with less discrimination and tact. He was physically
strong, excelled in sports, and took part more frequently and
prominently in athletic compe- titions than Florence thought becoming in
the head of an endangered state. It was among his many misfortunes that
Lorenzo’s enterprises and extravagance had depleted the city’s treasury;
that the competition of British textiles was causing economic depression
in Florence; that Piero’s Orsini wife turned up her Roman nose at the
Florentines as a nation of shopkeepers; that the collateral branch of
the Medici family, derived from Cosimo’s brother Lorenzo “the Elder,”
began now to challenge the de - scendants of Cosimo, and led a party of
opposition in the name of liberty. It was Piero’s crowning misery that
he was contemporary with Charles VIII of France, who invaded Italy, and
of Savonarola, who proposed to replace the Medici with Christ. Piero had
not been built to withstand such strains.</p>
<p>The Savonarola family came from Padua to Ferrara about 1440, when
Michele Savonarola was invited by Niccolo III d’Este to be his court</p>
<p>physician. Michael was a man of piety rare in medicos; he was wont to
rebuke the Ferrarese for preferring romances to religion. 1 His son Nic-
colo was a mediocre physician, but Niccolo’s wife Elena Bonacossi was a
woman of strong character and high ideals. Girolamo was the third of
their seven children. They set him in his turn to study medicine, but he
thought Thomas Aquinas more absorbing than anatomy, and solitude with
his books more pleasant than the sports of youth. At the University of
Bologna he was horrified to find no student so poor as to do virtue
rever-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>ence. “To be considered a man here,” he wrote, “you must defile your
mouth with the most filthy, brutal, and tremendous blasphemies…. If you
study philosophy and the good arts you are considered a dreamer; if you
live chastely and modestly, a fool; if you are pious, a hypocrite; if
you believe in God, an imbecile.” 2 He left the University, and
returned</p>
<p>pledging himself to reform his country and his Church. He passed long
hours in prayer, and fasted so earnestly that his parents mourned his
emacia- tion. In 1474 he was stirred to even severer piety by the Lenten
sermons of Fra Michele, and he rejoiced to see many Ferrarese bringing
masks, false hair, playing cards, unseemly pictures, and other worldly
apparatus to fling them upon a burning pyre in the market place. A year
later, aged twenty-three, he fled secretly from home, and entered a
Dominican monas- tery in Bologna.</p>
<p>He wrote a tender letter to his parents begging their forgiveness for
disappointing the expectations they had had of his advancement in the
world. When they importuned him to return he answered angrily: “Ye
blind! Why do you still weep and lament? You hamper me, though you
should rejoice…. What can I say if you grieve yet, save that you are my
sworn enemies and foes to Virtue? If so, then I say to you, ‘Get ye
behind me, all ye who work evil!’” 3 Six years he stayed in the Bologna
convent. He proudly asked that the most humble tasks should be given
him, but his talent as an orator was discovered, and he was set to
preaching. In 1481 he was transferred to San Marco in Florence, and was
assigned to preach in the church of San Lorenzo. His sermons there
proved un- popular; they were too theological and didactic for a city
that knew the eloquence and polish of the humanists; his congregation
dwindled week by week. The prior set him to instructing novices.</p>
<p>It was probably in the next five years that his final character was
formed. As the intensity of his feelings and purposes increased they
wrote them- selves upon his features in the furrowed and frowning
forehead, the thick lips tight with determination, the immense nose
curving out as if to encom- pass the world, a countenance somber and
severe, expressing an infinite capacity for love and hate; a small frame
racked and haunted with visions, frustrated aspirations, and introverted
storms. “I am still flesh like you,” he wrote to his parents, “and the
senses are unruly to reason, so that I must</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 145</p>
<p>struggle cruelly to keep the Demon from leaping upon my back.” 4 He
fasted and flogged himself to tame what seemed to him the inherent cor-
ruption of human nature. If he personified the promptings of flesh and
pride as Satanic voices, he could with equal readiness personify the ad-
monitions of his better self. Alone in his cell, he glorified his
solitude by conceiving himself as a battleground of spirits hovering
over him for evil or for good. Finally it seemed to him that angels,
archangels, were speak- ing to him; he accepted their words as divine
revelations; and suddenly he spoke to the world as a prophet chosen to
be a messenger of God. He avidly absorbed the apocalyptic visions
attributed to the Apostle John, and inherited the eschatalogy of the
mystic Joachim of Flora. Like Joa- chim he announced that the reign of
Antichrist had come, that Satan had captured the world, that soon Christ
would appear to begin FI is earthly rule, and that divine vengeance
would engulf the tyrants, adulterers, and atheists who seemed to
dominate Italy.</p>
<p>When his prior sent him to preach in Lombardy (i486), Savonarola</p>
<p>abandoned his youthful pedagogic style, and cast his sermons into the
form of denunciations of immorality, prophecies of doom, and calls to
repent- ance. Thousands of people who could not have followed his
earlier argu- ments listened with awe to the newly impassioned eloquence
of a man who seemed to be speaking with authority. Pico della Mirandola
heard of the friar’s success; he asked Lorenzo to suggest to the prior
that Savonarola should be brought back to Florence. Savonarola returned
(1489); two years later he was chosen prior of San Marco; and Lorenzo
found in him an enemy more forthright and powerful than any that had
ever crossed his path.</p>
<p>Florence was surprised to discover that the swarthy preacher who a
decade before had chilled them with argument, could now awe them with
apocalyptic fantasies, thrill them with vivid descriptions of the
paganism, corruption, and immorality of their neighbors, lift up their
souls to re- pentance and hope, and renew in them the full intensity of
the faith that had inspired and terrified their youth.</p>
<p>Ye women, who glory in your ornaments, your hair, your hands,</p>
<p>I tell you you are all ugly. Would you see true beauty? Look at
the</p>
<p>pious man or woman in whom spirit dominates matter; watch him</p>
<p>when he prays, when a ray of the divine beauty glows upon him</p>
<p>when his prayer is ended; you will see the beauty of God shining
in</p>
<p>his face, you will behold it as it were the face of an angel. 5</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>I46</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>Men marveled at his courage, for he flayed the clergy and the papacy
more than the laity, the princes more than the people; and a note of
political radicalism warmed the hearts of the poor:</p>
<p>In these days there is no grace, no gift of the Holy Spirit, that
may</p>
<p>not be bought or sold. On the other hand, the poor are oppressed</p>
<p>by grievous burdens; and when they are called to pay sums beyond</p>
<p>heir means the rich cry unto them, “Give me the rest.” There be</p>
<p>some who, having an income of fifty [florins per year], pay a tax</p>
<p>on one hundred, while the rich pay little, since the taxes are
re-</p>
<p>gulated at their pleasure. Bethink ye well, O ye rich, for
affliction</p>
<p>shall smite ye. This city shall no more be called Florence but a
den</p>
<p>of thieves, of baseness and bloodshed. Then shall ye all be
poverty-</p>
<p>stricken… and your name, O priests, shall be changed into a terror.
6</p>
<p>After the priests the bankers:</p>
<p>You have found many ways of making money, and many ex-</p>
<p>changes which you call lawful but which are most unjust; and you</p>
<p>have corrupted the offices and magistrates of the city. No one
can</p>
<p>persuade you that usury [interest] is sinful; you defend it at
the</p>
<p>peril of your souls. No one is ashamed of lending at usury; nay,</p>
<p>hose who do otherwise pass for fools…. Your brow is that of a</p>
<p>whore, and you will not blush. You say, a good and glad life lies
in</p>
<p>gain; and Christ says, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they
shall</p>
<p>inherit heaven. 7</p>
<p>And a word for Lorenzo:</p>
<p>Tyrants are incorrigible because they are proud, because they</p>
<p>love flattery, and will not restore ill-gotten gains…. They
hearken</p>
<p>not unto the poor, and neither do they condemn the rich…. They</p>
<p>corrupt voters, and farm out taxes to aggravate the burdens of
the</p>
<p>people 8…. The tyrant is wont to occupy the people with shows</p>
<p>and festivals, in order that they may think of their own pastimes and
not of his designs, and, growing unused to the conduct of the com-</p>
<p>monwealth, may leave the reins of government in his hands. 9</p>
<p>Nor shall that dictatorship be excused on the ground that it finances
litera- ture and art. The literature and art, said Savonarola, are
pagan; the human- ists merely pretend to be Christians; those ancient
authors whom they so sedulously exhume and edit and praise are strangers
to Christ and the Chris- tian virtues, and their art is an idolatry of
heathen gods, or a shameless display of naked women and men.</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC I47</p>
<p>Lorenzo was disturbed. His grandfather had founded and enriched the
monastery of San Marco; he himself had given to it lavishly; it seemed
to him unreasonable that a friar who could know little of the
difficulties of government, and who idealized a liberty that had been
merely the right of the strong to use the weak without hindrance by law,
should now under- mine, from a Medici shrine, that public support upon
which the political power of his family had been built. He tried to
appease the friar; he went to Mass in San Marco’s, and sent the convent
rich gifts. Savonarola scorned them, and remarked in a subsequent sermon
that a faithful dog does not leave off barking in his master’s defense
because a bone is thrown to him. When he found an unusually large sum,
in gold, in the alms box, he sus- pected that it came from Lorenzo, and
gave it to another monastery, saying that silver sufficed the needs of
his brethren. Lorenzo sent five leading citi- zens to argue with him
that his inflammatory sermons would lead to useless violence, and were
unsettling the order and peace of Florence; Savonarola answered by
telling them to bid Lorenzo do penance for his sins. A Fran- ciscan
friar famous for eloquence was encouraged to preach popular ser- mons
with a view to drawing the Dominican’s audience away; the Francis - can
failed. Greater throngs than ever before came to San Marco, until its
church could no longer hold them. For his Lenten sermons of 1491 Savo-
narola moved his pulpit into the cathedral; and though that edifice had
been designed to contain a city, it was crowded whenever the friar was
sched- uled to speak. The ailing Lorenzo made no further effort to
interfere with his preaching.</p>
<p>After Lorenzo’s death the weakness of his son Piero made Savonarola
the greatest power in Florence. With the reluctant consent of the new
pope, Alexander VI, he separated his convent from the Lombard
Congregation (of Dominican monasteries) of which it had been a part, and
made himself in practice the independent head of his monastic community.
He reformed its regulations, and raised the moral and intellectual level
of the friars under his rule. New recruits joined his flock, and most of
its 2 50 members devel- oped for him a love and fidelity that upheld him
in all but his final ordeal. He became bolder in his criticism of the
laic and clerical immorality of the time. Inheriting, however
unwittingly, the anticlerical views of the Wal- densian and Patarine
heretics who still lurked here and there in northern Italy and central
Europe, he condemned the worldly wealth of the clergy, the pomp of
ecclesiastical ceremony, “the great pr elates with splendid miters of
gold and precious stones on their heads… with fine copes and stoles of
brocade”; he contrasted this affluence with the simplicity of the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>priests in the early Church; these “had fewer gold miters and fewer
chal- ices, for what few they possessed were broken up to relieve the
needs of the poor; whereas our prelates, for the sake of obtaining
chalices, will rob the poor of their sole means of support.” 10 To these
denunciations h e added prophecies of doom. He had predicted that
Lorenzo and Innocent VIII would die in 1492; they did. Now he predicted
that presently the sins of Italy, of her despots and her clergy, would
be avenged by a dire disaster; that thereafter Christ would lead the
nation in a glorious reform; and that he himself, Savonarola, would die
a violent death. Early in 1494 he foretold that Charles VIII would
invade Italy, and he welcomed the invasion as the chastening hand of
God. His sermons at this time, says a contemporary, were “so full of
terrors and alarms, cries and lamentations, that everyone went about the
city bewildered, speechless, and, as it were, half dead.” 11</p>
<p>In September, 1494, Charles VIII crossed the Apennines into Italy,
re- solved to add the Kingdom of Naples to the French crown. In October
he entered Florentine territory and besieged the fortress of Sarzana.
Piero thought he could save Florence from France as his father had saved
it from Naples, by going in person to the enemy. He met Charles at
Sarzana, and yielded to all demands: Pisa, Leghorn, and every bastion of
Florence in the west were surrendered to the French for the duration of
the war, and Flor- ence was to advance 200,000 florins (,000,000) to
help finance Charles’s campaign. 12 When news of these concessions
reached Florence the Signory and the Council were shocked; contrary to
Lorenzo’s precedents, they had not been consulted in these negotiations.
Led by the Medici opponents of Piero, the Signory decided to depose him
and restore the old republic. When Piero returned from Sarzana he found
the gates of the Palazzo Vec- chio closed in his face. As he rode to his
home the people jeered him, and urchins pelted him with stones. Fearing
for his life, he fled from the city with his family and his brothers.
The populace sacked the Medici palace and gardens, and the homes of
Piero’s financial agents; the art collection</p>

<p>o the south. Florence addressed itself now to one of history’s most
spec - tacular experiments in democracy.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE STATESMAN</li>
</ol>
<p>On December 2, 1494 the citizens were summoned to a parlamento by the
great bell in the Palazzo Vecchio tower. The Signory asked and re-
ceived the power to name twenty men who would appoint a ne w Signory and
new magistrates for a year, after which all offices were to be filled by
lot from a register of the approximately three thousand enfranchised
males. The Twenty dismissed the councils and agencies which under the
Medici had considered and administered public affairs, and divided the
diverse functions among themselves. They were inadequately experienced
for these tasks, and were torn by family factions; the new governmental
ma- chinery broke down, and chaos was imminent; commerce and industry
hesitated, men were thrown out of work, and angry crowds gathered in the
streets. Piero Capponi persuaded the Twenty that order could be saved
only by inviting Savonarola into their councils.</p>
<p>The friar summoned them to his monastery, and expounded to them an
ambitious program of political, economic, and moral legislation. Under
his leadership and that of Pietro Soderini, the Twenty devised a new
constitu- tion, partly modeled on that which was so successfully
maintaining stability in Venice. A Maggior Consiglio or Great Council
was to be formed of men who — or their ancestors in the preceding three
generations — had held a ma- jor office in the state; and these initial
members were to choose twenty- eight additional councilors in each year.
The executive organs of the gov- ernment were to remain essentially as
under the Medici: a Signory of eight priors and a gonfalonier, chosen by
the Council for a term of two months, and various committees — The
Twelve, The Sixteen, The Ten, The Eight — to carry on administration,
taxation, and war. Complete democracy was postponed as impractical in a
society still largely illiterate and subject to waves of passion; but
the Great Council, numbering almost three thousand members, was
considered to be a representative body. Since no room in the Palazzo
Vecchio could house so large an assemblage, Simone Pollaiuolo — II
Cronaca — was engaged to redesign part of the interior into a Sala dei
Cinquecento, or Hall of the Five Hundred, where the Council could meet
in sections; here, eight years later, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo
would be commissioned to paint opposed walls in a famous rivalry.</p>
<p>Through Savonarola’s influence and eloquence the proposed
constitution</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>received public acclaim, and the new Republic came into operation on
June 10, 1495.</p>
<p>It began amiably by issuing amnesty to all supporters of the deposed
Medici regime. With self-respecting generosity it abolished all taxes
except a ten-per-cent levy on income from real property; the merchants
who dom- inated the Council thus exempted commerce from taxation, and
laid the whole burden on the landowning aristocracy and the land-using
poor. At Savonarola’s urging the government established a monte di
pieta, or state loan office, which lent money at five to seven per cent,
and freed the poor from dependence on private moneylenders, who had
charged up to thirty per cent. Again at the friar’s prompting, the
Council attempted to reform morals with laws: it forbade horse races,
gross carnival songs, profanity, and gambling; servants were encouraged
to inform against masters who gambled, and convicted offenders were
punished with torture; blasphemers had their tongues pierced, and
homosexuals were degraded with merciless penalties. To aid in the
enforcement of these reforms Savonarola organized the boys of his
congregation into a moral police. They pledged themselves to attend
church regularly, to avoid races, pageants, acrobatic displays, loose
company, obscene literature, dancing, and music schools, and to wear
their hair short. These “bands of hope” roamed the streets soliciting
alms for the Church; they dispersed groups that had gathered to gamble,
and tore from the bodies of women what they judged to be indecent
dress.</p>
<p>For a time the city accepted these reforms; many women gave them en-
thusiastic support, behaved modestly, dressed plainly, and put aside
their jewelry. A moral revolution transformed what had been the gay
Florence of the Medici. People sang hymns, not Bacchic lyrics, in the
streets.</p>
<p>Churches were filled, and alms were given in unprecedented quantity.
Some bankers and merchants restored illegal gains. 13 Savonarola called
upon all the population, rich and poor, to shun idleness and luxury, to
work assiduously, and to give a good exampl e with their lives. “Your
reform,” he said, “must begin with the things of the spirit… your
temporal good must serve your moral and religious welfare, on which it
depends. And if you have heard it said that ‘states are not ruled by
paternosters,’ r emem- ber that this is the rule of tyrants… a rule for
oppressing, not for liber- ating, a city. If you desire a good
government you must restore it to God.” 14 He proposed that Florence
should think of its government as hav - ing an invisible king — Christ
Himself; and under this theocracy he predicted Utopia: “O Florence! then
wilt thou be rich with spiritual and temporal wealth; thou wilt achieve
the reformation of Rome, of Italy, of all coun- tries; the wings of thy
greatness shall spread over t he world.” 15 And in</p>
<p>CHAP. V) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 151</p>
<p>ruth Florence had seldom been so happy before. It was a bright moment
in the hectic history of virtue.</p>
<p>But human nature remained. Men are not naturally virtuous, and social
order maintains itself precariously amid the open or secret conflict of
egos, families, classes, races, and creeds. A powerful element in the
Florentine community itched for taverns, brothels, and gambling halls as
outlets for instincts or as sources of gain. The Pazzi, the Nerli, the
Capponi, the younger branch of the Medici, and other aristocrats who had
effected the explusion of Piero were furious at seeing the government
fall into the hands of a friar. Remnants of Piero’s party survived, and
watched for a c hance to restore him and their fortunes. The Franciscan
friars worked with religious zeal against the Dominican Savonarola, and
a small group of skeptics called for a plague on both their houses.
These diverse enemies of the new order agreed in satirizing its
supporters as Piagnoni or weepers (for many wept at Savonarola’s
sermons), Collitorti or wry -necks, Stropiccioni or hypo- crites,
Masticapatemostri or prayer-munchers; and the recipients of these titles
denominated their opponents, from the virulence of their hostility,
Arrabiati, mad dogs. Early in 1496 the Arrabiati succeeded in electing
their candidate for gonfalonier, Filippo Corbizzi. Having assembled in
the Pa- lazzo Vecchio a council of ecclesiastics, he summoned Savonarola
before it, and accused him of political activities improper in a friar;
and several churchmen, including one of his own Dominican order, joined
in the charge. He replied: “Now the words of the Lord are fulfilled:
‘The sons of my mother have fought against me.’… To be concerned with
the af- fairs of this world… is no crime in a monk unless he should mix
in them without any higher aim, and without seeking to promote the cause
of re- ligion.” 16 They challenged him to say whether his sermons were
inspired by God, but he refused to answer. He returned to his cell a
sadder man.</p>
<p>He might have overcome his enemies had foreign affairs favored him.
The Florentines, who praised liberty, were furious at Pisa for demanding
and securing it. Even Savonarola dared not defend the rebellious city;
and a cathedral canon who remarked that the Pisans too had a right to be
free was severely punished by a Piagnone Signory. Savonarola promised to
re- store Pisa to Florence, and rashly claimed that he held Pisa in the
hollow of his hand; but he was, as Machiavelli scornfully said, a
prophet without arms. When Charles VIII was chased from Italy, Pisa
consolidated its in- dependence by an alliance with Milan and Venice;
and the Florentines mourned that Savonarola had tie d them to Charles’s
falling star, and that they alone had not shared in the glorious
expulsion of the French from Italy. 17 Before abandoning the lately
Florentine fortresses of Sarzana and</p>
<p>152 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. V</p>
<p>Pietra Santa, their French commandants had sold one to Genoa and the
other to Lucca. Montepulciano, Arezzo, Volterra, and other Florentine
dependencies were agitated by movements for liberation; the once proud
and powerful city seemed on the verge of losing nearly all its outlying
possessions, and all its trade outlets by the Arno, the Adriatic, and
the roads to Milan and Rome. Trade suffered, tax revenues fell. The
Council tried to finance the war against Pisa by forced loans from rich
citizens, offering them government bonds in return; but as bankruptcy
neared these bonds declined to eighty to fifty to ten per cent of their
face value. In 1496 the treasury was exhausted, and the government
imitated Lorenzo by borrow- ing money from a fund confided to the state
to provide dowries for poor brides. In the administration of government
funds, whether by Arrabiati or Piagnoni, corruption and incompetence
rose and spread. Francesco Valori, made gonfalonier (January, 1497) by a
Piagnone majority in the Council, maddened the Mad Dogs by excluding
them from all magistracies, denying them membership in the Council if
they were delinquent in taxes, allowing none but Piagnoni to address the
Council, and expelling from Florence any Franciscan friar who preached
against Savonarola. For eleven months in 1496 rain fell almost daily,
ruining the crops of the narrowed hinterland; in 1497 people dropped
dead of hunger in the streets. The gov- ernment opened relief stations
to provide grain for the poor; women were crushed to death in the
multitudes that applied. The Medicean party plotted to restore Piero;
five leaders were detected and were condemned to death (1497); appeal to
the Council, guaranteed by the constitution, was refused them; they were
executed within a few hours of their condemna- tion; and many
Florentines contrasted the faction, violence, and severity of the
Republic with the order and peace of Lorenzo’s time. Hostile crowds
repeatedly demonstrated before Savonarola’s monastery; Piagnoni and
Arrabiati stoned each other in the streets. When the friar preached on
As- cension Day of 1497 his sermon was interrupted by a riot in which
his ene- mies tried to seize him and were repulsed by his friends. A
gonfalonier pro- posed to the Signory that he should be banished as a
means of quieting the city, and the proposal was lost by a single vote.
Amid this bitter collapse of his dream Savonarola faced and defied the
strongest power in Italy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE MARTYR</li>
</ol>
<p>Pope Alexander VI was not deeply disturbed by Savonarola’s cr iticism
of the clergy or of the morals of Rome. He had heard the like
before;</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 153</p>
<p>hundreds of ecclesiastics, for centuries past, had complained that
many priests lived immoral lives, and that the popes loved wealth and
power more than became the vicars of Christ. 18 Alexander was of a
genial temperament; he did not mind a little criticism so long as he
felt secure in the Apostolic chair. What disturbed him in Savonarola was
the friar’s politics. Not the semidemocratic nature of the new
constitution; Alexander had no special interest in the Medici, and
perhaps preferred in Florence a weak republic to a strong dictatorship.
Alexander feared another French invasion; he had joined in forming a
league of Italian states to expel Charles VIII and to dis- courage a
second French attack; he resented the adherence of Florence to its
alliance with France, considered Savonarola the power behind this pol-
icy, and suspected him of secret correspondence with the French govern-
ment. Savonarola wrote to Charles VIII about this time three letters
sec- onding the proposal of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere that the King
should call a general council of ecclesiastics and statesmen to reform
the Church and depose Alexande r as “an infidel and a heretic.” 19
Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, representing Milan at the papal court, urged
the Pope to end the friar’s preaching and influence.</p>
<p>On July 21, 1495 Alexander wrote a brief note to Savonarola:</p>
<p>To our well-beloved son, greeting and the apostolic benediction.</p>
<p>We have heard that of all the workers in the Lord’s vineyard thou art
the most zealous; at which we deeply rejoice, and give thanks to</p>
<p>Almighty God. We have likewise heard that thou dost assert thy</p>
<p>predictions proceed not from thee but from God.* Therefore we</p>
<p>desire, as behooves our pastoral office, to have speech with thee</p>
<p>considering these things; so that, being by these means better
in-</p>
<p>formed of God’s will, we may be better able to fulfill it. Whereto
-</p>
<p>fore, by thy vow of holy obedience, we enjoin thee to wait on us</p>
<p>without delay, and shall welcome thee with loving kindness. 20</p>
<p>This letter was a triumph for Savonarola’s enemies, for it placed him
in a situation where he must either end his career as a reformer, or
flagrantly disobey the Pope. He feared that once in the papal power he
would never be allowed to return to Florence; he might end his days in a
Sant’ Angelo dungeon; and if he did not come back his supporters would
be ruined. On their advice he replied to Alexander that he was too ill
to travel to Rome. That the Pope’s motives were political appeared when
he wrote to the Signory on September 8 protesting against the continued
alliance of Flor-</p>
<ul>
<li>The Church, to check false prophets, had pronounced such claims to
be heretical.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>!54</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>ence with France, and exhorting the Florentines not to endure the
reproach of being the only Italians allied with the enemies of Italy. At
the same time he ordered Savonarola to desist from preaching, to submit
to the authority of the Dominican vicar-general in Lombardy; and to go
wherever the vicar- general should bid him. Savonarola replied
(September 29) that his con- gregation was unwilling to subordinate
itself to the vicar-general, but that meanwhile he would refrain from
preaching. Alexander, in a conciliatory response (October 16), repeated
his prohibition of preaching, and ex- pressed the hope that when
Savonarola’s health should permit he would come to Rome, to be received
in “a joyful and fatherly spirit.” 21 There, for a year, Alexander let
the problem rest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the prior’s party had recaptured control of the Council and
the Signory. The emissaries of the Florentine government in Rome be-
sought the Pope to withdraw his interdict on the friar’s preaching,
urging that Florence needed his moral stimulus in Lent. Alexander seems
to have given a verbal consent, and on February 17, 1496, Savonarola
resumed his preaching in the cathedral. About this time Alexander
commissioned a learned Dominican bishop to examine Savonarola’s
published sermons for heresy. The bishop reported: “Most Holy Father,
this friar says nothing that is not wise and honest; he speaks against
simony and the corruption of the priesthood, which in truth is very
great; he respects the dogmas and authority of the Church; wherefore I
would rather seek to make him my friend — if need be by offering him the
cardinal’s purple.” 22 Alexander com - plaisantly sent a Dominican to
Florence to offer Savonarola the red hat. The friar felt not
complimented but shocked; this, to him, was but another instance of
simony. His answer to Alexander’s emissary was: “Come to my next sermon,
and you will have my reply to Rome.” 23</p>
<p>His first sermon of the year reopened his conflict with the Pope. It
was an event in the history of Florence. Half the excited city wished to
hear him, and even the vast duomo could not contain all who sought
entry, though within they were crowded so tightly that no one could
move. A group of armed friends escorted the prior to the cathedral. He
began by explaining his long absence from the pulpit, and affirming his
full loyalty to the teachings of the Church. But then he issued an
audacious challenge to the Pope:</p>
<p>The superior may not give me any command contrary to the</p>
<p>rules of my order; the pope may not give any command opposed</p>
<p>o charity or the Gospel. I do not believe that the pope would
ever</p>
<p>seek to do so; but were he so to do I should say to him, “Now
thou</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 1 55</p>
<p>art no pastor, thou art not the Church of Rome, thou art in
error.”</p>
<p>… Whenever it be clearly seen that the commands of superiors are
contrary to God’s commandments, and especially when contrary</p>
<p>o the precepts of charity, no one is in such case bound to
obedience.</p>
<p>… Were I to clearly see that my departure from a city would be</p>
<p>he spiritual and temporal ruin of the people, I would obey no living
man that commanded me to depart… forasmuch as in obeying</p>
<p>him I should disobey the commands of the Lord. 21</p>
<p>In a sermon for the second Sunday in Lent he denounced the morals of
Christendom’s capital in harsh terms: “One thousand, ten thousand, four
- teen thousand harlots are few for Rome, for there both men and women
are made harlots.” 23 These sermons were spread throughout Europe by the
new marvel, the printing press, and were read everywhere, even by the
sultan of Turkey. They aroused a war of pamphlets in and out of Flor-
ence, some of them accusing the friar of heresy and indiscipline, others
de- fending him as a prophet and a saint.</p>
<p>Alexander sought an indirect escape from open war. In November,</p>
<p>1496, he ordered the union of all Tuscan Dominican monasteries in a
new Tuscan-Roman Congregation, to be directly under the authority of
Padre Giacomo da Sicilia. Padre Giacomo was favorably disposed toward
Savo- narola, but would presumably accept a papal suggestion to transfer
the friar to another environment. Savonarola refused to obey the order
of union, and took his case over the head of the Pope to the public at
large in a pam- phlet called “An Apology of the Brethren of San Marco.”
“This union,” he argued, “is impossible, unreasonable, and hurtful, nor
can the brethren of San Marco be bound to agree to it, inasmuch as
superiors may not issue commands contrary to the rules of the order, nor
contrary to the law of charity or the welfare of our souls.” 28
Technically all monastic congrega - tions were directly subject to the
popes; a pope might compel the merger of congregations against their
will; Savonarola himself, in 1493, had ap- proved Alexander’s order
uniting the Dominican Congregation of St. Cath - erine’s at Pisa,
against its will, with Savonarola’s Congregation of St. Mar k. 27
Alexander, however, took no immediate action. Savonarola continued to
preach, and issued to the public a series of letters defending his
defiance of the Pope.</p>
<p>As the Lenten season of 1497 approached, the Arrabiati prepared to
cele- brate carnival by such festivities, processions, and songs as had
been sanc- tioned under the Medici. To counter these plans Savonarola’s
loyal aide, Fra Domenico, instructed the children of the congregation to
organize a</p>
<p>156 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. V</p>
<p>quite different celebration. During the week of Carnival — preceding
Lent — these boys and girls went about the city in bands, knocked at
doors, and asked for — sometimes demanded — the surrender of what they
called “vani - ties” or cursed objects (anathemase)— pictures considered
immoral, love songs, carnival masks and costumes, false hair, fancy
dresses, playing cards, dice, musical instruments, cosmetics, wicked
books like the Decameron or the Morgante maggiore…. On the final day of
Carnival, February 7, the more ardent supporters of Savonarola, singing
hymns, marched in solemn procession, behind a figure of the Infant Jesus
carved by Donatello and borne by four children in the guise of angels,
to the Piazza della Signoria. There a great pyramid of combustible
material had been raised, 60 feet high and 240 feet in circumference at
the base. Upon the seven stages of the pyramid the “vanities” collected
during the week, or now brought to the sacrifice, were arranged or
thrown, including precious manuscripts and works of art. Fire was set to
the pyre at four points, and the bells of the Palazzo Vecchio were rung
to acclaim this first Savonarolan “burning of the vanities.”*</p>
<p>The Lenten sermons of the friar carried the war to Rome. While
ac-</p>
<p>cepting the principle that the Church should have some terra firma of
temporal power, he argued that the wealth of the Church was the source
of her deterioration. His invective now knew no bounds.</p>
<p>The earth teems with bloodshed, yet the priests take no heed;</p>
<p>rather, by their evil example, they bring spiritual death upon
all.</p>
<p>They have withdrawn from God, and their piety consists in spend-</p>
<p>ing their nights with harlots…. They say that God hath no care</p>
<p>of the world, that all cometh by chance; neither believe they
that</p>
<p>Christ is present in the sacrament…. Come hither, thou ribald</p>
<p>Church. The Lord saith: I gave thee beautiful vestments, but thou</p>
<p>hast made idols of them. Thou hast dedicated the sacred vessels
to</p>
<p>vainglory, the sacraments to simony. Thou hast become a shameless
harlot in thy lusts; thou art lower than a beast; thou art a monster of
abomination. Once thou felt shame for thy sins, but now thou art</p>
<p>shameless. Once anointed priests called their sons nephews, but now
they speak of their sons.t… And thus, O prostitute Church, thou</p>
<p>hast displayed thy foulness to the whole world, and stinkest unto</p>
<p>heaven. 28</p>
<p>Savonarola suspected that such tirades would earn him excommunica-
tion. He welcomed it.</p>

<li><p>Such bonfires of vanities were an old custom with mission
friars.</p></li>
<li><p>A reference to Alexander VTs candor about his children.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 1 57</p>
<p>Many of ye say that excommunication will be decreed…. For my</p>
<p>part I beseech Thee, O Lord, that it may come quickly…. Bear this</p>
<p>excommunication aloft on a lance, open the gates to it! I will
reply</p>
<p>o it: and if I do not amaze thee, then thou mayest say what thou</p>
<p>wilt…. O Lord, I seek only Thy cross! Let me be persecuted; I</p>
<p>ask this grace of Thee. Let me not die in my bed, but let me give my
blood for Thee, even as Thou gavest thine for me. 29</p>
<p>These passionate sermons created a furore throughout Italy. Men came
from distant cities to hear them; the duke of Ferrara came in disguise;
the crowd overflowed from the cathedral into the square, and each
striking sentence was relayed from those within to those without. In
Rome the people turned almost unanimously against the friar, and called
for his pun- ishment. 30 In April, 1497 the Arrabiati secured control of
the Council, and — on pretext of danger from the plague — forbade all
preaching in the churches after May 5. Urged on by Roman agents of the
Arrabiati , Alex- ander signed a decree excommunicating the friar (May
13); but he let it be known that he would rescind the excommunication if
Savonarola would obey the summons to Rome. The prior, fearing
imprisonment, still refused, but for six months he held his peace. Then
on Christmas Day he sang High Mass at San Marco, gave the Eucharist to
his friars, and led them in a sol- emn procession around the square.
Many were scandalized at an excom- municate celebrating Mass, but
Alexander made no protest; on the contrary he intimated that he would
withdraw the excommunication if Florence would join the league to resist
a second invasion from France. 31 The Si- gnory, gambling on the success
of the French, rejected the proposal. On February 1 1, 1498, Savonarola
completed his rebellion by preaching in San Marco. He denounced the
excommunication as unjust and invalid, and charged with heresy any man
who should uphold its validity. Finally he issued an excommunication
himself:</p>
<p>Therefore, on him that giveth commands opposed to charity</p>
<p>anathema sit [let there be a curse]. Were such a command pro-</p>
<p>nounced by an angel, even by the Virgin Mary herself and all the</p>
<p>saints (which is certainly impossible), anathema sit…. And if any</p>
<p>pope hath ever spoken to the contrary, let him be declared excom-</p>
<p>municate. 32</p>
<p>On the last day before Lent Savonarola read Mass in the open square
be- fore San Marco’s, administered the sacrament to a great multitude,
and pub - licly prayed: “O Lord, if my deeds be not sincere, if my words
be not</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>I 5 8</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>inspired by Thee, strike me dead on this instant.” That afternoon his
fol - lowers staged a second burning of the vanities.</p>
<p>Alexander informed the Signory that unless it could dissuade
Savonarola from further preaching he would lay an interdict upon the
city. Though now thoroughly hostile to the prior, the Signory refused to
silence him, preferring to let the onus of such a prohibition remain
with the Pope; be- sides, the eloquent friar might be useful in
combating a pope who was organizing the Papal States into a power too
strong for the comfort of its neighbors. Savonarola continued to preach,
but only in the church of his monastery. The Florentine ambassador
reported that feeling against the friar was so intense in Rome that no
Florentine was safe there; and he feared that if the Pope issued the
threatened interdict all Florentine merchants in Rome would be thrown
into jail. The Signory yielded, and ordered Savo- narola to quit
preaching (March 17). He obeyed, but predicted great calamities for
Florence. Fra Domenico filled the convent pulpit in his stead, and
served as the voice of his prior. Meanwhile Savonarola wrote to the
sovereigns of France, Spain, Germany, and Hungary, begging them to call
a general council for the reform of the Church:</p>
<p>The moment of vengeance has arrived. The Lord commands</p>
<p>me to reveal new secrets, and make manifest to the world the
peril</p>
<p>by which the bark of St. Peter is threatened, owing to your long</p>
<p>neglect. The Church is all teeming with abomination, from the</p>
<p>crown of her head to the soles of her feet; yet not only do ye
apply</p>
<p>no remedy, but ye do homage to the cause of the woes by which she is
polluted. Wherefore the Lord is greatly angered, and hath long</p>
<p>left the Church without a shepherd…. For I hereby testify… that</p>
<p>his Alexander is no pope, nor can be held as one; inasmuch as, leav-
ing aside the mortal sin of simony, by which he hath purchased the</p>
<p>papal chair, and daily selleth the benefices of the Church to the
high- est bidder, and likewise putting aside his other manifest vices,
I</p>
<p>declare that he is no Christian, and believes in no God. 38</p>
<p>If, he added, the kings will call a council he will appear before it
and give proof of all these charges. One of these letters was
intercepted by a Mil- anese agent, and was sent to Alexander.</p>
<p>On March 25, 1498 a Franciscan friar, preaching in the church of
Santa Croce, turned the drama of the case upon himself by challenging
Savona- rola to an ordeal of fire. He stigmatized the Dominican as a
heretic and false prophet, and offered to walk through fire if
Savonarola would do the same. He expected, he said, that both of them
would be burned, but hoped</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 1 59</p>
<p>by his sacrifice to free Florence from the disorders that had been
caused by a proud Dominican’s disobedience of the Pope. Savonarola
rejected the challenge; Domenico accepted it. The hostile Signory seized
the chance to discredit a prior who in its view had become a troublesome
demagogue. It approved of the resort to medieval methods, and arranged
that on April 7 Fra Giuliano Rondinelli of the Franciscans and Fra
Domenico da Pescia should enter a fire in the Piazza della Signoria.</p>
<p>On the appointed day the great square was filled with a crowd eager
to enjoy a miracle or the sight of human suffering. Every window and
roof overlooking the scene was occupied with spectators. In the center
of the square, athwart a passage two feet wide, twin pyres had been
erected of wood mixed with pitch, oil, resin, and gunpowder, guaranteed
to make a searing flame. The Franciscan friars took their stand in the
Loggia dei Lanzi; the Dominicans marched in from the opposite direction;
Fra Do- menico carried a consecrated Host, Savonarola a crucifix. The
Franciscans complained that Fra Domenico’s red cape might have been
charmed into incombustibility by the prior; they insisted on his
discarding it; he pro- tested; the crowd urged him to yield; he did. The
Franciscans asked him to remove other garments which they thought might
have been charmed; Domenico consented, went into the palace of the
Signory, and changed clothes with another friar. The Franciscans urged
that he should be for- bidden to approach Savonarola, lest he be
re-enchanted; Domenico sub- mitted to being surrounded by Franciscans.
They objected to his carrying either a crucifix or a consecrated Host
into the fire; he surrendered the crucifix but kept the Host, and a long
theological discussion ensued be- tween Savonarola and the Franciscans
as to whether Christ would be burned along with the appearances of
bread. Meanwhile the Franciscan champion remained in the palace, begging
the Signory to save him by any ruse. The priors allowed the discussions
to go on till darkness fell, and then announced that the ordeal could no
longer take place. The crowd, cheated of blood, attacked the palace, but
was repulsed; some Arrabiati tried to seize Savonarola, but his guard
protected him. The Dominicans returned to San Marco, jeered by the
populace, though apparently the Franciscans had been the chief cause of
delay. Many complained that Savonarola, after claiming that he was
inspired by God and that God would protect him, had allowed Domenico to
represent him in the ordeal, instead of facing it himself. These though
ts spread through the city, and almost overnight the prior’s following
faded away.</p>
<p>On the morrow, Palm Sunday, a mob of Arrabiati and others marched
to</p>
<p>l6o THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. V</p>
<p>attack the monastery of San Marco. On the way they killed some
Piagnoni, including Francesco Valori; his wife, drawn to a window by his
cries, was shot through with an arrow; his house was pillaged and
burned; one of his grandchildren was smothered to death. The bell of San
Marco tolled to call the Piagnoni to the rescue, but they did not come.
The friars prepared to defend themselves with swords and clubs;
Savonarola in vain bade them lay down their arms, and himself stood
unarmed at the altar, awaiting death. The friars fought valiantly; Fra
Enrico wielded his sword with secular delight, accompanying each blow
with a lusty cry, Salvum fac populum tuum, Domine — “Save thy people,
Lord!” But the hostile crowd was too numerous for the friars; Savonarola
finally prevailed upon them to lay down their arms; and when an order
came from the Signory for his arrest and that of Domenico, the two
surrendered, and were led through a mob that jeered, struck, kicked, and
spat upon them, to cells in the Palazzo Vec- chio. On the following day
Fra Silvestro was added to the prisoners.</p>
<p>The Signory sent to Pope Alexander an account of the ordeal and ar-
rest, begged his absolution for the violence committed on an
ecclesiastic, and asked his authorization to subject the prisoners to
trial, and, if neces- sary, to torture. The Pope urged that the three
friars should be sent to Rome to be tried before an ecclesiastical
court; the Signory refused, and the Pope had to be content with having
two papal delegates share in ex- amining the accused. 34 The Signory was
resolved that Savonarola should die. As long as he lived his party would
live; only his death, they thought, could heal the strife of factions
that had so divided the city and its govern- ment that alliance with
Florence had become worthless to any foreign power, and Florence lay
open to internal conspiracy or external attack.</p>
<p>Following the custom established by the Inquisition, the examiners
put the three friars to torture on various occasions between April 9 and
May 22. Silvestro succumbed at once, and answered so readily as the
examiners wished that his confession was too facile to be useful.
Domenico resisted to the last; tortured to the verge of death, he
continued to avow that Savona- rola was a saint without guile or sin.
Savonarola, high-strung and ex- hausted, soon collapsed under torture,
and gave whatever replies were suggested to him. Recovering, he
retracted the confession; tortured again, he yielded again. After three
ordeals his spirit broke, and he signed a con- fused confession that he
had no divine inspiration, that he had been guilty of pride and
ambition, that he had urged foreign and secular powers to call a general
council of the Church, and that he had plotted for the deposition of the
Pope. On charges of schism and heresy, of revealing confessional</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC l6l</p>
<p>secrets as pretended visions and prophecies, of causing faction and
disorder in the state, the three friars were condemned to death by the
united sen- tence of state and Church. Alexander graciously sent them
absolution.</p>
<p>On May 23, 1498, the parricide Republic executed its founder and his
comrades. Unfrocked and barefoot, they were led to the same Piazza della
Signoria where twice they had burned the “vanities.” As then, and as for
the trial by ordeal, a great crowd gathered for the sight; but now the
gov- ernment supplied it with food and drink. A priest asked Savonarola,
“In what spirit do you bear this martyrdom?” He answered, “The Lord has
suffered much for me.” He kissed the cruci fix that he carried, and did
not speak again. The friars walked bravely to their doom, Domenico
almost joyfully, singing a Te Deum in gratitude for a martyr’s death.
The three men were hanged from a gibbet, and boys were allowed to stone
them as they choked. A great fire was lighted under them, and burned
them to ashes. The ashes were thrown into the Arno, lest they be
worshiped as the relics of saints. Some Piagnoni , braving
incrimination, knelt in the square and wept and prayed. Every year until
1 703, on the morning after the 23rd of May, flowers were strewn on the
spot where the hot blood of the friars fell. Today a plaque in the
pavement marks the site of the most famous crime in Florentine
history.</p>
<p>Savonarola was the Middle Ages surviving into the Renaissance, and
the Renaissance destroyed him. He saw the moral decay of Italy under the
in- fluence of wealth and a declining religious belief, and he stood
bravely, fanatically, vainly against the sensual and skeptical spirit of
the times. He inherited the moral fervor and mental simplicity of
medieval saints, and seemed out of place and key in a world that was
singing the praises of re- discovered pagan Greece. He failed through
his intellectual limitations and a forgivable but irritating egotism; he
exaggerated his illumination and his capacity, and naively
underestimated the task of opposing at once the power of the papacy and
the instincts of men. He was understandably shocked by Alexander’s
morals, but intemperate in his denunciati ons and intransigeant in his
policy. He was a Protestant before Luther only in the sense of calling
for a reform of the Church; he shared none of Luther’s the - ological
dissents. But his memory became a force in the Protestant mind; Luther
called him a saint. His influence on literature was slight, for litera-
ture was in the hands of skeptics and realists like Machiavelli and
Guic- ciardini; but his influence on art was immense. Fra Bartolommeo

<p>God.” Botticelli turned from paganism to piety under Savonarola’s
preach - ing. Michelangelo heard the friar frequently, and read his
sermons de- votedly; it was the spirit of Savonarola that moved the
brush over the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and traced behind the
altar the terrible Last</p>
<p>Judgment.</p>
<p>The grandeur of Savonarola lay in his effort to achieve a moral
revolu- tion, to make men honest, good, and just. We know that this is
the most difficult of all revolutions, and we cannot wonder that
Savonarola failed where Christ succeeded with so pitiful a minority of
men. But we know, too, that such a revolution is the only one that would
mark a real advance in human affairs; and that beside it the bloody
overturns of history are transient and ineffectual spectacles, changing
anything but man.</p>

<li>THE REPUBLIC AND THE MEDICI: 1 498- 1 534</li>
</ol>
<p>The chaos that had almost nullified government in the later years of
Savonarola’s a scendancy was not mitigated by his death. The brief term
of two months allowed to each Signory and gonfalonier made for a hectic
discontinuity in the executive branch, and inclined the priors to
irrespon- sibility and corruption. In 1502 the Council, dominated by a
triumphant oligarchy of rich men, sought to overcome part of this
difficulty by electing the gonfalonier for life, so that while still
subject to Signory and Council, he might face the popes and the secular
rulers of Italy on terms of equal tenure. The first man to receive this
honor was Pietro Soderini, a million- aire friendly to the people, an
honest patriot whose powers of mind and will were not so eminent as to
threaten Florence with dictatorship. He enlisted Machiavelli among his
advisers, governed prudently and econom- ically, and used his private
fortune to resume that patronage of art which had been interrupted under
Savonarola. With his support Machiavelli re- placed the mercenary troops
of Florence with a citizen militia, which fi- nally (1508) forced Pisa
to yield again to a Florentine “protectorate.”</p>
<p>But in 1512 the foreign policy of the Republic brought on the
disaster that Alexander VI had foretold. Through all the efforts of the
“Holy</p>
<p>League” of Venice, Milan, Naple s, and Rome to rid Italy of its
French in- vaders Florence had persisted in its alliance with France.
When victory crowned the League it turned in revenge upon Florence, and
sent its troops to replace the republican oligarchy with a Medicean
dictatorship. Florence resisted, and Machiavelli labored strenuously to
organize its defense. Its outpost, Prato, was taken and sacked, and
Machiavelli’s militia turned and</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 163</p>
<p>fled from the trained mercenaries of the League. Soderini resigned to
avoid further bloodshed. Giuliano de’ Medici, son of Lorenzo, having
contrib - uted 10,000 ducats (50,000) to the League treasury, entered
Florence under the protection of Spanish, German, and Italian arms; his
brother, Cardinal Giovanni, soon joined him; the Savonarolan
constitution was abol- ished, and the Medicean ascendancy was restored
(1512).</p>
<p>Giuliano and Giovanni behaved with moderation, and the public, sur-
feited with excitement, readily accepted the change. When Giovanni
became Leo X (1513), Giuliano, having proved too gentle to be a
successful ruler, yielded the government of Florence to his nephew
Lorenzo. This ambitious youth died after six years of reckless rule.
Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici, son of the Giuliano who had been slain in
the Pazzi conspiracy, now gave Florence an excellent administration; and
after he became Clem- ent VII (1521) he ruled the city from the papal
chair. Florence took ad- vantage of his misfortunes to expel his
representatives (1527), and for four years it again enjoyed the trials
of liberty. But Clement tempered defeat with diplomacy, and used the
troops of Charles V to avenge his ousted relatives; an army of Spanish
and German troops marched upon Florence (1529), and repeated the story
of 1512; resistance was heroic but vain; and Alessandro de’ Medici began
(1531) a regime of oppression, brutality, and lechery unprecedented in
the annals of the family. Three centuries would pass before Florence
would know freedom again.</p>
<p>V. ART UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>An age of political excitement is usually a stimulant to literature;
and we shall study later two writers of the first rank — Machiavelli and
Guicciardini — who belonged to this period. But a state always verging
on bankruptcy, and engaged in almost permanent revolution, does not
favor art — and least of all architecture. Some rich men, skilled in
floating on a flood, still gave hostages to fortune by building palaces;
so Giovanni Francesco and Aris- totele da Sangallo, working on plans by
Raphael, raised a palatial mansion for the Pandolfini family. In 1520-4
Michelangelo designed for Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici a Nuova Sagrestia,
or New Sacristy, for the church of San Lorenzo — a simple quadrangle and
modest dome, known to all the world as the home of Michelangelo’s finest
sculptures, the tombs of the Medici.</p>
<p>Among the Titan’s rivals was the sculptor Pietro Torrigiano, who</p>
<p>worked with him in Lorenzo’s garden of statuary, and broke his nose
to</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>win an argument. Lorenzo was so incensed by this violence that
Torrigiano took refuge in Rome. He became a soldier in Caesar Borgia’s
service, fought bravely in several battles, found his way to England,
and designed there one of the masterpieces of English art, the tomb of
Henry VII in Westminster Abbey (1519). Wandering restlessly to Spain, he
carved a handsome Madonna and Child for the duke of Arcos. But the duke
under- paid him; the sculptor smashed the statue to bits; the vengeful
aristocrat denounced him to the Inquisition as a heretic; Torrigiano was
sentenced to severe punishment, but cheated his foes by starving himself
to death.</p>
<p>Florence had never had so many great artists at one time as in 1492;
but many of them fled from her turbulence, and lent their renown to
other scenes. Leonardo went to Milan, Michelangelo to Bologna, Andrea
Sanso- vino to Lisbon. Sansovino took his cognomen from Monte San
Savino, and made it so famous that the world forgot his real name,
Andrea di Domenico Contucci. Born the son of a poor laborer, he
developed a passion for draw- ing and for modeling in clay; a kindly
Florentine sent him to the studio of Antonio del Pollaiuolo. Maturing
rapidly, he built for the church of Santo Spirito a Chape l of the
Sacrament, with statues and reliefs “so vigorous and excellent,” said
Vasari, “that they are without a flaw”; and before it he placed a bronze
grille that halts the breath with its beauty. King John II of Portugal
begged Lorenzo to send the young artist to him; Andrea went, and labored
nine years there in sculpture and architecture. Lonesome for Italy, he
returned to Florence (1500), but soon passed to Genoa and fi- nally to
Rome. In Santa Maria del Popolo he built two marble tombs — for
Cardinals Sforza and Basso della Rovere — which won high acclaim in a
city then (1505-7) buzzing with geniuses. Leo X sent him to Loreto, and
there (1523-8) Andrea adorned the church of Santa Maria with a series of
reliefs from the life of the Virgin, so beautiful that the angel in the
Annunciation seemed to Vasari “not marble but celestial.” Soon afterward
Andrea re - tired to a farm near his native Monte San Savino, lived
energetically as a peasant, and died in 1529, aged sixty-eight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the della Robbia family had faithfully and skillfully
carried on the work of Luca in glazed clay. Andrea della Robbia exceeded
in longevity even the eighty-five years of his uncle, and had time to
train three sons in the art — Giovanni, Luca, and Girolamo. Andre a’s
terra cottas have a brilliance of tone and a tenderness of sentiment
that snare the eye and still the feet of the museum traveler. A room in
the Bargello is rich with him, and the Hospital of the Innocents is
distinguished by his deco- rative lunette of the Annunciation. Giovanni
della Robbia rivaled his fa-</p>
<p>CHAP. V) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC I 65</p>
<p>her Andrea’s excellence, as one may see in the Bargello and the
Louvre. The della Robbias almost confined themselves to religious
subjects through three generations; they were among the most fervent
supporters of Savo- narola; and two of Andrea’s sons joined the Brethren
of San Marco to seek salvation with the friar.</p>
<p>The painters felt Savonarola’s influence most deeply. Lorenzo di
Credi learned his art from Verrocchio, imitated the style of his fellow
student Leonardo, and took the tenderness of his religious pictures from
the piety nurtured in him by Savonarola’s eloquence and fate. He spent
half his life painting Madonnas; we find them almost everywhere — in
Rome, Florence, Turin, Avignon, Cleveland; the faces poor, the robes
magnificent; perhaps the best is the Annunciation in the Uffizi. At the
age of seventy-two, feel- ing it time to take on the savor of sanctity,
Lorenzo went to live with the monks of Santa Maria Nuova; and there, six
years later, he died.</p>
<p>Piero di Cosimo took his cognomen from his teacher Cosimo Rosselli,
for “he who instructs ability and promotes well -being is as truly a
father as the one who begets.” 35 Cosi mo came to the conclusion that
his pupil sur- passed him; summoned by Sixtus IV to decorate the Sistine
Chapel, he took Piero with him; and Piero painted there The Destruction
of Pharaoh’s Troops in the Red Sea, with a gloomy landscape of water,
rocks, and cloudy sky. He has left us two magnificent portraits, both in
the Hague: of Giuliano da Sangallo and Francesco da Sangallo. Piero was
all artist, caring little for society or friendship, loving nature and
solitude, absorbed in the pictures and scenes that he painted. He died
unconfessed and alone, having transmitted his art to two pupils who
followed his example by sur- passing their master: Fra Bartolommeo and
Andrea del Sarto.</p>
<p>Baccio della Porta took his last name from the gate of San Piero
where he lived; when he became a friar he received the name Fra
Bartolommeo — Brother Bartholomew. Having studied with Cosimo Rosselli
and Piero di Cosimo, he opened a studio with Mariotto Albertinelli,
painted many pic- tures in collaboration with him, and remained bound to
him in a fine friend- ship till parted by death. He was a modest youth,
eager for instruction and receptive to every influence. For a time he
sought to catch the subtle shad- ing of Leonardo; when Raphael came to
Florence Baccio studied perspec- tive with him, and better blending of
colors; later he visited Raphael in Rome and painted with him a noble
Head of St. Peter. Finally he fell in love with the majestic style of
Michelangelo; but he lacked the terrible in- tensity of that angry
giant; and when Bartolommeo attempted the monu- mental he lost in the
enlargement of his simple ideas the charm of his qual-</p>

<p>1 66</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>ities — the rich depth and soft shading of his colors, the stately
symmetry of his composition, the piety and sentiment of his themes.</p>
<p>He was deeply stirred by the sermons of Savonarola. He brought to the
burning of the vanities all his paintings of the nude. When the enemies
of the friar attacked the convent of San Marco ( 1498) he joined in its
defense; in the course of the melee he vowed to become a monk if he
survived; he kept his pledge, and in 1 500 he entered the Dominican
monastery at Prato. For five years he refused to paint, giving himself
up to religious exercises. Transferred to San Marco, he consented to add
his masterpieces in blue, red, and black to the rosy frescoes of Fra
Angelico. There, in the refectory, he painted a Madonna and Child and a
Last judgment; in the cloisters a St. Sebastian ; and in Savonarola ’s
cell a powerful portrait of the friar in the guise of St. Peter Martyr.
The St. Sebastian was the only nude that he painted after becoming a
monk. Originally it was placed in the church of San Marco, but it was so
handsome that some women confessed to having been stirred to wicked
thoughts by it, and the prior sold it to a Florentine who sent it to the
king of France. Fra Bartolommeo continued to paint until 1517, when
disease so paralyzed his hands that he could no longer hold the brush.
He died in that year, at the age of forty-five.</p>
<p>His only rival for supremacy among the Italian painters of this
period was another disciple of Piero di Cosimo. Andrea Domenico d’
Agnolo di Francesco Vannuci is known to us as Andrea del Sarto because
his father was a tailor. Like most Renaissance artists he developed
quickly, beginning his apprenticeship at seven. Piero marveled at the
lad’s skill in design, and noted with warm approval how Andrea, when a
holyday closed the studio, spent his time drawing the figures in the
famous cartoons made by Leo- nardo and Michelangelo for the Hall of the
Five Hundred in the Palazzo Vecchio. When Piero became in old age too
eccentric a master, Andrea and his fellow student Franciabigio set up
their own bottega, and for some time worked together. Andrea seems to
have begun his independent career by painting, in the court of the
Annunziata Church (1509), five scenes from the life of San Filippo
Benizzi, a Florentine noble who had founded the order of the Servites
for the special worship of Mary. These frescoes, though sorely injured
by time and exposure, are so remarkable for draughts- manship,
composition, vividness of narrative, and the soft merging of warm and
harmonious colors, that this atrium is now one of the goals of art pil-
grims in Florence. For one of the female figures Andrea used as model
the woman who in the course of these paintings became his wife —
Lucrezia del</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 167</p>
<p>Fede, a sensuously beautiful shrew whose dark face and raven hair
haunted the artist to all but his dying days.</p>
<p>In 1515 Andrea and Franciabigio undertook a series of frescoes in the
cloisters of the Scalzo fraternity. They chose as subject the life of
St. John the Baptist; but it was surely Andrea’s hand that in several
figures displayed one of his specialties, picturing the female breast in
all the perfection of its texture and form. In 1518 he accepted the
invitation of Francis I to come to France; there he painted the figure
of Charity that hangs in the Louvre. But his wife, left behind in
Florence, begged him to come back; the king granted permission on
Andrea’s pledge to return, and entrusted him with a considerable sum to
buy works of art for him in Italy. Andrea, in Florence, spent the royal
funds in building himself a house, and never went back to France. Facing
bankruptcy nevertheless, he resumed his painting, and pro- duced for the
cloisters of the Annunziata a masterpiece which, said Vasari, “in
design, grace, excellence o f coloring, vivacity, and relief, proved him
far superior to all his predecessors”— who included Leonardo and
Raphael. 36 This Madonna del Sacco — absurdly so called because Mary and
Joseph are shown leaning against a sack — is now damaged and faded, and
no longer con- veys the full splendor of its color; but its perfect
composition, soft tones, and quiet presentation of a family — with
Joseph, suddenly literate, reading a book — make it one of the great
pictures of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>In the refectory of the Salvi monastery Andrea challenged Leonardo
with a Last Supper (1526), choosing the same moment and theme — “One of
you shall betray me.” Bolder than Leonardo, Andrea finished the face of
his Christ; even he, however, fell far short of the spiritual depth and
understanding gentleness that we associate with Jesus. But the Apostles
are strikingly individualized, the action is vivid, the colors are rich
and soft and full; and the picture as seen from the entrance of the
refectory conveys almost irresistibly the illusion of a living
scene.</p>
<p>The Virgin Mother remained the favorite subject of Andrea, as of most
artists of Renaissance Italy. He painted her again and again in studies
of the Holy Family, as in the Borghese Gallery in Rome, or the
Metropolitan Museum in New York. He pictured her, in one of the
treasures of the Uffizi Gallery, as Madonna delle Arpie, Madonna of the
Harpies ;* this is the fairest of the Lucrezia Virgins, and the Child is
the finest in Italian art. Across the Arno, in the Pitti Gallery, the
Assumption of the Virgin shows Apostles and holy women looking up in
amazement and adoration as cheru-</p>
<p>So named from the avenging fates represented on the pedestal.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>

<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>bim raise the praying Madonna — again Lucrezia — to heaven. So, in
Andrea’s colorful illumination, the moving epos of the Virgin is
complete.</p>
<p>There is seldom any sublimity in Andrea del Sarto, no majesty of
Michel- angelo, nor the unfathomable nuances of Leonardo, nor the
finished per- fection of Raphael, nor yet the range or power of the
great Venetians. Yet he alone of the Florentines rivals the Venetians in
color and Correggio in grace-, and his mastery of tones — in their depth
and modulation and trans- parency-might well be preferred to the
lavishment of color in Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese. We miss variety
in Andrea; his paintings move within too small a circle of subject and
sentiment; his hundred Madonnas are always the same young Italian
mother, modest and lovely and at last cloyingly sweet. But no one has
surpassed him in composition, few in anatomy, modeling, and design.
“There is a little fellow in Florence,” said Michelangelo to Raphael,
“who will bring sweat to your brow if ever he is engaged in great
works.” 37</p>
<p>Andrea himself never lived to reach full maturity. The victorious
Ger- mans, capturing Florence in 1530, infected it with plague, and
Andrea was one of its victims. His wife, who had aroused in him all the
heartaches of jealousy that beauty brings to marriage, shunned his room
in those last fevered days; and the artist who had given her an almost
deathless life died with no one by his side, at the age of forty-four.
About 1 570 Iacopo da Empoli went to the court of the Annunziata to copy
del Sarto’s Nativity. An old lady who had come to Mass stopped beside
him and pointed to a figure in the foreground of the painting. “It is
I,” she said. Lucrezia had outlived herself by forty years.</p>
<p>The few artists whom we have here commemorated must be viewed not as
a record but as representatives of the plastic and graphic genius of
this period. There were other sculptors and painters of the time, who
still lead a ghostly existence in the museums — Benedetto da Rovezzano,
Franciabigio, Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, and hundreds more. There were
half-secluded artists, monastic and secular, who still practised the
intimate art of illuminating manuscripts, like Fra Eustachio and Antonio
di Girolamo; there were cal- ligraphers whose handwriting might excuse
Federigo of Urbino for regret- ting the invention of print; there were
mosaicists who despised painting as the perishable pride of a day; wood
carvers like Baccio d’ Agnolo, whose carved chairs, tables, chests, and
beds were the glory of Florentine homes; and nameless other workers in
the minor arts. Florence was so rich in art that she could bear the
depredations of invaders, pontiffs, and millionaires</p>
<p>CHAP, v) SAVONAROLA AND THE REPUBLIC 169</p>
<p>from Charles VIII to our own times, and still retain so much of
delicate workmanship that no man has ever compassed all the treasures
deposited in that one city by the two centuries of the Renaissance. Or
by one century; for just as the great age of Florence in art had begun
with Cosimo’s return from exile in 1434, so it ended with Andrea del
Sarto’s death in 1530. Civil strife, Savonarola’s puritan regime, siege
and defeat and plague, had de - stroyed the joyful spirit of Lorenzo’s
day, had broken the frail lyre of art.</p>
<p>But the great chords had been struck, and their music echoed
throughout the peninsula. Orders came to Florentine artists from other
Italian cities, even from France, Spain, Hungary, Germany, and Turkey.
To Florence flocked a thousand artists to learn her lore and form their
styles — Piero della Francesca, Perugino, Raphael…. From Florence a
hundred artists took the gospel of art to half a hundred Italian cities
and to foreign lands. In those half-hundred cities the spirit and taste
of the age, the generosity of wealth, the heritage of technique worked
together with the Florentine stimulus. Presently all Italy, from the
Alps to Calabria, was painting, carv- ing, building, composing, singing,
in a creative frenzy that seemed to know, in the fever of its haste,
that soon the wealth would vanish in war, and the pride of Italy would
be humbled under an alien tyranny, and the prison doors of dogma would
close again upon the marvelous exuberant mind of Renaissance man.</p>
