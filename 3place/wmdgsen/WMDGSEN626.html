<h4 id="chapter-xxxi-german-literature">CHAPTER XXXI German
Literature</h4>
<p>1789-1815</p>
<p>I. REVOLUTION AND RESPONSE</p>
<p>T HE German literature of the age of Napoleon was affected by the na-
tural rebelliousness of youth, the lingering waves of Sturm und Drang,
the echoes of English Romantic poetry and Richardson’s novels, the
classi - cal tradition in Lessing and the later Goethe, the successful
revolt of the American colonies, the heresies of the French
Enlightenment, above all by the daily impact of the French Revolution,
and, toward the end, by the drama of Napoleon’s rise and fall. Many
educated Germans had read— some in French — works by Voltaire, Diderot,
and Rousseau, and a lesser number had felt the sting of Helvetius,
d’Holbach, and La Mettrie. The French philosophes had helped to form
rulers like Frederick the Great, Joseph II of Austria, Duke Charles
William Ferdinand of Brunswick, and Duke Charles Augustus of
Saxe-Weimar; and, if only through these men, those writers had left
their mark on German civilization. The French Revolution seemed, at
first, a logical development of the Enlightenment philosophy: a happy
end to feudalism and class privileges, a lusty proclamation of universal
human rights, an invigorating liberation of speech, press, worship,
conduct, and thought. These ideas — many of them independently developed
in Germany — crossed the Rhine on the wings of news or with the armies
of the Revolu- tion, and swept over the heartland of Europe even to
distant Konigsberg.</p>
<p>So the molders of the German mind, and the makers of German
literature, welcomed the French Revolution in its first three years.
Gentlemen Free- masons, mystic Rosicrucians, proud Illuminati, hailed it
as the dawn of the golden age they had awaited so long arid ardently.
Peasants staged revolts against feudal lords, “Imperial Knights,” and
the episcopal rulers of Trier and Speyer. 1 Bourgeois Hamburg applauded
the Revolution as an uprising of businessmen against arrogant
aristocrats. Klopstock, the old poet domi- ciled in Hamburg, read his
poems at a festival of freedom, and cried with joy over his lines.
Scholars, journalists, poets, and philosophers broke out in a cappella
hymns of praise. Johann Voss, translator of Homer, Johannes von Muller,
historian, Friedrich von Gentz, diplomat at large, Friedrich Holder-
lin, poet, Friedrich Schleiermacher, theologian, the philosophers from
Kant to Hegel — all sang litanies to the Revolution. “It is glorious,”
wrote Georg Forster (who had accompanied Captain Cook around the world),
“to see</p>
<p>619</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>what philosophy has ripened in the brain and realized in the state.”
2 Every - where, even in the ranks of royalty (as in Prince Henry,
surviving brother of Frederick the Great), Germany, for an ecstatic
while, raised lauds to revolutionary France. In that ecstasy German
literature, after so long hiber- nating from religious strife, adding
the Revolution to the victories of Fred- erick, rose in thirty years
(1770-1800) to such vigor, diversity, and bril- liance as to rival the
ripe literatures of England and France. And that revival, astonishing in
its pace, went to play its part in rousing Germany to throw off the yoke
of France, and enter into the politically, industrially, scientifi-
cally, philosophically richest century in its history.</p>
<p>Of course that joyous mood did not last. Stories came of the assault
upon the Tuileries, of the September Massacres and the Terror, of the
imprison- ment and execution of the King and the Queen. Then came the
French oc- cupation of German states, the mounting levies of money and
men to pay for imperial protection and the martial cost of spreading
liberty. Year by year German fervor for the Revolution waned, and one by
one the defend- ers (excepting Kant) turned into disillusioned skeptics,
and some of them into angry foes.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>WEIMAR</li>
</ol>
<p>The men who made a constellation of genius at the court of Weimar
served as an intellectual anchor for the wits of Germans during the
unset- tling impact of the Revolution and Napoleon. Duke Charles
Augustus him- self was a volatile mixture of talents and moods. He
inherited the duchy at the age of one, and became its actual ruler at
eighteen (1775). He derived his general education from a tutor, and
further instruction from the respon- sibilities of administration, the
whims of a mistress, the dangers of war and the hunt. Not the least of
his schools was the salon of his mother. There he met poets, generals,
scientists, philosophers, divines, and men of affairs, to- gether with
some of the most cultivated but undenatured women of Ger- many, who
seasoned their ancestral wisdom with wit and charm, and counted that day
lost which had not been warmed with some discreet amour. “Ah, here we
have women!” reported Jean Paul Richter. “Everything is revolutionarily
daring here; that a woman is married signifies nothing.” 3</p>
<p>In 1772 the Duchess (herself a model of cheerful virtue) invited
the</p>
<p>scholar, poet, and novelist Christoph Wieland to come and tutor her
sons Charles Augustus and Konstantin.* He fulfilled his duties with
modesty and competence, and remained at Weimar till his death. He was
fifty-six when the Revolution came; he welcomed it, but (in a
“Cosmopolitan Address”</p>
<ul>
<li>The four men brought to witness in this section — mostly with the
help of the late George Gooch’s scholarly Germany and the French
Revolution (1966)— have been dealt with in Rousseau and Revolution:
Wieland (1733-1813) in pp. 553-76; Herder (1744-1803) in pp. 567-69 and
577-80; Schiller (1759-1805) in pp. 569-75 and 591-605; and Goethe
(1749-1832) in pp. 555-628.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXXl) GERMAN LITERATURE 62 I</p>
<p>of October, 1789), he asked the National Assembly of France to guard
against mob rule:</p>
<p>The nation is suffering from liberty fever, which makes the Parisians
— the politest people in the world — thirst for the blood of
aristocrats…. When the people, sooner or later, comes to itself, will it
not see that it is led by the nose by 1,200 petty tyrants, instead of
being governed by a king?… Yet you cannot be more deeply convinced than
1 that your nation was wrong to bear such misgovernment so long; that
the best form of government is the separation and equilibrium of the
executive, legislative, and judiciary; that every people has an
indefeasible right to as much freedom as can coexist with order; and
that each must be taxed in proportion to his income. 4</p>
<p>In 1791 he wrote that he had never expected his dream of political
jus- tice to be so nearly realized as in the person of Louis XVI. 5 The
execution of the King in January, 1792, turned him against the
Revolution; the Terror sickened him. Later in that year he published
“Words in Season,” which reached some modest conclusions: “One must go
on preaching, till men lis - ten, that mankind can grow happier only by
becoming more reasonable and more moral Reform must begin not with
constitutions but with the indi-</p>
<p>vidual. The conditions of happiness are in our own hands.” 6</p>
<p>Johann Gottfried von Herder — the last of the Weimar quartet to
settle there and the first to die — commended the Revolution till the
Queen was guillotined; thereafter he renounced the Revolution as a cruel
abortion of humane ideals. In his final years he recovered hope; despite
its dementia praecox the Revolution, he felt, marked an advance only
second to the Reformation irt the history of modern Europe; it would end
feudal owner- ship of bodies as the Reformation had ended papal power
over minds; now men would lay less stress on birth and rank; ability,
wherever born, would be free to develop and create. The advance,
however, would cost Europe dearly, and Herder was glad that the
experiment had been made in France rather than in his beloved Germany,
where men did not so soon take fire and burn up, but where quiet labor
and patient scholarship would guide the growth of youth with a mild but
steady and spreading light.</p>
<p>Friedrich Schiller — the Romantic soul fondly guarded by the
classic</p>
<p>hree — had come to Weimar (1795) after exciting ventures in drama,
poetry, history, and philosophy. Romantically imaginative, painfully
sensitive, he had found little to love in the Wiirttemberg of his youth.
He responded to oppression by worshiping Rousseau, and writing a
revolutionary play. Karl Moor, hero of Die Rduber (1781), denounced the
exploitation of man by man with an ardor that left nothing for Marx to
add but scholarship. Still more revolutionary was Schiller’s third play,
Kabale und Lie be ( Cabal and Love, 1784); it exposed the corruption,
extravagance, and fierce tenure of unearned privilege, and praised the
steady, patient, and productive life of the German bourgeoisie. In the
best of his pre-Revolution dramas, Don Car- los (1787), Schiller, now
twenty-eight, appealed less to the wrath of the poor than to some
potential nobility in power; he put into the mouth of Marquis Posa lines
summoning Philip II to be the “father of his people,” to</p>
<p>622</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>“let happiness flow from your horn of plenty,” to “let man’s mind
ripen in your vast empire, to become, amid a thousand kings, a king
indeed.” 7 Passing from youth to middle age, Schiller naturally passed
from radi- calism to liberalism. He discovered ancient Greece, and was
deepened by its dramatists. He read Kant, and dulled his poetry with
philosophy. In 1787 he visited Weimar, was excited by its women, and
calmed by Wieland and Herder. (Goethe was then in Italy.) In 1788 he
published Geschichte des Abfalls der Vereinigten Niederlande (. History
of the Revolt of the United Netherlands ), and checked his philosophy
with history. In 1789, on Goethe’s recommendation to the Duke of
Saxe-Weimar, Schiller was appointed pro- fessor of history at Jena. In
October of that year he wrote to a friend: “It is a petty ideal to write
for a single nation; and for a philosopher such a bar- rier is
intolerable…. The historian can only kindle for a nation insofar as it
is an essential element in the progress of civilization.” 8</p>
<p>When the news of the Revolution reached Jena it found Schiller enjoy-
ing a middle-age spread of income and outlook, public acceptance, and
tol- erant understanding. His correspondence with Goethe, across the
gaps of twelve miles in space and ten years in age, had helped the poet
in Goethe to survive the prose of administration and the cautions of
prosperity, and had helped Schiller to realize that human nature has
changed too little in history to make political revolutions profitable
for the poor. He sympathized with the King and Queen captured at
Versailles in 1789, arrested in Varennes in 1791, and evicted from their
prison palace in 1792. Shortly thereafter the revolutionary Convention
unanimously conferred upon “le sieur Gilles” the title of citoyen
frangais. A week later the September Massacres an- nounced the
sovereignty of an armed crowd; in December Louis XVI was put on trial.
Schiller began to write a pamphlet in his defense; before he could
finish it the King had been guillotined.</p>
<p>Goethe smiled at the vicissitudes of his fr iend’s political faith,
but he himself had traveled far from the certainties of his youth. He
had had an ample fling with women sweet and sour before being invited in
1775, aged twenty-six, to leave Frankfurt and five in Weimar as Duke
Charles Augus- t us’ poet in ordinary and comrade in both forms of
venery. During the next twelve years he absorbed economic and political
realities, and grew apace; the Romantic author of Die Leiden des jungen
Werthers (1774) disap- peared in the privy councilor who saw a new age
in European history take form at Valmy in 1792. The disorderly
deterioration of the Revolution in that year led him to conclude that
slow reforms under “enlightened despots” touched by philosophy — and
under local rulers of education and goodwill like his own Duke of Weimar
— would cost the people less than a sudden overturn in which the
precarious bases and habits of social order might col- lapse into a
decade of passion and violence. One of his Venetian Epigrams had
expressed this fear as early as 1790:</p>
<p>Let our rulers take warning betimes from France’s misfortune;</p>
<p>■ But, men of little degree, you should take warning still more.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>GERMAN LITERATURE</p>
<p>Great men go to destruction; but who gives the people protection</p>
<p>When the rough mob becomes tyrant over us all?</p>
<p>He applauded when Napoleon ended the chaos of the Revolution by
seizing power and establishing a constitution that allowed the people to
enjoy an occasional plebiscite without too much interference with a
decisive and com- petent government. His appreciation of the Corsican
was not diminished by Napoleon’s flattering reception of him at Erfurt
in 1807; and the report of that interview shared considerably in giving
the poet-councilor an inter- national reputation.</p>
<p>Some Romantic tremors persisted beneath his developing classic
steadi- ness of judgment and taste. Faust , Part I (1808) was a love
story as well as a medieval “morality”; and Elective Affinities (1809)
seemed to justify the rising cry of the new generation for mating by
mutual attraction rather than by parental finance or legal bond. The
councilor become philosopher con- tinued to flutter about young women
even after reaching threescore years and ten. But his studies of ancient
art in Italy, his developing interest in science, his reading of
Spinoza, and his declining physical vigor made for unhurried judgment
and a wide-ranging view. The change was pronounced in his autobiography
(1811), which looked upon its hero with remarkable objectivity. Romantic
Germany — agitated by the emotional Wackenroder and Novalis, the
free-love Schlegels, the insane Holderlin, and the mercy- killer-suicide
Kleist — resented his rising criticism of the French Revolution, and
hardly noticed that he had belabored the ruling class too. During the
German War of Liberation he found it hard to hate Napoleon and the
French. He explained to Eckermann:</p>
<p>How could I, to whom culture and barbarism are alone of importance,
hate a nation which is among the most cultivated on earth, and to which
I owe so great a part of my own possessions? There is a stage where
national hatred vanishes altogether, and where one stands to a certain
extent above the nations, and feels the weal or woe of a neighboring
people as if it were one’s own. 9</p>
<p>His generation in Germany never forgave him, and seldom read him. It
ranked Schiller above him, 10 and preferred Kotzebue to either. 11
Goethe’s plays were seldom performed at Weimar, and his publishers
deplored the poor sale of his collected works. Nevertheless an
Englishman, Lord Byron, in 1820, dedicated Marino Faliero to him as “by
far the first literary char ac- ter which has existed in Europe since
the death of Voltaire.” 12 He could not bear to read Kant, but he was
the wisest man of his time.</p>

<li>THE LITERARY SCENE</li>
</ol>
<p>Germany was busy, as never before, writing, printing, and publishing
newspapers, periodicals, books. In 1796 Aloys Senefelder, at Munich,
stum- bled upon the process later called lithography, by scratching his
mother’s laundry list upon a stone; it occurred to him that words and
pictures, in</p>
<p>624</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>various colors, could be engraved or embossed (in reverse as in a
mirror) upon a smooth stone or metal plate, from which innumerable
copies could be printed. Hence rose an ocean of prints from Goya and
Hiroshige to Cur- rier and Ives and Picasso.</p>
<p>Newspapers were many, small, partisan, and censored. The Allgemeine
Zeitung, founded at Tubingen in 1798, moved to Stuttgart, then to Ulm,
then to Augsburg, then to Munich, to escape the local police. The
Kolnische Zeitung, established in 1804, had a quieter career, being
patriotically Catho- lic, and then Napoleonic. Berlin, Vienna, Leipzig,
Frankfurt, Nuremberg had journals antedating the Revolution, and still
serving time today. Periodi- cals abounded. We have noted one of the
finest, the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, published at Leipzig by the
firm of Breitkopf and Hartel from one revolution to another, 1795 to
1849. The most brilliant was the Athen’dum, founded by the Schlegel
brothers in 1798. Publishers were numerous. The annual exhibition of
their products made the Leipzig book fair the</p>
<p>event of the year.</p>
<p>A special class of writers, loosely classed as publicists, earned
wide influ- ence by their vigorously partisan but well-informed
discussion of the basic issues of the age. Friedrich von Gentz
(1764-1832) hailed the fall of the Bastille, but cooled when he met the
skeptical mind of Wilhelm von Hum- boldt, and read and translated
Burke’s Reflections on the French Revoluti on. Having risen in the
Prussian civil service to be a counselor in the War Min- istry, he led a
literary campaign against such ideas as the rights of man, liberty and
equality, sovereignty of the people, and liberty of the press. He was
not appeased b y Napoleon’s taming of the Revolution. He attacked Na -
poleon as a militarist whose conquests were destroying that balance of
power upon which, in the view of most diplomats, the peace, order, and
sanity of Europe depended. He became the most eloquent of the voices
urg- ing the King of Prussia to lead a crusade against Napoleon, and
when Fred- erick William III hesitated Gentz passed into the service of
Austria (1802). After Napoleon overwhelmed the Austrians at Austerlitz
Gentz took refuge in Bohemia, but in 1809 he was back in Vienna,
promoting the new war upon Napoleon. He served as secretary and aide to
Mettemich at the Con- gress of Vienna, and supported him in the postwar
diplomacy of crushing every liberal development. He lived on, old and
ill, through the revolts of 1830, and died convinced that he had served
well the interests of mankind.</p>
<p>Joseph von Gorres was a more sensitive spirit, half Italian and all
emo- tion, hardly fit for a rough arena crowded with gladiators of the
pen. Born a Catholic, he left the Church to support the Revolution. He
helped in the French conquest of the left bank of the Rhine, and
applauded Napoleon’s transformation of the Holy Roman Empire into the
Rheinbund. He hailed the French occupation of Rome with t he cry “Rome
is free.” But the arro - gance of the French troops, the exactions of
the French administrators, aroused the resentment of the young
revolutionary. In 1798 he founded a frail journal, Das rothes Blatt (
The Red Leaf), as the voice of a republican loving the Revolution but
distrusting the French. He recognized in Napo-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl) GERMAN LITERATURE 625</p>
<p>leon’s seizure of the French government the end of the Revolution,
and in Napoleon himself a dangerous appetite for power. He married, and
took a vacation from politics. When Germany rose to her War of
Liberation, Gorres joined in the campaign with a newspaper, the
Rheinische Merkur, but when, after Napoleon’s removal, the victors
enforced political reaction wherever they could, Gorres attacked them so
vigorously that he had to take refuge in Switzerland, where he lived in
extreme poverty. All other lights having failed him, he returned in sad
repentance to the Catholic Church (1824). Ludwig I of Bavaria raised him
from indigence by appoint- ing him professor of history at Munich.
There, writing his four-volume Christliche Mystik (1836-42), he solaced
his days with imaginative schol- arship, and darkened his nights with
satanic visions. Thirty-four years after his death the Gorres
Gesellschaft was established (1876) to continue his re- searches in the
history of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>Prose literature was dominated by the Romantics, but one writer
eluded them and remained indefinable and unique. Jean Paul Richter began
life in Bayreuth in 1763. He took his Christian names from a
grandfather, Johann Paul Kuhn; till 1793 he was simply Hans. His father
was a schoolteacher and organist who became pastor of a church in Joditz
on the Saale. There Hans spent his first thirteen years in a happiness
from which he never re- covered; that simple rural place marked his mood
through all economic worries and theological storms. When the family
moved to Schwarzenbach, on the same quiet river, he enjoyed the library
of a neighboring clergyman, who recognized the boy’s possibilities but
not his doubts. There Richter’s father died (1779), leaving his numerous
brood to short rations. At twenty Hans entered the school of theology at
Leipzig; but his reading had weak- ened his faith; he soon withdrew, and
gave hostages to fortune by under- taking to live by his pen. He reached
publication in 1783, aged twenty, then not again till 1789, in both
cases with a brand of satire that seasoned sympa- thy with caustic wit.
In 1793 he issued Die unsichtbare Loge ( The Invisible Lodge ) under the
pseudonym “Jean Paul,” taken through love of Rousseau. The book pleased
a small audience, which grew with his sentimental novel Hesperus (1795).
Charlotte von Kalb, friend of Schiller, invited the rising author to
Weimar, and was so well pleased with him that she became his mistress.
13 There he began his four-volume novel Titan (1800-03), whose real hero
was the French Revolution.</p>
<p>He passionately defended it in its formative years, but charged Marat
with corrupting it into mob rule, and praised Charlotte Corday as
another Jeanne d’Arc. He welcomed Napoleon’s seizure of power as a
necessary restoration of order; he could not help admiring this youth of
thirty, who had nothing but iron will and laser eyes with which to lower
the towering stature of his subordinates. Eight years later Richter was
quite willing to see all Europe united by this man who could hold a
continent in his mind and hand, and legislate for France from Berlin and
Moscow. But at heart Jean Paul remained a republican, seeing in every
martial victory the seed of another war. He pitied the conscripted
youths and the mourning families,</p>
<p>626</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>and argued that “the people alone should decide ion war, as they
alone cull its bitter fruits.” He shot one of his sharpest shafts at
rulers who sold their troops to foreign potentates, He demanded freedom
from censorship, for some power outside of the government should be free
to expose that gov- ernment’s faults and to explore, the possibilities
of progress. 14</p>
<p>In 1801, aged thirty-eight, Jean Paul took a wife, and in 1804 he
settled down in Bayreuth. After some living experiments he wrote a book
on educa- tion, Levana, one of the classics of libertarian pedagogy. He
issued a stream of novels and essays, some of which were admiringly
translated by Carlyle. His mixture of realistic satire and Romantic
sentiment won him a larger reading public than Goethe’s or Schiller’s.
He died in 1825, leaving unfin - ished an essay on the immortality of
the soul; his time had come to explore the matter at first hand. His
reputation as one of Germ any’s foremost au - thors survived in Europe
till the middle of the nineteenth century; and after it had died there
it migrated to America, where Longfellow wste.one of his devotees.
Hardly anyone, even in Germany, reads him today; biit nearly every
German recalls his famous epigram, which aims a shaft at German
philosophy, and sums up the age of Napoleon more briefly than this book:
“Providence has given to the English the empire of the sea, to the
French that of the land, and to the Germans that of the air.” 15</p>
<p>Two other writers of fiction won a wide audience. Ernst Theodor Wil-
helm Hoffmann (1776-1822) — who in 1 8 1 3 , in ecstasy over Mozart,
changed “Wilhelm” to “Amadeus”— was one of the most unusual and
versatile of all Germans: he painted pictures, composed and conducted
music, staged an opera {Undine), practiced law, and wrote stories of
mystery and romance which inspired Jacques Offenbach’s Tales of Hoffmann
(1881). Unique in life, if not in letters, was Adelbert von Chamisso
(1781-1838). Born a French nobleman, he fled from the Revolution,
received most of his school- ing in Germany, enlisted in a Prussian
regiment, and fought in the battle of Jena. In 1813, haunted by his lack
of a fatherland and by his divided loyal- ties in the War of Liberation,
he wrote, as an allegory, Peter Schlemihls vmndersame Geschichte, the
bizarre tale of a man who had sold his shadow to Satan. As a botanist of
established reputation he accompanied Otto von Kotzebue’s scientific
voyage around the world (1815 -18); he recorded his findings in the once
famous Reise um die Welt. He divided the remainder of his life between
serving as curator of Berlin’s Botanical Garden and writ - ing Romantic
poetry. Heinrich Heine praised the poems, and Robert Schu- mann put to
music Chamisso’s verse sequence Frauenliebe und -leben.</p>
<p>Poets abounded, many of them still cherished by the German people,
but gifting their words with music and sentiment difficult to transmit
to another language, land, or time. Pitiful among them was Friedrich
Holderlin (1770-</p>
<p>1843), whose poetic sensitivity proved too keen for his sanity. Sent
to Tubingen to study for the ministry, he developed a stimulating
friendship with Georg Hegel, who was then questioning Christianity. News
of the French Revolution excited the youth to visions of human
happiness. He read</p>

<p>627</p>
<p>Rousseau, composed a “Hymn to Liberty,” and in 1792, over the top of
the dying century, he thought he saw a wonderful dawn of justice and no-
bility. When war broke out he wrote to his sister: “Pray for the French,
the champions of human rights.” When the Revolution foundered in blood,
he clung desperately to his dream:</p>
<p>My love is the human race — not, of course, the corrupt, servile,
idle race that we too often meet. I love the great, fine possibilities,
even in a corrupt people. I love the race of the centuries to come…. We
live in a time when everything is working toward amelioration. These
seeds of enlightenment, these silent wishes and strivings toward the
education of the race,… will yield glorious fruit. This is the sacred
goal of my wishes and my activity — to plant the seeds which will ripen
in another generation. 16</p>
<p>The past too allowed for dreams. Like his contemporary Keats he fell
in love with the heroes and divinities of classic Greece, and began a
prose epic, Hyperion , about a Greek revolutionist. He made his way to
Jena, studied under Fichte, learned to revere Kant, and met the gods of
Weimar when they too were Hellenizing. Schiller secured a post for him
as tutor to a son of Charlotte von Kalb. In 1796 he found a richer
tutorial berth in the home of the banker J. F. Gotthard at
Frankfurt-am-Main. He fell in love with the banker’s wife, who so
’appreciated his verses that he was dismissed and forced to leave the
city. The ecstasy and the exile brought on a degree of mental
derangement; yet at this time (1799) he wrote a fragment, Der Tod des
Empedokles, which is among the masterpieces of German verse. For several
years he wandered from town to town, seeking bread and themes. He asked
Schiller to recommend him for a lectureship in Greek literature, but
Schiller found him too unstable for a professorial chair. Tutoring at
Bor- deaux, Holderlin received word that Mme. Gotthard had died. He left
his employment and walked across France into Germany, where friends,
seeing that he was mentally deranged beyond cure, took care of him
(1802). He lived on till 1843, his poems long forgotten even by himself.
They were re- stored to public attention in 1890; Rainer Maria Rilke and
Stefan George acclaimed him; and now the cognoscenti rank him only below
Goethe and Schiller.</p>
<p>Many others sang. Karl Theodor Komer (1791-1813), son of the Chris-
tian Gottfried Korner who had been so helpful to Schiller, 17 threw
himself, pen and sword, into the War of Liberation from Napoleon,
aroused the Germans with his call to arms, and died in battle, August
26, 18.13.-_ Ernst Moritz Arndt (1769-1860) lived through three
revolutions in his ninety-one years. He secured the abolition of
feudalism in Pomerania by describing it realistically in V ersuche einer
Geschichte {Essays toward a History, 1803); and in Die Geist der Xeit
(1806) he sounded so powerful a cry against Na- poleon that he was
forced to take refuge in Sweden from the victor of Jena. In 1812 he was
called to St. Petersburg by Stein to help stir the Russian peo- ple to
throw back the French invaders. After 1815, in Prussia, he strove to
counter the conservative reaction, and was briefly jailed. In 1848 he
was elected to the national assembly at Frankfurt. When that revolution

Eichendorff (1788-1857), a Catholic nobleman, wrote simple lyrics that
can still move us, like “Auf meines Kindes Tod” (On the Death of My

<li>THE ROMANTIC ECSTASY</li>
</ol>
<p>The most brilliant writers of this German heyday were those who
startled their time with cries for the emancipation of instinct from
reason, of feeling from intellect, of youth from age, of the individual
from the family and the state. Few of us read them today, but in their
generation they were tongues of flame setting fire to dry-as-dust
philosophies and social bonds imprisoning the expanding self in use and
wont, taboo, command, and law.</p>
<p>The source of the revolt was the natural resentment with which any
vital adolescent views the restraints imposed by parents, brothers,
sisters, teachers, preachers, policemen, grammarians, logicians,
moralists. Had not the current philosopher, Fichte, proved that the
basic reality for each of us is his indi- vidual conscious self? If that
is so, the universe has no meaning for any of us except in its effects
upon himself, and each of us may justly sit in judg- ment upon every
tradition, prohibition, law, or creed and bid it show cause why it
should be obeyed. One might fearfully submit to commandments issued and
upheld by God, or by a man of God dressed in divinity; but what had
become of God now that Diderot, d’Alembert, Helvetius, d’Holbach, La
Mettrie, had reduced him to the impersonal laws of the universe?</p>
<p>To the proud and liberating Enlightenment had now been added the
Revolution. Class divisions were melting away; those lords who had once
given laws and exacted obedience were now in hectic flight, leaving no
barrier between classes, no bogey of tradition to buttress laws; now
every man was free to compete for any place or power, chancing the
guillotine; career was open to talent, to talons. Never before, in the
known history of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>GERMAN LITERATURE</p>
<p>6 29</p>
<p>civilization, had the individual been so free — free to choose his
occupation, his enterprise, his mate, his religion, his government, his
moral code. If nothing exists but individual entities, what is the
state, the army, the Church, the university, but conspiracies of
privileged individuals to frighten and control, to form and deform, to
rule and tax, to herd to slaughter the indoc- trinated rest? Rare is the
genius that can come to fulfillment under such restraints. And yet is
not one genius worth a dozen pedagogues, generals, pontiffs, kings, or a
hundred crowds?</p>
<p>However, in the new free-for-all, among the liberated souls, there
were many sensitive spirits who felt that reason had exacted too high a
price for liberation. It was “reason” that had attacked the old
religion, with its saintly legends, its fragrant ceremonies and moving
music, its mediating Madonna and its saving Christ; it was “reason” that
had replaced this exalted vision with a dismal procession of masses of
matter moving aimlessly to destruc- tion; and it was “reason” that
replaced the picture of men and women living in daily contact with deity
by a view of male and female masses of matter moving daily nearer,
automatically, stupidly, to a painful, degrading, and everlasting death.
Imagination has its rights, even though unsanctioned by syllogisms; and
we can more readily and justly think of ourselves as souls dominating
matter than as machines operating souls. Feeling has its rights, and
delves more deeply than intellect; poor wandering, wondering Jean-
Jacques may have felt more wisely than the brilliant imp of Ferney
thought.</p>
<p>Germany had known and heard both Rousseau and Voltaire, and was
choosing Rousseau. It had read and felt Smile and Helo’ise, and
preferred them to the Philosophical Dictionary and Candide. It followed
Lessing in putting romantic Shakespeare above classic Racine; it took
more readily to Clarissa Harlowe, Tristram Shandy and Macpherson’s
“Ossian” than to the</p>
<p>German Romanticism respected truth if this could be found, but it was
suspicious of “scientific truth” that darkened the face of life. It kept
a warm place in its memory for the myths and fables and fairy tales that
Clemens Brentano (1778-1842) and Achim von Arnim (1781-1831) were
gathering into Des Knaben W underhorn (1805-08), and that the brothers
Grimm (Jacob, 1785-1863, and Wilhelm, 1786-1859) were collecting for
their Kinder- und Hausmdrchen (1812); these echoes of the nation’s and
the indi - vidual’s childhood were a part of the good German’s soul,
perhaps of his “subconscious” self.</p>
<p>If that heritage of the imagination led back beyond the Revolution to
medieval Catholicism, the spirit of romance would follow it to the mossy
old cathedrals and the unquestioning faith and merry artisans that had
raised them; to the prayers and chants and bells and processions that
brought deity daily into human life, and merged the tired individualist
restfully with the group; to the saints whose lives made a sacred epic
of the Christian calendar;</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>o the Virgin Mother who had sanctified the maiden’s wise innocence
and the matron’s d edication to the family, the nation, and the race.
All this, of course, was an enthusiastic blurring of medieval faiths and
terrors, of hunted heretics and haunted souls; but it brought many
German Romantics to the peak of their fervor, and some of them, in
exhaustion and penitence, to the foot of the altar and into the warm
embrace of Mother Church.</p>
<p>V. THE VOICES OF FEELING</p>
<p>German Romanticism affected almost every phase of the nation’s life:
music in Beethoven, Weber, and Felix Mendelssohn; the novel in Hoffmann
and Tieck; philosophy in Fichte and Schelling; religion in
Schleiermacher and a hundred such conversions as those of Friedrich
Schlegel and Dorothea Mendelssohn. Five men in particular led the
movement in German literature; and we should commemorate with them the
Romantic women who snared or shared them in love free or bound, and in
an intellectual companionship that shocked modest matrons from one
Frankfurt to the Oder.</p>
<p>Flickering near the fountainhead of the movement was Wilhelm Heinrich
Wackenroder (1773-98), frail and shy, uneasy with reality and reason,
com- forted with religion, happy with art. In the artist’s power of
conception and execution he saw an almost godlike faculty of creation.
He phrased his new religion in worshipful essays on Leonardo, Raphael,
Michelangelo, Diirer… At the Universities of Gottingen and Erlangen he
found support from Ludwig Tieck; this enthusiastic fellow student
proposed a jolly title for his friend’s writings: Herzensergiessungen
eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders (Heart Outpourings of an Art-loving
Christian Brother). So christened, it found a publisher in 1797.
Wackenroder ridiculed the rationalism of Lessing and the classicism of
Winckelmann almost as much as the impermeability of the German bourgeois
soul to artistic exaltation, and he summoned his time to recapture the
medieval brotherhood of artist and workman under their common name of
artisan. Typhoid ended Wackenroder’s life at the age of twenty-four.</p>
<p>His friend Tieck (1773-1853) played through eighty years the
risky</p>
<p>game of feeling versus reason, of imagination versus reality.
Together with Wackenroder he studied Elizabethan drama and medieval art,
and rejoiced over the fall of the Bastille. Unlike Wackenroder he had a
sense of humor and a flair for play; he felt that life was a game played
by the gods with kings and queens, bishops and knights, castles and
cathedrals and humble pawns. Returning to his native Berlin after his
university days, he published in 1795-96 a three-volume novel, Die
Geschichte des Herrn William Lovell, written in Richardsonian letter
form, and describing in sensuous detail the sexual and intellectual
wanderings of a young man who has emptied the Christian ethic with the
Christian theology, and who concludes from the Fichtean epistemology
that if the self is the only reality directly known to us, it should be
lord of morals and doctor of laws:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>GERMAN LITERATURE</p>
<p>631</p>
<p>All things exist only because I think them; virtue exists only
because I think it…. In truth, lust is the great secret of our
existence. Poetry, art, even religion, are lust in disguise. The works
of the sculptor, the figures of the poet, the paintings before which
devoutness kneels, are nothing but intro- ductions to sensuous
enjoyment….</p>
<p>I pity the fools who are forever babbling about the depravity of our
senses. Blind wretches, they offer sacrifice to an impotent deity, whose
gifts cannot satisfy a human heart…. No, I have pledged myself to the
service of a higher deity, before which all living nature bows, which
unites in itself every feeling, which is rapture, love, everything….
Only in the embraces of Louisa have I come to know what love is; the
memory of Amelia appears to me now in a dim, misty distance. 18</p>
<p>Here, eighty-five years before The Brothers Karamazov (1880), is Ivan
Karamazov’s fateful preview of the amoral century that was to follow
him: “If there is no God, everything is permitted.” However, Lovell
returns to religion before his end: “The most reckless freethinker,” he
explains, “at last becomes a worshiper.” 19 In his case just in time,
for soon after this con - fession Lovell is killed in a duel.</p>
<p>The book was the boast of a youth liberated before reaching the age
of reason. In 1797 he published a short story, “Der blonde Eckhert,”
which won the admiration of the brothers Schlegel. At their invitation
he moved to Jena, which was now the Romantic citadel; Tieck, however,
left in 1801 to live on a friend’s estate in Frankfurt -an-der-Oder. He
devoted himself for a time to translating Elizabethan plays; then to
editing, with brilliant critiques, the works of his contemporaries
Novalis and Kleist. Following in Lessing’s steps, he filled for
seventeen years ( 1 82 5-42 ), the pilloried post of Dramaturg —
dramatic critic and manager — at the Dresden Theater; his forthright
essays there brought him some enemies, but also a national renown second
only to Goethe’s and August von Schlegel’s in the field of literary
criticism. In 1 842 King Frederick William IV (who had never heard of
Lovell ) invited him to Berlin; Tieck (having long outlived Lovell)
accepted, and spent his re- maining years as a pillar of literature in
the Prussian capital.</p>
<p>Novalis (1772-1801) was not. given so many years in which to recover
from the ideas of his youth. He had, for literature, the uncertain
advantage of noble birth: his father, director of the salt works in
Saxony, was cousin to Prince Karl von Hardenberg, of the Prussian
ministry. The poet’s real name was Freiherr Georg Friedrich Philipp von
Hardenberg; he used “Novalis” as a pseudonym, but it had been the actual
name of his ancestors in the thirteenth century. His family belonged to
the Herrnhut community of Pietists; he held to their strong religious
bent, but toward the end he sought a reconciliation of Catholicism with
Protestantism as a step toward European unity. In his nineteenth year he
entered the University of Jena, developed a warm friendship with Tieck,
Schiller, and Friedrich von Schle- gel, and probably took some of
Fichte’s courses, which were scattering sparks from Jena to Weimar.</p>
<p>After a year at the University of Wittenberg he followed his father
into business at Arnstadt in Thuringia. At nearby Griiningen he met
Sophie von</p>
<p>632</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Kuhn, whose beauty of form and character so moved him that he asked
her parents for her hand in marriage. In 1795 he and Sophie were
formally en- gaged, though she was only fourteen. Soon thereafter she
fell ill of an in- curable ailment of the liver. Two operations further
weakened her, and in 1797 she died. Novalis never recovered from this
Liebestod. His most fa- mous poems, six Hymnen an die Nacht (1800), were
somber memories of Sophie. In 1798 he became engaged to Julie von
Charpentier, but this be- trothal too failed to reach marriage;
tuberculosis had joined with grief in consuming the poet; and on March
25, 1801, Novalis died, aged twenty- eight.</p>
<p>He left behind him a novel, Heinrich von Ofterdingen (1798-1800),</p>
<p>which gave intense expression to the longing for religious peace. He
had once praised Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister as a realistic yet wholesome
descrip - tion of a man’s development; now he condemned it as idealizing
a prosaic adjustment to earthly tasks. The hero of his own novel was
presented as an historical character, the real author of the
Nibelungenlied, a Galahad de- voted to pursuit of a blue flower
symbolizing the transformation of death into an opening to infinite
understanding. “It is the blue flower that I long to see,” says
Heinrich; “it lies constantly in my mind, and I can imagine and think of
nothing else.” 20 Here, and in a once famous essay on “Christendom in
Europe,” Novalis idealized the Middle Ages (even to defending the In -
quisition) as having realized Europe’s recurring aspiration— political
unity under one religious faith. It was (he felt) wise and right for the
Church to resist the growth of materialistic science and secular
philosophy; in this perspective the Enlightenment was a tragic setback
for the European soul. As death beckoned to him Novalis rejected all
earthly aims and delights, and dreamed of a coming life in which there
would be no sickness and no grief, and love would never end.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE BROTHERS SCHLEGEL</li>
</ol>
<p>August Wilhelm von Schlegel (1767-1845) and Friedrich von Schlegel
(1772-1829) made a remarkable brotherhood: different in temperament and
love, diverging in studies and creeds, and united at last in Sanskrit
and philology. Born in Hanover to a Protestant pastor, they became
theologians at puberty, and heretics at twenty. At Gottingen August
Wilhelm was charmed into studying the transmigrations of words by the
lectures and personality of Christian Heyne, translator of Virgil, and
into Elizabethan lore by Gottfried Burger, translator of Shakespeare and
author of the ballad Lenore. 21 The same university received Friedrich
von Schlegel five years after his brother; he began as a student of law,
and wandered into literature, art, and philosophy. He ripened rapidly,
joined his brother at Jena in 1796, and shared with him in founding the
Athendum, which for two years ( 1 798- 1 800) was the mouthpiece and
lodestar of the Romantic movement in Ger- many. Novalis and
Schleiermacher contributed; Tieck came; Fichte and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl) GERMAN LITERATURE 633</p>
<p>Schelling added their philosophies; and the lively circle was rounded
out by some talented women romantically free.</p>
<p>Friedrich von Schlegel was the intellectual pacemaker of the coterie,
if only because he moved faster than the others in adopting and
discarding ideas. In 1799 he issued a novel, Lucinde, which became a red
flag leading the attack upon aging creeds and troublesome taboos.
Theoretically it was (like Shelley’s Defence) a plea for the rights of
poetry as an interpreter and guide of life. How wise, for example, is
the poet’s scorn of the pursuit of riches? “Why this constant striving
and pushing without rest and repose? Industry and utility are the angels
of death.” 22 The hero proclaims also “the divine gospel of joy and
love,” by which he means the joy of loving without the bonds of
matrimony. When Friedrich tried to visit his brother, then teaching at
Gottingen (1800), the authorities at Hanover sent a worried order to t
he university rector: “Should the Professor’s brother, Friedrich
Schlegel, notorious for the immoral tendency of his writings, come to
Got- tingen, for the purpose of staying there for any time, this is not
to be per- mitted; you will be so good as to intimate to him that he
must leave the town.” 23</p>
<p>The woman who had served as Schlegel’s inspiration for Lucinde was
Caroline Michaelis. Born in 1763, she married a university professor
(1784), became unhappy with him, was freed by his death, and enjoyed for
several years the pleasures of a widow celebrated for both intellect and
beauty. Au- gust von Schlegel, while a student at Gottingen, fell in
love with her, and proposed marriage. She refused him as four years her
junior. When he left to tutor in Amsterdam (1791) she entered upon a
series of adventures, in one of which she was surprised with motherhood.
She joined a revolutionary group in Mainz, was arrested, was freed by
her parents, and went to Leipzig to give birth. There August von
Schlegel appeared, proposed again, mar- ried her (1796), adopted her
child, and went with them to Jena.</p>
<p>There her education, her vivacity, and her intelligent conversation
made her the favorite hostess of the liberals. Wilhelm von Humboldt
called her the cleverest woman he had ever known. 24 Goethe and Herder
came over from Weimar to sit at her table and enjoy her company. 28
Friedrich von Schlegel, who was then living with his brother, took his
turn falling in love with her. He made her the Lucinde of his novel, and
raised such paeans to her that his passion was suffocated with words.
Meanwhile August, whose passion had cooled to chivalry, went off to
lecture in Berlin (1801). There he formed an attachment with Sophie
Bernhardi, who divorced her hus- band to live with her new love.
Returning to Jena, August found Caroline enamored of Schelling, and
amiably agreed to a divorce. Caroline married Schelling (1804), and
stayed with him till her death (1809). Schelling, though he married
again, f elt her influence through many years. “Even if she had not been
to me what she was, I should mourn the human being, should lament that
this intellectual paragon no longer exists, this rare woman who, to
masculine strength of soul and the keenest intellect, united the ten-
derest, most womanly, loving heart.” 26</p>
<p>634 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Quite as remarkable was Dorothea von Schlegel (1763-1839), nee Bren-
del Mendelssohn. To please her famous father, she married in 1783 the
banker Simon Veit. She bore him a son, Philipp Veit, who became a promi-
nent painter in the next generation. Having plenty of money, she lost
inter- est in it, ventured into the still more uncertain game of
philosophy, and became an intellectual lumina ry in Rachel Vamhagen’s
salon in Berlin. There Friedrich von Schlegel found her, and straightway
fell in love with her; and she, who was enamored of ideas, found him
swimming in them. He was then twenty-five, she was thirty-two; but the
volatile author was capti- vated by the complex charms of this femme de
trente ans and more. She was not strikingly beautiful, but she gave him
a sustaining appreciation of his mind, she could accompany him
understandingly in his philosophical and philological explorations, and
she offered him a devotion that survived all quarrels till his death.
Her husband, feeling that she was lost to him, gave her a divorce
(1798). She lived contentedly in unregistered union with Schlegel,
accompanied him to Paris in 1802, accepted baptism, was renamed
Dorothea, and became Friedrich’s legal wife in 1804.</p>
<p>Brother August had by that time become the most famous lecturer on
the Continent, and had made progress with that remarkable translation of
Shakespeare which soon made the great Elizabethan almost as popular in
Germany as in England. Though August has been called “the founder of the
Romantic school in Germany,” 27 he had many qualities of the classic
mind and character: order, clarity, proportion, moderation, and a steady
procession toward a defined goal. His lectures “On Dramatic
Literature,”</p>
<p>Mme. de Stael, touring Germany in quest of material for a book, per-
suaded August ( 1 804) , for twelve thousand francs a year, to go with
her to Coppet as tutor for her children, and reference encyclopedia for
herself. Later he traveled with her in Italy, France, and Austria,
returned with her to Coppet, and stayed with her till 1811, when the
Swiss authorities, obey- ing Napoleon, ordered him to leave Switzerland.
He went to Vienna, and was surprised to find his brother lecturing there
on the Middle Ages as the golden era of European faith and unity.</p>
<p>Vienna was the Catholic capital of Germany, and Friedrich and
Dorothea had been converted to Catholicism in 1808. Years ago she had
said: “These pictures [of saints] and the Catholic music touch me so,
that I am deter- mined, if I become a Christian, to be a Catholic.” 29
Friedrich von Schlegel ascribed his own conversion to a “ predilection

<p>dividualist, lonely in the insecurity of self, turned to the Church
as a com- munal shelter and comforting home. So Friedrich von Schlegel,
cleverest of reasoners, the most ardent of the young individualists, the
most reckless of the rebels, turned now back of Voltaire, back of Luther
and Calvin, to medieval Europe and its omnipotent Church. He mourned the
replacement of inspiring myths with desolating science, and declared
that “the deepest want and deficiency of all modern art is the fact that
the artists have no mythology.” 30</p>
<p>Perhaps his respect for mythology had been widened by his researches
in the literature and myths of ancient India. Begun in Paris in 1802,
these re- searches had culminated in a scholarly and seminal treatise
Vber die Sprache und Weisheit der lnder (On the Language and Wisdom of
the Hindus,</p>
<p>1808), which shared in establishing the comparative philology of the
Indo- European languages. Presumably Friedrich discussed this aspect of
his life when his brother joined him for a while in the Vienna of 181 1.
August, re- calling his work with Christian Heyne in philology, resumed
his interest in that field; and the combined contribution of the
brothers to Sanskrit studies was the most solid and lasting result of
their lives.</p>
<p>Friedrich had made quite a place for himself in the cultural and
political life of Vienna. He had won a secretarial post in the Austrian
government, and had helped to write the anti-Napoleonic blast which
Archduke Karl Ludwig had issued as part of the 1809 campaign. In 1810
and 1812 he deliv- ered, in Vienna, outstanding lectures on European
history and literature; in these discourses he expounded his theories of
literary criticism and scholar- ship, and gave a classic analysis of
Romanticism. In 1820 he became editor of the right-wing Catholic journal
Concordia; his repudiation, in this, of the beliefs that he had so
lustily defended in his Jena days led to a lasting aliena- tion from his
brother. He gave his final course of lectures in Dresden in 1828, and
died there in the following year. Dorothea treasured his memory, and
followed him, in thought and deed, till her end in 1839.</p>
<p>August outlived both of them. In May, 1812, he was reunited with</p>
<p>Mme. de Stael; he guided her through Austria and Russia to
St. Peters- burg, and went on with her to Stockholm. There, through
Madame’s influ - ence, he was appointed secretary to Bernadotte, crown
prince of Sweden, and accompanied him in the campaign of 1813 against
Napoleon. For his services he was ennobled by the Swedish government. In
1814 he rejoined Mme. de Stael at Coppet, and he stayed with her till
her death. Then, his remarkable devotion to her having been fulfilled,
he accepted a professor- ship in literature at the University of Bonn
(1818). He resumed his studies of Sanskrit, set up a Sanskrit press,
edited and published the text of the Bhagavad-Gita and the Ramayana, and
labored for ten years on an Indische Bibliothek, or library of Hindu
literature. He died in 1845, aged seventy- eight, leaving behind him a
treasure of Shakespeare painstakingly trans- formed into German, and, in
his lectures, a harvest of literary memories and ideas for Coleridge to
glean from on his way to German philosophy. It was a good life.</p>
