<h4 id="chapter-xiii">CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<p>The Kingdom of Naples</p>
<p>i 378- i 534</p>
<p>I. ALFONSO THE MAGNANIMOUS</p>
<p>S OUTHEAST of the Marches and the Papal States all mainland Italy</p>
<p>constituted the Kingdom of Naples. On the Adriatic side it
included</p>
<p>the ports of Pescara, Bari, Brindisi, and Otranto; a bit inland the
city of Foggia, once the lively capital of the wondrous F rederick II;
on the “in - step” the ancient port of Taranto; on the “toe” another
Reggio; and on the southwestern coast one scenic splendor after another,
rising to the glory of Salerno, Amalfi, Sorrento, and Capri, and
culminating in busy, noisy, loquacious, passionate, joyous Naples. It
was the only great city in the realm. Outside of it and the ports the
country was agricultural, medieval, feudal: the land was tilled by serfs
or slaves, or by peasants “free” to starve</p>
<p>The house of Anjou had begun a rapid decline with the escapades of
Queen Joanna I, which ended when Charles of Durazzo had her strangled
with a silken cord (1382). Joanna II, though forty at her accession
(1414), was as excitable as the first. She married thrice, banished her
second hus- band, and had the third murdered. Faced by revolt, she
called to her aid King Alfonso of Aragon and Sicily, and adopted him as
her son and heir (1420). Rightly suspecting him of planning to replace
her, she disowned him (1423), and left her state to Rene of Anjou at her
death (1435). A long war of succession followed, in which Alfonso,
having sampled Naples, fought to seize its throne. While he was
besieging Gaeta he was captured by the Genoese, and was brought before
Filippo Maria Visconti at Milan. With consummate logic surely never
learned in schools, he persuaded the Duke that French power
re-established in Naples, added to French power already pressing upon
Milan from the north and Genoa from the west,</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>(chap. XIII</p>
<p>would hold half of Italy in a vise, which the Visconti would be the
first to feel. Filippo understood, freed his prisoner, and bade him
Godspeed to Naples. After many battles and intrigues Alfonso won; the
rule of the house of Anjou at Naples (1268-1442) ended, that of the
house of Aragon ( 1442-1 503) began. This usurpation provided the legal
basis for the French invasion of Italy in 1494, which was the first act
in the tragedy of Italy.</p>
<p>Alfonso was so pleased with his new royal seat that he left the
rule</p>
<p>of Aragon and Sicily to his brother John II. He was not an easy
ruler; he taxed with a hard hand; allowed financiers to squeeze the
people, then squeezed them in turn; and extorted money from Jews by
threatening to baptize them. But most of his taxation fell upon the
merchant class; Alfonso reduced the taxes levied from the poor, and
helped the destitute. The Nea- politans thought him a good king; he
walked among them unarmed, un- attended, and unafraid. Having no
children by his wife, he begot some on the ladies of his court; his wife
killed one of these rivals, and Alfonso never admitted the Queen to his
presence thereafter. He was a zealous church- goer, and listened to
sermons faithfully.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he caught the humanist fever, and supported classical
schol- ars with so open a hand that they named him il Magnanimo. He
welcomed Valla, Filelfo, Manetti, and other humanists to his table and
his treasury. He paid Poggio 500 crowns (2,500?) for a translation of
Xenophon’s Cyropaedia into Latin; paid Bartolommeo Fazio 500 ducats a
year for writ- ing an Historia Alfonsi, and 1500 more when it was
finished; in the one year 1458 he distributed 20,000 ducats (00,000)
among literary men. He carried some classic with him wherever he went;
at home and on campaigns he had a classic read to him at meals; and
students who wished to hear these readings were admitted to them. When
the supposed remains of Livy were discovered at Padua, he sent
Beccadelli to Venice to buy a bone, and he received it with all the awe
and devotion of a good Neapolitan watching the flow of St. Januarius’
blood. When Manetti orated to him in Latin Alf onso was so fascinated by
the Florentine scholar’s idiomatic style that he allowed a fly to feast
on the royal nose till the oration was complete. 1 He gave his humanists
full freedom of speech, even to heresy and por- nography, and protected
them from the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The most remarkable of the scholars at Alfonso’s court was Lorenzo
Valla. Born in Rome (1407), he studied the classics with Leonardo Bruni,
and became an enthusiastic, even a fanatical, Latinist, among whose many
wars was a campaign to destroy Italian as a literary language, and make
good Latin live again. While teaching Latin and rhetoric at Pavia he
wrote</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES 35 1</p>
<p>a violent diatribe against the famous jurist Bartolus, laughing at
his labori- ous Latinity, and contending that only a man skilled in
Latin and in Roman history could understand Roman law. The law students
in the university defended Bartolus, the art students rallied around
Valla; the debate gradu- ated into riots, and Valla was asked to leave.
Later, in Notes on the New Testament ( Adnotationes ad novum
testamentum) , he applied his linguistic learning and fury to Jerome’s
Latin translation of the Bible, and revealed many an error in that
heroic undertaking; Erasmus would later praise, epitomize, and use
Valla’s critique. In another treatise, Elegantiae linguae Latinae, Valla
gave his rules for Latin elegance and purity, ridiculed the Latin of the
Middle Ages, and joyfully exposed the bad Latin of many humanists. In an
age that adored Cicero he preferred Quintilian. He was left with hardly
a friend in the world.</p>
<p>To confirm his isolation he published (1431) a dialogue On Pleasure
and the True Good ( De voluptate et vero bono), which expounded the
amoral- ism of the humanists with astonishing temerity. He used as
persons of the dialogue three men still living: Leonardo Bruni to defend
Stoicism, Antonio Beccadelli to vindicate Epicureanism, and Niccolo de’
Niccoli to reconcile Christianity and philosophy. Beccadelli was made to
speak with such force that readers rightly assumed that his views were
Valla’s own. We must suppose, argued Beccadelli, that human nature is
good, for it was created by God; indeed Nature and God are one.
Consequently our instincts are good, and our natural desire for pleasure
and happiness is in itself a justification of the pursuit of these as
the proper object of human life. All pleasures, whether of the senses or
of the intellect, are to be held legitimate until proved injurious. Now
we have an imperious instinct to mate, and cer- tainly no instinct for
lifelong chastity. Such continence is therefore un- natural; it is an
intolerable torment, and should not be preached as virtue. Virginity,
Beccadelli was made to conclude, is a mistake and a waste; and a
courtesan is of more value to mankind than a nun. 2</p>
<p>So far as his means allowed, Valla lived this philosophy. He was a
man of promiscuous passion, hot temper, and extreme speech. He wandered
from city to city, seeking literary employment. He asked for a place in
the papal secretariat, and was turned away. When Alfonso took him up
(1435), the King of Aragon and Sicily was fighting for the throne of</p>
<p>Naples, and counted among his foes Pope Eugenius IV (1431-47), who
claimed Naples as a lapsed papal fief. A reckless scholar like Valla,
learned in history, skilled in polemics, and with nothing to lose, was a
handy tool against the Pope. Under Alfonso’s protection Valla wrote
(1440) his most</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>352</p>
<p>(chap. XIII</p>
<p>famous treatise, On the Falsely Believed and Lying Donation of
Constan- tine (De falso credita et ementita Constantini donatione). He
assailed as a ridiculous forgery the Constitutum Constantini by which
the first Christian emperor transferred to Pope Sylvester I (314-35)
full secular dominion over all Western Europe. Nicholas of Cusa had
recently (1433) exposed the falsity of the Donation in his De
concordantia Catholica, written for a Council of Basel also at odds with
Eugenius IV; but Valla’s histori cal and linguistic criticism of the
document was so devastating (though he himself made many errors) that
the question was settled once and for all.</p>
<p>Valla and Alfonso were not content with scholarship; they waged war.
“I attack not only the dead but the living,” said Valla; and he
excoriated the relatively decent Eugenius with the most idiomatic abuse.
“Even were</p>
<p>Eugenius fought back with the Inquisition. Valla was summoned before
its agents at Naples; he ironically professed his complete orthodoxy,
and refused to say more. Alfonso ordered the Inquisitors to let him
alone, and they dared not disobey. Valla continued his attacks on the
Church: he showed that the works attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite
were un- authentic; that the letter of Abgarus to Jesus, published by
Eusebius, was a forgery; and that the Apostles had had no hand in
composing the Apos- tles’ Creed. However, when he surmised that Alfonso
w as moving toward reconciliation with the papacy he decided that he too
had better make peace. He addressed an apology to Eugenius, retracting
his heresies, re- affirming his orthodoxy, and asking pardon for his
sins. The Pope made no answer. But when Nicholas V ascended the papal
throne, and sent out a call for scholars, Valla was made a secretary to
the Curia (1448), and was employed to make Latin translations from the
Greek. He ended his life as a canon of St. John Lateran, and was buried
in holy ground (1457).</p>
<p>THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>His friendly rival, Antonio Beccadelli, illustrated the morals of his
time by writing an obscene book and receiving acclaim for it from the
leading men of Italy. Born at Palermo (1394), and therefore nicknamed il
Panor- mita, he imbibed his higher education, and perhaps his ambiguous
morals, in Siena. About 1425 he composed, under the title of
Hermaphroditus, a series of Latin elegies and epigrams rivaling Martial
in Latinity and por- n ography. Cosimo de’ Medici accepted the
dedication, probably without reading the book; the virtuous Guarino da
Verona praised the eloquence of its language; a hundred others added
encomiums; finally the Emperor Sigismund placed a poet’s crown upon
Beccadelli’s head (1433). Priests denounced the volume, Eugenius
proclaimed the excommunication of all who read it, friars publicly
burned it at Ferrara, Bologna, Milan. Never- theless Beccadelli lectured
summa cum laude in the universities of Bologna and Pavia, received a
stipend of eight hundred scudi from the Visconti, and was invited to
Naples as court historiographer. His history Of the Memo- rable Words
and Deeds of King Alfonso was written in such idiomatic Latin that
Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini — Pope Pius II — himself no middling
Latinist, considered it a model of Latin style. Beccadelli lived to be
seventy- seven, and died rich in honors and property.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>FERRANTE</li>
</ol>
<p>Alfonso left his kingdom to his putative son Ferdinand (r.
1458-94).</p>
<p>Ferrante, as his people called him, was of dubious parentage. His
mother was Margaret of Hijar, who had other lovers besides the King;
Pontano, Ferrante’s secretary, affirmed that the father was a Valencian
marrano— i.e., a Christianized Spanish Jew. Valla was his tutor.
Ferrante was not known for sexual profligacy, but he had most of the
vices that can come from a passionate nature untamed by a firm moral
code, and aroused by apparently unreasonable hostility. Pope Calixtus
III legitimated his birth but refused to recognize him as king; he
declared the Aragonese line in Naples extinct, and claimed the Kingdom
as a fief of the Church. Rene of Anjou made another attempt to regain
the throne bequeathed him by Joanna II. While he landed forces on the
Neapolitan coast, the feudal barons rose in revolt against the house of
Aragon, and allied themselves with the foreign foes of the King.
Ferrante confronted these simultaneous challenges with angry courage,
overcame them, and revenged himself with somber ferocity. One by one he
lured his enemies with pretended reconciliation, gave them ex- cellent
dinners, killed some of them after dessert, imprisoned others, let</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XIII</p>
<p>several starve to death in his dungeons, kept some of them in cages
for his occasional delectation, and, when they died, had them embalmed
and dressed in their favorite costumes, and preserved them as mummies in
his museum; 5 these stories, however, may be “war atrocities”
manufactured by historians in a hostile camp. It was this king who dealt
so fairly with Lo- renzo de’ Medici in 1479. Revolution nearly upset him
in 1485, but he recovered his footing, completed a long reign of
thirty-six years, and died amid general rejoicing. The rest of the story
of Naples belongs to the collapse of Italy.</p>
<p>Ferrante did not continue Alfonso’s patronage of scholars, but he en
- gaged as his prime minister a man who was at once a poet, a
philosopher, and a skillful diplomat. Giovanni Pontano developed —
Beccadelli had founded — the Neapolitan Academy. Its members were men of
letters who met pe- riodically to exchange verses and ideas. They took
Latin names (Pontano became Jovianus Pontanus), and loved to think that
they were continuing, after a long and cruel interlude, the stately
culture of Imperial Rome. Sev- eral of them wrote a Latin worthy of the
Silver Age. Pontanus composed Latin treatises on ethics, praising the
virtues that Ferrante allegedly ignored, and an eloquent essay De
principe, recommending to a ruler those amiable qualities which
Machiavelli’s Prince, twenty years later, would contemn. Giovanni
dedicated this exemplary tract to his pupil, Ferrante’s son and heir
Alfonso II (1494-5), w h° practised all that Machiavelli preached.
Pontano taught in verse as well as in prose, and expounded in Latin
hexa- meters the mysteries of astronomy and the proper cultivation of
oranges. In a series of pleasant poems he celebrated every species of
normal love: the mutual itching of healthy youth, the tender attachment
of newlyweds, the reciprocal satisfactions of marriage, the joys and
griefs of parental love, the merger of mates into one being by the
accumulation of the years. He described in verses seemingly as
spontaneous as Virgil’s, and with a sur pris- ing command of the Latin
lexicon, the holiday life of the Neapolitans: the workers sprawling on
the grass, the athletes at their games, the picnickers in their carts,
the seductive girls dancing the tarantella to the clash of their
tambourines, the lads and lasses flirting on the bayside promenade, the
lovers keeping tryst, the bluebloods taking the baths at Baiae as if
fifteen centuries had not passed since Ovid’s raptures and despairs. Had
Pontano written in Italian with the same felicity and grace with which
he composed Latin verse, we should have ranked him with the bilingual
Petrarch and Politian, who had the good sense to march with the present
as well as roam in the past.</p>
<p>THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>After Pontano the most prominent member of the Academy was Iacopo
Sannazaro. Like Bembo he could write Italian in the purest Tuscan
dialect — far different from the Neapolitan speech; like Politian and
Pontano he could mold Latin elegies and epigrams that would not have
shamed Tibullus or Martial. For one epigram praising Venice Venice sent
him six hundred ducats.® Alfonso II, at war with Alexander VI, took
Sannazaro with him on his campaigns to shoot poetic darts into Rome.
When the lusty Pope, whose Borgia family carried a Spanish bull on its
coat of arms, took Giulia Faraese as his alleged mistress, Sannazaro
gored him with two lines that must have made Alfonso’s soldiers regret
their ignorance of Latin:</p>
<p>Europen Tyrio quondam sedisse iuvenco</p>
<p>quis neget? Hispano Iulia vecta tauro est ; 7</p>
<p>which is to say:</p>
<p>That once on Tyrian bull Europa sat.</p>
<p>Who doubts? A Spanish bull bears Julia.</p>
<p>And when Caesar Borgia took the field against Naples, a barb went his
way:</p>
<p>Aut nihil aut Caesar vult did Borgia; quidni?</p>
<p>cum simul et Caesar possit et esse nihil ; 8</p>
<p>Caesar or nothing Borgia would be called;</p>
<p>But why not both, since he is both at once?</p>
<p>Such sallies passed from mouth to ear in Italy, and shared in forming
the legend of the Borgias.</p>
<p>In a gentler mood Sannazaro composed (1526) a Latin epic On the</p>
<p>Virgin Birth (De partu Virginis). It was an astonishing tour de
force: it used the classical machinery of the pagan gods, but brought
them in as adjuncts to — eavesdroppers on — the Gospel narrative; and it
dared compari- son with Virgil by quoting the famous Fourth Eclogue in
the body of the poem. It was excellent Latin, and delighted Clement VII,
but not even a pope will lose himself in it today.</p>
<p>The masterpiece of Sannazaro was written in the living tongue of his
people, in a medley of prose and verse — Arcadia (1504). Like Theocritus
in ancient Alexandria, the poet had grown tired of cities, and had
learned</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>35&lt;5</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>to love rural fragrance and peace. It was an urban sentiment that
Lorenzo and Politian had expressed, with evident sincerity, some twenty
years be- fore. The landscapes in the painting of the time marked a
growing ap- preciation of the countryside; and men of the world began to
babble of woods and fields, limpid streams, and virile shepherds piping
amorous lays. Sannazaro’s book caught these fancies at their flow, and
was carried to such fame and popularity as favored no other book of the
Italian Renaissance. He led his readers into an imaginary world of
strong men and beautiful women — none of these old, and most of them
nude; he described their splendor, and that of natural scenes, in a
poetic prose that set a fashion in Italy, and later in France and
England; and he interspersed his prose with pardonable poetry. In this
book the modem pastoral was bom, perhaps less graceful than the ancient,
more elongated and windy, but with interminable effect upon literature
and art. Here Giorgione, Titian, and a hundred art- ists after them
would find themes for their pigments; here Edmund Spenser and Sir Philip
Sidney would take impressions for their faery queens and an English
Arcadia. Sannazaro had rediscovered a continent more enchanting than the
New World of Columbus, a melodious Utopia where any soul might enter at
no other cost than literacy, and might build its castle to its taste and
whim without lifting a finger from the page.</p>
<p>The art of the Regno was more masculine than its poetry, though there
too the soft Italian touch showed its hand. Donatello and Michelozzo
came down from Florence and set the pace with an imposing mausoleum for
Cardinal Rinaldo Brancacci in the church of San Angelo a Nilo. For the
Castel Nuovo, begun by Charles I of Anjou (1283), Alfonso the Magnani-
mous ordered a new gate (1443-70), which Francesco Laurana designed, and
for which Pietro di Martino, and probably Giuliano da Maiano, carved
handsome reliefs of the King’s achievements in war and peace. The church
of Santa Chiara, built for Robert the Wise (1310), still contains the
lovely Gothic monument set up by the brothers Giovanni and Pace da
Firenze soon after the King’s death in 1343. The cathedral of San
Gennaro (1272) received a new Gothic interior in the fifteenth century.
There, in the costly Cappella del Tesoro, the blood of St. Januarius,
protective patron of Naples, flows three times a year, insuring the
prosperity of a city weary with commerce and burdened with centuries,
but consoled by faith and love.</p>
<p>Sicily remained aloof from the Renaissance. She produced a few schol-
ars like Aurispa, a few painters like Antonello da Messina, but they
soon</p>
<p>CHAP.XIIl) THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES 357</p>
<p>migrated to the wider opportunities of the mainland. Palermo,
Monreale, Cefalu had great art, but only as the relic of Byzantine,
Moslem, or Nor- man days. The feudal lords who owned the land preferred
the eleventh to the fifteenth century, and lived in knightly scorn or
ignorance of letters. The people whom they exploited were too poor to
have any cultural ex- pression beyond their colorful dress, their
religion of bright mosaics and somber hope, their songs and simple
poetry of love and violence. The lovely island enjoyed its own Aragonese
kings and queens from 1295 to 1409; thereafter, for three centuries, it
was a jewel in the crown of Spain. Lengthy as this brief survey of
non-Roman Italy has seemed, it has done scant justice to the full and
varied life of the passionate peninsula. Con- sideration of morals and
manners, of science and philosophy, may be de- ferred till we have spent
some chapters with the Renaissance popes; but even in those cities that
we have touched how many precious byways of life and art have escaped
our eyes! We have said nothing of a whole branch of Italian literature,
for the greatest novelle belong to a later period. We have inadequately
visualized the major role that the minor arts played in the adornment of
Italian bodies, minds, and homes. What deformed or inflated botches were
majestically transformed by the textile arts! What would some of the
grandees and grand dames glorified by Venetian paint- ing have been
without their velvets, satins, silks, and brocades? They did well to
cover their nakedness and brand nudity as a sin. Wise it was of them,
too, to cool their summers with gardens, even though so formal; to
beautify their homes with colored tiles on roof and floor, with iron</p>
<p>wrought into lacery and arabesques, and copper vessels gleaming
smooth, and figurines of bronze or ivory reminding them how fair might
men and women be, and woodwork carved and marquetried and built to last
a thousand years, and lustrous pottery brightening table and cupboard
and mantelpiece, and the miraculous embroidery of Venetian glass
ofFering its fragile challenge to time, and the golden dies and silver
clasps of leather bindings around treasured classics illuminated by
happy bondsmen of the pen. Many painters, like Sano di Pietro, chose to
ruin their eyesight with drawing and coloring miniatures rather than
spread their subtle and inti- mate dreams of beauty crudely over panels
and walls. And sometimes, weary of walking through galleries, one could
sit gladly for hours over the illumination and calligraphy of such
manuscripts as still hide in the Schifanoia palace at Ferrara, or in the
Morgan Library at New York, or in the Ambrosiana at Milan.</p>

<p>All these, as well as the greater arts, and the labor and love,
chicanery and statesmanship, devotion and war, faith and philosophy,

and to bring it to fulfill- ment and destruction in Medicean Rome.</p>
