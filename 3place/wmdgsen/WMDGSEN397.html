North</h4>
<p>i559-&gt;648</p>
<p>I. DENMARK AS A GREAT POWER</p>
<p>1 ET US look at the map, for maps, like faces, are the signatures
of</p>
<p>j history.</p>
<p>When Frederick II ascended its throne in 1559, Denmark was one of the
strongest and most far-reaching states in Europe; it had not yet</p>
<p>learned how clever it is to be small. In the perennial contest with
Sweden for control of the commerce between the North Sea and the
Baltic,</p>
<p>Denmark was at first the victor, even extending its rule across the
Skager- rak to and throughout Norway, and across the Kattegat into what
is now south Sweden. It held the strategic cities of Copenhagen and
Helsingor on the west side, and Mahno and Helsingborg on the east side,
of the Oresund, or Sound — ^the swirling waters, in one place only three
and a half miles wide, that now separate Denmark from Sweden. Farther
east it held, through most of this period, the islands of Bornholm,
Gotland, and Osel, thereby controlling the Baltic Sea. On the south it
included the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, and far away in the
northwest it ruled Iceland and Greenland. The tolls charged by Denmark
on com- merce passing through the straits between the seas were the
chief source of the kingdom’s revenues and wars.</p>
<p>Political power resided in the eight hundred nobles who owned half
the land, kept the peasants in serfdom, elected the king, and ruled the
country through the Rigsdag, or National Diet, and the Rigsraad, or
Coun- cil of State. They had profited from the Reformation by absorbing
most of the property formerly belonging to the Catholic Church. In
return for exemption from taxation, they were expected, but they often
re- fused, to arm and lead their peasants in war at the call of the
king. Thf Protestant clergy, shorn of wealth, had a minor social
standing and little political influence; however, they controlled
education and held a censor- ship over literature, which consequently
produced mainly theology and hymns. The general population, numbering a
million, enjoyed heavy meals and heavy drinking. A barber- surgeon
advised his clients: “It is very good for persons to drink themselves
intoxicated once a month, for the excellent reasons that it frees their
strength, furthers sound sleep,</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>496</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xeases the passing of water, increases perspiration, and stimulates
general well- being.”^</p>
<p>Two Danes in this period have a special claim on history: Tycho</p>
<p>Brahe, the greatest astronomer of his generation, and Christian IV,
who not only was King of Denmark for sixty years (1588-1648) but would
have been a leader of men even without the advantage of royal birth. We
pass by his father, Frederick II, merely noting that for him the Flemish
architect Anthonis van Obberger designed (1574-85) the fortress of</p>
<p>Kronborg Castle at Helsingor — Hamlet’s Elsinore.</p>
<p>When Frederick died (1588), Christian was a boy of eleven; a regency
of four nobles ruled for eight years; then Christian took the reins. For
the next half century he lived the abundant life with such exuberance
and versatile energy that all Europe marveled. He bettered the
instruction of the aforesaid barber-surgeon, for he regularly required
to be helped home after an evening’s carouse. His profanity set a
standard that few of his subjects surpassed. The number of his bastards
created a problem in ac- countancy. His people laughed these popular
faults away and loved him, for he danced at their weddings, joined in
their labor, and risked his life repeatedly in their service. To all
this he added a knowledge of Latin and science, an educated taste in the
arts, and a simple religious faith that raised no sophomoric questions
about credibility and no qualms about fun. In his spare time he helped
to make Copenhagen {Kfibmannehavn, merchants’ harbor) one of Europe’s
most attractive capitals. His building program doubled the circumference
of the city.^ In his reign Schloss (Castle) Rosenborg took form; soon
thereafter the Bourse spread its vast fagade and raised its twisted
steeple high. He reformed the government of Norway, developed its
industries, and rebuilt its capital, which for three centuries bore his
name as Christiania. (It was renamed Oslo in 1925.) In Denmark he
improved administration, promoted manufactures, organ- ized commercial
companies, founded colleges and towns, and raised the condition of the
peasants on the Crown estates.</p>
<p>Ambition toppled him, for he dreamed of reuniting all Scandinavia</p>
<p>under one head, his own. The nobles objected that Sweden was uncon-
querable, and they refused their support. Chiefly with foreign mer-</p>
<p>cenaries he waged against Sweden the Kalmar War (1611-13). When the
Thirty Years’ War came he found himself uncomfortably allied with Sweden
in defense of the Protestant cause. That peril over, he resumed the
struggle with Sweden (1643), though he was now sixty-seven years old. He
led his inadequate forces with romantic ardor. In the naval battle of
Kolberg (1644) he fought all through the day, despite twenty wounds and
a blinded eye, and won a temporary victory. In the end Sweden proved
stronger, and the Peace of Bromsebro (1645) freed Sweden from paying</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>497</p>
<p>dues for her commerce in the Sound, and ceded to her Gotland,</p>
<p>Osel, and three provinces on the Scandinavian peninsula. When
Christian IV died, after fifty years of constructive labor and
destructive wars, his kingdom was smaller than at his accession, and the
ascendancy of Denmark had passed away.</p>

</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Rival Faiths: 1^60-1611</li>
</ol>
<p>Between Gustavus Vasa, the founder of modern Sweden, and Gustavus
Adolphus, the savior of Protestantism, Swedish history is clouded by the
contest of religious creeds for political power. The first Vasa had
freed Sweden from Denmark and had united his country under a strong
hered- itary monarchy, while noble oligarchies kept Denmark and
Poland</p>
<p>feudal and weak. The Swedish peasantry was free, and was represented,
along with the nobles, the clergy, and the towns, in the Riksdag, or
Diet; the same word bonde that in Denmark had come to mean serf was in
Sweden the proud title of a freeman tilling his own soil. But the
resources of the land were severely limited by climate, by inadequate
population, and by Danish control of three peninsular provinces and the
Sound. The nobles chafed in their new subordination to the king, and the
Catholic Church, despoiled of her Swedish wealth, plotted patiently to
recapture the people, her property, and the throne.</p>
<p>Vasa’s son Eric XIV (1560 -68) was unfitted to meet these
problems.</p>
<p>He had courage and ability, but his violent temper stultified his
diplomacy, and led him to murder and madness. He infuriated the nobles
by killing five of their leaders, one with his own hand. He carried on
against Den- mark the “Northern Seven Years’ War” (1563 -70), and
prepared future wars by conquering Livonia. He alienated his brother
John by obstruct- ing a marriage that would have made John heir to the
Polish crown; and when John nevertheless married Princess Catharine
Jagellon, Eric shut him up in the fortress of Gripsholm. Catharine came
to share the rigors of John’s imprisonment, and inclined his ear to the
Catholic faith. In 1 568 Eric’s brothers compelled him to abdicate, and
after six years in confine - ment he was put to death by order of the
Riksdag and the new King.</p>
<p>John III (1568-92) made peace with Denmark and his nobles, and re-
newed the conflict of the faiths. His wife pleaded with him, more by
night than by day, to accept Catholicism. With his permission Jesuits
entered Sweden in disguise, and the ablest of them. Antonio Possevino,
498</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xundertook the conversion of the King. John’s conscience burned with
the memory that he had consented to his brother’s death; for such a
fratricide the fires of hell seemed an inevitable punishment; this,
Possevino urged, could be escaped only by confession and absolution in
the Church which all believed to have been founded by Christ. John
yielded; he re- ceived the Sacrament according to the Roman rite, and
promised to make Catholicism the religion of the state provided the Pope
would allow the Swedish clergy to marry, the Mass to be celebrated in
the vernacular, and the Eucharist to be administered in wine as well as
bread. Possevino went to Rome; the Pope rejected the conditions;
Possevino returned empty- handed. John ordered the Jesuits to receive
the Sacrament in both kinds and recite the Mass in Swedish. They refused
and departed. In 1584 Catholic Catharine died; a year later John married
a Protestant lady, who, more by night than by day, brought him back to
the Lutheran faith.</p>
<p>In August 1587 his Catholic son was elected to the Polish throne
as</p>
<p>Sigismund III. By the Statute of Kalmar father and son agreed that
after John’ s death Sigismund should reign over both Poland and Sweden;
but Sigismund pledged himself to respect Sweden’s political independence
and Protestant faith. When John died (1592) the Riksdag, under the lead
of his brother Duke Charles, met at Uppsala (February 25, 1593) with
three hundred clergymen and three hundred laymen — nobles, burgesses,
miners, and peasants — and adopted the Lutheran Augsburg Confession of
1530 as the official creed of the Swedish Church and state. The historic
synod (Uppsala-mote) declared that no religion but Lutheranism was to be
tolerated in the nation, that none but orthodox Lutherans were to be
appointed to ecclesiastical or political office, and that Sigismund
would be crowned in Sweden only after he had accepted these principles.
Mean- while Duke Charles was recognized as regent in the absence of the
King.</p>
<p>Sigismund, who had been educated by the Jesuits, dreamed of bringing
Sweden and Russia into the Catholic fold. When he landed at Stockholm
(September 1593) he found the Swedish leaders almost unanimous in
demanding his solemn guarantee to obey the Uppsala declarations. For
five months he sought to win a compromise; the leaders were obdurate,
and Duke Charles collected an army. Finally Sigismund gave the required
pledge, and a Lutheran bishop crowned him at Uppsala (February 1594).
Soon thereafter he issued a statement protesting that his pledge had
been given under duress. He appointed six lords lieutenant to protect
the re- maining Catholics in Sweden, and in August he returned to
Poland.</p>
<p>Duke Charles and Archbishop Angermannus of Uppsala prepared to
enforce the synod’s decrees. The Diet of Siiderkoping (1595) called for
an end to all Catholic worship and the banishment of “all sectaries
oppos ed to the evangelical religion.” The Archbishop ordered that
whoever neg -</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>499</p>
<p>lected to attend Lutheran services was to be beaten with rods, and in
his visitation of the churches he personally attended such punishments.®
All surviving monasteries were closed, and all Catholic shrines were
removed.</p>
<p>Sigismund’s advisers begged him to invade Sweden with a large army.
He thought five thousand men would suffice; with these he landed in
Sweden in 1598. At Stegeborg Duke Charles gave him battle and was
defeated; in a second engagement, at Stangebro, Charles won; Sigismund
again agreed to the Uppsala declarations and returned to Poland. In July
1599 the Swedish Diet deposed him, and Duke Charles, stiU as regent,
became the actual ruler of the state. The Diet of 1604 passed a
succession act entailing the crown upon such male or female members of
the Vasa family as accepted the established Lutheran religion, and
enacting that no dissenters from that religion should be allowed to
dwell or hold prop- erty in Sweden. “Every prince who should deviate
from the Confession of Augsburg should ipso facto lose the crown.”^ So
the road was opened to the accession of Charles’s son Gustavus Adolphus,
and to the abdica - tion of his granddaughter Christina. In 1607 Charles
IX was crowned King.</p>
<p>He reformed the disordered government, vigorously promoted educa-
tion, commerce, and industry, and founded the cities of Karlstad, Filip-
stad, Mariestad, and Goteborg; this last settlement gave Sweden clear
access to the North Sea, circumventing Danish control of the straits.
Christian IV declared war (April 1611) and invaded Sweden. Charles, aged
sixty-one, challenged Christian to single combat; Christian refused. At
the height of the conflict (October 1611) Charles died; but before his
death he laid his hand upon the head of his son, saying, “Ille faciet”
(He will do it).® He did.</p>

</ol>
<p>The most romantic figure in Swedish history was now sixteen. His</p>
<p>mother was a German, daughter of Duke Adolphus of Holstein-Gottorp.
Father and mother gave him a rigorous education in the Swedish and
German languages and in Protestant doctrine. By the age of twelve he had
learned Latin, Italian, and Dutch; later he picked up English, Spanish,
even some Polish and Russian; to which was added as strong a dose of the
classics as comported with training in sports, public affairs, and the
arts of war, At the age of nine he began to attend the sessions of the
Riksdag; at thirteen he received ambassadors; at fifteen he ruled a
province; at six- teen he fought in battle. He was tall, handsome,
courteous, generous, merciful, intelligent, brave; what more could
history ask of a man? His</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xpopularity was so universal in Sweden that even the sons of nobles
whom Charles IX had executed for treason came willingly to serve
him.</p>
<p>He did not display the Vasa tendency to personal temper and violence,
but it appeared in his relish for war. He inherited from his father the
Kalmar War with Denmark; he waged it zealously, but he felt that it was
leading him in the wrong direction, and in 1613 he gave Denmark a
million thalers (,ooo,ooo?) in exchange for peace and the free passage
of Swedish vessels through the straits and the Sound. At this stage of
his career he was more interested in keeping Russia out of the Baltic.
“If at an y time,” he wrote to his mother, “Russia should… learn her
strength, she would be able not only to attack Finland [then part of
Sweden] on both sides, but also to get such a fleet on the Baltic as
would endanger our Fatherland.”® He sent his most r esourceful general,
Jacob de la Gardie, to conquer Ingria, and in 1615 he himself laid siege
to Pskov. The Russian resistance was troublesome, but by threatening to
ally himself with Poland Gustavus persuaded Czar Michael Romanov to sign
a peace (1617) recog- nizing Swedish control of Livonia, Esthonia, and
northwestern Ingria, including what is now Leningrad. For the time being
Russia was blocked from the Baltic. Gustavus boasted that without
Swedish permission Russia could not launch a single boat upon that
sea.</p>
<p>Now he turned his attention to Poland, whose Sigismund III still</p>
<p>claimed the Swedish throne. Catholicism was by this time victorious
in Poland and was eager for another chance to capture Sweden; moreover,
Poland, with great ports at Danzig, Memel, Libau, and Riga, was then a
stronger competitor than Russia for control of the Baltic. In 1 62 1
Gustavus led 158 ships and 19,000 men to the siege of Riga, through
which a third of Polish exports passed. Its population was predominantly
Protestant and might not resent a Lutheran overlord. When it
capitulated, Gustavus dealt with it leniently to attach it to his cause.
During a three-year truce with Poland he strengthened the spirit and
discipline of his army and, like his contemporary Cromwell, made piety
an instrument of martial morale. He studied the military art of Maurice
of Nassau and learned how to win campaigns by swift movement and
farseeing strategy. He brought in technicians from Holland to instruct
his men in siege tactics and the use of artillery. In 1625 he crossed
the Baltic again, captured Dorpat, con- firmed Swedish control of
Livonia, and completely shut out Lithuania from the Baltic Sea. A year
later his armies subdued both East and West Prussia, which were fiefs of
the Polish Crovm; only Danzig held out. The conquered regions became
provinces of Sweden, the Jesuits were expelled, Lutheranism was made
official. All Protestant Europe now looked to Gustavus as a possible
savior in the great war that was then devastating Germany.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>501</p>
<p>In the intervals of peace, he had faced with less genius than in war
the problems of internal administration. During his absence on campaigns
he left the government to the nobles, and to ensure their fidelity he
allowed them to monopolize office and to buy from the Crown vast estates
at little cost. But he found time to stabilize finances, to reorganize
the courts, the postal service, the hospitals, and poor relief. He
established free schools, founded the University of Dorpat, and richly
re-endowed the University of Uppsala. He prodded mining and metallurgy,
and it was no small item in his successes that Sweden had materials and
skill to manufacture arma- ment. He promoted foreign commerce by
granting monopolies and gave a charter to a Swedish South Sea Company.
His minister Oxenstierna, known for his calm in crises, was appalled by
his master’s energy. “The King,” he said, “controls and s teers mines,
commerce, manufactures, and customs just as a steersman steers his
ship.”^ He begged Gustavus to cool down. “If we were all as cold as
you,” answered the King, “we should freeze.” “If we were all as hot as
your Majesty,” the minister retorted, “we should burn.”®</p>
<p>Now the consuming fever of the Swedish knight was to get into the</p>
<p>Thirty Years’ War. “All wars in Europe hang together,” he said.® He
had noted with deep anxiety the victories of Wallenstein, the advance of
Haps- burg armies into northern Germany, the collapse of ’Danish
resistance, the alliance of Catholic Poland and Catholic Austria; soon
the Hapsburg power would seek control of the Baltic, and the commerce,
religion, and life of Sweden might be at the mercy of the Empire and the
papacy. On May 20, 1629, Gustavus sent to the Swedish Diet a warning of
Wallenstein’s plan to make the Baltic a Hapsburg sea. He recommended
offense as the best defense, and asked the nation to support and finance
his entry into the Armageddon that was about to determine the fate of
theologies. Sweden was already heavily burdened by his campaigns, but
the Diet and the people responded to his call. With the help of
Richelieu he persuaded Poland to a six-year truce (September 1629). Nine
months he spent col- lecting ships, provisions, troops, and allies. On
May 30, 1630, he addressed the Diet in an eloquent and moving farewell,
as if surmising that he would not see Sweden again. On June 26-28 his
forces disembarked on an island off the Pomeranian coast, and Gustavus
went forth to glory and death.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Quern Christina: 16 <sup>2-</sup>4</li>
</ol>
<p>Since his daughter, heiress to his throne, was a child of four, he
ap– pointed as regent one of the ablest statesmen of that genius-crowded
age — Count Axel Oxenstierna. Christina later described him: “He had
studied</p>
<p>502</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xmuch in his youth, and continued to do so in the midst of business.
His capacity and knowledge of the world’s affairs and interests were
very great; he knew the strong and weak points of every state in
Europe…. He was ambitious, but faithful and incorruptible, withal a
little too slow and phleg- matic.”^® He had a repu tation for silence,
but to say nothing, especially when speaking, is half the art of
diplomacy. For two years he ruled Sweden well while Gustavus fought on
alien fields. Then, as regent for Christina, he directed the armies of
Sweden in Germany as well as affairs at home, and no country in Europe
had in those twelve years a better government. In 1634 he drew up a
“Form of Government” specifying the composition, powers, and duties of
each department in the administration; this is the earliest known
example of a written constitution.</p>
<p>In 1644 Christina, now eighteen, assumed control. She felt herself
fit to rule this vibrant nation, grown to a million and a half souls;
and indeed she had all the abilities of a precocious male. “I came into
the world,” she said, “all armed with hair; my voice was strong and
harsh. This made the women think I was a boy, and they gave vent to
their joy in exclamations which at first deceived the King.”^^ Gustavus
took the discovery of her sex like a gentleman, and came to love her so
dearly that he seemed quite content to have her as heir to his power;
but her mother, Maria Eleanora of Brandenburg, never forgave her for
being a girl. Perhaps this maternal rejection shared in making Christina
as much of a man as her physique would allow. She conscientiously
neglected her person, scorned ornament, swore manfully, liked to wear
male dress, took to masculine sports, rode astride at top speed, hunted
wildly, and bagged her game at the first shot; but: “I never killed an
animal without feeling pity for it.”^^</p>
<p>Despite all this she had some feminine charms. Pierre Huet, afterward
Bishop of Avranches, reported (1653): “Her face is refined and pretty,
her hair golden, her eyes flash…. She carries modesty written on her
face, and shows it by the blushes which cover it at an immodest word.”^®
“She cannot bear the idea of marriage, because she was born free and
will die free,” reported the Jesuit confessor of the Spanish
ambassador.^^ She seems to have felt, that coitus was, for a woman, a
form of subjection; and doubt- less, like Elizabeth of England, she knew
that her husband would want to be king. She was sensitively aware of her
faults, and acknowledged them bravely. “I was distrustful, s uspicious,
ambitious to excess. I was hot- tempered, proud, and impatient,
contemptuous and satirical. I gave no quarter. I was too incredulous,
and little of a devotee.”^® But she was gener - ous to extravagance, and
faithful to her tasks. “She spends o nly three or four hours in sleep,”
said the Jesuit. “When she wakes she spends five hours in reading…. She
never drinks anything but water; never has she been heard to speak of
her food, whether it was well or ill cooked…. She at^</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 503</p>
<p>ends her Council regularly…. During a fever twenty-eight days long
she never neglected her state affairs…. Ambassadors treat only with her,
with- out ever being passed on to secretary or minister.”^®</p>
<p>She wished to rival not only the youths in sports and the courtiers
in politics, but also the scholars in learning, and these not merely in
languages and literature but in science and philosophy as well. By the
age of fourteen she knew German, French, Italian, and Spanish; by
eighteen she knew Latin; later she studied Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic.
She read and loved the French and Italian poets, and envied the bright
vivacity of French civilization. She corresponded eagerly with scholars,
scientists, and phi- losophers in several lands. She brought together a
splendid library, includ- ing rare ancient manuscripts which students
came from many countries to consult. At her death connoisseurs were
impressed by the fine taste she had shown in purchasing pictures,
statues, enamels, engravings, and antiques. She collected savants as she
collected art; she longed to have pundits and thinkers about her; she
drew to her court Claudius Salmasius, Isaac Vossius, Hugo Grotius,
Nicolaas Heinsius, and rewarded all of them lavishly.</p>
<p>Those scholars who could not come sent her their books and paeans —
Scarron, Guez de Balzac, Mile, de Scudery; and the grave Milton, while
blasting her Salmasius, declared her “fit to govern not only Europe but
the world.”*^ Pascal sent her his calculating machine, with a remarkably
beautiful letter complimenting her on being a queen in the realm of mind
as well as of government.^®</p>
<p>Her penultimate passion was for philosophy. She corresponded with
Gassendi, who, like a hundred ot hers, congratulated her on realizing
Plato’s dream of philosopher-kings. Rene Descartes, the outstanding
philosopher of the age, came, saw, and marveled to hear her deduce his
pet ideas from Plato.^® When he tried to convince her that all animals
are mechanisms, she remarked that she had never seen her watch give
birth to baby watches.^® But of this more later on.</p>
<p>She did not neglect native talent. Sweden had then a true polymath,
Georg Stjemhjelm, linguist, jurist, scientist, mathematician, historian,
phi- losopher, the father of Swedish poetry and the center of Swedish
intel- lectual life in this age. Gustavus Adolphus so admired him that
he raised him to the peerage; Christina made him court poet, until he
joined her enemies.^*</p>
<p>Attracted by the pedagogical theories of John Comenius, she brought
him to Stockholm to reform the school system of Sweden. Like Elizabeth
at Oxford and Cambridge, she visited Uppsala to encourage by her
presence the teachers and pupils at the university; she listened there
to Stjemhjelm and others discourse on the Hebrew text of the Old
Testament. She built a college at Dorpat and gave it a library; she
founded six other colleges; she</p>
<p>504 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XK</p>
<p>developed into a university the college that her father had founded
at Abo (Turku) in Finland. She sent students to study abroad, some to
Arabia to learn Oriental scholarship. She imported Dutch printers to
establish a pub- lishing house in Stockholm. She urged Swedish
scientists to write in the vernacular, so that knowledge might spread
among her people. She was, without question, one of the most enlightened
rulers in history.</p>
<p>Did she have a mind of her own, or was she the undiscriminating re-
ceptacle of the intellectual currents eddying about her.^ The unanimous
testimony is that in government she did her own thinking, made her own
decisions, ruled as well as reigned.^* We shall see, in a later chapter,
how she vetoed Oxenstierna’s martial policy, labored for peace, and
helped to end the Thirty Years’ War. Her fragmentary memoirs are vital
and fasci - nating. The maxims which she left in manuscripts have
nothing hackneyed about them. E.g.:</p>
<p>One is, in proportion as one can love.</p>
<p>Fools are to be more feared than knaves.</p>
<p>To undeceive men is to offend them.</p>
<p>Extraordinary merit is a crime never forgiven.</p>
<p>There is a star which unites souls of the first order, though
ages</p>
<p>and distances divide them.</p>
<p>More courage is required for marriage than for war.</p>
<p>One rises above all, when one no longer esteems or fears
anything.</p>
<p>He who loses his temper with the world has learned all he knows</p>
<p>o no purpose.</p>
<p>Philosophy neither changes men nor corrects men.^®</p>
<p>In the end, after sampling a dozen philosophies, perhaps after
ceasing to be a Christian, she became a Catholic. She was accused of
having imbibed atheism from her physician Bourdelot.®^ A Swedish
historian, echoed by Voltaire,®® thought her conversion a conscious
farce: on this theory she had come to the conclusion that since truth
cannot be known, one might as well adopt the religion that appeals most
to the heart and the aesthetic sense,®® and gives most comfort to the
people. But conversion to Catholicism is often a sincere reaction after
extreme skepticism; in the depths of doubt mysticism may sink its well.
There were mystic elements in Christina; her memoirs are intimately
addressed to God. Belief is a protective garment; its complete
divestiture leaves an intellectual nudity that longs to be clothed and
warmed. And what warmer raiment than the colorful, sensuous Ca-
tholicism of France and Italy? “How,” she asked, “can one be a Christian
without being a Catholic?”®^</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>505</p>
<p>She pondered long over the question, and over the many complications
involved in conversion. If she abandoned Lutheranism she must, by the
laws of her realm and her beloved father, abandon not only her throne
but her country. What an anticlimax such a change of faith would be to
her father’s heroic defense of Protestant Europe! But she was tired of
her official duties, of the harangues of preachers and councilors, of
the pedantic trivia of scholars, antiquaries, and historians. And
perhaps Sweden was tired of her. Her alienation of Crown lands, her
costly gifts to her favorites, had impoverished and consumed her
revenues. A majority of the nobles were leagued against her policies. In
1651 there was a flurry of rebellion; the leaders were hastily
executed,**® but an active resentment survived. Finally, she was sick.
She had injured her health, probably by too much work and study.
Frequently she suffered dangerous fevers, with symptoms of in- flamed
lungs. Several times she fainted, sometimes remaining unconscious for an
hour. In 1648, during a severe illness, she says, she “made a vow to
quit all and become a Catholic, should God preserve my life.”®® She was
a Mediterranean soul shivering in the wintry north. She dreamed of
Italian skies and French salons. How pleasant it would be to join the
cultured women who were beginning their unique function of nursing the
intellect of France! If she could take a substantial fortune with
her…</p>
<p>In 1652 she secretly sent to Rome an attache of the Portuguese
embassy to ask for Jesuits to come and discuss Catholic theology with
her. They came in disguise. They were discouraged by some of the
questions she asked — whether there was really a Providence, whether the
soul could survive the body, whether there was any actual distinction
between right and wrong except through utility. Then, when they were
about to</p>
<p>abandon her as lost, she comforted them: “What would you think if I
were nearer to becoming a Catholic than you suppose?” “Hearing this,”
said one of the Jesuits, “we felt like men raised from the dead.”*®</p>
<p>To become a Catholic before abdicating was legally impossible.
But</p>
<p>before abdicating she desired to protect the hereditary character of
the Swedish monarchy by persuading the Diet to ratify her choice of her
cousin, Charles Gustavus, as her successor. Long negotiations delayed
her abdication till June 6, 1654. The final ceremony was almost as
moving as the abdication of Charles V ninety-nine years before. She took
the crown from her head, discarded all regal insignia, removed her royal
mantle, stood before the Diet in a dress of plain white silk, and bade
her country and her people farewell in a speech that brought taciturn
old nobles and phlegmatic burgesses to tears. The Council provided for
her future income, and al- lowed her to keep the rights of a queen over
her retinue.</p>
<p>She left Stockholm at nightfall five days after her abdication,
stopped at Nykobing for a last visit with her mother, went on,
sleepless, for two days.</p>

<p>Xfell sick with pleurisy, recovered, and rode on to Halmstad. There
she wrote to Gassendi, awarding him a pension and sending him a chain of
gold. At the last moment she received an offer of marriage from the new-
crowned Charles X; she refused it courteously. Then, disguised as a man
and under the name of Count Dohna, she took ship for Denmark, not
knowing that for thirty-five years more she would play a part in
history.</p>

<li>POLAND GOES TO CANOSSA: 1 5 69- 1 648</li>
</ol>
<p>Poland too, in this age, made her peace with the Roman Church, and it
is instructive to see how Catholicism so quickly recovered in that
kingdom nearly all the ground it had lost in the Reformation. But first
let us note, with our usual haste, the political background of the
cultural evolution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The State</li>
</ol>
<p>The period begins with an outstanding achievement of statesmanship.
Southeast of Poland lay the grand duchy of Lithuania, ruled by its own
dukes, and extending from the Baltic through Kiev and the Ukraine to
Odessa and the Black Sea. The growth of Russian power threatened
Lithuania with the loss of its autonomy. Though its Greek Orthodox</p>
<p>Christianity largely agreed with Russia’s, it reluctantly decided
that a merger with Roman Catholic Poland would better preserve its
self-rule than an embrace by the Russian bear. Sigismund II signalized
his reign by signing the historic Union of Lublin (July i, 1569).
Lithuania acknowl- edged the King of Poland as its grand duke, sent
delegates to the Sejm at Warsaw, and accepted that diet, or parliament,
as its government in all external relations; but it kept its own
religion, its own laws, its own control of its internal affairs. Poland,
so enlarged, had now a population of eleven million from Danzig to
Odessa, from sea to sea. It was unquestionably one of the Great
Powers.</p>
<p>The death of Sigismund II (1572), leaving no male heir, brought to an
end that Jagellon dynasty which had begun in 1386 and had given Poland a
line of creative kings and a civilization of religious toleration and
human- istic enlightenment. The nobles had always resented hereditary
monarchy as a violation of their feudal rights and liberties; now they
resolved to keep power in their own hands by making the monarchy
elective; they estab- lished a repubhc of nobles and made Poland ’s
future kings the servants of the Sejm. Since the Sejm included not only
the greater nobles, or magnates, but also the gentry (szlachta), or
lesser nobility, the plan seemed to realize</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 507</p>
<p>Aristotle’s ideal of a go vernment mingling monarchical,
aristocratic, and democratic elements in mutual checks and balances. In
the context of the timej however, the new constitution meant a feudal
reaction, a fragmenta- tion of authority and leadership while Poland’s
Baltic co mpetitors, Sweden and Russia, were being forged into martial
unities by hereditary monarchies privileg’pd to think in terms of
generations. Every royal election now be- came an, auction of noble
votes to the highest bidder among rival candi- dates financed, usually,
by foreign powers. So French agents, by distribut- ing gifts with both
hands, bought the Polish crown for the degenerate Henry of Valois (1573)
— only to have him called back a year later to mis- rule France as Henry
III.</p>
<p>The electoral Diet redeemed itself when, after a chaotic interregnum,
it chose Stephen Bathory as king (1575). As Prince of Transylvania he
had already made a name for himself in politics and war. His agents in
Warsaw had promised that if elected he would pay the national debt, put
200,000 florins into the treasury, recover all territory that Poland had
lost to Russia, and sacrifice his life on the battlefield, if necessary,
for Poland’s honor and</p>
<p>Even so, the nobles were not sure that they liked the new King, with
his sharply penetrating eyes, his realistic mind, his frightening
mustache and authoritative beard. He despised pomp and ceremony, dressed
simply, wore patches, and made beef and cabbage his favorite dish. When
he called for funds for a campaign against Russia they granted him
inadequate supplies grudgingly. Relying upon subsidies from
Transylvania, he advanced with a small army and laid siege to Pskov,
then the third in size of Russian cities. Ivan IV, though Terrible to
his people, felt too old to meet so vigorous a foe. He sued for peace,
yielded Livonia to Poland, and allowed Russia to be cut off from the
Baltic (1582). When Ivan died (1584) Bathory proposed to Sixtus V to
conquer all Russia, unite it with Poland, drive the Turks from Europe,
and bring all Eastern Europe to the papal obedience. The Pope made no
objections, but amid laborious preparations for this crusade Bathory
died (1586). When he had ceased to trouble her, Poland recog- nized him
as one of her greatest kings.</p>
<p>After a year of bargaining the Diet gave the throne to Sigismund 111
, who, as heir to the Swedish crown, might unite the two countries to
con- trol the Baltic and check the expansion of Russia. Half his reign,
as we have seen, was consumed in vain efforts to establish his
authority, and the Cath-</p>
<p>5o8 the age of reason begins (chap. XI</p>
<p>Xolic faith, in Sweden. The sudden death of Boris Godunov (1605),
plung- ing Russia into a defenseless chaos, gave Sigismund another
opportunity. Without consulting the Sejm, he announced his candidacy for
the Musco- vite throne and advanced with an army into Russia. While he
spent two years besieging Smolensk, his general Stanislas Zolkiewski
defeated the Russians at Klushino, marched to Moscow, and persuaded the
Russian nobles to accept Sigismund’s son Ladislas as their king (1610 ).
But Sigis- mund repudiated this arrangement; he, not his son, should be
czar. Having at last taken Smolensk (1611), he marched toward Moscow. He
never reached it, for winter caught up with his dilatory advance. His
unpaid soldiers rebelled, and in December 1612, two centuries before
Napoleon, his army retreated, amid disorder and suffering, from Russia
into Poland. All that remained from the costly campaigns was the
possession of Smo- lensk and Severski, and a strong infusion of Polish
influence into Russian life.</p>
<p>The rest of Sigismund’s reign was a succession of disastrous wars.
His alliance with the Hapsburgs involved him, to the Emperor’s delight,
in an</p>
<p>The Diet gave the crown to his son, for Ladislas (Wladyslaw) IV, now
thirty-seven, had shown his mettle as a general and had won many friends
by his frank and cheerful character. He offended the Pope by tolerating
Protestantism in Poland and the Greek Orthodox Church in Lithuania; and
at Thorn (Torun) he allowed a peaceful public debate of Catholic,
Lutheran, and Calvinist clergymen (1645). He encouraged art and music,
bought Rubens pictures and Gobelin tapestries, established the first
per- manent Polish theater, and staged Italian operas. He corresponded
with the imprisoned Galileo, and invited tKe Protestant scholar Grotius
to his court. He died (1648) just as a great Cossack revolt threatened
the life of the Polish state.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Civilization</li>
</ol>
<p>The Polish economy was still medieval. Internal trade was in the
peddler stage; foreign commerce was largely confined to Danzig and Riga;
the merchant class was negligible in wealth and rarely found admittance
to the Sejm. The nobles controlled the Diet, the king, and the economy.
The large estates were tilled by peasants subject to feudal regulations
in some ways more severe than on the manors of medieval France. The
noble owner</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 509</p>
<p>made these regulations himself and enforced them with his own
soldiery. He forbade his tenants to leave his jurisdiction without his
consent; he transferred them from place to place; he increased or
diminished their lands at his own will; he exacted several days of
unpaid labor from them yearly; he obliged them to buy and sell only from
or to him; he compelled them to buy from him a certain annual quantity
of badly brewed ale; he could conscript their children to serve him in
peace or war. Legally they were free; they could own and bequeath
property; but the Jesuit Father Skarga described them as slaves.®^</p>
<p>Life was mostly rural. The nobles gathered in Warsaw to vote their
col- lective will, but they lived on their estates, hunting, quarreling,
loving, feasting, giving one another openhanded hospitality, and
training them- selves for war. Marriages were arranged by the parents;
the girl was rarely asked, and she rarely resisted; it was assumed that
love generated by mar- riage and parentage would be more enduring than
marriage generated by love. Women were modest and industrious. Sexual
morality was firmly maintained; we hear of no extramarital love affairs
before the eighteenth century.*® Men, rather than women, molded manners,
except that Cecilia Renata, who married Ladislas IV in 1637, refreshed
the Italian influences imported by artists and clergymen in earlier
times; and Louise Marie de Gonzague, whom he married in 1648, brought
with her a wave of French manners and speech that lasted till the
twentieth century. Polish dances had a grave grace that as early as 1647
led a Frenchman to speak with admira- tion of the polonaise.</p>
<p>Polish art could not keep the pace that Veit Stoss had set at Cracow
in</p>
<ol start="1477" type="1">
<li>The splendid tapestries of Sigismund II were woven in Flanders.
Architects and sculptors from Italy raised the monuments to Sigismund
and Bathory and Anna Jagellon in the Cracow cathedral, the baroque
churches of the Jesuits in Cracow and Nieswiez, and the famous Sigismund
III Column in Warsaw. Painting languished under the Protestant attack
upon religious images, but Martin Kober made a revealing portrait of
Bathory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Education, like the graphic arts, suffered from the religious
turmoil. The University of Cracow was in passing decay, but Bathory
founded the University of Wilno (1578), and at Cracow, Wilno, Poznan,
Riga, and elsewhere the Jesuits established colleges of such excellence
that many Protestants favored them for the mental and moral training of
their sons. Better still was the Unitarian school at Rakow, which
attracted a thousand students from all the creeds. Jan Zamojski, the
humanist Chancellor of Bathory, organized in Zamo^c a new university
devoted chiefly to the classical curriculum.</p>
<p>There was an abundant literature. Religious controversy was often
rude in epithets but polished in form; so Stanislas Orzechowski, who
defended</p>
<p>510 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XT</p>
<p>XCatholicism, laid about him with violent intolerance, but “in
wonderful Polish, among the best in our history.”*® Equally noted for
its style was The Polish Courtier (1566), by Lukasz Gornicki, an
adaptation of Casti- glione’s Cortegiano. The Jesuit Pet er Skargo was
eminent in prose and verse, in education and politics. He passed from
the presidency of Wilno University to be for twenty-four years the
Bossuet of Poland as the lead- ing preacher at the royal court; and he
denounced without fear the cor- ruption that surrounded him. He
predicted that unless the nation could evolve a more stable and
centralized government it would fall a prey to foreign powers; but he
called for a responsible monarchy limited and re- strained by law. The
poetry of Jan Kochanowski remained unrivaled in his own field and tongue
till the nineteenth century, and is still popular today. He reached the
height of his inspiration in his treny (threnody or lament) for his
daughter Ursula, dead in the full charm of childhood.</p>
<p>All Polish culture in this age was disturbed by the conflict of
creeds. In the first half of the sixteenth century Protestantism seemed
destined to cap- ture Poland as well as Germany and Sweden. Many nobles
were won to it as a rebellion against royal authority and ecclesiastical
corruption, and as a means of appropriating Church property.** Sigismund
II granted a wide religious toleration. A year after his death a
committee of the Diet drew up (January 28, 1 573) the “Confederation of
Warsaw,” guar anteeing religious liberty to all dissidentes de religione
without exception. When put to a vote it was opposed by the episcopal
members of the Diet, but it was unanimously approved by the ninety-eight
lay members, including forty- one Catholics.** It represents a landmark
in the history of toleration, for no previous official proclamation had
gone so far. Under this broad protection a variety of sects flourished:
Lutherans, Calvinists, Zwinglians, Anabaptists, Bohemian Brethren,
Anti-Trinitarians. In 1579 Faustus Socinus came to Poland and began to
organize a church on Unitarian lines; but the Cracow populace dragged
him from his house, destroyed his library, and would have killed him had
not the Catholic rector of the university come to his aid (1598).*® The
Calvinists united with the Lutherans in demanding the expulsion of the
“Socinians” from Poland. The Diet in 1638 ordered</p>
<p>he closing of the Unitarian schools, and in 1658 banished the sect
from the country. They fled to Transylvania, Hungary, Germany, Holland,
Eng- land, and at last to America, to find their most genial voice in
Emerson.</p>
<p>Popular intolerance, Jesuit pedagogy. Catholic discipline, and
royal</p>
<p>politics joined with Protestant sectarianism to destroy Protestantism
in Poland. The new sects fought one another as vigorously as they
opposed the ancient creed. The peasants clung to the old faith because
it was old; it had the comfort of custom on its side. When the kings —
Bathory and Sigismund III — rallied to it, many Protestant converts or
their children found it pleasant to make their peace with the Church.
The fact that most</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 511</p>
<p>of the Germans in Poland were Protestants gave Catholicism the help
of nationalist sentiment. And the Church actively co-operated with these
extraneous aids to reclaim Poland for the papacy. She sent some of her
most subtle diplomats and most enterprising Jesuits to win the kings,
the women and children, even the Protestant nobles themselves.
Ecclesiastical statesmen like Cardinal Stanislas Hosius and Bishop
Giovanni Commendone warned the kings that no stable social, moral, or
political order could be based upon the fluid and clashing Protestant
creeds. The Jesuits proved themselves well able to defend the old
incredibilities against the new. Mean- while the Catholic clergy,
submitting to the decrees of the Council of Trent, underwent a rigorous
and impressive reform.®’</p>
<p>The Catholics too had a problem. The union of Lithuania with Poland
brought the Greek Orthodox Church into irritating contact with the</p>
<p>Roman. Their creeds differed slightly, but the Orthodox services used
the Slavonic ritual, and the Orthodox priests had wives. In 1596 Jan
Zamojski, by the Union of Brze^c (Brest Litovsk), formed a middle group
of clergy and laity into a Uniat Church, which adhered to clerical
marriage and the Slavonic rite, but accepted the Roman creed and the
papal supremacy. Roman Catholic leaders hoped that the compromise would
gradually win the Greek and Russian communions to the papal obedience,
but the new church encountered passionate resistance, and its archbishop
at Polock was murdered by the Orthodox populace.</p>
<p>The Polish kings continued throughout the sixteenth century a
religious toleration more advanced than in any other Christian country,
but the Catholic population frequently returned to the old policy of
violent hos- tility. They attacked a Protestant church in Cracow and
exhumed and scat- tered corpses from Protestant graves (1606-7). They
destroyed a Protes- tant church in Wilno and beat — ^some say killed —
the ministers (161 1). In Poznan they burned down a Lutheran church and
demolished a conventicle of the Bohemian Brethren.®® The Catholic clergy
took no part in these popular theological demonstrations, but they
profited from them. All circumstances conspired to favor the old Church,
and by 1648 her victory was complete.</p>

<p>XCaspian; not yet, however, to the Black Sea — hence many wars. The
popu- lation was only ten million in 1571.®® The soil might easily have
fed these millions, but reckless tillage exhausted farm after farm, and
the peasants moved on to fresher fields.</p>
<p>This migratory tendency seems to have shared in bringing serfdom.
Most tenants received advances from their boyar landlords to clear,
equip, and plant their farms; they paid as much as 20 per cent on such
loans;^® many of them, unable to repay their borrowings, fell into
servitude to their land- lords, for a law of 1497 made a delinquent
debtor the slave of his creditor till the debt was redeemed. To escape
such servitude some peasants fled to Cossack camps in the south; some
won freedom by agreeing to develop new and difficult terrain — and so
Siberia was settled; some migrated to the towns to join the craftsmen
there, or work in the mines or in the metallurgical or ammunition
industries, or to serve the merchants, or peddle goods in the streets.
The landowners complained that the desertion of farms by tenants —
usually leaving debts unpaid — disrupted agricultural production, and
made it impossible for the owners to pay the rising taxes demanded by
the state. In 1581 Ivan the Terrible, to assure continuous cultivation,
forbade the tenants of his administrative class ( the oprichniki) to
leave their farms without the owner’s consent. Tho ugh that class was
now losing its distinc- tive existence, the serfdom so established
continued on its estates, and was soon demanded of their tenants by the
nobles and the clergy who owned the greater part of Russia’s land. By
1648 most Russian peasant s were in fact, if not in law, serfs bound to
the soil.^^</p>
<p>Russia was still close to barbarism. Manners were coarse, cleanliness
was a rare luxury, literacy was a class privilege, education was
primitive, litera- ture was largely monkish chronicles, priestly
homilies, or liturgical texts. Of five hundred books published in Russia
between 1613 and 1682, nearly all were religious.^® Music played a
prominent role in religion and in the home, and art was the handmaid of
the Orthodox faith. Architecture built complex churches bulging with
chapels and apses and bulbous domes, like the Church of the Virgin of
the Don in Moscow. Painting adorned churches and monasteries with
frescoes, now mostly covered over, or raised iconos- tases (icon panels)
rich in pictorial invention rather than artistic skill,^® as in the
Church of the Miracle of St. Michael at Cracow. By 1600 icon painting
had ceased to be an art and had become an industry, producing
stereotyped pieces on a large scale for domestic piety. The outstanding
art product of the age was the hundred-meters-high bell tower of Ivan
Veliki (John the Great), raised by a German architect in the Kremlin</p>
<p>Square (c. 1600) as part of Boris Godunov’s program of public works
to relieve unemployment.</p>
<p>In the picturesque churches, bright with costly ornaments, somber

<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>calculated gloom, hypnotic with solemn ceremony and sonorous chants
and prayers, the Orthodox clergy molded the people to piety, obedience,
and humble hope. Seldom has a religion so closely co-operated with the
government. The czar gave the example of faithful religious observance
and beneficence to the Church; in return the Church invested him with
awesome sanctity, made his throne an inviolable altar, and inculcated
sub- mission and service to him as a duty owed to God. Boris Godunov es-
tablished the patriarchate of Moscow as independent of Constantinople
(1598); and for almost a century the metropolitan of Moscow rivaled the
dignity, sometimes challenged the power, of the czar. When (1594) an
embassy came to Moscow from Pope Clement VIII to propose a union of the
Orthodox and Latin churches under the papacy, Boris rejected the plan
with scor n. “Moscow,” he said, “is now the true orthodox Rome”; and he
caused prayers to be offered up for himself as “the only Christian ruler

<li>Boris Godunov: 1<sup>84-160</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>As yet he was ruler in fact only. The Czar was Feodor I Ivanovich ( 1
584-</p>
<p>1598), the feeble son of Ivan IV the Terrible, and the last of the
Rurik line. Feodor had seen his elder brother die under his father’s
demonic blow; he had allowed his own will to be broken; he took refuge
from the dangers of the palace in devotion to religion; and though his
people called him a saint, they recognized that he lacked the iron to
govern men. Ivan IV had appointed a council to guide the youth; one
member of it, Feodor’s brother - in-law, Boris Godunov, made himself
dominant and became the ruler of the reign.</p>
<p>Ivan IV, by the last of his seven wives, had left another son,
Dmitri</p>
<p>Ivanovich, who was now (1584) three years old. To protect the child
from intrigues other than their own, the Council sent him and his mother
to live in Uglich, some 120 miles north of Moscow. There, in 1591, the
young Czarevich died, by means not yet determined. A commission headed
by Prince Vasili Shuiski (a member of the Council) went to Uglich to in-
vestigate; it reported that the boy had cut his throat in an epileptic
fit; but Dmitri’s mother charged that he had been killed by an order of
Godunov.^® Boris’ guilt was never established, and is questioned by some
historians.^® The mother was forced to take the veil, and her relatives
were banished from Moscow. Dmitri was added to the calendar of Orthodox
saints, and was temporarily forgotten.</p>
<p>Like Richard III of England, Boris ruled more successfully as
regent</p>
<p>han later on the throne. Though lacking formal education, and
perhaps</p>
<p>514 the age of reason begins (chap. XI</p>
<p>Xilliterate, he had a shrewd ability, and seems to have labored
earnestly to meet the problems of Russian life. He reformed internal
administration, checked judicial venality, favored the lower and middle
classes, undertook public works to give employment to the urban poor,
mitigated the lot and the dues of the serfs, and — says a contemporary
chronicle — was “beloved of all men.”^^ He enjoyed the respect and
confidence of foreign powers.’<em>® When Czar Feodor I died (1598), the
Zemski Sobor, or national assembly, unanimously asked Godunov to take
the crown. He accepted it with coy protestations of unworthiness, but
there is some suspicion that the assembly had been prepared by his
agents. Several nobles, resenting his defense of the commonalty,</em>®
contested his right to the throne, and conspired to depose him. Boris
imprisoned some, exiled some, and compelled Feodor Romanov (father of
the first Romanov czar) to become a monk. Several of the defeated group
died so conveniently for Boris that he was accused of having them
murdered. Living now in suspicion and fear, he spread spies everywhere,
deported suspects, confiscated their property, put men and women to
death. His early popularity faded, and the poor harvests of 1600-04 him
without the support of the starving populace against the persisting
intrigues of the nobility.</p>
<p>One intrigue became famous in history, literature, and music. In 1603
a young man appeared in Poland who claimed that he was the supposedly
dead Dmitri, the legitimate heir to the throne of Feodor Ivanovich.
Boris, on good grounds,®® identified him as Grishka Otrepieff, an
unfrocked monk who had been in the service of the Romanov family. The
Poles, fearful of expanding Russia, were pleased to find in their midst,
available to their use, a claimant to the crown of Muscovy; they were
further delighted when “Dmitri” married a Polish girl and joined the
Roman Church. King Sigis - mund III, who had just signed (1602) a truce
with Russia for twenty years, connived at Dmitri’s recruiting of Polish
volunteers. The Jesuits warmly espoused the pretender’s cause. In
October 1604 Dmitri crossed the Dnieper with four thousand men,
including Russian exiles, German mercenaries, and Polish knights. The
Russian nobles, professing neutrality, gave him secret support; fugitive
peasants joined the advancing force; the starving people, longing to be
deceived, accepted the new Dmitri at his word, and carried his banner as
the symbol of monarchical legitimacy and their desper- ate hopes. While
the shouting, praying mob moved upon Moscow from the west, the Cossacks,
always ready for a fray, dashed up from the south. The movement became a
revolution.</p>
<p>Seeing it as a Polish invasion, Boris sent his army westward. It
defeated a detachment of Dmitri’s forces, but missed the rest. In his
Kremlin cham - bers Godunov received no news but of the swelling and
advancing mob, the spreading disaffection, the toasts drunk by the
boyars even in Moscow</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 515</p>
<p>o the health of Dmitri, whom they heralded to the people as the holy
czarevich chosen by God to be czar. Suddenly, after doubts and agonies
known to Pushkin and Moussorgsky rather than to history, Boris died
(April 13, 1605). He had commended his son Feodor to the care of</p>
<p>Patriarch Basmanov and the boyars; but the priest and the nobles went
over to the pretender. Godunov’s son and widow were killed, and in a
delirium of national ecstasy the “False Dmitri” was hailed and crowned
as Czar of All the Russias.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">

</ol>
<p>The new Czar was not a bad ruler as kings go. Unimposing in stature,
unprepossessing in face, he could nevertheless handle a sword and ride a
horse like a born boyar. He had a perceptive and furnished mind,
eloquent address, genial manners, and an unaffected simplicity that
shocked the protocol of palace life. He surprised his staff by assiduity
in administration, and his army by training it in person. But his
superiority to his environment was too conscious and manifest. He openly
expressed his scorn of boyar coarseness and illiteracy; he proposed to
send noble sons to be educated in the West; he planned to import foreign
teachers to establish high schools in Moscow. He laughed at Russian
customs and neglected Orthodox ritual; he failed to salute the images of
the saints, he dined without having the table sprinkled with holy water,
he ate veal, which was considered ritually unclean. He concealed —
perhaps he had never taken seriously — his con- version to Catholicism,
but he brought to Moscow his Polish Catholic wife, escorted by
Franciscan friars and a papal legate; he himself had Poles and Jesuits
in his entourage. He spent too freely the revenues of the treasury,
doubling the pay of army officers and allotting to his friends the
estates confiscated from the Godunov family. Restless and martial, he
planned a campaign against the Khan of the Crimea, and practically
declared war by sending the Moslem ruler a pigskin coat. When he almost
denuded Moscow of soldiers by ordering them south, the boyars feared
that he was opening the capital to Polish invasion.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Dmitri’s accession a boyar faction under Shuiski
con - spired to depose him. Shuiski confessed that he had recognized the
pretender only to get rid of Godunov; now the tool must be cast aside
and a real boyar enthroned.®^ Dmitri discovered the plot and had the
leaders arrested. In- stead of summarily executing them, as tradition
demanded, he granted them a trial by the Zemski Sobor — which, for the
first time, was now chosen from all ranks and classes. When it condemned
Shuiski and others to death, he commuted the sentence to banishment, and
after five months he allowed</p>
<p>5i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xhe exiles to return. Many who had believed him to be the son of Ivan
the Terrible felt that such unorthodox clemency cast doubt on his
royal</p>
<p>parentage. The pardoned conspirators renewed their conspiracy; the
Ro- manov family, upon which Dmitri had rained plums of patronage,
joined in the plot. On May 17, 1606, Shuiski and his followers invaded
the Kremlin with their armed retainers. Dmitri defended himself well,
killing several of his assailants with his own hand, but he was overcome
and slain. His body was exposed on the place of executions; a ribald
mask was thrown over his face, a flute was placed in his mouth; later
his corpse was burned, and a cannon shot his ashes to the winds to
discourage further resurrections.</p>
<p>The victorious boyars proclaimed Shuiski Czar Vasili IV. He bound
him- self to put no man to death, to confiscate no property, without
consent of the Duma — ^the assembly of boyars; and he solemnly vowed, in
the Uspen- ski Cathedral, “that ill shall unto no man be done without
the Council” — i.e., the Zemski Sobor, or assembly of all classes. These
guarantees, though often violated, formed a historic step in the
evolution of the Russian gov- ernment.</p>
<p>They failed to appease those large elements of the population
that</p>
<p>mourned the deposition of Dmitri. A rebellion broke out in the north;
a second False Dmitri was set up as its leader, and Sigismund III of
Poland gave him unofficial support. Shuiski solicited the aid of
Sigismund’s enemy, Charles IX of Sweden; Charles sent a Swedish force
into Russia; Sigismund declared war upon Russia; his general Zolkiewski
took Moscow. Shuiski was deposed (1610), was carried off to Warsaw, and
was forced to become a monk. A faction of the boyars agreed to recognize
Sigismund’s fourteen - year-old son Ladislas as czar, on condition that
the independence of the Orthodox Church be maintained and that the
Polish army help the nobles to suppress the social revolt that was
threatening aristocratic government in Russia.</p>
<p>The revolt was first of all a religious and patriotic repudiation of
a</p>
<p>Polish czar. Hermogenes, Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow, forbade the
people to swear allegiance to a Roman Catholic sovereign. The Poles ar-
rested him; he soon died in his cell, but his proclamation made
Ladislas’ rule impossible. Religious leaders called upon the people to
drive out the Poles as Roman Catholic heretics. Government seemed to
dissolve, and Russia fell into turmoil. A Swedish army held Novgorod and
proposed a Swedish prince for the Russian throne. Peasants in the north
and the south, Cossacks in the south, repudiated Ladislas and set up
their own rule in the provinces. Bands of brigands pillaged villages and
towns and tortured all who resisted. Agriculture was disrupted, food
production fell, transporta- tion was hazardous, famine rose, and in
some districts the population re- sorted to eating human flesh.®® A
rebel mob entered Moscow, and in the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 517</p>
<p>confusion most of the city was burned to the ground (March 19, 1611).
The Polish garrison retreated into the Kremlin and waited in vain for
Sigismund to come to its support.</p>
<p>At Nizhni Novgorod a butcher, Kosma Minin, organized another rebel
army, inspired by Orthodox devotion. He called upon each family to give
up a third of its possessions to finance an advance upon the capital; it
was done. But the people would follow only a titled leader. Minin
invited Prince Dmitri Pozharski to serve as their general. He consented,
and the new army marched upon Moscow, fasting and praying. Arrived, they
laid siege to the Polish garrison in the Kremlim It held out till it was
reduced to eating rats and men and boiling Greek manuscripts for broth;
then (Octo- ber 22, 1612) it surrendered and fled. That year was long
celebrated in Russian memory as the year of liberation, and when, two
centuries later, the French were driven from Moscow, the victorious
Russians set up in their again incinerated capital a monument to Minin
and Pozharski, the butcher and the prince who had set them so heroic an
example in 1612.</p>
<p>Pozharski and Prince Dmitri Troubetskoy invited lay and
ecclesiastical representatives from all regions of the empire to a
council for the election of a new ruler. Various boyar families pulled
various wires; finally the Romanovs prevailed; the council chose Michael
Romanov, then only fifteen, and the Moscow populace, quickly gathered
and quickly coached, acclaimed him Czar (February 21, 1613). The people,
having saved the state, humbly returned it to the nobility.</p>
<p>The new government suppressed social disorder and revolt, confirmed
and extended serfdom, pacified Sweden by ceding Ingria, and signed a
fourteen-year truce with Poland. The truce freed from long captivity
Michael’s father, Feodor Romanov, whom Boris ha d forced to become the
monk Philaret. Michael made him Patriarch of Moscow, and welcomed him as
a councilor so powerful that the people called Philaret “the Second
Czar.” Under the combined rule of father and son, despite more uprisings
and wars, Russia achieved, after a generation of turmoil, an unsteady
and discontented peace. The Time of Troubles {Smutnoe Vremia), which had
begun with Boris’ death, ended with Michael’s accession; and this in
turn began the Romanov dynasty, which was to rule Russia till 1917.</p>
