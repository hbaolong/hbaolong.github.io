<p>The People</p>
<p>1 7 1 4 - 5 6</p>
<p>T HE England that Voltaire found was a nation enjoying a quarter</p>
<p>century of relative peace after a generation of costly victories
over</p>
<p>France; a nation now mistress of the seas, therefore of commerce,
therefore of money; holding the lever and balance of power over
Continental govern- ments; proudly triumphant over a Stuart dynasty that
had sought to make it Catholic, and over Hanoverian kings who were the
servants of Parlia- ment’s swelling purse. This was the England tha t
had just won world pre- eminence in science through Newton, that had
just produced the uninten- tionally revolutionary Locke, that was
undermining Christianity with deism, that would substitute Alexander
Pope for all the pontiffs of Rome, that would soon watch uncomfortably
the devastating operations of David Hume. It was the England that
Hogarth loved and excoriated in engrav- ings, the England where Handel
found home and audience and outshone all the Bachs as the maestro dei
maestri of the age. And here, in this “fortress built by Nature for
herself against infection, . . . this blessed plot, . . . this England,”
1 the Industrial Revolution began to transform everything but man.</p>
<p>I. PRELUDE TO THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Sustainers</li>
</ol>
<p>Defoe, traversing England in 1722, drew a patriotic picture of “the
most flourishing and opulent country in the world,” of green fields and
over - flowing crops, of pastures rambled by golden fleece, of lush
grass turning into plump kine, of peasants roistering in rural sports,
squires organizing peasants, nobles organizing squires, lordly manors
giving law and discipline to villages, and now and then, refuge to poets
and philosophers. 2 Word peddlers tend to idealize the countryside, if
they are exempt from its harass- ments, boredom, insects, and toil.</p>
<p>Rural life in the England of 1715 was very much as it had been for a
thousand years. Each village — almost each household — was a
self-contained economic</p>
<p>4 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>unit, growing its own food, making its own clothing, cutting its
timber for building and fuel from the adjacent woods. Each family baked
its bread, hunted its venison, salted its meat, made its butter,
jellies, and cheese. It spun and wove and sewed; it tanned leather and
cobbled shoes; it made most of its utensils, implements, and tools. So
father, mother, and children found work and expres- sion not only in the
summer fields but in the long winter evenings; the home was a hub of
industry as well as of agriculture. The wife was an honored mistress of
many arts, from nursing her husband and rearing a dozen children to
making frocks and brewing ale. She kept and dispensed the household
medicines; she took care of the garden, the pigs, and the fowl. Marriage
was a union of help- mates; the family was an economic as well as a
social organism, and had thereby a solid reason and basis for its unity,
multiplication, and permanence.</p>
<p>The peasants might have been content with the varied vitality of
their homes if they had been allowed to preserve their ancient ways in
the fields. They remembered when the landlord had permitted them, or
their forebears, to graze their livestock on the manor’s common fields,
to fish freely in its streams, to</p>
<ol start="1688" type="1">
<li>Voltaire, about 1730, reported “in England many peasants with
200,000 francs’ worth of property, and who do not disdain to continue
cultiva ting the earth that has enriched them, and in which they live
free”; but this may have been propaganda for French stimulation. In any
case, by 1750 the number of freeholders had declined. 3 The fatter
landlords were buying up the thinner tracts; the small homestead,
designed for family subsistence or local markets, was giving place to
larger farms capable of profiting from improved methods and machines;
the farmer was becoming a tenant or hired “hand.” Moreover, the system
of tillage predominant in England in 1715 divided the land of a village
into different regions according to their fertility and accessibility;
each farmer received one or more strips in the separate localities;
co-operation was necessary, individual enterprise was balked, production
lagged. The enclosers argued that large-scale operation under unified
ownership increased agricultural production, facilitated sheep
pasturage, and allowed a profitable output of wool; and doubt- less they
were right. Economic progress shut at least one eye to the human turmoil
of displacement and transition.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was chiefly on the expanded farms that agricultural technology
advanced. The profit motive brought wastelands under cultivation,
disciplined labor to greater efficiency, stimulated the invention of new
tools and ways, promoted experiments in animal breeding, and sustained
the toil of draining marshes, checking soil erosion, and clearing woods.
Between 1696 and 1795 some two million acres were added to the
cultivated area of England and Wales. In 1730</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Charles Townshend introduced the four-course system of crop rotation
instead of the wasteful plan of letting a third of the land lie fallow
in each year: he planted wheat or oats in the first year, barley or oats
in the second, clover, rye, vetches, rutabaga, and kale in the third,
turnips in the fourth; then the sheep were brought in to eat the turnips
or trample them into the ground, while their offal fertilized the soil;
so the earth was prepared for a rich crop of wheat in the next year. His
neighbors laughed at him, and called him Turnip Townshend, until a
thirty per cent increase in his crops turned them to imitation. As Town-
shend was a viscount, other aristocrats followed him in improving their
land; it became the fashion for an English lord to take a personal
interest in agricul- ture, and the talk of the manors passed from
hunting and dogs to turnips and manure. 4</p>
<p>Jethro Tull was a lawyer; his health failing, he went back to his
father’s farm; his sharpened mind was fascinated by the miracle and
profits of growth, but was repelled by the wasteful methods of tillage
that he saw — farmers broadcasting nine or ten po unds of seed to an
acre so carelessly “that two thirds of the ground was unplanted, and on
the rest ’twas so thick that it did not prosper.” 5 Traveling in France
and Italy, he studied agricultural methods; returning, he bought a farm,
and shocked his neighbors with inventions that doubled production. He
began (c. 1730) by making a four-coultered plow that would uproot and
bury weeds instead of merely shoving them aside. But his most decisive
invention (c. 1733) was a horse-drawn drill mechanism that fed seed
through notched funnels at a specific spacing and depth in two parallel
rows, and then covered the seeds by a harrow attached to the drill. The
machine saved seed and labor, and allowed the cultivation, aeration,
irrigation, and weeding of the soil between the seeded rows. This
apparently trivial change in sowing, and the improvement of the plow,
shared in what came to be called the agricultural revolution, whose
effects can be measured (even allowing for inflation) by the tenfold
rise, during the eighteenth century, in the value of the lands where the
new methods were used. The increased productivity of the soil enabled
the farms to feed more workers in the towns, and made possible that
growing urban population without which there could have been no
Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Neither the peasants nor the town workers shared in the growing
wealth. Peasant proprietors were squeezed out by large-scale
competition; peasant laborers were paid as little as the fear of
unemployment compelled them to accept. Hear the learned and high-caste
Trevelyan:</p>
<p>The social price paid for economic gain was a decline in the number
of independent cultivators, and a rise in the number of landless
laborers.</p>
<p>To a large extent this was a necessary evil, and there would have
been less harm in it if the increased dividend of the agricultural world
had been fairly distributed. But while the landlord’s rent, the parson’s
tithe, and the profits of 〔landowning〕 farmer and middleman all rose
apace, the field laborer, deprived of his little rights in 〔the
common〕 land and</p>
<p>4 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>his family’s by -employment in industry, received no proper compensa-
tion in high wages, and in the Southern Counties too often sank into a
position of dependence and pauperism. 9</p>
<p>The natural concentration of wealth was in some measure mitigated by
taxation and organized charity. The English rich, unlike the French
nobles, paid the larger part of the taxes that supported the government.
The Poor Laws, which had begun in 1536, required each parish to succor
persons in danger of starvation. The able-bodied unemployed were sent to
work- houses, the disabled were committed to almshouses; the children
were bound out as apprentices to those willing to lodge and feed them
for their services. The expenses of the system were paid by a tax on the
households of the parish. A parliamentary committee reported that of all
the children born in workhouses, or those received in infancy, in the
years 1763-65, only seven per cent were alive in 1 7 66. 1 It was a hard
century.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Industry</li>
</ol>
<p>The self-sufficient home of the countryside retarded, for good or
ill, the specialization of labor and the Industrial Revolution. Why
should the nascent capitalist finance a factory when he could have a
hundred families weave and spin for him under their own roofs and the
automatic discipline of competition? In the West Riding district of
Yorkshire this domestic industry produced 100,000 pieces of cloth for
the market in 1740, and 140,000 pieces in 1750; as late as 1856 only
half the woolen production of Yorkshire came from factories, half still
came from homes. 8 Nevertheless those busy households were incipient
factories: the head of the family invited servants and outsiders to join
in the work; additional rooms were equipped with spinning wheels and
looms. As these domestic operations in- creased in size, and the market
widened through improved roads and con- trol of the seas, domestic
industry itself created a demand for better tools. The first inventions
were implements rather than machines; they could be installed in homes,
like Kay’s flying shutt le; only when the inventors made machines that
required mechanical power did the factory system replace domestic
industry.</p>
<p>The transition was gradual; it took almost a century (1730-1830), and
perhaps “revolution” is too dramatic a term for so leisurely a change.
The break with the past was not so sharp as the romantification of
history once suggested. Industry was as old as civilization; invention
had progressed at a quickening pace since th e thirteenth century; in
Dante’s Florence fac - tories were as numerous as poets; in Rembrandt’s
Holland capitalists were as numerous as artists. But taken in its
progressive stages of steam, electric-</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>ity, oil, electronics, and atomic energy, the industrial
transformation of the last two centuries (1760-1960), as compared with
the rate of economic change in Europe before Columbus, constitutes a
real revolution, basically transforming not only agriculture, transport,
communication, and industry, but also politics, manners, morality,
religion, philosophy, and art.</p>
<p>Many factors flowed together in compelling industrial change. The
wars that followed the fall of Walpole’s ministry (1742) intensified the
urge to accelerate production and distribution. The growth of
population, as a result of the rising food supply, offered a swelling
domestic market for both agriculture and industry, and encouraged the
making of better machines and roads. The machines required skills, which
led to a specialization and division of labor promoting productivity.
Huguenot and other immigrants brought to England their salvaged savings
and their crafts; it was a Hugue- not descendant who invented the first
spinning machine (1738). The adoption of protective tariffs by
Parliament (e.g., the “Calico Act” of 1721, prohibiting the use of
imported printed calicos) narrowed foreign com- petition, and gave the
English textile industry full control of the home market; while the
growing influence of the merchants on legislation favored the extension
of the British economy. In the middle and lower classes the Puritan
tradition — soon to be reinforced by the Methodist movement- encouraged
the virtues of industriousness, enterprise, and thrift; capital was
accumulated, wealth was sanctioned, and the bourgeoisie seemed to enjoy
the special grace of God.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the development of mining offered an expanding supply of
coal as a fuel for industry. Wood had hitherto been the major fuel for
homes and shops, but forests were being thinned to extinction; of
sixty-nine great forests known to medieval England sixty-five had
disappeared by the end of the eighteenth century. 9 Timber had to be
imported from Scandi- navia or America; it cost more and more, and
demand arose for a cheaper fuel. But the mining of coal was still a
primitive process; shafts were shal- low, ventilation was crude; methane
and carbonic-acid gas choked the miners; and the problem of pumping
water out of the mines remained un- solved till the steam engines of
Savery and Newcomen; indeed, this problem was the chief incentive to the
development of such engines. Despite these difficulties the production
of coal mounted and spread, so that by 1750 the coal burned in homes and
factories was already darkening the London sky. 10</p>
<p>The importance of coal for the Industrial Revolution lay especially
in its use for smelting iron ore into purer, tougher, malleable iron by
separat- ing the metal from the minerals attached to it. Smelting
required fusion, which required a high degree of heat; this, since the
fourteenth century, had been produced by burning charcoal (i.e., charred
wood) in blast</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>furnaces supplied with heavy drafts of air; but now charcoal was
becoming costlier through the falling supply of wood. In 1612 Simon
Sturtevant recommended coal as smelter fuel; “Dud” Dudley claimed in
1619 that by these means he reduced the cost of smelting iron by one
half; but his char- coal-using rivals united to drive him out of
business. Finally (c. 1709) Abraham Darby I, settling at Coalbrookdale,
where coal was plentiful, successfully and economically smelted iron ore
by heating it with coke — i.e., coal “cooked,” or burned, sufficiently
to free it from its volatile ele - ments. Coke itself had been known as
far back as 1590. Abraham Darby II developed the use of coal or coke in
smelting, and improved the blast fur- nace with bellows worked by a
water wheel; soon he was able to outsell •all other ironmasters in
England. In 1728 the first English rolling mill was set up to pass iron
between a succession of cylinders to compress it into desired forms. In
1740 Benjamin Huntsman invented the crucible process by which high-grade
steel was produced through heating and purifying metal in clay pots. It
was these developments in the marriage of coal with iron that made
possible the machines of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Invention</li>
</ol>
<p>The first half of the eighteenth century saw no spectacular
acceleration of invention as compared with the two preceding centuries;
and half a volume might be required to list the inventions that this age
inherited from the past. As one example, the clock, so necessary in
science, industry, and navigation, was almost perfected in the
seventeenth century; by 1758 it reached a degree of accuracy (one
minute’s deviation in six hundred days) not surpassed till 1877. 11 The
workers themselves, though often the source of inventions, discouraged
them as threatening technological disemploy- ment; so the hostility of
labor compelled the abandonment of the first English sawmill (1663); not
till 1767 was the attempt successfully renewed. Industrial invention was
further retarded by poor roads; there was little incentive to increase
production so long as the expansion of the market was hindered by
difficulties of transport. Marine transportation, however, was
improving; colonies, almost entirely agricultural, were avid customers
for manufactured products; here was a rising stimulus to invention. The
profit motive helped; Parliament granted patent rights for fourteen
years. Foreign competition in the export trade provided another
stimulus; so the textiles of India, produced by skilled but low-paid
labor, spurred English manu- facturers to economy of production through
improved mechanical equip- ment. Hence it was in textile machinery that
invention inaugurated the great change.</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>5 1</p>
<p>The first outstanding invention in textile production was John
Kay’s</p>
<p>“flying shuttle” (1733); here might be dated the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution. Previously, with minor exceptions, the width of
the cloth to be woven had been limited to the stretch of the weaver’s
arms, for he had to throw the shuttle (the instrument that passed the
threads of the woof through those of the warp) from one side of the loom
with one hand and catch it with the other hand at the opposite side. Kay
arranged a mechanism of wheels, hammers, and rods whereby a sharp tap of
the hand would send the shuttle flying from one side to an automatic
stop at any predetermined width, with a considerable saving of time.
When he sought to install his invention at a mill in Colchester the
weavers denounced him as trying to deprive them of their daily bread. He
fled to Leeds (1738), and offered his patent to the cloth manufacturers
for a fee; they took his invention, but withheld his royalties; he sued,
and was ruined by legal costs. He went to his native Bury, but there the
populace rose in a riot against him (1753), sacked his home, and
threatened to kill him. One woman, however, greeted his machine with
enthusiasm, crying, “Weel, weel! The warks o’ God be wonderful, but the
contrivance 0’ man bates Him at last!” 12 Kay found more acceptance in
France, whose government adopted his invention and awarded him a
pension. Not till 1760 did the flying shuttle surmount all opposition
and pass into common use.</p>
<p>The textile industry was hampered by the fact that weavers could
weave yarn faster than spinners could spin and supply it. Till 1738
spinning was done by hand, on wheels that still adorn homes idealizing
the past. In that year Lewis Paul, son of a Huguenot immigrant, patented
a spinning machine built apparently on lines suggested by John Wyatt: a
system of rollers drew out the corded ropes of cotton or wool into
threads of any desired fineness, and spun it on spindles, all with a
minimum of toil. Paul and Wyatt sold the patent to Edward Cave, friend
of Dr. Johnson. Cave set up five machines in a Northampton factory in
1742 — the first of a long succession of spinning mills in old and New
England.</p>
<p>Now that iron could be treated to make strong machines, and economic
conditions called for large-scale production, the problem remained of
find- ing some mechanical power to substitute cheaply for the muscles of
men and the patience of women. The earliest solution was through water
power. In a hundred countries the great water wheel, leisurely turning
with the flow of streams, had from time unremembered moved pumps,
bellows, rollers, hammers, even, since 1 500, heavy iron machines. It
continued to be the main source of mechanical energy through the
eighteenth century; it survived into the twentieth; and the hydraulic
installations of our time are water power transformed into portable
electricity. The motive power of winds was not so reliable;
comparatively little use was made of it in the</p>

<p>calm lands of the south; but in northern latitudes the air currents
were set to work turn ing windmills whose “sails” could be set into the
“eye of the</p>
<p>Meanwhile the inventors were striving to bring the steam engine to a
profitable efficiency. It had already a long history, from Hero’s steam
- operated doors and toys in the third century a.d. through Jerome
Cardan (1550), Giambattista della Porta (1601), Salomon de Caus (1615),
Gio- vanni Branca (1629), the Marquis of Worcester (1663), Samuel
Morland (1675), Christian Huygens (1680), Denis Papin (1681), and
Thomas</p>
<p>Savery (1698) to Thomas Newcomen’s steam engine of 1712; this is a
tale</p>
<p>4 . Capital and Labor</p>
<p>As machines increased in size and cost, and required mechanical power
for their operation, enterprising men found it profitable to replace
domestic industry with factories that gathered men and machines into
buildings located preferably near streams that could provide both energy
and trans- portation. Factories, as we have seen, were no novelty;
hundreds of them had existed in Elizabeth’s England and Colbert’s
France. The “factory system “ — if we define it as an industrial economy
in which production is carried on chiefly in factories — hardly existed
anywhere before the nine- teenth century. But after the inventions of
Kay and Paul textile factories began to take over more and more of the
spinning and weaving that had been done in homes. In 1717 Thomas Lombe
set up at Derby a textile factory 660 feet long, with three hundred
workers operating 26,000 wheels. Soon other structures of like immensity
rose at Stockport, Leek, Birming- ham, Leominster, Northampton . . .</p>
<p>To buy and house machines, to secure raw materials, to hire labor and
management, to transport and market the product, required capital. The
capitalist — the provider or manager of capital — was also an ancient
phe- nomenon; but as the demand for capital increased, the men who would
take the risk of providing it rose in economic importance and political
power. The guilds, still theoretically governing most European industry,
resisted the capitalistic reorganization of production and distribution.
But the guild sys -</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>tem was predicated on handicrafts rather than machines; it was
equipped to supply local needs rather than a national, much less an
international, market; it could not meet the rising demands of armies,
cities, and colonies; it was hampered by fidelity to traditional methods
and norms; and it was de- teriorating into a coterie of masters
exploiting apprentices and journeymen. The capitalist was better able to
organize quantity production and distant distribution; he had learned
the subtle art of making money breed money; and he was favored by a
Parliament eager for industrial capacity to supply far-ranging commerce
and wars.</p>
<p>As factories and capitalism spread, the relation of the worker to his
work was transformed. He no longer owned the tools of his trade, nor did
he fix the hours and conditions of his toil. He had only a minor share
in determin- ing the rate of his earnings or the quality of his product.
His shop was no longer the vestibule of his home; his industry was no
longer a part of his family life. His work was no longer the proud
fashioning of an article through all its stages; it became, by the
division of labor that would so impress Adam Smith, the impersonal and
tedious repetition of some part of a process whose finished product no
longer expressed his artistry; he ceased to be an artisan, and became a
“hand.” His wages were set by the hunger of men competing for jobs
against women and children. As a miner he re- ceived, on the average,
one shilling sixpence a day; as a building laborer, two shillings; as a
plumber, three shillings; these rates varied little between 1 700 and
1770. 13 A male weaver, toward 1750, was paid six shillings per week; a
woman weaver, five shillings sixpence; a child, two shillings sixpence.
Women spinners received from two to five shillings per week; girls six
to twelve years old earned one shilling to one shilling sixpence. 14
Prices, how- ever, were low, and remained stable till 1760. 15 Sometimes
an allowance was added for bread and beer at work, and most miners
received free coal.</p>
<p>Employers contended that their workmen merited no more, being ad-
dicted to laziness, drink, unreliability, and irreligion. The only way
to make workers temperate and industrious, argued an employer (1739),
was to “lay them under the nec essity of laboring all the time they can
spare from rest and sleep in order to procure the common necessaries of
life.” 16 “The poor,” said a writer in 1714, “have nothing to stir them
up to be serviceable but their wants, which it is prudence to reliev e,
but folly to cure.” 17 Eleven to thirteen hours constituted the normal
working day, six days a week; the long stretch was relieved by an hour
and a half for meals; but those who lingered unduly over their meals
forfeited a quarter of a day’s pay. 18 Em - ployers complained that
their workmen stopped work to attend fairs, prize fights, hangings, or
wakes. To protect themselves against these and other irregularities the
employers liked to have a pool of unemployed workers in the
neighborhood, upon which they could draw in emergency or in times</p>
<p>54 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. II</p>
<p>of quickened demand. 19 When times were slack, workers could be laid
off and left to live on the credit of the local tradesmen.</p>
<p>Slowly a dependent proletariat formed in the towns. An old law of</p>
<p>Edward VI forbade working-class combinations, and this prohibition
was renewed by Parliament in 1720. But the journeymen — i.e., day
laborers — continued to organize, and appealed to Parliament for better
wages; these journeymen’s associations— not the guilds — became the
forerunners of the trade-union movement that took form in England at the
end of the eight- eenth century. In 1756, on an appeal from the textile
workers of Glouces- tershire, the House of Commons ordered the justices
of the peace to main- tain the legal minimum wage, and to prevent wage
cutting in the industry; but a year later this order was withdrawn, and
Parliament adopted the policy of letting the supply and demand of labor
fix wages. 20 The age of “free enterprise” and laissez -faire had
begun.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Transport and Trade</li>
</ol>
<p>The development of the economy depended upon improvements in com-
munication and transport. England had an advantage in her coastline and
rivers; half the population lived within reasonable access to the sea,
and could use it to carry goods; rivers ran far inland, providing
natural water- ways. But the condition of En gland’s roads was a
constant sore in English life. Their soil was soft, their ruts were hard
and deep in winter, many of them were turned into streams by spring or
summer rains, or into sinks of mud so tenacious that carriages had to be
exhumed by supplementary teams of horses or oxen, and foot travelers had
to take to neighboring fields or woods. Only after Bonnie Prince Charlie
had led his rebel Scots as far south as Derby in 1745, because the state
of the highways thwarted the royal forces sent against him, did the
government undertake, for military purposes, to build a system of
turnpikes “proper for the passage of troops, horses, and carriages at
all times of the year” 21 (1751). Robbers, however, still haunted the
roads, and the cost of transport was high.</p>
<p>Those who could afford it traveled on horseback or by private
carriage. On long trips they could hire fresh horses at “posts” (i.e.,
positions) en route; there were such “post houses” all over Western
Europe. The word post came to be applied to the transmission of mail
because at such points the mail carriers could deliver or pick up mail
and change horses; by this system they could cover 120 miles per day.
Even so, Chesterfield complained (1749) that “our letters go, at best,
so irre gularly, and so often miscarry totally.” 22 He thought it
“uncommon diligence” that a letter from Verona reached London in eight
days. Most travel was by stagecoach, drawn by</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>two or four horses with driver and armed guard on the outside, and
six passengers swaying within. Coaches left London on a regular schedule
two or three mornings a week for the major towns of south England; they
averaged seven miles an hour, and took six days between London and New-
castle.</p>
<p>Hampered by roads, internal trade remained picturesquely primitive.
The wholesale merchant usually accompanied the pack horses that carried
his goods from town to town; and peddlers hawked their wares from house
to house. Shops were distinguished from dwellings chiefly by colorful
signs; goods were kept inside, and ordinarily there was no window
display. Al- most every store was a general store; a “haberdasher” sold
clothing, drugs, and ironware; the grocer was so called because he sold
in gross; the “grocer” Henry Coward sold everything from sugar to nails.
Each town had a market day, when, the skies permitting, merchants would
expose samples of their wares. But the great centers of domestic
commerce were the annual fairs held in London, Lynn, Boston,
Gainsborough, Beverley, and, above all, Stourbridge. There, every August
and September, a veritable city took form, with its own administration,
police, and courts; nearly all prod- ucts of English industry could be
found there, and manufacturers from all over the island met to compare
prices, qualities, and woes.</p>
<p>Foreign commerce was expanding, for Britain ruled the waves. Exports
more than doubled in value and quantity in the first half of the
century; tonnage of vessels leaving English ports rose from 317,000 in
1700 to 661,000 in 1751 to 1,405,000 in 17 87. 23 Liverpool doubled its
size and docks every twenty years. Imports came from a hundred lands to
tickle the fancies or stomachs of the rich, or to adorn milady’s
dressing table with captivating toiletries. The East India Company made
such profits by buying cheap in India and selling dear in Europe that it
lured fifteen dukes or earls, twelve countesses, eighty-two knights, and
twenty-six clergymen and phy- sicians into the roster of its
shareholders. 24 The aristocracy did not in Eng- land turn up its nose
at commerce as it did in France, but helped to finance it, and shared in
its prosperity. Middle-class Voltaire was delighted to find English
nobles taking an active interest in trade. “It is only because the
English have taken to trade,” he told France in 1734, “that London has
outgrown Paris both as to size and as to the number of its inhabitants,
and that England can have two hundred men-of-war and subsidize allied
kings.” 25</p>
<p>The great merchants were now rivaling the old landowning aristocracy
in riches and power, determining foreign relations, fomenting and
financing wars for markets, resources, and trade routes. The merchants
who managed the English trade in sugar, tobacco, and slaves controlled
the life of Bristol; the shippers ruled Liverpool, the coal owners
dominated Newcastle. The</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>wealth of the merchant Sir Josiah Child, who held £ 50,000 of stock
in the East India Company, equaled that of many lords; his gardens at
Wanstead were among the famous sights of England. “In most countries of
Europe,” wrote Hume in 1748, “family— i.e., hereditary — riches, marked
with titles and symbols from the sovereign, are the chief source of
distinction. In Eng- land more regard is paid to present opulence.” 26 A
considerable osmosis went on between the upper and middle classes: the
daughters of rich mer- chants married the sons of the landed nobility,
the sons of merchants bought estates from impoverished aristocrats, the
gentry went into trade and law and administration. Aristocracy was
passing into plutocracy; money was replacing birth as a title to
power.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Money</li>
</ol>
<p>European bankers were now providing nearly all financial services.
They received deposits, protected these from fire and theft, arranged
payments between depositors by merely transferring from the account of
one to that of another, and issued bank notes redeemable in gold or
silver on demand. Since not all noteholders were expected to ask for
such redemption at the same time, the banks could issue notes up to five
or ten times the value of their mutual reserves. The circulation of
money, so multiplied, provided additional capital for business
enterprise, and shared in expanding the Eu- ropean economy. Bankers
stimulated industry by lending money on the security of land, buildings,
materials, or simply on trust in a p erson’s respon - sibility. Commerce
was eased with letters of exchange or credit, which en- abled capital to
travel by mere transfer of bank paper, even across hostile
frontiers.</p>
<p>Joint-stock companies were formed in England, as in Holland, Italy,
and France. Promoters — then called “projecters”— organized industrial
or com- mercial associations, issued shares, and promised dividends;
stock or share certificates could be transferred from one person to
another; and for that purpose a stock exchange had been established in
London in 1698. The early eighteenth century saw a brisk development of
speculation in com- pany shares, with “stock jobbers” who manipulated
the rise and fall of mar - ket values. Defoe in 1719 described such a
manipulator:</p>
<p>If Sir Josiah Child had a mind to buy, the first thing he did was
to</p>
<p>commission his brokers to look sour, shake their heads, suggest bad
news from India; . . . and perhaps they would actually sell for ten,</p>
<p>perhaps twenty, thousand pound. Immediately the Exchange . . . was
full of sellers; nobody would buy a shilling, till perhaps the stock
would - fall six, seven, eight, ten per cent, sometimes more. Then the
cunning</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>jobber had another set of them employed … to buy, but with</p>
<p>privacy and caution, till by selling ten thousand pound at four or
five per cent loss, he would buy a hundred thousand pound stock at ten
or twelve per cent under price; and in a few weeks, by just the contrary
method, set them all a-buying, and then sell them their own stock again
at ten or twelve per cent profit. 27</p>
<p>Almost as soon as stock exchanges opened, the eagerness of the public
for unearned increment raised waves of speculation and deflation. The
infla- tion and collapse of the “South Sea Bubble” in England followed
in unusual concord the rise and fall of John Law’s “Mississippi Bubble”
in France. Sen - sitive to complaints by Bolingbroke, Swift, and others
that the national debt — £ 52,000,000 in 1714 — laid upon the state a
ruinous annual charge of £ 3,- 500,000 interest, the government
conceived a plan to transfer £ 3 1 ,000,000 of the debt to the South Sea
Company. This had been formed in 17 1 1 with a grant of monopoly in
English trade with Spanish colonies in America and the Pacific isles.
The holders of government notes were invited to exchange them for stock
in the company. King George I became its governor and every effort was
made to spread the belief that its monopoly charter prom- ised high
profits. The apparent success of Law’s “System” in contemporary - tinued
governmental co-operation, the company directors voted large gifts of
stock to members of the ministry, and to two mistresses of the King. 28
Robert Walpole, not yet minister, warned the House of Commons against
the scheme as “pernicious . . . stockjobbing”; the project, he said, was
“to raise artificially the value of the stock, by exciting and keeping
up a general infatuation, and by promising dividends out of funds which
would not be adequate to the purpose.” He predicted, with remarkable
accuracy, that the project would fail, and that if it were allowed to
involve the general public its failure would entail a general and
dangerous discontent. 29 He argued that at least some limit should be
placed upon the rise of the company’s stock. The House refused to heed
his warning. On April 7, 1720, both houses of Parliament approved the
proposals of the company.</p>
<p>On April 1 2 the company issued new stock at £ 300 a share; this was
sub- scribed for at once. On April 2 1 , flush with the government’s
payment of interest on the government notes now held by the company, it
announced that it would pay a summer dividend of ten per cent. It took
advantage of the enthusiasm aroused by this announcement to float a
further issue of shares at ^400 (April 23); this was taken up in a few
hours. The rush to purchase shares raised their price to £ 550 on May
28, and to £ 890 on June</p>
<p>5 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>2; in July a new issue was sold at £ 1,000 a share. The whole
fashionable world came to subscribe: dukes, clergymen, politicians,
musicians, poets; Exchange Alley became the scene of such excited
competition in buying as could be found only in the Rue Quincampoix in
Paris at almost the same time; the nature of man revealed itself across
frontiers. Shares were bar- gained for in taverns, coffeehouses, and
milliners’ shops; each night men and women calculated how rich they had
become, and how much richer they might be if they had bought sooner or
more.</p>
<p>Public money was so eager for speculation that eighty-six minor
issues were floated. Stock was sold in companies formed to transmute
metals into silver, to erect hospitals for bastard children, to extract
oil from radishes, to create perpetual motion, to import jackasses from
Spain. One promoter an- nounced “a company for carrying on an
undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is” until
later; he received a thousand subscrip - tions of £ 2 each by midday,
and disappeared in the afternoon. 30</p>
<p>The excesse s of these smaller “bubbles” (for so the time called
them) be - gan the reaction against the South Sea enterprise. JValpole
and others re- newed their warnings and sold their shares. On June 1 1
the King outlawed all stock issues except by companies licensed by
Parliament. Most of the lesser ventures soon collapsed, and their
failure cooled the fever of specula- tion. Word spread that the Spanish
government was severely restricting the trade of the company in the
American settlements. In July news came that Law’s “Mississippi Bubble”
had burst in Paris. Sir John Blount and other directors of the South Sea
Company secretly sold their shares at great profit. During all of August
the stock declined, until on September 2 it was quoted at £ 700.</p>
<p>The rush to sell now became a stampede; the approaches to Exchange
Alley were crowded to suffocation. The shares fell to ^570, to X400, to
^150, to £ 135 (September 29). Hundreds of English families lost their
savings in the crash. Stories of ruin and suicide ran the rounds. 31
Banks that had lent money on the security of the South Sea Company share
certificates went into bankruptcy. Public meetings throughout England
demanded the punishment of the directors, but absolved the public of
vanity and greed. The King hurried back from Hanover, and summoned
Parliament. The treasurer of the company fled to France, taking with him
many of the rec- ords that would have incriminated the directors. In
January, 1721, a parlia- mentary committee, examining the books of the
company, found “a scene of iniquity and corruption” 32 startling even in
that age when legislation by corruption of Parliament seemed part of the
constitution of England. Ap- parently the directors had spent £ 574,000
in bribing leaders of the govern- ment.</p>
<p>Some members of Parliament called for drastic penalties; one
proposed</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>that the guilty directors should be sewn in a sack and thrown alive
into the Thames. 33 The debate rose to such warmth that members
challenged one another to duels; one member suffered a hypertension
crisis, and died the next day. Directors and government ministers were
summoned to trial be- fore the House. John Aislabie, chancellor of the
exchequer, was sentenced to the Tower; the estates of the directors —
including Edward Gibbon, grandfather of the historian — were
confiscated, leaving them some ten per cent of their fortunes. It was
noted that Sir John Blount, who had been a prime organizer of the
company, and among the first to sell his shares, was a man “of a most
religious deportment,” who had “constantly declaimed against the
thievery and corruption of the age” and the avarice of the rich. 34</p>
<p>Robert Walpole, whose predictions had been justified by the event,
counseled moderation in the vengefulness of the reaction, and mitigated
the collapse of the company by persuading the Bank of England and the
East India Company to absorb some £ 1 8,000,000 of the troubled stock.
Suffi- cient reserves were found in the South Sea Company to allow an
early pay- ment of thirty-three per cent to its shareholders. Shorn of
its privileges and its glamour, but making money on the sale of slaves,
the company continued to exist, in waning vitality, till 1853.</p>

<li>ASPECTS OF LONDON</li>
</ol>
<p>Venturesome statisticians estimate the population of Europe at some
100 millions in 1650, some 140 millions in 1750. Voltaire in 1750
reckoned the population of France at twenty millions, of Germany and
Austria at</p>
<p>twenty-two, of Great Britain and Ireland at ten, of European Russia
at ten, of Spain and Portugal at eight, of Poland at six, and he
allotted three millions each to European Turkey, Sweden, Denmark (plus
Norway), and the United Provinces. 35 A German jurist thought that the
increase in northern Europe was largely due to the transfer of monks and
nuns from celibacy to parentage by the Protestant Reformation, and urged
that “a statue be erected to Luther as the preserver of t he species”;
38 but we must not exag - gerate the continence of medieval monks. The
increase in population was probably due to improvements in agriculture
and transport augmenting the supply and distribution of food, and
advances in sanitation and medical treatment reducing the death rate in
infants and adults. England and Wales, which may have had no more than
three millions population in 1 500, appear to have had four millions in
1600, six in 1700, nine in 1800. 37 Nearly all the increase went to the
towns, nourishing and nourished by industry and trade. By 1740 London
prided itself on some 725,000 inhabitants; it was now the most populous
city on the globe; Defoe in 1722 condemned it as “overgrown.” 38 Paris
came next with 675,000 in 1750; then A msterdam,</p>

<p>Vienna, Naples, Palermo, Rome. London was ten times more populous
than Bristol, which was the second-largest English city, and eighteen
times more than Norwich, the third-largest. Metropolitan centers were
gathering the controls of the nation’s economic life, and were turning
the labor and prod - ucts of fields and mines and shops into the subtle
profits of finance.</p>
<p>London was well situated to grow with English commerce and colonies.
Oceangoing vessels could sail up the Thames, and though (till 1794) the
docks could not berth them, an army of profane longshoremen, using a
swarm of three hundred lighters, was available to transfer goods from
ship to shore or other ships; so London became an animated entrepot for
the re- export, to the Continent, of imports from overseas. The
riverside was not as tidy as we find it now; it was alive with lusty
longshoremen, sex-starved sailors, and women loose in dress and code,
foul in person and speech, living in hovels and taverns, and rivaling
the seamen in drunkenness and violence. 39 The river itself was
picturesque with a motley of vessels ranging from fish- ing smacks to
massive men-of-war, while little ferries plied the stream. The King, the
Lord Mayor, and some notables maintained elaborate barges, and used them
to go up the river to Windsor or other palaces. Till 1750 London Bridge
remained the only way of crossing on foot from the northern to the
southern side of the city, but in that year Westminster Bridge was com-
pleted, and in 1757 London Bridge was freed from its burden of houses
and stores. Antonio Canaletto, the Venetian painter who visited London
in 1746 and 1751, was impressed by the scenes of vitality on the water,
and left some famous pictures to show us the Thames as Pope and Johnson
knew and loved it.</p>
<p>Johnson probably loved the streets of London even more, though they
were as yet ill-lighted, ill-paved, and cleaned chiefly by the rains. In
1 684 a system of street lighting had been established by setting up a
candle lantern at every tenth house, but they were lit only on moonless
nights, only till midnight, and only from Michaelmas (September 29) to
Lady Day (March</p>
<p>25). In 1736 the city authorities voted to install fifteen thousand
oil lamps throughout London, and to keep them lit from the setting to
the rising of the sun; this was a gala event in the life of the capital,
greatly improving the nocturnal safety of its streets.</p>
<p>Pavements, since the Great Fire of 1666, were mostly of small, round
stones; this remained standard till the nineteenth century. In the
middle of each street ran a gutter that received much refuse and sluiced
off the rain. There were no curbs, but a line of posts railed off a
six-foot pathway for pedestrians. The streets were noisy with carts,
pack horses, hackney coaches, and private carriages, all drawn by horses
with hoofs clattering against the paving stones; there were also
peddlers — many of them women — hawking a hundred kinds of food or
clothing; traveling artisans offering re-</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>6 1</p>
<p>pairs, drivers disputing, dogs barking, beggars soliciting, street
singers bawl- ing ballads, organs bouncing their melodies from wall to
wall. The people complained of but loved these noises, which were the
vital medium of their lives. Only the pickpockets and the prostitutes
worked silently.</p>
<p>Houses began to receive street numbers in 1708. By 1750 most of them
had running water. Sanitation was improving. Every householder was re-
quired by law to keep the street walk clean before his property, and
every ward had a scavenger who organized the collection of waste.
Toilets were usually outhouses placed and screened off in the garden or
yard. Some local- ities had sewers, but London had no general sewage
system till 1865. Chim- neys were cleaned by chimneysweeps who climbed
them by pressing el- bows and knees against the inner walls of brick or
stone; this merciless deformation of children continued till 1817.</p>
<p>A considerable part of the population was packed into slums filthy
with garbage and offal, breeding a hundred diseases. 40 In the Wapping
and Lime- house sections of London nearly every second inhabitant lived
from hand to mouth, depending on charity, theft, or prostitution to
secure lodging and food. Children ran barefoot, unwashed, and unkempt in
the streets, clothed in rags and schooled only in crime. In these slums
men and women seldom bothered to marry; sexual relations were a passing
incident, a commodity marketable without ceremony or law. There were
hardly any churches there, but beer shops and taverns abounded. Here too
were the lairs of thieves, pickpockets, highwaymen, and professional
murderers. Many of the criminals were organized in gangs. Watchmen who
interfered with them had their noses slit. One group, the “Mohocks,” was
wont to sally drunk into the streets, prick passers-by with swords, make
women stand on their heads, and gouge out the eyes of unaccommodating
victims. Less ferocious gangsters contented themselves with breaking the
windows of shops and homes. “Thieves and robbers,” Smollett reported in
1730, “were now be - come more desperate and savage than they had ever
appeared since mankind were civilized.” 41 In 1744 the Lord Mayor and
aldermen of London drew up an address to the King in whic h they stated
that “divers confederacies of great numbers of evil-disposed persons,
armed with bludgeons, pistols, cut- lasses, and other dangerous weapons,
infest not only the private lanes and passages, but likewise the public
streets and places of usual concourse, and commit the most dangerous
outrages upon the persons of your Majesty’s subjects.” 42 Said Horace
Walpole in 1752: “One is forced to travel even at</p>
<p>The great metropolis, of course, was much more than this pullulation
of poverty and crime. It was also the city of Parliament and royal
palaces, of a thousand lawyers, merchants, journalists, poets,
novelists, artists, musicians, educators, clergymen, courtiers. As we
proceed we must add to our vision</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>of eighteenth-century London the mansions, morals, and manners of the
literate classes, the worshipers in the churches, the skeptics,
scientists, and philosophers, the wits and belles and beaux of
“society,” the pleasure gar - dens of Vauxhall and Ranelagh, the
promenaders in the parks and on the Mall, the regattas and festivals and
barges on the Thames, the conversations in coffeehouses and clubs, the
shops of craftsmen, clothiers, jewelers, the amusements of the home and
the sports of the field, the crowds at cock- fights, prize fights,
puppet shows, theaters, and opera: only then will our perspective of
London life be fair and reasonably complete, and allow us to feel
history in all its phases pouring through the bodies and souls of two
generations and 700,000 men.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>SCHOOLS</li>
</ol>
<p>In England, as elsewhere in this period, life began with a high
percentage of infantile mortality: fifty-nine per cent of all children
born in London died before reaching the age of five, sixty-four per cent
before reaching ten. 44 Many babies were exposed at birth; of these the
survivors were put out to nurse at public expense, and then were placed
in workhouses. Carelessness of midwives and mothers resulted in a large
number of physical deformities.</p>
<p>If the parents were poor, the child might receive no schooling
whatever. There were “charity schools,” which offered elementary
education to both sexes and all classes without charge; but their total
enrollment in 1759 was only 28,000, they excluded Dissenters, and they
reached only a small fraction of the peasantry and hardly any of the
urban poor. “The great majority of Engli sh- men,” says an English
authority, “went unlettered to their graves.” 45 In the artisan class
apprenticeship was considered the best education. For the middle- class
child there were private schools, usually kept by “men broken down, bank
- rupt, or t urned out of some other employment.” 46 And there were
“dames’ schools,” where humble schoolmistresses taught the three R’s and
much religion to boys and girls whose parents could pay. In all schools
emphasis was laid upon teaching students to be content with their native
rank, and to show proper subordination to the upper classes.</p>
<p>A small minority graduated into “grammar schools,” where, for a
modest fee that taught the teachers their humble place in the social
scale, the boys could add a little La tin and Greek to their R’s.
Discipline was severe, class hours were long — six to eleven-thirty in
the morning, and one to five-thirty in the afternoon. Much better in
quality were the “public schools”— chiefly Eton, Westminster,
Winchester, Shrewsbury, Harrow, and Rugby — where select youngsters, for
some twenty-six pounds per year, could prepare for university, and lay
up classical tags for future display. As these public schools admitted
only Church of England boys, the Dissenters — Baptists, Presbyterians,
Independents, Unitarians, Quakers, Congregationalists, Methodists —
established academies for their youth.</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Here, as befitted a middle-class clientele, less stress was laid upon
the ancient classics, more upon modern languages, mathematics, history,
geography, and navigation.</p>
<p>Dissenters were excluded from the universities. Most of the students
there were from moneyed families; some poorer lads, however, received
scholarships from philanthropic individuals or institutions, and some
“servitors” or “sizars,” like Newton, worked their way through the
class-conscious halls. Both Oxford and Cambridge suffered stagnation in
this period from conservatism in curricu- lum, methods, and ideas.
Cambridge showed more willingness to enlarge scien- tific studies at the
expense of the classics and theology; yet Chesterfield described
Cambridge as “sunk into the lowest obscurity.” Oxford clung to the old
theology and the fallen Stuart dynasty, and allowed no visit from the
crude Hanoverian kings. Adam Smith, a student at Oxford in 1745, said he
had learned little there; Edward Gibbon, who studied there in 1752,
denounced the dons as ignorant tipplers, and regretted the years he had
wasted in the university. Many families preferred to engage private
tutors. 47</p>
<p>Girls received rudimentary instruction in village and charity schools
— read- ing, writing, sewing, knitting, spinning, little arithmetic,
much religion. Some girls were tutored, and a few, like Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu, studied the classic languages and literatures
surreptitiously. “My sex,” said Lady Mary, “is usually forbid studies of
this nature, and folly is reckoned so much our proper sphere we are
sooner pardoned any excess of that, than the least pretensions to
reading or good sense. . . . There is hardly a creature in the world . .
. more liable to universal ridicule than a learned woman.” She was
inclin ed to suspect that men kept women ignorant in order the more
inexpensively to seduce them. 48 If we may judge from the revenues of
the King’s mistresses, the women managed quite well without the
classics, and needed no Ovid to instruct them in the game of love.</p>

<p>Premarital relations among women were probably less common then than
today (1965), but prostitution flourished to an extent hardly known
again till our time. A foreign observer reckoned them at fifty thousand
in London. They were found at town taverns, roadside inns, city gardens,
public dances, concerts, and theaters; in Exeter Street and the Strand
they sat at windows to encourage hesitant trade. In Drury Lane, sang Gay

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>The law had no mercy on them. If found soliciting, they were taken to
jail, whipped and pilloried. The Grub Street Journal for May 6, 1731,
de- scribed the fate of one “madame”:</p>
<p>Yesterday the noted Mother Needham stood in the pillory in Park</p>
<p>Place near St. James’s Street, and was severely handled by the
populace.</p>
<p>She was so very ill that she lay along the pillory,
notwithstanding</p>
<p>which she was severely pelted, and it is thought she will die in a
day or two. 50</p>
<p>But only the most impoverished prostitutes reached the pillory.
Usually they evaded the law by bribery, or their landlord bailed them
out; and some guardians of the law, perhaps recognizing their former
hostesses, felt a degree of sympathy for women whom the statutes
punished for the promiscuity of men. Probably not ten males in a London
hundred came virginal to the marriage bed. Vice was publicly denounced,
virtue was privately scorned. John Cleland’s Memoirs of a Woman of
Pleasure (1749), later known as Fanny Hill, a concatenation of detailed
seductions, was (and is) one of the most obscene and popular books of
the century.</p>
<p>Some men banded together for mutual satisfaction. The London Journal
for April 23 and 30, 1725, reported the arrest of seven homosexuals; on
May 14 it recorded the hanging of three others for “sodomy.” It added:
“We learn that they 〔the police〕 have discovered twenty houses or
clubs where sodomites meet; moreover, they have an eye on nocturnal
assemblies where these monsters meet in great number.” On July 7 the
Journal noted the conviction of “Robert Whale and York Horner for having
maintained in Westminster houses where they received amateurs of this
detestable vice.” On July 23 it announced that “Marguerite Clapp,
convicted of keep - ing a house of assignation for the use of
sodomites,” had been “condemned to the pillory . . . , to pay a fine of
ninety marks, and to spend two years in prison.” 51</p>
<p>We are told, on good authority, that “a very large proportion of
the</p>
<p>people 〔of London〕 lived in a state of illicit cohabitation without
mar- riage.” 52 Love marriages were rising in number, at least in the
novels of Richardson and Fielding, but most marriages were still
arranged by the parents after careful weighing of the bride’s dowry
against the bridegroom’s actual or prospective income. An act of 1753
prohibited persons under twenty-one from marrying without the consent of
their parents or guard- ians. As this law applied to England alone, many
English elopers crossed the border into Scotland, where the parsons in
the village of Gretna Green fol- lowed an easier rule. Further
conveniences for eager lovers were provided by acquisitive clergymen who
performed clandestine marriages in taverns, brothels, garrets, or other
places in or near the Fleet (a street and the</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>debtors’ prison on it) . Almost every tavern in that neighb orhood
had such a dominie ready, for a fee, to marry anyone without questions
asked or license required. One such parson was reputed to have married
six thousand couples per year. Marriages were entered upon in heat, and
broken in thaw; thou- sands of women were deserted; sailors on shore for
a day married, loved, and decamped. To end the evil Parliament decreed
(1753) that no marriage in England, except between Quakers or Jews,
should be valid unless per- formed by an Anglican priest in a parish
church, after the publication of banns in that church for three
successive Sundays; all violators of this statute were liable to
deportation to the colonies.</p>
<p>Divorce was not allowed in England (before 1857) without a special
act of Parliament, 53 and the cost of such a procedure made it a luxury
of the rich. Adultery flourished in all but the middle classes, with
Georges I and II giving a royal example. “Everybody in this society,”
Congreve had written - ever, the morals of women were higher in England
than in France; and in the middle classes, where the Puritan tradition
was still strong, purity verged on prudery, and women might be such
wives as men dream of — patient, in- dustrious, and faithful. The double
standard was imposed and accepted. Nice women heard much coarse speech
and read Fielding and Smollett, but they were expected to blush allu
ringly, and to faint at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>In all classes woman was looked upon as naturally and irrevocably in-
ferior to man. Even the proud and rebellious Lady Mary conceded this,
though perhaps with her sharp tongue in her cheek:</p>
<p>I am not now arguing for an equality of the sexes. I do not doubt God
and nature have thrown us into an inferior rank; we are a lower part of
the creation, we owe obedience and submission to the superior sex, and
any woman who suffers her vanity and folly to deny this, rebels against
the law of the Creator and indisputable order of nature. 56</p>
<p>The Puritan interlude had brought woman down from her status under
Elizabeth. One student judged that “about 1750, women in England had
reached a new low level hardly in advance of their position in the
twelfth century.” 57</p>
<p>Social, economic, and political morality were at nadir. Gambling,
which had been discouraged by Queen Anne, was restored to royal grace by
Georges I and II. A special officer, the groom porter, controlled
gambling at the court. Cardplaying was the favorite amusement of rich
and poor,</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>seldom without stakes, often with cheating. It was not unusual for
highborn wastrels to win or lose two hundred guineas at one sitting; the
Duke of Devonshire gambled away an estate in one game; and Lord
Chesterfield gambled recklessly between lectures to his son. Under
George I gambling be- came a public passion to a degree probably never
rivaled since. Gambling casinos were opened at White’s Club, at Charing
Cross, in Leicester Fields, in Golden Square, and in Bath. An engraving
in Hogarth’s Rake’s Progress shows men and women gambling at White’s,
and paying no attention to an announcement that the building is on fire;
the game must be fought to a decision.* George II forbade such organized
gambling, but sanctioned the government lottery, which had been
established in 1569 and which survived till 1826. Lottery tickets were
sold to the public by every device of promo- tion; excitement was worked
up to such a pitch that servants robbed their masters, clerks their
employees, to get a stake in the game. 58</p>
<p>Drinking was even more popular than gambling. Beer or ale was the na-
tional drink. The London male consumed a hundred gallons a year, or a
quart per day, as safer and tastier than water. The damp climate created
a demand for rum, punch, brandy, gin, cordials, whiskey; and wine was a
favorite medicine. Taverns and liquor stores were everywhere; out of
7,066 houses in the parish of Holborn 1,350 sold liquor. Landowners —
and there- fore Parliament — smiled on the whiskey trade, since it
opened an added market for their barley and wheat; 59 almost a third of
the arable land of England was planted to barley. In the upper classes
whiskey tended to re- place wine as the repeated wars with France
hindered the commerce with Bordeaux and Oporto, and the Dutch and the
Germans brought in their preference for hard liquor. Here, as in
gambling, the government set the pace: Harley, prime minister under
Anne, was reported to have come drunk into the presence of the Queen;
Bolingbroke sometimes sat up all night drinking; and Robert Walpole had
been taught drunkenness by a father re- solved not to be seen drunk by a
sober son. 60</p>
<p>When the passion for gin spread among the populace the government was
disturbed. The spirits distilled in Britain rose from 527,000 gallons in
1684 to 5,394,000 gallons in 1735, with no comparable rise in
population; on the contrary, physicians warned the government that gin
drinking had rapidly increased the rate of mortality in London; and a
Middlesex grand jury ascribed to that liquor much of the poverty and
crime of the capital. Re- tailers of gin hung out signs promising to
make their customers drunk for a penny, and offering them free beds of
straw in the cellar.</p>
<p>The alarmed rulers tried prohibition by taxation. An act of
Parliament in</p>
<p>The famous club was burned down in 1733, but was soon restored.</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>6 7</p>
<p>1736 laid a duty of twenty shillings a gallon on gin, and required
fifty pounds a year for license to sell it. The thirsting poor rose in
violent riots. As Walpole had predicted, the prohibition led to
smuggling, secret distilling, and clandestine trade. The number of gin
shops rose to seventeen thousand, the distilled gallons to over seven
million, and crime increased. The experi- ment was abandoned, the
license fee was reduced to twenty pounds, the duty to a penny per
gallon; the people rejoiced and drank. In 1751 a series of moderate and
ingenious measures (such as making small debts to liquor dealers
irrecoverable at law) effected a mild improvement. 61 The philoso- pher
Berkeley illuminated the situation by denouncing the upper classes for
the evil example they gave to the masses, and warning them that “a
nation li ghted up at both ends must soon be consumed.” 62</p>
<p>The moral level was low in business too. Great fortunes were derived
from smuggling, piracy, and catching or selling slaves. Complaints arose
that the water of the Thames was defiled by commercial as well as human
waste, that wine was debased with cider and spirits of corn, that bread
was adulterated with alum and chalk, that aging meats had their
complexions freshened with chemicals dangerous to health and life. When
attempts were made to check such practices, the patriots of business
cried out for freedom and the right of “every man … to live in his own
way without re -</p>
<p>straint.” 63</p>
<p>The government interfered with liberty, but chiefy to impress men
into the armed services. When various financial inducements failed to
man the navy, “press gangs” (from 1744 onward) were sent out by the
state to snare, drug, or otherwise persuade men into his Majesty’s
ships. Intoxication was the easiest method, for in that condition a man
could be led to sign away a year or more of his life. From the time they
were so brought on board, said Admiral Vernon (1746), such men were “in
effect con - demned to death, since they are never allowed again to set
foot on shore, but turned over from ship to ship . . . without any
regard for the hard- ships they have undergone.” 64 “No man,” said
Samuel Johnson, “will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get
himself into a jail. . . . The man in a jail has more room, better food,
and commonly better company.” 65 Sailors secured by impressment were
usually weak in body and mind, but the rough discipline and ruthless
selection by ordeal of fire and flogging (as described and doubtless
exaggerated in Smollett’s Roderick Rand om) made the survivors the
toughest and proudest warriors on the sea.</p>
<p>Piracy was still winked at as a form of commerce, but it was in
decline as navies grew stronger. The slave trade flourished; English,
French, Dutch, and Portuguese ships competed for the privilege of
selling African Negroes to American Christians. By the Treaty of Utrecht
(1713) Spain had trans-</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>ferred from France to England the Asiento, the contract to supply the
Spanish colonies annually with 4,800 slaves. Of the 74,000 slaves trans-
ported to America in the one year 1790, the French carried 20,000, the
Dutch 4,000, the Danes 2,000, the Portuguese 10,000, and the British
38,000 —more than half the total. 66 “The English alone, at a low
estimate,” says an English authority, “carried over two million negroes
to America in the period between 1680 and 1786.” 67 Some Negro slaves
were kept for service in English homes. The newspapers contained
promises of rewards for the return of runaway slaves; one advertisement
offered “a negro boy, about twelve years of age, … to be sold.” 68
Slaves were sold at Paris till 1762, and even the popes had Turkish
galley slaves from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. 69 The
Quakers began in 1727 a movement to end the British share in the slave
trade; Steele and Pope supported them; the Method- ists advanced the
crusade; but the campaign for abolition made no substan- tial progress
before 1772.</p>
<p>Political morality reflected the triumph of a hard commercial
spirit.</p>
<p>Hardly anything could be effected without bribery, and nearly every
offi- cial had his price. Offices were sold, and votes in Parliament
were bought like merchandise. M.P.s sold their franking privilege. Noble
lords sold positions in their households, 70 and “obstructed attempts to
check the pur - chase of nominations to Parliament, or of members of the
Commons.” 71 “Rotten boroughs,” with a handful of inhabitants, sent to
Parliament as many representatives as counties abounding in population
and industry; “Old Sarum,” with not a single resident, sent two
delegates; and such boroughs were easily controlled by men of birth or
wealth. Businessmen, seeking political influence commensurate with their
economic power, bought nominations or nominees to Parliament for some £
1,500 each. 72 All in all, this half century was the most corrupt and
merciless in English his- tory; and the historian finds it no simple
matter to explain how, from the venality of that age, Britain has risen
to such high repute for the integrity of its businessmen and its
government.</p>
<p>Amid the debasement of morals and politics there were many touches of
humanitarian sentiment. There were homes, however ill-kept, for the old,
the disabled, and the poor. There were guilds in which masters were
kindly fathers to their apprentices; there were families that sheltered
and educated orphans; there were associations — “box clubs”— for mutual
aid in evil days. There was an impressive example — the first in modern
history — of interna- tional charity when England contributed £ 1 00,000
sterling to her eco- nomic ally, Portugal, for the relief of sufferers
from the Lisbon earthquake of 17 55- 73 Between 1700 and 1825 one
hundred and fifty-four new hospitals and dispensaries were established
in Britain, four in London in one genera-</p>

<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>tion (1700-45). Most of these institutions were financed by private
sub- scription. The best of those set up in the first half of the
eighteenth century was the Foundling Hospital, organized by Captain
Thomas Coram. Ho- garth painted him in 1740 as a gift to the hospital:
rotund, white-haired, kindly, with the royal charter at his right hand,
and a globe at his feet; for Coram had earned his fortune as a captain
in the merchant marine. Retiring, he was shocked by the high infant
mortality in London, and by the number of infants exposed or deserted by
mothers with no funds to care for them or no father’s name to give them.
Coram persuaded highborn ladies to sign a petition for a foundling
hospital; he secured a charter and two thousand pounds from George II;
his appeal for contributions was met with unex- pected generosity; the
great Handel gave an organ and the now precious score of his Messiah,
and directed concerts that raised ten thousand pounds. In 1739 the
trustees commissioned Theodore Jacobsen to design a spacious group of
buildings and grounds, which became one of the proudest sights of
London.</p>
<p>V. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT</p>
<p>The people of eighteenth-century England were a tough breed, accus-
tomed to hardship and violence, and capable of surviving anything except
death. Two corporals fought each other with bare fists till both
expired; two sergeants dueled till both suffered mortal wounds. A
soldier who asked leave to marry an army prostitute was punished with a
hundred lashes; he ap- peared the next day, his back all raw, before the
same officer, and repeated his plea; this time it was granted. A drummer
boasted that he had received 26,000 lashes in his fourteen years with
the army; he received four thousand more in the one year 1727; he
recovered cheerfully, and was soon reported as “hearty and well, and in
no ways concerned.” 74</p>
<p>Brutal punishments, administered in public, encouraged public
brutality. By a law repealed in 1790 a woman convicted of treason, or of
murdering her husband, was to be burned alive, but custom allowed her to
be strangled before burning. 75 Men guilty of treason were cut down from
the gallows while still alive; their bowels were extracted and burned
before their faces; they were then beheaded and quartered. Gallows were
raised in every dis- trict of London, and on many of them the corpses
were left for the nourish- ment of birds. A man might hang for half an
hour before he died. It was usual, however, to dull the senses of the
condemned with brandy; and the hangman, if well disposed, would pull on
the dangling legs to hasten death.</p>
<p>The callousness of spectators and criminals gave hangings the
character of a festival; people lined the road to see the condemned ride
in the carts to</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Tyburn; stalls and peddlers sold gin and gingerbread, nuts and
apples, to the crowd; street singers sang ballads not quite so well as
Captain Macheath in The Beggar’s Opera. The public, never enthusiastic
about laws or police - men, made heroes of criminals who carried off
their exploits successfully, or, when captured, faced trial and death
with scorn or smiles. Jack Shep- pard, “Rob Roy” (i.e., Robert M
acgregor), Dick Turpin, Jonathan Wild, all flourished in this period.
Jack, after almost daily robberies in or near London, was betrayed to
the police by Jonathan Wild; he escaped, was re- arrested, escaped
again, was caught in his cups, and was hanged, aged twenty-two, before a
crowd of thousands that expected him to escape even with the noose
around his neck. Defoe and Ainsworth told his story</p>
<p>profitably, Sir James Thornhill painted his portrait. Turpin
distributed money to mourners to follow his cart in state to the
gallows; but what made him most famous was the fictitious account that
Ainsworth wrote of Dick’s breakneck ride from London to York. Likewise,
Fielding’s Life of Mr. Jon - athan Wild the Great has carried that
scoundrel down the centuries. Most of that powerful satire is fiction,
but it is no more interesting than the facts. Jonathan, like Janus, had
a double face. He organized, managed, and ex- ploited thieves, bought
their stolen goods at his own price, and betrayed them to the
magistrates when his confederates rebelled. At the same time he opened a
pretty office where he received people who had been robbed; he promised,
for a substantial consideration, to get their goods or money re- turned
to them; on the proceeds he maintained several mistresses, and lived in
style for nearly fifteen years. But his prosperity outstripped his
prudence; he was arrested as a dealer in stolen goods; and he was hanged
to the joy of an enormous multitude (1725). He may have been part model
for Mr. Peachum in The Beggar’s Opera.</p>
<p>Lawlessness ran the social scale from the gentle pickpocket to the
smug- gling merchant to the titled duelist. There were hundreds of
duels, some in the open street, some in Hyde Park or Kensington Gardens,
but most of them on the “Field of the Forty Footsteps” behind Montagu
House (now the British Museum) . They were seldom fatal, for pistols
were clumsy, and few men could aim them accurately at thirty paces;
probably many com- batants were careful to fire above the head; in any
case reconciliation was normally achieved after the first drawing of
blood. The duels were illegal, but were humored on the ground that they
encouraged a cautious courtesy of speech. Arrests were rare except for
fatalities; and if the survivor could show that he had followed the
rules of the game he was released after a brief imprisonment.</p>
<p>In 1751 Fielding, then a magistrate, published An Enquiry into the
Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers , etc., with Some Proposals for
Remedying the Growing Evil. He ascribed the increase predominantly not
to poverty</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>7 *</p>
<p>but to the rise of “luxury” among the lower classes; the common
people now had money enough to go to taverns, amusement parks, theaters,
mas- querade dances, and operas; and there they met persons adept in
promiscuity and crime. The second cause, the great novelist thought, was
an increase in the consumption of gin.</p>
<p>Gin is the principal sustenance (if it may be so called) of more
than</p>
<p>an hundred thousand People in this Metropolis. Many of these wretches
swallow Pints of this Poison within the Twenty-four Hours; the</p>
<p>dreadful effects of which I have the misfortune every day to see and
to smell, too. 76</p>
<p>The third cause was gambling. The fourth was the incompetence of the
law; it left the capture of criminals to watchmen</p>
<p>chosen out of poor, old, decrepit people who, . . . armed only
with</p>
<p>a pole, which some of them are scarcely able to lift, are to secure
the persons and houses of his Majesty’s subjects from the attacks of
gangs of young, bold, stout, desperate, and well-armed villains. 77</p>
<p>Even if the watchman was not terrified by the violence of the
robbers, he could be bribed; so could the constable to whom he reported;
so could the magistrate to whom the constable brought a criminal. The
policing of Lon- don was entrusted to 1,000 constables, 474 beadles, 747
watchmen. Between arrest and conviction lay 2,214 lawyers in London,
some of them men of legal learning and reasonable integrity, some of
them not quite so. Dr. John- son said of a man who had just left the
room that he “did not care to speak ill of any man behind his back, but
he believed the gentleman was an attorney.” 78</p>
<p>Fielding did not agree with Coke that “the wisdom of all the wise men
in the world, if they had all met together at one time, could not have
equaled” the excellence of the English constitution. He would have
admitted that that constitution, as Voltaire and Montesquieu had
recently pointed out, had admirably arranged for the protection of the
individual and his property from the tyranny of a king; he would have
praised habeas corpus and trial by jury, and the great law schools in
the Inns of Court. Certainly it was no small matter that an Englishman
was free from arrest without legal war- rant, from imprisonment without
trial, from punishment without conviction by a jury of his peers; that
he could not be taxed except by consent of Parliament; that he could
assemble with his fellows provided he committed no disorder; that he
might say what he pleased, short of sedition, libel, ob- scenity, and
blasphemy. But the lawmakers of England had been so eager to protect the
individual from the state that they had failed to protect so-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>ciety from the individual. The machinery of enforcement was breaking
down before the spread and organization of crime.</p>
<p>The common law was administered by magistrates, or justices of the
peace, whose decisions could be appealed to judges sitting in
Westminster or traveling six months a year to hold assize courts in the
county towns. These judges enjoyed life tenure, and displayed a
reasonable level of in- tegrity. Ecclesiastical courts survived, but
they were limited to trying non- criminal cases involving only the
clergy, or the validity of marriages, or the administration of wills.
The Court of Admiralty had jurisdiction over ex- clusively maritime
cases. Above these courts was the Court of Chancery, presided over by
the lord chancellor. The supreme court of the land was Parliament
itself, with the Commons trying commoners and the Lords try- ing peers.
Equality before the law was still imperfect, for peers usually es- caped
punishment. The fourth Earl of Ferrers was executed in 1760 for killing
his steward, but when the Duchess of Kingston was tried before the House
of Lords in 1776 and was convicted of bigamy, she was freed with only
the payment of fees. Latin remained the language of the courts till
1730, when English displaced it, paining Blackstone grievously.</p>
<p>In trials for capital felony (and most felonies were capital) the
accused was allowed to hire counsel if he could afford one; the counsel
might cross- examine the witnesses for the prosecution, but was not
permitted to address the court; this was left to the prisoner, who,
through weakness of body or mind, was in many cases incapable of
presenting his defense. If he was ac- quitted he was returned to jail
till he had paid all the fees exacted by the keepers for their services;
before this regulation was revoked in 1774 there were several instances
of acquitted men dying in jail. If convicted, the prisoner faced one of
the severest penal codes in the history of law.</p>
<p>The code was an advance on the past, and on Continental procedures,
in barring torture and punishment by the wheel, and it no longer split
noses or cut off ears. Otherwise it had all the barbarity that sturdy
Englishmen then considered necessary to control the natural lawlessness
of mankind. When the penalty was flogging at the tail of a cart drawn
through the streets, the executioner would sometimes receive an extra
sum, collected from the spectators, to ply the thong with special vigor
. 79 A prisoner who refused to plead on a capital charge was required by
law to be laid naked on his back in a dark room, and weights of stone or
iron were placed upon his breast till he was pressed or choked to death
; 80 this law, however, was not enforced after 1 7 2 1 , and was
repealed in 1 7 7 2 .</p>
<p>Throughout the eighteenth century acts of Parliament added to the
num- ber of crimes for which the statutory penalty was death. In 1689
there had been fifty such; by 1820 there were 160. Murder, treason,
counterfeiting, arson, rape, sodomy, piracy, armed smuggling, forgery,
destroying ships or</p>

<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>setting them on fire, bankruptcy with concealment of assets, highway
rob- bery, housebreaking, burglary of over forty shillings, shoplifting
above five shillings, maiming or stealing cattle, shooting at a revenue
officer, cutting down trees in an avenue or a park, setting fire to a
cornfield, sending threat- ening letters, concealing the death of a
husband or a child, taking part in a riot, shooting a rabbit,
demolishing a turnpike gate, escaping from jail, com- mitting sacrilege
— all of these, and a hundred more, were, under the first three Georges,
capital crimes. These laws reflected the resolve of Parliament to
protect property. They may have been in some measure the result — and in
part the cause — of popular lawlessness and brutality, and they may have
helped to form the present law-abiding habits of the British people. The
severity of the code was mitigated by the frequent refusal of judges or
juries to convict, or by quashing the indictment on a technicality, or
by arbitrarily fixing the value of a stolen article at less than the
amount that would make the theft a capital crime. In time of war
offenders might be pardoned on condition of joining the army or
navy.</p>
<p>Lesser crimes were punished by imprisonment, the pillory, whipping,
hard labor in houses of correction, or transportation to the colonies.
By a law of 1718 convicted prisoners were sold to a contractor who
shipped them, at his own expense, generally to Maryland or Virginia, and
sold them, usually at auction, to tobacco planters for the term of their
sentences. The condition of the prisoners en route resulted in a high
percentage of deaths, and such enfeeblement of the remainder as to make
them for a time in- capable of labor. One contractor reckoned that he
lost a seventh of his hu- man cargo on an average voyage. 81 This
traffic was ended only by the American War of Independence.</p>
<p>Such deportation was often preferred to imprisonment, for prisons
were notorious for inhumanity and filth. On his entry the new arrival
was put in irons, heavy or light according to his payment to the warden.
His bed was straw. His food consisted of a pound of bread per day,
unless he could ar- range to supplement it with gifts from outside.
Except in Newgate Prison little attempt was made to keep the prisons
clean. Dirt and germs accumu- lated, infecting almost every prisoner
with “jail fever”— often typhus or smallpox. Johnson thought that
twenty-five per cent of the permanent prisoners died through “putrid
fevers.” The stench of foulness and disease was so strong that when a
prisoner was brought to court the judges, jury, witnesses, and
spectators took frequent sniffs of camphor, vinegar, or aromatic herbs
to offset the smell. In May, 1750, a hundred prisoners from Newgate came
to trial in the “Old Bailey,” the chief criminal court of Lon - don. The
fever they spread was so virulent that of the six judges who tried the
case four died; of the jury and the minor officials, forty died; after
this lesson the court ordered that thereafter all prisoners coming to
trial should</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>be washed with vinegar, and that sweet-smelling herbs should be
placed in the prisoner’s dock. 82</p>
<p>A man sued for debt, judged guilty, and unable or unwilling to pay
was committed to such a jail until he paid, or until his creditor
withdrew the suit. The creditor was bound by law to pay fourpence a day
toward the support of his prisoner; but if he failed to do this the
debtor had no re- course but to sue him — which cost money. If, however,
the prisoner could get funds from outside, he could bribe the warden and
others to let him en- joy better bed and board, wider liberties, the
comfort of his wife, even, now and then, a holiday in the city. A
penniless debtor, if unable to pay for food, might slowly starve on the
bread allowed him. Samuel Johnson calculated that of twenty thousand
bankrupts imprisoned in an average year, five thousand died of privation
within twelve months. 83 England had not found a milder way of
protecting the rising business class from irrespon- sible borrowing or
fraudulent bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Some mild protests were raised against the severity of the penal
code. Johnson, no sentimentalist, pointed out in 1751 the danger in
making so many crimes capital: “To equal robbery with murder is to . . .
incite the commission of a greater crime to prevent the detection of a
less.” 84 The most powerful criticisms of prison administration appeared
in the novels of Fielding and Smollett, and in the drawings of Hogarth.
A modest ameliora- tion was effected by James Oglethorpe, whose varied
and energetic career shows the nobler side of John Bull. In 1714, aged
eighteen, he left college to join the army of Prince Eugene of Savoy,
and served in several actions against the Turks. Returning to England,
he was elected to Parliament. A friend having been imprisoned for debt,
and having died in jail of smallpox contracted there, Oglethorpe
persuaded the Commons to appoint a com- mittee — of which he was made
head — to inquire into the conditions of the London prisons. The filth,
disease, corruption, and oppression revealed by this investigation
shocked for a moment the conscience of England. Some especially culpable
wardens were dismissed, some new regulations mitigated old abuses; but
most of the evils remained, and the actual reform of the prisons had to
wait for John Howard and the final quarter of the eighteenth century.
Oglethorpe turned to emigration as a means of reducing the pres- sure of
poverty in England. In 1733 he founded the colony of Georgia; for a time
he served as its governor; he forbade the importation of slaves, and
welcomed the Moravians, and John Wesley, and Protestant refugees from
Austria. Again in England and Parliament, he secured an act exempting
the English Moravians from taking oaths or bearing arms. He became an
inti- mate friend of Johnson, Goldsmith, and Burke, and lived to the age
of eighty-nine. Pope crowned him with a couplet:</p>

<li>MANNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>The men who promenaded in the parks or on the Mall were still — as in
Elizabethan or Restoration days — the more grandly dressed sex. Except
at work or at home, they wore tilted three-cornered hats, often cocky
with tas- sels, ribbons, or cockades. They bound their tresses with a
pretty bow behind the neck, or covered their heads with a powdered wig.
Their handsome coats, rustling about their knees, sported buttons
designed to dazzle rather than to tie; and sleeves of rich brocade
proclaimed income or class. Their fancy waistcoats sought the eye with
their gaudy tints — yellow, orange, scarlet, pink, or blue — and dangled
a watch fob of gold on a golden chain. Their shirts of fine linen were
faced with frills, hiding flannel underwear. “Stocks” (cravats) of
“lawn” (a fabric imported from Laon in France) - tention with extremes
of adornment or coloration. Another group (“Slov - ens”) made a religion
of careless manners and untidy clothes; they dishev - eled their hair
with rebellious care, left their breeches unbuckled, and flaunted the
mud on their shoes as declarations of independence and em- blems of
original thought.</p>
<p>Women, when on display, dressed as in our wondering youth, when the
female structure was a breathless mystery costly to behold. Their fluffy
skirts were generally inflated with hoops that lifted them lightly from
step to step, and made a giddy revelation of sparkling ankles and
prancing feet. Hoops, sometimes nine yards around, were ramparts, and
stays were shields, so that the conquests of love required all the ardor
of a knight piercing armor and scaling parapets; so much the better for
poetry. The gloss and splendor of a woman’s hair were partly lost in
reinforced elevations so lofty that they had to be guarded against being
ignited by chandeliers. Feminine</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>faces were concealed by lotions, pastes, patches, powders, and
adjustable eyebrows; and all the gems of the Orient were commandeered to
adorn their hair and ears and neck and arms and dress and shoes. From
her tower- ing hat and scented curls to her silken and jeweled footwear
the woman of fashion was dressed to kill any hesitation on the part of
circumjacent males. By 1770 the arts of the toilette had reached such
wizardry that Parliament, in a jovial mood, passed an act designed to
protect the precipitous sex:</p>
<p>That all women, of whatever age, rank, profession, or degree,</p>
<p>whether virgins, maids, or widows, that shall, from and after such
Act, impose upon, seduce, or betray into matrimony any of his Majesty’s
male subjects by the scents, paints, cosmetic washes, artificial teeth,
false hair, Spanish wool, iron stays, hoops, high-heeled shoes,
etc.,</p>
<p>shall incur the penalty of the law now enforced against witchcraft
and like misdemeanours, and that the marriage, upon conviction,
shalkstand null and void. 86</p>
<p>Sumptuary laws struggled to check conspicuous expenditure in dress,
but custom required all loyal Britons to don a new outfit on the
birthday of Queen Caroline, who at her coronation wore a costume costing
£ 2,400,000 — mostly in borrowed gems.</p>
<p>Home was a place where one might discard the laborious accouterments
of display; there one could dress in anything or less. Windows were not
inquisitive, for their number was held down by a law that limited them
to five and taxed any surplus as luxury. Interiors were dark and stuffy,
and not designed for breathing. Lighting was by candles, usually not
more than one at a time per family; the rich, however, brightened their
rooms with gleaming chandeliers and with torches burning oil. In the
mansions of the well-to-do, walls were paneled in oak, staircases were
of massive wood and unshakable balustrades, fireplaces were marbles of
majesty, chairs were padded with hair and upholstered in leather.
Furniture was designed in heavy “Georgian” style, complex with carving
and glaring with gilt. To - ward 1720 mahogany was introduced from the
West Indies; it was too hard for existing tools; sharper tools were
made; and soon the new wood made the most brilliant pieces in English
homes.</p>
<p>Houses were heated by burning coal in stoves or open grates, or wood
in spacious hearths. London air was cloudy with smoke. Domestic
cleanliness was made difficult but imperative by the ever-threatening
dust and soot. The French rated their English enemies as next only to
the Dutch in the grooming of their homes. Said Nicolas de Saussure in
1726:</p>
<p>Not a week passes by but well kept houses are washed twice in the</p>
<p>seven days, and that from top to bottom; and even every morning</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>most kitchens, staircases, and entrances are scrubbed. All furniture,
and especially all kitchen utensils, are kept with the greatest
cleanliness. Even the large hammers and the locks on the doors are
rubbed and</p>
<p>shine brightly. 87</p>
<p>This despite the fact that soap was expensive and water limited.
Bathrooms were a luxury of the few; most men and women bathed by
standing and splashing in a tub.</p>
<p>Commoners spent most of their indoor and waking hours in the kitchen,
courting the big stove; they ate there, chatted there, sometimes slept
there, for the kitchens were immense. Dining rooms were for special
occasions. In all ranks the main meal came after midday: in the middle
classes at two or three o’clock, among the rich at five or si x; then,
as now, the more money you had, the longer you had to wait for dinner.
In fashionable homes the women retired when eating was over, for then
began male drinking, smok- ing, toasts, and tales. Dinners were
substantial, but they were the city Br iton’s first food after breakfast
and a light ii - a.m. “snack.” Frenchmen were astonished at the amount
of food an Englishman consumed at a sitting. Most of the diet in the
upper and middle classes was meat; vegetables were negligible garniture.
Heavy puddings were a favorite dessert. Tea drinking was universal,
though tea cost ten shillings a pound. Supper at 9 p.m. rounded out the
exploits of the day.</p>
<p>Most Englishmen hugged the safety of their homes at night, and amused
themselves with conversation, drinking, quarreling, reading, music,
dancing, chess, draughts (the American “checkers”), billiards, and
cards. “Prithee,” said Marlborough’s Duchess, “don’t talk to me about
books. The only books I know are men and cards.” 88 Bishops and parsons,
eve n the prim Dissenting preachers, played, and philosophers too; Hume
rarely went to bed without having a turn at whist (now “bridge”). In
1742 Edmond Hoyle systema - tized the laws of whist in a Short T
reatise, after which, till 1 864, the game had to be played “according
to Hoyle.” — Animal pets were a household necessity, not only dogs and
cats, but, here and there, a monkey or two. 89 Almost every woman nursed
flowers, and nearly every home had a garden. Blest and harassed with
rain, the English made garden design a national passion. Under Charles
II English gardens followed French models — chiefly Versailles — in
shaping formal gardens on geometrical lines, straight, rec- tangular,
radial, or circular, with “picturesque vistas” and “perspectives” (these
three words had entered the language in the seventeenth century), with
trees, shrubbery, and hedges clipped to line, and classical statuary
symmetrically placed. The amusement gardens at Vauxhall and Ranelagh
were so laid out; we can sample this formal style today at Hampton
Court. Though it accorded well with the neoclassical literature of the
“Augustan</p>
<p>7 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Age,” Addison and Pope, the best exemplars of that age in print,
rebelled against the formal garden, and cried out politely for a
“natural garden” that would leave at least a part of nature’s luxuriance
unclipped and untamed, and would generate delighted surprises by
preserving nature’s incalculable irregularity. Chinese influences
entered into the rebellion; pagodas replaced statues in some gardens; in
his Kew gardens the Duke of Kent built a house for Confucius. The
natural garden reflected the sentimental Thomson and Collins rather than
the chaste Addison and the meticulous, trim and tidy Pope; it joined
with the “poets of feeling” in a “Romantic” treble to a classical bass.
Pope and Thomson agreed in praising the gardens designed on the “Stowe”
estate of Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham. Charles Bridge - man had
begun it on a formal design; William Kent and Lancelot “Capa - bility”
Brown re -formed it in natural style; it became the talk of gardeners in
England and France, and won the acclaim of Jean Jacques Rousseau.</p>
<p>Beyond the gardens lay the streams where oarsmen rowed and lazy
anglers dreamed of snaring fish; and the woods where men shot pheasants,
grouse, partridge, or wild fowl, or where scarlet huntsmen followed
their dogs to the cornered fox or the exhausted hare. Less moneyed
Britons amused themselves with cricket, tennis, fives (“handball”),
bowling, horse racing, cockfighting, bear baiting, bull baiting, and
boxing matches — be- tween women as well as between men. Prize fighters
like Figg and Piper were the idols of every class, drawing immense
crowds to the ringside. Till 1743 prize fighters fought with bare fists;
boxing gloves were then intro- duced, but many years passed before these
were accepted by the spectators as anything but an effeminate device
unworthy of John Bull. Among the entertainments advertised in London in
1729- 30 were “a mad bull to be dressed up with fireworks and turned
loose” in a ring, “a dog to be dressed up with fireworks over him, a
bear to be let loose at the same time, and a cat to be tied to the
bull’s tail.” 80 In the game called “cock throwing” a cock was tied to a
stake, and sticks were thrown at it from a distance till it died. The
most popular cockfights were those in which as many as sixteen cocks
were matched against another sixteen till all on one side were killed;
then the victors were divided into opposing camps, and fought till all
on one side were killed; and so on till all but one were dead. Counties,
towns, and vil- lages pitted their cocks against one another with a
noble patriotism, and an amiable writer hailed these sports as a moral
equivalent for war. 91 Nearly all sports were accompanied by
betting.</p>
<p>Those whose stomachs were not attuned to these spectacles could seek
milder amusement at Vauxhall or Ranelagh, in whose shaded gardens they
might, for a shilling, feel the comfort and security of crowds, if they
kept their pockets guarded; there they could dance and masquerade, or
sit under lanterned boughs, sip tea, and watch fashionable ladies and
gallants, and the</p>

<p>passing stars of the stage; they could gaze at fireworks or acrobats,
hear popular music, dine in state, or seek adventure in lovers’ lanes
gratefully obscure. At Ranelagh, under the great Rotunda, they could
lift themselves up to loftier music amid people of genteeler class.
“Every night,” wrote</p>
<p>Aside from some bluestockings, manners were rough and blasphemous.
Hogarth will show us the life of the commonalty, but not their speech.
Har- lots and rakes, draymen and bargemen, soldiers and sailors, were
masters of damnation and ribaldry, and the fishmongers at Billingsgate
made their market immortal with their incomparable profanity. In the
inns and taverns speech was less vivid but still coarsely free. Even in
their homes the men alarmed the women with their stories, expletives,
and toasts, and the ladies themselves were not above a hearty curse and
a gay obscenity.</p>
<p>In the coffeehouses and clubs language took on more refinement.
Steele, Swift, Fielding, Cowper, and Johnson wrote on conversation as a
polite art. We picture the men in their jealously male gatherings,
sampling their coffee or beer, gulping their liquor, smoking their
pipes, arguing about arguments in Parliament, about Robert Walpole’s
vote buying, an d the unseemly poli- tics of those “French dogs” across
the Channel. Laughter was deep in the belly and loud in the throat,
despite the pleas of moralists like Shaftesbury and amoralists like
Chesterfield that laughter should be left to the lowly and should simmer
down to a smile. 94 Snuff-taking, first mentioned in 1589, had become a
careful ritual in both sexes; like coffee, snuff (powdered tobacco) was
supposed to have medicinal value: the sneezing it caused would clear the
nasal passages, cure headache, colds, deafness, and sleepiness, soothe
the nerves, and improve the brain. No man or woman of style was fully
dressed without a snuffbox; and on that appendage the goldsmith, the
jeweler, the enameler, and the miniaturist exercised their most delicate
craft.</p>
<p>The three thousand coffeehouses in London were centers of reading as
well as of talk. They took in newspapers and magazines, and circulated
these among their customers; they provided pens, paper, and ink,
accepted letters for mailing, and served as mailing addresses. Some
coffee or choco- late houses, like White’s, evolved in this period into
exclusive clubs, where</p>
<p>8o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>gamble in privacy. By the end of the eighteenth century there were as
many clubs as there had been coffeehouses at the beginning. Apparently
the Free- masons began their English history as a club — the “Grand
Lodge”— organ- ized in London in 1717. The clubs encouraged drinking,
gambling, and po- litical intrigue, but they taught men at least half
the art of conversation. The other half was missing, for the clubs were
baccalaureate retreats; the finer courtesy and subtler wit required by
the presence of women received no stimulus there. England was a man’s
land; women had little share in its cul - tural life; there were no
salons; and when Lady Mary Montagu tried to establish one she was looked
upon as an eccentric who did not know her place. 95</p>
<p>In the upper classes women could ply their arts at receptions,
dances, and musicales at the court or in their homes. The weekend in
country houses was a gracious feature of English life, tarnished a bit
by the high gratuities expected by the servants; the parting guest had
to run the gantlet of valets, buders, footmen, stewards, porters, maids,
cooks, and other help standing in a double row at the door, while
coachman and groom waited sternly out- side. The reputed fidelity of
British servants to their masters had scant reality in the first half of
the eighteenth century; they were in many cases inattentive, insolent,
rebellious, and changed domiciles readily for a better wage. Many of
them robbed master, mistress, and guests when they could; they drank
their master’s wine, and donned their mistress’ finery.</p>
<p>Next to acceptance at court, the crown of fashion was a stay at some
watering place, to drink medicinal waters, or bathe with select bodies
rather than in the promiscuous sea. Tunbridge was famous for its wells,
but its clientele was indiscriminate. Epsom Wells offered music, morris
dances, performing dogs, and purgative water, though its minerals had
not yet been gathered into Epsom salts. Sea bathing was not popular,
though Chesterfield noted some at Scarborough; but in 1753 Dr. Richard
Russell’s book Of Glandular Consumption, and the Use of Sea-Water in
Diseases of the Glands sent a human wave to the shore, and coastal
villages like Brighton, which had known only the humble families of
fishermen, blossomed into bathing resorts.</p>
<p>The aristocracy preferred Bath. There, among the most distinguished
of Britain’s valetudinarians, one might drink— and bathe in — smelly
waters touted to cure the ailments of the too-well-fed. The little spa
had opened its first pump room in 1704, its first theater in 1707, and a
year later the first of the “assembly rooms” celebrated in Fielding and
Smollett. In 1755 the great Roman bath was discovered. John Wood and his
son, as we shall see, remade the town in classical style. In 1705 “Beau”
Nash, a lawyer and gamester, became the dictator of its social life. He
forbade swords in places of public amusement, and succeeded in making
duels — in Bath — disreputable.</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>He persuaded men to wear shoes instead of boots. He himself wore an
im- mense white hat, and a coat with rich embroidery; he drove in a
coach be- hind six horses that had to be gray; and he announced his
coming with gay French horns. He improved the streets and buildings,
laid out handsome gardens, provided music, and charmed all but a few
with his geniality and wit. The English nobility flocked to his realm,
for he gave them gaming tables as well as baths, and when laws were
passed against gambling he in- vented new games of chance that bypassed
the laws. Finally George II came, and Queen Caroline, and Prince
Frederick Louis, and Bath was for a time a second court. The Earl of
Chesterfield, who loved the town, would doubtless have applied to its
elite the description that he gave of all courts, as places where “you
must e xpect to meet with connections without friend- ship, enmities
without hatred, honor without virtue, appearances saved and realities
sacrificed; good manners with bad morals; and all vice and virtues so
disguised that whoever has only reasoned upon both would know neither
when he first met them at court.” 86</p>

<li>CHESTERFIELD</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us spend half an hour with this perceptive ^arl. He typified the
Eng- lish aristocracy of the age, except that he wrote a good book. His
Letters to His Son, which it has been the fashion to depreciate, is a
treasury of wisdom in sterling prose, a compact guide to the manners and
ideals of his class, and an engaging revelation of a subtle and gracious
intelligence.</p>
<p>At baptism (1694) he was Philip Dormer Stanhope, son of Philip Stan-
hope, third Earl of Chesterfield, and of Lady Elizabeth Savile, daughter
of George Savile, Marquess of Halifax, the wily “Trimmer” of preceding
reigns. His mother died in his childhood; his father neglected him; he
was brought up by the Marchioness of Halifax. Under a private tutor he
learned the classics and French uncommonly well, so that the culture of
Rome and France in their maturity became part of his mind. He had a year
at Cam- bridge, and set out in 1714 on the grand tour. At The Hague he
gambled for heavy stakes; in Paris he sampled women with discriminating
promis- cuity. From Paris he wrote (December 7, 1714):</p>
<p>I shall not give you my opinion of the French, because I am very</p>
<p>often taken for one of them; and several have paid me the highest</p>
<p>possible compliment they think it in their power to bestow, which</p>
<p>is: “Sir, you are just like ourselves.” I shall only tell you that I
am</p>
<p>insolent, I talk a great deal, I am very loud and peremptory, I sing
and dance as I walk along; and, above all, I spend an immense sum on
hair, powder, feathers, and white gloves. 97</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>On his return to England he was appointed gentleman of the bedchamber
to the current Prince of Wales (later George II). George I’s favorite
minis - ter, James Stanhope, was Philip’s relative. A borough was found
for him to represent, and for eleven years he sat in Commons as a Whig.
Becoming fourth Earl of Chesterfield on the death of his father (1726),
he was trans- ferred to the House of Lords, which he later called “the
House of Incur - ables.” Sent to The Hague as ambassador (1728), he
managed his mission so well that he was rewarded with a knightly Garter
and appointment as lord high steward. In 1732 a mistress, Mile, du
Bouchet, presented him with a son, Philip Stanhope, future recipient of
the Letters. A year later he married the Countess of Walsingham, natural
daughter of George I by the Duchess of Kendal. He may have expected her
to bring him a royal dowry; she did not, and the marriage proved
genteelly miserable.</p>
<p>He might have risen to higher place had he not opposed Walpole’s bill
for an excise tax on tobacco and wine. He helped to defeat the measure,
and was soon dismissed from the government (1733). He labored for Wal-
pole’s fall, lost his health, retired to the Continent (1741), visited
Voltaire in Brussels, associated with Fontenelle and Montesquieu in
Paris. Back in Eng- land, he continued in opposition. The articles that
he contributed as “Jeffrey Broadbottom” to a new journal, Old England,
so pleased Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, that she willed him twenty
thousand pounds. In 1744 his “Broad Bottom” party won. He joined Pelham
in the ministry, and was sent to The Hague to persuade the Dutch to join
England in the War of the Austrian Succession. He accomplished this with
tact and skill, and was advanced to the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland
(1745). His one year in Ireland was the most successful in his career.
He established schools and industries, cleansed the government of
corruption and jobbery, administered affairs with competence and
impartiality. He ended the persecution of Catholics, promoted several of
them to office, and so earned the respect of the Catholic population
that when the Young Pretender invaded England from Scotland, and England
expected a simultaneous revolt in Ireland, the Irish refused to rise
against Chesterfield.</p>
<p>He was brought back to London as secretary of state (1746). But now
the master of delicacy and tact made a ruinous mistake: he paid court to
the King’s mistress rather than to the Queen, and Caroline succeeded in
maneu - vering his fall. In 1748 he abandoned public life, and retired
to “my horse, my books, and my friends.” 98 He was offered a dukedom by
George II; he declined it. In 1751 he led the movement to adopt the
Gregorian calendar, and bore the brunt of popular resentment against the
“Popish theft” of eleven days from the English people. In 1755 he fell
under Johnson’s blun - derbuss over the dedication to the Dictionary; we
shall look at that fracas later on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, since 1737, he had been writing letters to his son. His
love for this by-product of his first embassy to Holland betrays the
tenderness that he kept hidden from the public through most of his
career. “From the time that you have had life,” he told the youth, “it
has been the principal and favorite object of mine to make you as
perfect as the imperfections of human nature will allow.” 99 He planned
Philip’s education not to make him a model Christian, but to prepare him
for statesmanship and diplomacy. He began when the boy was five, with
letters on classical mythology and his- tory. Two years later he struck
the note that was to recur so persistently in the correspondence:</p>
<p>In my last I wrote concerning the politeness of people of
fashion,</p>
<p>such as are used to courts, the elegant part of mankind. Their
polite- ness is easy and natural, and you must distinguish it from the
civilities of inferior people and rustics, which are always constraining
or trouble- some. … A well-bred man shows a constant desire of pleasing,
and</p>
<p>takes care that his attentions be not troublesome. Few English
are</p>
<p>thoroughly polite; either they are shamefaced or impudent; whereas
most French people are easy and polite in their manners. And as by</p>
<p>the better half you are a little Frenchman, so I hope you will at
least be half polite. You will be more distinguished in a country
where</p>
<p>politeness is not very common. 100</p>
<p>So, when Philip was fourteen, his father sent him to Paris as the
finishing school of manners, though quite aware that Paris would finish
his morals too. The young man had to learn the ways of the world if he
was to be useful to his government. The proper study of a statesman is
man. After schooling Philip through tutors and letters in classic and
literary lore, the Earl, who had such lore at his fingers’ ends, steered
him back from books to men. My Dear Friend: Very few celebrated
negotiators have been emi-</p>
<p>nent for their learning. . . . The late Duke of Marlborough, who
was</p>
<p>at least as able a negotiator as a general, was exceedingly ignorant
of books but extremely knowing in men, whereas the learned Grotius</p>
<p>appeared, both in Sweden and in France, to be a very bungling min-
ister. 101</p>
<p>If Philip proposed to enter government, he should, above all, study
the gov- erning classes, their background, morals, manners, aims, and
means. He should read only the best literature, in order to acquire a
good style of writ- ing, for this too is part of the art of rule; and he
should be acquainted with music and the arts; but God forbid that he
should aspire to be an author or a musician. 102 He should study
carefully the modern history of the European states, their kings and
ministers, their laws and constitutions, their finances</p>
<p>8 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>and diplomacy. He should read La Rochefoucauld and La Bruyere on the
nature of man; they are cynical, but there would be no great mistake, at
least in politics, in expecting every man to pursue his own interest as
he sees it; let us suspect any politician who pretends anything else.
Don’t expect men to be reasonable; allow for their prejudices. “Our
prejudices are our mistresses; reason is at best our wife, very often
heard indeed, but seldom minded .” 103 Learn to flatter, for only the
greatest sages and saints are im - mune to flattery; but the higher you
go, the more delicate and indirect your flattery must be. Study the
genealogy of the most important families, for men are prouder of their
pedigrees than of their virtues . 104 Make your court to women, chiefly
to get their help; for even powerful statesmen are influenced by weak
women, especially if these are not their wives.</p>
<p>In matters of sex Chesterfield’s advice to his son amused the French
and horrified the English. He thought a fewJiaisons were an excellent
prepara- tion for marriage and maturity. He merely insisted that
Philip’s mis tresses should be women of good manners, so that they might
refine him while</p>
<p>sinning. He recommended Mme. du Pin because of her “good breeding and
delicacy .” 105 He instructed his son in the strategy of seduction. No
refusal should be supinely accepted, for</p>
<p>the most virtuous woman, far from being offended at a declaration of
love, is flattered by it, if it is made in a polite and agreeable
manner.</p>
<p>… If she listens, and allows you to repeat your declaration, be</p>
<p>persuaded that if you do not dare all the rest, she will laugh at
you.</p>
<p>… If you are not listened to the first time, try a second, a third,
and</p>
<p>a fourth. If the place is not already taken, depend upon it, it may
be conquered . 106</p>
<p>The Earl, having had no luck or taste in marriage, passed on to his
son no very high opinion about women:</p>
<p>I will, upon this subject, let you into certain Arcana that will
be</p>
<p>very useful to you to know, but which you must, with the utmost care,
conceal and never seem to know. Women, then, are only children of a
larger growth; they have an entertaining tattle, and sometimes wit; but
for solid reasoning, good sense, I never knew in my life one that had,
or who reasoned or acted consequentially for four-and-twenty hours
together. … A man of sense only trifles with them, plays</p>
<p>with them, humors and flatters them, . . . but he neither consults
them about, nor trusts them with, serious matters, though he often makes
them believe that he does both; which is the thing in the world that
they are most proud of; for they love mightily to be dabbling in</p>
<p>business (which, by the way, they always spoil). . . . No
flattery</p>
<p>is either too high or too low for them. They will greedily
swallow</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>the highest, and gratefully accept the lowest; and you may safely</p>
<p>flatter any woman from her understanding down to the exquisite taste
of her fan. Women who are indisputably beautiful, or indisputably</p>
<p>ugly, are best flattered on the score of their understanding .
107</p>
<p>In France, said the Earl, it is necessary to flatter women with both
as- siduity and tact, for two reasons: they can make or break a man at
court, and they can teach him the graces of life. It is by their grace
of movement, manners, and speech, rather than by their beauty, that
women maintain their lure; beauty without grace becomes invisible, but
grace without beauty can still charm. “Women are the only refiners of
the merit of men; it is true, they cannot add weight, but they polish
and give luster to it .” 108 The Earl cautioned his son against speaking
ill of women; that would be trite, vulgar, foolish, and unfair; for
women have done much less harm in this world than men. Besi des, it is
never wise to attack “whole bodies,” classes, or groups; “individuals
forgive, sometimes; but bodies and societies never do .” 109</p>
<p>Chesterfield never tired of inculcating good manners.</p>
<p>Good manners are the settled medium of social, as specie is of com-
mercial, life; returns are equally expected for both; and people
will</p>
<p>no more advance their civility to a bear than their money to a bank-
rupt . 110</p>
<p>Here a good dancing master is helpful; he will at least teach us how
to sit, stand, or walk with an economy of attention and energy. Being an
aristo- crat, the Earl called good manners “good breeding”;
unconsciously, and perhaps rightly, he recognized how difficult it is to
acquire good manners without being brought up in a family, and moving in
a circle, that already has them. A “characteristic of a well -bred man
is to converse with his in- feriors without insolence, and with his
superiors with respect and ease .” 111 One must not take advantage of
the accident of superiority.</p>
<p>You cannot, and I am sure you do not, think yourself superior by</p>
<p>nature to the Savoyard who cleans your room, or the footman who</p>
<p>cleans your shoes; but you may rejoice, and with reason, at the
dif-</p>
<p>ference that fortune has made in your favor. Enjoy those advantages,
but without insulting those who are unfortunate enough to want</p>
<p>them, or even doing anything unnecessarily that may remind them of
that want. For my own part, I am more upon my guard as to my</p>
<p>behavior to my servants, and others who are called my inferiors, than
I am towards my equals: for fear of being suspected of that mean and
ungenerous sentiment of desiring to make others feel that difference
which fortune has, and perhaps too undeservedly, made between us .
112</p>
<p>86 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. II</p>
<p>Good manners are of the mind as well of the body, and both kinds will
be influenced by the company we keep.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of good company: one, which is called the</p>
<p>beau monde , and consists of the people who have the lead in courts,
and in the gay parts of life; the other consists of those who are
distin- guished by some peculiar merit, or excel in some particular and
valuable art or science. For my own part, I used to think myself in
company as much above me when I was with Mr. Addison or Mr. Pope, as if
I had been with all the princes in Europe. 113</p>
<p>In either of these good companies it is advisable to keep a certain
reserve: not to speak too much or too candidly; to be “dexterous enough
to conceal a truth without telling a lie,” and to appear frank while
being reserved.</p>
<p>Even where you are sure, seem rather doubtful; . . . and if you</p>
<p>would convince others, seem open to conviction yourself. … Wear</p>
<p>your learning, like your watch, in a private pocket, and do not pull
it out . . . merely to show. 114 . . . Above all things, avoid speaking
of</p>
<p>yourself, if it be possible. 115</p>
<p>Say nothing about religion; if you praise .it, sophisticates will
smile; if you condemn it the mature will mourn. You will profit by
reading Voltaire’s histories, but you will be on your guard against the
philosophes who at- tack religion.</p>
<p>You should by no means seem to approve, encourage, or applaud</p>
<p>those libertine notions which strike at religions equally, and
which</p>
<p>are the poor threadbare topics of half-wits and minute
philosophers.</p>
<p>Even those who are silly enough to laugh at their jokes are still
wise enough to distrust and detest their characters; for, putting moral
virtues at their highest, and religion at the lowest, religion must
still be allowed to be a collateral security, at least, to virtue, and
every prudent man will sooner trust to two securities than to one.
Whenever, therefore, you happen to be in company with these pretended
esprits forts , or with thoughtless libertines who laugh at all religion
to show their wit,</p>
<p>… let no word or look of yours intimate the least approbation; on</p>
<p>the contrary, let a silent gravity express your dislike; but enter
not the subject, and decline such unprofitable and indecent
controversies. 116</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In 1752 Chesterfield recognized in the attack upon religion the first
stages of a social j revolution. “I foresee that before the end of this
century the trade of bojth king an d priest will not be half so good a
one as it has been.” 117 And in 1753, two years after the appearance of
the anticlerical Encyclo- pedic, he wrote to his son:</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>The affairs of France . . . grow serious, and in my opinion will</p>
<p>grow more and more so every day. The King is despised. . . . The</p>
<p>French nation reasons freely, which they never did before, upon mat-
ters of religion and government, and begin to be spregiudicati 〔unprej-
udiced〕 ; the officers do too; in short, all the symptoms, which I have
ever met with in history previous to great changes and revolutions</p>
<p>in government, now exist, and daily increase, in France . 118</p>
<p>A delighted study of Chesterfield’s eight hundred pages has given two
readers a high opinion of his mind, if not of his morals. His English
con- temporaries, not having read his letters, tended too readily to
classify him as a wit rather than a philosopher. They relished his
remark, in the upper house, that “we, my lords, may thank Heaven that we
have something bet- ter than our brains to depend upon .” 119 They saw
him gamble like any rake or fool, and they knew (what he confessed to
his son) that he had not been a model of chastity. The irate Johnson
described the Letters as inculcating “the morals of a whore and the
manners of a dancing master .” 120 This, like so many of the Great
Cham’s decrees, was somewhat one -sided; Chester- field was teaching the
youth the morals of his time and class, and the man- ners of the polite
political world; we must bear in mind that he was groom- ing his son for
diplomacy; and no diplomat dares to practice Christianity across
frontiers.</p>
<p>Even so, much of the moral doctrine offered to Philip was excellent.
“I - ably an attempt to steer the boy away from promiscuity; note the
warning: “As to running after women, the consequences of that vice are
only the loss of one’s nose, the total destruction of health, and, not
infrequently, the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>page of which can be read without our having to remember some happy
observation.” 125</p>
<p>If we judge a work by its immediate fruits, the Letters failed.
Young</p>
<p>Philip Stanhope never overcame his sluggish spirit, his careless
habits, his awkward manner, his hesitating speech; after all those
exhortations, he had, reported Fanny Burney, “as little good breeding as
any man I met with.” 126 Apparently some quirk of birth or circumstance
nullified five pounds of precept. Philip suffered the handicap of having
a rich parent and an assured and comfortable place; neither the fear of
hunger nor the resentment of subordination stirred him to ambition or
enterprise; as the frustrated father told him, he lacked “that vivida
vis animi that living force of soul, “which spurs and excites young men
to please, to shine, to excel.” 127 It is touching to</p>
<p>He himself, at that time, was frequently at Bath, incapacitated with
gout and sadly deaf. “I crawl about this place upon my three legs, but
am kept in countenance by my fellow crawlers; the last part of the
Sphinx’s riddle ap - proaches, and I shall soon end, as I began, on all
fours.” 131 He interested him - self in the education of his
grandchildren; hope springs eternal in the aging breast. Returning to
his estate at Blackheath, he took Voltaire’s advice and cultivated his
garden, proud of his melons and apples; he was content, he said, to
“vegetate in company with them.” 132 Voltaire wrote him consola - tory
letters, reminding him that a good digestion (which the Earl retained)
was more conducive to pleasure than good ears. He faced the end with un-
failing humor. Of himself and his friend Lord Tyrawley, also old and in-
firm, he said (perhaps recalling Fontenelle), “Tyrawley and I have been
dead these two years, but we do not wish it to be known.” 133 He died
March 24, 1 77 3, aged seventy-nine, unaware that his letters, whose
publication he had forbidden, had been preserved and bequeathed by his
son, and would, when printed in the following year, place him at once
among the masters of worldly wisdom and English prose.</p>
