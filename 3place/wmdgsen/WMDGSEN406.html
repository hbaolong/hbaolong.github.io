<p>Sunset in Venice</p>
<p>1 53 4 - 7 6</p>
<p>I. VENICE REBORN</p>
<p>I T is something of a mystery that this age of thralldom and decline
for the rest of Italy was for Venice a golden age. She had suffered
severely</p>
<p>from the wars of the League of Cambrai; she had lost many of her
Eastern possessions to the Turks; her trade with the Eastern
Mediterranean was repeatedly disturbed with war and piracy; her commerce
with India was passing to Portugal. Why, then, could she support in this
period architects</p>
<p>like Sansovino and Palladio, writers like Aretino, painters like
Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese? In this same age Andrea Gabrieli
played the organ and led the choirs at San Marco, and wrote madrigals
that sounded through Italy; music was a pampered passion of rich and
poor; the palaces on the Grand Canal were rivaled in interior luxury and
art only by those of bankers and cardinals in Rome; a hundred poets
recited their verses in booths and taverns and public squares; a dozen
companies of players per- formed comedies, permanent theaters were
built, and Vittoria Piissimi, la bella maga d’amore, “the lovely
sorceress of love,” was the toast of the city as an actress, singer, and
dancer as women replaced boys in female parts, and the reign of divas
began.</p>
<p>Only the lamest explanation of the mystery will be given here. Though
deeply injured by war, Venice had never been invaded; her homes and
shops remained intact. She had recovered her mainland possessions, and
included populous cities like Padua, Vicenza, and Verona among her
tribu- taries in education, economy, and genius (Colombo and Cornaro at
Padua, Palladio at Vicenza, Veronese from Verona). She still dominated
large areas of trade in and near the Adriatic. Her leading families had
still un- spent treasures of nursed and inherited wealth. Old industries
continued to flourish, and found new markets in Christendom; it was now,
for example, that Venetian glass reached its tenuous crystalline
perfection. The Vene- tian leadership in luxury products was maintained,
and in this age Venetian lace first acquired fame. Despite religious
censorship, Venice still gave</p>
<p>649</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>650</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>asylum to political, refugees, and to intellectual refugees like
Aretino, who fumigated his hilarious ribaldries with periodical
contributions to the litera- ture of piety.</p>
<p>Toward the end of this period Venice twice demonstrated her civic
vigor and resilience. In 1571 she took a leading part, with Spain and
the papacy, in equipping the armada of two hundred vessels that
destroyed a Turkish fleet of 224 ships off Lepanto in the Gulf of
Corinth. That victory, which may have saved western Europe for
Christendom, was celebrated by Venice with three days of mad rejoicing:
the region of the Rialto was hung with cloths of turquoise or gold;
every window made the canals colorful with flags or tapestries; a great
triumphal arch rose at the Rialto bridge; and paintings by the Bellini,
Giorgione, Titian, and Michelangelo were dis- played in the streets. The
subsequent carnival was the wildest that Venice had ever known, setting
the pace for many later carnivals; everyone masked and frolicked, laying
a moratorium upon morality; and clowns like Panta- lone and Zanni (i.e.,
Johnny) gave their names to a dozen languages.</p>
<p>And then, in 1574 and 1577, tragic fires in the Ducal Palace gutted
sev- eral rooms; paintings by Gentile da Fabriano, the Bellini, the
Vivarini, Titian, Pordenone, Tintoretto, and Veronese were destroyed; in
two days the labor and art of a century disappeared. The spirit of the
republic shone out in the rapidity and resolution with which the damaged
interiors were restored. Giovanni da Ponte was commissioned to rebuild
the chambers on their former lines; Cristoforo Sorte designed in
twenty-nine divisions the marvelous ceiling of the Sala del Maggior
Consiglio; and the walls were painted by Tintoretto, Veronese, Palma
Giovane, and Francesco Bassano. In other rooms — the Collegio or meeting
place of the Doge and his council, the Anticollegio or antechamber, the
Sala de’ Pregadi or Senate Hall - ceilings and doors and windows were
designed by the greatest architects of the age — Iacopo Sansovino,
Palladio, Antonio Scarpagnino, Alessandro Vit- toria.</p>
<p>Iacopo d’Antonio di Iacopo Tatti was by birth (i486) a Florentine. He
“went very reluctantly to school,” says Vasari, but took eagerly to
draw- ing. His mother encouraged this disposition; his father, who had
hoped to make a merchant of him, was overruled. So Iacopo went to serve
as ap- prentice to the sculptor Andrea Contucci di Monte San Savino, who
loved the lad so well, and taught him so conscientiously, that Iacopo
came to look upon him as a father, and adopted Andrea’s cognomen,
Sansovino, as his own. The youth had also the good fortune to make a
friend of Andrea del Sarto, and perhaps learned from him the secrets of
graceful and ani-</p>

<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>651</p>
<p>mated design. While in Florence the young sculptor carved the Bacchus
now in the Bargello, famous for its perfect balance, and for the skill
with which arm, hand, and vase — lightly poised on the finger tips —
were cut from one piece of marble. Everyone (except Michelangelo) was
kind to Andrea, and helped him up the hill to excellence. Giuliano da
Sangallo took him to Rome and gave him lodging. Bramante commissioned
him to make a wax copy of the Laocoon; it was so well done that it was
cast in bronze for Cardinal Grimani. Perhaps through Bramante’s
influence Andrea turned from sculpture to architecture, and soon
received lucrative commissions.</p>
<p>He was in Rome when the sack came, and, like many other artists, he
lost all his possessions. He made his way to Venice, thinking to go to
France; but the Doge Andrea Gritti begged him, instead, to strengthen
the pillars and cupolas of St. Mark’s. His work so pleased the Senate
that he was made state architect (1529). For six years he labored to
improve the Piazza San Marco, banishing the butchers’ shops that had
sullied the Piaz - zetta, opening new streets, and helping to make
St. Mark’s Square the spacious delight that it is today.</p>
<p>In 1536 he built the Zecca or mint, and began his most celebrated
build- ing, the Libreria Vecchia, facing the Palace of the Doges. He
designed the fagade with a stately double portico of Doric and Ionic
columns, handsome cornices and balconies, and decorative statuary. Some
have rated this Old Library “the most beautiful profane edifice in
Italy”; 1 but the multiplica - tion of columns is excessive, and the
structure can hardly compare with the Palace of the Doges. In any case
the Procurators liked it, raised Sansovino’s salary, and exempted him
from war taxes. In 1 544 one of the main arches collapsed, and the vault
crashed down. Sansovino was thrown into jail and heavily fined, but
Aretino and Titian persuaded the Procurators to release and pardon him.
The arch and vault were repaired, and the building was successfully
completed in 1553. Meanwhile (1540) Sansovino had designed the pretty
Loggetta, or vestibule for police, on the eastern side of the Campanile,
and had adorned it with bronze and terra-cotta sculptures. In St. Mark’s
he cast bronze doors for a sacristy, and took occasion to portray, among
the reliefs, not only Aretino but Titian and himself.</p>
<p>The three men had now become firm friends, enviously known in</p>
<p>Venetian art circles as “the Triumvirate.” Many an evening they spent
to - gether, talking shop, or entertaining such beauty as could be
engaged for the time. Iacopo rivaled Aretino in popularity with women,
and Titian in longevity. He remained strong and healthy, and (we are
assured) enjoyed perfect eyesight, till his eighty-fourth year. 2 For
fifty years he never con-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>suited a physician; during summers he lived almost entirely on fruit.
When Paul III invited him to succeed Antonio da Sangallo as chief
architect at St. Peter’s, he refused, saying that he would not exchange
his life in a re - public for service under an absolute ruler. 3 Ercole
II of Ferrara and Duke Cosimo of Florence in vain offered him large
stipends to take up residence at their courts. He died peacefully in
1570, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.</p>
<p>In that year appeared an epoch-making work — Four Books of Architec-
ture — by Andrea Palladio, who gave his name to a style that endured
here and there into our own time. Like so many others, Andrea went to
Rome and was thrilled by the ruined grandeur of the Forum. He came to
love those broken columns and capitals as the finest conceptions that
architecture had ever reached; he almost memorized Vitruvius; and his
own book strove to restore to Renaissance building all those principles
which, he thought, had created the glory of classic Rome. It seemed to
him that the finest architecture would avoid all ornament that did not
spring spontaneously from the constructive style itself; it would pledge
itself to a strict propor- tion, connection, and congruity of the parts
in an organic whole; it would be classically noble and strong, as chaste
as a vestal virgin, and as dignified as an emperor.</p>
<p>His first major work was his best, and is one of the outstanding
structures of secular Italy. Around the Palazzo della Ragione or Town
Hall of his na- tive Vicenza he built (1549^ magnificent and powerful
arcades, trans- forming an undistinguished Gothic core into a Basilica
Palladiana that might vie with the Basilica Iulia of the Roman Forum
itself: a tier of arches sustaining Doric columns and pilasters, a
massive architrave, a railing and balcony elegantly carved, a second
tier of arches, on Ionic columns, a classic cornice and railing, and —
above each spandrel — a statue rising to over- see the city and give it
an exemplar of greatness. “I do not question,” he wrote in his book
twenty- one years later, “but that this fabric may be com - pared with
the ancient edifices, and be looked upon as one of the most noble and
beautiful buildings erected since the time of the ancients.” 4 If he had
confined his challenge to civic buildings the boast might stand.</p>
<p>Palladio became the hero of Vicenza, which felt that he had surpassed
Sansovino’s Libreria Vecchia. Rich men plied him with commissions for
palaces and villas, ecclesiastics for churches; before he died (1580) he
had transformed his city almost into an ancient Roman municipality. He
built a loggia for the city administration, a pretty museum, a splendid
Teatro Olimpico. Venice called him, and there he designed two of her
finest churches — San Giorgio Maggiore and the Redentore. Even before
his death</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>653</p>
<p>he had become a powerful influence in Italy. Early in the seventeenth
cen- tury Inigo Jones brought the Palladian style into England; it
spread through Western Europe, and came to America.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a misfortune. It never really captured the dignity
of</p>
<p>Roman architecture; it confused its fagades with a plethora of
columns, capitals, cornices, moldings, and statuary; the details detract
from the sim- ple lines and clarity of a classic edifice. And by
reverting so humbly to an ancient style, Palladio forgot that a living
art should express its own epoch and mood, not those of another age.
That is why, when we think of the Renaissance, we do not call to mind
its architecture, nor even its sculpture, but above all its painting,
which bore lightly the traditions of Alexandria and Rome, freed itself
from cramping and uncongenial Byzantine molds, and made itself the
authentic voice and color of the time.</p>

<li>aretino: 1492-1556 5</li>
</ol>
<p>To make sure that 1492 would be memorable, Pietro Aretino, Scourge of
Princes and Prince of Blackmailers, came into the world on Good Friday
of that year. His father was a poor shoemaker of Arezzo, known to us
only as Luca. Like many other Italians, Pietro received in time the name
of his birthplace, and became Aretino. His enemies insisted that his
mother was a prostitute; he denied it, and claimed that his mother was a
pretty girl named Tita, who posed as a Madonna for painters, but in a
careless mo- ment conceived Pietro while in the arms of a casual but
noble lover, Luigi Bacci. Aretino did not mind being a bastard, having
such distinguished company in that class; and Luigi’s legitimate sons,
when Pietro became</p>
<p>Having attained the maturity of twelve years, he set out to make his
fortune. He found work as a bookbinder’s assistant in Perugia, and there
he studied art sufficiently to become in later years an excellent critic
and connoisseur. He himself did some painting. In the chief square of
Perugia was a holy picture, fondly reverenced by the people, showing
Magdalen fervent at the feet of Christ. One night Aretino painted a lute
in the arms of the Magdalene, changing her prayer into a serenade. When
the city seethed with anger at the prank, Pietro slipped out of Perugia
and examined Italy. He earned his bread as a servant in Rome, as a
street singer in Vicenza, as an innkeeper in Bologna. He served a term
in the galleys, be- came a hired man in a monastery, was discharged for
lechery, and returned to Rome (1516). There he labored as a lackey for
Agostino Chigi. The banker was not unkindly, but Aretino had discovered
his own peculiar</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>genius, and fretted under servantry. He wrote a bitter satire
describing a scullion’s life: “cleaning privies, polishing chamberpots .
. . performing lewd offices for cooks and stewards who soon see to it
that he is all pricked out and embroidered with the French disease.” 8
He showed his poems to some of Chigi’s guests, and word went around that
this Pietro was the sharpest and witties satirist in Rome. His pieces
began to circulate. Pope Leo enjoyed them, sent for the author, laughed
at his rough frank humor, and added him to the papal staff as a cross
between poet and jester. For three years Pietro ate well.</p>
<p>Suddenly Leo died, and Aretino was afloat again. As the conclave dal-
lied in choosing a successor, he wrote satires on the electors and the
can- didates, affixed the sheets to the statue of Pasquino, and poked
fun at so many dignitaries that soon he had hardly a friend in the city.
When</p>
<p>Adrian VI was elected, and began a most unwelcome campaign of reform,
Pietro fled to Florence, then to Mantua (1523), where Federigo took him
on as court poet at a moderate salary. When the death of Adrian answered
Rome’s prayers, and a rich Medici sat again on the throne of thrones,
Pietro, like a thousand other poets, artists, rascals, and rakes,
hurried back to the capital.</p>
<p>Almost at once he ended his welcome there. Giulio Romano had painted
twenty pictures describing various erotic attitudes; Marcantonio
Raimondi made engravings for them; for each engraving, says Vasari,
“Messer Pietro</p>
<p>He walks through Rome dressed like a duke. He takes part in all</p>
<p>the wild doings of the lords. He pays his way with insults
couched</p>
<p>in tricked up words. He talks well, and he knows every libelous</p>
<p>anecdote in the city. The Estes and the Gonzagas walk arm in arm</p>
<p>with him, and listen to his prattle. He treats them with respect,
and</p>
<p>is haughty to everyone else. He lives on what they give him. His</p>
<p>gifts as a satirist make people afraid of him, and he revels in
hearing</p>

<p>&lt;555</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>himself called a cynical, impudent slanderer. All that he needed was
a fixed pension. He got one by dedicating to the Pope a second-rate
poem. 8</p>
<p>Aretino would not have questioned any of this. As if to illustrate
it, he asked the Mantuan ambassador to solicit for him from Feder igo
“two pairs of shirts worked with gold . . . two pairs worked in silk,
together with two golden caps.” When these took too much time in coming
he threatened to annihilate the Marquis with a diatribe. The ambassador
warned Federigo: “Your Excellency knows his tongue; therefore I will say
no more.” Soon four shirts worked in gold arrived, and four of silk, and
two gold caps, and two silk hats. “Aretino,” wrote the ambassador, “is
satisfied.” Pietro could now really dress like a duke.</p>
<p>This second period of Roman prosperity was ended by a cloak-and-</p>
<p>dagger romance. Aretino composed an insulting sonnet on a young woman
employed in the datary’s kitchen. Another of Giberti’s household,
Achille della Volta, attacked Aretino in the street at two o’cloc k in
the morning (1525), stabbed him twice in the chest, and so severely in
the right hand that two fingers had to be cut off. The wounds were not
mortal; Aretino healed rapidly. He demanded the arrest of Achille, but
neither Clement nor his datary intervened. Pietro suspected the datary
of planning to have him murdered, and he decided that the time had come
for another Italian tour. He moved to Mantua, and resumed his service
with Federigo (1525). A year later, hearing that Giovanni delle Bande
Nere was marshaling a force to check Frundsberg’s invasion, a secret
atom of nobility stirred in him; he rode a hundred miles to join
Giovanni at Lodi. All the ink in his veins tingled at the thought that
he, the poor poet, might become a man of ac- tion, might even carve out
for himself a principality, and be himself a prince, and no mere
literary menial of a prince. And, indeed, the young commander, as
generous as Don Quixote, promised to make him a marquis at least. But
brave Giovanni was killed, and Aretino, putting aside the helmet he had
received, returned to Mantua and his pen.</p>
<p>He composed now a mock giudizio, or almanac, for 1527, predicting
absurd or evil fates for those he disliked. Furious against Clement for
giv- ing Giovanni delle Bande Nere inadequate and vacillating support,
Aretino included the Pope among the victims of his satire. Clement
expressed sur- prise that Federigo should harbor so irreverent an enemy
of the papacy. Federigo gave Aretino a hundred crowns, and advised him
to get out of the papal reach. “I will go to Venice,” said Pietro; “only
in Venice does justice hold the scales with an even balance.” He arrived
in March, 1527, and took a house on the Grand Canal. He was fascinated
by the views across the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>656</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>lagoon, and by the teeming traffic of what he called “the fairest
highway in the world.” “I have determined,” he wrote, “to live in Venice
forever.” He addressed a letter of lordly compliments to the Doge Andrea
Gritti, praising the majestic beauty of Venice, the justice of her laws,
the security of her people, the asylum she offered to political and
intellectual refugees; and he added, magnificently: “I, who have
stricken terror into kings . . . give myself to you, fathe rs of your
people.” 9 The Doge took him at his own estimate, assured him of
protection, assigned him a pension, and inter- ceded for him with the
Pope. Though invitations were to come to Aretino from several foreign
courts, he remained a loyal resident of Venice through- out his
remaining twenty-nine years.</p>
<p>The furniture and art that he gathered into his new home attested the
power of his pen, for they were given or made possible by the generosity
or timidity of his patrons. Tintoretto himself paint ed the ceiling of
Pietro’s private apartments. Soon the walls shone with pictures by
Titian, Sebasti- ano del Piombo, Giulio Romano, Bronzino, Vasari; there
were statues by Iacopo Sansovino and Alessandro Vittoria. A rich ebony
casket contained the letters received by Aretino from princes, prelates,
captains, artists, poets, musicians, and noble dames; later he would
publish these letters in two volumes totaling 875 closely printed pages.
There were carved chests and chairs, and a walnut bed fit for Pietro’s
now ample form. Amid that art and luxury Aretino lived and dressed
literally like a lord, dispersing charity to the neighborhood poor,
entertaining a host of friends and a succession of mistresses.</p>
<p>Where did he get the means to support so lavish a life? Partly from
the sale of his writings to publishers, partly from gifts and pensions
sent him by men and women who feared his scorn and sought his praise.
The satires, poems, letters, and plays that rushed from his pen were
bought by the most alert or important people in Italy, all eager to see
what he had to say about personalities and events, and delighting in his
blasts at the corruption, hypocrisy, oppression, and immorality of the
times. Ariosto inserted into the 1532 edition of Orlando furioso two
lines that added two titles to Pietro’s name:</p>
<p>Ecco il flagello</p>
<p>De’ principi, il divin Pietro Aretino — 10</p>
<p>“Behold the Scourge of Princes, the divine Pietro Aretino”; soon it
be - came the fashion to speak of the coarsest and most scurrilous major
writer of the age as divine.</p>

<p>657</p>
<p>His renown was Continental. His satires were at once translated into
French; a bookseller on the Rue St. Jacques in Paris made a fortune
retail- ing them. 11 They were welcomed in England, Poland, Hungary;
Aretino and Machiavelli, said a contemporary, were the only Italian
authors read in Germany. In Rome, where his favorite victims lived, his
writings were sold out on the day of their publication. If we may take
his own estimate, his receipts from his various publications amounted to
a thousand crowns (2,500?) a year. Moreover, in eighteen years, “the
alchemy of my pen has drawn over 25,000 gold crowns from the entrails of
various princes.” Kings, emperors, dukes, popes, cardinals, sultans,
pirates were among his tributaries. Charles V gave him a collar worth
300 crowns, Philip II an- other worth 400; Francis I a still more costly
chain. 12 Francis and Charles competed for his favor with promises of
fat pensions. Francis promised more than he gave; “I adored him,” said
Aretino, “but never to get money from the stirring of his liberality is
enough to cool the furnaces of Murano”</p>
<p>His satires hardly hold our attention today, for their force lay
mostly in pointed allusion to local events too tied to the time to have
lasting sig- nificance. They were popular because it is hard for us not
to enjoy the excoriation of others; because they exposed real abuses,
and courageously attacked the great and powerful; and because they
brought all the resources of the language of the streets to the uses of
literature and gainful literary homicide. Aretino exploited the human
interest in sex and sin by writing Ragionamenti — conversations — among
prostitutes about the secrets and prac- tices of nuns, wives, and
courtesans. The title page announced the book as “The Dialogues of Nanna
and Antonia . . . composed by the divine</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>658</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>Aretino for his pet monkey Capricio, and for the correction of the
three states of women. Given to the printer in this month of April,
1533, in the illustrious city of Venice.” 15 Aretino here anticipates
the rollicking ribaldry and epithetic frenzy of Rabelais; he revels in
four-letter words, and achieves some startling phrases (“I’d wager my
soul against a pistachio nut”); and he indites such lively descriptions
as that of the pretty wife of seventeen — the “finest little piece of
flesh that I think I ever saw”— who, married to a man of sixty, took to
sleepwalking as a way of “jousting with the lances of the night.” 16 The
conclusions to which the dialogues come is that courte - sans are the
most praiseworthy of the three classes of women, for the wives and nuns
are faithless to their vows, while the courtesans live up to their
professions and give an honest night’s labor for their pay. Italy was
not shocked; it laughed with delight.</p>
<p>Now, too, Aretino composed the most popular of his plays — La corti-
giana, The Courtesan. Like most Italian comedies of the Renaissance, it
followed the Plautine tradition of servants making fools of their
masters, arranging intrigues for them, serving as their panders and
their brains. But Aretino added something of his own: his burlesque and
bawdy humor, his intimacy with prostitutes, his hatred of courts — above
all, of the papal court — and his uninhibited transcript of life as he
had seen it in the brothels and palaces of Rome. He laid bare the
hypocrisies, timeserving, humiliations, flatteries required of the
courtier; and in a famous line he defined slander as “telling the
truth”; it was his pithy apologia for his life. In another Aretino</p>
<p>In the same year that produced these idyls of the stews, Aretino com-
posed a long series of religious works — The Humanity of Christ, The
Seven Penitential Psalms, The Life of the Virgin Mary, The Life of the
Virgin Catherine, The Life of St. Thomas, Lord of Aquino, etc. They
were</p>
<p>largely compo unded of fiction, and Pietro confessed that they were
“poeti - cal lies,” but they won him the plaudits of the pious, even of
the virtuous Vittoria Colonna. In some quarters he was regarded as a
pillar of the Church. There was talk of making him a cardinal.</p>
<p>It was probably his letters that sustained his fame as well as his
fortune. Many of these were eulogies addressed to the eulogized, or to
persons near them. They were frankly intended to elicit gifts, pensions,
or other favors;</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>659</p>
<p>sometimes they specified what was to be given, and when. Aretino pub-
lished — printed — these letters almost as soon as he wrote them; this
was necessary to their extractive power. Italy snapped them up because
they provided an indirect intimacy with famous men and women, and
because they were written with an originality, vivacity, and force
unequaled by any other writer of the day. Aretino had style without
seeking it. He laughed at the Bembos who polished their stanzas into
perfect lifelessness; he ended the humanist idolatry of Latin, of
correctness and grace. Pre- tending to be ignorant of literature, he
felt free from cramping exemplars; he accepted in his writing one
overruling rule: to enounce spontaneously, in direct and simple
language, his experience and criticism of life, and the needs of his
wardrobe and larder. Amid the mountain of hypocritical rub- bish of
these letters some diamonds can be found: tender epistles to a favorite
ailing harlot, lusty accounts of his domestic history, a sunset de-
scribed in a letter to Titian almost as brilliantly as Titian or Turner
could paint it, and a letter to Michelangelo suggesting, for The Last
Judgment, a design much more appropriate than that which the artist
used.</p>
<p>Aretino’s understanding and appreciation of art were among the
better</p>
<p>He was both better and worse than he was painted. He had almost every
vice, and was accused of sodomy. His hypocrisy made his own Ipocrita
seem by comparison sincere. His language, when he set his mind to it,
could be a cloaca maxima of filth. He could be brutal and unmanly, as
when he gloated over the fallen Clement; but he had the grace to write,
later: “I am ashamed that in censuring him I did so in the depth of his
af- flictions .” 17 He was physically an unabashed coward; but he had
the cour - age to denounce powerful persons and highly cherished abuses.
His most visible virtue was generosity. He gave to his friends and the
poor a large part of what he received in pensions, earnings, gifts, and
bribes. He waived</p>
<p>660 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>royalties on his published letters, so that they might be sold more
cheaply, and acquire wider fame and higher value. He was annually near
bank- ruptcy with Christmas giving. Giovanni delle Bande Nere said to
Guic- ciardini: “I yield to no man in generosity, unless it be to Messer
Pietro, - tines.”</p>
<p>He had whatever virtue is implied by abundant animal spirits; in
private he was a good-natured animal who had never learned a moral code.
He thought — with some excuse in those times — that no person of any
con- sequence had any real moral code. He told Vasari that he had never
seen a maiden whose features did not betray a touch of sensuality . 20
His own sensuality was gross, but to his friends it appeared to be
merely the spon- taneous exuberance of life. Hundreds of people found
him lovable; princes and priests delighted in his conversation. He had
no education, but he seemed to know everybody and everything. He became
human in his love for Giovanni delle Bande Nere, for Caterina and the
two children she bore him, and for frail, consumptive, gracious,
faithless Pierina Riccia.</p>
<p>She came into his household as the fourteen-year-old wife of his
secre- tary. They lived with him, and he played father to her; soon he
loved her with a consuming and solicitous paternal affection. He
reformed his morals, kept, of his mistresses, only Caterina and their
babe Adria. Then, just as he was simmering down to respectability, a
Venetian nobleman, whose wife he had charmed, accused him in court of
blasphemy and sodomy. He de- nied the charges, but dared not face the
exposures and chances of trial; conviction would have meant long
imprisonment or death. He fled from his house, and hid for weeks with
friends. They persuaded the court to dismiss the charges; Aretino
returned to his home in triumph, cheered by crowds on both sides of the
Grand Canal. But he was heartbroken to find in Pierina’s eyes that she
thought him guilty. Then Pierina’s husband de -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) SUNSET IN VENICE 66 1</p>
<p>serted her. When she came to Pietro for consolation he made her his
mis- tress. She developed tuberculosis, and for thirteen months was near
death; he nursed her with anxious tenderness, and brought her back to
health. At the height of his devotion she left him for a younger lover.
He tried to con- vince himself that it was better so, but from that day
his spirit was broken, and old age advanced upon him triumphantly.</p>
<p>He grew fat, but never ceased to vaunt his sexual powers. He fre-</p>
<p>quented brothels, and became more and more religious, he who in his
youth had laughed at resurrections as “nonsense” which “only the rabble
takes seriously.” 21 In 1554 he went to Rome hoping to be crowned with a
red hat, but Julius III could only make him a Knight of St. Peter. In
that year he was evicted from the Casa Aretino for failure to pay his
rent. He took more modest quarters, away from the Grand Canal. Two years
later he died of apoplexy, aged sixty-four. He had confessed some
fraction of his sins, and had received the Eucharist and Extreme
Unction; and he was buried in the church of San Luca as if he had not
been the very paragon and apostle of lechery. A wit composed for him a
possible epitaph:</p>
<p>Qui giace I’Aretin, poeta tosco,</p>
<p>Chi disse mal d’ognun fuorche Dio,</p>
<p>Scusandosi col dir, Non lo conosco</p>
<p>which is to say:</p>
<p>Here lies the Tuscan poet Aretino,</p>
<p>Who evil spoke of everyone but God,</p>
<p>Giving as his excuse, “I never knew him.”</p>

<li>TITIAN AND THE KINGS: 1530-76</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1530, at Bologna, Aretino introduced Titian to Charles V. The Em-
peror, absorbed in reorganizing Italy, sat impatiently for a portrait,
and paid the astonished artist a single ducat (2.50). Federigo of
Mantua, calling Titian “the best painter now living,” added out of his
own pocket a</p>
<p>princely 1 50 ducats to the fee. Gradually the Duke brought Charles
to his own point of view. In 1532 artist and Emperor met again. During
the next sixteen years Titian painted a dazzling sequence of Imperial
portraits: Charles in full armor (1532, now lost); Charles in brocaded
coat, em- broidered doublet, white breeches, stockings and shoes, and
black cap with an inappropriate white feather (1533?); Charles with the
Empress Isabella</p>
<p>66 z</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>(1538); Charles in shining armor on a prancing steed at the battle of
Miihl- berg (1548) — a glory of color and pride; Charles in somber
black, seated meditative on a balcony (1548). It is a credit to painter
and King that these portraits make no attempt to idealize their subject,
except in cos- tume; they show Charles’s unprepossessing features, his
bad skin, his gloomy spirit, and a certain capacity for cruelty; and yet
they reveal the Emperor, a man of burdens and authority, a cold, hard
mind that had brought half of western Europe under its rule. He could be
kind neverthe- less, and atone handsomely for his initial miserliness.
In 1533 he sent Titian a patent making him a count palatine, and a
Knight of the Golden Spur; and from that year Titian was officially
court painter to the most powerful monarch in Christendom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, presumably through Federigo, Titian had entered into cor-
respondence with Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, who had
married Eleonora Gonzaga, Federigo’s sister and Isabella’s daughter.
Since Francesco was now commander in chief of the Venetian armies, he
and his Duchess were frequently in Venice. There Titian painted their
por- traits: a man nine tenths mail (for Titian liked its sheen), a
woman pale and resigned after many illnesses. For them Titian painted on
wood a Magdalen attractive only for the remarkable variations of light
and hue that the artist gave to her auburn hair; and again for them a
lovely por- trait, in green and brown, known only as La Bella, and now
in the Pitti Gallery. For Federigo’s successor, Duke Guidobaldo II,
Titian made one of art’s most perfect nudes, the Ve nus of Urbino ( c .
1538). Titian, we are told, had put some finishing touches on
Giorgione’s Sleeping Venus; now he imitated that masterpiece in all but
the accompaniments and the features. Here the face lacks the guileless
peace of Giorgione’s version ; and instead of a quiet landscape we see a
rich interior of green curtain, brown drape, and red couch, while two
maids search for robes gorgeous enough to fitly clothe the lady’s golden
flesh.</p>
<p>From Duke and Emperor Titian passed on to paint the Pope. Paul
III</p>
<p>was also imperial: a man of virile character and subtle craft, with a
face that recorded two generations of history; here was a better
opportunity for Titian than he had found in the uncommunicative Emperor.
At Bolo- gna in 1535 Paul faced br avely the realism of Titian’s
portraiture. Aged sixty-seven, tired but indomitable, he sat in his
flowing papal robes, the long head and large beard bent over a once
powerful frame, the ring of au- thority conspicuous on his aristocratic
hand; this and Raphael’s Julius II contest the distinction of being the
finest, deepest portrait of the Italian</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>66 3</p>
<p>Renaissance. In 1 545 the Pope invited Titian, himself now
sixty-eight, to Rome. The artist was lodged in the Belvedere, and
received all the honors of the city; Vasari acted as his cicerone in
showing him the wonders of classic and Renaissance Rome; even
Michelangelo welcomed him, and, in a moment of courtesy, concealed from
him an opinion expressed to friends, that Titian would have been a
greater painter had he learned to draw. 22 There Titian painted Paul
again, older, more bent, more harassed than be- fore, between two
obsequious grandsons who were soon to rebel against the Pope; this, too,
is among Tit ian’s profoundest works. For one of these grandsons,
Ottavio Farnese, he painted the voluptuous Danae of the Naples Museum.
After eight months in Rome he traveled slowly back via Flor- ence to
Venice (1546), hoping to spend his remaining days there in rest and
peace.</p>
<p>But a year later the Emperor urgently called him over the Alps to
Augs- burg. There he stayed nine months, making two of the imperial
portraits listed above, and immortalizing slim Spanish grandees and
mountainous Teutons like the Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. On a
second visit to Augsburg (1550) Titian met the future Philip II of
Spain, and made sev- eral pictures of him; one of these, in the Prado,
is among the master portraits of the Renaissance. Lovelier still is the
likene ss that he painted of Charles’s Portuguese wife, the Empress
Isabella. She had died in 1539, but the Em- peror, four years later,
gave Titian a middling representation of her by an obscure artist, and
asked him to change it into a work of finished art. The result may not
resemble the Empress, but even as an imaginary portrait this Isabella of
Portugal must rank high among Titian’s pictures: a refined and
melancholy face, a most royal costume, a book of prayers to console her
premonition of an early death, a distant landscape providing overtones
of green and brown and blue. Titian many times over earned his noble
rank.</p>
<p>After his return from Augsburg (1552) Titian felt that he had
traveled enough. He was seventy-five, and doubtless thought that he had
not much longer to live. Perhaps his busyness made for his longevity;
absorbed in painting after painting, he forgot to die. In a long
succession of religious pictures (1522-70) he gave his own colorful and
dramatic rendering of the Christian creed and story from Adam to
Christ.* He commemorated with</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., The Fall of Man ( c . 1570, Prado) — a frank apotheosis of the
human form; The Annunciation ( c . 1545, Scuola di San Rocco, Venice;
still another in San Salvatore, Venice); The Gypsy Madonna (1510,
Vienna); Mater Dolorosa (1554, Prado); The Presentation (1538, Venice) —
a vast panorama (twenty-six by eleven and a half feet) of mountainous
landscape, majestic architecture, and colorful figures, with Mary
pictured as a girl diffi- dently asce nding the Temple steps, two of
Titian’s loveliest women at the base, against the</li>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>

<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>powerful images the Apostles and the saints. The best and most
unpleasant of these is The Martyrdom of St. Lawrence (1558 , 1 Gesuiti,
Venice): the saint is being roasted on a gridiron by Roman soldiers and
slaves, who add to his discomfort with hot irons and flagellation. These
religious pictures do not move us as deeply as the similar works of the
Florentines; they excel in anatomy, but give no sense of piety; one look
at the athletic figures of Christ and the Apostles makes it clear that
Titian’s interest was purely tech - nical, that he was thinking of
splendid bodies, not of ascetic saints. In the interval between the
Bellini and Titian Christianity, while still proposing topics, had lost
its spiritual hold on Venetian art. 23</p>
<p>That sensual element which is one requisite of pictorial or plastic
art re- mained strong in Titian for almost a century. He repeated his
Farnese Danae in several variations, and made many a Venus for defenders
of the faith. Philip II of Spain was his best customer for these
“mythologies”; the royal apartments in Madrid were adorned with a Danae,
Venus and Adonis, Perseus and Andromeda, Jason and Medea, Actaeon and
Diana, The Rape of Europa, Tar quin and Lucretia, Diana and Callisto,
and Jupiter and Antiope (also known as The Venus of Pardo ) ; and all
but the last of these were painted by Titian after 1553, when he was
seventy-six or more. It is encouraging to find the Master’s imagination
creating in his eighties female nudes as perfect as those that he had
portrayed in his prime. The Dianas,</p>
<p>wall an old woman realer than life, selling eggs; this is one of
Titian’s finest religious pic - tures. He painted Mary again in The
Virgin with the Rabbit (c. 1530, Louvre). The Trans - figuration ( c .
1560, San Salvatore, Venice), the work of a man of eighty-three, is a
vigorous conception of the astonished Apostles, with a glowing
representation of the illuminated Christ. In The Last Supper (1564
Escorial) every figure is masterly except that of Christ — where
Leonardo also failed; and in Christ Crowned with Thorns (1542, Louvre),
Jesus, as in Michelangelo, is a gladiator rather than a saint. The Ecce
Ho?no of the Vienna Gallery ( c . 1543) still leaves Christ a massive
and muscular divinity, whom Pilate (a humorous portrait of Aretino)
offers to a crowd not of Jerusalem’s rabble, but of such distinguished
personalities as Charles V, Suleim an the Magnificent, Titian’s daughter
Lavinia, and Titian himself. A Crucifixion in Ancona ( c . 1560) reduces
the suffering Christ to more credible proportions; and another in the
Escorial ( c . 1565) effectively pictures the darkness, at the final
hour, enveloping hills and sky and cross and the watchers at its foot.
Twice — in 1529 (in the Louvre) and thirty years later (in the Prado) —
Titian pictured The Burial of Christ; in the later — perhaps also in the
earlier — painting he portrayed himself as Joseph of Arimathea. At an
uncertain date he represented The Supper at Ernmaus (Louvre), exquisite
but too refined; Rembrandt would more successfully convey the awe felt
in that moment of in- credulous recognition. For Charles V Titian
painted (1554) a picture variously called The Trinity or The Last
Judgment , and labeled La Gloria in the Prado: a confusing mass of heads
and legs, and, in a cloud, the First and Second Persons of the Trinity,
with the Holy Ghost taking the form of light. It seems a little absurd,
but the Emperor took it with him when he retired to a convent in 1557,
and ordered it placed above the high altar after his death.</p>

<p>665</p>
<p>with their upswept auburn hair, are of the type that Veronese was
using- blonde Venuses almost lovelier than any Aphrodite of the Greeks.
Per- haps the same lady, grown ampler, appears in Venus ’with the Mirror
( c . 1 555, Washington); she is again the Venus who clings to Adonis in
the Prado picture, struggling to woo him from his dogs. Not even in
Correg- gio is there so frankly sensual a riot of feminine flesh. And
there are still other Venuses scattered in the galleries, but once
peopling Titian’s brain: the Venus Anadyomene (c. 1520) of Bridgewater
House, standing in the bath, and modestly concealed below the knees; the
Venus and Cupid (c. 1545) of the Uffizi — a Germanic blonde with
impeccable hands; the clothed Venus of The Education of Cupid ( c .
1565) in the Borghese Gal- lery; the Prado Venus with the Organ Player
(c. 1545), who cannot keep his mind on his music; and a Venus with the
Lute Player (1560) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It must be said,
however, that the women in these pictures are but part of their charm;
Titian is interested in nature as well as women, and paints on several
of these canvases splendid landscapes that are sometimes as lovely as
the goddess herself.</p>
<p>Greater and deeper than these mythological pictures are the
portraits. If the Venuses display a sense of form that never grew dull,
the portraits reveal in Titian an ability to seize and convey human
character with a force of art unequaled, in their total gallery, by the
combined portraits of any other hand. What could be finer than the
anonymous Man with the Glove ( c . 1520, Louvre) ? — whose gloved left
hand and delicate white ruff about the neck harmonize so well with the
sensitive spirit mirrored in the eyes. Cardinal Ippolito de’ Medici
(1533, Pitti) is a less searching por - trayal, and yet in the face are
the subtlety, the artistic sense, the love of power, that marked the
Medici. The Francis l (c. 1538, Louvre) made the French King’s features
famous, sending over the world, in a hundred thousand reproductions, the
feathered hat and jolly eye and rapier nose and handsome beard and
scarlet shirt of the man who lost Italy but won Leonardo and Cellini and
a hundred women. Titian’s official post required him to paint portraits
of various doges; nearly all these portraits are lost; three masterly
figures rema in: Niccolo Marcello (who died before Titan’s birth) — an
ugly face and a gorgeous robe; Antonio Grimani (in the picture of Faith
in the Doges’ Palace)— an ascetic face and a gorgeous robe; and Andrea
Gritti — a less gorgeous robe, but a powerful face concentrating in
itself all the resolute majesty of Venice. In an opposite vein is the
delicate Clarice Strozzi, which Aretino praised too fully. The portraits
of</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Aretino, in the Pitti Gallery at Florence and in the Frick Collection
in</p>
<p>New York, are merciless evocations of a fascinating scoundrel by his
dearest friend. Tenderer is Titian’s commemoration of Bembo, the poet
lover by this time (1542) become a cardinal. Among the greatest
portraits in Titian’s gall ery is The Jurist Ippolito Riminaldi (1542),
once known a s The Duke of Norfolk — disheveled brown hair, high
forehead, scanty mustache and beard, firm lips, fine nose, piercing
glance; we begin to un- derstand Italy and Venice better when we see
that they had such men, in whom fine bodies and fine clothes were but
the outward form of strong wills ready for any challenge, and
penetrating minds alert to every facet of experience and art.</p>
<p>Titian’s most interesting portraits were of himself. He pictured
himself several times, finally at eighty-nine. Standing before this
autoritratto in the Prado, we see a face lined and yet cleaned by the
flow of countless days; a skullcap not quite enclosing the white hair; a
red beard almost covering the face; a large nose breathing power; blue
eyes a little somber, seeing death closer than it really was; the hand
grasping a brush — the great artistic passion not yet spent. This — not
the doges, not the senators, not the merchants — was the lord of Venice
for half a century, giving immortality to transient aristocrats and
kings, and raising his adopted city to a place beside Florence and Rome
in the history of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>He was a rich man now, though the memory of early insecurity made him
acquisitive to t he end. Venice exempted him from certain taxes, “out of
regard for his rare excellence.” 24 He wore elegant clothing, and lived
in a comfortable home with a spacious garden that overlooked the lagoon;
we picture him there entertaining poets, artists, blue bloods,
cardinals, and kings. The mistress whom he had married in 1525, after
having two sons by her, died in 1530, and he resumed the baccalaureate
liberty that he had enjoyed for almost half a century before. His
daughter Lavinia was a joy and pride, and he made fond portraits of her,
even in her matronly ampli- tude; but she too died a few years after his
marriage. One son, Pomponio, became a worthless wastrel, saddening the
old man’s heart; the other, Orazio, painted some lost pictures, and
probably shared in the works as- cribed to his father’s final years.
Perhaps another of Titian’s pupils— Domenico Theotocopoulos, “El Greco”—
helped him then, though there is no sign of it in Titian’s buxom figures
and joyous scenes.</p>
<p>Far into old age he painted almost every day, and found in his art
his only secure happiness. There he knew that he was master, that all
the</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>66 7</p>
<p>world acclaimed him, and that his hand had not lost its cunning, nor
his eye its keenness; even his intellect, as well as his imagination,
seemed to keep its power to the end. Some purchasers complained that
these final paintings were sent to them unfinished; even so, they were
miracles. Probably no other painter — excepting Raphael — ever possessed
such techni- cal facility, such control of color and texture, such
wizardry of variegated light. His faults were those of rapid execution,
sometimes of careless draw- ing; most of his preliminary designs were
tentative; yet, when he cared to take the time, he could produce such a
marvel as the pen drawing of Medoro and Angelica in the Musee Bonnat at
Bayonne. In portraiture he had to work rapidly, for his subjects were
too impatient and occupied to give him long or frequent sittings;
therefore he made a quick sketch and painted from that, perhaps putting
more into the subject’s face and head than was really there. In
paintings other than portraits he gave too much prominence to physical
features, and seldom caught the spiritual essence; in depth of insight
and feeling he could not match Leonardo or Michelan- gelo. But how
healthy his art is compared with theirs! No abnormal intro- verted
broodings, no volcanic grumblings at the nature of the world and man;
Titian took the world as he found it, took men as he found them, took
women when he found them, and enjoyed them all. He was a frank pagan,
who contemplated the architecture of woman with delight through ninety
years; even his Virgins are healthy, happy, and nubile. The pov- ert y,
grief, and insecurity of life found little room in Titian’s art;
except</p>
<p>He grew old while painting, and lived a quarter century after the</p>
<p>normal span of life. In his eighty-eighth year he traveled to
Brescia, and accepted an arduous commission to paint a ceiling in the
palace of the commune. Vasari, visiting him in his ninetieth year, found
him at work, brush in hand. At ninety-one he painted a portrait of
Iacopo da Strada (Vienna), brilliant with color, strong with character.
But now at last his hand began to tremble, his eyes grew weak, and he
felt that the time had come for piety. In 1576, aged ninety-nine, he
agreed to paint a Burial of Christ for the church of the Frari, in
exchange for a burial place there, where already two of his greatest
works were hung. He did not finish it, and he fell a year short of
living out a century. In that year plague broke out in Venice; on each
day two hundred died; a fourth of the population succumbed to the
pestilence. Titian himself died during the plague, proba- bly not of it
but from old age (August 26, 1576). The government set</p>
<p>668</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>aside its prohibition of public gatherings in order to give him a
state fu- neral. He was buried in Santa Maria Gloriosa de’ Frari, as he
had wished. It was the end of a magnificent life, and a wondrous
age.</p>

</ol>
<p>It was not quite the end; for a power and spirit almost as great had
still eighteen years to live, and had still to paint his Paradise.</p>
<p>Iacopo Robusti was the son of a dyer; hence the diminutive nickname
by which the whimsical Italians have sent him down to history. He be-
came indeed a tintor as a great colorist; but his family name fitted him
well enough, for only a robust soul could have survived the long
struggle that Iacopo had to fight for recognition.</p>
<p>Almost the first notice we have of him is that he was apprenticed to
Titian at an unknown age, and was dismissed after a few days. Carlo
Ridolfi, writing a century later, recounts the incident from the point
of view of Tintoretto’s descendants:</p>
<p>When Titian came home and entered the place where his students</p>
<p>were, he saw some papers sticking out from a desk; and seeing cer-
tain figures drawn on them, he asked who had done them. Iacopo</p>
<p>said timidly that they were by his hand. Thereupon Titian,
foresee-</p>
<p>ing from such beginnings that the lad would become a very able man,
and would bring him some trouble in art, impatiently, as soon as he had
gone upstairs and laid aside his mantle, bade Girolamo Dante, his chief
pupil, to immediately forbid Iacopo the house. So a little tinge</p>
<p>of jealousy works in human hearts. 25</p>
<p>We should like to reject this story, but Aretino, Titian’ s bosom
friend, al- ludes to the incident in a letter of 1 549. The dismissal is
a fact, the inter- pretation is problematic. It is hard to believe that
Titian, who was already a painter to kings when Iacopo was only a lad of
twelve, could be jealous of so hypothetical a competitor, or that he
could see the future Tintoretto in the drawings of a student just
admitted to his school. It is possible that the drawings offended Titian
by their carelessness rather than by their excellence; careless drawing
remained a fault in Tintoretto through many years. Iacopo throughout his
life expressed great admiration for Titian, treasured a picture that
Titian had given him, and put upon the wall of his studio a constant
reminder of what he aspired to achieve in painting: “The design of
Michelangelo and the color of Titian.” 26</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>669</p>
<p>According to Ridolfi and tradition, Iacopo had no instruction
after</p>
<p>leaving Titian, but taught himself by assiduous copying and
experiment. He dissected bodies to learn anatomy. He observed almost
every object in his experience with predatory eagerness, resolved to
capture it in full detail in one or another of his paintings. He made
models in wax, wood, or cardboard, dressed them, and drew them from
every angle to find ways of portraying three dimensions in two. He had
casts made and sent to him of ancient marbles in Florence and Rome, and
of Michelangelo’s statuary; he set up these casts in his studio, and
painted images of them in divers shad- ows and lights. He was fascinated
by the variations produced in the ap- pearance of objects by changes in
the quantity, character, and incidence of light; he made a hundred
pictures by lamp or candle illumination; he grew too fond of dim
backgrounds and heavy shadows; he became a specialist in picturing the
play of light and shade upon hands and face and drapes, buildings and
landscapes and clouds. He left no pebble unturned in his struggle for
excellence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was an impatient haste, and lack of finish, in his
work — possibly a penalty of self-instruction — which deferred the
public recogni- tion of his art. For years after reaching manhood he had
to solicit oppor- tunities. He painted furniture, frescoed house fronts,
begged builders to get him decorative jobs at low fees, arid tried to
sell his pictures by displaying them in St. Mark’s Square. 27 Everybody
wanted Titian; and Titian and Aretino saw to it that nobody of
extractable substance should get anyone but Titian, or, if Titian was
busy, Bonifazio Veronese. Iacopo must have resented Aretino’s pictorial
pandering, but later, when the great Scourge</p>
<p>He was thirty before his first triumph came. The Scuola di San Marco
opened a competition for a painting of St. Mark delivering a slave. The
story was in Iacopo de Voragine’s Golden Legend: a Provencal servant had
promised St. Mark to make a pilgrimage to his grave in Alexandria; his
master refused him permission to go, but he went nevertheless. When he
returned the master ordered his eyes to be gouged out, but the iron</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>670</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>points pressed upon them failed to penetrate their surface. The
master order ed the slave’s limbs to be broken, but the iron rods failed
to make any impression upon them. The master, recognizing the
intervention of St. Mark, pardoned the slave. Tintoretto’s picture told
the tale with magnifi - cent color, convincing realism, and dramatic
intensity: the evangelist, clinging to his gospel, descends from heaven
to rescue his devotee, who is about to be beheaded by a Moor, while a
score of diverse figures look ex- citedly on. Iacopo seized every
opportunity the story gave him: to limn powerful male and graceful
female figures; to study the action of light upon Oriental velvets,
silks, and turbans; to bathe the scene in colors learned from Giorgione
and Titian. The directors of the Scuola were a bit frightened by the
fleshly realism of the painting; they debated whether to place it on
their walls; the impetuous Tintoretto proudly snatched it from their
hands and took it home. They came and begged him to return it; he let
them wait a chastening while, then yielded it. Aretino sent him a word
of praise, and career was now open to his talent.</p>
<p>Soon commissions came in multitude. A dozen churches solicited him, a
dozen lords, half a dozen princes and states. For these he told again,
in a hundred paintings, the mighty epic of the Christian cosmology,
theology, and eschatology, from the Creation to the Last Judgment. He
was not a religious man; few artists were in this sixteenth-century
Venice — half molded in soul and dominions by the heretical or Islamic
East; art was his religion, to which he sacrificed night and day. But
what finer subjects could a painter fancy than the legends of Adam and
Eve, and the story of Mary and her Babe, and the tragedy of the God-man
crucified, and the sufferings and marvels of the saints, and the awful
climax of all history in the summoning of the quick and the dead to the
judgment seat of Christ? *</p>

<p>The best of this long series is The Presentation ( c . 1556), which
Tinto- retto painted for the church of Madonna dell’ Orto: the Temple of
Jerusa - lem pictured in classic splendor; a timid little Mary welcomed
by the high priest with outstretched arms and beard; a woman, drawn with
the majesty of Pheidias, pointing Mary out to her daughter; other women
and their children, vividly realized; a prophet preaching enigmatic
prophecies; beg- gars and cripples half naked, crouching on the Temple
steps; this is a pic- ture rivaling the best of Titian, one of the grand
paintings of the Renais- sance.</p>
<p>Tintoretto’s success was confirmed when (1564) the Scuola di San</p>
<p>Rocco, or the Confraternity of St. Roch, named him to decorate their
al- bergo or assembly rooms. To choose a painter for the vast wall
surfaces, the directors invited artists to submit drawings for a picture
to fit into a ceiling oval, showing St. Roch in glory. While Paolo
Veronese, Andrea Schiavone, and others made sketches, Tintoretto painted
a finished picture, flaming with color and alive with action; had the
canvas secretly pasted in the assigned place and covered; and, on the
day when the others presented their drawings, had this painting
uncovered, to the consternation of judges and competitors. He excused
this unorthodox strategy on the ground that he could work best in this
impulsive way, instead of following a cartoon. The other artists cried
foul; Tintoretto withdrew from the contest, but left the painting as a
gift to the Fraternity. The Scuola finally accepted it, made Tintoretto
a member, gave him a salary of a hundred ducats a year for life, and
required of him, in return, to paint for them three pictures per
year.</p>
<p>In the next eighteen years (1564-81) he placed fifty-six scenes upon
the albergo walls. The rooms were poorly lighted; Tintoretto had to work
in semidarkness; he worked rapidly, laying on his colors coarsely, as to
be</p>
<p>Washing the Apostles’ Feet (Escorial) ; Raising of Lazarus (Leipzig)
; Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes (New York); Christ and the Samaritan
Woman (Uffizi); Last Supper (San Trovaso; another in San Stefano and in
San Giorgio Maggiore, and a magnificent drawing in the Uffizi);
Crucifixion (San Cassiano); Deposition (Venice, Parma, Milan, Pitti
Gallery); Burial of Christ (San Giorgio Maggiore) ; Descent into Limbo
(San Cassiano) ; Resurrection (Farrer Collection); Last Judgment
(Madonna dell’ Orto)— a vain attempt to exceed the confusion and
absurdities of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel fresco.</p>

<li>THE SAINTS: St. Augustine Healing Victims of the Plague (New York) ;
Miracle of St. Agnes (Madonna dell’ Orto); St. George and the Dragon
(London)— a study in light and shade, as of a night engagement; Marriage
of St. Catherine (Ducal Palace) ; Martyrdom of St. Catherine (Venice) —
in both cases a lovely lady whom only a fool would want to kill;
Transportation of the Body of St. Mark (Venice), and Finding of the Body
of St. Mark (Milan) — a masterly perspective of a darkened nave, a
kneeling patrician in holy terror, a charming lass whose knees are
clasped by a youth pretending fright, and a splendid St. Mark standing
erect over his own corpse.</li>

<p>seen from twenty feet below. These paintings became the most famous
one-man exhibition in Venetian history; and later artists came to study
them almost as students in Florence went to study Masaccio. Rain and
damp attacked the pictures through the years, but they are still
impressive in their scope and power. “Twenty or thirty years ago,” wrote
Ruskin a hundred years ago , “they were taken down to be restored; but
the man to whom the task was committed providentially died, and only one
of them was spoiled .” 29</p>
<p>In this astonishing museum Tintoretto told the Christian story
once</p>
<p>more, but as it had never been painted before, with an audacious
realism that took the episodes out of the world of ideal sentiment and
placed them in such natural surroundings that legend seemed transformed
into the most indubitable history. The capacity to see, to note every
detail of a scene, to feel these details as giving life, to dash them on
to the wall with a stroke or two of the brush — like the water visible
through the laurel roots in the Magdalen — these were sparks of
Tintoretto’s fire. He devoted the lower floor of the albergo to Mary:
her humble surprise in the Annunciation, her modest grace in the
Visitation, her simple awe at the precious Oriental gifts in the
Adoration of the Magi, her slow procession on donkeyback across a
peaceful landscape in The Flight into Egypt, saf e from that “massacre
of the innocents” which provides the most powerful picture in this
group. On the walls of the main upper room Tintoretto recounted events
in the life of Christ: the baptism by John, the temptation by Satan, the
miracles, the Last Supper; this last was so unconventionally realistic
that Ruskin called it “the worst I know of Tintoretto”: 30 Christ at the
farther end, the Apostles absorbed in eating or conversing, servants
bustling about with food, a dog inquiring when he too may eat. In an
inner room of the upper story Tintoretto painted two of his greatest
paintings. Christ Before Pilate shows an unforgettable figure clad in a
white robe as if in a shroud, stand- ing quietly in weariness and
resignation, and yet in dignity, before a Pilate trying to wash away the
guilt of yielding to the bloodlust of a mob.</p>
<p>And last of all — judged by Tintoretto to be his best work — The
Cruci- fixion, challenging and surpassing Michelangelo’s Last Judgment
in power and range of composition, in artistry of execution; forty feet
of wall, and eighty figures, with horses, mountains, towers, trees, all
with incredible fidelity to detail; Christ in visualized agony of body
and soul; one robber being forced down upon a prostrate cross, and
resisting to the last; another, a Titan of strength and desperation,
being raised to his death by rough soldiers too angry at his weight to
have a mind for pity; women huddled in</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>673</p>
<p>terrified groups; spectators crowding eager to watch men suffer and
die; and, in the distance, a lowering sky offering no answer to the
human tragedy but thunder and lightning and an indifferent rain. Here
Tinto- retto has reached his zenith, and equaled the best.</p>
<p>To all these masterpieces in the alb ergo Tintoretto added eight
pictures for the church of the same Fraternity, chiefly concerning
St. Roch himself. One of these paintings stands out, if only through its
terribilitd — The Pool of Bethesda. The artist takes his text from the
fifth chapter of the Fourth Gospel: “a crowd of invalids used to lie”
there, “the blind, the lame, and folk with shriveled limbs,” waiting for
a chance to bathe in the healing pool. Tintoretto sees not the
miraculous healing of the cripple, but the variously diseased or
stricken multitude, and he draws them unflinchingly as he sees them, in
their malformations, their rags and filth, their hope and despair. It is
a scene as from Dante’s Inferno or Zola’s Lourdes.</p>
<p>The same man who could so rage, with his art, against the ills that
flesh is heir to, responded eagerly to the splendors of the flesh in the
beauty of its health, and almost rivaled Titian and Correggio in
portraying nudes. Though we might have expected his turbulent spirit and
swift brush to fail in conveying the ancient sense of beauty in repose,
we find, scattered over Europe, such delectable figures as the Danae of
the Lyons Museum, dressed in jewelry, the Leda and Swan of the Uffizi,
the Venus and Vulcan of the Munich Pinacothek, the Dresden Deliverance
of Arsinoe, the Mercury and Graces and Bacchus and Ariadne of the Doges’
Palace. . . . Symonds thought this last “if not the greatest, at any
rate the most beautiful, oil painting in existence .” 31 And yet more
perfect is the London Gallery’s Origin of the Milky Way from Cupid’s
pressure upon Juno’s breasts— as good an explanation as any. The Louvre,
the Prado, Vienna, and the Wash- ington Gallery have Susanna and the
Elders in four Tintoretto versions. The Prado has a roomful of sensuous
Tintorettos: A Young Venetian Woman drawing her robe aside to reveal her
bosom; even in the Battle of the Turks and Christians two distracting
breasts appear amid the gleam of arms. And in the Verona Museum is a
Concert of nine women musi- cians, three of them bare to the waist — as
if ears could hear when eyes had so much to see. These pictures are not
the best of Tintoretto; his forte was in the massive representation of
virile life and heroic death; but they show that he too, like Giorgione
and Titian, could turn a perilous curve with a steady hand. And in all
his nudes there is no immodesty; there is a healthy sensualism; these
gods and goddesses take nudity as natural, and are not conscious of it;
it is divine of them to greet the sun “all face,”</p>
<p>674 the renaissance (chap. XXII</p>
<p>whole-bodily, and not be harassed and jailed with buttons and laces
and bows.</p>
<p>After avoiding marriage for nearly forty years, Tintoretto took to
wife Faustina de’ Vescovi, who found him so disorder ly and helpless
that she achieved happiness in mothering him. She gave him eight
children, three of whom became pardonable painters. They lived in a
modest house not far from the church of Madonna dell’ Orto; and the
artist seldom wan - dered from that vicinity except to paint in a
Venetian church, palace, or fraternity; consequently he can be
appreciated in his variety and power only in the city of his birth. The
Duke of Mantua offered him a place at his court; he refused. He was
happy only in his studio, where he worked literally night and day. He
was a good husband and father, but cared nothing for the social
pleasures. He was almost as solitary, independent, moody, melancholy,
nervous, vehement, and proud as the Michelangelo whom he ever worshiped
and ever strove to surpass. There was no peace in his soul or his works.
Like Angelo, he honored strength of body and mind and spirit above
surface beauty; his Virgins are often as unprepossess- ing as the Doni
Madonna. He has left us his own portrait (now in the Louvre), painted
when he was seventy-two; it could have been the head and face of Angelo
himself — a strong and somber face, profound and wondering, and bearing
the marks of a hundred storms.</p>
<p>His own was his best portrait, but he painted some others that attest
the depth of his insight and the integrity of his art. For there too he
remained a realist, and no man dared sit for him who hoped to deceive
posterity. Many a Venetian worthy has come down to us through
Tintoretto’s</p>
<p>brush: doges, senators, procurators, three prove ditori of the mint,
six treasurers; above all, in this group, lacopo Soranzo — one of the
great por- traits in Venetian art; here too, are Sansovino the architect
and Cornaro the centenarian. Surpassed in Tintoretto ’s gallery of
portraits only by the Soranzo are anonymous pictures of The Man in a
Cuirass (Prado), the Portrait of an Old Man (Brescia), the Portrait of a
Man (Hermitage,</p>
<p>Leningrad) and A Moor in the Morgan Library in New York. In 1574</p>
<p>Tintoretto disguised himself as an attendant of Doge Alvise Mocenigo,
secured entry to the Venetian flagship Bucentaur, and clandestinely made
a pastel sketch of Henry III of France; later, in the corner of a
chamber where Henry gave audience to notables, Tintoretto perfected the
portrait. Henry liked it so much that he offered a knighthood to the
artist, who begged to be excused. 32</p>
<p>His acquaintance with the Venetian aristocracy had begun about
1556,</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP, xxn)</p>
<p>675</p>
<p>when, with Veronese, he received a commission to paint canvases in
the Ducal Palace. In the Sala del Maggior Consiglio he pictured The
Corona- tion of Frederick Barbarossa and Barbarossa Excommunicated by
Alex- ander 111 ; in the Sala del Scrutinio he covered an entire wall
with a Last Judgment. These so pleased the Senate that it chose him in
1572 to com- memorate the great victory at Lepanto. All four of these
paintings were destroyed in the fire of 1577. In 1574 the Senate engaged
Tintoretto to decorate the Anticollegio (or antechamber); here the
artist inspired the solons with Mercury and the Graces, Ariadne and
Bacchus, the Forge of Vulcan, and Mars Pursued by Minerva. In the Sala
de’ Pregadi or Senate</p>
<p>After the great fire the undiscourageable Senate called upon
Tintoretto to redeem the ruined walls with pictures that would drown all
memory of the loss. In the Hall of Scrutiny he painted a tremendous
battle scene, The Capture of Zara. On a wall of the Great Council
chamber he pictured the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa Receiving Envoys
from the Pope and the Doge, and on the ceiling a masterpiece, The Doge
Niccold da Ponte Re- ceiving the Homage of Conquered Cities.</p>
<p>When (1586) the Senate decided to cover the old fresco by Guariento
on the east wall of the Council Chamber, they judged Tintoretto, then
sixty-eight, to be too old for the task. They divided the assignment and
the space between Paolo Veronese, then fifty-eight, and Francesco Bas-
sano, thirty-seven. But Veronese died (1588) before the work was actu-
ally begun. Tintoretto offered to take his place, and proposed to cover
the entire wall with one picture, The Glory of Paradise. The Senate</p>
<p>agreed, and the old man, aided by his son Domenico and his daughter
Marietta, laid out in the near-by Scuola della Misericordia the canvas
sec- tions that were to compose the picture. Many preliminary sketches
were made; one, itself a chef-d’oeuvre, is in the Louvre. When all was
set in place (1590) and Domenico had painted and concealed the seams, it
con-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>676</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>stituted the largest oil painting that had yet been seen —
seventy-two feet long by twenty-three feet high. The crowds that flocked
to see it agreed with Ruskin that it was the culminating achievement of
Venetian paint- ing — “the most wonderful piece of pure, manly, and
masterl y oil painting in the world.” 33 The Senate offered Tintoretto
so great a fee that he re - turned part of it, again to the scandal of
his fellow artists.</p>
<p>Time has had its way with this Paradise, and today, when one enters
the Hall of the Great Council, and turns back to the wall behind the
doges’ throne, he does not find the picture that Tintoretto left there,
but a paint- ing so darkened by the smoke and damp of centuries that of
the five hun- dred figures that filled it only a minority can now be
made out distinctly by the eye. Circle within circle the figures vibrate
— the simple blessed, the virgins, the confessors of the faith, the
martyrs, the evangelists, the Apos- tles, the angels, the archangels —
all concentered about Mary and her Son, as if these two, in some fitting
recognition of woman as well as man, had become the real deities of
Latin Christendom. And beyond the hundred figures that can be seen,
Tintoretto makes us feel countless hundreds more. After all, even if
only a few are chosen of the many called, there must have come to
paradise, in sixteen Christian centuries, quite a happy host; and
Tintoretto set himself to show their goodly number and their bliss. He
did not deaden heaven with Dantesque solemnity; it was conceived as a
place of joy, and only the radiantly happy were admitted there. It was
the old artist’s exorcism of his own misanthropy.</p>
<p>He had reason to be sad, for in the very year of the great picture’s
un - veiling his beloved daughter Marietta had died. Her skill in
painting and music had been among the chief delights of his old age; and
now that she was gone he seemed to think of nothing so much as of seeing
her in another life. He went more frequently than before to Madonna
dell’ Orto— Our Lady of the Garden — and there spent hours in meditation
and prayer, at last a humble man. He still painted, and produced in
these concluding years a series on St. Catherine for the church of her
name. But in his seventy-seventh year a stomach ailment gave him such
pain that he could no longer sleep. He made his will, bade good-bye to
his wife and children and friends, and died on May 31, 1594. Madonna
dell’ Orto received his remains.</p>
<p>If, after boating through Venice to stand face to face in every comer
of the city with this Michelangelo of the lagoons, we try to clear our
con- ception of his art, the first impression is one of size and
multitude, of enormous walls pullulating with human and animal forms, in
a thousand</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>6 77</p>
<p>degrees of beauty or ugliness, in a carnal confusion that has only
this ex- cuse, that it is life. This man who shunned and hated crowds
saw them everywhere, and reproduced them with fierce veracity. He seems
to have taken little interest in individuals; if he painted portraits it
was frankly to earn a fee. He saw humanity in the gross, interpreted
life and history in terms of masses of human beings struggling,
competing, loving, enjoying, suffering; virile and comely, diseased and
crippled, saved or damned. He covered canvases of awesome immensity,
because only such expanses gave him scope to picture what he saw. While
never completely mastering, as Titian did, the technique of pictorial
art, he worked out for himself the method of these gigantic paintings,
and to him above all is due the grandeur of the rooms in the Palace of
the Doges. Therefore we must not ask of him any finesse of finishing. He
is crude, rough, hurried, and sometimes creates a scene with a splash of
the brush. His real fault is not this coarseness of surface — for even a
coarse surface may illuminate significance — but the theatrical violence
of the episodes he chooses, the unhealthy turbulence of his moods, the
gloom in which he bathes the life he shows, and the tiresome repetition
of his crowds; he was infatuated with number, as Michelangelo with forms
and Rubens with flesh. And yet even in these multitudes what a wealth of
meaningful detail, what accuracy and insight of observation, what
inexhaustible individualization of the parts, what courageous realism
where before there had only been imagination and sentiment!</p>
<p>Our final feeling in the presence of these pictures is one of
affirmative response: this is art in the grand style. Other artists have
painted beauty, like Raphael, or strength, like Michelangelo, or the
depths of the soul, like Rembrandt; but here in these cosmic canvases —
as in the roar of a city, or in mute masses at prayer, or in the
troubled and affectionate intimacies of a thousand homes — is humanity.
No other artist has ever seen it so large or pictured it so completely.
Sometimes, silent before those fading walls in the Palace of the Doges
or in the Confraternity of St. Roch, the canvases of better artists fall
from our memory, and we feel that if he could have finished like a
jeweler after so conceiving like a giant, the little dyer would have
been the greatest painter of them all.</p>
<p>V. VERONESE: 1528-88</p>
<p>Let us honor, in passing, some stars of the second magnitude; they
too were part of the luminosity of Venice. Andrea Meldola was a
Slavonian, and received the name Schiavone. He studied with Titian, and
made a</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>678</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>pretty Galatea on a chest in the Castello of Milan. In a Jupiter and
Antiope (Leningrad) and a Presentation of the Virgin (Venice) he essayed
a larger form, and produced canvases of brilliant coloring. Artists
praised him, patrons ignored him, and Andrea had to carry his bearded
dignity in rags. — Paris Bordone was the son of a saddler and the
grandson of a shoemaker; but in the admirable democracy of genius —
which appears in every rank — he made his way almost to the top in a
Venice teeming with talent. Com- ing from Treviso to study under Titian,
he matured so rapidly that at the age of thirty-eight he was invited to
Paris by Francis I. He turned out some excellent religious pictures,
like The Baptism of Christ (Washing- ton) and The Holy Family (Milan),
and reached his high point in The</p>
<p>Fisherman Presenting St. Mark’s Ring to the Doge (Venice); but
the</p>
<p>painting that has ferried him over the years is his Venus and Eros
(Uffizi) — a stout blonde who uses a fine robe to reveal her breasts,
while Cupid clamors for her attention.* — Iacopo da Ponte, called il
Bassano from his birthplace, reached a modest fame and fortune when
Titian bought his Animals Going into the Ark; he painted some good
portraits — e.g., The Bearded Man (Chicago) — and managed to live to the
age of eighty-two without leaving behind him any pictured humans not
clothed from head to foot.</p>
<p>About 1553 there came from Verona to Venice a youth of twenty-five,
Paolo Caliari, of a type contrasting sharply with Tintoretto: tranquil,
friendly, sociable, self-critical, and only occasionally passionate.
Like Tintoretto and nearly all educated Italians, he loved and practised
music. He was generous and honorable, never offended a rival, never
disappointed a patron. Venice called him il Veronese, and so the world
knows him, though he adopted Venice as his home and one of his loves. He
had many teachers in Verona, including his uncle Antonio Badile, who
later gave him a daughter to wife; he was influenced by Giovanni Caroto
and Brusasorci; but these factors in the development of his style soon
faded in the warm brilliance of Venetian art and life. He never ceased
to wonder at the changing skies playing their colors upon the Grand
Canal; he marveled at the palaces and their tremulous reflections in the
sea; he envied the aristo- cratic world of secure incomes, and artistic
friendships, and gracious man- ners, and garments of silk and velvet
almost more tempting to the touch than the beautiful women they
enclosed. He wished himself an aristocrat; he dressed like one in lace
and furs, and imitated the high code of honor</p>

<p>that he ascribed to the Venetian upper class. He hardly ever painted
poor people, or poverty, or tragedy; his aim was to put this bright and
fortunate world of the Venetian rich upon immortal canvas, and make it
fairer and finer than wealth without art could ever be. The lords and
ladies, the bishops and abbots, the doges and senators, took to him
fondly; and soon he was working on a dozen commissions.</p>
<p>As early as 1553, when he was only twenty-five, he was asked to paint
a ceiling for the Council of Ten in the Ducal Palace. There, likening
the Council to Jove, he pictured Jupiter Overthrowing the Vices, now in
the Louvre. It was not especially successful; the heavy figures cavorted
pre- cariously in the air; Paolo had not quite caught the spirit of
Venice. But two years later he found himself, and touched mastery, in
painting The Triumph of Mordecai on the ceiling of San Sebastiano; the
face and figure of the Jewish hero were forcefully rendered, and the
horses breathe reality. Titian himself may have been impressed, for when
the Procurators of St. Mark’s charged him to organize the decoration of
the Libreria Vecchia</p>
<p>Having acquired high repute for decorative painting, Paolo now
re-</p>
<p>ceived a lucrative assignment. The rich and lordly Barbaro family
built in 1560 a luxurious villa at Macer, near that same Asolo where
Caterina Cornaro played queen and Bembo played with Platonic love. The
Barbari chose none but leading artists to make this “the finest pleasure
house of the Renaissance”: 35 Andrea Palladio to design it, Alessandro
Vittoria to orna - ment it with sculptured stucco, Veronese to fresco
the ceilings and walls, spandrels and lunettes with scenes from pagan
and Christian mythology. On the vault of the central dome he pictured
Olympus — the gods who knew all the joys of life but never grew old and
never died. Amid ethereal scenes the impish artist introduced a hunter,
a monkey, and a dog so per- fect in its form and alert vitality as to be
fit to be a hound of heaven. On one wall a painted page looked across a
distance at a painted maid, and she at him, and for an immortal moment
they too fed on ambrosia. It was such a pleasure palace as only the more
refined taste of Kublai Khan’s Chinese could have surpassed.</p>

<p>Inevitably, in this archipelago of Eros, Paolo received commissions
to paint nudes. They were not his forte; he preferred rich, soft raiment
covering semi-Rubensian forms topped with comely characterless faces
crowned with upswept coiffures of golden hair. The Mars and Venus now in
the Metropolitan Museum of Art shows a fat and ungainly goddess with an
unshapely dropsical leg. But she is lovely in the Venus and Adonis of
the Prado, outshone only by the dog at her feet; without a dog Paolo
could not paint. The finest of Veronese’s mythologies is The Rape of
Europa in the Palace of the Doges: a landscape of dark trees, winged
putti dropping garlands, Europa (the Phoenician princess) seating
herself gaily upon the amorous bull, who licks one of her pretty feet,
and turns out to be none other than Jupiter in a novel masquerade. The
lucky Casanova of the skies here showed divine taste, for Europa, half
robed in queenly array, is Veronese’s most successful synthesis of
feminine perfection, worth leaving heaven for. The distant background
continues the story by showing the bull carrying Europa across the Sea
to Crete, where, says a pretty legend, she gave her name to a
continent.</p>
<p>Paolo himself took his time before surrendering to woman. He gathered
samples till he was thirty-eight; then he married Elena Badile. She bore
him two sons, Carlo and Gabriele; he trained both to be painters, and
pre- dicted, with more fondness than foresight, Carletto mi vine era — 1
“Charlie will surpass me.” 36 Like Correggio he bought a farm— at Sant’
Angelo di Treviso — and spent most of his married years there, managing
his finances thriftily, and seldom straying from the Veneto. He was at
forty (1568) the most sought-for painter in Italy, with invitations
coming even from foreign lands. When Philip II asked him to decorate the
Escorial he ap- preciated the compliment, but resisted the lure.</p>
<p>Like his predecessors he was called upon to paint the sacred story
for churches and worshipers.* After a thousand Madonnas we find

<p>thing fresh and attractive in the Madonna of the Cuccino Family
(Dres- den): the handsome black-bearded donors, the disconcertingly
natural children, and the white-shawled figure of fate — a woman of such
majestic beauty as even Venetian art seldom equaled. The Marriage at
Cana</p>
<p>(Louvre) was just the scene that Veronese liked to paint: Roman
archi- tecture for a background, a dog or two in the foreground, and a
hundred persons in a hundred attitudes. He drew them all as if everyone
were to be a major portrait, and placed among them Titian, Tintoretto,
Bassano, and himself, each playing a stringed instrument. Paolo, unlike
Tintoretto, cared nothing for realism; instead of making his feasters
such men and women as a small Judean town might furnish, he made the
host a Venetian millionaire, gave him a palace worthy of Augustus, and
guests and dogs of pedigree, and provided the tables with delicate food
and miraculous wine. If one should judge from Veronese, Christ had many
a feast amid His tribulations: in the Louvre we see Him dining in the
house of Simon the Pharisee, with Magdalen washing His feet, and
splendid female figures mov- ing about among Corinthian columns; in
Turin He sups in the house of Simon the leper, and in the Venice Academy
He dines in the house of Levi. But then, again, in Veronese’s gallery,
we see Christ fainting under the weight of the cross (Dresden), and
crucified against a lowering sky, with the towers of Jerusalem dim in
the distance below (Louvre). The end of the great drama is subdued:
simple pilgrims supping with Christ at Em- maus, with charming children
fondling the inevitable dog.</p>
<p>Greater than these illustrations of the New Testament are Veronese’s
pictures from the lives and legends of the saints: St. Helena robed in
beauty, believing that she sees angels transporting the cross (London);
St. Anthony tortured by a muscular youth and an angelic female (Caen);
St. Jerome in the wilderness, comforted by his books (Chicago);
St. George ecstatically welcoming martyrdom (San Giorgio, Venice);
St. Anthony of Padua preaching to the fishes (Borghese) — a magnificent
vista of sea and sky; St. Francis receiving the stigmata (Venice);
St. Mennas brilliant in armor (Modena) and martyred (Prado);
St. Catherine of Alexandria</p>
<p>mystically married to the infant Christ (Santa Caterina, Venice);
St. Se- bastian flying the standard of faith and hope as he is led to
martyrdom (San Sebastiano, Venice); St. Justina facing martyrdom with
double</p>
<p>jeopardy — in the Uffizi and in her church at Padua: all these are
pictures not to be compared with the best of Titian or Tintoretto, but
still meriting the name of masterpieces. Perhaps finer than any of these
is The Family of Darius Before Alexander (London), with a somber queen
and a lovely</p>
<p>682 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>princess kneeling at the feet of the handsome and generous
conqueror.</p>
<p>As Paolo had begun his Venetian career with painting in the Ducal</p>
<p>Palace, so he ended it with grand murals there, fit to thrill every
patriotic Venetian soul. After the fires of 1574 and 1577, the
decoration of the re- built interiors was assigned chiefly to Tintoretto
and Veronese, and the theme was to be Venice herself, undaunted by fire
or war, Turks or Portu- guese. In the Sala del Collegio (Audience
Chamber) Paolo and his as- sistants painted on the carved and gilded
ceiling eleven allegorical pictures of extraordinary elegance — Meekness
with her lamb . . . Dialectics looking through a web of her own making .
. . and Venice, a queen in ermine, with the Lion of St. Mark lying
quietly at her feet, and receiving honors from Justice and Peace. In a
great oval in the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio he painted
The Triumph of Venice, picturing the incomparable city as a goddess
enthroned among pagan deities, receiving a crown of glory from the sky;
at her feet the leading lords and ladies of the city, and some tributary
Moors; and below these, prancing warriors ready for her defense, and
pages holding hounds in leash. This was the zenith of Vero- nese.</p>
<p>In 1586 he was chosen to replace Guariento’s faded fresco, The Corona
- tion of the Virgin, in that same Hall of the Great Council. His sketch
was made and approved, and he was preparing to paint the canvas when he
was stricken with fever. Venice was shocked to learn, in April 1588,
that the still young painter of her glories was dead. The fathers at San
Sebas- tiano begged for his remains, and Paolo was buried there, beneath
the pic- tures by which he had made that church a home of his religious
art.</p>
<p>Time has reversed the judgment of his contemporaries, and ranks him
below his robust contemporary. Technically he surpassed Tintoretto; in
draftsmanship, composition, and color he was the culmination of Venetian
painting. His crowded pictures are not confused; his scenes and episodes
are clear, his backgrounds bright; Tintoretto seems a prince of darkness
beside this idolater of light. Veronese was also the greatest decorative
painter of the Italian Renaissance, ever ready to conceive some
delightful turn or surprise of color and form, like the man suddenly
stepping out from behind a curtain half drawn across a classic portal in
a fresco at the Villa Macer. But he was too joyously intent upoii
surface melodies to hear the subtle overtones, tragic discords, and
deeper harmonies that make the greatest paintings great. His eye was too
quick, his art too eager to picture all that it saw, and more that it
merely imagined — Turks at the baptism of Christ, Teutons in the house
of Levi, Venetians at Emmaus,</p>
<p>SUNSET IN VENICE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>683</p>
<p>dogs everywhere. He must have loved dogs, he made so many of them. He
wanted to portray the brightest aspects of the world, and did so with
unmatched radiance; he pictured Venice in a sunset glow of the joy of
life. In his world there are only handsome nobles, stately matrons, be-
witching princesses, voluptuous blondes; and every second picture is a
feast.</p>
<p>All the art world knows the story how the officers of the
Inquisition- pursuant to a decree of the Council of Trent that all
erroneous teaching must be avoided in art — summoned Veronese before
them (1573), and de- manded to know why he had introduced so many
irreverent irrelevancies into The Feast in the House of Levi (Venice) —
parrots, dwarfs, Germans, buffoons, halberdiers. . . . Paolo replied
boldly that his “commission was to ornament the picture as seemed good
to me. It was big, and with room for many figures. . . . Whenever an
empty space in a picture needs filling up, I put in figures as the fancy
takes me”— partly to balance the composi- tion, and also, doubtless, to
feast the observant eye. The Inquisition or- dered him to amend the
painting at his own cost, which he did. 37 That in- quest marked the
passage, in Venetian art, from the Renaissance to the Counter
Reformation.</p>
<p>Veronese had no distinguished disciples, but his influence overleaped
generations to share in molding the art of Italy, Flanders, and France.
Tiepolo recaptured his decorative flair after a long intermission;
Rubens studied him carefully, learned the secrets of Paolo’s coloring,
and inflated Veronese’s plump females to Flemish amplitude. Nicolas
Poussin and Claude Lorrain found in him a guide to the use of
architectural ornament in their landscapes, and Charles Lebrun followed
Veronese in designing vast murals. To Veronese and Correggio the
painters of eighteenth-cen- tury France looked for inspiration in their
idyls of fetes champetres and aristocratic lovers playing at Arcadia;
here stemmed Watteau and Frago- nard; here rose the rosy nudes of
Boucher, the gracious children and women conceived by Greuze. Here,
perhaps, Turner found something of the sunshine with which he
illuminated London.</p>
<p>So, in Veronese’s blaze of color, ended the Golden Age of the
Adriatic Queen. Art could hardly go further in the direction that it had
followed from Giorgione to Veronese. Technical perfection had been
reached; the heights had been scaled; now there would be a slow descent
until, in the eighteenth century, Tiepolo would rival Veronese in
decorative painting, and Goldoni would be the Aristophanes of Venice in
a last burst of splendor before the republic’s death.</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>PERSPECTIVE</li>
</ol>
<p>As we look back across the heyday of Venetian art, and diffidently
seek to assess its role in our heritage, we may say at once that only
Florence and Rome rivaled it in excellence, splendor, and scope. It is
true that the Vene- tian painters, even Titian, probed less deeply than
the Florentines into the secret hopes and feelings, the despairs and
tragedies of men, that often they loved the raiment and the flesh too
keenly to reach the soul. Ruskin was right: after the Bellini, and
excepting Lotto, real religion fades from Venetian art. 38 The Venetians
could not help it if the collapse of the Crusades, the triumph and
spread of Islam, the deterioration of the papacy at Avignon and in the
Papal Schism, the secularization of the papacy under Sixtus IV and
Alexander VI, and finally the secession of Germany and England from the
Roman Church, had weakened the faith even of the faithful, and had left
many vigorous spirits no better philosophy than to eat and drink and
mate and disappear. But never elsewhere had Christian art and pagan art
lived in such contented harmony. The same brush that painted a Virgin
painted a Venus next, and no one effectively complained. Nor was it a
sybaritic art or life of luxury and ease; the artists worked themselves
to exhaustion, and the people whom they portrayed were often men who
fought battles and governed states, or women who ruled such men.</p>
<p>The Venetian painters were too enamored of color to match the careful
draftsmanship of the Florentine masters. But they were good drafts- men
none the less. A Frenchman once said that Fete c’est un coloriste,
Fhiver c’est un dessinateur— ’summer is a colorist, winter is a
designer”; 38 the leafless trees reveal pure line. But those lines are
still there under the green o f spring, the brown of summer, and
autumn’s gold. Beneath the glory of color in Giorgione, Titian,
Tintoretto, and Veronese there is line, but it is absorbed by the color,
as the structural form of a symphony is concealed by its flow.</p>
<p>Venetian art and literature sang the glory of Venice even as her</p>
<p>economy sank to ruin in a Mediterranean dominated at one end by the
Turks and deserted at the other by a Europe seeking American gold. And
perhaps the artists and poets were justified. No vicissitudes of trade
or war could extinguish the proud memory of a marvelous century — 1480-
1580 — during which the Mocenigo and Priuli and Loredani had made and
saved imperial Venice, and the Lombardi and Leopardi had adorned her
with statuary, and Sansovino and Palladio had crowned her waters
with</p>

<p>churches and palaces, and the Bellini and Giorgione and Titian and
Tinto- retto and Veronese had lifted her to the art leadership of Italy,
and Bembo had sung impeccable songs, and Manutius had poured forth, to
all who cared, the literary heritage of Greece and Rome, and the
irredeemable, ir- repressible, Mephistophelean Scourge of Princes had
sat enthroned on the Grand Canal, judging and milking the world.</p>
