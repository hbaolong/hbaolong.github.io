<h4 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h4>
<p>Before Agamemnon</p>
<p>I. SCHLIEMANN</p>
<p>I N the year 1822 a lad was born in Germany who was to turn the
spade- work of archeology into one of the romances of the century. His
father had a passion for ancient history, and brought him up on Homer’s
stories of the siege of Troy and Odysseus’ wanderings. “With great grief
I heard from him that Troy had been so completely destroyed that it had
disap- peared without leaving any trace of its existence.’” At the age
of eight, having given the matter mature consideration, Heinrich
Schliemann an- nounced his intention to devote his life to the
rediscovery of the lost city. At the age of ten he presented to his
father a Latin essay on the Trojan War. In 1836 he left school with an
education too advanced for his means, and became a grocer’s apprentice.
In 1841 he shipped from Hamburg as cabin boy on a steamer bound for
South America. Twelve days out the vessel foundered; the crew was tossed
about in a small boat for nine hours, and was thrown by the tide upon
the shores of Holland. Heinrich became a clerk, and earned a hundred and
fifty dollars a year; he spent half of this on books, and lived on the
other half and his dreams.’ His intelligence and application had their
natural results; at twenty-five he was an independent merchant with
interests on three continents; at thirty-six he felt that he had enough
money, retired from commerce, and gave all his time to archeology. “In
the midst of the bustle of business I had never forgotten Troy, or
the</p>
<p>In his travels as a merchant he had made it a practice to learn the
language of each country he traded with, and to write in that language
the current pages of his diary.* By this method he learned English,
French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Swedish, Polish,
and Arabic. Now he went to Greece, studied the language as a living
speech, and was soon</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>CHAP.n) BEFORE AGAMEMNON 25</p>
<p>able to read both ancient and modem Greek as fluently as German.*
Henceforth, he declared, “I should find it impossible to live anywhere
but on classical soil.’” Since his Russian wife refused to leave Russia,
he adver - tised for a Greek wife, laid down precise specifications for
the position, and at the age of forty-seven chose a bride of nineteen
from among the photo- graphs he received. He married her almost at
sight, and unwittingly in the ancient style of purchase; her parents
charged him for her a price com- mensurate with their conception of his
fortune. When his new wife bore him children he reluctantly consented to
baptize them, but solemnized the ceremony by laying a copy of the Iliad
upon their heads and reading a hundred hexameters aloud. He named them
Andromache and Agamemnon, called his servants Telamon and Pelops, and
christened his Athenian home Bellerophon.’ He was an old man mad about
Homer.</p>
<p>In 1870 he went to the Troad — the northwest comer of Asia Minor —
and made up his mind, against all current scholarly opinion, that
Priam’s Troy lay buried under the hill called Hissarlik. After a year of
negotiations he secured permission from the Turkish Government to
explore the site; he engaged eighty laborers, and set to work. His wife,
who loved him for his eccentricities, shared his toil in the earth from
sunrise to sunset. All winter long an icy gale from the north drove a
blinding dust into their eyes, and swept with such violence through the
cracks of their frail cottage that no lamp could be kept lit in the
evening. Despite the fire in the hearth the water froze nearly every
night. “We had nothing to keep us warm except our enthusiasm for the
great work of discovering Troy.”®</p>
<p>A year passed before they were rewarded. Then, blow by blow, a work-
man’s pick exposed a large copper ves sel, and this, opened, revealed an
astonishing treasure of some nine thousand objects in silver and gold.
The canny Schliemann hid the find in his wife’s shawl, dismissed his
workmen to an unexpected siesta, hurried to his hut, locked the door,
spread out the precious things on the table, linked each one fondly with
some passage in</p>
<p>• **In order to acquire quickly the Greek vocabulary,” Schliemann
writes, “I procured a</p>
<p>modern Greek translation of Faul et Virginie, and read it through,
comparing every word witji its equivalent in the French original. When I
had finished this task I knew at least one half the Greek words the book
contained; and after repeating the operation I knew them all, or nearly
so, without having lost a single minute by being obliged to use a
dictionary. . . . Of the Greek grammar I learned only the declensions
and the verbs, and never lost my precious time in studying its rules;
for as I saw that boys, after being troubled and tormented for eight
years and more in school with the tedious rules of grammar, can
nevertheless none of them write a letter in ancient Greek without making
hundreds of atrocious blunders, I thought the method pursued by the
schoolmasters must be altogether wrong. • • . I learned ancient Greek as
I would have learned a living language.”®</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(CHAP.n</p>
<p>Homer, adorned his wife with an ancient diadem, and sent messages to
his friends in Europe that he had unearthed “the Treasury of Priam.”* No
one would believe him; some critics charged him with having placed the
objects where he found them; and at the same time the Sublime Porte sued
him for taking gold from Turkish soil. But scholars like Virchow,
Dorpfeld, and Bumouf came to the site, verified Schliemann’s reports, an
d carried on the work with him until one buried Troy after another was
uncovered, and the problem was no longer whether Troy had existed, but
which of the nine Troys exhumed had been the Ilios of the Iliad.</p>
<p>In 1876 Schhemann resolved to confirm the epic from another direction
— to show that Agamemnon too was real. Guided by Pausanias’ classic de -
scription of Greece,* he sank thirty-four shafts at Mycenae in the
eastern Peloponnesus. Turkish officials interrupted the work by claiming
half of the material that he had found at Troy. Unwilling to let the
precious “Treasury of Priam” lie unseen in Turkey, Schliemaim
clandestinely dis - patched the objects to the State Museum at Berlin,
paid the Porte five times more damages than were required of him, and
resumed his digging at Mycenae. Again he was rewarded; and when he saw
his workers carrying up to him skeletons, pottery, jewelry, and golden
masks, he telegraphed joyfully to the King of Greece that he had
discovered the tombs of Atreus and Agamemn on.” In 1884 he moved on to
Tiryns and, guided again by Pausanias, unearthed the great palace and
cyclopean walls that Homer had described.”</p>
<p>Seldom had any man done so much for archeology. He had the faults of
his virtues, for his enthusiasm drove him into a reckless haste that de-
stroyed or confused many exhumed objects in order to reach at once the
goal that he sought; and the epics that had inspired his labors misled
him into thinking that he had discovered Priam’s hoard at Troy, and the
tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae. The world of scholarship doubted his
reports, and the museums of England, Russia, and France long refused to
accept as genuine the rehcs that he had found. He consoled himself with
vigorous self-appreciation, and went on digging courageously until
disease struck him down. In his last days he hesitated whether to pray
to the God of Christianity or to the Zeus of classic Greece. “To
Agamemnon Schliemann, best beloved of sons, greeting!” he writes. “I am
very glad that you are going to study Plutarch, and have finished
Xenophon … I pray Zeus the Father and Pallas Athene that they will grant
you a hundred returns of the</p>
<ul>
<li>Pausanias traveled through Greece about aj&gt;. i6o, and described
it in his Periegesis^ of Tour.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.n) BEFORE AGAMEMNON 27</p>
<p>day in health and happiness.”” He died in 1890, worn out by climatic
hardships, scholastic hostility, and the incessant fever of his
dream.</p>
<p>Like Columbus he had discovered a world stranger than the one he</p>
<p>sought. These jewels were older by many centuries than Priam and</p>
<p>Hecuba; these graves were not the tombs of the Atridae, but the ruins
of an Aegean civilization, on the Greek mainland, as ancient as the
Minoan Age in Crete. Unknowingly Schliemann had proved Horace’s famous
line — vixerunt fortes ante Agamemnona — Witte, lived many brave men
before Agamemnon.”* Year by year, as Dorpfeld and Muller, Tsountas
and</p>
<p>Stamatakis, Waldstein and Wace dug more widely into the Pelopoimesus,
and still others explored Attica and the islands, Euboea and Boeotia,
Phocis and Thessaly, the soil of Greece gave up the ghostly relics of a
culture before history. Here too men had been lifted from barbarism to
civilization by the passage from nomadic hunting to settled agriculture,
by the replace- ment of stone tools with copper and bronze, by the
conveniences of writ- ing and the stimulus of trade; Civilization is
always older than we think; and under whatever sod we tread are the
bones of men and women who also worked and loved, wrote songs and made
beautiful things, but whose names and very being have been lost in the
careless flow of time.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>IN THE PALACES OF THE KINGS</li>
</ol>
<p>On a long low hill five miles east of Argos and a mile north of the
sea, stood, in the fourteenth century before our era, the
fortress-palace of Tiryns. Today one reaches its ruins by a pleasant
ride from Argos or</p>
<p>Nauplia, and finds them half lost amid quiet fields of com and wheat.
Then, after a little climb up prehistoric stone steps, the traveler
stands before the Cyclopean walls built, said Greek tradition, for the
Argive prince Proetus, two centuries before the Trojan War.f Even then
the town itself was old.</p>
<p>• Towards the end bf his life Dorpfeld and Virchow almost convinced
him that he had found the remains not of Agamemnon but of a far earlier
generation. After many heartaches Schliemann took the matter good-
naturedly. “What?” he exclaimed, “so this is not Agamem - non’s body,
these are not his ornaments? All right, let’s call him Schulze”; and
thereaf ter they always spoke of “Schulze.”“</p>
<p>t The Greeks gave the name Cyclopean to such structures as in their
mythical fancy could have been built only by giants like the one-eyed
Titans called Cyclopes (Round-Eyes), who labored at the forges of
Hephaestus in the volcanoes of the Mediterranean. Architecturally the
term implied large unmortared stones, unhewn or roughly cut, and filled
in at the joints with pebbles laid in clay. Tradition added that Proetus
had imported celebrated masons, called Cyclopes, from Lycia.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(CHAP.n</p>
<p>having been founded, said ancient memory, by the hero Tiryns, son of
Argus of the hundred eyes, in the infancy of the world.“ Proteus, the
story went on, gave the palace to Perseus, who ruled Tiryns with the
dusl^ Andromeda as his queen.</p>
<p>The walls that protected the citadel rose from, twenty-five to fifty
feet in height, and were so thick that at several places they contained
spacious galleries, vaulted and arched with immense overlapping
horizontal slabs. Many of the stones still in place measure six feet in
length by three in breadth and depth; the smallest of them, said
Pausanias, “could hardly be moved by a pair of mules.”“ Within the
walls, behind a propylon or gate - way that set a style for many an
acropolis, lay a broad paved court bounded with colonnades; and around
this, as at Cnossus, was a medley of rooms gathered about the megaton —
a hall of state thirteen hundred square feet in area, with a pavement of
painted cement, and a ceiling supported by four columns enclosing a
hearth. Here, in contrast to merry Crete, was estab- lished a lasting
principle of Greek architecture — the separation of the women’s
quarters, or gynaeceum, from the chambers of the men. The king’s room
and the queen’s room were built side by side, but, so far as the</p>
<p>Ten miles farther north, perhaps in the fourteenth century before
Christ, Perseus (if we wish to believe Pausanias”) built Mycenae— the
greatest capital of prehistoric Greece. Here too, around a forbidding
citadel, a town of several villages grew, housing a busy population of
peasants, mer- chants, artisans, and slaves, who had the happiness of
eluding history. Six hundred years later Homer called Mycenae “a well
-built city, broad- avenued and a bounding in gold.”” Despite a hundred
despoiling genera - tions some parts of these also cyclopean walls
survive, to attest the imme- morial cheapness of labor and uneasiness of
kings. In a comer of the wall is the famous Lion Gate, where, carved
upon a stone triangle over a massive lintel, two royal beasts, now worn
and headless, dumbly stand guard over a grandeur that is gone. On the
acropolis beyond are the ruins of the palace. Again, as at Tiryns and
Cnossus, we can trace the divisions of throne room, altar room,
storerooms, bathroom, and reception rooms. Here once CHAP.n) BEFORE
AGAMEMNON Z9</p>
<p>were painted floors, columned porticoes, frescoed walls, and majestic
flights of stairs.</p>
<p>Near the Lion Gate, in a narrow area enclosed by a ring of erect
stone slabs, Schliemann’s workers dug up nineteen skeletons, and relics
so rich that one could forgive the great amateur for seeing in these
shafts the burial chambers of the children of Atreus. Had not Pausanias
described the royal graves as “in the ruins of Mycenae”?“ Here were male
skulls with crowns of gold, and golden masks on the bones of the face;
here were osseous ladies with golden diadems on what had been their
heads; here were painted vases, bronze caldrons, a silver rhyton, beads
of amber and amethyst, objects of alabaster, ivory, or faience, heavily
ornamented daggers and swords, a gam- ing board like that at Cnossus,
and almost anything in gold — seals and rings, pins and studs, cups and
beads, bracelets and breastplates, vessels of toilette, even clothing
embroidered with thin plates of gold.“ These were assuredly royal
jewels, royal bones.</p>
<p>In the hillside opposite the acropolis Schliemann and others
discovered nine tombs altogether (jifferent from these “shaft graves.”
Leavin g the road that comes down from the citadel, one enters at the
right a corridor lined with walls of large, well-cut stones. At the end
is a plain portal, once adorned v/ith slim cylindrical columns of green
marble, now in the British Museum; above it is a simple lintel of two
stones, one extending thirty feet and weighing 1 1 3 tons. Within, the
traveler finds himself under a dome, or tholos, fifty feet high and as
many wide; the walls are built of sawn blocks Reinforced with decorative
bronze rosettes; each stratum of stones overlaps the one beneath, until
the uppermost layer closes the top. This strange structure, Schliemann
thought, was the tomb of Agamemnon, and a smaller tholos near by,
discovered by his wife, was at once described as the tomb of
Clytaemnestra. All the “beehive” tombs at Mycenae were found empty;
thieves had anticipated the archeologists by several centuries.</p>
<p>These gloomy ruins are the reminders of a civilization as ancient
to</p>
<p>Pericles as Charlemagne to ourselves. Current opinion dates the shaft
graves near to 1600 b.c. (some four hundred years before the traditional
age of Agamemnon), and the beehive tombs about 1450; but prehistoric
chronol- ogy is not a precision tool. We do not know how this
civilization began, nor what people it was that built towns not only at
Mycenae and Tiryns but at Sparta, Amyclae, Aegina, Eleusis, Chaeronea,
Orchomenos, and Delphi. Probably, like most nations, it was already
composite in stock and heritage; Greece was as diverse in blood before
the Dorian invasion (1100 B.C.) as England before the Norman Conquest.
So far as we can guess, the</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>(chap, h</p>
<p>Mycenaeans were akin to the Phrygians and Carians of Asia Minor, and
to the Minoans of Crete.® The lions of Mycenae have a Mesopotamian coun-
tenance; this ancient motif probably came through Assyria and Phrygia to
Greece.®* Greek tradition called the Mycenaeans “Pelasgi” (possibly mean
- ing People of the Sea — pelagos), and pictured them as coming down
from Thrace and Thessaly into Attica and the Peloponnesus in a past so
distant that the Greeks termed them aborigines. Herodotus ac-</p>
<p>cepted this account, and ascribed the Olympian gods to a Pelasgic
origin, but he “could not say with any certainty what the language of
the Pelasgi was.”“ No more can we.</p>
<p>Doubtless these autochthonoi were themselves late-comers into a land
that had suffered cultivation since neohthic days; there are no
aborigines. In their turn they too were overrun; for in the later years
of Mycenaean his- tory, towards 1600, we find many indications of a
cultural-commercial, if not a military-political, conquest of the
Peloponnesus by the products or emigrants of Crete.® The palaces at
Tiryns and Mycenae, except for the gynaeceum, were designed and
decorated in the Minoan manner; Cretan vases and styles reached into
Aegina, Chalcis, and Thebes; Mycenaean ladies and goddesses adopted the
charming fashions of Crete, and the art revealed in the later shaft
graves is unmistakably Minoan.® Apparently it was this stimulating
contact with a higher culture that lifted Mycenae to the peak of its
civilization.</p>
<p>ra. MYCENAEAN CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>The remains of this culture are too fragmentary to give us a picture
as dis- tinct as those that take form in the ruins of Crete or the
poetry of Homer. Life on the mainland was a little nearer to the hunting
stage than in Crete. The bones of deer, wild boars, goats, sheep, hares,
oxen, and pigs among the Mycenaean leavings — not to speak of fishbones
and marine shells — indicate an appetite al- ready Homeric, and
unfriendly to the Cretan waist. Here and there the relics reveal the
strange contemporaneity of “ancient” and “modem” modes— obsidian
arrowheads lying beside a hollow bronze drill apparently used in boring
dowel holes into stones.®</p>
<p>Industry was less advanced than in Crete; there are no signs on the
mainland of such industrial centers as Goumia. Trade grew slowly, for
the seas were troubled with pirates, including the Mycenaeans; the kings
of Mycenae and Tiryns had Cretan artists engrave for them, on their
vases and rings, a proud record of their achievements in piracy.® To
protect themselves against other</p>
<p>CHAP.n) BEFORE AGAMEMNON 3I</p>
<p>pirates they built their cities inland, far enough from the sea to
guard against sudden attack, close enough to take readily to their
ships. Lying on the road from the Argolic Gulf to the Isthmus of
Corinth, Tiryns and Mycenae were well situated both to plunder traders
with feudal tolls, and to set out occasion- ally on buccaneering raids.
Seeing Crete grow rich on orderly trade, Mycenae learned that piracy —
like its civilked o£Fspring, tariff dues — can strangle com- merce and
internationalize poverty; it reformed, and allowed piracy to subside
into trade. By 1400 its mercantile fleet was strong enough to defy the
sea power of Crete; it refused to ship its Africa-bound goods across the
island, but sent them directly to Egypt; possibly this was the cause, or
result, of a war that ended in the destruction of the Cretan
citadels.</p>
<p>The wealth that grew from this trade was not accompanied by any com-
mensurate culture visible in the remains. Greek tradition credited the
Pelasgians with having learned the alphabet from Phoenician traders. At
Tiryns and Thebes some jars have been found bearing unintelligible
characters, but no clay tablets, or inscriptions, or documents have been
discovered; probably when Mycenae decided to be literate it used
perishable writing materials, as the Cretans did in their final period;
and nothing has been preserved. In art the Mycenaeans followed Cretan
models, and so faithfully that archeology suspects them of importing
their major artists from Crete. But after Cretan art declined, painting
flourished vigorously on the mainland. The decorative designs of borders
and cornices are of the first order, and persist into classic Greece,
while the surviving frescoes indicate a keen feeling for moving life.
The Ladies in the Box are splendid dowagers, who might adorn any opera
promenade today and be in full fashion of coiflFure and gowns; they are
more alive than the stiffly conscious Ladies in the Chariot, who are out
for an afternoon drive in the park. Better still is the Boar Hunt, a
fresco from Tiryns: the boar and the flowers are unconvincingly
conventional, the incredibly pink hounds are disfigured with stylized
spots of scarlet, black, or blue, and the hind quarters of the plunging
boar taper away into the likeness of some high-heeled maiden falling
from her palace bower; nevertheless the chase is real, die boar is
desperate, the dogs are in fast flight through the air, and man, the
most sentimental and terrible of all beasts of prey, stands ready with
his murderous spear.“ One may suspect from such samples the active and
physical life of the Mycenaeans, the proud beauty of their women, the
vivid adornment of their palaces.</p>
<p>The highest art of Mycenae was in metals. Here the mainland equaled
Crete, and dared to use its own forms and decoration. If Schliemann did
not quite find, the bones of Agamemnon, he found their weight in silver
and gold: jewelry of many kinds, in spendthrift quantities; stud buttons
worthy of any king; intaglios alive with scenes of hunting, war, or
piracy; and a cow’s head in shi ning silver, with horns and frontal
rosette of gold — at any moment one expects from</p>
<p>3^ THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. H</p>
<p>it the plaintive mooing to which Schliemann, never at a loss for
explanations, traced the name Mycenae (Miikenai).” The finest of the se
metal relics from Tiryns and Mycenae are two bronze daggers inlaid with
electron and burnished gold, and elegantly engraved with wildcats
chasing ducks, and lions pursuing leopards or fighting men.” Most
peculiar of all the remains are the golden mas ks, apparently laid over
the faces of dead royalty. One mask® looks for all the world l&amp;e the
face of a cat; however, the gallant Schliemann ascribed it not to Qy-
taemnestra but to Agamemnon.</p>
<p>The unquestioned masterpieces of Mycenaean art were found neither at
Tiryns nor at Mycenae but in a tomb at Vaphio, near Sparta, where a
minor prince once emulated the magnificence of the northern kings. Here,
amid another treasure of jewelry, were two thin cups of beaten gold,
simply formed and yet worked with the loving patience of all great art.
The craftsmanship is so like the best Minoan that most students are
inclined to attribute these cups to some Cretan Cellini; but it would be
a pity to deprive the Mycenaean od- ture of its most perfect memorials.
The subject — the snaring and taming of a bull — seems
characteristically Cretan; and yet the frequency with which such scenes
are engraved upon Mycenaean rings and seds or painted upon the palace
walls shows that the bull sport was as popular on the mainland as on the
island. On one of the cups the bull is caught in a net of heavy rope;
his mouth and nostrils gape with breathless anger and fatigue as he
struggles to get free and imprisons himself the more; while on the other
side a second bull gallops off in terror, and a third charges at a
cowboy who catches it bravely by the horns. On the companion cup the
captured bull is being led away; as we turn the vessel around we see him
already reconciled to the restraints of civilization, and engaged, as
Evans puts it, in “amorous conversation” with a cow.® Many centuries
were to pass before such skillful work would appear again in Greece.</p>
<p>The Mycenaean himself, as well as most of his art, is found in the
tombs; for he folded and buried his dead in uncomfortable jars, and
seldom cremated them as the Heroic Age would do. Apparently he believed
in a future life, for many objects of use and value were placed in the
graves. For the rest Mycenaean religion, so far as it reveals itself to
us, gives every evidence of Cretan origin or kinship. Here as in Crete
are the double ax, the sacred pillar, the holy dove, and the cult of a
mother goddess associated with a young male deity, presumably her son;
and here again are attendant divinities in the form of snakes. Through
all the transformations of religion known to us in Greece the mother
goddess has remained. After the Cretan Rhea came Demeter, the Mater
Dolorosa of the Greeks; after Demeter the Virgin Mother of God. Today,
standing on the ruins of Mycenae, one sees, in the little village below,
a modest Christian church. Grandeur is gone; simplicity and consolation
remain. Civilizations come and</p>

<p>go; they conquer the earth and crumble into dust; but faith survives
every desolation.</p>
<p>After the fall of Cnossus Mycenae prospered as never before; the
rising wealth of the “Shaft Grave Dynasty” raised great palaces upon the
hills of Mycenae and Tiryns. Mycenaean art took on a character of its
own, and captured the markets of the Aegean. Now the commerce of the
mainland princes reached eastward into Cyprus and Syria, southward
through the Cyclades to Egypt, westward through Italy to Spain,
northward through Boeotia and Thessaly to the Danube; and found itself
balked only at Troy. Like Rome absorbing and disseminating the
civilization of Hellas, so</p>
<p>Mycenae, won by the culture of dying Crete, spread the Mycenaean
phase of that culture throughout the Mediterranean world.</p>

<p>Between the Greek mainland and Crete 220 islands dot the Aegean,
forming a circle around Delos, and therefore called the Cyclades. Most
of them are rugged and barren, precarious mountain survivals of a land
half drowned in the sea; but some were rich enough in marble or metal to
be already busy and civilized, as the world goes, long before Greek
history comes into our view. In 1896 the British School of Athens dug
into the soil of Melos at Phylakopi and found tools, weapons, and
pottery remarkably akin, age by age, to the Minoan; and a like research
in other islands has built up a prehistoric picture of the Cyclades
conforming in time and character, though never comparable in artistic
excellence, with the bioscope of Crete. The Cyclades were cramped for
land, totaling less than a thousand square miles among them, and proved,
like classic Greece, incapable of uniting under one political power. By
the sev- enteenth century b.c. the little isles had passed in government
and art, even, here and there, in language and writing, under Cretan
domination. Then, in the final pemd (1400-1200), the imports from Crete
fell away, and the islands increasingly took their pottery and their
styles from Mycenae.</p>
<p>Moving eastward into the Sporades (Scattered) Islands, we find in
Rhodes another prehistoric culture of the simpler Aegean type. In Cyprus
the rich deposits of copper that gave the island its name brought it a
measure of wealth throughout the Bronze Age (3400-1200), but its wares*
remained crude and undistinguished before the coming of Cretan
influence. Its population, pre- dominantly Asiatic, used a syllabic
script akin to the Minoan, and worshiped a</p>

<p>34 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.n</p>
<p>goddess apparently descended from the Semitic Ishtar, and destined to
become die Aphrodite of the Greeks,“ After 1600 the metd industry of the
island developed rapidly; the mines, owned by the royal government,
exported copper to Egypt, Crete, and Greece; the foundry at Ei^omi made
famous daggers, and the potters sold their globular bowls from Egypt to
Troy. The forests were cut into timber, and cypress from Cyprus began to
compete with the cedars of Lebanon. In the thirteenth century Mycenaean
colonists founded the col- onies that were to become the Greek cides of
Paphos, sacred to Aphrodite, and Gdum, birthplace of the Stoic Zeno, and
Cyprian Salamis, where Solon paused in his wanderings to replace chaos
with law.</p>
<p>From Cyprus Mycenaean trade and influence crossed to Syria and Caria,
and thence, as well as by other “rowing - stones,” they moved up the
coasts and islands of Asia until they reached Troy. There, on a hill
separated by three miles from the sea, Schliemann and Dorpfeld found
nine cities, super- imposed each upon its predecessor, as if Troy had
had nine lives.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>In the lowest strata were the remains of a neolithic village coming
down to 3000 B.C. Here were walls of rough stones, mortared with mud;
clay whorls, bits of worked ivory, tools of obsidian, and pieces of
hand- polished black pottery. (2) Above this lay the ruins of the Second
City, which Schliemann believed to have been Homer’s Troy. Its enclosing
walls, like those of Tiryns and Mycenae, were of cyclopean stones; at
in- tervals there were fortresses, and at the comers great double gates,
of which two are well preserved. Some houses survive to a height of four
feet, their walls built of brick and wood upon a stone foundation. The
red-painted pottery, wheel-turned but erode, indicates a life span for
this city from approximately 2400 to 1900. Bronze has replaced stone for
tools and weapons, and jewelry abounds; but the statuettes are
unprepossessingly primitive. The Second Qty was apparently destroyed by
fire; signs of con- flagration are numerous, and persuaded Schliemann
that this was the work of Agamenmon’s Greeks.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3- 5) Above the “Burnt City” are the relics of three successive
hamlets, small and poor, and negligible in archeological content. (6)
About 1600 another city rose on the historic hill. Through the
passionate haste of his work, Schliemaim mixed the objects of this
stratum with those of the second, and dismissed the Sixth Qty as an
unimportant “Lydian settle - ment.”® But Dorpfeld, continuing the
excavations after Schliemann’s death, and for a time with Schliemann’s
money,“ revealed a town consider - ably larger than the Second, ornate
with substantial buildings in dressed stone, and enclosed by a
thirty-foot wall of whose four gates three renudn.</p>
<p>CHAP.n) BEFORE AGAMEMNON 35</p>
<p>In the ruins were monochrome vases of finer workmanship than before,
vessels like the “Minyan” ware of Orchomenos, and potsherds so like
those found at Mycenae that Dorpfeld considered them to be importations
from that city, and therefore contemporary with the Shaft Grave Dynasty
(1400-1200). On these and other shifting grounds current opinion iden-
tifies the Sixth City with Homer’s Troy,<em>“ and assigns to it the
“Treasurj</em></p>
<p>Who were the Trojans? An Egyptian papyrus mentions certain “Dar -
denui” as among the allies of the Hittites at the battle of Kadesh
(1287); it is likely that these were the ancestors of the “Dardenoi” who
in Homer’s terminology are one with the Trojans.“ Probably these Dardani
were of Balkan origin, crossed the Hellespont in the sixteenth century
with the kindred Phrygians, and settled in the lower valley of the
Scamander.“ Herodotus, however, identified the Trojans with the
Teucrians, and the Teucrians, according to Strabo, were Cretans who
settled in the Troad,} perhaps after the fall of Cnossus.“ Both Crete
and the Troad had a sacred Mt. Ida, the “many - fountained Ida” of Homer
and Tennyson. Presumably the region was subject at various times to
political and ethnic influences from the Hittite hinterland. All in all,
the excavations indicate a civilization partly Minoan, partly Mycenaean,
partly Asiatic, partly Danubian. Homer represents the Trojans as
speaking the same language and worshiping the same gods as the Greeks;
but later Hellenic imagination preferred to think of Troy as an Asiatic
city, and of the famous siege as the first known episode in an endless
contest between Semite and Aryan, East and West.“</p>
<p>More significant than the racial complexion of its people was the

<p>•Dr. Carl Blegen, field director of the University of Cincinnati
excavations at Troy (193 if), believes that these have shown that Troy
VI was destroyed about 1300, probably by eaj^quake, and that upon its
ruins rose the Seventh City, which he calls Priam’s Troy. Dorpfeld
prefers to call this Troy Ylb. Cf. Journal of Hellenic Studies^ LVI,
156.</p>
<p>t (7) Troy Vn was a small unfortified setdement, which occupied the
site till (8) Alex- ander the Great, in 334, built upon it Troy VIII in
homage to Homer. (9) About the begin- ning of the Christian era the
Romans built Novum lliumy or New Troy, which survived till the fifth
century aj&gt;.</p>
<p>4: The name Troy was traced by Greek tradition to the eponymous hero
Tros, father of Hus, father of Laomedon, father of Priam.® Hence the
variant names of the city — Troar, llios, llion. Ilium, An eponymous
hero, or eponym, is a probably legendary person to whom a social or
political group attributes its origin and name. The Dardani, for
example, believed or pretended that they were descended from Dardanus,
son of Zeus; so the Dorians traced themselves to Dorus, the lonians to
Ion, etc.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>position of Troy near the entrance to the Hellespont and the rich
lands about the Black Sea. Throughout history that narrow passage has
been the battleground of empires; the siege of Troy was the Gallipoli
adventure of 1 194 B.C. The plain was moderately fertile, and precious
metals lay in the soil to the east; but this alone would hardly account
for the wealth of Troy, and the tenacious attack of the Greeks. The city
was admirably placed to levy tolls upon vessels wishing to pass through
the Hellespont, while it was too far inland to be conveniently assailed
from the sea: “perhaps it was this, and not Helen’s face, that launched
a thousand ships upon Ilium. On a like - lier theory the southward
current and winds in the strait persuaded mer- chants to unload their
cargoes at Troy and ship them overland into the interior; from the
charges exacted for this service Troy may have derived its wealth and
power.“ In any case the city’s trade grew rapidly, as may be judged from
the varied provenance of its remains. From the lower Aegean came copper,
olive oil, wine, and pottery; from the Danube and Thrace came pottery,
amber, horses, and swords; from distant China came so great a rarity as
jade.“ In return Troy brought from the interior, and exported, timber,
silver, gold, and wild asses. Seated proudly behind their wihs, the
“horse - taming Trojans” dominated the Troad, and taxed its trade on
land and sea.</p>
<p>The picture that we derive from the Iliad of Priam and his household
is one of Bijjlical grandeur and patriarchal benevolence. The King is
polyg- amous, not as a diversion but as a royal responsibility to
continue his high breed abundantly; his sons are monogamous, and as well
behaved as the fictitious Victorians — excepting, of course, the gay
Paris, who is as innocent of morals as Alcibiades. Hector, Helenus, and
Troilus are more likable than the vacillating Agamemnon, the treacherous
Odysseus, and the petulant Achilles; Andromache and Polyxena are as
charming as Helen and Iphi- genia; and Hecuba is a shade better than
Clytaemnestra. All in all, the Trojans, as pictured by their enemies,
seem to us less deceitful, more de- voted, better gentlemen, than the
Greeks who conquered them. The con- querors themselves felt this in
later days; Homer had many a kind word to say for the Trojans, and
Sappho and Euripides left no doubt as to where their sympathies and
admiration lay. It was a pity that these noble Dardans stood in the way
of an expanding Greece which, despite its multitude of faults, would in
the end bring to this and every other region of the Mediter- ranean a
higher civilization than they had ever known.</p>
