<h4 id="chapter-xxii">CHAPTER XXII</h4>
<p>Francis I and the Reformation</p>
<p>in France</p>
<p>1515-59</p>
<p>I. LE ROl GRAND NEZ</p>
<p>H E was born under a tree in Cognac on September 1 2, 1494. His
grand- father was Charles of Orleans, the poet; perhaps song and the
love of beauty were in his blood. His father was Charles of Valois and
Orleans, Count of Angouleme, who died, after many adulteries, in the
third year of Francis’ life. His mother was Louise of Savoy, a woman of
beauty, ability, and ambition, with a taste for wealth and power.
Widowed at seventeen, she refused the hand of Henry VII of England, and
devoted herself — barring some liaisons — to making her son king of
France. She did not mourn when Anne of Brittany, second wife of Louis
XII, had a stillborn son, leaving Francis heir to the throne. Louis
sadly made Francis Duke of Valois, and appointed tutors to instruct him
in the art of royalty. Louise and his sister Marguerite mothered him to
idolatry, and prepared him to be a ladies’ king. Louise called him Mon
roi, mon seigneur , mon Cesar, fed him chivalric ro- mances, gloried in
his gallantries, and swooned at the blows he received in the jousts that
he loved. He was handsome, gay, courteous, brave; he met dangers like a
Roland or an Amadis; when a wild boar, escaping from its cage, sought to
frolic in his princely court, it was Francis who, while others fled,
faced the beast and slew it splendidly.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve (1506) he was betrothed to Claude of France, the
seven-year-old daughter of Louis XII. She had been promised to the boy
who was to become the Emperor Charles V; the engagement had been broken
to avoid yoking France to Spain; this was one item in a hundred
irritations that urged Hapsburg and Valois into conflict from youth to
death. At fourteen Francis was bidden leave his mother and join Louis at
Chinon. At twenty he married Claude. She was stout and dull, lame and
fertile and good; she gave him children in 1515, 1516, 1518, 1520, 1522,
1523, and died in 1524.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he became king (January 1, 1515). Everybody was happy,
above all his mother, to whom he gave the duchies of Angouleme and
Anjou,</p>
<p>491</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>492</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>the counties of Maine and Beaufort, the barony of Amboise. But he was
generous to others too — to nobles, artists, poets, pages, mistresses.
His pleas- ant voice, his cordiality and good temper, his vivacity and
charm, his living synthesis of chivalry and the Renaissance, endeared
him to his country, even to his court. France rejoiced, and placed high
hopes in him, as England in those years in Henry VIII, and the Empire in
Charles V; the world seemed young again, so freshened with royal youth.
And Francis, even more than Leo X, was resolved to enjoy his throne.</p>
<p>What was he really, this Arthur plus Lancelot? Physically he would
have been magnificent, had not his nose been more so; irreverent
contemporaries called him le rot grand nez. He was six feet tall,
broad-shouldered, agile, strong; he could run, jump, wrestle, fence with
the best; he could wield a two-handed sword or a heavy lance. His thin
beard and mustache did not disguise his youth; he was twenty-one when
crowned. His narrow eyes sug- gested alertness and humor, but not
subtlety or depth. If his nose betokened virility it conformed to his
reputation. Brantome, whose Dames Galantes cannot be taken as history,
wrote therein that “King Francis loved greatly and too much; for being
young and free, he embraced now one, now another, with indifference . .
. from which he took the grande verole that shortened his days.” 1 The
King’s mother was reported to have said that he was punished where he
had sinned.* Perhaps history has exaggerated the variety of his amours.
Whatever their number, he remained outwardly faithful first to Frangoise
deFoix, Comtesse de Chateaubriand, then, from 1526 to his death, to Anne
de Pisselieu, whom he made Duchesse d’Etampes. Gossip spread a hundred
romantic tales about him — that he besieged Milan not for Milan but for
a pair of unforgettable eyes that he had seen there, 3 or that a siren
in Pavia lured him to his central tragedy. 4 In any case we may have
some sympathy for so sensitive a king. He was capable of tenderness as
well as infatuation: when he proposed to divorce his son from the
persistently barren Catherine de Medicis, her tears dissuaded him. 6
“Nothing can be imagined more humane than Francis,” said Erasmus; 6 and
if that was the pathos of distance, Bude, France’s own humanist,
described him as “gentle and accessible.” 7</p>
<p>He was vain even for a man. He rivaled Henry VIII in the splendor of
his royal robes, and in the furry insouciance of his beret. He took the
salamander as his symbol, betokening persistent resurrection from every
conflagration, but life scorched him none the less. He loved honors,
distinctions, adulation, and could not bear criticism. He had an actor
whipped for satirizing the court; Louis XII, bitten by the same wit, had
merely smiled. 8 He could be ungrateful, as to Anne de Montmorency,
unfair, as to Charles of Bourbon,</p>
<p>• Almost certainly legendary is the story of the lawyer who, when his
wife, La Belle Ferromere (The Pretty Ironmonger) , was conscripted to
the royal bed, deliberately infected himself and gave her syphilis that
she might give it to the king . 2</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII)</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE</p>
<p>cruel, as to Semblangay; but by and large he was forgiving and
generous; Italians marveled at his liberality. 9 No ruler in history was
kinder to artists. He loved beauty intensely and intelligently, and
spent almost as readily on art as on war; he was half the purse of the
French Renaissance.</p>
<p>His intellectual ability did not equal his charm of character. He had
little Latin and no Greek, but astonished many men by the variety and
accuracy of his knowledge in agriculture, hunting, geography, military
science, litera- ture, and art; and he enjoyed philosophy when it did
not interfere with love or war. He was too reckless and impetuous to be
a great commander, too lighthearted and fond of pleasure to be a great
statesman, too fascinated by appearances to get to essences, too amiably
influenced by favorites and mistresses to choose the best available
generals and ministers, too open and frank to be a competent diplomat.
His sister Marguerite grieved over his incapacity for government, and
foresaw that the subtle but inflexible Em- peror would unhorse him in
their lifelong joust. Louis XII, who admired him as “a fine young
gallant,” saw with foreboding the lavish hedonism of his successor. “All
our work is useless,” he said; “this great boy will spoil everything.”

<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>FRANCE IN 1515</li>
</ol>
<p>France was now enjoying the prosperity engendered by a bountiful
soil, a skillful and thrifty people, and a beneficent reign. The
population was some 16,000,000, compared with 3,000,000 in England and
7,000,000 in Spain. Paris, with 300,000, was the largest city in Europe
after Constanti- nople. The social structure was semi-feudal: nearly all
the peasants owned the land they tilled, but usually they held it in
fief — and owed dues or serv- ices — to seigneurs and chevaliers whose
function was to organize agriculture and provide military protection to
their locality and the nation. Inflation, caused by the repeated
debasement of coinages and the mining or import of precious metals,
eased the traditional money dues, and enabled peasants to buy land
cheaply from the land-rich, money-poor nobility; hence a rural
prosperity that kept the French peasant merry and Catholic while the
Ger- man Bauer was making economic and religious revolution. Stimulated
by ownership, French energy drew from the soil the best corn and wine in
Eu- rope; cattle grew fat and multiplied; milk, butter, and cheese were
on every table; chickens or other fowl were in almost every yard; and
the peasant accepted the odor of his pigsty as one of the blessed
fragrances of life.</p>
<p>The town worker — still chiefly a craftsman in his own shop — did not
share proportionately in this prosperity. Inflation raised prices faster
than wages, and protective tariffs and royal monopolies, as of salt,
helped to keep the cost of living high. Discontented workers went on
strike, but were nearly</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>494</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>always defeated; and the law forbade workingmen to unite for economic
purposes. Commerce moved leisurely along the bountiful rivers, but pain-
fully along the poor roads, paying each lord a toll to pass through his
domain. Lyons, where the trade of the Mediterranean, ascending the
Rhone, met the flow of goods from Switzerland and Germany, was second
only to Paris in French industry, and only to Antwerp as a bourse or
center of investment and finance. From Marseilles French commerce roamed
the Mediterranean, and profited from the friendly relations that Francis
dared to maintain with Suleiman and the Turks.</p>
<p>From this economy Francis, after the fashion of governments, drew
reve- nues to the limit of tolerance. The taille (cut) fell as a
personal or property tax upon all but nobles and clergy; the clergy paid
the King ecclesiastical tithes and grants, the nobles supplied and
equipped the cavalry that was still the flamboyant mainstay of French
arms. Taking a lesson from the popes, Francis sold — and created to sell
— noble titles and political offices; in this way the nouveaux riches
slowly formed (as in England) a new aristocracy, ind the lawyers, buying
offices, established a powerful bureaucracy that — sometimes over the
head of the King — administered the government of France.</p>
<p>The King’s pleasures did not allow him much time for government. He
delegated its tasks, even the formation of its policies, to men like
Admiral Bonnivet, Anne de Montmorency, Cardinals Duprat and de Tournon,
and the Vicomte de Lautrec. Three councils aided and advised these men
and the King: a Privy Council of Nobles, a more intimate Council of
Affairs, and a Grand Council that handled appeals to the King. Except
for this, the Parlement of Paris, composed of some 200 secular or
ecclesiastical members appointed for life by the King, served as a
supreme court. It had the right to remonstrate with him when it thought
that his edicts contravened the funda- mental institutions of France;
and his decrees lacked -the full prestige of law until “registered”— in
effect ratified — by this ancient corps. Dominated by lawyers and old
men, the Parlement of Paris became the national political organ of the
middle classes, and — next to the Sorbonne — the most conserva- tive
organization in France. Local parlements, and governors appointed by the
King, administered the provinces. The States-General was for the time
being ignored; the collection of taxes replaced grants-in-aid, and the
role of the nobility in government declined.</p>
<p>The function of the nobles was twofold: to organize the army, and to
serve the King at court. The court, consisting of the administrative
heads, the leading nobles, their wives, and the family and favorites of
the King, now became the head and front of France, the mirror of
fashion, the mobile per- petual festival of royalty. At the summit of
this whirl was the Master of the King’s Household, who organized the
whole and patrolled the protocol;</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) IHE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 495</p>
<p>then the Chamberlain, who had charge of the royal bedchamber; then
four Gentlemen of the Bedchamber or First Lords in Waiting, who were
always at the King’s elbow to wait on his desires; these men were
changed every three months, to give other notables a turn at this
exhilarating intimacy; lest anyone be overlooked, there were twenty to
fifty-four Lords of the Bed- chamber to serve the highest four; add
twelve Pages of the Bedchamber and four Ushers of the Bedchamber, and
the King’s sleeping quarters were ade - quately cared for. Twenty lords
served as stewards of the King’s cuisine, managing a staff of forty-five
men and twenty-five cupbearers. Some thirty enfants d’hotmeur — boys of
awesome pedigree — functioned as royal pages, shining in silvered
livery; and a host of secretaries multiplied the hand and memory of the
King. A cardinal was Grand Chaplain of the royal chapel; a bishop was
Master of the Oratory or prayer service; and fifty diocesan bishops were
allowed to grace the court and so augment their fame. Hon- orary
positions as “grooms of the chamber,” with pensions of 240 livres, were
awarded for divers accomplishments, as to scholars like Bude and poets
like Marot. We must not forget seven physicians, seven surgeons four
bar- bers, seven choristers, eight craftsmen, eight clerks of the
kitchen, eight ushers for the audience chamber. Each of the Kin g’s sons
had his own at - tendants — stewards, chancellors, tutors, pages, and
servants. Each of the two queens at court — Claude and Marguerite — had
her retinue of fifteen or ten ladies in waiting, sixteen or eight maids
of honor — filles demoiselles. It was the most characteristic
distinction of Francis that he raised women to high place at his court,
winked expertly at their liaisons, encouraged and enjoyed their parade
of finery and soft charms. “A court without ladies,” he said, “is a
garden without flowers”; 11 and probably it was the women— dowered with
the ageless beauty of art — who gave the court of Francis I a graceful
splendor and gay stimulus unequaled even in the palaces of Imperial
Rome. All the potentates of Europe taxed their peoples to provide some
minor mirroring of this Parisian fantasy.</p>
<p>Beneath the polished surface was an immense base of servantry: four
chefs, six assistant chefs, cooks specializing in soups or sauces or
pastries or roasts, and a countless personnel to supply and serve the
King’s table, the cuisine commune of the court, and the needs and
comforts of ladies and gentlemen. There were court musicians, led by the
most notable singers, composers, and instrumentalists in Europe outside
of Rome. A Master of the Horse, twenty-five noble equerries, and a swarm
of coachmen and grooms attended the royal stables. There were Masters of
the Hunt, a hundred dogs, and 300 falcons — trained and cared for by a
hundred falconers under a Grand Falconer. Four hundred archers formed
the King’s bodyguard, and brightened the court with their colorful
costumes.</p>
<p>For court banquets, balls, marriages, and diplomatic receptions no
one</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>496</p>
<p>building in Paris sufficed. The Louvre was then a gloomy fortress;
Francis abandoned it for the assorted palaces known as Les Tournelles
(The Little Towers) near the Bastille, or for the spacious palace where
the Farlement had been wont to sit; better still, loving to hunt, he
moved out to Fontaine- bleau, or down to his chateaux along the Loire at
Blois, Chambord, Amboise, or Tours — dragging half the court and wealth
of France with him. Cellini, with his wonted hyperbole, described his
royal patron as traveling with a retinue of 18,000 persons and 12,000
horses. 12 Foreign ambassadors pro- tested the cost and weariness of
catching or keeping up with the King; and when they found him he was, as
like as not, in bed till noon, recovering from idle pleasures of the
night before, or busy preparing a hunt or a tournament. The cost of all
this perambulating glory was enormous. The treasury was al- ways near
bankruptcy, taxes were forever mounting, the bankers of Lyons were
dragooned into risky royal loans. In 1523, perceiving that his expendi-
tures were losing sight of his revenues, the King promised to put a
limit on his personal indulgences, “not including, however, the ordinary
run of our lit tle necessities and pleasures.” 13 He excused his
extravagance as needed to impress envoys, overwhelm ambitious nobles,
and please the populace; the Parisians, he thought, hungered for
spectacles, and admired rather than re- sented the splendor of their
King.</p>
<p>Now the government of France became bisexual. Francis ruled in appar-
ent omnipotence, but he was so fond of women that he readily yielded to
his mother, his sister, his mistress, even his wife. He must have loved
Claude somewhat, to keep her so constantly pregnant. He had married her
for rea- sons of state; he felt entitled to appreciate other women more
artistically designed. The court followed the lead of the King in making
a mannerly art of adultery. The clergy adjusted themselves after making
the requisite objections. The people made no objections, but gratefully
imitated the easy code of the court — except one girl, who, we are told,
deliberately marred her beauty to deflect the royal lechery (1524).
14</p>
<p>The most influential woman at the court was the King’s mother.
“Address yourself to me,” said Louise of Savoy to a papal legate; “and
we shall go our way. If the King complains we’ll just let him talk.” 15
Very often her advice was good, and when she served as his regent the
country fared better than at his own lax hands. But her covetousness
drove the Duke of Bourbon to treason, and let a French army starve in
Italy. Her son forgave her every- thing, grateful that she had made him
a god.</p>

</ol>
<p>Probably he loved his sister only next to his mother, and above his
mis- tresses — whose ministrations gave him something less lasting and
profound than her selfless adoration. Love was her life — love of her
mother, of her brother, of her husbands, Platonic love, mystical
religious love. A pretty story said “she was born smiling, and held out
her little hand to each comer.” 16 She called her mother, her brot her,
and herself NStre Trinite, and was content to be “the smallest angle” of
that “perfect triangle.” 17 By her birth she was Marguerite of
Angouleme, Orleans, and Valois. Two years older than Francis, she shared
in bringing him up, and in their childhood games “she was his mother,
his mistress, and his little wife.” 18 She watched over him as fondly as
if he had been some saving divinity become man; and when she found that
he was also a satyr she accepted that disposition as the right of a
Greek god, though she herself seems to have taken no taint from her
environment. She far outstripped Francis in studies, but she never
equaled his connoisseur’s appreciation of art. She learned Spanish,
Italian, Latin, Greek, and some Hebrew; she surrounded herself avidly
with</p>
<p>scholars, poets, theologians, and philosophers. Nevertheless she grew
into an attractive woman, not physically beautiful (she too had the long
Valois nose), but exercising a strong fascination by her charms of
character and intellect. She was sympatica, agreeable, generous, kind,
with a frequent dash of sprightly humor. She herself was one of the best
poets of the time, and her court at Nerac or Pau was the most brilliant
literary center in Europe. Everyone loved her and wished to be near her.
That romantic but cynical age called her la perle des Valois — for
margarita was Latin for pearl; and a pretty legend grew that Louise of
Savoy had conceived her by swallowing a pearl.</p>
<p>Her letters to her brother are among the fairest and tenderest in
literature. There must have been much good in him to draw out such
devotion. Her other loves flowed or ebbed, burned or cooled; this pure
passion was con- stant through fifty years, and always intense. The
breath of that love almost clears the air of that perfumed time.</p>
<p>Gaston de Foix, nephew of Louis XII, aroused her first romance, then
went off to Italy to conquer and die at Ravenna (1512). Guillaume de
Bon- nivet fell deeply in love with her, but found her heart still full
of Gaston; he married one of her ladies in waiting to be near her. At
seventeen ( 1 509) she was wed to Charles, Duke of Alencon, also of
royal pedigree; Francis had requested the marriage to cement an alliance
of troublesomely rival families; but Marguerite found it hard to love
the youth. Bonnivet offered her the consolations of adultery; she
disfigured her face with a sharp stone to break</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>498</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>th- spell of her charm on him. Both Alengon and Bonnivet went to
fight for Francis in Italy; Bonnivet died a hero at Pavia; Alengon was
reported to have fled at the crisis of the battle. He returned to Lyons
to find himself univer- sally scorned; Louise of Savoy berated him as a
coward; he fell ill of pleurisy; Marguerite forgave him and nursed him
tenderly, but he died (1525).</p>
<p>After two years of widowhood Marguerite, now thirty-five, married
Henri d’Albret, titular King of Navarr e, a youth of twenty-four. Kept
out of his principality by the claims of Ferdinand II and Charles V to
Navarre, Henri was made governor of Guienne by Francis, and established
a minor court at Nerac, sometimes at Pau, in southwest France. He
treated Mar- guerite as a mother, almost as a mother-in-law; he did not
imitate her fidelity to the marriage vows, and she had to console
herself by playing hostess and protectress to writers, philosophers, and
Protestant refugees. In 1528 she bore Henri a daughter, Jeanne d’Albret,
destined to fame as the mother of Henry IV. Two years later she gave
birth to a son, who died in infancy; thereafter she wore nothing but
black. Francis wrote her a letter of such tender piety as we might
rather have expected from her pen. Soon, how- ever, he commanded her and
Henri to surrender Jeanne to him to be brought up near the royal court;
he feared that Henri would betroth her to Philip II of Spain, or that
she would be reared as a Protestant. This separation was the profoundest
of Marguerite’s many griefs before the death of the King, but it did not
interrupt her devotion to him. It is sad but necessary to relate that
when Francis bade Jeanne marry the Duke of Cleves, and Jeanne re- fused,
Marguerit e supported the King to the point of instructing Jeanne’s
governess to thrash her till she consented. Several beatings were
adminis- tered, but plucky Jeanne — a girl of twelve — issued a signed
document to the effect that if she were forced into the marriage she
would hold it null. The wedding was arranged nevertheless, on the theory
that the needs of the state were the supreme law; Jeanne resisted to the
last, and had to be carried into the church. As soon as the ceremony was
over she fled, and went to live with her parents at Pau, where her
extravagance in dress, retinue, and charities almost ruined them.</p>
<p>Marguerite herself was the embodiment of charity. She walked
unescorted in the streets of Pau, “like a simple demoiselle,” allowed
anyone to ap proach her, and heard at first hand the sorrows of her
people. “No one ought to go away sad or disappointed from the presence
of a prince,” she said, “for kings are the ministers of the poor . . .
and the poor are the members of God.” 19 She called her self the “Prime
Minister of the Poor.” She visited them in their homes, and sent them
physicians from her court. Henri co-operated fully in this, for he was
as excellent a ruler as he was a negligent husband, and the public works
directed by him served as a model to France. Together he and Marguerite
financed the education of a large number of poor students.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 499</p>
<p>among them the Amyot who later translated Plutarch. Marguerite gave
shelter and safety to Marot, Rabelais, Desperiers, Lefevre d’Etaples,
Calvin, and so many others that one of her proteges compared her to “a
hen care - fully calling together her chicks, and covering them with her
wings.” 20</p>
<p>Aside from her charities three interests dominated her life at Nerac
and Pau: literature, Platonic love, and a mystic theology that found
room for Catholicism and Protestantism alike, and tolerance even for
free thought. It was her custom to have poets read to her as she
embroidered; and she her- self composed verses of some worth, in which
human and divine love mingled in one obscure ecstasy. She published in
her lifetime several volumes of poetry and drama; they are not as fine
as her letters, which were not printed till 1841. All the world knows of
her Hepttmeron, because of its re- puted indecency; but patrons of
pornography will be disappointed in it. These stories were in the manner
of the time, which found its chief humor in the pranks, anomalies, and
vicissitudes of love, and in the deviations of monks from their vows;
the stories themselves are told with restraint. They are the tales
related by the men and women of Marguerite’s court, or that of Francis;
they were written down by or for her (1544-48), but were never pub-
lished by her; they appeared in print ten years after her death. She had
in- tended them to form another Decameron, but as the book stopped short
with the seventh day of the storytelling, the editor called it
Heptameron. Many of the narratives seem to be authentic histories,
disguised with changed names. Brantome tells us that his mother was one
of the storytellers, and that she had a key to the real persons
concealed by pseudonyms in the tales; he assures us, for example, that
the fourth tale of the fifth day is an account of Bonnivet’s attempts
upon Marguerite herself. 21</p>
<p>It must be admitted that the professed taste of our day would feel
obliged to blush at these stories of seduction, told by French ladies
and gentlemen who thus beguiled their days of waiting for a flood to
abate and let them return from the baths of Cauterets. Some of the
incidental remarks are startling: “You mean to say, then, that all is
lawful to those who love, pro - vided no one knows?” “Yes, in truth;
’tis only fools who are found out.” 22 The general philosophy of the
book finds expression in a pregnant sentence of the fifth story:
“Unhappy the lady who does not carefully preserve the</p>
<p>500 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>more dangerous.” It should be added that the merry storytellers hear
Mass every morning, and fumigate every second page with arias of
piety.</p>
<p>That Marguerite should have enjoyed or collected these tales points
the mood of the age, and cautions us not to picture her as a saint until
her de- clining years. While she herself seems to have been sedulously
pure, she tolerated much laxity in others , made no recorded objections
to the King’s distribution of his powers, and kept on terms of intimate
friendship with his successive mistresses. Apparently the men, and most
of the women, thought of love between the sexes in unashamedly sexual
terms. It was a charming custom of French women, in that lighthearted
reign, to make presents of their garters to imaginative men. 25
Marguerite considered phys- ical desire as quite permissible, but she
herself made room in her heart for Platonic and religious love. The cult
of Platonic love had come down from medieval “courts of love,”
reinforced by such Italian strains as Bembo’s paean at the end of
Castiglione’s Courtier. It was good, Marguerite felt, that women should
accept, in addition to the usual sexual passion, the devo- tion of men
who were to be rewarded only with a tender friendship and some harmless
intimacies; this association would train esthetic sensitivity in the
male, refine his manners, and teach him moral restraint; so woman would
civi lize man. But in Marguerite’s philosophy there was a higher love
than either the sexual or the Platonic — the love of goodness, beauty,
or any per- fection, and therefore, above all, the love of God. But “to
love God one must first love a human creature perfectly.” 26</p>
<p>Her religion was as complex and confused as her conception of love.
Just as the selfishness of her brother could not dim her devotion to
him, so the tragedies and brutalities of life left her religious faith
pure and fervent, how- ever unorthodox. She had skeptical moments; in Le
rniroir de Fame peche- resse she confessed that at times she had doubted
both Scripture and God; she charged God with cruelty, and wondered had
He really written the Bible. 27 In 1533 the Sorbonne summoned her to
answer an accusation of heresy; she ignored the summons; a monk told his
congregation that she deserved to be sewn in a sack and thrown into the
Seine; 28 but the King told the Sorbonne and the monks to let his sister
alone. He could not credit the charges against her; “she loves me so
much,” he said, “that she will be - lieve only what I believe.” 29 He
was too happy and confident to dream of being a Huguenot. But Marguerite
could; sbe had a sense of sin, and made mountain peaks out of her
peccadilloes. She despised the religious orders as idling, wenching
wastrels; reform, she felt, was long overdue. She read some of the
Lutheran literature, and approved its attacks upon ecclesiastical im-
morality and greed. Francis was amazed to find her, once, praying with
Farel 30 — the John the Baptist of Calvin. At Nerac and Pau. while
continuing to pray to the Virgin with trustful piety, she spread her
protective skirt®</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXl) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 501</p>
<p>over fugitive Protestants, including Calvin himself. However, Calvin
was much offended to find at her court freethinkers like Etienne Dolet
and Bona- venture Desperiers; he reproved her for her tolerance, but she
continued it. She would gladly have composed the Edict of Nantes for her
grandson. In Marguerite the Renaissance and the Reformation were for a
moment one . 31</p>
<p>Her influence radiated through France. Every free spirit looked up to
her as protectress and ideal. Rabelais dedicated Gargantua to her.
Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay followed, now and then, her Platonizing,
Plotinizing mysticism. Marot’s translations of the Psalms breathed her
half -Huguenot spirit. In the eighteenth century Bayle sang an ode to
her in his Dictionnaire. In the nineteenth century the Protestant
Michelet, in that magnificent, inter- minable, unwearying rhapsody
called Histoire de France, offered her his gratitude: “Let us always
remember this tender Queen of Navarre, in whose arms our people, fleeing
from prison or the pyre, found safety, honor, and friendship. Our
gratitude to you, lovable Mother of our Renaissance! Your hearth was
that of our saints, your heart was the nest of our freedom.” 82 IV. THE
FRENCH PROTESTANTS</p>
<p>No one questioned the need of religious reform. The same
ecclesiastical good and evil appeared here as elsewhere: faithful
priests, devout monks, saintly nuns, here and there a bishop dedicated
to religion rather than poli- tics; and ignorant or lackadaisical
priests, idle and lecherous monks, money- grubbing friars pretending
poverty, weak sisters in the convents, bishops who took the earthly cash
and let the celestial credit go. As education rose, faith fell; and as
the clergy had most of the education, they showed in their conduct that
they no longer took to heart the once terrifying eschatology of their
official creed. Some bishops appropriated to themselves a luxurious
multiplicity of benefices and sees; so Jean of Lorraine held — and
enjoyed revenues from — the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, the
archbishop- rics of Reims, Lyons, Narbonne, Albi, Macon, Agen, and
Nantes, and the abbeys of Gorze, Fecamp, Cluny, Marmoutiers, Saint-Ouen,
Saint-de-Laon, Saint-Germer, Saint-Medard of Soissons, and Saint-Mansuy
of Toul . 33 It was not enough for his needs; he complained of poverty .
34 Monks de- nounced the worldliness of the bishops; priests denounced
the monks; Bran- tome quotes a phrase then popular in France:
“Avaricious or lecherous as a priest or a monk .” 35 The first sentence
of the Heptameron describes the Bishop of Sees as itching to seduce a
married woman; and a dozen stories in the book retail the similar
enterprises of various monks. “I have such a horror of the very sight of
a monk,” says one character, “that I could not even con- fess to them,
believing them to be worse than all other men.” 86 “There are</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>5 02</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>some good men among them,” admits Oisille— which is Margaret’s name,
in the Heptameron, for her mother — but this same Louise of Savoy wrote
in her journal: “In the year 1522 . . . my son and I, by the grace of
the Holy Spirit, began to know the hypocrites, white, black, gray,
smoky, and of all colors, from whom God in His infinite mercy and
goodness preserve and defend us; for if Jesus Christ is not a liar,
there is not among all mankind a more dangerous generation.” 87</p>
<p>Yet the acquisitiveness of Louise, the polygyny of her son, the
anarchic morals of the court, gave no inspiring example to the clergy,
who were so largely subject to the King. In 1516 Francis secured from
Leo X a Con- cordat empowering him to appoint the bishops and abbots of
France; but since he used these appointments largely as rewards for
political services, the worldly character of the prelacy was confirmed.
The Concordat in effect made the Gallican Church independent of the
papacy and dependent upon the state. In this way Francis, a year before
Luther’s Theses, achie ved in fact, though graciously not in form, what
the German princes and Henry VIII would win by war or revolution — the
nationalization of Christianity. What more could French Protestants
offer the French King?</p>
<p>The first of them antedated Luther. In 1512 Jacques Lefevre, born at
Etaples in Picardy but then teaching at the University of Paris,
published a Latin translation of Paul’s Epistles, with a commentary
expounding, among other heresies, two that ten years later would be
basic with Luther: that men can be saved not by good works but only by
faith in the grace of God earned by the redeeming sacrifice of Christ;
and that Christ is present in the Eucharist by His own operation and
good will, not through any priestly transubstantiation of bread and
wine. Lefevre, like Luther, demanded a return to the Gospel; and, like
Erasmus, he sought to restore and clarify the authentic text of the New
Testament as a means of cleansing Christianity from medieval legends and
sacerdotal accretions. In 1523 he issued a French translation of the
Testament, and, a year later, of the Psalms. “How shameful it is,” said
one of his comments, “to see a bishop soliciting people to drink with
him, caring for naught but gambling . . . constantly hunting . . . fre-
quenting bad houses!” 88 The Sorbonne condemned him as a heretic; he
fled to Strasbourg (1525); Marguerite interceded for him; Francis
recalled him and made him royal librarian at Blois and tutor to his
children. In 1531, when Protestant excesses had angered the King,
Lefevre took refuge with Marguerite in southern France, and lived there
till his death at the age of eighty-seven (1537).</p>
<p>His pupil Guillaume Brigonnet, appointed Bishop of Meaux (1516), set
himself to reform that diocese in the spirit of his master. After four
years of zealous work he felt strong enough to venture upon theological
innovations. He appointed to benefices such known reformers as Lefevre,
Farel, Louis de</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 503</p>
<p>Berquin, Gerard Roussel, and Francis Vatable, and encouraged them to
preach a “return to the Gospel.” Marguerite applauded him, and made him
her spiritual director. But when the Sorbonne — the school of theology
that now dominated the University of Paris — proclaimed its condemnation
of Luther (1521), Brigonnet bade his cohorts make their peace with the
Church. The unity of the Church seemed to him, as to Erasmus and Mar-
guerite, more important than reform.</p>
<p>The Sorbonne could not stop the flow of Lutheran ideas across the
Rhine. Students and merchants brought Luther’s writings from Germany as
the most exciting news of the day; Froben sent copies from Basel to be
sold in France. Discontented workingmen took up the New Testament as a
revolu- tionary document, and listened gladly to preachers who drew from
the Gospels a utopia of social equality. In 1523, when Bishop Brigonnet
pub- lished on his cathedral doors a bull of indulgences, Jean Leclerc,
a wool- carder of Meaux, tore it down and replaced it with a placard
calling the pope Antichrist. He was arrested, and by order of the
Parlement of Paris was branded on the forehead (1525). He moved to Metz,
where he smashed the religious images before which a procession was
planning to offer incense. His right hand was cut off, his nose was torn
away, his nipples were plucked out with pincers, his head was bound with
a band of red-hot iron, and he was burned alive (1526). 80 Several other
radicals were sent to the stake in Paris for “blasphemy,” or for denying
the intercessory power of the Virgin and the saints ( 1 526-2 7 ) .</p>
<p>The people of France generally approved of these executions; 40 it
cher- ished its religious faith as God’s own revelation and covenant,
and abomi - nated heretics as robbing the poor of their greatest
consolation. No Luther appeared in France to rouse the middle class
against papal tyranny and ex- actions; the Concordat precluded such an
appeal; and Calvin had not as yet reached the Genevan eminence from
which he could send his stern summons to reform. The rebels found some
support among the aristocracy, but the lords and ladies were too
lighthearted to take the new ideas to the point of unsettling the faith
of the people or the comforts of the court. Francis him- self tolerated
the Lutheran propaganda so long as it offered no threat of social or
political disturbance. He too had his doubts — about the powers of the
pope, the sale of indulgences, the existence of purgatory; 41 and
possibly he thought to use his toleration of Protestantism as a weapon
over a pope too inclined to favor Charles V. He admired Erasmus, sought
him for the new College Royale, and believed with him in the
encouragement of educa- tion and ecclesiastical reform — but by steps
that would not divide the peo- ple into warring halves, or weaken the
services of the Church to private morality and social order. 42 “The
King and Madame” (Louise of Savoy), wrote Marguerite to Brigonnet in
1521, “are more than ever well -disposed</p>
<p>504 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>toward the reformation of the Church.” 48 When the Sorbonne arrested
Louis de Berquin for translating some of Luther’s works (1523), he was
freed by Marguerite’s intercession w ith the King. But Francis was
fright- ened by the Peasants’ Revolt in Germany, which seemed to have
grown out of Protestant propaganda; and before leaving for his debacle
at Pavia he bade the prelates stamp out the Lutheran movement in France.
While the King was a captive in Madrid, Berquin was again imprisoned,
but Mar- guerite again secured an order for his release. When Francis
himself was freed he indulged in a jubilee of liberalism, perhaps in
gratitude to the sister who had so labored for his liberation. He
recalled Lefevre and Roussel from exile, and Marguerite felt that the
movement for reform had won the day.</p>
<p>Two events drove the King back to orthodoxy. He needed money to
ransom the two sons whom he had surrendered to Charles in exchange for
his own freedom; the clergy voted him 1,300,000 livres, but accompanied
the grant with a request for a firmer stand against heresy; and he
agreed (December 16, 1527). On May 31, 1528, he was dismayed to learn
that both the heads on a statue of the Virgin and Child outside a church
in the parish of Saint-Germain had been smashed during the night. The
people cried out for vengeance. Francis offered a thousand crowns for
the discov- ery of the vandals, and led a somber procession of prelates,
state officials, nobles, and populace to repair the broken statues with
silver heads. The Sorbonne took advantage of the reaction to imprison
Berquin once more; and while Francis was absent at Blois the impenitent
Lutheran was burned at the stake (April 17, 1529), to the joy of the
attendant multitude. 44</p>
<p>The mood of the King varied with the shifts of his diplomacy. In
1532, angry at the collaboration of Clement VII with Charles V, he made
over- tures to the Lutheran princes of Germany, and allowed Marguerite
to install Roussel as preacher to large gatherings in the Louvre; and
when the Sor- bonne protested he banished its leaders from Paris. In
October 1533, he was on good terms with Clement, and promised active
measures against the French Protestants. On November 1 Nicholas Cop
delivered his pro-Luth- eran address at the university; the Sorbonne
rose in wrath, and Francis or- dered a new persecution. But then his
quarrel with the Emperor sharpened, and he sent Guillaume du Bellay,
favorable to reform, to Wittenberg with a request that Melanchthon
should formulate a possible reconciliation be- tween the old faith and
the new ideas (1534), and thereby make possible an affiance of
Protestant Germany and Catholic France. Melanchthon com- plied, and
matters were moving fast, when an extreme faction among the French
reformers posted in the streets of Paris, Orleans, and other cities, and
even on the doors of the King’s bedchamber at A mboise, placards
denounc- ing the Mass as idolatry, and the Pope and the Catholic clergy
as “a brood</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 505</p>
<p>(October 18, 15 34). 45 Enraged, Francis ordered an indiscriminate
imprison- ment of all suspects; soon the jails were full. Many printers
were arrested, and for a time all printing was prohibited. Marguerite,
Marot, and many moderate Protestants joined in condemning the placards.
The King, his sons, ambassadors, nobles, and clergy marched in solemn
silence, bearing lighted candles, to hear an expiatory Mass in Notre
Dame (January 21, 1535). Francis declared that he would behead his own
children if he found them harboring these blasphemous heresies. That
evening six Protestants were burned to death in Paris by a method judged
fit to appease the Deity: they were suspended over a fire, and were
repeatedly lowered into it and raised from it so that their agony might
be prolonged. 46 Between November 10, 1534, and May 5, 1535, twenty-four
Protestants were burned alive in Paris. Pope Paul III reproved the King
for needless severity, and ordered him to end the persecution. 47</p>
<p>Before the year was out Francis was again wooing the German Protes-
tants. He himself wrote to Melanchthon (July 23, 1535), inviting him to
come and “confer with some of our most distinguished doctors as to the
means of re-establishing in the Church that sublime harmony which is the
chief of all my desires.” 48 Melanchthon did not come. Perhaps he
suspected Francis of using him as a thorn in the Emperor’s side; or he
was dissuaded by Luther or the Elector of Saxony, who said, “The French
are not Evangel - icals, they are Era smians.” 49 This was true of
Marguerite, Brigonnet, Le - fevre, Roussel; not true of the placardists,
or of the Calvinistic Huguenots who were beginning to multiply in
southern France. After making peace with Charles (1538), Francis
abandoned all efforts to conciliate his own Protestants.</p>
<p>The darkest disgrace of his reign was only partly his fault. The
Vaudois or Waldenses, who still cherished the semi-Protestant ideas of
Peter Waldo, their twelfth-century founder, had been allowed, under
royal protection, to maintain their Quakerlike existence in some thirty
villages along the Durance River in Provence. In 1530 they entered into
correspondence with reform- ers in Germany and Switzerland, and two
years later they drew up a profes- sion of faith based on the views of
Bucer and Oecolampadius. A papal legate set up the Inquisition among
them; they appealed to Francis; he bade the prosecution cease (1533).
But Cardinal de Tournon, alleging that the Waldenses were in a
treasonable conspiracy against the government, per- suaded the ailing,
vacillating King to sign a decree (January 1, 1545) that all Waldenses
found guilty of heresy should be put to death. The officers of the
Parlement at Aix-en-Provence interpreted the order to mean mass ex-
termination. The soldiers at first refused to obey the command; they
were, however, induced to kill a few; the heat of murder inflamed them,
and they passed into massacre. Within a week (April 12 — 18) several
villages were</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>506</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>burned to the ground; In one of them 800 men, women, and children
were slaughtered; in two months 3,000 were killed, twenty-two
villages</p>
<p>were razed, 700 men were sent to the galleys. Twenty-five terrified
women, seeking refuge in a cavern, were asphyxiated by a fire built at
its mouth. Protestant Switzerland and Germany raised horrified protests;
Spain sent Francis congratulations. 60 A year later a small Lutheran
group was found meeting at Meaux under the leadership of Pierre Leclerc,
brother of branded Jean; fourteen of the group were tortured and burned,
eight after having their tongues torn out (October 7, 1546).</p>
<p>These persecutio ns were the supreme failure of Francis’ reign. The
cour - age of the martyrs gave dignity and splendor to their cause;
thousands of onlookers must have been impressed and disturbed, who,
without these spectacular executions, might never have bothered to
change their inherited faith. Despite the recurrent terror, clandestine
“swarms” of Protestants ex - isted in 1 530 in Lyons, Bordeaux, Orl6ans,
Reims, Amiens, Poitiers, Bourges, Nlmes, La Rochelle, Chalons, Dijon,
Toulouse. Huguenot legions sprang almost out of the ground. Francis,
dying, must have known that he had left his son not only the
encompassing hostility of England, Germany, and Switzerland, but a
heritage of hate in France herself.</p>
<p>V. HAPSBURG AND VALOIS: 1515-26</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that so volatile a monarch would be content
to surrender all the hopes that had agitated his predecessors for adding
Milan, and if possible Naples, as brilliants in the French crown. Louis
XII had ac- cepted the natural limits of France — had recognized, so to
speak, the sover- eignty of the Alps. Francis withdrew the recognition,
and challenged the right of Duke Maximilian Sforza to Milan. During
several months of nego- tiations he collected and equipped an immense
force. In August 1515, he led it by a new and perilous path — blasting
his way across rocky cliffs — over the Alps and down into Italy. At
Marignano, nine miles from Milan, the French knights and infantry met
Sforza’s Swiss mercenaries in two days (September 13-14, 1515) of such
killing as Italy had not known since the barbarian invasions; 10,000 men
were left dead on the ground. Time and again the French seemed defeated,
when the King himself charged to the front and rallied his troops by the
example of his daring. It was customary for a ruler victorious in battle
to reward special bravery by creating new knights on the field; but
before doing this Francis, in an unprecedented but characteristic
gesture, knelt before Pierre, Seigneur de Bayard, and asked to be
knighted by the hand of the famous Chevalier sans peur et sans reproche
. Bayard protested that the King was ex officio the knight of knights
and</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) the REFORMATION IN FRANCE 507</p>
<p>needed no dubbing, but the young sovereign, still only twenty-one,
insisted. Bayard went through the traditional motions magnificently, and
then put away his sword, saying: “Assuredly, my good sword, thou shalt
be well guarded as a relic, and honored above all others, for having
this day conferred upon so handsome and puissant a king the order of
chivalry; and never will I wear thee more except against Turks, Moors,
and Saracens!” 51 Francis entered Milan as its master, sent its deposed
Duke to France with a comfort- able pension, took also Parma and
Piacenza, and signed with Leo X, in splendid ceremonies at Bologna, a
treaty and Concordat that allowed both ’’ope and King to claim a
diplomatic victory.</p>
<p>Francis returned to France the idol of his countrymen, and almost of
Europe. He had charmed his soldiers by sharing their hardships and out-
braving their bravery; and though in his triumph he had indulged his
vanity, he tempered it by giving credit to others, softening all egos
with words of praise and grace. In the intoxication of fame he made his
greatest mistake: he entered his candidacy for the Imperial crown. He
was legitimately dis- turbed by the prospect of having Charles I, King
of Spain and Naples and Count of Flanders and Holland, become also head
of the Holy Roman Em- pire — with all those claims to Lombardy, and
therefore Milan, for which Maximilian had so repeatedly invaded Italy;
within such a new Empire France would be surrounded by apparently
invincible enemies. Francis bribed and lost; Charles bribed more, and
won (1519). The bitter rivalry began that kept Western Europe in turmoil
till within three years of the King’s death.</p>
<p>Charles and Francis never ran out of reasons for hostility. Even
before becoming Emperor, Charles had claimed Burgundy through his grand-
mother Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold, and had refused to recognize
the reunion of Burgundy with the French crown. Milan was formally a fief
of the Empire. Charles continued the Spanish occupation of Navarre;
Francis insiste d that it should be returned to his vassal, Henri
d’Albret. And above all these casus belli lay the question of questions:
Who was to be mas- ter of Europe — Charles or Francis? The Turks
answered, Suleiman.</p>
<p>Francis struck the first blow. Noting that Charles had on his hands a
po- litical revolution in Spain and a religious revolution in Germany,
he sent an army across the Pyrenees to recapture Navarre; it was
defeated in a cam- paign whose most important incident was the wounding
of Ignatius Loyola (1521). Another army went south to defend Milan; the
troops mutinied for lack of pay; they were routed at La Bicocca by
Imperial mercenaries, and Milan fell to Charles V (1522). To cap these
mishaps the constable of the French armies went over to the Emperor.</p>
<p>Charles, Duke of Bourbon, was head of the powerful family that would
rule France from 1589 to 1792. He was the richest man in the country
after</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>the King; 500 nobles were among his retainers; he was the last of the
great barons who could defy the monarch of the now centralized state. He
served Francis well in war, fighting bravely at Marignano; less well in
government, alienating the Milanese by his harsh rule. Ill supplied
there with funds from the King, he laid out 100,000 livres of his own,
expecting to be repaid; he was not. Francis looked with jealous
misgiving upon this almost royal vassal. He recalled him from Milan, and
offered him thoughtless or inten- tional affronts that left Bourbon his
brooding enemy. The Duke had mar- ried Suzanne of Bourbon, whose
extensive estates were by her mother’s will to revert to the Crown if
Suzanne should die without issue. Suzanne so died (1521), but after
making a will that left all her property to her husband. Francis and his
mother claimed the property as the most direct descendants of the
previous duke of Bourbon; Charles fought the claim; the Parlement of
Paris decided against him. Francis proposed a compromise that would let
the Duke enjoy the income of the property till his death; he rejected
the proposal. Louise, fifty-one, offered herself as a bride to the
thirty-one-year- old Duke, with a clear title to the property as her
dowry; he refused. Charles</p>
<p>V made a rival offer: the hand of his sister Eleonora in marriage,
and full support, by Imperial troops, of the Duke’s claims. The Duke
accepted, fled by night across the frontier, and was made
lieutenant-general of the Imperial army in Italy (1523).</p>
<p>Francis sent Bonnivet against him. Marguerite’s lover proved incompe
- tent; his army was overwhelmed at Romagnano by the Duke; and in the
retreat the Chevalier de Bayard, commanding the dangerous rear guard,
was fatally wounded by a shot from a harquebus (April 30, 1524). The
victori- ous Bourbon found him dying under a tree, and offered him some
consola- tory compliments. “My lord,” answered Bayard, “there is pity
for me; I die having done my duty; but I have pity for you, to see you
serving against your King, your country, and your oath.” 62 The Duke was
moved, but had burned all bridges behind him. He entered into an
agreement with Charles</p>
<p>V and Henry VIII by which all three were to invade France
simultaneously, overwhelm all French forces, and divide the land among
them. As his part of the bargain the Duke entered Provence, took Aix,
and laid siege to Mar- seille; but his campaign was poorly provisioned,
met unexpectedly strong resistance, and collapsed. He retreated into
Italy (September 1524).</p>
<p>Francis thought it wise to pursue him and recapture Milan. Bonnivet,
foolish to the end, advised him to take Pavia first, and then come upon
Milan from the south; the King agreed, and laid siege (August 26, 1524).
But here too the defense was superior to the offense; for four months
the French host was held at bay, while Bourbon, Charles of Lannoy
(Viceroy of</p>
<p>Naples), and the Marquis of Pescara (husband of Vittoria Colonna)
gath- ered a new army of 27,000 men. Suddenly this force appeared behind
the</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 509</p>
<p>French; on the same day (February 24, 1525) Francis found his men as-
saulted on one side by this unexpected multitude, and on the other by a
sortie from Pavia. As usual, he fought in the van of the melee, and
killed so many of the enemy with his own sword that he thought victory
assured. But his generalship was sacrificed to his courage; his forces
were poorly de- ployed; his infantry moved in between his artillery and
the foe, making the superior French guns useless. The French faltered;
the Duke of Alengon fled, taking the rear guard with him. Francis
challenged his disordered army to follow him back into the battle; only
the most gallant of his nobles ac- companied him, and a slaughter of
French chivalry ensued. Francis re- ceived wounds in the face, on the
arms and legs, but struck out tirelessly; his horse collapsed under him;
still he fought. His loyal knights fell one by one till he was left
alone. He was surrounded by enemy soldiers, and was about to be slain
when an officer recognized him, saved him, and led him to Lan- noy, who
with low bows of respect accepted his sword.</p>
<p>The fallen King was confined in the fortress of Pizzighettone near
Cre- mona, whence he was allowed to send his oft quoted, oft misquoted
letter to his mother, who was ruling France in his absence:</p>
<p>to the regent of France: Madame, that you may know how stands</p>
<p>the rest of my misfortune: there is nothing in the world left to
me</p>
<p>but honor and my life, which is saved (de toute chose ne rtfest</p>
<p>demeure que Vhonneur et la vie , qui est sauvee). And in order that
in your adversity this news might bring you some little comfort, I</p>
<p>prayed for permission to write you this letter . . . entreating you,
in</p>
<p>the exercise of your accustomed prudence, to do nothing rash, for</p>
<p>I have hope, after all, that God will not forsake me. . . . 53</p>
<p>He sent a similar note to Marguerite, who answered both:</p>
<p>my lord: The joy we are still feeling at the kind letters which
you</p>
<p>were pleased to write yesterday to me and your mother, makes us so
happy with the assurance of your health, on which our life depends, that
it seems to me that we ought to think of nothing but of praising God and
desiring a continuance of your good news, which is the best meat we can
have to live on. And inasmuch as the Creator has given us grace that our
trinity should be always united, the other tiro do</p>
<p>entreat you that this letter, presented to you who are the third ,
may be accepted with the same affection with which it is cordially
offered you by your most humble and obedient servants, your mother
and</p>
<p>sister,</p>
<p>LOUISE, MARGUERITE 54</p>
<p>To the Emperor at Madrid Francis wrote a very humble letter telling
him that “if it please you to have so much honorable pity as to answer
foi the safety which a captive king of France deserves to find . . . you
may be sure</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>510</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>of obtaining an acquisition instead of a useless prisoner, and of
making a king of France your slave forever.” 65 Francis had not been
trained to mis - fortune.</p>
<p>Charles received the news of his victory calmly, and refused to
celebrate it, as many suggested, with a splendid festival. He retired
into his bedroom (we are told), and knelt in prayer. To Francis and
Louise he sent what seemed to him moderate terms for peace and the
liberation of the King. ( 1 ) France must give up Burgundy and all
claims to Flanders, Artois, and Italy. (2) All lands and dignities
claimed by the Duke of Bourbon must be sur- rendered to him. (3)
Provence and Dauphine should be made an independ- ent state. (4) France
must restore to England all French territory formerly held by Britain —
i.e., Normandy, Anjou, Gascony, and Guienne. (5) Francis must sign an
alliance with the Emperor, and join him in a campaign against the Turks.
Louise answered that France would not yield an inch of territory, and
was prepared to defend itself to the last man. The Regent acted now with
an energy, resolution, and intelligence that made the French people
forgive her headstrong faults. She arranged at once for the organization
and equipment of new armies, and set them to guard all points of
possible in- vasion. To keep the Emperor’s mind off France, she urged
Suleiman of Turkey to defer his attack on Persia and undertake instead a
westward cam- paign; we do not know what part her plea played in the
Sultan’s decision, but in 1526 he marched into Hungary, and inflicted so
disastrous a defeat upon the Christian army at Mohacs that any invasion
of France by Charles would have been deemed treason to Christendom.
Meanwhile Louise pointed out to Henry VIII and Clement VII how both
England and the papacy would be reduced to bondage if the Emperor were
allowed all the territory that he demanded. Henry wavered; Louise
persisted, and offered him an “indem - nity” of 2,000,000 crowns; he
signed a defen sive and offensive alliance with France (August 30,
1525). This female diplomacy opened male eyes, and shattered Charles’s
confidence.</p>
<p>By agreement among Louise, Lannoy, and the Emperor, the captive</p>
<p>King was transported to Spain. When Francis reached Valencia (July
2,</p>
<p>1525), Charles sent him a courteous letter, but his treatment of his
prisoner went no further toward chivalry. Francis was assigned a narrow
room in an old castle in Madrid, under rigorous vigilance; the sole
freedom allowed him was to ride on a mule near the castle, under watch
of armed and mounted guards. He asked Charles for an interview; Charles
put it off, and allowed two weeks of fretting confinement to incline
Francis toward paying a heavy price for liberty. Louise offered to meet
the Emperor and negotiate, but he thought it better to play upon his
prisoner than have a woman charm him into lenience. She informed him
that her daughter Marguerite, now a widow, “would be happy if she could
be agreeable to his Imperial Majesty,” but he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 511</p>
<p>preferred Isabella of Portugal, who, with a dowry of 900,000 crowns,
could provide him at once with bed and board. After two months of
anxious im- prisonment, Francis fell dangerously ill. The Spanish
people, regretting the Emperor’s severity, went to their churches to
pray for the French King. Charles prayed too, for a dead ruler would be
worthless as a political pawn. He visited Francis briefly, promised him
an early release, and sent permission to Marguerite to come and comfort
her brother.</p>
<p>Marguerite sailed from Aiguesmortes (August 27, 1525) to Barcelona,
and thence was carried by slow and tortuous litter through half the
length of Spain to Madrid. She consoled herself with writing poetry, and
sending characteristically fervent messages to the King. “Whatever may
be required of me, though it be to fling to the winds the ashes of my
bones to do you service, nought will be strange or difficult or painful
to me, but will be solace, ease of mind, honor.” 59 When at last she
reached the bedside of her brother</p>
<p>Francis had one card left to play, though it would almost certainly
mean his lifelong imprisonment. Having warned his sister to leave Spain
as quickly as possible, he signed (November 1525) a formal letter of
abdication in favor of his eldest son; and since this second Francis was
a boy of only eight years, he named Louise — and, in case of her death,
Marguerite — as regent of France. Charles saw at once that a king
without a kingdom, with nothing to surrender, would be useless. But
Francis had more physical than moral courage. On January 14, 1526, he
signed with Charles the Treaty of Madrid. Its terms were essentially
those that the Emperor had proposed to Louise; they were even more
severe, for they required that the two oldest sons of the King should be
handed over to Charles as hostages for the faithful execu- tion of the
agreement. Francis further consente d to marry the Emperor’s sister
Eleonora, Queen-Dowager of Portugal; and he swore that if he should fail
to carry out the terms of the treaty he would return to Spain to resume
imprisonment. 87 However, on August 22, 1525, he had deposited with his
aid es a paper nullifying in advance “all pacts, conventions,
renunciations, quittances, revocations, derogations, and oaths that he
might have to make contrary to his honor and the good of his crown”; and
on the eve of signing the treaty he repeated this statement to his
French negotiators, and declared that “it was through force and
constraint, confinement, and length of im -</p>
<p>512 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>prisonment that he was signing; and that all that was contained in it
was and should remain null and of no effect.” 68</p>
<p>On March 17, 152 6, Viceroy Lannoy delivered Francis to Marshal</p>
<p>Lautrec on a barge in the Bidassoa River, which separates Spanish
Iran from French Hendaye; and in return Lannoy received Princes Francis
and Henry. Their father gave them a blessing and a tear, and hurried on
to French soil. There he leaped upon a horse, cried joyfully, “I am a
king again!” and rode on to Bayonne, where Louise and Marguerite awaited
him. At Bordeaux and Cognac he spent three months in sports to recover
his health, and in- dulged in a little love; had he not been a monk for
a year? Louise, who had quarreled with the Comtesse de Chateaubriand,
had brought with her a pretty, blonde-haired maid of honor, eighteen
years old, Anne de Heilly de Pisselieu, who, as planned, struck the
King’s famished eye. He wooed her in haste, and soon won her as his
mistress; and from that moment till death parted them the new favorite
shared with Louise and Marguerite the heart of the King. She put up
patiently with his marriage to Eleonora, and with his incidental
liaisons. To save appearances he gave her a husband, Jean de Brosse,
made him Due, and her Duchesse, d’Etampes, and smiled ap - preciatively
when Jean retired to a distant estate in Britanny.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>WAR AND PEACE: 1 5 26-47</li>
</ol>
<p>When the terms of the Treaty of Madrid became generally known they
aroused almost universal hostility to Charles. The German Protestants
trem- bled at the prospect of facing so strengthened an enemy. Italy
resented his claim to suzerainty in Lombardy. Clement VII absolved
Francis from the oath he had sworn at Madrid, and joined France, Milan,
Genoa, Florence, and Venice in forming the League of Cognac for common
defense (May 22,</p>
<p>1526). Charles called Francis “no gentleman,” bade him return to his
Spanish prison, ordered a harsher confinement for the King’s sons, and
gave free rein to his generals to discipline the Pope.</p>
<p>An Imperial army collected in Germany and Spain poured down through
Italy, scaled the walls of Rome (the Duke of Bourbon dying in the
process), sacked the city more thoroughly than any Goths or Vandals had
ever done, killed 4,000 Romans, and imprisoned Clement in Sant’ An gelo.
The Em- peror, who had remained in Spain, assured a scandalized Europe
that his starving army had exceeded his instructions; nevertheless his
representatives in Rome kept the Pope shut up in Sant’ Angelo from May 6
to December 7, 152 7, and exacted from an almost bankrupt papacy an
indemnity of 368,000 crowns. Clement appealed to Francis and Henry for
aid. Francis dispatched</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 513</p>
<p>Lautrec to Italy with an army that sacked Pavia in reckless revenge
for its resistance two years before, and Italy wondered whether French
friends were any better than German enemies. Lautrec by-passed Rome and
be- sieged Naples, and the city began to starve. But meanwhile Francis
had of- fended Andrea Doria, head of the Genoese navy. Doria called his
fleet from the siege of Naples, went over to the side of the Emperor,
and provisioned the besieged. Lautrec’s army starved in turn; Lautrec
himself died, and his army melted away (1528).</p>
<p>The comedy of the rulers hardly relieved the tragedy of the people.
When the emissaries of Francis and Henry appeared at Burgos to make a
formal declaration of war, Charles retorted to the French envoy: “The
King of France is not in a position to address to me such a declaration;
he is my prisoner. . . . Your master acted like a dastard and a
scoundrel in not keep- ing his word that he gave me touching the Treaty
of Madrid; if he likes to say the contrary I will maintain my words
against him with my body to his.” 69 This challenge to a duel was
readily accepted by Francis, who sent a herald to tell Charles, “You
have lied in your throat.” Charles responded grandly, naming a place for
the encounter and asking Francis to name the time; but French nobles
intercepted the messenger, and judicious delays put off the match to the
Greek kalends. Nations had grown so large that their differences of
economic or political interest could not be settled by private combat,
or by the small mercenary armies that had been playing the game of war
in Renaissance Italy. The modem method of decision by competitive
destruction took form in this Hapsburg-Valois debate.*</p>
<p>It took two women to teach the potentates the art and wisdom of
peace. Louise of Savoy communicated with Margaret of Austria, Regent of
the Netherlands, and suggested that Francis, anxious for the return of
his sons, would abandon all claim to Flanders, Artois, and Italy, and
would pay a ransom of 2,000,000 gold crowns for his children, but would
never cede Burgundy. Margaret persuaded her nephew to defer his claim to
Burgundy, and to forget the claims of the Duke of Bourbon, now
conveniently dead. On August 3, 1529, the two women and their diplomatic
aides signed La Paix des Dames — the “Ladies Peace” of Cambrai. The
ransom was raised out of the commerce, industry, and blood of France,
and the royal princes, after four years of captivity, returned to
freedom with stories of cruel treat- ment that enraged Francis and
France. While the two able women found</p>
<ul>
<li>The duel had existed in the Middle Ages as an appeal, under royal or
judicial sanction and control, to the judgment of God. In the sixteenth
century it became a private and in- dividual defense of slighted honor;
it developed its own strict laws outside the laws of the state; and it
shared in some measure in developing the rules of gentlemanly courtesy
and discreet restraint. It was not legally permitted in France after
1547, but public opinion con- tinued to sanction it. In England it fell
into disuse under Elizabeth; trial by combat, however, remained legal
there till 1817.</li>

<p>514 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>lasting peace — Margaret in 1530, Louise in 1531 — the kings prepared
to re- new their war.</p>
<p>Francis turned everywhere for help. To Henry VIII he sent a money ap-
peasement for having almost ignored him in the Cambrai settlement; and
Henry, furious at Charles for opposing his “divorce,” pledged his
support to France. Within a year or so Francis negotiated alliances with
the Protes- tant princes of Germany, with the Turks, and with the Pope.
The vacillating Pontiff, however, soon made peace with Charles, and
crowned him emperor (1530) — the last coronation of a Holy Roman Emperor
by a pope. Then, frightened by a monarch who had in effect made Italy a
province of his realm, Clement sought a new bond with France by offering
his niece Cather- ine de Medicis in marriage to Francis’ son Henry, Duke
of Orleans. King and Pope met at Marseille (October 28, 1533), and the
marriage, pregnant with history, was performed by the Pope himself. A
year later Clement died, not yet having made up his mind about
anything.</p>
<p>The Emperor, already old at thirty-five, shouldered his self-imposed
bur- dens with weary fortitude. He was shocked to learn — on the word of
the Sultan’s vizier to Ferdinand of Austria— that the Turkish siege of
Vienna in 1529 had been undertaken in response to an appeal from
Francis, Louise, and Clement VII for help against the encompassing
Empire. 60 Moreover, Francis had allied himself with the Tunisian
chieftain Khair ed-Din Barbarossa, who was harassing Christian commerce
in the western Mediterranean, raiding coastal towns, and carrying
captive Christians into slavery. Charles collected another army and
navy, crossed to Tunis (1535), captured it, freed 10,000 Christian
slaves, and rewarded his unpaid troops by letting them loot the city and
massacre the Moslem population. Leaving garrisons in Bona and La Gol-
eta, Charles returned to Rome (April 5, 1536) as the triumphant defender
of Christendom against Islam and the King of France. Francis had
meanwhile renewed his claim to Milan, and in March 1536, he had
conquered the duchy of Savoy to clear his road into Italy. Charles was
furious. In a passionate ad- dress before the new pope, Paul III, and
the full consistory of cardinals, he recounted his efforts for peace,
the French King’s violations of the treaties of Madrid and Cambrai, and
the alliances of his “Most Christian Majesty” (as Francis was called)
with the enemies of the Church in Germany, and of Christianity in Turkey
and Africa; and he ended by again challenging Francis to a duel: “Let us
not contin ue wantonly to shed the blood of our innocent subjects; let
us decide the quarrel man to man, with what arms he pleases to choose .
. . and after that let the united forces of Germany, Spain, and France
be employed to humble the power of the Turk, and to exter- minate heresy
out of Christendom.”</p>
<p>It was a subtle speech, for it compelled the Pope to align himself
with the Emperor; but no one took seriously its proposal for a duel;
fighting by proxy</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 515</p>
<p>was much safer. Charles invaded Provence (July 25, 1536) with 50,000
men, hoping to flank or divert the French in Savoy by moving up the
Rhone. But Constable Anne de Montmorency ordered the weak French forces
to burn in their retreat everything that could supply the Imperial
troops; soon Charles, always lacking money, and unable to feed his men,
abandoned the campaign. Paul III, anxious to free Charles for an attack
on the Turks or the Lutherans, persuaded the crippled Titans to meet
with him — in jealously separate rooms — at Nice, and to sign a ten-year
truce (June 17, 1538). A month later Eleonora, wife to one, sister to
the other, brought King and Emperor together in a personal meeting at
Aiguesmortes. There they ceased to be royal, and became human; Charles
knelt to embrace the King’s young - est children; Francis gave him a
costly diamond set in a ring which was in- scribed Dilectionis testis et
exemplum —“a witness and token of love”; and Charles transferred from
his own neck to the King’s the collar of the Golden Fleece. They went
together to hear Mass, and the townspeople, rejoicing in peace, cried,
“The Emperor! The King!”</p>
<p>When Ghent rebelled against Charles (1539) and joined Bruges and</p>
<p>Ypres in offering themselves to Francis, the King resisted the
temptation; and when Charles, in Spain, found the seaways closed by
rebel vessels or mat de mer, Francis granted his request for passage
through France. His councilors advised the King to force the Emperor, en
route, to sign the ces- sion of Milan to the Duke of Orleans, but
Francis refused. “When you do a generous thing,” he said, “you must do
it completely and boldly.” He found his court fool writing in a “Fool’s
Diary” the name of Charles V; for, said Tribouillet, “he’s a bigger fool
than I am if he comes through France.” “And what will you say if I let
him pass?” asked the King. “I will rub out his name and put yours in his
place.” 61 Francis let Charles pass unhindered, and ordered every town
on the way to receive the Emperor with royal honors and feasts.</p>
<p>This precarious friendship was ended when Spanish soldiers near Pavia
captured French emissaries bearing new offers of alliance from Francis
to Suleiman (July 1 541 ). At this time Barbarossa was again raiding the
coastal towns of Italy. Charles sailed from Mallorca with another armada
to destroy him, but storms so buffeted the fleet that it was compelled
to return empty- handed to Spain. The Emperor’s fortunes were ebb ing.
His young wife, whom he had learned to love, had died (1539), and his
own health was worsening. In 1 542 Francis declared war on him over
Milan; the King’s allies now included Sweden, Denmark, Gelderland,
Cleves, Scotland, the Turks, and the Pope; only Henry VIII supported
Charles, for a price; and the Span- ish Cortes refused additional
subsidies for the war. A Turkish fleet combined with a French fleet to
besiege Nice, which was now Imperial territory ( 1543) ; the siege
failed, but Barbarossa and his Moslem troops were allowed</p>
<p>5 16 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>to winter at Toulon, where they openly sold Christian slaves. 62 The
Em- peror patiently retrieved the situation. He found means of pacifying
the Pope; he won Philip of Hesse to his side by winking at his bigamy;
he at- tacked and vanquished the Duke of Cleves; he effected a junction
with his English allies, and faced France with so strong a force that
Francis retreated and yielded him the honors of the campaign (October
1543). Again too poor to further provision his army, Charles welcomed an
offer of peace, and signed with Francis the Treaty of Crepy (September
18, 1544). The King withdrew his claims to Flanders, Artois, and Naples;
Charles no longer demanded Burgundy; a Hapsburg princess would marry a
French prince, and bring him Milan as her dowry. (Most of this could
have been peaceably arranged in 1525.) Charles was now free to overwhelm
the Protestants at Miihlberg; Titian pictured him there without the
arthritis, proud and trium- phant, worn and weary after a thousand
vicissitudes, a hundred turns of for- tune’s ironic wheel.</p>
<p>As for Francis, he was finished, and France nearly so. In one sense
he had lost nothing but honor; he had preserved his country by scuttling
the ideals of chivalry. Yet the Turks would have come without his call,
and their com- ing helped Francis to check an Emperor who, unresisted,
might have spread the Spanish Inquisition into Flanders, Holland,
Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. Francis had found France peaceful and
prosperous; he left it bankrupt and on the brink of another war. A month
before his death, while swearing friendship with Charles, he sent
200,000 crowns to the Protestants of Ger- many to support them against
the Emperor. 83 He — and in slightly less degree Charles — agreed with
Machiavelli that statesmen, whose task is to preserve their countries,
may violate the moral code which they require from their citizens, whose
task is only to preserve their lives. The French people might have
forgiven him his wars, but they lost relish for the splendor of his ways
and his court when they perceived the cost. He was already unpopular in
* 535 -</p>
<p>He consoled himself with beauty living and dead. In his later years
he made Fontainebleau his favorite residence, rebuilt it, and rejoiced
in the graceful feminine art with which the Italians were adorning it.
He sur- rounded himself with a Petite Bande of young women who pleased
him with their good looks and gaiety. In 1538 a disease injured his
uvula, and there- after he stammered shamefully. He tried to cure what
was probably his syphilis with mercury pills recommended by Barbarossa,
but they had no success. 64 A persistent and ill-smelling abscess broke
his spirit, gave a dull and plaintive look to his once keen eyes, and
moved him to an uncongenial piety. He had to watch his food, for he
suspected that some courtiers who expected to rise under his successor
were seeking to poison him. He noted sadly that the court now pivoted
around his son, who was already distribut-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 517</p>
<p>ing offices and impatiently awaiting his turn at the resources of
France. To his deathbed at Rambouillet he called his sole heir and
warned him not to be dominated by a woman — for Henry was already
devoted to Diane de Poitiers. The King confessed his sins in hurried
summary, and, breathing painfully, welcomed death. Francis, Duke of
Guise, at the door, whispered to those in the next room, Le vieux
gallant s’en va — ’’The old gallant is go - ing.” 65 He went, whispering
the name of Jesus. He was fifty -three, and had reigned thirty-two
years. France felt that it was too much; but when it had recovered from
him it forgave him everything, because he had sinned grace- fully, he
had loved beauty, he had been incarnate France.</p>
<p>In that same year Henry VIII died, and two years later, Marguerite.
She had been too long away from Francis, and too far, to realize that
death was stalking him. When word came to her, in a convent at
Angouleme, that he was seriously ill, she almost lost her reason.
“Whosoever shall come to my</p>

husband’s infidelities, and to her daughter’s wandering willfulness. She
found comfort, after all her brave, half-Protestant years, in the color
and incense and hypnotic music of Catholic ritual; the Calvinism that
was capturing southern France chilled her, and frightened her back to
her childhood piety. In December 1 549, while watching a comet in the
skies, she caught a fever that proved strong enough to break a frame and
spirit already weakened by life’s inclemencies. Years before she had
written lines as if half in love with</p>

<li>DIANE DE POITIERS</li>
</ol>
<p>The “old gallant” had had seven children, all by Claude. The eldest
son, Francis, was like his father, handsome, charming, gay. Henry, born
in 1519, was quiet, shy, a bit neglected; he matched his brother only in
misfortune. Their four years of hardship and humiliation in Spain had
marked them indelibly. Francis died six years after liberation. Henry
grew more taciturn than before, turned within himself, shunned the
frolics of the court; he had companions, but they rarely saw him smile.
Men said that he had become Spanish in Spain.</p>
<p>It was not his choice to marry Catherine de Medicis, nor hers to
marry him. She too had had tribulations. Both her parents had died of
syphilis within twenty-two days of her birth (1519); and from that time
till her marriage she was shifted from place to place, helpless and
unasked. When Florence expelled its Medici rulers (1527) it kept
Caterina as a hostage for their good behavior, and when these exiles
returned to besiege the city she was threat- ened with death to deter
them. Clement VII used her as a pawn to win France to papal policies;
she went obediently to Marseille, a girl of fourteen, and married a boy
of fourteen who hardly spoke to her during all the festival. When they
arrived in Paris she met a cold reception because she brought too many
Italians with her; she became to the Parisians “the Florentine”; and
though she tried hard to charm them, neither they nor her husband ever
warmed to her. Despite many efforts she remained barren for ten years,
and the doctors suspected some evil inheritance from her infected
parents. Los- ing hope of offspring, Catherine de Medicis, as she was
called in France, went to Francis weeping, and offered to submit to a
divorce and retire to a convent. The King graciously refused the
sacrifice. At last the gates of motherhood burst, and children came in
almost annual succession. Ten in all, they were chiefly Francis II, who
would marry Mary Stuart; Elizabeth, who would marry Philip II; Charles
IX, who would give the order for the Massacre of St. Bartholomew;
Edward, who became the tragic Henry III; and Marguerite of Valois, who
would marry and harry Henry of Navarre. Through all but the first four
of these barren or fertile years her husband, while begetting children
on her body, gave his love to Diane de Poitiers.</p>
<p>Diane was unique among the royal mistresses who played so leading a
role in French history. She was not beautiful. When Henry, seventeen,
fell in love with her (1536), she was already thirty-seven, her hair was
turning gray, and wrinkles were beginning to score the years on her
brow. Her only physical charms were grace, and a complexion kept fresh
by washing with cold water at all seasons. She was not a courtesan;
apparently she was faithful to her husband, Louis de Breze, till his
death; and though, like Henry,</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) the REFORMATION IN FRANCE 519</p>
<p>she indulged in two or three asides during her royal liaison, these
were venial incidents, mere grace notes in her song of love. She was not
romantic; rather she was too practical, making hay while her sun shone;
France condemned not her morals but her money. She was not like Francis’
mignons — pretty heads but empty, prancing on gay feet till motherhood
surprised them. Diane had good education, good sense, good manners, good
wit; here was a mistress who charmed with her mind.</p>
<p>She came of high lineage, and was brought up at the art-loving court
of the Bourbons at Moulins. Her father, Jean de Poitiers, Comte de
Saint-Val- lier, shared the Duke of Bourbon’s tr eason after trying to
prevent it; he was captured and sentenced to death (1523); Diane’s
husband, in favor with Francis, secured her father’s pardon.* Louis de
Breze was grandson of Charles VII by Agnes Sorel; he had ability or
influence, for he became Grant’ Seneschal and Governor of Normandy. He
was fifty-six when Diane, six- teen, became his wife (1515). When he
died (1531) she raised to his memory at Rouen a magnificent tomb with an
inscription vowing eternal fidelity. She never married again, and wore,
thereafter, only black and white.</p>
<p>She met Henry when, a lad of seven, he was being handed over at
Bayonne as a hostage for his father. The bewildered boy wept; Diane,
then twenty- seven, mothered and comforted him, whose own mother Claude
was two years dead; and perhaps the memory of those pitying embraces
revived in him when he met her again eleven years later. Though then
four years a husband, he was still mentally immature, as well as
abnormally melancholy and diffident; he wanted a mother more than a
wife; and here again Diane appeared, quiet, tender, comforting. He came
to her first as a son, and their relations for some time were apparently
chaste. Her affection and counsel gave him confidence; under her
tutelage he ceased to be a misanthrope, and prepared to be a king.
Popular opinion credited them with having one child, Diane de France,
whom she brought up with her two daughters by Breze; she also adopted
the daughter borne to Henry in 1538 by a Piedmontese maiden who paid for
her royal moment by a lifetime as a nun. Another illegitimate child
resulted from Henry’s later affair with Mary Fleming, governess of Mary
Stuart. Despite these experiments, his devotion was in- creasingly to
Diane de Poitiers. He wrote to her poems of real excellence; he showered
her with jewelry and estates. He did not entirely neglect Catherine;
usually he dined and spent the evenings with her; and she, grate- ful
for the parings of his love, accepted in silent sorrow the fact that
another woman was the real dauphiness of France. She must have felt it
as an added wound that Diane occasionally prodded Henry into sleeping
with his wife. 68</p>
<p>His accession to the throne did not lower Dia ne’s state. He wrote to
her</p>
<p>• There is no truth in the story, spread by Hugo in Le rot s’amuse ,
that Diane bought the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>520</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>the most abject letters, entreating her to let him be her servant for
life. His infatuation made her almost as rich as the Queen. He
guaranteed to Diane a fixed percentage of all receipts from the sale of
appointments to office, and nearly all appointments were in her power.
He gave her the crown jewels that the Duchesse d’Etampes had worn; when
the Duchess protested, Diane threatened to accuse her of Protestantism,
and was bought off only by a gift of property. Henry allowed her to keep
for her use 400,000 thalers that Francis had bequeathed for the secret
support of the Protestant princes in Germany. 69 So dowered, Diane
rebuilt, on a design by Philibert Delorme, the old Breze mansion of Anet
into an extensive chateau that became not only a second home for the
King but also a museum of art, and a handsome rendezvous for poets,
artists, diplomats, dukes, generals, cardinals, mistresses, and
philosophers. Here in effect sat the Privy Council of the state, and
Diane was prime ministress, passionless and intelligent. Every where —
at Anet, Chenonceaux, Amboise, the Louvre — dishes, coats of arms, works
of art, choir stalls, bore the bold symbol of the royal romance, two Ds
placed back to back, with a dash between them forming the letter H.
There is some- thing touching and beautiful about this unique
friendship, built on love and money, but enduring till death.</p>
<p>In the struggle of the Church against heresy, Diane put all her
influence behind orthodoxy and suppression. She had abundant reasons for
piety: her daughter was married to a son of Francis, Duke of Guise; and
Francis, with his brother Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, both favorites
at Anet, were the leaders of the Catholic party in France. As for Henry,
his childhood piety had been intensified by his years in Spain; his love
letters confused God and Diane as rivals for his heart. The Church was
helpful; it gave him 3,000,000 golden crowns for canceling his father’s
decree restricting the power of ec- clesiastical courts. 70</p>
<p>Nevertheless Protestantism was growing in France. Calvin and others
were sending in missionaries whose success was alarming. Several towns —
Caen, Poitiers, La Rochelle, and many in Provence — were predominantly
Huguenot by 1559; a priest reckoned the French Protestants in that year
at nearly a quarter of the population. 71 Says a Catholic historian:
“The source of the apostasy from Rome — ecclesiastical corruption — had
not been removed, nay, had on ly been strengthened, by the . . .
Concordat” between Leo X and Francis I. 72 In the middle and lower
classes Protestantism was in part a protest against a Catholic
government that curbed municipal auton- omy, taxed unbearably, and
wasted revenues and lives in war. The nobility, shorn of its former
political power by the kings, looked with envy at Lutheran princes
victorious over Charles V; perhaps a similar feudalism could be restored
in France by using widespread popular resentment against abuses in
Church and state. Prominent nobles like Gasoard de Coligny, his</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE 521</p>
<p>younger brother Francois d’Andelot, Prince Louis de Conde, and his
brother Antoine de Bourbon, took active part in organizing the
Protestant revolt.</p>
<p>For its theology Gallic Protestantism adopted Calvin’s Institutes;
its author and language were French, and its logic appealed to the
French mind. After 1550 Luther was almost forgotten in France; the very
name Huguenot came from Zurich through Geneva to Provence. In May 1559,
the Protestants felt strong enough to send deputies to their first
general synod, held secretly in Paris. By 1561 there were 2,000
“Reformed” or Calvinistic churches in France. 78</p>
<p>Henry II set himself to crush out the heresy. By his instructions
the</p>
<p>Parlement of Paris organized a special commission ( 1 549) to
prosecute dis- sent; those condemned were sent to the stake, and the new
court came to be called le chambre ardente, “the burning room.” By the
Edic t of Chateau- briand (1551) the printing, sale, or possession of
heretical literature was made a major crime, and persistence in
Protestant ideas was to be punished with death. Informers were to
receive a third of the goods of the condemned. They were to report to
the Parlement any judge who treated heretics leni- ently, and no man
could be a magistrate unless his orthodoxy was beyond doubt. In three
years the chambre ardente sent sixty Protestants to a flaming death.
Henry proposed to Pope Paul IV that the Inquisition should be es-
tablished in France on the new Roman model, but the Parlement objected
to allowing its authority to be superseded. One of its members, Anne du
Bourg, boldly suggested that all pursuit of heresy should cease until
the Council of Trent should complete its definitions of orthodox dogma.
Henry had him arrested, and vowed to see him burned, but fate cheated
the King of this spectacle.</p>
<p>For meanwhile he had been lured into renewing the war against the Em-
peror. He could never forgive the long imprisonment of his father, his
brother, and himself; he hated Charles with the same intensity with
which he loved Diane. When the Lutheran princes made their decisive
stand against the Emperor for Christ and feudalism, they sought alliance
with Henry, and invited him to seize Lorraine. So he agreed in the
Treaty of Chambord (1552). In a rapid and well-directed campaign he took
with little trouble Toul, Nancy, Metz, and Verdun. Charles, readier to
yield victory to Protes- tantism in Germany than to the Valois in
France, signed a humble peace with the princes at Passau, and hurried to
besiege the French in Metz. Francis, Duke of Guise, made his reputation
there by the skill and pertinacity of his defense. From October 19 to
December 26, 1552, the siege continued; then Charles, pale, haggard,
white-bearded, crippled, withdrew his disheartened troops. “I see very
well,” he said, “that fortune resembles a woman; she pre - fers a young
king to an old emperor.” 74 “Before three years are up,” he added, “I
shall turn Cordelier”— i.e., a Franciscan friar. 75</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>522</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>In 1555-56 he resigned his power in the Netherlands and Spain to his
son, signed the Truce of Vaucelles with France, and left for Spain
(September 17, 1556). He thought he was bequeathing to Philip a realm at
peace, but Henry felt that the situation called for another sally into
Italy. Philip had no reputation as a general; he was unexpectedly
plunged into war with Pope Paul IV; to Henry the opportunity seemed
golden. He sent Guise to take Milan and Naples, and himself prepared to
meet Philip on the ancient battle- fields of northeastern France. Philip
rose to the occasion. He borrowed a million ducats from Anton Fugger,
and charmed Queen Mary of England into the war. At Saint-Quentin (August
10, 1557) Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy led Philip’s combined armies
to an overwhelming victory, took Coligny and Montmorency prisoners, and
prepared to march upon Paris. The city was in panic; defense seemed
impossible. Henry recalled Guise and his troops from Italy; the Duke
crossed France, and by remarkable celerity of movement surprised and
captured Calais (1558), which England had held since 1348. Philip,
hating war and anxious to return to Spain, was readily persuaded to sign
the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis (April 2, 1559): Henry agreed to stay
north of the Alps, and Philip consented to let him keep Lorraine and —
over M ary’s tears— Calais. Suddenly the two kings be- came friends;
Henry gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Philip, and his sister
Marguerite of Berry was pledged to Emmanuel Philibert, who now recovered
Savoy; and a stately festival of jousts, banquets, and weddings was
arranged.</p>
<p>So, while cautious Philip remained in Flanders, French, Flemish, and
Spanish notables gathered around the royal palace of Les Tournelles in
Paris; lists were fenced off in the Rue St.-Antoine, with gaily
decorated stands and balconies; and all went merry as a wedding bell. On
June 22 the Duke of Alva, as proxy for Philip, received Elizabeth as new
Queen of Spain. Henry, now forty, insisted on entering the tournament.
In such jousts vic- tory was adjudged to the rider who, without being
unhorsed, broke three lances against the armor of his foe. Henry
accomplished this upon the Dukes of Guise and Savoy, who knew their
proper roles in the play. But a third opponent, Montgomery, after
breaking a lance against the King, awkwardly allowed the sharp- pointed
stump of the weapon to pass under Henry’s visor; it pierced the King’s
eye and reached the brain. For nine days he lay un - conscious. On July
9 the marriage of Philibert and Marguerite was cele- brated. On July 10
the King died. Diane de Poitiers retired to Anet, and survived seven
years. Catherine de Medicis, who had hungered for his love, wore
mourning all die rest of her life.</p>
