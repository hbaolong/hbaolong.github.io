<h4 id="chapter-xix-diderot-and-the-encyclopedic">CHAPTER XIX Diderot
and the Encyclopedic</h4>
<p>17 i 3-68</p>
<p>I. SHIFTLESS YEARS: 1713-48</p>
<p>H E was born on October 5, 1713, at Langres in Champagne, thirty-</p>
<p>eight miles from Dijon. His father, Didier Diderot, was a cutler</p>
<p>specializing in surgical instruments; the family had been engaged in
cutlery for two hundred years past. Denis did not i nherit his
forebears’ contented stability of occupation and belief, but he never
ceased to reverence his father’s simple honesty and quiet charity. “My
son, my son,” so Denis quoted him, “an excellent pillow is that of
reason, but I find that my head r ests still more softly on that of
religion and the laws”; 1 here in one sen - tence were the two voices of
eighteenth-century France. Another son be- came a priest, and a sworn
enemy to Denis. A sister entered a convent.</p>
<p>Denis himself verged on priesthood. From his eighth to his fifteenth
year he attended a Jesuit school in Langres; at twelve he was tonsured,
wore a black cassock, practiced asceticism, and resolved to become a
Jesuit. Later he explained this as an exube rance of his fluids: he had
mistaken “the first stimuli of a developing sexuality for the voice of
God.” 2 Didier rejoiced at his son’s new vocation, and gladly escorted
him to Paris (1729) to enroll him in the Jesuit College Louis-le-Grand.
There, in 1732, the youth re- ceived the master’s degree. But, as in
many cases, the Jesuits lost a novice by sharpening a mind. Denis
discovered that Paris had even more brothels than churches. He dropped
his cassock and piety and became a lawyer’s apprentice. Soon he
discarded the law and entered upon a decade of tran- sient occupations
and garret poverty. After long patience his father cut off his
allowance, but his mother sent him secret subsidies. Denis borrowed
money, and sometimes repaid. He tutored boys in mathematics, wrote ser-
mons for priests, and served as a bookseller’s hack. Meanwhile he con -
tinued his studies of mathematics, Latin, Greek, and English, and picked
up considerable Italian. He was lawless, but he was avid of knowledge
and life. He never learned discipline, but he learned nearly everything
else.</p>
<p>Purse empty, glands full, he fell in love and decided to marry.
Antoi- nette Champion was his senior by three years and eight months,
but she was</p>
<p>624</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xa woman. She reproached him with his libertine youth; he assured her
that this was a prelude to marital fidelity; he would be her faithful
mate forever. “It is to you that my last love letters are addressed, and
may heaven punish me as the most wicked of all men, the most traitorous
of all men, if ever in my life I write one to anyone else.”* His finest
letters violated this vow.</p>
<p>Arrived, he impressed his father by receiving there the proofs of his
translation from the English of a history of Greece. Didier offered to
sup- port him in any career Denis should choose; but some choice must be
made. The youth announced his eagerness to marry; the father upbraided
him as a shiftless ingrate; the son answered insolently, and vowed to
marry with or without paternal consent or coin. Didier had him
imprisoned in a local monastery. Denis escaped, walked ninety miles to
Troyes, caught a coach there, and returned to Paris.</p>
<p>But Mme. Champion was resolute; her daughter should not marry a man
severed from parents and patrimony. Diderot, living almost penniless in
a dingy room, fell seriously sick. Antoinette heard of this, rushed to
him, and dragged her mother with her; the mother’s resistance broke
down. To - gether they nursed the ailing philosopher; and on November 6,
1743, “Nanette” and her “Ninot” (as they called each other) were united
at mid - night in a little church that thrived on clandestine marriages.
Nine months later they rejoiced in the birth of a daughter, who, six
weeks later, died. Three other children came, of whom only one survived
childhood. An- toinette proved to be a faithful wife but an inadequate
companion, quite unable to follow her husband’s intellectual flights,
and volubly discontent with the petty income he made as a translator. He
returned to his bac- calaureate cafes, living on coffee, playing chess.
By 1746 he had taken a mistress, Mme. de Puisieux. For her he wrote his
Pensees philo sophiques , and Les Bijoux hidiscrets , and the Lettre snr
Ics aveugles.</p>
<p>He had long since succumbed to the fascination of philosophy — which
draws us ever onward because it never answers the questions that we
never cease to ask. Like most freethinkers of that century, he was
shaken to his intellectual roots by reading Montaigne and Bayle, finding
on nearly every page of the Essais and the Dictiounctire some arresting
thought. Perhaps through Montaigne’s rich references to the pagan
classics, he was drawn to further study of the Greek and Roman
philosophers — especially to Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius; he
himself was the “laughing phi - losopher” of his age, a materialist
bubbling with spirit. He could not afford</p>
<p>chap, xix ) diderot and the Encyclopedie 625</p>
<p>English readily, even to enjoy its poets and dramatists; we shall see
him responding to the sentiment of Thomson, and defending, like Lillo,
the drama of middle- class life. He was stirred by Francis Bacon’s call
to the conquest of nature by organized scientific research, and
proceeded to exalt experiment as the supreme tool of reason. He attended
— now in these for- mative years and again in preparing the Encyclopedie
— lectures on biology, physiology, and medicine; for three years he
followed the conferences of Rouelle on chemistry, taking 1,258 folio
pages of notes. He studied anat- omy and physics, and kept abreast of
the mathematics of his time. He went on from Bacon to Hobbes and Locke
and the English deists. He translated (1745) Shaftesbury’s Inquiry
concerning Virtue and Merit, adding “re - flections” of his own. He
continued through all vacillations to believe with Shaftesbury that the
good, the true, and the beautiful are near allied, and that a moral code
based on reason rather than religion can adequately serve social
order.</p>
<p>Bursting with all this stimulation, and with his own expansive
imagina- tion, he issued anonymously in 1746 his Fensees philosophiques.
It was suffi- ciently radical to be attributed to La Mettrie, and
eloquent enough to be ascribed to Voltaire; perhaps it owed something to
both. It began with a defense of the “passions.” Here the intrepid
reasoner, agreeing with his friend Rousseau, argued that no harm would
be done if philosophy should “say a word in favor of reason’s rivals,
since it is only the passions [les grandes passions] that can raise the
soul to great things. Without the pas- sions there would be nothing
sublime, either in morals or in works; the arts would return to their
infancy, and virtue would be limited to petty deeds.” 4 But passions
without order would be destructive; some harmony must be established
among them; a way must be found by which one may check the other. Hence
we need reason, and must make this our supreme guide. Here was an early
attempt of the Enlightenment to reconcile reason with feel- ing,
Voltaire with Rousseau.</p>
<p>Like Voltaire, Diderot was in this first period of his development a
deist. The evidences of design compel belief in an intelligent deity.
Mechanism can explain matter and motion but not life or thought. The
future atheist challenged the atheist to explain the marvels of insect
life recently displayed in the researches of Reaumur and Bonnet.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed in the reasoning or actions of any man more</p>
<p>intelligence, order, sagacity, consistency, than in the mechanism
of</p>
<p>an insect? Is not the Divinity as clearly imprinted in the eye of a
gnat as the faculty of thought is in the works of the great Newton?…</p>
<p>Just think that I objected to you only the w ing of the butterfly and
the eye of a gnat, when I could have crushed you with the weight of the
tniverse ! 5</p>
<p>626</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XNevertheless Diderot rejected with scorn the God revealed in the
Bible; that deity seemed to him a monster of cruelty, and the Church
that spread this conception was denounced by him as a fountainhead of
ignorance, in- tolerance, and persecution. Could anything be more absurd
than a God who makes God die on the Cross in order to appease the anger
of God against a woman and a man four thousand years dead? And “if,” as
some theologians reckoned, “there are a thousand damned for every soul
saved, then the Devil wins the argument, and without abandoning his son
to death.” Diderot recognized no other divine revelation than nature
itself, and he pleaded with his readers to rise to a conception of deity
worthy of the universe that science had revealed. “ Blargissez Dieu /”
he demanded. “Enlarge and liberate God!” 6</p>
<p>The Parlement of Paris ordered the book to be burned by the public
ex- ecutioner on the charge of “presenting to restless and bold minds
the most absurd and most criminal thoughts of which the depravity of
human nature is capable, and of placing all religions, by an affected
uncertainty, nearly on the same level in order to end up by not
recognizing any.” 7 Advertised by the burning (July 7, 1746), the little
volume found an unexpected num- ber of readers. It was translated into
German and Italian; and when it was whispered about that Diderot was the
author, he rose at once to a place near Voltaire. He received fifty
louis from the publisher; these he turned over to his mistress, who
needed new clothes.</p>
<p>As Mme. de Puisieux’ wants expanded, Diderot wrote another book
(1747). The parish priest heard of it, and begged the police to protect
Christianity from this second assault. They surprised the author in his
home and confiscated the manuscript; or, some say, they contented
themselves with his promise not to publish it. In any case the Promenade
du sceptique remained unprinted till 1830. It could not add to his fame,
but it relieved his feelings. Using th e philosopher’s favorite dodge,
the dialogue, he al - lowed a deist, a pantheist, and an atheist to
expound their views of divinity. The deist repeats with vigor the
argument from design; Diderot was not yet convinced that the remarkable
adaptation of means to ends in organ- isms could be explained by a blind
process of fortuitous evolution. The atheist insists that matter and
motion, physics and chemistry, are a better explanation of the universe
than a deity who merely postpones the problem of origin. The pantheist,
who has the last word, holds that mind and matter are co-eternal, that
together they constitute the universe, and that this cosmic unity is
God. Perhaps Diderot had been reading Spinoza.</p>
<p>The year 1748 was exciting and laborious. Antoinette had borne a son,
and Mme. de Puisieux was demanding the emoluments of adultery. Prob-
ably to raise money quickly, Diderot now wrote a licentious novel, Les
Bijoux indiscrets. According to his daughter, the future Mme. de
Vandeul</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>diderot and the Encyclopedic</p>
<p>(whose Memoir es pour servir a F histoire de la vie et des ouvrages
de Diderot cannot be trusted without corroboration), he had remarked to
his mistress that writing a novel was a comparatively simple matter. She
chal- lenged the statement; he wagered that he could turn out a
successful novel in a fortnight. Obviously imitating the younger
Crebillon’s Le Sopha</p>
<p>(1740), where a sofa recounted the amours under which it had groaned,
Diderot imagined a sultan’s magic ring which, when pointed to the “in -
discreet jewels” of a woman’s person, caused them to confess their
experi - ences. As the ring was turned upon thirty ladies, the interest
of the two volumes seldom flagged. The author mingled with the ribaldry
some pro- vocative remarks on music, literature, and the theater, and
added a dream in which the sultan sees a child called “Experiment” grow
larger and</p>
<p>stronger until it destroys an old temple called “Hypothesis.” Despite
these intrusions of philosophy, the book realized its aim: it made
money. The publisher Laurent Durand paid Diderot twelve hundred livres
for the manuscript, and though the volumes could be sold only “under the
counter,” they proved remunerative. Six French editions were printed in
1748; ten editions appeared in France between 1920 and i960. “ Les
Bijoux… is Diderot’s most published work.” 8</p>
<p>He varied his mood by composing scientific treatises. He valued
highly his Memoir es sur differents sujets de mathematique (1748), which
con- tained learned and original discourses on acoustics, tension, air
resistance, and “a project for a new organ” that anyone could play. Some
of the essays won high praise from The Gentleman’ s Magazine and the
journal des savants, even from the Jesuit journal de Trevoux, which
invited more of such researches “on the part of a man as clever and able
as M. Diderot seems to be, of whom we should also observe that his style
is as elegant, trenchant, and unaffected as it is lively and ingenious.”
9 Diderot continued throughout his life to make such desultory sallies
into physical science, but he leaned increasingly to problems of
psychology and philosophy. And in almost every field he was the most
original thinker of his time.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">

</ol>
<p>He was especially attracted by a question which the Irishman William
Molyneux had raised about 1692: Will a man born blind who has learned to
distinguish a cube from a sphere by touch, be able, if his sight is re-
stored, to differentiate at once a cube from a sphere, or will he
require, before he can make this distinction, some experience of the
relations be- tween forms touched and the same forms seen? The latter
answer had been given by Molyneux and his friend Locke. In 1728 Willian
Cheselden op-</p>
<p>6z8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xerated successfully upon a fourteen-year-old boy who had been blind
from birth; the boy had to be trained before he could differentiate
forms by sight alone. Diderot noted also the career of Nicholas
Saunderson, who had lost his sight at the age of one and had never
recovered it, but, by mak- ing for himself a kind of mathematical
Braille, had acquired such profi- ciency as to be appointed professor of
mathematics at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Early in 1749 Reaumur invited a select group to see what would happen
when the bandages were removed from the eyes of a woman who had un-
dergone an operation to cure her congenital blindness. Diderot was
piqued that neither he nor any other of the philosophes had been
included in the invitation, and with his usual recklessness he suggested
that Reaumur had arranged to have the unveiling take pl ace before
“certain eyes of no con - sequence.” 10 According to Diderot’s daughter
this phrase offended Alme. Dupre de Saint-Maur, who prided herself on
her eyes, and who was the current mistress of the current directeur de
la librairie, or chief censor of publications, the Comte d’Argenson
(Marc Pierre, younger brother of Rene Louis, the Marquis).</p>
<p>On June 9 Durand published Diderot’s Lettre stir les aveugles a 1 ’
usage de ceux qui voient ( Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those Who
See). It took the form of a letter addressed to Mine, de Puisieux. It
began with an account of the visit that Diderot and some friends had
made to a blind winegrower. They were struck by the sense of order shown
by the blind man — a sense so sure that his wife relied on him at night
to put back in its proper place everything disturbed during the day. All
his surviving senses were keener than those of normal men. “The
smoothness of the flesh has [for him] no less subtle nuances than the
sound of the voice, and there is no fear that he will mistake another
woman for his wife, unless he gains by the exchange.” 11 He could not
understand how one could know a face without touching it. His sense of
beauty was confined to tactile values, pleasantness of voice, and
utility. He had no shame in nudity, since he thought of clothing as a
protection against weather, not as a concealment of the body from
others’ eyes. Theft he considered a major crime, because he was so
helpless against it.</p>
<p>Diderot concluded that our ideas of right and wrong are derived not
from God but from our sensory experience. Even the idea of God has to be
learned, and it too, like morality, is relative and diverse. The
existence of God is doubtful, for the argument from design has lost much
of its force. Yes, there are evidences of design in many organisms and
organs, as in the fly and the eye; but there is no sign of design in the
universe as a whole, for some parts are hindrances — if not fatal
enemies — to other parts; almost every organism is bound to be eaten by
another. The eye seems a wonderful instance of adjustment of means to
ends, but there are gross</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>diderot and the Encyclopedie</p>
<p>629</p>
<p>imperfections in it (as Helmholtz would later point out in detail).
There is a creative spontaneity in nature, but it is half blind, and
runs to much disorder and waste. Pretending to quote from a “Life and
Character of Dr. Nicholas Saunderson” by Willi am Inchlif (who
apparently never</p>
<p>existed), Diderot made the blind professor say, “Why talk to me of
all that fine spectacle which has never been made for me?… If you want
me to believe in God you must make me touch him.” 12 In the imaginary
biog - raphy Saunderson rejected God,* and attributed the order of the
universe to a natural selection of organs and organisms by the survival
of the fittest.</p>
<p>All defective combinations of matter have disappeared, and only</p>
<p>hose remained in which the mechanism implied no important con-
tradiction, and which could subsist bv their own means and reproduce
themselves…. Even now the order of the world is not so perfect</p>
<p>but that monstrous products appear from time to time…. What is</p>
<p>his world? A composite subject to revolutions all of which indicate a
persistent tendency to destruction, a rapid succession of beings that
follow each other, push each other, and disappear.™</p>
<p>Diderot concluded with agnosticism: “Alas, madame, when we put human
knowledge in the balance of Montaigne, we shall not be far from
accepting his motto. For what do we know? Of the nature of matter,
nothing. Of the nature of mind or thought, still less, nothing
whatever.” 1 ’ 1</p>
<p>All in all, this Lettre sur les aveugles is one of the outstanding
produc- tions of the French Enlightenment. It is fascinating as a
narrative, brilliantly perceptive as psychology, imaginatively
suggestive as philosophy, tiresome only toward the end of its sixty
pages. It contains some indelicacies, hardly in place in an epistle
supposedly addressed to a lady; but perhaps Mme. de Puisieux was
accustomed to Diderot’s mixture of plebeian frankness with erudite
discourse. For good measure the essay included a detailed proposal for
what later took the name of Louis Braille. 1,1</p>
<p>Voltaire, who was then (1749) in Paris, wrote to Diderot an
enthusiastic commendation of the Lettre :</p>
<p>I have read with extreme pleasure your book, which says much</p>
<p>and suggests more. For a long time I have esteemed you as much as I
despise the stupid barbarians who condemn what they do not under-
stand….</p>
<p>But I confess that I am not at all of the opinion of Saunderson,</p>
<p>who denies a God because he was born blind. Perhaps I am mistaken,
but in his place I should have recognized a very intelligent Being,</p>
<p>who had given me so manv supplements to sight….</p>
<p>According to his friends Saunderson died a pious death. The Royal
Society of London resented Diderot’s ascript ion of atheism to one of
its members; and it never admitted him to corresponding membership.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XI desire passionately to converse with you, no matter whether
you</p>
<p>hink you are one of his works or whether you think you are a nicely
organized portion of an eternal and necessary matter. Before my de-
parture from Luneville I should like you to give me the honor of tak-
ing a philosophical dinner with me, at my house, together with several
sages.</p>
<p>Diderot replied (June 1 1 ) :</p>
<p>The moment when I received your letter, monsieur et cher maitre,</p>
<p>was one of the happiest of my life.</p>
<p>Saunderson’s opinion is no more mine than yours…. I believe</p>
<p>in God, but I get along very well with atheists…. It is very im-</p>
<p>portant not to mistake hemlock for parsley, but not at all important
whether or not you believe in God. The world, said Montaigne, is a</p>
<p>ball that he has abandoned to the philosophers to bat around… 16</p>
<p>Before anything could come of this correspondence Diderot was
arrested. The government, angered by public criticism of the humiliating
Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, put several of its critics in jail, and
thought it time to check Diderot. Whether the atheism lurking in the
Lettre had brought protests from the clergy, or whether Mme. Dupre de
Saint-Maur, resent- ing Diderot’s remark about “inconsequential eyes,”
had prodded her lover to action, we do not know. In any case the Comte
d’Argenson sent a lettre de cachet (July 23, 1749) to the Marquis du
Chatelet, governor of the Fortress of Vincennes: “Receive in the Chateau
de Vincennes the man Diderot, and hold him there until a further order
from me.” 17 Early the next morning the police knocked at Did erot’s
door. They searched his rooms and found two or three unbound copies of
the Lettre sur les aveugles, plus boxes of material that Diderot was
preparing for the epochal En- cyclopedic. They carried him off to
Vincennes (on the outskirts of Paris), where he was lodged solitary in a
cell of the gloomy castle. He was allowed to keep with him a book which
he had had in his pocket when arrested — Paradise Lost. He now had
leisure to read it carefully. He annotated it in no orthodox spirit, and
used its vacant pages for writing down some thoughts on less godly
topics. He made ink by scraping slate from the walls, grinding it, and
mixing it with wine. A toothpick served him for a pen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his wife, left desolate with her three-year-old son,
hurried to Police Lieutenant General Berryer, and implored him to
release her husband. She disclaimed any knowledge of his writings. “All
I know is that his writings must resemble his conduct. He esteems honor
a thousand times dearer than life, and his works reflect the virtues he
practices.” 18</p>

<p>631</p>
<p>If Antoinette knew nothing about Mme. de Puisieux, the police
did.</p>
<p>More effective was a plea from the men who had already engaged</p>
<p>Diderot to edit an encyclopedia; they assured the Comte d’Argenson
that</p>
<p>In August — just a month before her death — Mme. du Chatelet, presum-
ably at Voltaire’s urging, wrote from Luneville to her kinsman the gov -
ernor of Vincennes, and begged him at least to mitigate the conditions
of Diderot’s imprisonment. About August 10 Berryer offered to let the
pris - oner enjoy the freedom and comforts of the castle’s great hall,
with</p>
<p>permission to receive books and visitors, if he would make an honest
confession. On August 13 the chastened philosopher addressed to Berryer
the following document:</p>
<p>I admit to you… that the Pensees, the Bijoux, and the Lettre</p>
<p>sur les aveugles are debaucheries of the mind that escaped from me;
but I can… promise you on my honor (and I do have honor) that</p>
<p>hey will be the last, and that they are the only ones…. As for</p>
<p>hose who have taken part in the publication of these works, nothing
will be hidden from you. I shall depose verbally, in the depths [se-</p>
<p>crecy] of your heart, the names both of the publishers and of the</p>
<p>printers. 19</p>
<p>On August 20 he was released from his cell, was promoted to a com-
fortable room, and was allowed to receive visitors and to walk in the
gardens of the chateau. On the twenty-first he signed a promise not to
leave the building or its grounds without official permission. His wife
came to comfort and upbraid him, and his old love for her revived.
D’Alembert came, and Rousseau, and Mme. de Puisieux. The entrepreneurs
of the En- cyclopedic brought him manuscripts, and he resumed his
editorial work. Learning that his brother had told his father of his
arrest, he wrote to the ailing cutler, claimed that his incarceration
was due to a woman’s spite, and asked for financial aid. The father
answered in a letter (September 3,</p>

<p>He was released on November 3, 1749, after three and a half months of
imprisonment. He went home happy to his wife and child, and for a time
he forgot Mme. de Puisieux. But on June 30, 1750, his son, aged four,
died of a violent fever. A third child, born soon afterward, w T as
badly injured at its baptism, being dropped to the floor of the church
by an attendant; it died before the year was out. Three births, three
deaths. Diderot went back to his evenings at the Cafe Procope. About
1750 Rousseau introduced him to Friedrich Melchior Grimm, and there
began a triune friendship of</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>DIDEROT AND THE EflCyclopedk</p>
<p>633</p>
<p>some importance to literature. This was the year in which Voltaire
aban- doned France for Berlin, Rousseau wrote his prize-winning essay on
civili- zation as a disease, and Diderot’s prospectus announced the
Encyclopedic.</p>
<p>While working on the first volume of this project he digressed into
an- other psychological inquiry, whose results he published (1751) in a
Lettre sur les sourds et muets a P usage de ceux qui entendent et qui
parlent ( Let- ter on the Deaf and Dumb, for the Use of Those Who Hear
and Who Speak). Not yet having forgotten Vincennes, he avoided heresy,
and re- ceived from the censor (now the kindly Malesherbes) “tacit
permission” to publish the essay in France without his name and without
fear of prose- cution. Diderot proposed to ask questions of a deaf-mute,
to observe the gestures with which the deaf-mute answered, and to
illuminate thereby the origin of language through gestures. A great
actor (for Diderot was already pregnant with his Paradox of the Actor )
sometimes conveys a thought or a feeling more effectively through a
gesture or a facial expression than through words. The first words were
probably vocal gestures — sounds illus- trative of the idea in mind. In
poets the word chosen has not only an intel- lectual denotation, or
meaning, but also a symbolic connotation, or nuance; it has visual
implications (e.g., compare see and gaze ) or overtones of sound
(compare say and murmur’)-, hence real poetry is untranslatable.</p>
<p>As usual in Diderot, the discourse is vacillating and disorderly, but
rich in suggestive asides. “My idea would be to decompose a man, so to
speak, and to consider what he derives from each of his senses”
(Condillac later [ 1754] built his Traite des sensations around this
notion). Or again, contrast poetry with painting: the poet can narrate
events, the painter can show only one moment: his picture is a gesture,
which tries to express at once past, present, and future; here was one
germ of Lessing’s Laokoon (1766).</p>
<p>But by this time the first volume of the Encyclopedic was ready
for</p>
<p>publication.</p>

</ol>
<p>The Encyclopedie, said the Roman Catholic critic Brunetiere, “is
the</p>
<p>great affair of its time, the goal to which everything preceding it
was tending, the origin of everything that has followed it, and
consequently the true center for any history of ideas in the eighteenth
century.” 21 “It be - longed only to a philosophic al century to attempt
an encyclopedia,” said Diderot. 22 The work of Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes,
Locke, Berkeley, Spinoza, Bayle, and Leibniz in philosophy; the advances
made in science by Copernicus, Vesalius, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes,
Huygens, and New- ton; the exploration of the earth by navigators,
missionaries, and travelers,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xand the rediscovery of the past by scholars and historians: all this
mount- ing knowledge and speculation waited to be put in order for
public ac- cessibility and use.</p>
<p>Chambers’ Cyclopoedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and
Sciences (1728) seemed at first to meet this need. In 1743 a Paris
publisher, Andre Frangois Le Breton, proposed to have it translated into
French, with changes and additions suited to French needs. The project
grew until it aimed at ten volumes. To meet the expense Le Breton took
into partner- ship, for this undertaking, three other publishers —
Briasson, David, and Durand. They engaged the Abbe de Gua de Malves as
editor, obtained a license to print with the privilege du roi, and
issued (1745) a tentative prospectus. In December they or Gua de Malves
enlisted the aid of Diderot and d’Alembert. In 1 747 Gua de Malves
withdrew, and on October 1 6 the publishers appointed Diderot editor in
chief, with a salary of 144 livres per month, and asked d’Alembert to
take charge of the articles on mathe - matics.</p>
<p>As the work proceeded Diderot became increasingly dissatisfied with
the Chambers text. We can measure this by his giving fifty-six columns
to anatomy, which in Chambers had received one, and fourteen columns to
agriculture, which in Chambers had rated thirty-six lines. Finally
he</p>
<p>recommended that Chambers’ book be put aside, and that an entirely
new encyclopedia be prepared. (Malves may have already suggested this.)
The publishers agreed, and Diderot (not yet the heretical author of the
Letter on the Blind) persuaded the earne stly orthodox Chancellor
d’Aguesseau to extend the privilege du roi to the extended enterprise
(April, 1748).</p>
<p>But how was this to be financed? Le Breton reckoned it would cost</p>
<p>wo million livres; actually it cost less — some 1,140,000; even so
there must have been many doubts about securing sufficient subscribers
to warrant going to press. Diderot had already commissioned many
articles — and se- cured some — for the first volumes when his
imprisonment at Vincennes interrupted the work. Released, he gave all
his time to it, and in Novem- ber, 1750, the publishers sent out eight
thousand copies of a prospectus written by Diderot. (In 1950 the French
government reprinted this in na- tional commemoration of the event.) It
announced that a company of well- known men of letters, experts, and
specialists proposed to gather existing knowledge of the arts and
sciences into an orderly whole, alphabetically arranged, and fitted with
cross references that would facilitate use by scholars and students.
“The word encyclopedie said the prospectus, “sig - nifies the
interrelationship of the sciences”; literally it meant instruction, or
learning, gathered in a circle. Not only had knowledge grown im-
mensely, said Diderot, but the need for its dissemination was urgent; it
would be of no use if not shared. All this, according to the prospectus,
was</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>diderot and the Encyclopedie</p>
<p>635</p>
<p>o be compressed into eight volumes of text and two of plates.
Subscrip- tions were solicited, at 280 livres for the set, payable in
nine installments. The whole was to be completed in two years. In our
hindsight this pro- spectus appears as one of the first announcements
that the reign of science had begun, and that a new faith had been
offered for the salvation of mankind.</p>
<p>The response to the prospectus was inspiring, especially from the
upper middle class. After Mme. Geoffrin’s death it was disclosed that
she and her husband had contributed over 500,000 livres to the expenses
of the Encyclopedie. 23 With this work in France, and Johnson’s
Dictionary (1755) in England, European literature declared its
independence of aris- tocrats and servile dedications, and addressed
itself to the larger public whose eye and voice it proposed to be. The
Encyclopedie was the most famous of all experiments in the
popularization of knowledge. 24</p>
<p>The first volume appeared on June 28, 1751. It contained 914
large</p>
<p>double-columned folio pages. The frontispiece, engraved by Charles
Cochin, was typical of the eighteenth century: it showed humanity grop-
ing for knowledge, which was represented by a beautiful woman in diaph-
anous gauze. The title was impressive: Encyclopedie, ou Dictionnaire
raisonne des sciences , des arts, et des metiers, par line Societe de
gens de lettres. Mise en ordre et publiee par M. Diderot,… et quant a la
partie mathematique par M. d Alembert. .. Avec approbation et privilege
du Roi. The volume was judiciously dedicated to “ Monseigneur le comte d
Argenson, ministre et secretaire d’etat et de guerre.” It was not
encyclo - pedic in our present sense: it did not propose to include
biographies or history; but some biographies, strangely enough, were
given under the birthplace of the person. On the other hand, it was in
part a dictionary, defining many terms, listing synonyms, and giving
grammatical rules.</p>
<p>The most memorable part of Volume I was the “Discours preliminaire.”
D’Alembert was chosen to write this because he was known both as a
leading scientist and as a master of French prose. Despite these
distinctions he was living in stoic poverty in Paris. When Voltaire
described the ma- jestic view from Les Delices, d’Alembert replied: “You
write to me from your bed, whence you command ten leagues of lake, and I
answer you from my hole, whence I command a patch of sky three ells
long.” 25 He was an agnostic, but he had not joined in any public
criticism of the Church. In the “Discours” he tried to disarm
ecclesiastical opposition:</p>
<p>The nature of man is an impenetrable mystery when one is en-</p>
<p>lightened by reason alone. We can say the same of our existence</p>
<p>present and future, of the essence of the Being ter whom we owe it,
and of the kind of worship he requires from us. Hence nothing is</p>
<p>636</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xmore necessary to us than a revealed religion which instructs us in
such diverse subjects. 26</p>
<p>He apologized to Voltaire for these obeisances: “Such phrases as
these are</p>
<p>Following a proposal by Francis Bacon, the “Discours
preliminaire”</p>
<p>classified all knowledge according to the mental faculty involved. So
his- tory came under “Memory,” science under “Philosophy,” and theology
under “Reason”; literature and art came under “Imagination.” Diderot and
d’Alembert were quite proud of this scheme, and made from it, as a
folded insert after the “Discours,” a chart of knowledge which evoked
great ad - miration in its day. Next to Bacon’s, the strongest influence
in the En - cy clopedic was that of Locke. “It is to sensations that we
owe all our</p>
<p>ideas,” said the “Discours.” From this statement the editors hoped,
in the course of the eight volumes, to deduce an entire philosophy: a
natural religion that would reduce God to an initial push, a natural
psychology that would make mind a function of the body, and a natural
ethic that would define virtue in terms of man’s duties to man rather
than to God. This program was cautiously implied in the “Discours.”</p>
<p>From these first pri nciples d’Alembert passed on to survey the
history of science and philosophy. He praised the ancients, deprecated
the Middle Ages, and rejoiced in the Renaissance.</p>
<p>We should be unjust if we failed to recognize our debt to Italy.</p>
<p>It is from her that we have received the sciences w hich later
produced such abundant fruit in all Europe; it is to her above all that
we owe the bectnx-arts and good taste of which she has furnished us with
so great a number of inimitable models. 28</p>
<p>The heroes of modern thought came in for laurels:</p>
<p>At the head of these illustrious personages should be placed the im-
mortal Chancellor of England, Francis Bacon, whose w orks, so justly
esteemed,… deserve our study even more than our praise. When</p>
<p>we consider the sane and spacious views of this great man, the multi-
tude of subjects surveyed by his mind, the boldness of his style — which
everywhere combined the most sublime images with the most rigorous
precision — we are tempted to regard him as the greatest, the most uni-
versal, and the most eloquent of philosophers. 29</p>
<p>D’Alembert proceeded to show how the profound genius of Descartes, so
fertile in mathematics, had been hampered in philosophy by religious
persecution:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>diderot and the Encyclopedic</p>
<p>637</p>
<p>Descartes at least dared to show to alert minds how to free them-</p>
<p>selves from the yoke of Scholasticism, opinion, authority — in a
word, from prejudice and barbarism; and by this revolt, of which we
today gather the fruits, he rendered to philosophy a service perhaps
more difficult than all those that it owes to his renowned successors.
We</p>
<p>may regard him as the chief of a sworn band, who had the courage to
lead a revolt against a despotic and arbitrary pow er, and who, by his
inspiring resolution, raised the foundations of a government more just
and benevolent than any that he could live to see established. If he</p>
<p>finished by thinking to explain everything, he at least began by
doubt- ing all; and the weapons that we must use to combat him are not
the less his own because we turn them against him.</p>
<p>After discussing Newton, Locke, and Leibniz, d’Alembert concluded</p>
<p>with an expression of faith in the beneficent effects of knowledge
grow- ing and spread ing. “Our century belieyes itself destined to
change the laws in every kind.” 80 Warmed with that hope, d’Alembert
made his “Discours” one of the masterpieces of eighteenth-century French
prose. Buffon and Montesquieu joined in praising those introductory
pages; Raynal rated them as “one of the most philosophical, logical,
luminous, exact, compact, and best- written pieces that we have in our
language.” 81</p>
<p>Volume I was not visibly antireligious. The articles on Christian
doc-</p>
<p>rine and ritual were almost orthodox; several of them pointed out
diffi- culties, but they usually ended with a solemn obeisance to the
Church. Quite often there were heretical asides and incidental attacks
upon super- stition and fanaticism, but these w ere hidden in articles
on apparently in- nocent subjects like the Scythian lamb or the eagle;
so the piece headed “Agnus scythicus” expanded into a treatise on
evidence which left the be - lief in miracles in an unhapp y state; and
the article “Aigle,” after discus - sing popular credulity, concluded
with transparent irony: “Happy the people whose religion asks it to
believe only things true, holy, and sublime, and to imitate only
virtuous actions. Such a religion is ours, in which the philosopher has
only to follow’ his reason to arrive at the feet of our al - tars.” 32
Slyly, here and there, the bubbles of myth and legend w^ere pricked, and
a spirit of rationalist humanism emerged.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Jesuits gave the volume a friendly reception.
Guillaume Frangois Berthier, the learned editor of the Journal de
Trevoux , politely objected to the stress laid upon heretical
philosophers in the “Discours preliminaire”; he pointed out inaccuracies
and plagiarisms, and asked for stricter censorship of future volumes;
but he praised the Encyclopedic as a “very lofty, very solid enterprise,
whose editors, when it is completed, will justly be able to apply to
themselves the Horatian claim, Exegi monumentum aere perenni us.” And he
added: “No one is more disposed to recognize the</p>
<p>638 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xfine sections of the Encyclopedic; we shall review them with
complaisance in our extracts to come.” 33</p>
<p>Another priest was not so lenient. Jean Frangois Boyer, former bishop
of Mirepoix, complained to the King that the authors had deceived the
censors. Louis sent him to Malesherbes, who had recently become chief
censor of publication ( directeur de la librairie). Malesherbes promised
that future volumes would be more carefully screened; but during his
tenure of various governmental offices he used all his influence to
protect the philosophes. It was fortunate for the rebels that this
Chretien Guillaume de Malesherbes, who had been made a skeptic by
reading Bayle, and who had written a book, La Liberte de la presse, was
censor of publica- tions from 1750 to 1763 — the most critical period in
the lives of Voltaire, Diderot, Helvetius, and Rousseau. “In a century
in which every citizen can speak to the entire nation by means of
print,” Malesherbes wrote, “those who have the talent for instructing
men or the gift of moving them — in a word, men of letters — are, amid a
dispersed people, what the orators of Rome and Athens were in the midst
of a people assembled.” 34 He fos - tered the intellectual movement by
granting permission tacite to books that could not, even in his regime,
receive the approbation et privilege du roi. For in his view “a man who
ha d read only the books that… ap- peared with the express consent of
the government… would be behind his contemporaries by almost a century.”
35</p>
<p>This happy moment for the Encyclopedic was ended by one of the most
curious incidents in the history of the Enlightenment. On November 18,
1751, Jean Martin de Prades, seeking a degree at the Sorbonne, offered
to the theologians an apparently innocuous thesis — “Qwe/ est celui sur
la face duquel Dieu a repandu le souffle de la vie?” (Who is he over w
hose face God spread the breath of life? ) While the examining pundits
nodded or slept, the young abbe, in excellent Latin, exposed
chronological con- flicts in the Bible, reduced the miracles of Christ
to a level with those of Aesculapius, and replaced revelation with a
natural and liberal theology. The Sorbonne accepted the thesis and
granted the degree. The Jansenists, now controlling the Parlement of
Paris, denounced the Sorbonne; a rumor went about that Diderot had had a
hand in the thesis; the Sorbonne re- voked the degree, and ordered the
abbe’s arrest. De Prades fled to Prussia, where he was lodged by
Voltaire until he succeeded La Mettrie as reader to Frederick the
Great.</p>
<p>The guardians of orthodoxv were shocked to find that this same Prades
had contributed the article “Certitude” to Volume II of the Encyclo
-</p>
<p>pedic, which appeared in January, 1752. This article also had a tang
of Diderot in it. The outcry against the undertaking mounted. Berthier,
while praising the volume for its many contributions to knowledge,
rebuked the</p>
<p>chap, xix) diderot and the Encyclopedie 6 39</p>
<p>editors for a piece in which it was said that most men honor
literature as they do religion — i.e., “as something they can neither
know nor practice nor love.” Such a statement, said the Jesuit, deserved
“the greatest atten - tion on the part of the authors and the editors of
the Encyilopedie, in order that henceforth nothing similar be inserted
in it.” 36 On January 3 1 Chris - tophe de Beaumont, archbishop of
Paris, condemned the Encyclopedie as a subtle attack upon religion; and
on February 7 a decree of the Council of State forbade any further sale
or publication of the work. On that day the Marquis d’Argenson wrote in
his journal:</p>
<p>This morning appeared an arret du conseil which had not been fore-
seen: it suppressed the Dictiormaire ertcy elope dique, with some ap-
palling allegations, such as revolt against God and the royal authority,
[and] corruption of morals… It is said on this score that the</p>
<p>authors of this dictionary… must shortly be put to death. 37</p>
<p>It was not as bad as that. Diderot was not arrested, but nearly all
the material that he had gathered was confiscated by the government.
Vol- taire wrote from Potsdam urging Diderot to transfer the enterprise
to Ber- lin, where it could proceed under Frederick’s protection; but
Diderot was helpless without his material, and Le Breton was hopeful
that the govern- ment, after the storm had subsided, would modify its
prohibition. Males- herbes, the Marquis d’Argenson, and Mme. de
Pompadour supported Le Breton’s appeal to the Council; and in the spring
of 1752 it consented to the publication of further volumes with “tacit
permission.” Mme. de Pompadour advised d’Alembert and Diderot to resume
their work, “ob - serving a necessary reserve in all things touching
religion and authority.” 38 To appease the clergy, Malesherbes agreed
that all future volumes should be censored by three theologians chosen
by ex-bishop Boyer.</p>
<p>Volumes III to VI appeared at yearly intervals, 1753-56, all
subjected to strict censorship. The furor had given the Encyclopedie
wide publicity and had made it the symbol of liberal ideas; the number
of subscribers rose to 3,100 with Volume III, 4,200 with Volume IV.</p>
<p>D’Alembert emerged from the ordeal somewhat shaken. To secure his
personal safety he stipulated that henceforth he would be responsible
only for the mathematical articles. Diderot, however, was for fighting
the cen- sorship. On October 12, 1752, he published, ostensibly at
Berlin and in the name of de Prades, a Suite de Fapologie [Continuation
of the Defense] de M. I’abbe de Prades. Referring to a recent episcopal
denunciation of the</p>
<p>I know nothing so indecent, and so injurious to religion, as
these</p>
<p>vague declamations against reason on the part of some
theologians.</p>
<p>640</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XOne would say, to hear them, that men cannot enter into the bosom of
Christianity except as a flock of beasts enters a stable, and that one
has to renounce common sense to embrace our religion or to persist in
it. To establish such principles, I repeat, is to reduce man to the</p>
<p>level of the brute, and place falsehood and truth on an equal
footing.* 9</p>
<p>He continued in Volume III the indirect attacks upon
Christianity,</p>
<p>usually covering them with professions of orthodoxy. His article
“Sacred</p>
<p>Volume III won much praise, tempered by criticism from the Jesuits
and Elie Freron’s Annee litter aire. New contributors raised the
prestige of the work: Duclos began to take part with Volume IV, Voltaire
and Turgot with Volume V, Necker and Quesnay with Volume VI. During the
first four years of the undertaking Voltaire had been absorbed or
embroiled in Germany; now (1755), settled in Geneva, he sent in the
articles “Ele - gance,” “Eloquence,” and “Esprit” (Intelligence)— all
graced with elegance, eloquence, and esprit. Diderot himself wrote for
Volume VI an article, “Encyclopedia,” which some scholars have rated the
best piece in the whole work. It was certainly one of the longest,
running to 34,000 words. He told of the difficulties the enterprise had
faced, not only from forces aiming at its destruction, but also from
restricted funds inadequate to pay contribu- tors and printers, and from
the human frailties of authors harassed in health and cramped for time.
He admitted the many defects of the first five volumes, which had been
produced in haste and trepidation; he promised improvement, and with
some feeling he made his own act of faith:</p>

<p>He thought of the Encyclopedic as a blow for posterity, and trusted
that posterity would vindicate him. He imagined “some great revolution
that has suspended the progress of the sciences and the work of the
[industrial] arts, and has replunged into darkness a part of the world,”
and he warmed</p>
<p>Volume VII, published in the fall of 1757, brought another crisis,
worse than any before it. Quesnay and Turgot contributed famous
expositions of physiocratic laissez-faire economics. Louis de Jaucourt,
who was now one of the most frequent contributors, authored an
insultingly brief article, “France,” in which most of the ni ne hundred
words went not to the history but to the faults of France: the
dangerously extreme inequality of wealth, the poverty of the peasants,
the hypertrophy of Paris, and the depopula- tion of the provinces. And
in an article “Government” Jaucourt w rote: “The people’s greatest good
is its liberty…. Without liberty happiness is banished from states.”
Voltaire wrote for this volume an ostentatiously learned article on
fornication. But the piece de resistance — at least the piece that
aroused most resistance — was that article on Geneva which we have
already encountered in its Swiss milieu. D’Alembert forgot his
“notarial” caution and his resolve to confine himself to mathematics. He
brought both Geneva and Paris down upon his head by representing the
Calvinist clergy as discarding the divinity of Christ.</p>
<p>Grimm at once saw that this article was a tactless blunder, and
reported that it was creating an uproar. A Jesuit denounced the volume
in a sermon delivered at Versailles before the King. “It is asserted,”
d’Alembert wrote to Voltaire, “that I praise the ministers of Geneva in
a fashion prejudicial to the Catholic Church.” 11 On January 5, 1757, an
attempt had been made to assassinate the King. He responded by reviving
an old law that con- demned to death the authors, publishers, and
sellers of books that attacked religion or disturbed the state. Several
writers were imprisoned. None suffered death, but the sensitive
d’Alembert was understandably fright - ened. Shrinking from the turmoil,
he severed his connection with the En- cyclopedic (January 1, 1758). For
a moment he lost perspective; he ac- cused Mme. de Pompadour of favoring
the antiphilosophes, and asked Malesherbes to suppress their leader
Freron. Voltaire urged him not to re-</p>

<p>Xsign; d’Alembert replied (January 20): “You do not know the position
we are in, and the fury of the authorities against us…. I doubt that
Diderot will continue without me; but I know that if he does he is
preparing for himself trials and tribulations for ten years.” 42 Eight
days later his terror had increased. “If they [the enemies] print such
things today by express order of those in authority, it is not to rest
there; it means a heaping of fagots around the seventh volume, and to
throw us into the flames for an eighth.” 43 Voltaire yielded to
d’Alembert, and counseled Diderot to aban - don the Encyclopedic, since,
if it continued at all, it would be under a censorship nullifying the
value of the work as a means of checking the power of the Church over
the French mind. 44 Turgot, Marmontel, Duclos, and Morellet refused to
contribute further articles. Diderot himself for a time lost heart.
“There is hardly a day,” he wrote, “but I am tempted to go and live in
obscurity and tranquillity in the depths of my province of Champagne.”
45 But he would not surrender. “To abandon the work,” he wrote to
Voltaire (February, 1758), “is to turn one’s back on the breach, and do
what the rascals who persecute us desire. If you but knew with what joy
they learned of d’Alembert’s desertion, and what maneuvers they
undertake to prevent him from return ing!”</p>
<p>At their assembly in 1758 the bishops of France offered an unusually
large don gratuit to the King, and begged him to end the “tacit permis -
sion” that allowed the Encyclopedic to be published in France. Abraham
de Chaumeix began in 1758 to issue a series of volumes called Prejuges
legitimes contre V Encyclopedic. The publication of Helvetius’ radical
De FEsprit (July 27, 1758) roused further protests; the Ency clopedie
was in- volved in that storm because Diderot was widely rumored to have
close connections with Helvetius. To make the situation more desperate
Rous- seau, who had been contributing articles on music to the
Encyclopedic, refused further participation; and on October 22, 1758,
his Lettre a M. d’Alembert sur les spectacles mad e public his break
with the philosophes. The camp of the Encyclopedists seemed irrevocably
broken up. On January 23, 1759, the King’s attorney, Omer de Fleury,
warned the Parlement</p>
<p>chap, xix ) diderot and the Encyclopedic 643</p>
<p>The edict threatened not only the personal security of the
philosophes but the financial solvency of the publishers. Many
subscribers had paid for future volumes; how could these advances be
refunded? Most of that money had been spent in publishing Volumes I-VII
and preparing Volume VIII, which was ready for distribution when the
royal decree fell. Diderot persuaded the publishers not to give up.
Perhaps this ukase too would be modified in time; if not, the remaining
volumes could be printed abroad. At the request of the publishers
Diderot secluded himself in his home and toiled on Volume IX. Meanwhile
Malesherbes and others labored to appease the government.</p>
<p>At this juncture — in the summer of 1759 — there appeared in Paris a
sur- reptitious and anonymous pamphlet entitled Memorandum pour Abraham
Chaumeix, a piece at once dull and violent, attacking with the crudest
insults not only the government, the Parlement, the Jesuits, and the
Jan- senists, but Christ himself and his mother. Diderot reported that
“the work is being attributed to me, and that almost with unanimity.” 18
He went to Malesherbes, to the lieutenant general of the police and to
the advocate general of the Parlement, and swore that he had nothing to
do with this explosion of street-corner atheism. His friends believed
him, but advised him to leave Paris. He refused; such flight, he argued,
would be a confession of guilt. Malesherbes warned him that the police
were planning to raid his rooms and confiscate his papers; he must hide
these at once. “But where?”</p>
<p>Back in Paris, he signed with the publishers a new contract to
prepare nine additional volumes of the Encyclopedic, for 25,000 livres.
D’Alembert offered to resume responsibility for mathematical articles;
Diderot rebuked him for desertion in the face of the enemy, but accepted
his contributions. Voltaire too rejoined the fold. Diderot hoped to
finish the seventeenth and final volume in 1760, but in September, 1761,
he wrote: “The terrible re - vision is over. I have spent twentv-five
days in succession at it, at the rate of ten hours a day.” 51 Ten days
later he was still immured in his room, examining plates. Volumes
VIII-XVII were printed in Paris in quick suc- cession, but were marked
as published in Neuchatel; Sartine, the new lieu-</p>

<p>Xenant general of the Paris police, winked at the deception; 52 and
the ex- pulsion of the Jesuits in 1762 eased the way.* In September,
1762, Catherine the Great offered to complete the Encyclopedic under
governmental pro- tection at St. Petersburg; a similar offer came from
Frederick the Great through Voltaire; perhaps these proposals persuaded
the French officials to allow the printing in Paris. The final volume of
text appeared in 1765; eleven volumes of plates were added between 1765
and 1772. A five- volume Supplement and a two-volume Table generate
(index) were issued between 1776 and 1780. Diderot was asked to edit
these, but he was worn out, and refused. The most important publishing
enterprise of the century had consumed him, but had made him as immortal
as the vicissitudes of civilization will permit.</p>

<li>THE ENCY CLOPEDIE ITSELF</li>
</ol>
<p>Nearly all its contents have been superseded by the intellectual
revolution which it helped to foment; they engage our interest only as
events in the history of ideas, and as weapons used by the philosophes
in their con- flict with the only Christianity that they knew. The
attack, as we have seen, was sel dom direct. The articles “Jesus” and
“Christianity,” both by Diderot, were essentially orthodox; the second
was praised by an Italian abbe. Several priests contributed articles; so
the Abbe Yvon wrote</p>
<p>“Atheists.” The Encyclopedic supported not atheism b ut deism.
However, the cross references were sometimes seductive; appended to an
orthodox article, they often pointed to other articles that suggested
doubts; so the exemplary piece on God referred to the article
“Demonstration,” which laid down principles of evidence lethal to
miracles and myths. Sometimes the least reasonable elements in the
Christian creed were expounded with apparent acceptance, but in a way to
evoke questioning. Chinese or Mo- hammedan doctrines similar to those of
Christianity were rejected as irra- tional. The article “Priests,”
probably by d’Holbach, was outspoken in hostility, for the philosophes
hated the clergy as foes of free thought and as prods to persecution.
The author pretended to be writing of pagan priests:</p>
<p>Superstition having multiplied the ceremonies of the diverse
cults,</p>
<p>he persons conducting the ceremonies soon formed a separate
order.</p>

<li>The pleasant story that Mme. de Pompadour induced Louis XV to
withdraw his oppo- sition to the publication of Volumes VIII-XVII by
showing him the article on gunpowder is now generally rejected as a
fancy of Voltaire’s. 53 The story is given in Vol. XLVIII of Beuchot’s
edition of Voltaire’s works, and also in the Goncourts’ Madame de
Pompadour , p. 147.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>diderot and the Encyclopedic</p>
<p>645</p>
<p>The people believed that these persons were entirely devoted to the
divinity; hence the priests shared in the respect given to the
divin-</p>
<p>ity. Vulgar occupations appeared to be beneath them, and the</p>
<p>people believed themselves obliged to provide for their subsistence…
as depositories and interpreters of the divine will, and as mediators
between gods and men….</p>
<p>To more surely establish their domination, the priests depicted
the</p>
<p>gods as cruel, vindictive, implacable. They introduced
ceremonies,</p>
<p>initiations, mysteries, whose atrocity could nourish in men that
somber melancholy so favorable to the empire of fanaticism. Then
human</p>
<p>blood flowed in great streams over the altars; the people, cowed with
fear and stupefied with superstition, thought no price too high to pay
for the good will of the gods. Mothers delivered without a tear their
tender infants to the devouring flames; thousands of victims fell under
the sacrificial knife….</p>
<p>It was difficult for men so reverenced to remain long within the</p>
<p>borders of subordination necessary to social order. The
priesthood,</p>
<p>drunk with power, often disputed the rights of the kings….</p>
<p>Fanaticism and superstition held the knife suspended over the heads
of sovereigns; thrones were shaken whenever kings wished to repress or
punish holy men, whose interests were confounded with those of the
gods…. To wish to limit their power was to sap the founda-</p>
<p>ions of religion. 54</p>
<p>Generally the war on the old faith took the form of praising the new
beliefs and methods of science and philosophy; to replace religion with
science, and priests with philosophers, at least in the educated
classes, was the dream of the philosophes. The sciences received lengthy
expositions; for example, fifty- six columns were given to “Anatomy.”
Under “Ge - ology” there were long articles on minerals, metals, stra
ta, fossils, glaciers, mines, earthquakes, volcanoes, and precious
stones. Philosophy, in the new view, was to be based entirely on
science; it would build no “systems,” it would shun metaphysics, it
would not pontificate on the origin and destiny of t he world. The
article “Ecole” made a frontal assault upon the Scholas - tic
philosophers as men who had abandoned the search for knowledge, had
surrendered to theology, and had lost themselves safely in logical
cobwebs and metaphysical clouds.</p>
<p>Diderot contributed a remarkable series of articles on the history of
philosophy; they leaned heavily on Johann Jakob Brucker’s Historia
critica Philosophiae (1742-44), but they showed original research in
French thought. The essays on the Eleatics and Epicurus expounded
materialism; other articles extolled Bruno and Hobbes. In Diderot
philosophy became a religion. “Reason is for the philosopher what grace
is for the Christian.”™ “Let us hasten to render philosophy popular,” he
cried;™ and in the article</p>
<p>646</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>X“Encyclopedia” he wrote like an apostle: “Today, when philosophy ad
- vances with giant steps, when it submits to its empire all the objects
of its interest, when its voice is the dominant voice, and it begins to
break the yoke of authority and tradition, to hold to the laws of
reason…” Here</p>
<p>If such a philosopher could replace the priest as guide-confessor to
a king, he would counsel, first of all, a spread of freedom, especially
to speech and press. “No man has received from nature the right of
commanding others”; 58 so much for the divine right of kings. And as for
revolution:</p>
<p>Power acquired by violence is only a usurpation, and lasts only
as</p>
<p>long as the force of him who commands prevails over that of those</p>
<p>who obey…. If these in turn become stronger and shake off their</p>
<p>yoke, they do so with as much right and justice as did the former who
had imposed it upon them. The same law that made the authority</p>
<p>unmakes it; it is the law of the stronger…. Therefore true and</p>
<p>legitimate power necessarily has limits…. The prince holds from</p>
<p>his subjects themselves the authority that he has over them; and this
authority is limited by the laws of nature and of the state…. It</p>
<p>is not the state which belongs to the prince, but rather the prince
who belongs to the state. 59</p>
<p>The Encyclopedic was not socialistic, nor democratic; it accepted
mon- archy, and rejected that notion of equality which Rousseau
expounded so forcefully in 1755. Jaucourt’s article “Natural Equality”
advocated equal - ity before the law, but added: “I know too well the
necessity of different conditions, grades, honors, distinctions,
prerogatives, subordinations* which must rule under all governments.” 60
Diderot at this time considered private property the indispensable basis
of civilization. 61 The article “Man,” how - ever, had a communistic
moment: “The net profit of a society, if eq ually distributed, may be
preferable to a larger profit if this is distributed un- equally and has
the effect of dividing the people into classes.” And— talking of
almshouses — “it would be of far more value to work for the prevention
of misery than to multiply places of refuge for the miserable.” 62</p>
<p>A philosophical king would periodically examine the title deeds
to</p>
<p>feudal domains, and would abolish feudal privileges no longer merited
by seignorial services to the peasantry or the state. 63 He would find a
humane substitute for the forced labor of the corvee, and he would
forbid the trade in slaves. He would, so far as his power extended, put
an end to wars of dynastic rivalry or greed. He would seek to cleanse
the trial courts of cor- ruption, to end the sale of offices, and to
mitigate the ferocity of the penal</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) DIDEROT AND THE Encyclopedk 647</p>
<p>code; at the very least he would put an end to judicial torture. And
instead of lending his aid to the perpetuation of superstition he would
dedicate his labors to advancing that golden age in which statesmanship
would ally itself with science in an unremitting war upon ignorance,
illness, and poverty.</p>
<p>By and large the economic ideas of the Encyclopedic were those of the
middle class to which most of the philosophes belonged. Often they were
the views of the physiocrats who, under the lead of Quesnay and Mirabeau
pere, dominated economic theory in midcentury France. Free enterprise —
and therefore free commerce and free competition — were held vital to
free men; hence guilds, as impediments to all these, were condemned.
These ideas were destined to take the stage of history in the ministry
of Turgot 0774 )-</p>
<p>The Encyclopedic gave alert and enthusiastic attention to the
industrial technology that was beginning to transform the economic face
of England and France. The mechanical arts, Diderot maintained, should
be honored as the application of science, and surely the application is
as precious as the theory. “What absurdity in our judgments! We exhort
men to occupy themselves usefully, and we despise useful men.” 04 He
hoped to make the Encyclopedic a treasury of technology so thorough that
if the mechanical arts were by some tragedy destroyed they could be
rebuilt from one sur- viving set of its volumes. He himself wrote long
and painstaking articles on steel, agriculture, needles, bronze, the
boring machine (“Alesoir”), shirts, stockings, shoes, bread. He admired
the genius of inventors and the skills of artisans; he went in person,
or sent his agents, to farms, shops, and factories to study new
processes and products; and he supervised the en- gravings, numbering
almost a thousand, that made the eleven volumes of plates the marvel of
their kind in their age; to those volumes the govern- ment was proud to
extend the approbation et privilege du roi. Here were fifty-five plates
on the textile industry, eleven on minting, ten on military technics,
five on making gunpowder, three on the manufacture of pins; the last
were a source for Adam Smith’s famous passage on the division of labor
into “eighteen distinct operations” in producing a pin. 05 To get this
knowledge, said Diderot,</p>
<p>we turned to the ablest artisans in Paris and throughout the
kingdom.</p>
<p>We took the trouble… to ask them questions, to write at their</p>
<p>dictation,… to get from them the terms used in their trades,…</p>
<p>o rectify, in long and frequent interviews with one group of
work-</p>
<p>men, what others had imperfectlv, obscurely, or sometimes inaccu-
rately explained…. We have sent engravers into the shops, who</p>
<p>have drawn designs of the machines and tools, omitting nothing that
could make them clear to the eyes. ,i0</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XWhen, in 1773, the Ottoman Sultan asked Baron de Tott to manufacture
cannon for the forts of the Dardanelles, the Baron used the Encyclopedic
article on cannon as one of his constant guides. 157</p>
<p>After his work on the text was completed, Diderot suffered a
mortifica- tion that almost broke his spirit. Happening to examine an
article, he dis- covered that many parts of the proofsheets that he had
corrected and ap- proved had been omitted in print. A survey of other
articles showed a similar bowdlerization in Volumes IX to XVII. The
omissions were usually of passages that might have further aroused the
clergy or the Parlement; and the deletions had been made with no regard
for the logic or continuity of what remained. Le Breton confessed that
he had performed the surgery to save the Encyclopedic from further
tribulation, and himself from bank- ruptcy. Grimm reported the
results:</p>
<p>The discovery threw Diderot into a frenzy which I shall never
for-</p>
<p>get. “For years,” he cried to Le Breton, “vou have been basely cheat
- ing me. You have massacred… the work of twenty good men who</p>
<p>have devoted their time, their talents, their vigils, from love of
right and truth, in the simple hope of seeing their ideas given to the
public, and reaping from them a little consideration richly’ earned….
You</p>
<p>will henceforth be cited as a man who has been guilty of an act
of</p>
<p>reachery, an act of vile hardihood, to which nothing that has
ever</p>
<p>happened in this world can be compared.” 08</p>
<p>He never forgave Le Breton.</p>
<p>Looking back upon the great enterprise, we see it to have been, by
its history as well as its contents, the outstanding achievement of the
French Enlightenment. And as Diderot’s part in it was central and
indispensable, his stature rises to a place only after Voltaire’s and
Rousseau’s in the in - tellectual panorama of eighteenth-century France.
His industry as editor was pervasive and exhausting. He made the cross
references, corrected errors, read the proofs. He ran about Paris
seeking and prodding contributors. He himself wrote hundreds of articles
when contributors could not be found or when they proved incompetent. He
w r as the last resort when all others had failed. So we find him
writing on philosophy, canvas, Chris- tianity, boa constrictors, beauty,
playing cards, breweries, and consecrated bread. His article
“Intolerance” anticipated Voltaire’s treatise, and may have suggested
several of its ideas. Many of his pieces were studded with errors, and
some of them were indiscriminately hostile and unjust, like that on the
Jesuits. But he was a man in a hurry, embattled and pursued, and
fighting back with every weapon he could find.</p>
<p>Now that the excitement of battle has subsided, we can recognize the
shortcomings of the E 7 icyclopedie. There were a thousand errors of
fact.</p>
<p>chap, xix ) diderot and the Ency clopedie 649</p>
<p>There were careless repetitions and flagrant omissions. There were
sub- stantial plagiarisms, as Jesuit scholars pointed out; some articles
were “a mosaic of borrowings.”’ !U Berthier, in three issues of the
Journal de Trevoux, showed, with exact references and parallel
quotations, over a hundred plagiarisms in Volume I. Most of these thefts
were brief and unimportant, as in definitions, but several extended to
three or four columns copied al- most word for word.</p>
<p>There were serious intellectual defects in the Eucy clopedie. The
con- tributors had too simple a view of human nature, too sanguine an
estimate of the honesty of reason, too vague an understanding of its
frailty, too optimistic a prospect of how men would use the knowledge
that science was giving them. The philosophes in general, and Diderot in
particular, lacked historical sense; they seldom paused to inquire how
the beliefs they combated had arisen, and what human needs, rather than
priestly inven- tions, had given them birth and permanence. They were
quite blind to the immense contribution of religion to social order, to
moral character, to music and art, to the mitigation of poverty and
suffering. Their anti- religious bias was so strong that they could
never lay claim to that im- partiality which we should now consider
essential to a good encyclopedia. Though some Jesuits, like Berthier,
were often fair in their criticism, most of the Encyclopedie’s critics
were as partial as the philosophes.</p>
<p>Diderot felt keenly the factual faults of the work. He wrote in
1755:</p>
<p>“The first edition of an encyclopedia cannot but be a very ill
-formed and incomplete compilation”; 70 nnd he expected that it would
soon be super - seded. Even so the bulky product found its w ay into the
centers of thought on the Continent. The tw 7 enty-eight volumes were
thrice reprinted in Switzerland, twice in Italy, once in Germany, once
in Russia. Pirated edi- tions came back into France to spread the
influence of the contraband ideas. All in all, there were forty-three
editions in tw r enty-five years — a remarkable record for so costly a
set. Families read its articles together in the evening; eager groups w
T ere formed to study it; Thomas Jefferson ad- vised James Madison to
buy it. Now 7 the gospel of reason as against mythol- ogy, of knowicdge
ns against dogma, of progress through education as against the resigned
contemplation of death, all passed like a pollen-laden wind over Europe,
disturbing every tradition, stimulating thought, at last fomenting
revolt. The Ency clopedie was the revolution before the Revolution.</p>
