<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>XThe Koran</p>
<p>I. FORM</p>
<p>T HE word qur’an means a reading or discourse, and is applied by Mos
- lems to the whole, or to any section, of their sacred scriptures. Like
the Jewish-Christian Bible, the Koran is an accumulation, and orthodoxy
claims it to be in every syllable inspired by God. Unlike the Bible, it
is proximately the work of one man, and is therefore without question
the most influential book ever produced by a single hand. At various
times in the last twenty- three years of his life Mohammed dictated some
fragment of this revelation; each was written upon parchment, leather,
palm-leaves, or bones, was read to an assembly, and was deposited in
various receptacles with preceding revela- tions, with no special care
to keep them in logical or chronological order. No collection of these
fragments was made in the Prophet’s lifetime; but several Moslems knew
them all by heart, and served as living texts. In the year 633, when
many of these qurra had died and were not being replaced, the Caliph Abu
Bekr ordered Mohammed’s chief amanuensis, Zaid ibn Thabit, to “search
out the Koran and bring it together.” He gathered the fragments, says
tradi - tion, “from date leaves and tablets of white stone, and the
breasts of men.” From Zaid’s completed manuscript several copies were
made; but as these had no vowels, public readers interpreted some words
variously, and diverse texts appeared in different cities of the
spreading Moslem realm. To stop this confusion the Caliph Othman
commissioned Zaid and three Quraish scholars to revise Zaid’s manuscript
(651); copies of this official revision were sent to</p>
<p>The nature of the book doomed it to repetition and disorder. Each
passage taken separately fulfills an intelligible purpose — states a
doctrine, dictates a prayer, announces a law, denounces an enemy,
directs a procedure, tells a story, calls to arms, proclaims a victory,
formulates a treaty, appeals for funds, regulates ritual, morals,
industry, trade, or finance. But we are not sure that Mohammed wanted
all these fragments gathered into one book. Many of them were arguments
to the man or the moment; they can hardly be understood without the
commentary of history and tradition; and none but the Faithful need
expect to enjoy them all. The 1 14 chapters (“suras”) are arranged not
in the order of their composition, which is unknown, but in the order of
their decreasing length. Since the earlier revelations were gen-</p>
<p>*75</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xerally shorter than the later ones, the Koran is history in reverse.
The Medina suras, prosaic and practical, appear first; the Mecca suras,
poetic and spiritual, appear last. The Koran puts its worst foot
forward, and should be begun at the end.</p>
<p>All the suras except the first take the form of discourses by Allah
or Ga- briel to Mohammed, his followers, or his enemies; this was the
plan adopted by the Hebrew prophets, and in many passages of the
Pentateuch. Moham- med felt that no moral code would win obedience
adequate to the order and vigor of a society unless men believed the
code to have come from God. The method lent itself well to a style of
impassioned grandeur and eloquence, at times rivaling Isaiah . 1
Mohammed used a mode of utterance half poetry, half prose; rhythm and
rhyme are pervasive in it, but irregular; and in the early Meccan suras
there is a sonorous cadence and bold sweep of style that are completely
felt only by those familiar with the language and sympathetic with the
creed. The book is in the purest Arabic, rich in vivid similes, and too
florid for Occidental taste. By general consent it is the best, as well
as the first, work in the prose literature of Arabia.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>creed *</li>
</ol>
<p>A religion is, among other things, a mode of moral government. The
his- torian does not ask if a theology is true — through what
omniscience might he judge? Rather he inquires what social and
psychological factors combined to produce the religion; how well it
accomplished the purpose of turning beasts into men, savages into
citizens, and empty hearts into hopeful courage and minds at peace; how
much freedom it still left to the mental development of mankind; and
what was its influence in history.</p>
<p>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam assumed that the first necessity for
a healthy society is belief in the moral government of the universe —
belief that even in the heyday of evil some beneficent intelligence,
however unin- telligibly, guides the cosmic drama to a just and noble
end. The three reli- gions that helped to form the medieval mind agreed
that this cosmic intelli- gence is one supreme God; Christianity added,
however, that the one God appears in three distinct persons; Judaism and
Islam considered this a dis- guised polytheism, and proclaimed with
passionate emphasis the unity and singleness of God. The Koran devotes a
whole sura (cxii) to this theme; the Moslem muezzin chants it daily from
a hundred thousand minarets.</p>
<p>Allah is, first of all, the source of life and growth and all the
blessings of the earth. Says Mohammed’s Allah to Mohammed:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the following sketch certain passages from the Islamic traditions
will be used in elucida- tion of the Koran, but will be specified as
such, usually in the text, always in the notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. IX) THE KORAN 1 77</p>
<p>Thou seest the earth barren; but when We send down water</p>
<p>thereon, … it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely
kind</p>
<p>(xxii, 5) Let man consider his food: how We pour water in show-</p>
<p>ers, then split the earth in clefts, and cause the grain to grow
therein, and grapes and green fodder, and olive and palm trees, and
garden</p>
<p>closes of thick foliage (lxxx, 24-30). . . . Look upon the fruit
thereof,</p>
<p>and upon its ripening; lo, herein, verily, are portents for a people
who believe (vi, 100).</p>
<p>Allah is also a God of power, “Who raised up the heavens without
visible support, . . . and ordereth the course of the sun and moon, . .
. and spread out the earth, and placed therein firm hills and flowing
streams” (xiii, 2 -3). Or, in the famous “Throne Verse”:</p>
<p>Allah! There is no God save Him, the living, the eternal! Neither</p>
<p>slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in
the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave?</p>
<p>He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is
behind</p>
<p>them . . . His throne includeth the heavens and the earth, and He
is</p>
<p>never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the Tremendous
(ii&gt; 255).</p>
<p>But along with His power and justice goes everlasting mercy. Every
chapter of the Koran except the ninth, like every orthodox Moslem book,
begins with the solemn prelude (called bismillah from its first words) :
“In the name</p>
<p>Allah is an omniscient d eity, and knows our most secret thoughts.
“Verily We created man, and We know what his soul whispereth to him, for
We are nearer to him than the vein in his neck” (1, 15). Since Allah
knows the fu - ture as well as the present and the past, all things are
predestined; everything has been decreed and fixed from all eternity by
the divine will, even to the final fate of every soul. Like Augustine’s
God, Allah not only knows from eternity who will be saved, but “sendeth
whom He will astray, and guideth w hom He will” (xxxv, 8; lxxvi, 3 1 ) .
As Yahveh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so Allah says of unbelievers: “We
have thrown veils over their hearts lest they should understand the
Koran, and into their ears a heaviness; and if thou bid them to the
guidance, yet even then they will never be guided” (xviii, 58). This —
doubtless intended as a spur to belief — is a hard saying in any
religion, but Mohammed thrusts it down with more than Augustinian
thoroughness: “Had We pleased,” says Allah, “We had certainly given to
every soul its guidance. But true shall be the word that has gone forth
from Me — I will surely fill hell with jinn 〔demons〕 and men together”
(xxxii, 13). Once, says a tradition ascribed to Ali, “we were sitting
with the Prophet, and he wrote</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>I 7 8</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xting place is not written by God whether in fire or in paradise.’ ”
2 This belief in predestination made fatalism a prominent feature in
Moslem thought. It was used by Mohammed and other leaders to encourage
bravery in battle, since no danger could hasten, nor any caution defer,
the predestined hour of each man’s death. It gave the Moslem a dignified
resignation against the hard - ships and necessities of life; but it
conspired with other factors to produce, in later centuries, a
pessimistic inertia in Arab life and thought.</p>
<p>The Koran fills out its supernatural world with angels, jinn, and a
devil. The angels serve as Allah’s secre taries and messengers, and
record the good and wicked deeds of men. The jinn are genii, made out of
fire; unlike the angels, they eat, drink, copulate, and die; some, are
good, and listen to the Koran (lxxii, 8) ; most are bad, and spend their
time getting human beings into mischief. The leader of the evil jinn is
Iblis, who was once a great angel, but was condemned for refusing to pay
homage to Adam.</p>
<p>The ethic of the Koran, like that of the New Testament, rests on the
fear of punishment, and the ho pe of reward, beyond the grave. “The life
of the world is only play, and idle talk, and pageantry” (lvii, 20) ;
only one thing is certain in it, and that is death. Some Arabs thought
that death ends all, and laughed at theories of an afterlife as “naught
but fables of the men of old” (xxiii, 83); but the Koran vouches for the
resurrection of body and soul (lxxv, 3-4) . Resurrection will not come
at once; the dead will sleep till Judg- ment Day; but because of their
sleep, their awaking will seem to them im- mediate. Only Allah knows
when this general resurrection will take place. But certain signs will
herald its coming. In those last days faith in religion will have
decayed; morals will be loosened into chaos; there will be tumults and
seditions, and great wars, and wise men will wish themselves dead. The
final signal will be three trumpet blasts. At the first blast the sun
will go out, the stars will fall, the heavens will melt, all buildings
and mountains will be leveled with the earth and its plains, and the
seas will dry up or burst into flame (xx, io2f). At the second blast all
living creatures — angels or jinn or men — will be annihilated, except a
few favored of God. Forty years later Israfel, the angel of music, will
blow the third blast; then dead bodies will rise from the grave and
rejoin their souls. God will come in the clouds, attended by angels
bearing the books of all men’s deeds, words, and thoughts. The good
works will be weighed in a scale against the bad, and each man will so
be judged. The inspired prophets will denounce those who rejected their
message, and will intercede for those who believed. The good and bad
alike will move out upon the bridge al-Sirat, which — finer than a hair
and sharper than the edge of a sword — is suspended over the chasms of
hell; the wicked and unbelievers will fall from it; the good will pass
over it safely into paradise — not through their own merits, but only
through the mercy of God. The Koran, like the Fundamentalist forms of
Christianity, seems more concerned with right belief than with good
conduct; a hundred times it threatens with</p>
<p>THE KORAN</p>
<p>CHAP, ix)</p>
<p>hell those who reject Mohammed’s appeal (iii, 10,63, 1 3 1 ; iv, 56,
1 1 5; vii, 41 ; viii, 50; ix, 63, etc.). Sins being diverse in degree
and kind, there are seven levels in hell, each with punishments adjusted
to the offense. There will be burning heat and biting cold; even the
most lightly punished will wear shoes of fire. The drink of the damned
will be boiling water and filth (lvi, 4of ) . Perhaps Dante saw some of
his visions in the Koran.</p>
<p>Unlike Dante’s, Mohammed’s picture of heaven is as vivid as his
descrip - tion of hell. Good believers will go there, and those who die
for Allah’s cause in war; and the poor will enter 500 years before the
rich. Paradise is in or above the seventh astronomic heaven; it is one
vast garden, watered with pleasant rivers and shaded with spreading
trees; the blessed there will be dressed in silk brocades, and be
adorned with gems; 3 they will recline on couches, be served by handsome
youths, and eat fruit from trees bowing down to fill their hands; there
will be rivers of milk, honey, and wine; the saved will drink wine
(forbidden on earth) from silver goblets, and will suf- fer no
aftereffects. 4 By the mercy of Allah there will be no speeches at these
heavenly banquets (lxxviii, 35); instead there will be virgins “never
yet - nities of mortal flesh. Each blessed male will have seventy-two of
these houris for his reward, and neither age nor weariness nor death
shall mar the loveli- ness of these maidens, or their comrades’ bliss
(xliv, 56). Since pious and be - lieving women will also enter paradise,
some confusion might result, but such difficulties would not be
insuperable to men accustomed to polygamy. To these sensual pleasures
Mohammed added certain spiritual delights: some of the saved will prefer
to recite the Koran; and all of them will experience the supreme ecstasy
of beholding Allah’s face. “And round about them shall go chil dren,
never growing old.” 8</p>
<p>Who could reject such a revelation?</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ETHICS</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Koran, as in the Talmud, law and morals are one; the secular
is in- cluded in the religious, and every commandment is of God. Here
are rules not only for manners and hygiene, marriage and divorce, and
the treatment of children, slaves, and animals, but also for commerce
and politics, interest and debts, contracts and wills, industry and
finance, crime and punishment, war and peace.</p>
<p>Mohammed did not disdain commerce — he was its graduate; even in his
sovereign Medina days, says a tradition, he bought wholesale, sold
retail, and made profit without qualm; sometimes he acted as auctioneer.
7 His language</p>
<p>i8o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xwas rich in commercial metaphors; he promised worldly success to
good Moslems (ii, 5), and offered heaven as a bargain for a little
belief. He threat- ened hell to lying or cheating merchants; denounced
monopolists, and specu- lators who “keep back grain to sell at a high
rate”; 8 and bade the employer “give the laborer his wage before his
perspiration dries.” 9 He prohibited the</p>
<p>In like manner he improved the position of woman in Arabia while
accept- ing her legal subjection with equanimity. We find in him the
usual quips of the male resenting his enslavement to desire; almost like
a Father of the Church he speaks of women as man’s supreme calamity, and
suspects that most of them will go to hell. 11 He made his own Salic law
against women rulers. 12 He allowed women to come to the mosque, but
believed that “their homes are better for them”; 13 y et when they came
to his services he treated them kindly, even if they brought suckling
babes; if, says an amiable tradi- tion, he heard a child cry, he would
shorten his sermon lest the mother be in- convenienced. 14 He put an end
to the Arab practice of infanticide (xvii, 31). He placed woman on the
same footing with man in legal processes and in fi- nancial
independence; she might follow any legitimate profession, keep her
earnings, inherit property, and dispose of her belongings at will (iv,
4, 32). He abolished the Arab custom of transmitting women as property
from father to son. Women were to inherit half as much as the male
heirs, and were not to be disposed of against their will. 15 A verse in
the Koran (xxxiii,</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li>seemed to establish purd ah: “Stay in your houses, and do not
display your finery”; but the emphasis here was on modesty of dress; and
a tradition quotes the Prophet as saying to women, “It is permitted you
to go out for your needs.” 16 With regard to his own wives he asked his
followers to speak to them only from behind a curtain. 17 Subject to
these restrictions, we find Moslem women moving about freely and
unveiled in the Islam of his time, and a century thereafter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Morals are in part a function of climate: probably the heat of Arabia
in- tensified sexual passion and precocity, and some allowance should be
made for men in perpetual heat. Moslem laws were designed to reduce
temptation outside of marriage, and increase opportunity within.
Premarital continence was strictly enjoined (xxiv, 33), and fasting was
recommended as an aid. 18 The consent of both parties was required for
marriage; that agreement, duly witnessed, and sealed with a dowry from
bridegroom to bride, sufficed for legal marriage, whether the parents
consented or not. 10 A Moslem male was allowed to marry a Jewish or
Christian woman, but not an idolatress — i.e., a</p>
<p>THE KORAN</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>1 8 I</p>
<p>non-Christian polytheist. As in Judaism, celibacy was considered
sinful, mar- riage obligatory and pleasing to God (xxiv, 32). Mohammed
accepted polygamy to balance a high death rate in both sexes, the length
of maternal nursing, and the early waning of reproductive powers in hot
climes; but he limited the number of permitted wives to four, allowing
himself a special dis- pensation. He forbade concubinage (lxx, 29-31),
but held it preferable to marriage with an idolatress (ii, 221).</p>
<p>Having allowed the male so many outlets for desire, the Koran
punished adultery with a hundred stripes on each sinner (xxiv, 2). But
when, on flimsy grounds, Mohammed’s favorite wife, Aisha, was suspected
of adul - tery, and gossip persistently besmirched her name, he had a
trance and issued a revelation requiring four witnesses to prove
adultery; moreover, “those who accuse honorable women, but bring not
four witnesses, shall be scourged with eighty stripes, and their
testimony shall never again be ac- cepted” (xxiv, 4) . Accusations of
adultery were thereafter rare.</p>
<p>Divorce was permitted to the male by the Koran, as by the Talmud, on
al- most any ground; the wife might divorce her husband by returning her
dowry to him (ii, 229). While accepting the pre-Islamic liberty of
divorce for the male, Mohammed discouraged it, saying that nothing was
so displeas- ing to God; arbiters should be appointed “one from his folk
and one from hers,” and every effort made at reconciliation (iv, 35).
Three successive declarations, at monthly intervals, were required to
make a divorce legal; and to compel careful thought about it, the
husband was not allowed to remarry his divorced wife until after she had
been married and divorced by another man. 20 The husband must not go in
to his wife during her periods; she was not to be considered “unclean”
at that time, but she must p urify herself ritually before resuming
cohabitation. Women are “a tilth” to man— a field to be cul- tivated; it
is an obligation of the man to beget children. The wife should rec-
ognize the superior intelligence and therefore superior authority of the
male; she must obey her husband; if she rebels he should “banish her to
a bed apart,</p>
<p>Here as elsewhere the legal disabilities of women barely matched the
power of their eloquence, their tenderness, and their charms. Omar, the
fu- ture caliph, rebuked his wife for speaking to him in a tone that he
considered disrespectful. She assured him that this was the tone in
which his daughter Hafsa, and the other wives of Mohammed, spoke to the
Prophet of Allah. Omar went at once and remonstrated with Hafsa and
another of Moham- med’s wives; he was told to mind his business, and he
retired in dismay. Hearing of all this, Mohammed laughed heartily. 21
Like other Moslems he quarreled now and then with his wives, but he did
not cease to be fond of them, or to speak of women with becoming
sentiment. “The most valuable thing in the world,” he is reported to
have said, “is a virtuous woman.” 22</p>
<p>i8z</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XTwice in the Koran he reminded Moslems that their mothers had
carried them with pain, brought them forth with pain, nursed them for
twenty-four or thirty months. 23 “Paradise,” he said, “is at the foot of
the mother.” 24</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>RELIGION AND THE STATE</li>
</ol>
<p>The greatest problems of the moralist are first to make co-operation
attrac- tive, and then to determine the size of the whole or group with
which he will counsel pre-eminent co-operation. A perfect ethic would
ask the paramount co-operation of every part with the greatest whole —
with the universe itself, or its essential life and order, or God; on
that plane religion and morality would be one. But morality is the child
of custom and the grandchild of compulsion; it develops co-operation
only within aggregates equipped with force. Therefore all actual
morality has been group morality.</p>
<p>Mohammed’s ethic transcended the limits of the tribe in which he was
bom, but was imprisoned in the creedal group which he formed. After his
victory in Mecca he restricted, but could not quite abolish, the
plundering raids of tribe against tribe, and gave to all Arabia,
implicitly to all Islam, a new sense of unity, a wider orbit of co-
operation and loyalty. “The believe rs are naught else than brothers”
(xlix, io). Distinction of rank or race, so strong among the tribes, was
diminished by similarity of belief. “If a negro slave is appointed to
rule you, hear and obey him, though his head be like a dried grape.” 25
It was a noble conception that made one people of diverse nations
scattered over the continents; this is the glory of both Christianity
and Islam.</p>
<p>But to that transcendent love, in both religions, corresponded an
astringent antagonism to all who would no t believe. “Take not the Jews
and the Chris - tians for friends. . . . Choose not your fathers nor
your brothers for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than
in faith” (v, 51, 55; ix, 23). Mo - hammed interpreted these principles
with some m oderation. “Let there be no violence in religion. If they
embrace Islam they are surely directed; but if they turn their backs,
verily to thee belongs preaching only.” 20 “Give a respite to the
disbelievers. Deal thou gently with them for a while” (xxxv i,</p>
<p>17). But against Arab unbelievers who did not peaceably submit
Mohammed preached the jihad or holy war, a crusade in the name of Allah.
After the war with the Quraish had begun, and when the “sacred months”
of truce were past, enemy unbelievers were to be killed wherever found
(ix, 5) . “But if any of the idolaters seeketh thy protection, then
protect him that he may hear the word of Allah. … If they repent and
establish worship” (accept Islam), “then leave their way free” (ix, 5 -
6). “Kill not t he old man who cannot fight, nor young children, nor
women.” 27 Every able -bodied male in Islam must join in the holy war.
“Lo, Allah loveth those who battle for His</p>
<p>THE KORAN</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>I8 3</p>
<p>cause. … I swear by Allah . . . that marching about, morning and
evening, to fight for religion is better than the world and everything
in it; and verily the standing of one of you in the line of battle is
better than supererogatory prayers performed in your house for sixty
years.” 28 This war ethic, however, is no general incitement to war.
“Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but
begin not hostilities. Allah loveth not aggressors” (ii, 90). Mohammed
accepts the laws of war as practiced by the Christian nations of his
time, and wages war against Quraish unbelievers holding Mecca precisely
as Urban II would preach a crusade against Moslems hold- ing
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The inevitable gap between theory and practice seems narrower in
Islam than in other faiths. The Arabs were sensual, and the Koran
accepted po- lygamy; otherwise the ethic of the Koran is as sternly
puritan as Cromwell’s; only the uninformed think of Mohammedanism as a
morally easy creed. The Arabs were prone to vengeance and retaliation,
and the Koran made no pre- tense at returning good for evil. “And one
who attacks you, attack him in like manner. . . . Whoso defendeth
himself after he hath suffered wrong, there is no way” (of blame)
“against them” (ii, 194; xlii, 41). It is a virile ethic, like that of
the Old Testament; it stresses the masculine, as Chris- tianity stressed
the feminine, virtues. No other religion in history has so con-
sistently tried to make men strong, or so generally succeeded. “O ye who
believe! Endure! Outdo all others in endur ance!” (iii, 200). Thus also
spake Nietzsche’s Zarathustra.</p>
<p>Revered to the edge of idolatry, copied and illuminated with loving
skill and care, used as the book from which the Moslem learned to read,
and then again as the core and summit of his education, the Koran has
for thirteen centuries filled the memory, aroused the imagination,
molded the character, and perhaps chilled the intellect, of hundreds of
millions of men. It gave to simple souls the simplest, least mystical,
least ritualistic, of all creeds, free from idolatry and sacerdotalism.
Its message raised the moral and cultural level of its followers,
promoted social order and unity, inculcated hygiene, lessened
superstition and cruelty, bettered the condition of slaves, lifted the
lowly to dignity and pride, and produced among Moslems (barring the
revels of some caliphs) a degree of sobriety and temperance unequaled
elsewhere in the white man’s world. It gave men an uncomplaining
acceptance of the</p>

<p>they have covenanted, fulfill their covenant; and who are patient in
adversity and hardship and in the times of violence: these are the</p>
<p>righteous, these are they who believe in the Lord! (ii, 177).</p>
<p>V. THE SOURCES OF THE KORAN</p>
<p>As the style of the Koran is modeled on that of the Hebrew prophets,
so its contents are largely an adaptation of Judaic doctrines, tales,
and themes. The Koran, which excoriates the Jews, is the sincerest
flattery they have ever received. Its basic ideas — monotheism,
prophecy, faith, repentance, the Last Judgment, heaven and hell — seem
Jewish in proximate origin, even in form and dress. It deviated from
Judaism chiefly in insisting that the Messiah had come. Mohammed frankly
reports contemporary accusations that his revela- tions were “nothing
but a fraud which he hath fabricated, and other people have helped him
therein, . . . dictating to him morning and ev ening” (xxv, 5; xvi,
105). He generously accepts the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures as
divinely revealed (iii, 48) . God has given man 104 revelations, of
which only four have been preserved — the Pentateuch to Moses, the
Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, the Koran to Mohammed; whoso
rejects any one of these is, in Mohammed’s view, an infidel. But the
first three have suffered such corruption that they can no longer be
trusted; and the Koran now replaces them. 29 There have been many
inspired prophets — e.g., Adam, Noah, Abra- ham, Moses, Enoch, Christ,
but last and greatest, Mohammed. From Adam to Christ Mohammed accepts
all the narratives of the Bible, but occasionally amends them to save
the divine honor; so God did not really let Jesus die on the cross (iv,
157). The Prophet alleges the agreement of the Koran with the Bible as
proof of his divine mission, and interprets various Biblical passages 30
as predicting his own birth and apostolate.</p>
<p>From the Creation to the Last Judgment he uses Jewish ideas. Allah is
Yahveh; Allah is a contraction of al-Ilah, an old Kaaba god; a kindred
word was used in various forms in divers Semitic languages to express
divinity; so the Jews used Elohim, and Christ on the cross appealed to
Eli. Both Allah and Yahveh are gods of compassion, but they are also
stern and warlike de- ities, capable of many human passions, and
resolved to have no other god besides them. The Shema’ Yisrael of the
Jewish ritual, affirming the unity of God, is repeated in the first
article of Moslem belief — “There is no god but Allah.” The Koranic
refrain that Allah is “gracious and compassionate” echoes the same
frequent phrase in the Talmud. 31 The designation of Allah as Rahman,
the merciful, recalls the rabbinical use of Rahmana for Yahveh in the
Talmudic age. 32 The Talmud loves to say, “The Holy One, Blessed be He”;
Moslem literature follows with the oft - repeated words, “Allah” (or</p>
<p>THE KORAN</p>
<p>CHAP, ix)</p>
<p>I8 5</p>
<p>“Mohammed”), “Blessed be He.” Apparently the Jews wh o acquainted the
Prophet with the Bible also gave him snatches of the Talmud; a hundred
pas- sages in the Koran echo the Mishna and the Gemaras. 33 The
teachings of the Koran about angels, the resurrection, and heaven follow
the Talmud rather than the Old Testament. Stories that make up a fourth
of the Koran can be traced to haggadic (illustrative) elements in the
Talmud. 34 Where the Koran narratives vary from the Biblical accounts
(as in the story of Joseph) they usually accord with variations already
existing in the haggadic literature of the pre-Moslem Jews. 35</p>
<p>From the Mishna and halakah — the oral law of the Jews — Mohammed
seems to have derived many elements of ritual, even minute details of
diet and hy- giene. 36 Ceremonial purification before prayer is
enjoined, and the hands may be washed with sand if no water can be had —
precisely the rabbinical formula. The Jewish institution of the Sabbath
pleased Mohammed; he adopted it with a distinction in making Friday a
day of prayer for the Moslems. The Koran, like the Mosaic Law, forbids
the eating of blood, or the flesh of swine or dogs, or of any animal
that has died of itself, or has been killed by another animal, or has
been offered to an idol (v, 3; vi, 146); the Koran, however, allows the
eating of camel’s flesh, which Moses forbade, but which was some - times
the only flesh food available in the desert. The Moslem method of fast-
ing followed the Hebrew model. 37 The Jews were bidden by their rabbis
to pray thrice daily, facing toward Jerusalem and the Temple, and to
prostrate themselves with forehead to the ground; Mohammed adapted these
rules to Islam. The first chapter of the Koran, which is the basic
prayer of Islam, is essentially Judaic. The lovely greeting of the
Hebrew — Sholom aleichem — parallels the noble “Peace be with you” of
Islam. Finally, the Talmudic heaven, like the Koranic paradise, is one
of frankly physical, as well as ecstat- ically spiritual, delights.</p>
<p>Some of these elements in creed and practice may have been a common
heritage of the Semites; some of them — angels, devils, Satan, heaven,
hell, the resurrection, the Last Judgment — had been taken by the Jews
from Baby- lonia or Persia, and may have gone directly from Persia to
Islam. In Zoro- astrian, as in Mohammedan, eschatology, the resurrected
dead must walk upon a perilous bridge over a deep abyss; the wicked fall
into hell, the good pass into a paradise where they enjoy, among other
dainties, the society of women (houris) whose beauty and ardor will last
forever. To Jewish the- ology, ethics, and ritual, and Persian
eschatology, Mohammed added Arab demonology, pilgrimage, and the Kaaba
ceremony, and made Islam.</p>
<p>His debt to Christianity was slighter. If we may judge from the
Koran, he knew Christianity very imperfectly, its Scriptures only at
second hand, its theology chiefly in Persian Nestorian form. His earnest
preaching of repent- ance in fear of the coming Judgment has a Christian
tinge. He confuses Mary (Heb. Miriam) the mother of Jesus with Miriam
the sister of Moses, and —</p>
<p>i86</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xmisled by the rising worship of Mary in Christendom — thinks that
Christians look upon her as a goddess forming a trinity with the Father
and Christ (v, 1 1 6) . He accepts several uncanonical legends about
Jesus and the Virgin Birth (iii, 47;xxi,9i ) . He modestly acknowledges
the miracles of Jesus, while making no claim to such powers for himself
(iii, 48; v, no) . Like the Doce- tists, he thinks that God put a
phantom in Christ’s place on the cross, and drew Him up to heaven
unhurt. But Mohammed stopped short of making Jesus the Son of God. “Far
is it removed from Allah’s transcendent majesty that He should have a
son” (iv, 17 1). He begs “the people of the Scripture” to “come to an
agreement between us and you, that we shall worship none but Allah”
(iii, 64) .</p>
<p>All in all, despite deprecating intimacy with them, Mohammed was well
disposed toward Christians. “Consort in the world kindly with
Christians” (xxxi, 15). Even after his quarrel with the Jews he
counseled toleration toward the “people of the Book”— i.e., the Jews and
the Christians.* Moham- medanism, though as fanatic as any faith,
concedes that others than Moslems may be saved (v, 73), and requires it
s followers to honor the “Law” (the Old Testament), the Gospel, and the
Koran as all constituting “the Word of God”; here was a refreshing
breadth of view. Mohammed adjures the Jews to obey their Law, Christians
to obey the Gospel (v, 72); but he invites them to accept also the Koran
as God’s latest pronouncement. The earlier revelations had been
corrupted and abused; now the new one would unite them, cleanse them,
and offer all mankind an integrating, invigorating faith.</p>
<p>Three books made and almost filled the Age of Faith: the Bible, the
Tal- mud, the Koran — as if to say that in the rebarbarization of the
Roman Empire only a supernatural ethic could restore order to society
and the soul. All three books were Semitic, and overwhelmingly Judaic.
The drama of medieval history would be the spiritual competition of
these Scriptures and the bloody conflict of their creeds.</p>
