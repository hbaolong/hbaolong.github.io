<h4 id="chapter-iv">CHAPTER IV</h4>
<p>Moliere</p>
<p>1622 — 73</p>
<p>I. THE FRENCH THEATER</p>
<p>I T REMAINED for French drama and poetry to bring Europe under</p>
<p>their sway.</p>
<p>The humor of history arranged that French literature in this age
should take to the stage; that the drama, so long outlawed by the
Church, should be encouraged by Cardinal Richelieu; that Italian comedy
should be im- ported into France by Cardinal Mazarin; and that Louis XIV
should</p>
<p>inherit a taste for the theater from these two ecclesiastics who had
prepared or preserved his power.</p>
<p>The modern drama had reached literary form in Italy under the highly
cultured popes of the Renaissance, and Leo X had attended plays without
demanding that they be fit for virgins. But the Reformation, and the
con- sequent Council of Trent, had put an end to this ecclesiastical
lenience. The drama continued to be tolerated in Italy, said Benedict
XIV, to avoid greater evils, and in Spain because it served the Church.
In France, however, the clergy, shocked by the sexual freedom of the
comic stage, condemned the theater as an enemy to public morals. A long
succession of bishops and theologians ruled that actors were
excommunicated ipso facto, by their very profession; the Paris clergy,
through the authoritative voice of Bossuet, refused them the sacraments
or burial in consecrated ground unless they repented and renounced their
calling. Unable to secure priestly administra- tion of sacramental
matrimony, actors had to content themselves with com- mon-law marriages
of hectic impermanence. French law too pronounced actors infamous, and
excluded them from every honorable employment. Magistrates were
forbidden to attend theatrical representations.</p>
<p>It is one of the outstanding features of modern history that the
theater overcame this resistance. The popular demand for make-believe to
alleviate and avenge reality generated a long supply of farces and
comedies; and the pains of monogamy provided an especially paying
audience for dramas of licit or illicit love. Richelieu apparently
agreed with Leo X that the easiest way to keep the theater within bounds
was to patronize the best rather than condemn all; thereby he might give
a lead to public taste, and bread to decent companies. Note Voltaire’s
report: “Since Cardinal Richelieu</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>CHAP, rv)</p>
<p>MOLIERE</p>
<p>r°5</p>
<p>introduced regular performances of plays at court, which have now
made Paris the rival of Athens, not only was there a special bench for
the</p>
<p>Academy, which included several ecclesiastics among its members, but
also one for the bishops. ” 1 In 1641, presumably at the Cardinal’s
request, Louis XIII took under his protection a group of actors
thereafter known as the Troupe Royale or the Comediens Royaux, gave them
a pension of twelve hundred livres per year, issued an edict
acknowledging the theater to be a legitimate form of entertainment, and
expressed the royal wish that the calling of an actor should no longer
be held prejudicial to his social stand- ing. 2 This troupe established
its theater at the Hotel de Bourgogne, received the official patronage
of Louis XIV, and continued throughout his reign to excel in the
production of tragedies.</p>
<p>To raise the standards of French comedy, Mazarin invited Italian
players to Paris. One of these was Tiberio Fiorelli, whose performance
of the boasting buffoon Scaramuccia made him a favorite with Paris and
the court. He and his fellows probably shared in giving the theatrical
fever to Jean Coquelin IV, and in teaching him the arts of the comic
theater. 3 When “Scaramouche” returned to Ital y (1659) Jean Coquelin,
known to the stage and the world as Moliere, became the chief comedian
to the King, and soon, in the fond judgment of Boileau, the greatest
writer of the reign.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>APPRENTICESHIP</li>
</ol>
<p>A building at 96 Rue St.-Honore in Paris bears an inscription in
letters of gold:</p>
<p>Cette maison a ete construite sur V emplacement</p>
<p>de celle oil est ne</p>
<p>Moliere</p>
<p>le is janvier 1622</p>
<p>“This house was built on the site of that where Moliere was bom</p>
<p>Jan uary 15, 1622.” It was the home of Jean Baptiste Coquelin
III,</p>
<p>upholsterer and decorator. His wife Marie Cresse had brought him a
dowry of 2,200 livres. She gave him six children, and then died, after
ten years of marriage. Jean Baptiste Coquelin IV, her first child,
remembered her only vaguely, and never mentioned her in his plays. The
father married again (1633), but, as this stepmother died in 1637, it
was the father who bore the brunt of his son’s genius, directed his
education, and thought to mol d his career. In 1631 Jean Coquelin III
became valet tapissier de chambre du rot — superintendent of the royal
upholstery, with the privilege of making the</p>
<p>106 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>royal bed and of living in the King’s household, at an annual salary
of three hundred livres; a modest sum, but only three months of
attendance were required in any year. The father had bought the office
from his brother, and planned to transmit it to his son. In 1637 Louis
XIII recognized Jean Coquelin IV as rightful heir to the position; and
if the father’s aspira - tions had been realized Moliere might have been
known to history — if at all — as the man who made the King’s bed.
However, a grandfathe r had a liking for the theater, and took the boy
with him now and then to the performances.</p>
<p>To fit him for making the King’s bed, Jean IV was sent to the
Jesuit</p>
<p>College de Clermont, the alma mater of heretics. He learned
considerable Latin, read Terence profitably, and doubtless took
interest, perhaps part, in the dramas staged by the Jesuits as a device
for educating their students in Latin, literature, and speech. According
to Voltaire, Jean also received instruction from the philosopher
Gassendi, who had been engaged as tutor for a rich classmate; in any
case Jean learned much about Epicurus, and translated a considerable
portion of Lucretius’ Epicurean epic, De rerum natura. (Some lines in Le
Misanthrope 4 are almost a translation of a passage in Lucretius. 5 ) It
is probable that Jean, before ending his youth, had lost his faith.
0</p>
<p>After five years at college Jean studied law; he appears to have
practiced briefly in the courts. For some months he followed his
father’s profession (1642). In that year he met Madeleine Bejart, then a
gay lady of twenty- four. Five years earlier she had been the mistress
of the Comte de Modene; he graciously acknowledged the child she bore
him, and let his son act as godfather at the christening. Jean, now
twenty, was attracted by her beauty, her cheerful and kindly
disposition. In all probability she accepted him as a lover. Her passion
for the theater joined with other factors in deciding him to turn his
back upon upholstery, to sign away, for 630 livres, his right to succeed
his father as a valet tapissier to the King, and to plunge into the
profession of an actor (1643). He left his father, and went to live in
the home of Madeleine Bejart. 7 With her, her two brothers, and some
others, he entered into a formal contract establishing the Illustre
Theatre (June 30, 1643). The Comedie-F ran^aise regards that contract as
the beginning of its long and distinguished career. As was the custom
with actors, Jean now took a stage name, and became Moliere.</p>
<p>The new company hired a tennis court for its theater, presented a
variety of plays, and went bankrupt; in the year 1645 Moliere was thrice
arrested for debt. His father, hoping that the youth had been cured of
stage fever, paid his debts and secured his release. But Moliere
reorganized the Illustre Theatre, and went off on a tour of the
provinces. The Due d’Lpernon, governor of Guienne, gave the company his
support. In a wearing series</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>MOLI&amp;RE</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>of successes and failures, the troupe passed from Narbonne to
Toulouse, Albi, Carcassonne, Nantes, Agen, Grenoble, Lyons, Montpellier,
Bordeaux, Beziers, Dijon, Avignon, Rouen. Moliere rose to be manager
(1650), and by a hundred expedients kept the company solvent and fed. In
1653 the Prince de Conti, his old schoolfellow, lent his name and
support to the players, probably because his secretary admired the
actress Mile, du Parc. But in 1655 the Prince had a religious stroke,
and informed the company that his conscience forbade his connection with
the theater. Later he publicly denounced the stage, and Moliere in
particular, as a corrupter of youth, an enemy to morality and
Christianity.</p>
<p>Gradually, amid these vicissitudes, the troupe improved its
competence, income, and repertoire. Moliere learned the art and tricks
of the theater. By 1655 he was writing as well as acting plays. By 1658
he felt strong enough to challenge the pre-emption of the Paris stage by
t he King’s players at the Hotel de Bourgogne, and a private troupe that
was operating the Theatre du Marais. From Rouen he and Madeleine Bejart
came to Paris to prepare the ground. He visited his father, and won
forgiveness for his sins and his career. He persuaded Philippe I Due
d’Orleans, to take the company under his protection, and to secure for
it a hearing at the court.</p>
<p>On October 24, 1658, this “Troupe de Monsieur” presented before the
King, in the guardroom of the Louvre, Corneille’s tragedy Nicomede.
Moliere played the main part, not very successfully, for he suffered,
Voltaire tells us, “from a kind of hiccup which was quite unsuited
to</p>
<p>serious roles,” but which “served only to make his acting in comedy
the more enjoyable.” 8 He saved th e day by following the tragedy with a
comedy now lost; he acted it with a verve and gaiety, a rising eyebrow
and babbling mouth, that made the audience wonder why he had ever played
tragedy at all. The King was young enough to enjoy the fun, and man
enough to appreciate Moliere’s courage. He issued instructions that the
Troupe de Monsieur should share the Salle du Petit Bourbon with the
Italian company of Scaramouche. There too the newcomers failed when they
attempted tragedies, in which they fell short of the royal players at
the Hotel de Bourgogne, and they succeeded in comedies, above all in
those that Moliere composed. They continued nevertheless to produce
tragedies. The leading ladies felt that they shone better in serious
drama, and Moliere himself was never content to be a comedian. The
struggles and absurdities of life had developed in him a vein of
melancholy, and he found it tragical to be always comical. Moreover, he
had tired of the comedies of amorous intrigue, of the old stock
characters and whipping boys, mostly echoes of Italy. Looking about him
in Paris, he saw things that seemed to him quite as laughable as
Polichinelle and Scaramouche.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>

Menander,” he was quoted as saying; “1 have only to study the world.”

<li>MOLIERE AND THE LADIES</li>
</ol>
<p>There was, for example, the Hotel de Rambouillet, where men and</p>
<p>women were making a fetish of delicate manners and perfumed speech.
Moliere wrote Les Precieuses ridicules; its production (November 18,</p>
<ol start="1659" type="1">
<li>began the French comedy of manners and Moli&amp;re’s fortune and
fame. The Laughable Exquisites was brief enough to be absorbed in an
hour, and sharp enough to leave a lasting sting. Two cousins, Magdalon
and Cathos, enveloped in seven veils of refinement, protest against
their matter-of-fact short-of- francs elders’ anxiety to have them
marry.</li>
</ol>
<p>gorgibus. What see you in them to find fault with?</p>
<p>magdalon. Fine gallantry of theirs, indeed! What, to begin im-</p>
<p>mediately with matrimony! . . . Were the whole world like you,</p>
<p>romance would be ended at once. . . . Matrimony should never be</p>
<p>brought about till after other adventures. A lover, to be
agreeable,</p>
<p>must understand how to utter fine sentiments, to sigh forth the</p>
<p>soft, the tender, the passionate, and his address must be
according</p>
<p>to the rules. In the first place he should behold, either at
church</p>
<p>or in the park, or at some public ceremony, the person of whom</p>
<p>he becomes enamored, or else he should be fatally introduced to</p>
<p>her by a relation or friend, and go from her melancholy and pen-</p>
<p>sive. He conceals his passion for some time from the beloved ob-</p>
<p>ject, but pays her several visits, at which some discourse about</p>
<p>gallantry never fails to be brought upon the carpet to exercise
the</p>
<p>wits of all the company. . . . The day comes for him to declare</p>
<p>himself, which usually should be done in the walk of some garden,</p>
<p>while the company is at a distance. This declaration is met by
im-</p>
<p>mediate resentment, which appears by our coloring, and which,</p>
<p>for a while, banishes the lover from our presence. He finds
after-</p>
<p>wards the way to pacify us, to accustom us insensibly to hear his</p>
<p>passion, and to draw from us that confession which causes so</p>
<p>much trouble. Then follow the adventures: the rivals that thwart</p>
<p>an established inclination, the persecutions of fathers, the
jeal-</p>
<p>ousies arising from false appearances, the complainings, the de-</p>
<p>spair, the running off with, and its consequences. Thus are
things</p>
<p>carried on in a handsome manner, and these are the rules that</p>
<p>cannot be dispensed with in a genteel piece of gallantry. But to</p>
<p>come point blank to the conjugal union! — to make no love but</p>
<p>by the marriage contract, and to take a romance by the tail —</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MOLI&amp;RE 109</p>
<p>once more, dear father, nothing can be more mechanic than such</p>
<p>a proceeding, and I’m sick at heart with merely the idea that it</p>
<p>gives me. . . .</p>
<p>cathos. For myself, uncle, all I can say is that I think matrimony
a</p>
<p>mighty shocking thing. How can one endure the thought of lying</p>
<p>by a man that’s really naked? 10</p>
<p>Two valets borrow their masters’ raiment, disguise themselves as
a</p>
<p>marquis and a general, and court the two ladies with all the
paraphernalia of gallantry and persiflage. Their masters break in upon
them, tear off their plumage, and leave the young women faced with the
almost naked truth. As in most of Moliere’s comedi es of sex, there are
some rough pas- sages, and some horseplay, but so keen a satire of
social follies that the effect became an event in the history of
manners. An uncertain tradition credits a woman in the audience with
rising amid the audience and crying out, “Courage! Courage! Moliere,
this is good comedy.” 11 One habitue of Mme. de Rambouillet’s salon,
emerging from the performance, was re - ported to have said, “Yesterday
we admired all the absurdities which have been so delicately and
sensibly criticized; but, in the words of St. Remy to Clovis, we must
now burn what we have adored, and adore what we have burned.” 12 The
Marquise de Rambouillet met the attack with genius by arranging with
Moliere to give a special performance of the play for the benefit of her
salon; he repaid her courtesy with a preface in which he claimed to have
satirized not her circle but its imitators. In any case the reign of the
precieuses ended. Boileau, in his tenth satire, referred to “those beaux
esprits, yeste rday so renowned, whom Moli&amp;re has deflated with one
blow of his art.”</p>
<p>The play succeeded so well that the price of admission was doubled
after the premiere. In its first year it was performed forty-four times.
The King commanded three performances for the court, attended all three,
and gave the company three thousand livres. By February of 1660 the
grateful company had paid the author 999 livres in royalties. But he had
made a mistake by inserting into the play a satirical reference to</p>
<p>the actors of the Theatre Royal 〔Troupe Royale〕 : none but they
are</p>
<p>capable of gaining things a reputation; the rest are ignorant
creatures who speak their parts just as one talks; these don’t
understand how</p>
<p>to make the verses roar, or to pause at a beautiful passage. How can
it be known where the fine lines are if the actor does not stop at</p>
<p>them, and apprize you thereby to applaud? 13</p>
<p>The troupe at the Hotel de Bourgogne expressed open contempt of</p>
<p>Moli&amp;re as unable to produce tragedy, and as capable only of
coarse</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>comedy. Moliere strengthened their case by writing and presenting a
middling farce, Le Cocu imaginaire — The Imaginary Cuckold — though the
King was pleased to see this nine times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the old Louvre was undergoing alterations; the Salle du</p>
<p>Petit Bourbon was incontinently demolished, and for a time it seemed
that Moliere’s Troupe de Monsieur would be stageless. The King,
always</p>
<p>friendly, came to his rescue by assigning to him, in the
Palais-Royal, the salle in which Richelieu had had plays performed.
There, as an almost physical part of the court, Moliere’s company
remained till his death. His first production in this new home was his
last attempt at tragedy, Don Garde. He thought, with some reason, that
the pompous rhetorical style of tragedy as developed by Corneille and
played at the Hotel de Bourgogne was unnatural; he aspired to a simpler
and more natural style. Had the classical dominance (and his hiccup)
allowed him he might have produced successful combinations of tragedy
with comedy, as in Shakespeare; and, indeed, his greatest comedies have
a touch of tragedy. But Don Garde failed, despite the efforts of the
King to buttress it by attending three performances. Moliere was
designed to suffer tragedy, not to play it.</p>
<p>So he returned to comedy. UBcole des marls — The School for Husbands
— had a solacing success, playing daily from June 24 to September 1 1,
1661. It foreshadowed the marriage of Moliere, then thirty-nine, with
Armande Bejart, then eighteen; its problem was, How should a young woman
be trained to be a good and faithful wife? The brothers Ariste and
Sganarelle are fortunate in being the guardians of the girls they plan
to marry. Ariste, who is sixty, treats his eighteen-year-old ward,
Leonor, quite leniently:</p>
<p>I’ve not made crimes of little liberties. I’ve continually complied
with</p>
<p>minds of young people; and the world is a school which, in my</p>
<p>opinion, teaches the way of living better than any book. She
likes</p>
<p>to spend money on clothes, linen, and new fashions. … I try to</p>
<p>gratify her wishes; these are pleasures we should allow young women
when our circumstances can afford it. 14</p>
<p>Sganarelle, the younger brother, derides Ariste as a fool seduced by
the latest fancies. He laments the passing of the old morality, the
looseness of the new, the insolence of liberated youth. He proposes a
stern discipline to train his ward Isabelle to be an obedient wife:</p>
<p>She shall be dressed in becoming clothes . . . Staying at home
like</p>
<p>a discreet person, she shall apply herself entirely to affairs of
house-</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>MOLIERE</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>wifery, darning linen in her leisure hours, or knitting stockings
for</p>
<p>her diversion. She . . . shall not stir abroad without someone to
watch her. … I will not wear horns if I can help it.</p>
<p>After an incredible intrigue (imitated from a Spanish comedy)
Isabelle runs away with an ingenious lover, while Leonor marries Ariste
and re- mains faithful to him to the end of the play.</p>
<p>Moliere was evidently debating with himself. On February 20, 1662,
now forty, he married a woman less than half his age. Moreover, Armande
Be j art was the daughter of Madeleine Bejart, with whom Moliere had
cohabited twenty years before. His enemies accused him of marrying his
own illegitimate daughter. Montfleury, leader of the rival troupe at the
Hotel de Bourgogne, wrote to Louis XIV to this effect in 1663; Louis</p>
<p>replied by standing godfather to Moliere’s first child by
Armande.</p>
<p>Madeleine, when Moliere met her, had been too lavish of her person to
give us any certainty of Armande’s parentage. Moliere apparently did not
think himself her father; and we may allow that he was slightly better
informed on the point tfran we can be.</p>
<p>Armande had grown up as the spoiled pet of the troupe; Moliere had
seen her almost every day; he had loved her as a child long before he
had known her as a woman. She was by this time an accomplished actress.
With such a background she was not made for monogamy, least of all with
a man who had outworn the spirit of youth. She loved the pleasures of
life, and indulged in flirtations that were widely interpreted as
infidelities. Moliere suffered, his friends and foes gossiped. Ten
months after his mar- riage he tried to salve his wounds by criticizing
male jealousy and defend- ing female emancipation. He tried to be
Ariste, but Armande could not be Leonor. Perhaps he failed to be Ariste,
for he was as impatient as any theatrical producer. In the Impromptu of
Versailles (October, 1663) he described himself as saying to his wife,
“Hold your peace, wife; you are an ass”; whereto she replies, “Thank
you, good husband. See how it is: matrimony alters people strangely; you
would not have said this a year and a half ago.” 15</p>
<p>He continued his meditations on jealousy and liberty in L’Ecole
des</p>
<p>femmes, which had its premiere on December 26, 1662. Almost the open-
ing lines struck the theme of cuckoldry. Arnolphe, played by Moliere, is
again the old-fashioned tyrant who believes that a woman loosed is a
loose woman, and that the only means of g uaranteeing a “wife’s fidelity
is to train her to modest servitude, keep her under strict watch, and
skimp her education. Agnes, his ward and prospective bride, grows up in
such delec- table innocence that she asks Arnolphe, in a line that
echoed through France, “si les enfants . . . se faisoient par Foreille”
— if children are be-</p>

<p>gotten through the ear . 16 As Arnolphe has told her nothing about
love, she accepts with guileless pleasure the attentions of Horace, who
finds his way to her during her guardian’s brief absence. When Arnolphe
returns she gives him an objective account of Horace’s procedure:</p>
<p>arnolphe. Well, but what did he do when he was alone with you?</p>
<p>agnes. He said he loved me with an unequalled passion, and told me,
in the finest language in the world, things that nothing ever can</p>
<p>come up to; the agreeableness whereof delighted me every time I</p>
<p>heard him speak, and raised within me a certain, I know not what,</p>
<p>emotion which entirely charmed me.</p>
<p>arnolphe (aside). O tormenting inquiry into a fatal secret, where</p>
<p>the inquirer only suffers all the pain! (Aloud.) Besides all this
talk,</p>
<p>all these pretty ways, didn’t he bestow some kisses on you, too?</p>
<p>agnes. Oh, to that degree! He took my hands and arms, and was never
weary of kissing ’em.</p>
<p>arnolphe. Did he take nothing else from you, Agnes? (Seeing her
at</p>
<p>a loss.) Hah?</p>
<p>agnes. Why, he did —</p>
<p>arnolphe. What?</p>
<p>agnes. Take —</p>
<p>ARNOLPHE. How?</p>
<p>AGNES. The —</p>
<p>arnolphe. What d’ye mean?</p>
<p>agnes. I durst not tell you; for, maybe, you’ll be angry wi’ me.</p>
<p>arnolphe. No.</p>
<p>agnes. Yes, but you will.</p>
<p>arnolphe. Lack-a- day, I won’t.</p>
<p>agnes. Swear faith, then.</p>
<p>arnolphe. Well, faith.</p>
<p>agnes. He took — You’ll be in a passion.</p>
<p>arnolphe. No.</p>
<p>agnes. Yes.</p>
<p>arnolphe. No, no, no, no. What the deuce is this mystery? What
did</p>
<p>he take from you.</p>
<p>agnes. He —</p>
<p>arnolphe (aside). I suffer damnation.</p>
<p>agnes. He took away the ribbon you gave me; to tell you the truth, I
could not help it.</p>
<p>arnolphe (recovering himself). No matter for the ribbon. But I
want</p>
<p>to know whether he did nothing but kiss your hands.</p>
<p>agnes. Why! do people do other things?</p>
<p>arnolphe. No, no. . . . But in short I must tell you, that to
accept</p>
<p>caskets and hearken to the idle stories of these powdered fops,
to</p>
<p>permit ’em, in a languishing wav, to kiss your hands and charm</p>

<p>MOLIERE</p>
<p>“3</p>
<p>your heart in this manner, is a mortal sin, the greatest that can
be</p>
<p>committed.</p>
<p>agnes. A sin, d’ye say! The reason, pray?</p>
<p>arnolphe. The reason? Why, the reason is, because it’s declared
that</p>
<p>agnes. Offended! But wherefore should it be offended? Lack-a-day!</p>
<p>’tis so sweet, so pleasant! 1 admire at the delight one finds in’t,
and didn’t know these things before.</p>
<p>arnolphe. Ay, there’s a great deal of pleasure in all these
tendernesses, these complaisant discourses, these fond embraces; but
they</p>
<p>should be tasted in an honest manner, and the sin should be taken</p>
<p>away by marrying.</p>
<p>agnes. Is it no more a sin when a body’s married?</p>
<p>arnolphe. No.</p>
<p>agnes. Then marry me out of hand, I pray. 17</p>
<p>Of course Agnes soon runs off to Horace. Arnolphe recaptures her, and
is about to beat her when her sweet voice and form unnerve him; and per-
haps when Moliere wrote Arnolphe’s lines he was thinking of Armande:</p>
<p>That speech and that look disarm my fury, and produce a return of</p>
<p>tenderness which effaces all her guilt. How strange it is to be in
love! and that men should be subject to such weakness for these
traitresses! Everybody knows their imperfection; they’re nothing but
extrava -</p>
<p>gance and indiscretion; their mind is wicked and their understanding
weak; nothing is more frail, nothing more unsteady, nothing more</p>
<p>false, and yet, for all that, one does everything in the world for
the</p>
<p>sake of these animals. 18</p>
<p>In the end she eludes him and m arries Horace; and Arnolphe’s friend
Chrysalde consoles him with the thought that abstention from marriage is
the only sure way of avoiding the growth of horns.</p>
<p>The play delighted the audience; it was performed thirty-one times in
its first ten weeks, and the King was young enough to enjoy its laxity.
But the more conservative elements at the court condemned the comedy as
immoral; procreation through the ear proved unpopular with the ladies;
the Prince de Conti denounced, as the most scandalous thing ever staged,
the second-act scene between Arnolphe and Agnes quoted above; Bossuet
anathematized the entire play; some magistrates called for its
suppression as a threat to morality and religion. The rival troupe
laughed at the vulgar- ities of the dialogue, the contradictions in
characterization, and the hasty incredibilities of the plot. For a time
the play “made the conversation of every house in Paris .” 19</p>
<p>Moliere was too much of a fighter to let these criticisms go
unnoticed.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>1 14</p>
<p>In a one-act piece presented at the Palais-Royal June 1, 1663, La
Critique de VBcole des femmes, he pictured a gathering of his critics,
allowed them to voice their objections forcefully, and made hardly any
answer except to let the critique weaken itself through exaggeration,
and be voiced by ridiculous characters. The Hotel de Bourgogne kept up
this guerre comique by producing a skit called The Counter critic; and
Moliere satirized the royal troupe in V Impromptu de Versailles (October
18, 1663). The King stood loyally by Moliere, invited him to dinner, 20
and now gave him an annual pension of a thousand livres, not as
comedien, but as excellent podte . 21 Time also gave the victory to
Moliere, and today, L’Bcole des femmes is rated as the first great
comedy of the French theater.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>L’AFFAIRE TARTUFFE</li>
</ol>
<p>Moliere paid a price for the King’s favor. Louis so liked his wit
and</p>
<p>courage that he made him a leading organizer of the entertainments at
Versailles and St. -Germain. One such fete, Les Plaisirs de Vile
enchantee, filled a week (May 7-13, 1664) with jousts, feasting, music,
ballet, danc- ing, and drama, all presented in the park and palace of
Versailles under illumination by torches and chandeliers holding four
thousand candles. Moliere received six thousand livres for his labors on
this festival. Some scholars have mourned that the King used so much of
Moliere’s genius to provide lighthearted entertainment at the court, and
they have imagined the masterpieces that might have matured if the poet
in the comedian had had more time to think and write. But he was under
pressure from his company too, and in any case his cares and
responsibilities as manager and actor would have kept him from any ivory
tower. Many an author writes better under pressure than at leisure;
leisure relaxes the mind, urgency stimulates it. Moliere’s greatest play
was first produced on May 12, 1664, during the height, and as part, of
the Plaisirs de rile enchantee.</p>
<p>Tartuffe, in this premiere, hardly fitted the festival, for it was a
merci- less exposure of hypocrisy taking a pious and moralistic dress. A
religious fraternity of laymen, the Compagnie du Saint Sacrement, later
known as the Cabale des Devots, had already pledged its members to work
for the suppression of the play. The King, whose liaison with La
Valliere had aroused much criticism from the devout, was in a mood to
agree with Moliere; but, having seen the comedy in its private
performance at Ver- sailles, lie withheld permission to present it to
the public of Paris in the Palais-Royal. He solaced Moliere by inviting
him to read Tartuffe at</p>
<p>Fontainebleau to a select group including a papal legate, who raised
no objection known to history (July 21, 1664). In that month the
drama</p>
<p>CHAP, rv)</p>
<p>MOLIERE</p>
<p>”5</p>
<p>was performed in the home of the Duke and Duchess (Henrietta Anne) of
Orleans, in the presence of the Queen, the Queen Mother, and the King.
The way was being prepared for a public presentation when, in August,
Pierre Roulle, vicar of St.-Barthelemy, published a tribute to the King
for prohibiting the play, and took occasion to denounce Moliere as “a
man, or rather a demon in flesh and habited as a man, the most notably
impious creature and libertine who ever lived.” For writing Tartuffe,
“to the derision of the whole Church,” said Pere Roulle, Moliere “should
be burned at the stake as a foretaste of the fires of hell.” 22 The King
rebuked Roulle, but continued to withhold permission for a public
performance of Tartuffe. To show where he stood the King raised
Moliere’s annual pension to six thousand livres, and took over from
“Monsieur” the pro - tection of Moliere’s company; henceforth it was the
Troupe du Roi.</p>
<p>The controversy simmered for two years. Then Moliere read to Louis a
revised version of the play, with some added lines pointing out that the
satire was not of honest faith but only of hypocrisy. Madame Henrietta
supported the author’s plea for permission to produce. Louis gave a
verbal consent; and while he went off to war in Flanders the first
public presenta- tion of Tartuffe was staged at the Palais-Royal on
August 5, 1667, three years after its court premiere. The next morning
the president of the Par- Iement of Paris, who belonged to the Company
of the Blessed Sacrament, ordered the theater closed, and all its
posters torn down. On August 1 1 the Archbishop of Paris forbade, on
pain of excommunication, the reading, hearing, or performance of the
comedy, in public or in private. Moliere announced that if this triumph
of “les Tar tuff es” continued he would re - tire from the stage. The
King, returning to Paris, bade the angry dramatist be patient. Moliere
managed it, and was rewarded at last by the removal of the royal
prohibition. On February 5, 1669, the play began a successful run of
twenty-eight consecutive performances. At the public premiere the crowd
seeking admission was so large and eager that many persons came near to
suffocation. It was the drame celdbre of Moliere’s career. Of all French
classic dramas it has received the greatest number of performances —
2,657 ( t0 i960) at the Comedie-F rangaise alone.</p>
<p>How far do the contents of the play explain its long postponement,
and its continuing popularity? They explain the first by their frontal
attack upon hypocritical piety; they explain the second by the power and
bril- liance of their satire. Everything in that satire is, of course,
exaggerated: hypocrisy is rarely so reckless and complete as in
Tartuffe, stupidity is seldom so extravagant as in Orgon, and no maid is
so successfully insolent as Dorine. The denouement is incredible, as
almost always in Moliere; this did not trouble him; after he had
presented his picture and indictment of hypocrisy, any deus or rex ex
machina would do to untangle the plot into</p>
<p>II 6 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>triumphant virtue and punished vice. Quite likely the satire was
aimed at the Compagnie du Saint Sacrement, whose members, even if
laymen, under- took to direct consciences, to report private sins to
public authorities, and to interfere in families to promote religious
loyalty and devotion. The play twice referred to a cabale (lines 397 and
1705), evidently alluding to the Cabale des Devots. Soon after the
play’s public premiere the Company of the Blessed Sacrament was
dissolved.</p>
<p>Orgon, the rich bourgeois, first sees TartufFe in church, and is
impressed. Ah, had you but seen him . . . you would have loved him as
well as</p>
<p>I do. He came every day to church, with a composed mien, and</p>
<p>knelt just near me. He attracted the eyes of the whole congregation
by the fervency with which he sent up his prayers to Heaven. He</p>
<p>sighed and groaned very heavily, and at every moment he humbly</p>
<p>kissed the earth. And when I was going out he would advance before me
to offer me holy water at the door. Understanding … his lowly</p>
<p>condition, … I made him presents, but he always modestly would</p>
<p>offer to return me part. … At length Heaven moved me to take him</p>
<p>home, since which everything seems to prosper. I see he reproves</p>
<p>without distinction, and that even with regard to my wife he is</p>
<p>extremely cautious of my honor. He acquaints me who ogles her .
23</p>
<p>But TartufFe does not similarly impress Orgon’s wife and children.
His hearty appetite, his love for tidbits, his round paunch and rubicund
face, dull for them the point of his homilies. Orgon’s brother -in-law,
Cleante, begs him to see the difference between hypocrisy and
religion:</p>
<p>As I see no character in life greater or more valuable than to be
truly devout, nor anything nobler or fairer than the fervor of a
sincere</p>
<p>piety, so I think nothing more abominable than the outside daubing of
a pretended zeal, than those mountebanks, those devotees in show . . .
who make a trade of godliness, and who would purchase honors and
reputation with a hypocritical turning up of the eyes and affected
transports.</p>
<p>Orgon, however, continues to take TartufFe at phrase value, submits
to his guidance, invokes God’s aid upon him when he belches, and
proposes to give him in marriage his daughter Mariane, who violently
prefers Valere. The r eal heroine of the piece is Mariane’s maid Dorine,
who, as in classic comedy, seems to prove that Providence has
distributed genius in inverse ratio to money. Delightful is her
reception of Tartuffe’s first entry upon the stage:</p>
<p>TartufFe 〔seeing Dorine, speaks aloud to his servants! .
Laurence,</p>
<p>lock up my hair-cloth and scourge, and beg of Heaven ever to en-</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>MOLI&amp;RE</p>
<p>ll 7</p>
<p>lighten you with grace. If anybody comes to see me, I am gone to</p>
<p>the prisons to distribute my alms.</p>
<p>dorine (aside). What affectation and roguery!</p>
<p>tartuffe. What do you want?</p>
<p>dorine. To tell you —</p>
<p>tartuffe (drawing a handkerchief out of his pocket). Oh! lack-a-</p>
<p>day! pray take me this handkerchief before you speak.</p>
<p>dorine. What for?</p>
<p>tartuffe. Cover that bosom, which I can’t bear to see. Such
objects</p>
<p>hurt the soul, and usher in sinful thoughts.</p>
<p>dorine. You mightily melt, then, at a temptation, and the flesh makes
a great impression upon your senses? Truly, I can’t tell what heat</p>
<p>may inflame you; but, for my part, I am not so apt to hanker.
Now,</p>
<p>I could see you stark naked from head to foot, and that whole
hide</p>
<p>of yours not tempt me at all . 24</p>
<p>The next scene is the core of the comedy. Tartuffe tries to make love
to Orgon’s w ife, Elmire, and uses pious language in his plea. His
treachery is reported to Orgon, who refuses to believe it; and to show
his trust in Tartuffe he gives over to him all his property. Tartuffe
resigns himself to accept it, saying, “Heaven’s will be done in all
things .” 25 The situation is dissolved by Elmire, who, having hidden
her husband under a table, sends for Tartuffe, gives him a little
encouragement, and soon lures him into at- tempts at amorous
exploration. She pretends compliance, but professes scruples of
conscience, which Tartuffe handles with expert casuistry; evi- dently
Moliere had read and relished Pascal’s Provincial Letters .</p>
<p>tartuffe. If nothing but Heaven obstructs my wishes, ’tis a
trifle</p>
<p>with me to remove such an obstacle. Heaven, ’tis true, forbids cer
-</p>
<p>tain gratifications. But there are ways of compounding those</p>
<p>matters. It is a science to stretch the strings of conscience
accord-</p>
<p>ing to the different exigencies of the case, and to rectify the</p>
<p>immorality of the action by the purity of our intention . 26</p>
<p>Orgon comes out from his hiding, and angrily bids Tartuffe leave the
house, but Tartuffe explains to him that the house, by Orgon’s recently
signed deed, belongs to Tartuffe. Moliere, not very ingeniously, cuts
this knot by having the King’s agents opportunely discover that Tartuffe
is a long-sought-for criminal. Orgon recovers his property, Valere gets
Mariane, and the play concludes with a melodious paean to the justice
and benevo- lence of the King.</p>
<p>1 1 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>V. THE AMOROUS ATHEIST</p>
<p>The royal benevolence must have been strained by the next audacity of
Moli&amp;re. At the height of the war over Tartuffe, and while the
Devots were still in triumph over the suppressing of the play, he staged
at the Palais-Royal (February 15, 1665) Le Festin de pierre — The Feast
of the Stone Statue — telling in rollicking prose the already oft-told
tale of Don Juan, and turning that reckless Casanova into an arrogant
atheist. Taking the shell of the story from Tirso de Molina and others,
Moli&amp;re filled it with a remarkable study of a man who enjoys
wickedness for its own sake and as a challenge to God. The play is an
astonishing echo of the great debate that was embroiling religion with
philosophy.</p>
<p>Don Juan Tenorio is a marquis, and acknowledges obligations to
his</p>
<p>caste; otherwise he proposes to enjoy any pleasure he has an itch
for. His valet, Sganarelle, calculates at 1,003 the number of women whom
his master has seduced and deserted. “Constancy,” says Juan, “is only
fit for fools. . . . I can’t refuse my heart to any lovely creature I
see.” 27 Such an ethic craves a corresponding theology, so Juan, for his
own comfort, is an atheist. His servant tries to reason with him:</p>
<p>sganarelle. Is it possible that you don’t believe in Heaven?</p>
<p>jltan. Forget it.</p>
<p>sgan. That is, you don’t. And Hell?</p>
<p>juan. Eh!</p>
<p>scan. Likewise. And the Devil, if you please?</p>
<p>juan. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>sgan. Again very little. Don’t you believe at all in another
life?</p>
<p>juan. Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>sgan. Here’s a man I’ll be hard put to convert. But tell me, surely
you believe in le moine bourru ?*</p>
<p>juan. Plague on the fool.</p>
<p>sgan. Now, that I can’t suffer; for there’s nothing better
established than th is moine bourru, and I’ll be hanged if he isn’t
real. But a</p>
<p>man must believe something. What do you believe? . . .</p>
<p>juan. I believe that two and two are four, and that four and four are
eight.</p>
<p>sgan. A lovely creed, and beautiful articles of faith! Your
religion,</p>
<p>then, so far as I can see, is arithmetic? As for me, sir, … I
under-</p>
<p>stand full well that this world is not a mushroom that grew in a</p>
<p>single night. I would like to ask you who made these trees, these</p>
<p>• Literally, “the surly monk”— a pretended ghost used by nurses and
mothers to frighten children.</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MOLIERE 119</p>
<p>rocks, this earth, and that sky up there; was all this built by
itself?</p>
<p>Look at yourself, for example; here you are; did you make your-</p>
<p>self, or wasn’t it necessary that your father should enlarge your</p>
<p>mother to make you? Can you behold all the inventions of which</p>
<p>the human machine is composed, without admiring how one part</p>
<p>sets another working? . . . Whatever you may say, there is some-</p>
<p>thing marvelous in man, which all the pundits will never explain.</p>
<p>Isn’t it wonderful to see me here, and that I have in my head some
-</p>
<p>thing that thinks a hundred different things in a moment, and</p>
<p>makes my body do what I wish? I want to clap my hands, raise</p>
<p>my arm, lift my eyes to the sky, lower my head, move my feet,</p>
<p>go to the right, to the left, forward, to the rear, turn. (He
falls</p>
<p>while turning.)</p>
<p>juan. Good! Your argument has a broken nose . 28</p>
<p>In the next scene the tilt between Juan and religion takes another
form. He meets a beggar, who tells him that he prays every day for those
who give him alms. “Surely,” says Juan, “a man who prays every day must
be very well off.” On the contrary, answers the beggar, “most often I
have not even a piece of bread.” Juan offers him a louis d’or if he will
swear an oath; the beggar refuses — “I’d rather die of hunger.” Juan is
a bit startled by this fortitude. He hands over the coin, as he says,
“for love of human- ity .” 28 All the opera -going world knows the
denouement. Juan comes upon a statue of the Commander, whose daughter he
had seduced, and whose life he had taken. The statue invites Juan to
dinner; Juan comes, gives him his hand, and is led into hell. The
infernal apparatus of the medieval stage ap- pears; “thunder and
lightning fall with great noise upon Don Juan; the earth opens and
swallows him; a vast fire rises from the spot where he has fallen.”</p>
<p>The first night’s audience was shocked by Moliire’s exposition of
Juan’s unbelief. It may have allowed that he had exposed Juan’s
worthless char - acter as well as his lack of theology, that the Don had
been revealed as a brute without conscience or tenderness, spreading
deception and grief wherever he went; and it may have observed that the
villain’s victims were presented with all the author’s sympathy. But it
noted that the answer to atheism had been put into the mouth of a fool
who believed in bogeys more firmly than in God, and it wa s not
mollified by Juan’s final damnation, for it saw him descending into hell
without a word of repentance or fear. After the premiere Moliere toned
down the most offensive passages, but public opinion was not appeased.
On April 18, 1665, the Sieur de Rochemont, avocat en Parlement,
published Observations sur une comSdie de Molibe, in which he described
Le Festin de pierre as “truly devilish . . . Nothing</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>more impious has ever appeared, even in pagan times”; and the King
was exhorted to suppress the play:</p>
<p>While this noble prince devotes all his care to maintaining
religion,</p>
<p>Moliere is working to destroy it. . . . There is no man so little
en-</p>
<p>lightened in the doctrine of the faith who, having seen this play . .
. , can affirm that Moliere, so long as he persists in presenting it, is
worthy to participate in the sacraments, or to be received into
penitence with- out a public reparation. 30</p>
<p>Louis continued his favor to Moliere. Le Festin de pierre ran three
days a week from February 15 to Palm Sunday, when it was withdrawn. It
did not return to the boards till four years after the dramatist’s
death, and then</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MERIDIAN</li>
</ol>
<p>Not content with the enemies that he had made, Moliere proceeded to
attack the medical profession. He had pictured Don Juan as being “im -
pious in medicine” and rating medicine “one of the greatest errors of
man - kind.” 32 He had discovered in person the deficiencies and
pretenses of seventeenth-century physicians. He thought that doctors had
killed his son by prescribing antimony, and he saw that they were
helpless against his own advancing tuberculosis. 33 The King too was
rebelling against weekly purges and bleedings; according to Moliere it
was Louis who prompted him to put the doctors on the grill. So,
borrowing from old comedies on this ancient theme, he wrote in five days
V Amour medecin. It was produced at Versailles on September 15, 1665,
before the King, who “was heartily amused”; and it met with an hilarious
reception when it was staged a week later at the Palais-Royal. A woman
is ill; four doctors are called in; they enter into private
consultation, but discuss only their own affairs. When the father
insists upon a decision and a remedy, one prescribes an enema, another
swears that an enema will kill the patient. She gets better without
medicine, which infuriates the doctors. “It is better to die according
to the rules,” cries Dr. Bahys, “than to recover contrary to</p>
<p>them.” 34</p>
<p>On August 6, 1666, Moliere presented another short piece, Le Medecin
ntalgre lui , as a merry prelude to Le Misanthrope, designed to offset
the</p>
<p>CHAP, rv)</p>
<p>MOL I ERE</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>gloom of that paean to pessimism. It does not repay reading today.
Moliere hardly intended these satires on medicine to be taken seriously.
We note that he kept on excellent terms with his own physician, M. de
Mauvilain, and that he interceded with the King to get a sinecure for
the doctor’s son (1669). He once explained how it was that he and
Mauvilain got along so well: “We reason with one another; he prescribes
remedies; I omit to take them, and I recover.” 35</p>
<p>Still amid the battle over Tartuffe, Moliere presented, on June 4,
1666, another satire hardly calculated to please either the public or
the court. If action is the soul of drama, Le Misanthrope is rather a
philosophical dia- logue than a play. One sentence can tell the story:
Alceste, who demands a strict morality and complete honesty from himself
and all, loves Celi- mene, who favors him but relishes a multiplicity of
suitors and compli- ments. To Moliere this is but a scaffolding for a
study of morality. Should we always speak the truth, or should we
substitute courtesy for truth in order to get along in the world?
Alceste resents the compromises that so- ciety makes with the truth; he
condemns the hypocrisy of the court, where everyone pretends to the
loftiest sentiments and the “warmest regards,” while at heart each one
is scheming for himself, is critical of all the rest, and uses flattery
as a lever to position or power. Alceste scorns all this, and proposes
to be honest even to the point of suicide. Orontes, a scribbling
courtier, insists on reading his verses to Alceste and asks for sincere
criticism; he gets it, and vows revenge. Celimene flirts; Alceste
reproves her; she calls him a prig; we almost hear Moliere rebuking his
gay wife, and indeed it was he who played Alceste, and she Celimene.</p>
<p>alceste. Madame, will you have me be plain with you? I am very</p>
<p>much dissatisfied with your ways of behavior. … I don’t quarrel</p>
<p>with you, but your disposition, madame, opens to the first comer</p>
<p>too ready an access to vour heart. You have too many lovers whom</p>
<p>we see besieging you; and my soul cannot reconcile itself to
this.</p>
<p>celimene. Do you blame me for attracting lovers? Can I help it if</p>
<p>. people find me lovable? And when they make delectable efforts to
see me should I take a stick and drive them out?</p>
<p>alceste. No. it is not a stick that you must use, but a spirit less
yielding and melting before their vows. I know that your beauty
follows</p>
<p>you everywhere, but your welcome holds further those whom</p>
<p>your eyes attract; and vour sweetness to all who surrender to you</p>
<p>completes in their hearts the work of your charms . 38</p>
<p>The philosophical foil to Alceste is his friend Philinte, who advises
him to adjust himself amiably to the natural defects of mankind, and to
recog- nize politeness as the lubrication of life. The zest of the play
lies in Moli&amp;re’s</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>division of his sentiments between Alceste and Philinte. Alceste is
Moliere the husband who fears that he is a cuckold, and the valet
tapissier du roi who, to make the King’s bed, has to run the gantlet of
a hu ndred nobles as proud of their pedigree as he of his genius.
Philinte is Moliere the philosopher, bidding himself be reasonable and
lenient in judging human- ity. Says Philinte-Moliere to Moliere-Alceste,
in a passage which we may take as a sample of Moliere the poet:</p>
<p>Mon Dieu , des moeurs du temps mettons-nous moins en peine,</p>
<p>Et faisons un peu grace a la nature humaine;</p>
<p>Ne Vexaminons point dans la grande rigueur,</p>
<p>Et voyons ses defauts avec quetque douceur .</p>

<p>A force de sagesse on peut etre bldmable;</p>

<p>Cette grande raideur des vertus des vieux dges</p>
<p>Heurte trop notre siecle et les communs usages ;</p>
<p>Elle veut aux mortels trop de perfection :</p>

<p>Et je crois qiCd la cour, de meme qiCa la ville ,</p>
<p>Mon flegme est philosophe autant que votre bile** 1</p>
<p>Napoleon thought that Philinte had the better of the argument; Jean
Jacques Rousseau thought Philint e a liar, and approved Alceste’s
rigorous morality . 38 In the end Alceste, like Jean Jacques, renounces
the world and retires to a sterilized solitude.</p>

<p>MOLIERE</p>

<p>The play had only a moderate success. The courtiers did not relish
the satire of their fine manners, and the pit could hardly enthuse over
an Al- ceste who frankly despised everybody but himself. The critics,
however, being neither of the pit nor of the court, applauded the play
as a brave attempt to write a drama of ideas; and later pundits judge it
the most per- fect of Moliere’s works. In the course of time, when its
pilloried generation</p>
<p>Unable to live in peace with a young wife to whom monogamy and</p>
<p>beauty seemed a contradiction in terms, Moliere left her (August,
1667), and went to live with his friend Chapelain at Auteuil, in the
western end of Paris. Chapelain gently derided him for taking love so
seriously; but Moliere was more poet than philosopher, and (if we may
believe one poet reporting another) confessed:</p>
<p>“I have determined to live wi th her as if she were not my wife;
but</p>
<p>if you knew what I suffer you would pity me. My passion has reached
such a point that it even enters with compassion into all her interests.
When I consider how impossible it is for me to conquer what I feel</p>
<p>for her, I tell myself that she may have the same difficulty in
con-</p>
<p>quering her inclination to be coquettish, and I find myself more dis-
posed to pity her than to blame her. You will tell me, no doubt,</p>
<p>that a man must be a poet to feel this; but for my part I feel
that</p>
<p>there is but one kind of love, and that those who have not felt these
delicacies of sentiment have never truly loved. All things in the world
are connected with her in my heart . . . When I see her, an emotion,
transports that may be felt but not described, take from me all</p>
<p>power of reflection; I have no longer any eyes for her defects; I</p>
<p>can see only all that she has that is lovable. Is not that the last
degree of madness ?” 39</p>
<p>He tried to forget her by losing himself in his work. In 1667 he
busied himself arranging entertainment for the King at St.-Germain. His
comedy Amphitryon (January 13, 1668) celebrated again the amours of
Jupiter, who seduces Amphitryon’s wife Alcmene. When Jupiter explains to
her that</p>
<p>Un partage avec Jupiter</p>
<p>N’a rien du tout qui desloonore</p>
<p>— i.e., for a lady to share her bed with Jove is not at all
dishonorable — the lines were interpreted by many auditors as condoning
the royal liaison with Mme. de Montespan; if so, it was a very generous
sycophancy, for</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>THE AGE OP LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Moliere was in no mood to sympathize with seducers. Like everybody
else he buttered the King with flattery, as at the end of Tarmffe. In
another comedy, produced before the court on July 15, George Dandin, oil
le Mari confondu, we have again the story of the husband confounded,
suspecting his wife of adultery, unable to prove it, and eating his
heart out with sus- picion and jealousy; Moliere was pouring salt into
his wounds.</p>
<p>It was a busy year, for only a few months later (September 9) he pro-
duced one of his most famous plays. VAvare ( The Miser) took its theme,
and part of its plot, from Plautus’ Aulularia -, but Plautus had taken
that from the New Comedy of the Greeks; the miser, and satire of him,
are probably as old as money. No one has ever handled the subject with
more vivacity and power than Moliere. Harpagon so loves his hoard that
he lets his horses starve and go without hoofs; he has such an aversion
to giving that he does not “give you good day,” but prete le bonjour —
“lends you good day.” Seeing two candles lit for dinner, he blows one
out. He refuses a dowry to his daughter, and trusts that his children
will predecease him. 40 The satire, as usual in Moliere, verges on
caricature. The audience found the picture distasteful, and after eight
performances the play was with- drawn. But Boileau’s praise helped to
revive it; it was shown forty-seven times in its first four years, and
is second only to Tartuffe in frequency of presentation.</p>
<p>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme had less merit and more success. In Decem-
ber, 1669, a Turkish ambassador came to France. The court put on all its
splendor to impress him; he responded with haughty stolidity; after his
departure Louis invited Moliere and Lully to compose a comedy-ballet in
which the ambassador would be parodied in a turquerie. Moliere enlarged
the scheme into a satire on the increasing number of middle-class
French- men who were struggling to dress and speak like born
aristocrats. The comedy had its premiere before King and court at
Chambord, October 14,</p>
<ol start="1670" type="1">
<li>When presented at the Palais-Royal in November it atoned finan-
cially for the losses of VAvare. Moliere played M. Jourdain; Lully
played the Mufti. To invest himself with nobility, M. Jourdain hires a
music</li>
</ol>
<p>master, a dancing master, a fencing master, a philosophy master. They
come to blows over the relative importance of their arts — whether it is
more vital to achieve harmony, to be in step, to be able to kill neatly,
or to speak elegant French. In the claims of the music master we suspect
a sly dig at pompous, climbing Lully. Half the world knows the scene in
which M. Jourdain learns that all language is either prose or verse.</p>

</ol>
<p>prose without knowing anything about it. I am for all the world</p>
<p>most obliged to you for informing me of this. 41</p>
<p>Some courtiers, who had not long since graduated from commerce into
lace, felt that the satire was aimed at them, and they pooh-poohed the
play as nonsense; but the King assured Moliere, “You have never written
any - thing yet which has amused me so much.” Hearing this, says Guizot,
“the court was at once seized with a fit of admiration.” 42</p>
<p>Moli&amp;re and Lully collaborated again to produce before the court
(Jan- uary, 1671), a tragedy-ballet, Psyche, to which Pierre Corneille
and Quin- ault contributed most of the verse. Lully was winning the
battle against Moliere: comedy was giving way to opera, dialogue to
machinery; gods and goddesses had to be lowered from heaven or hoisted
from hell. The stage at the Palais-Royal had to be rebuilt for Psyche ,
at a cost of 1,989 livres. But the production was a financial
success.</p>
<p>Romance, however, was not Moliere’s forte; he was more at home when
roasting the absurdities of the age on the point of his wit. It seemed
to him that a learned woman was an uncomfortable anomaly and an
impediment to marriage. He had heard such women pruning vocabularies,
debating niceties of grammar, quoting the classics, and talking
philosophy; this, to Moliere’s ears, sounded like a sexual perversion.
Moreover two men, the Abbe Cotin and the poe t Menage, had been
inveighing against Moliere’s plays; here was a chance to prick them. So,
on March 11, 1672, he offered Les Femmes savantes. Philaminte discharges
a maid for using a word con- demned by the Academy; her daughter Armande
rejects matrimony as a disgusting contact of bodies rather than a fusion
of minds; Trissotin reads his awful poetry to these admiring prudes;
Vadius riddles the poetry and presents more of his own and the same.
Against all these Moliere defends Henriette, who abominates alexandrines
and wants a husband who can give her children instead of epigrams. Had
Armande Bejart become a precieuse ? Or was Moliere showing his age?</p>

<p>He was only fifty, but his hectic life, his tuberculosis, his
marriage, and his bereavements had drained his vitality. The portrait by
Mignard caught him at his prime: large nose, sensual lips, and comically
elevatable eye- brows, but already a wrinkled forehead and wistful eyes.

day, dealing with high-strung prima donnas, a lively wife, and a
sensitive King, seeing two of</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>his three children die — this was no primrose path to optimism, but
an open road to bad digestion and early death. Understandably he became
“a self - devouring volcano,” 48 melancholy, sharp -tempered, frankly
critical but sympathetically generous. His troupe understood him and was
devoted to him, knowing that he used himself up to give it sustenance
and success. His friends were always ready to do battle for him — above
all, Boileau and La Fontaine, who, sometimes with Racine, made with
Moliere les Quatre Amis, the famous “Four Friends.” They found him -
well educated and informed, witty but seldom merry, a Grimaldi on the
stage, but in private sadder than Shakespeare’s Jaques.</p>
<p>After four and a half years of separation he returned to his wife
(1671). The child that resulted from this reconciliation died after a
month of life. At Auteuil he had lived on a milk diet prescribed by his
doctor; now he resumed his usual consumption of wine, and attended late
suppers to please Armande. Despite his increasing cough he decided to
play the leading role, Argan, in his final play, Le Malade imaginaire
(February 10, 1673).</p>
<p>Argan imagines himself afflicted with a dozen diseases, and spends
half his fortune on doctors and drugs. His brother Beralde derides
him:</p>
<p>argan. What must we do, then, when we are sick?</p>
<p>beralde. Nothing, brother. . . . We must only keep ourselves
quiet.</p>
<p>Nature herself, when we let her alone, will gently deliver
herself</p>
<p>from the disorder she’s fallen into. ’Tis our ingratitude, ’tis
our</p>
<p>impatience, that spoils all; and almost all men die of their
medi-</p>
<p>cines, not of their diseases . 44</p>
<p>To further ridicule the profession, Argan is told that he himself can
be- come a doctor in short order, and can easily pass the examination
for a medical license. There follows the famous mock examination:</p>
<p>first doctor. Demandabo causam and rationem quare opium facit</p>

<p>chorus. Bene, bene, bene respondere,</p>
<p>Dignus, dignus est intrare</p>
<p>In nostro docto corpore.</p>
<p>Moliere’s death was almost a part of this play. On February 17, 1673,
Armande and others, perceiving his fatigue, begged him to close the
theater for a few days while he regained strength. But “How can I do
that?” he asked. “There are fifty poor workmen here who are paid by the
day; what</p>
<p>Harlay de Champvallon, Archbishop of Paris, ruled that since
Moli&amp;re had not made his final penitence and received absolution, he
could not be buried in Christian ground. Armande, who had always loved
him even while deceiving him, went to Versailles, threw herself at the
feet of the King, and said, not wisely but boldly and truly, “If my
husband was a</p>
<p>criminal, his crimes were sanctioned by your Majesty in person.” 46
Louis sent some secret word to the Archbishop. Harlay compromised: the
body must not be taken into a church for Christian rites, but it was
allowed a quiet burial, after sunset, in a remote corner of the Cemetery
of St.-Joseph in the Rue Montmartre.</p>
<p>Moliere remains by common consent one of the greatest figures in the
literature of France. Not by perfection of dramatic technique, nor by
any splendor of poetry. Almost all his plots are borrowed, almost all
their de- nouements are artificial and absurd; almost all his characters
are personified qualities, several, like Harpagon, are exaggerated to
the point of caricature; and too often his comedies fall into farce. We
are told that the court, as well as the general public, liked him best
when he was most farcical, and did not relish his mordant satires on
failings widely shared. Probably he would have omitted the farce if he
had not felt compelled to keep his company solvent.</p>
<p>Like Shakespeare mourning that he must make himself a motley to the
view, he wrote: “I think it a very grievous punishment, in the liberal
arts, to display oneself to fools, and to expose our compositions to the
barbarous judgment of the stupid.” 47 It irked him to be always required
to make people laugh; this, he has one of his characters say, “is a
queer enterprise.” 48</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>He aspired to write tragedies, and, though he fell short of his aim,
he managed to give to his greatest comedies a tragic significance and
depth.</p>
<p>So it is the philosophy in his plays, as well as their humor and
pungent satire, that makes almost every literate Frenchman read Moliere
. 49 It was essentially a rationalistic philosophy, which gladdened the
hearts of the eighteenth- century philosophes. “There is in Moliere not
a trace of super - natural Christianity,” and “the religion expounded by
his mouthpiece Cleante” in Tartuffe “might be endorsed by Voltaire .” 50
He never attacked</p>
<p>His moral philosophy was pagan in the sense that it legitimized
pleasure, and had no sense of sin. It savored of Epicurus and Seneca
rather than of St. Paul or Augustine; harmonized better with the laxity
of the King than with the austerities of Port-Royal. He deprecated
excess even in virtue. He admired I’honnete hovmte, the sensible man of
the world who threaded his way with sane moderation among competing
absurdities, and adjusted himself without fuss to the shortcomings of
mankind.</p>
<p>Moliere himself did not reach that plane of moderation. His
profession as a comic dramatist compelled him to satire, and often to
hyperbole; he was too hard on learned women, too indiscriminate in
attacking physicians; and he might have shown more respect for enemas.
But overemphasis is in the blood of satire, and dramas seldom make their
point without it. Moliere would have been greater if he could have found
a way to satirize the fundamental evil of the reign — the military greed
and ruinous despotism of Louis XIV ; but it was this gracious autocrat
who protected him against his enemies and made possible his war against
bigotry. How lucky he was to die before his master had become the most
destructive bigot of them all!</p>
<p>France loves Moliere, and still plays him, as England loves and plays
Shakespeare. We cannot, as some fervent Gauls would do, equate him with
England’s bard; he was only a part of Shakespeare, whose other parts
were</p>
