<p>A Gold Standard with</p>
<p>Double Feedback and Near Zero Reserves</p>
<p>fatodgoee,</p>
<p>I am grateful to Eugene Fama for many useful conversations on these
issues, and to Carl Christ, Paul Krugman, and Jurg Niehans for comments
on an earlier draft of this chapter.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>One hopes, with a gold standard, to set the level of a price index by
setting the price of gold.1</p>
<p>When a government ﬁxes the price of wheat by agreeing to buy
unlimited amounts at a price that is thought to be fair to farmers, the
main goal is not to inﬂuence the prices of other goods and services. In
fact, the relationship goes the other way. When the prices of other
goods and serv- ices rise, the government is apt to raise the price at
which it buys wheat.</p>
<p>When a government ﬁxes the price of oil, and introduces a ration- ing
system to balance supply and demand, the main goal is again not to
inﬂuence the prices of other goods and services. If other prices rise
while the price of oil is not changed, the rationing may have to become
more severe and black markets may grow, but there are no obvious forces
tending to moderate the rate at which these other prices rise.</p>
<p>The gold standard I will discuss uses a different method for set-
ting the commodity price.2 In a sense, it is a combination of the wheat
method and the oil method. The government stands ready to buy or sell
gold freely at a given price,just as the government stands ready to buy
wheat freely at a given price. But the government’s inventory of gold is
ﬁxed by a backing rule, saying that the amount of gold held will be a
given fraction of the money stock. One possible backing rule says that
the government’s stock of gold shall be kept near zero, just as the
government’s stock of oil can be kept at zero in connection with its
method for ﬁxing oil prices.3</p>
<p>If the gold standard with an exact backing rule works, then I claim
it will work when the rule says the government is to hold almost no
reserves at all.</p>
<p>Assumptions</p>
<p>I wish to adopt all the assumptions that Barro (1979) uses.</p>
<p>In his world, gold is supplied from mines at a rate that depends on
its relative price. Gold is demanded by the private sector in an amount
that depends on its current and future relative prices. Gold is used in
both consumer goods and industrial goods, but it is not used in
coins.</p>
<p>A Gold Standard 131</p>
<p>The government holds a stock of gold equal to a ﬁxed fraction λ of
the outstanding stock of money. The government’s gold does not
depreciate, but the private sector’s gold depreciates at a ﬁxed rate δ
.</p>
<p>The government buys and sells gold freely at a ﬁxed price Pg. This
price may change through time.</p>
<p>Income y affects the demand for money, but is determined by fac- tors
outside of the model. There is a fully developed ﬁnancial system,
including currency, banks, stocks, and bonds, in the background.</p>
<p>In addition, Barro assumes implicitly that the government con- ducts
open market operations on the side, to keep its gold stock at the
required ﬁxed fraction λ .</p>
<p>Ofﬁcial buying and selling of gold will keep the reserve ratio λ
unchanged only when λ is one.When it is less than one, ofﬁcial buying
and selling will create the need for further transactions. These
transac- tions can take the form of open market exchanges of bonds and
reserves. When the government buys a dollar’s worth of gold, it must buy
l/λ - l dollars’ worth of bonds on the open market to keep the reserve
ratio at λ .When it sells gold, it must sell bonds.</p>
<p>When λ is near zero, the government buys and sells almost no gold.
Shocks are met almost entirely through open market operations.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>In Barro’s world, there is always an equilibrium for all variables,
including the price level P, for which the price of gold is constant at
Pg . (Assuming that the functions he writes down are well- behaved.)
Thus a government can never be forced to abandon the gold standard by
the factors in Barro’s model. If there is such a thing as a “speculative
attack,” it must come from forces outside of Barro’s model.4</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a unique equilibrium path for all variables,
including the price level P and the money stock. There is no scope for
monetary policy within a ﬁxed reserve ratio gold standard.There is only
one equilibrium path for the money stock for any given reserve ratio λ .
The government must engage in ordinary open market operations that
provide this path for the money stock.</p>
<p>Barro (1979, p. 22) notes that the resource cost of the reserves held
by the government is an increasing function of λ .This implies that the
optimal value of λ is near zero. If the gold standard as Barro describes
it will work for any value of λ less than one, it will work for a λ near
zero.The government needs only small working inventories of gold.</p>
<p>The process seems especially odd when λ is near zero. In that case,
the government meets a decrease in the demand for money, not by sell-
ing gold for currency or reserves, but by selling bonds for currency or
reserves. If there is an increase in demand for gold, the government
will ﬁnd itself contracting the money supply. This will be associated
with a decline in the price level if the price of gold is constant. The
govern- ment’s gold stock will fall only slightly and temporarily.</p>
<p>With λ equal to zero, the gold window is effectively turned into a
bond window.</p>
<p>If this argument is correct, then a government can also maintain ﬁxed
exchange rates with other governments while maintaining nearly zero
reserves. Speculative attacks, if they can succeed at all, must succeed
for reasons outside of Barro’s model. Within Barro’s model, a govern-
ment can maintain ﬁxed exchange rates indeﬁnitely.</p>
<p>Of course, if every government maintains zero reserves of gold and
other currencies, there will be no reserve ﬂows between governments in
any sense. This will be true even though each country is perma- nently
on a gold standard, and even though exchange rates are perma- nently
ﬁxed.5</p>
<p>Feedback</p>
<p>Open market operations on the side can be governed by a feedback
rule. When the government starts to experience an outﬂow of gold, it can
sell bonds for currency or reserves in large enough amounts to reverse
the outﬂow. I see no reason why this response cannot be
instantaneous.</p>
<p>The reason for using a gold standard is to stabilize the price
level.</p>
<p>Since the real price of gold is not constant, the government can use
a feedback rule to set the price of gold so that the level of an index
of prices of other goods and services will be constant.6 When the price
level</p>
<p>starts to rise, the price of gold is dropped; and when the price
level starts to fall, the price of gold is raised. The only delays in
this process should be due to the time it takes to measure the level of
the price index.</p>
<p>Thus one feedback rule operates from the government’s gold stock to
open market operations, while another operates from the level of a price
index to the price of gold.With both feedback rules in operation, it
appears that the indirect costs of operating a gold standard would be
minimized. Since there would not be any signiﬁcant moves in the price
level, the fact that the money stock might move around a lot would be of
no importance.</p>
<p>This kind of gold standard would minimize the direct costs associated
with holding a signiﬁcant inventory of gold, and the indirect costs
asso- ciated with variations in the price level. The economic costs
would be minimal.</p>
<p>If we count as a cost the inability of the government to use expan-
sionary monetary policy, then we can add the price level itself as a
policy variable. Under this kind of gold standard, the government can
choose any rate of inﬂation or deﬂation it wants.</p>
<p>It seems that this kind of gold standard is the one that should be
studied by any country thinking of adopting a gold standard.</p>
<p>We don’t have to choose between adopting a gold standard and selling
the gold stock.We can adopt a gold standard and sell most of the gold
stock.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fisher (1920) discusses the use of the gold standard to stabilize
the price level.</li>
</ol>
<p>Friedman (1951) has a thorough analysis of the economics of several
varia- tions on the gold standard, emphasizing countercyclical effects
and controls on capricious government policy. Samuelson (1971) looks at
a model of the gold standard in which gold itself is used as money.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>I will work with a model developed by Barro (1979).</p></li>
<li><p>Hall (1981) discusses another way to ﬁx the price of a commodity
without using government inventories of the commodity. The government
passes a law that (a) allows buyers to insist on using the commodity at
a given price to pay for other goods and services, and (b) allows
sellers to insist that buyers use the commodity at the given price to
pay for the sellers ’ goods and services.</p></li>
<li><p>Salant and Henderson (1978) have a model in which speculative
attacks</p></li>
</ol>
<p>can be effective. Their model appears to apply more to wheat than to
gold.</p>
<p>They assume there are no transactions on the side. Similarly,
Krugman</p>
<ol start="1979" type="1">
<li>has a model in which speculative attacks on ﬁxed exchange rates
can</li>
</ol>
<p>succeed. He assumes that there are no assets other than currency, so
again</p>
<p>there can be no transactions on the side. Rather than modelling
forces out-</p>
<p>side of Barro’s world, they seem to obtain their results by assuming
that the</p>
<p>intervention has no apparent economic purpose. Fixing the price of
gold</p>
<p>without transactions on the side will not ﬁx the level of an index of
prices</p>
<p>of other goods and services. Their models may be realistic in the
sense that</p>
<p>countries may sometimes intervene for no apparent economic
reason.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>In such a world, the monetary approach to the balance of
payments, as described by Whitman (1975) and in Frenkel and Johnson
(1976), would seem to lose its meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Fisher (1920) proposes such a feedback rule.</p></li>
