<p>Fischer Black (1938–1995) is best known for his fundamental con-
tributions to ﬁnance, most famously the Black-Scholes option pricing
formula that bears his name. He also aspired to contrib- ute to
macroeconomics. Indeed, he viewed his contributions to macro- economics
as more important than his contributions to ﬁnance, because they were
potentially more consequential for general social welfare.This book
records the development of his thinking in that ﬁeld from 1968, when he
wrote the ﬁrst draft of the paper that he includes as the ﬁrst
chapter,to 1986,when he revised his presidential address to the American
Finance Association to produce the paper that he includes as the last
chapter. In between, the papers are organized chronologically, rather
than thematically, more or less in the order in which Black brought them
to fruition (see the Appendix at the end of the Foreword). He added some
few notes, but otherwise there were no retrospective addi- tions or
omissions.</p>
<p>In Black’s own professional life, the temporal span of this book took
him from his ﬁrst job at the management consultancy ﬁrm Arthur</p>
<p>D. Little, Inc., to what would be his last job at the investment
banking ﬁrm Goldman, Sachs andandandand Co. In between, he spent 13
years in academia,</p>
<p>vi foreword</p>
<p>ﬁrst at the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business
(1971–1975), then at MIT’s Sloan School of Management (1975–1984). This
professional trajectory suggests that we can read the present book as
the record of a nonacademic outsider’s attempt to insert a new idea into
the insiders’ debate then raging between the Keynesians (at MIT) and the
monetarists (at Chicago).</p>
<p>The outsider’s idea is present in the very ﬁrst chapter. Fischer
Black invites us to imagine a world without money and to think about how
such a world might work, then holds up that picture against both the
existing ﬁnancial system and against existing economic theories about
how that system works. For Black, this comparison suggests that there
are powerful forces at work tending to move us away from the existing
system in the direction of a world without money. That tendency, once we
recognize it, can be expected to produce a similar tendency in the world
of ideas, a tendency to move beyond our existing understanding— based on
the quantity theory of money (embraced by monetarists) and its revision
into the liquidity preference theory of money (embraced by
Keynesians)—in the direction of something new.</p>
<p>In this ﬁrst chapter, Black’s methodological focus is not yet on
equilibrium, not even ﬁnancial market equilibrium. We can see the
inﬂuence ofTreynor’s capital asset pricing model (CAPM) in the argu-
ment that “a principal reason for introducing borrowing and lend- ing is
for the transfer of risk” (p. 12), but the price of risk plays no role
and the focus is instead on the rate of interest. Even more, Black’s
world without money is largely a world of banking institutions, not of
ﬁnancial markets. He imagines a world in which essentially all ﬁxed-
income securities, government and corporate bonds alike, are replaced by
bank lending and funded by bank deposits of one kind or another. It is
recognizably the CAPM world of equity and short-term debt, but the debt
part involves “indirect ﬁnance” not “direct ﬁnance” (to use the
phraseology of Gurley and Shaw in their 1960 Money in a Theory of
Finance).</p>
<p>Black says that “equilibrium was the concept that attracted me to
ﬁnance and economics” (p. xxi). In the ﬁrst chapter, we can see what he
means. Conceptualizing banks as ﬁnancial intermediaries that hold loans
to business and government as assets, and deposits from house- holds as
liabilities, Black was led naturally to conceptualize the larger</p>
<p>economy as a set of interlocking balance sheets. One person’s asset
is another person’s liability. Balance-sheet thinking of this sort is a
kind of natural general equilibrium (or macroeconomic) thinking. Add to
this thinking the simple idea of proﬁt-seeking and competition between
intermediaries, and you have the abstract equilibrium concept with which
Fischer Black started his intellectual journey. For him, equilib- rium
is not at all a position of rest, much less the endpoint of a process of
dynamic adjustment. It is, as he says, only a position in which “there
are no opportunities to make abnormal proﬁts.”</p>
<p>One consequence of his balance-sheet starting point was an instinc-
tual antipathy for the quantity theory of money, in both its domestic
and international incarnations (Milton Friedman and Harry Johnson,
respectively). “Those who believe in the quantity theory are forced to
argue in terms ofa world with commodity money or a world where the
government hands out massive amounts of currency or bonds, and then
transfer their conclusions to an entirely different kind of world”
(p. 20). Currency, in Black’s world, is not paper gold (outside money),
but rather a bank deposit (inside money), not the exogenous imposition
of government policy, but rather the endogenous outcome of private proﬁt
maximization. As such, the law of reﬂux applies—the supply of money
adjusts to the demand for money. “When a bank creates a deposit larger
than the individual wants to hold, he can always use it to pay off some
of his loan” (p. 16).“Ifa bank issues money to make a loan to one
person, and that money is more than the public wants to hold at
equilibrium interest rates, then it will simply be used to pay off
another loan, at the same bank or at another bank” (p. 38). In this way,
any incipient excess supply of money has no chance to affect the price
level (or the rate of interest), since it is immediately cancelled.</p>
<p>Because of his antipathy toward the quantity theory, Black rec-
ognized that monetarists would resist his ideas, but he seems to have
thought that Keynesians would be more sympathetic.Thus, we see him
positioning his ideas in explicit opposition to Friedman and Johnson,
but as an extension of the work of Keynesian economists such as Vickrey,
Tobin, Gurley and Shaw, and Patinkin (pp. 2–4). Indeed, it was to the
Keynesians that he ﬁrst offered these ideas, on March 12, 1970, in
Franco Modigliani’s Monetary Theory Seminar at MIT. His ﬁrst formal
academic presentation was a success, but Modigliani was not
convinced.</p>
<p>viii</p>
<p>As leader of the research team that had recently produced the mon-
etary sector of the Federal Reserve’s econometric model of the United
States, Franco Modigliani was a central ﬁgure of Keynesian monetary
economics. By contrast to Milton Friedman, he urged an activist coun-
tercyclical monetary policy, but his opposition to Friedman’s monetar-
ism did not extend to the quantity theory of money more generally.
Rather, following in the footsteps of the so-called American Keynes,
Irving Fisher, Modigliani accepted the quantity theory of money as a
theory of the long run, and understood short-run business ﬂuctuations as
disequilibrium deviations from the long-run equilibrium path.</p>
<p>From this perspective, we can understand Black’s second chapter as an
attempt to engage economists like Modigliani on their own turf. Instead
of trying to tempt the reader with his own vision of a world without
money, in this second paper he is trying to demonstrate that the
reader’s own vision of a world with money simply does not make logi- cal
sense. He does this by taking the Solow growth model as a widely
accepted model of long-run equilibrium, and then showing how attempts to
bring money into the picture as an active force control- led by
policymakers lead inevitably to logical contradiction. (Chapter 4 plays
a similar game with a paper of Sargent and Wallace.) The only way these
models make sense, he argues, is if policymakers passively supply
whatever quantity of money is demanded by households (thus reproducing
in the public money supply exactly the behavior that Black expects from
private banks in his world without money). Apparently, Black viewed this
second paper as foundational for everything else in his subsequent
engagement with the academic economists, as evidenced by his frequent
references to it (p. 60, 61, 79, 151, 165, 187).Why?</p>
<p>As a student of the mathematical logician W. V. O. Quine, Black
considered the demonstration of logical error to be sufﬁcient for
rejection of a theory. This Quine inﬂuence is also likely the source of
Black’s otherwise puzzling argument that “the quantity of money can have
no effect on output, employment, or prices, because the quantity of
money does not exist” (p. 10). See also his puzzling idea that logi- cal
contradiction qualiﬁes as “evidence that a government cannot con- trol
its country’s money stock” (p. 60). “A plausible theory is one that does
not imply consistent, easy to exploit proﬁt opportunities” (p. 142).
Equilibrium modeling is, for Black, fundamentally a test of the
logical</p>
<p>ix</p>
<p>consistency of the posited axioms. Inconsistency means that some
axiom must be replaced; Black’s suggestion is to replace the axiom of
active monetary policy with the axiom of passive monetary policy.</p>
<p>The Keynesians, not being followers of Quine, were no more con-
vinced by the second paper than they were by the ﬁrst. They under- stood
quite well that their theories were disequilibrium theories, in the
sense that they were theories of an economy away from full equilib-
rium, although possibly adjusting slowly in the direction of
equilibrium. Indeed, their whole rationale for government policy
intervention was to help the economy to move more quickly toward
equilibrium. Whatever “consistent, easy to exploit proﬁt opportunities”
might seem to exist in the theories, the observable fact of business
ﬂuctuations must mean that people do not in fact exploit them, which
means that there is a role for government policy. The whole purpose of
economic the- ory, and of the elaborate econometric modeling built on
top of that theory, is to provide a scientiﬁc guide for policy
intervention.</p>
<p>The economists’ point of view is not obviously nonsensical.</p>
<p>One historical origin of this view is Irving Fisher, who saw business
ﬂuctuations as deviations from equilibrium caused typically by mon-
etary disturbances, the “dance of the dollar” (Fisher 1923). Arguing in
quantity theory terms, Irving Fisher urged government control of the
money supply as a way of controlling business ﬂuctuations. Modern
Keynesians (such as Modigliani) understood themselves as merely going
one better than Irving Fisher, by using control of government spending
as an additional policy instrument, and one possibly better suited for
addressing ﬂuctuations that are not monetary in origin. Modern mone-
tarists (such as Friedman) disagreed with Keynesians not about the dis-
equilibrium character of ﬂuctuations, but rather only about the efﬁcacy
of activist countercyclical policy (both monetary and ﬁscal) as a
remedy. The debate between the monetarists and the Keynesians was, from
this point of view, an intramural debate following agreed ground
rules.</p>
<p>Black disagreed with the economists’ ground rules, but nonethe- less
he tried hard to follow them in order to enter the debate, at least at
ﬁrst. Economists seemed all to agree that, in the long run, the economy
could be described as being in equilibrium. Taking advantage of this,
Black thought he might be able to bracket the whole fraught issue of
disequilibrium by presenting his monetary theory as a theory of the</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>long run, and by demonstrating how the quantity theory of money made
no sense even in that context. That is what he is trying to do in
Chapter 2 (as well as Chapters 4 and 9).1 For this project, however, he
found himself almost entirely alone, since essentially all economists,
Keynesians and monetarists alike, were monetarists when it came to the
long run. Black says, “There’s only one other person I know of who takes
a position almost as strong as mine” (p. 99).2</p>
<p>Black did not mind being alone. Notably, his business-cycle theory
says that economic ﬂuctuations are caused when large numbers of peo- ple
make the same error because they base their reasoning on the same
erroneous information.“If that information is wrong, it will be wrong in
the same direction for everyone. (Except that a few people may have
ignored the information or may have assumed that it was wrong.)”
(p. 89). Black thought of himself as one of those few people. The dis-
mal economic performance of the 1970s, performance that inspired the
neologism stagﬂation to describe the combination of economic stagnation
with simultaneous inﬂation, was the material consequence of correlated
error. In the world of ideas, the consequence was crisis in economic
orthodoxy.The New Classical and then Real Business Cycle project to
reconstruct macroeconomics on an equilibrium basis was very much in line
with Black’s own predilections. Having resolved the matter of monetary
theory to his own satisfaction, even if no one else’s, he moved on to
the more important matter of building a nonmonetary equilibrium theory
of business ﬂuctuation.</p>
<p>Black’s Business Cycle Theory</p>
<p>In the present book, the development of Black’s business-cycle theory
can be followed in Chapters 6, 10, and 13. However, the underlying idea,
that business cycles might be understood as an equilibrium, emerges much
earlier in Black’s own thinking. More or less from the beginning, he
seems to have had the idea to extend Treynor’s CAPM by conceiv- ing of
the assets in the model not as ﬁnancial assets but as real assets, which
moreover arise endogenously because someone chooses to make a real
investment. Black’s ﬁrst sketch of a general equilibrium CAPM, published
in 1972 as “Equilibrium in the Creation of Investment Goods</p>
<p>xi</p>
<p>Under Uncertainty,”was essentially complete already in September 1969
as Financial Note No. 8. There is a continuous thread that runs from
this initial paper to “The ABCs of Business Cycles” (Chapter 10) and
“General Equilibrium and Business Cycles” (Chapter 13), and indeed even
beyond to his ﬁnal book Exploring General Equilibrium (1995).</p>
<p>The standard ﬁnancial CAPM starts from the idea that there is an
exogenously given supply of various different securities, and proceeds
to work out a theory of market-clearing security prices given the risk
preferences of wealth holders (Treynor 1962, Sharpe 1964, Lintner 1965).
In equilibrium, everyone holds the market portfolio and adjusts risk
exposure by borrowing or lending at the riskfree rate. In equilib- rium,
the expected return on any given risky asset depends on its riski- ness,
which is measured by the covariance of its return with the market as a
whole. More risk means higher expected return, but not necessarily
higher actual return since returns ﬂuctuate around their expected
value.</p>
<p>Fischer Black saw in this simple CAPM the seed of a possible model of
economic growth and ﬂuctuation. Business ﬂuctuation could be thought of
as nothing more than the ﬂuctuating return on our economy’s underlying
real stock of capital. If our capital investments are risky, then we can
expect greater ﬂuctuation, but the reward will be a higher expected
return (and higher economic growth to the extent that the higher return
is reinvested). If we don’t like the ﬂuctuations, the solution is not
government intervention using monetary and ﬁscal policy, but rather a
downward adjustment of the risk (and the associ- ated expected return)
embodied in our capital stock.</p>
<p>The CAPM analogy doesn’t work all that well—it requires that we have
instantaneous production and a single consumption good—but at least it
is an equilibrium model, so we can safely start there and work on
building in more reality.That is what Black is doing in the business-
cycle chapters in this book. Ultimately, his business-cycle theory
relies centrally on the presence of a large number of economic sectors,
each producing a distinct good using specialized inputs that must be put
in place some time before the good itself is produced.This time-lag
feature of production forces everyone to forecast the future state of
demand in detail, and errors are inevitable because the world is
changing. When errors are few, we have a boom; when errors are many and
correlated, we have a recession. Recessions are thus a matter of
mismatch between</p>
<p>xii</p>
<p>the structure of production and the structure of demand, and the way
out of recession is adjustment of the structure of production.That means
moving people and resources from one sector to another, which takes time
and involves some period of unemployment.</p>
<p>This way of thinking seems to capture many, but not all, of the fea-
tures of the ﬂuctuations we observe.To make the model more realistic,
Black adds successively the idea that some goods are durable, and the
idea that production is a team effort; what he does not add is any mar-
ket failure or monetary disturbance. The general equilibrium model,
properly understood, is consistent with almost everything we see; that
is the central organizing principle of Black’s entire opus.</p>
<p>In this respect, one way of understanding Black’s work is as an
attempt to extend the work of Irving Fisher to the case of uncertainty.
Like Irving Fisher in his 1907 The Rate of Interest, Black built his
ﬁrst general equilibrium model as the simultaneous solution to the
house- hold’s problem of “Individual Investment and Consumption under
Uncertainty” (Black 1969), and the ﬁrm’s problem of “Corporate
Investment Decisions” (Treynor and Black 1967). Also like Irving Fisher,
Fischer Black went on to build a theory of money and business cycles on
these general equilibrium foundations.</p>
<p>Even more, Black seems to have taken his underlying vision of the
economy from Fisher. In Fisher’s treatise on accounting, The Nature of
Capital and Income (1906), he presents a picture of the economy as a
stock of wealth moving through time, throwing off a ﬂow of services as
its goes. In his formulation all wealth is capital, not just machines
and buildings, but also land and even human beings. Indeed, for Fisher,
human beings are the most important form of capital because the most
versatile.Thus, at the highest level of abstraction, there is no
distinction between the traditional categories of labor, capital, and
land. All pro- duce a stream of income (services) so all are capital,
and their income discounted back to the present is their capital value.
Similarly, at the highest level of abstraction, there is no distinction
between the tradi- tional categories of wages, proﬁt, and rent. All are
incomes thrown off by capital, hence all are forms of the more general
category of interest, which is the rate at which income ﬂows from
wealth.</p>
<p>All this is in Black from the very beginning and throughout his
career. The signiﬁcant state variable in all his macroeconomic work
is</p>
<p>xiii</p>
<p>the value of wealth, understood to include both physical and human
capital. Further, human capital is quantitatively the more important (as
Chapter 6), although measurement problems often prevent us from see- ing
this clearly in economic data. As in Fisher, Black’s emphasis is on the
market value of wealth calculated as the expected present value of
future income ﬂows, rather than on the quantity of wealth calculated as
the historical accumulation of saving minus depreciation.This allows
Black to treat knowledge and technology as forms of capital, since their
expected effects are included when we measure capital at market
value.</p>
<p>Fischer Black extended Irving Fisher to the case of uncertainty, but
in so doing he arrived at some rather different conclusions. It was on
precisely those points of divergence that he met resistance, since most
economists remained attached to Irving Fisher’s original conclusions.
First, money. In his 1911 The Purchasing Power of Money, Irving Fisher
revived the quantity theory of money, in part to provide the theory of
the price level that was missing from his version of general
equilibrium. Economics followed this lead, but Fischer Black did not, on
the grounds that the quantity theory was inconsistent with equilibrium
as he understood it.</p>
<p>Second, business cycles. Irving Fisher analyzed business cycles as
disequilibrium phenomena caused by monetary instability (1911, Chapter
4). In his theory, nominal interest rates adjust only slowly to changes
in the rate of inﬂation and the resulting changes in the real rate of
interest cause real disequilibrium ﬂuctuations. Monetary stabili- zation
that brings price level stabilization can therefore help to stabilize
business cycles. Again, economics followed this lead, but Fischer Black
did not. By adding in uncertainty, he could explain ﬂuctuations in
economic activity using the same equilibrium approach that ﬁnancial
economists were already using to explain ﬂuctuations in asset
prices.</p>
<p>This departure from the crowd meant that Black’s work was mostly not
publishable in academic journals at the time it was written. Only
Chapters 2 and 4 managed to ﬁnd their way in; all the rest were pub-
lishable only in practitioner’s journals, or by private circulation.
Even, or perhaps especially, Chapter 13, “General Equilibrium and
Business Cycles,” in which Black puts forth his business cycle theory,
was rejected outright by the American Economic Review, and so found its
ﬁrst public audience only in the present book. And, truth told, the
present book itself was probably publishable only because of Black’s
standing as</p>
<p>xiv</p>
<p>president of the American Finance Association. Such is the fate of
out- siders, no matter how long they spend inside.</p>
<p>Probably, Black himself had high hopes for the book. Although his
business-cycle theory had been unpublishable in 1982, the pub- lication
of papers by Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Long and Plosser (1983)
showed that at least some academic journals were will- ing to entertain
the idea of a nonmonetary equilibrium business- cycle theory. (Both
papers are cited in Chapter 13 as unpublished memoranda.) Black thus had
good reason to think that his own work might be appreciated as a
forerunner of the Real Business Cycle approach,3 maybe even as an
indication of where that literature would eventually have to go. Black’s
care to express his ideas in regular lan- guage, rather than formal
mathematical models, might also have won for him a larger audience than
the papers that found more favor with the academic journals.</p>
<p>It didn’t happen. The Real Business Cycle approach did ﬂourish, but
in directions that Black found ultimately disappointing—too much
mathematical and statistical technique for their own sake, and not
enough engagement with the important facts in the material world.
Nevertheless, he did not give up, and his second book Exploring General
Equilibrium (1995) is an attempt to engage with the burgeoning aca-
demic literature. Readers will want to consult that book in order to ﬁnd
out what happened next.</p>
<p>The Crash,Then and Now</p>
<p>One test of a theory is whether it helps to explain what is happening
in the world around us. From this point of view, which is very much
Black’s own point of view, the original publication date of this book
was singularly inauspicious. On October 19, 1987, the U.S. stock market
experienced its largest ever percentage loss. This would have been the
news ringing in people’s heads as they considered whether to engage with
a book titled Business Cycles and Equilibrium. For any- one whose
conception of equilibrium involved stability, the apparent volatility of
the market appeared as prima facie evidence against any equilibrium
theory. For Black himself, however, the 1987 crash was</p>
<p>xv</p>
<p>merely a recalcitrant data point that challenged him to think hard,
and so he did in “An Equilibrium Model of the Crash” (1988).</p>
<p>Black’s story about the 1987 crash was that taste for risk increased
as the stock market rose—in part because of portfolio insurance?—but
investors did not fully appreciate the consequences of that taste
change, so their beliefs about the world came to embody more and more
error as prices rose higher and higher.The crash came when investors
realized their error and corrected their beliefs, thus correcting also
the price over- shoot. Technical and psychological factors—Black says
“We might call this element ‘liquidity’”—came into play also as the
crash itself produced trading bottlenecks and fear that drove prices
even lower, temporarily.</p>
<p>Black’s conception of equilibrium in 1988 was apparently much more
capacious than it was in 1968, when he started out. Perhaps the most
startling addition to his intellectual arsenal is the willingness to
consider “liquidity” as an independent cause of price.This addition was
long in coming, but Chapter 14, “Noise,” clearly demonstrates that it
was in his mind well before the crash. In that chapter, the concept of
liquidity is fundamentally microeconomic, and arises from the need to
introduce “noise traders” to explain why there is any trade at all. “The
whole structure of ﬁnancial markets depends on relatively liquid markets
in the shares of individual ﬁrms” (p. 172). In his analysis of the 1987
crash, however, he extended the concept to the market as a whole. Still
he resisted what for many economists would be the next logical step,
namely to argue that there is a role for central bank inter- vention to
ensure market liquidity so that markets do not overshoot on the way
down. “This led to a decline in the equilibrium level of the market that
was greater than the decline a model would have ﬁgured— unless it
accounted for the psychological factor” (1988, p. 274).</p>
<p>What about the crisis that is under way at this very moment? Clearly,
Black’s vision of a world without money has largely come true, but his
prescience was even greater than that. In an unpublished memo, titled
“Fundamentals of Liquidity” (June 1970), Black imagined addi- tional
dimensions ofa future possible ﬁnancial world:</p>
<p>Thus a long term corporate bond could actually be sold to three
separate persons. One would supply the money for the bond; one would
bear the interest rate risk; and one would bear</p>
<p>xvi</p>
<p>the risk of default. The last two would not have to put up any
capital for the bonds, although they might have to post some sort of
collateral.</p>
<p>The instruments Black is suggesting are what we know today as
interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives and, more speciﬁcally,
interest rate swaps and credit default swaps. A central dimension of
Black’s con- tribution at Goldman, Sachs andandandand Co. was his
development of models for pricing interest rate derivatives, but he died
before the credit default swap became a standard instrument. Perhaps as
much as 0 trillion in notional CDS exposure had been written by the peak
of the boom that has now been collapsing ever since August 2007. What
would Black have said about that?</p>
<p>It is possible to imagine an account of the present crisis analogous
to Black’s account of the 1987 crash. For the present case, the changing
taste for risk might most plausibly be located in the market for credit
risk—in part because of credit default swaps?—but investors did not
fully appreci- ate the consequences of that taste change, so their
beliefs about the world came to embody more and more error as credit
spreads grew tighter and tighter.As in 1987, eventually beliefs caught
up to reality and the conse- quence was a price correction. As in 1987,
liquidity factors kicked in to push prices even farther. As in 1987,
domestic price movements stimu- lated similar price movements
worldwide.</p>
<p>Because the present crisis involves debt markets rather than equity
markets, there is an additional dimension that Black would likely have
pointed out. In his very ﬁrst paper, he notes the possible impor- tance
of guarantees on personal notes (pp. 12-13); these guarantees are credit
default swaps. However, he also imagines that the providers of those
guarantees will supervise the borrower, and that the govern- ment might
require providers of guarantees to hold capital to ensure payment. In
the case of American International Group (AIG), neither of these things
happened, and the capital that has ensured payment to AIG counterparties
has come from the government after the fact.</p>
<p>The present crisis has also affected currency markets, including a
breakdown of private forward exchange markets.4 Here as elsewhere,
liquidity effects have very clearly been present, and central banks have
taken it to be their job to use their own balance sheets to make</p>
<p>xvii</p>
<p>up for the vanishing liquidity in markets generally. Notoriously, the
Fed’s balance sheet has already more than doubled in size. Was that the
right thing to do? We cannot know for sure what Fischer Black would have
said, but it would be consistent with his 1988 position to argue that
central banks should have allowed the market to price the extreme
scarcity of liquidity, rather than stepping in to impose an artiﬁcially
low price.</p>
<p>Finally, the ﬁnancial crisis is clearly spilling over into the
economy as a whole. All major economies are in recession at the same
time, and talk at the recent G20 meeting was all about using ﬁscal
stimu- lus to substitute for falling aggregate demand. Black’s view, of
course, would be that the recession, global as it is, is an index of the
extent of mismatch between the structure of production and the structure
of demand. The only way out is to reorganize production by mov- ing
resources in order to bring the structure of production more into
line.That is something that must happen in each country individually,
but also at the global level, so it seems likely to take some time. The
danger is that ﬁscal stimulus delays adjustment and so prolongs the
recession.</p>
<p>That is not, however, to say that the government should do noth- ing.
Most important, Black would have called our attention to the possibility
of a currency trap, which was his explanation of the Great Depression
(p. 89-90, 105, 124-25, 162). Nominal interest rates are now practically
zero, but prices are falling, and that means that real interest rates
are still positive. The zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is a
problem, and not one easily solved by quantitative easing because
(according to Black) the money supply has very little to do with the
price level.</p>
<p>Facing such a dilemma, I wonder whether Black might have reconsidered
his antipathy for measures that expand government pro- vision of
liquidity to take the place of vanishing private provision. That is not
to suggest that he would have approved of the attempts by the Fed to
impose an artiﬁcially low price for liquidity. Rather, the problem with
the Fed’s efforts so far is the excessively single- minded focus on
liquidity in money markets, rather than in credit mar- kets where the
problem originated and where trade has more or less completely broken
down.</p>
<p>xviii</p>
<p>One thing is for sure. Fischer Black would not have been sur- prised
that standard monetary and ﬁscal policy measures have so far had so
little impact on the crisis. “Monetary and exchange rate poli- cies
accomplish almost nothing, and ﬁscal policies are unimportant in causing
or changing business cycles” (p. xxviii).Then, as now, economic crisis
is also crisis for economic theory, and that is potentially a good
thing. Crisis by crisis, knowledge advances.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Fischer Black</p>
<p>Since the late 1960s I have been working on theories that depend on
the idea that economic and ﬁnancial markets are in continual
equilibrium. Equilibrium means there are no opportunities to make
abnormal proﬁts; more generally, it means that there are no easy ways
for people to shift positions in a way that makes everyone better
off.</p>
<p>Equilibrium was the concept that attracted me to ﬁnance and eco-
nomics. I have never had a course in either subject. While working at
Arthur D. Little in 1966, I met Jack Treynor, who began telling me about
an equilibrium theory he was working on called the capital asset pricing
model. I was hooked.</p>
<p>I began doing research in ﬁnance, and later in economics. I started
doing consulting in ﬁnance. I was especially interested in applying the
idea of continual equilibrium to all kinds of markets. I found it stimu-
lating to combine consulting and research: most of the key concepts in
my work were developed at this time, before I went to the University of
Chicago to start my academic career.</p>
<p>The capital asset pricing model was ﬁrst applied to stocks, but I
wanted to apply it to other securities, like options and bonds. In
trying to apply it to options, Myron Scholes and I found an option
pricing</p>
<p>xxii i n t r o d u c t i o n</p>
<p>formula. In trying to apply it to bonds, I developed the notion that
mon- etary policy is and must be passive in an economy with
well-developed ﬁnancial markets.</p>
<p>This research on monetary policy and banking led to my ﬁrst published
paper, which begins this volume. I continued looking for a model that
would allow markets to be in continual equilibrium while leaving a way
for the government to control the money stock, but I was never able to
ﬁnd one. I decided that monetary policy can inﬂuence neither output nor
prices.</p>
<p>At ﬁrst I felt that the government could not inﬂuence interest rates
through open market operations, but I changed that view over time. I
became convinced that it takes time for people to respond to certain
events even when markets are in continual equilibrium.This allows the
government to force the federal funds rate above or below its natu- ral
level while the government is intervening actively in debt markets, but
only if it forces other interest rates in the opposite direction. I
still believe that the government has no control over “the” interest
rate through monetary policy.</p>
<p>This work on monetary theory led me into research on busi- ness
cycles. If monetary policy does not inﬂuence the economy, what does? I
decided that business cycles are a natural result of uncertainty in a
general equilibrium model. I see no need to assume sticky prices or
easily corrected ignorance or government-inﬂuenced aggregate demand to
explain business cycles.</p>
<p>At ﬁrst I put some emphasis on rational expectations in my
theories.</p>
<p>Later I decided I didn’t need that assumption. My key assumption now
is simply that markets are in continual equilibrium. Some people may be
confused, and others may have odd-looking objectives,but so long as
prices and quantities are free to move, we are in a general equilibrium
world.</p>
<p>While I don’t believe the government can do much with open market
operations, I do think it has some inﬂuence on the economy through taxes
and regulations. Changes in taxes and regulations may even play a small
role in business cycles.Taxes can also be used to affect the balance of
trade with other countries, though I don’t think the bal- ance of trade
affects our welfare in any particular way.</p>
<p>Though I think monetary policy is ineffective in a country with
well-developed ﬁnancial markets, I believe that when the government</p>
<p>in a country with more primitive markets prints money and spends it,
the inﬂation rate will rise. Hyperinﬂation will be a common result.</p>
<p>I’m not sure we should say that it’s monetary policy that causes the
hyperinﬂation. A government that prints money and spends it is usu- ally
creating massive deﬁcits at the same time. Perhaps we should say that
ﬁscal policy causes the hyperinﬂation. In any case, a government that
prints massive amounts of money to spend will usually cause both
hyperinﬂation and a general breakdown in ﬁnancial markets.</p>
<p>My research on monetary theory and business cycles led to work on the
balance of payments and the world business cycle. I was unable to ﬁnd
any interesting deﬁnition of the balance of payments other than the net
ﬂow of gold out of a country, and even that has no obvious impact on the
country’s welfare.</p>
<p>The idea that the business cycle is just a way of looking at an econ-
omy in general equilibrium leads naturally to the world business cycle
as a reﬂection of world general equilibrium. In countries that produce
mostly a few products or services, it is especially clear that changes
in overall supply and demand factors can explain business cycles without
the need for devices like sticky prices.</p>
<p>The idea that the world general equilibrium is independent of
monetary factors is a sophisticated version of purchasing power parity.
It says that the paths of real output and relative prices will be unaf-
fected by the paths of the price level and exchange rates. Government
intervention in the foreign exchange market can affect exchange rates
and therefore inﬂation rates, but this will not cause the path of total
real output or the composition of real output or relative prices to be
different than they would otherwise have been. With ﬁxed exchange rates,
inﬂation rates in different countries will be tied together. They will
not be the same, but if inﬂation in one country is higher than it would
otherwise have been, inﬂation in other countries will be higher than it
would otherwise have been. With ﬂexible exchange rates, exchange rate
variations can cause price level variations in the same sense, but it
seems more likely that price level variations will cause exchange rate
variations.That is, when the price level in one country is higher than
it would otherwise have been, the exchange rates for that country with
other countries will be lower than they would otherwise have been.</p>
<p>xxiv</p>
<p>Nominal interest rates and inﬂation rates will be connected in a
similar way. When the nominal interest rate is higher than it would
otherwise have been, the inﬂation rate using any price index will be
higher than it would otherwise have been, though the higher nominal
interest rate is not likely to be a direct cause of the higher inﬂation
rate. I believe that monetary policy is passive, and therefore affects
neither real nor nominal quantities. In particular, it has no effect on
interest rates, exchange rates, or the inﬂation rate.</p>
<p>But if monetary policy doesn’t affect the inﬂation rate, what
does?</p>
<p>At ﬁrst I said that changes in the inﬂation rate are caused by non-
monetary factors such as changes in relative prices. I outlined a theory
of inﬂation in which an increase or decrease in the price of oil will
cause an increase or decrease in the inﬂation rate, other things equal.
Later I added expectations as an important causal factor. In the
theories in this book, the price level and inﬂation rate and exchange
rates are indeterminate. In the world, though, they are determined, and
I now think that expectations play an important role.</p>
<p>In a real sense, inﬂation can be whatever we expect it will be, even
when our expectations are based on the incorrect view that the gov-
ernment can control inﬂation through open market operations.</p>
<p>There was a time, though, when we had a gold standard, which seems to
rule out a role for expectations. If relative prices are given by the
real equilibrium, then ﬁxing the dollar price of a single good will ﬁx
the dollar prices of all goods. None of the prices will be constant, but
they will all be determined by the price of gold.</p>
<p>Thus I decided that the government can control the price level by
standing ready to buy or sell gold at a ﬁxed price. Since the govern-
ment can use this process to ﬁx the price of gold at a point in time, it
can adjust the ﬁxed price of gold over time to stabilize a general price
index.</p>
<p>Only standing ready to buy or sell gold will do it: the government
cannot just pass a law specifying the price of gold, since that would
soon cause almost all transactions in gold to stop. And since monetary
policy must still be passive in my world, controlling the price of gold
acts directly on the price level, rather than acting through monetary
policy.</p>
<p>xxv</p>
<p>In a “small country,” controlling the exchange rate can be as effec-
tive as controlling the price of gold. Even a large country can inﬂuence
its inﬂation rate to some degree if it intervenes in foreign exchange
markets.</p>
<p>In foreign exchange markets, the government can control exchange
rates without holding much currency, since currency can always be
exchanged for other assets. Similarly, the government can apparently
control the price of gold without holding much gold, and without fear of
running out of gold, since it can always exchange gold and other
assets.</p>
<p>This leads to the puzzling notion that the government stands ready to
buy or sell gold at a price that is ﬁxed at each moment, while at the
same time adjusting any surplus or deﬁciency in its stock of gold by
exchanging it for other assets. Or the same thing with foreign exchange
if it is ﬁxing exchange rates. If this is possible, then the government
can control the path of the price level indeﬁnitely.</p>
<p>Buying and selling gold or foreign exchange can be costly,
though.</p>
<p>The government bears direct and indirect transaction costs,
especially when there is “pressure” on the price level or exchange rate.
Since the gains from stabilizing the price level or inﬂation rate are
hard to pin down, the government may decide to let the inﬂation rate and
exchange rates wander about rather than trying to control them.</p>
<p>More recently, I have come to believe that speculative prices con-
tain “noise” introduced by those who trade on mistaken beliefs. In a
somewhat similar way, prices of goods and services contain noise intro-
duced by the investment decisions of those who do not act rationally. I
think this will change the character of business cycles to some degree,
perhaps making the ﬂuctuations larger than they might otherwise be. But
I don’t think it creates an opportunity for the government to improve
welfare in some sense.</p>
<p>Even in the presence of noise, I believe that the business cycle is a
way of looking at the evolution of a world in general equilibrium; that
monetary policy normally inﬂuences neither the business cycle nor the
inﬂation rate; and that a gold standard with a changing price of gold,
but a stable inventory of gold, could be used to control the inﬂation
rate, but won’t be.</p>
<p>xxvi</p>
<p>The idea that the business cycle is just an aspect of general equi-
librium contrasts with most economists’ views of business cycles. Can’t
we do some econometric tests to tell whose ideas are right? Perhaps, but
I haven’t been able to think of any. Econometric tests can tell us a lot
about correlations, but we want to know about causation.We want to know
what causes the business cycle, what causes ﬂuctuations in the trade
balance, and what inﬂuences inﬂation and interest rates.</p>
<p>I have used mostly verbal rather than mathematical descriptions of my
views of business cycles. If we were going to apply statistical tests to
these theories, we would try to create a mathematical description of
some kind. Since I haven’t been able to think of any relevant
statistical tests, I’m not sure what good that would do. More important,
I think creating a mathematical description would tempt us to become too
speciﬁc. We would claim that some things are constant, when hardly
anything is constant. So I have intentionally left the descriptions
mostly verbal.</p>
<p>If my views are correct, there is very little the government should
do to inﬂuence the economy. Monetary and exchange rate policies accom-
plish almost nothing, and ﬁscal policies are unimportant in causing or
changing business cycles.</p>
