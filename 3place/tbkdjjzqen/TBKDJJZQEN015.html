<p>Noise</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>he effects of noise on the world, and on our views of the world, are
profound. Noise in the sense of a large number of small events is often
a causal factor much more powerful than a small number of large events
can be. Noise makes trading in ﬁnancial markets possible, and thus
allows us to observe prices for ﬁnancial assets. Noise causes mar- kets
to be somewhat inefﬁcient, but often prevents us from taking advan- tage
ofinefﬁciencies. Noise in the form of uncertainty about future tastes
and technology by sector causes business cycles, and makes them highly
resistant to improvement through government intervention. Noise in the
form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inﬂation
to be what it is, at least in the absence of a gold standard or ﬁxed
exchange rates. Noise in the form of uncertainty about what relative
prices would be with other exchange rates makes us think incorrectly
that changes in exchange rates or inﬂation rates cause changes in trade
or investment ﬂows or economic activity. Most generally, noise makes it
very difﬁcult to test</p>

<p>either practical or academic theories about the way that ﬁnancial or
eco- nomic markets work.We are forced to act largely in the dark.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>I use the word “noise” in several senses in this chapter.</p>
<p>In my basic model of ﬁnancial markets, noise is contrasted with
information. People sometimes trade on information in the usual way.
They are correct in expecting to make proﬁts from these trades. On the
other hand, people sometimes trade on noise as if it were information.
If they expect to make proﬁts from noise trading, they are incorrect.
However, noise trading is essential to the existence of liquid
markets.</p>
<p>In my model of the way we observe the world, noise is what makes our
observations imperfect. It keeps us from knowing the expected return on
a stock or portfolio. It keeps us from knowing whether mon- etary policy
affects inﬂation or unemployment. It keeps us from know- ing what, if
anything, we can do to make things better.</p>
<p>In my model of inﬂation, noise is the arbitrary element in expecta-
tions that leads to an arbitrary rate of inﬂation consistent with expec-
tations. In my model of business cycles and unemployment, noise is
information that hasn’t arrived yet. It is simply uncertainty about
future demand and supply conditions within and across sectors. When the
information does arrive, the number of sectors where there is a good
match between tastes and technology is an index of economic activ- ity.
In my model of the international economy, changing relative prices
become noise that makes it difﬁcult to see that demand and supply
conditions are largely independent of price levels and exchange rates.
Without these relative price changes, we would see that a version of
purchasing power parity holds most of the time.</p>
<p>I think of these models as equilibrium models. Not rational
equilibrium models, because of the role of noise and because of the
unconventional things I allow an individual’s utility to depend on, but
equilibrium models nonetheless. They were all derived originally as part
of a broad effort to apply the logic behind the capital asset pric- ing
model to markets other than the stock market and to behavior that does
not ﬁt conventional notions of optimization.</p>
<p>Noise 171</p>
<p>These models are in very different ﬁelds: ﬁnance, econometrics, and
macroeconomics. Do they have anything in common other than the use of
the word “noise” in describing them? The common element, I think, is the
emphasis on a diversiﬁed array of unrelated causal elements to explain
what happens in the world.There is no single factor that causes stock
prices to stray from theoretical values, nor even a small number of
factors. There is no single variable whose neglect causes economet- ric
studies to go astray. And there is no simple single or multiple factor
explanation of domestic or international business ﬂuctuations.</p>
<p>While I have made extensive use of the work of others, I recognize
that most researchers in these ﬁelds will regard many of my conclusions
as wrong, or untestable, or unsupported by existing evidence. I have not
been able to think of any conventional empirical tests that would
distinguish between my views and the views of others. In the end, my
response to the skepticism of others is to make a prediction: someday,
these conclusions will be widely accepted.The inﬂuence of noise traders
will become apparent. Conventional monetary and ﬁscal policies will be
seen as ineffective. Changes in exchange rates will come to provoke no
more comment than changes in the real price of an airline ticket.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, research will be seen as a process leading to
reliable and relevant conclusions only very rarely, because of the noise
that creeps in at every step.</p>
<p>If my conclusions are not accepted, I will blame it on noise.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>Noise makes ﬁnancial markets possible, but also makes them
imperfect.1</p>
<p>If there is no noise trading, there will be very little trading in
individ- ual assets.2 People will hold individual assets, directly or
indirectly, but they will rarely trade them. People trading to change
their exposure to broad market risks will trade in mutual funds, or
portfolios, or index futures, or index options.They will have little
reason to trade in the shares ofan indi- vidual ﬁrm.3 People who want
cash to spend or who want to invest cash they have received will
increase or decrease their positions in short-term securities, or money
market accounts, or money market mutual funds, or loans backed by real
estate or other assets.</p>
<p>A person with information or insights about individual ﬁrms will want
to trade, but will realize that only another person with information or
insights will take the other side of the trade. Taking the other side’s
information into account, is it still worth trading? From the point of
view of someone who knows what both the traders know, one side or the
other must be making a mistake.4 If the one who is making a mistake
declines to trade, there will be no trading on information.</p>
<p>In other words, I do not believe it makes sense to create a model
with information trading but no noise trading where traders have dif-
ferent beliefs and one trader’s beliefs are as good as any other
trader’s beliefs. Differences in beliefs must derive ultimately from
differences in information.5 A trader with a special piece of
information will know that other traders have their own special pieces
of information, and will therefore not automatically rush out to
trade.</p>
<p>But if there is little or no trading in individual shares, there can
be no trading in mutual funds or portfolios or index futures or index
options, because there will be no practical way to price them. The whole
structure of ﬁnancial markets depends on relatively liquid mar- kets in
the shares of individual ﬁrms.</p>
<p>Noise trading provides the essential missing ingredient. Noise trad-
ing is trading on noise as if it were information. People who trade on
noise are willing to trade even though from an objective point of view
they would be better off not trading. Perhaps they think the noise they
are trading on is information. Or perhaps they just like to trade.6</p>
<p>With a lot of noise traders in the markets, it now pays for those
with information to trade. It even pays for people to seek out costly
information which they will then trade on. Most of the time, the noise
traders as a group will lose money by trading, while the informa- tion
traders as a group will make money.</p>
<p>The more noise trading there is, the more liquid the markets will be,
in the sense of having frequent trades that allow us to observe prices.
But noise trading actually puts noise into the prices.The price of a
stock reﬂects both the information that information traders trade on and
the noise that noise traders trade on.</p>
<p>As the amount of noise trading increases, it will become more proﬁt-
able for people to trade on information, but only because the prices
have more noise in them.The increase in the amount of information
trading</p>
<p>does not mean that prices are more efﬁcient. Not only will more
infor- mation traders come in, but existing information traders will
take bigger positions and will spend more on information.Yet prices will
be less efﬁ- cient.7 What’s needed for a liquid market causes prices to
be less efﬁcient.</p>
<p>The information traders will not take large enough positions to
eliminate the noise. For one thing, their information gives them an
edge, but does not guarantee a proﬁt. Taking a larger position means
taking more risk. So there is a limit to how large a position a trader
will take. For another thing, the information traders can never be sure
that they are trading on information rather than noise. What if the
information they have has already been reﬂected in prices? Trading on
that kind of infor- mation will be just like trading on noise.8 Because
the actual return on a portfolio is a very noisy estimate of expected
return, even after adjusting for returns on the market and other
factors, it will be difﬁcult to show that information traders have an
edge. For the same reason, it will be dif- ﬁcult to show that noise
traders are losing by trading. There will always be a lot of ambiguity
about who is an information trader and who is a noise trader.</p>
<p>The noise that noise traders put into stock prices will be
cumulative, in the same sense that a drunk tends to wander farther and
farther from his starting point. Offsetting this, though, will be the
research and actions taken by the information traders. The farther the
price of a stock gets from its value, the more aggressive the
information traders will become. More of them will come in, and they
will take larger positions.They may even initiate mergers, leveraged
buyouts, and other restructurings.</p>
<p>Thus the price of a stock will tend to move back towards its value
over time.9 The move will often be so gradual that it is imperceptible.
If it is fast, technical traders will perceive it and speed it up. If it
is slow enough, technical traders will not be able to see it, or will be
so unsure of what they see that they will not take large
positions.10</p>
<p>Still, the farther the price of a stock moves away from value, the
faster it will tend to move back.This limits the degree to which it is
likely to move away from value. All estimates of value are noisy, so we
can never know how far away price is from value.</p>
<p>However, we might deﬁne an efﬁcient market as one in which price is
within a factor of two of value, i.e., the price is more than half of
value and less than twice value.11 The factor of two is arbitrary, of
course.</p>
<p>Intuitively, though, it seems reasonable to me, in the light of
sources of uncertainty about value and the strength of the forces
tending to cause price to return to value. By this deﬁnition, I think
almost all markets are efﬁcient almost all of the time.“Almost all”
means at least 90 percent.</p>
<p>Because value is not observable, it is possible for events that have
no information content to affect price. For example, the addition of a
stock to the Standard andandandand Poors 500 index will cause some
investors to buy it. Their buying will force the price up for a time.
Information trading will force it back, but only gradually.12</p>
<p>Similarly, when a ﬁrm with two classes of common stock issues more of
one class, the price of the class of stock issued will decline relative
to the price of the class of stock not issued.13</p>
<p>Both price and value will look roughly like geometric random walk
processes with non-zero means. The means of percentage change in price
and value will change over time. The mean of the value process will
change because tastes and technology and wealth change. It may well
decline when value rises, and rise when value declines. The mean of the
price process will change because the relation between price and value
changes (and because the mean of the value process changes). Price will
tend to move toward value.</p>
<p>The short-term volatility of price will be greater than the
short-term volatility of value. Since noise is independent of
information in this con- text, when the variance of the percentage price
moves caused by noise is equal to the variance of the percentage price
moves caused by infor- mation, the variance of percentage price moves
from day to day will be roughly twice the variance of percentage value
moves from day to day. Over longer intervals, though, the variances will
converge. Because price tends to return to value, the variance of price
several years from now will be much less than twice the variance of
value several years from now.</p>
<p>Volatilities will change over time. The volatility of the value of a
ﬁrm is affected by things like the rate of arrival of information about
the ﬁrm and the ﬁrm’s leverage. All the factors affecting the volatility
of a ﬁrm’s value will change. The volatility of price will change for
all these reasons and for other reasons as well. Anything that changes
the amount or character of noise trading will change the volatility of
price.</p>
<p>Noise traders must trade to have their inﬂuence. Because informa-
tion traders trade with noise traders more than with other
information</p>
<p>traders, cutting back on noise trading also cuts back on information
trading. Thus prices will not move as much when the market is closed as
they move when the market is open.14 The relevant market here is the
market on which most of the noise traders trade.</p>
<p>Noise traders may prefer low-priced stocks to high-priced stocks.</p>
<p>If they do, then splits will increase both the liquidity of a stock
and its day-to-day volatility. Low-priced stocks will be less efﬁciently
priced than high-priced stocks.15</p>
<p>The price of a stock will be a noisy estimate of its value.The earn-
ings of a ﬁrm (multiplied by a suitable price-earnings ratio) will give
another estimate of the value of the ﬁrm’s stock.16 This estimate will
be noisy too. So long as noise traders do not always look at earnings in
deciding how to trade, the estimate from earnings will give informa-
tion that is not already in the estimate from price.17</p>
<p>Because an estimate of value based on earnings will have so much
noise, there will be no easy way to use price-earnings ratios in manag-
ing portfolios. Even if stocks with low price-earnings ratios have
higher expected returns than other stocks, there will be periods,
possibly last- ing for years, when stocks with low price-earnings ratios
have lower returns than other comparable stocks.</p>
<p>In other words, noise creates the opportunity to trade proﬁtably, but
at the same time makes it difﬁcult to trade proﬁtably.</p>
<p>Econometrics</p>
<p>Why do people trade on noise?</p>
<p>One reason is that they like to do it.Another is that there is so
much noise around that they don’t know they are trading on noise.They
think they are trading on information.18</p>
<p>Neither of these reasons ﬁts into a world where people do things only
to maximize expected utility of wealth, and where people always make the
best use of available information. Once we let trading enter the utility
function directly (as a way of saying that people like to trade), it’s
hard to know where to stop. If anything can be in the utility function,
the notion that people act to maximize expected utility is in danger of
losing much ofits content.</p>
<p>So we want to be careful about letting things into the utility
function.</p>
<p>We want to do it only when the evidence is compelling. I believe that
this is such a case.</p>
<p>Another such case is dividend payments by ﬁrms. Given our tax laws,
it seems clear that share repurchase in a non-systematic way is better
than payment of dividends. If people want to maximize only expected
utility of after-tax wealth, there will be no reason for ﬁrms to pay
regular dividends. And when they do pay dividends, they will apologize
to the stockholders (at least to individual stockholders) for causing
them the discomfort of extra taxes.19</p>
<p>The idea that dividends convey information beyond that conveyed by
the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial statements and public announcements stretches the
imagination.20 It is especially odd that some ﬁrms pay dividends while
making periodic offerings of common stock that raise more money than the
ﬁrms are paying in dividends. For such ﬁrms, we can- not say that
dividends force the ﬁrm to go through the rigors ofa pub- lic offering
of stock. Even if they pay no dividends, they will still be issuing
common stock.21</p>
<p>I think we must assume that investors care about dividends
directly.</p>
<p>We must put dividends into the utility function.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should be happy that we can continue to think in terms of
expected utility at all.There is considerable evidence now that people
do not obey the axioms of expected utility. Of special concern is the
ﬁnding that people will take certain gambles to avoid losses, but will
refuse the same gambles when they involve prospective gains. Can this be
consistent with risk aversion?22</p>
<p>I think that noise is a major reason for the use of decision rules
that seem to violate the normal axioms of expected utility. Because
there is so much noise in the world, people adopt rules of thumb. They
share their rules of thumb with each other, and very few people have
enough experience with interpreting noisy evidence to see that the rules
are too simple. Over time, I expect that the transmission through the
media and through the schools of scientiﬁc ways of interpreting evidence
will gradually make the rules of thumb more sophisticated, and will thus
make the expected utility model more valid.</p>
<p>Even highly trained people, though, seem to make certain kinds of
errors consistently. For example, there is a strong tendency in looking
at</p>
<p>data to assume that when two events frequently happen together, one
causes the other. There is an even stronger tendency to assume that the
one that occurs ﬁrst causes the one that occurs second. These tendencies
are easy to resist in the simplest cases. But they seem to creep back in
when econometric studies become more complex. Sometimes I wonder if we
can draw any conclusions at all from the results of regression
studies.</p>
<p>Because there is so much noise in the world, certain things are
essentially unobservable.</p>
<p>For example, we cannot know what the expected return on the market
is.There is every reason to believe that it changes over time, and no
particular reason to believe that the changes occur smoothly.We can use
the average past return as an estimate of the expected return, but it is
a very noisy estimate.23</p>
<p>Similarly, the slopes of demand and supply curves are so hard to
esti- mate that they are essentially unobservable. Introspection seems
as good a method as any in trying to estimate them. One major problem is
that no matter how many variables we include in an econometric analysis,
there always seem to be potentially important variables that we have
omitted, possibly because they too are unobservable.24</p>
<p>For example, wealth is often a key variable in estimating any demand
curve. But wealth is itself unobservable. It’s not even clear how to
deﬁne it.The market value of traded assets is part ofit, but the value
of non-traded assets and especially of human capital is a bigger part
for most individuals.There is no way to observe the value of human
capital for an individual, and it is not clear how we might go about
adding up the values of human capital for individuals to obtain a value
of human capital for a whole economy.</p>
<p>I suspect that if it were possible to observe the value of human
capi- tal, we would ﬁnd it ﬂuctuating in much the same way that the
level of the stock market ﬂuctuates. In fact, I think we would ﬁnd
ﬂuctuations in the value of human capital to be highly correlated with
ﬂuctuations in the level of the stock market, though the magnitude of
the ﬂuctuations in the value of human capital is probably less than the
magnitude of the ﬂuctuations in the level of the stock market.25</p>
<p>It’s actually easier to list observables than unobservables, since so
many things are unobservable. The interest rate is observable. If there
were enough trading in CPI futures, the real interest rate would be</p>
<p>observable. So far, though, there are not enough noise traders in CPI
futures to make it a viable market.</p>
<p>Stock prices and stock returns are observable. The past volatility of
a stock’s returns is observable, and by using daily returns we can come
close to observing the current volatility of a stock’s returns.We can
also</p>
<p>come close to observing the correlations among the returns on
different stocks.</p>
<p>Economic variables seem generally less observable than ﬁnancial
variables. The prices of goods and services are hard to observe, because
they are speciﬁc to location and terms of trade much more than ﬁnan-
cial variables. Quantities are hard to observe, because what is traded
dif- fers from place to place and through time.</p>
<p>Thus econometric studies involving economic variables are hard to
interpret for two reasons: ﬁrst, the coefﬁcients of regressions tell us
little about causal relations even when the variables are observable;
and second, the variables are subject to lots of measurement error, and
the measure- ment errors are probably related to the true values of the
variables.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest economic variable to observe is the money stock,
once we agree on a deﬁnition for it. I think that accounts for some of
the fascination it holds for economic theorists. In my view, though,
this easiest to observe of economic variables has no important role in
the workings ofthe economy. Money is still important, but the money
stock is not.</p>
<p>Still, the money stock is correlated with every measure of eco- nomic
activity, because the amount of money used in trade is related to the
volume of trade. This correlation implies neither that the gov- ernment
can control the money stock nor that changes in the money stock inﬂuence
economic activity.26</p>
<p>Empirical studies in ﬁnance are easier to do than empirical studies
in economics, because data on security prices are of generally higher
quality than the available data in economics. But there are major
pitfalls in trying to interpret even the results of studies of security
prices.</p>
<p>For example, many recent empirical studies in ﬁnance have taken the
form of “event studies,” which look at stock price reactions to
announcements that affect a ﬁrm.27 If there were no noise in stock
prices, this would be a very reliable way to ﬁnd out how certain events
affect ﬁrms. In fact, though, the stock price reaction tells us only
how</p>
<p>investors think the events will affect ﬁrms, and investors’thoughts
include both noise and information.</p>
<p>Moreover, if investors care directly about certain attributes of a
ﬁrm (such as its dividend yield) independently of how those attributes
affect its value, event studies will pick up these preferences along
with the effects of the events on value. When a ﬁrm increases its
dividend, its price may go up because investors like dividends, even
though the present value of its future dividends in a world where the
marginal investor is taxed may have gone down.</p>
<p>Is there any solution to these problems? No single, simple solu-
tion, I believe. Correlations among economic and ﬁnancial variables do
give us some information of value. Experimental studies in eco- nomics
and ﬁnance have value. Analysis of“stylized facts” is often use- ful.
Unusual events can provide special insight. In the end, a theory is
accepted not because it is conﬁrmed by conventional empirical tests, but
because researchers persuade one another that the theory is correct and
relevant.28</p>
<p>Macroeconomics</p>
<p>If business cycles were caused by unanticipated shifts in the general
price level or in the level of government spending, we might not call
that kind of uncertainty noise. It’s too simple. Because it is so
simple, I don’t think this kind of uncertainty can play a major role in
business cycles. I have not seen any models with all the kinds of
markets we have in the economy where shifts in the general price level
or in the level of government spending are large enough or powerful
enough or unanticipated enough to cause signiﬁcant busi- ness
cycles.29</p>
<p>On the other hand, if business cycles are caused by unantici- pated
shifts in the entire pattern of tastes and technologies across sec-
tors, we might call that uncertainty noise. I believe that these shifts
are signiﬁcant for the economy as a whole because they do not cancel in
any meaningful sense.The number of sectors in which there is a match
between tastes and technology varies a lot over time. When it is high,
we have an expansion.When it is low, we have a recession.30</p>
<p>One reason the shifts do not cancel is that they are not independ-
ent across sectors. When the costs of producing goods and services that
require oil are high, they will be high across many related sectors.
When demand for vacation homes is high, it will be high for many kinds
of related services at the same time. The more we divide sec- tors into
subsectors, the more related the subsectors will be to one another.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the increasing diversity and specialization
that go along with the transition from a simple economy to a complex
modern economy will be associated with larger or smaller business
cycles. On the one hand, the diversity in a more complex economy means
that a single crop failure or demand shock cannot have such a
devastating effect; but on the other hand, the specialization in a more
complex economy means that when there is a mismatch between tastes and
technology, it is costly to move skills and machines between sectors to
correct the mismatch.</p>
<p>Money and prices play no role in this explanation. Everything is
real.31 For a small sample of the kind of thing I have in mind, suppose
I gear up to produce dolls, while you gear up to produce art books. If
it turns out that you want dolls and I want art books, we will have a
boom. We will both work hard, and will exchange our outputs, and will
have high consumption of both dolls and art books. But if it turns out
that you want action toys and I want science books, we will have a
bust.The relative price of toys and books may be the same as before, but
neither of us will work so hard because we will not value highly that
which we can exchange our outputs for.</p>
<p>This is just one kind of example. The variations can occur in use of
machines as well as in use of people, and the underlying uncertainty can
concern what we can make as well as what we want.</p>
<p>Unanticipated shifts in tastes and technology within and across
sectors is what we call information in discussing ﬁnancial markets. In
economic markets, it seems more appropriate to call these shifts noise,
to contrast them with shifts in the aggregates that conventional
macroeconomic models focus on. In other words, the cause of busi- ness
cycles is not a few large things that can be measured and control- led,
but many small things that are difﬁcult to measure and essentially
impossible to control.</p>
<p>Noise or uncertainty has its effects in economic markets because
there are costs in shifting physical and human resources within and
between sectors. If skills and capital can be shifted without cost after
tastes and technology become known, mismatches between what we can do
and what we want to do will not occur.</p>
<p>The costs of shifting real resources are clearly large, so it is
plausible that these costs might play a role in business cycles.The
costs of putting inﬂation adjustments in contracts or of publicizing
changes in the money stock or the price level seem low, so it is not
plausible that these costs play a signiﬁcant role in business
cycles.</p>
<p>Presumably the government does not have better information about the
details of future supply and demand conditions within and between
sectors than the people working in those sectors. Thus there is little
the government can do to help the economy avoid recessions. These
unknown future details are noise to the workers and managers involved,
and they are noise twice over to government employees, even those who
collect statistics on individual industries.</p>
<p>I cannot think of any conventional econometric tests that would shed
light on the question of whether my business cycle theory is cor- rect
or not. One of its predictions, though, is that real wages will ﬂuc-
tuate with other measures of economic activity.When there is a match
between tastes and technology in many sectors, income will be high,
wages will be high, output will be high, and unemployment will be low.
Thus real wages will by procyclical. This is obviously true over long
periods, as from the 1920s to the 1930s and from the 1930s to the 1940s,
but it also seems true over shorter periods, especially when overtime
and layoffs are taken into account.32</p>
<p>How do inﬂation and money ﬁt into this picture?</p>
<p>I believe that monetary policy is almost completely passive in a
country like the US.33 Money goes up when prices go up or when income
goes up because demand for money goes up at those times. I have been
unable to construct an equilibrium model in which changes in money cause
changes in prices or income, but I have had no trouble constructing an
equilibrium model in which changes in prices or income cause changes in
money.34</p>
<p>Changes in money often precede changes in income, but this is not
surprising, since demand for money can depend on expected income as</p>
<p>well as current income. Changes in wealth (measured at market value)
also precede changes in income.</p>
<p>In the conventional story, open market operations change perceived
wealth, which leads to a change in demand for existing assets, and thus
to a change in the price level. But open market operations have no
effect on wealth when wealth is measured at market value. They merely
substitute one form of wealth for another. Some say that open market
operations cause a change in interest rates, which then have further
effects on the economy. But this cannot happen in an equilib- rium
model. There is no temporary equilibrium, with the price level and rate
of inﬂation unchanged, where a different interest rate will be equal to
the certain component of the marginal product of capital. If we allow
the price level and rate of inﬂation to change, then there are many
equilibria, but there are no rules to tell us how one is chosen over
another. There is no logical story explaining how the change in money
will cause a shift from one equilibrium to another.</p>
<p>If monetary policy doesn’t cause changes in inﬂation, what does?</p>
<p>I think that the price level and rate of inﬂation are literally
indetermi- nate. They are whatever people think they will be. They are
determined by expectations, but expectations follow no rational rules.
If people believe that certain changes in the money stock will cause
changes in the rate of inﬂation, that may well happen, because their
expectations will be built into their long-term contracts.</p>
<p>Another way to make the same point is this. Within a sector, the
prices of inputs and outputs are largely taken as given. Decisions on
what and how much to produce are made taking these prices as given. Thus
each sector assumes that the rates of inﬂation of its input and output
prices are given. In my models, this includes the govern- ment sector in
its role as supplier of money. If we are in an equilib- rium with one
expected rate of inﬂation (assuming neither gold prices nor exchange
rates are ﬁxed), and everyone shifts to a lower expected rate of
inﬂation, we will have (with only minor modiﬁcations) a new
equilibrium.</p>
<p>One way to describe this view is to say that noise causes changes in
the rate ofinﬂation.</p>
<p>If we have a gold standard, where the price of gold is adjusted over
time to make the general price level follow a desired path, and where
the</p>
<p>government stands ready to buy or sell gold at the temporarily ﬁxed
price without allowing its inventory to ﬂuctuate much, then inﬂation
will be controlled rather than random.35 But it seems unlikely that we
will adopt a gold standard of this kind or ofany other kind anytime
soon.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a small country adopts a policy of varying its exchange
rate with a large country to make its price level follow a desired path,
where its government stands ready to buy or sell foreign exchange at the
temporarily ﬁxed rate without allowing its foreign exchange inventory to
ﬂuctuate much, then its inﬂation rate will be controlled rather than
random.This is possible for any country that has wealth and stable
taxing power, because the country can always sell assets for foreign
exchange, and can then buy the assets back (almost) with the foreign
currency it obtains.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear what is gained by controlling the price
level. If business cycles are caused by real factors rather than by
things that are affected by the rate of inﬂation, then many of the
reasons for controlling inﬂation vanish.</p>
<p>In my view, then, there is a real international equilibrium that is
largely unaffected by price levels or monetary policies, except in
countries with unstable ﬁnancial markets or national debt that is large
compared with taxable wealth. This real equilibrium involves a world
business cycle and national business cycles driven by the degree to
which there is a match between tastes and technology.</p>
<p>The real equilibrium also involves changing relative prices for all
kinds of goods and services, including relative prices for the “same”
goods and services in different locations. Different locations can be
around the corner or around the world. Since information and trans-
portation are so costly (especially information), there is no form of
arbi- trage that will force the prices of similar goods and services in
different locations to be similar.</p>
<p>Moreover, the real equilibrium involves constantly changing trade
ﬂows for various pairs of countries. There is no reason for trade to be
balanced between any pair of countries either in the short run or in the
long run. And an imbalance in trade has no particular welfare
implications.36</p>
<p>Since the real equilibrium is ﬁxed at a point in time, though it is
continually changing through time, a higher domestic currency price</p>
<p>for an item at one point in time will mean a higher domestic currency
price for all items at that same point in time. There will be some lags
in making price changes, and many lags in posting or reporting price
changes, but these will not affect the equilibrium signiﬁcantly.</p>
<p>If we were able to observe the economy at a given point in time with
two different domestic price levels, we would see that the real
equilibrium is largely independent of price levels and exchange rates,
and we might call this situation “purchasing power parity.” Since we
must actually observe the economy as it evolves over time, we cannot see
that purchasing power parity holds.We see relative price changes occur-
ring, and ﬂuctuations in the level of economic activity, while
exchange</p>
<p>rates and money stocks are changing.We think that exchange rates
and</p>
<p>money are causing relative price changes and business
ﬂuctuations.37</p>
<p>But that is only because the noise in the data is clouding our
vision.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The concept of noise trading and its role in ﬁnancial markets
that I develop in this chapter was developed through conversations with
James Stone.</p></li>
<li><p>Jaffe and Winkler (1976) have a model where the traders who make
specu- lative markets stable are those who trade to adjust their risk
levels or who misperceive their forecasting abilities or who trade for
reasons other than maximizing expected return for a given level of risk.
Figlewski (1978) has a model where there are two types of traders who
differ in forecasting ability. Since neither kind of trader explicitly
takes into account the information the other kind of trader has, each is
to some degree trading on noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Rubinstein (1975), Milgrom and Stokey (1982), and Hakansson,
Kunkel, and Ohlson (1982) show in a state preference world that
differences in information may affect prices without causing people to
trade. Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) show that there may be no
equilibrium when rational investors trade in the mar- ket portfolio.
Grossman (1978) shows the same thing for a world with trading in
individual assets. Diamond and Verrecchia (1981) redeﬁne a rational
expecta- tions equilibrium in the presence of noise and show the
conditions under which their equilibrium exists. In Tirole’s model
(1982),“speculation” relies on incon- sistent plans, and thus is ruled
out by rational expectations. Kyle (1984, 1985a, 1985b) and Grinblatt
and Ross (1985) look at quite different models of equilib- rium where
traders have market power. Kyle speciﬁcally examines the effects of
changing the number of noise traders in both kinds of
equilibrium.</p></li>
<li><p>This assumes that the traders start with well-diversiﬁed
portfolios. In Admati</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(1985), the traders start with suboptimal portfolios of assets.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Varian (1985) distinguishes between “opinions” and “information.”
He says that only differences in opinions will generate trading. In the
kind of model he is working with, I think that differences of opinion
will not exist.</p></li>
<li><p>In Laffont (1985), traders gather costly information because it
has direct util- ity for reasons other than trading. Once they have it,
they trade on it. If peo- ple start with efﬁcient portfolios, though,
even the arrival of free information may not make them want to trade.We
may need to introduce direct utility of trading to explain the existence
of speculative markets.</p></li>
<li><p>This result is speciﬁc to a model where noise traders trade on
noise as if it were information. In Kyle’s (1984, 1985a, 1985b) model,
having more noise traders can make markets more efﬁcient.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrow (1982) says that excessive reaction to current information
character- izes all the securities and future markets. If this is true,
it could be caused by trading on information that has already been
discounted.</p></li>
<li><p>Merton (1971) describes a model where long-run prices are
efﬁcient but short-run prices need not be.</p></li>
<li><p>Summers (1986) emphasizes the difﬁculty in telling whether
markets are efﬁ- cient or not. This difﬁculty affects market
participants and researchers alike.</p></li>
<li><p>I think this puts me between Merton (1985) and Shiller (1981,
1984). Deviations from efﬁciency seem more signiﬁcant in my world than
in Merton’s, but much less signiﬁcant in my world than in
Shiller’s.</p></li>
<li><p>This effect was discovered independently by Shleifer (1986) and
Gurel and Harris (1985).</p></li>
<li><p>Loderer and Zimmermann (1985) discovered this effect in
connection with offerings in Switzerland, where multiple classes of
stock are common.</p></li>
<li><p>French and Roll (1985) ﬁnd that the volatilities of stock returns
are much lower across periods when markets are closed than across
periods when markets are open.</p></li>
<li><p>Ohlson and Penman (1985) ﬁnd that when stocks split, their return
volatili- ties go up on the ex-split date by an average of about 30
percent.This may be due to a higher proportion of noise traders, though
they also ﬁnd no increase in trading volume on the ex-split date.Amihud
(1985) feels that another pos- sible explanation for this result is the
increase in the bid-asked spread follow- ing a stock split.</p></li>
<li><p>For a discussion of the relation between earnings and stock
price, see Black (1980).</p></li>

(1985) give more evidence on the existence of temporary dislocations in
price and on the psychological factors that may inﬂuence the noise
traders who create these opportunities.</p>

peo- ple make decisions for what are seemingly non-rational

and Thaler (1985).</p></li>
<li><p>In Black (1978a), I described the dividend puzzle.The solution to
the puzzle, I now believe, is that we must put dividends directly into
the utility function. For one way of putting dividends into the utility

<li><p>This phenomenon is discussed extensively by Tversky and Kahneman

activity inﬂu- ences the money stock rather than the other way

<p>C Y C L E S and EQUILIBRIUM</p>
<p>Updated Edition</p>
<p>“This book and the articles that preceded it electriﬁed the ﬁrst
generation of</p>
<p>Wall Street quants with Fischer’s famous rallying cry, ‘In my model,
markets work,’</p>
<p>and challenged them to ‘imagine a world without money.’ He gave us
clear, logically</p>
<p>consistent macroeconomics, without jargon or unnecessary math,
which</p>
<p>was directly useful for making money. The material is as fresh and as
relevant</p>
<p>to proﬁt as when it was written. ”</p>
<p>—Aaron Brown, AQR Capital Management, author of The Poker Face of
Wall Street and A World of Chance</p>
<p>“Fischer Black has long been known as a genius in ﬁnance. He was also
a genius</p>
<p>on business cycles and monetary theory, and this book is the proof.
”</p>
<p>—Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics, George Mason University</p>
<p>“Fischer Black is a household name on Wall Street. Had he lived,
Fischer would have shared (with Robert Merton and Myron Scholes) the
Nobel Prize for</p>
<p>their work in ﬁnancial economics. But Fischer also made
extraordinarily deep</p>
<p>contributions to macroeconomics. This collection of Fischer’s key
macro</p>
<p>analyses is a feast for the intellect, but one that is very easily
digested thanks to</p>
<p>Perry Mehrling’s marvelous introduction, historical perspective, and
unique</p>
<p>ability to connect Fischer’s many dots. The book is of special
relevance to anyone</p>
<p>hoping to understand today’s ﬁnancial crisis and its
macroeconomic</p>
<p>and policy ramiﬁcations. I recommend it most highly. ”</p>
<p>—Laurence Kotlikoff, Professor of Economics, Boston University</p>
