<p>Global Monetarism in a</p>

<p>Tacsaiees</p>
<p>countries.1 With ﬁxed exchange rates, this theory says, an increase
in any one country’s money stock will cause a world increase in prices
(at least in the long run) by increasing the world’s money stock.The
size of the effect on world money and prices will depend on the size of
the country that increases its money stock relative to the sizes of the
other countries.2</p>

Spring, 1978. I am grateful to Robert Aliber, Stanley Black, Rudiger
Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Arthur Laffer, Merton Miller, Ronald
McKinnon, Michael Mussa, and a referee for helpful comments on earlier
versions of this chapter.</p>
<p>108 b u s i n e s s c y c l e s a n d e q u i l i b r i u m</p>
<p>This theory is based on the notion that money is like gold: it has no
national identity. In fact, though, the vast bulk of the money now used
in the world does have national identity and is not backed in any
meaningful sense by gold or an international paper money.</p>
<p>The usual theory of global monetarism assumes that each coun- try’s
money stock is partly domestic currency and partly international
reserves. It assumes that the total money stock used within a country is
related in a stable way to its price level, and that countries inﬂu-
ence one another largely through ﬂows of international reserves across
national boundaries. In some cases, these ﬂows of international reserves
will be in exchange for goods or capital.</p>
<p>I would like to explore the form this theory would take if it were
assumed that national currencies are the only kinds of money in the
world. Let’s look at two models: ﬁrst, a simple model in which a coun-
try’s currency is used only internally; and second, a model with inter-
national reserves in the sense that one country’s currency is held by
the governments of other countries.</p>
<p>A Simple Model</p>
<p>To start, we make the simplest and most extreme assumptions
consistent with the notion that national currencies are the only kinds
of money. They are as follows:</p>
<p>• Currency is the only form of money. It represents all non-interest-
bearing forms of money that may be used in a country.</p>
<p>• A country’s currency is used only internally. The working balances
of other countries’ currencies that importers and exporters may hold
will be ignored.</p>
<p>• The ratio of a country’s price level and the amount of its currency
in circulation is constant. In other words, the simplest form of the
quantity theory of money is assumed.</p>
<p>• The exchange rate between two countries is the inverse of the ratio
of the price levels in the two countries. The simplest form of
purchasing power parity is thus assumed.</p>
<p>• Monetary policy is used to keep all exchange rates constant through
time; this is a world of permanently ﬁxed exchange rates.</p>
<p>Global Monetarism in a World of National Currencies 109</p>
<p>Under these assumptions, monetary policy alone is sufﬁcient to ﬁx
exchange rates. Two countries need only set the ratio of their money
stocks equal to the inverse of the desired exchange rate. No
international reserves are needed to set exchange rates. No intervention
in foreign exchange markets is needed either.</p>
<p>Since there are no ﬂows of international reserves between countries,
it is hard to see how one can meaningfully deﬁne a balance-of-payments
surplus or deﬁcit.Any country can keep its exchange rate ﬁxed with any
other country using monetary policy alone, as long as the two countries
have consistent objectives. (It isn’t possible for one country to
achieve one exchange rate while the other achieves a different exchange
rate.) A country would never be forced by international ﬂows to change
its target exchange rate with another country.</p>
<p>The changes in a country’s price level that go along with keeping
exchange rates ﬁxed may come to be regarded as politically unaccept-
able, so it might devalue or revalue its currency.And if monetary policy
affects a country other than through its price level, the country might
well decide to change the target exchange rate from time to time. But a
devaluation would never be forced by continuing payments deﬁcits.</p>
<p>Home Countries and Target Countries</p>
<p>Let’s call a country that chooses its monetary policy to ﬁx its
exchange rate with another country a “home country,” and a country that
chooses its monetary policy in some other way a “target country.” If
exchange rates are ﬁxed among a group of n countries, then it is natural
for one of these countries to be a target country and for the remaining
n - 1 countries to be home countries.</p>
<p>For example, in Figure 9.1 we have eight ways for exchange rates to
be ﬁxed among ﬁve countries. Each country at the start of an arrow
chooses its money stock to keep the desired exchange rate with the
country at the other end of the arrow. In section 1.5, for example,
coun- tries B and C both ﬁx their exchange rates with country A, while
coun-</p>
<p>tries D and E both ﬁx their exchange rates with country C.</p>
<p>Sections 1.1 through 1.8 represent equally good ways of ﬁxing
exchange rates among ﬁve countries, and they all have country A as</p>
<p>1.1</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>1.4</p>
<p>A B</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>1.7</p>
<p>Y</p>
<p>A C</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>1.2</p>
<p>C D</p>
<p>1.5</p>
<p>1.8</p>
<p>1.3</p>
<p>1.6</p>
<p>Figure 9.1 Equivalent ways to ﬁx exchange rates</p>
<p>the target country and the other four countries as home countries. No
arrows start with country A, so it may choose its money stock and price
level freely.</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 shows some less likely ways of ﬁxing exchange rates among
ﬁve countries. Section 2.1 indicates that country A is trying to choose
its money stock to ﬁx exchange rates with each of the other four
countries.This will be impossible unless the other four countries
coordi- nate their policies, which would mean more arrows in the
diagram.</p>
<p>The pattern in section 2.2 also won’t allow exchange rates to be ﬁxed
among ﬁve countries.There is nothing in the diagram that would</p>
<p>2.1</p>
<p>2.2</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>2.3</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 Unlikely ways to ﬁx exchange rates</p>
<p>ﬁx rates between the two groups,A, B, and C, on the one hand, and D
and E, on the other.</p>
<p>The diagram in section 2.3 will work only if the exchange rates are
chosen to be consistent.Every country in 2.3 is a home country; no
country has the freedom to set its money stock and price level. It would
seem better to erase one of the arrows and make one country a target
country, as in 1.1.</p>
<p>It certainly is possible to imagine that the target country shares
its power with the home countries, in the sense that it takes into
account their suggestions on how it should control its money stock and
price level. The home countries have some power to have their
suggestions taken seriously, because they are free to stop maintaining
the customary exchange rates if they are not happy with the target
country’s policies. As long as ﬁxed rates are maintained, there is just
one degree of freedom among the monetary policies in the n
countries.3</p>
<p>In other words, with given exchange rates, one country is free to
choose its money stock and price level, while all the others must follow
its lead. Through ﬁxed exchange rates, the target country chooses every
other country’s price level and money stock along with its own.</p>
<p>In the literature on global monetarism,“ﬁxed exchange rates” gener-
ally mean that no country has direct control over its money stock.4 In
our simple model, we see that a target country does have direct control
over its money stock, in the sense that it can use control of its money
stock toward objectives other than ﬁxing exchange rates.</p>
<p>Note that the relative size of a country does not matter.The target
country has the power to determine the world price level, no matter how
large it is. A 10 percent increase in the target country’s money stock
will cause a 10 percent increase in every other country’s money</p>
<p>stock and a 10 percent increase in every country’s price level. What
gives a country power is the fact that it’s not trying to ﬁx exchange
rates, not the fact that it’s a big part of the world economy.5</p>
<p>International Reserves</p>
<p>Now let us turn to a more complex model, in which one country is an
issuer of international reserves, which means that other countries’ gov-
ernments may choose to hold inventories of the issuer’s currency. The
country issuing international reserves is the “issuer,” or the
“reserve</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>currency country.</p>
<p>The issuer may be either a target country or a home country. The fact
that its currency is held by other countries gives it no more power to
control money supplies and price levels than it had before. If it is a
target country, it already had that power. If it is a home country, it
has no more power than it had before. It must sterilize ﬂows of reserves
across its borders if it is to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates.</p>
<p>In other words, a country does not gain any control over its own or
the world’s money stock by becoming an issuer of international
reserves.Thus, this model is in contrast to the literature on world
mone- tarism, where a reserve currency country is thought to have
additional control over the world money stock and price level.6</p>
<p>Any home country must sterilize ﬂows of reserves across its borders
if it is to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates. But a home country does have
the freedom to eliminate reserve ﬂows across its borders by holding
constant its inventory of international reserves. If there are no
reserve ﬂows, no sterilization will be needed.</p>
<p>No country gains any control over its money supply, price level, or
exchange rates by becoming a holder of international reserves. A target
country controls money supplies and price levels already, and a home
country controls its exchange rate already. If a country becomes a
holder of international reserves, it loses interest on the currency it
holds, which shows up as seigniorage gains to the issuer.</p>
<p>Thus, no country gains by holding international reserves, and every
country other than the issuer loses by the amount of the interest
sacriﬁced on its inventory of reserves. So it seems natural for
every</p>
<p>country to set its holdings of international reserves at zero. That
leads back to the simple model discussed above.</p>
<p>Whether international reserves are held or not, the important
distinction is between target country and home country, rather than
between large country and small country or between issuer and holder of
international reserves.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Neither of the models explored in this chapter is an accurate
descrip- tion of the way the international economy has worked or could
work, because their assumptions just aren’t realistic. My main objective
has been to show some of the changes that need to be made in existing
models of global monetarism if they are to be applied to a world of ﬁxed
exchange rates with national currencies only.</p>
<p>I expect, however, that some of the features of these models will be
maintained when the assumptions are relaxed to make the models more
realistic.The following may continue to be true:</p>
<p>• Intervention is not needed to ﬁx exchange rates; monetary policy
alone is enough. Monetary policy is ineffective for any other pur- pose
in a country that is actively ﬁxing exchange rates, so it might as well
be used as a substitute for intervention.</p>
<p>• International reserves are not needed to ﬁx exchange rates.A coun-
try can use monetary policy or it can use international reserves for
intervention, combined with a policy of exchanging capital or bonds for
reserves to keep inventories of international reserves near zero.Thus,
reserve ﬂows will never force devaluation or revaluation of a
currency.</p>
<p>• The kind of country that has the power to control money supp- lies
and price levels when exchange rates are ﬁxed is the target country, a
country not active in ﬁxing exchange rates. A 10 per- cent increase in
the target country’s money stock means a 10 percent increase in the
world price level. The size of the target country and whether it is an
issuer of international reserves do not</p>
<p>matter.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The term “global monetarism” is used in a comprehensive survey of
the rele- vant literature by Whitman (1975, pp. 491–536). See also
Frenkel and Johnson (1976). Another survey of the theory is provided by
Kemp (1975, pp. 14–22). Perhaps the best-known paper on “the monetary
approach to the balance of payments,” which has appeared in several
versions, is Johnson’s (1972, pp. 1555–72). The basic theory is restated
by Swoboda (1973, pp. 136–54). The theoretical framework used in these
two papers was developed in part by Mundell (1971).</p></li>
<li><p>For example, Whitman (1975, p. 523) says that the US can control
its own money stock because of its size; Courchene (1973, p. 70) says
that a coun- try large enough to have some impact on world prices can
inﬂuence both domestic and world money stocks; Frenkel and Johnson
(1976, pp. 21–45) say that a country’s control over the world money
stock depends on its size (p. 26); and Humphrey (1976, pp. 13–22) says
that a country’s control over its own money stock depends on its
size.</p></li>
<li><p>Johnson (1973, pp. 181–6) makes this point in a context involving
both mon- etary and ﬁscal policy instruments.</p></li>
<li><p>Whitman (1975, p. 494) says that one of the propositions of
global monetar- ism is this: “Any exercise of monetary policy to change
the domestic com- ponent ofthe monetary base will, under ﬁxed exchange
rates, be offset by an equal and opposite change in the foreign
component of that base.” Frenkel and Johnson (1976, p. 6) say, “Under a
ﬁxed exchange rate the supply of money in any country is
endogenous.”</p></li>
<li><p>This contrasts with the literature on global monetarism cited in
note 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Whitman (1975, p. 524) says that the United States can control
its own money stock partly because it is a reserve currency country.
Frenkel and Johnson (1976, p. 26) make the same point about a country
whose national money is internationally acceptable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This entire chapter was written under the assumption that active
monetary policy is possible. I didn’t and don’t believe it is possible.
I was simply trying to show some of the contradictions in a particular
kind of monetarism.</p>
