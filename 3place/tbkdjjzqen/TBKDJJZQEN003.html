<p>of the time; in particular, they generally assume that the labor
market is al- ways in equilibrium. Keynesian theories are those that
assume that many markets are in disequilibrium much of the time; in
addition to the labor market, they generally assume that ﬁnancial
markets and markets for capi- tal goods are often in disequilibrium. In
this chapter, we will be interested in the extent to which a theory
assumes that markets are in equilibrium,</p>
<p>Reprinted with permission from The Journal of Finance, Vol. XXVII,
No. 4, September, 1972.</p>
<p>rather than in the intellectual tradition of the theory, so we will
classify theories as“equilibrium theories” or“disequilibrium
theories.”We will be interested in dynamic theories, which describe the
development of prices, stocks, and ﬂows of goods and services over time,
rather than in static the- ories, which describe the impact of events
such as a one-time change in tastes, technology, or government
policy.</p>
<p>Let us deﬁne an equilibrium theory as one in which all markets are in
continual equilibrium; in which there are never excess demands or excess
supplies of any assets, goods, or services; and in which expectations of
future prices and quantities are formed in a rational manner. This last
condition is often violated; many theories, for exam- ple, assume that
individuals maintain expectations of the rates of change of prices in
the future that are consistently higher (or lower) than actual past
rates of change of prices.</p>
<p>Disequilibrium theories tend to be unsatisfactory because they are
inconsistent with the assumptions that individuals act to maxi- mize
utility and that firms act to maximize profits. A disequilibrium theory
will generally give an individual or firm that is familiar with the
theory the ability to make profits from this knowledge, either by
trading in financial markets or by operating businesses in real markets.
However, the exploitation of these profit opportuni- ties will tend to
eliminate them; thus such a theory contains the seeds of its own
destruction. A disequilibrium theory is unlikely to be a stable
description of the economy for any significant length of time.</p>
<p>Some disequilibrium theories are said to be consistent with maxi-
mizing behavior by individuals and ﬁrms because of the presence of
speciﬁc market imperfections, such as transactions costs in securities
markets, marketing costs in product markets, and job information costs
in labor markets. (For example, see Foley, 1970 and Alchian, 1970.) In
most aggregate theories, however, there is no attempt to rationalize
their disequilibrium properties, and the departures from equilibrium
consistent with these theories are generally too large to be explained
by these kinds of market imperfections.</p>
<p>Gordon and Hynes (1970) have made this point speciﬁcally for theories
that attempt to assign a role to monetary policy in determining
unemployment in the labor markets. They note that these theories</p>
<p>Active and Passive Monetary Policy in a Neoclassical Model 25</p>
<p>imply not only that individuals are ignorant, but also that they are
unable to learn by experience.</p>
<p>Many dynamic theories make use of a device that was stated for- mally
by Samuelson 〔1947, p. 263, eq. (11)〕. He wrote:</p>
<p>(2.1)</p>
<p>In this equation, D and S are the demand for and supply of a single
commodity,p is its price, α is a shift parameter, and H is a constant
rep- resenting the speed of adjustment of the price. It says that the
price of a commodity rises when there is excess demand and falls when
there is excess supply.The instantaneous rate at which the price rises
is propor- tional to the magnitude of the excess demand.</p>
<p>Equation (2.1) is clearly a disequilibrium equation, since it assumes
that the demand for the commodity can differ substantially from the
supply for an indeﬁnite period of time, especially if the shift param-
eter is continually changing.Any theory that makes use of a device like
equation (2.1), as Gordon and Hynes have pointed out, is a disequilib-
rium theory.</p>
<p>Many other dynamic theories make use of a similar device, intro-
duced by Cagan (1956), that makes the expected rate of change of a price
depend on the lagged past rates of change of the same price. His
equation is 〔1956, p. 37, eq. (5)〕:</p>
<p>(2.2)</p>
<p>In this equation, Ct and Et are the actual and expected rates of
change of prices at time t and β is a constant that determines the speed
of adjustment of expected to actual rates of change of prices. (The rate
of change of prices is the time derivative of the log of the price
level.)</p>
<p>As Muth (1961) has pointed out, unless the rate of change of prices
is changing in a very special (and random) manner, equation (2.2)
represents an irrational process for the adjustment of expectations. It
implies that Et can be consistently higher (or lower) than Ct for long
periods of time, even when Ct is constant. Thus any theory that uses a
device similar to equation (2.2), unless it generates Ct by a particular
random process, will be a disequilibrium theory.</p>
<p>Cagan was trying to explain hyperinﬂation, which may well be a
disequilibrium phenomenon. But other writers have used the idea of a lag
in expectations to explain a wide variety of economic phenomena. For
example, the quantity theory of money, when stated as a dynamic theory,
usually makes use of this device: Friedman (1969, p. 41) states ﬂatly,
“we know that it takes a long time for people fully to adjust their
anticipations to experience,” and then proceeds to introduce an expected
rate of price change that differs from the actual rate of price change.
His desire to do this is understandable, since Cagan points out that a
dynamic quantity theory in which the expected and actual rates of price
change are equal will give rise to an explosively rising or fall- ing
price level. It appears that the quantity theory cannot be stated as a
dynamic equilibrium theory.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of this chapter is to develop an aggregate model
of the development over time of an economy that includes money and that
is in continual equilibrium in the sense described above. Such a model
would help in the analysis of the properties of a competitive monetary
economy, and would be a logical starting point for the analysis of such
phenomena as unemployment and changes in the rate of inﬂation. Since
most Keynesian models of the economy do not pretend to be equilibrium
models, let us turn to the neoclassical models of economic growth.</p>
<p>Growth Models</p>
<p>Solow’s model of economic growth (1956) has a single commodity that
serves as both a production good and a consumption good, and assumes a
production function involving both capital and labor, with constant
returns to scale and diminishing marginal rates of substitution of capi-
tal for labor. He shows that under rather weak conditions, the econ- omy
will converge to a steady state growth path in which the stock of
capital is growing at the same rate as the population. The equilibrium
per-capita stock of capital will be independent of the initial
per-capita stock of capital, within limits. He assumes that aggregate
consump- tion is independent of the stock of capital, and that saving is
a constant fraction of output, so in the special case in which the
population is</p>
<p>constant, per-capita wealth does not converge to an equilibrium
value, but grows indeﬁnitely. If he had used a more general consumption
function, then the growth features of his model would not have been very
important, and we could view it as a basic aggregate model of an economy
in which all markets are in continual equilibrium.</p>
<p>The Solow model, however, has neither money nor a government sector,
so it is not possible to explore the effects of ﬁscal and monetary
policy on the real variables of the economy or on the price level. The
ﬁrst attempts to introduce money into a growth model are made by Tobin
(1965) and Johnson (1969). Both Tobin and Johnson assume that money is a
liability of the government, that the government controls the quantity
of money, that the quantity of money may inﬂuence the price level, and
that an individual’s savings will be allocated between capital and
money. They assume that the government does not have any liabili- ties
other than money, so there is no distinction between monetary and ﬁscal
policy in their models. Under these assumptions, they show that
government policy does inﬂuence the equilibrium value of per-capita
capital, and thus the equilibrium wage and the equilibrium level of per-
capita output. Neither of these models, however, develops the dynamics
of the response of the economy to changes in government policy.</p>
<p>Diamond (1965) develops a dynamic growth model that avoids Solow’s
assumption that saving is a constant fraction of output by deriv- ing
saving behavior from individual utility functions. He introduces
interest-bearing government debt, and shows that the effects found by
Tobin and Johnson are present when the government’s liabilities are
bonds rather than money. Diamond’s model, then, successfully intro-
duces ﬁscal policy into a growth model, and shows that the original
Tobin and Johnson monetary growth models cannot be regarded as
demonstrating anything about the effects of monetary policy as distinct
from ﬁscal policy.</p>
<p>Tobin (1968) then reﬁnes his theory, to try to distinguish between
the effects of monetary and non-monetary government liabilities, but
continues to assume that the government issues only one type of liabil-
ity. He does introduce dynamics explicitly into his model, but makes the
arbitrary assumption that the rate of change of price is equal to the
rate of growth of the money supply. He does not even mention the
potential for instability in the price level that he noted in his
earlier paper (1965).</p>
<p>Sidrauski (1967) is perhaps the ﬁrst to introduce dynamics explicitly
into a monetary growth model. He continues to use a model in which money
is the only government liability, but he uses Diamond’s device of
deriving aggregate saving behavior from individual utility functions,
thus avoiding the lack of a steady state in a society with zero
population growth. He ﬁnds that his model is unstable if he assumes that
individu- als know the current rate of inﬂation at all times, so he
introduces a lag in expectations similar to that expressed in equation
(2.2).Thus his dynamic model is not an equilibrium model.</p>
<p>Foley, Shell, and Sidrauski (1969) develop a dynamic two-sector
growth model that has both monetary and non-monetary government
liabilities, and thus has room for both ﬁscal and monetary government
policy. They assume, however, that the government uses a mix of ﬁscal
and monetary policy that is consistent with stable prices. They do not
explore the possibility of instability if the government should deviate
from a policy consistent with stable prices.</p>
<p>Foley and Sidrauski (1970) develop a more general dynamic two-sector
growth model that allows the rate of inﬂation to change over time as a
result of changes in government policy. To make their model stable,
however, they are forced to introduce a lag in expectations like that in
equation (2.2). Thus their model is not an equilibrium model.</p>
<p>Active and Passive Monetary Policy</p>
<p>None of the models mentioned above is the kind of model we are
looking for: a stable dynamic growth model that assumes that all markets
are in continual equilibrium, that expectations are formed rationally,
and that the government can inﬂuence the economy through both ﬁscal and
monetary policy.The fact that such a model has not been developed
suggests that there is some fundamental difﬁculty involved. In fact, it
appears that there can be no stable dynamic model of the economy that
allows the government to use ﬁscal and monetary policy
independently.</p>
<p>Olivera (1970, 1971) suggests a solution to this problem. He shows
that a monetary growth model in which expectations are formed rationally
and the money supply is given exogenously will be unstable,</p>
<p>and shows that if the price level is given exogenously and the money
supply is determined endogenously, the model will almost always be
stable. A model in which the money supply is given exogenously can be
said to allow “active monetary policy,” while a model in which the price
level is given exogenously can be said to require “passive mon- etary
policy.”</p>
<p>Foley, Shell, and Sidrauski are assuming that the government follows
a passive monetary policy when they say that it chooses a mix of ﬁscal
and monetary policy that ensures a stable price level. Foley and
Sidrauski also consider the case in which the government chooses a
policy mix that ensures a stable price level. Both papers show that
under these conditions, the economy is stable for a wide variety of
initial conditions.</p>
<p>The Olivera model is limited, because it assumes that money is the
only type of government liability. So it is not possible to explore the
independence of monetary and ﬁscal policy. The other two models allow
the government to issue either bonds or money, but they are
unnecessarily complex because they are two-sector models. Let us develop
here a simple one-sector monetary growth model that allows the
government to issue both bonds and money, but assumes that expec-
tations are always formed rationally.</p>
<p>We will assume constant returns to scale, so all quantities will be
written on a per-capita basis. Capital is k, and output is f(k). The
real interest rate r is equal to the marginal product of capital, so we
have:</p>
<p>r =f’(k). (2.3)</p>
<p>The rate of inﬂation π is equal to the fractional rate of change in
the price level:</p>
<p>π = p./p. (2.4)</p>
<p>We will assume that both the price level and the rate of inﬂation
change continuously over time, and that the expected rate of inﬂation is
always equal to the actual rate of inﬂation.1 The nominal interest rate
i will then be equal to the real interest rate plus the rate
ofinﬂation.</p>
<p>i = r + π . (2.5)</p>
<p>Nominal government liabilities g are divided between bonds b and
money m.</p>
<p>g = b + m. (2.6)</p>
<p>We will assume that the bonds are very short in maturity, so that the
nominal value of a bond remains constant while the interest rate varies.
We will assume that bonds and capital are perfect substitutes in
individuals’ asset portfolios, so the nominal interest rate on bonds
will be equal to the nominal interest rate on capital. Individuals are
allowed to issue bonds, so b is the net quantity of bonds
outstanding.</p>
<p>The government will be assumed to follow a constant balanced- budget
ﬁscal policy, so the nominal quantity of government liabilities g does
not change over time. The division of government liabilities between
bonds and money may change, however.</p>
<p>Per-capita real wealth a, from the point of view of the individual,
is the sum of capital and the real quantity of government
liabilities.</p>
<p>a = k + g/p. (2.7)</p>
<p>We will use an aggregate per-capita consumption function c(a) that
depends only on wealth. The phenomena that we will be investigating do
not depend on the exact functional form of the consumption func- tion.
We could include output or disposable income or labor income, real money
balances, the interest rate, and the rate of inﬂation without changing
the analysis in any signiﬁcant way. We will also assume that the
population is stable.Thus the rate of change in the supply of capital is
simply output minus consumption.</p>
<ol start="11" type="a">
<li>=f(k) — c ( k + g/p ). (2.8)</li>
</ol>
<p>If the price level is constant, this economy will have a steady-state
stock of capital deﬁned by:</p>
<p>f( k ) = c( k + g/p). (2.9)</p>
<p>The individual’s assets consist of capital, bonds, and money. Capital
and bonds are perfect substitutes, so the only decision he has to make
is how to divide his wealth between bonds and money.We will assume</p>
<p>that money bears no interest. We will write the aggregate per-capita
demand for real money balances L (a, r, π ) as a function of wealth, the
real interest rate, and the rate ofinﬂation.When the market for real
bal- ances is in equilibrium, we have:</p>
<p>m/p = L (k + g/p, r, π). (2.10)</p>
<p>The rate of consumption will be assumed to increase with wealth.</p>
<p>(2.11)</p>
<p>The elasticity of the demand for money with respect to wealth will be
assumed to be between zero and one.2 An increment to wealth is divided
between money and other assets in a ratio less than the existing ratio
of money to other assets.</p>
<p>(2.12)</p>
<p>An increase in either r or π means an increase in the nominal inter-
est rate, and thus a shift of wealth from money to capital or bonds.</p>
<p>(2.13)</p>
<p>If we assume that the money supply is given exogenously, and that the
price level is determined endogenously, then this economy is glo- bally
unstable. There are steady-state paths for the economy, in which the
money supply, the price level, and the stock of capital are constant,
but if the economy is disturbed from such a steady-state path, or if it
starts from a position not on a steady-state path, the price level will
eventually either rise at a continually accelerating rate or fall at a
con- tinually accelerating rate.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that the economy is on a steady-state path with
all variables constant in time, and that there is a shift in demand that
requires a positive rate of inﬂation to satisfy equation (2.10). Then
the price level will start to rise, which will cause the real money
supply to fall faster than the demand, which will accelerate the rate of
inﬂation. Meanwhile, the decline in real wealth will cause a decline in
consumption, an increase in the capital stock, and a decline in the
interest rate. Both the increase in the capital stock and the decline
in</p>
<p>the interest rate will increase the demand for money, causing π to
increase still faster to keep the demand for money equal to the supply.
These changes will continue in the same direction without limit.
Eventually the real value of government liabilities will become
negligible relative to the capital stock, and the capital stock will
gradually approach a maximum value. But the price level will continue to
accelerate upwards.</p>
<p>Similarly, if there is a shift in demand that gives π a negative
value initially, the price level will fall at an accelerating rate. In
this case, the increase in the real value of government liabilities will
cause capital to be consumed continuously, and will cause a continuing
increase in the real interest rate. While the rate of deﬂation can never
be greater than the real interest rate, the real interest rate is
increasing continuously, so the rate of deﬂation can increase
continuously as well.</p>
<p>It can be shown that if the money supply is held constant, any ini-
tial values of p and k other than steady-state values will lead
eventually to runaway inﬂation or runaway deﬂation. So the system is
globally unstable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose that we assume that the time path of the
price level is given exogenously, and that the money supply is
determined endogenously. Then there is no possible source of instabil-
ity in the economy. Equations (2.8) and (2.10) will determine the time
path of the capital stock and the money supply in a straightforward
manner. If the price level increases over time, the capital stock will
increase, but the changes that occur will be orderly and stable.</p>
<p>Taking the money supply as exogenous is unsatisfactory for rea- sons
other than the instability that results. Note that an increase in the
nominal money supply in equation (2.10) will be consistent with an
accelerating deﬂation, rather than with an increase in the price level.
Thus equation (2.10) is completely inconsistent with the usual eco-
nomic logic describing the effects of monetary policy on the
economy.</p>
<p>Also, it is not even clear how an active monetary policy can be
imple- mented in this economy. A passive monetary policy can be
implemented easily: the government simply agrees to exchange money for
bonds, or bonds for money, on demand.This will not cause the public to
exchange all of its bonds for money because money bears no interest.The
amount of money that the public will choose to hold is given by equation
(2.10).</p>
<p>Since bonds are very short-term instruments, the public in effect has
a savings account with the government. The government can</p>
<p>control the money supply only by refusing to accept a deposit of
money from the public, or by refusing to redeem its bonds in money. Both
of these acts are inconsistent with continual equilibrium in the money
and bond markets. Note that the government cannot increase the money
supply simply by making transfer payments in money, because the public
will react to this by returning the money to the gov- ernment in
exchange for bonds, unless such exchanges are prohibited.</p>
<p>There is, of course, an active monetary policy that would respond to
all disturbances in the economy in a way that is consistent with price
stability. But the required policy is an odd one and is a difﬁcult one
to follow.When inﬂation appears, the money supply must ﬁrst be increased
and must later be decreased. If the required policy is not followed
exactly, the inﬂation will either accelerate or turn into an
accelerating deﬂation. A constant money supply is not consistent with
price stability, nor is a money supply growing at a constant rate.There
is no simple rule of thumb for the management of the money supply that
is consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>These features continue to hold if we allow the government to have an
active ﬁscal policy.We can allow the government to buy goods either for
public consumption or for investment, and we can allow it to ﬁnance its
purchases through either taxes or an increase in outstanding govern-
ment liabilities.These choices can be made arbitrarily, but once they
are made, there is no opportunity for an active monetary policy. The
model continues to give an accelerating inﬂation or deﬂation if the
money supply is chosen exogenously; it continues to have the property
that an increase in the rate of growth of the money supply is associated
with more rapid deﬂation rather than more rapid inﬂation; and it
continues to require that the government destroy equilibrium in the
money and bond markets in order to implement its monetary policy.3</p>
<p>Also, while the model outlined above, with or without added features,
has an algebraic solution, it is very difﬁcult to imagine an economic
process that will cause changes in the money supply, or in the rate of
growth of the money supply, to lead to changes in the rate ofinﬂation,
if we continue to insist on continual equilibrium in all markets.The
usual argument is that an increase in the money supply causes
individuals to bid up the prices of long-term bonds, causing an increase
in the price level or the rate of inﬂation, and causing ﬁrms to borrow
for investment and thus to bid up the prices of investment goods. This
model makes it</p>
<p>clear that this “quantity theory” argument is inconsistent with
dynamic equilibrium. Individuals can reduce their money holdings by
exchanging them for bonds.And since the bonds are short-term
instruments, such an exchange will have no effect on the interest rate.
There is no reason for individuals to try to bid up the prices of
consumer goods.</p>
<p>It is clear that the government has no direct control over the inter-
est rate in this model, so it cannot implement monetary policy by
changing the interest rate.The real rate is equal to the marginal
product of capital, which is determined by the capital stock. The
nominal rate is equal to the real rate plus the rate of inﬂation, and
the government certainly has no direct control over the rate of
inﬂation. Thus there is no way for the government to control the nominal
interest rate.</p>
<p>This lack of a mechanism by which monetary policy can affect the
price level has been pointed out by others. For example, Chow (1970), in
a review of Friedman’s The Optimum Quantity of Money and Other Essays,
points out that Friedman has nowhere given an adequate expla- nation of
the mechanism that links the quantity of money with other economic
variables. He also points out that Friedman has never explic- itly
formulated the dynamics ofthe quantity theory of money.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that one simple way out of these difﬁculties is
to introduce disequilibrium only in the labor market, by assuming a
nominal wage rate that is inﬂexible downward. Unfortunately, this will
not help. If price deﬂation causes unemployment, then output will fall,
and the rate of consumption of capital will increase.This will only
accelerate the deﬂation in the model described above. And the case of
runaway inﬂation will not be affected at all by a wage rate that is
inﬂexible downward. Even if the possibility of unemployment would make
the system mathematically stable, we would still have the problem of
describing an economic process by which an increase in the rate of
growth of the money supply can lead to deﬂation, as required by the
model.</p>
<p>To make the model mathematically stable, given an exogenous money
supply, it is necessary to introduce consistent disequilibrium in the
goods market or in the bond and money markets, or to assume consistent
stupidity in the form of a lag in expectations.These assump- tions are
very hard to accept, because they imply proﬁt opportunities for ﬁrms and
individuals that are not exploited.</p>
<p>Previous writers on monetary growth models have emphasized the
question of whether monetary policy can have short-run or long- run
effects on the real sector, or whether it affects only the price level.
If the simple model described above could be interpreted as allowing
active monetary policy, it would say that monetary policy is not
neutral, because it affects the capital stock, output, and consumption
in both the short run and the long run. But there does not appear to be
any way to interpret the model as allowing the money supply to be
determined exogenously, so it seems to say that monetary policy can
affect neither the real sector nor the price level.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that in a neoclassical model in which individuals act
to maximize utility and ﬁrms act to maximize proﬁts, there is no room
for an active monetary policy that determines the money supply
exogenously. The only consistent monetary policy is a passive one, in
which the price level is taken as exogenous, and the money supply is
determined endogenously.</p>
<p>Passive Monetary Policy and the Price Level</p>
<p>The idea of an exogenous price level is unusual and is simply an
indication that the model is incomplete. If monetary policy does not
determine the price level, what does?</p>
<p>In the simple model described above, there are not many variables
that could inﬂuence the price level.The capital stock is one variable,
and it determines output and the real interest rate.The real stock of
govern- ment liabilities is another variable, and it (together with the
capital stock) determines consumption.To determine the price level
endogenously, we might add an equation that expresses the rate
ofinﬂation as a function of the capital stock and the real stock of
government liabilities.The depend- ent variable is the rate ofinﬂation
rather than the price level itself, so that the price level will change
in a continuous manner over time.4</p>
<p>π = h(k, g/p). (2.14)</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of functions h that can be chosen so that the
price level will not go into accelerating inﬂation or deﬂation. In</p>
<p>particular, any function that is bounded both above and below will be
consistent with stability.</p>
<p>In a more general model, there would be other variables that might
inﬂuence the price level, such as the rate of government expendi- ture,
and the size of the government’s budget deﬁcit. In a multi-sector model,
discoveries of natural resources or inventions might affect the price
level. In a model allowing unemployment, the level ofunemploy- ment
might affect the price level.Thus it is perfectly possible to model the
inﬂations associated with wars and discoveries of gold, and the
deﬂations associated with rapid technological progress and depressions,
without assuming an active monetary policy.</p>
<p>In any more general model of dynamic equilibrium that includes money
and a continuous price level along the lines suggested by the model
outlined above, there is likely to be an association between the money
stock and the price level, even though both variables may be taken as
endogenous to the model. An increase in prices causes an increase in the
nominal values of wealth, output, disposable income, and consumption, so
the demand for money will increase when the price level increases. If
monetary policy is passive, the supply of money will increase with the
demand.Thus a correlation between the money stock and the price level
need not be interpreted as Friedman and Schwartz (1963) interpret it as
evidence of the effectiveness of an active mon- etary policy. Krooss
(1964) claims that the more natural interpretation of the evidence
presented by Friedman and Schwartz, at least in many cases, is that the
money supply is a passive rather than an active variable.</p>
<p>Some writers have said that if the government allows the supply of
money to expand freely to meet the demand, there will be no equilib-
rium price level, and prices will increase continuously. But the model
outlined above suggests that there is not only one, but many equilib-
rium price levels consistent with a passive monetary policy.The model
does not suggest any mechanism that would cause a passive monetary
policy to lead to unbounded inﬂation.</p>
<p>Banking and Inside Money</p>
<p>The model we have described assumes that there are two kinds of
ﬁnancial assets: bonds and money. In our description of the model,
we</p>
<p>said that the money was a liability of the government, while the
bonds were issued by individuals as well as by the government. The model
does not change in any way, however, if we assume that the money is
issued by a banking sector rather than by the government and thus is
“inside money” as characterized by Gurley and Shaw (1960).</p>
<p>We can assume that all money is inside money, which takes the form of
both demand deposits (which bear no interest) and currency. The currency
would then be in the form of bank notes and privately minted coins. We
can assume that a bank is required to hold govern- ment bonds equal to
100 percent of the value of its demand deposits and currency
outstanding. Now all government liabilities will be in the form of
bonds.</p>
<p>The analysis made in previous sections is not changed in any way by
these assumptions. The production and consumption functions remain the
same, and the demand function for money is unchanged. If a passive
monetary policy is adopted, the banks can be allowed to cre- ate money
freely to satisfy the demand. If the public has more money than it
wants, it will simply give it to the banks in exchange for gov- ernment
bonds or private bonds (time deposits) issued by the banks. If the
public has too little money, it will exchange government or private
bonds for bank money. There will be nothing to cause pressure of any
kind on the price level by the use of a passive monetary policy.</p>
<p>An active monetary policy, however, is so inconsistent with equi-
librium that it is difﬁcult to see how it could be implemented in an
inside money economy. Would the government assign money quo- tas to
individual banks? Would a bank lose the quota associated with a deposit
that is transferred to another bank? Would banks refuse to exchange
money for bonds when this would mean exceeding their quotas?</p>
<p>To try to salvage the notion of active monetary policy under dynamic
equilibrium, let us turn to an economy with both outside money and
inside money, and let us assume that the government controls the supply
of outside money. Let us assume that the outside money is used as
currency, and that the bank is required to hold outside money equal to a
certain percentage of the value of its demand deposits, and is required
to hold government bonds equal to the remainder of the value of its
demand deposits.</p>
<p>We now have all the same problems that we had in previous mod- els.
The only way the government can control the supply of outside money is
to refuse to exchange money and bonds freely, which implies lack of
equilibrium in the money and bond markets. If there is too much outside
money outstanding, as Gramley and Chase (1965) have pointed out, the
public will not hold it, so it will become unwanted free reserves held
by the banks. This is again inconsistent with equi- librium in the
outside money market. Eventually, the banks will refuse to accept
outside money in exchange for bonds or time deposits, and it will tend
to lose its status as a means of payment. Similarly, if there is too
little outside money outstanding, the banks will have to ration their
demand deposits, and will be reluctant to exchange outside money for
bonds, time deposits, or demand deposits. Since both inside and outside
money will be in short supply, individuals will be reluctant to use it
in paying for goods and services, and will tend to use some form of
credit instead.Again, money will tend to lose its status as a means of
payment.</p>
<p>Note that even in a system with both inside and outside money, there
is no mechanism for changes in the money supply to cause changes in the
price level. Nor is there any way consistent with market equilibrium for
the banks to issue more or less money than the public wants to hold. In
the model discussed here, this is particularly easy to see, since the
banks do not make loans.They cannot try to expand the money supply by
making loans at low interest rates, and they cannot try to expand the
money supply by buying long-term government bonds.</p>
<p>Even in an equilibrium model in which the banks do hold loans and
long-term bonds, however, the money supply is still not under the
control of the banks or the government. If a bank issues money to make a
loan to one person, and that money is more than the public wants to hold
at equilibrium interest rates, then it will simply be used to pay off
another loan, at the same bank or at another bank. And if a bank issues
extra money to buy long-term government bonds, that money will simply be
deposited in a time deposit, or used to buy gov- ernment bonds at the
next auction. So long as the public can exchange money for
interest-bearing assets and liabilities, there is no reason to believe
that the government’s or the banks’ attempts to control the money supply
will result in changes in aggregate consumption, aggre- gate income, or
the price level in an equilibrium model.</p>
<p>Policy Implications</p>
<p>This analysis raises the question of whether monetary policy as prac-
ticed in the United States is truly active or not. Since the Federal
Reserve tends to rely heavily on “net free reserves” in determining its
policy, it is possible that it acts primarily in a passive mode, absorb-
ing reserves when net free reserves get too large. The fact that it
allows banks to borrow reserves at all tends to make its control over
the money supply more passive than active. While many writers have
acknowledged these slippages, they have maintained that Federal Reserve
policy does have some independent effect on the economy. The fact that
any active monetary policy at all may be inconsistent with equilibrium,
however, makes one wonder whether Federal Reserve policy has any
inﬂuence on the economy at all.</p>
<p>The analysis also raises the question of what would happen if the
government adopted an openly passive monetary policy. What if the
government abolished interest rate ceilings and reserve requirements and
offered to exchange currency and reserves freely for government bonds?
What if it abandoned attempts to control entry into banking and the
terms on which banks can accept deposits? Would there be widespread bank
failures? Would there be an accelerating inﬂation? Would the economy
become less stable?</p>
<p>I have given a set of possible answers to these questions in Chap-
ter 1.The model discussed here suggests that a passive monetary policy
would not introduce any instability into an economy that is continually
in equilibrium. I hope that other writers will attempt to show what will
happen in their models if a passive monetary policy is adopted. It seems
so elementary a question that it is surprising how little attention it
has received.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>We have explored the properties of a neoclassical model similar to
those used by growth theorists, including both money and bonds, with a
consumption function that depends on wealth.We have assumed that all
markets are continually in equilibrium, that expectations are formed</p>
<p>rationally, and that the price level moves continuously over time. We
have compared an active monetary policy, as represented by an exog-
enous money stock and an endogenous rate of inﬂation, with a passive
monetary policy, as represented by an exogenous rate of inﬂation and an
endogenous money stock.</p>
<p>We have found that active monetary policy makes little economic sense
in this model. There is no way for the government to imple- ment an
active monetary policy that is consistent with continual equilibrium in
the money and bond markets. If there were a way to implement an active
monetary policy, it would work perversely, with an increase in the money
stock being associated with a decrease in the rate of inﬂation. In
addition, the price level would be unstable, and the economy would
eventually go into accelerating inﬂation or deﬂation.</p>
<p>We have found that passive monetary policy is always consistent with
stability in this model and requires no sacriﬁce of its equilibrium
properties.</p>
<p>We have explored a number of possible changes in the model, including
changes in the form of the consumption function, the introduction of
inﬂexible wages, and the introduction of a banking sector. None of these
changes appears to make active monetary policy consistent with dynamic
equilibrium.</p>
<p>These conclusions cast doubt on the stability of the parameters of
models that include active monetary policy by allowing markets to be out
of equilibrium or by allowing expectations to be formed irration- ally.
If individuals and ﬁrms knew the properties of these models and acted to
maximize utility and proﬁts, then the models would stop being valid.</p>
<p>These results suggest that the properties of models that assume pas-
sive monetary policy need a great deal more study.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the price level can jump discontinuously from one level to
another, then the analysis becomes much more complex. It becomes
necessary to distinguish between anticipated changes in the money supply
and in the price level. There is no longer a unique correspondence
between paths for</li>
</ol>
<p>the price level (given an initial price level) and paths for the
money supply. There will be many paths for the price level consistent
with any given path for the money supply. The overall conclusions of
that analysis are similar to those in this chapter.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>This assumption makes the nature of the instability very simple
in a model that assumes the money supply is given exogenously. Allowing
the wealth elasticity of the demand for money to be one or greater will
only change the nature of the instability.</p></li>
<li><p>A rather thorough analysis of the instability of models in which
the money supply is chosen exogenously is given by Burmeister and Dobell
(1970, pp. 156–201).They conclude that changing the structure of the
model while preserving its equilibrium does not eliminate the
instability.</p></li>
<li><p>In a model in which the price level can change discontinuously,
the dependent variable can be taken to be the price level rather than
the rate of inﬂation.</p></li>
