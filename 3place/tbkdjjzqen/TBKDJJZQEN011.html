<p>The ABCs of</p>
<p>Business Cycles</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>usiness cycle peaks occur when there is a good match between the
types of skills or physical capital wanted in an economy and</p>
<p>the types of skills or physical capital available; conversely,
troughs</p>
<p>occur when wants and skills are poorly matched. The business cycle is
largely a matter of choice.That is, the level of business cycle
ﬂuctuations reﬂects the trade-offs people face between (A) expected
growth, (B) ﬂuctuations in output, and (C) unemployment.</p>
<p>The conventional explanations for ﬂuctuations in output and
unemployment all imply that there are unexploited proﬁt opportunities in
the world.They cannot hold true in an economy that is in continual
equilibrium, where people are constantly seeking proﬁt
opportunities.</p>

<p>A more rational explanation for business cycles may be found in
shifting demand and supply curves. Shifting tastes and shifting technol-
ogy lead to wage differentials between different sectors ofthe economy.
These will lead to unemployment as people move from low-wage sectors in
search of jobs in high-wage sectors. Unemployment in the form of job
layoffs—whether short-term or indeﬁnite—occurs when differentials exist
between current and future labor productivity.</p>
<p>The average severity of a society’s business cycles is largely a
matter of choice. If people chose to invest in sectors with both high
and low expected growth, the economy would be more diversiﬁed and
exhibit lower ﬂuctuations in output, but also lower growth, than it
would if peo- ple invested only or primarily in sectors with high
growth. Investments in sectors that do not move together will allow
greater diversiﬁcation, hence lower ﬂuctuations; but sectors that move
together will generate lower unemployment, since wage differentials will
be smaller.</p>
<p>In this sense, forecasts of business cycle movements will not help in
formulating countercyclical ﬁscal and monetary policies. The level of
business cycle ﬂuctuations we have is the level we want, given the
trade-offs people face between (A) expected growth, (B) ﬂuctuations in
output, and (C) unemployment.</p>
<p>Nor will predictions of business cycle movements help in predicting
stock price movements. On the other hand, stock market movements can be
used to predict business cycle movements. For example, large moves in
opposite directions in different sectors of the stock market should be
followed, normally, by an increase in unemployment.</p>
<p>People and ﬁrms are constantly seeking proﬁt opportunities and trying
to take advantage of the ones they ﬁnd. They try to buy low and sell
high.They try to make investments in business that will end up with a
value greater than cost.They look for high expected returns.</p>
<p>People also want to reduce risk. An investment that earns one
percentage point more than the interest rate (on average) will be
unattractive if it has as much risk as the market. People want three
things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>high expected return, 2. low risk, and</p></li>
<li><p>high value.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, they can’t generally have all the ABCs at once. There are
trade-offs. High expected return generally goes with high risk, or
with</p>
<p>The ABCs of Business Cycles 119</p>
<p>low value. When people are relatively averse to risk, they will
choose low risk and low expected return; when they are relatively
tolerant of risk, they will choose high risk and high expected
return.When peo- ple value the present more than the future, they will
choose high value and low expected return; when they value the future
more, they will choose low value and high expected return.</p>
<p>Looking for proﬁt opportunities is costly; so are the steps needed to
take advantage of proﬁt opportunities that are found. It’s costly to
convert a plant from producing something that’s in less demand to
producing something that’s in more demand. It’s costly for an individual
to leave one job in search of a job that pays more. It’s costly to
obtain government approval to undertake certain ventures. My economic
models include these costs, either explicitly or implicitly; I assume
that individuals and ﬁrms look for opportunities that are still
proﬁtable after these costs are taken into account.1</p>
<p>In my models, markets work. Prices and wages are generally free to
move, barring government interference. People and goods are free to
move, so long as the adjustment costs are paid. Investment decisions are
made rationally, though some investments may turn out badly. People make
mistakes, but they don’t make the same mistakes over and over.The
economy is in continual equilibrium.</p>
<p>What are Business Cycles?</p>
<p>Business cycles are ﬂuctuations in economic activity. Business cycles
show up in virtually all measures of economic activity—output, income,
employment, unemployment, retail sales, new orders by manu- facturers;
even housing starts. When times are good, they tend to be good all over;
and when times are bad, they tend to be bad all over. A particular
cycle’s tendency to affect many sectors and many measures of economic
activity in the same direction is called its diffusion; some cycles are
more diffuse than others, but there will be an average degree of
diffusion that depends on the structure of the economy.</p>
<p>Neither good times nor bad times last forever. On average, economic
conditions are neither good nor bad; they’re middling. Good times are
more likely to get worse than to get better; and bad times are more
likely to get better than to get worse.When economic conditions are
average,</p>
<p>we know only that they won’t stay average; at some time in the future
they’ll be good, and at some time in the future they’ll be bad. Of
course, in the background, we have normal economic growth: both peaks
and troughs tend to get higher over time.</p>
<p>A business cycle can be likened to a slow motion ﬁlm of a pebble
being washed down a sluice with a rough bottom. The motion of the pebble
is erratic, but it keeps returning to the center of the sluice, and it
keeps moving down. (Of course, for the business cycle, the ﬁlm would run
in reverse, because output tends to rise over time.)</p>
<p>The duration of the pebble’s swings will vary greatly.There will be
an average time from one swing to the next, but the actual time can
differ widely from the average, and the average can change as the
construction of the sluice changes. Similarly, business cycles will have
some average duration, but the typical cycle will differ greatly from
the average of many cycles.</p>
<p>The pebble in the reverse-motion ﬁlm swings up on both sides of its
path, while the business cycle swings up on one side and down on the
other side of its path. There will be an average height for the peb-
ble’s swings, as there is an average depth for business cycles. The
depth of a single cycle, though, will be subject to many random
inﬂuences. It’s likely to differ signiﬁcantly from the average business
cycle depth.</p>
<p>What happens if we speed up the ﬂow of water in the sluice? The
pebble will move more rapidly, and its movements will be more erratic.
It may even bounce right out of the sluice. As we will see, society can
choose business cycles that correspond to a wide range of water speeds:
business cycles with slow growth and small ﬂuctuations, or business
cycles with fast growth and large ﬂuctuations.The more tolerant of risk
the society’s typical person is, the faster the growth and the larger
the ﬂuctuations.</p>
<p>What Causes Business Cycles?</p>
<p>When they look at business cycles, economists seem more like priests
than scientists. Their theories differ for reasons that seem to be
largely historical or accidental. There seem to be few facts from which
one</p>
<p>can draw deﬁnite conclusions. We can classify the generally accepted
branches of the church as follows:</p>
<p>A ancient, or the Keynesian theories;</p>
<p>B before, or the monetary theories; and</p>
<p>C current, or the rational expectations theories.</p>
<p>The branches overlap a great deal. The Keynesian theories have mon-
etary elements; the monetary theories allow a role for ﬁscal policy; the
rational expectations theories are really cleaned-up monetary theories.
No amount of cleaning, though, can disguise the fact that all these the-
ories are disequilibrium theories. In every one, there is a way for
indi- viduals to proﬁt if the world works as the theory says it
does.</p>
<p>In Keynesian theories, the interest rate is allowed to differ from
the return on low-risk capital. But if that really happened, people
could take advantage of it on a massive scale. If the interest rate were
below the return on capital, almost everyone would want to borrow to buy
capital. If the interest rate were above the return on capital, almost
everyone owning capital would want to sell it and invest the proceeds in
loans earning the interest rate. Thus the interest rate must be equal to
the return on low-risk capital, and this feature of Keynesian theory
goes out the window.</p>
<p>Another feature of Keynesian theory that’s hard to accept is the
notion that people can be unemployed because wages stubbornly refuse to
fall when they should. If an individual were willing to work at a low
wage, it would be in her interest to let employers know this, and to
convince them that she’s as good as the next person. It would also be in
employers’ interest to seek out people who are willing to work at low
wages, and to offer to hire them or to lower the wages of workers they
already have. Since both parties would have an interest in curing
unemployment by letting wages fall, it’s hard to see how unemployment
due to sticky wages could arise in the ﬁrst place. Of course, there will
always be some unemployment due to union activity, minimum wages, and
unemployment beneﬁts, but these aren’t the causes of sticky wages the
Keynesians have in mind.</p>
<p>In monetary theories, the government can do good or evil through
monetary policy. It can cause recessions by using the wrong monetary</p>
<p>policy or cure them by using the right monetary policy. In the end,
mon- etarists often decide that attempts to cure recessions using
monetary policy are likely to make business cycles worse, so they
recommend a predictable monetary policy such as constant rate of growth
in the money stock.</p>
<p>Before the current crop of rational expectations theories, monetary
theories assumed, in effect, that the government could fool most of the
people most of the time.The older theories assumed, for example, that
the government could adopt a policy of increasing the rate of money
growth in response to signs of an impending recession. Individuals would
never ﬁgure the policy out, so they would always be surprised at the
higher rate of growth.They would increase their spending, and this
increased consumer spending would then make the recession milder than it
would have been. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>The rational expectations theories get around this problem. These
theories assume that individuals will ﬁgure out any government policy
that can be ﬁgured out. People will make errors, but they won’t make the
same error consistently. But rational expectations theories have
problems of their own. They assume that the primary cause of business
cycles is uncertainty about current monetary policy. When a person sees
demand for his output increase, he’s uncertain whether it’s a real
increase in demand or an increase that reﬂects the fact he hasn’t been
raising his prices to keep up with inﬂation. Just in case it’s a real
increase in demand, he will increase his output rate somewhat.</p>
<p>In rational expectations theories, an unexpected increase in the
money stock leads to an unexpected increase in the price level and a
jump in output. Similarly, an unexpected decline in the money stock
makes output go down. But if the real effects of random elements in
monetary policy were signiﬁcant, the government could simply announce
the cur- rent money stock frequently, and the business cycle would
mostly go away. Or, if the government refused to do that, some
enterprising soul would develop a way of reporting the current price
level with little delay and lit- tle error. She would proﬁt and so would
the rest ofus.</p>
<p>So much for the theories currently in vogue.All of them imply that
there are great proﬁt opportunities in the world.Anyone understanding
the theory would know how to take advantage of these opportunities. So
we can’t take seriously what they have to say about the causes of
business cycles.</p>
<p>In my theory, business cycles are caused in part by shifting tastes
and shifting technology—by shifting demand and supply curves. Labor
markets provide the simplest example.When demand for shoe machine
operators declines and demand for computer operators rises, peo- ple
will shift out of the ﬁrst group and into the second. Some people will
shift directly, but most of the shifts will be indirect. The people who
leave shoe machinery will not be the same as those who go into
computers. Some people will shift without a break in employment, but
some will be unemployed between jobs.The more shifting there is, the
more unemployment there will be.</p>
<p>If the world were static, people would settle into their jobs, and
employers would learn about their skills.There would be no reason for
employees to want to change jobs and no reason for employers to want
them to change. But there are continual changes in people’s tastes for
consumer goods and services and constant changes in the economy’s
ability to supply various combinations of goods and services.</p>
<p>Business cycle peaks occur when there is a good match between the
types of skills wanted and the types of skills available or between the
types of physical capital wanted and the types of physical capital
available. Business cycle troughs occur when there is a poor match
between wants and skills. The peaks and troughs occur within a path that
is itself subject to random inﬂuences; new discoveries may shift an
economy onto a higher path, while bad weather or war may shift it onto a
lower path. These random inﬂuences are not always large, either; an
accumulation of small shocks will have the same impact as one large
shock.</p>
<p>A mismatch will occur when investments in physical or human capital
do not pay off as expected or when actual wants turn out to differ from
expected wants. Something as simple as the decision to produce a new toy
is the raw material of the business cycle. If demand for the toy turns
out to be high, or if production costs turn out to be low, that will be
good for the economy. If demand for the toy turns out to be low, or if
production costs turn out to be high, that will be bad for the economy.
The accumulation of these correct and incorrect decisions creates the
business cycle. In this sense, the business cycle is due to
errors—errors in forecasting tastes or errors in forecasting technology.
But these are unavoidable errors; the investment decisions</p>
<p>made are the best ones possible in the light of the information
available when they are made.</p>
<p>Unemployment is voluntary in the sense that it is a shift from a
low-wage sector to a higher wage sector. It’s involuntary in the sense
that many people making this shift will wish they had made investments
earlier that would have put them into higher wage sectors. But at the
time they made them, their investments were correct.</p>
<p>Unemployment is not just job search. People who have been laid off
and are waiting for recall are also counted as unemployed. They are
unemployed because they are worth less to their employers now than they
probably will be in the future. They are not willing to work at a wage
that would be low enough to induce employers to keep them on the
job.</p>
<p>Inﬂation normally plays no role in this theory. The correct or
incorrect allocation of skills to sectors can occur at any rate of
inﬂation. Rapid advances (or retreats) in technology (or tastes) can
occur at any rate of inﬂation. The one exception is when inﬂation turns
negative—when it turns to substantial deﬂation, as it did in the 1930s.
Substantial deﬂation can make things worse.</p>
<p>What Caused the Great Depression?</p>
<p>According to my theory, we don’t fully know what caused the Great
Depression. Much ofit was due to a mismatch between wants and skills
that would be impossible to detail now because we don’t have enough
data. It was a great stroke of bad luck, wherein a number of factors
moved in the wrong way at the same time.</p>
<p>Part ofit was an across-the-board decline in technology. Productivity
in agriculture had declined, and reciprocal increases in tariffs reduced
the productivity of international trade. Part of it was a change in
tastes: we may have become less happy with what we could produce across
the board, and we may have shifted emphasis from one sector to another.
Unemployment rose as people shifted from sectors that were less in
demand to sectors that were more in demand and as people decided not to
work at all rather than to work at the extremely low wages justiﬁed by
their productivity in creating the things people wanted.</p>
<p>According to this explanation, as far as it goes, the Great
Depression was just like any other downturn, only worse.This may help to
explain why the price level started to decline. Once the deﬂation rate
became severe enough that short-term Treasury bill rates fell to zero,
another factor came into play—the currency trap.</p>
<p>Treasury bill rates can’t fall below zero because, if they were nega-
tive, people would hold currency instead of Treasury bills. If currency
did not exist, substantial deﬂation would result in negative interest
rates. Since currency does exist, substantial deﬂation results in zero
interest rates on Treasury bills and high positive real interest
rates.</p>
<p>How does the economy adjust to high real interest rates from this
source? I don’t know, but I do know that it will cause great
disruptions. Thus the currency trap made the Great Depression more than
just a severe recession.</p>
<p>Can We Stop the Business Cycle?</p>
<p>The business cycle is largely a matter of choice. An individual (at
least in a non-union job) can avoid being laid off by agreeing to work
at substantially less than the going wage for her skill level. She has a
lower wage but greater security, because other workers will be laid off
ﬁrst.</p>
<p>Similarly, society can avoid large ﬂuctuations in output by agreeing
to lower output and lower expected growth in output. Society can reduce
the level of unemployment by making job changes very expen- sive for the
individual and the ﬁrm or by subsidizing wages in low- wage sectors and
taxing wages in high-wage sectors.This, however, will reduce output and
expected growth.</p>
<p>More generally, the choices that the typical individual makes involve
the trade-offs discussed in the introduction.The individual wants:</p>
<p>A high expected growth in output,</p>
<p>B small ﬂuctuations in output, and</p>
<p>C low average unemployment.</p>
<p>Since these goals are generally incompatible, the individual must
strike a balance. Output ﬂuctuations and unemployment can be sharply
reduced, but only at the cost of lower expected growth in output.</p>
<p>Investments in sectors with both high and low expected growth will
allow greater diversiﬁcation, hence lower ﬂuctuations in output, than
investments in sectors with high growth only.That’s why there’s a
trade-off between expected growth and ﬂuctuations.</p>
<p>Investments in sectors that mayor may not move together will allow
greater diversiﬁcation, hence lower ﬂuctuations in output, than
investments in sectors that mostly move together. But sectors that move
together will generate lower unemployment, because wage differentials
will be smaller on average. When wages are high in one sector, they will
be high in most others, and we won’t have the movement between sectors
that generates unemployment. That’s why there’s a trade-off between
ﬂuctuations and unemployment.</p>
<p>Business cycles are the result of people balancing their interests in
A, B, and C. If they were to put less emphasis on A, and more emphasis
on B and C, business cycles would be less important. In that sense,
business cycles can be stopped. They aren’t stopped because people don’t
want them stopped.The price would be too high.</p>
<p>Can We Stimulate Growth?</p>
<p>The expected rate of growth of consumption is also a matter of
choice. An individual can have higher consumption in the future by
spend- ing less now and saving more. She can have higher expected growth
in consumption by investing in riskier assets or securities.</p>
<p>Similarly, society can increase the expected growth rate of output or
consumption by agreeing to less consumption now and greater uncertainty
in future consumption. Certain government policies can discourage
current consumption and encourage risk-taking; these policies will
increase the expected growth rate of consumption. But there is always a
price to pay for faster expected growth.</p>
<p>The choices that the typical individual must make will balance:</p>
<p>A high expected growth in consumption,</p>
<p>B small ﬂuctuations in consumption, and</p>
<p>C high current consumption.</p>
<p>Expected growth in consumption can be increased, but only if we
increase uncertainty about future consumption or reduce current</p>
<p>consumption. The current expected growth rate may well be optimal; in
that case, there is no reason to call for an increase in the growth
rate.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible that people are making unenlightened
choices, and that there are ways we don’t yet know about for improv- ing
A, B, and C at the same time. If those ways can be found, we will escape
the trade-offs we now face.</p>
<p>Also, it’s possible that government policies are distorting
individual choices in unnecessary ways. For example, it may be that a
change from a tax on income to a tax on spending could be done in a way
that would make most people much better off. This change would reduce
current consumption but increase the growth rate of consumption.</p>
<p>Can We Predict Business Cycle Movements?</p>
<p>If my model of business cycles is correct, then some aspects of
business cycle movements can be predicted with at least some accuracy.
Ifunem- ployment is unusually high, we can predict a decline; if it is
unusually low, we can predict a rise. If unemployment is unusually high,
we can predict faster than usual growth in output; if it is unusually
low, we can</p>
<p>predict slower than usual growth in output. These predictions will be
better than those that don’t take unemployment into account, but they
will still be wrong much of the time.</p>
<p>Forecasts like this are not apt to help in predicting stock market
movements because they make use of information that is widely avail-
able, hence already discounted. But we can reverse the procedure and use
stock market movements to help predict business cycle movements. Again,
the predictions will be far from perfect, since the stock market reﬂects
information about many things other than the immediate future of the
business cycle.They will, however, be better than predictions that don’t
use stock market information.</p>
<p>We could also use the behavior of individual sectors of the stock
market to predict unemployment. If my theory is correct, large moves in
opposite directions in different sectors should be followed, nor- mally,
by an increase in unemployment. If the coherence of different sectors of
the economy goes down over time, we might expect the average level of
unemployment to go up, because wage differentials will tend to
increase.</p>
<p>The sector-by-sector behavior of stocks is also useful in predicting
sector-by-sector changes in outputs, proﬁts, or investment.When stocks
in a given sector go up, more often than not that sector will show a
rise in sales, earnings, and outlays for plant and equipment. Again, the
resulting predictions are far from perfect, but they are better than
predictions that don’t make use of stock market data.</p>
<p>Forecasts of business cycle movements are helpful because they tell
us what to expect and allow us to adjust our budgets. If my theory is
correct, however, forecasts of business cycle movements are not helpful
as inputs to the formulation of countercyclical ﬁscal and monetary
policy. The level of business cycle ﬂuctations we have is the level we
want, given the trade-offs we face between (A) expected growth, (B)
ﬂuctuations, and (C) unemployment.</p>

<li>One way to seek proﬁt opportunities is via the government. Some
activities are normally and properly done by the government, and I
generally think of the government as the agent of people in carrying out
these activities. Defense is a good example. Governments may be
mistaken, but they are rarely malevolent, at least in this country.
Government employees may act in their own interest rather than in the
interest of the people, but there are ways of controlling them, just as
there are ways of controlling managers who don’t act in the interest of
a ﬁrm’s stockholders.</li>
