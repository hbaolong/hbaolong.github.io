<p>Ups and Downs</p>
<p>in Human Capital</p>
<p>and Business</p>
<p>W</p>
<p>e can think of a person’s human capital as his ability to earn money.
How much he will actually earn at various times in the future will
depend on what happens and on what he decides to do; but his human
capital sums up the value of the ways he has of turning effort into
income. We can almost think of the value of a person’s human capital as
the present value of his uncertain future income, just as we think of
the value of a stock as the present value of its uncertain future
dividends.All this leaves out is the effect on the person of the work he
has to do to get the income.</p>
<p>The value of a person’s human capital certainly ﬂuctuates over time.A
baby’s human capital, for example, changes after the doctor ﬁrst
examines him: if any serious defects are found, the value of the
baby’s</p>
<p>human capital goes down; and if everything seems all right, the value
of the baby’s human capital goes up.</p>
<p>For a time, a child’s human capital is closely tied to its parent’s
human capital. If a parent loses his job, the child’s human capital goes
down in value along with the parent’s. Later, the child is on his own.
He may work for a large company, though, and his human capital may go up
and down in value along with the company’s stock.When things look good
for the company, things look good for him. When things look bad for the
company, things look bad for him.</p>
<p>If just one company is affected, the person can look for a new job
with another company. But if all the companies that use his skills are
affected he will be affected too. An employee’s chances to earn money
are affected some by the fortunes of his company, some by the fortunes
of all the companies in the same business, and some by the fortunes
ofall the companies there are.</p>
<p>If we add together everybody’s human capital, we get the economy’s
human capital, or total human capital. Since each individual’s human
capital tends to go up and down with the prospects for the business he
is in, total human capital tends to go up and down with the prospects
for businesses generally.The best measure we have of the prospects for
busi- nesses generally is the stock market. So the value of total human
capital tends to go up and down with the level of the stock market.</p>
<p>This isn’t really very surprising. When the economy is booming,
things are good for business and jobs are easy to ﬁnd and keep. When the
economy is lagging, proﬁts are down, and overtime is cut, and people are
laid off, and lots of people don’t even bother to look for a job.When
times are good for business, times are good for labor; and when times
are bad for business, times are bad for labor.</p>
<p>It’s true, of course, that labor sometimes gains at the expense of
busi- ness, and that business sometimes gains at the expense of labor.
But each side is limited by strong economic forces. Ifa labor union
negotiates mag- niﬁcent increases in wages and beneﬁts, it may ﬁnd that
many of its mem- bers are unemployed, and that employers using non-union
labor get more business than employers in the same industry using union
labor. Some employers may even go out of business.</p>
<p>Generally, the factors that cause shifts between business and labor
are dwarfed by the factors that cause them to go up and down
together.The</p>
<p>Ups and Downs in Human Capital and Business 87</p>
<p>problems that business has at times cannot usually be blamed on the
suc- cess of labor, and the problems that labor has cannot usually be
blamed on the oppression of business.They both have problems at the same
time.And their problems stem, as we shall see, from the same
sources.</p>
<p>Capital and Labor</p>
<p>Even the simplest economic models suggest that human capital and
physical capital wax and wane together. The simplest models have peo-
ple working with machines to produce either more machines or other goods
and services that are in demand.The machines are called “capital,” the
people are called “labor,” and what they produce is called “output.”</p>
<p>If a person has more machines to work with, or better machines, then
he can produce more. If he can produce more, he can earn more. Thus the
more capital there is, the more people earn.The more physical capital
there is, the more the economy’s human capital is worth.</p>
<p>This means that investments in physical capital increase the value of
human capital. And it works the other way, too: if a person is better
educated, or learns more job-related skills, he can often produce more
with the same machine. So investments in human capital increase the
value of physical capital.</p>
<p>In fact, some economists argue that for many purposes there is no
reason to distinguish between different kinds of capital. We can not
only lump together machines, tools, real estate, and inventories; we can
also lump all these together with human capital.</p>
<p>Capital, thus summed up, ﬂuctuates in value even if we don’t put
anything in or take anything out. Its value also changes over time in a
way that depends on how fast we are spending on things other than new
capital. Faster spending means slower growth in capital, and slower
spending means faster growth in capital. Or, if the value of capital
would be declining anyway, faster spending means a faster decline, and
slower spending means a slower decline. The way to stimulate “capital
formation,” especially in the long run, is to cut down on both govern-
ment and private spending.</p>
<p>And in fact, we do respond to changes in the value of capital by
chang- ing our spending habits.When the value of capital goes up, we
tend to step</p>
<p>up our spending, and when the value of capital goes down, we tend to
cut back our spending. For a more detailed analysis of the relation
between capital and spending, see the early chapters of Miller and Upton
(1974).</p>
<p>Let’s keep in mind, in thinking about total capital, that human
capital is probably the bulk of it. Even if we add real estate and other
personal property to the value of business capital, the value of human
capital is probably well over half of the total. So if we have to think
of capital as being either physical or human, we’re better off thinking
of it as human.</p>
<p>Human capital, though, is produced just as much as physical capital
is produced. A raw human being has about as much economic value as an
uncultivated piece of land in the wilderness. Through his own efforts
and through the efforts of others, a person takes on education,
socialization, and experience that increase his economic value just as
surely as roads, sewers, utilities, and buildings increase the value of
a piece of land.</p>
<p>The Sources of Uncertainty</p>
<p>Why do human capital and business have ups and downs that are largely
unpredictable? I think it’s because of basic uncertainty about what peo-
ple will want in the future and about what the economy will be able to
produce in the future. If future tastes and technology were known, prof-
its and wages would grow smoothly and surely over time.</p>
<p>What happens is that people estimate what the future will be like,
using all the available information. Then they decide how to invest in
human or physical capital.They choose an occupation, or decide between
formal education and on-the-job training, or move from a slow-growing
area to a fast-growing area of the country. They choose between a highly
automated plant and one that takes less of an initial outlay but uses
more people. They choose between building more fast-food outlets on
high- ways and setting up employee cafeterias in large ofﬁce
buildings.</p>
<p>To a signiﬁcant extent, these decisions are irreversible. When it
turns out that the decisions are right, the businesses that made them
and the people who decided to work for those businesses do well. When it
turns out that the decisions are wrong, everyone does badly. When high
gas costs keep people away from fast-food outlets, both the</p>
<p>restaurant owners and the employees end up wishing they had invested
differently.</p>
<p>If all these decisions could somehow be made independently, perhaps
the errors would cancel out, and the future course of the economy would
be smooth. But they can’t be made independently. They must be based on
the information we have now. If that information is wrong, it will be
wrong in the same direction for everyone. (Except that a few people may
have ignored the information or may have assumed that it was wrong.)</p>
<p>Thus the source of the ups and downs in business and employment can
be taken to be uncertainty about the future. Investment decisions must
be made with only limited information, and as more information comes in,
the value of those investments will ﬂuctuate. Since that is the source
of the ﬂuctuations, business will go up and down in a generally random
way.The cycles that seem to be there when we look at charts of business
ﬂuctuations will be mostly optical illusions.</p>
<p>The Great Depression</p>
<p>What happened after 1929? Can the story I am telling be applied to
the 1930s? To a large extent, I think it can, though I’m not sure
exactly where the investment decisions of the 1920s went wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was something like an expectation that the economy had the
ability to produce a huge quantity and variety of goods and services. So
people planned on both producing and buying fancy houses, furni- ture,
appliances, cars, food, and more special things. It turned out, how-
ever, that the economy did not have this capacity. People had to spend
within a smaller budget, so many things that ﬁrms had geared up to pro-
duce were not in demand. There was a large drop in the value of both
human and business capital.</p>
<p>There was one other factor that may have made the depression worse,
though. According to Miller and Upton, in the book mentioned above, the
price level fell by nearly 50 percent between the end of 1929 and the
start of 1933. That’s three years.With the price level falling that
rapidly, any positive dollar interest rate would represent a rather
large interest rate in real terms. Since people could always hold
currency, the dollar interest rate couldn’t really become negative. So
the economy may</p>
<p>have been unable to reach its natural equilibrium. The natural
equilib- rium was bad enough, but the one the economy was forced into
was undoubtedly even worse.</p>
