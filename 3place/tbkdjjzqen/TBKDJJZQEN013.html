<p>The Trouble with Econometric Models</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>he trouble with econometric models is that, while they purport to
tell us something about causal relations between variables, they almost
invariably rely on correlations to imply causation. While correlations
can tell us much about how variables are statistically related, they
tell us little about how they are causally related. For example,
consumption and output show a positive correlation; but an conometric
model that assigns a causal role to consumption and one that assigns a
passive role to consumption would be equally consistent with the ob-
servable correlations. It is doubtful that traditional econometric
methods will survive.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, the economic variables of interest obey a joint
normal distribution. For any given values of some of the variables,
each</p>

<p>I would like to thank Michael Jensen, Merton Miller, Robert Pindyck,
David Ranson, Harvey Rosen,Julio Rotemberg, and Lawrence Summers for

<p>of the others follows a normal distribution. Many of the problems one
encounters in trying to make sense of economic data come from the many
ways in which the distribution of the variables can be other than joint
normal. The most basic problem, though, is present even when all the
variables are random and obey a joint normal distribution. That problem
is that of relating correlation and causation.1</p>
<p>We will assume, in what follows, that all variables obey a joint nor-
mal distribution. The problem of relating correlation and causation is
even more difﬁcult in more complex cases, but it is so serious in the
simplest case that we do not need to look at the complex cases.</p>
<p>In general, one can analyze data in two ways.2 A “descriptive analy-
sis” involves summarizing the data in various ways and developing meth-
ods for predicting, using purely statistical tools, future values of
some of the variables. When the variables obey a joint normal
distribution, the data can be summarized using the mean or average level
of each variable, the standard deviation or variability of each
variable, and the correlations among all pairs of variables. I use the
word “correlation” as shorthand for such a summary.</p>
<p>A “structural analysis” involves searching for economic relations
among the variables, partly in order to predict how the variables would
change if various actions were taken by individuals, ﬁrms, or govern-
ments.A structural analysis or analysis of the economic relations among
the variables is really an analysis of the causal relations among the
vari- ables.3 We want to know what the effects of an individual’s,
ﬁrm’s, or government’s action will be. In this chapter, an “econometric
model” means a model used for structural analysis.Thus, an econometric
model is a model of“causation.”</p>
<p>One of the basic principles of econometrics is “correlation does not
imply causation.”There is general agreement on this point when it is
stated this way. The problem is that almost every attempt to develop an
econometric model seems to make use of correlations in subtle ways to
imply causation. Since an econometric model is by deﬁni- tion a causal
model, and since regression coefﬁcients are closely related to partial
correlation coefﬁcients, the use of regressions to develop or reﬁne an
econometric model usually amounts to interpreting correla- tion as
implying causation.</p>
<p>The Trouble with Econometric Models 137</p>
<p>If we are to learn about economics from data, we must make causal
inferences. I have done several studies in which I try to infer causal-
ity from data.4 But standard econometric methods do not in themselves
allow us to make such inferences. People who do econometric studies
often go to great lengths to bring in other information that will tell
about causation.5</p>
<p>I believe, though, that people have almost always failed in their
attempts to derive causes from data. In one way or another, often
subtle, they have confused correlation with causation.This confusion is
covered up by the use of language that avoids the word “cause” and its
deriva- tives. People often use “determine,”“inﬂuence,” and “predict”
instead of“cause.”They use “exogenous,”“predetermined,” and
“independent” instead of“causal.”They use “endogenous” and “dependent”
instead of “resulting.”They use “structure” instead of“causal
relations.”</p>
<p>In physics, or chemistry, or engineering, we use experiments to ﬁnd
out about causes. In economics, experiments are rarely done. But per-
haps if we realized how little we can learn from correlations, we would
do more experiments.</p>
<p>Correlations</p>
<p>In summarizing data, it is often convenient to use correlations.The
var- iability and average level of each variable are used too, but the
relations among the variables are described by the correlations. When
some of the variables are not random,“correlation” is not the right
word, but it still conveys the right feeling.</p>
<p>The long equations in many models are nothing but correlations. If we
know the correlations, we can write down a large number of long
equations involving different groups of variables.We can put any vari-
able on the left-hand side, and any number of the remaining variables on
the right-hand side.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we are interested in the adult heights of dif-
ferent members of a family—father, mother, son, and daughter. Assume
that males and females grow to the same average height, and that chil-
dren grow to the same average height as parents.Assume that the father’s
height and the mother’s height contribute equally to a child’s
height,</p>
<p>Table 12.1 Correlations of Family Heights</p>
<p>f m s d</p>
<p>f 1 ½ ¾ ¾</p>
<p>m ½ 1 ¾ ¾</p>
<p>s ¾ ¾ 1 ¾</p>
<p>d ¾ ¾ ¾ 1</p>
<p>and that the heights of two children in the same family are related
only through the heights of their common parents.</p>
<p>To ﬁgure out the correlations among all the variables, we need one
more bit of information—how closely related the father’s and mother’s
heights are. Suppose tall people tend to marry tall people, and short
people tend to marry short people, so that the correlation between the
height of the father and the height of the mother is 1/2. Using f, m, s,
and d for the heights ofthe father, mother, son, and daughter,Table 12.1
shows the correlation among all the variables, Note that the correlation
between the son’s height and the daughter’s height is just as strong as
the correlation between a parent’s height and a child’s height.</p>
<p>Once we know the correlations, we can write down any equation we want
for the best predictor of one variable given the values of other
variables. Putting a bar over the variable we are predicting, and using
h for the average adult height, we can write any of the following
equations.</p>
<p>_ = ½f + ½m</p>
<p>d_ = ½f+ ½m</p>
<p>_s = ¾f + ¼h</p>
<p>d_ = ¾m + ¼h</p>
<p>__f = ¾s + ¼h</p>
<p>m_ = ¾d+ ¼h</p>
<p>__f = ½m+ ½h</p>
<p>m_ = ½f+ ½h</p>
<p>_s = ¾d + ¼h</p>
<p>d_ = ¾s+ ¼h</p>
<p>_f = s + %d + %h</p>
<p>_s = d + %f + h</p>
<p><em>d</em> = %f + %s + %h</p>
<p>Any of these equations could be part of an “econometric model”</p>
<p>of heights of parents and children. But once we know the
correlations, the equations tell us nothing new. The correlations among
the pairs of variables tell us everything there is to know about how the
variables are statistically related. Neither these equations nor the
correlations tell us much about how the variables are causally
related.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s hard to interpret correlations, no matter how
they are presented. When only a few variables are included in a model,
it’s possible that the relations we see are due to the inﬂuence of
variables that are not included. But when we have a large model with
many vari- ables, there are so many relations that it becomes extremely
difﬁcult to understand them.We will look at these problems in more
detail in the next section.</p>
<p>Causation</p>
<p>Econometric models are supposed to tell us about causation. Most
often, they actually tell us about correlation.</p>
<p>Advertising and Sales</p>
<p>Consider the relation between advertising expenditures and sales of
the advertised product. It is clear that advertising sells certain
products. It is also clear that products that sell more advertise more.
So the simple correlation between advertising and sales cannot be used
to tell us how much an increase in advertising will increase sales in
any individual case.</p>
<p>Firms solve this problem by looking at more than correlations.</p>
<p>They do experiments. They advertise in some regions but not in oth-
ers. They switch between print media and broadcast media. Even the
experiments are of somewhat limited value, because the results can
change over time or from product to product.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a ﬁrm that always takes what it thinks is the best
approach in every market will not be able to do experiments. Then it
will be very difﬁcult to analyze the correlation between advertis- ing
and sales. One approach would be to try to include in the analysis</p>
<p>variables other than advertising that affect sales. If we can take
out the effects of these variables, perhaps we will be left with the
effects of the advertising.</p>
<p>But this won’t work, because any variable that inﬂuences future sales
will also inﬂuence the level of advertising for a product. If a ﬁrm
thinks a new product has great potential, for whatever reason, it will
tend to spend heavily (relative to a similar product with less
potential) on adver- tising it. It’s not reasonable to expect to include
all the variables that inﬂuence future sales.</p>
<p>If we were somehow able to measure all the variables that are related
to future sales of a product, we would be able to explain the level of
advertising too.We wouldn’t be able to test for the independ- ent effect
of advertising, because there wouldn’t be any.</p>
<p>When ﬁrms are acting optimally in the light of what they can know
without doing experiments, we can’t test the causal relation between
advertising and sales. Our only hope is that ﬁrms sometimes make mis-
takes and thus do not act optimally.</p>
<p>Mistakes, such as the omission of a television commercial from its
scheduled slot, can sometimes give a ﬁrm information like the informa-
tion it gets from experiments. Such mistakes, though, should be identi-
ﬁed and analyzed separately. It doesn’t help to lump them in with other
data on advertising and sales, as would be done with a standard econo-
metric analysis.</p>
<p>It’s not even clear what we would hope to show by building an
econometric model of the relation between advertising and sales. That
ﬁrms typically advertise to the point where an additional dollar spent
on advertising generates an additional dollar in net revenue? If it
doesn’t tell us that, we’d better throw out the model.</p>
<p>Some years ago, a colleague of mine thought he had found a market
where marginal revenue was greater than marginal cost. As a sideline, he
went into the satin sheet business. He was really in the business of
advertising satin sheets, because he didn’t have to concern himself much
with the production of the sheets. He placed an ad, and then as orders
came in, he sent them to a “fulﬁllment house” that shipped the
sheets.</p>
<p>What did he ﬁnd? On average, a dollar of advertising generated a
dollar of revenue, net of the costs of buying, ﬁnancing, and shipping
the sheets. And a dollar spent on upgrading the plate used in printing
the</p>
<p>ads generated a dollar of extra revenue net of costs.The ﬁrms already
in the satin sheet business had made the market very efﬁcient.</p>
<p>This suggests a different approach to the problem of building a model
of the relation between advertising and sales.We might develop a theory
of advertising based on the idea that ﬁrms almost always act rationally
in deciding where and how to advertise and how much to spend on
advertising.We might introduce a variety of factors that affect the
nature of a ﬁrm’s advertising. If we are ambitious, we may even use the
notion that consumers respond rationally to advertising as a source of
product information.</p>
<p>Using this theory, we can take the amount and type of advertising
actually done as optimal, and relate it to the type of product
advertised and other factors.We won’t need to use ﬁgures on future sales
at all, but we will include past sales of the product, and past sales of
related prod- ucts, as factors affecting the current level of
advertising.</p>
<p>The result will be a model of factors that seem to affect advertis-
ing, rather than a model of the relation between advertising and sales.
We will estimate correlations, and ﬁt the theory of how various factors
affect optimal advertising to the numbers we ﬁnd.The correlations will
not tell us directly about the causal relation between the factors we
look at and the ﬁrm’s advertising.</p>
<p>Money and Economic Activity</p>
<p>For a second example, consider the relation between money and eco-
nomic activity. When economic activity grows faster than usual, the
money stock tends to grow faster than usual, and when the money stock
grows faster than usual, economic activity tends to grow faster than
usual. Slower than usual growth in the money stock tends to be
associated with slower than usual growth in economic activity too. In
other words, growth in the money stock and growth in economic activity
are correlated.</p>
<p>How are we to interpret this correlation? Many economists believe
that Federal Reserve open market operations affect economic activ- ity.
I believe that the level of economic activity affects the demand for
money, which affects the stock of money, but that open market opera-
tions do not affect the level of economic activity. In my theory, the
money supply function and the money demand function are identical.</p>
<p>Whenever the demand for money changes, the money stock changes to
accommodate the change in demand without any signiﬁcant inﬂu- ence or
interference by the Federal Reserve Board.6</p>
<p>The correlation does not tell us the direction of causation. In the
Great Depression, income and money both fell sharply. But did the fall
in the money stock cause the fall in income? Or did the fall in income
cause the fall in the money stock?</p>
<p>Leads and lags in the relation between two variables can give some
information about the direction of causation, but even this information
is hard to interpret.We are tempted to say that if changes in money tend
to lead changes in income, the causal chain runs from money to income.
But this conclusion is not warranted.</p>
<p>The problem is that there may be a third factor causing changes in
both money and income. It may act on money more quickly than it acts on
income.Wealth, as measured by the level of stock prices, acts this
way.</p>
<p>In fact, we ﬁnd that changes in stock prices neither lead nor lag
changes in money, while they lead changes in income.7 If demand for
money is related to wealth, we would expect changes in stock prices and
changes in money to be related with little or no lag. If stock prices
reﬂect anticipated corporate proﬁts and thus anticipated economic
conditions, we would expect changes in stock prices and changes in
income to be related with a lag.Thus the lag between changes in money
and changes in income may be due to the common inﬂuence of changes in
wealth.</p>
<p>We just can’t use correlations, with or without leads and lags, to
determine causation. We could use experiments with Federal Reserve
policy to ﬁnd out whether money affects income, but experiments like
that have not been considered acceptable.</p>
<p>If we’re not going to do experiments, then we are forced to test a
theory of the relation between money and income by whether it is
consistent with the observed correlations (as both theories mentioned
above are) and by whether it seems plausible.</p>
<p>A plausible theory is one whose assumptions seem reasonable, or one
whose predictions would not change much if its assumptions were replaced
by more reasonable assumptions.A plausible theory is one that does not
imply consistent, easy to exploit proﬁt opportunities. A plau- sible
theory is one that ﬁts both everyday experience and correlations that
come out of statistical analysis.</p>
<p>There just isn’t any easy way to test a theory, or to show the direc-
tion of causation between two variables. There will often be several
plausible theories consistent with the observed correlations. If we
can’t do experiments, all we can do is to keep making our theories more
plausible, and to keep testing the theories against measured
correlations. Constructing an econometric model is just a way of testing
a theory against measured correlations.</p>
<p>Consumption and Output</p>
<p>Consumption and output show a positive correlation. Unusual increases
or decreases in consumption are associated with unusual increases or
decreases in output. But what does this mean?</p>
<p>Some theories assign a causal role to consumption. People cut their
consumption, which reduces business for many ﬁrms, which reduces output,
which reduces income, which may cause people to cut their consumption
even more.</p>
<p>Other theories assign a more passive role to consumption. People cut
their consumption when wealth falls and when they expect output to fall.
If output does not fall, the cut in consumption will mean higher
savings.8 There is no easy way to use correlations to distinguish
between these two theories.We can construct models of each that will be
con- sistent with observed correlations between consumption and
output.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t take any one model seriously just because it can be made
to ﬁt the data.</p>
<p>I have been unable to think of any way to distinguish between the
various possible econometric models involving consumption and output—at
least any way that involves standard methods for construct- ing
econometric models.</p>
<p>Supply and Demand</p>
<p>Econometric models are often developed to relate the supply and
demand for a single commodity or group of commodities.We may set supply,
which depends on price and other variables, equal to demand, which also
depends on price and other variables. When supply and</p>
<p>demand are equal, let’s call their common value Q. Let’s write P for
the price of the commodity.</p>
<p>The basic correlation in a model of supply and demand is the cor-
relation between P and Q. Unfortunately, this can’t tell us much about
either supply or demand. Changes in demand will make P and Q move in the
same direction, and will tell us about supply, if supply doesn’t change.
Changes in supply will make P and Q move in opposite direc- tions, and
will tell us about demand, if demand doesn’t change.</p>
<p>But what happens is that both supply and demand are continuously
changing, so the correlation between P and Q doesn’t tell a clear story
about either one.We can try bringing in other variables, but most other
variables are related to both supply and demand, or to neither supply
nor demand, so we can’t use correlations between P and the other vari-
ables or correlations between Q and the other variables to tell us about
supply alone or about demand alone.</p>
<p>Demand for Gasoline</p>
<p>When the price of gasoline goes up, how much will consumption of
gasoline fall in the short run? How much will it fall in the long run?
How does the change in consumption depend on the source of the price
increase?</p>
<p>It’s very hard to use observations about the price of gasoline and
the amount consumed to answer these questions. Because some price
changes are caused by demand changes, a price increase will often be
associated with an increase in consumption, rather than with a decrease,
or with a relatively small decrease in consumption.</p>
<p>What about looking at variations across states in the price of gaso-
line and in the amount consumed per person? The problem here is that
there are so many other variables, related to both price and con-
sumption, that it will be very, very difﬁcult to hold other things the
same. Population density for example, should be negatively related to
price because of economies of scale, but should be negatively related to
amount consumed per person because people who live in apartments don’t
use as much gasoline as people who live on ranches.</p>
<p>Even the increases in price that are often attributed to collusion
among the petroleum-exporting countries may be partly due to</p>
<p>increases in demand. Increases in demand for a product that theoreti-
cally has a ﬁxed total supply will increase the price that a cartel will
charge, just as they would increase the price that competitive producers
charge. Thus we can’t use the consumption changes associated with such
price increases as direct evidence on the sensitivity of consumption to
price.</p>
<p>Taxes and Work</p>
<p>We tax high incomes at high rates, and subsidize low incomes through
programs such as public housing, food stamps, unemployment compen-
sation, social security, subsidized public transport, and welfare.
Theory suggests that high-income people may work a lot in spite of high
tax rates, but that low-income people may respond strongly to payments
they receive only if they don’t work.</p>
<p>How can we estimate the strength of this incentive effect? We want to
know, in effect, how a change in a person’s wage will affect the number
of hours he puts in. Even if we can observe hours worked and after-tax
wages, it will be very difﬁcult to estimate the strength of the
effect.</p>
<p>Estimating the sensitivity of work to wages is difﬁcult for reasons
very much like those that make estimating the sensitivity of gasoline
consumption to gasoline prices difﬁcult. If wages go up because work
becomes more difﬁcult or leisure becomes more attractive, then work may
go down rather than up. If worsening economic conditions cause the
government to increase its subsidies to non-workers, it will be hard to
tell whether the decline in work is due to the subsidies or to the
worsening economic conditions.</p>
<p>Similarly, variations in tax rates and variations in hours worked
across states cannot be used in any obvious way to tell how sensitive
hours worked are to after-tax wages. Tax rates do not vary randomly.
Presumably they vary mostly because of differences between the states.
These differences will also be related to hours worked. For example,
taxes in some states may be high because people in those states care
more about the poor, hence are willing to work hard to pay the taxes to
provide services for the poor. How can we separate the effects of taxes
from the effects of these other variables?</p>
<p>Even if we have an econometric model with many variables and many
equations, we will mostly be estimating correlations. Correlations won’t
tell us much about either the demand for gasoline or the supply of
work.</p>
<p>Forecasting</p>
<p>It is easier to use correlations for forecasting than it is to
interpret them. If we’re using them for forecasting, we don’t have to
understand them. Thus it is easier to use econometric models for
forecasting than it is to interpret the coefﬁcients. Understanding a
model helps only in that it may give us conﬁdence that the coefﬁcients
will be stable through time.</p>
<p>Changes in stock prices are correlated with future changes in cor-
porate earnings, hence with future changes in GNP. Since stock prices
reﬂect expectations about future cash ﬂows, we can have conﬁdence that
this relation will persist.</p>
<p>Changes in interest rates seem to be correlated with future changes
in GNP too. Since we don’t understand why this correlation exists, we
will watch closely for signs that it has shifted. But so long as it
persists, it can be used in forecasting GNP.</p>
<p>Even the best forecasts may not be very good. The forward exchange
rate between two currencies will be the best forecast of the future spot
rate, for certain purposes, if the forward market is efﬁcient. The
correlation between the forward rate and the future spot rate may be
low, but the model that says the forward rate is the expected future
spot rate is the best there is.There’s no reason to add any other
variables or to construct an elaborate econometric model using those</p>
<p>variables.9</p>
<p>Forecasts based on efﬁcient markets can sometimes be very use- ful.
For example, the futures market for gold usually indicates that the
price of gold is expected to rise at about the current interest rate.
Since returns on gold are largely independent of returns on securi-
ties, that means that gold is a natural part of most individual portfo-
lios. Holdings of gold are not taxed unless gains are realized, so gold
has a high after-tax expected return for an asset whose risk can be
diversiﬁed away.</p>
<p>As the gold example indicates, a good forecasting model need not be
complex. When we make use of the information in efﬁcient mar- kets, the
model may contain only one variable, or at most just a few
variables.</p>
<p>Errors</p>
<p>One of the problems with econometric models is that all the variables
are observed with error.We estimate correlations between the variables
we observe, while we might like to know the correlations between the
unobservable variables without errors.What’s more, the correlations are
often unstable, so our estimates for one period may not be valid for a
later period.</p>
<p>These problems should make us very cautious about using econo- metric
models for forecasting, because we learn to forecast observed variables,
and we want forecasts of the unobserved variables. They should make us
even more cautious about interpreting the correla- tions or coefﬁcients
in an econometric model, because the correlation between two observed
variables can be very different from the correla- tion between the
corresponding unobserved variables.</p>
<p>For a simple example, let’s look at the relation between inﬂation and
exchange rates.The simplest theory relating these variables is called
purchasing power parity. It says that when the inﬂation rate in one
country is higher than it might have been, holding real variables and
other countries’ inﬂation rates constant, that country’s exchange rate
will depreciate more than it might have depreciated or will appreciate
less than it might have appreciated.</p>
<p>Purchasing power parity theory does not have a causal structure; it
merely predicts certain correlations. Under ﬁxed exchange rates, a
country may increase its inﬂation rate by devaluing its currency. Under
ﬂoating exchange rates, higher inﬂation in one country than in other
countries may cause the value of its currency to decline.</p>
<p>To test purchasing power parity, we can look at correlations among
inﬂation rates, changes in exchange rates and such real variables as
tar- iffs and exchange controls that should affect both exchange rates
and inﬂation.At ﬁrst glance, these correlations often seem inconsistent
with</p>
<p>purchasing power parity. Changes in exchange rates may be far from
differences between inﬂation rates.</p>
<p>One reason for that is that the real variables are not being held
con- stant. An important reason, though, is that the theory deals, not
with actual inﬂation rates, but with differences between actual inﬂation
rates and inﬂation rates that might have been.We can’t observe the
inﬂation rates that might have been. Thus it’s hard to reject purchasing
power parity based on correlations between observable variables.The
difference between the observable inﬂation rates and the unobservable
variables we would like to use is just too great.</p>
<p>If we accept purchasing power parity, then changes in the value of
the dollar do not cause changes in trade patterns. Changes in the
relative prices of imports and exports may show up, though, partly as
changes in the value of the dollar. Nominal values may be symptoms, but
not causes, of what’s happening in the real international economy.</p>
<p>Since this theory is so simple, and has such interesting policy
implications, it would be nice to know whether it’s true or not.
Unfortunately, correlations between observable variables won’t tell us,
at least not without a lot of other evidence.</p>
<p>Solutions</p>
<p>What are some possible solutions to the problems of trying to ﬁnd
causal relations in observational data?</p>
<p>I have not been able to think of any general solutions to the prob-
lem. It is possible that the methods used must depend on the special
facts of each case. For example, it may be that close attention to the
effects of “accidents” will give us information that we could not get by
looking at the normal operations of a market or the economy. Accidents
that are truly random, though, are rare.</p>
<p>I have studied the relation between stock price changes and stock
price volatility changes.10 The possible causal relations included
direct causation (from price changes to volatility changes), reverse
causation (from volatility changes to price changes), and causation from
changes in other underlying factors. I interpreted the magnitude of the
relation</p>
<p>I found as suggesting that at least two of these kinds of causation
must</p>
<p>be operating. I proposed a direct test for reverse causation, but the
test did not give conclusive results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to generalize these methods, though. Both seemed
speciﬁc to the facts of this problem. For example, the test for reverse
causation depended on the notion that changes in expectations of future
volatility should be reﬂected immediately in stock prices. With eco-
nomic data other than stock prices, this test might have no
analogue.</p>
<p>There is hope.We can do more experiments, when the answers we seek
are worth enough to justify the cost of experimenting.We can look for
problem-speciﬁc ways to identify cause and effect.11 I doubt, how- ever,
that traditional econometric methods will survive.</p>
<p>Glossary:The Language of Econometrics</p>
<p>The trouble with econometric models is that they encourage us to read
correlations as indicating causation. We can see this by looking more
closely at the language of econometrics.</p>
<p>An exogenous variable is supposed to be a causal variable, if the
struc- ture of a model has economic meaning. In fact, it is usually just
a vari- able that is put on the right-hand side of equations in a model,
but not on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>Similarly, an endogenous variable is supposed to be a caused
variable.</p>
<p>In fact, it is usually just a variable that shows up at least once on
the left-hand side ofan equation.</p>
<p>A reduced form model is supposed to show all the direct and indirect
effects of the exogenous variables on the endogenous variables. Usually,
though, it is simply a statement of correlation between the left- and
right-hand side variables.</p>
<p>A structural model is supposed to show the causal relations among the
variables in the model. That’s why some variables in a structural model
usually appear on the left-hand side of one equation and the right-hand
side of the others—to show a causal chain. Most often, a structural
model cannot be interpreted causally. Regressions alone cannot tell
about the strength of causal relations. A structural model usually tells
about statistical structure, but not about economic structure.</p>
<p>A model is misspeciﬁed when it does not reﬂect the causal relations
among the variables. Some forms of misspeciﬁcation make sense only under
a causal interpretation. For example, omitted variables can’t be a
problem if you’re only interested in correlation. A sensible regression
can be done (when the variables are joint normal) for any choice of
right-hand side variables. Similarly, the residuals in a regression
among joint normal variables can’t be correlated with the independent
vari- ables, if all the coefﬁcients are chosen to minimize the sum of
squared errors. Less commonly, a model is “misspeciﬁed” when it does not
cor- rectly reﬂect the statistical relations among the variables, so it
is not the best possible model for prediction.</p>
<p>The identiﬁcation problem is a way of describing the inability to
make causal inferences from the coefﬁcients of estimated equations.The
phrase is especially used in connection with the inability to derive
demand curves or supply curves from observations on price and quantity.
Unfortunately, this problem is very difﬁcult to solve. The standard
method that is tried involves searching for a variable that is related
to demand but not to sup- ply, or to supply but not to demand. Do such
variables exist?</p>
<p>A model has errors in variables when the observed variables differ
from the variables we would like to observe. Every model has this prob-
lem. It means the estimated correlations will differ from the
correlations we would like to estimate between unobserved variables.</p>
<p>The multicollinearity problem is serious when you are trying to
assess causal ties.When two variables are closely related, a correlation
between one variable and a third might reﬂect a causal connection
between the second and third variables. If you are only interested in
statistical struc- ture, the only problem caused by multicollinearity is
that when both var- iables are used on the right-hand side of an
equation, the coefﬁcients of these two variables will be estimated with
considerable error. Equations can also be estimated with only one of the
collinear variables at a time; the coefﬁcients will not be the same as
when both are used, but in a sta- tistical model, there is no reason why
they should be the same.</p>
<p>An instrumental variable is supposed to help in assessing
causality.</p>
<p>When two variables clearly have common causes, the correlation
between them can be very hard to interpret. If we replace one of them
with an instrument, we hope that the causal relations will be more
nearly from one variable to the other. Unfortunately, it’s hard to
ﬁnd</p>
<p>instruments like this. Thus it’s hard to put a causal interpretation
on correlations involving instrumental variables.</p>

<li><p>Pratt and Schlaifer (1981) discuss this problem too.Their
abstract starts as fol- lows: “We inquire into the conditions under
which nonexperimental data reveal effects of a kind revealed by
randomized experiments and relevant to decisions, although we deﬁne
effects without regard to either.We argue that the general linear model
as usually presented by statisticians fails to distin- guish between
effects and regression coefﬁcients.”</p></li>
