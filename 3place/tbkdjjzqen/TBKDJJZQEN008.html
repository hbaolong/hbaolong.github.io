<p>How Passive Monetary</p>
<p>Policy Might Work</p>
<p>P</p>
<p>assive monetary policy means supplying the amount of money that the
private sector wants at all times, It means making money freely
available in exchange for assets of equal value. If monetary policy is
passive, then changes in the stock of money are caused by changes in the
public’s demand for money, and are not inﬂuenced by such things as open
market operations.</p>
<p>If monetary policy is passive, then changes in the price level or the
rate of inﬂation must be caused by non-monetary forces, such as changes
in the general level of economic activity or changes in the direction
and level of government intervention in the foreign exchange market.The
demand for money will depend on the price level and the rate of
inﬂation, so there will be a relation between money and prices. But the
causation will run from prices to money rather than from money to
prices.</p>
<p>Similarly, passive monetary policy will imply a relation between
income and money, and a relation between wealth and money. But the
causation will run from income or wealth to money rather than the other
way around.</p>
<p>With passive monetary policy, an increase in nominal interest rates
will mean a decrease in the money stock, other things equal, because an
increase in interest rates implies a reduced demand for money. It may
look like restrictive monetary policy causing an increase in interest
rates, but actually the causation will be just the reverse.</p>
<p>With passive monetary policy, a helicopter dropping currency all
around will have little effect. People will pick up the currency and
deposit it or exchange it for other assets of equal value. Ultimately,
the government will get the currency back. There may be an increase in
the amount of government debt outstanding or a reduction in pri- vate
assets held by the government, but there won’t be any signiﬁcant change
in the money stock.</p>
<p>That’s what passive monetary policy is. Note that it has nothing to
do with steady growth in the money stock. Indeed, steady growth in the
money stock is inconsistent with passive monetary policy, because demand
for money just doesn’t grow steadily. For example, money demand is
always high in December for the holiday season, relative to other months
of the year.</p>
<p>Does passive monetary policy imply an accelerating ﬂow of money into
the private sector, along with an accelerating rate of inﬂation? Hardly.
The demand for money is strictly limited by the fact that it pays no
inter- est, or interest at effective rates lower than market rates of
interest on bonds and bills. Passive monetary policy requires that an
individual or ﬁrm give up assets of equal value to get money. Such
exchanges make sense only if the money received will be turning
over.They will not go on indeﬁnitely.</p>
<p>Similarly, freely available reserves will not make banks go on a
lend- ing spree. An individual bank, if it is behaving optimally, will
always be creating demand deposits until the last dollar of demand
deposit it cre- ates costs an amount equal to the federal funds rate or
some similar rate. If the bank creates more demand deposits than that,
it will be los- ing money. Free availability of reserves will not affect
this decision rule for a bank. In fact, for an individual bank, reserves
are freely available whether or not monetary policy is passive.</p>
<p>How Passive Monetary Policy Might Work 93</p>
<p>It turns out that there are many ways for a government to adopt a
passive monetary policy. With some, it will be obvious that mone- tary
policy is passive.With others, monetary policy can be passive even
though the world believes that it is being used actively to inﬂuence
economic activity, employment, and inﬂation.</p>
<p>Free Exchange of Reserves and Securities</p>
<p>One way the government can make monetary policy passive is to stand
ready to exchange currency or reserves freely for government securi-
ties. It can offer to buy or sell government securities at prices that
give them interest rates comparable to rates on other securities with
the same features.</p>
<p>In principle, the same thing can be done with private securities.The
government might accumulate some private securities, and then start
exchanging them freely for currency or reserves at market prices.</p>
<p>If the Federal Reserve System is in charge of trading reserves and
securities, but insists on following an active monetary policy, then the
Treasury can offset what the Federal Reserve System does. For exam- ple,
the Treasury can vary the amounts of bills offered at its weekly auc-
tions. If it offers more bills than needed to cover maturing securities
and the government deﬁcit, it will be absorbing reserves. If it offers
fewer bills, it will be supplying reserves. Either the Treasury or the
Federal Reserve System can make monetary policy passive without the
cooperation of the other.</p>
<p>The price at which securities are bought or sold is a key
variable.</p>
<p>I have said that the government can exchange reserves and securi-
ties at market prices. That means at the price that the security would
have if the government were not buying or selling it. If the govern-
ment is buying or selling the security, it may be hard to know what the
market price would otherwise be. The government can ﬁx the price of any
individual security at any level it wants by offering to buy or sell
unlimited quantities at that price.</p>
<p>In principle, though, it is possible for the government to offer to
exchange reserves or currency and securities at the security prices that
would exist if the government didn’t try to change those prices. If
there</p>
<p>is only one kind of security involved, there will be only one price
con- sistent with equilibrium and a given total of net government
liabilities. More on that later.</p>
<p>Free Borrowing of Reserves</p>
<p>Another way to reach passive monetary policy is to allow the private
sector (perhaps mainly the banks) to borrow reserves freely at some-
thing like a market interest rate. The discount window can allow passive
monetary policy even when open market operations seem consistent with
active monetary policy. So long as there are substantial borrowed
reserves, the banks can fully offset open market operations by adding to
or subtracting from their borrowings from the Federal Reserve
System.</p>
<p>We can see the algebra of this by writing TR for total reserves, BR
for borrowed reserves, and NR for non-borrowed reserves.We have:</p>
<p>TR = BR + NR. (7.1)</p>
<p>Now TR can be given by the private sector’s demand for currency and
reserves, where the demand for reserves depends on the public’s demand
for deposits of various kinds. At the same time, NR may be ﬁxed by the
government, using open market operations or variations in Treasury
offerings of securities. These two are consistent because it takes both
TR and NR to determine BR.</p>
<p>BR = TR — NR. (7.2)</p>
<p>If there are substantial borrowed reserves, it’s clear that the
govern- ment can’t force more reserves onto the market by buying
securities or by not issuing new securities to replace maturing
government securi- ties. Any reserves the government puts out can be
returned through repayment of loans.</p>
<p>If some banks have no borrowings, then the government also can- not
easily take reserves out of the market. If it tries, then the banks that
have not borrowed can do so, and can lend the reserves they get to the
banks that lost reserves to the government. Only by putting quotas
on</p>
<p>all or most banks can the government stop the use of variations in
bor- rowed reserves to offset open market operations.</p>
<p>So it is hard for the government to stop the use of borrowed reserves
to make monetary policy passive, and it is easy for the government to
allow the use of borrowed reserves to make monetary policy passive.
Again, though, we have the question of the interest rate.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the interest rate for such borrowing should be a
market rate. If the rate is too low, the private sector will keep
borrowing and the government will have to issue securities at a great
rate to get the money to lend. If the rate is too high, banks will be
reluctant to borrow reserves, and we may not get passive mon- etary
policy. The correct rate will make a bank indifferent between buying
government securities and paying off some of its loan from the
government.</p>
<p>The Right Targets</p>
<p>Yet another way to have passive monetary policy while appearing to
use active monetary policy is to use the right targets. For example,
sup- pose that the government watches net free reserves (or its
negative, net borrowed reserves). When net free reserves goes up, the
government may sell securities in the open market, and when net free
reserves goes down, it may buy.</p>
<p>If the government keeps bringing net free reserves back to a target
level in this way, then it will essentially be responding to changes in
the demand for money.When the public wants more demand deposits, the
banks create them, and the added required reserves will cause net free
reserves to fall. When the government buys securities in response to
this, the banks will have the reserves they need to support the new
level of demand deposits without any change in the ﬁnal value of net
free reserves. Monetary policy will be passive.</p>
<p>Interest rate targets can be used in the same way. If the central
bank sets interest rate targets that are about equal to what interest
rates would be without any active buying or selling of securities, then
the buying and selling it does to reach these targets will amount to a
pas- sive response to shifts in the demand for currency and
reserves.</p>
<p>If all else fails, the central bank can cite “technical factors” as
the reason for responding to a shift in demand. Or it can point to
unusual events, such as bank failures or defaults on supposedly safe
securities, as the reasons for deviating from its usual active monetary
policy.</p>
<p>Indirect Methods</p>
<p>All the methods of reaching passive monetary policy given above still
do not exhaust the possibilities. For example, the government and the
private sector are constantly making payments to one another. If one or
the other wants to get rid of currency or reserves, it can use them in
making payments. There are so many opportunities to adjust the stock of
base money with payments like these that it’s hard to see how mon- etary
policy can be anything but passive.</p>
<p>And ﬁnally, the government can use ﬁxed exchange rates or inter-
vention under a ﬂoating rate system as a way of supplying the cur- rency
and reserves that the private sector wants. If the government stands
ready to exchange its currency freely (at a certain exchange rate) for
the currency of another country, then domestic residents can easily
adjust their holdings of currency and reserves.</p>
<p>If the private sector wants more currency, it can sell assets abroad
for foreign currency, and then exchange the foreign currency for
domestic currency. If the foreign country’s monetary policy is passive,
this will make the home country’s monetary policy passive too.</p>
<p>Free Exchange of Reserves and Deposits</p>
<p>All of the methods mentioned above can be used with existing laws and
institutions. There are others, though, that can be used if the gov-
ernment wants to admit that its monetary policy is passive.</p>
<p>For example, the government might set up its interest-bearing liabil-
ities in the form of Federal Reserve Bank deposits rather than Treasury
securities. There might be no government bonds, notes, or bills at all.
Instead, the Federal Reserve Banks might accept deposits from indi-
viduals, ﬁnancial institutions, or non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms that pay interest
at</p>
<p>market rates.These deposits might be like savings accounts, where
daily interest is paid and the money can be withdrawn on demand.</p>
<p>The government might still have non-interest-bearing deposits called
reserves, and it might still have reserve requirements for deposits at
banks. But it could make monetary policy clearly passive by allowing
free exchange of currency or reserves for interest-bearing deposits.</p>
<p>Free exchange of currency and deposits means simply that the gov-
ernment will always accept currency for credit to an interest-bearing
account, and will always allow withdrawals of currency from an interest-
bearing account. If the government had its debt in the form of interest-
bearing deposits like this, it’s hard to imagine any other policy. How
could the government refuse a deposit of currency?</p>
<p>Again, though, we have to worry about the interest rate. In this case
it’s the interest rate on deposits rather than the interest rate on
govern- ment securities. Does the interest rate on deposits take the
place of the supply of base money as a tool of monetary policy?</p>
<p>No. The interest rate on government deposits must be set passively
too.There is only one interest rate at which the public will be willing
to hold the accumulated stock of government liabilities.This is an
equation that is often omitted from models of the ﬁnancial sector.</p>
<p>Let’s write R for the interest rate on interest-bearing deposits, D
(R) for the demand for the interest-bearing deposits as a function of
the interest rate, C(R) for the demand for currency and reserves as a
function of the interest rate on deposits, and L for the total stock of
government liabili- ties.The total stock of government liabilities can
be thought of as ﬁxed at a point in time. It changes as the government
runs budget deﬁcits or sur- pluses, and it can change through gifts or
exchange of government liabilities for private assets. But at any point
in time, the demand for total government liabilities must equal the
total stock of such liabilities.We must have:</p>
<p>D(R) + C(R) = L. (7.3)</p>
<p>This equation determines the interest rate on government depos- its,
and the division of government liabilities between interest-bearing
deposits and the sum of currency and reserves. The interest rate is not
free to move to make people happy with higher or lower levels of cur-
rency plus reserves.</p>
