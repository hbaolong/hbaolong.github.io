<p>Purchasing Power Parity</p>
<p>in an Equilibrium Model</p>
<p>L,esb,icre;eee-t</p>
<p>curities, goods, and people; and where countries intervene in
exchange markets from time to time to inﬂuence exchange rates.</p>
<p>The “ofﬁcial” exchange rate between two countries is the rate at
which one or both of the countries will exchange their currencies. If
one government stands ready to exchange the two currencies with any
individual or institution in unlimited amounts at the ofﬁcial exchange
rate, then the “effective” exchange rate will be equal to the ofﬁcial
exchange rate. If the government will exchange currencies at the ofﬁcial
rate only with speciﬁc individuals or institutions under speciﬁc circum-
stances, then the effective rate or the “market” rate will often differ
from the ofﬁcial rate. If the government bans transactions at other than
the</p>
<p>ofﬁcial rate, and places limits on individual and institutional
holdings of foreign exchange, then the free market rate will be a “black
market” rate. The most interesting economic variable is the market
exchange rate for a pair of countries that do not restrict private
transactions in their cur- rencies.This can occur under ﬁxed rates,
ﬂexible rates, or mixed systems such as pegged rates or ﬂexible rates
with intervention.</p>
<p>When private transactions are restricted, then the exchange rate will
depend on who the transactors are.There will not be a single exchange
rate at a given point in time.The black market rates will reﬂect the
pen- alties the government will impose if a transaction is discovered
and the likelihood that it will be discovered.</p>
<p>The law of one price says that when there are no transport costs,
taxes, or direct controls, and when there is a market exchange rate at
which everyone can exchange currencies freely, then the price of a good
or service in one country times the exchange rate must equal the price
of the same good or service in the other country. Even services are cov-
ered by this law, because assuming no transport costs means that cus-
tomers can be brought without cost to the country in which the service
is provided.</p>
<p>The law of one price is self-evident to most of us, at least as a
the- oretical proposition. It is still interesting to “test” it, in the
sense that we look at an apparent violation of the law, and try to ﬁnd
out what factors explain the apparent violation. We may be comparing
goods that are not identical, or transport costs may be important, or
import taxes or controls may be effective or exchange transactions may
not be allowed to occur freely at the market rate.</p>
<p>The law of one equilibrium is just as self-evident as the law of one
price to some of us. It says that for a given set of real conditions in
the world, including transport costs, taxes, and direct controls, there
will be a single set of equilibrium relative prices (and quantities) for
all goods and services. Among the relative prices that are determined by
real factors are the price of any traded good relative to the price of
any non-traded good, the relative price of any pair of non-traded goods
in the same country, and the price of any non-traded good in one country
relative to the price of the same good in another country. There is no
special reason for distinguishing between traded and non-traded goods.
Monetary fac- tors can at most affect the price levels, rates of
inﬂation, and exchange</p>
<p>Purchasing Power Parity in an Equilibrium Model 83</p>
<p>rates between two countries. Monetary factors will not affect the
relative price of any pair of goods.</p>
<p>Relative prices do change over time, because the real conditions in
the world change over time. So we can’t test the law of one equilibrium
by testing whether relative prices are constant.We can test it, however,
by looking at periods in which government policy changes radically. If a
government changes the exchange rate between two countries, and if the
exchange rates both before and after the change are mar- ket exchange
rates at which currencies may be exchanged freely, and if there are no
offsetting changes in taxes or direct controls at the same time, then we
expect that the relative price of any pair of goods will be unchanged.
To distinguish this test from a test of the law of one price, we might
apply the test to a non-traded good in the two countries.</p>
<p>Another way to “test” the law of one equilibrium is to look at appar-
ent violations of the law and try to explain them. If a pure devaluation
(as deﬁned above) seems to cause a change in some relative price, then
we will look for some explanation. Perhaps the relative price was going
to change anyway. Perhaps the devaluation was not so pure, and there
were some signiﬁcant changes in taxes or direct controls along with it.
Perhaps there are errors in our price data. This a legitimate test in
the sense that one can imagine ﬁnding that the data are truly
inconsistent with the hypothesis. In another sense, the test is a waste
of time, because it is so unlikely that the law of one equilibrium is
false.</p>
<p>The purchasing power parity theorem is derived from the law of one
equilibrium. It says that the relative price of a particular bundle of
goods and services in one country and a particular bundle of goods and
services in another country is determined entirely by real factors. This
theorem, like the other two propositions discussed above, makes sense
only when there is a market exchange rate between the two countries at
which their currencies may be exchanged freely.The particular bundle of
goods and services used in each country is the bundle used in
calculating the price index in that country.</p>
<p>The purchasing power parity theorem is harder to test than either the
law of one price or the law of one equilibrium, because it makes use of
prices for such a large number of goods and services.There are likely to
be substantial errors in some of these prices.And there are likely to be
substantial changes over time in the relative prices of some pairs of
items</p>
<p>from the two indexes. The more the two indexes differ in composition,
the more substantial are the changes we expect over time in the relative
price of the two bundles.</p>
<p>The purchasing power parity theorem, as deﬁned above, holds all the
time. It holds in the short run and in the long run. To test it, we
would look for changes in government exchange rate policy that occur for
two countries with (a) a market exchange rate both before and after the
change in policy, (b) no changes in taxes or direct controls along with
the change in policy, (c) no sharp changes in relative prices for
reasons unrelated to exchange rates, and (d) relatively error-free price
indexes.</p>
<p>We can do another test by ignoring (a)–(d), and simply comparing
changes in exchange rates and changes in price indexes. Since we are
ignoring so many important factors, it would be surprising to ﬁnd the
data consistent with purchasing power parity, especially in the short
run. In the long run, some of these factors should wash out. Thus it is
very surprising that Moon Hoe Lee1 ﬁnds the data so consistent with the
the- orem, both in the short run and in the long run. He ﬁnds a good
rela- tionship in the short run even without taking violation of (a)–(d)
into account, and he ﬁnds an amazingly close relationship in the long
run.</p>
