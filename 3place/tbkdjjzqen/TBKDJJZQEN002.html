<p>Banking and Interest</p>
<p>Rates in a World Without Money</p>
<p>The Effects of Uncontrolled Banking</p>
<p>t is possible to imagine a world in which commercial banks and other
ﬁnancial institutions are free to offer checking accounts (and savings
accounts) on any terms they might want to set, and in which</p>
<p>there are no reserve requirements. Banks could pay interest on demand
deposits, and might not choose to distinguish between demand deposits
and time deposits. Since there would be no reserve requirements, there
would be no reason for Federal Reserve open market operations.</p>
<p>Reprinted with permission of the Bank Administration Institute from
the Journal of Bank Research, Autumn, 1970.</p>
<p>I am grateful for comments on earlier drafts of the chapter by Myron
Scholes, Franco Modigliani, Martin Bailey,James Lorie,John McQuown,Jack
Treynor, and Michael Jensen.</p>
<p>2 b u s i n e s s c y c l e s a n d e q u i l i b r i u m</p>
<p>In such a world, it would not be possible to give any reasonable
deﬁnition of the quantity of money. The payments mechanism in such a
world would be very efﬁcient, but money in the usual sense would not
exist. Thus neither the quantity theory of money nor the liquidity
preference theory of money would be applicable.</p>
<p>Vickrey was one of the ﬁrst writers to imagine such a world. He says
(1955, p. 113):</p>
<p>In passing it may be noted that the essentially institutional nature
of monetary theory, including much of the basic notions of the quantity
theory and of the liquidity-preference theory, is brought out by
considering how far either of these theories would be applicable to a
situation in which all transactions are executed by check or some
similar instrument, in which banks cover their operating expenses
entirely from service charges and pay interest on average balances at
rates reﬂecting the return on their investments, and in which overdrafts
are honored fairly freely, possibly at graduated interest rates. It
seems likely that for application to such circumstances the theories
would have to be rather radically modiﬁed, if indeed they did not become
entirely inapplicable.</p>
<p>Vickrey does not explore the concept any further in this article, but
he has a somewhat longer discussion in a later book (1964, pp. 108–10).
There he emphasizes the fact that current monetary theory depends
heavily on a rather restricted form of ﬁnancial institution. He says
that other institutional arrangements would make current monetary theory
almost completely invalid.</p>
<p>Tobin comes close to saying the same thing several times. In
“Commercial Banks as Creators of ‘Money’,” (1967) he emphasizes the
similarity between commercial banks and other ﬁnancial intermediaries,
and thus between the liabilities of commercial banks and the liabilities
of other ﬁnancial intermediaries. He says that the differences would
tend to vanish in an unregulated, competitive ﬁnancial world; and that
even in today’s world, the volume of liabilities of any ﬁnancial
institu- tion is determined more by depositor preferences than by
government and central bank actions. However, Tobin and Brainard (1967)
say that the presence of uncontrolled banking reduces, but does not
eliminate,</p>
<p>Banking and Interest Rates in a World Without Money 3</p>
<p>the effectiveness of monetary control through changes in the volume
of government debt.</p>
<p>Tobin (1968) points out some advantages, at least in a long-run
sense, of allowing interest on demand deposits, or allowing interest-
bearing assets to serve as means of payment. He says (1968, p. 846):</p>
<p>Freeing means of payment from the legal limitations of zero interest
would make it theoretically possible to have an efﬁcient growth
equilibrium without deﬂation—efﬁcient in the sense that the real rate of
interest is high enough to avoid overcapi- talization and in the sense
that real resources are not diverted into economizing means of
payment.</p>
<p>Tobin comes closest to seeing the implications of uncontrolled
banking in (1969, p. 26):</p>
<p>If the interest rate on money, as well as the rates on all other
ﬁnancial assets, were ﬂexible and endogenous, then they would all simply
adjust to the marginal efﬁciency of capital. There would be no room for
discrepancies between market and natural rates of return on capital,
between market valuation and reproduction cost. There would be no room
for monetary policy to affect aggregate demand.The real economy would
call the tune for the ﬁnancial sector, with no feedback in the other
direction. As previously observed, something like this occurs in the
long run, where the inﬂuence of monetary policy is not on aggregate
demand but on the relative supplies of monetary and real assets, to
which all rates of return must adjust.</p>
<p>Gurley and Shaw (1960, pp. 253–6) observe that with laissez-faire
banking, the price level is not determinate, and suffers from “aimless
drift.”</p>
<p>Patinkin (1965, p. 303) also says that the price level is
indeterminate when banks are not controlled:</p>
<p>Indeed, what we have here is the indeterminacy of Wicksell’s “pure
credit” economy in which all transactions are carried out by checks,
while banks hold no reserves. The eco- nomic interpretation of this
indeterminacy is straightforward:</p>
<p>In order for the absolute price level to be determined by
market-equilibrating forces, changes in it must impinge on real behavior
in some market, i.e., must create excess demands in some market.</p>
<p>Johnson (1969) and Friedman and Schwartz (1969), on the other hand,
claim that uncontrolled banking will lead to an uncontrolled increase in
prices. Friedman and Schwartz say (1969, p. 5):</p>
<p>In the hypothetical world in which there are no costs of setting up a
bank and running a bank, and in which deposits transfer- able by check
provide precisely the same services as dominant money, there would be no
limit to this process short of a price level of inﬁnity in terms of
dominant money.</p>
<p>An even more extreme position is taken by Pesek and Saving (1967),
and by Pesek (1968).They say that making money a “free good” (by paying
full interest on demand deposits) will make it a worthless good, and
will cause a return to barter.</p>
<p>I maintain that the views expressed by Vickrey, Tobin, Gurley and
Shaw, and Patinkin are the correct ones. In a world without controls on
banking, the real sector will be independent of the ﬁnancial sector, and
the price level will be indeterminate. Traditional monetary theo- ries
will be inapplicable; in fact, it will not be possible to deﬁne the
quantity of money in meaningful terms. Finally, I claim that this world
would have several advantages, and few obvious disadvantages, over our
present economic and monetary system.</p>
<p>A World Without Money</p>
<p>Let us imagine, then, a world in which money does not exist.</p>
<p>The major ﬁnancial institutions in this world are banks. There are
several competing major banks with branches in every state, as well as
banks that are more limited geographically. Payments in this world are
made by check. Because of economies of scale in check clearing, there
may be only one major clearing corporation, which is operated either by
the banks as a group or by the government.We might even imagine</p>
<p>that checks have been replaced by an electronic payments mechanism;
the discussion below would not be affected by this assumption.</p>
<p>Each bank is allowed to accept deposits under any conditions that it
chooses to specify, and to pay any rate of interest on these deposits.
In particular, the bank can allow transfers of credit by check between
two interest-bearing accounts. Demand deposits will pay interest, and
depositors are likely to be charged the full cost of transferring credit
from one account to another.Almost all deposits will be in the form of
demand deposits.</p>
<p>The banks will make loans to individuals, businesses, and gov-
ernments. They will probably establish a schedule of interest charges
for each borrower, and will then allow him to write checks on his
account that increase the amount of his loan whenever he needs the
money. The interest rate paid by a borrower will depend on such things
as the amount he has borrowed, his wealth, his current income and his
future income prospects. It will also depend on the extent to which he
provides the bank with collateral for his loan. The banks will also
probably set a maximum amount that they will lend to any individual, but
this maximum is mainly to keep the borrower from running up a very large
debt and then declaring bankruptcy. An individual who intends to repay
his loans would not approach the maximum except in very unusual
circumstances. Repayment will be ﬂexible; so long as the bank is in
touch with the borrower and is satisﬁed of his ability to repay, he will
not need to make payments of principal or interest in any particular
month or year. Interest will simply be charged against his account
periodically and will serve to increase the amount of his loan.</p>
<p>There will be an active market in inter-bank funds. A bank that has
more deposits than loans will deposit its excess funds with other banks
that have more loans than deposits.There will be no special rea- son for
an individual bank to have non-bank deposits equal to non- bank loans,
since it can adjust any imbalance through transactions with other
banks.</p>
<p>Banks will compete in setting schedules of interest rates on loans
and in setting transactions charges. The interest rate on deposits will
be a standard wholesale money rate. Individuals, corporations,
governments, and other banks will all receive the same interest rate on
deposits.</p>
<p>Banks will make money on the administration of loans and on the
handling of transactions.Their proﬁts on loans will come from the dif-
ference between the rates they charge and the wholesale interest rate,
minus their expenses. Their proﬁts on transactions will come from the
difference between their transactions charges and their costs in han-
dling transactions.</p>
<p>A bank will be happy to bid a customer with positive balances away
from another bank, even if it simply redeposits the customer’s money
with the original bank, because it gets that customer’s transactions
busi- ness (and possibly other business as well).A bank will be happy to
bid a customer with negative balances away from another bank, even if it
gets the deposits it needs to balance the new loan from the original
bank, because it gets both the customer’s loan business and the
customer’s transactions business.</p>
<p>An individual, business, or government will simply have an account at
a bank; there will be no need to distinguish between accounts with
positive balances (deposits) and accounts with negative balances
(loans). An individual may write a check that converts his deposit into
a loan, or he may receive a salary payment that converts his loan into a
deposit. So long as his loan does not come to exceed the maximum
permitted by the bank, there is no need to make special note of these
transactions. If his average balance in the latest period is positive,
his account will be credited with interest; if his average balance is
negative, interest will be charged to his account. Thus there will be no
reason for an individual to have both a loan and a deposit at the bank.
Since he is allowed to write checks on either a positive or a negative
account, and since the interest he pays on his negative account will be
greater than the interest he receives on his positive account, he will
be better off if he combines the two into a single account.</p>
<p>A business or government account will be handled in the same way as
an individual account.The bank will establish a schedule of rates and a
maximum loan size, and the account will be allowed to ﬂuctu- ate freely
so long as it does not become a loan larger than the maxi- mum.The
business or government can write checks against its account regardless
of whether the account has a positive or negative balance.</p>
<p>For the federal government, the interest rate charged on loans will
probably be independent of the size of the loan, since there is
virtually</p>
<p>no risk of default. And there will be no need for an individual bank
to set a maximum loan size, since it will probably be happy to loan the
government as much as it wants to borrow. The federal government will
have very large negative balances at the banks, and will use these bank
loans as a substitute for issuing bonds and notes.The total borrowing of
the federal government will be limited by Congress, just as it is today.
It will be determined by the relation between government outlays and
income from taxes and other sources. Massive government spending that is
not balanced by taxation would cause the ﬁnancial system to break
down,just as it would cause the existing ﬁnancial system to break
down.</p>
<p>Depositors will be protected in several ways. First of all, every
bank will be required to have capital equal to a certain fraction of its
loans, and any unusual losses on its loans will come out of that
capital. Second, the major banks will be so large that their loan
portfolios will be protected by vast diversiﬁcation. A default on a
single loan or on a single group of loans will not be dangerous because
it will be such a small fraction of the bank’s total portfolio. Finally,
the government may provide deposit insurance to protect against
catastrophic losses that affect a large fraction of the loans in all
banks’ portfolios.</p>
<p>Since the banks will not be restricted in making loans to businesses,
they will be able to supply the bulk of the loans that businesses need,
both short-term and long-term.There will be no reason for businesses to
borrow directly by issuing debt securities on the open market; the banks
can presumably offer loans at the same interest rate that the mar- ket
would demand, and the cost of obtaining a bank loan is likely to be less
than the cost of a public issue of debt securities. Businesses will
obtain part of their capital from bank loans, and the rest from
securities, especially common stock.There will be no ﬁxed rule about how
much of its capital a business obtains from bank loans; some businesses
will have large loans, while others will have none at all. At any time a
busi- ness can issue common stock to retire some of its loans, or expand
its loans to retire some of its common stock.</p>
<p>For the moment, let us suppose that all payments in this simpler
world are handled by check or credit card, and that currency is not
used. In this world, money does not exist.</p>
<p>An individual has no currency. He has a bank account, but there is no
distinction between demand deposits and time deposits. His</p>
<p>bank account, if it is positive, represents all of his riskless
savings. If it is negative, his bank account represents his borrowing.
His bank account together with his holdings of securities and marketable
real assets represent his total savings.</p>
<p>There is nothing in this simpler world that can meaningfully be
called a quantity of money. Some might say that the total value of all
positive bank accounts is the quantity of money. But this makes a
completely arbitrary distinction between positive and negative bank
accounts. And it means that the quantity of money will change every time
an individual transfers credit from his negative bank account to another
individual’s positive bank account. Others might say that the net value
of all bank accounts, both positive and negative, is the quan- tity of
money. But the net value of all the accounts in a bank is simply the
capital of that bank. It is equal to the assets of the bank (its loans)
minus the liabilities of the bank (its deposits).Thus, the net value of
all bank accounts is equal to the aggregate value of all bank
securities.We would hardly want to call this the quantity of money.</p>
<p>Still others might say that the value of all potential additional
loans in all accounts is the quantity of money. They would say the
quantity of money in a positive account is the balance in the account
plus the maximum amount the bank would allow the customer to borrow, and
the quantity of money in a negative account is the difference between
the maximum amount that can be borrowed and the actual amount borrowed.
But the maximum size of the loan that is set for a bank customer is
arbitrary, and is intended to keep him from intentionally spending
himself into bankruptcy. It is not intended to limit the amount of debt
he incurs that he will be able to repay. Virtually no individuals will
borrow to the maximum, because they will want to have income and
borrowing power available for future consumption. So the quantity of
money deﬁned in this way will generally have no economic meaning.</p>
<p>There are cases in which this deﬁnition of the quantity of money will
have economic meaning, however. Suppose, for example, that the maximum
loan amount for any individual is set equal to the estimated total value
of his wealth, including real assets, ﬁnancial assets, and the present
value of his future income. Then this last deﬁnition of the quantity of
money will simply be equal to the total wealth of</p>
<p>the community. Similarly, if the maximum loan amount is set at a
standard percentage of the total value of his human and non-human
wealth, this last deﬁnition of the quantity of money will be equal to a
standard percentage of the total wealth of the community. So although
the deﬁnition has economic meaning, it is not reasonable to call it the
quantity of money.</p>
<p>There are no government bonds, because the government simply borrows
from the banks in the same way that individuals and businesses borrow.
There is no qualitative difference between government loans and other
loans, so there is no reason to treat them differently. Thus, there is
no way to include government bonds as part of the quantity of money or
the quantity of near money.</p>
<p>Since there is no quantity of money to control, there is no need for
a Federal Reserve Board to control it.The banks are not restricted in
the amount they can loan by reserve requirements, so there is no need to
change their reserve positions through open market operations, or to
make changes in the rules relating reserves to total bank assets. The
banks may be subject to capital requirements, however. They may be
required to have capital equal to some minimum percentage of their
loans. But this is not a restriction on the total volume of loans that
banks can make, because they can always issue new common stock to raise
any additional amounts of capital they may need.</p>
<p>Since there is no quantity of money, it is clear that the quantity of
money cannot affect the economy of this world in any way.The quan- tity
of money cannot affect national income, employment, or the rate of
inﬂation, because it does not exist.</p>
<p>We can take one step in the direction of a more complex world by
introducing currency. The federal government will print the currency,
and will issue it to banks as requested.When a bank receives currency
from the government it will credit the government’s account by the
amount of currency received. The bank will then give the currency to
individuals as requested. When a bank gives currency to an individual
who has an account with the bank, it will simply reduce his balance by
the amount given. When a bank gives currency to an individual in
exchange for a check on another bank, it will reduce the balance of the
other bank (or increase its balance with the other bank). Thus the
amount of currency held by individuals and businesses will be</p>
<p>determined by how much it is needed for small payments. So long as
the interest rate on bank accounts is positive, an individual will want
to hold down the amount of currency that he carries, because currency
earns no interest. The amount of currency held by individuals and
business will be determined by the volume of small payments, and by the
cost and inconvenience of making payment by check or credit card.</p>
<p>The amount of currency held by banks will be determined by the
patterns of withdrawals and deposits of currency by individuals and
businesses during the day, and by the cost of making transactions with
the government. The government will issue currency or retire currency at
any time.Thus the amount of currency outstanding at any time will be
determined by the needs of individuals and businesses. There will be no
need for any federal agency to ﬁx the amount of currency
outstanding.</p>
<p>Currency alone can hardly pass for the whole of money. The quantity
of currency, in this world, will not be controlled by the central bank,
and will not inﬂuence the economy. So even when currency is added to our
model, the quantity of money can have no effect on output, employ- ment,
or prices, because the quantity of money does not exist.</p>
<p>Evolution of the Means of Payment</p>
<p>In this section I want to start with a very simple economy and build
up to the whole world without money described above. While there is no
money in that world, there is a highly developed means of pay- ment. In
the paragraphs that follow I will use the word “money” as short for
“means of payment,” without meaning to imply that a quan- tity of money
exists in any of these worlds.</p>
<p>Private Business and Commodity Money</p>
<p>In the simplest of all possible worlds there are no ﬁnancial markets
at all. Businesses are owned by individuals and may not be bought or
sold. Transactions are made through barter, which is very costly, or
through the use of some standard commodities that are compact, portable,
and don’t deteriorate rapidly. A means of payment that requires transfer
of</p>
<p>physical commodities is costly because the transfer process is
cumber- some, and is extra costly because the commodities, that have
value in other uses, must be diverted from these uses to be used as
means of payment.Transactions are expensive, and real resources must be
tied up for use in making payments.</p>
<p>Common Stock and Portfolio Money</p>
<p>As soon as we introduce any ﬁnancial market at all, we can eliminate
the inefﬁciencies of barter and commodity money. For example, suppose we
introduce common stock. We will allow an individual to sell shares in
any businesses he owns, and these shares will trade continuously on the
stock market. Shares of common stock may now be used as a means of
payment.While it may be possible to use the shares of any company that
is traded in the stock market as means of payment, it may be practical
to use a standard portfolio of stocks as the means of payment.</p>
<p>Goods may be priced in terms of a unit of account that does not
ﬂuctuate in value very much, and the means of payment may be priced in
terms of the same unit of account.Thus the dollar price of a share of
the standard portfolio will ﬂuctuate from day to day, and even from hour
to hour, while the dollar price of a commodity may be relatively stable.
This means, of course, that the price of a commodity in terms of shares
of the standard portfolio will be constantly ﬂuctuating. This is a
slight inconvenience, since it means that every business must be aware
of the current dollar price of the standard portfolio, to know how many
shares to take in payment for any item. Otherwise, this system would
have no disadvantage as a means of payment. Currency could be issued
representing shares and fractions ofa share of the standard
portfolio.The only problem would be the necessity of computing a price,
in shares of the standard portfolio, at the time of sale.This price
would simply be the dollar price of the item divided by the current
dollar price of a share in the standard portfolio.</p>
<p>Borrowing, Lending, and Note Money</p>
<p>While shares in a portfolio of common stocks would be quite satisfac-
tory as a means of payment, they would be less satisfactory as the
only</p>
<p>intangible form of wealth. We would want to introduce borrowing and
lending to provide a larger set of alternative forms of wealth, and at
the same time we get a new form of means of payment that eliminates the
disadvantage of a portfolio of common stocks.A principal reason for
introducing borrowing and lending is for the transfer of risk. Some
indi- viduals, instead of holding their wealth in common stocks that
ﬂuctuate in value, would rather lend part of their wealth to other
individuals at a ﬁxed interest rate. Other individuals would want to
borrow to increase their holdings of common stocks, if the borrowing
rate were reasonable. In effect, the individuals who lend are paying the
individuals who bor- row to take over some of their risk. The expected
return on equity of a lender will be lower than the expected return on
equity of a borrower.</p>
<p>Another reason for introducing borrowing and lending is to allow some
individuals to spend more than they are earning by borrowing against
their future income, and to allow other individuals to spend less than
they are earning, and lend the difference.</p>
<p>Business borrowing and lending adds nothing new; it is equivalent to
borrowing and lending by the owners of the business.Whatever the reason
for the borrowing and lending, we can assume that the bor- rower writes
a personal note and gives it to the lender in exchange for certain
assets. The initial lender may be simply the person from whom the
borrower wants to buy. The notes that are created by borrowing and
lending may now be used as means of payment.They are better as means of
payment than shares in a portfolio of common stocks because they do not
ﬂuctuate very much in value (assuming that they are short- term notes).
On the other hand, notes have the disadvantage that the holder of a
personal note can never be sure that it will be redeemed by the writer
at maturity. There may be a signiﬁcant risk of default, and a signiﬁcant
cost of collection of a personal note. (A note would be redeemed at
maturity either in notes of other issuers or in common stock of
equivalent value.)</p>
<p>Administration of Loans and Guaranteed Money</p>
<p>To get around the problem of default on personal notes, we can intro-
duce “banks” that serve to administer loans and guarantee personal
notes. These banks will neither make loans nor accept deposits. They</p>
<p>will simply supervise each borrower, and will guarantee that if he
doesn’t pay off his notes, they will. In return the bank would charge a
fee to cover administrative costs and the probability that a bor- rower
will default on his notes.Thus the notes would bear interest at a lower
rate than the rate paid by the borrower; the difference would be income
to the supervising bank.</p>
<p>Banks would compete by offering low fees to issuers of notes, and by
having a reputation for soundness among holders of notes that they have
guaranteed. The government might help ensure a bank’s solvency by
requiring it to have capital equal to a certain percentage of the notes
it has guaranteed. Otherwise, there would be no necessity for govern-
ment regulation of banks.</p>
<p>Payments would be made using guaranteed notes. These notes would be a
convenient, low-cost means of payment that would not ﬂuctuate in value
appreciably. But they would still have a few disad- vantages. The value
of a note would change from day to day due to the accrual of interest.
The variety of different notes would be a dis- advantage, and some notes
might be more acceptable than others. The opportunity for theft might be
great if individuals carried notes in large denominations from place to
place, unless the notes were registered. But registration might be
costly.</p>
<p>Checking Accounts and Bank Money</p>
<p>To solve these problems, we allow the banks to participate in the
payments mechanism in a unique way. Instead of remaining outstanding,
individual notes will be used only temporarily in making payments, and
will then be extinguished. Individuals will have bank accounts that will
have positive balances for lenders and negative balances for borrowers.
Banks will credit interest to accounts with positive balances and will
debit interest to accounts with negative balances. The individual will
write a note whenever he or she wants to make a payment. This note will
be either in the form of a check or in the form of a credit card
purchase receipt. The note will serve to credit the balance of the
seller and to debit his balance. It will also credit the balance of the
seller’s bank with his bank. This system will be a convenient, safe,
low-cost means of payment.</p>
<p>In none of these ﬁve worlds was there any clearly deﬁned quantity of
money. The world of private business and commodity money came closest to
having a money supply, but even there, a commodity used as means of
payment also has other uses, and it may not be clear when it is to be
counted as part of the money supply, and when it is to be counted as
involved in one ofits other uses. Once we introduce ﬁnan- cial markets,
however, and intangible means of payment, the idea of a “quantity of
money” loses its meaning.</p>
<p>In none of these ﬁve worlds was there any role for a central
bank.</p>
<p>And the only effect that the ﬁnancial sector had on the real sector
was that as we go to successively more efﬁcient means of payment, we
reduce the cost of making payments and release real resources for other
uses. In none of these worlds was there any mechanism that would cause
uncontrolled inﬂation in the absence of a central bank.</p>
<p>Evolution of Central Bank Control</p>
<p>In this section I want to build up the forms of central bank control
over the banking system that are used in the United States. It is clear
that each of these forms of control has some effect on the banking sys-
tem; but it is not clear that any of them has any signiﬁcant effect on
the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>Maximum Interest Rates on Deposits</p>
<p>In the world without money described above, deposits earn interest at
the wholesale money rate and banks earn a proﬁt on their transactions
charges. Competition will force a bank either to pay the wholesale rate
on deposits or to compensate for a lower rate by reducing trans- actions
charges. The wholesale rate will be more common, however, because a bank
offering a lower rate and lower transactions charges will tend to
attract depositors that keep small balances and have many transactions.
Such a bank would tend to lose money on its deposit business.</p>
<p>If the central bank is allowed to establish maximum interest rates on
deposits, then various distortions will be introduced. A maximum</p>
<p>interest rate on deposits is a rather odd notion in this world,
because a deposit is simply an account with a positive balance.What
sense does it make to have a maximum interest rate on deposits (positive
balances) but no maximum interest rate on loans (negative balances)?</p>
<p>If the maximum interest rate is below the natural level of the
wholesale money rate, then an imbalance between supply and demand will
be created. At that rate, many loans will seem proﬁtable, but few
deposits will come in. The economy will tend to revert to the use of
individual and business notes for borrowing and lending, rather than the
more efﬁcient use of bank accounts. Because of this imbalance between
demand for loans and supply of deposits, banks will try to evade the
maximum rates by offering services instead of money interest on
deposits. They will offer lower transactions charges, ﬁnancial assist-
ance to businesses, trust department services, and lower rates on loans.
This is rather inefﬁcient, of course, and cannot completely eliminate
the effects of maximum interest rates, but it seems to eliminate much of
the impact of maximum interest rates in the United States, at least in
normal times.</p>
<p>What would happen, though, if the maximum rates were effective on
most sources of bank deposits? No bank would be able to attract
additional funds from these sources by offering higher rates. So the
supply of these funds would be strictly limited. To keep loan demand
down to a level equal to the supply of funds, the wholesale money rate
for banks would increase until the volume of proﬁtable loans was equal
to the volume of available deposits.And this is the rate that banks
would offer to any sources of funds not subject to the maximum. The
spread between the interest rate paid on most deposits and the whole-
sale money rate would represent an extra source of proﬁt to the banks.
So they might not object strenuously to the central bank’s setting max-
imum interest rates on deposits.</p>
<p>It is sometimes claimed that if banks are not allowed to pay interest
on deposits, and if there are no reserve requirements, they will create
deposits to buy any asset with a positive expected return, thus bidding
up the prices of all assets and causing massive inﬂation. It is
claimed</p>
<p>that once a bank creates a deposit, it can never be extinguished, so
people will use it to try to buy things and will add to the inﬂationary
pressure.</p>
<p>This argument makes no sense at all. First of all, banks cannot gen-
erally own real assets (except bank buildings and equipment) or com- mon
stocks. So they cannot simply bid up the prices of these assets. What
banks can do is offer to make loans at low interest rates. In our world
of positive and negative accounts, this would not work, because it would
cause the demand for loans to exceed the supply of deposits. Recall that
a borrower in this world simply writes a check that adds to his negative
balance whenever he needs to make a payment. Making a loan does not
involve the simultaneous creation of a negative balance and a positive
balance.</p>
<p>Even in a world where checks can be written only on bank accounts
with positive balances, banks cannot offer loans at low interest
rates.When a bank creates a deposit larger than the individual wants to
hold, he can always use it to pay off some of his loan. Or he can lend
it to someone else who will pay off his bank loan. Bank deposits can
always be extinguished; they can be used to pay off bank loans. If there
are more deposits than people want to hold, the banks will discover that
their deposits are being used to pay off their loans, and the volume of
both will decline.Thus the banking system can be in equilibrium in a
world with zero interest on deposits only if the interest rates on bank
loans are high.</p>
<p>An individual bank offering lower interest rates on loans than other
banks will be able to get loan customers away from the other banks. But
to get money to lend to these customers, the bank will have to pay the
wholesale interest rate, which will be high. Thus the bank will lose
money by making these loans, and would not be tempted to do so.</p>
<p>Reserve Requirements</p>
<p>The central bank may require that each bank hold deposits at the cen-
tral bank equal to some fraction of the individual bank’s deposits or
loans. It may do this even when it does not try to inﬂuence the total
volume of bank deposits by controlling the volume of deposits with the
central bank. If the central bank pays the wholesale money rate on the
deposits of other banks with it, then this requirement will have no
effect on the banking system. But if the central bank pays a lower</p>
<p>rate than the wholesale money rate, this requirement will represent a
tax on bank deposits. This tax will mean that banks will pay less than
the wholesale rate on their deposits, too. It will cause the economy to
revert somewhat to the use of personal and business notes for borrow-
ing and lending.</p>
<p>Limited Reserves</p>
<p>If the central bank establishes reserve requirements in the form of
deposits that each bank must carry with the central bank, and sets a
rate of interest on these deposits, there will be a natural level of
reserves. The higher the reserve requirements and the lower the rate of
interest paid on reserves, the larger the tax on deposits, and the more
the econ- omy will revert to the use of personal and business notes for
borrowing and lending. If, in addition, the central bank sets a maximum
limit to the volume of reserves that is lower than the natural level of
reserves, it will cause reserves to be worth more to banks than their
face value. There is no way for the central bank to set a minimum limit
on the volume of reserves other than by changing reserve requirements
and the interest rate paid on reserves.</p>
<p>With the quantity of reserves limited to a level below its natural
level, reserves take on a value greater than their nominal value. A bank
with million on deposit with the central bank might be able to sell its
deposit to another bank for .5 million. This would increase the
effective reserve requirements and reduce the effective rate of interest
on reserves so that banks will be satisﬁed with the amount of reserves
allowed by the central bank at the “black market” price. The central
bank would have to be careful about accepting new deposits in this sit-
uation, since any deposit it accepts results in a windfall gain to the
bank making the deposit, equal to the difference between the nominal
value of the deposit and the market value of the deposit. The central
bank would have to set up a system of rationing for accepting new
deposits or for retiring existing deposits. Thus, this would be a very
cumber- some system. Since limiting reserves has the same effect on the
banking system as increasing reserve requirements or reducing the rate
of inter- est on reserves, but requires rationing of changes in
reserves, it is hard to see why this system would be used.</p>
<p>Currency Reserves</p>
<p>If a central bank deposits and currency were both allowed as
reserves, if the central bank allowed a bank to increase its deposits
with the central bank by depositing currency, and if the central bank
limited the quantity of reserves below the natural level, then a very
strange situation would be set up. Currency would be worth as much to a
bank as deposits with the central bank; in particular, currency would be
worth more than its face value to a bank. This means that banks would
offer individuals more than face value for currency. An indi- vidual
making a deposit of currency would have his account credited with the
market value of the currency rather than with the face value of the
currency. A two-price system would thus be established for all payments:
one price for payment by check (the higher price) and one price for
payment by currency (the lower price).</p>
<p>This would hardly be a desirable state of affairs. So if currency is
to be equivalent to deposits with the central bank for use as reserves,
the central bank must refrain from limiting the total supply of reserves
to a level below its natural level. The central bank can control reserve
requirements and the interest rate paid on reserves, but cannot, unless
it wants either rationing or a two-price system, control the supply of
reserves.</p>
<p>Since our present banking system allows the use of currency as
reserves, and since we do not observe that banks are willing to pay more
than face value for currency (in crediting a bank account), it seems
likely that the Federal Reserve Board does not set the maximum quantity
of reserves below its natural level. In other words, open market
operations must be ineffective. If they were effective in controlling
the quantity of reserves, then we would observe a two-price system. The
only other possibility is that there is a proﬁt opportunity that banks
have not been exploiting, in paying more than face value for currency
and central bank deposits.</p>
<p>All of these forms of central bank control tend to keep the total
volume of banking below its optimal level.They all cause the economy to
revert, in part, to the use of personal and business notes for borrow-
ing and lending.Thus they make the ﬁnancial system less efﬁcient than it
would otherwise be. Other than this, these forms of central bank control
have no effect on the economy or on the price level.</p>
<p>Monopoly Banking</p>
<p>Even in a world with just one bank, there would be no money supply
and the bank would have no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the real economy or on
prices.The bank would not be forced by competition with other banks to
offer high interest rates on deposits, but it would be inﬂu- enced by
other ﬁnancial markets. If it offered very low rates on depos- its, it
might ﬁnd that its deposits declined so much that it was more proﬁtable
to offer a higher rate and get more deposits. In any case, it is true
that such a bank would charge more for transactions, would set higher
interest rates on loans and might set lower interest rates on deposits,
than a bank in competition with other banks.</p>
<p>It would not, however, be able to cause inﬂation by bidding up asset
prices or by creating deposits that cannot be extinguished. First of
all, it would not be allowed to own real assets or common stocks. And
second, even if it were allowed to own such assets, it could not create
deposits that could not be extinguished. A bank deposit can always be
extinguished by being applied to reduction of a bank loan.</p>
<p>The Myth of Aggregate Demand</p>
<p>Those who believe that a central bank can inﬂuence the real sector of
the economy often say that it does so by affecting aggregate demand for
goods and services. In general their argument is that the central bank
can make loans easier to get or cheaper, which will expand aggre- gate
demand, and that it can make loans harder to get or more expen- sive,
which will contract aggregate demand. High aggregate demand is supposed
to lead to low unemployment but rapid inﬂation; while low aggregate
demand is supposed to lead to high unemployment but stable prices.
Sometimes this argument centers on loans that businesses use to buy
investment goods, and sometimes it centers on loans that individu- als
use to buy consumption goods.</p>
<p>What this argument overlooks is the fact that banks must have
deposits for all their loans.When a bank allows one person to borrow, it
must attract an additional deposit equal to the amount borrowed. When
one individual decides to spend more, some other individual must decide
to spend less. Borrowing must equal lending; an increase</p>
<p>in one must be balanced by an increase in the other. Thus an added
demand for consumption goods by one individual must be balanced by a
reduced demand for consumption goods by another individual. So aggregate
demand is not affected.</p>
<p>Even when the central bank is able to affect the desired balance
between consumption and investment, this does not mean that it is
thereby able to affect aggregate demand. An increase in desired saving
that is balanced by a decrease in desired consumption will leave aggre-
gate demand unchanged.The central bank can increase borrowing only if it
increases lending, and it can restrain borrowing only if it restrains
lending. Restraining borrowing and lending will cause inefﬁciencies and
misallocation of resources, but it is not clear that it will have any
effect on aggregate demand.</p>
<p>The Quantity Theory of Money</p>
<p>In a world where transactions take place by the transfer of loans and
deposits, the quantity theory has no place. As I have emphasized above,
there is no reasonable deﬁnition of the quantity of money in such a
world.</p>
<p>The quantity theory has a certain amount of plausibility in a world
where the only means of payment is a commodity such as gold. If the
supply of gold increases because new gold is found, then it seems fairly
reasonable that the prices of other goods would rise relative to the
price of gold.The quantity theory also has some plausibility in a world
where the government creates currency in massive amounts and spends it
for goods and services, as a substitute for direct taxation. However,
there is a tendency in such a world for currency to lose its ability to
serve as a means of payment. If this happens, then the quantity theory
will no longer apply.</p>
<p>As soon as we get to a world where payments are made by transfer-
ring deposits and notes, the quantity theory becomes impossible even to
formulate. Those who believe in the quantity theory are forced to argue
in terms of a world with commodity money or a world where the government
hands out massive amounts of currency or bonds, and then transfer their
conclusions to an entirely different kind of world.</p>
<p>The Liquidity Preference Theory</p>
<p>In a world where transactions take place by the transfer of loans,
depos- its, and notes, the liquidity preference theory is just as
inappropriate as the quantity theory.This is true whether we have
competitive banking or monopoly banking, and whether banks are regulated
by a central bank or are completely unregulated.</p>
<p>The general argument is similar to that of the quantity theory.</p>
<p>When people have too much “money,” they spend it, or they bid up the
prices of ﬁnancial assets, causing interest rates to fall, and
stimulating business investment.When people have too little “money,”
they reduce their spending or sell ﬁnancial assets, causing interest
rates to rise and restraining business investment.Thus too much money
increases aggre- gate demand, and too little money reduces aggregate
demand.</p>
<p>But why should people do this? If they have too much money, in either
currency or deposits, they can simply pay off their loans. If they have
no loans, they can lend their deposits to someone who does, and charge
him a little less interest than the bank would charge; he will then use
the proceeds to pay off his loans with the bank.</p>
<p>An individual can adjust his portfolio of ﬁnancial assets by trading
with other individuals and by dealing with his bank. If he wants more
currency, the bank will give it to him; if he wants less, the bank will
take it back. If he wants more demand deposits, the bank will give him a
loan (at some interest rate), and if he wants less, the bank will reduce
his loans. If the bank will not do these things, other individuals or
busi- nesses will.</p>
<p>So transactions that affect portfolio composition are purely ﬁnan-
cial; they have no impact on the real sector or on the price level.</p>
