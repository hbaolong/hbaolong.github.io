<p>General Equilibrium</p>
<p>and Business Cycles</p>
<p>Tsu, nreitf,errs yt.e</p>
<p>available to everyone at the same time. Fluctuations in the match be-
tween resources and wants across many sectors create major ﬂuctuations
in output and unemployment, because moving resources from one sector to
another is costly. Fluctuations in the demand for the services of dura-
ble goods causes much larger ﬂuctuations in the output of durables, and
causes unemployment that takes the form of temporary layoffs. Since
specialized factors cooperate in producing goods and services, it makes
sense to lay people off in groups rather than lowering wages and waiting
for them to quit. Similarly, a vacancy is created when a specialized
factor is missing from such a group. Technology comes with varying
levels of risk and expected return associated with the degree of
specialization.</p>
<p>More specialization means more severe ﬂuctuations and a higher
average level of unemployment, along with a higher average level of
output and growth. Monetary policy, interest rates, and ﬁscal policy
have no special roles to play in the model.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Business cycles are ﬂuctuations in economic activity. Most measures
of economic activity look something like a random walk with drift:
successive changes in the level of economic activity are largely inde-
pendent.1 Changes in the level of economic activity in different sec-
tors are quite highly correlated, but output of durables ﬂuctuates more
than output of non-durables. Output of durables and unemployment both
show some tendency to return, over time, to normal levels. The normal
levels of durables output and unemployment tend to change, so the path
of any measure of economic activity can be quite complex. We will take
unemployment as the variable that best captures the ﬂuc- tuations we
want to understand.2</p>
<p>General equilibrium models3 take individuals as maximizing the
expected value of a utility function, where utility depends on con-
sumption at various times of various goods and services, and on state
variables that can be taken to represent tastes.4 We will assume that
markets are complete, so we can show that one does not need incom- plete
markets to understand the major features of business cycles: this means
that the state variables representing tastes are observable, and are the
basis for some of the traded securities.5 We will include physical
investment: in fact, we will assume that a variety of technologies are
available at any time. The available technologies also depend on state
variables. Individuals bear costs in shifting their human capital from
one sector to another, and in shifting physical capital from one sec-
tor to another. These adjustment costs seem largely internal: I do not
believe that signiﬁcant externalities in this process have been clearly
identiﬁed.6</p>
<p>Thus the models in this chapter are entirely consistent with maxi-
mizing behavior on the part of individuals and ﬁrms in light of the</p>
<p>General Equilibrium and Business Cycles 155</p>
<p>information they have had and the opportunities they face.7 It hardly
makes sense, in my view, to work with models that do not assume max-
imizing behavior. At the same time, there is no easy way to test these
models or to estimate the constants in a model.8 The models I discuss
are very incomplete, and it is always very difﬁcult to use observations
of eco- nomic data to help us understand the economy. Since we do not
know the true model, correlation implies almost nothing about
causation.</p>
<p>A Multisector Model</p>
<p>It is possible to model business cycles using a model with a single
good and a single composite production sector.9 Fluctuations in economic
activity in a model like this appear as ﬂuctuations in the stock of
capital.10 Such a model, however, does not lend itself to an analysis of
unemploy- ment.To have unemployment in a model with maximizing behavior,
we need a multisector model.11</p>
<p>Both human and physical capital will be specialized, because
speciali- zation increases expected productivity. However, there are
shocks to both tastes and technology in the form of unexpected shifts in
the state vari- ables in the economy. As a result, we ﬁnd ourselves with
a capital stock whose composition is different from the composition we
would have chosen had we known in advance what the world would be like.
The match between resources and wants is not perfect.</p>
<p>We will want to shift capital from the sectors where we have too much
to the sectors where we have too little. Relative prices will moti- vate
this shift. But the less advance notice we have, the more costly it is
to shift capital between sectors.12 Also, the more different the sectors
are from one another, the more costly it is to shift capital from one to
the other.</p>
<p>Shocks that create a poor match, which will mean large shifts of
human capital between sectors, cause unemployment and a decline in
output. Shocks that create a good match will bring unemployment below
its average level and output above its average level. As resources are
shifted between sectors, the match will improve. The shocks com- bined
with the shift of resources will cause unemployment to wander</p>
<p>around its average level: when it is near its average level, its
movements will be largely random; but when it is far from its average
level, the ran- dom movements will be combined with a drift back toward
its average level. Of course, the average level will also be changing
through time as tastes and technology change.</p>
<p>Shifting resources between sectors is just one source ofunemploy-
ment. Other sources will have somewhat different behavior. Also, a shift
of resources can occur without unemployment. Job changes can occur
without an intervening period of search or waiting for a new job. This
model suggests, though, that job turnover associated with a change from
one employer to another will be higher in bad times than in good
times.</p>
<p>The more sectors there are, the more ways there are for the match to
go wrong.A model that has only consumption goods and investment goods
will not be able to generate much unemployment through this device.A
model with a single good will not produce any of this kind of
unemployment at all.</p>
<p>Similarly, no one source of uncertainty, such as uncertainty about
rel- ative prices associated with price level uncertainty, will generate
much unemployment in this model. It is the large number of partly
independ- ent shocks to different sectors that generates signiﬁcant
unemployment.</p>
<p>Unemployment generated this way will show considerable persist- ence,
because it costs less to move resources between sectors slowly than to
move them quickly.A mismatch between resources and wants will be
corrected at a rate that balances the beneﬁts of a better match against
the costs ofa faster movement of resources.</p>
<p>The government can reduce the unemployment rate by subsidiz- ing
declining sectors and taxing rising sectors, or by ordering the goods
and services produced in the declining sectors. This will improve wel-
fare only if one person’s unemployment imposes unavoidable costs on
others. The case for the existence of this kind of externality has not
been made, in my view.13</p>
<p>To make this model more concrete, let’s use a simple example with
just two sectors. Imagine that all individuals are identical, and the
world lasts for only one period.At the start of the period, an
individual chooses amounts x and y of resources 1 and 2 from a constant
elasticity</p>
<p>of transformation production frontier: 14</p>
<p>1 = (xb/c + yb/d)l/b b &gt; 1 (13.1) c&gt;0</p>
<p>d &gt; 0.</p>
<p>The individual chooses x and y knowing that his utility function will
be Cobb-Douglas, of the form</p>
<p>u = xay1-a (13.2)</p>
<p>but without knowing the exact value of a.</p>
<p>At the end of the period, the individual learns the value of a, and
has a chance to transform x into y or y into x.The terms on which the
transformation can be made take the form of another constant elasticity
of transformation production frontier that is tangent to the ﬁrst
frontier at the point x, y.The second frontier is inside the ﬁrst
frontier because last-minute changes are more costly than changes made
in advance.</p>
<p>1 = (xb<em>/c</em> + yb<em>/d</em>)1/b* b* &gt; b (13.3) c* &gt;
0</p>
<p>d* &gt; 0.</p>
<p>The ﬁnal amounts chosen, x* and y* , are determined by the point at
which the new production frontier (13.3) is tangent to the indifference
curves (13.2). It turns out that this point can be derived analytically
with no trouble. First, the values of b<em>, c</em> , and d* are
determined by:</p>
<p>1 = xb<em>/c</em> + yb<em>/d</em> , (13.4)</p>
<p>xb<em>/c</em> = xb/c, (13.5)</p>
<p>yb<em>/d</em> = yb/d. (13.6)</p>
<p>Then the values of x* and y* are determined by:</p>
<p>x<em>b</em>/c* = a, (13.7)</p>
<p>y<em>b</em>/d* = 1-a. (13.8)</p>
<p>A perfect match occurs when x* is equal to x and y* is equal to
y.</p>
<p>In that case, it would not have helped to know a in advance.That rep-
resents the maximum possible utility for the individual. The worse the
match, the lower the individual’s utility will be.</p>
<p>A Durable Goods Model</p>
<p>In addition to the process involving a match between resources and
wants across sectors, there is a process operating within any sector
that produces durable goods.This process helps explain both temporary
lay- offs and the exact form that the business cycle takes.15</p>
<p>Suppose that demand falls for the services of durable goods pro-
duced by a given sector. Since the stock of durable goods deteriorates
slowly, output of these goods will fall sharply until the stock of goods
comes more into line with demand, given the cost of producing new goods.
The decline in output will be associated with a fall in the rela- tive
price of these goods.16</p>
<p>As the stock of durables comes into line, output will gradually rise,
unless changed by a new shock to tastes or technology. Thus durables
will introduce a pattern of a sharp fall in output followed by a gradual
rise, or a sharp rise in output followed by a gradual fall. These
patterns will be added to a pattern of random changes due to new shocks,
so they will not be seen in pure form.</p>
<p>Output of durables will respond more to new information than output
of non-durables. Thus sectors producing durables should show larger
cyclical ﬂuctuations than sectors producing non-durables.</p>
<p>Moreover, some of the changes in output in a durable goods sec- tor
will be temporary. A temporary decline in output will be associated with
temporary layoffs. Thus the behavior of durable goods helps us
understand another component of unemployment.17</p>
<p>Again, let’s make the discussion more concrete by working out a
simple example. Assume that the loss of utility from having the wrong
stock of durables is proportional to the square of the difference
between the actual stock x and the target stock k, and has weight
g2.Assume that the loss of utility associated with adjusting the stock
of durables is pro- portional to the square of the rate of adjustment
x.. Assume that we can</p>
<p>ignore discounting. Finally, assume that output y is for replacement
of depreciated capital at rate qx plus adjustment of the stock of
capital at rate x..</p>
<p>Assume all individuals are identical, and want to minimize the total
loss of utility over an inﬁnite lifetime associated with a shock that
moves k away from the initial value x* of the stock x of durables.</p>
<p>Minimize: (13.9)</p>
<p>The individual chooses a path for x. that minimizes the value of this
integral. Using the calculus of variations, we ﬁnd that the solution
is:</p>
<p>x — k = (x* — k)e—gt, (13.10)</p>
<ol start="24" type="a">
<li>= —g(x* — k)e—gt, (13.11) y = qx — g(x* — k)e—gt. (13.12)</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see that a sudden change in k will cause a sudden change in y,
followed by a gradual change in y in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Unemployment</p>
<p>Unemployment, in the models outlined above, takes two forms. One form
is associated with costly shifts of human capital between sectors when
there is a poor match between resources and wants. The other is
associated with temporary layoffs when times are bad in durable goods
sectors. These two kinds of unemployment will tend to rise and fall
together, though they will not always be perfectly in phase. Output will
tend to fall when unemployment rises, and to rise when unemployment
falls. Unemployment will be countercyclical; or if we use unemploy- ment
to deﬁne the business cycle, we can say that output is procyclical.18 So
far, the models have nothing to say about why ﬁrms ﬁre or lay off</p>
<p>their employees in bad times rather than lowering wages so that the
desired number will quit. Some of the reasons are obvious. An employee
who quits will not generally be eligible for unemployment beneﬁts under
current law, so the employee and employer may agree to</p>
<p>make it an involuntary termination. An employee who has been noti-
ﬁed through a wage reduction that it’s time to think about leaving may
not be very productive: he may even do things that harm his
employer.</p>
<p>More generally, though, I think the reason lies in the fact that
production involves the cooperation of a number of people with
specialized skills. A ﬁrm cares about more than just the number of
employees.When a few key employees leave, the others may become much
less productive. Thus it is natural to close down a whole unit at once,
and to lay off or transfer essentially all the employees of that
unit.</p>
<p>The cooperative production notion may also help us understand
vacancies. When a key person has left a unit that is being kept open, or
when a key person is missing from a unit being reopened, it can be
important to ﬁnd a replacement for that person quickly. A ﬁrm will use
advertising or hiring bonuses to do it. It will not use high wages for
that person unless a person with the desired skills will receive high
wages anywhere he works.</p>
<p>Can the models outlined above help us understand why workers with
less seniority are generally laid off ﬁrst, or why young people have a
relatively high unemployment rate? I think so. Young people have more
time to recoup the costs of changing sectors, so they will favor an
arrangement that gives them higher pay than they would otherwise get in
exchange for the risk of being laid off ﬁrst in a downturn. A worker
with less seniority has fewer skills speciﬁc to the job, so a rela-
tively small decline in the sector the worker is in will make other jobs
more attractive.</p>
<p>These models do imply that in a downturn, the rate at which workers
move from one sector to another will rise. This may be hard to see at
ﬁrst, since people who are laid off may not know yet whether they will
be changing sectors or not. The number of quits may fall in a downturn,
because of a reduction in the number of vacancies (as deﬁned above) and
because people who would otherwise quit may now be laid off.This will be
especially true in sectors producing dura- ble goods.</p>
<p>Since we are assuming that markets are complete, long-term con-
tracts do not play any special role.19 It is not restrictive to have
long- term contracts available along with shorter term contracts.</p>
<p>Choice among Technologies</p>
<p>In the models outlined above, we discussed the choice among technolo-
gies only in very general terms.An individual could choose a point along
a production frontier that put resources into each of two sectors.
Sectors, however, can be deﬁned in many ways. A more specialized worker
and a less specialized worker can be taken as being in different
sectors, even though they participate in production processes with the
same outputs.</p>
<p>Specialization is associated with both risk and productivity. When
certain factors affecting tastes and technology are uncertain, there is
a risk that a specialized factor will not be wanted. On the other hand,
if it is wanted, the productivity of a specialized factor will generally
be higher than the productivity of a non-specialized factor doing the
same job. In other words, greater specialization means that when the
match between resources and wants is good, output will be very high, but
when the match is bad, output will be very low. It is very costly to
move a specialized factor from one kind of task to another.</p>
<p>Note that the risks in the use of specialized resources do not can-
cel. High demand in one sector does not offset low demand in another,
since it is costly to shift resources from the low-demand sector to the
high-demand sector. When the match is poor, output will be low and
unemployment will be high.</p>
<p>Individuals will choose investments in human and physical capital
that reﬂect their preferences. The more tolerant of risk they are, and
the more tolerant of unemployment they are, the more specialized the
chosen resources will be. Higher risk and higher unemployment will be
associated with higher expected output and growth.</p>
<p>Note that if markets are incomplete, people will be less able to
exchange risks, so they will choose less specialization, less severe
business cycles, lower output, and lower growth. Similarly, if people
have less information, a given degree of specialization will be riskier,
so they will cut back both risk and expected productivity.</p>
<p>Note also that the magnitude of ﬂuctuations in output and unem-
ployment tells us very little about welfare. Since large ﬂuctuations are
associated with rapid growth, there is no index of welfare that takes
into account only the magnitude of ﬂuctuations. The government can
dampen ﬂuctuations by taxing risk or by taxing specialization in any</p>
<p>of several ways, but this seems more likely to reduce welfare than to
increase it, because it introduces unnecessary distortions.</p>
<p>Other Matters</p>
<p>In a model with complete markets, inﬂation will play no role at all.
In the real world, inﬂation is associated with certain costs, such as
the cost of changing prices, the cost of contracting in real terms, and
the cost of economizing on the use of currency. With one exception,
these costs seem small compared to the cost of a mismatch between
resources and wants.</p>
<p>The exception is that when inﬂation turns to large deﬂation and the
nominal riskless short-term interest rate falls to zero, we have a
“currency trap.”The real interest rate is forced to be higher than it
would be in the absence of currency.This can cause major dislocations,
and I believe it was one reason for the severity of the Great
Depression.</p>
<p>I believe that monetary policy is not a cause of variations in the
rate of inﬂation.20 Even if it does inﬂuence inﬂation, though, it will
not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on business cycles under the models out-
lined above.</p>
<p>Similarly, ﬁscal policy can affect the business cycle in ways
discussed above. The government can subsidize declining sectors or buy
their output. It can tax specialization or risk-taking. It will thereby
reduce the magnitude of ﬂuctuations and the average level of
unemployment, but will probably reduce welfare at the same time because
it will distort investment choice. Similarly it can subsidize
unemployment by paying generous unemployment beneﬁts.21 Assuming that
these activities are limited, ﬁscal policy will not play a signiﬁcant
role in either increasing or decreasing the magnitude of business
cycles.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Nelson and Plosser (1981) discuss the random walk nature of

<li><p>This characterization of business cycles is close to Arrow’s
(1978, p. 160). For more extensive characterizations of business cycles
that are consistent with</p></li>

<li><p>The utility functions used in general equilibrium models are
often assumed to be state-independent. For example, Diamond (1967) uses
a state-independ- ent utility function. He notes (p. 761, n. 6) that
this is a restrictive assumption. Hirshleifer (1970,p. 220) uses
a“uniqueness” axiom to rule out state-dependent utility functions.
Phelps (1962, 1967, p. 141) uses a utility function that is independent
of both time and state. On the other hand, Fama (1970) and Feiger (1976)
use models with state-dependent utility functions. The origi- nal von
Neumann-Morgenstern (1953) axioms ensure the existence of util- ity
functions deﬁned over both states and consumption streams, but Marshak
(1950, p. 113) eliminates the state dependence in his version of the
exist- ence theorem. Lucas (1977, pp. 20, 25) includes changing tastes
as part of his theory of business cycles. Krelle (1973, esp. pp. 105–6
and pp. 1l5–16) discusses several ways in which tastes change, involving
the inﬂuence of past consumption of a good on its present and future
utility.Vickrey (1964, pp. 23–4) describes, without bringing them into
his later theories, various kinds of changes in tastes that may be
important in the behavior of an econ- omy. He mentions in particular the
conscious development of tastes, either by the individual or by
others.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of state-dependent utility functions does not imply that
taste changes are being used as a catch-all explanation for anything
that cannot otherwise be explained since tastes are taken to be
observable. I will assume that the utility function itself is constant:
at that level, tastes are constant too. Stigler (1966, p. 39) argues
that it is best to treat tastes as ﬁxed at a lower level: that it is
best to use a state-dependent utility function, in effect. Stigler and
Becker (1977, p. 76) say: “The establishment of the proposition that one
may use- fully treat tastes as stable over time and similar among people
is the central task of this essay.” But in the examples they give, it is
more the highest level utility function that is constant. They redeﬁne
commodities in a way that effectively indexes them by the state of the
world. The use of state-indexed commodities as arguments in the utility
function is equivalent to the use of a state-dependent utility function.
Pollack (1978, p. 375) notes that Stigler and Becker should be objecting
to the use of unobservables, whether of tastes or technology, rather
than to the use of taste differences and taste change.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of adjustment costs in production functions has been
formalized by Lucas (1967), Uzawa (1969), and Jorgenson (1972). The idea
that there are adjustment costs in shifting labor from one sector to
another has been devel- oped by Herberg (1972). This model has been
extended to allow for ﬁnite adjustment costs for both labor and capital
by Herberg and Kemp (1972).</p></li>
<li><p>Lucas (1975, pp. 1113–14) gives a compelling argument for using
models based on maximizing behavior.The trouble with models containing
disequilibrium or abitrary elements is that they are as unstable as the
economy itself is.The arbi- trary elements surely change, but the ways
in which they change are not speci- ﬁed in the model. And it is usually
true that if all economic agents come to have a full understanding of a
disequilibrium model, the model will no longer describe the world
correctly. Models based on the work of Keynes (1936, 1965) have such
disequilibrium elements as an interest rate that differs from the mar-
ginal product of capital, or a wage that is not free to move. Models
based on the work of Lucas (1975) depend on easily cured ignorance about
the current state of the world and on inability to create simple
securities.</p></li>
<li><p>The difﬁculties with the use of econometrics in trying to
discover the structure of the economy are discussed in Chapter 12, and
also in Pratt and Schlaifer (1982), and Leamer (1982).</p></li>
<li><p>Merton’s (1973) intertemporal capital pricing model can be used
as a model of business cycles, though he doesn’t suggest such a
use.</p></li>
<li><p>Kydland and Prescott (1978, pp. 3–4) argue plausibly that we can
characterize the elements responsible for the persistence of business
cycles as “capital-like elements.” Their discussion (p. 1) of business
cycles has at least two other features in common with the model in this
chapter: the notion that taste changes are important, and the notion
that the effects of certain kinds of shocks cannot be diversiﬁed
away.</p></li>
<li><p>Lucas and Prescott (1974, p. 190) set up a multisector model of
unemployment with stochastic demand in each market. They impose
constraints on the model that keep it from being a model of business
cycles. Hayek (1939) includes as part of his theory the notion that
specialization of labor in the presence of uncertainty is one cause of
ﬂuctuations in employment. Kydland (1980) has a real business cycle
model in which costs of adjustment between sectors are
important.</p></li>
<li><p>Alchian (1959) discusses the relation between production cost and
such factors as the amount of time available for planning the production
run.</p></li>
<li><p>Diamond (1981) discusses some possible external effects of this
kind.</p></li>
<li><p>Powell and Gruen (1968) discuss this kind of production
frontier.</p></li>
<li><p>The role played by intermediate goods in Long and Plosser (1982)
is similar to the role played in this model by durable goods. Kydland
and Prescott’s (1981) “time to build” also involves the effects of
durable goods. Sargent (1979, pp. 160–</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="70" type="1">
<li>has an equilibrium theory of layoffs in which “sticky” wages play a
role.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>This kind of argument is standard in accelerator models. For a
traditional dis- cussion of the accelerator in business cycle theory,
see Hicks (1946, esp. pp. 299–302). Lucas (1977, p. 23) has a more
modern description. Durable goods also play an important role in Kydland
and Prescott’s (1980)“competitive theory of ﬂuctuations.”</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, it is not necessary to assume non-separable
utility. Barro and King (1982) discuss the differences between models
with separable and non- separable utility. Durable goods play an
important role in their models, too.</p></li>
<li><p>In Long and Plosser (1982), unemployment will tend to rise when
output rises if producers switch inputs more easily than consumers
switch between consumption of the commodity and consumption of
leisure.</p></li>

see Burdett and Mortensen (1980).</p></li>

2. For an alternate view of monetary policy in a real business cycle
model, see King and Plosser (1982).</p></li>
<li><p>Benjamin and Kochin (1979, p. 474) state:“We have shown that the
