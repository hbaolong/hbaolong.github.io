<p>behavior, but they have generally continued to assume that
expectations about the rate ofinﬂation are formed in an irrational
manner. Following Cagan (1956), they typically assume some form of
adaptive expectations, even when some other rule for revising
expectations would give more accurate results.</p>
<p>In a model that does not include uncertainty in some explicit form, a
straightforward way to put in rational expectations is to assume that
individuals and ﬁrms have perfect foresight. One can then look at the
set of paths for all economic variables such that each individual is
max- imizing his or her utility and each ﬁrm is maximizing its value, at
every point in time, in the light of the current and future values of
all the variables. Each such path is a “competitive equilibrium”
consistent with rational economic behavior.2</p>
<p>In a world with well-developed ﬁnancial markets, it is not easy to
describe a mechanism by which changes in monetary policy or changes in
the money supply itself will lead to changes in the price level or rate
of inﬂation.3 The problem is similar to the one we encounter in general
equilibrium models of exchange. There it is difﬁcult to describe the
mechanism by which a set of prices is determined at which everyone can
exchange his endowment for a preferred collection of goods, and such
that the total demand for each good equals the supply. The solu- tion
adopted in that case is simply to ignore the mechanism by which
equilibrium is achieved, and to investigate the existence and uniqueness
of a set of prices and an allocation of goods that equates total demand
and total supply of each good, and that gives each individual goods
worth the same as his initial endowment. Under certain conditions there
will be only one such competitive equilibrium, and it is plausi- ble to
assume that the economy would reach that equilibrium, even though we
cannot specify the exact process by which it is reached.</p>
<p>Those who believe that the money supply can be and is deter- mined by
the central bank in a modern economy might like to use this same
technique. Since it is difﬁcult to describe a mechanism by which a given
monetary policy will cause an economy of rational individu- als to
follow a certain path, they might like to sidestep the description of
such a mechanism, and ask about the existence of a unique path for the
economy consistent with the given monetary policy. Finding that there is
only one competitive equilibrium path consistent with a</p>
<p>Monetary Growth Models 67</p>
<p>given monetary policy will not prove that the given policy will cause
the economy to follow that path, but such a ﬁnding would allow us to
concentrate our attention on that path and its properties. Finding that
there are many paths consistent with a given monetary policy will make
this technique useless.We will have to go back to the search for a
mechanism for the transmission of monetary policy to determine which, if
any, of these paths will be followed.</p>
<p>Brock (1972) has taken this approach in a model of an economy in
which everyone lives for the same period (which may be inﬁnite), and in
which money is the only store of wealth. He ﬁnds that, if the money
stock is assumed to be constant through time, there is only one path for
the price level and other variables along which the conditions for
equilib- rium are always satisﬁed. (It is a path along which the price
level is con- stant.) On the other hand, he ﬁnds that an attempt to
satiate the economy with real balances by decreasing nominal balances at
a certain rate will often be consistent with a whole range of paths for
the price level and other variables.Thus in one case he ﬁnds a unique
perfect foresight path consistent with a given monetary policy, and in
another case he does not.</p>
<p>I believe that perfect foresight is the only assumption consistent
with rational behavior in a model without uncertainty. It may be that,
if the monetary authorities control the money stock, the best model for
their behavior is one in which only random changes in the money stock
occur. If this is true, then it is likely that the economy would operate
more smoothly if the authorities changed to a policy of zero or constant
growth in the money stock. However, it is interesting to ask what would
happen if there were non-random elements in monetary policy. For
example, it would be interesting to know the consequences of a policy
that involves changing the rate of growth of the money sup- ply in
response to such economic variables as the rate of inﬂation and the
level of perceived unemployment. In this chapter, we will be con- cerned
primarily with monetary policies that are responsive to changes in the
past rate of inﬂation. For this purpose, the explicit inclusion of
uncertainty in the model will only complicate the analysis.</p>
<p>It has already been noted that, if individuals form expectations
about the rate ofinﬂation rationally, and if inﬂation has a negative
effect on the demand for money, then there may be many paths for the
price level consistent with a constant rate of growth in the money
stock.4</p>
<p>For each initial price level, there is a different path. Most of
these paths involve a constantly increasing or decreasing rate of
inﬂation.</p>
<p>Sargent and Wallace deal with these issues in a model assuming
perfect foresight (1973b) and in a model including an explicit form of
uncertainty (1973a).They imagine that a new monetary policy has just
been announced, and that, after the economy adjusts to the announce-
ment, no further changes in policy will take place. They assume that the
price level can jump following the announcement of a new mon- etary
policy. In the case of perfect foresight, there can be no further jumps
in the price level, since a jump that is foreseen will imply a zero (if
the jump is up) or inﬁnite (if the jump is down) demand for money at the
time of the jump. Their models are at a more aggregated level than those
of Brock (1972): while their models are consistent with maximizing
behavior on the part of individuals, they do not write down individual
utility functions explicitly. They write the aggregate demand for money
as a function of the price level and the current rate of inﬂation. They
note that there may be many paths consistent with a policy of constant
growth in the money supply, but that all but one of these involve a
continually increasing or decreasing rate of inﬂation. They rule out
such paths as being “unreasonable.” Thus, for each mon- etary policy
that they consider, there is a unique subsequent path for the price
level such that equilibrium conditions are always satisﬁed and such that
the rate ofinﬂation is bounded.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will also use an aggregate demand for money
function, and will assume that the demand for money depends on present
and possibly future values for the price level and rate of inﬂation. A
more complete model might assume that the demand for money depends on
present and possibly future values of the nominal interest rate rather
than the rate of inﬂation. However, instead of assuming that the entire
path for the money stock is speciﬁed at the time a new mon- etary policy
is announced, we will generally assume that the rate of growth of the
money stock is made a function of the rate ofinﬂation in the period just
past.</p>
<p>In particular, we will assume that the rate of growth of the money
supply is a multiple greater than one of the past rate of inﬂation. An
increase in the rate of inﬂation is met with an even larger increase in
the rate of growth of the money stock, and a decrease in the rate</p>
<p>of inﬂation is met with a larger decrease in the rate of growth of
the money stock.5 We do not mean to imply that this is a policy that is
used or should be used by the central bank. But, if you believe that the
central bank can control the money stock, this is one type of policy
that it might choose. If the equilibrium path for the price level
consistent with a monetary policy of this kind is not unique, then the
approach of selecting the unique economic path consistent with a given
monetary policy seems unsatisfactory.We will be forced back to
investigations of the mechanism by which monetary policy might affect
the economy.</p>
<p>The Basic Model</p>
<p>We will assume that changes in the money stock and the price level
are independent of changes in real factors such as the level of
employment and the rate of consumption.6 We will assume that the
population is stable.We will write Pt for the price level at time t, and
Mt for the aggre- gate nominal money stock at time t. In this ﬁrst
model, we will assume that the money stock is constant, so we will write
it simply as M.</p>
<p>Following Sargent and Wallace (1973b), we will write the demand for
real balances as a simple function of the next period’s rate
ofinﬂation:</p>
<p>log(M/Pt) = — βlog(Pt+1/Pt). (4.1)</p>
<p>In equation (4.1), β is positive. Replacing t by t—1 in equation
(4.1), we get equation (4.2):</p>
<p>log(M/Pt—1) = — βlog(Pt /Pt—1). (4.2)</p>
<p>Subtracting equation (4.2) from equation (4.1), we get:</p>
<p>log(Pt /Pt—1) = β〔log(Pt+1/Pt) — log(Pt /Pt—1)〕. (4.3)</p>
<p>Now let us deﬁne yt as the log of the ratio of two price levels. It
is similar to a rate of inﬂation.</p>
<p>yt = log(Pt +1/Pt). (4.4)</p>
<p>Substituting from deﬁnition (4.4) in equation (4.3), we have:</p>
<p>yt-1 = β(yt - yt-1). (4.5)</p>
<p>Collecting the terms involving yt-1, and dividing through by β, this
becomes:</p>
<p>yt = (1 + 1/β)yt-1. (4.6)</p>
<p>The solution to equation (4.6) may be written:</p>
<p>yt = (1 + 1/β)ty0. (4.7)</p>
<p>In other words, if the initial value of y0 is positive, the rate
ofinﬂa- tion increases exponentially. If the initial value of y0 is
negative, the rate of deﬂation increases exponentially over time.
Setting t = 0 in equation (4.1), we may write:</p>
<p>y0 = -log(M/P0 )/β . (4.8)</p>
<p>Thus, for every initial value of P0, equation (4.8) gives an initial
value of y0, and equation (4.7) gives the complete path of the rate of
inﬂation. There is a price level path consistent with every possible
choice of the initial price level.</p>
<p>Intuitively, what is happening is that the higher the initial price
level, the lower is the initial level of real balances, thus the higher
the initial rate of inﬂation must be for the demand for real balances to
equal the supply. But a high rate of inﬂation means that the supply of
real balances will be decreasing over time, which means that the rate
ofinﬂation must continue to increase if demand is always to equal the
supply.This gives an accelerat- ing rate of inﬂation. If the initial
price level is low, then the initial rate of inﬂation will be negative,
and we will have an accelerating rate of deﬂation.</p>
<p>Only if the initial price level is consistent with a zero rate of
inﬂation will the price level be constant through time. If we say that
the demand for money function described by equation (4.1) breaks down
for very large rates of inﬂation or deﬂation, then we can rule out all
paths but this one as being inconsistent with rational behavior and
perfect foresight.</p>
<p>Adaptive Monetary Policy</p>
<p>Now let us assume that, instead of specifying a constant money stock,
we increase the money stock over the next period at a rate that depends
on last period’s rate ofinﬂation:</p>
<p>log(Mt+1/Mt ) = klog(Pt/Pt一1), k &gt; 1. (4.9)</p>
<p>Assuming that k &gt; 1 means assuming that an increase or decrease in
the rate of inﬂation is followed by a greater increase or decrease in
the rate of growth of the money stock. Let us deﬁne xt as a measure of
the rate of growth of the money stock as follows:</p>
<p>xt = log(Mt+1/Mt ). (4.10)</p>
<p>Let us rewrite equation (4.1), putting a time subscript on the money
stock:</p>
<p>log(Mt/Pt ) = 一βlog(Pt+1/Pt), β &gt; 1. (4.11)</p>
<p>By assuming β &gt; 1, we are assuming that the demand for money is
“sufﬁciently sensitive” to the rate of inﬂation. Putting t +1 for t in
equation (4.11), we have:</p>
<p>log(Mt+1/Pt+1) = 一βlog(Pt+2/Pt+1). (4.12)</p>
<p>Subtracting equation (4.12) from equation (4.11), we get:</p>
<p>log(Mt+1/Mt) 一 log(Pt+1/Pt)</p>
<p>= 一β〔log(Pt+2/Pt+1) 一 log(Pt+1/Pt)〕. (4.13)</p>
<p>Substituting from deﬁnitions (4.4) and (4.10) in equation (4.13), we
get:</p>
<p>xt 一 yt = 一β(yt+1 一 yt). (4.14) Substituting in equation (4.9), we
get:</p>
<p>xt 一 kyt一1. (4.15)</p>
<p>Substituting from equation (4.15) in equation (4.14), we have:</p>
<p>kyt—1 — yt = —β(yt+1 — yt). (4.16)</p>
<p>Equation (4.16) may be rewritten as follows:</p>
<p>βyt+1 — (1 + β)yt + kyt—1 = 0. (4.17)</p>
<p>Equation (4.17) is a second-order, linear, difference equation. The
standard method for solving such an equation is to look for two solu-
tions of the form yt = λt.The general solution will be a linear combi-
nation of these two speciﬁc solutions. Substituting that expression for
yt into equation (4.17), and dividing through by λt—1, we have:</p>
<p>βλ2 — (1 + β)λ + k = 0. (4.18)</p>
<p>The solutions to the quadratic equation (4.18) are given by:</p>
<p>(4.19)</p>
<p>When k = 1, the two solutions are 1/β and 1.When k &gt; 1, both
solutions are either between zero and one or complex. If they are com-
plex, their real parts are both between zero and one.</p>
<p>Thus, when β &gt; 1 and k &gt; 1, λ1t and λ2t both converge to zero.
The general solution to equation (4.17) may be written as follows:</p>
<p>yt — a1λ1t + a2λ2t. (4.20)</p>
<p>This means that yt also converges to zero as t gets large. No mat-
ter what its initial value, the rate of inﬂation goes to zero along a
price level path consistent with the given monetary policy.</p>
<p>To complete our speciﬁcation of the monetary policy, we must give
values for M0 and M1. We can choose an initial price level, P0,
arbitrarily. Then equations (4.10) and (4.11) give the initial values x0
and y0. Putting t = 0 in equation (4.20), we get:</p>
<p>a1 + a2 = y0. (4.21)</p>
<p>Putting t = 0 in equation (4.14), rearranging, and substituting from
equation (4.20) with t = 1, we get:</p>
<p>β(a1 λ1 + a2 λ2) — (1 + β)y0 + x0 = 0. (4.22)</p>
<p>Given the values of x0, y0, β , λ1, and λ2, equations (4.21) and
(4.22) allow us to solve for a1 and a2.</p>
<p>Thus, for the given monetary policy, including a choice of M0 and M1,
each choice of an initial price level gives us a different price level
path consistent with perfect foresight and with continual equilibrium in
the money market. Furthermore, each of these paths converges to a zero
rate of inﬂation, so none can be ruled out on the grounds that the rate
of inﬂation is unbounded.</p>
<p>With an adaptive monetary policy of this kind, neither the initial
price level nor the future path of the price level is determined
uniquely by the assumption of rational behavior. And all of the possible
paths, except those with very large or very small values of P0, are
reasonable.</p>
<p>Future Rates of Inﬂation and Money Demand</p>
<p>So far, we have assumed that the demand for money depends only on the
current price level and next period’s rate of inﬂation. It is reason-
able to suppose, however, that the demand for money might depend on the
anticipated rates of inﬂation for other periods as well. Most gener-
ally, it might depend on all future rates of inﬂation.</p>
<p>To illustrate the properties of such a model, let us assume a money
demand function of the following form:</p>
<p>This means that more distant future rates of inﬂation affect the
demand for money less than nearer rates of inﬂation.We will continue to
assume that monetary policy is given by equation (4.9) or (4.15),
together with values for M0 and M1. Putting t + 1 for t in equation
(4.23), and changing the range ofs, we have:</p>
<p>丫s—1log (4.24)</p>
<p>Substituting from deﬁnition (4.4), and pulling (1/丫) out of the
summation, we have:</p>
<p>丫syt+s. (4.25)</p>
<p>The summation can be rewritten, to give:</p>
<p>(4.26)</p>
<p>But the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (4.26) can be rewrit-
ten, using equation (4.23), to give:</p>
<p>log(Mt+1/Pt+1) = (1/丫) log(Mt/Pt ) + (β/丫)yt. (4.27)</p>
<p>Putting t — 1 for t in equation (4.27), and subtracting the resulting
equation from equation (4.27), we get:</p>
<p>xt — yt = (1/丫)(xt—1 — yt—1) + (β/丫)(yt — yt—1). (4.28) Multiplying
through by 丫, and rearranging, we get:</p>
<p>丫xt — xt—1 — (丫 + β)yt + (1 + β)yt—1 = 0. (4.29)</p>
<p>Substituting from equation (4.15), we get:</p>
<p>丫kyt—1 — kyt—2 — (丫 + β)yt + (1 + β)yt—1 = 0. (4.30)</p>
<p>Equation (4.30) rearranges to:</p>
<p>(丫 + β)yt — (1 + β + 丫k)yt—1 + kyt—2 = 0. (4.31)</p>
<p>Again we have a second-order, linear, difference equation. If it has
two basic solutions that both converge, then we know that we will again
have a whole family of reasonable price paths consistent with the given
monetary policy. To ﬁnd the basic solutions, we put yt = λt, and divide
through by λt—2:</p>
<p>(丫 + β)λ2 — (1 + β + 丫k)λ + k = 0. (4.32)</p>
<p>The solutions to equation (4.32) are given by:</p>
<p>λ = 〔1 + β + 丫k ± √———–——-〕/2 (丫 + β).</p>
<p>(4.33)</p>
<p>Writing √ for 丫 + β , and setting k = 1, this becomes:</p>
<p>(4.34)</p>
<p>The two values of λ under these circumstances are 1 and l/α . By
taking the derivative of equation (4.33) with respect to k, it can be
shown that increasing k causes both roots to be less than one. But, for
very large values of k and any positive value of 丫, one root will be
greater than one. So it is values of k moderately larger than one that
will give two values for λ, both between zero and one.</p>
<p>For a monetary policy with a value of k in this range, there will
again be a reasonable price level path for every value of P0 that is not
too large or too small. Even though the demand for money depends on
future as well as current rates of inﬂation, the price level path
consistent with a given monetary policy of the type we are considering
will not be unique.</p>
<p>Uncertainty</p>
<p>The lack of uniqueness that we have found for perfect foresight paths
seems likely to carry over to the case of a model including uncer-
tainty, since certainty is the limiting case of uncertainty as the
degree of uncertainty goes to zero.To verify this, let us look at a
simple model involving uncertainty.</p>
<p>We will assume that the price level path follows a stochastic process
described by the following equation:</p>
<p>log(t+1/Pt) = N(μt, σt2 ). (4.35)</p>
<p>In other words, t+1/Pt is distributed lognormally with parameters</p>
<p>μt and σt2.</p>
<p>We will assume that the demand for money depends on both of the
parameters of this distribution, as follows:</p>
<p>log(Mt/Pt) = —βμt — 丫σt2, β &gt; 0, 丫 &gt; 0. (4.36)</p>
<p>We will continue to assume that monetary policy is described by
equation (4.9) plus the values of M0 and M1.</p>
<p>The stochastic process generating the path of prices will be speciﬁed
if we give a rule for determining all of the values of μt and σt2.There
are a variety of ways in which this could be done. For example, we might
choose arbitrary values for σ02, σ12, σ22, . . . going on forever. We
can choose an arbitrary value for P0, and equation (4.36) will give an
initial value for μ0. After P1 is determined by a “drawing,” equation
(4.36) will give μ1.A new drawing gives P2, and equation (4.9) gives M2.
This determines the stochastic path of Pt.</p>
<p>We might also take the values of μ0, μ1, μ2, . . . going on forever
to be arbitrary, and use equation (4.36) to determine the values of σt2.
Again we can choose P0 arbitrarily, along with all of the values of μt.
It is clear that we are working with a family of paths that has an inﬁ-
nite number of parameters that can be chosen arbitrarily. The lack of
uniqueness of the process generating the price level path is even worse
if we introduce uncertainty.</p>
<p>Note that we have assumed in this analysis that the parameters of the
process generating the price level are always known to individuals. Thus
they are assumed to form their expectations about the future of the
price level in a rational manner.</p>
<p>Adaptive Expectations</p>
<p>Those who construct models that do not assume rational economic
behavior often use a device called “adaptive expectations.” In a
discrete model, this means assuming that next period’s expected rate of
inﬂation log(Pt+1/Pt )e is determined by an equation of the following
type:</p>
<p>log(Pt+1/Pt)e — log(Pt /Pt—1)e</p>
<p>= 丫〔log(Pt /Pt—1) — log(Pt /Pt—1)e〕, 丫 &lt; 1. (4.37)</p>
<p>In other words, it is assumed that the expected rate of inﬂation is
revised by an amount proportional to the error in last period’s expected
rate of inﬂation.</p>
<p>This method of revising expectations is almost always irrational.7 It
means that, if the rate of inﬂation goes to a new level and stays there,
the expected rate of inﬂation will approach that level only
gradually.The expected rate of inﬂation will be consistently higher or
lower than the actual rate of inﬂation.</p>
<p>In a model using this device, the demand for real balances is usu-
ally written as a function of the expected rate of inﬂation, such as the
following:</p>
<p>log(Mt /Pt) = —βlog(Pt+1/Pt )e. (4.38)</p>
<p>Now what happens when a change in monetary policy is announced? These
models usually assume that the expected rate of inﬂation continues to be
revised according to equation (4.37), and that information about the new
monetary policy does not inﬂuence the expected rate of inﬂation at all.
This is clearly not a reasonable way to revise one’s expectations.</p>
<p>But, even if we assume that the announcement causes no change in the
expected rate of inﬂation, we do not have enough information to
determine the price path in the future.The announcement will in general
cause the actual price level to start out at a new level.The comparison
of this new level with the level that was expected under the old
monetary policy is not a reasonable thing to use in revising our
expectations, so we cannot use equation (4.37) to make the ﬁrst revision
in our expected rate of inﬂation.We have no rational basis for choosing
the ﬁrst revision. For each choice we make, we get a different price
path for the future.</p>
<p>Again, there are many paths for the price level consistent with a
newly announced monetary policy.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Our results can be stated intuitively as follows. When a new mone-
tary policy is announced, there are many combinations of a new price
level and rate of inﬂation that will make individuals happy to hold
the</p>
<p>existing stock of real balances. Suppose, for example, that the new
mon- etary policy includes an immediate doubling of the nominal stock of
money.There are many jumps in the price level that would be consist- ent
with this.The price level may double, with no change in the rate of
inﬂation. Or the price level may more than double, causing a decline in
real balances, and the rate of inﬂation may increase, causing an appro-
priate reduction in the demand for real balances. Finally, the price
level may less than double, and the rate ofinﬂation may decrease,
causing an increase in real balances and an equal increase in the demand
for real balances.</p>
<p>If we must choose among these possibilities, the second seems the
most plausible. An upward jump in the price level means that the rate of
inﬂation becomes very large. To say that the rate of inﬂation gets very
large and then goes back to exactly the level it had before the jump
seems very odd. It seems more likely that it might settle back to a
level higher than the original level.</p>
<p>The important conclusion, however, is that the assumption of rational
behavior alone does not allow us to choose one from among the many
possible paths. We do not have a single competitive equi- librium, as we
often do in a non-monetary growth model.8 We have many competitive
equilibria. Thus we cannot ignore the mechanism by which monetary policy
supposedly inﬂuences the price level and other economic variables.We
need a detailed microeconomic model of a monetary economy to have any
hope of being able to decide which, if any, of these paths the economy
follows.</p>
<p>The monetary policies discussed in this chapter are all compara- ble
to the “active” monetary policies discussed in Chapter 2. Thus the lack
of uniqueness discussed here is not the same as the indeterminacy of the
price level in some models that assume “passive” monetary pol- icy. The
basic monetary policy examined in this chapter, where next period’s
growth in the money stock depends on last period’s inﬂation, could be
said to imply an “endogenous” money supply, but it assumes that the
central bank can ﬁx the money supply in response to what- ever economic
variables it wants to use. Passive monetary policy, on the other hand,
means that the central bank has no inﬂuence on the money stock; and that
changes in the money stock are caused entirely by changes in the demand
for money.</p>

but he assumes away this possibility by stating that the price level
must depend only on real factors plus the money stock, and cannot depend
on past rates of inﬂation.</p></li>
<li><p>Muth (1961) has shown that adaptive expectations can be rational
in a dis- crete time model if there is just the right amount of
