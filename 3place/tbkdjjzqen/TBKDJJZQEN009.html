<p>What a Non-Monetarist</p>
<p>Thinks</p>
<p>believe that in a country like the US, with a smoothly working
ﬁnancial system, the government does not, cannot, and should not control
the money stock in any signiﬁcant way. The government does, can only,
and should simply respond passively to shifts in the pri- vate sector’s
demand for money. Monetary policy is passive, can only be passive, and
should be passive. The pronouncements and actions of the Federal Reserve
Board on monetary policy are a charade. The Board’s monetary actions
have almost no effect on output, employment, or inﬂation.</p>
<p>There aren’t many of us around these days. There’s only one other
person I know of who takes a position almost as strong as mine.There
were lots of non-monetarists in eighteenth-century England, but they are
gone. The most common positions these days are exempliﬁed by Friedman
and Keynes. Friedman believes that monetary policy is a very</p>
<p>100 b u s i n e s s c y c l e s a n d e q u i l i b r i u m</p>
<p>effective tool for controlling the economy: so powerful that it is
more likely to be used badly than to be used well. He recommends a
steady growth in the money stock.</p>
<p>Keynes believed, and many living economists seem to believe, that
both monetary and ﬁscal policy are powerful tools for doing good or evil
in the economy. They believe in monetary ease, mon- etary restraint, tax
cuts, deﬁcit spending, and trying to get consum- ers to spend more when
the economy seems to have slack. Some</p>
<p>of these people even believe that wage and price controls, properly
applied at the right times, will have magical restorative effects on the
economy.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with either of these positions. I don’t think any
aggre- gate government policies have much ofan impact on the economy.
But while some of these policies have at least modest effects of some
sort, monetary policy has almost no effect at all. Monetary policy might
as well not be formulated.</p>
<p>What the Government Can’t Do</p>
<p>I believe that, so long as ﬁnancial markets are working smoothly, the
government cannot control the money stock. If one arm of the government
gives the private sector base money that it doesn’t want, another arm of
the government must be taking back an equal amount.</p>
<p>If the government doesn’t control the money stock, then it can’t
control the economy in any way through control of the money stock. It
can’t control the price level or the rate of inﬂation. It can’t make
individuals spend more or spend less on current consumption. It can’t
change the interest rates that ﬁrms use in making investment decisions,
or the level of the stock market, so it can’t change invest- ment
decisions either. Since the government can’t control consump- tion or
investment, it certainly can’t control anything that we might call
“aggregate demand.”And the level of employment or unemploy- ment will
change in ways that have nothing to do with government monetary
policy.</p>
<p>What a Non-Monetarist Thinks 101</p>
<p>What the Government Can Do</p>
<p>One thing the government can do is to use a monetary policy that is
actually passive without seeming to be passive. The Federal Reserve
System can allow variations in borrowed reserves to offset its open
market operations, so that total reserves are supplied passively. The
Treasury can vary its securities offerings to offset Federal Reserve
open market operations that don’t ﬁt passive monetary policy. Or the
Federal Reserve can simply use open market operations only to keep a
target like net borrowed reserves in line.</p>
<p>The government might also adopt an openly passive monetary pol- icy.
It might say that monetary policy is not being used to try to inﬂu- ence
the economy, and that it stands ready to exchange currency or reserves
and government securities freely at prices that reﬂect market interest
rates.</p>
<p>While the government can’t control the amount of credit in the
economy through open market operations, it can control the amount of
borrowing and lending in other ways. Reserve requirements act like a tax
on lending in the form of bank deposits. Taxes on interest income are
not always fully offset by the deductibility of interest expense. Margin
requirements are effective for some investors, and thus prevent some
bor- rowing and lending that would otherwise have been done. Usury laws
and deposit rate ceilings interfere with borrowing and lending when the
natural borrowing and lending rates are above the ceilings. Both laws
and rules prohibit certain kinds of loans by ﬁnancial institutions that
are thought to be too risky. All of these things restrict the amount of
credit in the economy.</p>
<p>Restricting credit is the same as restricting borrowing, and
restrict- ing borrowing is the same as restricting lending. The effects
of restric- tions on borrowing are to put a premium on securities and
investments that have built-in leverage. High-risk securities have
higher prices and lower expected returns than they would otherwise have;
low-risk secu- rities have lower prices and higher expected returns than
they would otherwise have. Risky real investments are encouraged, while
safe real investments are discouraged. Any changes in the restrictions
on credit will cause changes in the relative prices of high-and low-risk
securities.</p>
<p>Note, though, that none of this is the sort of thing the government
says it is doing when it varies the restrictions on credit.</p>
<p>Another thing the government can do is to vary the structure of
interest rates. In some ways, this is analogous to what it can do to
vary the structure of expected returns on risky securities by varying
its con- trols on credit.The government cannot raise or lower interest
rates gen- erally, but it can raise some and lower others.</p>
<p>For example, the government can set rates on Treasury bills that are
lower than normal by selling relatively small quantities. They will tend
to be bought by people who have limited alternatives in the short run.
But the government will have to offset this by offering other Treasury
securities at higher-than-normal interest rates so that the outstanding
government debt will continue to be ﬁnanced.</p>
<p>If the government continues to try to set short-term rates low and
long-term rates high, it will ﬁnd that its short-term securities are
held by fewer and fewer investors, while its long-term securities have
to take up the slack. “Institutional factors” and “inertia” can allow
the govern- ment to move the rates quite far before demand for the
low-rate secu- rities is close to zero, and before demand for the
high-rate securities exceeds the supply. The government will lose money
in this operation, though, so it may not want to keep it going too
long.</p>
<p>Similarly, the government can change interest rates on private secu-
rities by buying or selling them, but it must at the same time move
rates on public securities in the opposite direction. It can sell
govern- ment bonds at low prices to get the money to buy private bonds
at artiﬁcially high prices.</p>
<p>It’s popular now to talk about the government’s effect on the federal
funds rate.Again, the government can move that rate, but only by mov-
ing some other rate in the opposite direction. If the government offers
to lend the banks unlimited amounts on a one-day basis at 2 percent,
then the federal funds rate won’t be able to get much above 2 percent,
and other short-term rates will be affected too. But the government may
ﬁnd itself making massive loans, and having to issue enormous amounts of
government securities at higher-than-market rates to get the money for
these loans. Since the government will lose by the spread between its
borrowing and lending rates, it’s not likely to keep this up.</p>
<p>Strangely, all this means that the government can control the stock
of any particular kind of interest-bearing government liability. It can
make</p>
<p>the stock of Treasury bills go down by offering low rates, so long as
it offsets that by increasing the stock of some other kind of
interest-bearing government liability. It is only the stock of
non-interest-bearing govern- ment liabilities that the government can’t
control.And that’s because the government doesn’t control the interest
rate on such liabilities.</p>
<p>Actually, of course, fooling around with the interest rates on
various kinds of government securities does have some effect on the
private sector’s demand for money. So this sort of activity does give
the gov- ernment an indirect way to inﬂuence the money stock. But it
would not give the government any signiﬁcant control over important eco-
nomic matters, so we would still think of monetary policy as
passive.</p>
<p>What would happen if the government decided it just wouldn’t be
passive, and started pulling or pushing on the money supply without
letting up? Something would clearly have to give. The ﬁnancial sys- tem
would break down in some way. One possibility is hyperinﬂation, where
ﬁnancial markets are simply not in equilibrium, and it would be unfair
to say that an individual is happy with his asset holdings at any point
in time (if he holds any money). Another possibility is a “two- price
system,” where prices in terms of the currency that the govern- ment is
manipulating differ from prices in terms of other currencies. This is
rather common, as when paper currencies trade at a discount in terms of
gold, or when currency that can be used for foreign invest- ment trades
at a premium relative to currency that can’t.</p>
<p>What Does Move the Money Stock?</p>
<p>If the government doesn’t directly inﬂuence the money stock, what
does?</p>
<p>All the factors that affect the demand for money affect the money
stock. For example, increasing dollar income and consumption gener- ally
means an increasing demand for money.This will be true whether the
increase comes from higher real income or higher prices.</p>
<p>Higher wealth may be one factor that leads to higher consumption, and
an increase in the level of the stock market generally means higher
wealth. So we may ﬁnd that the money stock goes up when the stock market
goes up.</p>
<p>Other things equal, higher nominal interest rates mean a higher cost
of holding money, and thus a lower money stock. At least this is</p>
<p>true of currency and other components of the money stock that don’t
bear interest at market rates. If demand deposit interest rates are not
restricted, then demand deposits may be unaffected by changes in
interest rates.</p>
<p>Some Reasons for Thinking This Way</p>
<p>Why am I a non-monetarist? My reasons are mostly theoretical rather
than empirical. In fact, they almost have to be theoretical, because I
haven’t been able to think of any empirical test, short of using the
Federal Reserve System for experiments, that would show whether I’m
right or some other school is right.</p>
<p>The basic problem with existing theory is that I have never seen a
model ofa monetary economy that was consistent with the notion that
markets are in continual equilibrium and that expectations are formed
rationally, and that allowed for the government to control the money
stock. All the models I have seen imply that someone with the model will
be able to make proﬁts at the expense of the people whose actions are
being modelled.At best, such a model contains the seeds of its own
destruction.</p>
<p>I have tried to build such models myself, and I have read about many
attempts by others to build such models. Some have tried to say that
“imperfections” like costs of information and trading costs justify the
assumption that monetary policy can be active. But they have never
succeeded in building a sensible model in which these imperfections are
included as an integral part of the model, and in which there are no
proﬁt opportunities in the light of these imperfections.</p>
<p>My trouble is that I keep thinking about people’s budget
equations.</p>
<p>I think about the fact that outstanding government liabilities must
be ﬁnanced in one form or another. And I think about the fact that what
people plan to save and what they plan to spend must add up to what they
have.</p>
<p>This means that if a helicopter did go around dropping money, there
would normally be no force tending to drive up prices. First, peo- ple
would want to trade most of their money for interest-bearing assets.
(See above for what happens if they can’t do that.) Second, they may</p>
<p>under some conditions feel wealthier. But suppose they do? Suppose
they use part of their perceived wealth to increase consumption. Will
that drive up prices?</p>
<p>I think not. The economy produces both consumption goods and
investment goods. If demand for consumption goods goes up, demand for
investment goods must go down. It’s the budget equation again. People
know how much output the economy has. They know that if they take more
in consumption goods they must take less in investment goods. An
increase in consumption may mean a modest increase in consumption goods
prices and a modest decrease in investment goods prices, as the economy
shifts its output to one from the other. But it won’t mean a general
increase in prices.</p>
<p>The Currency Trap</p>
<p>As a postscript, let me note that even in my world, there’s a problem
that can occur when nominal interest rates get too low. It is similar to
something called the “liquidity trap” in the world of Keynes.</p>
<p>It happens when the natural level of the nominal interest rate is
negative, which usually means that prices are falling at a fairly rapid
pace. So long as there is currency around, though, nominal interest
rates can’t become negative.Who would hold a private or government bond
with a negative interest rate if she could hold currency instead?
There’s no reason why a bond with a zero coupon can’t sell at a premium,
which means a negative interest rate. But currency can’t do anything
similar because it doesn’t have a maturity date.</p>
<p>If the natural level of the nominal interest rate goes negative,
something must give. I’m not sure what it will be. Maybe the value of
real investments will fall and we’ll get lots of unemployment. It’s even
possible that the currency trap played a role in making the Depression
worse than it would otherwise have been.</p>
