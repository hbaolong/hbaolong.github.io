<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>Rational Economic</p>
<p>Behavior and the</p>
<p>Balance of Payments</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>his chapter will attempt to explore the implications, for the the-
ory of international trade and the balance of payments, of as- suming
that individuals behave rationally in the light of all the information
available to them.Theories that do not assume that individ- uals behave
rationally are not very satisfactory, because they usually im- ply that
anyone who knows the theory can make money by exploiting the
irrationalities of the other individuals. In the process, the person who
knows the theory will educate the others, they will stop behaving
irrationally (or will become so poor that they stop having an impact on
the economy), and the theory will no longer hold.</p>
<p>Rational behavior implies, among other things, that all unemploy-
ment is voluntary (or frictional). There is always a wage level at
which</p>
<p>I am grateful to Stanley Black and Merton Miller for helpful comments
on earlier versions of this chapter.</p>
<p>rational employers would be willing to hire; if individuals choose
not to work at the wage levels implied by the supply of and demand for
their skills, then they may be acting rationally, but they are not
invol- untarily unemployed. On the other hand, if individuals are
unemployed for long periods of time because they think the equilibrium
wage for their skills is higher than it is, then they will be acting
irrationally.</p>
<p>Because I believe that Keynesian unemployment is inconsistent with
rational behavior on the part of employers and employees, the analysis
in this chapter will be in the context of what is sometimes called a
neoclassical model. The labor, goods, and capital markets will all be
assumed to be in continuous ﬂow and stock equilibrium.</p>
<p>Rational behavior also means that expectations are formed in a
sensible manner. For example, the use of“adaptive expectations” is not
generally a good way to revise one’s expectations.1 Rational expecta-
tions means at least that the expectation of an uncertain variable
should always be equal to the expected value of the distribution of
possible values of the variable.2 In a model containing no uncertainty,
rational expectations implies perfect foresight.3</p>
<p>Rational economic behavior is consistent with the existence of ﬁnite
costs of acquiring information, changing jobs, shifting capital from one
use to another, or transporting goods from one location to another. We
are interested simply in a theory that assumes that indi- viduals and
ﬁrms behave rationally in the light of all that they know at a given
point in time, and that they revise their behavior appropriately as they
get new information. Many “disequilibrium” theories justify assuming
that excess demand or excess supply may persist in a mar- ket by calling
on information, adjustment, or transaction costs.They do not generally
include such costs explicitly, however, and the resulting models are
usually not consistent with the assumption that individuals behave
rationally in the light of these costs.4</p>
<p>International General Equilibrium Without Money</p>
<p>Let us consider a group of countries as a single economic system. We
will assume that government ﬁscal and tariff policies are given in each
country. These policies may include domestic taxes and transfers;
taxes</p>
<p>Rational Economic Behavior 45</p>
<p>or subsidies on the ﬂow of goods, services, or factors of production
into or out of a country; and taxes or subsidies on domestic holdings of
foreign assets or foreign holdings of domestic assets. It does not add
much generality to assume that a government may impose quotas on
international ﬂows, or that a government may periodically expropriate
domestic assets held by foreigners.</p>
<p>We will assume initial stocks of capital goods within each country,
and an allocation of ownership of goods and securities among residents
of the different countries such that each individual is happy with the
composition of her wealth portfolio in the light of government ﬁscal and
tariff policies.</p>
<p>Under various sets of assumptions, including a set of assumptions
generally identiﬁed with “perfect competition,” there will be a unique
equilibrium for the international economy at each point in time.5 In the
absence of uncertainty, the dynamic behavior of the system will be
uniquely determined.There will be a unique path of relative prices,
consumption decisions by individuals, and production decisions by ﬁrms
such that every market is continuously cleared and every indi- vidual is
maximizing expected utility. If output for a given pattern of investment
is uncertain, or if the parameters of individuals’ utility func- tions
are uncertain, then the dynamic behavior of the system will be
stochastic, but it will be completely determined by the exogenous ran-
dom variables in the production or utility functions.</p>
<p>This is true even though there are frictions, adjustment costs, and
information costs that individuals and ﬁrms must take into account. It
is true even though some industries may contain a small number of large
ﬁrms, so that prices are determined by a “game” whose outcome is
uncertain. And it is true even if unions have monopoly power that they
use to raise the real wage for their members, even though this means
keeping some of their members unemployed.</p>
<p>The path of the international economy is determined entirely by real
factors. If it is possible to talk about price levels, ﬁxed exchange
rates, or devaluation in a system like this at all, it is clear that
devaluation can have no real effects. At most, it can affect the nominal
price levels in various countries. Since the assumption of rational
economic behav- ior implies the absence of“money illusion,” changes in
nominal price levels in various countries, in a world without money, can
have no real effects.6</p>
<p>Thus neither the “elasticities” approach nor the “absorption”</p>
<p>approach to devaluation makes sense in a model that assumes rational
behavior and does not include money.7 One cannot say that devalua- tion
will have any effect on a country’s exports, imports, or terms of
trade.</p>
<p>The Balance of Trade</p>
<p>We will assume that any country’s securities or capital may be owned
by residents of any other country. Since private securities are just
own- ership claims on capital, there is no meaningful distinction
between foreign ownership of securities and foreign ownership of
capital.</p>
<p>The movement of securities from one country to another is not the
same as the movement of physical capital from one country to another,
although both are sometimes lumped under the term “invest- ment.” Even
if we assume that physical capital cannot be moved between countries,
securities can ﬂow between countries in exchange for goods or other
securities.</p>
<p>If the residents of country A exchange securities for goods produced
in country B, then according to the usual terminology, there has been a
ﬂow of capital into A. The ﬂow of securities from A to B is a ﬂow of
capital from B to A. And it is true whether the securities that ﬂow from
A to B are government securities of A, government securities of B,
ownership claims on capital in A, or ownership claims on capital in
B.8</p>
<p>In this kind of a model, it does not make sense to say that capital
ﬂows from one country to another because of interest rate differentials
or differentials in the expected rates of return on risky securities.9
An owner of physical capital may transfer it from one country to another
because of differences in the real return to capital in the two
countries, and it may take time to eliminate such differences, because
of costs of transporting capital and because changes in production
conditions keep creating such differences anew. But the costs of trading
securities are generally very low, so it is not possible for differences
in the returns to securities that imply an incentive for everyone to
switch from one security to the other to exist. Changes in security
prices and interest rates will eliminate such differences
immediately.10</p>
<p>The residents of a country will choose portfolios of high-risk and
low-risk assets that maximize expected utility. If an individual holds
several different securities that are essentially riskless, then the
after- tax real returns to her on all of them must be the same.
Differences in nominal interest rates between countries can exist only
because of differences between nominal and real rates of return,
differences in tax status, and differences in such other factors as the
likelihood of devaluation or expropriation. None of these factors
creates any incen- tive for ﬂows of securities between countries.</p>
<p>In maximizing expected utility, an individual will generally try to
hold a diversiﬁed portfolio.A resident of country A will want to hold
some of country B’s securities, and a resident of country B will want to
hold some of country A’s securities. So they will swap. But this will
not result in any net ﬂow of securities or capital.The value of the
securities that A gives to B will be equal to the value of the
securities that B gives toA.</p>
<p>A country can have either a positive or a negative balance of trade
indeﬁnitely. If it is a net lender, then it may have a continuous
negative balance of trade representing earnings on its securities. If it
is a net borrower, it may have a continuous positive balance of trade
representing interest, dividends, and other earnings paid to foreign
holders of its securities.The wealthier country will tend to have a
negative balance of trade, and the poorer country will tend to have a
positive balance of trade. If anything, a negative balance of trade
seems more desirable than a positive balance of trade, because it
represents holdings of foreign assets.</p>
<p>In the short run, of course, the balance of trade can shift between
negative and positive periodically because of changes in the ﬂows of
securities. A country that is accumulating foreign securities or capital
may have a positive balance of trade while it exports goods in exchange
for securities. Later its balance of trade may turn negative as its
earn- ings on its foreign holdings come to exceed its rate of
accumulation of securities. Or a country that is a substantial net
lender may decide to accumulate more wealth, and may become a net
exporter if its rate of accumulation exceeds the earnings on its
existing holdings.</p>
<p>In other words, the major factors determining the balance of trade
have little to do with foreign exchange reserves or exchange rates.And
as we shall see, the direction and magnitude of the balance of trade
have little to do with the factors determining the balance of
payments.</p>
<p>General Equilibrium with Money</p>
<p>Let us now assume that each country adopts an arbitrary unit of
account, expresses all prices in terms of that unit of account, and
issues currency expressed in the same unit. Interest and dividend rates
within a country will be expressed in terms of that country’s unit of
account.</p>
<p>Securities that are held in more than one country may trade in each
country’s currency. For example, Japanese securities held by both
Japanese and US residents may have quoted prices in both yen and
dollars.</p>
<p>The exchange rate between two countries will be the rate at which the
currency of one country may be exchanged for the currency of the other
country. Generally there will be a “spread” in the exchange rate, so
that the exchange rate for exchanges in one direction will dif- fer
slightly from the exchange rate for exchanges in the other direc- tion.
Alternatively, there may be a single exchange rate, and a separate
transaction charge may be made.The transaction charge will tend to be
higher in percentage terms for small transactions at the retail level
than for large transactions at the wholesale level.</p>
<p>Each good in each country will now have a nominal price in that
country’s unit of account, as well as a relative price with respect to
each other good. Nominal prices of goods in a country may rise or fall
at varying rates, depending on the strength of inﬂationary or
deﬂationary pressures within that country.11</p>
<p>Each individual will decide how she wants to divide her wealth
between various securities and currencies on the basis of the known or
expected returns on those securities and on the basis of the covariances
between the returns on each pair of securities or currencies. Since each
country will have securities that are almost as safe as currency and
that pay interest at current short-term rates, the short-term nominal
inter- est rate will be an important factor in the demand for money
within a country.</p>
<p>The higher the short-term nominal interest rate, the less money an
individual will want to hold, other things being equal, and the more
effort she will spend economizing on her money balances.When interest
rates are high, she will make frequent exchanges between</p>
<p>money and short-term interest-bearing securities, to minimize her
lost interest.</p>
<p>Similarly, when interest rates are high, ﬁrms may have to spend more
economizing on their money balances. With a banking system like the one
that exists in the United States, most large ﬁrms may receive almost the
equivalent of interest at full short-term rates on their demand
deposits, since the banks reduce the interest rates on their loans to
ﬁrms by an amount equivalent to the interest on deposits. So the effects
of interest rates on the demand for money by ﬁrms may be more modest
than the effect of interest rates on the demand for money by
individuals.</p>
<p>In any case, the cost of economizing on money balances and the
inﬂuence of the nominal short-term interest rate on the demand for money
within a country means that the real aspects of a monetary economy are
not independent of its nominal aspects. To specify the state of an
international monetary economy, one needs to know the nominal short-term
interest rate in each country, and possibly expected future short-term
interest rates as well.</p>
<p>But that’s all. Assuming that all individuals behave rationally in
the light of the information available to them, the supply of real
balances must always equal the demand, either because the government
supplies passively whatever balances the private sector demands, or
because the nominal price level and nominal interest rate adjust so that
the supply of nominal balances ﬁxed by the government is accepted by the
private sector.</p>
<p>The question of how monetary policy affects a national monetary
economy in which everyone acts rationally has not been settled.12 If the
government increases the money stock through a purchase of private
capital, there are a number of changes consistent with a larger nominal
money stock. The price level may increase abruptly, with the nominal
interest rate remaining unchanged, and the rate ofinﬂation returning to
its original level after the jump in the price level. Or the price level
may remain unchanged, and the nominal interest rate and rate of inﬂation
may fall to levels that make the demand for real balances equal to the
new level of real balances. Or there may be any of a number of com-
binations of a jump in the price level, the nominal interest rate, and
the rate of inﬂation that make the demand for money equal to the
supply.</p>
<p>Rational behavior means that the change in the nominal interest rate
will be approximately equal to the change in the rate of inﬂation, since
the change in the real rate due to a change in the cost of economizing
on money balances will normally be small.</p>
<p>If we knew how to describe the dynamic process governing the
evolution of the short-term interest rate, then we would know how to
determine the path of a national or international monetary economy over
time. But we don’t know yet how to describe that process.13</p>
<p>The “monetary approach” to balance of payments theory is rather
primitive in its development.14 Often those who use this approach ignore
the existence of securities, and assume that when the money supply is
increased within a country, the residents of the country can reduce
their balances only by buying domestic or foreign commodi- ties.The
introduction of securities completely changes the predictions of their
theories. Others include securities, but create static models that
cannot be generalized into dynamic models that assume rational economic
behavior.</p>
<p>Floating Exchange Rates</p>
<p>A group of countries may choose to do nothing about their exchange
rates, and the system should operate smoothly. The changes in exchange
rates will be determined primarily by the differences in the rates of
inﬂation in different countries. If national monetary policies inﬂuence
these rates of inﬂation, they will inﬂuence the exchange rates too.</p>
<p>The principal disadvantage of ﬂexible exchange rates is simply that
in order to know the price of a foreign commodity or service, one needs
to know the current exchange rate. There is a cost of keeping buyers and
sellers informed about changes in price due to changes in exchange
rates. The cost does not seem very large, however, since exchange rates
can be published in the daily papers.</p>
<p>The uncertainty in the future exchange rate is sometimes said to be a
disadvantage, but it is hard to create a set of assumptions that make
this true. If a United States manufacturer orders Swiss machinery to be
delivered and paid for in three months for a given number of Swiss</p>
<p>francs, then the future dollar price is uncertain. But the current
dollar price is known. The manufacturer need only convert dollars to
Swiss francs and buy a Swiss commercial bill for the desired amount that
matures in three months. This would seem to provide as much cer- tainty
as anyone might want.</p>
<p>Some theorists claim that ﬂoating exchange rates make domes- tic
ﬁscal policy ineffective.15 But this is usually in the context of a
Keynesian model that assumes that there is unemployment due to irra-
tional behavior on the part of employers and employees.</p>
<p>Fixed Exchange Rates Through Taxation</p>
<p>Any country can try to force its exchange rate with another country
to follow a certain path. It can choose any path, but a common choice is
to keep the exchange rate constant except for periodic devaluation or
revaluation. It is also common to try to keep the exchange rate within a
certain band around the chosen path, rather than try to keep it exactly
on the path.</p>
<p>One way that a country can try to control its exchange rate is
through its tax and related ﬁscal policies. It can make changes in the
taxes on imports or exports, on export industries or import competing
industries, or even on purely domestic industries. These changes will in
general affect all of the variables of the international economy: the
composition of imports and exports, the balance of trade, and the pat-
tern of domestic and foreign investment.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are assuming that the only tool used to inﬂu- ence
exchange rates is tax policy. Thus the balance of payments will be
identically zero. In this world, tax policy will have no affect on the
balance of payments, because currency exchange is handled entirely by
the private sector.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a country imposes a 10 percent import tax and a
10 percent export subsidy on all goods and services. It is likely that
the value of its currency will fall, perhaps by approximately 10 per-
cent.The balance of trade may change, but the direction of the change is
not clear.Any change in the trade balance must be offset by an equal
change in the balance of capital ﬂows.</p>
<p>The big disadvantage of this method of ﬁxing exchange rates, of
course, is the fact that it introduces distortions into the pattern of
world trade and investment that will normally reduce the potential
welfare of the world’s population.16 In particular cases, these
distortions may off- set existing distortions, and increase potential
world welfare. Normally, however, they will make things worse.
Eventually, when the distortions become severe enough, the country may
eliminate many of them all at once and thus cause a sudden devaluation
or upward revaluation.</p>
<p>The cost of the distortions introduced by using taxes to control
exchange rates is not borne only by the country that imposes the taxes.
If other countries do not retaliate, then a country may even increase
its potential welfare at the expense of other countries. Even if they do
retaliate in such a way that everyone bears part of the cost, the cost
is shared. As we shall see, the cost of controlling exchange rates
through intervention is borne entirely by the country that intervenes.
Thus the use of taxes may be more acceptable politically. In addition,
selective taxes will be favored by the industries that will beneﬁt at
the expense of individual consumers or competing foreign industries.</p>
<p>Fixed Exchange Rates Through Intervention</p>
<p>The other major way of controlling exchange rates is by interven- ing
directly in the currency exchange market. The government of a country
can offer to exchange the two currencies at a ﬁxed rate. The exchange
rate at which it will buy its own currency will generally differ from
the exchange rate at which it will sell its own currency, however. A
government would even be able to ﬁx the exchange rate between two
foreign currencies if it wished.</p>
<p>Normally, the pressure to exchange currencies will be in only one
direction at a given point in time. If inﬂationary pressures are higher
in the United States than in Britain, the British government will be
asked to give pounds for dollars. It can print the pounds it needs, or
it can issue government debt to get the pounds it needs, or it can get
the pounds through taxation. It will accumulate dollars, which it will
normally use to buy dollar-denominated US securities. Its holdings of US
securities will increase.</p>
<p>If the inﬂationary pressure is in Britain, then the process is
reversed. The government will sell its US securities for dollars, and
will issue the dollars in exchange for pounds. If it runs out of US
securities, it may be able to borrow from the US government or in the
private capital markets. Since it can pledge its own securities with
large coverage as collateral for such loans, it should not have any
trou- ble borrowing dollars. For example, it might pledge 00 million in
British government securities as collateral for a 00 million US loan.
Then even a substantial devaluation of the pound would leave the US with
adequate collateral.</p>
<p>This process should be quite effective in ﬁxing exchange rates. It
should force the actual rates of inﬂation to be comparable in the two
countries. The cost of the operation would be related to the volume of
intervention necessary. The government would lose the transaction costs
on all of the exchanges it participates in.</p>
<p>The fact that the government may be forced to hold US securities is
not an additional cost, unless the interest rates on the two countries’
securities are distorted by differential tax rates. If both US and
British securities are held in substantial quantities in Britain, then
rational investors will arbitrage the rates until they are equivalent.
(The nominal rates may differ in equilibrium, because the likelihood of
devaluation is greater for one country than for the other.This
difference in rates will be just sufﬁcient to compensate the holders for
the differential chance of devaluation.)</p>
<p>Is there any gain from using ﬁxed exchange rates, other than avoid-
ing the cost of ﬂexible exchange rates? It seems unlikely. The only real
effect that exchange rate policy can have in a world of rational
economic behavior is on the cost of economizing on money balances. If
exchange rate policy can be used to make a country’s average rate of
inﬂation or the world’s average rate of inﬂation lower than it would
otherwise be, then there will be a small real gain. It does not seem
likely that this gain will be large enough to offset the cost of
maintaining ﬁxed exchange rates.</p>
<p>Is there any gain from devaluation under a ﬁxed exchange rate system?
One effect of devaluation is that the price level in the devalu- ing
country may change relative to that in other countries. During and after
this change, the rate ofinﬂation and the nominal interest rate may be
higher than they would otherwise have been. This means that the</p>
<p>“tax” on money balances will be higher than it would otherwise have
been, and more real resources will be used up economizing on money
balances.This effect is likely to be rather small.</p>
<p>The other effect of devaluation is that it takes the pressure off of
the exchange rate, and thus reduces the cost of intervention. It may
reverse the direction of intervention, if it is large enough. If Britain
was buying pounds with dollars and then devalues, it may ﬁnd itself
buying dollars with pounds, and thus reversing the direction of the
change in its stock of reserves.</p>
<p>In a general equilibrium model, however, the principal effect of
devaluation should be a fairly rapid adjustment of the relative price
levels in various countries.The exact size of the change will depend on
real factors and possibly on the countries’ national monetary policies.
Devaluation should have no appreciable impact on the balance of trade in
the devaluing country. It should neither increase exports nor reduce
imports signiﬁcantly.17</p>
<p>Note also that devaluation does not normally hurt a country hold- ing
the devaluing country’s bonds. There may be a loss on the date of the
devaluation, but this will be offset by the fact that when devaluation
is possible or likely, the bonds will tend to have higher interest rates
than they would otherwise have. If individuals behave rationally, and
choose to hold the bonds of two different countries in their portfolios,
the interest rates must differ by an amount related to the difference in
the probability rates of devaluation of the two currencies, other things
being equal.Thus the premium interest rate received on the bonds of a
country with a weak currency will tend to compensate the holder for the
possible devaluation of that currency.</p>
<p>Taxation and Intervention Combined</p>
<p>Suppose that intervention is the basic policy being used to con- trol
exchange rates. Then it is possible that tax and other government
policies will be used to take the pressure off of the exchange rate and
reduce the amount of intervention required. The government may use
tariffs, quotas, taxes on foreign investment, exchange controls, and
other measures that we are describing broadly as “taxation.”</p>
<p>While it is clear that taxation can be used to take the pressure off
of the exchange rate, and thus to reduce or reverse the ﬂow of foreign
exchange reserves, it is not clear what kind of taxation should be used
to reduce pressure in a particular direction. A country experiencing
strong inﬂationary pressure may impose import taxes, export subsidies or
both. These moves are likely to ease the pressure on the exchange rate,
without reducing inﬂationary pressures within the country. Suppose, for
example, that the “average price of goods” in the US is 10 dollars but
is about to move up to 12 dollars. Suppose that the average price of the
same goods in the UK is 4 pounds and is steady. Suppose that trade is
balanced between the US and the UK, and that the equilibrium exchange
rate in the absence of intervention is .50 to 1 pound.</p>
<p>When the US price level goes up, if nothing is done, the equilib-
rium exchange rate will go to .00 to 1 pound. But if a 20 percent tax is
imposed on all imports, and a 20 percent export subsidy on all exports,
the US price level can go up and the equilibrium exchange rate will
still be .50 to 1 pound.</p>
<p>In other words, when a country increases its import taxes and its
export subsidies, it will tend to cause its currency to depreciate at a
rate less than its rate of inﬂation relative to other countries. This
happens even though, under conditions of full employment, an import tax
will not normally reduce imports substantially, and an export subsidy
will not normally increase exports substantially.</p>
<p>Import taxes and export subsidies will change the pattern of con-
sumption in two countries, especially when trade is not balanced and net
foreign holdings of capital are not zero. But it is not clear whether
the new pattern will result in an increase or a decrease in the
country’s trade balance.That will depend on the particulars ofthe
situation.</p>
<p>Because of the way a country’s balance of payments is usually
described, it seems that the ﬂow of foreign exchange reserves is a
resid- ual, and that the way to inﬂuence the residual is to inﬂuence the
terms that are added and subtracted in calculating the residual. This is
sim- ply not correct. The government is not a principal in most current
or capital account transactions, but it is a principal in foreign
exchange transactions. Import taxes may have no effect on imports in a
general equilibrium model; they may simply allow prices to rise while
the equilibrium exchange rate stays relatively ﬁxed.</p>
<p>The effects of taxes and subsidies on foreign holdings of domestic
assets and on domestic holdings of foreign assets are more difﬁcult to
estimate. It seems, however, that a tax on domestic holdings of foreign
assets will have the same effect as a tax on imports: it will take
pressure off of the exchange rate in a country experiencing strong
inﬂationary pressures relative to other countries. A subsidy on foreign
holdings of domestic assets, or a combination of the tax and the
subsidy, will work in the same direction.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that a country facing a 20 percent increase in
its price level institutes a 20 percent tax on imports, a 20 percent
subsidy on exports, a 20 percent tax on purchases of foreign securities
or capital, and a 20 percent subsidy on sales of securities or capital
to foreigners. If collected, these taxes and subsidies will balance out,
to result in no net taxation. But they will just offset the 20 percent
price rise, even in a country with a net ﬂow or stock of foreign
investment, so that the price rise can take place without a change in
the equilibrium exchange rate.18</p>
<p>This combination of an increase in the price level and the
institution of taxes and subsidies will have no real effects other than
on the equilibrium exchange rate, so it is clear that just as tariffs
should not be expected to affect imports, taxes on foreign investment
should not be expected to affect capital ﬂows. They will, however, serve
to relieve pressure on the exchange rate, and thus to reduce the volume
of intervention required to maintain a ﬁxed exchange rate.</p>
<p>Intervention with Zero Reserves</p>
<p>It is often claimed that when inﬂationary pressures continue to be
stronger in one country than in another, the government controlling the
exchange rate cannot continue its intervention indeﬁnitely, because its
supply of reserves of foreign exchange would get too large, or because
other countries’ holdings of its liabilities would get too large. Even
at the simplest level, this argument makes little sense in a world of
general equilibrium and rational behavior.</p>
<p>If the government is holding larger and larger amounts of foreign
exchange, then it will presumably be holding it in interest-bearing
form. Assuming that interest is paid at a competitive rate, it will
be</p>
<p>compensated for holding the foreign exchange. If the government
thinks that short-term bonds have low interest rates because they serve
as a substitute for money, it can hold long-term bonds, or even
equities.</p>
<p>The government can avoid increasing its money supply through its
foreign exchange dealings by selling enough domestic bonds to offset its
acquisition of foreign bonds.There will be no important limit to the
amount of such domestic bonds it can sell, if it uses the foreign bonds
as collateral in a way that guarantees the buyer of its domestic bonds
that it cannot default on payment of principal or interest. Or it can
run a budget surplus and raise the money it needs to buy the foreign
bonds through taxation.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the government is having to borrow more and more
foreign exchange to continue its intervention, it can do so in a way
that minimizes the risk to the lenders. It can buy domestic bonds with
the currency it receives (thus keeping the domestic money supply con-
stant) and can use these bonds as collateral for its foreign exchange
loans. With the collateral in the hands of the lenders, there should be
no important limit to the amount of foreign exchange it can borrow.</p>
<p>In either case, the government will build up matching assets and lia-
bilities denominated in the two different currencies. So it seems
natural to ask whether the government can’t simply give up its assets in
pay- ment ofits liabilities, and thus keep its reserves near zero all
the time.</p>
<p>In other words, the UK might do the following. It buys dollars with
pounds in the ratio it is trying to maintain. It uses the dollars to buy
long-term US government bonds. Then it sells the US government bonds for
pounds to the highest bidder. In the process, it loses on trans- action
costs, and ends up with slightly fewer pounds than it started with.</p>
<p>Thus the UK could ﬁx the exchange rate between pounds and dollars
without running its foreign exchange balances up or down, and without
changing its money supply. It could, in effect, ﬁx exchange rates
through intervention with zero reserves.</p>
<p>The result of using this method would be that the ratio of the price
of US government bonds in dollars to the price in pounds would be
slightly greater than the exchange rate being maintained. Any seller of
bonds who wants pounds will sell for dollars and then convert them to
pounds through the government, while any buyer of bonds with pounds will
buy direct from the government. The gains to buyers and</p>
<p>sellers of bonds for pounds will be losses to the government. Since
the gains will be less than transaction costs in bonds, there will be no
opportunity for continuous arbitrage against the government.The buy- ers
and sellers will simply reduce their effective transaction costs.</p>
<p>It is clear that a government could adopt this policy; but it is not
so clear that this policy would be effective in controlling exchange
rates. It has been claimed that a country that dumps its foreign
government bonds on the market in exchange for its own currency will be
revers- ing its original support of the foreign currency.</p>
<p>It seems to me, however, that there are enough variables in the
system for the policy to be effective. We have the foreign exchange
rate, the price of US government bonds in dollars, and the price of US
government bonds in pounds. By offering to buy unlimited quantities of
dollars at the ﬁxed rate, the UK ensures that the exchange rate (in
pounds per dollar) cannot fall below that point. In buying US bonds for
dollars and selling for pounds, it may drive the dollar price up
slightly and the pound price down slightly, but it can’t reduce the cur-
rency exchange rate.</p>
<p>Thus it seems that at country can ﬁx its exchange rate with another
country without allowing its support operations to affect either its
money supply or its foreign exchange holdings. Since a ﬁxed exchange
rate, in the absence of changes in taxation, implies that the price
level ratio changes only slowly through time, this means that a country
should be able to control its price level and its money stock
independently, even in the long run. That doesn’t make sense, in a world
of rational behavior, where the demand for money must always equal the
supply. So something has to be wrong with the argument. I think that
what is wrong is the assumption that a country can control its money
supply in the ﬁrst place. The contradiction derived above is yet another
reason why it doesn’t make sense to say that a government has any
independent inﬂuence on a country’s money supply.19</p>
<p>If we assume that each country’s monetary policy is passive, so that
it makes no attempt to control the money supply or interest rates, and
that monetary factors do not enter into the determination of the price
level, then the above conclusion can be made intelligible. It says
simply that a country can control its exchange rate indeﬁnitely without
inter- fering with the natural growth or contraction of its money stock
or of</p>
<p>any other country’s money stock. Demand factors and the factors that
determine the price level (including exchange rate policy) will deter-
mine the money stock in each country.</p>
<p>Summary and Conclusions</p>
<p>Our assumption that individuals and ﬁrms behave rationally in the
light of available information has led to the following conclusions:</p>
<p>• Relative prices and quantities of all goods and services in an
inter- national monetary economy depend primarily on non-monetary
factors.The only monetary effects arise from the inﬂuence of rates of
inﬂation on the cost of economizing on money balances.</p>
<p>• The factors that determine a country’s trade balance and capital
ﬂows are entirely different from the factors that determine its bal-
ance of payments or volume of intervention. The country’s trade balance
and investment ﬂows are determined primarily by the rate at which its
residents want to spend or save out of their income and wealth. Its
balance of payments or the volume of intervention needed to support the
exchange rate is determined primarily by the strength of inﬂationary
pressures in different countries.</p>
<p>• The exchange rate between two countries can be allowed to ﬂoat, or
can be controlled through a combination of intervention and changes in
tax policy. Floating exchange rates increase the cost of determining the
prices of foreign goods, but this cost is likely to be minimal.
Intervention can be very costly when differences in inﬂationary
pressures are high. Changes in tax policy can worsen the distortions in
international trade, and can thus reduce potential world welfare
substantially.Thus ﬂoating exchange rates will almost always be
best.</p>
<p>• Devaluation or changes in taxes on trade and foreign investment can
reduce the pressure on a ﬁxed exchange rate, but will not have any
obvious impact on the aggregate volume of imports, exports, or net
foreign investment. The natural measure of a country’s bal- ance of
payments is the direction and magnitude of intervention involving its
currency.</p>
<p>• Control of exchange rates through intervention does not require
changes in a country’s money supply or in its stock of foreign exchange.
It can be handled by acquiring bonds for one currency and disposing of
the same bonds for the other currency. The losses in this operation can
be made up by taxation.</p>
<p>• Control of the exchange rate between two countries means control of
the ratio of their price levels. If a closed economy could control its
money stock then an open economy could, too. But independ- ent control
of two money stocks is inconsistent with control of the ratio of two
price levels. Thus we have another piece of evidence that a government
cannot control its country’s money stock, but must adopt a passive
monetary policy.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Cagan (1956) was one of the ﬁrst writers to use adaptive
expectations in an economic model. To use adaptive expectations on a
time series, you form an expectation of the next observation in the
series, and then revise the expecta- tion by taking a weighted average
of the expectation and the next observa- tion, when the observation is
available.</p></li>
<li><p>Muth (1961) has one of the early discussions of the implications
of rational expectations. Gordon and Hynes (1970) show that Muth’s
analysis implies that adaptive expectations are generally not rational.
Sargent (1971) has an analysis of the implications of rational
expectations for the asserted trade-off between inﬂation and
unemployment. Brock (1971) has looked at the impli- cations of rational
expectations for models of the behavior of ﬁrms in an industry.</p></li>
<li><p>Brock (1972) has explored the implications of rational
expectations in a neoclas- sical monetary model. Chapter 2 of this book
contains an analysis of the implica- tions of rational economic behavior
for monetary theory and monetary policy.</p></li>
<li><p>For an example of a “disequilibrium” theory that is not
consistent with rational behavior, see Grossman (1971).</p></li>
<li><p>The precise conditions necessary for the existence of a unique
competitive equilibrium are given, for example, by Quirk and Saposnik
(1968).</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that it does not make sense to talk about devaluation in
a “barter economy” has been pointed out by Dornbusch (1971). The present
model is not really a model of a barter economy in the usual sense,
since we assume the existence of securities, which can be used to some
degree in making</p></li>
</ol>
<p>trades. In a more general context,J. Black (1959) notes that with
full employ- ment, devaluation is not likely to have any real
effects.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>For discussion of these two approaches to devaluation, see
Alexander (1952, 1959) and Machlup (1955). Their presentations do not
assume full employ- ment or the absence of money.</p></li>
<li><p>The distinction between ﬂows of securities and ﬂows of physical
capital is often neglected, but has been made by others. For example,
see Holmes (1972).</p></li>
<li><p>For an example of the many analyses that assume that capital ﬂows
are a response to interest rate differentials, see Sohmen
(1967).</p></li>
<li><p>This point has been made, for example, by Borcich
(1972).</p></li>
<li><p>There is no single obvious way to deﬁne the price level or rate
of inﬂation in a country where a variety of goods and services are
produced and consumed. We will assume that each country deﬁnes an
arbitrary system for weight- ing the prices of various goods to
determine a price level. The choice of a system for computing the price
index will also determine the rate of inﬂa- tion. If we deﬁne the real
return on a security as the nominal return minus the rate of inﬂation,
then real returns will also be arbitrary, in the sense that the real
return that we calculate for any security will depend on the weight- ing
used to determine the price level. Only in a one-commodity world is the
real return on a security a more meaningful number than the nominal
return.</p></li>
<li><p>For a discussion of some of the issues involved, see Chapter
2.</p></li>
<li><p>Various monetary economists have presented models of the process,
but the existing models are almost all inconsistent with rational
behavior. For exam- ple, Friedman (1970) gives a model using adaptive
expectations. And other economists give models in which the expected
rate of inﬂation is taken to be equal to the rate of growth of the money
supply, even during periods when the actual rate of inﬂation has
differed from the rate of growth of the money supply.</p></li>

theory, see Johnson (1972).</p></li>

<li><p>The world’s “potential welfare” is reduced if there is no set of
transfers between individuals that would leave everyone at least as well
off as before.</p></li>
<li><p>Laffer (1972) presents evidence that devaluation has in fact had
little or no impact on the balance of trade of the devaluing
country.</p></li>
<li><p>Others have noted that a uniform tax on imports and subsidy on
exports which are also applied to capital transactions will have the
same effect as a devaluation. For example, see the discussion between
Aliber (1969) and Haberler (1969).</p></li>
