<h1 id="the-little-prince">The Little Prince</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for
dedicating it to a grown-up.</p></li>
<li><p>All grown-ups were once children– although few of them remember
it.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-i">Chapter I</h4>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>They always need to have things explained.</p></li>
<li><p>Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is
tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to
them.</p></li>
<li><p>I would bring myself down to his level.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-ii">Chapter II</h4>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter’s career when I was
six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from
the outside and boas from the inside.</p></li>
<li><p>my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the
sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or
fear.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the
middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human
habitation.</p></li>
<li><p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not
disobey.</p></li>
<li><p>That doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep…</p></li>
<li><p>this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-iii">Chapter III</h4>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed
to hear the ones I asked him.</p></li>
<li><p>I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.</p></li>
<li><p>He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my
plane</p></li>
<li><p>What a queer idea!</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-iv">Chapter IV</h4>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what
he said.</p></li>
<li><p>Grown-ups are like that…</p></li>
<li><p>So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again,
dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody
accepted his report.</p></li>
<li><p>If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a
note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their
ways.</p></li>
<li><p>If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he
exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up
people.</p></li>
<li><p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much
greater air of truth to my story.</p></li>
<li><p>For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly.</p></li>
<li><p>To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if
I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer
interested in anything but figures…</p></li>
<li><p>It is hard to take up drawing again at my age</p></li>
<li><p>I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope
generally fair-to-middling.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow
old.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-v">Chapter V</h4>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li><p>The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to
fall from his thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince
laugh.</p></li>
<li><p>Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being
little.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one
would let it grow wherever it might wish.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very tedious work,“ the little prince added, “but very
easy.“</p></li>
<li><p>“Children,“ I say plainly, “watch out for the baobabs!“</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-vi">Chapter VI</h4>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li><p>You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you
like…</p></li>
<li><p>You know– one loves the sunset, when one is so sad…</p></li>
<li><p>“Were you so sad, then?“ I asked, “on the day of the forty-four
sunsets?“</p></li>
<li><p>the little prince made no reply.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-vii">Chapter VII</h4>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><p>“A sheep,“ I answered, “eats anything it finds in its
reach.“</p></li>
<li><p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure
themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible
weapons…</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing
that came into my head. Don’t you see– I am very busy with matters of
consequence!</p></li>
<li><p>You talk just like the grown-ups!</p></li>
<li><p>You mix everything up together… You confuse everything…</p></li>
<li><p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the
breeze.</p></li>
<li><p>He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He
has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add
up figures.</p></li>
<li><p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not
important?</p></li>
<li><p>And if I know– I, myself– one flower which is unique in the
world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep
can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he
is doing– Oh! You think that is not important!</p></li>
<li><p>The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of
what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death?</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-viii">Chapter VIII</h4>
<ol start="51" type="1">
<li><p>One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they
would have faded peacefully away.</p></li>
<li><p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce
a flower.</p></li>
<li><p>the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her
beauty in the shelter of her green chamber.</p></li>
<li><p>It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to
appear.</p></li>
<li><p>She was a coquettish creature!</p></li>
<li><p>her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.</p></li>
<li><p>I am scarcely awake.</p></li>
<li><p>So, he tended the flower.</p></li>
<li><p>I suppose you wouldn’t have a screen for me?</p></li>
<li><p>Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of
such a naïve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put
the little prince in the wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer
from remorse just the same.</p></li>
<li><p>So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was
inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken
seriously words, which were without importance, and it made him very
unhappy.</p></li>
<li><p>One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look
at them and breathe their fragrance.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace</p></li>
<li><p>This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have
filled my heart with tenderness and pity.</p></li>
<li><p>I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words.</p></li>
<li><p>She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me.</p></li>
<li><p>Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to
love her…</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-ix">Chapter IX</h4>
<ol start="69" type="1">
<li><p>Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.</p></li>
<li><p>On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our
volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.</p></li>
<li><p>The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of
dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs.</p></li>
<li><p>when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to
place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he was
very close to tears.</p></li>
<li><p>The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a
cold.</p></li>
<li><p>He was surprised by this absence of reproaches.</p></li>
<li><p>He did not understand this quiet sweetness.</p></li>
<li><p>“Of course I love you,“ the flower said to him. “It is my fault
that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But
you– you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy… let the glass
globe be. I don’t want it any more.“</p></li>
<li><p>My cold is not so bad as all that… the cool night air will do me
good. I am a flower.</p></li>
<li><p>Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if
I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.</p></li>
<li><p>for the large animals– I am not at all afraid of any of them. I
have my claws.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now
go!</p></li>
<li><p>For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud
flower…</p></li>

all.</p></li>
<li><p>The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes
their life very difficult.</p></li>
