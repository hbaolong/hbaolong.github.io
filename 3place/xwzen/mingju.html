<h1 id="the-little-prince">The Little Prince</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for
dedicating it to a grown-up.</p></li>
<li><p>All grown-ups were once children– although few of them remember
it.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-i">Chapter I</h4>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>They always need to have things explained.</p></li>
<li><p>Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is
tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to
them.</p></li>
<li><p>I would bring myself down to his level.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-ii">Chapter II</h4>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter’s career when I was
six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from
the outside and boas from the inside.</p></li>
<li><p>my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the
sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or
fear.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the
middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human
habitation.</p></li>
<li><p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not
disobey.</p></li>
<li><p>That doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep…</p></li>
<li><p>this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-iii">Chapter III</h4>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed
to hear the ones I asked him.</p></li>
<li><p>I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.</p></li>
<li><p>He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my
plane</p></li>
<li><p>What a queer idea!</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-iv">Chapter IV</h4>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what
he said.</p></li>
<li><p>Grown-ups are like that…</p></li>
<li><p>So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again,
dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody
accepted his report.</p></li>
<li><p>If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a
note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their
ways.</p></li>
<li><p>If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he
exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up
people.</p></li>
<li><p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much
greater air of truth to my story.</p></li>
<li><p>For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly.</p></li>
<li><p>To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if
I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer
interested in anything but figures…</p></li>
<li><p>It is hard to take up drawing again at my age</p></li>
<li><p>I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope
generally fair-to-middling.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow
old.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-v">Chapter V</h4>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li><p>The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to
fall from his thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince
laugh.</p></li>
<li><p>Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being
little.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one
would let it grow wherever it might wish.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very tedious work,“ the little prince added, “but very
easy.“</p></li>
<li><p>“Children,“ I say plainly, “watch out for the baobabs!“</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-vi">Chapter VI</h4>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li><p>You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you
like…</p></li>
<li><p>You know– one loves the sunset, when one is so sad…</p></li>
<li><p>“Were you so sad, then?“ I asked, “on the day of the forty-four
sunsets?“</p></li>
<li><p>the little prince made no reply.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-vii">Chapter VII</h4>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><p>“A sheep,“ I answered, “eats anything it finds in its
reach.“</p></li>
<li><p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure
themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible
weapons…</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing
that came into my head. Don’t you see– I am very busy with matters of
consequence!</p></li>
<li><p>You talk just like the grown-ups!</p></li>
<li><p>You mix everything up together… You confuse everything…</p></li>
<li><p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the
breeze.</p></li>
<li><p>He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He
has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add
up figures.</p></li>
<li><p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not
important?</p></li>
<li><p>And if I know– I, myself– one flower which is unique in the
world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep
can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he
is doing– Oh! You think that is not important!</p></li>
<li><p>The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of
what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death?</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-viii">Chapter VIII</h4>
<ol start="51" type="1">
<li><p>One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they
would have faded peacefully away.</p></li>
<li><p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce
a flower.</p></li>
<li><p>the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her
beauty in the shelter of her green chamber.</p></li>
<li><p>It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to
appear.</p></li>
<li><p>She was a coquettish creature!</p></li>
<li><p>her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.</p></li>
<li><p>I am scarcely awake.</p></li>
<li><p>So, he tended the flower.</p></li>
<li><p>I suppose you wouldn’t have a screen for me?</p></li>
<li><p>Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of
such a naïve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put
the little prince in the wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer
from remorse just the same.</p></li>
<li><p>So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was
inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken
seriously words, which were without importance, and it made him very
unhappy.</p></li>
<li><p>One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look
at them and breathe their fragrance.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace</p></li>
<li><p>This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have
filled my heart with tenderness and pity.</p></li>
<li><p>I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words.</p></li>
<li><p>She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me.</p></li>
<li><p>Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to
love her…</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-ix">Chapter IX</h4>
<ol start="69" type="1">
<li><p>Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.</p></li>
<li><p>On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our
volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.</p></li>
<li><p>The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of
dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs.</p></li>
<li><p>when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to
place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he was
very close to tears.</p></li>
<li><p>The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a
cold.</p></li>
<li><p>He was surprised by this absence of reproaches.</p></li>
<li><p>He did not understand this quiet sweetness.</p></li>
<li><p>“Of course I love you,“ the flower said to him. “It is my fault
that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But
you– you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy… let the glass
globe be. I don’t want it any more.“</p></li>
<li><p>My cold is not so bad as all that… the cool night air will do me
good. I am a flower.</p></li>
<li><p>Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if
I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.</p></li>
<li><p>for the large animals– I am not at all afraid of any of them. I
have my claws.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now
go!</p></li>
<li><p>For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud
flower…</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-x">Chapter X</h4>
<ol start="82" type="1">
<li><p>It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a
king</p></li>
<li><p>He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man,
he made his orders reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>“If I ordered a general,“ he would say, by way of example, “if I
ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general
did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be
my fault.“</p></li>
<li><p>For his rule was not only absolute: it was also
universal.</p></li>
<li><p>I have the right to require obedience because my orders are
reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question
once he had asked it.</p></li>
<li><p>“I have nothing more to do here,“ he said to the king. “So I
shall set out on my way again.“</p></li>
<li><p>“Then you shall judge yourself,“ the king answered. “that is the
most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself
than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then
you are indeed a man of true wisdom.“</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xi">Chapter XI</h4>
<ol start="90" type="1">
<li><p>to conceited men, all other men are admirers.</p></li>
<li><p>It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me.</p></li>
<li><p>After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired
of the game’s monotony.</p></li>
<li><p>Conceited people never hear anything but praise.</p></li>
<li><p>To admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest, the
best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this
planet.</p></li>
<li><p>The grown-ups are certainly very odd</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xii">Chapter XII</h4>
<h4 id="chapter-xiii">Chapter XIII</h4>
<ol start="96" type="1">
<li><p>I haven’t time to light it again.</p></li>
<li><p>I am concerned with matters of consequence.</p></li>
<li><p>repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a
question once he had asked it.</p></li>
<li><p>The businessman raised his head.</p></li>
<li><p>He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the
place, and I made four mistakes in my addition.</p></li>
<li><p>When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is
yours.</p></li>
<li><p>It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence.</p></li>
<li><p>On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were
very different from those of the grown-ups.</p></li>
<li><p>The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in
answer. And the little prince went away.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xiv">Chapter XIV</h4>
<ol start="105" type="1">
<li><p>“There is nothing to understand,“ said the lamplighter. “Orders
are orders. Good morning.“</p></li>
<li><p>That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more
rapidly and the orders have not been changed!</p></li>
<li><p>He remembered the sunsets, which he himself had gone to seek, in
other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his
friend.</p></li>
<li><p>it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same
time.</p></li>
<li><p>The one thing I love in life is to sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the
conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is
the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps
that is because he is thinking of something else besides
himself.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xv">Chapter XV</h4>
<ol start="111" type="1">
<li><p>The geographer is much too important to go loafing
about.</p></li>
<li><p>if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to
him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer’s moral
character.</p></li>
<li><p>I have also a flower.</p></li>
<li><p>“We do not record them,“ said the geographer, “because they are
ephemeral.“</p></li>
<li><p>“But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,“ the little prince
interrupted. “What does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?“</p></li>
<li><p>repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a
question, once he had asked it.</p></li>
<li><p>which is in danger of speedy disappearance.</p></li>
<li><p>Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?</p></li>
<li><p>“My flower is ephemeral,“ the little prince said to himself, “and
she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have
left her on my planet, all alone!“</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xvi">Chapter XVI</h4>
<h4 id="chapter-xvii">Chapter XVII</h4>
<ol start="120" type="1">
<li><p>When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little
from the truth.</p></li>
<li><p>They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs.</p></li>
<li><p>They adore figures, and that will please them.</p></li>
<li><p>e was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet,
when a coil of gold, the colour of the moonlight, flashed across the
sand.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been having some trouble with a flower</p></li>
<li><p>“It is also lonely among men,“ the snake said.</p></li>
<li><p>He twined himself around the little prince’s ankle, like a golden
bracelet.</p></li>
<li><p>Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he
came</p></li>
<li><p>You move me to pity</p></li>
<li><p>I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own
planet.</p></li>
<li><p>why do you always speak in riddles?</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xviii">Chapter XVIII</h4>
<ol start="131" type="1">
<li><p>It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at
all.</p></li>
<li><p>The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes
their life very difficult.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xix">Chapter XIX</h4>
<ol start="133" type="1">
<li><p>Be my friends. I am all alone</p></li>
<li><p>On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to
speak…</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xx">Chapter XX</h4>
<ol start="135" type="1">
<li><p>They all looked like his flower.</p></li>
<li><p>And he was overcome with sadness.</p></li>
<li><p>His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in
all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one
single garden!</p></li>
<li><p>I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all
the world; and all I had was a common rose.</p></li>
<li><p>that doesn’t make me a very great prince</p></li>
<li><p>he lay down in the grass and cried.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-xxi">Chapter XXI</h4>
<ol start="141" type="1">
<li><p>I am looking for friends.</p></li>
<li><p>“It is an act too often neglected,“ said the fox. It means to
establish ties.“</p></li>
<li><p>if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be
unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the
world…</p></li>
<li><p>There is a flower… I think that she has tamed me…</p></li>
<li><p>if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my
life.</p></li>
<li><p>I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields
have nothing to say to me. And that is sad.</p></li>
<li><p>The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought
of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat…</p></li>
<li><p>Please– tame me!</p></li>
<li><p>“One only understands the things that one tames,“ said the fox.
“Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready
made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy
friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend,
tame me…“</p></li>
<li><p>Words are the source of misunderstandings.</p></li>
<li><p>If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then
at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and
happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be
worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am!</p></li>
<li><p>if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my
heart is to be ready to greet you…</p></li>
<li><p>They are what make one day different from other days, one hour
