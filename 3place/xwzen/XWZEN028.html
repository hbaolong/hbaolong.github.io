<h4 id="chapter-xxvii">Chapter XXVII</h4>
<p>And now six years have already gone by…</p>
<p>I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my
return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: “I
am tired.“</p>
<ul>

<p>Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say– not entirely.
But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his
body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body… and <strong>at night I
love to listen to the stars.</strong> It is like five hundred million
little bells…</p>
<p>But there is one extraordinary thing… when I drew the muzzle for the
little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never
have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering:
<strong>what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the
flower…</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>At one time I say to myself: “Surely not! The little prince shuts his
flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep
very carefully…“ Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter
of all the stars.</p>
<p>But at another time I say to myself: “At some moment or other one is
absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the
glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the
night…“ And then the little bells are changed to tears…</p>
<p>Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little
prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if
somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has– yes or
no?– eaten a rose…</p>
<p>Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: <strong>is it yes or no? Has the
sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything
changes…</strong></p>
<p>And <strong>no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of
so much importance!</strong></p>
<p>This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It
is the same as that on the preceding page, but <strong>I have drawn it
again to impress it on your memory.</strong> <strong>It is here that the
little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.</strong></p>

<p>Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case
you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon
this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the
star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and
who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. <strong>If
this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come
back.</strong></p>
<h4 id="saint-exupéry-a-short-biography">Saint-Exupéry: A Short
Biography</h4>
<p>His friends called him Saint-Ex. In reality, he was named Antoine de
Saint-Exupéry. He is one of the greatest French writers. He is also one
of the pioneers of aviation. Here is his story.</p>
<p>Saint-Exupéry was born in Lyon in 1900. At an early age, he dreamt of
adventure. His greatest ambition was to be an officer in the Navy. In
order to become a Naval officer, one had to pass a very difficult exam.
Saint-Exupéry took the exam and failed… there was, fortunately, another
solution– aviation. At this time, aviation was extremely dangerous.
Danger, risk– this is precisely for what Saint-Exupéry wished. During
his military service, he learned to pilot airplanes. Saint-Exupéry had
only one idea in his head: to fly.</p>
<p>After his military service, he presented himself to the director of
an airline company and expressed to him his desire to become a pilot.
The director told him, “Do like everyone else. First, you must become a
mechanic.“</p>
<p>Saint-Exupéry worked to become a mechanic. In 1927, he finally
reached his goal. He was the pilot of a formation. He completed
dangerous missions over the Mediterranean, over the Sahara. He had many
accidents over the middle of the desert. Later, he was named the
director of his own aviation company in South America. There also, he
accomplished many dangerous missions over the Andes.</p>
<p>For Saint-Exupéry, flying wasn’t just piloting an airplane. It was
also meditating, reflecting. During his missions, Saint-Exupéry thought
deeply about solitude, friendship, the meaning of life, the human
condition, and liberty. He published his reflections. His books had
immediate success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the aviation company for which Saint-Exupéry worked
was having serious financial problems. Saint-Exupéry had to quit the
company. He became a journalist. He went to Spain, Russia, and Germany.
He flew when he could.</p>
<p>In 1939, France went to war with Germany. Saint-Exupéry enlisted
immediately in the army. Defeat came soon. France was occupied by
Hitler’s troops.</p>
<p>Saint-Exupéry didn’t accept the defeat. He decided to leave France.
He settled in the United States, where he continued to write. It was in
New York that he published The Little Prince, one of his most celebrated
books.</p>
<p>In 1942, American troops landed in North Africa. Saint-Exupéry
decided to join the American army. At age 42, he volunteered to be a
pilot. He was told that he was too old. He persisted. Finally he
obtained satisfaction. He was given an airplane. He accomplished many
missions over occupied France.</p>
<p>On the 31st of July, 1944, Saint-Exupéry left for his last mission.
His airplane was destroyed by Germans over the Mediterranean. On that
day, Saint-Exupéry didn’t return… in the open sky, he found risk, death,
and glory.</p>
