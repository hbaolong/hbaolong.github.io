<h4 id="chapter-xxi">Chapter XXI</h4>
<p>It was then that the fox appeared.</p>
<p>“Good morning,“ said the fox.</p>
<p>“Good morning,“ the little prince responded politely, although when
he turned around he saw nothing.</p>
<p>“I am right here,“ the voice said, “under the apple tree.“</p>
<p>“Who are you?“ asked the little prince, and added, “You are very
pretty to look at.“</p>
<p>“I am a fox,“ said the fox.</p>
<p>“Come and play with me,“ proposed the little prince. “I am so
unhappy.“</p>
<ul>
<li>propose,英 [prəˈpəʊz] 美 [prəˈpoʊz] v.
提议，建议；提出（理论或解释）；提名，推荐；计划，打算；求婚；（向立法机构或委员会）提交（动议）；提议祝（酒）</li>
</ul>
<p>“I cannot play with you,“ the fox said. “I am not tamed.“</p>
<ul>
<li>tame,英 [teɪm] 美 [teɪm] adj.
驯服的，不怕人的；平淡无奇的，枯燥乏味的；听使唤的，温顺的；<美>
（植物）经栽培的；（土地）经开垦的 v.
驯化，驯服；制服，控制；开垦，开辟；使变得平淡</li>
</ul>
<p>“Ah! Please excuse me,“ said the little prince.</p>
<p>But, after some thought, he added: “What does that mean– ‘tame’?“</p>
<p>“You do not live here,“ said the fox. “What is it that you are
looking for?“</p>
<p>“I am looking for men,“ said the little prince. “What does that mean–
‘tame’?“</p>
<p>“Men,“ said the fox. “They have guns, and they hunt. It is very
disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests.
Are you looking for chickens?“</p>
<p>“No,“ said the little prince. “<strong>I am looking for
friends.</strong> What does that mean– ‘tame’?“</p>
<p><strong>“It is an act too often neglected,“ said the fox. It means to
establish ties.“</strong></p>
<p>“‘To establish ties’?“</p>
<p>“Just that,“ said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a
little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I
have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you,
I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But
<strong>if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will
be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the
world…</strong>“</p>
<p>“I am beginning to understand,“ said the little prince.
“<strong>There is a flower… I think that she has tamed me…</strong>“</p>
<p>“It is possible,“ said the fox. “On the Earth one sees all sorts of
things.“</p>
<p>“Oh, but this is not on the Earth!“ said the little prince.</p>
<p>The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perplex,英 [pəˈpleks] 美 [pərˈpleks] v.
使困惑，使茫然；使复杂化</p></li>
<li><p>curious,英 [ˈkjʊəriəsli] 美 [ˈkjʊriəs] adv. 好奇地</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“On another planet?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Are there hunters on this planet?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Nothing is perfect,“ sighed the fox.</p>
<p>But he came back to his idea.</p>
<p>“My life is very monotonous,“ the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men
hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just
alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But <strong>if you tame
me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life.</strong> I shall
know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others.
Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call
me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the
grain-fields down yonder? <strong>I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use
to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is
sad.</strong> But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how
wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! <strong>The grain, which
is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love
to listen to the wind in the wheat…</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li><p>monotonous,英 [məˈnɒtənəs] 美 [məˈnɑːtənəs] adj.

</ul>
<p>The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.</p>
<p>“<strong>Please– tame me!</strong>“ he said.</p>
<p>“I want to, very much,“ the little prince replied. “But I have not
much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to
understand.“</p>
<p><strong>“One only understands the things that one tames,“ said the
fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all
ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy
friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend,
tame me…“</strong></p>
<h5 id="你可曾tame什么么"><a
href="./hash/0017.html">你，可曾Tame什么么？</a></h5>
<p>“What must I do, to tame you?“ asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“You must be very patient,“ replied the fox. “First you will sit down
at a little distance from me– like that– in the grass. I shall look at
you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. <strong>Words
are the source of misunderstandings.</strong> But you will sit a little
closer to me, every day…“</p>
<p>The next day the little prince came back.</p>
<p>“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,“ said the
fox. “<strong>If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the
afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel
happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall
already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I
am!</strong> But <strong>if you come at just any time, I shall never
know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you…</strong> One
must observe the proper rites…“</p>
<ul>
<li><p>observe,英 [əbˈzɜːv] 美 [əbˈzɜːrv] v.
注意到，观察到；注视，监视；（在科学研究中）观测，发现；说话，评论；遵守（规则、法律等）；庆祝（节日），纪念（某人或事件）；静默，默哀；举行，参加</p></li>
<li><p>proper,英 [ˈprɒpə(r)] 美 [ˈprɑːpər] adj.
真正的，像样的；实际上的，严格意义上的；正确的，合适的；合理的，合乎体统的；非常有礼貌的，循规蹈矩的；<正式>
特有的，专有的；完全的，彻底的；&lt;英，非正式&gt;

adv. &lt;英，非正式&gt; 完全地，彻底地；&lt;英，非正式&gt;
正确地，恰当地</p></li>
<li><p>rite,英 [raɪt] 美 [raɪt] n. （宗教等的）仪式；礼节，惯例</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“What is a rite?“ asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“Those also are actions too often neglected,“ said the fox.
“<strong>They are what make one day different from other days, one hour
from other hours.</strong> There is a rite, for example, among my
hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday
is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards.
But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like
every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.“</p>
<ul>
<li><p>neglect,英 [nɪˈɡlekt] 美 [nɪˈɡlekt] v.
疏于照顾，未予看管；不予重视，忽视；漏做
n. 忽略，忽视，未被重视</p></li>
<li><p>vineyard,英 [ˈvɪnjəd] 美 [ˈvɪnjərd]
n. 葡萄园，葡萄酒厂；藤本植物园</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his
departure drew near–</p>
<ul>
<li><p>departure,英 [dɪˈpɑːtʃə(r)] 美 [dɪˈpɑːrtʃər]
n. 背离；离开，启程</p></li>
<li><p>draw,英 [drɔː] 美 [drɔː],（向特定方向）移动；</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Ah,“ said the fox, “I shall cry.“</p>
<p>“It is your own fault,“ said the little prince. “I never wished you
any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you…“</p>
<p>“Yes, that is so,“ said the fox.</p>
<p>“But now you are going to cry!“ said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is so,“ said the fox.</p>
<p>“Then it has done you no good at all!“</p>
<p><strong>“It has done me good,“ said the fox, “because of the colour
of the wheat fields.“</strong> And then he added:</p>
<p>“<strong>Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that
yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me,
and I will make you a present of a secret.</strong>“</p>
<p>The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p>
<p>“You are not at all like my rose,“ he said. “As yet you are nothing.
No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox
when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other
foxes. But <strong>I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in
all the world.</strong>“</p>
<p>And the roses were very much embarrassed.</p>
<ul>
<li>embarrass,英 [ɪmˈbærəs] 美 [ɪmˈbærəs] v.
（使）尴尬，窘迫；使难堪，使为难；<古>妨碍（人，移动，行动）；<古>使困难重重，使复杂化</li>
</ul>
<p>“You are beautiful, but you are empty,“ he went on. “One could not
die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passer-by would think that my rose
looked just like you– the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone
she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because
it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under
the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the
screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars
(except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because
it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or
even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>caterpillar,英 [ˈkætəpɪlə(r)] 美 [ˈkætərpɪlər]
n. 毛虫,蠋（蝴蝶或蛾的幼虫）；（重型车辆的）履带；履带式车辆</p></li>

抱怨，嘟囔；咕隆，发轰隆声；（内脏）间歇性地闹病
n. 抱怨，牢骚；咕隆声</p></li>
<li><p>boast,英 [bəʊst] 美 [boʊst] v. 有（值得自豪的东西）；吹嘘，夸耀
n. 夸耀，自吹自擂，感到自豪的事</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And he went back to meet the fox.</p>
<p>“Goodbye,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Goodbye,“ said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple
secret: <strong>It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what
is essential is invisible to the eye.</strong>“</p>
<p>“<strong>What is essential is invisible to the eye</strong>,“ the
little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
<p>“<strong>It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your
rose so important.</strong>“</p>
<p>“It is the time I have wasted for my rose–“ said the little prince,
so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
<p>“Men have forgotten this truth,“ said the fox. “But you must not
forget it. <strong>You become responsible, forever, for what you have
tamed.</strong> You are responsible for your rose…“</p>
<p>“I am responsible for my rose,“ the little prince repeated, so that
he would be sure to remember.</p>
