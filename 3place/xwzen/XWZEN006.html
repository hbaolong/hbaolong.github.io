<h4 id="chapter-v">Chapter V</h4>
<p>As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the
little prince’s planet, his departure from it, his journey. The
information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his
thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the
catastrophe of the baobabs.</p>
<p>This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little
prince asked me abruptly– as if seized by a grave doubt– “It is true,
isn’t it, that sheep eat little bushes?“</p>
<p>“Yes, that is true.“</p>
<p>“Ah! I am glad!“</p>
<p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat
little bushes. But the little prince added:</p>
<p>“Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?“</p>
<p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little
bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if
he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat
up one single baobab.</p>
<p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p>
<p>“We would have to put them one on top of the other,“ he said.</p>
<p>But he made a wise comment:</p>
<p>“Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.“</p>
<p>“That is strictly correct,“ I said. “But why do you want the sheep to
eat the little baobabs?“</p>
<p>He answered me at once, “Oh, come, come!“, as if he were speaking of
something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great
mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little
prince lived– as on all planets– good plants and bad plants. In
consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from
bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the
earth’s darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to
awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin– timidly at
first– to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the
sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one
would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant,
one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one
recognizes it.</p>
<p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of
the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of
that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will
never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It
spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its
roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many,
they split it in pieces…</p>
<p>“It is a question of discipline,“ the little prince said to me later
on. “When you’ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is
time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest
care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at
the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes
which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very
tedious work,“ the little prince added, “but very easy.“</p>
<p>And one day he said to me: “You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so
that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That
would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.
Sometimes,“ he added, “there is no harm in putting off a piece of work
until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means
a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He
neglected three little bushes…“</p>
<p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of
that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the
danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable
risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for
once I am breaking through my reserve. “Children,“ I say plainly, “watch
out for the baobabs!“</p>
<p>My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long
time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked
so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is
worth all the trouble it has cost me.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will ask me, “Why are there no other drawing in this book
as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?“</p>
<p>The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not
been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried
beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.</p>
