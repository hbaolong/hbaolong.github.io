<h4 id="chapter-xxiv">Chapter XXIV</h4>
<p>It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert,
and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the
last drop of my water supply.</p>
<p>“Ah,“ I said to the little prince, “these memories of yours are very
charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have
nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk
at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!“</p>
<p>“My friend the fox–“ the little prince said to me.</p>
<p>“My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to
do with the fox!“</p>
<p>“Why not?“</p>
<p>“Because I am about to die of thirst…“</p>
<p>He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:</p>
<p>“It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to
die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend…“</p>
<p>“He has no way of guessing the danger,“ I said to myself. “He has
never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he
needs…“</p>
<p>But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:</p>
<p>“I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well…“</p>
<p>I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at
random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started
walking.</p>
<p>When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness
fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little
feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little
prince’s last words came reeling back into my memory:</p>
<p>“Then you are thirsty, too?“ I demanded.</p>
<p>But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:</p>
<p>“Water may also be good for the heart…“</p>
<p>I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very
well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.</p>
<p>He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little
silence, he spoke again: “The stars are beautiful, because of a flower
that cannot be seen.“</p>
<p>I replied, “Yes, that is so.“ And, without saying anything more, I
looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in
the moonlight.</p>
<p>“The desert is beautiful,“ the little prince added.</p>
<p>And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a
desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence
something throbs, and gleams…</p>
<p>“What makes the desert beautiful,“ said the little prince, “is that
somewhere it hides a well…“</p>
<p>I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious
radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house,
and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one
had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for
it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a
secret in the depths of its heart…</p>
<p>“Yes,“ I said to the little prince. “The house, the stars, the
desert– what gives them their beauty is something that is
invisible!“</p>
<p>“I am glad,“ he said, “that you agree with my fox.“</p>
<p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and
set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed
to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me,
even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight
I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that
trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: “What I see here is nothing
but a shell. What is most important is invisible…“</p>
<p>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I
said to myself, again: “What moves me so deeply, about this little
prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower– the image of a
rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even
when he is asleep…“ And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the
need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be
extinguished by a little puff of wind…</p>
<p>And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.</p>
