<h4 id="ii">II</h4>
<p>Then the spell of my little debauch would end, and I’d feel terribly
nauseated. Repentance would come; I’d drive it away - it was too
nauseating. Little by little, however, I’d get used to that as well. I
could get used to anything - that is, not really get used, but somehow
voluntarily consent to endure it. But I had a way out that reconciled
everything, which was - to escape into “everything beautiful and lofty,“
in dreams, of course. I dreamed terribly, I would dream for three months
at a time, shrinking into my corner, and, believe me, in those moments I
bore no resemblance to that gentleman who, in the panic of his chicken
heart, sat sewing a German beaver to the collar of his overcoat. I’d
suddenly become a hero. And then I wouldn’t even have let the six-foot
lieutenant into the house. I couldn’t even imagine him then. What these
dreams of mine were, and how I could have been satisfied with them - is
difficult to say now, but I was satisfied with them then. However, I’m
somewhat satisfied with them even now. Dreams came to me with a
particular sweetness and intensity after a little debauch, they came
with repentance and tears, with curses and raptures. There were moments
of such positive ecstasy, such happiness,</p>
<p>hat not even the slightest mockery could be felt in me, by God. There
was faith, hope, love. This was the point, that I blindly believed then
that through some miracle, some external circumstance, all this would
suddenly extend, expand; suddenly a horizon of appropriate activity
would present itself, beneficent, beautiful, and, above all, quite
ready-made (precisely what, I never knew, but above all - quite
ready-made), and thus I would suddenly step forth under God’s heaven all
but on a white horse and wreathed in laurels. A secondary role was
incomprehensible to me, and that was precisely why, in reality, I so
calmly filled the last. Either hero or mud, there was no in between. And
that is what ruined me, because in the mud I comforted myself with being
a hero at other times, and the hero covered up the mud: for an ordinary
man, say, it’s shameful to be muddied, but a hero is too lofty to be
completely muddied, consequently one can get muddied. Remarkably, these
influxes of “everything beautiful and lofty“ used also to come to me
during my little debauches; precisely when I was already at the very
bottom, they would come just so, in isolated little flashes, as if
reminding me of themselves, and yet they did not annihilate the little
debauch with their appearance; on the contrary, it was as if they
enlivened it by contrast and came in exactly the proportion required for
a good sauce. The sauce here consisted of contradiction and suffering,
of tormenting inner analysis, and all these torments and tormenticules
lent my little debauch a certain piquancy, even meaning - in short, they
fully fulfilled the function of a good sauce. All this was even not
without some profundity. For how could I consent to a simple, direct,
trite little scrivener’s debauch, and to bearing all this mud on myself!
What was there in it that could seduce me and lure me into the streets
at night? No, sir, I had a noble loophole for everything . . .</p>
<p>But how much love, Lord, how much love I used to experience in those
dreams of mine, in those “escapes into everything beautiful and lofty“:
though it was a fantastical love, though it was never in reality applied
to anything human, there was so much of it, this love, that afterwards,
in reality, I never even</p>
<p>felt any need to apply it; that would have been an unnecessary
luxury. Everything, however, would always end most happily with a lazy
and rapturous transition to art — that is, to beautiful forms of being,
quite ready-made, highly stolen from poets and novelists, and adapted to
every possible service or demand. For example, I triumph over everyone;
everyone, of course, is lying in the dust and is forced to voluntarily
acknowledge all my perfections, and I forgive them all. I fall in love,
being a famous poet and court chamberlain; I receive countless millions
and donate them immediately to mankind, and then and there confess
before all the world my disgraces, which, of course, are not mere
disgraces, but contain an exceeding amount of “the beautiful and lofty,“
of something manfredian.9 Everyone weeps and kisses me (what blockheads
they’d be otherwise), and I go barefoot and hungry to preach new ideas
and crush the retrograde under Austerlitz.10 Then a march is struck up,
an amnesty is granted, the Pope agrees to quit Rome for Brazil; then a
ball is given for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese, now on the
shores of Lake Como, since Lake Como has been transferred to Rome
especially for the occasion;11 then comes a scene in the bushes, etc.,
etc. - you know what I mean! You will say that it’s vulgar and vile to
bring all this out into the marketplace now, after so many raptures and
tears, to which I myself have confessed. But why is it vile, sirs? Can
you really think I’m ashamed of it all, or that it’s all any stupider
than whatever there may have been, gentlemen, in your own lives? And
besides, believe me, some of it was by no means badly composed… And not
all of it took place on Lake Como. However, you’re right, it is indeed
both vulgar and vile. And what’s vilest is that I’ve now started
justifying myself before you. And viler still is that I’m now making
this remark. Enough, however; otherwise there will be no end to it:
things will go on getting viler and viler… I was simply incapable of
dreaming for longer than three months at a time, and would begin to feel
an irresistible need to rush into society. To rush into society in my
case meant to go and visit my department chief, Anton Antonych
Setochkin. He was the only permanent acquaintance I’ve had in my
whole</p>
<p>life, and I’m even surprised now at this circumstance. But even to
him I used to go only when such a spell came, and my dreams had reached
such happiness that I needed, instantly and infallibly, to embrace
people and the whole of mankind - for which I had to have available at
least one really existing person. Anton Antonych, however, could be
visited only on Tuesdays (his day), and consequently my need to embrace
the whole of mankind always had to be adusted to a Tuesday. This Anton
Antonych was located near the Five Corners,12 on the fourth floor and in
four little rooms, low-ceilinged, each one smaller than the last, of a
most economical and yellow appearance. There were two daughters and
their aunt, who poured tea. The daughters, one thirteen and the other
fourteen, were both pug-nosed, and I was terribly abashed before them,
because they constantly whispered together and giggled. The host usually
sat in the study, on a leather sofa in front of the desk, along with
some gray-haired guest, an official from our own or even some other
department. I never saw more than two or three guests there, always the
same ones. They talked about excise, negotiations in the Senate,
salaries, promotions, His Excellency, ways of making oneself liked, and
so on and so forth. I had patience enough to sit it out by these people
like a fool for four hours on end, listening to them, myself not daring
or knowing how to begin talking with them about anything. My mind would
grow dull, I’d break into a sweat several times, paralysis hovered over
me; but this was good and beneficial. On returning home, I’d put off for
a while my desire to embrace the whole of mankind.</p>
<p>I had, however, another acquaintance as it were - Simonov, a former
schoolfellow. No doubt there were many of my schoolfellows in
Petersburg, but I did not associate with them, and had even stopped
nodding to them in the street. I perhaps got myself transferred to
another department so as not to be together with them and to cut off all
at once the whole of that hateful childhood of mine. Curses on that
school, on those terrible years of penal servitude! In short, I parted
ways with my fellows as soon as I was set free. There were two or
three</p>
<p>people left whom I still greeted when we met. Among them was Simonov,
who had not been distinguished for anything in our school, was quiet and
equable, but in whom I distinguished a certain independence of character
and even honesty. I do not even think he was so very narrow-minded. I
had once had some rather bright moments with him, but they did not last
long and somehow suddenly clouded over. These recollections were
apparently burdensome for him, and it seemed he kept being afraid I
would lapse into the former tone. I suspected that he found me quite
disgusting, but I kept going to him all the same, having no sure
assurance of it.</p>
<p>And so once, on a Thursday, unable to endure my solitude, and knowing
that on Thursdays Anton Antonych’s door was closed, I remembered about
Simonov. On the way up to his fourth-floor apartment, I was precisely
thinking that I was a burden to this gentleman and that I shouldn’t be
going to him. But since in the end such considerations, as if by design,
always egged me on further into some ambiguous situation, I did go in.
It was almost a year since I had last seen Simonov.</p>
