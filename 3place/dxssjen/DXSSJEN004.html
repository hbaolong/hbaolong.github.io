<h4 id="iii">III</h4>
<p>What happens, for example, with people who know how to take revenge
and generally how to stand up for themselves? Once they are overcome,
say, by vengeful feeling, then for the time there is simply nothing left
in their whole being but this feeling. Such a gentleman just lunges
straight for his goal like an enraged bull, horns lowered, and maybe
only a wall can stop him. (Incidentally: before a wall, these gentlemen
- that is, ingenuous people and active figures - quite sincerely fold.
For them a wall is not a deflection, as it is, for example, for us,
people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not a pretext for
turning back, a pretext which our sort usually doesn’t believe in but is
always very glad to have. No, they fold in all sincerity. For them a
wall possesses something soothing, morally resolving and final, perhaps
even something mystical… But of the wall later.) Well, sirs, it is just
such an ingenuous man that I regard as the real, normal man, the way his
tender mother - nature - herself wished to see him when she so kindly
conceived him on earth. I envy such a man to the point of extreme bile.
He is stupid, I won’t argue with you about that, but perhaps a normal
man ought to be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it’s even very
beautiful. And I am the more convinced of this, so to speak, suspicion,
seeing that if, for example, one takes the antithesis of the normal man,
that is, the man of heightened consciousness, who came, of course, not
from the bosom of nature but from a retort (this is almost mysticism,
gentlemen, but I suspect that, too), this retort man sometimes folds
before his antithesis so far that he honestly regards himself, with all
his heightened consciousness, as a</p>
<p>mouse and not a man. A highly conscious mouse, perhaps, but a mouse
all the same, whereas here we have a man, and consequently… and so on…
And, above all, it is he, he himself, who regards himself as a mouse; no
one asks him to; and that is an important point.</p>
<p>Let us now have a look at this mouse in action. Suppose, for example,
that it, too, is offended (and it is almost always offended), and it,
too, wishes to take revenge. For it may have stored up even more spite
than l’homme de la nature et de la verite.4 The nasty, base little
desire to pay the offender back with the same evil may scratch still
more nastily in it than in l’homme de la nature et de la verite, because
l’homme de le nature et de la verite, with his innate stupidity, regards
his revenge quite simply as justice; whereas the mouse, as a result of
its heightened consciousness, denies it any justice. Things finally come
down to the business itself, to the act of revenge itself. The wretched
mouse, in addition to the one original nastiness, has already managed to
fence itself about with so many other nastinesses in the form of
questions and doubts; it has padded out the one question with so many
unresolved questions that, willy-nilly, some fatal slops have
accumulated around it, some stinking filth consisting of its dubieties,
anxieties, and, finally, of the spit raining on it from the ingenuous
figures who stand solemnly around it like judges and dictators,
guffawing at it from all their healthy gullets. Of course, nothing
remains for it but to wave the whole thing aside with its little paw
and, with a smile of feigned contempt, in which it does not believe
itself, slip back shamefacedly into its crack. There, in its loathsome,
stinking underground, our offended, beaten-down, and derided mouse at
once immerses itself in cold, venomous, and, above all, everlasting
spite. For forty years on end it will recall its offense to the last,
most shameful details, each time adding even more shameful details of
its own, spitefully taunting and chafing itself with its fantasies. It
will be ashamed of its fantasies, but all the same it will recall
everything, go over everything, heap all sorts of figments on itself,
under the pretext that they, too, could have happened, and forgive
nothing. It may even begin to take</p>
<p>revenge, but somehow in snatches, with piddling things, from behind
the stove, incognito, believing neither in its right to revenge itself
nor in the success of its vengeance, and knowing beforehand that it will
suffer a hundred times more from all its attempts at revenge than will
the object of its vengeance, who will perhaps not even scratch at the
bite. On its deathbed it will again recall everything, adding the
interest accumulated over all that time, and… But it is precisely in
this cold, loathsome half-despair, half-belief, in this conscious
burying oneself alive from grief for forty years in the underground, in
this assiduously produced and yet somewhat dubious hopelessness of one’s
position, in all this poison of unsatisfied desires penetrating inward,
in all this fever of hesitations, of decisions taken forever, and
repentances coming again a moment later, that the very sap of that
strange pleasure I was talking about consists. It is so subtle,
sometimes so elusive of consciousness, that people who are even the
slightest bit narrow-minded, or who simply have strong nerves, will not
understand a single trace of it. “Perhaps,“ you will add, grinning,
“those who have never been slapped will also not understand“ - thereby
politely hinting that I, too, may have experienced a slap in my life,
and am therefore speaking as a connoisseur. I’ll bet that’s what you
think. But calm yourselves, gentlemen, I have not received any slaps,
though it’s all quite the same to me whatever you may think about it.
Perhaps I myself am sorry for having dealt out too few slaps in my life.
But enough, not another word on this subject which you find so extremely
interesting.</p>
<p>I calmly continue about people with strong nerves, who do not
understand a certain refinement of pleasure. In the face of some
mishaps, for example, these gentlemen may bellow at the top of their
lungs like bulls, and let’s suppose this brings them the greatest honor,
but still, as I’ve already said, they instantly resign themselves before
impossibility. Impossibility - meaning a stone wall? What stone wall?
Well, of course, the laws of nature, the conclusions of natural science,
mathematics. Once it’s proved to you, for example, that you descended
from an ape, there’s no use making a wry face, just take it for what it
is. Once</p>
<p>it’s proved to you that, essentially speaking, one little drop of
your own fat should be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your
fellow men, and that in this result all so-called virtues and
obligations and other ravings and prejudices will finally be resolved,
go ahead and accept it, there’s nothing to be done, because two times
two is - mathematics. Try objecting to that.5</p>
<p>“For pity’s sake,“ they’ll shout at you, “you can’t rebel: it’s two
times two is four! Nature doesn’t ask your permission; it doesn’t care
about your wishes, or whether you like its laws or not. You’re obliged
to accept it as it is, and consequently all its results as well. And so
a wall is indeed a wall… etc., etc.“ My God, but what do I care about
the laws of nature and arithmetic if for some reason these laws and two
times two is four are not to my liking? To be sure, I won’t break
through such a wall with my forehead if I really have not got strength
enough to do it, but neither will I be reconciled with it simply because
I have a stone wall here and have not got strength enough.</p>
<p>As if such a stone wall were truly soothing and truly contained in
itself at least some word on the world, solely by being two times two is
four. Oh, absurdity of absurdities! Quite another thing is to understand
all, to be conscious of all, all impossibilities and stone walls; not to
be reconciled with a single one of these impossibilities and stone walls
if you are loath to be reconciled; to reach, by way of the most
inevitable logical combinations, the most revolting conclusions on the
eternal theme that you yourself seem somehow to blame even for the stone
wall, though once again it is obviously clear that you are in no way to
blame; and in consequence of that, silently and impo-tently gnashing
your teeth, to come to a voluptuous standstill in inertia, fancying
that, as it turns out, there isn’t even anyone to be angry with; that
there is no object to be found, and maybe never will be; that it’s all a
sleight-of-hand, a stacked deck, a cheat, that it’s all just slops -
nobody knows what and nobody knows who, but in spite of all the
uncertainties and stacked decks, it still hurts, and the more uncertain
you are, the more it hurts!</p>
