<h4 id="iv">IV</h4>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Next you’ll be finding pleasure in a toothache!“ you will
exclaim, laughing. “And why not? There is also pleasure in a toothache,“
I will answer. I had a toothache for a whole month; I know there is.
Here, of course, one does not remain silently angry, one moans; but
these are not straightforward moans, they are crafty moans, and the
craftiness is the whole point. These moans express the pleasure of the
one who is suffering; if they did not give him pleasure, he wouldn’t
bother moaning. It’s a good example, gentlemen, and I shall develop it.
In these moans there is expressed, first, all the futility of our pain,
so humiliating for our consciousness, and all the lawfulness of nature,
on which, to be sure, you spit, but from which you suffer all the same,
while it does not. There is expressed the consciousness that your enemy
is nowhere to be found, and yet there is pain; the consciousness that,
despite all possible Wagenheims,6 you are wholly the slave of your
teeth; that if someone wishes, your teeth will stop aching, and if not,
they will go on aching for another three months; and that, finally, if
you still do not agree, and protest even so, then the only consolation
you have left is to whip yourself, or give your wall a painful beating
with your fist, and decidedly nothing else. Well, sir, it is with these
bloody offenses, with these mockeries from no one knows whom, that the
pleasure finally begins, sometimes reaching the highest sensuality. I
ask you, gentlemen: listen sometime to the moaning of an educated man of
the nineteenth century who is suffering from a toothache - say, on the
second or third day of his ailment, when he’s beginning to moan not as
he did on the first day, that is, not simply because he has a toothache,
not like some coarse peasant, but like a man touched by development and
European civilization, like a man who has “renounced the soil and
popular roots,“ as they say nowadays.7 His moans somehow turn bad,
nastilv wicked, and continue for whole davs and nights. Yet he</p>
<p>himself knows that his moans will be of no use to him; he knows
better than anyone that he is only straining and irritating himself and
others in vain; he knows that even the public before whom he is exerting
himself, and his whole family, are already listening to him with
loathing, do not believe even a pennyworth of it, and understand in
themselves that he could moan differently, more simply, without roulades
and flourishes, and that it’s just from spite and craftiness that he is
playing around like that. Now, it is in all these consciousnesses and
disgraces that the sensuality consists. “So I’m bothering you, straining
your hearts, not letting anyone in the house sleep. Don’t sleep, then;
you, too, should feel every moment that I have a toothache. For you I’m
no longer a hero, as I once wished to appear, but simply a vile little
fellow, a chenapan.8 Well, so be it! I’m very glad you’ve gotten to the
bottom of me. It’s nasty for you listening to my mean little moans? Let
it be nasty, then; here’s an even nastier roulade for you…“ You still
don’t understand, gentlemen? No, evidently one must attain a profundity
of development and consciousness to understand all the curves of this
sensuality! You’re laughing? I’m very glad. To be sure, gentlemen, my
jokes are in bad tone - uneven, confused, self-mistrustful. But that is
simply because I don’t respect myself. How can a man of consciousness
have the slightest respect for himself?</p>
