<h4 id="i">I</h4>
<p>XAnd now, full mistress of the place, Come bold and free into my
house.</p>
<p>From the same poetry</p>
<p>I stood before her, destroyed, branded, disgustingly embarrassed,
and, I think, smiling, trying as hard as I could to wrap myself in my
ragged old quilted dressing gown - well, exactly as I had pictured to
myself recently in fallen spirits. Apollon hovered around us for about
two minutes and then left, but that made it no easier for me. Worst of
all was that she, too, suddenly became embarrassed, much more so than I
would even have expected. From looking at me, of course.</p>
<p>“Sit down,“ I said mechanically, and moved a chair out for her at the
table, while I myself sat on the sofa. She sat down at once and
obediently, staring at me all eyes, apparently expecting something from
me right then. The naivety of this expectation infuriated me, but I
restrained myself.</p>
<p>The thing to do here would have been to try not to notice anything,
as if it were all quite ordinary, but she … And I sensed vaguely that
she was going to pay dearly for it all…</p>
<p>“You find me in an odd situation, Liza,“ I began, stammering, and
knowing that this was precisely not how I should have begun.</p>
<p>“No, no, don’t think anything of the sort!“ I cried, seeing her
suddenly blush. “I’m not ashamed of my poverty… On the contrary, I look
upon my poverty with pride. I’m poor, but noble… One can be poor and
noble,“ I went on mumbling. “However… would you like some tea?“</p>
<p>“No …“ she tried to begin.</p>
<p>“Wait!“</p>
<p>I jumped up and ran to Apollon. I really had to vanish somewhere.</p>
<p>“Apollon,“ I whispered in a feverish patter, flinging down before him
the seven roubles, which had remained in my fist</p>
<p>all the while, “here’s your wages; see, I’m giving it to you; but for
that you must save me: go at once and bring some tea and ten rusks from
the tavern. If you refuse to go, you’ll ruin a man’s happiness. You
don’t know what this woman is… This is -everything. You’re perhaps
having certain thoughts … But you don’t know what this woman is!…“</p>
<p>Apollon, who had already sat down to work, and had already put his
spectacles back on, at first, without abandoning his needle, silently
cast a sidelong glance at the money; then, paying no attention to me and
not answering me at all, he went on fussing with his thread, which he
was still trying to put through the needle. I waited for about three
minutes, standing before him, my arms folded a la Napoleon. My temples
were damp with sweat; I was pale, I could sense it. But, thank God, he
must have felt sorry looking at me. Having finished with his needle, he
slowly rose from his seat, slowly moved the chair aside, slowly took off
his spectacles, slowly counted the money, and at last, having asked me
over his shoulder: should he get a full portion? - slowly walked out of
the room. As I was returning to Liza, it occurred to me on the way: why
don’t I flee, just as I am, in my wretched old dressing gown, wherever
my feet take me, and come what may?</p>
<p>I sat down again. She looked at me anxiously. For several minutes we
said nothing.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill him!“ I suddenly cried, banging my fist so hard on the
table that the ink splashed out of the inkstand.</p>
<p>“Ah! What is it!“ she cried with a start.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill him, I’ll kill him!“ I was shrieking, pounding on the
table, in a perfect frenzy, and at the same time with a perfect
understanding of how stupid it was to be in such a frenzy.</p>
<p>“You don’t know, Liza, what this hangman is for me. He’s my hangman…
He’s just gone to get some rusks; he…“</p>
<p>And I suddenly broke down in tears. It was a fit. Oh, how ashamed I
was between sobs; but I could no longer hold them back.</p>
<p>She was frightened. “What is it! What’s the matter!“ she kept crying
out, bustling around me.</p>
<p>“Water, give me water, over there!“ I murmured in a weak voice,
conscious, however, within myself, that I was quite well able to do
without water and not to murmur in a weak voice. But I was putting on a
show, as they say, to preserve decency, though the fit was a real
one.</p>
<p>She gave me water, looking at me as if lost. At that moment Apollon
brought in the tea. It suddenly seemed to me that this ordinary and
prosaic tea was terribly indecent and measly after all that had
happened, and I blushed. Liza looked at Apollon even fearfully. He went
out without glancing at us.</p>
<p>“Liza, do you despise me?“ I said, looking at her point-blank,
trembling with impatience to find out what she thought.</p>
<p>She became embarrassed, and was unable to reply.</p>
<p>“Drink your tea!“ I said spitefully. I was angry with myself, but,
naturally, she was going to bear the brunt of it. A terrible spite
against her suddenly boiled up in my heart; I think I could simply have
killed her. To be revenged on her, I swore mentally not to speak even
one word to her from then on. “It’s she who caused it all,“ I
thought.</p>
<p>Our silence had already lasted some five minutes. The tea sat on the
table; we didn’t touch it: it went so far that I purposely refused to
begin drinking, so as to make it still harder for her; and it would have
been awkward for her to begin. Several times she glanced at me in sad
perplexity. I was stubbornly silent. The chief martyr, of course, was
myself, because I was fully conscious of all the loathsome baseness of
my spiteful stupidity, and at the same time I simply could not restrain
myself.</p>
<p>“I want… to get out of there… for good,“ she tried to begin, in order
to break the silence somehow, but, poor thing! she precisely ought not
to have started with that at such a moment, stupid as it was to begin
with, or to such a man, stupid as I was to begin with. Even my heart
ached from pity for her ineptness and unnecessary candor. But something
ugly immediately suppressed all pity in me; it even egged me on still
more: perish the whole world! Another five minutes passed.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I’ve disturbed you?“ she began timidly, in a barely audible
voice, and started to get up.</p>
<p>But as soon as I saw this first flash of injured dignity I simply
trembled with anger and at once burst out.</p>
<p>“What did you come to me for, do tell me, please?“ I began,
suffocating, and not even considering the logical order of my words. I
wanted to speak everything out at once, in one shot; I didn’t even care
where I began.</p>
<p>“Why did you come? Answer! Answer!“ I kept exclaiming, all but beside
myself. “I’ll tell you why you came, my dear. You came because of the
pathetic words I used with you then. So you went all soft, and you
wanted more ‘pathetic words.’ Know, then, know that I was laughing at
you that time. And I’m laughing now. Why do you tremble? Yes, laughing!
I’d been insulted earlier, at dinner, by the ones who came there ahead
of me. I came there to give a thrashing to one of them, the officer; but
I didn’t succeed, he wasn’t there; I needed to unload my offense on
someone, to get my own back, and you turned up, so I poured out my spite
and laughed at you. I’d been humiliated, so I, too, wanted to humiliate;
they’d ground me down like a rag, so I, too, wanted to show my power…
That’s what it was, and you thought I came then on purpose to save you,
right? That’s what you thought? That’s what you thought?“</p>
<p>I knew she might perhaps get confused and not understand the details;
but I also knew she’d understand the essence perfectly well. And so it
happened. She turned white as a sheet, tried to utter something, her
mouth twisted painfully; but, as if cut down with an axe, she sank onto
the chair. And all the rest of the time she listened to me with open
mouth, with wide open eyes, and trembling in terrible fear. The
cynicism, the cynicism of my words crushed her…</p>
<p>“To save you!“ I went on, jumping up from my chair and running back
and forth in front of her, “to save you from what! But maybe I’m worse
than you are. Why didn’t you fling it in my mug when I started reading
you my oration: And you, what did you come here for? To teach us morals,
or what?’ Power, power, that’s what I wanted then, the game was what I
wanted, I wanted to achieve your tears, your humiliation, your hysterics
- that’s what I wanted then! But I couldn’t stand it myself,</p>
<p>because I’m trash, I got all scared and, like a fool, gave you my
address, devil knows why. And afterwards, even before I got home, I was
already cursing you up and down for that address. I already hated you,
because I’d lied to you then. Because I only talk a good game, I only
dream in my head, but do you know what I want in reality? That you all
go to hell, that’s what! I want peace. I’d sell the whole world for a
kopeck this minute, just not to be bothered. Shall the world go to hell,
or shall I not have my tea? I say let the world go to hell, but I should
always have my tea. Did you know that or not? Well, and I do know that
I’m a blackguard, a scoundrel, a self-lover, a lazybones. I spent these
past three days trembling for fear you might come. And do you know what
particularly bothered me all these three days? That I had presented
myself to you as such a hero then, and now you’d suddenly see me in this
torn old dressing gown, abject, vile. I just told you I was not ashamed
of my poverty, know, then, that I am ashamed, I’m ashamed of it most of
all, afraid of it more than anything, more than of being a thief,
because I’m so vain it’s as if I’d been flayed and the very air hurts
me. But can you possibly not have realized even now that I will never
forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing gown, as I was
hurling myself like a vicious little cur at Apollon? The resurrector,
the former hero, flinging himself like a mangy, shaggy mutt at his
lackey, who just laughs at him! And those tears a moment ago, which,
like an ashamed woman, I couldn’t hold back before you, I will never
forgive you! And what I’m confessing to you now, I will also never
forgive you! Yes - you, you alone must answer for all this, because you
turned up here, because I’m a scoundrel, because I’m the most vile, the
most ridiculous, the most petty, the most stupid, the most envious of
all worms on earth, who are in no way better than I, but who, devil
knows why, are never embarrassed; while I will just go on being flicked
all my life by every nit - that’s my trait! Besides, what do I care if
you won’t understand a word of it! And what, tell me, what, what do I
care about you and whether you’re perishing there or not? Do you
understand, now that I’ve spoken it all out to you, how I’m</p>
<p>going to hate you for being here and listening? Because a man speaks
out like this only once in his life, and then only in hysterics!… What
more do you want? Why, after all this, do you still stick there in front
of me, tormenting me, refusing to leave?“</p>
<p>But here a strange circumstance suddenly occurred.</p>
<p>I was so used to thinking and imagining everything from books, and to
picturing everything in the world to myself as I had devised it
beforehand in my dreams, that at first I didn’t even understand this
strange circumstance. What occurred was this: Liza, whom I had insulted
and crushed, understood far more than I imagined. She understood from it
all what a woman, if she loves sincerely, always understands before
anything else - namely, that I myself was unhappy.</p>
<p>The frightened and insulted feeling in her face first gave way to
rueful amazement. And when I began calling myself a scoundrel and a
blackguard, and my tears poured down (I had spoken the entire tirade in
tears), her whole face twisted in a sort of convulsion. She wanted to
get up, to stop me; and when I came to the end, she paid no attention to
my cries: “Why are you here, why don’t you leave!“ but only to how very
hard it must have been for me to speak it all out. Besides, she was so
downtrodden, poor thing; she considered herself infinitely beneath me;
how could she be angry or offended? She suddenly jumped from her chair
on some irrepressible impulse, and, all yearning towards me, but still
timidly, not daring to move from the spot, stretched out her arms to me…
Here my heart, too, turned over in me. Then she suddenly rushed to me,
threw her arms about my neck, and burst into tears. I, too, could not
help myself and broke into such sobbing as had never happened to me
before…</p>
<p>“They won’t let me… I can’t be… good!“ I barely articulated, then
went to the sofa, fell face down, and sobbed for a quarter of an hour in
real hysterics. She leaned towards me, embraced me, and remained as if
frozen in that embrace.</p>
<p>But still, the hitch was that the hysterics did have to end. And so
(I am writing the loathsome truth), lying prone on the</p>
<p>sofa, my face buried hard in the wretched leather cushion, I began
little by little, remotely, involuntarily, but irresistibly, to feel
that it would be awkward now to raise my head and look straight into
Liza’s eyes. What was I ashamed of? I don’t know, but I was ashamed. It
also came into my agitated head that the roles were now finally
reversed, that she was now the heroine, and I was the same crushed and
humiliated creature as she had been before me that night - four days ago
… And all this came to me during those minutes when I was still lying
prone on the sofa!</p>
<p>My God! but can it be that I envied her then?</p>
<p>I don’t know, to this day I cannot decide, and then, of course, I was
even less able to understand it than now. For without power and tyranny
over someone, I really cannot live… But… but reasoning explains nothing,
and consequently there’s no point in reasoning.</p>
<p>I mastered myself, however, and raised my head; indeed, I had to
raise it sometime… And then - I am convinced of it even to this day -
precisely because I was ashamed to look at her, another feeling suddenly
kindled and flared up in my heart… the feeling of domination and
possession. My eyes gleamed with passion, and I squeezed her hands hard.
How I hated her and how drawn I was to her at that moment! One feeling
intensified the other. This was almost like revenge!… At first, a look
as if of perplexity, even as if of fear, came to her face, but only for
a moment. She embraced me rapturously and ardently.</p>
