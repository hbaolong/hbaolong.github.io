<h4 id="vii">VII</h4>
<p>Eh, come now, Liza, what have books got to do with it, if I myself
feel vile for your sake. And not only for your sake. It all just rose up
in my soul… Can it be, can it be that you don’t find it vile here? No,
habit evidently counts for a lot! Devil knows what habit can’t make of a
person. But can it be that you seriously think you’ll never get old,
that you’ll be forever good-looking, and they’ll keep you here forever
and ever? It’s foul enough even here, needless to say… However, this is
what I can tell you about that, I mean, about your present life: granted
you’re young, attractive, nice, with a soul, with feelings; well, but do
you know that when I came to my senses just now, I immediately felt vile
for being here with you! One has to be drunk to end up here. But if you
were in a different place, living as good people live, I might not just
dangle after you, but simply fall in love with you, and be glad if you
merely glanced at me, let alone spoke. I’d watch for you by the gate,
I’d stay forever on my knees before you; I’d look upon you as</p>
<p>my fiancee, and regard it as an honor. I wouldn’t dare even think
anything impure about you. While here I know I just have to whistle and,
like it or not, you’ll go with me, and it’s no longer I who ask your
will, but you mine. The merest peasant hires himself out to work - yet
his bondage isn’t total; besides, he knows there’s a term to it. But
where is your term? Just think: what is it you’re giving up here? What
are you putting in bondage? It’s your soul, your soul, over which you
have no power, that you put in bondage along with your body! You give
your love to be profaned by any drunkard! Love! - but this is
everything, it’s a diamond, a maiden’s treasure, this love! To deserve
this love a man would be ready to lay down his soul, to face death. And
what is the value of your love now? You’re all bought, bought outright,
and why try to obtain love if everything is possible without love?
There’s no worse offense for a girl, do you understand that? Now, I’ve
heard that they humor you, fools that you are - they allow you to have
lovers here. That’s only an indulgence, only a deception, only a mockery
of you, yet you believe it. What, does he really love you, this lover? I
don’t believe it. How can he love you, when he knows that you’ll be
called away from him any moment. He’s a rotter in that case! Does he
have even a drop of respect for you? What do you have in common with
him? He’s laughing at you while he steals from you - that’s what his
love amounts to! You can be thankful if he doesn’t beat you. But maybe
he does. Ask yours, if you have one: will he marry you? He’ll burst out
laughing in your face, if he doesn’t spit, or give you a beating -and
meanwhile his total worth is maybe two broken kopecks. And for the sake
of what, one wonders, have you ruined your life here? For having coffee
to drink, and being well fed? But what do they feed you for? Another
woman, an honest one, would choke on it, because she’d know what they’re
feeding her for. You’re in debt here, so you’ll stay in debt, and you’ll
be in debt till the final end, till the time when the clients start
spurning you. And that will come soon, don’t count on your youth. It all
flies by posthaste here. So they’ll kick you out. And not simply kick
you out, but first start picking on you long</p>
<p>beforehand, reproaching you, abusing you - as if it wasn’t you who
gave her your health, destroyed your youth and soul for her in vain, but
as if it was you who ruined her, beggared her, robbed her. And don’t
look for any support: the other girls will also attack you, to get in
good with her, because everyone here is a slave and has long since lost
all conscience and compassion. They’re sunk in meanness, and no abuse in
the world is more foul, mean, or offensive than that. And you’ll lay
down everything here, everything without stint - health, and youth, and
beauty, and hopes - and at twenty-two you’ll look like you’re
thirty-five, and you’ll be lucky if you’re not sick, pray to God for
that. You must be thinking now that it’s a picnic and not work at all!
But there is not and never has been any harder or harsher work in the
world than this. One would think your heart alone would simply pour
itself out in tears. And you won’t dare say a word, not half a word,
when they throw you out of here; you’ll go as if you were the one to
blame. You’ll go to another place, then to a third, then somewhere else,
and finally you’ll reach the Haymarket. And there they’ll give you the
routine beating; it’s a courtesy of the place; there a client can’t even
be nice to a girl without beating her first. You don’t believe it’s so
disgusting there? Go and look someday, maybe you’ll see with your own
eyes. I once saw a girl there, alone, by the door, on New Year’s day.
Her own people had kicked her out for the fun of it, to cool her off a
bit, because she was howling too much, and locked the door behind her.
At nine o’clock in the morning she was already completely drunk,
disheveled, half-naked, all beaten up. Her face was powdered white, and
her eyes were black-and-blue; blood was flowing from her nose and teeth:
some coachman had just given her a pasting. She sat down on the stone
stairs, holding some kind of salted fish; she was howling and wailing
something about her ‘miserble lot,’ beating her fish against the steps.
And coachmen and drunken soldiers crowded around the steps, teasing her.
You don’t believe you’ll be the same? I wouldn’t want to believe it
either, but how do you know, maybe this same girl, the one with the
salted fish, came here from somewhere ten or, say, eight years ago,
fresh as</p>
<p>a little cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, and blushing at
every word. Maybe she was just like you - proud, touchy, different from
the rest; she had the look of a princess, and knew that complete
happiness awaited the one who would love her, and whom she would love.
See where it ended up? And what if at the same moment as she sat there,
drunk and disheveled, beating her fish on the dirty steps, what if at
that moment she recalled all her former pure years in her father’s
house, when she was still going to school, and the neighbor’s son used
to watch for her on the way, assured her he would love her all his life,
that he would make his fate hers, and they made a vow together to love
each other forever and to be married as soon as they got bigger! No,
Liza, it will be lucky, lucky for you if you die quickly of consumption,
someplace in a corner, in a basement, like that girl. In a hospital, you
say? If they take you there, fine, but what if your madam still needs
you? Consumption is that sort of illness; it’s not a fever. A person
goes on hoping till the last moment, saying he’s well. It’s just
self-indulgence. But there’s profit in it for the madam. Don’t worry,
it’s true; you’ve sold your soul, you owe money besides, so you don’t
dare make a peep. And when you’re dying, they’ll all abandon you,
they’ll all turn away from you - because what good are you then? They’ll
even reproach you for uselessly taking up space and not dying quickly
enough. You’ll have a hard time getting a drink of water, they’ll give
it to you with a curse: ‘Hurry up and croak, you slut; you’re moaning,
people can’t sleep, the clients are disgusted.’ It’s true; I’ve
overheard such words myself. They’ll shove you, on the point of
croaking, into the stinkingest corner of the basement - dark, damp; what
will you go over in your mind then, lying there alone? You’ll die -
they’ll lay you out hurriedly, strangers’ hands, grumblingly,
impatiently - and no one will bless you, no one will sigh over you, all
they’ll think is how to get you off their backs quickly. They’ll buy a
pine box, take you out as they did that poor girl today, and go to a
pothouse to commemorate you. There’s slush, muck, wet snow in the grave
— they won’t go to any trouble over you. ’Lower her in, Vanyukha; look
at this “miserble</p>
<p>lot“ going legs up even here - the so-and-so. Shorten the ropes, you
rascal.’ ‘It’ll do as it is.’ ‘What’ll do? She’s lying on her side. You
got a human being here, don’t you? Well, that’ll do, fill it in.’ They
won’t even want to argue long because of you. They’ll cover you up
quickly with wet blue clay and go to the pothouse … That’s the end of
your memory on earth; other people’s graves are visited by children,
fathers, husbands, but at yours -not a tear, not a sigh, not a prayer,
and no one, no one in the whole world will ever come to you; your name
will disappear from the face of the earth - as if you’d never existed,
as if you’d never been born! Mud and swamp, go ahead and knock on your
coffin lid at night, when dead men rise: ’Let me out, good people, to
live in the world! I lived - but saw nothing of life, my life was used
up like an old rag; it got drunk up in a pothouse on the Haymarket; let
me out, good people, to live in the world one more time!</p>
<p>I waxed pathetic, so much so that I myself was about to have a spasm
in my throat, when… suddenly I stopped, raised myself in alarm, and,
inclining my head fearfully, with pounding heart, began to listen. I
indeed had reason to be troubled.</p>
<p>For a long time already I’d sensed that I had turned her whole soul
over and broken her heart and the more convinced of it I was, the more I
wished to reach my goal quickly and as forcefully as possible. It was
the game, the game that fascinated me; not just the game, however…</p>
<p>I knew I’d been speaking stiffly, affectedly, even bookishly; in
short, I couldn’t speak any other way than “as if from a book.“ But that
didn’t trouble me; I knew, I sensed that I’d be understood, and that
this very bookishness might even help things along. But now, having
achieved my effect, I suddenly turned coward. No, never, never before
had I witnessed such despair! She was lying prone, her face buried deep
in her pillow, which she embraced with both arms. Her breast was
bursting. Her whole young body was shuddering as in convulsions.
Suppressed sobs were straining, tearing her breast, and would suddenly
burst out in wails and cries. Then she’d cling to her pillow even more:
she did not want anyone there, not a living</p>
<p>soul, to learn of her torment and tears. She bit the pillow, she bit
into her hand till it bled (I saw it later), or, clutching her loosened
braids, she would go stiff with effort, holding her breath and clenching
her teeth. I started to say something to her, to beg her to calm down,
but felt I didn’t dare, and suddenly, all in a sort of fever myself,
almost horrified, I rushed gropingly, in haphazard haste, to get myself
ready to go. It was dark: no matter how I tried, I couldn’t finish
quickly. Suddenly I touched a box of matches and a candlestick with a
whole, unused candle. As soon as light shone in the room, Liza suddenly
rose, sat up, and looked at me almost senselessly, with a somehow
distorted face and a half-crazed smile. I sat down next to her and took
her hands; she recovered herself, made a quick move as if to embrace me,
but did not dare, and quietly bowed her head before me.</p>
<p>“Liza, my friend, I shouldn’t have … forgive me,“ I tried to begin,
but she squeezed my hands in her fingers with such force that I realized
I was saying the wrong thing and stopped.</p>
<p>“Here’s my address, Liza, come to me.“</p>
<p>“I will…“ she whispered resolutely, still without raising her
head.</p>
<p>“And now I’ll go, good-bye… till then.“</p>
<p>I got up, she got up as well, and suddenly blushed all over, gave a
start, grabbed a shawl that was lying on a chair, and wrapped her
shoulders in it all the way to the chin. Having done so, she again
smiled somehow painfully, blushed, and glanced at me strangely. I felt
pained; I was in a hurry to leave, to efface myself.</p>
<p>“Wait,“ she said suddenly, already in the entryway and right at the
door, stopping me with a hand on my overcoat, and in a flurry she set
down the candle and ran off - she must have remembered something or
wanted to bring something to show me. As she ran off, she blushed all
over, her eyes shone, a smile appeared on her lips - what could it mean?
Like it or nor, I had to wait; she came back in a minute, her eyes as if
apologizing for something. Generally, this was no longer the same face,
the same look as before - sullen, mistrustful, and obstinate. Now</p>
<p>her eyes were soft, pleading, and at the same time trustful, tender,
timid. Children look that way at someone they love very much, when
they’re asking for something. She had light brown eyes, beautiful eyes,
alive, capable of reflecting both love and sullen hatred.</p>
<p>Without explaining anything - as if, like some higher being, I must
know everything without explanations - she handed me a piece of paper.
Her whole face simply lit up at that moment with the most naive,
childlike triumph. I unfolded it. It was a letter to her from some
medical student or the like - a very grandiloquent, flowery, but
extremely respectful declaration of love. I don’t remember the
expressions now, but I remember very well that through the high-flown
style one caught glimpses of true feeling, which cannot be feigned. When
I finished reading, I met her ardent, curious, and childishly impatient
gaze on me. Her eyes were riveted to my face, and she waited impatiently
- what would I say? In a few words, haphazardly, but somehow joyfully
and as if proudly, she explained to me that she had been at a dancing
party somewhere, in a family home, the home of some “very, very nice
people, family people, and where they still know nothing, nothing at
all,“ because she’s still quite new here and just… and hasn’t at all
decided to stay yet, and will certainly leave as soon as she’s paid her
debt… “Well, and there was this student, dancing and talking with her
all evening, and it turned out he had known her still in Riga, still as
a child, they had played together, only very long ago - and he knew her
parents, but he knows nothing, nothing, nothing about this and doesn’t
even suspect! And so, the next day after the dance (three days ago), he
sent her this letter through a girlfriend with whom she’d gone to the
party… and… well, that’s all.“</p>
<p>She lowered her flashing eyes somehow shyly as she finished telling
me.</p>
<p>Poor little thing, she was keeping this student’s letter as a
treasure, and had run to fetch her only treasure, not wishing me to
leave without knowing that she, too, was loved honestly and sincerely,
that she, too, was spoken to respectfully. Most likely</p>
<p>he letter was doomed simply to lie in a box without consequences. But
what matter; I’m sure she would keep it all her life as a treasure, as
her pride and justification, and now, at such a moment, she remembered
the letter and brought it out to take naive pride before me, to restore
herself in my eyes, so that I, too, should see, and I, too, should
praise. I said nothing, pressed her hand, and walked out. I wanted so
much to leave… I went the whole way on foot, in spite of the wet snow
still falling in thick flakes. I was worn out, crushed, perplexed. But
the truth was already shining through my perplexity. The nasty
truth!</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>It took me a while, however, to consent to recognize this truth.
Having awakened in the morning after several hours of deep, leaden
sleep, and having come at once to a realization of the whole day
yesterday, I was even amazed at my yesterday’s sentimentality with Liza,
at all of “yesterday’s horrors and pities.“ “Now there’s a real fit of
womanish nerves, pah!“ I decided. “And why on earth did I shove my
address at her? What if she comes? However, why not, let her come; it’s
no matter…“ But, obviously, that was not the main and most important
thing now: I had to make haste and, whatever the cost, quickly save my
reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov. That was the main thing.
And I even quite forgot about Liza that morning, what with all the
bustle.</p>
<p>First of all, I had immediately to return yesterday’s debt to
Simonov. I resolved on a desperate measure: borrowing a whole fifteen
roubles from Anton Antonovich. As luck would have it, he was in the most
wonderful spirits that day, and handed me the money at once, at my first
request. I was so glad that, as I signed the receipt, with a sort of
bravado, I casually told him that yesterday I had done “a bit of
carousing with some friends at the Hotel de Paris; a farewell party for
a schoolmate, even, one might say, a childhood friend - a big carouser,
you know, a spoiled fellow - well, naturally, from a good family, a</p>
<p>considerable fortune, a brilliant career, witty, charming, intrigues
with all those ladies, you understand; we drank a ‘half-dozen’ too many,
and…“ And nothing to it; it was all spoken very lightly, easily, and
smugly.</p>
<p>Having come home, I wrote at once to Simonov.</p>
<p>To this day I’m filled with admiration as I recall the truly
gentlemanly, good-natured, frank tone of my letter. Adroitly, nobly,
and, above all, with not a word too many - I blamed myself for
everything. I excused myself, “if I may still be permitted to excuse
myself,“ with being quite unaccustomed to wine, and thus becoming drunk
at the first glass, which I (supposedly) drank before them, while
waiting for them from five to six in the Hotel de Paris. I mainly begged
pardon of Simonov; and I asked him to convey my explanations to all the
others, especially Zverkov, whom, “I recall as in a dream,“ I seemed to
have insulted. I added that I would have gone to them all myself, but I
had a headache and, above all, was ashamed. I remained especially
pleased with the “certain lightness,“ even all but casual (though
perfectly decent), that suddenly reflected itself in my pen and at once
gave them to understand, better than any possible reasons, that I looked
upon “all that nastiness yesterday“ quite independently; in no way, by
no means, was I killed on the spot, as you good sirs probably think, but
on the contrary I looked upon it as befits a calmly self-respecting
gentleman. “The errors of youth are soon forgotten,“ as they say.</p>
<p>“And that certain marquisian playfulness, even?“ I admired, rereading
the note. “And all because I’m a developed and educated man! Others in
my place wouldn’t know how to extricate themselves, and here I’ve
wriggled out of it and can go on carousing, and all because I’m ‘an
educated and developed man of our times.’ Besides, maybe it really did
all come from the wine yesterday. Hm… well, no, not from the wine. And I
didn’t drink any vodka between five and six, while I was waiting for
them. I lied to Simonov; lied shamelessly; and even now I’m not
ashamed…</p>
<p>“Ah, spit on it, however! I’m out of it, that’s the main thing.“</p>
<p>I put six roubles into the letter, sealed it, and prevailed upon</p>
<p>Apollon to take it to Simonov. On learning that there was money
inside, Apollon became more respectful and agreed to go. Towards evening
I went out for a stroll. My head was still aching and dizzy from
yesterday. But the more evening advanced and the twilight thickened, the
more my impressions and, after them, my thoughts as well, kept changing
and tangling. Something within me, deep in my heart and conscience,
would not die, refused to die, and betrayed itself in a burning anguish.
I loitered about mainly on the most crowded business streets
-Meshchanskaya, Sadovaya, around the Yusupov Garden. I had always liked
especially to stroll along those streets at twilight, precisely when the
crowd thickens with all sorts of passers-by, merchants, and tradesmen,
their faces preoccupied to the point of anger, going home from their
daily work. I precisely liked this twopenny bustle, this insolent
prosiness. But now all this street jostling only irritated me the more.
I simply could not get hold of myself, could not find the loose ends.
Something in my soul was rising, rising, ceaselessly, painfully, and
refused to be still. I returned home thoroughly upset. Like as if some
crime lay on my soul.</p>
<p>I was constantly tormented by the thought that Liza would come. What
I found strange was that, of all those memories from yesterday, the
memory of her tormented me somehow specially, somehow quite separately.
By evening I had already quite successfully forgotten all the rest,
brushed it aside, and I was still perfectly pleased with my letter to
Simonov. But with this I was somehow not so pleased. It was like as if I
were tormented over Liza alone. “What if she comes?“ I thought
ceaselessly. “Well, no matter, let her come. Hm. The only bad thing is
that she’ll see, for example, how I live. Yesterday I showed myself to
her as such a… hero… and now, hm! It’s bad, however, that I’ve gone so
much to seed. Sheer poverty in the apartment. And I dared go to dinner
yesterday in such clothes! And this oilcloth sofa of mine, with the
stuffing hanging out of it! And this dressing gown that doesn’t even
cover me! Such tatters… And she’ll see all this; and she’ll see Apollon.
The brute is sure to insult her. He’ll pick on her in</p>
<p>order to be rude to me. And I, of course, as is my custom, will turn
coward, start mincing before her, covering myself with the skirts of my
dressing gown, start smiling, start lying. Ohh, vileness! And that’s not
even the chief vileness! There’s something chiefer in it, viler, meaner!
Yes, meaner! And again, again to put on that dishonorable, lying
mask!…“</p>
<p>Having arrived at this thought, I simply flared up:</p>
<p>“Why dishonorable? What’s dishonorable? I spoke sincerely yesterday.
I remember there was also true feeling in me. I precisely wanted to
evoke noble feelings in her… if she cried a bit, that’s good, it’ll have
a good effect…“</p>
<p>But all the same I just could not calm down.</p>
<p>That whole evening, when I’d already returned home, when it was
already past nine and by my reckoning Liza simply could not come, I
still kept imagining her, and I recalled her, mostly, in one and the
same position. Namely, of all that had happened yesterday, I pictured
one moment especially vividly: it was when I lighted up the room with a
match and saw her pale, distorted face with its tormented eyes. And how
pathetic, how unnatural, how twisted her smile was at that moment! But I
did not know then that even after fifteen years I would still be
picturing Liza precisely with the pathetic, twisted, needless smile she
had at that moment.</p>
<p>The next day I was again prepared to regard it all as nonsense,
frazzled nerves, and, above all - exaggeration. I was always aware of
this weak link in me, and at times was very afraid of it: “I’m forever
exaggerating; that’s where I’m lame,“ I repeated to myself at all hours.
But nevertheless, “nevertheless, Liza may still come“ - this was the
refrain with which all my reasonings at that time concluded. I worried
so much that I sometimes became furious. “She’ll come! She’s sure to
come!“ I’d exclaim, running up and down my room. “If not today, then
tomorrow, but she’ll find me! That’s the cursed romanticism of all these
pure hearts! Oh, the vileness, oh, the stupidity, oh, the narrowness of
these ‘rotten, sentimental souls’! How can one not understand, how
indeed can one not understand…“ But here I myself would stop, and even
in great confusion.</p>
<p>“And it took so little, so little talk,“ I thought in passing, “such
a little idyll (an affected idyll besides, a contrived, a bookish one),
to succeed in turning a whole human soul the way I wanted. There’s
virginity for you! There’s the freshness of the soil!“</p>
<p>At times the thought occurred to me of going to her myself, “to tell
her everything“ and prevail upon her not to come to me. But here, at
this thought, such spite rose up in me that I think I would simply have
squashed this “cursed“ Liza if she’d suddenly happened to be there,
insulted her, spat upon her, driven her out, struck her!</p>
<p>A day passed, however, then another, then a third - she did not come,
and I began to calm down. I especially took heart and let myself go
after nine o’clock, I sometimes even began to dream, and that quite
sweetly: “I save Liza,“ for example, “precisely through her coming to
me, and my telling her… I develop her, educate her. I finally notice
that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I
don’t know, however, why I pretend; probably just for the beauty of it).
At last, all confused, beautiful, trembling and weeping, she throws
herself at my feet and says that I am her savior, and that she loves me
more than anything in the world. I am amazed, but… ‘Liza,’ I say, ‘can
you really think I haven’t noticed your love? I saw everything, I
guessed, but I dared not presume first upon your heart, because I had
influence over you and feared lest you, out of gratitude, might
deliberately make yourself return my love, might call up by force a
feeling that perhaps is not there, and I did not want that, because that
is… despotism… It is indelicate’“ (well, in short, here I let my tongue
run away with me in some such European, George-Sandian, ineffably noble
refinement.. .).17 “’But now, now - you are mine, you are my creation,
you are pure, beautiful, you are - my beautiful wife.</p>
<p>And now, full mistress of the place, Come bold and free into my
house.’18</p>
<p>“And then we begin living happily ever after, go abroad, etc., etc.“
In short, I felt vile and would end by sticking my tongue out at
myself.</p>
<p>“They won’t even let the ‘slut’ come!“ I thought. “They don’t seem to
allow them out much, especially in the evening“ (for some reason it
seemed certain to me that she must come in the evening, and precisely at
seven o’clock). “Though she said she’s not completely bound to them yet,
she has some special privileges there; so - hm! Devil take it, she’ll
come, she’s sure to come!</p>
<p>It was a good thing Apollon diverted me at that time with his
rudeness. Drove me out of all patience! He was my thorn, a scourge
visited upon me by Providence. He and I had been in constant altercation
for several years on end, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I
think I’ve never in my life hated anyone as I did him, especially at
certain moments. He was an elderly, imposing man, who occupied himself
part of the time with tailoring. I don’t know why, but he despised me
even beyond all measure and looked at me with an insufferable
haughtiness. But then he looked at everyone with haughtiness. One glance
at that pale-haired, slicked-down head, at the quiff he fluffed up on
his forehead and oiled with vegetable oil, at that serious mouth forever
pursed in a V - and you immediately sensed before you a being who never
doubted himself. He was in the highest degree a pedant, and the most
enormous pedant of any I’ve ever met on earth; and this was accompanied
by a vanity perhaps befitting only Alexander of Macedon. He was in love
with his every button, his every fingernail - absolutely in love, and he
looked it! He treated me quite despotically, spoke extremely little with
me, and if he chanced to let his eyes rest on me, he did so with a firm,
majestically self-confident, and permanently mocking look, which
sometimes drove me to fury. He fulfilled his duties with such an air as
if he were bestowing the highest favor upon me. However, he did almost
exactly nothing for me, and did not even consider himself obliged to do
anything. There was no doubting that he considered me the most complete
fool in the whole world, and if he “kept me around,“ it was solely
because he could get his wages from me every month. He agreed to “do
nothing“ in my service for seven roubles a month. Many sins will be
forgiven me for him. It sometimes reached such hatred</p>
<p>hat I’d be all but thrown into convulsions by his gait alone. But I
loathed his lisp especially. His tongue was a bit longer than it should
have been, or something like that, which caused him to be forever
lisping and sissing, and he was apparently terribly proud of it,
imagining that it lent him a great deal of dignity. He spoke softly,
measuredly, placing his hands behind his back and looking down. He
especially infuriated me when he’d start reading the Psalter behind his
partition. I endured many a battle on account of that reading. But he
liked terribly much to read in the evenings, in a soft, even voice,
chanting as over a dead body. Curiously, that’s how he ended up: he now
hires himself out to read the Psalter over the deceased, and along with
that he exterminates rats and makes shoe polish. But at the time I was
unable to throw him out, as though he had combined chemically with my
existence. Besides, he would not have agreed to leave me for anything.
It was impossible for me to live in chambres garnies:19my apartment was
my mansion, my shell, my case, in which I hid from all mankind, and
Apollon, it seemed to me -devil knows why - belonged to that apartment,
and for a whole seven years I was unable to throw him out.</p>
<p>To withhold his wages, for example, for as little as two or three
days, was impossible. He’d make such a to-do that I wouldn’t even know
where to hide. But in those days I was so embittered against everyone
that I resolved, who knows why or what for, to punish Apollon and not
give him his wages for another two weeks. I had long been intending to
do this, for two years or so - solely to prove to him that he dared not
get so puffed up over me, and that if I wished I could always not give
him his wages. I decided not to tell him about it and even to maintain a
deliberate silence, in order to vanquish his pride and make him be the
first to speak of his wages. Then I would take all seven roubles from
the drawer, to show him that I had them and had deliberately set them
aside, but that I “did not, did not, simply did not want to give him his
wages, did not want to because that’s how I wanted it, because such was
‘my will as the master,’ because he was irreverent, because he was a
boor; but that if he asked reverently, perhaps I would relent and</p>
<p>pay him; otherwise he’d have to wait another two weeks, wait three
weeks, wait a whole month…“</p>
<p>But, angry though I was, the victory still went to him. I didn’t even
hold out for four days. He began with what he always began with on such
occasions - for there had already been such occasions, or attempts (and,
I will note, I knew it all beforehand, I knew his mean tactics by heart)
- that is, he usually began by fixing me with an extremely stern look,
not taking it off me for several minutes at a time, following me with
his eyes especially when I came in or was leaving the house. If, for
example, I held out and pretended not to notice these looks, he would
proceed, silently as ever, to further tortures. Suddenly, for no reason
at all, he would come softly and smoothly into my room while I was
pacing about or reading, stop by the door, put one arm behind his back,
thrust out one hip, and fix me with his eyes, no longer so much stern as
altogether contemptuous. If I suddenly asked him what he wanted, he
would make no reply, and go on staring at me point-blank for several
seconds more; then, pressing his lips together in some special way, with
a significant air, he would turn slowly on his heel and suddenly go to
his room. About two hours later he would suddenly emerge again, and
again appear before me in the same way. Sometimes, in my fury, I would
no longer ask what he wanted, but simply raise my head abruptly and
imperiously, and also begin staring point-blank at him. And so we’d
stare at each other like that for about two minutes; finally, he would
turn, slowly and pompously, and go away for another two hours.</p>
<p>If I refused to be brought to reason by all this and continued my
rebellion, he would suddenly begin to sigh as he looked at me, sigh long
and deeply, as if measuring with each sigh the full depth of my moral
fall, and, of course, it would end at last with him overcoming me
completely: I’d get furious, I’d shout, but with that which had been the
whole point I’d be forced to comply.</p>
<p>This time, however, as soon as the usual “stern look“ maneuvers
began, I immediately lost my temper and fell on him in a fury. I was all
too irritated to begin with.</p>
<p>“Stop!“ I yelled in a frenzy, as he was turning, slowly and</p>
<p>silently, one arm behind his back, to go to his room. “Stop! Come
back! Come back, I tell you!“ And I must have bellowed so unnaturally
that he turned and began to study me even with a certain surprise.
However, he still did not say a word, and it was this that infuriated
me.</p>
<p>“How dare you come in here without permission and stare at me like
that! Answer!“</p>
<p>But he, having looked at me calmly for about half a minute, again
began to turn around.</p>
<p>“Stop!“ I roared, running up to him, “don’t move! So. Now answer:
what did you come in here and stare for?“</p>
<p>“If there’s something you want done direckly, it’s my duty to see to
it,“ he replied, again after some silence, lisping softly and
measuredly, raising his eyebrows, and calmly shifting his head from one
side to the other - and all that with horrifying composure.</p>
<p>“That’s not it, that’s not what I’m asking you, hangman!“ I shouted,
shaking with anger. “I’ll tell you myself, hangman, why you keep coming
here: you see I’m not giving you your wages, in your pride you don’t
want to bow and beg, and for that you come with your stupid staring to
punish me, to torture me, and you don’t even r-r-realize, hangman, how
stupid it is, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!“</p>
<p>He again began to turn silently, but I grabbed him.</p>
<p>“Listen,“ I was shouting at him. “Here’s the money, see, here it is!“
(I took it out of the drawer.) “All seven roubles, but you won’t get it,
you will not get it, until such time as you come respectfully, with a
guilty head, to ask my forgiveness. Do you hear!“</p>
<p>“That can never be!“ he replied, with a sort of unnatural
self-assurance.</p>
<p>“It will be!“ I was shouting. “I give you my word of honor, it will
be!“</p>
<p>“And there’s nothing for me to ask your forgiveness about,“ he went
on, as if not noticing my shouts at all, “seeing as you yourself have
abused me with ‘hangman,’ on which offense I can always apply against
you at the precinct.“</p>
<p>“Go! Apply!“ I roared. “Go now, this minute, this second! And you’re
still a hangman! hangman! hangman!“ But he just looked at me, then
turned and, no longer listening to my appeals, went smoothly to his
place without a backward glance.</p>
<p>“There wouldn’t be any of this if it weren’t for Liza!“ I decided to
myself. Then, after a moment’s pause, pompously and solemnly, but slowly
and with a pounding heart, I myself proceeded behind his screen.</p>
<p>“Apollon!“ I said softly and measuredly, though I was suffocating,
“go for the police chief at once, without the slightest delay!“</p>
<p>He had managed meanwhile to sit down at his table, put on his
spectacles, and begin some sewing. But hearing my order, he suddenly
snorted with laughter.</p>
<p>“Go now, this minute! Go, or you can’t even imagine what will
happen!“</p>
<p>“Truly, you’re not in your right senses,“ he observed, without even
raising his head, with the same slow lisp, and continuing to thread his
needle. “Who’s ever seen a man go to the authorities against himself?
And as to scaring me - you’re exerting yourself in vain, because -
nothing will happen.“</p>
<p>“Go!“ I shrieked, grabbing him by the shoulder. I felt I was about to
strike him.</p>
<p>And I did not even hear how the outer door opened at that moment,
softly and slowly, and some figure entered, stopped, and began gazing at
us in perplexity. I looked, died of shame, and rushed to my room. There,
clutching my hair with both hands, I leaned my head against the wall and
stood frozen in that position.</p>
<p>About two minutes later I heard the slow steps of Apollon.</p>
<p>“Some… one is asking for you out there,“ he said, looking at me with
particular sternness, then stepped aside and let in — Liza. He did not
want to leave, and stared at us mockingly.</p>
<p>“Get out! Get out!“ I ordered repeatedly, quite lost. At that moment
my clock strained, hissed, and struck seven.</p>
