<h4 id="notes">NOTES</h4>
<p>part one: underground</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Collegiate assessor was the eighth of the fourteen ranks in the
Imperial Russian civil service, equivalent to the military rank of
major. The narrator had attained this rank by the time he quit the
service, a year before writing his “notes“ (1864), not at the time of
the episodes he describes in Part Two (1848-50).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The language here is biblical, reminiscent of many passages in
the Psalms, the Book of Job, and the Gospels in which the righteous man
is confronted by skeptical critics. Isaiah 19:11 refers specifically to
the “wise counsellors“ of Pharaoh; “waggers of heads“ are mentioned in
Matthew 27:39 and Mark 15:29.</p></li>
<li><p>This combination of terms goes back to such eighteenth-century
treatises as A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the
Sublime and Beautiful (1757), by the Anglo-Irish writer and statesman
Edmund Burke (1729-97), and Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful
and the Sublime (1764), by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant
(1724-1804). The Russian phrase, replacing “sublime“ with the less
rhetorical “lofty,“ became a critical commonplace in the 1840s, but
acquired an ironic tone in the utilitarian and anti-aesthetic
1860s.</p></li>
<li><p>“The man of nature and truth“ (French), Dostoevsky’s mocking
distortion of a sentence from the prefatory note of Confessions by the
French philosopher and novelist Jean-Jacques</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Rousseau (1712-78): “Here is the only portrait of a man, painted
exactly from nature and in all its truth, that exists and probably ever
will exist.“</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Glancing references are made here to “Darwinism“ and to the theory
of “enlightened self-interest“ put forward by the English utilitarians
in the 1830s and -40s. Darwin avoided the question of human evolution
from other animals in his Origin</li>
</ol>
<p>of Species (1859); not so T. H. Huxley (1825-95), whose book Man’s
Place in Nature (1863) openly stated the case. A Russian translation of
this book was published early in 1864, just as Dostoevsky was writing
Notes from Underground.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>According to the General Address Book of Petersburg, there were
eight dentists named Wagenheim practicing in the city at the
time.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, the phrase was characteristic of articles published in
Time and Epoch, magazines edited by Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail
in 1861-65.</p></li>
<li><p>A “no-account“ or “rascal“ (French), from the German Schnapphahn,
a pilferer.</p></li>
<li><p>The Russian genre painter N. N. Ge (1831-94) exhibited a painting
entitled The Last Supper at the Academy of Art in 1863. Dostoevsky
detested the painting, and here takes advantage of the fact that the
artist’s name (pronounced almost like the English word “gay“) sounds the
same as the first letter - often used as a genteel euphemism - of the
Russian word govno, “shit.“ Hence the odd structure of the
sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>Dostoevsky’s ideological opponent M. E. Saltykov-Shchedrin
(1826-89) published an article with this title in the liberal monthly
The Contemporary (1863, no. 7). Dostoevsky pokes fun at him by taking
the title literally. Saltykov-Shchedrin had written an article praising
Ge’s Last Supper for the same journal (1863, no. 11).</p></li>
<li><p>The English historian Henry Thomas Buckle (1821-62), in his
History of Civilization in England (1807-61), formulated the i.e. that
the development of civilization leads to the cessation of war between
nations.</p></li>
<li><p>The wars of the “great“ Napoleon (1769-1821) are well known. His
nephew Napoleon III (1808-73; emperor 1852—70) started the Crimean War
against Russia (1854-56), took Cochin China for France (1859-62),
intervened in Mexico on the losing side of the emperor Maximilian, and
finally declared war on Prussia (1870), which led to his capitulation
and removal from power. At the time that Dostoevsky was writing Notes
from Underground, the North American union was enduring the
test</p></li>
</ol>
<p>of the Civil War, and Prussia was at war with Denmark over possession
of the province of Schleswig-Holstein, which had been under Danish
hegemony since 1773.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p>Attila (406?-53), “the Scourge of God,“ king of the Huns, led
devastating military campaigns against the Eastern Roman Empire, Persia,
and Gaul, before he was defeated near Chalons in 451 and driven back
across the Danube. Stepan Timofeevich (“Stenka“) Razin (?-1671), a Don
Cossack, led a peasant uprising in Russia (1667-71), which made him a
popular hero.</p></li>
<li><p>The metaphor of the piano key may go back to the French
materialist philosopher and writer Denis Diderot (1713-84), who wrote in
his Conversation Between D’Alembert and Diderot (1769): “We are
instruments endowed with sense and memory. Our senses are piano keys
upon which surrounding nature plays, and which often play upon
themselves.“</p></li>
<li><p>The “crystal palace“ is an allusion to “The Fourth Dream of Vera
Pavlovna“ from the novel What Is to Be Done? (1863), by N. G.
Chernyshevsky (1828-89), one of Dostoevsky’s main ideological enemies
and the target of much of the satire in Notes</p></li>
</ol>
<p>from Underground. Chernyshevsky’s thought combined the humanitarian
socialism of the 1840s with the utilitarianism of the 1860s. This
chapter of Notes attacks the theory of “rational egoism“ set forth in
Chernyshevsky’s The Anthropological Principle in Philosophy (1860); the
episodes of the “bumped officer“ and the “rescued prostitute“ in Part
Two of Notes are to some extent reversed parodies of episodes from What
Is to Be Done? Chernyshevsky’s “crystal palace,“ a vision of the ideal
living space for the future Utopian communist society, based on the
“phalanstery“ defined by the French Utopian socialist Charles Fourier
(1772-1837), drew its physical details from the cast-iron and glass
pavilion designed by Sir Joseph Paxton for the London Exposition of
1851.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>Dostoevsky first heard of the bird Kagan, a folkloric bringer of
happiness, during his imprisonment in Omsk (1849-53).</p></li>
<li><p>The Colossus of Rhodes, a 100-foot-high statue of Helios, the sun
god, made in 280 B.C., stood in the harbor of the Greek island of
Rhodes; it was one of the seven wonders of the ancient</p></li>
</ol>
<p>world. A. E. Anaevsky (1788-1866), a hackwriter, was the object of
much mockery in the press of the 1840S-60S.</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p>“To domestic animals“ (French).</p></li>
<li><p>The “fig“ (referred to in chapter VIII by the narrator’s supposed
listeners) is a rude gesture made by inserting the thumb between the
closed fingers of the fist. The “fig in the pocket“ is a covert form of
the same gesture, widely used in Russia, especially by intellectuals
during the Soviet period, as an expression of dissent.</p></li>
<li><p>See Psalm 137:5: “If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand
wither!“ (Revised Standard Version).</p></li>
<li><p>In his book On Germany, the German poet Heinrich Heine
(1797-1856) wrote: “The composition of one’s own character description
would be not only an awkward task but quite simply impossible … However
strong his wish to be sincere, no man is capable of telling the truth
about himself.“ In the same book, Heine insists that Rousseau, in his
Confessions, “makes false avowals, in order to hide his real doings
behind them.“</p></li>
<li><p>In his Dostoevsky: The Stir of Liberation, 1860-1865, Joseph
Frank, drawing attention to an 1849 article in which the Russian critic
P. V. Annenkov points to “wet snow“ as a common meteorological condition
in descriptions of Petersburg by writers of the natural school, suggests
that Dostoevsky uses the same “wet snow“ here to evoke both the
atmosphere of the period he is going to write about (the late 1840s) and
the naive assumptions of its literature, which he himself had
shared.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>part two: apropos of the wet snow</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Dostoevsky’s relations with N. A. Nekrasov (1821—78), poet,
liberal social critic, and editor of The Contemporary, were respectful
but often strained. The poem quoted here, written in 1845, tells the
story of a rescued prostitute.</p></li>
<li><p>Kostanzhoglo, an exemplary manager and landowner, appears in the
unfinished second part of Dead Souls by Nikolai Gogol (1809-52). Pyotr
Ivanovich Aduyev, from the novel</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An Ordinary Story (1847) by Ivan Goncharov (1812-91), is
distinguished by his common sense and practicality.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Weimar, in the German province of Thuringia, became an important
intellectual center in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries owing to the influence of its most famous citizen, the poet
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-183 2). The Schwarzwald, or Black
Forest, in southwestern Germany, is a “romantic“ region of hills and
woodlands separated from France by the Rhine valley.</p></li>
<li><p>Poprishchin, hero of Gogol’s Diary of a Madman (1835), is a petty
clerk who finally goes mad and imagines he is the king of
Spain.</p></li>
<li><p>Lieutenant Pirogov, one of the heroes of Gogol’s Nevsky Prospect
(1835), after being whipped by an irate German husband, wants to
complain against him to the authorities.</p></li>
<li><p>The expose (Dostoevsky ironically distorts the spelling here)
became a common journalistic phenomenon only in the 1860s; thus the
narrator was somewhat precocious in his wish to “expose“ his officer.
Fatherland Notes, a liberal monthly founded in Petersburg in 1818,
published during the sixty-six years of its existence some of the most
important writers of the age, including Lermontov, Nekrasov, Ostrovsky,
and Dostoevsky himself.</p></li>
<li><p>The French superfu, meaning “in excess,“ “unnecessary,“ or
“useless,“ is here taken to mean “ultra-refined.“ Nozdryov in Gogol’s
Dead Souls uses the word in the same sense.</p></li>
<li><p>A covered shopping area in the center of Petersburg, still in
existence and still so called.</p></li>
<li><p>That is, suggestive of the gloomy, proud, world-weary hero of the
verse drama Manfred (1817) by George Gordon, Lord Byron
(1788-1824).</p></li>
<li><p>In 1805, Napoleon defeated a joint Austrian-Russian army at
Austerlitz in Moravia. However, in Voyage to Icaria (1840), a Utopian
communist novel by the French publicist Etienne Cabet (1788-1856), a
philanthropic reformer also defeats a coalition of retrograde kings at
Austerlitz.</p></li>
<li><p>The narrator’s further imaginings also have Napoleonic touches:
Pope Pius VII excommunicated Napoleon in 1809,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>after which the emperor held him virtually captive until 1814; the
Villa Borghese, built by Scipione Borghese in 1615 as a summer house on
the outskirts of Rome, belonged in 1806 to Camillo Borghese, who married
Napoleon’s sister Paulina. Lake Como is normally situated in the Italian
Alps, near the Swiss border.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>An intersection in Petersburg, still so called, where four
streets come together to form five corners.</p></li>
<li><p>Before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, Russian estates
were evaluated in terms of the number of “souls“ (adult male serfs)
living on them.</p></li>
<li><p>“Right as a lord“ (French), referring to the right of the feudal
lord, when one of his serfs married, to spend the first night with the
bride.</p></li>
<li><p>Silvio, hero of “The Shot“ (1830), a short story by the poet
Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), devotes his life to the i.e. of revenge
and finally triumphs over his adversary. A similar role is played by the
character Incognito in Masquerade, a drama by Mikhail Lermontov
(1814-41).</p></li>
<li><p>In his enthusiasm, the narrator begins to speak in the words of
the biblical Creator: “Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness’“ (Genesis 1:26).</p></li>
<li><p>In the 1840s, the French novelist George Sand (1804-76) was
particularly admired in Russia for her social and humanitarian
concerns.</p></li>
<li><p>The last lines of the Nekrasov poem quoted as epigraph to Part
Two.</p></li>
<li><p>’Furnished rooms“ (French), which, while making a servant
unnecessary, would expose the narrator to the presence of other
lodgers.</p></li>
