<h4 id="section"></h4>
<p>XA quarter of an hour later I was running up and down my room in
furious impatience, going to the screen every other minute and peeking
at Liza through a crack. She was sitting on the floor, her head leaning
against the bed, and was probably crying. But she wouldn’t leave, and
that was what irritated me. This time she knew everything. I had given
her the final insult, but… no use talking about it. She guessed that</p>
<p>my burst of passion was precisely revenge, a new humiliation for her,
and that to my previous, almost pointless hatred there had now been
added a personal, envious hatred of her… I do not insist, by the way,
that she understood it all clearly; but on the other hand she fully
understood that I was a loathsome man and, above all, incapable of
loving her.</p>
<p>I know I shall be told that all this is inconceivable, that it is
inconceivable to be as wicked, as stupid, as I was; perhaps it will also
be added that it was inconceivable not to love her, or at least not to
appreciate her love. But why inconceivable? First, I was no longer able
to love, because, I repeat, for me to love meant to tyrannize and to
preponderize morally All my life I’ve been incapable even of picturing
any other love, and I’ve reached the point now of sometimes thinking
that love consists precisely in the right, voluntarily granted by the
beloved object, to be tyrannized over. In my underground dreams as well,
I never pictured love to myself otherwise than as a struggle; for me it
always started from hatred and ended with moral subjugation, and
afterwards I couldn’t even picture to myself what to do with the
subjugated object. And how is it inconceivable, if I had managed so to
corrupt myself morally, had grown so unaccustomed to “living life,“ that
I had dared just before to reproach and shame her for coming to me to
hear “pathetic words“; and I myself never guessed that she had come to
me not at all to hear pathetic words, but to love me, because for a
woman it is in love that all resurrection, all salvation from ruin of
whatever sort, and all regeneration consists, nor can it reveal itself
in anything else but this. However, I did not hate her all that much as
I was running about my room and peeking behind the screen through a
crack. I simply felt it unbearably burdensome that she was there. I
wanted her to disappear. I longed for “peace,“ I longed to be left alone
in the underground. “Living life“ so crushed me, unaccustomed to it as I
was, that it even became difficult for me to breathe.</p>
<p>But several more minutes passed and she still did not get up, as if
she were oblivious. I was shameless enough to tap softly on the screen
to remind her… She suddenly roused herself,</p>
<p>started up from her place, and rushed to look for her scarf, her hat,
her fur coat, as if to escape from me somewhere… Two minutes later she
came slowly from behind the screen and gave me a heavy look. I grinned
spitefully, though forcedly, for decency’s sake, and turned away from
her look.</p>
<p>“Good-bye,“ she said, making for the door.</p>
<p>I suddenly ran to her, seized her hand, opened it, put… and closed it
again. Then I turned at once and quickly sprang away to the opposite
corner, so as at least not to see…</p>
<p>I was going to lie right now - to write that I did it accidentally,
in distraction, at a loss, out of foolishness. But I don’t want to lie,
and so I’ll say directly that I opened her hand and put… in it out of
malice. The thought of doing it occurred to me while I was running up
and down my room and she was sitting behind the screen. But this much I
can say with certainty: although I did this cruelty on purpose, it came
not from my heart, but from my stupid head. This cruelty was so
affected, so much from the head, so purposely contrived, so bookish,
that I myself could not bear it even for a minute - first I sprang away
to the corner so as not to see, then in shame and despair I rushed after
Liza. I opened the door to the landing and began to listen.</p>
<p>“Liza! Liza!“ I called out to the stairway, but timidly, in a low
voice…</p>
<p>There was no answer; I thought I could hear her footsteps down
below.</p>
<p>“Liza!“ I called more loudly.</p>
<p>No answer. But at that moment I heard from below the tight glass
outer door to the street creak open heavily and slam tightly shut again.
The bang echoed up the stairway.</p>
<p>She was gone. I went back to my room, pondering. I felt terribly
heavy.</p>
<p>I stopped by the table next to the chair on which she had been
sitting, and stared senselessly before me. About a minute passed;
suddenly I gave a great start: there before me, on the table, I saw… in
short, I saw a crumpled blue five-rouble bill, the very one I had
pressed into her hand a moment before. It</p>
<p>was that bill; it couldn’t have been any other; there wasn’t any
other in the house. So she had managed to fling it from her hand onto
the table just as I jumped away to the opposite corner.</p>
<p>Well, then? I could have expected her to do that. Could have
expected? No. I was so great an egoist, I had in fact so little respect
for people, that I could scarcely imagine she, too, would do that. I
couldn’t bear it. A second later I rushed like a madman to get dressed,
threw on in a flurry whatever I could find, and raced headlong after
her. She couldn’t have gone more than two hundred steps before I ran out
to the street.</p>
<p>It was still, and the snow was falling heavily, almost
perpendicularly, laying a pillow over the sidewalk and the deserted
roadway. Not a single passer-by, not a sound to be heard. The
street-lamps flickered glumly and uselessly. I ran about two hundred
steps to the intersection and stopped.</p>
<p>“Where did she go? And why am I running after her? Why? To fall down
before her, to weep in repentance, to kiss her feet, to beg forgiveness!
I wanted it; my whole breast was tearing apart, and never, never will I
recall this moment with indifference. But - why?“ came the thought.
“Won’t I hate her, maybe tomorrow even, precisely for kissing her feet
today? Will I bring her happiness? Haven’t I learned again today, for
the hundredth time, just how much I’m worth? Won’t I torment her to
death!“</p>
<p>I stood in the snow, peering into the dull darkness, and thought
about that.</p>
<p>“And won’t it be better, yes, better,“ I fancied later, back at home,
stifling the living pain in my heart with fantasies, “won’t it be better
if she now carries an insult away with her forever? An insult - but this
is purification; it’s the most stinging and painful consciousness! By
tomorrow I’d have already dirtied her soul with myself and worn out her
heart. But now the insult will never die in her, and however vile the
dirt that awaits her - the insult will elevate and purify her… through
hatred… hm… maybe also forgiveness … Though, by the way, will all that
make it any easier for her?“ And in fact I’m now asking an idle question
of my own: which is better - cheap happiness, or lofty suffering? Well,
which is better?</p>
<p>Such were my reveries as I sat at home that evening, barely alive
from the pain in my soul. Never before had I endured so much suffering
and repentance; but could there have been even the slightest doubt, as I
went running out of the apartment, that I would turn back halfway? Never
have I met Liza again, or heard anything about her. I will also add that
for a long time I remained pleased with the. phrase about the usefulness
of insult and hatred, even though I myself almost became sick then from
anguish.</p>
<p>Even now, after so many years, all this comes out somehow none too
well in my recollection. Many things come out none too well now in my
recollections, but… shouldn’t I just end my Notes here? I think it was a
mistake to begin writing them. At least I’ve felt ashamed all the while
I’ve been writing this story: so it’s no longer literature, but
corrective punishment. Because, for example, to tell long stories of how
I defaulted on my life through moral corruption in a corner, through an
insufficiency of milieu, through unaccustom to what is alive, and
through vainglorious spite in the underground - is not interesting, by
God; a novel needs a hero, and here there are purposely collected all
the features for an antihero, and, in the first place, all this will
produce a most unpleasant impression, because we’ve all grown
unaccustomed to life, we’re all lame, each of us more or less. We’ve
even grown so unaccustomed that at times we feel a sort of loathing for
real “living life,“ and therefore cannot bear to be reminded of it. For
we’ve reached a point where we regard real “living life“ almost as
labor, almost as service, and we all agree in ourselves that it’s better
from a book. And why do we sometimes fuss about, why these caprices,
these demands of ours? We ourselves don’t know why. It would be the
worse for us if our capricious demands were fulfilled. Go on, try giving
us more independence, for example, unbind the hands of any one of us,
broaden our range of activity, relax the tutelage, and we… but I assure
you: we will immediately beg to be taken back under tutelage. I know
you’ll probably get angry with me for that, shout, stamp your feet:
“Speak just for yourself and your miseries in the underground, and don’t
go saying ‘we all.’“</p>
<p>Excuse me, gentlemen, but I am not justifying myself with this
allishness. As far as I myself am concerned, I have merely carried to an
extreme in my life what you have not dared to carry even halfway, and,
what’s more, you’ve taken your cowardice for good sense, and found
comfort in thus deceiving yourselves. So that I, perhaps, come out even
more “living“ than you. Take a closer look! We don’t even know where the
living lives now, or what it is, or what it’s called! Leave us to
ourselves, without a book, and we’ll immediately get confused, lost - we
won’t know what to join, what to hold to, what to love and what to hate,
what to respect and what to despise. It’s a burden for us even to be men
- men with real, our own bodies and blood; we’re ashamed of it, we
consider it a disgrace, and keep trying to be some unprecedented
omni-men. We’re stillborn, and have long ceased to be born of living
fathers, and we like this more and more. We’re acquiring a taste for it.
Soon we’ll contrive to be born somehow from an idea. But enough; I don’t
want to write any more “from Underground“…</p>
<p>However, the “notes“ of this paradoxalist do not end here. He could
not help himself and went on. But it also seems to us that this may be a
good place to stop.</p>
