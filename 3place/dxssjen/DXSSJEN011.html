<h4 id="iii">III</h4>
<p>I found two more of my schoolfellows with him. They were apparently
discussing an important matter. None of them paid more than the
slightest attention to my coming, which was even strange, because I
hadn’t seen them for years. Obviously they regarded me as something like
a quite ordinary fly. I had not been treated that way even at school,
though everyone there hated me. Of course, I understood that they must
scorn me now for the unsuccess of my career in the service and for my
having gone too much to seed, walking around badly dressed, and so on -
which in their eyes constituted a signboard of my incapacity and slight
significance. But all the same I did not expect such a degree of scorn.
Simonov was even surprised at my coming. Before, too, he had always
seemed surprised at</p>
<p>my coming. All this took me aback; I sat down in some anguish and
began to listen to what they were talking about.</p>
<p>The conversation, a serious and even heated one, was about a farewell
dinner which these gentlemen wanted to organize jointly on the very next
day for their schoolfellow Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was
leaving for a province far away. M’sieur Zverkov had also been my
schoolfellow all the while. I had begun especially to hate him starting
in the higher grades. In the lower grades he had been just a pretty,
frisky boy whom everybody liked. I, however, had hated him in the lower
grades as well, precisely for being a pretty and frisky boy. He was
always a bad student, and got worse as he went on. Nevertheless, he
graduated successfully, because he had his protectors. In his last year
at school he received an inheritance, two hundred souls,13 and since we
were almost all of us poor, he even began to swagger before us. He was a
vulgarian in the highest degree, but a nice fellow nonetheless, even
while swaggering. And despite the external, fantastic, and highfalutin
forms of honor and glory in our school, everyone, apart from a very few,
minced around Zverkov, the more so the more he swaggered. They minced
not for the sake of some sort of profit, but just so, because he was a
man favored with the gifts of nature. Besides, it was somehow an
accepted thing among us to regard Zverkov as an expert in the line of
adroitness and good manners. This last particularly infuriated me. I
hated the sharp, un-self-doubting tone of his voice, his admiration of
his own witticisms, which came out terribly stupid, though he did have a
bold tongue; I hated his handsome but silly face (for which, by the way,
I’d gladly have traded my intelligent one) and his free and easy
officer-of-the-forties airs. I hated the things he used to say about his
future successes with women (he hadn’t ventured to start up with women,
not having his officer’s epaulettes yet, and was looking forward to them
impatiently) and about how he’d be fighting duels all the time. I
remember myself, always taciturn, suddenly lighting into Zverkov when he
was talking with some friends about his future gallantries once during a
recess, got quite playful in the end, like a puppy</p>
<p>in the sun, and suddenly declared that he wouldn’t leave a single
village maiden on his estate without his attentions, that this was his
droit de seigneur,14 and if the peasants dared to protest, he’d give
them all a whipping and heap a double quitrent on the bearded canaille.
Our oafs applauded, but I lit into him, and not at all out of pity for
maidens or their fathers, but simply because such a little snot was
being so applauded. I got the best of him that time, but Zverkov, though
stupid, was gay and impudent, and therefore laughed it off, and even in
such a way that, in truth, I did not quite get the best of him: the
laughter remained on his side. Later he got the best of me several more
times, though not with spite, but just somehow jokingly, in passing,
with a laugh. I spitefully and contemptuously refused to reply. Upon
graduation he tried to make a step towards me, I did not resist too
much, because it flattered me, but we quickly and naturally parted ways.
Later I heard about his barracksy lieutenanty successes, about his
carousing. Later other rumors went around - that he was succeeding in
the service. Now he no longer greeted me in the street, and I suspected
he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a person as
insignificant as I was. I also saw him in the theater once, in the third
circle, now wearing aiguillettes. He was mincing and twining around the
daughters of some ancient general. In three short years he had gone very
much to seed, though he was still quite handsome and adroit; he had
become somehow puffy and was beginning to grow fat; one could see that
by the age of thirty he would be completely flabby. It was for this
finally departing Zverkov that our fellows wanted to give a dinner. They
had constantly associated with him all those three years, though
inwardly they did not consider themselves on an equal footing with him,
I’m sure of that.</p>
<p>Of Simonov’s two guests, one was Ferfichkin, from Russian-German
stock - short, monkey-faced, a fool who comically mimicked everyone, my
bitterest enemy even in the lower grades — a mean, impudent little
fanfaron who played at being most ticklishly ambitious, though of course
he was a coward at heart. He was one of those admirers of Zverkov who
flirted with</p>
<p>him for his own ends, and often borrowed money from him. Simonov’s
other guest, Trudolyubov, was an unremarkable person, a military type,
tall, with a cold physiognomy, honest enough, but worshiping any
success, and capable only of discussing promotions. He was some sort of
distant relation of Zverkov’s, and that, silly though it was, endowed
him with a certain significance among us. He had always regarded me as
nothing, but treated me, if not quite politely, at least passably.</p>
<p>“Well, so, if it’s seven roubles each,“ Trudolyubov said, “that makes
twenty-one for the three of us - we can have a nice dinner. Zverkov
doesn’t pay, of course.“</p>
<p>“Naturally not, since we’re inviting him,“ Simonov decided.</p>
<p>“Do you really think,“ Ferfichkin broke in presumptuously and
fervently, like an impudent lackey boasting of his master’s, the
general’s, decorations, “do you really think Zverkov will let us pay for
it all? He’ll accept out of delicacy, but he’ll stand us to a half-dozen
himself.“</p>
<p>“And what are the four of us going to do with a half-dozen,“
Trudolyubov remarked, having paid attention only to the half-dozen.</p>
<p>“So, it’s the three of us, four with Zverkov, twenty-one roubles, the
Hotel de Paris, tomorrow at five o’clock,“ Simonov, who had been elected
manager, finally concluded.</p>
<p>“Why twenty-one?“ I said, somewhat agitated, apparently even
offended. “If you count me, it’s twenty-eight roubles, not
twenty-one.“</p>
<p>It seemed to me that to offer myself suddenly and so unexpectedly
would even be a most handsome thing, and they would all be won over at
once and look upon me with respect.</p>
<p>“You want to come, too?“ Simonov remarked with displeasure, somehow
avoiding my eyes. He knew me by heart.</p>
<p>It infuriated me that he knew me by heart.</p>
<p>“What of it, sir? I would seem to be a schoolfellow, too, and I
confess I’m even offended at being left out,“ I began seething
again.</p>
<p>“And where does one go looking for you?“ Ferfichkin rudely butted
in.</p>
<p>“You were never on good terms with Zverkov,“ Trudolyubov added,
frowning. But once I had fastened on, I would not let go.</p>
<p>“It seems to me that no one has any right to judge about that,“ I
retorted, in a trembling voice, as if God knows what had happened.
“Maybe that’s precisely why I want to now, because we weren’t on good
terms before.“</p>
<p>“Well, who can understand you… and these sublimities …“ Trudolyubov
smirked.</p>
<p>“You’ll be put on the list,“ Simonov decided, turning to me.
“Tomorrow, five o’clock, the Hotel de Paris; make no mistake.“</p>
<p>“And the money!“ Ferfichkin tried to begin, in a half-whisper,
nodding towards me to Simonov, but he stopped short, because even
Simonov became embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Enough,“ said Trudolyubov, rising. “Let him come, if he wants to so
much.“</p>
<p>“But we have our own circle, we’re friends,“ Ferfichkin, angry, was
also reaching for his hat. “This isn’t an official meeting. Maybe we
don’t want you at all…“</p>
<p>They left; Ferfichkin did not even bow to me as he went out;
Trudolyubov barely nodded, without looking. Simonov, with whom I was
left face to face, was in some sort of annoyed perplexity and gave me a
strange glance. He did not sit down, nor did he invite me to sit
down.</p>
<p>“Hm… yes… tomorrow, then. And will you give me the money now? Just to
know for certain,“ he muttered in embarrassment.</p>
<p>I flushed, but as I flushed I recalled that I had owed Simonov
fifteen roubles from time immemorial, which, however, I had never
forgotten, though I also had never repaid it.</p>
<p>“You must see, Simonov, that I couldn’t have known on coming here…
and I’m very annoyed with myself for forgetting…“</p>
<p>“All right, all right, never mind. You can pay tomorrow at dinner. I
just wanted to know… Please don’t…“</p>
<p>He stopped short and began pacing the room with even greater
annoyance. As he paced, he started planting his heels and stomping still
more heavily.</p>
<p>“I’m not keeping you, am I?“ I asked, after a two-minute silence.</p>
<p>“Oh, no!“ he suddenly roused himself, “that is, to tell the truth -
yes. You see, I’ve also got to stop by at… Not far from here…“ he added,
in a sort of apologetic voice, and somewhat ashamedly.</p>
<p>“Ah, my God! Why didn’t you say so!“ I exclaimed, grabbing my cap,
but with an appearance of remarkable nonchalance, which flew down to me
from God knows where.</p>
<p>“It’s not far, really.. .Just a couple of steps…“ Simonov kept saying
as he saw me to the entryway with a bustling air that did not become him
at all. “Tomorrow, then, at five o’clock sharp!“ he called out as I went
down the stairs: he was so pleased I was leaving. I, however, was
furious.</p>
<p>“What possessed me, what possessed me to pop up like that!“ I gnashed
my teeth, striding along the street. “And for that scoundrel, that
little pig of a Zverkov! I mustn’t go, of course; just spit on it, of
course; I’m not bound, am I? Tomorrow I’ll send Simonov a note…“</p>
<p>But what made me furious was that I knew I would certainly go; I
would go on purpose; and the more tactless, the more improper it was for
me to go, the sooner I would go.</p>
<p>And there was even a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money.
All I had lying there was nine roubles. But of that, seven had to go the
next day for the wages of Apollon, my servant, who lived with me for
seven roubles a month, grub not included.</p>
<p>And not to pay him his wages was impossible, given Apollon’s
character. But of this dog, this thorn in my side, I will speak some
other time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I knew that even so I would not pay him, but would
certainly go.</p>
<p>That night I had the most hideous dreams. No wonder: all evening I
was oppressed by recollections of the penal servitude of my school
years, and I could not get rid of them. I had been tucked away in that
school by distant relations whose dependent I was and of whom I had no
notion thereafter - tucked away,</p>
<p>orphaned, already beaten down by their reproaches, already pensive,
taciturn, gazing wildly about at everything. My school fellows met me
with spiteful and merciless derision, because I was not like any of
them. But I could not endure derision; I could not get along so cheaply
as they got along with each other. I immediately began to hate them, and
shut myself away from everyone in timorous, wounded, and inordinate
pride. Their crudeness outraged me. They laughed cynically at my face,
my ungainly figure; and yet how stupid their own faces were! In our
school facial expressions degenerated and would become somehow
especially stupid. So many beautiful children came to us. A few years
later it was disgusting even to look at them. Already at the age of
sixteen I gloomily marveled at them; even then I was amazed at the
pettiness of their thinking, the stupidity of their pastimes, games,
conversations. They had so little understanding of the most essential
things, so little interest in the most impressive, startling subjects,
that I began, willy-nilly, to regard them as beneath me. It was not
injured vanity that prompted me to do so, and for God’s sake don’t come
creeping at me with those banal objections that one is sick of to the
point of nausea - “that I was only dreaming, while they already
understood real life.“ They understood nothing, no real life, and I
swear it was this in them that outraged me most of all. On the contrary,
they took the most obvious, glaring reality in a fantastically stupid
way, and were already accustomed to worshiping success alone. Everything
that was just, but humiliated and downtrodden, they laughed at
disgracefully and hardheartedly. They regarded rank as intelligence; at
the age of sixteen they were already talking about cushy billets. Of
course, much of this came from stupidity, from the bad examples that had
ceaselessly surrounded their childhood and adolescence. They were
depraved to the point of monstrosity. To be sure, here, too, there was
more of the external, more of an assumed cynicism; to be sure,
youthfulness and a certain freshness could be glimpsed in them even
through the depravity; but even this freshness was unattractive in them
and showed itself as a sort of knavery. I hated them terribly, though I
was perhaps worse</p>
<p>han they were. They paid me back in kind and did not conceal their
loathing for me. But I no longer had any wish for their love; on the
contrary, I constantly thirsted for their humiliation. To rid myself of
their derision, I purposely began to study as hard as I could and worked
my way into the number of the best. This made an impression. Besides,
they began little by little to realize that I had by then read such
books as they were unable to read, and understood such things (not part
of our special course) as they had never even heard of. This they
regarded wildly and derisively, but morally they submitted, the more so
as even the teachers paid attention to me in this respect. The derision
stopped, but the animosity remained, and cold, strained relations set
in. Towards the end I myself could not stand it: as I grew older, a need
for people, for friends, developed. I tried to start getting closer with
some; but the attempt always came out unnaturally and would simply end
of itself. I also once had a friend. But I was already a despot in my
soul; I wanted to have unlimited power over his soul; I wanted to
instill in him a contempt for his surrounding milieu; I demanded of him
a haughty and final break with that milieu. I frightened him with my
passionate friendship; I drove him to tears, to convulsions; he was a
naive, self-giving soul; but once he had given himself wholly to me, I
immediately started to hate him and pushed him away - as if I had needed
him only to gain a victory over him, only to bring him into subjection.
But I could not be victorious over everyone; my friend was also not like
any of them, and represented the rarest exception. The first thing I did
upon leaving school was quit the special service for which I had been
intended, in order to break all ties, to curse the past and bury it in
the dust… And the devil knows why, after that, I dragged myself to this
Simonov!…</p>
<p>In the morning I roused myself early, I jumped out of bed in
agitation, as if all this was going to start happening right away. But
then I did believe that some radical break in my life was coming and
could not fail to come that very day. It may have been lack of habit or
something, but all my life, when faced with any external event, be it
ever so small, I always thought</p>
<p>hat right then some radical break in my life was going to come.
Nevertheless, I went to work as usual, but slipped away two hours early
to go home and get ready. The main thing, I thought, is that I mustn’t
be the first to arrive, or they’ll think I’m all too delighted. But
there were thousands of such main things, and they all agitated me to
the point of impotence. I polished my boots a second time with my own
hands; for the life of him Apollon would not have polished them twice in
one day, finding it inordinate. I polished them, therefore, having
stolen the brushes from the entryway so that he would not somehow notice
and afterwards begin to despise me. Then I carefully inspected my
clothes and found that everything was old, shabby, worn out. I had
indeed become too slovenly. My uniform was perhaps in good condition,
but I really couldn’t go to dinner in my uniform. And the main thing was
that on my trousers, right on the knee, there was a huge yellow spot. I
could sense already that this spot alone would rob me of nine-tenths of
my dignity. I also knew that it was very mean to think so. “But I can’t
be bothered with thinking now; now comes reality,“ I thought, and my
heart sank. I also knew perfectly well, even then, that I was
monstrously exaggerating all these facts; but there was nothing to be
done: I could no longer control myself, I was shaking with fever. In
despair I pictured how coldly and condescendingly that “scoundrel“
Zverkov would meet me; with what dull, all-invincible contempt the
dullard Trudolyubov would look at me; how nastily and impudently that
little snot Ferfichkin would titter at my expense, sucking up to
Zverkov; how perfectly Simonov would understand it all in himself, and
how he would despise me for the meanness of my vanity and
faintheartedness; and, the main thing - how measly, non-literary,
commonplace it was all going to be. Of course, it would be best not to
go at all. But that was more impossible than anything else: once I began
to be drawn, I used to be drawn in all the way, over my head. Afterwards
I’d have been taunting myself for the rest of my life: “So you turned
coward, turned coward before reality, that’s what you did, you turned
coward!“ On the contrary, I passionately wanted to prove to all that</p>
<p>“riffraff“ that I was by no means the coward I made myself out to be.
More than that: in the strongest paroxysm of cowardly fever, I dreamed
of getting the best of them, winning them over, carrying them away,
making them love me - if only for my “lofty mind and indubitable wit.“
They would drop Zverkov, he would sit on the sidelines, silent and
ashamed, and I would crush him. Afterwards I would perhaps make peace
with him, and we would pledge eternal friendship, yet the most bitter
and offensive thing for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and
certainly, that in fact I needed none of that, and in fact I had no wish
to crush, subject, or attract them, and would be the first not to give a
penny for the whole outcome, even if I achieved it. Oh, how I prayed to
God for that day to pass more quickly! In inexpressible anguish I kept
going to the window, opening the vent, and peering into the dull
darkness of thickly falling wet snow…</p>
<p>At last my wretched little wall clock hissed five. I grabbed my hat
and, trying not to glance at Apollon - who since morning had been
waiting to receive his wages from me, but in his pride refused to speak
first - slipped past him out the door, and in a coach hired for the
purpose with my last fifty kopecks, drove up like a grand gentleman to
the Hotel de Paris.</p>
