<h4 id="i">I</h4>
<p>I am a sick man…I am a wicked man. An unattractive man. I think my
liver hurts. However, I don’t know a fig about my sickness, and am not
sure what it is that hurts me. I am not being treated and never have
been, though I respect medicine and doctors. What’s more, I am also
superstitious in the extreme; well, at least enough to respect medicine.
(I’m sufficiently educated not to be superstitious, but I am.) No, sir,
I refuse to be treated out of wickedness. Now, you will certainly not be
so good as to understand this. Well, sir, but I understand it. I will
not, of course, be able to explain to you precisely who is going to
suffer in this case from my wickedness; I know perfectly well that I
will in no way “muck things up“ for the doctors by not taking their
treatment; I know better than anyone that by all this I am harming only
myself and no one else. But still, if I don’t get treated, it is out of
wickedness. My liver hurts; well, then let it hurt even worse!</p>

<p>I’ve been living like this for a long time - about twenty years. I’m
forty now. I used to be in the civil service; I no longer am. I was a
wicked official. I was rude, and took pleasure in it. After all, I
didn’t accept bribes, so I had to reward myself</p>
<p>Both the author of the notes and the Notes themselves are, of course,
fictional. Nevertheless, such persons as the writer of such notes not
only may but even must exist in our society, taking into consideration
the circumstances under which our society has generally been formed. I
wished to bring before the face of the public, a bit more conspicuously
than usual, one of the characters of a time recently passed. He is one
representative of a generation that is still living out its life. In
this fragment, entitled “Underground,“ this person introduces himself,
his outlook, and seeks, as it were, to elucidate the reasons why he
appeared and had to appear among us. In the subsequent fragment will
come this person’s actual “notes“ about certain events in his life.</p>
<p>—Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
<p>at least with that. (A bad witticism, but I won’t cross it out. I
wrote it thinking it would come out very witty; but now, seeing for
myself that I simply had a vile wish to swagger -I purposely won’t cross
it out!) When petitioners would come for information to the desk where I
sat - I’d gnash my teeth at them, and felt an inexhaustible delight when
I managed to upset someone. I almost always managed. They were timid
people for the most part: petitioners, you know. But among the fops
there was one officer I especially could not stand. He simply refused to
submit and kept rattling his sabre disgustingly. I was at war with him
over that sabre for a year and a half. In the end, I prevailed. He
stopped rattling. However, that was still in my youth. But do you know,
gentlemen, what was the main point about my wickedness? The whole thing
precisely was, the greatest nastiness precisely lay in my being
shamefully conscious every moment, even in moments of the greatest bile,
that I was not only not a wicked but was not even an embittered man,
that I was simply frightening sparrows in vain, and pleasing myself with
it. I’m foaming at the mouth, but bring me some little doll, give me
some tea with a bit of sugar, and maybe I’ll calm down. I’ll even wax
tenderhearted, though afterwards I’ll certainly gnash my teeth at myself
and suffer from insomnia for a few months out of shame. Such is my
custom.</p>
<p>And I lied about myself just now when I said I was a wicked official.
I lied out of wickedness. I was simply playing around both with the
petitioners and with the officer, but as a matter of fact I was never
able to become wicked. I was conscious every moment of so very many
elements in myself most opposite to that. I felt them simply swarming in
me, those opposite elements. I knew they had been swarming in me all my
life, asking to be let go out of me, but I would not let them, I would
not, I purposely would not let them out. They tormented me to the point
of shame; they drove me to convulsions, and - finally I got sick of
them, oh, how sick I got! But do you not perhaps think, gentlemen, that
I am now repenting of something before you, that I am asking your
forgiveness for something?… I’m</p>
<p>sure you think so … However, I assure you that it is all the same to
me even if you do …</p>
<p>Not just wicked, no, I never even managed to become anything: neither
wicked nor good, neither a scoundrel nor an honest man, neither a hero
nor an insect. And now I am living out my life in my corner, taunting
myself with the spiteful and utterly futile consolation that it is even
impossible for an intelligent man seriously to become anything, and only
fools become something. Yes, sir, an intelligent man of the nineteenth
century must be and is morally obliged to be primarily a characterless
being; and a man of character, an active figure - primarily a limited
being. This is my forty-year-old conviction. I am now forty years old,
and, after all, forty years - is a whole lifetime; after all, it’s the
most extreme old age. To live beyond forty is indecent, banal, immoral!
Who lives beyond forty - answer me sincerely, honestly? I’ll tell you
who does: fools and scoundrels do. I’ll say it in the faces of all the
elders, all these venerable elders, all these silver-haired and
sweet-smelling elders! I’ll say it in the whole world’s face! I have the
right to speak this way, because I myself will live to be sixty. I’ll
live to be seventy! I’ll live to be eighty!… Wait! let me catch my
breath…</p>
<p>You no doubt think, gentlemen, that I want to make you laugh? Here,
too, you’re mistaken. I am not at all such a jolly man as you think, or
as you possibly think; if, however, irritated by all this chatter (and I
already feel you are irritated), you decide to ask me: what precisely am
I? - then I will answer you: I am one collegiate assessor.1 I served so
as to have something to eat (but solely for that), and when last year
one of my distant relations left me six thousand roubles in his will, I
resigned at once and settled into my corner. I lived in this corner
before as well, but now I’ve settled into it. My room is wretched, bad,
on the e.g. of the city. My servant is a village woman, old, wicked from
stupidity, and always bad-smelling besides. I’m told that the Petersburg
climate is beginning to do me harm, and that with my negligible means
life in Petersburg is very expensive. I know all that, I know it better
than all these experienced and most wise counsellors and waggers of
heads.2 But I am staying in</p>
<p>Petersburg; I will not leave Petersburg! I will not leave because…
Eh! but it’s all completely the same whether I leave or not.</p>
<p>But anyhow: what can a decent man speak about with the most
pleasure?</p>
<p>Answer: about himself.</p>
<p>So then I, too, will speak about myself.</p>
