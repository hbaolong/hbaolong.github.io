<h4 id="i">I</h4>
<p>XGentlemen, I am joking, of course, and I myself know that I am not
joking very successfully, but one really cannot take everything as a
joke. Maybe I’m grinding my teeth as I joke.. Gentlemen, I am tormented
by questions; resolve them for me. You, for example, want to make man
unlearn his old habits, and to correct his will in conformity with the
demands of science</p>
<p>and common sense. But how do you know that man not only can be but
must be remade in this way? What makes you conclude that man’s wanting
so necessarily needs to be corrected? In short, how do you know that
such a correction will indeed be profitable for man? And, if we’re to
say everything, why are you so certainly convinced that not to go
against real, normal profits, guaranteed by the arguments of reason and
arithmetic, is indeed always profitable for man and is a law for the
whole of mankind? So far, it’s still just your supposition. Suppose it
is a law of logic, but perhaps not of mankind at all. Perhaps you think,
gentlemen, that I am mad? Allow me an observation. I agree: man is
predominantly a creating animal, doomed to strive consciously towards a
goal and to occupy himself with the art of engineering - that is, to
eternally and ceaselessly make a road for himself that at least goes
somewhere or other. But sometimes he may wish to swerve aside, precisely
because he is doomed to open this road, and also perhaps because, stupid
though the ingenuous figure generally is, it still sometimes occurs to
him that this road almost always turns out to go somewhere or other, and
the main thing is not where it goes, but that it should simply be going,
and that the well-behaved child, by neglecting the art of engineering,
not give himself up to pernicious idleness, which, as is known, is the
mother of all vice. Man loves creating and the making of roads, that is
indisputable. But why does he so passionately love destruction and chaos
as well? Tell me that! But of this I wish specially to say a couple of
words myself. Can it be that he has such a love of destruction and chaos
(it’s indisputable that he sometimes loves them very much; that is a
fact) because he is instinctively afraid of achieving the goal and
completing the edifice he is creating? How do you know, maybe he likes
the edifice only from far off, and by no means up close; maybe he only
likes creating it, and not living in it, leaving it afterwards aux
animaux domestiques,18 such as ants, sheep, and so on and so forth. Now,
ants have totally different tastes. They have a remarkable edifice of
the same sort, forever indestructible - the anthill.</p>
<p>With the anthill the most reverend ants began, and with the</p>
<p>anthill they will doubtless end as well, which does great credit to
their constancy and positiveness. But man is a frivolous and unseemly
being, and perhaps, similar to a chess player, likes only the process of
achieving the goal, but not the goal itself. And who knows (one cannot
vouch for it), perhaps the whole goal mankind strives for on earth
consists just in this ceaselessness of the process of achievement alone,
that is to say, in life itself, and not essentially in the goal, which,
of course, is bound to be nothing other than two times two is four -
that is, a formula; and two times two is four is no longer life,
gentlemen, but the beginning of death. At least man has always somehow
feared this two times two is four, and I fear it even now. Suppose all
man ever does is search for this two times two is four; he crosses
oceans, he sacrifices his life in the search; but to search it out,
actually to find it - by God, he’s somehow afraid. For he senses that
once he finds it, there will be nothing to search for. Workers, when
they’re done working, at least get their pay, go to a pothouse, then
wind up with the police - so it keeps them busy for a week. But where is
man to go? Something awkward, at any rate, can be noticed in him each
time he achieves some such goal. Achieving he likes, but having achieved
he does not quite like, and that, of course, is terribly funny. In
short, man is comically arranged; there is apparently a joke in all
this. But still, two times two is four is a most obnoxious thing. Two
times two is four - why, in my opinion, it’s sheer impudence, sirs. Two
times two is four has a cocky look; it stands across your path, arms
akimbo, and spits. I agree that two times two is four is an excellent
thing; but if we’re going to start praising everything, then two times
two is five is sometimes also a most charming little thing.</p>
<p>And why are you so firmly, so solemnly convinced that only the normal
and the positive, in short, that only well-being, is profitable for man?
Is reason not perhaps mistaken as to profits? Maybe man does not love
well-being only? Maybe he loves suffering just as much? Maybe suffering
is just as profitable for him as well-being? For man sometimes loves
suffering terribly much, to the point of passion, and that is a fact.
Here there’s</p>
<p>not even any need to consult world history; just ask yourself, if
you’re a human being and have had any life at all. As for my personal
opinion, to love just well-being alone is even somehow indecent. Whether
it’s good or bad, it’s sometimes also very pleasant to break something.
I, as a matter of fact, take my stand here neither with suffering nor
with well-being. I stand… for my own caprice, and that it be guaranteed
me when necessary. Suffering, for example, is inadmissible in
vaudevilles, I know that. In a crystal palace it is even unthinkable:
suffering is doubt, it is negation, and what good is a crystal palace in
which one can have doubts? And yet I’m certain that man will never
renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Suffering -
why, this is the sole cause of consciousness. Though I did declare at
the beginning that consciousness, in my opinion, is man’s greatest
misfortune, still I know that man loves it and will not exchange it for
any satisfactions. Consciousness, for example, is infinitely higher than
two times two. After two times two there would, of course, be nothing
left - not only to do, but even to learn. The only possible thing to do
then would be to stop up our five senses and immerse ourselves in
contemplation. Well, but with consciousness, though the result comes out
the same - that is, again there’s nothing to do - at least one can
occasionally whip oneself, and, after all, that livens things up a bit.
It may be retrograde, but still it’s better than nothing.</p>
<p>XYou believe in a crystal edifice, forever indestructible; that is,
in an edifice at which one can neither put out one’s tongue on the sly
nor make a fig in the pocket.19 Well, and perhaps I’m afraid of this
edifice precisely because it is crystal and forever indestructible, and
it will be impossible to put out one’s tongue at it even on the sly.</p>
<p>Now look: if instead of a palace there is a chicken coop, and it
starts to rain, I will perhaps get into the chicken coop to avoid a
wetting, but all the same I will not take the chicken</p>
<p>coop for a palace out of gratitude for its having kept me from the
rain. You laugh, you even say that in that case it makes no difference -
chicken coop or mansion. Yes, say I, if one were to live only so as not
to get wet.</p>
<p>But what’s to be done if I’ve taken it into my head that one does not
live only for that, and that if one is to live, it had better be in a
mansion? This is my wanting, this is my desire. You will scrape it out
of me only when you change my desires. So, change them, seduce me with
something else, give me a different ideal. But meanwhile I will not take
a chicken coop for a palace. Let it even be so that the crystal edifice
is a bluff, that by the laws of nature it should not even be, and that
I’ve invented it only as a result of my own stupidity, as a result of
certain old nonrational habits of our generation. But what do I care if
it should not be? What difference does it make, since it exists in my
desires, or, better, exists as long as my desires exist? Perhaps you’re
laughing again? Laugh, if you please; I will accept all mockery, but
still I won’t say I’m full when I’m hungry; still I know that I will not
rest with a compromise, with a ceaseless, recurring zero, simply because
according to the laws of nature it exists, and exists really. I will not
take a tenement house, with apartments for the poor, and a thousand-year
lease, and the dentist Wagenheim’s shingle for good measure, as the
crown of my desires. Destroy my desires, wipe out my ideals, show me
something better, and I will follow you. Perhaps you’ll say it’s not
worth getting involved; but in that case I can answer you the same way.
Our discussion is serious; if you do not deign to give me your
attention, I am not going to bow and scrape before you. I have the
underground.</p>
<p>But so long as I live and desire - let my hand wither20 if I bring
even one little brick for such a tenement house! Never mind that I
myself have just rejected the crystal edifice, for the sole reason that
one cannot taunt it with one’s tongue. I said that not because I have
such a love of putting out my tongue. Perhaps I was angry simply because
such an edifice, at which it is possible not to put out one’s tongue,
has never yet been found among all your edifices. On the contrary, I
would let my tongue</p>
<p>be cut off altogether, from sheer gratitude, if only it could be so
arranged that I myself never felt like sticking it out again. What do I
care that it’s impossible to arrange it so, and one must content oneself
with apartments? Why, then, have I been arranged with such desires? Can
it be that I’ve been arranged simply so as to come to the conclusion
that my entire arrangement is a hoax? Can that be the whole purpose? I
don’t believe it. You know what, though: I’m convinced that our sort,
the underground ones, ought to be kept on a tether. Though we’re capable
of sitting silently in the underground for forty years, once we do come
out and let loose, we talk, talk, talk…</p>
<p>XI</p>
<p>The final end, gentlemen: better to do nothing! Better conscious
inertia! And so, long live the underground! Though I did say that I envy
the normal man to the point of uttermost bile, still I do not want to be
him on those conditions in which I see him (though, all the same, I
shall not stop envying him. No, no, the underground is in any case more
profitable!). There one can at least… Eh! but here, too, I’m lying!
Lying, because I myself know, like two times two, that it is not at all
the underground that is better, but something different, completely
different, which I thirst for but cannot ever find! Devil take the
underground!</p>
<p>Even this would be better here: if I myself believed at least
something of all I’ve just written. For I swear to you, gentlemen, that
I do not believe a word, not one little word, of all I’ve just
scribbled! That is, I do believe, perhaps, but at the same time, who
knows why, I sense and suspect that I’m lying like a cobbler.</p>
<p>“Then why did you write it all?“ you say to me.</p>
<p>And what if I put you away for some forty years with nothing to do,
and then come to you in the underground after forty years to see how
you’ve turned out? One cannot leave a man alone and unoccupied for forty
years, can one?</p>
<p>“But is this not shameful, is it not humiliating!“ you will</p>
<p>perhaps say to me, contemptuously shaking your heads. “You thirst for
life, yet you yourself resolve life’s questions with a logical tangle.
And how importunate, how impudent your escapades, yet at the same time
how frightened you are! You talk nonsense, and are pleased with it; you
say impudent things, yet you keep being afraid and asking forgiveness
for them. You insist that you are not afraid of anything, and at the
same time you court our opinion. You insist that you are gnashing your
teeth, and at the same time you exert your wit to make us laugh. You
know that your witticisms are not witty, but you are apparently quite
pleased with their literary merits. You may indeed have happened to
suffer, but you do not have the least respect for your suffering. There
is truth in you, too, but no integrity; out of the pettiest vanity you
take your truth and display it, disgrace it, in the marketplace… You do
indeed want to say something, but you conceal your final word out of
fear, because you lack the resolve to speak it out, you have only
cowardly insolence. You boast about consciousness, yet all you do is
vacillate, because, though your mind works, your heart is darkened by
depravity, and without a pure heart there can be no full, right
consciousness. And how importunate you are, how you foist yourself, how
you mug! Lies, lies, lies!“</p>
<p>To be sure, I myself have just made up all these words of yours.
This, too, is from underground. I’ve spent forty years on end there
listening to these words of yours through a crack. I thought them up
myself, since this was all that would get thought up. No wonder they got
learned by heart and assumed a literary form …</p>
<p>But can it be, can it be that you are indeed so gullible as to
imagine I will publish all this and, what’s more, give it to you to
read? And here’s another puzzle for me: why indeed do I call you
“gentlemen,“ why do I address you as if you were actually my readers?
Such confessions as I intend to begin setting forth here are not
published and given to others to read. At least I do not have so much
firmness in myself, and do not consider it necessary to have it. But you
see: a certain fancy has come into my head, and I want at all costs to
realize it. Here’s what it is.</p>
<p>In every man’s memories there are such things as he will reveal not
to everyone, but perhaps only to friends. There are also such as he will
reveal not even to friends, but only to himself, and that in secret.
Then, finally, there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even to
himself, and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things
of this sort. That is, one might even say: the more decent a man is, the
more of them he will have. At least I myself have only recently resolved
to recall some of my former adventures, which till now I have always
avoided, even with a certain uneasiness. Now, however, when I not only
recall them but am even resolved to write them down, now I want
precisely to make a test: is it possible to be perfectly candid with
oneself and not be afraid of the whole truth? I will observe
incidentally: Heine insists that faithful autobiographies are almost
impossible, and that a man is sure to tell a pack of lies about himself.
In his opinion, Rousseau, for example, most certainly told a pack of
lies about himself in his confessions, and even did so intentionally,
out of vanity.21 I’m sure Heine is right; I understand very well how one
can sometimes slap whole crimes on oneself solely out of vanity, and I
even perceive quite well what sort of vanity it might be. But Heine’s
opinion concerned a man who was confessing before the public. I,
however, am writing only for myself, and I declare once and for all that
even if I write as if I were addressing readers, that is merely a front,
because it’s easier for me to write that way. It’s a form, just an empty
form, and I shall never have any readers. I have already declared as
much…</p>
<p>I do not want to hamper myself with anything in preparing my notes. I
will not introduce any order or system. Whatever I recall, I will write
down.</p>
<p>Now, for example, someone might seize upon a word and ask me: if you
really are not counting on any readers, why then do you make such
agreements with yourself, and on paper besides, that you will introduce
no order or system, that you will write down whatever you recall, etc.,
etc.? Why these explanations? Why these apologies?</p>
<p>“Well, so it goes,“ I reply.</p>
<p>There is, however, a whole psychology here. Maybe it’s also that I’m
simply a coward. And maybe also that I’m purposely imagining a public
before me so as to behave more decently while I write. There may be a
thousand reasons.</p>
<p>But here is another thing: for what and to what end, in fact, do I
want to write? If not for the public, then why not simply recall
everything mentally, without transferring it to paper?</p>
<p>Right, sir; but on paper it will somehow come out more solemnly.
There’s something imposing in it, there will be more of a judgment on
oneself, it will gain in style. Besides: maybe I will indeed get relief
from the writing. Today, for example, I’m particularly oppressed by one
distant recollection. I recalled it clearly the other day, and it has
since stayed with me like a nagging musical tune that refuses to be
gotten rid of. And yet one must get rid of it. I have hundreds of such
recollections; but some one out of a hundred emerges every now and then
and oppresses me. I believe for some reason that if I write it down, I
shall then be rid of it. So why not try?</p>
<p>Finally: I’m bored, and I constantly do nothing. And writing things
down really seems like work. They say work makes a man good and honest.
Well, here’s a chance, at least.</p>
<p>Snow is falling today, almost wet, yellow, dull. And it was falling
yesterday, and it was falling the other day as well. I think it was
apropos of the wet snow that I recalled this anecdote that now refuses
to be gotten rid of. And so, let this be a story apropos of the wet
snow.22</p>
<p>PART TWO</p>
<p>APROPOS OF THE WET SNOW</p>
<p>When from out of error’s darkness With a word both sure and ardent I
had drawn the fallen soul, And you, filled with deepest torment, Cursed
the vice that had ensnared you And so doing wrung your hands; When,
punishing with recollection Forgetful conscience, you then told The tale
of all that went before me, And suddenly you hid your face In trembling
hands and, filled with horror, Filled with shame, dissolved in tears,
Indignant as you were, and shaken… Etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>From the poetry ofN. A. Nekrasov1</p>
