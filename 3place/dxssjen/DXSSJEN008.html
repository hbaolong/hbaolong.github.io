<h4 id="vii">VII</h4>
<p>But these are all golden dreams. Oh, tell me, who first announced,
who was the first to proclaim that man does dirty only because he
doesn’t know his real interests; and that were he to be enlightened,
were his eyes to be opened to his real, normal interests, man would
immediately stop doing dirty, would immediately become good and noble,
because, being enlightened and understanding his real profit, he would
see his real profit precisely in the good, and it’s common knowledge
that no man can act knowingly against his own profit, consequently, out
of necessity, so to speak, he would start doing good? Oh, the babe! oh,
the pure, innocent child! and when was it, to begin with, in all these
thousands of years, that man acted solely for his own profit? What is to
be done with the millions of facts testifying to how people knowingly,
that is, fully understanding their real profit, would put it in second
place and throw themselves onto another path, a risk, a perchance, not
compelled by anyone or anything, but precisely as if they simply did not
want the designated path, and stubbornly, willfully</p>
<p>pushed off onto another one, difficult, absurd, searching for it all
but in the dark. So, then, this stubbornness and willfulness were really
more agreeable to them than any profit… Profit! What is profit? And will
you take it upon yourself to define with perfect exactitude precisely
what man’s profit consists in? And what if it so happens that on
occasion man’s profit not only may but precisely must consist in
sometimes wishing what is bad for himself, and not what is profitable?
And if so, if there can be such a case, then the whole rule goes up in
smoke. What do you think, can such a case occur? You’re laughing; laugh
then, gentlemen, only answer me: has man’s profit been calculated quite
correctly? Isn’t there something that not only has not been but even
cannot be fitted into any classification? Because, gentlemen, as far as
I know, you have taken your whole inventory of human profits from an
average of statistical figures and scientifico-economic formulas.
Because profit for you is prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace, and so on
and so forth; so that a man who, for example, openly and knowingly went
against this whole inventory would, in your opinion - well, and also in
mine, of course - be an obscurantist or a complete madman, right? But
here is the surprising thing: how does it happen that all these
statisticians, sages, and lovers of mankind, in calculating human
profits, constantly omit one profit? They don’t even take it into
account in the way it ought to be taken, and yet the whole account
depends on that. It’s no great trouble just to take it, this profit, and
include it in the list. But that’s the whole bane of it, that this
tricky profit doesn’t fall into any classification, doesn’t fit into any
list. I, for instance, have a friend… Eh, gentlemen! but he’s your
friend as well; and whose friend is he not! Preparing to do something,
this gentleman will at once expound to you, with great eloquence and
clarity, precisely how he must needs act in accordance with the laws of
reason and truth. Moreover: with passion and excitement he will talk to
you of real, normal human interests; with mockery he will reproach those
shortsighted fools who understand neither their own profit nor the true
meaning of virtue; and then, exactly a quarter of an hour later, without
any sudden, extraneous cause,</p>
<p>but precisely because of something within him that is stronger than
all his interests, he’ll cut quite a different caper, that is, go
obviously against what he himself was just saying: against the laws of
reason, against his own profit; well, in short, against everything… I
warn you that my friend is a collective person, and therefore it is
somehow difficult to blame him alone. That’s just the thing, gentlemen,
that there may well exist something that is dearer for almost every man
than his very best profit, or (so as not to violate logic) that there is
this one most profitable profit (precisely the omitted one, the one we
were just talking about), which is chiefer and more profitable than all
other profits, and for which a man is ready, if need be, to go against
all laws, that is, against reason, honor, peace, prosperity - in short,
against all these beautiful and useful things - only so as to attain
this primary, most profitable profit which is dearer to him than
anything else.</p>
<p>“Well, but it is a profit, after all,“ you will interrupt me. I beg
your pardon, sirs, but we shall speak further of it, and the point is
not in a play on words, but in the fact that this profit is remarkable
precisely because it destroys all our classifications and constantly
shatters all the systems elaborated by lovers of mankind for the
happiness of mankind. Interferes with everything, in short. But before
naming this profit for you, I want to compromise myself personally, and
therefore I boldly declare that all these beautiful systems, all these
theories that explain to mankind its true, normal interests, so that,
striving necessarily to attain these interests, it would at once become
good and noble - all this, in my opinion, is so far only logistics! Yes,
sirs, logistics! For merely to assert this theory of the renewal of all
mankind by means of a system of its own profits - this, to my mind, is
almost the same as… well, let’s say, for example, the same as asserting,
with Buckle, that man gets softer from civilization and, consequently,
becomes less bloodthirsty and less capable of war.11 Logically, it
seems, that’s what he comes up with. But man is so partial to systems
and abstract conclusions that he is ready intentionally to distort the
truth, to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, only so as to justify his
logic.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ve chosen this example, because it is an all too vivid
one. Why, look around you: blood is flowing in rivers, and in such a
jolly way besides, like champagne. Take this whole nineteenth century of
ours, in which Buckle also lived. Take Napoleon - both the great one and
the present one. Take North America - that everlasting union. Take,
finally, this caricature of a Schleswig-Holstein …12 What is it that
civilization softens in us? Civilization cultivates only a versatility
of sensations in man, and… decidedly nothing else. And through the
development of this versatility, man may even reach the point of finding
pleasure in blood. Indeed, this has already happened to him. Have you
noticed that the most refined blood-shedders have almost all been the
most civilized gentlemen, to whom the various Attilas and Stenka
Razins13 sometimes could not hold a candle? And if they don’t strike one
as sharply as Attila or Stenka Razin, it is precisely because they occur
too frequently, they are too ordinary, too familiar a sight. If man has
not become more bloodthirsty from civilization, at any rate he has
certainly become bloodthirsty in a worse, a viler way than formerly.
Formerly, he saw justice in bloodshed and with a quiet conscience
exterminated whoever he had to; while now, though we do regard bloodshed
as vile, we still occupy ourselves with this vileness, and even more
than formerly. Which is worse? — decide for yourselves. They say that
Cleopatra (excuse this example from Roman history) liked to stick golden
pins into her slave girls’ breasts, and took pleasure in their screaming
and writhing. You’ll say that this was, relatively speaking, in
barbarous times; that now, too, the times are barbarous because (again
relatively speaking) now, too, pins get stuck in; that now, too, though
man has learned to see more clearly on occasion than in barbarous times,
he is still far from having grown accustomed to acting as reason and
science dictate. But even so you are perfectly confident that he will
not fail to grow accustomed once one or two old bad habits have passed
and once common sense and science have thoroughly re-educated and given
a normal direction to human nature. You are confident that man will then
voluntarily cease making mistakes and,</p>
<p>willy-nilly, so to speak, refuse to set his will at variance with his
normal interests. Moreover: then, you say, science itself will teach man
(though this is really a luxury in my opinion) that in fact he has
neither will nor caprice, and never did have any, and that he himself is
nothing but a sort of piano key or a sprig in an organ;14 and that,
furthermore, there also exist in the world the laws of nature; so that
whatever he does is done not at all according to his own wanting, but of
itself, according to the laws of nature. Consequently, these laws of
nature need only be discovered, and then man will no longer be
answerable for his actions, and his life will become extremely easy.
Needless to say, all human actions will then be calculated according to
these laws, mathematically, like a table of logarithms, up to 108,000,
and entered into a calendar; or, better still, some well-meaning
publications will appear, like the present-day encyclopedic
dictionaries, in which everything will be so precisely calculated and
designated that there will no longer be any actions or adventures in the
world.</p>
<p>And it is then - this is still you speaking - that new economic
relations will come, quite ready-made, and also calculated with
mathematical precision, so that all possible questions will vanish in an
instant, essentially because they will have been given all possible
answers. Then the crystal palace will get built.15 Then… well, in short,
then the bird Kagan will come flying.16 Of course, there’s no
guaranteeing (this is me speaking now) that it won’t, for example, be
terribly boring then (because what is there to do if everything’s
calculated according to some little table?), but, on the other hand, it
will all be extremely reasonable. Of course, what inventions can boredom
not lead to! Golden pins also get stuck in from boredom, but all that
would be nothing. The bad thing is (this is me speaking again) that, for
all I know, they may be glad of the golden pins then. Man really is
stupid, phenomenally stupid. That is, he’s by no means stupid, but
rather he’s so ungrateful that it would be hard to find the likes of
him. I, for example, would not be the least bit surprised if suddenly,
out of the blue, amid the universal future reasonableness, some
gentleman of ignoble, or, better, of</p>
<p>retrograde and jeering physiognomy, should emerge, set his arms
akimbo, and say to us all: “Well, gentlemen, why don’t we reduce all
this reasonableness to dust with one good kick, for the sole purpose of
sending all these logarithms to the devil and living once more according
to our own stupid will!“ That would still be nothing, but what is
offensive is that he’d be sure to find followers: that’s how man is
arranged. And all this for the emptiest of reasons, which would seem not
even worth mentioning: namely, that man, whoever he might be, has always
and everywhere liked to act as he wants, and not at all as reason and
profit dictate; and one can want even against one’s own profit, and one
sometimes even positively must (this is my i.e. now). One’s own free and
voluntary wanting, one’s own caprice, however wild, one’s own fancy,
though chafed sometimes to the point of madness - all this is that same
most profitable profit, the omitted one, which does not fit into any
classification, and because of which all systems and theories are
constantly blown to the devil. And where did all these sages get the
i.e. that man needs some normal, some virtuous wanting? What made them
necessarily imagine that what man needs is necessarily a reasonably
profitable wanting? Man needs only independent wanting, whatever this
independence may cost and wherever it may lead. Well, and this wanting,
the devil knows …</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>HA, ha, ha! but in fact, if you want to know, there isn’t any
wanting!“ you interrupt with a guffaw. “Today’s science has even so
succeeded in anatomizing man up that we now know that wanting and
so-called free will are nothing else but…“</p>
<p>Wait, gentlemen, I myself wanted to begin that way. I confess, I even
got scared. I just wanted to cry out that wanting depends on the devil
knows what, and thank God, perhaps, for that, but I remembered about
this science and… backed off. And just then you started talking. And
indeed, well, if one day</p>
<p>hey really find the formula for all our wantings and caprices -that
is, what they depend on, by precisely what laws they occur, precisely
how they spread, what they strive for in such-and-such a case, and so on
and so forth; a real, mathematical formula, that is - then perhaps man
will immediately stop wanting; what’s more, perhaps he will certainly
stop. Who wants to want according to a little table? Moreover: he will
immediately turn from a man into a sprig in an organ or something of the
sort; because what is man without desires, without will, and without
wantings, if not a sprig in an organ barrel? What do you think?</p>
<ul>
<li>let’s reckon up the probabilities - can it happen or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>“Hm…“ you decide, “our wantings are for the most part mistaken owing
to a mistaken view of our profit. We sometimes want pure rubbish
precisely because, in our stupidity, we see this rubbish as the easiest
path to the attainment of some preconceived profit. Well, but when it’s
all explained, worked out on a piece of paper (which is quite possible
because, after all, it’s vile and senseless to believe beforehand that
there are certain laws of nature which man will never learn) - then, to
be sure, there will be no more so-called desires. For if wanting someday
gets completely in cahoots with reason, then essentially we shall be
reasoning and not wanting, because it really is impossible, for example,
while preserving reason, to want senselessness and thus knowingly go
against reason and wish yourself harm … And since all wantings and
reasonings can indeed be calculated</p>
<ul>
<li>because, after all, they will someday discover the laws of our
so-called free will - then consequently, and joking aside, something
like a little table can be arranged, so that we shall indeed want
according to this little table. For if it should someday be worked out
and proved to me that when I made a fig at such-and-such a person, it
was precisely because I could not do otherwise, and that I was bound to
do it with such-and-such a finger, then what is left so free in me,
especially if I am a learned man and have completed a course of studies
somewhere? No, then I can calculate my life for thirty years ahead; in
short, if this does get arranged, then we really will have no choice;
we’ll have to accept it in any case. And, generally, we ought
tirelessly</li>
</ul>
<p>o repeat to ourselves that, precisely at such-and-such a moment, in
such-and-such circumstances, nature does not ask our permission; that it
must be accepted as it is, and not as we fancy, and if we are really
aiming at a little table and a calendar, and… well, and even at a
retort, then there’s no help for it, we must accept the retort! Or else
it will get accepted of itself, without you…“</p>
<p>Yes, sirs, but for me that’s just where the hitch comes! You will
forgive me, gentlemen, for philosophizing away; it’s a matter of forty
years underground! Allow me to indulge my fancy a bit. You see: reason,
gentlemen, is a fine thing, that is unquestionable, but reason is only
reason and satisfies only man’s reasoning capacity, while wanting is a
manifestation of the whole of life - that is, the whole of human life,
including reason and various little itches. And though our life in this
manifestation often turns out to be a bit of trash, still it is life and
not just the extraction of a square root. I, for example, quite
naturally want to live so as to satisfy my whole capacity for living,
and not so as to satisfy just my reasoning capacity alone, which is some
twentieth part of my whole capacity for living. What does reason know?
Reason knows only what it has managed to learn (some things, perhaps, it
will never learn; this is no consolation, but why not say it anyway?),
while human nature acts as an entire whole, with everything that is in
it, consciously and unconsciously, and though it lies, still it lives. I
suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking at me with pity; you repeat to
me that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future
man will be, simply cannot knowingly want anything unprofitable for
himself, that this is mathematics. I agree completely, it is indeed
mathematics. But I repeat to you for the hundredth time, there is only
one case, one only, when man may purposely, consciously wish for himself
even the harmful, the stupid, even what is stupidest of all: namely, so
as to have the right to wish for himself even what is stupidest of all
and not be bound by an obligation to wish for himself only what is
intelligent. For this stupidest of all, this caprice of ours, gentlemen,
may in fact be the most profitable of anything on earth</p>
<p>for our sort, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may
be more profitable than all other profits even in the case when it is
obviously harmful and contradicts the most sensible conclusions of our
reason concerning profits - because in any event it preserves for us the
chiefest and dearest thing, that is, our personality and our
individuality. Now, some insist that this is indeed the dearest of all
things for man; wanting may, of course, converge with reason, if it
wants, especially if this is not abused but is done with moderation; it
is both useful and sometimes even praiseworthy. But wanting is very
often, and even for the most part, completely and stubbornly at odds
with reason, and… and… and, do you know, this, too, is useful and
sometimes even quite praiseworthy? Suppose, gentlemen, that man is not
stupid. (Really, it is quite impossible to say he is, for the sole
reason that if he is stupid, who then is intelligent?) But even if he
isn’t stupid, all the same he’s monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally
ungrateful. I even think the best definition of man is: a being that
goes on two legs and is ungrateful. But that’s still not all; that’s
still not his chief defect; his chiefest defect is his constant lack of
good behavior - constant from the great flood to the Schleswig-Holstein
period of man’s destiny. Lack of good behavior and, consequently, lack
of good sense; for it has long been known that lack of good sense comes
from nothing else but the lack of good behavior. Try casting a glance at
the history of mankind; well, what will you see? Majestic? Maybe it is
majestic; the Colossus of Rhodes alone, for example, is worth something!
Not without reason did Mr Anaevsky17 testify that while some say it was
the work of human hands, others insist it was created by nature itself.
Colorful? Maybe it is colorful; one need only sort through the
full-dress military and civil uniforms of all times and all peoples -
that alone is worth something, and if you were to add the uniforms of
the lower civil ranks, you could really break a leg; no historian would
be left standing. Monotonous? Well, maybe also monotonous: they fight
and fight, they fight now, and fought before, and fought afterwards -
you’ll agree it’s even all too monotonous. In short, anything can be
said about world history,</p>
<p>anything that might just enter the head of the most disturbed
imagination. Only one thing cannot be said - that it is sensible. You’d
choke on the first word. And one even comes upon this sort of thing all
the time: there constantly appear in life people of such good behavior
and good sense, such sages and lovers of mankind, as precisely make it
their goal to spend their entire lives in the best-behaved and most
sensible way possible, to become, so to speak, a light for their
neighbors, essentially in order to prove to them that one can indeed
live in the world as a person of good behavior and good sense. And what
then? It is known that sooner or later, towards the end of their lives,
many of these lovers have betrayed themselves, producing some anecdote,
sometimes even of the most indecent sort. Now I ask you: what can be
expected of man as a being endowed with such strange qualities? Shower
him with all earthly blessings, drown him in happiness completely, over
his head, so that only bubbles pop up on the surface of happiness, as on
water; give him such economic satisfaction that he no longer has
anything left to do at all except sleep, eat gingerbread, and worry
about the noncessation of world history-and it is here, just here, that
he, this man, out of sheer ingratitude, out of sheer lampoonery, will do
something nasty. He will even risk his gingerbread, and wish on purpose
for the most pernicious nonsense, the most noneconomical
meaninglessness, solely in order to mix into all this positive good
sense his own pernicious, fantastical element. It is precisely his
fantastic dreams, his most banal stupidity, that he will wish to keep
hold of, with the sole purpose of confirming to himself (as if it were
so very necessary) that human beings are still human beings and not
piano keys, which, though played upon with their own hands by the laws
of nature themselves, are in danger of being played so much that outside
the calendar it will be impossible to want anything. And more than that:
even if it should indeed turn out that he is a piano key, if it were
even proved to him mathematically and by natural science, he would still
not come to reason, but would do something contrary on purpose, solely
out of ingratitude alone; essentially to have his own way. And if he
finds himself without means -</p>
<p>he will invent destruction and chaos, he will invent all kinds of
suffering, and still have his own way! He will launch a curse upon the
world, and since man alone is able to curse (that being his privilege,
which chiefly distinguishes him from other animals), he may achieve his
end by the curse alone - that is, indeed satisfy himself that he is a
man and not a piano key! If you say that all this, the chaos and
darkness and cursing, can also be calculated according to a little
table, so that the mere possibility of a prior calculation will put a
stop to it all and reason will claim its own - then he will deliberately
go mad for the occasion, so as to do without reason and still have his
own way! I believe in this, I will answer for this, because the whole
human enterprise seems indeed to consist in man’s proving to himself
every moment that he is a man and not a sprig! With his own skin if need
be, but proving it; by troglodytism if need be, but proving it. And how

one is taking my will from me here; that all they’re doing here is
busily arranging it somehow so that my will, of its own will, coincides
with my normal interests, with the laws of nature, and with
arithmetic.</p>
<p>Eh, gentlemen, what sort of will of one’s own can there be if it
comes to tables and arithmetic, and the only thing going is two times
two is four? Two times two will be four even without my will. As if that
were any will of one’s own!</p>
