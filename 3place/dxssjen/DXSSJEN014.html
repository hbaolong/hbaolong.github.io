<h4 id="v">V</h4>
<p>Here it is, here it is at last, the encounter with reality,“ I
muttered, rushing headlong down the stairs. “This is no longer the Pope
leaving Rome and going to Brazil; this is no longer a ball on Lake
Como!“</p>
<p>“What a scoundrel you are,“ raced through my head, “to laugh at that
now!“</p>
<p>“What of it!“ I cried, answering myself. “All is lost now!“</p>
<p>Their trail was already cold; but no matter: I knew where they had
gone.</p>
<p>By the porch stood a lonely jack, a night coachman, in a homespun
coat all dusted with the still-falling wet and as if warm snow. It was
steamy and stuffy. His shaggy little piebald nag was also all dusted
with snow, and was coughing - I very much remember that. I rushed to the
bast-covered sled; but as I raised my foot to get in, the recollection
of the way Simonov had just given me the six roubles cut me down, and I
dropped into the sled like a sack.</p>
<p>“No! Much must be done to redeem it all!“ I cried out, “but I will
redeem it, or perish on the spot this very night! Drive!“</p>
<p>We set off. A whole whirlwind was spinning in my head.</p>
<p>“Beg for my friendship on their knees - that they won’t do. It’s a
mirage, a vulgar mirage, revolting, romantic, and fantastic; another
ball on Lake Como. And therefore I must slap Zverkov’s face! It’s my
duty. And so, it’s decided; I’m flying now to slap his face.“</p>
<p>“Faster!“</p>
<p>The jack started snapping the reins.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it as soon as I walk in. Ought I to say a few words first,
as a preface to the slap? No! I’ll just walk in and slap him. They’ll
all be sitting in the drawing room, and he’ll be on the sofa with
Olympia. Cursed Olympia! She laughed at my face once and refused me.
I’ll pull Olympia by the hair, and Zverkov by the ears! No, better by
one ear, and by that ear I’ll lead him around the whole room. They’ll
probably all start beating me and kick me out. It’s even certain. Let
them! Still, I slapped’ him first: it was my initiative; and by the code
of honor - that’s everything; he’s branded now, and no beating can wash
away that slap, but only a duel. He’ll have to fight. Yes, and let them
beat me now. Let them, ignoble as they are! Trudolyubov especially will
do the beating - he’s so strong; Ferfichkin will fasten on from the
side, and certainly grab my hair, that’s sure. But let them, let them!
I’m ready for it. Their sheep’s noddles will finally be forced to grasp
the tragic in it all! As they’re dragging me to the door I’ll cry out to
them that in fact they’re not worth my little finger.“</p>
<p>“Faster, coachman, faster!“ I shouted to the jack. He even jumped and
swung his whip. For I shouted quite wildly.</p>
<p>“We’ll fight at dawn, that’s settled. It’s all over with the
department. Ferfichkin said depotment earlier instead of department. But
where to get the pistols? Nonsense! I’ll take an advance on my salary
and buy them. And the powder, and the bullets? That’s the second’s
affair. But how will I manage it all before dawn? And where will I find
a second? I have no acquaintances… Nonsense!“ I cried, whirling myself
up even more, “nonsense! The first passer-by I speak to in the street is
duty-bound to be my second, just like pulling a drowning man</p>
<p>from the water. The most eccentric situations must be allowed for.
Were I to ask even the director himself to be my second tomorrow, he,
too, would have to agree out of knightly feelings alone, and keep the
secret! Anton Antonych…“</p>
<p>The thing was that at the same moment I could see, more clearly and
vividly than anyone else in the entire world, the whole, most odious
absurdity of my suppositions, and the whole other side of the coin,
but…</p>
<p>“Faster, coachman, faster, you rogue!“</p>
<p>“Eh, master!“ said the backbone of the nation.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt cold all over.</p>
<p>“And wouldn’t it be better… better… to go straight home now? Oh, my
God! Why, why did I invite myself to this dinner yesterday! But no,
impossible! And that three-hour stroll from table to stove? No, they,
they and no one else, must pay me for that stroll! They must wash away
that dishonor!“</p>
<p>“Faster!“</p>
<p>“And what if they take me to the police? Would they dare? They’d be
afraid of a scandal. And what if Zverkov should refuse the duel out of
contempt? That’s even certain; but then I’ll prove to them … Then I’ll
rush to the posting-house as he’s leaving tomorrow, I’ll grab him by the
leg, I’ll tear his overcoat off as he’s getting into the coach. I’ll
fasten my teeth on his hand, I’ll bite him. ‘See, all of you, what a
desperate man can be driven to!’ Let him beat me on the head, and the
rest of them from behind. I’ll cry out to all the public: ‘See, here’s a
young pup going off to charm the Circassian girls with my spit on his
face!’</p>
<p>“After that, of course, everything’s over! The department has
vanished from the face of the earth. I’ll be seized, I’ll be taken to
court, I’ll be thrown out of work, put in prison, sent to Siberia,
exiled. Who cares! Fifteen years later I’ll drag myself after him, in
rags, a beggar, when I’m let out of prison. I’ll find him somewhere in a
provincial capital. He’ll be married and happy. He’ll have a grown-up
daughter… I’ll say: ’Look, monster, look at my sunken cheeks and my
rags! I lost everything -career, happiness, art, science, a beloved
woman - and all because</p>
<p>of you. Here are the pistols. I’ve come to discharge my pistol, and…
and I forgive you.’ Here I’ll fire into the air, and — no more will be
heard of me…“</p>
<p>I even began to weep, though I knew perfectly well at the same moment
that all this came from Silvio and from Lermontov’s Masquerade.15And
suddenly I felt terribly ashamed, so ashamed that I stopped the horse,
got out of the sled, and stood in the snow in the middle of the street.
The jack watched me with amazement and sighed.</p>
<p>What was to be done? To go there was impossible - the result would be
nonsense; to leave things as they were was also impossible, because the
result would then be… “Lord! How can I leave it! After such offenses!
No!“ I exclaimed, rushing back to the sled, “it’s predestined, it’s
fate! Drive on, drive on - there!“</p>
<p>And in my impatience I hit the coachman in the neck with my fist.</p>
<p>“What’s with you? Why’re you punching?“ the little peasant cried,
lashing the nag, however, so that she started kicking with her hind
legs.</p>
<p>Wet snow was falling in thick flakes; I uncovered myself, I didn’t
care about it. I forgot everything else, because I had finally resolved
on the slap and felt with horror that it would happen without fail now,
presently, and that no power could stop it. Desolate street-lamps
flashed sullenly in the snowy haze, like torches at a funeral. Snow got
under my overcoat, my jacket, my necktie, and melted there; I didn’t
cover myself; all was lost in any case! We drove up at last. I jumped
out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps, and began knocking at the
door with my hands and feet. My legs especially were growing weak, at
the knees. The door was opened somehow quickly; as if they knew I was
coming. (Indeed, Simonov had forewarned them that there might be one
more, and they had to be forewarned there and generally to take
precautions. This was one of those “fashion shops“ of the time, which
have long since been done away with by the police. During the day it was
actually a shop; and in the evening those who had references could come
and</p>
<p>visit.) I walked with quick steps through the dark store into the
familiar drawing room, where only one candle was burning, and stopped in
perplexity: no one was there.</p>
<p>“Where are they?“ I asked someone.</p>
<p>But, of course, they had already had time to disperse …</p>
<p>In front of me stood a person with a stupid smile, the hostess
herself, who knew me slightly. A moment later the door opened, and
another person came in.</p>
<p>Paying no attention to anything, I was pacing the room and, I think,
talking to myself. It was as if I had been saved from death, and I
joyfully sensed it with my whole being: for I would have slapped him, I
would certainly, certainly have slapped him! But now they’re not here
and… everything’s vanished, everything’s changed!… I kept looking over
my shoulder. I still could not grasp it. Mechanically, I glanced at the
girl who had come in: before me flashed a fresh, young, somewhat pale
face, with straight dark eyebrows and serious, as if somewhat
astonished, eyes. I liked it at once; I would have hated her if she’d
been smiling. I began to study her more attentively and as if with
effort: my thoughts were not all collected yet. There was something
simple-hearted and kind in that face, yet somehow serious to the point
of strangeness. I was certain that it was a disadvantage to her there,
and that none of those fools had noticed her. However, she could not
have been called a beauty, though she was tall, strong, well built. She
was dressed extremely simply. Something nasty stung me; I went straight
up to her…</p>
<p>By chance I looked in a mirror. My agitated face seemed to me
repulsive in the extreme: pale, wicked, mean, with disheveled hair. “Let
it be; I’m glad of it,“ I thought, “I’m precisely glad that I’ll seem
repulsive to her; I like it…“</p>
