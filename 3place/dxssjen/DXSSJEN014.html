<h4 id="vi">VI</h4>
<p>…Somewhere behind a partition, as if under some strong pressure, as
if someone were strangling it, a clock wheezed.</p>
<p>After an unnaturally prolonged wheeze, there followed a thin, vile,
and somehow unexpectedly rapid chiming - as if someone had suddenly
jumped forward. It struck two. I came to my senses, though I had not
been asleep, but only lying there half-oblivious.</p>
<p>The room - narrow, small, and low, encumbered by a huge wardrobe, and
littered with cartons, rags, and all sorts of castoff clothing - was
almost totally dark. The candle-butt burning on the table at the other
end of the room was about to go out, barely flickering every now and
then. In a few moments it would be quite dark.</p>
<p>It did not take me long to recover myself; everything came back to me
at once, without effort, instantly, as if it had just been lying in wait
to pounce on me again. And even in my oblivion there had still
constantly remained some point, as it were, in my memory that simply
refused to be forgotten, around which my drowsy reveries turned heavily.
Yet it was strange: everything that had happened to me that day seemed
to me now, on awakening, to have happened long, long ago, as if I had
long, long ago outlived it all.</p>
<p>There were fumes in my head. Something was as if hovering over me,
brushing against me, agitating and troubling me. Anguish and bile were
again boiling up in me and seeking a way out. Suddenly I saw two open
eyes beside me, peering at me curiously and obstinately. Their
expression was coldly indifferent, sullen, as if utterly alien; it gave
one a heavy feeling.</p>
<p>A sullen thought was born in my brain and passed through my whole
body like some vile sensation, similar to what one feels on entering an
underground cellar, damp and musty. It was somehow unnatural that these
two eyes had only decided precisely now to begin peering at me. It also
occurred to me that in the course of two hours I had not exchanged a
single word with this being and had not considered it at all necessary;
I had even liked it for some reason. But now, all of a sudden, there
appeared before me the absurd, loathsomely spiderish notion of
debauchery, which, without love, crudely and shamelessly begins straight
off with that which is the crown of true love. We looked at each other
like that for a long time, but she</p>
<p>did not lower her eyes before mine, nor did she change their
expression, and in the end, for some reason, this made me feel
eerie.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?“ I asked curtly, so as to put a quick end to
it.</p>
<p>“Liza,“ she replied, almost in a whisper, but somehow quite
unpleasantly, and looked away.</p>
<p>I paused.</p>
<p>“The weather today… the snow… nasty!“ I said, almost to myself,
wearily putting my hand behind my head and looking at the ceiling.</p>
<p>She did not reply. The whole thing was hideous.</p>
<p>“Do you come from around here?“ I asked after a minute, almost
exasperated, turning my head slightly towards her.</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Where, then?“</p>
<p>“From Riga,“ she said reluctantly.</p>
<p>“German?“</p>
<p>“Russian.“</p>
<p>“Been here long?“</p>
<p>“Where?“</p>
<p>“In this house.“</p>
<p>“Two weeks.“ She spoke more and more curtly. The candle went out
altogether; I could no longer make out her face.</p>
<p>“Do you have a father and mother?“</p>
<p>“Yes… no… I do.“</p>
<p>“Where are they?“</p>
<p>“There… in Riga.“</p>
<p>“What are they?“</p>
<p>“Just…“</p>
<p>“Just what? What are they, socially?“</p>
<p>“Tradespeople.“</p>
<p>“You were living with them?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“How old are you?“</p>
<p>“Twenty.“</p>
<p>“Why did you leave them?“</p>
<p>“Just…“</p>
<p>This “just“ meant: let me alone, this is sickening. We fell
silent.</p>
<p>God knows why I wouldn’t leave. I myself felt more and more sickened
and anguished. Images of the whole past day began to pass confusedly
through my memory, somehow of themselves, without my will. I suddenly
recalled a scene I had witnessed that morning in the street, as I was
trotting along, preoccupied, to work.</p>
<p>“They were carrying a coffin out today and almost dropped it,“ I
suddenly said aloud, not at all wishing to start a conversation, but
just so, almost accidentally.</p>
<p>“A coffin?“</p>
<p>“Yes, in the Haymarket; they were carrying it out of a basement.“</p>
<p>“Out of a basement?“</p>
<p>“Not a basement, but the basement floor… you know… down under… from a
bad house… There was such filth all around… Eggshells, trash… stink… it
was vile.“</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“A bad day for a burial!“ I began again, just not to be silent.</p>
<p>“Why bad?“</p>
<p>“Snow, slush…“ (I yawned.)</p>
<p>“Makes no difference,“ she said suddenly, after some silence.</p>
<p>“No, it’s nasty…“ (I yawned again.) “The gravediggers must have been
swearing because the snow was making it wet. And there must have been
water in the grave.“</p>
<p>“Why water in the grave?“ she asked with a certain curiosity, but
speaking even more rudely and curtly than before. Something suddenly
began egging me on.</p>
<p>“There’d be water in the bottom for sure, about half a foot. Here in
the Volkovo you can never dig a dry grave.“</p>
<p>“Why not?“</p>
<p>“Why not? Such a watery place. It’s swamp all around here. They just
get put down in the water. I’ve seen it myself… many times…“</p>
<p>(I had never once seen it, and had never been in the Volkovo
cemetery, but had only heard people talk.)</p>
<p>“It makes no difference to you how you die?“</p>
<p>“But why should I die?“ she answered, as if defending herself.</p>
<p>“You’ll die someday, and just the same way as that one today. She was
also… a girl… She died of consumption.“</p>
<p>“A jill would have died in the hospital…“ (She already knows about
that, I thought, and she said jill, not girl.)</p>
<p>“She owed money to the madam,“ I objected, egged on more and more by
the argument, “and worked for her almost to the end, even though she had
consumption. The cabbies around there were talking with the soldiers and
told them about it. Probably her old acquaintances. They were laughing.
They wanted to go and commemorate her in a pothouse.“ (Here, too, I was
laying it on thick.)</p>
<p>Silence, deep silence. She did not even stir.</p>
<p>“So it’s better to die in a hospital, is it?“</p>
<p>“What’s the difference… Anyway, who says I’m going to die?“ she added
irritably.</p>
<p>“If not now, then later?“</p>
<p>“Well, and later . . .“</p>
<p>“That’s easy to say! You’re young now, good-looking, fresh -so you’re
worth the price. But after a year of this life you won’t be the same,
you’ll fade.“</p>
<p>“In a year?“</p>
<p>“At any rate, in a year you’ll be worth less,“ I went on, gloatingly.
“So you’ll go from here to somewhere lower, another house. A year later
- to a third house, always lower and lower, and in about seven years
you’ll reach the Haymarket and the basement. That’s still not so bad.
Worse luck will be if on top of that some sickness comes along, say,
some weakness of the chest… or you catch cold, or something. Sickness
doesn’t go away easily in such a life. Once it gets into you, it may not
get out. And so you’ll die.“</p>
<p>“Well, so I’ll die,“ she answered, very spitefully now, and stirred
quickly.</p>
<p>“Still, it’s a pity.“</p>
<p>“For who?“</p>
<p>“A pity about life.“</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Did you have a fiance? Eh?“</p>
<p>“What’s it to you!“</p>
<p>“But I’m not questioning you. It’s nothing to me. Why get angry? Of
course, you may have had your own troubles. What’s that to me? It’s just
a pity.“</p>
<p>“For who?“ “For you.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother…“ she whispered, barely audibly, and stirred again.</p>
<p>This immediately fueled my anger even more. What! I was trying to be
so gentle, and she…</p>
<p>“But what do you think? Is it a good path you’re on, eh?“</p>
<p>“I don’t think anything.“</p>
<p>“And that’s what’s bad, that you don’t think. Wake up while you have
time. And you do have time. You’re still young, good-looking; you could
find love, marry, be happy…“</p>
<p>“Not all the married ones are happy,“ she snapped, in the same rude
patter.</p>
<p>“Not all, of course - but even so it’s much better than here. A whole
lot better. And with love one can live even without happiness. Life is
good even in sorrow, it’s good to live in the world, no matter how. And
what is there here except… stench. Phew!“</p>
<p>I turned to her with loathing; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I
myself began to feel what I was saying, and became excited. I already
thirsted to expound my cherished “little ideas,“ lived out in my corner.
Something in me suddenly lit up, some goal “appeared.“</p>
<p>“Never mind my being here, I’m no example for you. Maybe I’m even
worse than you. Anyway, I was drunk when I stopped here,“ I still
hastened to justify myself. “Besides, a man is no sort of example for a
woman. It’s a different thing; I may dirty and befoul myself, but all
the same I’m nobody’s slave; I’m here, then I’m gone, and that’s all.
I’ve shaken it off, and it’s no longer me. But let’s admit that you’re a
slave from the first beginning. Yes, a slave! You give up everything,
all your will. Later you</p>
<p>may want to break these chains, but no: they’ll ensnare you more and
more strongly. That’s how this cursed chain is. I know it. I won’t even
speak about other things, you perhaps wouldn’t understand me, but just
tell me: no doubt you’re already in debt to the madam? So, you see!“ I
added, though she did not answer me, but only listened silently, with
her whole being; “there’s a chain for you! Now you’ll never get it paid
off. That’s how they do it. The same as selling your soul to the
devil…</p>
<p>“… Besides, I… how do you know, maybe I’m just as unfortunate as you
are, and so I get into the muck on purpose, from misery. People do drink
from grief: well, so I’m here - from grief. Now tell me, where’s the
good in it: here you and I… came together… tonight, and we didn’t say a
word to each other all the while, and only afterwards you started
peering at me like a wild thing, and I at you. Is that any way to love?
Is that any way for two human beings to come together? It’s simply an
outrage, that’s what!“</p>
<p>“Yes!“ she agreed, abruptly and hastily. I was even surprised by the
hastiness of this “yes.“ So perhaps the same thought was wandering
through her mind as she was peering at me just now? So she, too, is
already capable of certain thoughts?… “Devil take it, that’s curious,
it’s - akin“ I reflected, almost rubbing my hands. “No, how can I fail
to get the better of such a young soul?…“</p>
<p>It was the game that fascinated me most of all.</p>
<p>She turned her head closer to me and, it seemed to me in the
darkness, propped it with her hand. Perhaps she was peering at me. How
sorry I was that I couldn’t make out her eyes. I heard her deep
breathing.</p>
<p>“Why did you come here?“ I began, now with a sense of power. I
just…</p>
<p>“And how good it would be to be living in your father’s house! Warm,
free; your own nest.“</p>
<p>“And what if it’s worse than that?“</p>
<p>A thought flashed in me: “I must find the right tone; sentimentality
may not get me far.“</p>
<p>However, it merely flashed. I swear she really did interest me.
Besides, I was somehow unnerved and susceptible. And knavery goes so
easily with feeling.</p>
<p>“Who can say!“ I hastened to reply. “All sorts of things happen. Now,
I’m sure someone wronged you, and it’s rather they who are guilty before
you than you before them. I know nothing of your story, but a girl of
your sort certainly wouldn’t come here of her own liking…“</p>
<p>“What sort of girl am I?“ she whispered, barely audibly; but I heard
it.</p>
<p>“Devil take it,“ I thought, “I’m flattering her. This is vile. Or
maybe it’s good…“ She was silent.</p>
<p>“You see, Liza - I’ll speak about myself! If I’d had a family in my
childhood, I wouldn’t be the same as I am now. I often think about it.
No matter how bad things are in a family, still it’s your father and
mother, not enemies, not strangers. At least once a year they’ll show
love for you. Still you know you belong there. I grew up without a
family: that must be why I turned out this way… unfeeling.“</p>
<p>I bided my time again.</p>
<p>“Maybe she just doesn’t understand,“ I thought, “and anyway it’s
ridiculous - this moralizing.“</p>
<p>“If I were a father and had a daughter, I think I’d love my daughter
more than my sons, really,“ I began obliquely, as if talking about
something else, to divert her. I confess I was blushing.</p>
<p>“Why is that?“ she asked.</p>
<p>Ah, so she’s listening!</p>
<p>“I just would; I don’t know, Liza. You see: I knew a father who was a
stern, severe man, but he was forever on his knees before his daughter,
kept kissing her hands and feet, couldn’t have enough of admiring her,
really. She’d be dancing at a party, and he’d stand for five hours in
the same spot, unable to take his eyes off her. He was mad about her; I
can understand that. She’d get tired at night and go to sleep, and he
would wake up and start kissing her and making the sign of the cross
over her while she slept. He himself went around in a greasy jacket,
was</p>
<p>niggardly with everybody, but for her he’d have spent his last
kopeck, he kept giving her rich presents, and what a joy it was for him
if she liked the present. A father always loves his daughters more than
a mother does. It’s a delight for some girls to live at home! And I
don’t think I’d even give my daughter in marriage.“</p>
<p>“Why not?“ she said, with a slight chuckle.</p>
<p>“I’d be jealous, by God. How could she kiss another man? Or love a
stranger more than her father? It’s even painful to imagine it. Of
course, that’s all nonsense; of course, everyone will finally see
reason. But I think, before giving her away, I’d wear myself out just
with worry: I’d reject one suitor after another. But in the end I’d
marry her to the one she herself loved. To a father, the man his
daughter falls in love with herself always seems the worst. That’s how
it is. Much harm is done in families because of it.“</p>
<p>“Some are glad to sell their daughter, and not give her away
honorably,“ she suddenly said.</p>
<p>Ah! That’s what it is!</p>
<p>“That happens, Liza, in those cursed families where there is neither
God nor love,“ I picked up heatedly, “and where there is no love, there
is no reason. Such families do exist, it’s true, but I’m not talking
about them. Evidently you saw no goodness in your family, since you talk
that way. You’re one of the truly unfortunate ones. Hm… It all comes
mainly from poverty.“</p>
<p>“And is it any better with the masters? Honest people have good lives
even in poverty.“</p>
<p>“Hm… yes. Perhaps. Then there’s this, Liza: man only likes counting
his grief, he doesn’t count his happiness. But if he were to count
properly, he’d see that there’s enough of both lots for him. Well, and
what if everything goes right in the family, God blesses it, your
husband turns out to be a good man, who loves you, pampers you, never
leaves your side! It’s good in this family! Oftentimes even half mixed
with grief it’s still good; and where is there no grief? Perhaps, once
you get married, you’ll find out for yourself. But take just the
beginning, after you’ve married someone you love: there’s such happiness
at</p>
<p>imes, so much happiness! I mean, day in and day out. In the
beginning, even quarrels with a husband end well. Some women, the more
they love, the more they pick quarrels with their husbands. It’s true; I
knew such a woman: ‘You see,’ she all but said, ‘I love you very much,
and torment you out of love, and you ought to feel it.’ Do you know that
one can deliberately torment a person out of love? Women, mainly. And
she thinks to herself: ‘But afterwards I’ll love him so much for it,
I’ll caress him so, that it’s no sin to torment him a bit now.’ And at
home everyone rejoices over you, and it’s good, and cheery, and
peaceful, and honest… Then, too, there’s the jealous sort. He goes out
somewhere - I knew one like this - she can’t help herself, she jumps out
at night and runs on the sly to see: is he there, is he in that house,
is he with that woman? Now, that is bad. And she knows herself that it’s
bad, and her heart is sinking, and she blames herself, and yet she loves
him; it’s all from love. And how good to make peace after a quarrel, to
own up to him, or to forgive! And how good, how good they both suddenly
feel - as if they were meeting anew, getting married anew, beginning to
love anew. And no one, no one ought to know what goes on between a
husband and wife if they love each other. And whatever quarrel they may
have - they shouldn’t call even their mother to be their judge or hear
them tell about each other. They are their own judges. Love - is God’s
mystery, and should be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens.
It’s holier that way, and better. They respect each other more, and so
much is founded on respect. And if there was love once, if they were
married out of love, why should love pass? Can’t it be sustained? It
rarely happens that it can’t be. Well, and if the husband proves to be a
kind and honest man, how can love pass? The first married love will
pass, true, but then an even better love will come. Then their souls
will grow close; they’ll decide all their doings together; they’ll have
no secrets from each other. And when children arrive, then all of it,
even the hardest times, will look like happiness; one need only love and
have courage. Now even work brings joy, now even if you must
occasionally deny yourself bread for the children’s sake, still</p>
<p>here is joy. For they will love you for it later; so you’re laying
aside for yourself. The children are growing - you feel you’re an
example to them, a support for them; that even when you die, they’ll
bear your thoughts and feelings upon themselves as they received them
from you, they’ll take on your image and likeness.16 So it is a great
duty. How can a father and mother fail to grow closer? People say it’s
hard having children. Who says so? It’s a heavenly happiness! Do you
love little children, Liza? I love them terribly. You know - there’s
this rosy little boy sucking at your breast, now what husband’s heart
could turn against his wife, looking at her sitting with his child! The
baby is rosy, plump, pampered, sprawling; his little hands and feet are
pudgy; his nails are so clean and small, so small it’s funny to see; his
eyes seem to understand everything already. He’s sucking and clutching
at your breast with his little hand, playing. The father comes up -
he’ll tear himself away from the breast, bend back, look at his father,
laughing - as if it really were God knows how funny - and then again,
again start sucking. Or else he’ll up and bite his mother’s breast, if
he’s already cutting teeth, while giving her a sidelong look: ‘See how I
bit you!’ Isn’t this the whole of happiness, when they’re all three
together, husband, wife, and child? A lot can be forgiven for those
moments. No, Liza, one must first learn how to live, and only then
accuse others!“</p>
<p>“With pictures,“ I thought to myself, “I’ll get you with these
pictures!“ - though, by God, I had spoken with feeling - and suddenly
blushed. “What if she suddenly bursts out laughing, what will I do with
myself then?“ The i.e. infuriated me. I had indeed become excited
towards the end of my speech, and now my vanity somehow suffered. The
silence continued. I even wanted to nudge her.</p>
<p>“It’s like you…“ she began suddenly, and stopped.</p>
<p>But I already understood everything: something different was
trembling in her voice now, not sharp, not rude, not unyielding as
before, but something soft and bashful, so bashful that I myself felt
abashed, felt guilty before her.</p>
<p>“What?“ I asked, with tender curiosity.</p>
<p>“But you…“</p>
<p>“What?“</p>
<p>“It’s as if you… as if it’s from a book,“ she said, and again
something like mockery suddenly sounded in her voice.</p>
<p>I was painfully twinged by this remark. It was not what I was
expecting.</p>
<p>I did not even understand that she was purposely assuming a mask of
mockery, that this is the usual last device of a bashful and
chaste-hearted person whose soul is being rudely and importunately pried
into, and who will not surrender till the last minute out of pride, and
is afraid of showing any feeling before you. I should have guessed it
from the very timidity with which she ventured, haltingly, upon her
mockery, before she finally brought herself to express it. But I did not
guess, and a wicked feeling took hold of me. “You just wait,“ I
thought.</p>
