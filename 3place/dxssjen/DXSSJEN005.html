<p>No, how is it possible, how is it at all possible for a man to have
the slightest respect for himself, if he has presumed to find pleasure
even in the very sense of his own humiliation? I am not speaking this
way now out of some cloying repentance. And, generally, I hated saying:
“Forgive me, papa, I won’t do it again“ - not because I was incapable of
saying it, but, on the contrary, perhaps precisely because I was all too
capable of it. And how! As if on purpose, I used to bumble into it on
occasions when I’d never thought or dreamed</p>
<p>of doing anything wrong. That was the nastiest thing of all. And
there I’d be again, waxing tenderhearted, repenting, shedding tears, and
certainly hoodwinking myself, though I wasn’t pretending in the least.
It was my heart that somehow kept mucking things up … Here even the laws
of nature could no longer be blamed, though still, throughout my life,
the laws of nature have offended me constantly and more than anything
else. It’s nasty to look back on it all, and it was nasty then as well.
For a minute or so later I’d be reasoning spitefully that it was all a
lie, a lie, a loathsome, affected lie - that is, all these repentances,
tenderheartednesses, all these vows of regeneration. And you ask why I
twisted and tormented myself so? Answer: because it was just too boring
to sit there with folded arms, that’s why I’d get into such flourishes.
Really, it was so. Observe yourselves more closely, gentlemen, and
you’ll understand that it is so. I made up adventures and devised a life
for myself so as to live, at least somehow, a little. How many times it
happened to me - well, say, for example, to feel offended, just so, for
no reason, on purpose; and I’d know very well that I felt offended for
no reason, that I was affecting it, but you can drive yourself so far
that in the end, really, you do indeed get offended. Somehow all my life
I’ve had an urge to pull such stunts, so that in the end I could no
longer control myself. Another time, twice even, I decided to force
myself to fall in love. And I did suffer, gentlemen, I assure you. Deep
in one’s soul it’s hard to believe one is suffering, mockery is stirring
there, but all the same I suffer, and in a real, honest-to-god way; I
get jealous, lose my temper… And all that from boredom, gentlemen, all
from boredom; crushed by inertia. For the direct, lawful, immediate
fruit of consciousness is inertia - that is, a conscious sitting with
folded arms. I’ve already mentioned this above. I repeat, I emphatically
repeat: ingenuous people and active figures are all active simply
because they are dull and narrow-minded. How to explain it? Here’s how:
as a consequence of their narrow-mindedness, they take the most
immediate and secondary causes for the primary ones, and thus become
convinced more quickly and easily than others that they</p>
<p>have found an indisputable basis for their doings, and so they feel
at ease; and that, after all, is the main thing. For in order to begin
to act, one must first be completely at ease, so that no more doubts
remain. Well, and how am I, for example, to set myself at ease? Where
are the primary causes on which I can rest, where are my bases? Where am
I going to get them? I exercise thinking, and, consequently, for me
every primary cause immediately drags with it yet another, still more
primary one, and so on ad infinitum. Such is precisely the essence of
all consciousness and thought. So, once again it’s the laws of nature.
And what, finally, is the result? The same old thing. Remember: I was
speaking just now about revenge. (You probably didn’t grasp it.) I said:
a man takes revenge because he finds justice in it. That means he has
found a primary cause, a basis - namely, justice. So he is set at ease
on all sides and, consequently, takes his revenge calmly and
successfully, being convinced that he is doing an honest and just thing.
Whereas I do not see any justice here, nor do I find any virtue in it,
and, consequently, if I set about taking revenge, it will be solely out
of wickedness. Wickedness could, of course, overcome everything, all my
doubts, and thus could serve quite successfully in place of a primary
cause, precisely in that it is not a cause. But what’s to be done if
there is also no wickedness in me? (I did begin with that just now.) The
spite in me, again as a consequence of those cursed laws of
consciousness, undergoes a chemical breakdown. Before your eyes the
object vanishes, the reasons evaporate, the culprit is not to be found,
the offense becomes not an offense but a fatum, something like a
toothache, for which no one is to blame, and, consequently, what remains
is again the same way out - that is, to give the wall a painful beating.
And so you just wave it aside, because you haven’t found the primary
cause. But try getting blindly carried away by your feelings, without
reasoning, without a primary cause, driving consciousness away at least
for a time; start hating, or fall in love, only so as not to sit with
folded arms. The day after tomorrow, at the very latest, you’ll begin to
despise yourself for having knowingly hoodwinked yourself. The result: a
soap</p>
<p>bubble, and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, perhaps I really regard myself as
an intelligent man only because throughout my entire life I’ve never
been able to start or finish anything. Granted, granted I’m a babbler, a
harmless, irksome babbler, as we all are. But what’s to be done if the
sole and express purpose of every intelligent man is babble - that is, a
deliberate pouring from empty into void.</p>
