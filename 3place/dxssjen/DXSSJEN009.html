<h4 id="i">I</h4>
<p>At that time I was only twenty-four years old. My life then was
already gloomy, disorderly, and solitary to the point of savagery. I did
not associate with anyone, even avoided speaking, and shrank more and
more into my corner. At work, in the office, I even tried not to look at
anyone, and I noticed very well that my colleagues not only considered
me an odd man, but - as I also kept fancying - seemed to look at me with
a certain loathing. It used to occur to me: why does no one except me
fancy that people look at him with loathing? There was one in our office
who had a disgusting and most pockmarked face, even somehow like a
bandit’s. With such an indecent face, I think I wouldn’t even have dared
to glance at</p>
<p>anyone. Another hadn’t changed his uniform for so long that there was
a bad smell in his vicinity. And yet neither of these gentlemen was
embarrassed - either with regard to his clothes or his face, or somehow
morally. Neither the one nor the other imagined that he was looked at
with loathing; and even if they had imagined it, it would have been all
the same to them, so long as their superiors did not deign to pay heed.
It’s perfectly clear to me now that it was I who, owing to my boundless
vanity, and hence also my exactingness towards myself, very often looked
upon myself with furious dissatisfaction, reaching the point of
loathing, and therefore mentally attributed my view to everyone else. I
hated my face, for example, found it odious, and even suspected that
there was some mean expression in it, and therefore every time I came to
work I made a painful effort to carry myself as independently as
possible, so as not to be suspected of meanness, and to express as much
nobility as possible with my face. “Let it not be a beautiful face,“ I
thought, “but, to make up for that, let it be a noble, an expressive,
and, above all, an extremely intelligent one.“ Yet I knew, with
certainty and suffering, that I would never be able to express all those
perfections with the face I had. The most terrible thing was that I
found it positively stupid. And I would have been quite satisfied with
intelligence. Let’s even say I would even have agreed to a mean
expression, provided only that at the same time my face be found
terribly intelligent.</p>
<p>Of course, I hated them all in our office, from first to last, and
despised them all, but at the same time I was also as if afraid of them.
It happened that I would suddenly set them above myself. Things were
somehow sudden with me in those days: now I despised them, now I set
them above me. A developed and decent man cannot be vain without a
boundless exactingness towards himself and without despising himself at
moments to the point of hatred. But whether I despised them or set them
above me, I used to drop my eyes before almost everyone I met. I even
made experiments: will I be able to endure so-and-so’s glance on me? -
and I was always the first to drop my eyes. This tormented me to the
point of fury.</p>
<p>I was also afraid to the point of illness of being ridiculous, and
therefore slavishly worshiped routine in everything to do with
externals; I loved falling into the common rut, and feared any
eccentricity in myself with all my soul. But how could I hold out? I was
morbidly developed, as a man of our time ought to be developed. And they
were all dull-witted and as like one another as a flock of sheep.
Perhaps to me alone in the whole office did it constantly seem that I
was a coward and a slave; it seemed so to me precisely because I was
developed. But it not only seemed, in fact it really was so: I was a
coward and a slave. I say it without any embarrassment. Every decent man
of our time is and must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal
condition. I am deeply convinced of it. He’s made that way, and arranged
for it. And not in the present time, owing to some sort of chance
circumstances, but generally in all times a decent man must be a coward
and a slave. That is the natural law of all decent people on earth. If
one of them does happen to get up a bit of pluck in something, let him
not be eased or pleased by that: he’ll still quail before something
else. Such is the sole and everlasting outcome. Only asses and their
mongrels show pluck, and even then only up to that certain wall. It’s
not worth paying any attention to them, because they mean precisely
nothing.</p>
<p>One other circumstance tormented me then: namely, that no one else
was like me, and I was like no one else. “I am one, and they are all,“
thought I, and - I’d fall to thinking.</p>
<p>Which shows what a young pup I still was.</p>
<p>Contraries also occurred. It was sometimes so disgusting to go to the
office: it reached the point that I would often come home from work
sick. Then suddenly, for no reason at all, comes a spell of skepticism
and indifference (everything came in spells with me), and here I am
laughing at my own intolerance and fastidiousness, reproaching myself
with romanticism. One moment I don’t even want to speak with anyone, and
the next I go so far that I’m not only chatting away, but am even
deciding to become close with them. All fastidiousness would suddenly
disappear at once, for no reason at all. Who knows, maybe</p>
<p>I never had any, maybe it was just an affectation, out of books? To
this day I haven’t resolved this question. Once I even became quite
friendly with them, began visiting their homes, playing preference,
drinking vodka, discussing promotions… But allow me a digression
here.</p>
<p>We Russians, generally speaking, have never had any stupid,
translunary German, and more especially French, romantics, who are not
affected by anything; let the earth crumble under them, let the whole of
France perish on the barricades - they are what they are, they won’t
change even for the sake of decency, and they’ll go on singing their
translunary songs till their dying day, so to speak, because they’re
fools. But we, in our Russian land, have no fools; that is a known fact;
that’s what makes us different from all those other German lands.
Consequently, we have no translunary natures in a pure state. It was our
“positive“ publicists and critics of the time, hunting after
Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanoviches,2 and being foolish enough to
take them for our ideal, who heaped it all on our romantics, holding
them to be of the same translunary sort as in Germany or France. On the
contrary, the properties of our romantic are utterly and directly
opposite to those of the translunary European, and no little European
yardstick will fit here. (Do permit me the use of this word “romantic“ -
a venerable word, respectable, worthy, and familiar to all.) The
properties of our romantic are to understand everything, to see
everything, and to see often incomparably more clearly than our very
most positive minds do; not to be reconciled with anyone or anything,
but at the same time not to spurn anything; to get around everything, to
yield to everything, to be politic with everyone; never to lose sight of
the useful, practical goal (some nice little government apartment, a
little pension, a little decoration or two) - to keep an eye on this
goal through all enthusiasms and little volumes of lyrical verses, and
at the same time also to preserve “the beautiful and lofty“ inviolate in
himself till his dying day, and incidentally to preserve himself quite
successfully as well, somehow in cotton wool, like some little piece of
jewelry, if only, shall we say, for the benefit of that same</p>
<p>“beautiful and lofty.“ He’s a broad man, our romantic, and the
foremost knave of all our knaves, I can assure you of that… even from
experience. Naturally, all this is so if the romantic is intelligent.
That is - what am I saying! - the romantic is always intelligent; I
merely wished to observe that, while we do happen to have had some fool
romantics, that doesn’t count, for the sole reason that while still in
the bloom of life they regenerated definitively into Germans and, to
preserve their little piece of jewelry more comfortably, settled
somewhere rather in Weimar or the Schwarzwald.3 I, for example,
sincerely despised my service employment, and if I didn’t go around
spitting, it was only out of necessity, because I was sitting there
getting money for it. The result being - you will note - that I still
didn’t go around spitting. Our romantic would sooner lose his mind
(which, however, happens very seldom) than start spitting, unless he’s
got his eye on some other career, and he will never be kicked out,
except perhaps that he might be carted off to the madhouse as “the king
of Spain,“4 and that only if he loses his mind very much. But among us
only the weaklings and • towheads lose their minds. While the countless
number of romantics go on to achieve considerable rank. Remarkable
versatility! And what capacity for the very most contradictory feelings!
I took comfort in that even then, and am of the same mind now. That is
why we have so many “broad natures“ who even with the ultimate fall
never lose their ideal; and though they wouldn’t lift a finger for their
ideal, though they are inveterate bandits and thieves, all the same they
respect their original ideal to the point of tears and are remarkably
honest in their souls. Yes, sirs, only among us can the most inveterate
scoundrel be perfectly and even loftily honest in his soul, while not
ceasing in the least to be a scoundrel. Time and again, I repeat, such
practical rogues come out of our romantics (I use the word “rogue“
lovingly); they suddenly display such a sense of reality and such
knowledge of the positive that the amazed authorities and public can
only stand dumbfounded, clucking their tongues at them.</p>
<p>The versatility is indeed amazing, and God knows what it</p>
<p>will turn and develop into in subsequent circumstances, and what it
promises us for our times to come. It’s not bad material, sirs! I don’t
say this out of any ridiculous or home-brewed patriotism. However, I’m
sure you again think I’m laughing. Or, who knows, maybe contrariwise -
that is, you’re quite sure I really think so. In any event, gentlemen, I
shall regard both your opinions as an honor and a special pleasure. And
do forgive me my digression.</p>
<p>Of course, I could not sustain this friendliness with my colleagues;
I’d spit in their eyes and, as a result of my still youthful
inexperience, even stop greeting them, as if I’d cut them off. However,
this happened to me only once. Generally, I was always alone.</p>
<p>At home, to begin with, I mainly used to read. I wished to stifle
with external sensations all that was ceaselessly boiling up inside me.
And among external sensations the only one possible for me was reading.
Reading was, of course, a great help - it stirred, delighted, and
tormented me. But at times it bored me terribly. I still wanted to move
about, and so I’d suddenly sink into some murky, subterranean, vile
debauch - not a great, but a measly little debauch. There were measly
little passions in me, sharp, burning, because of my permanent, morbid
irritability. I was given to hysterical outbursts, with tears and
convulsions. Apart from reading I had nowhere to turn - that is, there
was nothing I could then respect in my surroundings, nothing I would be
drawn to. What’s more, anguish kept boiling up; a hysterical thirst for
contradictions, contrasts, would appear, and so I’d set out on
debauchery. It is not at all to justify myself that I’ve been doing all
this talking… But no! that’s a lie! I precisely wanted to justify
myself. I make this little note for myself, gentlemen. I don’t want to
lie. I’ve given my word.</p>
<p>My debauchery I undertook solitarily, by night, covertly, fearfully,
filthily, with a shame that would not abandon me at the most loathsome
moments, and at such moments even went so far as a curse. I was then
already bearing the underground in my soul. I was terribly afraid of
somehow being seen, met, recognized. I used to frequent various rather
murky places.</p>
<p>Once, passing at night by some wretched little tavern, I saw through
the lighted window some gentlemen fighting with their cues around the
billiard table and one of them being chucked out the window. At another
time I would have been filled with loathing; but one of those moments
suddenly came over me, and I envied this chucked-out gentleman, envied
him so much that I even went into the tavern, into the billiard room:
“Perhaps I, too, will have a fight,“ I thought, “and get chucked out the
window myself.“</p>
<p>I was not drunk, but what do you want of me - anguish can eat a man
into such hysterics! But it came to nothing. I proved incapable even of
jumping out the window and left without having had any fight.</p>
<p>From the very first I was brought up short there by a certain
officer.</p>
<p>I was standing beside the billiard table, blocking the way
unwittingly, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and
silently - with no warning or explanation - moved me from where I stood
to another place, and then passed by as if without noticing. I could
even have forgiven a beating, but I simply could not forgive his moving
me and in the end just not noticing me.</p>
<p>Devil knows what I’d have given then for a real, more regular
quarrel, more decent, more, so to speak, literary! I had been treated
like a fly. This officer was a good six feet tall; and I am a short and
skinny man. The quarrel, however, was up to me: all I had to do was
protest a bit and, of course, I’d be chucked out the window. But I
changed my mind and preferred… to efface myself spitefully.</p>
<p>I left the tavern confused and agitated, went straight home, and the
next day continued my little debauch still more timidly, downtroddenly,
and sadly than before, as if with a tear in my eye - yet I did continue
it. Do not think, however, that I turned coward before the officer out
of cowardice: in my soul I have never been a coward, though I constantly
turned coward in reality, but - don’t laugh too quickly, there’s an
explanation for that; rest assured, I have an explanation for
everything.</p>
<p>Oh, if this officer had been one of those who would agree to fight a
duel! But no, he was precisely one of those gentlemen (alas, long since
vanished) who preferred to set about it with billiard cues, or, like
Lieutenant Pirogov in Gogol5 - by means of the authorities. But they
would not fight a duel, and in any case would regard a duel with our
sort, the pencil-pushers, as indecent - and they generally regarded
dueling as something inconceivable, freethinking, French, while giving
ample offense themselves, especially in cases of six-foot-tallness.</p>
<p>I turned coward not from cowardice, but from the most boundless
vanity. I was afraid, not of six-foot-tallness, nor of being badly
beaten and chucked out the window; I really would have had physical
courage enough; what I lacked was sufficient moral courage. I was afraid
that none of those present - from the insolent marker to the last putrid
and blackhead-covered clerk with a collar of lard who was hanging about
there -would understand, and that they would all deride me if I started
protesting and talking to them in literary language. Because among us to
this day it is impossible to speak of a point of honor - that is, not
honor, but a point of honor (point d’honneur) — otherwise than in
literary language. In ordinary language there is no mention of a “point
of honor.“ I was quite sure (what a sense of reality, despite all
romanticism!) that they would all simply burst with laughter, and the
officer would beat me, not simply, that is, inoffensively, but would
certainly start kicking me with his knee, driving me in this manner
around the billiard table, and only then perhaps have mercy and chuck me
out the window. Of course, for me this measly story could not end there.
Later I often met this officer in the street and made good note of him.
Only I don’t know whether he recognized me. Probably not; I conclude
that from certain signs. I, however, I - looked at him with spite and
hatred, and so it continued … for several years, sirs! My spite even
kept strengthening and burgeoning with the years. First I quietly began
finding things out about this officer. This was not easy for me, because
I had no acquaintances. But once someone called him by his surname in
the street while I was following him at a distance, as if tied</p>
<p>o him, and so I learned his surname. Another time I trailed him all
the way home, and for ten kopecks found out from the caretaker where he
lived, on what floor, alone or with someone, and so on - in short,
everything that can be learned from a caretaker. Then one morning,
though I had never literaturized, it suddenly came into my head to
describe this officer in the manner of an espose, as a caricature, in a
story. It was a delight to me to write this story. I esposed him, even
slandered him a bit; at first I distorted his surname in a way that made
it immediately recognizable, but then, on riper reflection, I changed it
and sent the story to Fatherland Notes. But there were no esposes yet,
and my story wasn’t published.6 I found this quite vexing. There were
times when I was simply choking with spite. In the end I decided to
challenge my adversary to a duel. I composed a beautiful, attractive
letter to him, entreating him to apologize to me; and hinted quite
strongly at a duel in case of refusal. The letter was composed in such a
way that if the officer had even the slightest notion of “the beautiful
and lofty,“ he could not fail to come running to me, to throw himself on
my neck and offer me his friendship. And that would be so nice! What a
life we would have, what a life! He would protect me with his dignity; I
would ennoble him with my development and, well… ideas, and there could
be so much of this or that! Imagine, by then it was already two years
since he had offended me, and my challenge was a most outrageous
anachronism, in spite of all the cleverness of my letter in explaining
away and concealing the anachronism. But, thank God (to this day I thank
the Almighty with tears), I did not send my letter. I go cold all over
when I recall what might have happened if I had sent it. And suddenly…
suddenly I got my revenge in the simplest, the most brilliant way! The
brightest i.e. suddenly dawned on me. Sometimes on holidays I would go
to Nevsky Prospect between three and four, and stroll along the sunny
side. That is, I by no means went strolling there, but experienced
countless torments, humiliations, and risings of bile; that must have
been just what I needed. I darted like an eel among the passers-by, in a
most uncomely fashion, ceaselessly giving way</p>
<p>now to generals, now to cavalry officers and hussars, now to ladies;
in those moments I felt convulsive pains in my heart and a hotness in my
spine at the mere thought of the measliness of my attire and the
measliness and triteness of my darting little figure. This was a torment
of torments, a ceaseless, unbearable humiliation from the thought, which
would turn into a ceaseless and immediate sensation, of my being a fly
before that whole world, a foul, obscene fly - more intelligent, more
developed, more noble than everyone else - that went without saying -
but a fly, ceaselessly giving way to everyone, humiliated by everyone,
insulted by everyone. Why I gathered this torment onto myself, why I
went to Nevsky - I don’t know, I was simply drawn there at every
opportunity.</p>
<p>I was then already beginning to experience the influxes of those
pleasures of which I have already spoken in the first chapter. And after
the story with the officer, I began to be drawn there even more
strongly: it was on Nevsky that I met him most often, it was there that
I admired him. He, too, used mostly to go there on holidays. And he,
too, swerved out of the way before generals and persons of dignity, and
he, too, slipped among them like an eel, but those of our sort, or even
better than our sort, he simply crushed; he went straight at them as if
there were an empty space before him, and on no occasion gave way to
them. I reveled in my spite as I watched him, and… each time spitefully
swerved out of his way. It tormented me that even in the street I simply
could not be on an equal footing with him. “Why is it invariably you who
swerve first?“ I kept nagging at myself, in furious hysterics, sometimes
waking up, say, between two and three in the morning. “Why precisely you
and not him? There’s no law that says so, it’s not written anywhere?
Well, then let it be equal, as is usual when men of delicacy meet: he
can yield by half, and you by half, and so you will pass mutually
respecting each other.“ But it was never so, and I still kept swerving,
and he did not even notice that I was giving way to him. And then a most
astonishing thought suddenly dawned on me. “What,“ I fancied, “what if I
meet him and… do not step aside? Deliberately do not step aside,
even</p>
<p>if I have to shove him - eh? how will that be?“ This bold thought
gradually took such possession of me that it left me no peace. I dreamed
of it ceaselessly, terribly, and deliberately went more often to Nevsky,
to picture more clearly how I was going to do it when I did it. I was in
ecstasy. The intention seemed more and more probable and possible to me.
“Not really to shove him, of course,“ I thought, growing kinder in
advance from joy, “but just so, simply not to give way, to bump into
him, not so very painfully, but so, shoulder against shoulder, only as
much as decency warrants, so that exactly as much as he bumps me, I will
also bump him.“ I was, finally, completely decided on it. But the
preparations took a very long time. First of all, at the time of the
performance one had to look as decent as possible and see to one’s
attire. “Just in case, supposing, for example, that a public incident
should get started (and the public there is superflu:7 a countess goes,
Prince D. goes, the whole of literature goes), one must be well dressed;
this makes an impression, and in some sense will put us straightaway on
an equal footing in the eyes of high society.“ To that end I asked for
an advance on my salary and bought black gloves and a respectable hat at
Churkin’s. Black gloves, it seemed to me, were both more imposing and
more in bon ton than the lemon-colored ones I had first presumed upon.
“The color is too striking, it’s too much as if a man wants to make a
show of himself,“ and I did not buy the lemon ones. I had long since
prepared a good shirt with white bone cufflinks; but I was very much
detained by the overcoat. My overcoat was not bad at all in itself, it
kept me warm; but it had a quilted cotton lining, and the collar was of
raccoon, which constituted the height of lackeydom. It was necessary to
change the collar at any cost and to acquire a beaver, something like
what officers wore. For that I began walking about the Gostiny Arcade8
and, after several attempts, set my sights on a cheap German beaver.
Though these German beavers wear out very quickly and acquire a most
measly look, at first, when new, they even seem quite decent; and I
needed it for only one time. I asked the price: it was expensive even
so. After some solid reflection I decided to sell</p>
<p>my raccoon collar. And the remaining and for me quite considerable
sum I decided to try and borrow from Anton Antonych Setochkin, my
department chief, a humble but serious and positive man, who never
loaned money to anyone, but to whom I had once, on entering my post,
been especially recommended by the important personage who had placed me
in the civil service. I was terribly tormented. To ask money of Anton
Antonych seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I even could not sleep for
two or three nights, but then I generally slept little at that time, I
was in a fever; my heart was somehow vaguely sinking, or else it would
suddenly start to go thump, thump, thump!… Anton Antonych was surprised
at first, then he frowned, then he considered, and after all he gave me
the loan, having me sign an authorization for him to take the loaned
money from my salary two weeks later. Thus everything was finally ready;
a handsome beaver came to reign in place of the squalid raccoon, and I
gradually began to get down to business. I really couldn’t just decide
it straight off, slapdash; the thing had to be handled deftly, precisely
gradually. But I confess that after many attempts I even began to
despair: we simply couldn’t bump into each other - and that was that!
After all my preparations, after all my premeditations - it would look
as if we were just about to bump into each other, and then - again I’d
give way, and he would pass by without noticing me. I even recited
prayers while approaching him, asking God to inspire me with
decisiveness. One time I was already quite decided, but it just ended
with me getting under his feet, because in the very last moment, at some
two inches away, I lost courage. He quite calmly walked over me, and I
bounced aside like a ball. That night I was sick again, feverish and
delirious. And suddenly everything ended in the best possible way. The
night before, I resolved finally not to carry out my pernicious
intention and to let it all go for naught, and with that purpose in mind
I went to Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I was going to let
it all go for naught. Suddenly, within three steps of my enemy, I
unexpectedly decided, closed my eyes, and - we bumped solidly shoulder
against shoulder! I did not yield an inch and</p>
<p>passed by on a perfectly equal footing! He did not even look back and
pretended not to notice: but he only pretended, I’m sure of that. To
this day I’m sure of it! Of course, I got the worst of if, he was
stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I had achieved
my purpose, preserved my dignity, yielded not a step, and placed myself
publicly on an equal social footing with him. I returned home perfectly
avenged for everything. I was in ecstasy. I exulted and sang Italian
arias. Of course, I shall not describe for you what happened to me three
days later; if you’ve read my first chapter, “Underground,“ you can
guess for yourself. The officer was later transferred somewhere. I
haven’t seen him for about fourteen years. What’s the sweet fellow doing
these days? Whom does he crush now?</p>
