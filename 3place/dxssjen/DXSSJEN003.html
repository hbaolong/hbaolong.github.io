<h4 id="ii">II</h4>
<p>I would now like to tell you, gentlemen, whether you do or do not
wish to hear it, why I never managed to become even an insect. I’ll tell
you solemnly that I wanted many times to become an insect. But I was not
deemed worthy even of that. I swear to you, gentlemen, that to be overly
conscious is a sickness, a real, thorough sickness. For man’s everyday
use, ordinary human consciousness would be more than enough; that is, a
half, a quarter of the portion that falls to the lot of a developed man
in our unfortunate nineteenth century, who, on top of that, has the
added misfortune of residing in Petersburg, the most abstract and
intentional city on the entire globe. (Cities can be intentional or
unintentional.) As much consciousness, for example, as that by which all
so-called ingenuous people and active figures live would be quite
enough. I’ll bet you think I’m writing all this out of swagger, to be
witty at the expense of active figures, and swagger of a bad tone
besides, rattling my sabre like my officer. But, gentlemen, who can take
pride in his sicknesses, and swagger about them besides?</p>
<p>Though - what am I saying? - everyone does it; it’s their sicknesses
that everyone takes pride in, and I, perhaps, more than anyone. Let us
not argue; my objection was absurd. But all the same I am strongly
convinced that not only too much consciousness but even any
consciousness at all is a sickness. I stand upon it. But let us also
leave that for a moment. Tell me this: why was it that, as if by design,
in those same, yes, in those very same moments when I was most capable
of being</p>
<p>conscious of all the refinements of “everything beautiful and
lofty,“3 as we once used to say, it happened that instead of being
conscious I did such unseemly deeds, such deeds as… well, in short, as
everyone does, perhaps, but which with me occurred, as if by design,
precisely when I was most conscious that I ought not to be doing them at
all? The more conscious I was of the good and of all this “beautiful and
lofty,“ the deeper I kept sinking into my mire, and the more capable I
was of getting completely stuck in it. But the main feature was that
this was all in me not as if by chance, but as if it had to be so. As if
it were my most normal condition and in no way a sickness or a blight,
so that finally I lost any wish to struggle against this blight. I ended
up almost believing (and maybe indeed believing) that this perhaps was
my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, how much torment I
endured in this struggle! I did not believe that such things happened to
others, and therefore kept it to myself all my life as a secret. I was
ashamed (maybe I am ashamed even now); it reached the point with me
where I would feel some secret, abnormal, mean little pleasure in
returning to my corner on some most nasty Petersburg night and being
highly conscious of having once again done a nasty thing that day, and
again that what had been done could in no way be undone, and I would
gnaw, gnaw at myself with my teeth, inwardly, secretly, tear and suck at
myself until the bitterness finally turned into some shameful, accursed
sweetness, and finally - into a decided, serious pleasure! Yes, a
pleasure, a pleasure! I stand upon it. The reason I’ve begun to speak is
that I keep wanting to find out for certain: do other people have such
pleasures? I’ll explain to you: the pleasure here lay precisely in the
too vivid consciousness of one’s own humiliation; in feeling that one
had reached the ultimate wall; that, bad as it is, it cannot be
otherwise; that there is no way out for you, that you will never change
into a different person; that even if you had enough time and faith left
to change yourself into something different, you probably would not wish
to change; and even if you did wish it, you would still not do anything,
because in fact there is perhaps nothing to change into. And
chiefly,</p>
<p>and finally, all this occurs according to the normal and basic laws
of heightened consciousness and the inertia that follows directly from
these laws, and consequently there is not only nothing you can do to
change yourself, but there is simply nothing to do at all. So it turns
out, for example, as a result of heightened consciousness: right, you’re
a scoundrel - as if it were a consolation for the scoundrel himself to
feel that he is indeed a scoundrel. But enough… Eh, I’ve poured all that
out, and what have I explained?… How explain this pleasure? But I will
explain myself! I will carry through to the end! That is why I took a
pen in my hands …</p>
<p>I have, for example, a terrible amour propre. I am as insecure and
touchy as a hunchback or a dwarf, yet there have indeed been moments
when if I had happened to be slapped, I might even have been glad of it.
I say it seriously: surely I’d have managed to discover some sort of
pleasure in that as well - the pleasure of despair, of course, but it is
in despair that the most burning pleasures occur, especially when one is
all too highly conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position. And
here, with this slap - you’ll simply be crushed by the consciousness of
what sort of slime you’ve been reduced to. But chiefly, however you
shuffle, it still comes out that I always come out as the first to blame
for everything and, what’s most offensive, blamelessly to blame,
according to the laws of nature, so to speak. I’m to blame, first,
because I’m more intelligent than everyone around me. (I’ve always
considered myself more intelligent than everyone around me, and, would
you believe, have even felt slightly ashamed of it. At least I’ve
somehow averted my eyes all my life, and never could look people
straight in the face.) I’m to blame, finally, because even if there were
any magnanimity in me, I would be the one most tormented by the
consciousness of its utter futility. For I would surely be able to do
nothing with my magnanimity: neither to forgive, because my offender
might have hit me according to the laws of nature, and the laws of
nature cannot be forgiven; nor to forget, because even though it’s the
laws of nature, it’s still offensive. Finally, even if I should want to
be altogether unmagnanimous, if, on the contrary,</p>
<p>I should wish to take revenge on my offender, I wouldn’t be able to
take revenge on anyone in any way, because I surely wouldn’t dare to do
anything even if I could. Why wouldn’t I dare? About that I would like
to say a couple of words in particular.</p>
