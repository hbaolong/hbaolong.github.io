<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>The ellipsis after the opening sentence of Notes from Underground is
like a window affording us a first glimpse of one of the most remarkable
characters in literature, one who has been placed among the bearers of
modern consciousness alongside Don Quixote, Hamlet, and Faust. What we
see is a man glancing at us out of the corner of his eye, very much
aware of us as he speaks, very much concerned with the impression his
words are making. In fact, we do not really see him, we only hear him,
and not through anything so respectable as a window, but through a crack
in the floorboards. He addresses the world from that crack; he has also
spent a lifetime listening at it. Everything that can be said about him,
and more particularly against him, he already knows; he has, as he says
in a typical paradox, overheard it all, anticipated it all, invented it
all. “I am a sick man … I am a wicked man.“ In the space of that pause
Dostoevsky introduces the unifying i.e. of his tale: the instability,
the perpetual “dialectic“ of isolated consciousness. The nameless hero -
nameless “because T is all of us,“ the critic Viktor Shklovsky suggested
— is, like so many of Dostoevsky’s heroes, a writer. Not a professional
man of letters (none of Dostoevsky’s “writers“ is that), but one whom
circumstances have led or forced to take up the pen, to try to fix
something in words, for his own sake first of all, but also with an eye
for some indeterminate others — readers, critics, judges, fellow
creatures. He is a passionate amateur, a condition that marks the style
and structure as well as the content of the book. Where the master
practitioner would present us with a seamless and harmonious verbal
construction, the man from underground, who literally cannot contain
himself, breaks decorum all the time, interrupts himself, comments on
his own intentions, defies his readers, polemicizes with other writers.
The literariness of his “notes“ and the unliterariness of his style are
both results of his “heightened consciousness,“ his hostility to and
dependence upon the words of others. Thus the unifying i.e. of Notes
from Underground, embodied in he person of its narrator, is dramatized
in the process of its writing. The controlling art of Dostoevsky remains
at a second remove.</p>

</ul>
<p>This man who may be trying to write his way out of the underground,
originally read his way into it. “At home,“ he says, “I mainly used to
read. I wished to stifle with external sensations all that was
ceaselessly boiling up inside me. And among external sensations the only
one possible for me was reading. Reading was, of course, a great help -
it stirred, delighted, and tormented me.“ That was during his youth, in
the 1840s. He read, he dreamed, and he engaged in “little debauches.“
These were his three diversions, and it is interesting that he puts them
together. What did he read? At various points in his account he compares
himself with Byron’s Manfred, with characters from Pushkin and Lermontov
— all romantic figures. He refers more than once to Rousseau. Farther in
the background, but looming large, stand Kant and Schiller, representing
German philosophical and poetic idealism, summoned up in the phrase “the
beautiful and lofty,“ which had become a commonplace of Russian liberal
criticism of the 1840s. His reading was, in other words, that of the
typical educated Russian of the time. Reading nourished his dreaming,
and even found its way into his little debauches “in exactly the
proportion required for a good sauce.“ And so it was that he evaded the
petty squalor and inner anguish of his daily life; so it was, as he
confesses sixteen years later, that he “defaulted on his life through
moral corruption in a corner.“ One main thematic strand of the book is
the underground man’s denunciation of the estranging and vitiating
influence of books, so that from his perspective of the 1860s, when he
begins to write, the word “literary“ has become one of the most
sarcastic he can utter. To all the features for an antihero purposely
collected in Motes from Underground there are added all the features for
an antibook.</p>
<p>That book is the underground man’s book, not Dostoevsky’s, though the
two coincide almost word for word. Indeed, the sharp personality of the
underground man, the intensity of his attacks and confessions, the
apparent lack of critical distance in the first person narrative, have
given many readers</p>
<p>he impression that they have to do here with a direct statement of
Dostoevsky’s own ideological position, and much commentary has been
written on the book in that light. Much has also been said about the
tragic (or at least “terribly sad“) essence of its vision. Both notions
seem to overlook the humor</p>
<ul>
<li>stylistic, situational, polemical, parodic - that pervades Notes
from Underground. Dostoevsky certainly put a lot of himself into</li>
</ul>
<p>he situations and emotions of his narrator; what distinguishes his
book from the narrator’s is an extra dimension of laughter. Laughter
creates the distance that allows for recognition, without which the book
might be a tract, a case history, a cry of despair, anything you like,
but not a work of art. Notes from Underground has been called the
prelude to the great novels of Dostoevsky’s last period, and it is so
partly because here Dostoevsky first perfected the method of tonal
distancing that enabled him to present characters and events
simultaneously from different points of view, to counter empathy with
intellection.</p>
<p>The underground man’s book is a personal outpouring</p>
<ul>
<li>harsh, self-accusatory, defiant, negligently written, loosely
structured - a long diatribe, followed by some avowedly random
recollections (“I will not introduce any order or system. Whatever I
recall, I will write down.“) It claims to be genuine, if artistically
crude. “No longer literature, but corrective punishment,“ the narrator
finally decides. Nietzsche thought he could hear “the voice of the
blood“ in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dostoevsky’s novel is something quite different. It is a tragicomedy
of ideas, admirable for the dramatic expressiveness of its prose, which
gives subtle life to this voice from under the floorboards with all its
withholdings, second thoughts, loopholes, special pleadings; and
admirable, too, for the dynamics of its composition, the interplay of
its two parts, which represent two historical moments, two “climates of
opinion,“ as well as two images of the man from underground, revealed by
different means and with very different tonalities.</p>
<p>The two parts of Notes from Underground were first published in 1864,
in the January and April issues of Epoch, a magazine edited by
Dostoevsky’s brother Mikhail, the successor to their magazine Time,
which had been suppressed by the censors in</p>
<ol start="1863" type="1">
<li>The note Dostoevsky added to the first part insists on the social
and typical, as opposed to personal and psychological, aspects of the
man from underground: “such persons as the writer of such notes not only
may but even must exist in our society, taking into consideration the
circumstances under which our society has generally been formed.“ His
view of those circumstances would have been familiar to readers of his
articles in Time over the previous few years, particularly “Winter Notes
on Summer Impressions,“ an account of his first trip to Europe in 1862,
which had appeared in the February and March issues of Time for 1863.
There he discussed Russia’s “captivation“ with the West:</li>
</ol>
<p>Why, everything, unquestionably almost everything that we have -of
development, science, art, civic-mindedness, humanity, everything,
everything comes from there - from that same land of holy wonders! Why,
our entire life, even from very childhood itself, has been set up along
European lines.</p>
<p>Russian society had been formed by decades of imported “development“
and “enlightenment,“ words that acquire a sharply ironic inflection in
Dostoevsky’s later work. Some sources of this ideology have already been
mentioned - Rousseau, Schiller, Kant. To this list may be added the
names of such French social romantics as Victor Hugo, Eugene Sue, George
Sand, and the Utopian socialists Fourier and Saint-Simon. In Dostoevsky:
The Stir of Liberation, Joseph Frank points to the presence of these
“influences“ in the theme of the redeemed prostitute, which was a
favorite among Russian liberals of the 1840s (the poet Nikolai Nekrasov,
for example), and which Dostoevsky parodies brilliantly in the second
part of Notes from Underground. The parody is, of course, Dostoevsky’s,
not the underground man’s. The latter, on the contrary, had taken all
these influences to heart; they had made him into a “developed man of
the nineteenth century,“ a man of “heightened consciousness.“ It was the
attempt to live by them that drove him “underground.“ In the social
displacement of an imported culture, Dostoevsky perceived a more
profound human displacement, a spiritual void filled with foreign
content.</p>
<p>A second theme from “Winter Notes“ reappears in Motes from
Underground - that of the “crystal palace,“ which is as central to the
polemics of the novel’s first part as the redeemed prostitute is to the
parody of the second. The crystal palace in the travel article is the
cast-iron and glass exhibition hall built in London in 1851 for the
Great Exhibition. It appeared to Dostoevsky as a terrifying structure, a
symbol of false unity, of “the full triumph of Baal, the ultimate
organization of an anthill.“ The tones in which he speaks of it will be
echoed almost twenty years later by the Grand Inquisitor in The Brothers
Karamazov:</p>
<p>But if you saw how proud is that mighty spirit who created this
colossal setting and how proudly convinced this spirit is of its victory
and of its triumph, then you would shudder for its pride, obstinacy, and
blindness, but you would shudder also for those over whom this proud
spirit hovers and reigns.</p>
<p>This mighty spirit is the spirit of industrial capitalism, and the
crystal palace is its temple. In Motes from Underground the same
structure comes to stand for the future organization of socialism. It
remains an image of false unity, but is denounced in rather different
terms: the underground man puts his tongue out at it, calls it a
tenement house and a chicken coop.</p>
<p>The two time periods of the novel represent two stages in the
evolution of the Russian intelligentsia: the sentimental, literary 1840s
and the rational and utilitarian 1860s; the time of the liberals and the
time of the nihilists. One of Dostoevsky’s constant preoccupations in
his later work was the responsibility of the liberal generation for the
emergence of the nihilists, an i.e. he embodied literally in the novel
Demons (1871-72) in the figures of the dreamy individualist Stepan
Verkhovensky and his deadly utilitarian son Pyotr. In Motes from
Underground the same evolution is reflected in the mind of one man: the
polemicist of the first part grew out of the defeated dreamer of the
second. The inverted time sequence of the two parts seems to lead us to
this discovery.</p>
<p>However, the underground man is hardly a typical “rational egoist,“
any more than he had been a typical romantic. There is a quality in him
that sets him apart, which he himself</p>
<p>defines on the last page of the book: “Excuse me, gentlemen, but I am
not justifying myself with this allishness. As far as I myself am
concerned, I have merely carried to an extreme in my life what you have
not dared to carry even halfway.“ Submitted to the testing of full
acceptance, the testing of this irreducible human existence, the
“heightened consciousness“ of the rationalist, like the sentimental
impulses of the romantic, runs into disastrous and comic reversals.
Hence the paradoxically defiant double-mindedness of the underground
man, and his intransitive dilemma.</p>
<p>The “gentlemen“ he addresses throughout his notes, when they are not
a more indeterminate “you,“ are typical intellectuals of the 1860s. More
specifically, they are presumed to be followers of the writer Nikolai
Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky, the chief spokesman and ideologist of the
young radicals. N. G. Chernyshevsky was the author of a number of
critical works, notably The Anthropological Principle in Philosophy
(1860), in which he propounded the abovementioned doctrine of “rational
egoism,“ an adaptation of the “enlightened self-interest“ of the English
utilitarians. His programmatic Utopian novel What Is to Be Done?,
written in prison following his arrest in 1862 for revolutionary
activities and published in 1863, immediately became a manual for social
activists. Several decades later, V. I. Lenin, who dubbed Dostoevsky a
“superlatively bad“ writer, could testify that What Is to Be Done? had
made him into a confirmed revolutionary. The nature of Chernyshevsky’s
hero and his ideas may be deduced from the following passage:</p>
<p>Yes, I will always do what I want. I will never sacrifice anything,
not even a whim, for the sake of something I do not desire. What I want,
with all my heart, is to make people happy. In this lies my happiness.
Mine! Can you hear that, you, in your underground hole?</p>
<p>This is the voice of the healthy rational egoist, the ingenuous man
of action. Dostoevsky took up the challenge.</p>
<p>Though Chernyshevsky is not mentioned by name in Motes from
Underground, his theories, and in particular his novel, are the most
immediate targets both of the underground man’s diatribes and of
Dostoevsky’s subtler, more penetrating parody. Dostoevsky had intended
originally to write a critical review</p>
<p>of What Is to Be Done? for the first issue of Epoch, but was unable
to produce anything. The strained conditions of his personal life at
that time and the problems of starting the new magazine do not explain
the difficulty he faced. Evidently it was not enough for him simply to
counter Chernyshevsky’s arguments; more was at stake than a conflict of
ideas — there was a question of the very nature of the human being who
was to be so forcibly made happy. Dostoevsky’s response had to take
artistic form. He was challenged to reveal “the man in man,“ precisely
in and through the ideas of the new radicals themselves.</p>
<p>The counterarguments of the “gentlemen“ in the later chapters of the
first part, for example, are clearly Chernyshevskian, based on his
notions of normal interests, natural law, and the denial of free will.
The crystal palace, too, in its reappearance here, has been transmuted
by its passage through “The Fourth Dream of Vera Pavlovna,“ the section
of What Is to Be Done? that presents Chernyshevsky’s vision of mankind
made happy. The pseudoscientific terms and even a certain clumsy use of
parentheses, as Joseph Frank has shown, are the narrator’s deliberate
mockery of Chernyshevsky’s writing. Frank has also shown that the attack
is not limited to Part One: two of the three main episodes in the second
part of Notes — the episode of the bumped officer and the episode with
the prostitute Liza - are in fact parodic developments of episodes from
Chernyshevsky’s novel. The latter episode, which is the climactic
episode of the novel as a whole, gives fullest play to Dostoevsky’s
criticism through comic reversal. But the reversal is not a simple
contrary; it is the puncturing of a literary cliche by a truth drawn
from a different source, from what the narrator comes in the end to call
“living life.“</p>
<p>Dostoevsky’s reply to Chernyshevsky is both ideological and artistic,
the implication being that the two are inseparable, and the further
implication being that the indispensable unity of artistic form reflects
a more primordial unity of the living person. Those who favored
Chernyshevsky’s ideas, however, were able to separate them from the form
of their expression. Even the conscientious old radical Alexander
Herzen, though he found Chernyshevsky’s novel “vilely written“ and
could</p>
<p>not help noting that it ends with “a phalanstery in a brothel,“
immediately added: “On the other hand there is much that is good and
healthy.“ (An interesting pair of adjectives when one recalls the
opening lines of Motes.) These remarks of Herzen’s are passed on to us
by Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, the narrator of Vladimir Nabokov’s The
Gift (1938), whose monograph on the life of Chernyshevsky makes up the
fourth of the novel’s five chapters. Godunov-Cherdyntsev notes a certain
“fatal inner contradiction“ in Chernyshevsky’s own reflections on art,
what he describes as</p>
<p>he dualism of the monist Chernyshevsky’s aesthetics - where “form“
and “content“ are distinct, with “content“ pre-eminent - or, more
exactly, with “form“ playing the role of the soul and “content“ the role
of the body; and the muddle is augmented by the fact that this “soul“
consists of mechanical components, since Chernyshevsky believed that the
value of a work was not a qualitative but a quantitative concept, and
that “if someone were to take some miserable, forgotten novel and
carefully cull all its flashes of observation, he would collect a fair
number of sentences that would not differ in worth from those
constituting the pages of works we admire.“</p>
<p>Indeed, there could hardly be a more thorough denial of artistic
unity than this last quoted passage. The naive blithe-ness of its
expression is characteristic of Chernyshevsky and thinkers like him
(utilitarians, nihilists; then Lenin, Lunachar-sky, the theorists of
“socialist realism“). It is defined by Nabokov’s narrator in terms of a
decomposition of the human person. The metaphor comes quite naturally;
the aesthetic question immediately brings with it the human question -
or, rather, they are the same.</p>
<p>As a writer and thinker, Chernyshevsky was the embodiment of what in
Russian is called bezdarnost’ - giftlessness - and was thus the perfect
foil for that minutely observant, wondering, grateful, and
form-revealing intelligence that Nabokov celebrates in The Gift.
Giftlessness, as Dostoevsky feared and Nabokov knew, became the dominant
style in Russia; it eventually seized power, and in the process of
“making people happy“ destroyed them by millions, leaving its vast
motherland broken and desolate. “The triumph of materialism has
abolished matter,“ the poet Andrei Bely said in the famine—</p>
<p>ridden 1920s. Godunov-Cherdyntsev gives a more detailed
formulation:</p>
<p>Our overall impression is that materialists of this type fell into a
fatal error: neglecting the nature of the thing itself, they kept
applying their most materialistic method merely to the relations between
objects, to the void between objects and not to the objects themselves;
i.e. they were the naivest metaphysicians precisely at that point where
they most wanted to be standing on the ground.</p>
<p>A fatal error, a fatal contradiction. In this respect the greatest
foresight was shown by long-eared Shigalyov, the radical theoretician in
Dostoevsky’s Demons: “I got entangled in my own data, and my conclusion
directly contradicts the original i.e. I start from. Starting from
unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism. I will add,
however, that apart from my solution to the social formula, there is no
other.“ A direct line leads from metaphysical naivety to murder; a
direct line leads from the anti-unity of utilitarian aesthetics to the
false unity of the crystal palace. Dostoevsky perceived these relations
more clearly than anyone else of his time. The perception coincided
with, and in fact constituted, the maturity of his genius. He recognized
that his opposition to the “Chernyshev-skians“ could not be a struggle
for domination, that what was in question was the complex reality of the
human being, the whole person, the “thing itself,“ and that a true
articulation of that reality could only come as the final “gift“ of an
artistic image. Mikhail Bakhtin noted in his study of Dostoevsky’s
poetics: “Artistic form, correctly understood, does not shape already
prepared and found content, but rather permits content to be found and
seen for the first time.“</p>
<p>Hence the formal inventiveness of Notes from Underground: its
striking language, unlike any literary prose ever written; its multiple
and conflicting tonalities; the oddity of its reversed structure, which
seems random but all at once reveals its deeper coherence - “chatter …
resolved by an unexpected catastrophe,“ as Dostoevsky described it to
his brother. (“All Dostoevsky’s novels were written for the sake of the
catastrophe,“ the critic Konstantin Mochulsky observed. “This is the law
of the new ‘expressive art’ that he created. Only upon</p>
<p>arriving at the finale do we understand the composition’s perfection
and the inexhaustible depth of its design.“) The catastrophe that
resolves Notes from Underground, with its resoundingly symbolic slamming
door, is at the same time the moment of its origin. There, in a sudden
confusion of tenses, the narrator cries out from the past into the
future: “and never, never will I recall this moment with indifference.“
It is a fleeting moment, but it has determined the narrator’s life and
gives the e.g. of passion to his attack, his outburst, after all his
years “underground.“ Coming at the end of the book, it sends us back to
the beginning; thus the round of the underground man’s ruminations is
given form, and this whole “image“ Dostoevsky holds up to us as a
sign.</p>
<p>There may, however, have been a more directly opposing i.e. in the
book as Dostoevsky originally wrote it, a sort of ideological climax in
Part One to match the narrative climax in Part Two. When the first part
appeared in Epoch, Dostoevsky complained in a letter to his brother that
the tenth chapter -“the most important one, where the essential thought
is expressed“ - had been drastically cut by the censors. “Where I mocked
at everything and sometimes blasphemed for form’s sake - that is let
pass; but where from all this I deduced the need of faith and Christ -
that is suppressed.“</p>
<p>The published version of the chapter, according to its author, was
left “full of self-contradictions.“ Indeed, the reader will notice that
in the third paragraph the “crystal edifice“ ceases all at once to
represent the ideas of the narrator’s opponents and becomes instead
something that he himself has possibly invented “as a result of certain
old nonrational habits of our generation,“ something, he says, that
“exists in my desires, or, better, exists as long as my desires exist.“
Obviously there have been major cuts here, removing the transition from
one crystal edifice to the other - the word “mansion“ being left us as a
clue to its nature. We must try to imagine what would have transformed
the “chicken coop“ into a mansion, what would have made it more than “a
phalanstery in a brothel,“ what would have turned it from an embodiment
of the “laws of nature“ into a contradiction of those very laws, and how
from all this “the need of faith and Christ“ was</p>
<p>deduced. Dostoevsky never restored the cuts, as he never restored
similarly drastic cuts in Crime and Punishment and Demons. Various
explanations have been offered for this circumstance, some practical
(lack of time, reluctance to confront the censors), others aesthetic (a
recognition that the cuts were improvements). We do not know. But if we
look at Dostoevsky’s outlines of his ideas for novels in his notebooks
and letters and then at the novels themselves, we will realize at least
that the scheme barely hints at the surprises of its development.
However it was that Dostoevsky “deduced the need for faith and Christ“
in this chapter, we may be sure that he did not add it on as an external
“ideological“ precept, but drew it from the materials of the work
itself.</p>
<p>The man from underground refutes his opponents with the results of
having carried their own ideas to an extreme in his life. These results
are himself. This self, however, as the reader discovers at once, is not
a monolithic personality, but an inner plurality in constant motion. The
plurality of the person, without any ideological additions, is already a
refutation of l’homme de la nature et de la verite, the healthy,
undivided man of action who was both the instrument and the object of
radical social theory. Unity is not singularity but wholeness, a holding
together, a harmony, all of which imply plurality. What the principle of
this harmony is, the underground man cannot say; he has never found it.
But he knows he has not found it; he knows, because his inner
disharmony, his dividedness, which is the source of his suffering, is
also the source of consciousness. Here we come upon one of the deep
springs of Dostoevsky’s later work - not his thinking (Dostoevsky was
not a thinker, or, rather, he was a plurality of thinkers), but his
artistic embodiment of reality. The one quality his negative characters
share, and almost the only negative his world view allows, is inner
fixity, a sort of death-in-life, which can take many forms and
tonalities, from the broadly comic to the tragic, from the mechanical to
the corpselike, from Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin to Nikolai Stavrogin. Inner
movement, on the other hand, is always a condition of spiritual good,
though it may also be a source of suffering, division, disharmony, in
this life. What moves may always rise. Dostoevsky never</p>
<p>portrays the completion of this movement; it extends beyond the end
of the given book. We see it in characters like Raskolnikov and Mitya
Karamazov, but first of all in the man from underground.</p>

<p>How much the mere tone of Notes from Underground is worth!</p>
<p>LEV SHESTOV</p>
<p>The philosopher Shestov, the critic Mochulsky, and most Russian
readers agree that the style of Notes from Underground is, in Shestov’s
words, “very strange.“ Bakhtin describes it as “deliberately clumsy,“
though “subject to a certain artistic logic.“ A detailed discussion of
the matter is not possible here, but we can offer a few comments on the
style of our translation, pointing to qualities in the original that we
have sought to keep in English for the sake of “mere tone,“ where they
have been lost in earlier translations.</p>
<p>Though he likes to philosophize, the underground man has no use for
philosophical terminology. When he picks up such words, it is to make
fun of them; otherwise he couches his thought in the most blunt and even
crude terms. An example is his use of the rare word khoteniye, a verbal
noun formed from khotet’, “to want.“ It is a simple, elemental word,
with an almost physical, appetitive immediacy. The English equivalent is
“wanting,“ which is how we have translated it. The primitive quality of
the word appears to have alarmed our predecessors, who translate it as
“wishing,“ “desire,“ “will,“ “intention,“ “choice,“ “volition,“ and
render it variously at various times. The underground man invariably
says “wanting“ and “to want.“ He plays on the different uses of the word
(“Who wants to want according to a little table?“); there is one passage
running from the end of Chapter VII to the start of Chapter VIII in the
first part where “want“ and “wanting“ appear eighteen times in two
paragraphs - the stylistic point of which is blunted when other words
are used.</p>
<p>Another of the underground man’s words is vygoda, which means
“profit“ (gain, benefit), and only secondarily “advantage,“ as it is
most often translated. “Profit“ has very nearly the same range of uses
in English as vygoda has in Russian. It is also a direct, unambiguous
word, with an almost tactile quality: you have an advantage, but you get
a profit. And like vygoda, with its strongly accented first syllable,
“profit“ leaps from the mouth almost with the force of an expletive,
quite unlike the more unctuous “advantage“ or its Russian equivalent
preimushchestvo. Again, the narrator insists on his word and plays with
it. Thus we arrive at the full music of this underground oratorio:</p>
<p>And where did all these sages get the i.e. that man needs some
normal, some virtuous wanting? What made them necessarily imagine that
what man needs is necessarily a reasonably profitable wanting? Man needs
only independent wanting, whatever this independence may cost and
wherever it may lead.</p>
<p>Repetition is of the essence here. When the underground man speaks of
consciousness and heightened consciousness, it is always the same word:
“consciousness,“ not “intellectual activity“ as one translator has it,
not “awareness“ as another offers, and never some mixture of the three.
The editorial precept of avoiding repetitions, of gracefully varying
one’s vocabulary, cannot be applied to this writer. His writing is
emphatic, heavy-handed, rude: “This is my wanting, this is my desire.
You will scrape it out of me only when you change my desires.“ To
translate the scullery verb vyskoblit’ (“to scrape out“) as “eradicate“
or “expunge,“ as has been done, to exchange the “collar of lard“ the
narrator bestows on the wretched clerk in Part Two for one that is
merely “greasy,“ is to chasten and thus distort the voice of this man
who is nothing but a voice.</p>
<p>There is, however, one tradition of mistranslation attached to Motes
from Underground that raises something more than a question of “mere
tone.“ The second sentence of the book, Ya zloy chelovek, has most often
been rendered as “I am a spiteful man.“ Zloy is indeed at the root of
the Russian word for “spiteful“ (zlobnyi), but it is a much broader and
deeper word, meaning “wicked,“ “bad,“ “evil.“ The wicked witch in
Russian folktales is zlaya ved’ma (zlaya being the feminine of</p>
<p>zloy). The opposite of zloy is dobryi, “good,“ as in “good fairy“
(dobraya feya). This opposition is of great importance for Notes from
Underground; indeed it frames the book, from “I am a wicked man“ at the
start to the outburst close to the end: “They won’t let me … I can’t be
… good!“ We can talk forever about the inevitable loss of nuances in
translating from Russian into English (or from any language into any
other), but the translation of zloy as “spiteful“ instead of “wicked“ is
not inevitable, nor is it a matter of nuance. It speaks for that habit
of substituting the psychological for the moral, of interpreting a
spiritual condition as a kind of behavior, which has so bedeviled our
century, not least in its efforts to understand Dostoevsky. Besides,
“wicked“ has the lucky gift of picking up the internal rhyme in the
first two sentences of the original.</p>
