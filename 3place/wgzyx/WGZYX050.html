Fraser-Tytler has a more complimentary view of his reign. W. K.
Fraser-Tytler, Afghanistan: A Study of Political Developments in Central
and South Asia (London: Oxford University Press, 1950), 127.</p>
<p>第4章</p>
<p>1．The phrase appears in The Wealth of Nations, bk. 4, chap. 7,
pt. 3. Smith actually qualifies the description by describing England as
“a nation whose government is influenced by shopkeepers.” The book can
be found at
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#2HCH0027.</p>

<p>2．Jules Stewart, Crimson Snow: Britain’s First Disaster in
Afghanistan (Gloucestershire: Sutton Press, 2008), 78, refers to eight
hundred wives. Lady Florentia Sale, in her A Journal of the Disasters in
Afghanistan (Franklin, TN: Tantallon Press, 2002; originally published
in 1843), 48, refers to the king’ s womenfolk, including wives,
daughters, and serving maids, as numbering in the eight hundreds.</p>
<p>3．Mohan Lal, Hindu interpreter for the British, reported this
information but didn’t mention the woman’s name. His report was quoted

<p>8．Fraser-Tytler, Afghanistan, 114.</p>
<p>9．I found this diary on the Internet, but unfortunately it has
vanished now. I am, however, amused to see that the phrase
“frighteningly willing” made its way into the Afghan Chamber of
Commerce’s account of the First Anglo-Afghan war here: http://www.
afghanchamber.com/history/englishinvation.htm. They must have seen the
same diary as I.</p>

<p>2．When Mao Tse-tung invented the term “Third World,” he meant to
label the Soviet Union and the United States together the “first world,”
the developed second-tier powers such as France and Germany the “second
world,” and all the undeveloped countries, including China, the third
world. In common usage, First World came to mean the Capitalist West,
Second World the Soviet-led Communist countries, and Third World
everybody else. The exact meaning of the terms has remained
ambiguous.</p>

<p>1．In the nationwide speech delivered on July 15, 1979, Carter used
the phrase “crisis of confidence,” but his advisor Patrick Caddell had
used the word “malaise” in his memo to Carter about the address, which
became known ever after as Carter’s “malaise” speech.</p>
<p>2．Reagan first evoked the phrase in a speech to the National
Association of Evangelicals, March 8, 1983, in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>3．If you don’t believe me, just Google “Gorbachev, birthmark,
anti-Christ.”</p>
<p>4．Nixon used variations of this phrase in his campaign speeches
leading to the presidential election of 1972 and explicitly in a speech
on January 23, 1973, describing the Paris Peace Accords his negotiators
had just signed with the North Vietnamese.</p>

<p>8．Department of Defense
(http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45404) official count

(http://articles.cnn.com/2003-04-17/world/sprj.irq.casualties_1_combat-deathscasualties-coalition-deaths?_s=PM:WORLD)
set total coalition casualties at 358.For casualties on the Iraqi side,
see http://www.cryan. com/war/AlliedForces .html. The accuracy of this
count is open to discussion since official US Defense Department sources
avoid estimating Iraqi casualties, as discussed by John Heidenrich, “The
Gulf War: How Many Iraqis Died?” Foreign Policy, no. 90 (Spring 1993):
108–125.</p>
