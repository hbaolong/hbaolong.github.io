<h4 id="plotinus">30 PLOTINUS</h4>
<p>Plotinus (A.D. 204–70), the founder of Neoplatonism, is the last of
the great philosophers of antiquity. His life is almost co-extensive
with one of the most disastrous periods in Roman history. Shortly before
his birth, the army had become conscious of its power, and had adopted
the practice of choosing emperors in return for monetary rewards, and
assassinating them afterwards to give occasion for a renewed sale of the
empire. These preoccupations unfitted the soldiers for the defence of
the frontier, and permitted vigorous incursions of Germans from the
north and Persians from the East. War and pestilence diminished the
population of the empire by about a third, while increased taxation and
diminished resources caused financial ruin in even those provinces to
which no hostile forces penetrated. The cities, which had been the
bearers of culture, were especially hard hit; substantial citizens, in
large numbers, fled to escape the tax-collector. It was not till after
the death of Plotinus that order was re-established and the empire
temporarily saved by the vigorous measures of Diocletian and
Constantine.</p>
<p>Of all this there is no mention in the works of Plotinus. He turned
aside from the spectacle of ruin and misery in the actual world, to
contemplate an eternal world of goodness and beauty. In this he was in
harmony with all the most serious men of his age. To all of them,
Christians and pagans alike, the world of practical affairs seemed to
offer no hope, and only the Other World seemed worthy of allegiance. To
the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be enjoyed
after death; to the Platonist, it was the eternal world of ideas, the
real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance. Christian
theologians combined these points of view, and embodied much of the
philosophy of Plotinus. Dean Inge, in his invaluable book on Plotinus,
rightly emphasizes what Christianity owes to him. ‘Platonism,’ he says,
‘is part of the vital structure of Christian theology, with which no
other philosophy, I venture to say, can work without friction.’ There
is, he says, an ‘utter impossibility of excising Platonism from
Christianity without tearing Christianity to pieces’. He points out that
Saint Augustine speaks of Plato’s system as ‘the most pure and bright in
all philosophy’, and of Plotinus as a man in whom ‘Plato lived again’,
and who, if he had lived a little later, would have ‘changed a few words
and phrases and become Christian’. Saint Thomas Aquinas, according to
Dean Inge, ‘is nearer to Plotinus than to the real Aristotle’.</p>
<p>Plotinus, accordingly, is historically important as an influence in
moulding the Christianity of the Middle Ages and of Catholic theology.
The historian, in speaking of Christianity, has to be careful to
recognize the very great changes that it has undergone, and the variety
of forms that it may assume even at one epoch. The Christianity of the
Synoptic Gospels is almost innocent of metaphysics. The Christianity of
modern America, in this respect, is like primitive Christianity;
Platonism is alien in popular thought and feeling in the United States,
and most American Christians are much more concerned with duties here on
earth, and with social progress in the everyday world, than with the
transcendental hopes that consoled men when everything terrestrial
inspired despair. I am not speaking of any change of dogma, but of a
difference of emphasis and interest. A modern Christian, unless he
realizes how great this difference is, will fail to understand the
Christianity of the past. We, since our study is historical, are
concerned with the effective beliefs of past centuries, and as to these
it is impossible to disagree with what Dean Inge says on the influence
of Plato and Plotinus.</p>
<p>Plotinus, however, is not only historically important. He represents,
better than any other philosopher, an important type of theory. A
philosophical system may be judged important for various different kinds
of reasons. The first and most obvious is that we think it may be true.
Not many students of philosophy at the present time would feel this
about Plotinus; Dean Inge is, in this respect, a rare exception. But
truth is not the only merit that a metaphysic can possess. It may have
beauty, and this is certainly to be found in Plotinus; there are
passages that remind one of the later cantos of Dante’s Paradiso, and of
almost nothing else in literature. Now and again, his descriptions of
the eternal world of glory</p>
<p>To our high-wrought fantasy present</p>
<p>That undisturbed song of pure concent</p>
<p>Aye sung before the sapphire-coloured throne</p>
<p>To Him that sits thereon.</p>
<p>Again, a philosophy may be important because it expresses well what
men are prone to believe in certain moods or in certain circumstances.
Uncomplicated joy and sorrow is not matter for philosophy, but rather
for the simpler kinds of poetry and music. Only joy and sorrow
accompanied by reflection on the universe generate metaphysical
theories. A man may be a cheerful pessimist or a melancholy optimist.
Perhaps Samuel Butler may serve as an example of the first; Plotinus is
an admirable example of the second. In an age such as that in which he
lived, unhappiness is immediate and pressing, whereas happiness, if
attainable at all, must be sought by reflection upon things that are
remote from the impressions of sense. Such happiness has in it always an
element of strain; it is very unlike the simple happiness of a child.
And since it is not derived from the everyday world, but from thought
and imagination, it demands a power of ignoring or despising the life of
the senses. It is, therefore, not those who enjoy instinctive happiness
who invent the kinds of metaphysical optimism that depend upon belief in
the reality of a super-sensible world. Among the men who have been
unhappy in a mundane sense, but resolutely determined to find a higher
happiness in the world of theory, Plotinus holds a very high place.</p>
<p>Nor are his purely intellectual merits by any means to be despised.
He has, in many respects, clarified Plato’s teaching; he has developed,
with as much consistency as possible, the type of theory advocated by
him in common with many others. His arguments against materialism are
good, and his whole conception of the relation of soul and body is
clearer than that of Plato or Aristotle.</p>
<p>Like Spinoza, he has a certain kind of moral purity and loftiness,
which is very impressive. He is always sincere, never shrill or
censorious, invariably concerned to tell the reader, as simply as he
can, what he believes to be important. Whatever one may think of him as
a theoretical philosopher, it is impossible not to love him as a
man.</p>
<p>The life of Plotinus is known, so far as it is known, through the
biography written by his friend and disciple Porphyry, a Semite whose
real name was Malchus. There are, however, miraculous elements in this
account, which make it difficult to place a complete reliance upon its
more credible portions.</p>
<p>Plotinus considered his spatio-temporal appearance unimportant, and
was loath to talk about the accidents of his historical existence. He
stated, however, that he was born in Egypt, and it is known that as a
young man he studied in Alexandria, where he lived until the age of
thirty-nine, and where his teacher was Ammonius Saccas, often regarded
as the founder of Neoplatonism. He then joined the expedition of the
Emperor Gordian III against the Persians, with the intention, it is
said, of studying the religions of the East. The Emperor was still a
youth, and was murdered by the army, as was at that time the custom.
This occurred during his campaign in Mesopotamia in A.D. 244. Plotinus
thereupon abandoned his oriental projects and settled in Rome, where he
soon began to teach. Among his hearers were many influential men, and he
was favoured by the Emperor Gallienus.1 At one time he formed a project
of founding Plato’s Republic in Campania, and building for the purpose a
new city to be called Platonopolis. The Emperor, at first, was
favourable, but ultimately withdrew his permission. It may seem strange
that there should be room for a new city so near Rome, but probably by
that time the region was malarial, as it is now, but had not been
earlier. He wrote nothing until the age of forty-nine; after that, he
wrote much. His works were edited and arranged by Porphyry, who was more
Pythagorean than Plotinus, and caused the Neoplatonist school to become
more supernaturalist than it would have been if it had followed Plotinus
more faithfully.</p>
<p>The respect of Plotinus for Plato is very great; Plato is usually
alluded to as ‘He’. In general, the ‘blessed ancients’ are treated with
reverence, but this reverence does not extend to the atomists. The
Stoics and Epicureans, being still active, are controverted, the Stoics
only for their materialism, the Epicureans for every part of their
philosophy. Aristotle plays a larger part than appears, as borrowings
from him are often unacknowledged. One feels the influence of Parmenides
at many points.</p>
<p>The Plato of Plotinus is not so full-blooded as the real Plato. The
theory of ideas, the mystical doctrines of the Phaedo and of Book VI of
the Republic, and the discussion of love in the Symposium, make up
almost the whole of Plato as he appears in the Enneads (as the books of
Plotinus are called). The political interests, the search for
definitions of separate virtues, the pleasure in mathematics, the
dramatic and affectionate appreciation of individuals, and above all the
playfulness of Plato, are wholly absent from Plotinus. Plato, as Carlyle
said is ‘very much at his ease in Zion’; Plotinus, on the contrary, is
always on his best behaviour.</p>
<p>The metaphysics of Plotinus begins with a Holy Trinity: The One,
Spirit and Soul. These three are not equal, like the Persons of the
Christian Trinity; the One is supreme, Spirit comes next, and Soul
last.2</p>
<p>The One is somewhat shadowy. It is sometimes called God, sometimes
the Good; it transcends Being, which is the first sequent upon the One.
We must not attribute predicates to it, but only say ‘It is.’ (This is
reminiscent of Parmenides.) It would be a mistake to speak of God as
‘the All’, because God</p>
<p>transcends the All. God is present through all things. The One can be
present without any coming: ‘while it is nowhere, nowhere is it not’.
Although the One is sometimes spoken of as the Good, we are also told
that it precedes both the Good and the Beautiful.3 Sometimes, the One
appears to resemble Aristotle’s God; we are told that God has no need of
His derivatives, and ignores the created world. The One is indefinable,
and in regard to it there is more truth in silence than in any words
whatever.</p>
<p>We now come to the Second Person, whom Plotinus calls nous. It is
always difficult to find an English word to represent nous. The standard
dictionary translation is ‘mind’, but this does not have the correct
connotations, particularly when the word is used in a religious
philosophy. If we were to say that Plotinus put mind above soul, we
should give a completely wrong impression. McKenna, the translator of
Plotinus, uses ‘Intellectual-Principle’, but this is awkward, and does
not suggest an object suitable for religious veneration. Dean Inge uses
‘Spirit’, which is perhaps the best word available. But it leaves out
the intellectual element which was important in all Greek religious
philosophy after Pythagoras. Mathematics, the world of ideas, and all
thought about what is not sensible, have, for Pythagoras, Plato, and
Plotinus, something divine; they constitute the activity of nous, or at
least the nearest approach to its activity that we can conceive. It was
this intellectual element in Plato’s religion that led
Christians—notably the author of Saint John’s Gospel—to identify Christ
with the Logos. Logos should be translated ‘reason’ in this connection;
this prevents us from using ‘reason’ as the translation of nous. I shall
follow Dean Inge in using ‘Spirit’, but with the proviso that nous has
an intellectual connotation which is absent from ‘Spirit’ as usually
understood. But often I shall use the word nous untranslated.</p>
<p>Nous, we are told, is the image of the One; it is engendered because
the One, in its self-quest, has vision; this seeing is nous. This is a
difficult conception. A Being without parts, Plotinus says, may know
itself; in this case, the seer and the seen are one. In God, who is
conceived, as by Plato, on the analogy of the sun, the light-giver and
what is lit are the same. Pursuing the analogy, nous may be considered
as the light by which the One sees itself. It is possible for us to know
the Divine Mind, which we forget through self-will. To know the Divine
Mind, we must study our own soul when it is most god-like: we must put
aside the body, and the part of the soul that moulded the body, and
‘sense with desires and impulses and every such futility’; what is then
left is an image of the Divine Intellect.</p>
<p>’Those divinely possessed and inspired have at least the knowledge
that they hold some greater thing within them, though they cannot tell
what it is; from the movements that stir them and the utterances that
come from</p>
<p>them they perceive the power, not themselves, that moves them: in the
same way, it must be, we stand towards the Supreme when we hold nous
pure; we know the Divine Mind within, that which gives Being and all
else of that order: but we know, too, that other, know that it is none
of these, but a nobler principle than anything we know as Being; fuller
and greater; above reason, mind, and feeling; conferring these powers,
not to be confounded with them.’4</p>
<p>Thus when we are ‘divinely possessed and inspired’ we see not only
nous, but also the One. When we are thus in contact with the Divine, we
cannot reason or express the vision in words; this comes later. ’At the
moment of touch there is no power whatever to make any affirmation;
there is no leisure; reasoning upon the vision is for afterwards. We may
know we have had the vision when the Soul has suddenly taken light. This
light is from the Supreme and is the Supreme; we may believe in the
Presence when, like that other God on the call of a certain man, He
comes bringing light; the light is the proof of the advent. Thus, the
Soul unlit remains without that vision; lit, it possesses what it
sought. And this is the true end set before the Soul, to take that
light, to see the Supreme by the Supreme and not by the light of any
other principle—to see the Supreme which is also the means to the
vision; for that which illumines the Soul is that which it is to see
just as it is by the sun’s own light that we see the sun.</p>
<p>But how is this to be accomplished?</p>
<p>Cut away everything.5</p>
<p>The experience of ‘ecstasy’ (standing outside one’s own body)
happened frequently to Plotinus:</p>
<p>Many times it has happened: Lifted out of the body into myself;
becoming external to all other things and self-encentred; beholding a
marvellous beauty; then, more than ever, assured of community with the
loftiest order; enacting the noblest life, acquiring identity with the
divine; stationing within It by having attained that activity; poised
above whatsoever in the Intellectual is less than the Supreme: yet,
there comes the moment of descent from intellection to reasoning, and
after that sojourn in the divine, I ask myself how it happens that I can
now be descending, and how did the Soul ever enter into my body, the
Soul which even within the body, is the high thing it has shown itself
to be.6</p>
<p>This brings us to Soul, the third and lowest member of the Trinity.
Soul, though inferior to nous, is the author of all living things; it
made the sun and moon and stars, and the whole visible world. It is the
offspring of the Divine Intellect. It is double: there is an inner soul,
intent on nous, and another, which faces the external. The latter is
associated with a downward movement, in which the Soul generates its
image, which is Nature and the world of sense. The Stoics had identified
Nature with God, but Plotinus regards it as the lowest sphere, something
emanating from the Soul when it forgets to look upward towards nous.
This might suggest the Gnostic view that the visible world is evil, but
Plotinus does not take this view. The visible world is beautiful, and is
the abode of blessed spirits; it is only less good than the intellectual
world. In a very interesting controversial discussion of the Gnostic
view, that the cosmos and its Creator are evil, he admits that some
parts of Gnostic doctrine, such as the hatred of matter, may be due to
Plato, but holds that the other parts, which do not come from Plato, are
untrue.</p>
<p>His objections to Gnosticism are of two sorts. On the one hand, he
says that Soul, when it creates the material world, does so from memory
of the divine, and not because it is fallen; the world of sense, he
thinks, is as good as a sensible world can be. He feels strongly the
beauty of things perceived by the senses:</p>
<p>Who that truly perceives the harmony of the Intellectual Realm could
fail, if he has any bent towards music, to answer to the harmony in
sensible sounds? What geometrician or arithmetician could fail to take
pleasure in the symmetries, correspondences and principles of order
observed in visible things? Consider, even, the case of pictures: those
seeing by the bodily sense the productions of the art of painting do not
see the one thing in the one only way; they are deeply stirred by
recognizing in the objects depicted to the eyes the presentation of what
lies in the idea, and so are called to recollection of the truth—the
very experience out of which Love rises. Now, if the sight of Beauty
excellently reproduced upon a face hurries the mind to that other
Sphere, surely no one seeing the loveliness lavish in the world of
sense—this vast orderliness, the form which the stars even in their
remoteness display, no one could be so dull-witted, so immoveable, as
not to be carried by all this to recollection, and gripped by reverent
awe in the thought of all this, so great, sprung from that greatness.
Not to answer thus could only be to have neither fathomed this world nor
had any vision of that other (II, 9, 16).</p>
<p>There is another reason for rejecting the Gnostic view. The Gnostics
think that nothing divine is associated with the sun, moon, and stars;
they were created by an evil spirit. Only the soul of man, among things
perceived, has any goodness. But Plotinus is firmly persuaded that the
heavenly bodies are the bodies of god-like beings, immeasurably superior
to man. According to the Gnostics, ‘their own soul, the soul of the
least of mankind, they declare deathless, divine; but the entire heavens
and the stars within the heavens have had no communion with the Immortal
Principle, though these are far purer and lovelier than their own souls’
(II, 9, 5). For the view of Plotinus there is authority in the Timaeus,
and it was adopted by some Christian Fathers, for instance, Origen. It
is imaginatively attractive; it expresses feelings that the heavenly
bodies naturally inspire, and makes man less lonely in the physical
universe.</p>
<p>There is in the mysticism of Plotinus nothing morose or hostile to
beauty. But he is the last religious teacher, for many centuries, of
whom this can be said. Beauty, and all the pleasures associated with it,
came to be thought to be of the Devil; pagans, as well as Christians,
came to glorify ugliness and dirt. Julian the Apostate, like
contemporary orthodox saints, boasted of the populousness of his beard.
Of all this, there is nothing in Plotinus.</p>
<p>Matter is created by Soul, and has no independent reality. Every Soul
has its hour; when that strikes, it descends, and enters the body
suitable to it. The motive is not reason, but something more analogous
to sexual desire. When the soul leaves the body, it must enter another
body if it has been sinful, for justice requires that it should be
punished. If, in this life, you have murdered your mother, you will, in
the next life, be a woman, and be murdered by your son (III, 2, 13). Sin
must be punished; but the punishment happens naturally, through the
restless driving of the sinner’s errors.</p>
<p>Do we remember this life after we are dead? The answer is perfectly
logical, but not what most modern theologians would say. Memory is
concerned with our life in time, whereas our best and truest life is in
eternity. Therefore, as the soul grows towards eternal life, it will
remember less and less; friends, children, wife, will be gradually
forgotten; ultimately, we shall know nothing of the things of this
world, but only contemplate the intellectual realm. There will be no
memory of personality, which, in contemplative vision, is unaware of
itself. The soul will become one with nous, but not to its own
destruction: nous and the individual soul will be simultaneously two and
one (IV, 4, 2).</p>
<p>In the Fourth Ennead, which is on the Soul, one section, the Seventh
Tractate, is devoted to the discussion of immortality.</p>
<p>The body, being compound, is clearly not immortal; if, then, it is
part of us, we are not wholly immortal. But what is the relation of the
soul to the body? Aristotle (who is not mentioned explicitly) said the
soul was the form of the body, but Plotinus rejects this view, on the
ground that the intellectual act would be impossible if the soul were
any form of body. The Stoics think that the soul is material, but the
unity of the soul proves that this is impossible. Moreover, since matter
is passive, it cannot have created itself; matter could not exist if
soul had not created it, and, if soul did not exist, matter would
disappear in a twinkling. The soul is neither matter nor the form of a
material body, but Essence, and Essence is eternal. This view is
implicit in Plato’s argument that the soul is immortal because ideas are
eternal; but it is only with Plotinus that it becomes explicit.</p>
<p>How does the soul enter the body from the aloofness of the
intellectual world? The answer is, through appetite. But appetite though
sometimes ignoble, may be comparatively noble. At best, the soul ‘has
the desire of elaborating order on the model of what it has seen in the
Intellectual-Principle (nous)’. That is to say, soul contemplates the
inward realm of essence, and wishes to produce something, as like it as
possible, that can be seen by looking without instead of looking
within—like (we might say) a composer who first imagines his music, and
then wishes to hear it performed by an orchestra.</p>
<p>But this desire of the soul to create has unfortunate results. So
long as the soul lives in the pure world of essence, it is not separated
from other souls living in the same world; but as soon as it becomes
joined to a body, it has the task of governing what is lower than
itself, and by this task it becomes separate from other souls, which
have other bodies. Except in a few men at a few moments, the soul
becomes chained to the body. ‘The body obscures the truth, but there7
all stands out clear and separate’ (IV, 9, 5).</p>
<p>This doctrine, like Plato’s, has difficulty in avoiding the view that
the creation was a mistake. The soul at its best is content with nous,
the world of essence; if it were always at its best, it would not
create, but only contemplate. It seems that the act of creation is to be
excused on the ground that the created world, in its main lines, is the
best that is logically possible; but this is a copy of the eternal
world, and as such has the beauty that is possible to a copy. The most
definite statement is in the Tractate on the Gnostics (II, 9, 8):</p>
<p>To ask why the Soul has created the Kosmos, is to ask why there is a
Soul and why a Creator creates. The question, also, implies a beginning
in the eternal and, further, represents creation as the act of a
changeful Being who turns from this to that.</p>
<p>Those that think so must be instructed—if they would but bear with
correction—in the nature of the Supernals, and brought to desist from
that blasphemy of majestic powers which comes so easily to them, where
all should be reverent scruple.</p>
<p>Even in the administration of the Universe there is no ground for
such attack, for it affords manifest proof of the greatness of the
Intellectual Kind.</p>
<p>This All that has emerged into life is no amorphous structure—like
those lesser forms within it which are born night and day out of the
lavishness of its vitality—the Universe is a life organised, effective,
complex, allcomprehensive, displaying an unfathomable wisdom. How, then,
can anyone deny that it is a clear image, beautifully formed, of the
Intellectual Divinities? No doubt it is a copy, not original; but that
is its very nature; it cannot be at once symbol and reality. But to say
that it is an inadequate copy is false; nothing has been left out which
a beautiful representation within the physical order could include.</p>
<p>Such a reproduction there must necessarily be—thought not by
deliberation and contrivance—for the Intellectual could not be the last
of things, but must have a double Act, one within itself, and one
outgoing; there must, then, be something later than the Divine; for only
the thing with which all power ends fails to pass downwards something of
itself.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the best answer to the Gnostics that the principles
of Plotinus make possible. The problem, in slightly different language,
was inherited by Christian theologians; they, also, have found it
difficult to account for the creation without allowing the blasphemous
conclusion that, before it, something was lacking to the Creator.
Indeed, their difficulty is greater than that of Plotinus, for he may
say that the nature of Mind made creation inevitable, whereas, for the
Christian, the world resulted from the untrammelled exercise of God’s
free will.</p>
<p>Plotinus has a very vivid sense of a certain kind of abstract beauty.
In describing the position of Intellect as intermediate between the One
and Soul, he suddenly bursts out into a passage of rare eloquence:</p>
<p>The Supreme in its progress could never be borne forward upon some
soulless vehicle nor even directly upon the Soul: it will be heralded by
some ineffable beauty: before the Great King in his progress there comes
first the minor train, then rank by rank the greater and more exalted,
closer to the King the kinglier; next his own honoured company until,
last among all these grandeurs, suddenly appears the Supreme Monarch
himself, and all—unless indeed for those who have contented themselves
with the spectacle before his coming and gone away—prostrate themselves
and hail him (V, 5, 3).</p>
<p>There is a Tractate on Intellectual Beauty, which shows the same kind
of feeling (V, 8):</p>
<p>Assuredly all the gods are august and beautiful in a beauty beyond
our speech. And what makes them so? Intellect; and especially Intellect
operating within them (the divine sun and stars) to visibility….</p>
<p>To ‘live at ease’ is There; and to these divine beings verity is
mother and nurse, existence and sustenance; all that is not of process
but of authentic being they see, and themselves in all; for all is
transparent, nothing dark, nothing resistant; every being is lucid to
every other, in breadth and depth; light runs through light. And each of
them contains all within itself, and at the same time sees all in every
other, so that everywhere there is all, and all is all and each all, and
infinite the glory. Each of them is great; the small is great; the sun,
There, is all the stars; and every star, again, is all the stars and
sun. While some manner of being is dominant in each, all are mirrored in
every other.</p>
<p>In addition to the imperfection which the world inevitably possesses
because it is a copy, there is, for Plotinus as for the Christians, the
more positive evil that results from sin. Sin is a consequence of free
will, which Plotinus upholds as against the determinists, and, more
particularly, the astrologers. He does not venture to deny the validity
of astrology altogether, but he attempts to set bounds to it, so as to
make what remains compatible with free will. He does the same as regards
magic; the sage, he says, is exempt from the power of the magician.
Porphyry relates that a rival philosopher tried to put evil spells on
Plotinus, but that, because of his holiness and wisdom, the spells
recoiled on the rival. Porphyry, and all the followers of Plotinus, are
much more superstitious than he is. Superstition, in him, is as slight
as was possible in that age. Let us now endeavour to sum up the merits
and defects of the doctrine taught by Plotinus, and in the main accepted
by Christian theology so long as it remained systematic and
intellectual.</p>
<p>There is, first and foremost, the construction of what Plotinus
believed to be a secure refuge for ideals and hopes, and one, moreover,
which involved both moral and intellectual effort. In the third century,
and in the centuries after the barbarian invasion, western civilization
came near to total destruction. It was fortunate that, while theology
was almost the sole surviving mental activity, the system that was
accepted was not purely superstitious, but preserved, though sometimes
deeply buried, doctrines which embodied much of the work of Greek
intellect and much of the moral devotion that is common to the Stoics
and the Neoplatonists. This made possible the rise of the scholastic
philosophy, and later, with the Renaissance, the stimulus derived from
the renewed study of Plato, and thence of the other ancients.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the philosophy of Plotinus has the defect of
encouraging men to look within rather than to look without: when we look
within we see nous, which is divine, while when we look without we see
the imperfections of the sensible world. This kind of subjectivity was a
gradual growth; it is to be found in the doctrines of Protagoras,
Socrates, and Plato, as well as in the Stoics and Epicureans. But at
first it was only doctrinal, not temperamental; for a long time it
failed to kill scientific curiosity. We saw how Posidonius, about 100
B.C., travelled to Spain and the Atlantic coast of Africa to study the
tides. Gradually, however, subjectivism invaded men’s feelings as well
as their doctrines. Science was no longer cultivated, and only virtue
was thought important. Virtue, as conceived by Plato, involved all that
was then possible in the way of mental achievement; but in later
centuries it came to be thought of, increasingly, as involving only the
virtuous will, and not a desire to understand the physical world or
improve the world of human institutions. Christianity, in its ethical
doctrines, was not free from this defect, although in practice belief in
the importance of spreading the Christian faith gave a practicable
object for moral activity, which was no longer confined to the
perfecting of self.</p>
<p>Plotinus is both an end and a beginning—an end as regards the Greeks,
a beginning as regards Christendom. To the ancient world, weary with
centuries of disappointment, exhausted by despair, his doctrine might be
acceptable, but could not be stimulating. To the cruder barbarian world,
where superabundant energy needed to be restrained and regulated rather
than stimulated, what could penetrate in his teaching was beneficial,
since the evil to be combated was not languor but brutality. The work of
transmitting what could survive of his philosophy was performed by the
Christian philosophers of the last age of Rome.</p>

<p>Catholic Philosophy</p>
<hr />
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Catholic philosophy, in the sense in which I shall use the term, is
that which dominated European thought from Augustine to the Renaissance.
There have been philosophers, before and after this period of ten
centuries, who belonged to the same general school. Before Augustine
there were the early Fathers, especially Origen; after the Renaissance
there are many, including, at the present day, all orthodox Catholic
teachers of philosophy, who adhere to some medieval system, especially
that of Thomas Aquinas. But it is only from Augustine to the Renaissance
that the greatest philosophers of the age are concerned in building up
or perfecting the Catholic synthesis. In the Christian centuries before
Augustine, Stoics and Neoplatonists outshine the Fathers in philosophic
ability; after the Renaissance, none of the outstanding philosophers,
even among those who were orthodox Catholics, were concerned to carry on
the Scholastic or the Augustinian tradition.</p>
<p>The period with which we shall be concerned in this book differs from
earlier and later times not only in philosophy, but in many other ways.
The most notable of these is the power of the Church. The Church brought
philosophic beliefs into a closer relation to social and political
circumstances than they have ever had before or since the medieval
period, which we may reckon from about A.D. 400 to about A.D. 1400. The
Church is a social institution built upon a creed, partly philosophic,
partly concerned with sacred history. It achieved power and wealth by
means of its creed. The lay rulers, who were in frequent conflict with
it, were defeated because the great majority of the population,
including most of the lay rulers themselves, were profoundly convinced
of the truth of the Catholic faith. There were traditions, Roman and
Germanic, against which the Church had to fight. The Roman tradition was
strongest in Italy, especially among lawyers; the German tradition was
strongest in the feudal aristocracy that arose out of the barbarian
conquest. But for many centuries neither of these traditions proved
strong enough to generate a successful opposition to the Church; and
this was largely due to the fact that they were not embodied in any
adequate philosophy.</p>
<p>A history of thought, such as that upon which we are engaged, is
unavoidably one-sided in dealing with the Middle Ages. With very few
exceptions, all the men of this period who contributed to the
intellectual life of their time were churchmen. The laity in the Middle
Ages slowly built up a vigorous political and economic system, but their
activities were in a sense blind. There was in the later Middle Ages an
important lay literature, very different from that of the Church; in a
general history, this literature would demand more consideration than is
called for in a history of philosophic thought. It is not until we come
to Dante that we find a layman writing with full knowledge of the
ecclesiastical philosophy of his time. Until the fourteenth century,
ecclesiastics have a virtual monopoly of philosophy, and philosophy,
accordingly, is written from the standpoint of the Church. For this
reason, medieval thought cannot be made intelligible without a fairly
extensive account of the growth of ecclesiastical institutions, and
especially of the papacy.</p>
<p>The medieval world, as contrasted with the world of antiquity, is
characterized by various forms of dualism. There is the dualism of
clergy and laity, the dualism of Latin and Teuton, the dualism of the
kingdom of God and the kingdoms of this world, the dualism of the spirit
and the flesh. All these are exemplified in the dualism of Pope and
Emperor. The dualism of Latin and Teuton is an outcome of the barbarian
invasion, but the others have older sources. The relations of clergy and
laity, for the Middle Ages, were to be modelled on the relations of
Samuel and Saul; the demand for the supremacy of the clergy arose out of
the period of Arian or semi-Arian emperors and kings. The dualism of the
kingdom of God and the kingdoms of this world is found in the New
Testament, but was systematized in Saint Augustine’s City of God. The
dualism of the spirit and the flesh is to be found in Plato, and was
emphasized by the Neoplatonists; it is important in the teaching of St
Paul; and it dominated the Christian asceticism of the fourth and fifth
centuries.</p>
<p>Catholic philosophy is divided into two periods by the dark ages,
during which, in Western Europe, intellectual activity was almost
non-existent. From the conversion of Constantine to the death of
Boethius, the thoughts of Christian philosophers are still dominated by
the Roman Empire, either as an actuality or as a recent memory. The
barbarians, in this period, are regarded merely as a nuisance, not as an
independent part of Christendom. There is still a civilized community,
in which all well-to-do people can read and write, and a philosopher has
to appeal to the laity as well as to the clergy. Between this period and
the dark ages, at the end of the sixth century, stands Gregory the
Great, who regards himself as a subject of the Byzantine emperor, but is
lordly in his attitude to barbarian kings. After his time, throughout
Western Christendom, the separation of clergy and laity becomes more and
more marked. The lay aristocracy creates the feudal system, which
slightly tempers the prevailing turbulent anarchy; Christian humility is
preached by the clergy, but practised only by the lower classes; pagan
pride is embodied in the duel, trial by battle, tournaments, and private
revenge, all of which the Church dislikes but cannot prevent. With great
difficulty, beginning in the eleventh century, the Church succeeds in
emancipating itself from the feudal aristocracy, and this emancipation
is one of the causes of the emergence of Europe from the dark ages.</p>
<p>The first great period of Catholic philosophy was dominated by St
Augustine, and by Plato among the pagans. The second period culminates
in St Thomas Aquinas, for whom, and for his successors, Aristotle far
outweighs Plato. The dualism of The City of God, however, survives in
full force. The Church represents the City of God, and politically
philosophers stand for the interests of the Church. Philosophy was
concerned to defend the faith, and invoked reason to enable it to argue
with those who, like the Mohammedans, did not accept the validity of the
Christian revelation. By this invocation of reason the philosophers
challenged criticism, not merely as theologians, but as inventors of
systems designed to appeal to men of no matter what creed. In the long
run, the appeal to reason was perhaps a mistake, but in the thirteenth
century it seemed highly successful.</p>
<p>The thirteenth-century synthesis, which had an air of completeness
and finality, was destroyed by a variety of causes. Perhaps the most
important of these was the growth of a rich commercial class, first in
Italy, and then elsewhere. The feudal aristocracy, in the main, had been
ignorant, stupid, and barbaric; the common people had sided with the
Church as superior to the nobles in intelligence, in morality, and in
capacity to combat anarchy. But the new commercial class were as
intelligent as the clergy, as well-informed in mundane matters, more
capable of coping with the nobles, and more acceptable to the urban
lower classes as champions of civic liberty. Democratic tendencies came
to the fore, and after helping the Pope to defeat the Emperor, set to
work to emancipate economic life from ecclesiastical control.</p>
<p>Another cause of the end of the Middle Ages was the rise of strong
national monarchies in France, England, and Spain. Having suppressed
internal anarchy, and allied themselves with the rich merchants against
the aristocracy, the kings, after the middle of the fifteenth century,
were strong enough to fight the Pope in the national interest.</p>
<p>The papacy, meanwhile, had lost the moral prestige which it had
enjoyed, and on the whole deserved, in the eleventh, twelfth, and
thirteenth centuries. First by subservience to France during the period
when the popes lived at Avignon, then by the Great Schism, they had
unintentionally persuaded the Western world that an unchecked papal
autocracy was neither possible nor desirable. In the fifteenth century,
their position as rulers of Christendom became subordinate, in practice,
to their position as Italian princes, involved in the complex and
unscrupulous game of Italian power politics.</p>
<p>And so the Renaissance and the Reformation disrupted the medieval
synthesis, which has not yet been succeeded by anything so tidy and so
apparently complete. The growth and decay of this synthesis is the
subject of Book II.</p>
<p>The mood of thoughtful men, throughout the whole period, was one of
deep unhappiness in regard to the affairs of this world, only rendered
endurable by the hope of a better world hereafter. This unhappiness was
a reflection of what was happening throughout Western Europe. The third
century was a period of disaster, when the general level of well-being
was sharply lowered. After a lull during the fourth century, the fifth
brought the extinction of the Western Empire and the establishment of
barbarians throughout its former territory. The cultivated urban rich,
upon whom late Roman civilization depended, were largely reduced to the
condition of destitute refugees; the remainder took to living on their
rural estates. Fresh shocks continued until about A.D. 1000, without any
sufficient breathing space to allow of recovery. The wars of Byzantines
and Lombards destroyed most of what remained of the civilization of
Italy. The Arabs conquered most of the territory of the Eastern Empire,
established themselves in Africa and Spain, threatened France, and even,
on one occasion, sacked Rome. The Danes and Normans caused havoc in
France and England, in Sicily and Southern Italy. Life, throughout these
centuries, was precarious and full of hardship. Bad as it was in
reality, gloomy superstitions made it even worse. It was thought that
the great majority even of Christians would go to hell. At every moment,
men felt themselves encompassed by evil spirits, and exposed to the
machinations of sorcerers and witches. No joy of life was possible,
except, in fortunate moments, to those who retained the thoughtlessness
of children. The general misery heightened the intensity of religious
feeling. The life of the good here below was a pilgrimage to the
heavenly city; nothing of value was possible in the sublunary world
except the steadfast virtue that would lead, in the end, to eternal
bliss. The Greeks, in their great days, had found joy and beauty in the
everyday world. Empedocles, apostrophizing his fellow-citizens, says:
‘Friends, that inhabit the great city looking down on the yellow rock of
Acragas, up by the citadel, busy in goodly works, harbour of honour for
the stranger, men unskilled in meanness, all hail.’ In later times,
until the Renaissance, men had no such simple happiness in the visible
world, but turned their hopes to the unseen. Acragas is replaced in
their love by Jerusalem the Golden. When earthly happiness at last
returned, the intensity of longing for the other world grew gradually
less. Men used the same words, but with a less profound sincerity.</p>
<p>In the attempt to make the genesis and significance of Catholic
philosophy intelligible, I have found it necessary to devote more space
to general history than is demanded in connection with either ancient or
modern philosophy. Catholic philosophy is essentially the philosophy of
an institution, namely the Catholic Church; modern philosophy, even when
it is far from orthodox, is largely concerned with problems, especially
in ethics and political theory, which are derived from Christian views
of the moral law and from Catholic doctrines as to the relations of
Church and State. In Graeco-Roman paganism there is no such dual loyalty
as the Christian, from the very beginning, has owed to God and Caesar,
or, in political terms, to Church and State.</p>
<p>The problems raised by this dual loyalty were, for the most part,
worked out in practice before the philosophers supplied the necessary
theory. In this process there were two very distinct stages: one before
the fall of the Western Empire, and one after it. The practice of a long
line of bishops, culminating in St Ambrose, supplied the basis for St
Augustine’s political philosophy. Then came the barbarian invasion,
followed by a long time of confusion and increasing ignorance. Between
Boethius and St Anselm, a period of over five centuries, there is only
one eminent philosopher, John the Scot, and he, as an Irishman, had
largely escaped the various processes that were moulding the rest of the
Western world. But this period, in spite of the absence of philosophers,
was not one during which there was no intellectual development. Chaos
raised urgent practical problems, which were dealt with by means of
institutions and modes of thought that dominated scholastic philosophy,
and are, to a great extent, still important at the present day. These
institutions and modes of thought were not introduced to the world by
theorists but by practical men in the stress of conflict. The moral
reform of the Church in the eleventh century, which was the immediate
prelude to the scholastic philosophy, was a reaction against the
increasing absorption of the Church into the feudal system. To
understand the scholastics we must understand Hildebrand, and to
understand Hildebrand we must know something of the evils against which
he contended. Nor can we ignore the foundation of the Holy Roman Empire
and its effect upon European thought.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the reader will find in the following pages much
ecclesiastical and political history of which the relevance to the
development of philosophic thought may not be immediately evident. It is
the more necessary to relate something of this history as the period
concerned is obscure, and is unfamiliar to many who are at home with
both ancient and modern history. Few technical philosophers have had as
much influence on philosophic thought as St Ambrose, Charlemagne, and
Hildebrand. To relate what is essential concerning these men and their
times is therefore indispensable in any adequate treatment of our
subject.</p>
