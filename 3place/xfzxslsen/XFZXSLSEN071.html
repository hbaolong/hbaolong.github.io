<h4 id="byron">23 BYRON</h4>
<p>The nineteenth century, in comparison with the present age, appears
rational, progressive, and satisfied; yet the opposite qualities of our
time were possessed by many of the most remarkable men during the epoch
of liberal optimism. When we consider men, not as artists or
discoverers, not as sympathetic or antipathetic to our own tastes, but
as forces, as causes of change in the social structure, in judgments of
value, or in intellectual outlook, we find that the course of events in
recent times has necessitated much readjustment in our estimates, making
some men less important than they had seemed, and others more so. Among
those whose importance is greater than it seemed, Byron deserves a high
place. On the Continent, such a view would not appear surprising, but in
the English-speaking world it may be thought strange. It was on the
Continent that Byron was influential, and it is not in England that his
spiritual progeny is to be sought. To most of us, his verse seems often
poor and his sentiment often tawdry, but abroad his way of feeling and
his outlook on life were transmitted and developed and transmuted until
they became so wide-spread as to be factors in great events.</p>
<p>The aristocratic rebel, of whom Byron was in his day the exemplar, is
a very different type from the leader of a peasant or proletarian
revolt. Those who are hungry have no need of an elaborate philosophy to
stimulate or excuse discontent, and anything of the kind appears to them
merely an amusement of the idle rich. They want what others have, not
some intangible and metaphysical good. Though they may preach Christian
love, as the medieval communist rebels did, their real reasons for doing
so are very simple: that the lack of it in the rich and powerful causes
the sufferings of the poor, and that the presence of it among comrades
in revolt is thought essential to success. But experience of the
struggle leads to a despair of the power of love, leaving naked hate as
the driving force. A rebel of this type, if, like Marx, he invents a
philosophy, invents one solely designed to demonstrate the ultimate
victory of his party, not one concerned with values. His values remain
primitive: the good is enough to eat, and the rest is talk. No hungry
man is likely to think otherwise.</p>
<p>The aristocratic rebel, since he has enough to eat, must have other
causes of discontent. I do not include among rebels the mere leaders of
factions temporarily out of power; I include only men whose philosophy
requires some greater change than their own personal success. It may be
that love of power is the underground source of their discontent, but in
their conscious thought there is criticism of the government of the
world, which, when it goes deep enough, takes the form of Titanic cosmic
self-assertion or, in those who retain some superstition, of Satanism.
Both are to be found in Byron. Both, largely through men whom he
influenced, became common in large sections of society which could
hardly be deemed aristocratic. The aristocratic philosophy of rebellion,
growing, developing, and changing as it approached maturity, has
inspired a long series of revolutionary movements, from the Carbonari
after the fall of Napoleon to Hitler’s coup in 1933; and at each stage
it has inspired a corresponding manner of thought and feeling among
intellectuals and artists.</p>
<p>It is obvious that an aristocrat does not become a rebel unless his
temperament and circumstances are in some way peculiar. Byron’s
circumstances were very peculiar. His earliest recollections were of his
parents’ quarrels; his mother was a woman whom he feared for her cruelty
and despised for her vulgarity; his nurse combined wickedness with the
strictest Calvinist theology; his lameness filled him with shame, and
prevented him from being one of the herd at school. At ten years old,
after living in poverty, he suddenly found himself a Lord and the owner
of Newstead. His great-uncle the ‘wicked Lord’, from whom he inherited,
had killed a man in a duel thirty-three years ago, and been ostracized
by his neighbours ever since. The Byrons had been a lawless family, and
the Gordons, his mother’s ancestors, even more so. After the squalor of
a back street in Aberdeen, the boy naturally rejoiced in his title and
his Abbey, and was willing to take on the character of his ancestors in
gratitude for their lands. And if, in recent years, their bellicosity
had led them into trouble, he learnt that in former centuries it had
brought them renown. One of his earliest poems, ‘On Leaving Newstead
Abbey’, relates his emotions at this time, which are of admiration for
his ancestors who fought in the Crusades, at Crecy, and at Marston Moor.
He ends with the pious resolve:</p>
<p>Like you will he live, or like you will he perish:</p>
<p>When decay’d, may he mingle his dust with your own.</p>
<p>This is not the mood of a rebel, but it suggests ‘Childe’ Harold, the
modern peer who imitates medieval barons. As an undergraduate, when for
the first time he had an income of his own, he wrote that he felt as
independent as ‘a German Prince who coins his own cash, or a Cherokee
Chief who coins no cash at all, but enjoys what is more precious,
Liberty. I speak in raptures of that Goddess because my amiable Mama was
so despotic’. He wrote, in later life, much noble verse in praise of
freedom, but it must be understood that the freedom he praised was that
of a German Prince or a Cherokee Chief, not the inferior sort that might
conceivably be enjoyed by ordinary mortals.</p>
<p>In spite of his lineage and his title, his aristocratic relations
fought shy of him, and he was made to feel himself socially not of their
society. His mother was intensely disliked, and he was looked on with
suspicion. He knew that she was vulgar, and darkly feared a similar
defect in himself. Hence arose that peculiar blend of snobbery and
rebellion that characterized him. If he could not be a gentleman in the
modern style, he would be a bold baron in the style of his crusading
ancestors, or perhaps in the more ferocious but even more romantic style
of the Ghibelline chiefs, cursed of God and Man as they trampled their
way to splendid downfall. Medieval romances and histories were his
etiquette books. He sinned like the Hohenstaufen, and like the crusaders
he died fighting the Moslem.</p>
<p>His shyness and sense of friendlessness made him look for comfort in
love affairs, but as he was unconsciously seeking a mother rather than a
mistress, all disappointed him except Augusta. Calvinism, which he never
shook off—to Shelley, in 1816, he described himself as ‘Methodist,
Calvinist, Augustinian’—made him feel that his manner of life was
wicked; but wickedness, he told himself, was a hereditary curse in his
blood, an evil fate to which he was predestined by the Almighty. If that
were indeed the case, since he must be remarkable, he would be
remarkable as a sinner, and would dare transgressions beyond the courage
of the fashionable libertines whom he wished to despise. He loved
Augusta genuinely because she was of his blood—of the Ishmaelite race of
the Byrons—and also, more simply, because she had an elder sister’s
kindly care for his daily welfare. But this was not all that she had to
offer him. Through her simplicity and her obliging good-nature, she
became the means of providing him with the most delicious
self-congratulatory remorse. He could feel himself the equal of the
greatest sinners—the peer of Manfred, of Cain, almost of Satan himself.
The Calvinist, the aristocrat, and the rebel were all equally satisfied;
and so was the romantic lover, whose heart was broken by the loss of the
only earthly being still capable of rousing in it the gentler emotions
of pity and love.</p>
<p>Byron, though he felt himself the equal of Satan, never quite
ventured to put himself in the place of God. This next step in the
growth of pride was taken by Nietzsche, who says: ‘If there were Gods,
how could I endure it to be not God! Therefore there are no Gods.’
Observe the suppressed premiss of this reasoning: ‘Whatever humbles my
pride is to be judged false.’ Nietzsche, like Byron, and even to a
greater degree, had a pious upbringing, but having a better intellect,
he found a better escape than Satanism. He remained, however, very
sympathetic to Byron. He says:</p>
<p>’The tragedy is that we cannot believe the dogmas of religion and
metaphysics if we have the strict methods of truth in heart and head,
but on the other hand, we have become through the development of
humanity so tenderly sensitively suffering that we need the highest kind
of means of salvation and consolation: whence arises the danger that man
may bleed to death through the truth that he recognizes. Byron expresses
this in immortal lines:</p>
<p>Sorrow is knowledge: they who know the most</p>
<p>Must mourn the deepest o’er the fatal truth,</p>
<p>The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though rarely, Byron approaches more nearly to Nietzsche’s
point of view. But in general Byron’s ethical theory, as opposed to his
practice, remains strictly conventional.</p>
<p>The great man, to Nietzsche, is godlike, to Byron, usually, a Titan
at war with himself. Sometimes, however, he portrays a sage not unlike
Zarathustra—the Corsair, in his dealings with his followers,</p>
<p>Still sways their souls with that commanding art</p>
<p>That dazzles, leads, yet chills the vulgar heart.</p>
<p>And this same hero ‘hated man too much to feel remorse’. A footnote
assures us that the Corsair is true to human nature, since similar
traits were exhibited by Genseric, King of the Vandals, by Ezzelino the
Ghibelline tyrant, and by a certain Louisiana pirate.</p>
<p>Byron was not obliged to confine himself to the Levant and the Middle
Ages in his search for heroes, since it was not difficult to invest
Napoleon with a romantic mantle. The influence of Napoleon on the
imagination of nineteenth-century Europe was very profound; he inspired
Clausewitz, Stendhal, Heine, the thought of Fichte and Nietzsche, and
the acts of Italian patriots. His ghost stalks through the age, the only
force which is strong enough to stand up against industrialism and
commerce, pouring scorn on pacifism and shop-keeping. Tolstoy’s War and
Peace is an attempt to exorcize the ghost, but a vain one, for the
spectre has never been more powerful than at the present day.</p>
<p>During the Hundred Days, Byron proclaimed his wish for Napoleon’s
victory, and when he heard of Waterloo he said, ‘I’m damned sorry for
it.’ Only once, for a moment, did he turn against his hero: in 1814,
when (so he thought) suicide would have been more seemly than
abdication. At this moment, he sought consolation in the virtue of
Washington, but the return from Elba made this effort no longer
necessary. In France, when Byron died, ‘It was remarked in many
newspapers that the two greatest men of the century, Napoleon and Byron,
had disappeared almost at the same time.’1 Carlyle, who, at the time,
considered Byron ’the noblest spirit in Europe’, and felt as if he had
‘lost a brother’, came afterwards to prefer Goethe, but still coupled
Byron with Napoleon:</p>
<p>’For your nobler minds, the publishing of some such Work of Art, in
one or the other dialect, becomes almost a necessity. For what is it
properly but an altercation with the Devil, before you begin honestly
Fighting him? Your Byron publishes his Sorrows of Lord George, in verse
and in prose, and copiously otherwise: your Bonaparte presents his
Sorrows of Napoleon Opera, in an all too-stupendous style; with music of
canon-volleys, and murder shrieks of a world; his stage-lights are the
fires of Conflagration; his rhyme and recitative are the tramp of
embanded Hosts and the sound of falling Cities.’2</p>
<p>It is true that, three chapters further on, he gives the emphatic
command: ‘Close thy Byron; open thy Goethe.’ But Byron was in his blood,
whereas Goethe remained an aspiration.</p>
<p>To Carlyle, Goethe and Byron were antitheses; to Alfred de Musset,
they were accomplices in the wicked work of instilling the poison of
melancholy into the cheerful Gallic soul. Most young Frenchmen of that
age knew Goethe, it seems, only through The Sorrows of Werther, and not
at all as the Olympian. Musset blamed Byron for not being consoled by
the Adriatic and Countess Guiccioli—wrongly, for after he knew her he
wrote no more Manfreds. But Don Juan was as little read in France as
Goethe’s more cheerful poetry. In spite of Musset, most French poets,
ever since, have found Byronic unhappiness the best material for their
verses.</p>
<p>To Musset, it was only after Napoleon that Byron and Goethe were the
greatest geniuses of the century. Born in 1810, Musset was one of the
generation whom he describes as ‘conçus entre deux batailles’ in a
lyrical description of the glories and disasters of the Empire. In
Germany, feeling about Napoleon was more divided. There were those who,
like Heine, saw him as the mighty missionary of liberalism, the
destroyer of serfdom, the enemy of legitimacy, the man who made
hereditary princelings tremble; there were others who saw him as
Antichrist, the would-be destroyer of the noble German nation, the
immoralist who had proved once for all that Teutonic virtue can only be
preserved by unquenchable hatred of France. Bismarck effected a
synthesis:</p>
<p>Napoleon remained Antichrist, but an Antichrist to be imitated, not
merely to be abhorred. Nietzsche, who accepted the compromise, remarked
with ghoulish joy that the classical age of war is coming, and that we
owe this boon, not to the French Revolution, but to Napoleon. And in
this way nationalism, Satanism, and hero-worship, the legacy of Byron,
became part of the complex soul of Germany.</p>
<p>Byron is not gentle, but violent like a thunderstorm. What he says of
Rousseau is applicable to himself. Rousseau was, he says</p>
<p>He who threw</p>
<p>Enchantment over passion, and from woe</p>
<p>Wrung overwhelming eloquence…</p>
<p>yet he knew</p>
<p>How to make madness beautiful, and cast</p>
<p>O’er erring deeds and thoughts, a heavenly hue.</p>
<p>But there is a profound difference between the two men. Rousseau is
pathetic, Byron is fierce; Rousseau’s timidity is obvious, Byron’s is
concealed; Rousseau admires virtue provided it is simple, while Byron
admires sin provided it is elemental. The difference, though it is only
that between two stages in the revolt of unsocial instincts, is
important, and shows the direction in which the movement is
developing.</p>
<p>Byron’s romanticism, it must be confessed, was only half sincere. At
times, he would say that Pope’s poetry was better than his own, but this
judgment, also, was probably only what he thought in certain moods. The
world insisted on simplifying him, and omitting the element of pose in
his cosmic despair and professed contempt for mankind. Like many other
prominent men, he was more important as a myth than as he really was. As
a myth, his importance, especially on the Continent, was enormous.</p>
