<h4 id="the-rise-of-greek-civilization">1 THE RISE OF GREEK
CIVILIZATION</h4>
<p>In all history, nothing is so surprising or so difficult to account
for as the sudden rise of civilization in Greece. Much of what makes
civilization had already existed for thousands of years in Egypt and in
Mesopotamia, and had spread thence to neighbouring countries. But
certain elements had been lacking until the Greeks supplied them. What
they achieved in art and literature is familiar to everybody, but what
they did in the purely intellectual realm is even more exceptional. They
invented mathematics1 and science and philosophy; they first wrote
history as opposed to mere annals; they speculated freely about the
nature of the world and the ends of life, without being bound in the
fetters of any inherited orthodoxy. What occurred was so astonishing
that, until very recent times, men were content to gape and talk
mystically about the Greek genius. It is possible, however, to
understand the development of Greece in scientific terms, and it is well
worth while to do so.</p>
<p>Philosophy begins with Thales, who, fortunately, can be dated by the
fact that he predicted an eclipse which, according to the astronomers,
occurred in the year 585 B.C. Philosophy and science—which were not
originally separate—were therefore born together at the beginning of the
sixth century. What had been happening in Greece and neighbouring
countries before this time? Any answer must be in part conjectural, but
archaeology, during the present century, has given us much more
knowledge than was possessed by our grandfathers.</p>
<p>The art of writing was invented in Egypt about the year 4000 B.C.,
and in Mesopotamia not much later. In each country writing began with
pictures of</p>
<p>the objects intended. These pictures quickly became conventionalized,
so that words were represented by ideograms, as they still are in China.
In the course of thousands of years, this cumbrous system developed into
alphabetic writing.</p>
<p>The early development of civilization in Egypt and Mesopotamia was
due to the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, which made agriculture
very easy and very productive. The civilization was in many ways similar
to that which the Spaniards found in Mexico and Peru. There was a divine
king, with despotic powers; in Egypt, he owned all the land. There was a
polytheistic religion, with a supreme god to whom the king had a
specially intimate relation. There was a military aristocracy, and also
a priestly aristocracy. The latter was often able to encroach on the
royal power if the king was weak or if he was engaged in a difficult
war. The cultivators of the soil were serfs, belonging to the king, the
aristocracy, or the priesthood.</p>
<p>There was a considerable difference between Egyptian and Babylonian
theology. The Egyptians were preoccupied with death, and believed that
the souls of the dead descend into the underworld, where they are judged
by Osiris according to the manner of their life on earth. They thought
that the soul would ultimately return to the body; this led to
mummification and to the construction of splendid tombs. The pyramids
were built by various kings at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. and
the beginning of the third. After this time, Egyptian civilization
became more and more stereotyped, and religious conservatism made
progress impossible. About 1800 B.C. Egypt was conquered by Semites
named Hyksos, who ruled the country for about two centuries. They left
no permanent mark on Egypt, but their presence there must have helped to
spread Egyptian civilization in Syria and Palestine.</p>
<p>Babylonia had a more warlike development than Egypt. At first, the
ruling race were not Semites, but ‘Sumerians’, whose origin is unknown.
They invented cuneiform writing, which the conquering Semites took over
from them. There was a period when there were various independent cities
which fought with each other, but in the end Babylon became supreme and
established an empire. The gods of other cities became subordinate, and
Marduk, the god of Babylon, acquired a position like that later held by
Zeus in the Greek pantheon. The same sort of thing had happened in
Egypt, but at a much earlier time.</p>
<p>The religions of Egypt and Babylonia, like other ancient religions,
were originally fertility cults. The earth was female, the sun male. The
bull was usually regarded as an embodiment of male fertility, and
bull-gods were common. In Babylon, lshtar, the earth-goddess, was
supreme among female divinities. Throughout western Asia, the Great
Mother was worshipped under various names. When Greek colonists in Asia
Minor found temples to her, they named her Artemis and took over the
existing cult. This is the origin of ‘Diana of the Ephesians’.2
Christianity transformed her into the Virgin Mary, and it was a Council
at Ephesus that legitimated the title ‘Mother of God’ as applied to Our
Lady.</p>
<p>Where a religion was bound up with the government of an empire,
political motives did much to tansform its primitive features. A god or
goddess became associated with the State, and had to give, not only an
abundant harvest, but victory in war. A rich priestly caste elaborated
the ritual and the theology, and fitted together into a pantheon the
several divinities of the component parts of the empire.</p>
<p>Through association with government, the gods also became associated
with morality. Lawgivers received their codes from a god; thus a breach
of the law became an impiety. The oldest legal code still known is that
of Hammurabi, king of Babylon (2067–2025 B.C.); this code was asserted
by the king to have been delivered to him by Marduk. The connection
between religion and morality became continually closer throughout
ancient times.</p>
<p>Babylonian religion, unlike that of Egypt, was more concerned with
prosperity in this world than with happiness in the next. Magic,
divination, and astrology, though not peculiar to Babylonia, were more
developed there than elsewhere, and it was chiefly through Babylon that
they acquired their hold on later antiquity. From Babylon come some
things that belong to science: the division of the day into twenty-four
hours, and of the circle into 360 degrees; also the discovery of a cycle
in eclipses, which enabled lunar eclipses to be predicted with
certainty, and solar eclipses with some probability. This Babylonian
knowledge, as we shall see, was acquired by Thales.</p>
<p>The civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia were agricultural, and
those of surrounding nations, at first, were pastoral. A new element
came with the development of commerce, which was at first almost
entirely maritime. Weapons, until about 1000 B.C., were made of bronze,
and nations which did not have the necessary metals on their own
territory were obliged to obtain them by trade or piracy. Piracy was a
temporary expedient, and where social and political conditions were
fairly stable, commerce was found to be more profitable. In commerce,
the island of Crete seems to have been the pioneer. For about eleven
centuries, say from 2500 B.C. to 1400 B.C., an artistically advanced
culture, called the Minoan, existed in Crete. What survives of Cretan
art gives an impression of cheerfulness and almost decadent luxury, very
different from the terrifying gloom of Egyptian temples.</p>
<p>Of this important civilization almost nothing was known until the
excavations of Sir Arthur Evans and others. It was a maritime
civilization, in close touch with Egypt (except during the time of the
Hyksos). From Egyptian</p>
<p>pictures it is evident that the very considerable commerce between
Egypt and Crete was carried on by Cretan sailors; this commerce reached
its maximum about 1500 B.C. The Cretan religion appears to have had some
affinities with the religions of Syria and Asia Minor, but in art there
was more affinity with Egypt, though Cretan art was very original and
amazingly full of life. The centre of the Cretan civilization was the
so-called ‘palace of Minos’ at Knossos, of which memories lingered in
the traditions of classical Greece. The palaces of Crete were very
magnificent, but were destroyed about the end of the fourteenth century
B.C., probably by invaders from Greece. The chronology of Cretan history
is derived from Egyptian objects found in Crete, and Cretan objects
found in Egypt; throughout, our knowledge is dependent on archaeological
evidence.</p>
<p>The Cretans worshipped a goddess, or perhaps several goddesses. The
most indubitable goddess was the ‘Mistress of Animals’, who was a
huntress, and probably the source of the classical Artemis.3 She
apparently was also a mother; the only male deity, apart from the
‘Master of Animals’, is her young son. There is some evidence of belief
in an after life, in which, as in Egyptian belief, deeds on earth
receive reward or retribution. But on the whole the Cretans appear, from
their art, to have been cheerful people, not much oppressed by gloomy
superstitions. They were fond of bull-fights, at which female as well as
male toreadors performed amazing acrobatic feats. Sir Arthur Evans
thinks that the bull-fights were religious celebrations, and that the
performers belonged to the highest nobility, but this view is not
generally accepted. The surviving pictures are full of movement and
realism.</p>
<p>The Cretans had a linear script, but it has not been deciphered. At
home they were peaceful, and their cities were unwalled; no doubt they
were defended by sea power.</p>
<p>Before the destruction of the Minoan culture, it spread, about 1600
B.C., to the mainland of Greece, where it survived, through gradual
stages of modification, until about 900 B.C. This mainland civilization
is called the Mycenaean; it is known through the tombs of kings, and
also through fortresses on hill-tops, which show more fear of war than
had existed in Crete. Both tombs and fortresses remained to impress the
imagination of classical Greece. The older art products in the palaces
are either actually of Cretan workmanship or closely akin to those of
Crete. The Mycenaean civilization, seen through a haze of legend, is
that which is depicted in Homer.</p>
<p>There is much uncertainty concerning the Mycenaeans. Did they owe
their civilization to being conquered by the Cretans? Did they speak
Greek, or were they an earlier indigenous race? No certain answer to
these questions is</p>
<p>possible, but there is evidence which makes it probable that they
were conquerors who spoke Greek, and that at least the aristocracy
consisted of fair-haired invaders from the North, who brought the Greek
language with them.4 The Greeks came to Greece in three successive
waves, first the Ionians, then the Achaeans, and last the Dorians. The
Ionians appear, though conquerors, to have adopted the Cretan
civilization pretty completely, as, later, the Romans adopted the
civilization of Greece. But the Ionians were disturbed, and largely
dispossessed, by their successors, the Achaeans. The Achaeans are known,
from the Hittite tablets found at Boghaz-Keui, to have had a large
organized empire in the fourteenth century B.C. The Mycenaean
civilization, which had been weakened by the warfare of the Ionians and
Achaeans, was practically destroyed by the Dorians, the last Greek
invaders. Whereas previous invaders had largely adopted the Minoan
religion; the Dorians retained the original Indo-European religion of
their ancestors. The religion of Mycenaean times, however, lingered on,
especially in the lower classes, and the religion of classical Greece
was a blend of the two. In fact some of the classical goddesses were of
Mycenaean origin.</p>
<p>Although the above account seems probable, it must be remembered that
we do not know whether the Mycenaeans were Greeks or not. What we do
know is that their civilization decayed, that about the time when it
ended iron superseded bronze, and that for some time sea supremacy
passed to the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>Both during the later part of the Mycenaean age and after its end,
some of the invaders settled down and became agriculturists, while some
pushed on, first into the islands and Asia Minor, then into Sicily and
southern Italy, where they founded cities that lived by maritime
commerce. It was in these maritime cities that the Greeks first made
qualitatively new contributions to civilization; the supremacy of Athens
came later, and was equally associated, when it came, with naval
power.</p>
<p>The mainland of Greece is mountainous and largely infertile. There
are, however, many fertile valleys, with easy access to the sea, but cut
off by the mountains from easy land communication with each other. In
these valleys little separate communities grew up, living by
agriculture, and centring round a town, generally close to the sea. In
such circumstances it was natural that, as soon as the population of any
community grew too great for its internal resources, those who could not
live on the land should take to seafaring. The cities of the mainland
founded colonies, often in places where it was much easier to find
subsistence than it had been at home. Thus in the earliest historical
period the Greeks of Asia Minor, Sicily, and Italy were much richer than
those of the Greek mainland.</p>
<p>The social system was very different in different parts of Greece. In
Sparta, a small aristocracy subsisted on the labour of oppressed serfs
of a different race; in the poorer agricultural regions, the population
consisted mainly of farmers cultivating their own land with the help of
their families. But where commerce and industry flourished, the free
citizens grew rich by the employment of slaves—male in the mines, female
in the textile industry. These slaves were, in Ionia, of the surrounding
barbarian population, and were, as a rule, first acquired in war. With
increasing wealth went increasing isolation of respectable women, who in
later times had little part in the civilized aspects of Greek life
except in Sparta and Lesbos.</p>
<p>There was a very general development, first from monarchy to
aristocracy, then to an alternation of tyranny and democracy. The kings
were not absolute, like those of Egypt and Babylonia; they were advised
by a Council of Elders, and could not transgress custom with impunity.
‘Tyranny’ did not mean necessarily bad government, but only the rule of
a man whose claim to power was not hereditary. ‘Democracy’ meant
government by all the citizens, among whom slaves and women were not
included. The early tyrants, like the Medici, acquired their power
through being the richest members of their respective plutocracies.
Often the source of their wealth was the ownership of gold and silver
mines, made the more profitable by the new institution of coinage, which
came from the kingdom of Lydia, adjacent to Ionia.5 Coinage seems to
have been invented shortly before 700 B.C.</p>
<p>One of the most important results, to the Greeks, of commerce or
piracy—at fist the two are scarcely distinct—was the acquisition of the
art of writing. Although writing had existed for thousands of years in
Egypt and Babylonia, and the Minoan Cretans had a script now known to be
a form of Greek, the date when the Greeks acquired alphabetic writing is
uncertain. They learnt the art from the Phoenicians, who, like the other
inhabitants of Syria, were exposed to both Egyptian and Babylonian
influences, and who held the supremacy in maritime commerce until the
rise of the Greek cities of Ionia, Italy, and Sicily. In the fourteenth
century, writing to Ikhnaton (the heretic king of Egypt), Syrians still
used the Babylonian cuneiform; but Hiram of Tyre (969–936) used the
Phoenician alphabet, which probably developed out of the Egyptian
script. The Egyptians used, at first, a pure picture writing; gradually
the pictures, much conventionalized, came to represent syllables (the
first syllables of the names of the things pictured), and at last single
letters, on the principle of ’A was an Archer who shot at a frog.’6 This
last step, which was not taken with any completeness by the Egyptians
them</p>
<p>selves, but by the Phoenicians, gave the alphabet with all its
advantages. The Greeks, borrowing from the Phoenicians, altered the
alphabet to suit their language, and made the important innovation of
adding vowels instead of having only consonants. There can be no doubt
that the acquisition of this convenient method of writing greatly
hastened the rise of Greek civilization.</p>
<p>The first notable product of the Hellenic civilization was Homer.
Everything about Homer is conjectural, but there is a widely held
opinion that he was a series of poets rather than an individual.
According to those who hold this opinion, the Iliad and the Odyssey
between them took about two hundred years to complete, some say from 750
to 550 B.C.,7 while others hold that ‘Homer’ was nearly complete at the
end of the eighth century.8 The Homeric poems, in their present form,
were brought to Athens by Peisistratus, who reigned (with intermissions)
from 560 to 527 B.C. From his time onward, the Athenian youth learnt
Homer by heart, and this was the most important part of their education.
In some parts of Greece, notably in Sparta, Homer had not the same
prestige until a later date.</p>
<p>The Homeric poems, like the courtly romances of the later Middle
Ages, represent the point of view of a civilized aristocracy, which
ignores as plebeian various superstitions that are still rampant among
the populace. In much later times, many of these superstitions rose
again to the light of day. Guided by anthropology, many modern writers
have come to the conclusion that Homer, so far from being primitive, was
an expurgator, a kind of eighteenth century rationalizer of ancient
myths, holding up an upper-class ideal of urbane enlightenment. The
Olympian gods, who represent religion in Homer, were not the only
objects of worship among the Greeks, either in his time or later. There
were other darker and more savage elements in popular religion, which
were kept at bay by the Greek intellect at its best, but lay in wait to
pounce in moments of weakness or terror. In the time of decadence,
beliefs which Homer had discarded proved to have persisted, half buried,
throughout the classical period. This fact explains many things that
would otherwise seem inconsistent and surprising.</p>
<p>Primitive religion, everywhere, was tribal rather than personal.
Certain rites were performed, which were intended, by sympathetic magic,
to further the interests of the tribe, especially in respect of
fertility, vegetable, animal, and human. The winter solstice was a time
when the sun had to be encouraged not to go on diminishing in strength;
spring and harvest also called for appropriate ceremonies. These were
often such as to generate a great collective excitement, in which
individuals lost their sense of separateness and felt themselves at one
with the whole tribe. All over the world, at a certain stage</p>
<p>of religious evolution, sacred animals and human beings were
ceremonially killed and eaten. In different regions, this stage occurred
at very different dates. Human sacrifice usually lasted longer than the
sacrificial eating of human victims; in Greece it was not yet extinct at
the beginning of historical times. Fertility rites without such cruel
aspects were common throughout Greece; the Eleusinian mysteries, in
particular, were essentially agricultural in their symbolism.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that religion, in Homer, is not very religious.
The gods are completely human, differing from men only in being immortal
and possessed of superhuman powers. Morally, there is nothing to be said
for them, and it is difficult to see how they can have inspired much
awe. In some passages, supposed to be late, they are treated with
Voltairean irreverence. Such genuine religious feeling as is to be found
in Homer is less concerned with the gods of Olympus than with more
shadowy beings such as Fate or Necessity or Destiny, to whom even Zeus
is subject. Fate exercised a great influence on all Greek thought, and
perhaps was one of the sources from which science derived the belief in
natural law.</p>
<p>The Homeric gods were the gods of a conquering aristocracy, not the
useful fertility gods of those who actually tilled the soil. As Gilbert
Murray says:9</p>
<p>‘The gods of most nations claim to have created the world. The
Olympians make no such claim. The most they ever did was to conquer it….
And when they have conquered their kingdoms, what do they do? Do they
attend to the government? Do they promote agriculture? Do they practise
trades and industries? Not a bit of it. Why should they do any honest
work? They find it easier to live on the revenues and blast with
thunderbolts the people who do not pay. They are conquering chieftains,
royal buccaneers. They fight, and feast, and play, and make music; they
drink deep, and roar with laughter at the lame smith who waits on them.
They are never afraid, except of their own king. They never tell lies,
except in love and war.’</p>
<p>Homer’s human heroes, equally, are not very well behaved. The leading
family is the House of Pelops, but it did not succeed in setting a
pattern of happy family life.</p>
<p>’Tantalos, the Asiatic founder of the dynasty, began its career by a
direct offence against the gods; some said, by trying to cheat them into
eating human flesh, that of his own son Pelops. Pelops, having been
miraculously restored to life, offended in his turn. He won his famous
chariot-race against Oinomaos, king of Pisa, by the connivance of the
latter’s charioteer, Myrtilos, and then got rid of his confederate, whom
he had promised to reward, by flinging him into the sea. The curse
descended to his sons, Atreus and</p>
<p>Thyestes, in the form of what the Greeks called ate, a strong if not
actually irresistible impulse to crime. Thyestes corrupted his brother’s
wife and thereby managed to steal the “luck“ of the family, the famous
golden-fleeced ram. Atreus in turn secured his brother’s banishment, and
recalling him under pretext of a reconciliation, feasted him on the
flesh of his own children. The curse was now inherited by Atreus’ son
Agamemnon, who offended Artemis by killing a sacred stag, sacrificed his
own daughter Iphigenia to appease the goddess and obtain a safe passage
to Troy for his fleet, and was in turn murdered by his faithless wife
Klytaimnestra and her paramour Aigisthos, a surviving son of Thyestes.
Orestes, Agamemnon’s son, in turn avenged his father by killing his
mother and Aigisthos.’10</p>
<p>Homer as a finished achievement was a product of Ionia, i.e. of a
part of Hellenic Asia Minor and the adjacent islands. Some time during
the sixth century at latest, the Homeric poems became fixed in their
present form. It was also during this century that Greek science and
philosophy and mathematics began. At the same time events of fundamental
importance were happening in other parts of the world. Confucius,
Buddha, and Zoroaster, if they existed, probably belong to the same
century.11 In the middle of the century the Persian Empire was
established by Cyrus; towards its close the Greek cities of Ionia, to
which the Persians had allowed a limited autonomy, made a fruitless
rebellion, which was put down by Darius, and their best men became
exiles. Several of the philosophers of this period were refugees, who
wandered from city to city in the still unenslaved parts of the Hellenic
world, spreading the civilization that, until then, had been mainly
confined to Ionia. They were kindly treated in their wanderings.
Xenophanes, who flourished in the later part of the sixth century, and
who was one of the refugees, says: ‘This is the sort of thing we should
say by the fireside in the winter-time, as we lie on soft couches, after
a good meal, drinking sweet wine and crunching chickpeas: “Of what
country are you, and how old are you, good Sir? And how old were you
when the Mede appeared?“’ The rest of Greece succeeded in preserving its
independence at the battles of Salamis and Plataea, after which Ionia
was liberated for a time.12</p>
<p>Greece was divided into a large number of small independent states,
each consisting of a city with some agricultural territory surrounding
it. The level of civilization was very different in different parts of
the Greek world, and only a minority of cities contributed to the total
of Hellenic achievement.</p>
<p>Sparta, of which I shall have much to say later, was important in a
military sense, but not culturally. Corinth was rich and prosperous, a
great commercial centre, but not prolific in great men.</p>
<p>Then there were purely agricultural rural communities, such as the
proverbial Arcadia, which townsmen imagined to be idyllic, but which
really was full of ancient barbaric horrors.</p>
<p>The inhabitants worshipped Hermes and Pan, and had a multitude of
fertility cults, in which, often, a mere square pillar did duty in place
of a statue of the god. The goat was the symbol of fertility, because
the peasants were too poor to possess bulls. When food was scarce, the
statue of Pan was beaten. (Similar things are still done in remote
Chinese villages.) There was a clan of supposed were-wolves, associated,
probably, with human sacrifice and cannibalism. It was thought that
whoever tasted the flesh of a sacrificed human victim became a
were-wolf. There was a cave sacred to Zeus Lykaios (the wolf-Zeus); in
this cave no one had a shadow, and whoever entered it died within a
year. All this superstition was still flourishing in classical
times.13</p>
<p>Pan, whose original name (some say) was ‘Paon’, meaning the feeder or
shepherd, acquired his better-known title, interpreted as meaning the
All-God, when his worship was adopted by Athens in the fifth century,
after the Persian war.14</p>
<p>There was, however, in ancient Greece, much that we can feel to have
been religion as we understand the term. This was connected, not with
the Olympians, but with Dionysus, or Bacchus, whom we think of most
naturally as the somewhat disreputable god of wine and drunkenness. The
way in which, out of his worship, there arose a profound mysticism,
which greatly influenced many of the philosophers, and even had a part
in shaping Christian theology, is very remarkable, and must be
understood by anyone who wishes to study the development of Greek
thought.</p>
<p>Dionysus, or Bacchus, was originally a Thracian god. The Thracians
were very much less civilized than the Greeks, who regarded them as
barbarians. Like all primitive agriculturists, they had fertility cults,
and a god who promoted fertility. His name was Bacchus. It was never
quite clear whether Bacchus had the shape of a man or of a bull. When
they discovered how to make beer, they thought intoxication divine, and
gave honour to Bacchus. When, later, they came to know the vine and to
learn to drink wine, they thought even better of him. His functions in
promoting fertility in general became somewhat subordinate to his
functions in relation to the grape and the divine madness produced by
wine.</p>
<p>At what date his worship migrated from Thrace to Greece is not known,
but it seems to have been just before the beginning of historical times.
The cult of Bacchus was met with hostility by the orthodox, but
nevertheless it established itself. It contained many barbaric elements,
such as tearing wild animals to pieces and eating the whole of them raw.
It had a curious element of feminism. Respectable matrons and maids, in
large companies, would spend whole nights on the bare hills in dances
which stimulated ecstasy, and in an intoxication perhaps partly
alcoholic, but mainly mystical. Husbands found the practice annoying,
but did not dare to oppose religion. Both the beauty and the savagery of
the cult are set forth in the Bacchae of Euripides.</p>
<p>The success of Dionysus in Greece is not surprising. Like all
communities that have been civilized quickly, the Greeks, or at least a
certain proportion of them, developed a love of the primitive, and a
hankering after a more instinctive and passionate way of life than that
sanctioned by current morals. To the man or woman who, by compulsion, is
more civilized in behaviour than in feeling, rationality is irksome and
virtue is felt as a burden and a slavery. This leads to a reaction in
thought, in feeling, and in conduct. It is the reaction in thought that
will specially concern us, but something must first be said about the
reaction in feeling and conduct.</p>
<p>The civilized man is distinguished from the savage mainly by
prudence, or, to use a slightly wider term, forethought. He is willing
to endure present pains for the sake of future pleasures, even if the
future pleasures are rather distant. This habit began to be important
with the rise of agriculture; no animal and no savage would work in the
spring in order to have food next winter, except for a few purely
instinctive forms of action, such as bees making honey or squirrels
burying nuts. In these cases, there is no forethought; there is a direct
impulse to an act which, to the human spectator, is obviously going to
prove useful later on. True forethought only arises when a man does
something towards which no impulse urges him, because his reason tells
him that he will profit by it at some future date. Hunting requires no
forethought, because it is pleasurable; but tilling the soil is labour,
and cannot be done from spontaneous impulse.</p>
<p>Civilization checks impulse not only through forethought, which is a
self-administered check, but also through law, custom, and religion.
This check it inherits from barbarism, but it makes it less instinctive
and more systematic. Certain acts are labelled criminal, and are
punished, certain others, though not punished by law, are labelled
wicked, and expose those who are guilty of them to social disapproval.
The institution of private property brings with it the subjection of
women, and usually the creation of a slave class. On the one hand the
purposes of the community are enforced upon the individual, and, on the
other hand the individual, having acquired the habit of viewing his life
as a whole, increasingly sacrifices his present to his future.</p>
<p>It is evident that this process can be carried too far, as it is, for
instance, by the miser. But without going to such extremes prudence may
easily involve the loss of some of the best things in life. The
worshipper of Dionysus reacts against prudence. In intoxication,
physical or spiritual, he recovers an intensity of feeling which
prudence had destroyed; he finds the world full of delight and beauty,
and his imagination is suddenly liberated from the prison of every-day
preoccupations. The Bacchic ritual produced what was called
‘enthusiasm’, which means, etymologically, having the god enter into the
worshipper, who believed that he became one with the god. Much of what
is greatest in human achievement involves some element of
intoxication,15 some sweeping away of prudence by passion. Without the
Bacchic element, life would be uninteresting; with it, it is dangerous.
Prudence versus passion is a conflict that runs through history. It is
not a conflict in which we ought to side wholly with either party.</p>
<p>In the sphere of thought, sober civilization is roughly synonymous
with science. But science, unadulterated, is not satisfying; men need
also passion and art and religion. Science may set limits to knowledge,
but should not set limits to imagination. Among Greek philosophers, as
among those of later times, there were those who were primarily
scientific and those who were primarily religious; the latter owed much,
directly or indirectly, to the religion of Bacchus. This applies
especially to Plato, and through him to those later developments which
were ultimately embodied in Christian theology.</p>
<p>The worship of Dionysus in its original form was savage, and in many
ways repulsive. It was not in this form that it influenced the
philosophers, but in the spiritualized form attributed to Orpheus, which
was ascetic, and substituted mental for physical intoxication.</p>
<p>Orpheus is a dim but interesting figure. Some hold that he was an
actual man, others that he was a god or an imaginary hero.
Traditionally, he came from Thrace, like Bacchus, but it seems more
probable that he (or the movement associated with his name) came from
Crete. It is certain that Orphic doctrines contain much that seems to
have its first source in Egypt, and it was chiefly through Crete that
Egypt influenced Greece. Orpheus is said to have been a reformer who was
torn to pieces by frenzied Maenads actuated by Bacchic orthodoxy. His
addiction to music is not so prominent in the older forms of the legend
as it became later. Primarily he was a priest and a philosopher.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the teaching of Orpheus (if he existed), the
teaching of the Orphics is well known. They believed in the
transmigration of souls; they taught that the soul hereafter might
achieve eternal bliss or suffer eternal or temporary torment according
to its way of life here on earth. They</p>
<p>aimed at becoming ‘pure’, partly by ceremonies of purification,
partly by avoiding certain kinds of contamination. The most orthodox
among them abstained from animal food, except on ritual occasions when
they ate it sacramentally. Man, they held, is partly of earth, partly of
heaven; by a pure life the heavenly part is increased and the earthly
part diminished. In the end a man may become one with Bacchus, and is
called ‘a Bacchus’. There was an elaborate theology, according to which
Bacchus was twice born, once of his mother Semele, and once from the
thigh of his father Zeus.</p>
<p>There are many forms of the Dionysus myth. In one of them, Dionysus
is the son of Zeus and Persephone; while still a boy, he is torn to
pieces by Titans, who eat his flesh, all but the heart. Some say that
the heart was given by Zeus to Semele, others that Zeus swallowed it; in
either case, it gave rise to the second birth of Dionysus. The tearing
of a wild animal and the devouring of its raw flesh by Bacchae was
supposed to re-enact the tearing and eating of Dionysus by the Titans,
and the animal, in some sense, was an incarnation of the god. The Titans
were earth-born, but after eating the god they had a spark of divinity.
So man is partly of earth, partly divine, and Bacchic rites sought to
make him more nearly completely divine.</p>
<p>Euripides puts a confession into the mouth of an Orphic priest, which
is instructive:16</p>
<p>Lord of Europa’s Tyrian line,</p>
<p>Zeus-born, who holdest at thy feet</p>
<p>The hundred citadels of Crete,</p>
<p>I seek to Thee from that dim shrine,</p>
<p>Roofed by the Quick and Carven Beam,</p>
<p>By Chalyb steel and wild bull’s blood,</p>
<p>In flawless joints of Cypress wood</p>
<p>Made steadfast. There is one pure stream</p>
<p>My days have run. The servant I,</p>
<p>Initiate, of Idaean Jove;17</p>
<p>Where midnight Zagreus18 roves, I rove;</p>
<p>I have endured his thunder-cry;</p>
<p>Fulfilled his red and bleeding feasts;</p>
<p>Held the Great Mother’s mountain flame,</p>
<p>I am set free and named by name</p>
<p>A Bacchos of the Mailed Priests.</p>
<p>Robed in pure white I have borne me clean</p>
<p>From man’s vile birth and coffined clay,</p>
<p>And exiled from my lip alway</p>
<p>Touch of all meat where Life hath been.</p>
<p>Orphic tablets have been found in tombs, giving instructions to the
soul of the dead person as to how to find his way in the next world, and
what to say in order to prove himself worthy of salvation. They are
broken and incomplete; the most nearly complete (the Petelia tablet) is
as follows:</p>
<p>Thou shalt find on the left of the House of Hades a Well-spring.</p>
<p>And by the side thereof standing a white cypress.</p>
<p>To this well-spring approach not near.</p>
<p>But thou shalt find another by the Lake of Memory,</p>
<p>Cold water flowing forth, and there are Guardians before it,</p>
<p>Say: ’I am a child of Earth and of Starry Heaven;</p>
<p>But my race is of Heaven (alone). This ye know yourselves.</p>
<p>And lo, I am parched with thirst and I perish. Give me quickly</p>
<p>The cold water flowing forth from the Lake of Memory.’</p>
<p>And of themselves they will give thee to drink from the holy
well-spring,</p>
<p>And thereafter among the other heroes thou shalt have lordship….</p>
<p>Another tablet says:—‘Hail, Thou who hast suffered the suffering …
Thou art become God from Man.’ And yet in another:—‘Happy and Blessed
One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’</p>
<p>The well-spring of which the soul is not to drink is Lethe, which
brings forgetfulness; the other well-spring is Mnemosyne, remembrance.
The soul in the next world, if it is to achieve salvation, is not to
forget, but, on the contrary, to acquire a memory surpassing what is
natural.</p>
<p>The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol,
as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought
was that of ‘enthusiasm’, of union with the god. They believed
themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by
ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with
Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of
the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into
the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that
was in any degree religious.</p>
<p>Certain definitely Bacchic elements survived wherever Orphism had
influence. One of these was feminism, of which there was much in
Pythagoras, and which, in Plato, went so far as to claim complete
political equality for women. ‘Women as a sex,’ says Pythagoras, ‘are
more naturally akin to piety.’ Another Bacchic element was respect for
violent emotion. Greek tragedy grew out of the rites of Dionysus.
Euripides, especially, honoured the two chief gods of Orphism, Dionysus
and Eros. He has no respect for the coldly self-righteous well-behaved
man, who, in his tragedies, is apt to be driven mad or otherwise brought
to grief by the gods in resentment of his blasphemy.</p>
<p>The conventional tradition concerning the Greeks is that they
exhibited an admirable serenity, which enabled them to contemplate
passion from without, perceiving whatever beauty it exhibited but
themselves calm and Olympian. This is a very one-sided view. It is true,
perhaps, of Homer, Sophocles, and Aristotle, but it is emphatically not
true of those Greeks who were touched, directly or indirectly, by
Bacchic or Orphic influences. At Eleusis, where the Eleusinian mysteries
formed the most sacred part of Athenian State religion, a hymn was sung,
saying:</p>
<p>With Thy wine-cup waving high,</p>
<p>With Thy maddening revelry,</p>
<p>To Eleusis’ flowery vale,</p>
<p>Contest Thou—Bacchus, Paean, hail!</p>
<p>In the Bacchae of Euripides, the chorus of Maenads displays a
combination of poetry and savagery which is the very reverse of serene.
They celebrate the delight in tearing a wild animal limb from limb, and
eating it raw then and there:</p>
<p>O glad, glad on the Mountains</p>
<p>To swoon in the race outworn,</p>
<p>When the holy fawn-skin clings</p>
<p>And all else sweeps away,</p>
<p>To the joy of the quick red fountains,</p>
<p>The blood of the hill-goat torn,</p>
<p>The glory of wild-beast ravenings</p>
<p>Where the hill-top catches the day,</p>
<p>To the Phrygian, Lydian mountains</p>
<p>’Tis Bromios leads the way.</p>
<p>(Bromios was another of the many names of Dionysus.) The dance of the
Maenads on the mountain side was not only fierce; it was an escape from
the burdens and cares of civilization into the world of non-human beauty
and the freedom of wind and stars. In a less frenzied mood they
sing:</p>
<p>Will they ever come to me, ever again,</p>
<p>The long, long dances,</p>
<p>On through the dark till the dim stars wane?</p>
<p>Shall I feel the dew on my throat, and the stream</p>
<p>Of wind in my hair? Shall our white feet gleam</p>
<p>In the dim expanses?</p>
<p>O feet of the fawn to the greenwood fled,</p>
<p>Alone in the grass and the loveliness;</p>
<p>Leap of the hunted, no more in dread,</p>
<p>Beyond the snares and the deadly press.</p>
<p>Yet a voice still in the distance sounds,</p>
<p>A voice and a fear and a haste of hounds,</p>
<p>O wildly labouring, fiercely fleet,</p>
<p>Onward yet by river and glen—</p>
<p>Is it joy or terror, ye storm-swift feet?</p>
<p>To the dear lone lands untroubled of men,</p>
<p>Where no voice sounds, and amid the shadowy green</p>
<p>The little things of the woodland live unseen.</p>
<p>Before repeating that the Greeks were ‘serene’, try to imagine the
matrons of Philadelphia behaving in this manner, even in a play by
Eugene O’Neill.</p>
<p>The Orphic is no more ‘serene’ than the unreformed worshipper of
Dionysus. To the Orphic, life in this world is pain and weariness. We
are bound to a wheel which turns through endless cycles of birth and
death; our true life is the stars, but we are tied to earth. Only by
purification and renunciation and an ascetic life can we escape from the
wheel and attain at last to the ecstasy of union with God. This is not
the view of men to whom life is easy and pleasant. It is more like the
Negro spiritual:</p>
<p>I’m going to tell God all of my troubles</p>
<p>When I get home.</p>
<p>Not all of the Greeks, but a large proportion of them, were
passionate, unhappy, at war with themselves, driven along one road by
the intellect and along another by the passions, with the imagination to
conceive heaven and the wilful self-assertion that creates hell. They
had a maxim ‘nothing too much’, but they were in fact excessive in
everything—in pure thought, in poetry, in religion, and in sin. It was
the combination of passion and intellect that made them great, while
they were great. Neither alone would have transformed the world for all
future time as they transformed it. Their prototype in mythology is not
Olympian Zeus, but Prometheus, who brought fire from heaven and was
rewarded with eternal torment.</p>
<p>If taken as characterizing the Greeks as a whole, however, what has
just been said would be as one-sided as the view that the Greeks were
character ized by ‘serenity’. There were, in fact, two tendencies in
Greece, one passionate, religious, mystical, otherworldly, the other
cheerful, empirical, rationalistic, and interested in acquiring
knowledge of a diversity of facts. Herodotus represents this latter
tendency; so do the earliest Ionian philosophers; so, up to a point,
does Aristotle. Beloch (op. cit., I, 1, p. 434), after describing
Orphism, says:</p>
<p>‘But the Greek nation was too full of youthful vigour for the general
acceptance of a belief which denies this world and transfers real life
to the Beyond. Accordingly the Orphic doctrine remained confined to the
relatively narrow circle of the initiate, without acquiring the smallest
influence on the State religion, not even in communities which, like
Athens, had taken up the celebration of the mysteries into the State
ritual and placed it under legal protection. A full millennium was to
pass before these ideas—in a quite different theological dress, it is
true—achieved victory in the Greek world.’</p>
<p>It would seem that this is an overstatement, particularly as regards
the Eleusinian mysteries, which were impregnated with Orphism. Broadly
speaking, those who were of a religious temperament turned to Orphism,
while rationalists despised it. One might compare its status to that of
Methodism in England in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries.</p>
<p>We know more or less what an educated Greek learnt from his father,
but we know very little of what, in his earliest years, he learnt from
his mother, who was, to a great extent, shut out from the civilization
in which the men took delight. It seems probable that educated
Athenians, even in the best period, however rationalistic they may have
been in their explicitly conscious mental processes, retained from
tradition and from childhood a more primitive way of thinking and
feeling, which was always liable to prove victorious in times of stress.
For this reason, no simple analysis of the Greek outlook is likely to be
adequate.</p>
<p>The influence of religion, more particularly of non-Olympian
religion, on Greek thought was not adequately recognized until recent
times. A revolutionary book, Jane Harrison’s Prolegomena to the Study of
Greek Religion, emphasized both the primitive and the Dionysiac elements
in the religion of ordinary Greeks; F. M. Cornford’s From Religion to
Philosophy tried to make students of Greek philosophy aware of the
influence of religion on the philosophers, but cannot be wholly accepted
as trustworthy in many of its interpretations, or, for that matter, in
its anthropology.19 The most balanced statement known to me is in John
Burnet’s Early Greek Philosophy, especially chapter ii, ‘Science and
Religion’. A conflict between science and religion arose, he says, out
of ’the religious revival which swept over Hellas in the</p>
<p>sixth century B.C.,’ together with the shifting of the scene from
Ionia to the West. ‘The religion of continental Hellas’, he says, ’had
developed in a very different way from that of Ionia. In particular, the
worship of Dionysus, which came from Thrace, and is barely mentioned in
Homer, contained in germ a wholly new way of looking at man’s relation
to the world. It would certainly be wrong to credit the Thracians
themselves with any very exalted views; but there can be no doubt that,
to the Greeks, the phenomenon of ecstasy suggested that the soul was
something more than a feeble double of the self, and that it was only
when “out of the body“ that it could show its true nature…</p>
<p>’It looked as if Greek religion were about to enter on the same stage
as that already reached by the religions of the East; and, but for the
rise of science, it is hard to see what could have checked this
tendency. It is usual to say that the Greeks were saved from a religion
of the Oriental type by their having no priesthood; but this is to
mistake the effect for the cause. Priesthoods do not make dogmas, though
they preserve them once they are made; and in the earlier stages of
their development, the Oriental peoples had no priesthoods either in the
sense intended. It was not so much the absence of a priesthood as the
existence of the scientific schools that saved Greece.</p>
<p>‘The new religion—for in one sense it was new, though in another as
old as mankind—reached its highest point of development with the
foundation of the Orphic communities. So far as we can see, the original
home of these was Attica; but they spread with extraordinary rapidity,
especially in Southern Italy and Sicily. They were first of all
associations for the worship of Dionysus; but they were distinguished by
two features which were new among the Hellenes. They looked to
revelation as the source of religious authority, and they were organized
as artificial communities. The poems which contained their theology were
ascribed to the Thracian Orpheus, who had himself descended into Hades,
and was therefore a safe guide through the perils which beset the
disembodied soul in the next world.’</p>
<p>Burnet goes on to state that there is a striking similarity between
Orphic beliefs and those prevalent in India at about the same time,
though he holds that there cannot have been any contact. He then comes
on to the original meaning of the word ‘orgy’, which was used by the
Orphics to mean ‘sacrament’, and was intended to purify the believer’s
soul and enable it to escape from the wheel of birth. The Orphics,
unlike the priests of Olympian cults, founded what we may call
‘churches’, i.e. religious communities to which anybody, without
distinction of race or sex, could be admitted by initiation, and from
their influence arose the conception of philosophy as a way of life.</p>
