<h4 id="the-italian-renaissance">2 THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE</h4>
<p>The modern as opposed to the medieval outlook began in Italy with the
movement called the Renaissance. At first, only a few individuals,
notably Petrarch, had this outlook, but during the fifteenth century it
spread to the great majority of cultivated Italians, both lay and
clerical. In some respects, Italians of the Renaissance—with the
exception of Leonardo and a few others—had not the respect for science
which has characterized most important innovators since the seventeenth
century; with this lack is associated their very partial emancipation
from superstition, especially in the form of astrology. Many of them had
still the reverence for authority that medieval philosophers had had,
but they substituted the authority of the ancients for that of the
Church. This was, of course, a step towards emancipation, since the
ancients disagreed with each other, and individual judgment was required
to decide which of them to follow. But very few Italians of the
fifteenth century would have dared to hold an opinion for which no
authority could be found either in antiquity or in the teaching of the
Church.</p>
<p>To understand the Renaissance, it is necessary first to review
briefly the political condition of Italy. After the death of Frederick
II in 1250, Italy was, in the main, free from foreign interference until
the French king Charles VIII invaded the country in 1494. There were in
Italy five important States: Milan, Venice, Florence, the Papal Domain,
and Naples; in addition to these there were a number of small
principalities, which varied in their alliance with or subjection to
some one of the larger States. Until 1378, Genoa rivalled Venice in
commerce and naval power, but after that year Genoa became subject to
Milanese suzerainty.</p>
<p>Milan, which led the resistance to feudalism in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, fell, after the final defeat of the Hohenstaufen,
under the dominion of the Visconti, an able family whose power was
plutocratic, not feudal. They ruled for 170 years, from 1277 to 1447;
then, after three years of restored republican government, a new family,
that of the Sforza, connected with the Visconti, acquired the
government, and took the title of Dukes of Milan. From 1494 to 1535,
Milan was a battle-ground between the French and the Spaniards; the
Sforza allied themselves sometimes with one side, sometimes with the
other. During this period they were sometimes in exile, sometimes in
nominal control. Finally, in 1535, Milan was annexed by the Emperor
Charles V.</p>
<p>The Republic of Venice stands somewhat outside Italian politics,
especially in the earlier centuries of its greatness. It had never been
conquered by the barbarians, and at first regarded itself as subject to
the Eastern emperors. This tradition, combined with the fact that its
trade was with the East, gave it an independence of Rome, which still
persisted down to the time of the Council of Trent (1545), of which the
Venetian Paolo Sarpi wrote a very anti-papal history. We have seen how,
at the time of the fourth Crusade, Venice insisted upon the conquest of
Constantinople. This improved Venetian trade, which, conversely,
suffered by the Turkish conquest of Constantinople in 1453. For various
reasons, partly connected with food supply, the Venetians found it
necessary, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, to acquire
considerable territory on the mainland of Italy; this roused enmities,
and led finally, in 1509, to the formation of the League of Cambrai, a
combination of powerful States by which Venice was defeated. It might
have been possible to recover from this misfortune, but not from Vasco
da Gama’s discovery of the Cape route to India (1497–8). This, added to
the power of the Turks, ruined Venice, which, however, lingered on until
deprived of independence by Napoleon.</p>
<p>The constitution of Venice, which had originally been democratic,
became gradually less so, and was, after 1297, a close oligarchy. The
basis of political power was the Great Council, membership of which,
after that date, was hereditary, and was confined to the leading
families. Executive power belonged to the Council of Ten, which was
elected by the Great Council. The Doge, the ceremonial head of the
State, was elected for life; his nominal powers were very restricted,
but in practice his influence was usually decisive. Venetian diplomacy
was considered exceedingly astute, and the reports of Venetian
ambassadors were remarkably penetrating. Since Ranke, historians have
used them as among the best sources for knowledge of the events with
which they deal.</p>
<p>Florence was the most civilized city in the world, and the chief
source of the Renaissance. Almost all the great names in literature, and
the earlier as well as some of the later of the great names in art, are
connected with Florence; but for the present we are concerned with
politics rather than culture. In the thirteenth century, there were
three conflicting classes in Florence: the nobles, the rich merchants,
and the small men. The nobles, in the main, were Ghibelline, the other
two classes Guelf. The Ghibellines were finally defeated in 1266, and
during the fourteenth century the party of the small men got the better
of the rich merchants. The conflict, however, led not to a stable
democracy, but to the gradual growth of what the Greeks would have
called a ‘tyranny’. The Medici family, who ultimately became the rulers
of Florence, began as political bosses on the democratic side. Cosimo
dei Medici (1389–1464), the first of the family to achieve clear
pre-eminence, still had no official position; his power depended upon
skill in manipulating elections. He was astute, conciliatory when
possible, ruthless when necessary. He was succeeded, after a short
interval, by his grandson Lorenzo the Magnificent, who held power from
1469 till his death in 1492. Both these men owed their position to their
wealth, which they had acquired mainly in commerce, but also in mining
and other industries. They understood how to make Florence rich, as well
as themselves, and under them the city prospered.</p>
<p>Lorenzo’s son Pietro lacked his father’s merits, and was expelled in
1494. Then followed the four years of Savonarola’s influence, when a
kind of Puritan revival turned men against gaiety and luxury, away from
free-thought and towards the piety supposed to have characterized a
simpler age. In the end, however, mainly for political reasons,
Savonarola’s enemies triumphed, he was executed and his body was burnt
(1498). The Republic, democratic in intention but plutocratic in fact,
survived till 1512, when the Medici were restored. A son of Lorenzo, who
had become a cardinal at the age of fourteen, was elected Pope in 1513,
and took the title of Leo X. The Medici family, under the title of Grand
Dukes of Tuscany, governed Florence until 1737; but Florence meanwhile,
like the rest of Italy, had become poor and unimportant.</p>
<p>The temporal power of the Pope, which owed its origin to Pepin and
the forged Donation of Constantine, increased greatly during the
Renaissance; but the methods employed by the popes to this end robbed
the papacy of spiritual authority. The conciliar movement, which came to
grief in the conflict between the Council of Basel and Pope Eugenius IV
(1431–47), represented the most earnest elements in the Church; what was
perhaps even more important, it represented ecclesiastical opinion north
of the Alps. The victory of the popes was the victory of Italy, and (in
a lesser degree) of Spain. Italian civilization, in the latter half of
the fifteenth century, was totally unlike that of northern countries,
which remained medieval. The Italians were in earnest about culture, but
not about morals and religion; even in the minds of ecclesiastics,
elegant latinity would cover a multitude of sins. Nicholas V (1447–55),
the first humanist Pope, gave papal offices to scholars whose learning
he respected, regardless of other considerations; Lorenzo Valla, an
Epicurean, and the man who proved the Donation of Constantine to be a
forgery, who ridiculed the style of the Vulgate and accused St Augustine
of heresy, was made apostolic secretary. This policy of encouraging
humanism rather than piety or orthodoxy continued until the sack of Rome
in 1527.</p>
<p>Encouragement of humanism, though it shocked the earnest North,
might, from our point of view, be reckoned a virtue; but the warlike
policy and immoral life of some of the popes could not be defended from
any point of view except that of naked power politics. Alexander VI
(1492–1503) devoted his life as Pope to the aggrandizement of himself
and his family. He had two sons, the Duke of Gandia and Caesar Borgia,
of whom he greatly preferred the former. The duke, however, was
murdered, probably by his brother; the Pope’s dynastic ambitions
therefore had to be concentrated on Caesar. Together they conquered the
Romagna and Ancona, which were intended to form a principality for
Caesar; but when the Pope died Caesar was very ill, and therefore could
not act promptly. Their conquests consequently reverted to the patrimony
of St Peter. The wickedness of these two men soon became legendary, and
it is difficult to disentangle truth from falsehood as regards the
innumerable murders of which they are accused. There can be no doubt,
however, that they carried the arts of perfidy further than they had
ever been carried before. Julius II (1503–13), who succeeded Alexander
VI, was not remarkable for piety, but gave less occasion for scandal
than his predecessor. He continued the process of enlarging the papal
domain; as a soldier he had merit, but not as the Head of the Christian
Church. The Reformation, which began under his successor Leo X
(1513–21), was the natural outcome of the pagan policy of the
Renaissance popes.</p>
<p>The southern extremity of Italy was occupied by the Kingdom of
Naples, with which, at most times, Sicily was united. Naples and Sicily
had been the especial personal kingdom of the Emperor Frederick II; he
had introduced an absolute monarchy on the Mohammedan model, enlightened
but despotic, and allowing no power to the feudal nobility. After his
death in 1250, Naples and Sicily went to his natural son Manfred, who,
however, inherited the implacable hostility of the Church, and was
ousted by the French in 1266. The French made themselves unpopular, and
were massacred in the ‘Sicilian Vespers’ (1282), after which the kingdom
belonged to Peter III of Aragon and his heirs. After various
complications, leading to the temporary separation of Naples and Sicily,
they were reunited in 1443 under Alphonso the Magnanimous, a
distinguished patron of letters. From 1495 onwards, three French kings
tried to conquer Naples, but in the end the kingdom was acquired by
Ferdinand of Aragon (1502). Charles VIII, Louis XII, and Francis I,
kings of France, all had claims (not very good in law) on Milan and
Naples; all invaded Italy with temporary success, but all were
ultimately defeated by the Spaniards. The victory of Spain and the
Counter-Reformation put an end to the Italian Renaissance. Pope Clement
VII being an obstacle to the Counter-Reformation, and, as a Medici, a
friend of France, Charles V, in 1527, caused Rome to be sacked by a
largely Protestant army. After this, the popes became religious, and the
Italian Renaissance was at an end.</p>
<p>The game of power politics in Italy was unbelievably complex. The
minor princes, mostly self-made tyrants, allied themselves now with one
of the larger States, now with another; if they played the game
unwisely, they were exterminated. There were constant wars, but until
the coming of the French in 1494 they were almost bloodless: the
soldiers were mercenaries, who were anxious to minimize their vocational
risks. These purely Italian wars did not interfere much with trade, or
prevent the country from increasing in wealth. There was much
statecraft, but no wise statesmanship; when the French came, the country
found itself practically defenceless. French troops shocked the Italians
by actually killing people in battle. The wars between French and
Spaniards which ensued were serious wars, bringing suffering and
impoverishment. But the Italian States went on intriguing against each
other, invoking the aid of France or Spain in their internal quarrels,
without any feeling for national unity. In the end, all were ruined. It
must be said that Italy would inevitably have lost its importance, owing
to the discovery of America and the Cape route to the East; but the
collapse could have been less catastrophic, and less destructive of the
quality of Italian civilization.</p>
<p>The Renaissance was not a period of great achievement in philosophy,
but it did certain things which were essential preliminaries to the
greatness of the seventeenth century. In the first place, it broke down
the rigid scholastic system, which had become an intellectual strait
jacket. It revived the study of Plato, and thereby demanded at least so
much independent thought as was required for choosing between him and
Aristotle. In regard to both, it promoted a genuine and first-hand
knowledge, free from the glosses of Neoplatonists and Arabic
commentators. More important still, it encouraged the habit of regarding
intellectual activity as a delightful social adventure, not a cloistered
meditation aiming at the preservation of a predetermined orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle was hastened
by contact with Byzantine scholarship. Already at the Council of Ferrara
(1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western Churches, there
was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato
to Aristotle. Gemistus Pletho, an ardent Greek Platonist of doubtful
orthodoxy, did much to promote Platonism in Italy; so did Bessarion, a
Greek who became a cardinal. Cosimo and Lorenzo dei Medici were both
addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine
Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato. Cosimo died
listening to one of Plato’s dialogues. The humanists of the time,
however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to
produce anything original in philosophy.</p>
<p>The Renaissance was not a popular movement; it was a movement of a
small number of scholars and artists, encouraged by liberal patrons,
especially the Medici and the humanist popes. But for these patrons, it
might have had very much less success. Petrarch and Boccaccio, in the
fourteenth century, belong mentally to the Renaissance, but owing to the
different political conditions of their time their immediate influence
was less than that of the fifteenth-century humanists.</p>
<p>The attitude of Renaissance scholars to the Church is difficult to
characterize simply. Some were avowed free-thinkers, though even these
usually received extreme unction, making peace with the Church when they
felt death approaching. Most of them were impressed by the wickedness of
contemporary popes, but were nevertheless glad to be employed by them.
Guicciardini the historian wrote in 1529:</p>
<p>’No man is more disgusted than I am with the ambition, the avarice,
and the profligacy of the priests, not only because each of these vices
is hateful in itself, but because each and all of them are most
unbecoming in those who declare themselves to be men in special
relations with God, and also because they are vices so opposed to one
another, that they can only co-exist in very singular natures.
Nevertheless, my position at the Court of several popes forced me to
desire their greatness, for the sake of my own interest. But, had it not
been for this, I should have loved Martin Luther as myself, not in order
to free myself from the laws which Christianity, as generally understood
and explained, lays upon us, but in order to see this swarm of
scoundrels put back into their proper place, so that they may be forced
to live either without vices or without power.’1</p>
<p>This is delightfully frank, and shows clearly why the humanists could
not inaugurate a reformation. Moreover, most of them saw no half-way
house between orthodoxy and free-thought; such a position as Luther’s
was impossible for them, because they no longer had the medieval feeling
for the subtleties of theology. Masuccio, after describing the
wickedness of monks and nuns and friars, says: ’The best punishment for
them would be for God to abolish purgatory; they would then receive no
more alms, and would be forced to go back to their spades.’2 But it does
not occur to him, as to Luther, to deny purgatory, while retaining most
of the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>The wealth of Rome depended only in small part upon the revenues
obtained from the papal dominions; in the main, it was a tribute, drawn
from the whole Catholic world, by means of a theological system
which</p>
<p>maintained that the popes held the keys of heaven. An Italian who
effectively questioned this system risked the impoverishment of Italy,
and the loss of the position in the Western world. Consequently Italian
unorthodoxy, in the Renaissance, was purely intellectual, and did not
lead to schism, or to any attempt to create a popular movement away from
the Church. The only exception, and that a very partial one, was
Savonarola, who belonged mentally to the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Most of the humanists retained such superstitious beliefs as had
found support in antiquity. Magic and witchcraft might be wicked, but
were not thought impossible. Innocent VIII, in 1484, issued a bull
against witchcraft, which led to an appalling persecution of witches in
Germany and elsewhere. Astrology was prized especially by freethinkers;
it acquired a vogue which it had not had since ancient times. The first
effect of emancipation from the Church was not to make men think
rationally, but to open their minds to every sort of antique
nonsense.</p>
<p>Morally, the first effect of emancipation was equally disastrous. The
old moral rules ceased to be respected; most of the rulers of States had
acquired their position by treachery, and retained it by ruthless
cruelty. When cardinals were invited to dine at the coronation of a
pope, they brought their own wine and their own cup-bearer, for fear of
poison.3 Except Savonarola, hardly any Italian of the period risked
anything for a public object. The evils of papal corruption were
obvious, but nothing was done about them. The desirability of Italian
unity was evident, but the rulers were incapable of combination. The
danger of foreign domination was imminent, yet every Italian ruler was
prepared to invoke the aid of any foreign power, even the Turk, in any
dispute with any other Italian ruler. I cannot think of any crime,
except the destruction of ancient manuscripts, of which the men of the
Renaissance were not frequently guilty.</p>
<p>Outside the sphere of morals, the Renaissance had great merits. In
architecture, painting, and poetry, it has remained renowned. It
produced very great men, such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, and
Machiavelli. It liberated educated men from the narrowness of medieval
culture, and, even while still a slave to the worship of antiquity, it
made scholars aware that a variety of opinions had been held by
reputable authorities on almost every subject. By reviving the knowledge
of the Greek world, it created a mental atmosphere in which it was again
possible to rival Hellenic achievements, and in which individual genius
could flourish with a freedom unknown since the time of Alexander. The
political conditions of the Renaissance favoured individual development,
but were unstable; the instability and the individualism were closely
connected, as in ancient Greece. A stable social system is
necessary,</p>
<p>but every stable system hitherto devised has hampered the development
of exceptional artistic or intellectual merit. How much murder and
anarchy are we prepared to endure for the sake of great achievements
such as those of the Renaissance? In the past, a great deal; in our own
time, much less. No solution of this problem has hitherto been found,
although increase of social organization is making it continually more
important.</p>
