<h4 id="anaxagoras">8 ANAXAGORAS</h4>
<p>The philosopher Anaxagoras, though not the equal of Pythagoras,
Heraclitus, or Parmenides, has nevertheless a considerable historical
importance. He was an Ionian, and carried on the scientific, rationalist
tradition of Ionia. He was the first to introduce philosophy to the
Athenians, and the first to suggest mind as the primary cause of
physical changes. He was born at Clazomenae, in Ionia, about the year
500 B.C., but he spent about thirty years of his life in Athens,
approximately from 462 to 432 B.C.</p>
<p>He was probably induced to come by Pericles, who was bent on
civilizing his fellow-townsmen. Perhaps Aspasia, who came from Miletus,
introduced him to Pericles. Plato, in the Phaedrus, says:</p>
<p>Pericles ‘fell in, it seems with Anaxagoras, who was a scientific
man; and satiating himself with the theory of things on high, and having
attained to a knowledge of the true nature of intellect and folly, which
were just what the discourses of Anaxagoras were mainly about, he drew
from that source whatever was of a nature to further him in the art of
speech.’</p>
<p>It is said that Anaxagoras also influenced Euripides, but this is
more doubtful.</p>
<p>The citizens of Athens, like those of other cities in other ages and
continents, showed a certain hostility to those who attempted to
introduce a higher level of culture than that to which they were
accustomed. When Pericles was growing old, his opponents began a
campaign against him by attacking his friends. They accused Pheidias of
embezzling some of the gold that was to be employed on his statues. They
passed a law permitting impeachment of those who did not practise
religion and taught theories about ‘the things on high’. Under this law,
they prosecuted Anaxagoras, who was accused of teaching that the sun was
a red-hot stone and the moon was earth. (The same accusation was
repeated by the prosecutors of Socrates, who made fun of them for being
out of date.) What happened is not certain, except that Anaxagoras had
to leave Athens. It seems probable that Pericles got him out of prison
and managed to get him away. He returned to Ionia, where he founded a
school. In accordance with his will, the anniversary of his death was
kept as a schoolchildren’s holiday.</p>
<p>Anaxagoras held that everything is infinitely divisible, and that
even the smallest portion of matter contains some of each element.
Things appear to be that of which they contain most. Thus, for example,
everything contains some fire, but we only call it fire if that element
preponderates. Like Empedocles, he argues against the void, saying that
the clepsydra or an inflated skin shows that there is air where there
seems to be nothing.</p>
<p>He differed from his predecessors in regarding mind (nous) as a
substance which enters into the composition of living things, and
distinguishes them from dead matter. In everything, he says, there is a
portion of everything except mind, and some things contain mind also.
Mind has power over all things that have life; it is infinite and
self-ruled, and is mixed with nothing. Except as regards mind,
everything, however small, contains portions of all opposites, such as
hot and cold, white and black. He maintained that snow is black (in
part).</p>
<p>Mind is the source of all motion. It causes a rotation, which is
gradually spreading throughout the world, and is causing the lightest
things to go to the circumference, and the heaviest to fall towards the
centre. Mind is uniform, and is just as good in animals as in man. Man’s
apparent superiority is due to the fact that he has hands; all seeming
differences of intelligence are really due to bodily differences.</p>
<p>Both Aristotle and the Platonic Socrates complain that Anaxagoras,
after introducing mind, makes very little use of it. Aristotle points
out that he only introduces mind as a cause when he knows no other.
Whenever he can, he gives a mechanical explanation. He rejected
necessity and chance as giving the origins of things; nevertheless,
there was no ‘Providence’ in his cosmology. He does not seem to have
thought much about ethics or religion; probably he was an atheist, as
his prosecutors maintained. All his predecessors influenced him, except
Pythagoras. The influence of Parmenides was the same in his case as in
that of Empedocles.</p>
<p>In science he had great merit. It was he who first explained that the
moon shines by reflected light, though there is a cryptic fragment in
Parmenides suggesting that he also knew this. Anaxagoras gave the
correct theory of eclipses, and knew that the moon is below the sun. The
sun and stars, he said, are fiery stones, but we do not feel the heat of
the stars because they are too distant. The sun is larger than the
Peloponnesus. The moon has mountains, and (he thought) inhabitants.</p>
<p>Anaxagoras is said to have been of the school of Anaximenes;
certainly he kept alive the rationalist and scientific tradition of the
Ionians. One does not find in him the ethical and religious
preoccupations which, passing from the Pythagoreans to Socrates and from
Socrates to Plato, brought an obscurantist bias into Greek philosophy.
He is not quite in the first rank, but he is important as the first to
bring philosophy to Athens, and as one of the influences that helped to
form Socrates.</p>
