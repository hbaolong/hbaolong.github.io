<h4 id="socrates">11 SOCRATES</h4>
<p>Socrates is a very difficult subject for the historian. There are
many men concerning whom it is certain that very little is known, and
other men concerning whom it is certain that a great deal is known; but
in the case of Socrates the uncertainty is as to whether we know very
little or a great deal. He was undoubtedly an Athenian citizen of
moderate means, who spent his time in disputation, and taught philosophy
to the young, but not for money, like the Sophists. He was certainly
tried, condemned to death, and executed in 399 B.C., at about the age of
seventy. He was unquestionably a well-known figure in Athens, since
Aristophanes caricatured him in The Clouds. But beyond this point we
become involved in controversy. Two of his pupils, Xenophon and Plato,
wrote voluminously about him, but they said very different things. Even
when they agree, it has been suggested by Burnet that Xenophon is
copying Plato. Where they disagree, some believe the one, some the
other, some neither. In such a dangerous dispute, I shall not venture to
take sides, but I will set out briefly the various points of view.</p>
<p>Let us begin with Xenophon, a military man, not very liberally
endowed with brains, and on the whole conventional in his outlook.
Xenophon is pained that Socrates should have been accused of impiety and
of corrupting the youth; he contends that, on the contrary, Socrates was
eminently pious and had a thoroughly wholesome effect upon those who
came under his influence. His ideas, it appears, so far from being
subversive, were rather dull and commonplace. This defence goes too far,
since it leaves the hostility to Socrates unexplained. As Burnet says
(Thales to Plato, p. 149): ‘Xenophon’s defence of Socrates is too
successful. He would never have been put to death if he had been like
that.’</p>
<p>There has been a tendency to think that everything Xenophon says must
be true, because he had not the wits to think of anything untrue. This
is a very invalid line of argument. A stupid man’s report of what a
clever man says is never accurate, because he unconsciously translates
what he hears into something that he can understand. I would rather be
reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than by a friend
innocent of philosophy. We cannot therefore accept what Xenophon says if
it either involves any difficult point in philosophy or is part of an
argument to prove that Socrates was unjustly condemned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some of Xenophon’s reminiscences are very convincing.
He tells (as Plato also does) how Socrates was continually occupied with
the problem of getting competent men into positions of power. He would
ask such questions as: ‘If I wanted a shoe mended, whom should I
employ?’ To which some ingenuous youth would answer: ‘A shoemaker, O
Socrates.’ He would go on to carpenters, coppersmiths, etc., and finally
ask some such question as ‘who should mend the Ship of State?’ When he
fell into conflict with the Thirty Tyrants, Critias, their chief, who
knew his ways from having studied under him, forbade him to continue
teaching the young, and added: ‘You had better be done with your
shoemakers, carpenters, and coppersmiths. These must be pretty well
trodden out at heel by this time, considering the circulation you have
given them’ (Xenophon, Memorabilia, Bk. I, chap. ii). This happened
during the brief oligarchic government established by the Spartans at
the end of the Peloponnesian War. But at most times Athens was
democratic, so much so that even generals were elected or chosen by lot.
Socrates came across a young man who wished to become a general, and
persuaded him that it would be well to know something of the art of war.
The young man accordingly went away and took a brief course in tactics.
When he returned, Socrates, after some satirical praise, sent him back
for further instruction (ibid., Bk. III, chap. i). Another young man he
set to learning the principles of finance. He tried the same sort of
plan on many people, including the war minister; but it was decided that
it was easier to silence him by means of the hemlock than to cure the
evils of which he complained.</p>
<p>With Plato’s account of Socrates, the difficulty is quite a different
one from what it is in the case of Xenophon, namely, that it is very
hard to judge how far Plato means to portray the historical Socrates,
and how far he intends the person called ‘Socrates’ in his dialogues to
be merely the mouthpiece of his own opinions. Plato, in addition to
being a philosopher, is an imaginative writer of great genius and charm.
No one supposes, and he himself does not seriously pretend, that the
conversations in his dialogues took place just as he records them.
Nevertheless, at any rate in the earlier dialogues, the conversation is
completely natural and the characters quite convincing. It is the
excellence of Plato as a writer of fiction that throws doubt on him as a
historian. His Socrates is a consistent and extraordinarily interesting
character, far beyond the power of most men to invent; but I think Plato
could have invented him. Whether he did so is of course another
question.</p>
<p>The dialogue which is most generally regarded as historical is the
Apology. This professes to be the speech that Socrates made in his own
defence at his trial—not, of course, a stenographic report, but what
remained in Plato’s memory some years after the event, put together and
elaborated with literary art. Plato was present at the trial, and it
certainly seems fairly clear that what is set down is the sort of thing
that Plato remembered Socrates as saying, and that the intention is,
broadly speaking, historical. This, with all its limitations, is enough
to give a fairly definite picture of the character of Socrates.</p>
<p>The main facts of the trial of Socrates are not open to doubt. The
prosecution was based upon the charge that ‘Socrates is an evil-doer and
a curious person, searching into things under the earth and above the
heaven; and making the worse appear the better cause, and teaching all
this to others.’ The real ground of hostility to him was, almost
certainly, that he was supposed to be connected with the aristocratic
party; most of his pupils belonged to this faction, and some, in
positions of power, had proved themselves very pernicious. But this
ground could not be made evident, on account of the amnesty. He was
found guilty by a majority, and it was then open to him, by Athenian
law, to propose some lesser penalty than death. The judges had to
choose, if they had found the accused guilty, between the penalty
demanded by the prosecution and that suggested by the defence. It was
therefore to the interest of Socrates to suggest a substantial penalty,
which the court might have accepted as adequate. He, however, proposed a
fine of thirty minae, for which some of his friends (including Plato)
were willing to go surety. This was so small a punishment that the court
was annoyed, and condemned him to death by a larger majority than that
which had found him guilty. Undoubtedly he foresaw the result. It is
clear that he had no wish to avoid the death penalty by concessions
which might seem to acknowledge his guilt.</p>
<p>The prosecutors were Anytus, a democratic politician; Meletus, a
tragic poet, ‘youthful and unknown, with lanky hair, and scanty beard
and a hooked nose’; and Lykon, an obscure rhetorician. (See Burnet,
Thales to Plato, p. 180.) They maintained that Socrates was guilty of
not worshipping the gods the State worshipped but introducing other new
divinities, and further that he was guilty of corrupting the young by
teaching them accordingly.</p>
<p>Without further troubling ourselves with the insoluble question of
the relation of the Platonic Socrates to the real man, let us see what
Plato makes him say in answer to this charge.</p>
<p>Socrates begins by accusing his prosecutors of eloquence, and
rebutting the charge of eloquence as applied to himself. The only
eloquence of which he is capable, he says, is that of truth. And they
must not be angry with him if he speaks in his accustomed manner, not in
‘a set oration, duly ornamented with words and phrases’.1 He is over
seventy, and has never appeared in a court of law until now; they must
therefore pardon his un-forensic way of speaking.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that, in addition to his formal accusers, he has a
large body of informal accusers, who, ever since the judges were
children, have gone about ‘telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who
speculated about the heavens above, and searched into the earth beneath,
and made the worse appear the better cause’. Such men, he says, are
supposed not to believe in the existence of the gods. This old
accusation by public opinion is more dangerous than the formal
indictment, the more so as he does not know who are the men from whom it
comes, except in the case of Aristophanes.2 He points out, in reply to
these older grounds of hostility, that he is not a man of science—‘I
have nothing to do with physical speculations’—that he is not a teacher,
and does not take money for teaching. He goes on to make fun of the
Sophists, and to disclaim the knowledge that they profess to have. What,
then, is ‘the reason why I am called wise and have such an evil
fame?’</p>
<p>The oracle of Delphi, it appears, was once asked if there were any
man wiser than Socrates, and replied that there was not. Socrates
professes to have been completely puzzled, since he knew nothing, and
yet a god cannot lie. He therefore went about among men reputed wise, to
see whether he could convict the god of error. First he went to a
politician, who ‘was thought wise by many, and still wiser by himself’.
He soon found that the man was not wise, and explained this to him,
kindly but firmly, ‘and the consequence was that he hated me’. He then
went to the poets, and asked them to explain passages in their writings,
but they were unable to do so. ‘Then I knew that not by wisdom do poets
write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration.’ Then he went to
the artisans, but found them equally disappointing. In the process, he
says, he made many dangerous enemies. Finally he concluded that ‘God
only is wise; and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of
men is worth little or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is
only using my name by way of illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is
the wisest, who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth
nothing.’ This business of showing up pretenders to wisdom takes up all
his time, and has left him in utter poverty, but he feels it a duty to
vindicate the oracle.</p>
<p>Young men of the richer classes, he says, having not much to do,
enjoy listening to him exposing people, and proceed to do likewise, thus
increasing the number of his enemies. ‘For they do not like to confess
that their pretence of knowledge has been detected.’ So much for the
first class of accusers.</p>
<p>Socrates now proceeds to examine his prosecutor Meletus, ‘that good
man and true lover of his country, as he calls himself’. He asks who are
the people who improve the young. Meletus first mentions the judges;
then, under pressure, is driven, step by step, to say that every
Athenian except Socrates improves the young; whereupon Socrates
congratulates the city on its good fortune. Next, he points out that
good men are better to live among than bad men, and therefore he cannot
be so foolish as to corrupt his fellow-citizens intentionally; but if
unintentionally, then Meletus should instruct him, not prosecute
him.</p>
<p>The indictment had said that Socrates not only denied the gods of the
State, but introduced other gods of his own; Meletus, however, says that
Socrates is a complete atheist, and adds: ‘He says that the sun is stone
and the moon earth.’ Socrates replies that Meletus seems to think he is
prosecuting Anaxagoras, whose views may be heard in the theatre for one
drachma (presumably in the plays of Euripides). Socrates of course
points out that this new accusation of complete atheism contradicts the
indictment, and then passes on to more general considerations.</p>
<p>The rest of the Apology is essentially religious in tone. He has been
a soldier, and has remained at his post, as he was ordered to do. Now
‘God orders me to fulfil the philosopher’s mission of searching into
myself and other men,’ and it would be as shameful to desert his post
now as in time of battle. Fear of death is not wisdom, since no one
knows whether death may not be the greater good. If he were offered his
life on condition of ceasing to speculate as he has done hitherto, he
would reply: ‘Men of Athens, I honour and love you; but I shall obey God
rather than you,3 and while I have life and strength I shall never cease
from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting any one whom I
meet…. For know that this is the command of God; and I believe that no
greater good has ever happened in the State than my service to the God.’
He goes on:</p>
<p>I have something more to say, at which you may be inclined to cry
out; but I believe that to hear me will be good for you, and therefore I
beg that you will not cry out. I would have you know, that if you kill
such a one as I am, you will injure yourselves more than you will injure
me. Nothing will injure me, not Meletus nor yet Anytus—they cannot, for
a bad man is not permitted to injure a better than himself. I do not
deny that Anytus may perhaps kill him, or drive him into exile, or
deprive him of civil rights; and he may imagine, and others may imagine,
that he is inflicting a great injury upon him: but there I do not agree.
For the evil of doing as he is doing—the evil of unjustly taking away
the life of another—is greater far.</p>
<p>It is for the sake of his judges, he says, not for his own sake, that
he is pleading. He is a gad-fly, given to the State by God, and it will
not be easy to find another like him. ‘I dare say you may feel out of
temper (like a person who is suddenly awakened from sleep), and you
think that you might easily strike me dead as Anytus advises, and then
you would sleep on for the remainder of your lives, unless God in his
care of you sent you another gad-fly.’</p>
<p>Why has he only gone about in private, and not given advice on public
affairs? ‘You have heard me speak at sundry times and in diverse places
of an oracle or sign which comes to me, and is the divinity which
Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign, which is a kind of
voice, first began to come to me when I was a child; it always forbids
but never commands me to do anything which I am going to do. This is
what deters me from being a politician.’ He goes on to say that in
politics no honest man can live long. He gives two instances in which he
was unavoidably mixed up in public affairs: in the first, he resisted
the democracy; in the second, the Thirty Tyrants, in each case when the
authorities were acting illegally.</p>
<p>He points out that among those present are many former pupils of his,
and fathers and brothers of pupils; not one of these has been produced
by the prosecution to testify that he corrupts the young. (This is
almost the only argument in the Apology that a lawyer for the defence
would sanction.) He refuses to follow the custom of producing his
weeping children in court, to soften the hearts of the judges; such
scenes, he says, make the accused and the city alike ridiculous. It is
his business to convince the judges, not to ask a favour of them.</p>
<p>After the verdict, and the rejection of the alternative penalty of
thirty minae (in connection with which Socrates names Plato as one among
his sureties, and present in court), he makes one final speech.</p>
<p>And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you;
for I am about to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with
prophetic power. And I prophesy to you, who are my murderers, that
immediately after my departure punishment far heavier than you have
inflicted on me will surely await you…. If you think that by killing men
you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives, you are
mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or
honourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling
others, but to be improving yourselves.</p>
<p>He then turns to those of his judges who have voted for acquittal,
and tells them that, in all that he has done that day, his oracle has
never opposed him, though on other occasions it has often stopped him in
the middle of a speech. This, he says, ‘is an intimation that what has
happened to me is a good, and that those of us who think death is an
evil are in error’. For either death is a dreamless sleep—which is
plainly good—or the soul migrates to another world. And ‘what would not
a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and
Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die and die again.’ In the next
world, he will converse with others who have suffered death unjustly,
and, above all, he will continue his search after knowledge. ’In another
world they do not put a man to death for asking questions: assuredly
not. For besides being happier than we are, they will be immortal, if
what is said is true….</p>
<p>‘The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways—I to die, and
you to live. Which is better God only knows.’</p>
<p>The Apology gives a clear picture of a man of a certain type: a man
very sure of himself, high-minded, indifferent to worldly success,
believing that he is guided by a divine voice, and persuaded that clear
thinking is the most important requisite for right living. Except in
this last point, he resembles a Christian martyr or a Puritan. In the
final passage, where he considers what happens after death, it is
impossible not to feel that he firmly believes in immortality, and that
his professed uncertainty is only assumed. He is not troubled, like the
Christians, by fears of eternal torment: he has no doubt that his life
in the next world will be a happy one. In the Phaedo, the Platonic
Socrates gives reasons for the belief in immortality; whether these were
the reasons that influenced the historical Socrates, it is impossible to
say.</p>
<p>There seems hardly any doubt that the historical Socrates claimed to
be guided by an oracle or daimon. Whether this was analogous to what a
Christian would call the voice of conscience, or whether it appeared to
him as an actual voice, it is impossible to know. Joan of Arc was
inspired by voices, which are a common symptom of insanity. Socrates was
liable to cataleptic trances; at least, that seems the natural
explanation of such an incident as occurred once when he was on military
service:</p>
<p>One morning he was thinking about something which he could not
resolve; he would not give it up, but continued thinking from early dawn
until noon—there he stood fixed in thought; and at noon attention was
drawn to him, and the rumour ran through the wondering crowd that
Socrates had been standing and thinking about something ever since the
break of day. At last, in the evening after supper, some Ionians out of
curiosity (I should explain that this occurred not in winter but in
summer), brought out their mats and slept in the open air that they
might watch him and see whether he would stand all night. There he stood
until the following morning; and with the return of light he offered up
a prayer to the sun, and went his way (Symposium, 220).</p>
<p>This sort of thing, in a lesser degree, was a common occurrence with
Socrates. At the beginning of the Symposium, Socrates and Aristodemus go
together to the banquet, but Socrates drops behind in a fit of
abstraction. When Aristodemus arrives, Agathon, the host, says, ‘what
have you done with Socrates?’ Aristodemus is astonished to find Socrates
not with him; a slave is sent to look for him, and finds him in the
portico of a neighbouring house. ‘There he is fixed,’ says the slave on
his return, ‘and when I call to him he will not stir.’ Those who know
him well explain that ‘he has a way of stopping anywhere and losing
himself without any reason’. They leave him alone, and he enters when
the feast is half over.</p>
<p>Every one is agreed that Socrates was very ugly; he had a snub nose
and a considerable paunch; he was ‘uglier than all the Silenuses in the
Satyric drama’ (Xenophon, Symposium). He was always dressed in shabby
old clothes, and went barefoot everywhere. His indifference to heat and
cold, hunger and thirst, amazed every one. Alcibiades in the Symposium,
describing Socrates on military service, says:</p>
<p>His endurance was simply marvellous when, being cut off from our
supplies, we were compelled to go without food—on such occasions, which
often happen in time of war, he was superior not only to me but to
everybody: there was no one to be compared to him…. His fortitude in
enduring cold was also surprising. There was a severe frost, for the
winter in that region is really tremendous, and everybody else either
remained indoors or if they went out had on an amazing quantity of
clothes, and were all well shod, and had their feet swathed in felt and
fleeces: in the midst of this, Socrates with his bare feet on the ice
and in his ordinary dress marched better than the other soldiers who had
shoes and they looked daggers at him because he seemed to despise
them.</p>
<p>His mastery over all bodily passions is constantly stressed. He
seldom drank wine, but when he did, he could out-drink anybody; no one
had ever seen him drunk. In love, even under the strongest temptations,
he remained ‘Platonic’, if Plato is speaking the truth. He was the
perfect Orphic saint: in the dualism of heavenly soul and earthly body,
he had achieved the complete mastery of the soul over the body. His
indifference to death at the last is the final proof of this mastery. At
the same time, he is not an orthodox Orphic; it is only the fundamental
doctrines that he accepts, not the superstitions and ceremonies of
purification.</p>
<p>The Platonic Socrates anticipates both the Stoics and the Cynics. The
Stoics held that the supreme good is virtue, and that a man cannot be
deprived of virtue by outside causes; this doctrine is implicit in the
contention of Socrates that his judges cannot harm him. The Cynics
despised worldly goods, and showed their contempt by eschewing the
comforts of civilization; this is the same point of view that led
Socrates to go barefoot and ill-clad.</p>
<p>It seems fairly certain that the preoccupations of Socrates were
ethical rather than scientific. In the Apology, as we saw, he says: ‘I
have nothing to do with physical speculations.’ The earliest of the
Platonic dialogues, which are generally supposed to be the most
Socratic, are mainly occupied with the search for definitions of ethical
terms. The Charmides is concerned with the definition of temperance or
moderation; the Lysis with friendship; the Laches with courage. In all
of these, no conclusion is arrived at, but Socrates makes it clear that
he thinks it important to examine such questions. The Platonic Socrates
consistently maintains that he knows nothing, and is only wiser than
others in knowing that he knows nothing; but he does not think knowledge
unobtainable. On the contrary, he thinks the search for knowledge of the
utmost importance. He maintains that no man sins wittingly, and
therefore only knowledge is needed to make all men perfectly
virtuous.</p>
<p>The close connection between virtue and knowledge is characteristic
of Socrates and Plato. To some degree, it exists in all Greek thought,
as opposed to that of Christianity. In Christian ethics, a pure heart is
the essential, and is at least as likely to be found among the ignorant
as among the learned. This difference between Greek and Christian ethics
has persisted down to the present day.</p>
<p>Dialectic, that is to say, the method of seeking knowledge by
question and answer, was not invented by Socrates. It seems to have been
first practised systematically by Zeno, the disciple of Parmenides; in
Plato’s dialogue Parmenides, Zeno subjects Socrates to the same kind of
treatment to which, elsewhere in Plato, Socrates subjects others. But
there is every reason to suppose that Socrates practised and developed
the method. As we saw, when Socrates is condemned to death he reflects
happily that in the next world he can go on asking questions for ever,
and cannot be put to death, as he will be immortal. Certainly, if he
practised dialectic in the way described in the Apology, the hostility
to him is easily explained: all the humbugs in Athens would combine
against him.</p>
<p>The dialectic method is suitable for some questions, and unsuitable
for others. Perhaps this helped to determine the character of Plato’s
inquiries, which were, for the most part, such as could be dealt with in
this way. And through Plato’s influence, most subsequent philosophy has
been bounded by the limitations resulting from his method.</p>
<p>Some matters are obviously unsuitable for treatment in this
way—empirical science, for example. It is true that Galileo used
dialogues to advocate his theories, but that was only in order to
overcome prejudice—the positive grounds for his discoveries could not be
inserted in a dialogue without great artificiality. Socrates, in Plato’s
works, always pretends that he is only eliciting knowledge already
possessed by the man he is questioning; on this ground, he compares
himself to a midwife. When, in the Phaedo and the Meno, he applies his
method to geometrical problems, he has to ask leading questions which
any judge would disallow. The method is in harmony with the doctrine of
reminiscence, according to which we learn by remembering that we knew in
a former existence. As against this view, consider any discovery that
has been made by means of the microscope, say the spread of diseases by
bacteria; it can hardly be maintained that such knowledge can be
elicited from a previously ignorant person by the method of question and
answer.</p>
<p>The matters that are suitable for treatment by the Socratic method
are those as to which we have already enough knowledge to come to a
right conclusion, but have failed, through confusion of thought or lack
of analysis, to make the best logical use of what we know. A question
such as ‘what is justice?’ is eminently suited for discussion in a
Platonic dialogue. We all freely use the words ‘just’ and ‘unjust’, and,
by examining the ways in which we use them, we can arrive inductively at
the definition that will best suit with usage. All that is needed is
knowledge of how the words in question are used. But when our inquiry is
concluded, we have made only a linguistic discovery, not a discovery in
ethics.</p>
<p>We can, however, apply the method profitably to a somewhat larger
class of cases. Wherever what is being debated is logical rather than
factual, discussion is a good method of eliciting truth. Suppose someone
maintains, for example, that democracy is good, but persons holding
certain opinions should not be allowed to vote, we may convict him of
inconsistency, and prove to him that at least one of his two assertions
must be more or less erroneous. Logical errors are, I think, of greater
practical importance than many people believe; they enable their
perpetrators to hold the comfortable opinion on every subject in turn.
Any logically coherent body of doctrine is sure to be in part painful
and contrary to current prejudices. The dialectic method—or, more
generally, the habit of unfettered discussion—tends to promote logical
consistency, and is in this way useful. But it is quite unavailing when
the object is to discover new facts. Perhaps ‘philosophy’ might be
defined as the sum-total of those inquiries that can be pursued by
Plato’s methods. But if this definition is appropriate, that is because
of Plato’s influence upon subsequent philosophers.</p>
