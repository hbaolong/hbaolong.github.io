<h4 id="the-epicureans">27 THE EPICUREANS</h4>
<p>The two great new schools of the Hellenistic period, the Stoics and
Epicureans, were contemporaneous in their foundation. Their founders,
Zeno and Epicurus, were born at about the same time, and settled in
Athens as heads of their respective sects within a few years of each
other. It is therefore a matter of taste which to consider first. I
shall begin with the Epicureans, because their doctrines were fixed once
for all by their founder, whereas Stoicism had a long development,
extending as far as the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who died in A.D.
180.</p>
<p>The main authority for the life of Epicurus is Diogenes Laertius, who
lived in the third century A.D. There are, however, two difficulties:
first, Diogenes Laertius is himself ready to accept legends of little or
no historical value; second, part of his Life consists in reporting the
scandalous accusations brought against Epicurus by the Stoics, and it is
not always clear whether he is asserting something himself or merely
mentioning a libel. The scandals invented by the Stoics are facts about
them, to be remembered when their lofty morality is praised; but they
are not facts about Epicurus. For instance, there was a legend that his
mother was a quack priestess, as to which Diogenes says:</p>
<p>‘They (apparently the Stoics) say that he used to go round from house
to house with his mother reading out the purification prayers, and
assisted his father in elementary teaching for a miserable
pittance.’</p>
<p>On this Bailey comments:1 ’If there is any truth in the story that he
went about with his mother as an acolyte, reciting the formulae of her
incanta</p>
<p>tions, he may well have been inspired in quite early years with the
hatred of superstition, which was afterwards so prominent a feature in
his teaching.’ This theory is attractive, but, in view of the extreme
unscrupulousness of later antiquity in inventing a scandal, I do not
think it can be accepted as having any foundation.2 There is against it
the fact that he had an unusually strong affection for his mother.3</p>
<p>The main facts of the life of Epicurus seem, however, fairly certain.
His father was a poor Athenian colonist in Samos; Epicurus was born in
342–1 B.C., but whether in Samos or in Attica is not known. In any case,
his boyhood was passed in Samos. He states that he took to the study of
philosophy at the age of fourteen. At the age of eighteen, about the
time of Alexander’s death, he went to Athens, apparently to establish
his citizenship, but while he was there the Athenian colonists were
turned out of Samos (322 B.C.). The family of Epicurus became refugees
in Asia Minor, where he rejoined them. At Taos, either at this time, or
perhaps earlier, he was taught philosophy by a certain Nausiphanes,
apparently a follower of Democritus. Although his mature philosophy owes
more to Democritus than to any other philosopher, he never expressed
anything but contempt for Nausiphanes, whom he alluded to as ‘The
Mollusc’.</p>
<p>In the year 311 he founded his school, which was first in Mitylene,
then in Lampsacus, and, from 307 onwards, in Athens where he died in
270–1 B.C.</p>
<p>After the hard years of his youth, his life in Athens was placid, and
was only troubled by his ill health. He had a house and a garden
(apparently separate from the house), and it was in the garden that he
taught. His three brothers, and some others had been members of his
school from the first, but in Athens his community was increased, not
only by philosophic disciples, but by friends and their children, slaves
and hetaerae. These last were made an occasion of scandal by his
enemies, but apparently quite unjustly. He had a very exceptional
capacity for purely human friendship, and wrote pleasant letters to the
young children of members of the community. He did not practise that
dignity and reserve in the expression of the emotions that was expected
of ancient philosophers; his letters are amazingly natural and
unaffected.</p>
<p>The life of the community was very simple, partly on principle, and
partly (no doubt) for lack of money. Their food and drink was mainly
bread and water, which Epicurus found quite satisfying. ‘I am thrilled
with pleasure in the body,’ he says, ’when I live on bread and water,
and I spit on luxurious</p>
<p>pleasures, not for their own sake, but because of the inconveniences
that follow them.’ The community depended financially, at least in part,
on voluntary contributions. ‘Send me some preserved cheese,’ he writes,
‘that when I like, I may have a feast.’ To another friend: ‘Send us
offerings for the sustenance of our holy body on behalf of yourself and
your children.’ And again: ‘The only contribution I require is that
which—ordered the disciples to send me, even if they be among the
Hyperboreans. I wish to receive from each of you two hundred and twenty
drachmae4 a year and no more.’</p>
<p>Epicurus suffered all his life from bad health, but learnt to endure
it with great fortitude. It was he, not a Stoic, who first maintained
that a man could be happy on the rack. Two letters written, one a few
days before his death, the other on the day of his death, show that he
had some right to this opinion. The first says: ‘Seven days before
writing this the stoppage became complete and I suffered pains such as
bring men to their last day. If anything happens to me, do you look
after the children of Metrodorus for four or five years, but do not
spend any more on them than you now spend on me.’ The second says: ‘On
this truly happy day of my life, as I am at the point of death, I write
this to you. The diseases in my bladder and stomach are pursuing their
course, lacking nothing of their usual severity: but against all this is
the joy in my heart at the recollection of my conversations with you. Do
you, as I might expect from your devotion from boyhood to me and to
philosophy, take good care of the children of Metrodorus.’ Metrodorus,
who had been one of his first disciples, was dead; Epicurus provided for
his children in his will.</p>
<p>Although Epicurus was gentle and kindly towards most people, a
different side of his character appeared in his relations to
philosophers, especially those to whom he might be considered indebted.
‘I suppose,’ he says, ’that these grumblers will believe me to be a
disciple of The Mollusc (Nausiphanes) and to have listened to his
teaching in company with a few bibulous youths. For indeed the fellow
was a bad man and his habits such as could never lead to wisdom.’5 He
never acknowledged the extent of his indebtedness to Democritus, and as
for Leucippus, he asserted that there was no such philosopher—meaning,
no doubt, not that there was no such man, but that the man was not a
philosopher. Diogenes Laertius gives a whole list of abusive epithets
that he is supposed to have applied to the most eminent of his
predecessors. With this lack of generosity towards other philosophers
goes another grave fault, that of dictatorial dogmatism. His followers
had to learn a kind of creed embodying his doctrines, which they were
not allowed to question. To the end, none of them added or modified
anything. When</p>
<p>Lucretius, two hundred years later, turned the philosophy of Epicurus
into poetry, he added, so far as can be judged, nothing theoretical to
the master’s teaching. Wherever comparison is possible, Lucretius is
found to agree closely with the original, and it is generally held that,
elsewhere, he may be used to fill in the gaps in our knowledge caused by
the loss of all of Epicurus’s three hundred books. Of his writings,
nothing remains except a few letters, some fragments, and a statement of
‘Principal Doctrines’.</p>
<p>The philosophy of Epicurus, like all those of his age (with the
partial exception of Scepticism), was primarily designed to secure
tranquillity. He considered pleasure to be the good, and adhered, with
remarkable consistency, to all the consequences of this view.
‘Pleasure,’ he said, ‘is the beginning and end of the blessed life.’
Diogenes Laertius quotes him as saying, in a book on The End of Life, ‘I
know not how I can conceive the good, if I withdraw the pleasures of
taste and withdraw the pleasures of love and those of hearing and
sight.’ Again: ‘The beginning and the root of all good is the pleasure
of the stomach; even wisdom and culture must be referred to this.’ The
pleasure of the mind, we are told, is the contemplation of pleasures of
the body. Its only advantage over bodily pleasures is that we can learn
to contemplate pleasure rather than pain, and thus have more control
over mental than over physical pleasures. ‘Virtue’, unless it means
‘prudence in the pursuit of pleasure’, is an empty name. Justice, for
example, consists in so acting as not to have occasion to fear other
men’s resentment—a view which leads to a doctrine of the origin of
society not unlike the theory of the Social Contract.</p>
<p>Epicurus disagrees with some of his hedonist predecessors in
distinguishing between active and passive pleasures, or dynamic and
static pleasures. Dynamic pleasures consist in the attainment of a
desired end, the previous desire having been accompanied by pain. Static
pleasures consist in a state of equilibrium, which results from the
existence of the kind of state of affairs that would be desired if it
were absent. I think one may say that the satisfying of hunger, while it
is in progress, is a dynamic pleasure, but the state of quiescence which
supervenes when hunger is completely satisfied is a static pleasure. Of
these two kinds, Epicurus holds it more prudent to pursue the second,
since it is unalloyed, and does not depend upon the existence of pain as
a stimulus to desire. When the body is in a state of equilibrium, there
is no pain, we should, therefore, aim at equilibrium and the quiet
pleasures rather than at more violent joys. Epicurus, it seems, would
wish, if it were possible, to be always in the state of having eaten
moderately, never in that of voracious desire to eat.</p>
<p>He is thus led, in practice, to regarding absence of pain, rather
than presence of pleasure, as the wise man’s goal.6 The stomach may be
at the root of</p>
<p>things, but the pains of stomach-ache outweigh the pleasures of
gluttony; accordingly Epicurus lived on bread, with a little cheese on
feast days. Such desires as those for wealth and honour are futile,
because they make a man restless when he might be contented. ‘The
greatest good of all is prudence; it is a more precious thing even than
philosophy.’ Philosophy, as he understood it, was a practical system
designed to secure a happy life; it required only common sense, not
logic or mathematics or any of the elaborate training prescribed by
Plato. He urges his young disciple and friend Pythocles to ‘flee from
every form of culture’. It was a natural consequence of his principles
that he advised abstinence from public life, for in proportion as a man
achieves power he increases the number of those who envy him and
therefore wish to do him injury. Even if he escapes outward misfortune,
peace of mind is impossible in such a situation. The wise man will try
to live unnoticed, so as to have no enemies.</p>
<p>Sexual love, as one of the most ‘dynamic’ of pleasures, naturally
comes under the ban. ‘Sexual intercourse,’ the philosopher declares,
‘has never done a man good and he is lucky if it has not harmed him.’ He
was fond of children (other people’s), but for the gratification of this
taste he seems to have relied upon other people not to follow his
advice. He seems, in fact, to have liked children against his better
judgment; for he considered marriage and children a distraction from
more serious pursuits. Lucretius, who follows him in denouncing love,
sees no harm in sexual intercourse provided it is divorced from
passion.</p>
<p>The safest of social pleasures, in the opinion of Epicurus, is
friendship. Epicurus, like Bentham, is a man who considers that all men,
at all times, pursue only their own pleasure, sometimes wisely,
sometimes unwisely; but, again like Bentham, he is constantly seduced by
his own kindly and affectionate nature into admirable behaviour from
which, on his own theories, he ought to have refrained. He obviously
liked his friends without regard to what he got out of them, but he
persuaded himself that he was as selfish as his philosophy held all men
to be. According to Cicero, he held that ‘friendship cannot be divorced
from pleasure, and for that reason must be cultivated, because without
it neither can we live in safety and without fear, nor even pleasantly’.
Occasionally, however, he forgets his theories more or less: ‘all
friendship is desirable in itself,’ he says, adding ’though it starts
from the need of help.’7</p>
<p>Epicurus, though his ethic seemed to others swinish and lacking in
moral exaltation, was very much in earnest. As we have seen, he speaks
of the community in the garden as ‘our holy body’; he wrote a book On
Holiness; he</p>
<p>had all the fervour of a religious reformer. He must have had a
strong emotion of pity for the sufferings of mankind, and an unshakeable
conviction that they would be greatly lessened if men would adopt his
philosophy. It was a valetudinarian’s philosophy, designed to suit a
world in which adventurous happiness had become scarcely possible. Eat
little, for fear of indigestion; drink little, for fear of next morning;
eschew politics and love and all violently passionate activities; do not
give hostages to fortune by marrying and having children; in your mental
life, teach yourself to contemplate pleasures rather than pains.
Physical pain is certainly a great evil, but if severe, it is brief, and
if prolonged, it can be endured by means of mental discipline and the
habit of thinking of happy things in spite of it. Above all, live so as
to avoid fear.</p>
<p>It was through the problem of avoiding fear that Epicurus was led
into theoretical philosophy. He held that two of the greatest sources of
fear were religion and the dread of death, which were connected, since
religion encouraged the view that the dead are unhappy. He therefore
sought a metaphysic which would prove that the gods do not interfere in
human affairs, and that the soul perishes with the body. Most modern
people think of religion as a consolation, but to Epicurus it was the
opposite. Supernatural interference with the course of nature seemed to
him a source of terror, and immortality fatal to the hope of release
from pain. Accordingly he constructed an elaborate doctrine designed to
cure men of the beliefs that inspire fear.</p>
<p>Epicurus was a materialist, but not a determinist. He followed
Democritus in believing that the world consists of atoms and the void;
but he did not believe, as Democritus did, that the atoms are at all
times completely controlled by natural laws. The conception of necessity
in Greece was, as we have seen, religious in origin, and perhaps he was
right in considering that an attack on religion would be incomplete if
it allowed necessity to survive. His atoms had weight, and were
continually falling; not towards the centre of the earth, but downwards
in some absolute sense. Every now and then, however, an atom, actuated
by something like free will, would swerve slightly from the direct
downward path,8 and so would come into collision with some other atom.
From this point onwards, the development of vortices, etc., proceeded in
much the same way as in Democritus. The soul is material, and is
composed of particles like those of breath and heat. (Epicurus thought
breath and wind different in substance from air; they were not merely
air in motion.) Soul-atoms are distributed throughout the body.
Sensation is due to thin films thrown off by bodies and travelling on
until they touch soul-atoms.</p>
<p>These films may still exist when the bodies from which they
originally proceeded have been dissolved; this accounts for dreams. At
death, the soul is dispersed, and its atoms, which of course survive,
are no longer capable of sensation, because they are no longer connected
with the body. It follows, in the words of Epicurus, that ‘Death is
nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and
that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.’</p>
<p>As for the gods, Epicurus firmly believes in their existence, since
he cannot otherwise account for the widespread existence of the idea of
gods. But he is persuaded that they do not trouble themselves with the
affairs of our human world. They are rational hedonists, who follow his
precepts, and abstain from public life; government would be an
unnecessary labour, to which, in their life of complete blessedness,
they feel no temptation. Of course, divination and augury and all such
practices are purely superstitious, and so is the belief in
Providence.</p>
<p>There is therefore no ground for the fear that we may incur the anger
of the gods, or that we may suffer in Hades after death. Though subject
to the powers of nature, which can be studied scientifically, we yet
have free will, and are, within limits, the masters of our fate. We
cannot escape death, but death, rightly understood, is no evil. If we
live prudently, according to the maxims of Epicurus, we shall probably
achieve a measure of freedom from pain. This is a moderate gospel, but
to a man impressed with human misery it sufficed to inspire
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Epicurus has no interest in science on its own account; he values it
solely as providing naturalistic explanations of phenomena which
superstition attributes to the agency of the gods. When there are
several possible naturalistic explanations, he holds that there is no
point in trying to decide between them. The phases of the moon, for
example, have been explained in many different ways; any one of these,
so long as it does not bring in the gods, is as good as any other, and
it would be idle curiosity to attempt to determine which of them is
true. It is no wonder that the Epicureans contributed practically
nothing to natural knowledge. They served a useful purpose by their
protest against the increasing devotion of the later pagans to magic,
astrology, and divination; but they remained, like their founder,
dogmatic, limited, and without genuine interest in anything, outside
individual happiness. They learnt by heart the creed of Epicurus, and
added nothing to it throughout the centuries during which the school
survived.</p>
<p>The only eminent disciple of Epicurus is the poet Lucretius (99–55
B.C.), who was a contemporary of Julius Caesar. In the last days of the
Roman Republic, free thought was the fashion, and the doctrines of
Epicurus were popular among educated people. The Emperor Augustus
introduced an archaistic revival of ancient virtue and ancient religion,
which caused the poem of Lucretius On the Nature of Things to become
unpopular, and it remained so until the Renaissance. Only one manuscript
of it survived the Middle Ages, and that narrowly escaped destruction by
bigots. Hardly any great poet has had to wait so long for recognition,
but in modern times his merits have been almost universally
acknowledged. For example, he and Benjamin Franklin were Shelley’s
favourite authors.</p>
<p>His poem sets forth in verse the philosophy of Epicurus. Although the
two men have the same doctrine, their temperaments are very different.
Lucretius was passionate, and much more in need of exhortations to
prudence than Epicurus was. He committed suicide, and appears to have
suffered from periodic insanity—brought on, so some averred, by the
pains of love or the unintended effects of a love philtre. He feels
towards Epicurus as towards a saviour, and applies language of religious
intensity to the man whom he regards as the destroyer of religion:9</p>
<p>When prostrate upon earth lay human life</p>
<p>Visibly trampled down and foully crushed</p>
<p>Beneath Religion’s cruelty, who meanwhile</p>
<p>Out of the regions of the heavens above</p>
<p>Showed forth her face, lowering on mortal men</p>
<p>With horrible aspect, first did a man of Greece</p>
<p>Dare to lift up his mortal eyes against her;</p>
<p>The first was he to stand up and defy her.</p>
<p>Him neither stories of the gods, nor lightnings,</p>
<p>Nor heaven with muttering menaces could quell,</p>
<p>But all the more did they arouse his soul’s</p>
<p>Keen valour, till he longed to be the first</p>
<p>To break through the fast-bolted doors of Nature.</p>
<p>Therefore his fervent energy of mind</p>
<p>Prevailed, and he passed onward, voyaging far</p>
<p>Beyond the flaming ramparts of the world,</p>
<p>Ranging in mind and spirit far and wide</p>
<p>Throughout the unmeasured universe; and thence</p>
<p>A conqueror he returns to us, bringing back</p>
<p>Knowledge both of what can and what cannot</p>
<p>Rise into being, teaching us in fine</p>
<p>Upon what principle each thing has its powers</p>
<p>Limited, and its deep-set boundary stone.</p>
<p>Therefore now has Religion been cast down</p>
<p>Beneath men’s feet, and trampled on in turn:</p>
<p>Ourselves heaven-high his victory exalts</p>
<p>The hatred of religion expressed by Epicurus and Lucretius is not
altogether easy to understand, if one accepts the conventional accounts
of the cheerfulness of Greek religion and ritual. Keats’s Ode on a
Grecian Urn, for instance, celebrates a religious ceremony, but not one
which could fill men’s minds with dark and gloomy terrors. I think
popular beliefs were very largely not of this cheerful kind. The worship
of the Olympians had less of superstitious cruelty than the other forms
of Greek religion, but even the Olympian gods had demanded occasional
human sacrifice until the seventh or sixth century B.C., and this
practice was recorded in myth and drama.10 Throughout the barbarian
world, human sacrifice was still recognized in the time of Epicurus;
until the Roman conquest, it was practised in times of crisis, such as
the Punic Wars, by even the most civilized of barbarian populations.</p>
<p>As was shown most convincingly by Jane Harrison, the Greeks had, in
addition to the official cults of Zeus and his family, other more
primitive beliefs associated with more or less barbarous rites. These
were to some extent incorporated in Orphism, which became the prevalent
belief among men of religious temperament. It is sometimes supposed that
Hell was a Christian invention, but this is a mistake. What Christianity
did in this respect was only to systematize earlier popular beliefs.
From the beginning of Plato’s Republic it is clear that the fear of
punishment after death was common in fifth-century Athens, and it is not
likely that it grew less in the interval between Socrates and Epicurus.
(I am thinking not of the educated minority, but of the general
population.) Certainly, also, it was common to attribute plagues,
earthquakes, defeats in war, and such calamities, to divine displeasure
or to failure to respect the omens. I think that Greek literature and
art are probably very misleading as regards popular beliefs. What should
we know of Methodism in the late eighteenth century if no record of the
period survived except its aristocratic books and paintings? The
influence of Methodism, like that of religiosity in the Hellenistic age,
rose from below; it was already powerful in the time of Boswell and Sir
Joshua Reynolds, although from their allusions to it the strength of its
influence is not apparent. We must not, therefore, judge of popular
religion in Greece by the pictures on ‘Grecian Urns’ or by the works of
poets and aristocratic philosophers. Epicurus was not aristocratic,
either by birth or through his associates; perhaps this explains his
exceptional hostility to religion.</p>
<p>It is through the poem of Lucretius that the philosophy of Epicurus
has chiefly become known to readers since the Renaissance. What has most
impressed them, when they were not professional philosophers, is the
contrast with Christian belief in such matters as materialism, denial
of</p>
<p>Providence, and rejection of immortality. What is especially striking
to a modern reader is to have these views—which, nowadays, are generally
regarded as gloomy and depressing—presented as a gospel of liberation
from the burden of fear. Lucretius is as firmly persuaded as any
Christian of the importance of true belief in matters of religion. After
describing how men seek escape from themselves when they are the victims
of an inner conflict, and vainly seek relief in change of place, he
says:11</p>
<p>Each man flies from his own self;</p>
<p>Yet from that self in fact he has no power</p>
<p>To escape: he clings to it in his own despite,</p>
<p>And loathes it too, because, though he is sick,</p>
<p>He perceives not the cause of his disease.</p>
<p>Which if he could but comprehend aright,</p>
<p>Each would put all things else aside and first</p>
<p>Study to learn the nature of the world,</p>
<p>Since ’tis our state during eternal time,</p>
<p>Not for one hour merely, that is in doubt,</p>
<p>That state wherein mortals will have to pass.</p>
<p>The whole time that awaits them after death.</p>
<p>The age of Epicurus was a weary age, and extinction could appear as a
welcome rest from travail of spirit. The last age of the Republic, on
the contrary, was not, to most Romans, a time of disillusionment: men of
titanic energy were creating out of chaos a new order, which the
Macedonians had failed to do. But to the Roman aristocrat who stood
aside from politics, and cared nothing for the scramble for power and
plunder, the course of events must have been profoundly discouraging.
When to this was added the affliction of recurrent insanity, it is not
to be wondered at that Lucretius accepted the hope of non-existence as a
deliverance.</p>
<p>But the fear of death is so deeply rooted in instinct that the gospel
of Epicurus could not, at any time, make a wide popular appeal; it
remained always the creed of a cultivated minority. Even among
philosophers, after the time of Augustus, it was, as a rule, rejected in
favour of Stoicism. It survived, it is true, though with diminishing
vigour, for six hundred years after the death of Epicurus; but as men
became increasingly oppressed by the miseries of our terrestrial
existence, they demanded continually stronger medicine from philosophy
or religion. The philosophers took refuge, with few exceptions, in
Neoplatonism; the uneducated turned to various Eastern superstitions,
and then, in continually increasing numbers, to Christianity, which,
in</p>
<p>its early form, placed all good in the life beyond the grave, thus
offering men a gospel which was the exact opposite of that of Epicurus.
Doctrines very similar to his, however, were revived by the French
philosophes at the end of the eighteenth century, and brought to England
by Bentham and his followers; this was done in conscious opposition to
Christianity, which these men regarded as hostilely as Epicurus regarded
the religions of his day.</p>
