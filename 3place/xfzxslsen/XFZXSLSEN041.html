<h4 id="john-the-scot">8 JOHN THE SCOT</h4>
<p>John the Scot, or Johannes Scotus, to which is sometimes added
Eriugena or Erigena,1 is the most astonishing person of the ninth
century; he would have been less surprising if he had lived in the fifth
or the fifteenth century. He was an Irishman, a Neoplatonist, an
accomplished Greek scholar, a Pelagian, a pantheist. He spent much of
his life under the patronage of Charles the Bald, king of France, and
though he was certainly far from orthodox, yet, so far as we know, he
escaped persecution. He set reason above faith, and cared nothing for
the authority of ecclesiastics; yet his arbitrament was invoked to
settle their controversies.</p>
<p>To understand the occurrence of such a man, we must turn our
attention first to Irish culture in the centuries following St Patrick.
Apart from the extremely painful fact that St Patrick was an Englishman,
there are two other scarcely less painful circumstances: first, that
there were Christians in Ireland before he went there, second, that,
whatever he may have done for Irish Christianity, it was not to him that
Irish culture was due. At the time of the invasion of Gaul (says a
Gaulish author), first by Attila, then by the Goths, Vandals, and
Alaric, ‘all the learned men on their side the sea fled, and in the
countries beyond sea, namely Ireland, and wherever else they betook
themselves, brought to the inhabitants of those regions an enormous
advance in learning’.2 If any of these men sought refuge in England, the
Angles and Saxons and Jutes must have mopped them up; but those who went
to Ireland succeeded, in combination with the missionaries, in
transplanting a great</p>
<p>deal of the knowledge and civilization that was disappearing from the
Continent. There is good reason to believe that, throughout the sixth,
seventh, and eighth centuries, a knowledge of Greek, as well as a
considerable familiarity with Latin classics, survived among the Irish.3
Greek was known in England from the time of Theodore, archbishop of
Canterbury (669–90), who was himself a Greek, educated at Athens; it may
also have become known, in the North, through Irish missionaries.
‘During the latter part of the seventh century,’ says Montague James,
‘it was in Ireland that the thirst for knowledge was keenest, and the
work of teaching was most actively carried on. There the Latin language
(and in a less degree the Greek) was studied from a scholar’s point of
view…. It was when, impelled in the first instance by missionary zeal,
and later by troubled conditions at home, they passed over in large
numbers to the Continent, that they became instrumental in rescuing
fragments of the literature which they had already learnt to value.’4
Heiric of Auxerre, about 876, describes this influx of Irish scholars:
’Ireland, despising the dangers of the sea, is migrating almost en masse
with her crowd of philosophers to our shores, and all the most learned
doom themselves to voluntary exile to attend the bidding of Solomon the
wise’—i.e. King Charles the Bald.5</p>
<p>The lives of learned men have at many times been perforce nomadic. At
the beginning of Greek philosophy, many of the philosophers were
refugees from the Persians; at the end of it, in the time of Justinian,
they became refugees to the Persians. In the fifth century, as we have
just seen, men of learning fled from Gaul to the Western Isles to escape
the Germans; in the ninth century, they fled back from England and
Ireland to escape the Scandinavians. In our own day, German philosophers
have to fly even further West to escape their compatriots. I wonder
whether it will be equally long before a return flight takes place.</p>
<p>Too little is known of the Irish in the days when they were
preserving for Europe the tradition of classical culture. This learning
was connected with monasteries, and was full of piety, as their
penitentials show; but it does not seem to have been much concerned with
theological niceties. Being monastic rather than episcopal, it had not
the administrative outlook that characterized Continental ecclesiastics
from Gregory the Great onwards. And being in the main cut off from
effective contact with Rome, it still regarded the Pope as he was
regarded in the time of St Ambrose, not as he came to be regarded later.
Pelagius, though probably a Briton, is thought by some to have been
an</p>
<p>Irishman. It is likely that his heresy survived in Ireland, where
authority could not stamp it out, as it did, with difficulty, in Gaul.
These circumstances do something to account for the extraordinary
freedom and freshness of John the Scot’s speculations.</p>
<p>The beginning and the end of John the Scot’s life are unknown; we
know only the middle period, during which he was employed by the king of
France. He is supposed to have been born about 800, and to have died
about 877, but both dates are guesswork. He was in France during the
papacy of Pope Nicholas I, and we meet again, in his life, the
characters who appear in connection with that Pope, such as Charles the
Bald and the Emperor Michael and the Pope himself.</p>
<p>John was invited to France by Charles the Bald about the year 843,
and was by him placed at the head of the court school. A dispute as to
predestination and free will had arisen between Gottschalk, a monk, and
the important ecclesiastic Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims. The monk was
predestinarian, the archbishop libertarian. John supported the
archbishop in a treatise On Divine Predestination, but his support went
too far for prudence. The subject was a thorny one; Augustine had dealt
with it in his writings against Pelagius, but it was dangerous to agree
with Augustine and still more dangerous to disagree with him explicitly.
John supported free will, and this might have passed uncensored; but
what roused indignation was the purely philosophic character of his
argument. Not that he professed to controvert anything accepted in
theology, but that he maintained the equal, or even superior, authority
of a philosophy independent of revelation. He contended that reason and
revelation are both sources of truth, and therefore cannot conflict; but
if they ever seem to conflict, reason is to be preferred. True religion,
he said, is true philosophy; but, conversely, true philosophy is true
religion. His work was condemned by two councils, in 855 and 859; the
first of these described it as ‘Scots porridge’.</p>
<p>He escaped punishment, however, owing to the support of the king,
with whom he seems to have been on familiar terms. If William of
Malmesbury is to be believed, the king, when John was dining with him,
asked: ‘What separates a Scot from a sot?’ and John replied, ‘Only the
dinner table.’ The king died in 877, and after this date nothing is
known as to John. Some think that he also died in that year. There are
legends that he was invited to England by Alfred the Great, that he
became abbot of Malmesbury or Athelney, and was murdered by the monks.
This misfortune, however, seems to have befallen some other John.</p>
<p>John’s next work was a translation from the Greek of the
pseudo-Dionysius. This was a work which had great fame in the early
Middle Ages. When St Paul preached in Athens, ‘certain men clave unto
him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite’ (Acts
xvii. 34). Nothing the schoolmen more is now known about this man, but
in the Middle Ages a great deal more was known. He had travelled to
France, and founded the abbey of St Denis; so at least it was said by
Hilduin, who was abbot just before John’s arrival in France. Moreover,
he was the reputed author of an important work reconciling Neoplatonism
with Christianity. The date of this work is unknown; it was certainly
before 500 and after Plotinus. It was widely known and admired in the
East, but in the West it was not generally known until the Greek Emperor
Michael, in 827, sent a copy to Louis the Pious, who gave it to the
above-mentioned Abbot Hilduin. He, believing it to have been written by
St Paul’s disciple, the reputed founder of his abbey, would have liked
to know what its contents were; but nobody could translate the Greek
until John appeared. He accomplished the translation, which he must have
done with pleasure, as his own opinions were in close accord with those
of the pseudo-Dionysius, who, from that time onward, had a great
influence on Catholic philosophy in the West.</p>
<p>John’s translation was sent to Pope Nicholas in 860. The Pope was
offended because his permission had not been sought before the work was
published, and he ordered Charles to send John to Rome—an order which
was ignored. But as to the substance, and more especially the
scholarship shown in the translation, he had no fault to find. His
librarian Anastasius, an excellent Grecian, to whom he submitted it for
an opinion, was astonished that a man from a remote and barbarous
country could have possessed such a profound knowledge of Greek.</p>
<p>John’s greatest work was called (in Greek) On the Division of Nature.
This book was what, in scholastic times, would have been termed
‘realist’; that is to say, it maintained, with Plato, that universals
are anterior to particulars. He includes in ‘Nature’ not only what is,
but also what is not. The whole of Nature is divided into four classes:
(1) what creates and is not created, (2) what creates and is created,
(3) what is created but does not create, (4) what neither creates nor is
created. The first, obviously, is God. The second is the (Platonic)
ideas, which subsist in God. The third is things in space and time. The
fourth, surprisingly, is again God, not as Creator, but as the End and
Purpose of all things. Everything that emanates from God strives to
return to Him; thus the end of all such things is the same as their
beginning. The bridge between the One and the many is the Logos.</p>
<p>In the realm of not-being he includes various things, for example,
physical objects, which do not belong to the intelligible world, and
sin, since it means loss of the divine pattern. That which creates and
is not created alone has essential subsistence; it is the essence of all
things. God is the beginning, middle, and end of things. God’s essence
is unknowable to men, and even to angels. Even to Himself He is, in a
sense, unknowable: ’God does not know himself, what He is, because He is
not a what; in a certain respect He is incomprehensible to Himself and
to every intellect.’6 In the being of things God’s being can be seen; in
their order, His wisdom; in their movement, His life. His being is the
Father, His wisdom the Son, His life the Holy Ghost. But Dionysius is
right in saying that no name can be truly asserted of God. There is an
affirmative theology, in which He is said to be truth, goodness,
essence, etc., but such affirmations are only symbolically true, for all
such predicates have an opposite, but God has no opposite.</p>
<p>The class of things that both create and are created embraces the
whole of the prime causes or prototypes, or Platonic ideas. The total of
these prime causes is the Logos. The world of ideas is eternal, and yet
created. Under the influence of the Holy Ghost, these prime causes give
rise to the world of particular things, the materiality of which is
illusory. When it is said that God created things out of ‘nothing’, this
‘nothing’ is to be understood as God Himself, in the sense in which He
transcends all knowledge.</p>
<p>Creation is an eternal process: the substance of all finite things is
God. The creature is not a being distinct from God. The creature
subsists in God, and God manifests Himself in the creature in an
ineffable manner. ‘The Holy Trinity loves Itself in us and in Itself;7
It sees and moves Itself.’</p>
<p>Sin has its source in freedom: it arose because man turned towards
himself instead of towards God. Evil does not have its ground in God,
for in God there is no idea of evil. Evil is not-being and has no
ground, for if it had a ground it would be necessary. Evil is a
privation of good.</p>
<p>The Logos is the principle that brings the many back to the One, and
man back to God; it is thus the Saviour of the world. By union with God,
the part of man that effects union becomes divine.</p>
<p>John disagrees with the Aristotelians in refusing substantiality to
particular things. He calls Plato the summit of philosophers. But the
first three of his kinds of being are derived indirectly from
Aristotle’s moving-not-moved, moving-and-moved, moved-but-not-moving.
The fourth kind of being in John’s system, that which neither creates
nor is created, is derived from the doctrine of Dionysius, that all
things return into God.</p>
<p>The unorthodoxy of John the Scot is evident from the above summary.
His pantheism, which refuses substantial reality to creatures, is
contrary to Christian doctrine. His interpretation of the creation out
of ‘nothing’ is not such as any prudent theologian could accept. His
Trinity, which closely resembles that of Plotinus, fails to preserve the
equality of the Three Persons, although he tries to safeguard himself on
this point. His independence of mind is shown by these heresies, and is
astonishing in the ninth century. His</p>
<p>Neoplatonic outlook may perhaps have been common in Ireland, as it
was among the Greek Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries. It may be
that, if we knew more about Irish Christianity from the fifth to the
ninth century, we should find him less surprising. On the other hand, it
may be that most of what is heretical in him is to be attributed to the
influence of the pseudo-Dionysius, who, because of his supposed
connection with St Paul, was mistakenly believed to be orthodox.</p>
<p>His view of creation as timeless is, of course, also heretical and
compels him to say that the account in Genesis is allegorical. Paradise
and the fall are not to be taken literally. Like all pantheists, he has
difficulties about sin. He holds that man was originally without sin,
and when he was without sin he was without distinction of sex. This, of
course, contradicts the statement ‘male and female created he them’.
According to John, it was only as the result of sin that human beings
were divided into male and female. Woman embodies man’s sensuous and
fallen nature. In the end, distinction of sex will again disappear, and
we shall have a purely spiritual body.8 Sin consists in misdirected
will, in falsely supposing something good which is not so. Its
punishment is natural; it consists in discovering the vanity of sinful
desires. But punishment is not eternal. Like Origen, John holds that
even the devils will be saved at last, though later than other
people.</p>
<p>John’s translation of the pseudo-Dionysius had a great influence on
medieval thought, but his magnum opus on the division of Nature had very
little. It was repeatedly condemned as heretical, and at last, in 1225,
Pope Honorius III ordered all copies of it to be burnt. Fortunately this
order was not efficiently carried out.</p>
