PHILOSOPHY</h4>
<p>A. THE HEREDITARY PRINCIPLE</p>
<p>In the years 1689 and 1690, just after the Revolution of 1688, Locke
wrote his two Treatises on Government, of which the second especially is
very important in the history of political ideas.</p>
<p>The first of these two treatises is a criticism of the doctrine of
hereditary power. It is a reply to Sir Robert Filmer’s Patriarcha: or
The Natural Power of Kings, which was published in 1680, but written
under Charles I. Sir Robert Filmer, who was a devout upholder of the
divine right of kings, had the misfortune to live till 1653, and must
have suffered acutely from the execution of Charles I and the victory of
Cromwell. But Patriarcha was written before these sad events, though not
before the Civil War, so that it naturally shows awareness of the
existence of subversive doctrines. Such doctrines, as Filmer points out,
were not new in 1640. In fact, both Protestant and Catholic divines, in
their contest with Catholic and Protestant monarchs respectively, had
vigorously affirmed the right of subjects to resist tyrannical princes,
and their writings supplied Sir Robert with abundant material for
controversy.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Filmer was knighted by Charles I, and his house is said to
have been plundered by the Parliamentarians ten times. He thinks it not
unlikely that Noah sailed up the Mediterranean and allotted Africa,
Asia, and Europe to Ham, Shem, and Japheth respectively. He held that,
by the English Constitution, the Lords only give counsel to the king,
and the Commons have even less power; the king, he says, alone makes the
laws, which proceed solely from his will. The king, according to Filmer,
is perfectly free from all human control, and cannot be bound by the
acts of his predecessors, or even by his own, for ‘impossible it is in
nature that a man should give a law unto himself’.</p>
<p>Filmer, as these opinions show, belonged to the most extreme section
of the Divine Right party.</p>
<p>Patriarcha begins by combating the ‘common opinion’ that ‘mankind is
naturally endowed and born with freedom from all subjection, and at
liberty to choose what form of government it please, and the power which
any one man hath over others was first bestowed according to the
discretion of the multitude.’ ‘This tenet,’ he says, ‘was first hatched
in the schools.’ The truth, according to him, is quite different; it is,
that originally God bestowed the kingly power upon Adam, from whom it
descended to his heirs, and ultimately reached the various monarchs of
modern times. Kings now, he assures us, ‘either are, or are to be
reputed, the next heirs to those first progenitors who were at first the
natural parents of the whole people’. Our first parent, it seems, did
not adequately appreciate his privilege as universal monarch, for ‘the
desire of liberty was the first cause of the fall of Adam’. The desire
of liberty is a sentiment which Sir Robert Filmer regards as
impious.</p>
<p>The claims made by Charles I, and by his protagonists on his behalf,
were in excess of what earlier times would have conceded to kings.
Filmer points out that Parsons, the English Jesuit, and Buchanan, the
Scotch Calvinist, who agree in almost nothing else, both maintain that
sovereigns can be deposed by the people for misgovernment. Parsons, of
course, was thinking of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, and Buchanan of
the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. The doctrine of Buchanan was
sanctioned by success, but that of Parsons was disproved by his
colleague Campion’s execution.</p>
<p>Even before the Reformation, theologians tended to believe in setting
limits to kingly power. This was part of the battle between the Church
and the State which raged throughout Europe during most of the Middle
Ages. In this battle, the State depended upon armed force, the Church
upon cleverness and sanctity. As long as the Church had both these
merits, it won; when it came to have cleverness only, it lost. But the
things which eminent and holy men had said against the power of kings
remained on record. Though intended in the interests of the Pope, they
could be used to support the rights of the people to self-government.
‘The subtle schoolmen,’ says Filmer, ‘to be sure to thrust down the king
below the Pope, thought it the safest course to advance the people above
the king, so that the papal power might take the place of the regal.’ He
quotes the theologian Bellarmine as saying that secular power is
bestowed by men (i.e. not by God), and ‘is in the people unless they
bestow it on a prince’; thus Bellarmine, according to Filmer, ‘makes God
the immediate author of a democratical estate’—which sounds to him as
shocking as it would to a modern plutocrat to say that God is the
immediate author of Bolshevism.</p>
<p>Filmer derives political power, not from any contract, nor yet from
any consideration of the public good, but entirely from the authority of
a father over his children. His view is: that the source of regal
authority is subjection of children to parents; that the patriarchs in
Genesis were monarchs; that kings are the heirs of Adam, or at least are
to be regarded as such; that the natural rights of a king are the same
as those of a father; and that, by nature, sons are never free of
paternal power, even when the son is adult and the parent is in his
dotage.</p>
<p>This whole theory seems to a modern mind so fantastic that it is hard
to believe it was seriously maintained. We are not accustomed to
deriving political rights from the story of Adam and Eve. We hold it
obvious that parental power should cease completely when the son or
daughter reaches the age of twenty-one, and that before that it should
be very strictly limited both by the State and by the right of
independent initiative which the young have gradually acquired. We
recognize that the mother has rights at least equal to those of the
father. But apart from all these considerations, it would not occur to
any modern man outside Japan to suppose that political power should be
in any way assimilated to that of parents over children. In Japan, it is
true, a theory closely similar to Filmer’s is held, and must be taught
by all professors and school-teachers. The Mikado can trace his descent
from the Sun Goddess, whose heir he is; other Japanese are also
descended from her, but belong to cadet branches of her family.
Therefore the Mikado is divine, and all resistance to him is impious.
This theory was, in the main, invented in 1868, but is now alleged in
Japan to have been handed down by tradition ever since the creation of
the world.</p>
<p>The attempt to impose a similar theory upon Europe—of which attempt
Filmer’s Patriarcha is part—was a failure. Why? The acceptance of such a
theory is in no way repugnant to human nature; for example, it was held,
apart from Japan, by the ancient Egyptians, and by the Mexicans and
Peruvians before the Spanish conquest. At a certain stage of human
development it is natural. Stuart England had passed this stage, but
modern Japan has not.</p>
<p>The defeat of theories of divine right, in England, was due to two
main causes. One was the multiplicity of religions; the other was the
conflict for power between the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the higher
bourgeoisie. As for religion: the king, since the reign of Henry VIII,
was the head of the Church of England, which was opposed both to Rome
and to most of the Protestant sects. The Church of England boasted of
being a compromise: the Preface to the Authorized Version begins ‘It
hath been the wisdom of the Church of England, ever since the first
compiling of her public liturgy, to keep the mean between two extremes.’
On the whole this compromise suited most people. Queen Mary and King
James II tried to drag the country over to Rome, and the victors in the
Civil War tried to drag it over to Geneva, but these attempts failed,
and after 1688 the power of the Church of England was unchallenged.
Nevertheless, its opponents survived. The Nonconformists, especially,
were vigorous men, and were numerous among the rich merchants and
bankers, whose power was continually increasing.</p>
<p>The theological position of the king was somewhat peculiar, for he
was not only head of the Church of England, but also of the Church of
Scotland. In England, he had to believe in bishops and reject Calvinism;
in Scotland, he had to reject bishops and believe in Calvinism. The
Stuarts had genuine religious convictions, which made this ambiguous
attitude impossible for them, and caused them even more trouble in
Scotland than in England. But after 1688 political convenience led kings
to acquiesce in professing two religions at once. This militated against
zeal, and made it difficult to regard them as divine persons. In any
case, neither Catholics nor Nonconformists could acquiesce in any
religious claims on behalf of the monarchy.</p>
<p>The three parties of king, aristocracy, and rich middle class made
different combinations at different times. Under Edward IV and Louis XI,
king and middle class combined against the aristocracy; under Louis XIV,
king and aristocracy combined against the middle class; in England in
1688, aristocracy and middle class combined against the king. When the
king had one of the other parties on his side, he was strong; when they
combined against him, he was weak.</p>
<p>For these reasons among others, Locke had no difficulty in
demolishing Filmer’s arguments.</p>
<p>So far as reasoning is concerned, Locke has, of course, an easy task.
He points out that, if parental power is what is concerned, the mother’s
power should be equal to the father’s. He lays stress on the injustice
of primo-geniture, which is unavoidable if inheritance is to be the
basis of monarchy. He makes play with the absurdity of supposing that
actual monarchs are, in any real sense, the heirs of Adam. Adam can have
only one heir, but no one knows who he is. Would Filmer maintain, he
asks, that, if the true heir could be discovered, all existing monarchs
should lay their crowns at his feet? If Filmer’s basis for monarchy were
accepted, all kings, except at most one, would be usurpers, and would
have no right to demand the obedience of their de facto subjects.
Moreover paternal power, he says, is temporary, and extends not to life
or property.</p>
<p>For such reasons, apart from more fundamental grounds, heredity
cannot, according to Locke, be accepted as the basis of legitimate
political power. Accordingly, in his Second Treatise on Government he
seeks a more defensible basis.</p>
<p>The hereditary principle has almost vanished from politics. During my
lifetime, the emperors of Brazil, China, Russia, Germany, and Austria
have disappeared, to be replaced by dictators who do not aim at the
foundation of a hereditary dynasty. Aristocracy has lost its privileges
throughout Europe, except in England, where they have become little more
than a historical form. All this, in most countries, is very recent, and
has much to do with the rise of dictatorships, since the traditional
basis of power has been swept away, and the habits of mind required for
the successful practice of democracy have not had time to grow up. There
is one great institution that has never had any hereditary element,
namely, the Catholic Church. We may expect the dictatorships, if they
survive, to develop gradually a form of government analogous to that of
the Church. This has already happened in the case of the great
corporations in America, which have, or had until Pearl Harbour, powers
almost equal to those of the government.</p>
<p>It is curious that the rejection of the hereditary principle in
politics has had almost no effect in the economic sphere in democratic
countries. (In totalitarian states, economic power has been absorbed by
political power.) We still think it natural that a man should leave his
property to his children; that is to say, we accept the hereditary
principle as regards economic power while rejecting it as regards
political power. Political dynasties have disappeared, but economic
dynasties survive. I am not at the moment arguing either for or against
this different treatment of the two forms of power; I am merely pointing
out that it exists, and that most men are unconscious of it. When you
consider how natural it seems to us that the power over the lives of
others resulting from great wealth should be hereditary, you will
understand better how men like Sir Robert Filmer could take the same
view as regards the power of kings, and how important was the innovation
represented by men who thought as Locke did.</p>
<p>To understand how Filmer’s theory could be believed, and how Locke’s
contrary theory could seem revolutionary, we have only to reflect that a
kingdom was regarded then as a landed estate is regarded now. The owner
of land has various important legal rights, the chief of which is the
power of choosing who shall be on the land. Ownership can be transmitted
by inheritance, and we feel that the man who has inherited an estate has
a just claim to all the privileges that the law allows him in
consequence. Yet at bottom his position is the same as that of the
monarchs whose claims Sir Robert Filmer defends. There are at the
present day in California a number of huge estates the title to which is
derived from actual or alleged grants by the king of Spain. He was only
in a position to make such grants (a) because Spain accepted views
similar to Filmer’s, and (b) because the Spaniards were able to defeat
the Indians in battle. Nevertheless we hold the heirs of those to whom
he made grants to have a just title. Perhaps in future this will seem as
fantastic as Filmer seems now.</p>
<p>B. THE STATE OF NATURE, AND NATURAL LAW</p>
<p>Locke begins his second Treatise on Government by saying that, having
shown the impossibility of deriving the authority of government from
that of a father, he will now set forth what he conceives to be the true
origin of government.</p>
<p>He begins by supposing what he calls a ‘state of nature’, antecedent
to all human government. In this state there is a ‘law of nature’, but
the law of nature consists of divine commands, and is not imposed by any
human legislator. It is not clear how far the state of nature is, for
Locke, a mere illustrative hypothesis, and how far he supposes it to
have had a historical existence; but I am afraid that he tended to think
of it as a stage that had actually occurred. Men emerged from the state
of nature by means of a social contract which instituted civil
government. This also he regarded as more or less historical. But for
the moment it is the state of nature that concerns us.</p>
<p>What Locke has to say about the state of nature and the law of nature
is, in the main, not original, but a repetition of medieval scholastic
doctrines. Thus St Thomas Aquinas says:</p>
<p>’Every law framed by man bears the character of a law exactly to that
extent to which it is derived from the law of nature. But if on any
point it is in conflict with the law of nature, it at once ceases to be
a law; it is a mere perversion of law.’1</p>
<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, the law of nature was held to condemn
‘usury’, i.e. lending money at interest. Church property was almost
entirely in land, and landowners have always been borrowers rather than
lenders. But when Protestantism arose, its support—especially the
support of Calvinism—came chiefly from the rich middle class, who were
lenders rather than borrowers Accordingly first Calvin, then other
Protestants, and finally the Catholic Church, sanctioned ‘usury’. Thus
natural law came to be differently conceived, but no one doubted there
being such a thing.</p>
<p>Many doctrines which survived the belief in natural law owe their
origin to it; for example, laissez-faire and the rights of man. These
doctrines are connected, and both have their origins in puritanism. Two
quotations given by Tawney will illustrate this. A committee of the
House of Commons in 1604 stated:</p>
<p>‘All free subjects are born inheritable, as to their land, and also
as to the free exercise of their industry, in those trades whereto they
apply themselves and whereby they are to live.’</p>
<p>And in 1656 Joseph Lee writes:</p>
<p>‘It is an undeniable maxim that every one by the light of nature and
reason will do that which makes for his greatest advantage…. The
advancement of private persons will be the advantage of the public.’</p>
<p>Except for the words ‘by the light of nature and reason’, this might
have been written in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In Locke’s theory of government, I repeat, there is little that is
original. In this Locke resembles most of the men who have won fame for
their ideas. As a rule, the man who first thinks of a new idea is so
much ahead of his time that everyone thinks him silly, so that he
remains obscure and is soon forgotten. Then, gradually, the world
becomes ready for the idea, and the man who proclaims it at the
fortunate moment gets all the credit. So it was, for example, with
Darwin; poor Lord Monboddo was a laughing-stock.</p>
<p>In regard to the state of nature, Locke was less original than
Hobbes, who regarded it as one in which there was war of all against
all, and life was nasty, brutish, and short. But Hobbes was reputed an
atheist. The view of the state of nature and of natural law which Locke
accepted from his predecessors cannot be freed from its theological
basis; where it survives without this, as in much modern liberalism, it
is destitute of clear logical foundation.</p>
<p>The belief in a happy ‘state of nature’ in the remote past is derived
partly from the biblical narrative of the age of the patriarchs, partly
from the classical myth of the golden age. The general belief in the
badness of the remote past only came with the doctrine of evolution.</p>
<p>The nearest thing to a definition of the state of nature to be found
in Locke is the following:</p>
<p>‘Men living together according to reason, without a common superior
on earth, with authority to judge between them, is properly the state of
nature.’</p>
<p>This is not a description of the life of savages, but of an imagined
community of virtuous anarchists, who need no police or law-courts
because they always obey ‘reason’, which is the same as ‘natural law’,
which, in turn, consists of those laws of conduct that are held to have
a divine origin. (For example, ‘Thou shalt not kill’ is part of natural
law, but the rule of the roads is not.)</p>
<p>Some further quotations will make Locke’s meaning clearer.</p>
<p>’To understand political power right [he says], and derive it from
its original, we must consider what state men are naturally in, and that
is, a state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of
their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of
the law of nature; without asking leave, or depending upon the will of
any other man.</p>
<p>’A state also of equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is
reciprocal, no one having more than another; there being nothing more
evident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously
born to all the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same
faculties, should also be equal one amongst another without
subordination or subjection; unless the lord and master of them all
should, by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another,
and confer on him, by an evident and clear appointment, an undoubted
right to dominion and sovereignty.</p>
<p>’But though this [the state of nature] be a state of liberty, yet it
is not a state of licence: though man in that state has an
uncontrollable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions, yet he
has not liberty to destroy himself, or so much as any creature in his
possession, but where some nobler use than its bare preservation calls
for it. The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which
obliges every one; and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind,
who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one
ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions’2
(for we are all God’s property).3</p>
<p>It presently appears, however, that, where most men are in the state
of nature, there may nevertheless be some men who do not live according
to the law of nature, and that the law of nature provides, up to a
point, what may be done to resist such criminals. In a state of nature,
we are told, every man can defend himself and what is his. ‘Whoso
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed’ is part of the law
of nature. I may even kill a thief while he is engaged in stealing my
property, and this right survives the institution of government,
although, where there is government, if the thief gets away I must
renounce private vengeance and resort to the law.</p>
<p>The great objection to the state of nature is that, while it
persists, every man is the judge in his own cause, since he must rely
upon himself for the defence of his rights. For this evil, government is
the remedy, but this is not a natural remedy. The state of nature,
according to Locke, was evaded by a compact to create a government. Not
any compact ends the state of nature, but only that of making one body
politic. The various governments of independent States are now in a
state of nature towards each other.</p>
<p>The state of nature, we are told in a passage presumably directed
against Hobbes, is not the same as a state of war, but more nearly its
opposite. After explaining the right to kill a thief, on the ground that
the thief may be deemed to be making war upon me, Locke says:</p>
<p>‘And here we have the plain “difference between the state of nature
and the state of war“, which, however some men have confounded, are as
far distant, as a state of peace, goodwill, mutual assistance and
preservation, and a state of enmity, malice, violence and mutual
destruction are from one another.’</p>
<p>Perhaps the law of nature must be regarded as having a wider scope
than the state of nature, since the former deals with thieves and
murderers, while in the latter there are no such malefactors. This, at
least, suggests a way out of an apparent inconsistency in Locke,
consisting in his sometimes representing the state of nature as one
where everyone is virtuous, and at other times discussing what may
rightly be done in a state of nature to resist the aggressions of wicked
men.</p>
<p>Some parts of Locke’s natural law are surprising. For example, he
says that captives in a just war are slaves by the law of nature. He
says also that by nature every man has a right to punish attacks on
himself or his property, even by death. He makes no qualification, so
that if I catch a person engaged in petty pilfering I have, apparently,
by the law of nature, a right to shoot him.</p>
<p>Property is very prominent in Locke’s political philosophy, and is,
according to him, the chief reason for the institution of civil
government:</p>
<p>‘The great and chief end of men uniting into commonwealths, and
putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their
property; to which in the state of nature there are many things
wanting.’</p>
<p>The whole of this theory of the state of nature and natural law is in
one sense clear but in another very puzzling. It is clear what Locke
thought, but it is not clear how he can have thought it. Locke’s ethic,
as we saw, is utilitarian, but in his consideration of ‘rights’ he does
not bring in utilitarian considerations. Something of this pervades the
whole philosophy of law as taught by lawyers. Legal rights can be
defined: broadly speaking, a man has a legal right when he can appeal to
the law to safeguard him against injury. A man has in general a legal
right to his property, but if he has (say) an illicit store of cocaine,
he has no legal remedy against a man who steals it. But the lawgiver has
to decide what legal rights to create, and falls back naturally on the
conception of ‘natural’ rights, as those which the law should
secure.</p>
<p>I am attempting to go as far as is possible towards stating something
like Locke’s theory in untheological terms. If it is assumed that
ethics, and the classification of acts as ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, is
logically prior to actual law, it becomes possible to restate the theory
in terms not involving mythical history. To arrive at the law of nature,
we may put the question in this way: in the absence of law and
government, what classes of acts by A against B justify B in retaliating
against A, and what sort of retaliation is justified in different cases?
It is generally held that no man can be blamed for defending himself
against a murderous assault, even, if necessary, to the extent of
killing the assailant. He may equally defend his wife and children, or,
indeed, any member of the general public. In such cases, the existence
of the law against murder becomes irrelevant, if, as may easily happen,
the man assaulted would be dead before the aid of the police could be
invoked; we have, therefore, to fall back on ‘natural’ right. A man also
has a right to defend his property, though opinions differ as to the
amount of injury he may justly inflict upon a thief.</p>
<p>In the relations between States, as Locke points out, ‘natural’ law
is relevant. In what circumstances is war justified? So long as no
international government exists, the answer to this question is purely
ethical, not legal; it must be answered in the same way as it would be
for an individual in a state of anarchy.</p>
<p>Legal theory will be based upon the view that the ‘rights’ of
individuals should be protected by the State. That is to say, when a man
suffers the kind of injury which would justify retaliation according to
the principles of natural law, positive law should enact that the
retaliation shall be done by the State. If you see a man making a
murderous assault upon your brother, you have a right to kill him, if
you cannot otherwise save your brother. In a state of nature—so, at
least, Locke holds—if a man has succeeded in killing your brother, you
have a right to kill him. But where law exists, you lose this right,
which is taken over by the State. And if you kill in self-defence or in
defence of another, you will have to prove to a law-court that this was
the reason for the killing.</p>
<p>We may then identify ‘natural law’ with moral rules in so far as they
are independent of positive legal enactments. There must be such rules
if there is to be any distinction between good and bad laws. For Locke,
the matter is simple, since moral rules have been laid down by God, and
are to be found in the Bible. When this theological basis is removed,
the matter becomes more difficult. But so long as it is held that there
is an ethical distinction between right actions and wrong ones, we can
say: Natural law decides what actions would be ethically right, and what
wrong, in a community that had no government; and positive law ought to
be, as far as possible, guided and inspired by natural law.</p>
<p>In its absolute form, the doctrine that an individual has certain
inalienable rights is incompatible with utilitarianism, i.e. with the
doctrine that right acts are those that do most to promote the general
happiness. But in order that a doctrine may be a suitable basis for law,
it is not necessary that it should be true in every possible case, but
only that it should be true in an overwhelming majority of cases. We can
all imagine cases in which murder would be justifiable, but they are
rare, and do not afford an argument against the illegality of murder.
Similarly it may be—I am not saying that it is—desirable, from a
utilitarian point of view, to reserve to each individual a certain
sphere of personal liberty. If so, the doctrine of the Rights of Man
will be a suitable basis for the appropriate laws, even though these
rights be subject to exceptions. A utilitarian will have to examine the
doctrine, considered as a basis for laws, from the point of view of its
practical effects; he cannot condemn it ab initio as contrary to his own
ethic.</p>
<p>C. THE SOCIAL CONTRACT</p>
<p>In the political speculation of the seventeenth century, there were
two main types of theory as to the origin of government. Of one type we
have had an example in Sir Robert Filmer: this type maintained that God
had bestowed power on certain persons, and that these persons, or their
heirs, constituted the legitimate government, rebellion against which is
not only treason, but impiety. This view was sanctioned by sentiments of
immemorial antiquity: in almost all early civilizations, the king is a
sacred person. Kings, naturally, considered it an admirable theory.
Aristocracies had motives for supporting it and motives for opposing it.
In its favour was the fact that it emphasized the hereditary principle,
and that it gave august support to resistance against the upstart
merchant class. Where the middle class was more feared or hated by the
aristocracy than the king was, these motives prevailed. Where the
contrary was the case, and especially where the aristocracy had a chance
of obtaining supreme power itself, it tended to oppose the king, and
therefore to reject theories of divine right.</p>
<p>The other main type of theory—of which Locke is a
representative—maintained that civil government is the result of a
contract, and is an affair purely of this world, not something
established by divine authority. Some writers regarded the social
contract as a historical fact, others as a legal fiction; the important
matter, for all of them, was to find a terrestrial origin for
governmental authority. In fact, they could not think of any alternative
to divine right except the supposed contract. It was felt by all except
rebels that some reason must be found for obeying governments, and it
was not thought sufficient to say that for most people the authority of
government is convenient. Government must, in some sense, have a right
to exact obedience, and the right conferred by a contract seemed the
only alternative to a divine command. Consequently the doctrine that
government was instituted by a contract was popular with practically all
opponents of the divine right of kings. There is a hint of this theory
in Thomas Aquinas, but the first serious development of it is to be
found in Grotius.</p>
<p>The contract doctrine was capable of taking forms which justified
tyranny. Hobbes, for example, held that there was a contract among the
citizens to hand over all power to the chosen sovereign, but the
sovereign was not a party to the contract, and therefore necessarily
acquired unlimited authority. This theory, at first, might have
justified Cromwell’s totalitarian State; after the Restoration, it
justified Charles II. In Locke’s form of the doctrine, however, the
government is a party to the contract, and can be justly resisted if it
fails to fulfil its part of the bargain. Locke’s doctrine is, in
essence, more or less democratic, but the democratic element is limited
by the view (implied rather than expressed) that those who have no
property are not to be reckoned as citizens.</p>
<p>Let us now see just what Locke has to say on our present topic.</p>
<p>There is first a definition of political power:</p>
<p>‘Political power I take to be the right of making laws, with penalty
of death, and consequently all less penalties for the regulating and
preserving of property, and of employing the force of the community in
the execution of such laws, and in the defence of the commonwealth from
foreign injury, and all this only for the public good.’</p>
<p>Government, we are told, is a remedy for the inconveniences that
arise, in the state of nature, from the fact that, in that state, every
man is the judge in his own cause. But where the monarch is a party to
the dispute, this is no remedy, since the monarch is both judge and
plaintiff. These considerations lead to the view that governments should
not be absolute, and that the judiciary should be independent of the
executive. Such arguments had an important future both in England and in
America, but for the moment we are not concerned with them.</p>
<p>By nature, Locke says, every man has the right to punish attacks on
himself or his property, even by death. There is political society
there, and there only, where men have surrendered this right to the
community or to the law.</p>
<p>Absolute monarchy is not a form of civil government, because there is
no neutral authority to decide disputes between the monarch and a
subject; in fact the monarch, in relation to his subjects, is still in a
state of nature. It is useless to hope that being a king will make a
naturally violent man virtuous.</p>
<p>‘He that would have been insolent and injurious in the woods of
America would not probably be much better in a throne, where perhaps
learning and religion shall be found out to justify all that he shall do
to his subjects, and the sword presently silence all those that dare
question it.’</p>
<p>Absolute monarchy is as if men protected themselves against pole-cats
and foxes, ‘but are content, nay think it safety, to be devoured by
lions’.</p>
<p>Civil society involves the rule of the majority, unless it is agreed
that a greater number shall be required. (As, for example, in the United
States, for a change in the Constitution or the ratification of a
treaty.) This sounds democratic, but it must be remembered that Locke
assumes the exclusion of women and the poor from the rights of
citizenship.</p>
<p>‘The beginning of politic society depends upon the consent of the
individuals to join into and make one society.’ It is argued—somewhat
half-heartedly—that such consent must, at some time, have actually taken
place, though it is admitted that the origin of government antedates
history everywhere except among the Jews.</p>
<p>The civil compact which institutes government binds only those who
made it; the son must consent afresh to a compact made by his father.
(It is clear how this follows from Locke’s principles, but it is not
very realistic. A young American who, on attaining the age of
twenty-one, announces ‘I refuse to be bound by the contract which
inaugurated the United States’ will find himself in difficulties.)</p>
<p>The power of the government by contract, we are told, never extends
beyond the common good. A moment ago I quoted a sentence as to the
powers of government, ending ‘and all this only for the public good’. It
seems not to have occurred to Locke to ask who was to be the judge of
the common good. Obviously, if the government is the judge it will
always decide in its own favour. Presumably Locke would say that the
majority of the citizens is to be the judge. But many questions have to
be decided too quickly for it to be possible to ascertain the opinion of
the electorate; of these peace and war are perhaps the most important.
The only remedy in such cases is to allow to public opinion or its
representatives some power—such as impeachment—of subsequently punishing
executive officers for acts that are found to have been unpopular. But
often this is a very inadequate remedy.</p>
<p>I quoted previously a sentence which I must now quote again:</p>
<p>‘The great and chief end of men uniting into commonwealths, and
putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their
property.’</p>
<p>Consistently with this doctrine Locke declares that:</p>
<p>‘The supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property
without his own consent.’</p>
<p>Still more surprising is the statement that, although military
commanders have power of life and death over their soldiers, they have
no power of taking money. (It follows that, in any army, it would be
wrong to punish minor breaches of discipline by fines, but permissible
to punish them by bodily injury, such as flogging. This shows the absurd
lengths to which Locke is driven by his worship of property.)</p>
<p>The question of taxation might be supposed to raise difficulties for
Locke, but he perceives none. The expense of government, he says, must
be borne by the citizens, but with their consent, i.e. with that of the
majority. But why, one asks, should the consent of the majority suffice?
Every man’s consent, we were told, is necessary to justify the
government in taking any part of his property. I suppose his tacit
consent to taxation in accordance with majority decision is presumed to
be involved in his citizenship, which, in turn, is presumed to be
voluntary. All this is, of course, sometimes quite contrary to the
facts. Most men have no effective liberty of choice as to the State to
which they shall belong, and none have liberty, nowadays, to belong to
no State. Suppose, for example, you are a pacifist, and disapprove of
war. Wherever you live, the government will take some of your property
for warlike purposes. With what justice can you be compelled to submit
to this? I can imagine many answers, but I do not think any of them are
consistent with Locke’s principles. He thrusts in the maxim of majority
rule without adequate consideration, and offers no transition to it from
his individualistic premisses, except the mythical social contract.</p>
<p>The social contract, in the sense required, is mythical even when, at
some former period, there actually was a contract creating the
government in question. The United States is a case in point. At the
time when the Constitution was adopted, men had liberty of choice. Even
then, many voted against it, and were therefore not parties to the
contract. They could, of course, have left the country, and by remaining
were deemed to have become bound by a contract to which they had not
assented. But in practice it is usually difficult to leave one’s
country. And in the case of men born after the adoption of the
Constitution their consent is even more shadowy.</p>
<p>The question of the rights of the individual as against the
government is a very difficult one. It is too readily assumed by
democrats that, when the government represents the majority, it has a
right to coerce the minority. Up to a point, this must be true, since
coercion is of the essence of government. But the divine right of
majorities, if pressed too far, may become almost as tyrannical as the
divine right of kings. Locke says little on this subject in his Essays
on Government, but considers it at some length in his Letters on
Toleration, where he argues that no believer in God should be penalized
on account of his religious opinions.</p>
<p>The theory that government was created by a contract is, of course,
pre-evolutionary. Government, like measles and whooping-cough, must have
grown up gradually, though, like them, it could be introduced suddenly
into new regions such as the South Sea Islands. Before men had studied
anthropology they had no idea of the psychological mechanisms involved
in the beginnings of government, or of the fantastic reasons which lead
men to adopt institutions and customs that subsequently prove useful.
But as a legal fiction, to justify government, the theory of the social
contract has some measure of truth.</p>
<p>D. PROPERTY</p>
<p>From what has been said hitherto about Locke’s views on property, it
might seem as though he were the champion of the great capitalists
against both their social superiors and their social inferiors, but this
would be only a half-truth. One finds in him, side by side and
unreconciled, doctrines which foreshadow those of developed capitalism
and doctrines which adumbrate a more nearly socialistic outlook. It is
easy to misrepresent him by one-sided quotations, on this topic as on
most others.</p>
<p>I will put down, in the order in which they occur, Locke’s principal
dicta on the subject of property.</p>
<p>We are told first that every man has private property in the produce
of his own labour—or, at least, should have. In pre-industrial days this
maxim was not so unrealistic as it has since become. Urban production
was mainly by handicraftsmen who owned their tools and sold their
produce. As for agricultural production, it was held by the school to
which Locke belonged that peasant proprietorship would be the best
system. He states that a man may own as much land as he can till, but
not more. He seems blandly unaware that, in all the countries of Europe,
the realization of this programme would be hardly possible without a
bloody revolution. Everywhere the bulk of agricultural land belonged to
aristocrats, who exacted from the farmers either a fixed proportion of
the produce (often a half), or a rent which could be varied from time to
time. The former system prevailed in France and Italy, the latter in
England. Farther East, in Russia and Prussia, the workers were serfs,
who worked for the landowner and had virtually no rights. The old system
was ended in France by the French Revolution, in northern Italy and
Western Germany by the conquests of the French revolutionary armies.
Serfdom was abolished in Prussia as a result of defeat by Napoleon, and
in Russia as a result of defeat in the Crimean War. But in both
countries the aristocrats retained their landed estates. In East
Prussia, this system, though drastically controlled by the Nazis,
survived till the present day; in Russia and what are now Lithuania,
Latvia, and Esthonia, the aristocrats were dispossessed by the Russian
Revolution. In Hungary, and Poland they survived; in Eastern Poland they
were ‘liquidated’ by the Soviet Government in 1940. The Soviet
Government, however, has done everything in its power to substitute
collective farming rather than peasant proprietorship throughout
Russia.</p>
<p>In England the development has been more complex. In Locke’s day, the
position of the rural labourer was mitigated by the existence of
commons, on which he had important rights, which enabled him to raise a
considerable part of his food himself. This system was a survival from
the Middle Ages, and was viewed with disapproval by modern-minded men,
who pointed out that from the point of view of production it was
wasteful. Accordingly, there was a movement for enclosure of commons,
which began under Henry VIII and continued under Cromwell, but did not
become strong until about 1750. From that time onward, for about ninety
years, one common after another was enclosed and handed over to the
local landowners. Each enclosure required an Act of Parliament, and the
aristocrats who controlled both Houses of Parliament ruthlessly used
their legislative power to enrich themselves, while thrusting
agricultural labourers down to the verge of starvation. Gradually, owing
to the growth of industry, the position of agricultural labourers
improved, since otherwise they could not be prevented from migrating to
the towns. At present, as a result of the taxation introduced by Lloyd
George, the aristocrats have been compelled to part with most of their
rural property. But those who also own urban or industrial property have
been able to hang on to their estates. There has been no sudden
revolution, but a gradual transition which is still in progress. At
present, those aristocrats who are still rich owe their wealth to urban
or industrial property.</p>
<p>This long development may be regarded, except in Russia, as in
accordance with Locke’s principles. The odd thing is that he could
announce doctrines requiring so much revolution before they could be put
into effect, and yet show no sign that he thought the system existing in
his day unjust, or that he was aware of its being different from the
system that he advocated.</p>
<p>The labour theory of value—i.e. the doctrine that the value of a
product depends upon the labour expended upon it—which some attribute to
Karl Marx and others to Ricardo, is to be found in Locke, and was
suggested to him by a line of predecessors stretching back to Aquinas.
As Tawney says, summarizing scholastic doctrine:</p>
<p>‘The essence of the argument was that payment may properly be
demanded by the craftsmen who make the goods, or by the merchants who
transport them, for both labour in their vocation and serve the common
need. The unpardonable sin is that of the speculator or middleman, who
snatches private gain by the exploitation of public necessities. The
true descendant of the doctrines of Aquinas is the labour theory of
value. The last of the schoolmen was Karl Marx.’</p>
<p>The labour theory of value has two aspects, one ethical, the other
economic. That is to say, it may assert that the value of a product
ought to be proportional to the labour expended on it, or that in fact
the labour regulates the price. The latter doctrine is only
approximately true, as Locke recognizes. Nine tenths of value, he says,
is due to labour; but as to the other tenth he says nothing. It is
labour, he says, that puts the difference of value on everything. He
instances land in America occupied by Indians, which has almost no value
because the Indians do not cultivate it. He does not seem to realize
that land may acquire value as soon as people are willing to work on it,
and before they have actually done so. If you own a piece of desert land
on which somebody else finds oil, you can sell it for a good price
without doing any work on it. As was natural in his day, he does not
think of such cases, but only of agriculture. Peasant proprietorship,
which he favours, is inapplicable to such things as large-scale mining,
which require expensive apparatus and many workers.</p>
<p>The principle that a man has a right to the produce of his own labour
is useless in an industrial civilization. Suppose you are employed in
one operation in the manufacture of Ford cars, how is anyone to estimate
what proportion of the total output is due to your labour? Or suppose
you are employed by a railway company in the transport of goods, who can
decide what share you shall be deemed to have in the production of the
goods? Such considerations have led those who wish to prevent the
exploitation of labour to abandon the principle of the right to your own
produce in favour of more socialistic methods of organizing production
and distribution.</p>
<p>The labour theory of value has usually been advocated from hostility
to some class regarded as predatory. The Schoolmen, in so far as they
held it, did so from opposition to usurers, who were mostly Jews.
Ricardo held it in opposition to landowners, Marx to capitalists. But
Locke seems to have held it in a vacuum, without hostility to any class.
His only hostility is to monarchs, but this is unconnected with his
views on value.</p>
<p>Some of Locke’s opinions are so odd that I cannot see how to make
them sound sensible. He says that a man must not have so many plums that
they are bound to go bad before he and his family can eat them; but he
may have as much gold and as many diamonds as he can lawfully get,
because gold and diamonds do not go bad. It does not occur to him that
the man who has the plums might sell them before they go bad.</p>
<p>He makes a great deal of the imperishable character of the precious
metals, which, he says, are the source of money and inequality of
fortune. He seems, in an abstract and academic way, to regret economic
inequality, but he certainly does not think that it would be wise to
take such measures as might prevent it. No doubt he was impressed, as
all the men of his time were, by the gains to civilization that were due
to rich men, chiefly as patrons of art and letters. The same attitude
exists in modern America, where science and art are largely dependent
upon the benefactions of the very rich. To some extent, civilization is
furthered by social injustice. This fact is the basis of what is most
respectable in conservatism.</p>
<p>E. CHECKS AND BALANCES</p>
<p>The doctrine that the legislative, executive, and judicial functions
of government should be kept separate is characteristic of liberalism;
it arose in England in the course of resistance to the Stuarts, and is
clearly formulated by Locke, at least as regards the legislature and the
executive. The legislative and executive must be separate, he says, to
prevent abuse of power. It must, of course, be understood that when he
speaks of the legislature he means Parliament, and when he speaks of the
executive he means the king; at least this is what he means emotionally,
whatever he may logically intend to mean. Accordingly he thinks of the
legislature as virtuous, while the executive is usually wicked.</p>
<p>The legislative, he says, must be supreme, except that it must be
removable by the community. It is implied that, like the English House
of Commons, the legislative is to be elected from time to time by
popular vote. The condition that the legislative is to be removable by
the people, if taken seriously, condemns the part allowed by the British
Constitution in Locke’s day to King and Lords as part of the legislative
power.</p>
<p>In all well-framed governments, Locke says, the legislative and
executive are separate. The question therefore arises: what is to be
done when they conflict? If the executive fails to summon the
legislative at the proper times, we are told, the executive is at war
with the people, and may be removed by force. This is obviously a view
suggested by what happened under Charles I. From 1628 to 1640 he tried
to govern without Parliament; this sort of thing, Locke feels, must be
prevented, by civil war if necessary.</p>
<p>‘Force,’ he says, ‘is to be opposed to nothing but unjust and
unlawful force.’ This principle is useless in practice unless there
exists some body with the legal right to pronounce when force is ‘unjust
and unlawful’. Charles I’s attempt to collect ship-money without the
consent of Parliament was declared by his opponents to be ‘unjust and
unlawful’, and by him to be just and lawful. Only the military issue of
the Civil War proved that his interpretation of the Constitution was the
wrong one. The same thing happened in the American Civil War. Had States
the right to secede? No one knew, and only the victory of the North
decided the legal question. The belief, which one finds in Locke and in
most writers of his time, that any honest man can know what is just and
lawful, is one that does not allow for the strength of party bias on
both sides, or for the difficulty of establishing a tribunal, whether
outwardly or in men’s consciences, that shall be capable of pronouncing
authoritatively on vexed questions. In practice, such questions, if
sufficiently important, are decided simply by power, not by justice and
law.</p>
<p>To some degree, though in veiled language, Locke recognizes this
fact. In a dispute between legislative and executive, he says there is,
in certain cases, no judge under Heaven. Since Heaven does not make
explicit pronouncements, this means, in effect, that a decision can only
be reached by fighting, since it is assumed that Heaven will give the
victory to the better cause. Some such view is essential to any doctrine
that divides governmental power. Where such a doctrine is embodied in
the Constitution, the only way to avoid occasional civil war is to
practise compromise and common sense. But compromise and common sense
are habits of mind, and cannot be embodied in a written
constitution.</p>
<p>It is surprising that Locke says nothing about the judiciary,
although this was a burning question in his day. Until the Revolution,
judges could at any moment be dismissed by the king; consequently they
condemned his enemies and acquitted his friends. After the Revolution,
they were made irremovable except by an Address from both Houses of
Parliament. It was thought that this would cause their decisions to be
guided by the law; in fact, in cases involving party spirit, it has
merely substituted the judge’s prejudice for the king’s. However that
may be, wherever the principle of checks and balances prevailed the
judiciary became a third independent branch of government alongside of
the legislative and executive. The most noteworthy example is the United
States’ Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The history of the doctrine of checks and balances has been
interesting.</p>
<p>In England, the country of its origin, it was intended to limit the
power of the king, who, until the Revolution, had complete control of
the executive. Gradually, however, the executive became dependent upon
Parliament, since it was impossible for a ministry to carry on without a
majority in the House of Commons. The executive thus became, in effect,
a committee chosen in fact, though not in form, by Parliament, with the
result that legislative and executive powers became gradually less and
less separate. During the last fifty years or so, a further development
took place, owing to the Prime Minister’s power of dissolution and to
the increasing strictness of party discipline. The majority in
Parliament now decides which party shall be in power, but, having
decided that, it cannot in practice decide anything else. Proposed
legislation is hardly ever enacted unless introduced by government. Thus
the government is both legislative and executive, and its power is only
limited by the need of occasional general elections. This system is, of
course, totally contrary to Locke’s principles.</p>
<p>In France, where the doctrine was preached with great force by
Montesquieu, it was held by the more moderate parties in the French
Revolution, but was swept into temporary oblivion by the victory of the
Jacobins. Napoleon naturally had no use for it, but it was revived at
the Restoration, to disappear again with the rise of Napoleon III. It
was again revived in 1871, and led to the adoption of a constitution in
which the President had very little power and the government could not
dissolve the Chambers. The result was to give great power to the Chamber
of Deputies, both as against the government and as against the
electorate. There was more division of powers than in modern England,
but less than there should be on Locke’s principles, since the
legislature overshadowed the executive. What the French Constitution
will be after the present war it is impossible to foresee.</p>
<p>The country where Locke’s principle of the division of powers has
found its fullest application is the United States, where the President
and Congress are wholly independent of each other, and the Supreme Court
is independent of both. Inadvertently, the Constitution made the Supreme
Court a branch of the legislature, since nothing is a law if the Supreme
Court says it is not. The fact that its powers are nominally only
interpretative in reality increases those powers, since it makes it
difficult to criticize what are supposed to be purely legal decisions.
It says a very great deal for the political sagacity of Americans that
this Constitution has only once led to armed conflict.</p>
<p>Locke’s political philosophy was, on the whole, adequate and useful
until the industrial revolution. Since then, it has been increasingly
unable to tackle the important problems. The power of property, as
embodied in vast corporations, grew beyond anything imagined by Locke.
The necessary functions of the State—for example, in education—increased
enormously. Nationalism brought about an alliance, sometimes an
amalgamation, of economic and political power, making war the principal
means of competition. The single separate citizen has no longer the
power and independence that he had in Locke’s speculations. Our age is
one of organization, and its conflicts are between organizations, not
between separate individuals. The state of nature, as Locke says, still
exists as between States. A new international Social Contract is
necessary before we can enjoy the promised benefits of government. When
once an international government has been created, much of Locke’s
political philosophy will again become applicable, though not the part
of it that deals with private property.</p>
