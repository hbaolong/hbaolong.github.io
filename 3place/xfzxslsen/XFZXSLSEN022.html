<h4 id="aristotles-metaphysics">19 ARISTOTLE’S METAPHYSICS</h4>
<p>In reading any important philosopher, but most of all in reading
Aristotle, it is necessary to study him in two ways: with reference to
his predecessors, and with reference to his successors. In the former
aspect, Aristotle’s merits are enormous; in the latter, his demerits are
equally enormous. For his demerits, however, his successors are more
responsible than he is. He came at the end of the creative period in
Greek thought, and after his death it was two thousand years before the
world produced any philosopher who could be regarded as approximately
his equal. Towards the end of this long period his authority had become
almost as unquestioned as that of the Church, and in science, as well as
in philosophy, had become a serious obstacle to progress. Ever since the
beginning of the seventeenth century, almost every serious intellectual
advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine;
in logic, this is still true at the present day. But it would have been
at least as disastrous if any of his predecessors (except perhaps
Democritus) had acquired equal authority. To do him justice, we must, to
begin with, forget his excessive posthumous fame, and the equally
excessive posthumous condemnation to which it led.</p>
<p>Aristotle was born, probably in 384 B.C., at Stagira in Thrace. His
father had inherited the position of family physician to the king of
Macedonia. At about the age of eighteen Aristotle came to Athens and
became a pupil of Plato; he remained in the Academy for nearly twenty
years, until the death of Plato in 348–7 B.C. He then travelled for a
time, and married either the sister or the niece of a tyrant named
Hermias. (Scandal said she was the daughter or concubine of Hermias, but
both stories are disproved by the fact that he was a eunuch.) In 343
B.C. he became tutor to Alexander, then thirteen years old, and
continued in that position until, at the age of sixteen, Alexander was
pronounced by his father to be of age, and was appointed regent during
Philip’s absence. Everything one would wish to know of the relations of
Aristotle and Alexander is unascertainable, the more so as legends were
soon invented on the subject. There are letters between them which are
generally regarded as forgeries. People who admire both men suppose that
the tutor influenced the pupil. Hegel thinks that Alexander’s career
shows the practical usefulness of philosophy. As to this, A. W. Benn
says: ’It would be unfortunate if philosophy had no better testimonial
to show for herself than the character of Alexander…. Arrogant, drunken,
cruel, vindictive, and grossly superstitious, he united the vices of a
Highland chieftain to the frenzy of an Oriental despot.’1</p>
<p>For my part, while I agree with Benn about the character of
Alexander, I nevertheless think that his work was enormously important
and enormously beneficial, since, but for him, the whole tradition of
Hellenic civilization might well have perished. As to Aristotle’s
influence on him, we are left free to conjecture whatever seems to us
most plausible. For my part, I should suppose it nil. Alexander was an
ambitious and passionate boy, on bad terms with his father, and
presumably impatient of schooling. Aristotle thought no State should
have as many as one hundred thousand citizens,2 and preached the
doctrine of the golden mean. I cannot imagine his pupil regarding him as
anything but a prosy old pedant, set over him by his father to keep him
out of mischief. Alexander, it is true, had a certain snobbish respect
for Athenian civilization, but this was common to his whole dynasty who
wished to prove that they were not barbarians. It was analogous to the
feeling of nineteenth-century Russian aristocrats for Paris. This,
therefore, was not attributable to Aristotle’s influence. And I do not
see anything else in Alexander that could possibly have come from this
source.</p>
<p>It is more surprising that Alexander had so little influence on
Aristotle, whose speculations on politics were blandly oblivious of the
fact that the era of City States had given way to the era of empires. I
suspect that Aristotle, to the end, thought of him as ‘that idle and
headstrong boy, who never could understand anything of philosophy’. On
the whole, the contacts of these two great men seem to have been as
unfruitful as if they had lived in different worlds.</p>
<p>From 335 B.C. to 323 B.C. (in which latter year Alexander died),
Aristotle lived at Athens. It was during these twelve years that he
founded his school and wrote most of his books. At the death of
Alexander, the Athenians rebelled, and turned on his friends, including
Aristotle, who was indicted for impiety, but, unlike Socrates, fled to
avoid punishment. In the next year (322) he died.</p>
<p>Aristotle, as a philosopher, is in many ways very different from all
his predecessors. He is the first to write like a professor: his
treatises are systematic, his discussions are divided into heads, he is
a professional teacher, not an inspired prophet. His work is critical,
careful, pedestrian, without any trace of Bacchic enthusiasm. The Orphic
elements in Plato are watered down in Aristotle, and mixed with a strong
dose of common sense; where he is Platonic, one feels that his natural
temperament has been overpowered by the teaching to which he has been
subjected. He is not passionate, or in any profound sense religious. The
errors of his predecessors were the glorious errors of youth attempting
the impossible; his errors are those of age which cannot free itself of
habitual prejudices. He is best in detail and in criticism; he fails in
large construction, for lack of fundamental clarity and Titanic
fire.</p>
<p>It is difficult to decide at what point to begin an account of
Aristotle’s metaphysics, but perhaps the best place is his criticism of
the theory of ideas, and his own alternative doctrine of universals. He
advances against the theory of ideas a number of very good arguments,
most of which are already to be found in Plato’s Parmenides. The
strongest argument is that of the ‘third man’: if a man is a man because
he resembles the ideal man, there must be a still more ideal man to whom
both ordinary men and the ideal man are similar. Again, Socrates is both
a man and an animal, and the question arises whether the ideal man is an
ideal animal; if he is, there must be as many ideal animals as there are
species of animals. It is needless to pursue the matter; Aristotle makes
it obvious that, when a number of individuals share a predicate, this
cannot be because of relation to something of the same kind as
themselves, but more ideal. This much may be taken as proved, but
Aristotle’s own doctrine is far from clear. It was this lack of clarity
that made possible the medieval controversy between nominalists and
realists.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s metaphysics, roughly speaking, may be described as Plato
diluted by common sense. He is difficult because Plato and common sense
do not mix easily. When one tries to understand him, one thinks part of
the time that he is expressing the ordinary views of a person innocent
of philosophy, and the rest of the time that he is setting forth
Platonism with a new vocabulary. It does not do to lay too much stress
on any single passage, because there is liable to be a correction or
modification of it in some later passage. On the whole, the easiest way
to understand both his theory of universals and his theory of matter and
form is to set forth first the common-sense doctrine which is half of
his view, and then to consider the Platonic modifications to which he
subjects it.</p>
<p>Up to a certain point, the theory of universals is quite simple. In
language, there are proper names, and there are adjectives. The proper
names apply to ‘things’ or ‘persons’, each of which is the only thing or
person to which the name in question applies. The sun, the moon, France,
Napoleon, are unique; there are not a number of instances of things to
which these names apply. On the other hand, words like ‘cat’, ‘dog’,
‘man’ apply to many different things. The problem of universals is
concerned with the meanings of such words, and also of adjectives, such
as ‘white’, ‘hard’, ‘round’, and so on. He says:3 ‘By the term
“universal“ I mean that which is of such a nature as to be predicated of
many subjects, by “individual“ that which is not thus predicated.’</p>
<p>What is signified by a proper name is a ‘substance’, while what is
signified by an adjective or class-name, such as ‘human’ or ‘man’, is
called a ‘universal’. A substance is a ‘this’, but a universal is a
‘such’—it indicates the sort of thing, not the actual particular thing.
A universal is not a substance, because it is not a ‘this’. (Plato’s
heavenly bed would be a ‘this’ to those who could perceive it; this is a
matter as to which Aristotle disagrees with Plato.) ‘It seems
impossible,’ Aristotle says, ‘that any universal term should be the name
of a substance. For … the substance of each thing is that which is
peculiar to it, which does not belong to anything else; but the
universal is common, since that is called universal which is such as to
belong to more than one thing.’ The gist of the matter, so far, is that
a universal cannot exist by itself, but only in particular things.</p>
<p>Superficially, Aristotle’s doctrine is plain enough. Suppose I say
‘there is such a thing as the game of football,’ most people would
regard the remark as a truism. But if I were to infer that football
could exist without football-players, I should be rightly held to be
talking nonsense. Similarly, it would be held, there is such a thing as
parenthood, but only because there are parents; there is such a thing as
sweetness, but only because there are sweet things; and there is
redness, but only because there are red things. And this dependence is
thought to be not reciprocal: the men who play football would still
exist even if they never played football; things which are usually sweet
may turn sour; and my face, which is usually red, may turn pale without
ceasing to be my face. In this way we are led to conclude that what is
meant by an adjective is dependent for its being on what is meant by a
proper name, but not vice versa. This is, I think, what Aristotle means.
His doctrine on this point, as on many others, is a common-sense
prejudice pedantically expressed.</p>
<p>But it is not easy to give precision to the theory. Granted that
football could not exist without football-players, it could perfectly
well exist without this or that football-player. And granted that a
person can exist without playing football, he nevertheless cannot exist
without doing something. The quality redness cannot exist without some
subject, but it can exist without this or that</p>
<p>subject; similarly a subject cannot exist without some quality, but
can exist without this or that quality. The supposed ground for the
distinction between things and qualities thus seems to be illusory.</p>
<p>The true ground of the distinction is, in fact, linguistic; it is
derived from syntax. There are proper names, adjectives, and
relation-words; we may say ‘John is wise, James is foolish, John is
taller than James.’ Here ‘John’ and ‘James’ are proper names, ‘wise’ and
‘foolish’ are adjectives, and ‘taller’ is a relation-word.
Metaphysicians, ever since Aristotle, have interpreted these syntactical
differences metaphysically: John and James are substances, wisdom and
folly are universals. (Relation-words were ignored or misinterpreted.)
It may be that, given sufficient care, metaphysical differences can be
found that have some relation to these syntactical differences, but, if
so, it will be only by means of a long process, involving, incidentally,
the creation of an artificial philosophical language. And this language
will contain no such names as ‘John’ and ‘James’, and no such adjectives
as ‘wise’ and ‘foolish’; all the words of ordinary languages will have
yielded to analysis, and been replaced by words having a less complex
significance. Until this labour has been performed, the question of
particulars and universals cannot be adequately discussed. And when we
reach the point at which we can at last discuss it, we shall find that
the question we are discussing is quite different from what we supposed
it to be at the outset.</p>
<p>If, therefore, I have failed to make Aristotle’s theory of universals
clear, that is (I maintain) because it is not clear. But it is certainly
an advance on the theory of ideas, and is certainly concerned with a
genuine and very important problem.</p>
<p>There is another term which is important in Aristotle and in his
scholastic followers, and that is the term ‘essence’. This is by no
means synonymous with ‘universal’. Your ‘essence’ is ‘what you are by
your very nature’. It is, one may say, those of your properties which
you cannot lose without ceasing to be yourself, not only an individual
thing, but a species, has an essence. The definition of a species should
consist in mentioning its essence. I shall return to the conception of
‘essence’ in connection with Aristotle’s logic. For the present I will
merely observe that it seems to me a muddle-headed notion, incapable of
precision.</p>
<p>The next point in Aristotle’s metaphysics is the distinction of
‘form’ and ‘matter’. (It must be understood that ‘matter’, in the sense
in which it is opposed to ‘form’, is different from ‘matter’ as opposed
to ‘mind’.)</p>
<p>Here, again, there is a common-sense basis for Aristotle’s theory,
but here, more than in the case of universals, the Platonic
modifications are very important. We may start with a marble statue;
here marble is the matter, while the shape conferred by the sculptor is
the form. Or, to take Aristotle’s examples, if a man makes a bronze
sphere, bronze is the matter, and sphericity is the form; while in the
case of a calm sea, water is the matter and smoothness is the form. So
far, all is simple.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that it is in virtue of the form that the matter is
some one definite thing, and this is the substance of the thing. What
Aristotle means seems to be plain common sense: a ‘thing’ must be
bounded, and the boundary constitutes its form. Take, say, a volume of
water: any part of it can be marked off from the rest by being enclosed
in a vessel, and then this part becomes a ‘thing’, but so long as the
part is in no way marked out from the rest of the homogeneous mass it is
not a ‘thing’. A statue is a ‘thing’, and the marble of which it is
composed is, in a sense, unchanged from what it was as part of a lump or
as part of the contents of a quarry. We should not naturally say that it
is the form that confers substantiality, but that is because the atomic
hypothesis is ingrained in our imagination. Each atom, however, if it is
a ‘thing’, is so in virtue of its being delimited from other atoms, and
so having, in some sense, a ‘form’.</p>
<p>We now come to a new statement, which at first sight seems difficult.
The soul, we are told, is the form of the body. Here it is clear that
‘form’ does not mean ‘shape’. I shall return later to the sense in which
the soul is the form of the body; for the present, I will only observe
that, in Aristotle’s system, the soul is what makes the body one thing,
having unity of purpose, and the characteristics that we associate with
the word ‘organism’. The purpose of an eye is to see, but it cannot see
when parted from its body. In fact, it is the soul that sees.</p>
<p>It would seem, then, that ‘form’ is what gives unity to a portion of
matter, and that this unity is usually, if not always, teleological. But
‘form’ turns out to be much more than this, and the more is very
difficult.</p>
<p>The form of a thing, we are told, is its essence and primary
substance. Forms are substantial, although universals are not. When a
man makes a brazen sphere, both the matter and the form already existed,
and all that he does is to bring them together; the man does not make
the form, any more than he makes the brass. Not everything has matter;
there are eternal things, and these have no matter, except those of them
that are movable in space. Things increase in actuality by acquiring
form; matter without form is only a potentiality.</p>
<p>The view that forms are substances, which exist independently of the
matter in which they are exemplified, seems to expose Aristotle to his
own arguments against Platonic ideas. A form is intended by him to be
something quite different from a universal, but it has many of the same
characteristics. Form is, we are told, more real than matter; this is
reminiscent of the sole reality of the ideas. The change that Aristotle
makes in Plato’s metaphysic is, it would seem, less than he represents
it as being. This view is taken by Zeller, who, on the question of
matter and form says:4</p>
<p>‘The final explanation of Aristotle’s want of clearness on this
subject is, however, to be found in the fact that he had only half
emancipated himself, as we shall see, from Plato’s tendency to
hypostatize ideas. The “Forms“ had for him, as the “Ideas“ had for
Plato, a metaphysical existence of their own, as conditioning all
individual things. And keenly as he followed the growth of ideas out of
experience, it is none the less true that these ideas, especially at the
point where they are farthest removed from experience and immediate
perception, are metamorphosed in the end from a logical product of human
thought into an immediate presentment of a supersensible world, and the
object, in that sense, of an intellectual intuition.’</p>
<p>I do not see how Aristotle could have found a reply to this
criticism.</p>
<p>The only answer that I can imagine would be one that maintained that
no two things could have the same form. If a man makes two brass spheres
(we should have to say), each has its own special sphericity, which is
substantial and particular, an instance of the universal ‘sphericity’,
but not identical with it. I do not think the language of the passages I
quoted would readily support this interpretation. And it would be open
to the objection that the particular sphericity would, on Aristotle’s
view, be unknowable, whereas it is of the essence of his metaphysics
that, as there comes to be more of form and less of matter, things
become gradually more knowable. This is not consistent with the rest of
his views unless the form can be embodied in many particular things. If
he were to say that there are as many forms that are instances of
sphericity as there are spherical things, he would have to make very
radical alterations in his philosophy. For instance, his view that a
form is identical with its essence is incompatible with the above
suggested escape.</p>
<p>The doctrine of matter and form in Aristotle is connected with the
distinction of potentiality and actuality. Bare matter is conceived as a
potentiality of form; all change is what we should call ‘evolution’, in
the sense that after the change the thing in question has more form than
before. That which has more form is considered to be more ‘actual’. God
is pure form and pure actuality; in Him, therefore, there can be no
change. It will be seen that this doctrine is optimistic and
teleological: the universe and everything in it is developing towards
something continually better than what went before.</p>
<p>The concept of potentiality is convenient in some connections,
provided it is so used that we can translate our statements into a form
in which the concept is absent. ‘A block of marble is a potential
statue’ means ’from a</p>
<p>block of marble, by suitable acts, a statue is produced.’ But when
potentiality is used as a fundamental and irreducible concept, it always
conceals confusion of thought. Aristotle’s use of it is one of the bad
points in his system.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s theology is interesting, and closely connected with the
rest of his metaphysics—indeed, ‘theology’ is one of his names for what
we call ‘metaphysics’. (The book which we know under that name was not
so called by him.)</p>
<p>There are, he says, three kinds of substances: those that are
sensible and perishable, those that are sensible but not perishable, and
those that are neither sensible nor perishable. The first class includes
plants and animals, the second includes the heavenly bodies (which
Aristotle believed to undergo no change except motion), the third
includes the rational soul in man, and also God.</p>
<p>The main argument for God is the First Cause: there must be something
which originates motion, and this something must itself be unmoved, and
must be eternal, substance, and actuality. The object of desire and the
object of thought, Aristotle says, cause movement in this way, without
themselves being in motion. So God produces motion by being loved,
whereas every other cause of motion works by being itself in motion
(like a billiard ball). God is pure thought; for thought is what is
best. ‘Life also belongs to God; for the actuality of thought is life,
and God is that actuality; and God’s self-dependent actuality is life
most good and eternal. We say therefore that God is a living being,
eternal, most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal
belong to God; for this is God’ (1072b).</p>
<p>‘It is clear then from what has been said that there is a substance
which is eternal and unmovable and separate from sensible things. It has
been shown that this substance cannot have any magnitude, but is without
parts and indivisible…. But it has also been shown that it is impassive
and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior to change of
place’ (1073a).</p>
<p>God does not have the attributes of a Christian Providence, for it
would derogate from His perfection to think about anything except what
is perfect, i.e. Himself. ‘It must be of itself that the divine thought
thinks (since it is the most excellent of things), and its thinking is a
thinking on thinking’ (1074b). We must infer that God does not know of
the existence of our sublunary world. Aristotle, like Spinoza, holds
that, while men must love God, it is impossible that God should love
men.</p>
<p>God is not definable as ‘the unmoved mover’. On the contrary,
astronomical considerations lead to the conclusion that there are either
forty-seven or fifty-five unmoved movers (1074a). The relation of these
to God is not made clear; indeed the natural interpretation would be
that there are forty-seven or fifty-five gods. For after one of the
above passages on God Aristotle proceeds: ‘We must not ignore the
question whether we are to suppose one such substance or more than one,’
and at once embarks upon the argument that leads to the forty-seven or
fifty-five unmoved movers.</p>
<p>The conception of an unmoved mover is a difficult one. To a modern
mind, it would seem that the cause of a change must be a previous
change, and that, if the universe were ever wholly static, it would
remain so eternally. To understand what Aristotle means, we must take
account of what he says about causes. There are, according to him, four
kinds of causes, which were called, respectively, material, formal,
efficient, and final. Let us take again the man who is making a statue.
The material cause of the statue is the marble, the formal cause is the
essence of the statue to be produced, the efficient cause is the contact
of the chisel with the marble, and the final cause is the end that the
sculptor has in view. In modern terminology, the word ‘cause’ would be
confined to the efficient cause. The unmoved mover may be regarded as a
final cause: it supplies a purpose for change, which is essentially an
evolution towards likeness with God.</p>
<p>I said that Aristotle was not by temperament deeply religious, but
this is only partly true. One could, perhaps, interpret one aspect of
his religion, somewhat freely, as follows:</p>
<p>God exists eternally, as pure thought, happiness, complete
self-fulfilment, without any unrealized purposes. The sensible world, on
the contrary, is imperfect, but it has life, desire, thought of an
imperfect kind, and aspiration. All living things are in a greater or
less degree aware of God, and are moved to action by admiration and love
of God. Thus God is the final cause of all activity. Change consists in
giving form to matter, but, where sensible things are concerned, a
substratum of matter always remains. Only God consists of form without
matter. The world is continually evolving towards a greater degree of
form, and thus becoming progressively more like God. But the process
cannot be completed, because matter cannot be wholly eliminated. This is
a religion of progress and evolution, for God’s static perfection moves
the world only through the love that finite beings feel for Him. Plato
was mathematical, Aristotle was biological; this accounts for the
differences in their religions.</p>
<p>This would, however, be a one-sided view of Aristotle’s religion; he
has also the Greek love of static perfection and preference for
contemplation rather than action. His doctrine of the soul illustrates
this aspect of his philosophy.</p>
<p>Whether Aristotle taught immortality in any form, or not, was a vexed
question among commentators. Averroes, who held that he did not, had
followers in Christian countries, of whom the more extreme were called
Epicureans, and whom Dante found in hell. In fact, Aristotle’s doctrine
is complex, and easily lends itself to misunderstandings. In his book On
the Soul, he regards the soul as bound up with the body, and ridicules
the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration (407b). The soul, it seems,
perishes with the body: ‘it indubitably follows that the soul is
inseparable from its body’ (413a); but he immediately adds: ‘or at any
rate certain parts of it are’. Body and soul are related as matter and
form: ‘the soul must be a substance in the sense of the form of a
material body having life potentially within it. But substance is
actuality, and thus soul is the actuality of a body as above
characterized’ (412a). Soul ‘is substance in the sense which corresponds
to the definitive formula of a thing’s essence. That means that it is
the “essential whatness“ of a body of the character just assigned’
(i.e. having life) (412b). The soul is the first grade of actuality of a
natural body having life potentially in it. The body so described is a
body which is organized (412a). To ask whether soul and body are one is
as meaningless as to ask whether the wax and the shape given it by the
stamp are one (412b). Self-nutrition is the only psychic power possessed
by plants (413a). The soul is the final cause of the body (414a).</p>
<p>In this book, he distinguishes between ‘soul’ and ‘mind’, making mind
higher than soul, and less bound to the body. After speaking of the
relation of soul and body, he says: ‘The case of mind is different; it
seems to be an independent substance implanted within the soul and to be
incapable of being destroyed’ (408b). Again: ‘We have no evidence as yet
about mind or the power to think; it seems to be a widely different kind
of soul, differing as what is eternal from what is perishable; it alone
is capable of existence in isolation from all other psychic powers. All
the other parts of soul, it is evident from what we have said, are, in
spite of certain statements to the contrary, incapable of separate
existence’ (413b). The mind is the part of us that understands
mathematics and philosophy; its objects are timeless, and therefore it
is regarded as itself timeless. The soul is what moves the body and
perceives sensible objects; it is characterized by self-nutrition,
sensation, feeling, and motivity (413b); but the mind has the higher
function of thinking, which has no relation to the body or to the
senses. Hence the mind can be immortal, though the rest of the soul
cannot.</p>
<p>To understand Aristotle’s doctrine of the soul, we must remember that
the soul is the ‘form’ of the body, and that spatial shape is one kind
of ‘form’. What is there in common between soul and shape? I think what
is in common is the conferring of unity upon a certain amount of matter.
The part of a block of marble which afterwards becomes a statute is, as
yet, not separated from the rest of the marble; it is not yet a ‘thing’,
and has not yet any unity. After the sculptor has made the statue, it
has unity, which it derives from its shape. Now the essential feature of
the soul, in virtue of which it is the ‘form’ of the body, is that it
makes the body an organic whole, having purposes as a unit. A single
organ has purposes lying outside itself; the eye, in isolation, cannot
see. Thus many things can be said in which an animal or plant as a whole
is the subject, which cannot be said about any part of it. It is in this
sense that organization, or form, confers substantiality. That which
confers substantiality upon a plant or animal is what Aristotle calls
its ‘soul’. But ‘mind’ is something different, less intimately bound up
with the body; perhaps it is a part of the soul, but it is possessed by
only a small minority of living beings (415a). Mind as speculation
cannot be the cause of movement, for it never thinks about what is
practicable, and never says what is to be avoided or what pursued
(432b).</p>
<p>A similar doctrine, though with a slight change of terminology, is
set forth in the Nicomachean Ethics. There is in the soul one element
that is rational, and one that is irrational. The irrational part is
two-fold: the vegetative, which is found in everything living, even in
plants, and the appetitive, which exists in all animals (1102b). The
life of the rational soul consists in contemplation, which is the
complete happiness of man though not fully attainable. ‘Such a life
would be too high for man; for it is not in so far as he is man that he
will live so, but in so far as something divine is present in him; and
by so much as this is superior to our composite nature is its activity
superior to that which is the exercise of the other kind of virtue (the
practical kind). If reason is divine, then, in comparison with man, the
life in accordance with it is divine in comparison with human life. But
we must not follow those who advise us, being men, to think of human
things, and being mortal, of mortal things, but must, so far as we can,
make ourselves immortal, and strain every nerve to live in accordance
with the best thing in us; for even if it be small in bulk, much more
does it in power and worth surpass everything’ (1177b).</p>
<p>It seems, from these passages, that individuality—what distinguishes
one man from another—is connected with the body and the irrational soul,
while the rational soul or mind is divine and impersonal. One man likes
oysters, and another likes pineapples; this distinguishes between them.
But when they think about the multiplication table, provided they think
correctly, there is no difference between them. The irrational separates
us, the rational unites us. Thus the immortality of mind or reason is
not a personal immortality of separate men, but a share in God’s
immortality. It does not appear that Aristotle believed in personal
immortality, in the sense in which it was taught by Plato and afterwards
by Christianity. He believed only that, in so far as men are rational,
they partake of the divine, which is immortal. It is open to man to
increase the element of the divine in his nature, and to do so is the
highest virtue. But if he succeeded completely, he would have ceased to
exist as a separate person. This is perhaps not the only possible
interpretation of Aristotle’s words, but I think it is the most
natural.</p>
