<h4 id="lockes-influence">15 LOCKE’S INFLUENCE</h4>
<p>From the time of Locke down to the present day, there have been in
Europe two main types of philosophy, and one of these owes both its
doctrines and its method to Locke, while the other was derived first
from Descartes and then from Kant. Kant himself thought that he had made
a synthesis of the philosophy derived from Descartes and that derived
from Locke; but this cannot be admitted, at least from a historical
point of view, for the followers of Kant were in the Cartesian, not the
Lockean, tradition. The heirs of Locke are, first, Berkeley and Hume;
second, those of the French philosophes who did not belong to the school
of Rousseau; third, Bentham and the philosophical Radicals; fourth, with
important accretions from Continental philosophy, Marx and his
disciples. But Marx’s system is eclectic, and any simple statement about
it is almost sure to be false; I will, therefore, leave him on one side
until I come to consider him in detail.</p>
<p>In Locke’s own day, his chief philosophical opponents were the
Cartesians and Leibniz. Quite illogically, the victory of Locke’s
philosophy in England and France was largely due to the prestige of
Newton. Descartes’ authority as a philosopher was enhanced, in his own
day, by his work in mathematics and natural philosophy. But his doctrine
of vortices was definitely inferior to Newton’s law of gravitation as an
explanation of the solar system. The victory of the Newtonian cosmogony
diminished men’s respect for Descartes and increased their respect for
England. Both these causes inclined men favourably towards Locke. In
eighteenth-century France, where the intellectuals were in rebellion
against an antiquated, corrupt, and effete despotism, they regarded
England as the home of freedom, and were predisposed in favour of
Locke’s philosophy by his political doctrines. In the last times before
the Revolution, Locke’s influence in France was reinforced by that of
Hume, who lived for a time in France and was personally acquainted with
many of the leading savants.</p>
<p>The chief transmitter of English influence to France was
Voltaire.</p>
<p>In England, the philosophical followers of Locke, until the French
Revolution, took no interest in his political doctrines. Berkeley was a
bishop not much interested in politics; Hume was a Tory who followed the
lead of Bolingbroke. England was politically quiescent in their time,
and a philosopher could be content to theorize without troubling himself
about the state of the world. The French Revolution changed this, and
forced the best minds into opposition to the status quo. Nevertheless,
the tradition in pure philosophy remained unbroken. Shelley’s Necessity
of Atheism, for which he was expelled from Oxford, is full of Locke’s
influence.1</p>
<p>Until the publication of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason in 1781, it
might have seemed as if the older philosophical tradition of Descartes,
Spinoza and Leibniz were being definitely overcome by the newer
empirical method. This newer method, however, had never prevailed in
German universities, and after 1792 it was held responsible for the
horrors of the Revolution. Recanting revolutionaries such as Coleridge
found in Kant an intellectual support for their opposition to French
atheism. The Germans, in their resistance to the French, were glad to
have a German philosophy to uphold them. Even the French, after the fall
of Napoleon, were glad of any weapon against Jacobinism. All these
factors favoured Kant.</p>
<p>Kant, like Darwin, gave rise to a movement which he would have
detested. Kant was a liberal, a democrat, a pacifist, but those who
professed to develop his philosophy were none of these things. Or, if
they still called themselves Liberals, they were Liberals of a new
species. Since Rousseau and Kant, there have been two schools of
Liberalism, which may be distinguished as the hard-headed and the
soft-hearted. The hard-headed developed, through Bentham, Ricardo, and
Marx, by logical stages into Stalin; the soft-hearted, by other logical
stages, through Fichte, Byron, Carlyle, and Nietzsche, into Hitler. That
statement, of course, is too schematic to be quite true, but it may
serve as a map and a mnemonic. The stages in the evolution of ideas have
had almost the quality of the Hegelian dialectic: doctrines have
developed, by steps that each seem natural, into their opposites. But
the developments have not been due solely to the inherent movement of
ideas; they have been governed, throughout, by external circumstances
and the reflection of these circumstances in human emotions. That this
is the case may be made evident by one outstanding fact: that the ideas
of liberalism have undergone no part of this development in America,
where they remain to this day as in Locke.</p>
<p>Leaving politics on one side, let us examine the differences between
the two schools of philosophy, which may be broadly distinguished as the
Continental and the British respectively.</p>
<p>There is first of all a difference of method. British philosophy is
more detailed and piecemeal than that of the Continent; when it allows
itself some general principle, it sets to work to prove it inductively
by examining its various applications. Thus Hume, after announcing that
there is no idea without an antecedent impression, immediately proceeds
to consider the following objection: suppose you are seeing two shades
of colour which are similar but not identical, and suppose you have
never seen a shade of colour intermediate between the two, can you,
nevertheless, imagine such a shade? He does not decide the question, and
considers that a decision adverse to his general principle would not be
fatal to him, because his principle is not logical but empirical.
When—to take a contrast—Leibniz wants to establish his monadology, he
argues, roughly, as follows: Whatever is complex must be composed of
simple parts; what is simple cannot be extended; therefore everything is
composed of parts having no extension. But what is not extended is not
matter. Therefore the ultimate constituents of things are not material,
and, if not material, then mental. Consequently a table is really a
colony of souls.</p>
<p>The difference of method, here, may be characterized as follows: In
Locke or Hume, a comparatively modest conclusion is drawn from a broad
survey of many facts, whereas in Leibniz a vast edifice of deduction is
pyramided upon a pin-point of logical principle. In Leibniz, if the
principle is completely true and the deductions are entirely valid, all
is well; but the structure is unstable, and the slightest flaw anywhere
brings it down in ruins. In Locke or Hume, on the contrary, the base of
the pyramid is on the solid ground of observed fact, and the pyramid
tapers upward, not downward; consequently the equilibrium is stable, and
a flaw here or there can be rectified without total disaster. This
difference of method survived Kant’s attempt to incorporate something of
the empirical philosophy: from Descartes to Hegel on the one side, and
from Locke to John Stuart Mill on the other it remains unvarying.</p>
<p>The difference in method is connected with various other differences.
Let us take first metaphysics.</p>
<p>Descartes offered metaphysical proofs of the existence of God, of
which the most important had been invented in the eleventh century by St
Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury. Spinoza had a pantheistic God, who
seemed to the orthodox to be no God at all; however that may be,
Spinoza’s arguments were essentially metaphysical, and are traceable
(though he may not have realized this) to the doctrine that every
proposition must have a subject and a predicate. Leibniz’s metaphysics
had the same source.</p>
<p>In Locke, the philosophical direction that he inaugurated is not yet
fully developed; he accepts as valid Descartes’ arguments as to the
existence of God. Berkeley invented a wholly new argument; but Hume—in
whom the new philosophy comes to completion—rejected metaphysics
entirely, and held that nothing can be discovered by reasoning on the
subjects with which metaphysics is concerned. This view persisted in the
empirical school, while the opposite view, somewhat modified, persisted
in Kant and his disciples.</p>
<p>In ethics, there is a similar division between the two schools.</p>
<p>Locke, as we saw, believed pleasure to be the good, and this was the
prevalent view among empiricists throughout the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. Their opponents, on the contrary, despised
pleasure as ignoble, and had various systems of ethics which seemed more
exalted. Hobbes valued power, and Spinoza, up to a point, agreed with
Hobbes. There are in Spinoza two unreconciled views on ethics, one that
of Hobbes, the other that the good consists in mystic union with God.
Leibniz made no important contribution to ethics, but Kant made ethics
supreme, and derived his metaphysics from ethical premisses. Kant’s
ethic is important, because it is anti-utilitarian, a priori, and what
is called ‘noble’.</p>
<p>Kant says that if you are kind to your brother because you are fond
of him, you have no moral merit: an act only has moral merit when it is
performed because the moral law enjoins it. Although pleasure is not the
good, it is nevertheless unjust—so Kant maintains—that the virtuous
should suffer. Since this often happens in this world, there must be
another world where they are rewarded after death, and there must be a
God to secure justice in the life hereafter. He rejects all the old
metaphysical arguments for God and immortality, but considers his new
ethical argument irrefutable.</p>
<p>Kant himself was a man whose outlook on practical affairs was kindly
and humanitarian, but the same cannot be said of most of those who
rejected happiness as the good. The sort of ethic that is called ‘noble’
is less associated with attempts to improve the world than is the more
mundane view that we should seek to make men happier. This is not
surprising. Contempt for happiness is easier when the happiness is other
people’s than when it is our own. Usually the substitute for happiness
is some form of heroism. This affords unconscious outlets for the
impulse to power, and abundant excuses for cruelty. Or, again, what is
valued may be strong emotion; this was the case with the romantics. This
led to a toleration of such passions as hatred and revenge; Byron’s
heroes are typical, and are never persons of exemplary behaviour. The
men who did most to promote human happiness were—as might have been
expected—those who thought happiness important, not those who despised
it in comparison with something more ‘sublime’. Moreover, a man’s ethic
usually reflects his character, and benevolence leads to a desire for
the general happiness. Thus the men who thought happiness the end of
life tended to be the more benevolent, while those who proposed other
ends were often dominated, unconsciously, by cruelty or love of
power.</p>
<p>These ethical differences are associated, usually though not
invariably, with differences in politics. Locke, as we saw, is tentative
in his beliefs, not at all authoritarian, and willing to leave every
question to be decided by free discussion. The result, both in his case
and in that of his followers, was a belief in reform, but of a gradual
sort. Since their systems of thought were piecemeal, and the result of
separate investigations of many different questions, their political
views tended naturally to have the same character. They fought shy of
large programmes all cut out of one block, and preferred to consider
each question on its merits. In politics, as in philosophy, they were
tentative and experimental. Their opponents, on the other hand, who
thought they could ‘grasp this sorry scheme of things entire’, were much
more willing to ‘shatter it to bits and then remould it nearer to the
heart’s desire’. They might do this as revolutionaries, or as men who
wished to increase the authority of the powers that be; in either case,
they did not shrink from violence in pursuit of vast objectives, and
they condemned love of peace as ignoble.</p>
<p>The great political defect of Locke and his disciples, from a modern
point of view, was their worship of property. But those who criticized
them on this account often did so in the interest of classes that were
more harmful than the capitalists, such as monarchs, aristocrats, and
militarists. The aristocratic landowner, whose income comes to him
without effort and in accordance with immemorial custom, does not think
of himself as a money grubber, and is not so thought of by men who do
not look below the picturesque surface. The business man, on the
contrary, is engaged in the conscious pursuit of wealth, and while his
activities were more or less novel they roused a resentment not felt
towards the gentlemanly exactions of the landowner. That is to say, this
was the case with middle-class writers and those who read them; it was
not the case with the peasants, as appeared in the French and Russian
Revolutions. But peasants are inarticulate.</p>
<p>Most of the opponents of Locke’s school had an admiration for war, as
being heroic and involving a contempt for comfort and ease. Those who
adopted a utilitarian ethic, on the contrary, tended to regard most wars
as folly. This, again, at least in the nineteenth century, brought them
into alliance with the capitalists, who disliked wars because they
interfered with trade. The capitalists’ motive was, of course, pure
self-interest, but it led to views more consonant with the general
interest than those of militarists and their literary supporters. The
attitude of capitalists to war, it is true, has fluctuated. England’s
wars of the eighteenth century, except the American war, were on the
whole profitable, and were supported by business men; but throughout the
nineteenth century until its last years, they favoured peace. In modern
times, big business, everywhere, has come into such intimate relations
with the national State that the situation is greatly changed. But even
now, both in England and in America, big business on the whole dislikes
war.</p>
<p>Enlightened self-interest is, of course, not the loftiest of motives,
but those who decry it often substitute, by accident or design, motives
which are much worse, such as hatred, envy, and love of power. On the
whole, the school which owed its origin to Locke, and which preached
enlightened self-interest, did more to increase human happiness, and
less to increase human misery, than was done by the schools which
despised it in the name of heroism and self-sacrifice. I do not forget
the horrors of early industrialism, but these, after all, were mitigated
within the system. And I set against them Russian serfdom, the evils of
war and its aftermath of fear and hatred, and the inevitable
obscurantism of those who attempt to preserve ancient systems when they
have lost their vitality.</p>
