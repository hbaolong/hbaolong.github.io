<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>1 This opinion was not unknown in earlier times: it is stated, for
example, in the Antigone of Sophocles. But before the Stoics those who
held it were few.</p>
<p>2 That is why the modern Russian does not think that we ought to obey
dialectical materialism rather than Stalin.</p>
<p>1 THE RISE OF GREEK CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>1 Arithmetic and some geometry existed among the Egyptians and
Babylonians, but mainly in the form of rules of thumb. Deductive
reasoning from general premisses was a Greek innovation.</p>
<p>2 Diana was the Latin equivalent of Artemis. It is Artemis who is
mentioned in the Greek Testament where our translation speaks of
Diana.</p>
<p>3 She has a male twin or consort, the ‘Master of Animals’, but he is
less prominent. It was at a later date that Artemis was identified with
the Great Mother of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>4 See The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and Its Survival in Greek
Religion, by Martin P. Nilsson, p. 11 ff.</p>
<p>5 See P. N. Ure, The Origin of Tyranny.</p>
<p>6 For instance, ‘Gimel’, the third letter of the Hebrew alphabet,
means ‘camel’, and the sign for it is a conventionalized picture of a
camel.</p>
<p>7 Beloch, Griechische Geschichte, chap. xii.</p>
<p>8 Rostovtseff, History of the Ancient World, Vol. I, p. 399.</p>
<p>9 Five Stages of Greek Religion, p. 67.</p>
<p>10 Primitive Culture in Greece, H. J. Rose, 1925, p. 193.</p>
<p>11 Zoroaster’s date, however, is very conjectural. Some place it as
early as 1000 B.C. See Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. IV, p. 207.</p>
<p>12 As a result of the defeat of Athens by Sparta, the Persians
regained the whole coast of Asia Minor, to which their right was
acknowledged in the Peace of Antalcidas (387–6 B.C.). About fifty years
later, they were incorporated in Alexander’s empire.</p>
<p>13 Rose, Primitive Greece, p. 65 ff.</p>
<p>14 J. E. Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion,
p. 651.</p>
<p>15 I mean mental intoxication, not intoxication by alcohol.</p>
<p>16 The verse translations in this chapter are by Professor Gilbert
Murray.</p>
<p>17 Mystically indentified with Dionysus.</p>
<p>18 One of the many names of Dionysus.</p>
<p>19 On the other hand Cornford’s books on various Platonic dialogues
seem to me wholly admirable.</p>
<p>2 THE MILESIAN SCHOOL</p>
<p>1 Rostovtsev, History of the Ancient World, Vol. I, p. 204.</p>
<p>2 Burnet (Early Greek Philosophy, p. 51) questions this last
saying.</p>
<p>3 PYTHAGORAS</p>
<p>1 The Greek cities of Sicily were in danger from the Carthaginians,
but in Italy this danger was not felt to be imminent.</p>
<p>2 Aristotle says of him that he ‘first worked at mathematics and
arithmetic, and afterwards, at one time, condescended to the
wonder-working practised by Pherecydes.’</p>
<p>3 Clown: What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?</p>
<p>Malvolio: That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a
bird.</p>
<p>Clown: What thinkest thou of his opinion?</p>
<p>Malvolio: I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his
opinion.</p>
<p>Clown: Fare thee well; remain thou still in darkness; thou shalt hold
the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits. (Twelfth
Night.)</p>
<p>4 Quoted from Burnet’s Early Greek Philosophy.</p>
<p>5 Cornford, op. cit., p. 201.</p>
<p>6 Early Greek Philosophy, p. 108.</p>
<p>7 But not by Euclid. See Heath, Greek Mathematics. The above proof
was probably known to Plato.</p>
<p>8 ‘Self-evident’ was substituted by Franklin for Jefferson’s ‘sacred
and undeniable.’</p>
<p>4 HERACLITUS</p>
<p>1 Quoted from Edwyn Bevan, Stoics and Sceptics, Oxford, 1913,
p. 121.</p>
<p>2 Cornford, op. cit. (p. 184), emphasizes this, 1 think rightly.
Heraclitus is often misunderstood through being assimilated to other
Ionians.</p>
<p>3 But cf. ‘We step and do not step into the same rivers: we are, and
are not.’</p>
<p>5 PARMENIDES</p>
<p>1 Burnet’s note; ‘The meaning, I think, is this…. There can be no
thought corresponding to a name that is not the name of something
real.’</p>
<p>6 EMPEDOCLES</p>
<p>1 It does not appear who ‘they’ are, but one may assume that they are
those who have preserved purity.</p>
<p>9 THE ATOMISTS</p>
<p>1 Cyril Bailey, The Greek Atomists and Epicurus, estimates that he
flourished about 430 B.C. or a little earlier.</p>
<p>2 From Thales to Plato, p. 193.</p>
<p>3 Greek Mathematics, Vol. I, p. 176.</p>
<p>4 On Generation and Corruption, 316a.</p>
<p>5 This interpretation is adopted by Burnet, and also, at least as
regards Leucippus, by Bailey (op. cit., p. 83).</p>
<p>6 See Bailey, op. cit., p. 121, on the determinism of Democritus.</p>
<p>7 On the logical and mathematical grounds for the theories of the
atomists, see Gaston Milhand, Les Philosophes Géomètres de la Grèce,
chap. iv.</p>
<p>8 On Generation and Corruption, 325a.</p>
<p>9 Bailey (op. cit., p. 75) maintains, on the contrary, that Leucippus
had an answer, which was ‘extremely subtle’. It consisted essentially in
admitting the existence of something (the void) which was not corporeal.
Similarly Burnet says: ‘It is a curious fact that the Atomists, who are
commonly regarded as the great materialists of antiquity, were actually
the first to say distinctly that a thing might be real without being a
body.’</p>
<p>10 On the way in which this was supposed to happen, see Bailey, op.
cit., p. 138 ff.</p>
<p>11 ‘Poverty in a democracy is as much to be preferred to what is
called prosperity under despots as freedom is to slavery,’ he says.</p>
<p>10 PROTAGORAS</p>
<p>1 It ended in 404 B.C. with the complete overthrow of Athens.</p>
<p>11 SOCRATES</p>
<p>1 In quotations from Plato, I have generally used Jowett’s
translation.</p>
<p>2 In The Clouds, Socrates is represented as denying the existence of
Zeus.</p>
<p>3 Cf. Acts, v. 29.</p>
<p>12 THE INFLUENCE OF SPARTA</p>
<p>1 Not to mention Dr. Thomas Arnold and the English public
schools.</p>
<p>2 Bury, History of Greece, Vol. I, p. 138. It seems that Spartan men
ate nearly six times as much as their wives.</p>
<p>3 In speaking of ‘democratic’ elements in the Spartan constitution,
one must of course remember that the citizens as a whole were a ruling
class fiercely tyrannizing over the helots, and allowing no power to the
perioeci.</p>
<p>4 History of Greece, Vol. I, p. 141.</p>
<p>5 Politics, Vol. II, 9 (1269B–1270A).</p>
<p>6 In quoting Plutarch I use North’s translation.</p>
<p>14 PLATO’S UTOPIA</p>
<p>1 ‘These women shall be, without exception, the common wives of these
men, and no one shall have a wife of his own.’</p>
<p>2 See Henry C. Lea, A History of Sacerdotal Celibacy.</p>
<p>16 PLATO’S THEORY OF IMMORTALITY</p>
<p>1 Even for many Christians, it is second only to the death of Christ.
‘There is nothing in any tragedy, ancient or modern, nothing in poetry
or history (with one exception), like the last hours of Socrates in
Plato.’ These are the words of the Rev. Benjamin Jowett.</p>
<p>17 PLATO’S COSMOGONY</p>
<p>1 This dialogue contains much that is obscure and has given rise to
controversies among commentators. On the whole, I find myself in most
agreement with Cornford’s admirable book, Plato’s Cosmology.</p>
<p>2 Vaughan must have been reading this passage when he wrote the poem
beginning ‘I saw eternity the other night.’</p>
<p>3 Cornford (op. cit.) points out that ‘necessity’ is not to be
confounded with the modern conception of a deterministic reign of law.
The things that happen through ‘necessity’ are those not brought about
by a purpose: they are chaotic and not subject to laws.</p>
<p>4 See Heath, Greek Mathematics, Vol. I, pp. 159, 162, 294–296.</p>
<p>5 For a reconciliation of the two statements, see Cornford, op. cit.,
p. 219.</p>
<p>6 Heath, op. cit., p. 161.</p>
<p>18 KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION IN PLATO</p>
<p>1 It was presumably this passage that first suggested to F. C. S.
Schiller his admiration of Protagoras.</p>
<p>2 It seems that neither Plato nor the dynamic youths of Ephesus had
noticed that locomotion is impossible on the extreme Heraclitean
doctrine. Motion demands that a given thing A should be now here, now
there: it must remain the same thing while it moves. In the doctrine
that Plato examines there is change of quality and change of place, but
not change of substance. In this respect, modern quantum physics goes
further than the most extreme disciples of Heraclitus went in Plato’s
time. Plato would have thought this fatal to science, but it has not
proved so.</p>
<p>3 Compare the advertisement: ‘That’s Shell, that was.’</p>
<p>4 On this subject see the last chapter of the present work.</p>
<p>19 ARISTOTLE’S METAPHYSICS</p>
<p>1 The Greek Philosophers, Vol. I, p. 285.</p>
<p>2 Ethics, 1170B.</p>
<p>3 On interpretation, 17a.</p>
<p>4 Aristotle, Vol. I, p. 204.</p>
<p>20 ARISTOTLE’S ETHICS</p>
<p>1 ‘The Greek word means, literally, ’great-souled’, and is usually
translated ‘magnanimous’, but the Oxford translation renders it ‘proud’.
Neither word, in its modern usage, quite expresses Aristotle’s meaning,
but I prefer ‘magnanimous’, and have therefore substituted it for
‘proud’ in the above quotation from the Oxford translation.</p>
<p>2 It is true that Aristotle also says this (1105a), but as he means
it the consequences are not so far-reaching as in the Christian
interpretation.</p>
<p>21 ARISTOTLE’S POLITICS</p>
<p>1 Cf. The Noodle’s Oration in Sydney Smith; ‘If the proposal be
sound, would the Saxon have passed it by? Would the Dane have ignored
it? Would it have escaped the wisdom of the Norman?’ (I quote from
memory.)</p>
<p>2 This was written in May, 1941.</p>
<p>24 EARLY GREEK MATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY</p>
<p>1 Greek Mathematics, Vol. I, p. 145.</p>
<p>2 De Caelo, 295b</p>
<p>3 Aristarchus of Samos, the Ancient Copernicus. By Sir Thomas Heath,
Oxford, 1913. What follows is based on this book.</p>
<p>4 Greek Mathematics, Vol. II, p. 253.</p>
<p>5 Posidonius was Cicero’s teacher. He flourished in the latter half
of the second century B.C.</p>
<p>25 THE HELLENISTIC WORLD</p>
<p>1 This is not historically true.</p>
<p>2 Perhaps this is no longer true, as the sons of those who held this
belief have been educated at Eton.</p>
<p>3 Quoted in Bevan, House of Seleucus, Vol. I, p. 298n.</p>
<p>4 The king, not the astronomer.</p>
<p>5 Annals, Book VI, chap. 42.</p>
<p>6 See Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. VII, pp. 194–5.</p>
<p>7 ‘The Social Question in the Third Century’, by W. T. Tarn, in The
Hellenistic Age by various authors. Cambridge, 1923. This essay is
exceedingly interesting, and contains many facts not elsewhere readily
accessible.</p>

<p>8 Ibid.</p>
<p>27 THE EPICUREANS</p>
<p>1 The Greek Atomists and Epicurus, by Cyril Bailey, Oxford, 1928,
p. 221. Mr. Bailey has made a specialty of Epicurus, and his book is
invaluable to the student.</p>
<p>2 The Stoics were very unjust to Epicurus. Epictetus, for example,
addressing him, says: ‘This is the life of which you pronounce yourself
worthy: eating, drinking, copulation, evacuation and snoring.’ Book II,
chap. xx, Discourses of Epictetus.</p>
<p>3 Gilbert Murray, Five Stages, p. 130.</p>
<p>4 About five pounds.</p>
<p>5 The Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers, by W. J. Oates, p. 47. Where
possible, I have availed myself of Mr Oates’s translations.</p>
<p>6 (For Epicurus) ‘Absence of pain is in itself pleasure, indeed in
his ultimate analysis the truest pleasure.’ Bailey, op. cit.,
p. 249.</p>
<p>7 On the subject of friendship and Epicurus’s amiable inconsistency,
see Bailey, op. cit., pp. 517–20.</p>
<p>8 An analogous view is urged in our day by Eddington, in his
interpretation of the principle of indeterminacy.</p>
<p>9 I quote the translation of Mr R. C. Trevelyan, Book I, 60–79.</p>
<p>10 Lucretius instances the sacrifice of Iphigenia as an example of
the harm wrought by religion, Book I, 85–100.</p>
<p>11 Book III, 1068–76. I again quote Mr. R. C. Trevelyan’s
translation.</p>
<p>28 STOICISM</p>
<p>1 Gilbert Murray, The Stoic Philosophy (1915), p. 25.</p>
<p>2 For the sources of what follows, see Bevan, Later Greek Religion,
p. 1 ff</p>
<p>3 See Barth, Die Stoa, 4th edition, Stuttgart, 1922.</p>
<p>4 Ibid.</p>
<p>5 Bevan, Stoics and Sceptics, p. 88.</p>
<p>6 He estimated that by sailing westward from Cadiz, India could be
reached after 70,000 stades. ‘This remark was the ultimate foundation of
Columbus’s confidence.’ Tarn, Hellenistic Civilization, p. 249.</p>
<p>7 The above account of Posidonius is mainly based on Chapter III of
Edwyn Bevan’s Stoics and Sceptics.</p>

<p>7 See Alchemy, Child of Greek Philosophy, by Arthur John Hopkins,
Columbia, 1934.</p>
<p>30 PLOTINUS</p>
<p>1 Concerning Gallienus, Gibbon remarks: ‘He was a master of several
curious but useless sciences, a ready orator and an elegant poet, a
skilful gardener, an excellent cook, and most contemptible prince. When
the great emergencies of the State required his presence and attention,
he was engaged in conversation with the philosopher Plotinus, wasting
his time in trifling or licentious pleasures, preparing his initiation
to the Grecian mysteries, or soliciting a place in the Areopagus of
Athens’ (chap. x).</p>
<p>2 Origen, who was a contemporary of Plotinus and had the same teacher
in philosophy, taught that the First Person was superior to the Second,
and the Second to the Third, agreeing in this with Plotinus. But
Origen’s view was subsequently declared heretical.</p>
<p>3 Fifth Ennead, Fifth Tractate, chap. 12.</p>
<p>4 Enneads, V, 3, 14. McKenna’s translation,</p>
<p>5 Enneads, V, 3, 17.</p>
<p>6 IV, 8, 1.</p>
<p>7 Plotinus habitually uses ‘There’ as a Christian might—as it is
used, for instance, in</p>
<p>The life that knows no ending,</p>
<p>The tearless life is There.</p>

<p>12 From them, probably, developed the sect of the Essenes, whose
doctrines seem to have influenced primitive Christianity. See Oesterley
and Robinson, History of Israel, Vol. II, p. 323 ff. The Pharisees also
descended from them.</p>

<p>1 This thesis seems to anticipate the outlook of feudalism.</p>
<p>2 Epistle xvii.</p>
<p>3 Ibid. xx.</p>
<p>4 This allusion to the Books of Samuel begins a line of biblical
argument against kings which persisted throughout the Middle Ages, and
even in the conflict of the Puritans with the Stuarts. It appears for
instance in Milton.</p>

<p>7 Ibid., p. 30.</p>
<p>8 This hostility to pagan literature persisted in the Church until
the eleventh century, except in Ireland, where the Olympian gods had
never been worshipped, and were therefore not feared by the Church.</p>

<p>3 Cambridge Medieval History, III, 455.</p>
<p>4 Ibid.</p>
<p>8 JOHN THE SCOT</p>
<p>1 This addition is redundant; it would make his name ‘Irish John from
Ireland’. In the ninth century ‘Scotus’ means ‘Irishman’.</p>
<p>2 Cambridge Medieval History, III, 501.</p>
<p>3 This question is discussed carefully in the Cambridge Medieval
History, III, chap. xix, and the conclusion is in favour of Irish
knowledge of Greek.</p>
<p>4 Loc. cit., pp. 507–8.</p>
<p>5 Loc. cit., p. 524.</p>

<p>3 See Henry C. Lea, The History of Sacerdotal Celibacy.</p>
<p>4 In 1046, it was decreed that a clerk’s son cannot be a bishop.
Later, it was decreed he could not be in holy orders.</p>
<p>5 I Corinthians vii. 9.</p>
<p>6 Cambridge Medieval History, V, 662.</p>
<p>10 MOHAMMEDAN CULTURE AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>1 The Hegira was Mohammed’s flight from Mecca to Medina.</p>
<p>2 Cambridge Medieval History, IV, 286.</p>
<p>3 It is said that Averroes was taken back into favour shortly before
his death.</p>
<p>11 THE TWELFTH CENTURY</p>
<p>1 He was said to be a pupil of Abélard, but this is doubtful.</p>
<p>2 There was an antipope throughout most of this time. At the death of
Hadrian IV, the two claimants, Alexander III and Victor IV, had a
tug-of-war for the papal mantle. Victor IV (who was the antipope),
having failed to snatch the mantle, obtained from his partisans a
substitute which he had prepared, but in his haste he put it on
inside-out.</p>
<p>3 ‘The greatness of St Bernard lay not in the qualities of his
intellect, but of his character.’—Encyclopaedia Britannica.</p>
<p>4 Medieval Latin hymns, rhymed and accentual, give expression,
sometimes sublime, sometimes gentle and pathetic, to the best side of
the religious feeling of the times.</p>
<p>12 THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p>1 See the life of Frederick II, by Hermann Kantorowicz.</p>
<p>13 ST THOMAS AQUINAS</p>
<p>1 When I did so in a broadcast, very many protests from Catholics
resulted.</p>
<p>2 But in Aristotle the argument leads to 47 or 55 Gods.</p>
<p>3 Summa contra Gentiles, Book I, chap. liii.</p>
<p>4 ‘Jesus answered, verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.’</p>
<p>14 FRANCISCAN SCHOOLMEN</p>
<p>1 Follower of Kindi: d. 950.</p>
<p>2 Astronomer, 805–885.</p>
<p>3 See Guillelmi de Ockham Opera Politica, Manchester University
Press, 1940.</p>
<p>4 E.g., Swineshead, Heytesbury, Gerson, and d’Ailly.</p>
<p>5 I do not here pause to criticize the use to which Occam puts these
terms.</p>
<p>6 For instance; Between Good Friday and Easter, Christ’s soul
descended into hell, whereas His body remained in the tomb of Joseph of
Arimathea. If the sensitive soul is distinct from the intellective soul,
did Christ’s sensitive soul spend this time in hell or in the tomb?</p>
<p>15 THE ECLIPSE OF THE PAPACY</p>
<p>1 See Cumont, Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism.</p>
<p>2 THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>1 Quoted from Burckhardt, Renaissance in Italy, part iv,
chap. ii.</p>
<p>2 Ibid.</p>
<p>3 Burckhardt, op. cit., part vi, chap. i.</p>
<p>3 MACHIAVELLI</p>
<p>1 This remained true until 1870.</p>
<p>2 It is curious to find this anticipation of Rousseau. It would be
amusing, and not wholly false, to interpret Machiavelli as a
disappointed romantic.</p>
<p>4 ERASMUS AND MORE</p>
<p>1 As regards the life of Erasmus, I have mainly followed the
excellent biography by Huizinga.</p>
<p>6 THE RISE OF SCIENCE</p>
<p>1 See Three Copernican Treatises, translated by Edward Rosen,
Chicago, 1939.</p>
<p>2 On this subject, see the chapter ‘Scientific Instruments’ in A
History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Sixteenth and
Seventeenth Centuries, by A. Wolf.</p>
<p>8 HOBBES’S LEVIATHAN</p>
<p>1 Elsewhere he says that the heathen gods were created by human fear,
but that our God is the First Mover.</p>
<p>9 DESCARTES</p>
<p>1 Descartes says it was a stove (poêle), but most commentators think
this impossible. Those who know old-fashioned Bavarian houses, however,
assure me that it is entirely credible.</p>
<p>2 The above argument, ‘I think, therefore I am’ (cogito ergo sum), is
known as Descartes’s cogito, and the process by which it is reached is
called ‘Cartesian doubt’.</p>
<p>13 LOCKE’S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>1 Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Book IV, chap. xvi,
sec. 4.</p>
<p>2 Op. cit., Book IV, chap. i.</p>
<p>3 The above quotations are from Book II, chap. xx.</p>
<p>4 Op. cit., Book IV, chap. iii, sec. 18.</p>
<p>14 LOCKE’S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>1 Quoted by Tawney in Religion and the Rise of Capitalism.</p>
<p>2 Cf. the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>3 ‘They are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to last
during his, not another’s pleasure.’</p>
<p>15 LOCKE’S INFLUENCE</p>
<p>1 Take, e.g., Shelley’s dictum: ‘When a proposition is offered to the
mind, it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which
it is composed.’</p>
<p>16 BERKELEY</p>
<p>1 E.g., ‘I was not drunk last night. I had only had two glasses:
besides, it is well known that I am a teetotaller.’</p>
<p>17 HUME</p>
<p>1 Book I, part iii, sec. iv.</p>
<p>2 Book I, part iii, sec. viii.</p>
<p>19 ROUSSEAU</p>
<p>1 The Council of Geneva ordered the two books to be burnt, and gave
instructions that Rousseau was to be arrested if he came to Geneva. The
French Government had ordered his arrest: the Sorbonne and the Parlement
of Paris condemned Emile.</p>
<p>2 We must except Pascal. ‘The heart has its reasons, of which reason
is ignorant’ is quite in Rousseau’s style.</p>
<p>3 ‘Un prêtre en bonne règle ne doit faire des enfants qu’aux femmes
mariées,’ he elsewhere reports a Savoyard priest as saying.</p>
<p>4 E.g., ‘There is often much difference between the will of all and
the general will: the latter considers only the common interest: the
former looks to private interest, and is only a sum of particular wills:
but take away from these same wills the more and the less which destroy
each other, and the general will remains as the sum of the
differences.’</p>
<p>5 Hegel selects for special praise the distinction between the
general will and the will of all. He says: ‘Rousseau would have made a
sounder contribution towards a theory of the State, if he had always
kept this distinction in sight’ (Logic, sec. 163).</p>
<p>22 HEGEL</p>
<p>1 The definition in German is: ‘Der Begriff der Idee, dem die Idee
als solche der Gegenstand, dem das Objekt sie ist.’ Except in Hegel,
Gegenstand and Objekt are synonyms.</p>
<p>2 Freedom of the Press, he says, does not consist in being allowed to
write what one wants: this view is crude and superficial. For instance,
the Press should not be allowed to render the Government or the police
contemptible.</p>
<p>23 BYRON</p>
<p>1 Maurois, Life of Byron.</p>
<p>2 Sartor Resartus, Book II, chap. vi.</p>
<p>24 SCHOPENHAUER</p>
<p>1 ‘The old woman dies, the burden departs.’</p>
<p>25 NIETZSCHE</p>
<p>1 I seem to remember that someone anticipated Mill in this
dictum.</p>
<p>2 In all quotations from Nietzsche, the italics are in the
original.</p>
<p>26 THE UTILITARIANS1</p>

II of my Freedom and Organization, 1814–1914.</p>
