<h4 id="lockes-theory-of-knowledge">13 LOCKE’S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE</h4>
<p>John Locke (1632–1704) is the apostle of the Revolution of 1688, the
most moderate and the most successful of all revolutions. Its aims were
modest, but they were exactly achieved, and no subsequent revolution has
hitherto been found necessary in England. Locke faithfully embodies its
spirit, and most of his works appeared within a few years of 1688. His
chief work in theoretical philosophy, the Essay Concerning Human
Understanding, was finished in 1687 and published in 1690. His First
Letter on Toleration was originally published in Latin in 1689, in
Holland, to which country Locke had found it prudent to withdraw in
1683. Two further letters on Toleration were published in 1690 and 1692.
His two Treatises on Government were licensed for printing in 1689, and
published soon afterwards. His book on Education was published in 1693.
Although his life was long, all his influential writings are confined to
the few years from 1687 to 1693. Successful revolutions are stimulating
to those who believe in them.</p>
<p>Locke’s father was a Puritan, who fought on the side of Parliament.
In the time of Cromwell, when Locke was at Oxford, the university was
still scholastic in its philosophy; Locke disliked both scholasticism
and the fanaticism of the Independents. He was much influenced by
Descartes. He became a physician, and his patron was Lord Shaftesbury,
Dryden’s ‘Achitophel’. When Shaftesbury fell in 1683, Locke fled with
him to Holland, and remained there until the Revolution. After the
Revolution, except for a few years during which he was employed at the
Board of Trade, his life was devoted to literary work and to numerous
controversies arising out of his books.</p>
<p>The years before the Revolution of 1688, when Locke could not,
without grave risk, take any part, theoretical or practical, in English
politics, were spent by him in composing his Essay Concerning Human
Understanding. This is his most important book, and the one upon which
his fame most securely rests; but his influence on the philosophy of
politics was so great and so lasting that he must be treated as the
founder of philosophical liberalism as much as of empiricism in theory
of knowledge.</p>
<p>Locke is the most fortunate of all philosophers. He completed his
work in theoretical philosophy just at the moment when the government of
his country fell into the hands of men who shared his political
opinions. Both in practice and in theory, the views which he advocated
were held, for many years to come, by the most vigorous and influential
politicians and philosophers. His political doctrines, with the
developments due to Montesquieu, are embedded in the American
Constitution, and are to be seen at work whenever there is a dispute
between President and Congress. The British Constitution was based upon
his doctrines until about fifty years ago, and so was that which the
French adopted in 1871.</p>
<p>His influence in eighteenth-century France, which was immense, was
primarily due to Voltaire, who as a young man spent some time in
England, and interpreted English ideas to his compatriots in the Lettres
philosophiques. The philosophes and the moderate reformers followed him;
the extreme revolutionaries followed Rousseau. His French followers,
rightly or wrongly believed in an intimate connection between his theory
of knowledge and his politics.</p>
<p>In England this connection is less evident. Of his two most eminent
followers, Berkeley was politically unimportant, and Hume was a Tory who
set forth his reactionary views in his History of England. But after the
time of Kant, when German idealism began to influence English thought,
there came to be again a connection between philosophy and politics: in
the main, the philosophers who followed the Germans were Conservative,
while the Benthamites, who were Radical, were in the tradition of Locke.
The correlation, however, is not invariable; T. H. Green, for example,
was a Liberal but an idealist.</p>
<p>Not only Locke’s valid opinions, but even his errors, were useful in
practice. Take, for example, his doctrine as to primary and secondary
qualities. The primary qualities are defined as those that are
inseparable from body, and are enumerated as solidity, extension,
figure, motion or rest, and number. The secondary qualities are all the
rest: colours, sounds, smells, etc. The primary qualities, he maintains,
are actually in bodies; the secondary qualities, on the contrary, are
only in the percipient. Without the eye, there would be no colours;
without the ear, no sounds, and so on. For Locke’s view as to secondary
qualities there are good grounds—jaundice, blue spectacles, etc. But
Berkeley pointed out that the same arguments apply to primary qualities.
Ever since Berkeley, Locke’s dualism on this point has been
philosophically out of date. Nevertheless, it dominated practical
physics until the rise of quantum theory in our own day. Not only was it
assumed, explicitly or tacitly, by physicists, but it proved fruitful as
a source of many very important discoveries. The theory that the
physical world consists only of matter in motion was the basis of the
accepted theories of sound, heat, light, and electricity. Pragmatically,
the theory was useful, however mistaken it may have been theoretically.
This is typical of Locke’s doctrines.</p>
<p>Locke’s philosophy, as it appears in the Essay, has throughout
certain merits and certain demerits. Both alike were useful: the
demerits are such only from a theoretical standpoint. He is always
sensible, and always willing to sacrifice logic rather than become
paradoxical. He enunciates general principles which, as the reader can
hardly fail to perceive, are capable of leading to strange consequences;
but whenever the strange consequences seem about to appear, Locke
blandly refrains from drawing them. To a logician this is irritating; to
a practical man, it is a proof of a sound judgment. Since the world is
what it is, it is clear that valid reasoning from sound principles
cannot lead to error; but a principle may be so nearly true as to
deserve theoretical respect, and yet may lead to practical consequences
which we feel to be absurd. There is therefore a justification for
common sense in philosophy, but only as showing that our theoretical
principles cannot be quite correct so long as their consequences are
condemned by an appeal to common sense which we feel to be irresistible.
The theorist may retort that common sense is no more infallible than
logic. But this retort, though made by Berkeley and Hume, would have
been wholly foreign to Locke’s intellectual temper.</p>
<p>A characteristic of Locke, which descended from him to the whole
Liberal movement, is lack of dogmatism. Some few certainties he takes
over from his predecessors: our own existence, the existence of God, and
the truth of mathematics. But wherever his doctrines differ from those
of his forerunners, they are to the effect that truth is hard to
ascertain, and that a rational man will hold his opinions with some
measure of doubt. This temper of mind is obviously connected with
religious toleration, with the success of parliamentary democracy, with
laissez-faire, and with the whole system of liberal maxims. Although he
is a deeply religious man, a devout believer in Christianity who accepts
revelation as a source of knowledge, he nevertheless hedges round
professed revelations with rational safeguards. On one occasion he says:
‘The bare testimony of revelation is the highest certainty,’ but on
another he says: ‘Revelation must be judged by reason.’ Thus in the end
reason remains supreme.</p>
<p>His chapter ‘Of Enthusiasm’ is instructive in this connection.
‘Enthusiasm’ had not then the same meaning as it has now; it meant the
belief in a personal revelation to a religious leader or to his
followers. It was a characteristic of the sects that had been defeated
at the Restoration. When there is a multiplicity of such personal
revelations, all inconsistent with each other, truth, or what passes as
such, becomes purely personal, and loses its social character. Love of
truth, which Locke considers essential, is a very different thing from
love of some particular doctrine which is proclaimed as the truth. One
unerring mark of love of truth, he says, is ‘not entertaining any
proposition with greater assurance than the proofs it is built upon will
warrant’. Forwardness to dictate, he says, shows failure of love of
truth. ‘Enthusiasm laying by reason, would set up revelation without it;
whereby in effect it takes away both reason and revelation, and
substitutes in the room of it the ungrounded fancies of a man’s own
brain.’ Men who suffer from melancholy or conceit are likely to have
‘persuasions of immediate intercourse with the Deity’. Hence odd actions
and opinions acquire Divine sanction, which flatters ‘men’s laziness,
ignorance, and vanity’. He concludes the chapter with the maxim already
quoted, that ‘revelation must be judged of by reason’.</p>
<p>What Locke means by ‘reason’ is to be gathered from his whole book.
There is, it is true, a chapter called ‘Of Reason’, but this is mainly
concerned to prove that reason does not consist of syllogistic
reasoning, and is summed up in the sentence: ‘God has not been so
sparing to men to make them barely two-legged creatures, and left it to
Aristotle to make them rational.’ Reason, as Locke uses the term,
consists of two parts: first, an inquiry as to what things we know with
certainty; second, an investigation of propositions which it is wise to
accept in practice, although they have only probability and not
certainty in their favour. ‘The grounds of probability,’ he says, ‘are
two: conformity with our own experience, or the testimony of others’
experience.’ The King of Siam, he remarks, ceased to believe what
Europeans told him when they mentioned ice.</p>
<p>In his chapter ‘Of Degrees of Assent’ he says that the degree of
assent we give to any proposition should depend upon the grounds of
probability in its favour. After pointing out that we must often act
upon probabilities that fall short of certainty, he says that the right
use of this consideration ’is mutual charity and forbearance. Since
therefore it is unavoidable to the greatest part of men, if not all, to
have several opinions, without certain and indubitable proofs of their
truth; and it carries too great an imputation of ignorance, lightness,
or folly, for men to quit and renounce their former tenets presently
upon the offer of an argument which they cannot immediately answer and
show the insufficiency of; it would, methinks, become all men to
maintain peace and the common offices of humanity and friendship in the
diversity of opinions, since we cannot reasonably expect that any one
should readily and obsequiously quit his own opinion, and embrace ours
with a blind resignation to an authority which the understanding of man
acknowledges not. For, however it may often mistake, it can own no other
guide but reason, nor blindly submit to the will and dictates of
another. If he you would bring over to your sentiments be one that
examines before he assents, you must give him leave at his leisure to go
over the account again, and, recalling what is out of his mind, examine
the particulars, to see on which side the advantage lies; and if he will
not think over arguments of weight enough to engage him anew in so much
pains, it is but what we do often ourselves in the like case; and we
should take it amiss if others should prescribe to us what points we
should study: and if he be one who wishes to take his opinions upon
trust, how can we imagine that he should renounce those tenets which
time and custom have so settled in his mind that he thinks them
self-evident, and of an unquestionable certainty; or which he takes to
be impressions he has received from God himself, or from men sent by
him? How can we expect, I say, that opinions thus settled should be
given up to the arguments or authority of a stranger or adversary?
especially if there be any suspicion of interest or design, as there
never fails to be where men find themselves ill-treated. We should do
well to commiserate our mutual ignorance, and endeavour to remove it in
all the gentle and fair ways of information, and not instantly treat
others ill as obstinate and perverse because they will not renounce
their own and receive our opinions, or at least those we would force
upon them, when it is more than probable that we are no less obstinate
in not embracing some of theirs. For where is the man that has
uncontestable evidence of the truth of all that he holds, or of the
falsehood of all he condemns; or can say, that he has examined to the
bottom all his own or other men’s opinions? The necessity of believing
without knowledge, nay often upon very slight grounds, in this fleeting
state of action and blindness we are in, should make us more busy and
careful to inform ourselves than to restrain others…. There is reason to
think, that if men were better instructed themselves, they would be less
imposing on others.’1</p>
<p>I have dealt hitherto only with the latest chapters of the Essay,
where Locke is drawing the moral from his earlier theoretical
investigation of the nature and limitations of human knowledge. It is
time now to examine what he has to say on this more purely philosophical
subject.</p>
<p>Locke is, as a rule, contemptuous of metaphysics. Apropos of some
speculation of Leibniz’s, he writes to a friend: ‘You and I have had
enough of this kind of fiddling.’ The conception of substance, which was
dominant in the metaphysics of his time, he considers vague and not
useful, but he does not venture to reject it wholly. He allows the
validity of metaphysical arguments for the existence of God, but he does
not dwell on them, and seems somewhat uncomfortable about them. Whenever
he is expressing new ideas, and</p>
<p>not merely repeating what is traditional, he thinks in terms of
concrete detail rather than of large abstractions. His philosophy is
piecemeal, like scientific work, not statuesque and all of a piece, like
the great Continental systems of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Locke may be regarded as the founder of empiricism, which is the
doctrine that all our knowledge (with the possible exception of logic
and mathematics) is derived from experience. Accordingly the first book
of the Essay is concerned in arguing, as against Plato, Descartes, and
the scholastics, that there are no innate ideas or principles. In the
second book he sets to work to show, in detail, how experience gives
rise to various kinds of ideas. Having rejected innate ideas, he
says:</p>
<p>‘Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of
all characters, without any ideas; how comes it to be furnished? Whence
comes it by that vast store, which the busy and boundless fancy of man
has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the
materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer in one word, from
experience: in that all our knowledge is founded, and from that it
ultimately derives itself’ (Book II, chap. i, sec. 2).</p>
<p>Our ideas are derived from two sources, (a) sensation, and (b)
perception of the operation of our own mind, which may be called
‘internal sense’. Since we can only think by means of ideas, and since
all ideas come from experience, it is evident that none of our knowledge
can antedate experience.</p>
<p>Perception, he says, is ‘the first step and degree towards knowledge,
and the inlet of all the materials of it’. This may seem, to a modern,
almost a truism, since it has become part of educated commonsense, at
least in English-speaking countries. But in his day the mind was
supposed to know all sorts of things a priori, and the complete
dependence of knowledge upon perception, which he proclaimed, was a new
and revolutionary doctrine. Plato, in the Theaetetus, had set to work to
refute the identification of knowledge with perception, and from his
time onwards almost all philosophers, down to and including Descartes
and Leibniz, had taught that much of our most valuable knowledge is not
derived from experience. Locke’s thoroughgoing empiricism was therefore
a bold innovation.</p>
<p>The third book of the Essay deals with words, and is concerned, in
the main, to show that what metaphysicians present as knowledge about
the world is purely verbal. Chapter III, ‘Of General Terms’, takes up an
extreme nominalist position on the subject of universals. All things
that exist are particulars, but we can frame general ideas, such as
‘man’, that are applicable to many particulars, and to these general
ideas we can give names. Their generality consists solely in the fact
that they are, or may be, applicable to a variety of particular things;
in their own being, as ideas in our minds, they are just as particular
as everything else that exists.</p>
<p>Chapter VI of Book III, ‘Of the Names of Substances’, is concerned to
refute the scholastic doctrine of essence. Things may have a real
essence, which will consist of their physical constitution but this is
in the main unknown to us, and is not the ‘essence’ of which scholastics
speak. Essence, as we can know it, is purely verbal; it consists merely
in the definition of a general term. To argue, for instance, as to
whether the essence of body is only extension, or is extension plus
solidity, is to argue about words: we may define the word ‘body’ either
way, and no harm can result so long as we adhere to our definition.
Distinct species are not a fact of nature, but of language; they are
‘distinct complex ideas with distinct names annexed to them’. There are,
it is true, differing things in nature, but the differences proceed by
continuous gradations: ‘the boundaries of the species, whereby men sort
them, are made by men’. He proceeds to give instances of monstrosities,
concerning which it was doubtful whether they were men or not. This
point of view was not generally accepted until Darwin persuaded men to
adopt the theory of evolution by gradual changes. Only those who have
allowed themselves to be afflicted by the scholastics will realize how
much metaphysical lumber it sweeps away.</p>
<p>Empiricism and idealism alike are faced with a problem to which, so
far, philosophy has found no satisfactory solution. This is the problem
of showing how we have knowledge of other things than ourself and the
operations of our own mind. Locke considers this problem, but what he
says is very obviously unsatisfactory. In one place2 we are told: ‘Since
the mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath no other immediate
object but its own ideas, which it alone does or can contemplate, it is
evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them.’ And again:
‘Knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two
ideas.’ From this it would seem to follow immediately that we cannot
know of the existence of other people, or of the physical world, for
these, if they exist, are not merely ideas in my mind. Each one of us,
accordingly, must, so far as knowledge is concerned, be shut up in
himself, and cut off from all contact with the outer world.</p>
<p>This, however, is a paradox, and Locke will have nothing to do with
paradoxes. Accordingly, in another chapter, he sets forth a different
theory, quite inconsistent with the earlier one. We have, he tells us,
three kinds of knowledge of real existence. Our knowledge of our own
existence is intuitive, our knowledge of God’s existence is
demonstrative, and our knowledge of things present to sense is sensitive
(Book IV, chap. iii).</p>
<p>In the next chapter, he becomes more or less aware of the
inconsistency. He suggests that someone might say: ‘If knowledge
consists in agreement of ideas, the enthusiast and the sober man are on
a level.’ He replies: ’Not so</p>
<p>where ideas agree with things.’ He proceeds to argue that all simple
ideas must agree with things, since ‘the mind, as has been showed, can
by no means make to itself’ any simple ideas, these being all ‘the
product of things operating on the mind in a natural way’. And as
regards complex ideas of substances, ‘all our complex ideas of them must
be such, and such only, as are made up of such simple ones as have been
discovered to coexist in nature’. Again, we can have no knowledge except
(1) by intuition, (2) by reason, examining the agreement or disagreement
of two ideas, (3) ‘by sensation, perceiving the existence of particular
things’ (Book IV, chap. iii, sec. 2). In all this, Locke assumes it
known that certain mental occurrences, which he calls sensations, have
causes outside themselves, and that these causes, at least to some
extent and in certain respects, resemble the sensations which are their
effects. But how, consistently with the principles of empiricism, is
this to be known? We experience the sensations, but not their causes;
our experience will be exactly the same if our sensations arise
spontaneously. The belief that sensations have causes, and still more
the belief that they resemble their causes, is one which, if maintained,
must be maintained on grounds wholly independent of experience. The view
that ‘knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of
two ideas’ is the one that Locke is entitled to, and his escape from the
paradoxes that it entails is effected by means of an inconsistency so
gross that only his resolute adherence to common sense could have made
him blind to it.</p>
<p>This difficulty has troubled empiricism down to the present day. Hume
got rid of it by dropping the assumption that sensations have external
causes, but even he retained this assumption whenever he forgot his own
principles, which was very often. His fundamental maxim, ‘no idea
without an antecedent impression’, which he takes over from Locke, is
only plausible so long as we think of impressions as having outside
causes, which the very word ‘impression’ irresistibly suggests. And at
the moments when Hume achieves some degree of consistency he is wildly
paradoxical.</p>
<p>No one has yet succeeded in inventing a philosophy at once credible
and self-consistent. Locke aimed at credibility, and achieved it at the
expense of consistency. Most of the great philosophers have done the
opposite. A philosophy which is not self-consistent cannot be wholly
true, but a philosophy which is self-consistent can very well be wholly
false. The most fruitful philosophies have contained glaring
inconsistencies, but for that very reason have been partially true.
There is no reason to suppose that a self-consistent system contains
more truth than one which, like Locke’s, is obviously more or less
wrong.</p>
<p>Locke’s ethical doctrines are interesting, partly on their own
account, partly as an anticipation of Bentham. When I speak of his
ethical doctrines, I do not mean his moral disposition as a practical
man, but his general theories as to how men act and how they should act.
Like Bentham, Locke was a man filled with kindly feeling, who yet held
that everybody (including himself) must always be moved, in action,
solely by desire for his own happiness or pleasure. A few quotations
will make this clear.</p>
<p>‘Things are good or evil only in relation to pleasure or pain. That
we call “good“ which is apt to cause or increase pleasure, or diminish
pain, in us.’</p>
<p>‘What is it moves desire? I answer, happiness, and that alone.’</p>
<p>‘Happiness, in its full extent, is the utmost pleasure we are capable
of.’</p>
<p>‘The necessity of pursuing true happiness [is] the foundation of all
liberty.’</p>
<p>‘The preference of vice to virtue [is] a manifest wrong
judgment.’</p>
<p>’The government of our passions [is] the right improvement of
liberty.’3</p>
<p>The last of these statements depends, it would seem, upon the
doctrine of rewards and punishments in the next world. God has laid down
certain moral rules; those who follow them go to heaven, and those who
break them risk going to hell. The prudent pleasure-seeker will
therefore be virtuous. With the decay of the belief that sin leads to
hell, it has become more difficult to make a purely self-regarding
argument in favour of a virtuous life. Bentham, who was a free-thinker,
substituted the human lawgiver in place of God: it was the business of
laws and social institutions to make a harmony between public and
private interests, so that each man, in pursuing his own happiness,
should be compelled to minister to the general happiness. But this is
less satisfactory than the reconciliation of public and private
interests effected by means of heaven and hell, both because lawgivers
are not always wise or virtuous, and because human governments are not
omniscient.</p>
<p>Locke has to admit, what is obvious, that men do not always act in
the way which, on a rational calculation, is likely to secure them a
maximum of pleasure. We value present pleasure more than future
pleasure, and pleasure in the near future more than pleasure in the
distant future. It may be said—this is not said by Locke—that the rate
of interest is a quantitative measure of the general discounting of
future pleasures. If the prospect of spending £1,000 a year hence were
as delightful as the thought of spending it to-day, I should not need to
be paid for postponing my pleasure. Locke admits that devout believers
often commit sins which, by their own creed, put them in danger of hell.
We all know people who put off going to the dentist longer than they
would if they were engaged in the rational pursuit of pleasure. Thus,
even if pleasure or the avoidance of pain be our motive, it must be
added that pleasures lose their attractiveness and pains their terrors
in proportion to their distance in the future.</p>
<p>Since it is only in the long run that, according to Locke,
self-interest and the general interest coincide, it becomes important
that men should be guided, as far as possible, by their long-run
interests. That is to say, men should be prudent. Prudence is the one
virtue which remains to be preached, for every lapse from virtue is a
failure of prudence. Emphasis on prudence is characteristic of
liberalism. It is connected with the rise of capitalism, for the prudent
became rich while the imprudent became or remained poor. It is connected
also with certain forms of Protestant piety: virtue with a view to
heaven is psychologically very analogous to saving with a view to
investment.</p>
<p>Belief in the harmony between private and public interests is
characteristic of liberalism, and long survived the theological
foundation that it had in Locke.</p>
<p>Locke states that liberty depends upon the necessity of pursuing true
happiness and upon the government of our passions. This opinion he
derives from his doctrine that private and public interests are
identical in the long run, though not necessarily over short periods. It
follows from this doctrine that, given a community of citizens who are
all both pious and prudent, they will all act, given liberty, in a
manner to promote the general good. There will be no need of human laws
to restrain them, since divine laws will suffice. The hitherto virtuous
man who is tempted to become a highwayman will say to himself: ‘I might
escape the human magistrate, but I could not escape punishment at the
hands of the Divine Magistrate.’ He will accordingly renounce his
nefarious schemes, and live as virtuously as if he were sure of being
caught by the police. Legal liberty, therefore, is only completely
possible where both prudence and piety are universal; elsewhere, the
restraints imposed by the criminal law are indispensable.</p>
<p>Locke states repeatedly that morality is capable of demonstration,
but he does not develop this idea so fully as could be wished. The most
important passage is:</p>
<p>“Morality capable of demonstration. The idea of a Supreme Being,
infinite in power, goodness, and wisdom, whose workmanship we are, and
on whom we depend; and the idea of ourselves, as understanding, rational
beings, being such as are clear in us, would, I suppose, if duly
considered and pursued, afford such foundations of our duty and rules of
action as might place morality among the sciences capable of
demonstration: wherein I doubt not, but from self-evident propositions,
by necessary consequences, as incontestable as those in mathematics, the
measures of right and wrong might be made out, to any one that will
apply himself with the same indifferency and attention to the one as he
does to the other of these sciences. The relation of other modes may
certainly be perceived, as well as those of number and extension: and I
cannot see why they should not also be capable of demonstration, if due
methods were thought on to examine or pursue their agreement or
disagreement. “Where there is no property, there is no justice“, is a
proposition as certain as any demonstration in Euclid: for the idea of
property being a right to anything, and the idea to which the name
“injustice“ is given being the invasion or violation of that right, it
is evident that these ideas being thus established, and these names
annexed to them, I can as certainly know this proposition to be true as
that a triangle has three angles equal to two right ones. Again: “No
government allows absolute liberty“: the idea of government being the
establishment of society upon certain rules or laws, which require
conformity to them; and the idea of absolute liberty being for any one
to do whatever he pleases: I am as capable of being certain of the truth
of this proposition as of any in the mathematics.’4“</p>
<p>This passage is puzzling because, at first, it seems to make moral
rules dependent upon God’s decrees, while in the instances that are
given it is suggested that moral rules are analytic. I suppose that, in
fact, Locke thought some parts of ethics analytic and others dependent
upon God’s decrees. Another puzzle is that the instances given do not
seem to be ethical propositions at all.</p>
<p>There is another difficulty which one could wish to see considered.
It is generally held by theologians that God’s decrees are not
arbitrary, but are inspired by His goodness and wisdom. This requires
that there should be some concept of goodness antecedent to God’s
decrees, which has led Him to make just those decrees rather than any
others. What this concept may be, it is impossible to discover from
Locke. What he says is that a prudent man will act in such and such
ways, since otherwise God will punish him; but he leaves us completely
in the dark as to why punishment should be attached to certain acts
rather than to their opposites.</p>
<p>Locke’s ethical doctrines are, of course, not defensible. Apart from
the fact that there is something revolting in a system which regards
prudence as the only virtue, there are other, less emotional, objections
to his theories.</p>
<p>In the first place, to say that men only desire pleasure is to put
the cart before the horse. Whatever I may happen to desire, I shall feel
pleasure in obtaining it; but as a rule the pleasure is due to the
desire, not the desire to the pleasure. It is possible, as happens with
masochists, to desire pain; in that case, there is still pleasure in the
gratification of the desire, but it is mixed with its opposite. Even in
Locke’s own doctrine, it is not pleasure as such that is desired, since
a proximate pleasure is more desired than a remote one. If morality is
to be deduced from the psychology of desire, as Locke and his disciples
attempt to do, there can be no reason for deprecating the discounting of
distant pleasures, or for urging prudence as a moral duty. His argument,
in a nutshell, is: ’We only desire pleasure. But, in fact, many men
desire,</p>
<p>not pleasure as such, but proximate pleasure. This contradicts our
doctrine that they desire pleasure as such, and is therefore wicked.’
Almost all philosophers, in their ethical systems, first lay down a
false doctrine, and then argue that wickedness consists in acting in a
manner that proves it false, which would be impossible if the doctrine
were true. Of this pattern Locke affords an example.</p>
