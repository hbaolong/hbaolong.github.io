<h4 id="the-thirteenth-century">12 THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY</h4>
<p>In the thirteenth century the Middle Ages reached a culmination. The
synthesis which had been gradually built up since the fall of Rome
became as complete as it was capable of being. The fourteenth century
brought a dissolution of institutions and philosophies, the fifteenth
brought the beginning of those that we still regard as modern. The great
men of the thirteenth century were very great: Innocent III, St Francis,
Frederick II, and Thomas Aquinas are, in their different ways, supreme
representatives of their respective types. There were also great
achievements not so definitely associated with great names: the Gothic
cathedrals of France, the romantic literature of Charlemagne, Arthur,
and the Niebelungen, the beginnings of constitutional government in
Magna Carta and the House of Commons. The matter that concerns us most
directly is the scholastic philosophy, especially as set forth by
Aquinas; but I shall leave this for the next chapter, and attempt,
first, to give an outline of the events that did most to form the mental
atmosphere of the age.</p>
<p>The central figure at the beginning of the century is Pope Innocent
III (1198–1216), a shrewd politician, a man of infinite vigour, a firm
believer in the most extreme claims of the papacy, but not endowed with
Christian humility. At his consecration, he preached from the text:
‘See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms,
to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and
to plant.’ He called himself ‘king of kings, lord of lords, a priest for
ever and ever according to the order of Melchizedek’. In enforcing this
view of himself, he took advantage of ever favourable circumstance. In
Sicily, which had been conquered by the Emperor Henry VI (d. 1197), who
had married Constance, heiress of the Norman kings, the new king was
Frederick, only three years old at the time of Innocent’s accession. The
kingdom was turbulent, and Constance needed the Pope’s help. She made
him guardian of the infant Frederick, and secured his recognition of her
son’s rights in Sicily by acknowledging papal superiority. Portugal and
Aragon made similar acknowledgments. In England, King John, after
vehement resistance, was compelled to yield his kingdom to Innocent and
receive it back as a papal fief.</p>
<p>To some degree, the Venetians got the better of him in the matter of
the fourth Crusade. The soldiers of the Cross were to embark at Venice,
but there were difficulties in procuring enough ships. No one had enough
except the Venetians, and they maintained (for purely commercial
reasons) that it would be much better to conquer Constantinople than
Jerusalem—in any case, it would be a useful stepping-stone, and the
Eastern Empire had never been very friendly to Crusaders. It was found
necessary to give way to Venice; Constantinople was captured, and a
Latin Emperor established. At first Innocent was annoyed; but he
reflected that it might now be possible to re-unite the Eastern and
Western Churches. (This hope proved vain.) Except in this instance, I do
not know of anybody who ever in any degree got the better of</p>
<p>Innocent III. He ordered the great Crusade against the Albigenses,
which rooted out heresy, happiness, prosperity, and culture from
southern France. He deposed Raymond, Count of Toulouse, for lukewarmness
about the Crusade, and secured most of the region of the Albigenses for
its leader, Simon de Montfort, father of the father of Parliament. He
quarrelled with the Emperor Otto, and called upon the Germans to depose
him. They did so, and at his suggestion elected Frederick II, now just
of age, in his stead. But for his support of Frederick he exacted a
terrific price in promises—which, however, Frederick was determined to
break as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Innocent III was the first great Pope in whom there was no element of
sanctity. The reform of the Church made the hierarchy feel secure as to
its moral prestige, and therefore convinced that it need no longer
trouble to be holy. The power motive, from his time on, more and more
exclusively dominated the papacy, and produced opposition from some
religious men even in his day. He codified the canon law so as to
increase the power of the Curia; Walther von der Vogelweide called this
code ‘the blackest book that hell ever gave’. Although the papacy still
had resounding victories to win, the manner of its subsequent decline
might already have been foreseen. Frederick II, who had been the ward of
Innocent III, went to Germany in 1212, and by the Pope’s help was
elected to replace Otto. Innocent did not live to see what a formidable
antagonist he had raised up against the papacy.</p>
<p>Frederick—one of the most remarkable rulers known to history—had
passed his childhood and youth in difficult and adverse circumstances.
His father Henry VI (son of Barbarossa) had defeated the Normans of
Sicily, and married Constance, heiress to the kingdom. He established a
German gar rison, which was hated by the Sicilians; but he died in 1197,
when Frederick was two years old. Constance thereupon turned against the
Germans, and tried to govern without them by the help of the Pope. The
Germans were resentful, and Otto tried to conquer Sicily; this was the
cause of his quarrel with the Pope. Palermo, where Frederick passed his
childhood, was subject to other troubles. There were Muslim revolts; the
Pisans and Genoese fought each other and everyone else for possession of
the island; the important people in Sicily were constantly changing
sides, according as one party or the other offered the higher price for
treachery. Culturally, however, Sicily had great advantages. Muslim,
Byzantine, Italian, and German civilization met and mingled there as
nowhere else. Greek and Arabic were still living languages in Sicily.
Frederick learnt to speak six languages fluently, and in all six he was
witty. He was at home in Arabian philosophy, and had friendly relations
with Mohammedans, which scandalized pious Christians. He was a
Hohenstaufen, and in Germany could count as a German. But in culture and
sentiment he was Italian, with a tincture of Byzantine and Arab. His
contemporaries gazed upon him with astonishment gradually turning into
horror; they called him ‘wonder of the world and marvellous innovator’.
While still alive, he was the subject of myths. He was said to be the
author of a book De Tribus Impostoribus—the three impostors were Moses,
Christ, and Mohammed. This book, which never existed, was attributed,
successively, to many enemies of the Church, the last of whom was
Spinoza.</p>
<p>The words ‘Guelf’ and ‘Ghibelline’ began to be used at the time of
Frederick’s contest with the Emperor Otto. They are corruptions of
‘Welf’ and ‘Waiblingen’, the family names of the two contestants.
(Otto’s nephew was an ancestor of the British royal family.)</p>
<p>Innocent III died in 1216; Otto, whom Frederick had defeated died in
1218. The new Pope, Honorius III, was at first on good terms with
Frederick, but difficulties soon arose. First, Frederick refused to go
on crusade; then he had trouble with the Lombard cities, which in 1226
contracted an offensive and defensive alliance for twenty-five years.
They hated the Germans; one of their poets wrote fiery verses against
them. ‘Love not the folk of Germany; far, far from you be these mad
dogs.’ This seems to have expressed the general feeling in Lombardy.
Frederick wanted to remain in Italy to deal with the cities, but in 1227
Honorius died, and was succeeded by Gregory IX, a fiery ascetic who
loved St Francis and was beloved by him. (He canonized St Francis two
years after his death.) Gregory thought nothing else so important as the
Crusade, and excommunicated Frederick for not undertaking it. Frederick,
who had married the daughter and heiress of the King of Jerusalem, was
willing enough to go when he could, and called himself King of
Jerusalem. In 1228, while still excommunicate, he went; this made
Gregory even more angry than his previously not going, for how could the
crusading . host be led by a man whom the Pope had banned? Arrived in
Palestine, Frederick made friends with the Mohammedans, explained to
them that the Christians attached importance to Jerusalem although it
was of little strategic value, and succeeded in inducing them peaceably
to restore the city to him. This made the Pope still more furious—one
should fight the infidel, not negotiate with him. However, Frederick was
duly crowned in Jerusalem, and no one could deny that he had been
successful. Peace between Pope and Emperor was restored in 1230.</p>
<p>During the few years of peace that followed, the Emperor devoted
himself to the affairs of the kingdom of Sicily. By the help of his
prime minister, Pietro della Vigna, he promulgated a new legal code,
derived from Roman law, and showing a high level of civilization in his
southern dominion; the code was at once translated into Greek, for the
benefit of the Greek-speaking inhabitants. He founded an important
university at Naples. He minted gold coins, called ‘augustals’, the
first gold coins in the West for many centuries. He established freer
trade, and abolished all internal customs. He even summoned elected
representatives of the cities to his council, which, however, had only
consultative powers.</p>
<p>This period of peace ended when Frederick again came into conflict
with the Lombard League in 1237; the Pope threw in his lot with them,
and again excommunicated the Emperor. From this time until Frederick’s
death in 1250, the war was practically continuous, growing, on both
sides, gradually more bitter, cruel and treacherous. There were great
fluctuations of fortune, and the issue was still undecided when the
Emperor died. But those who attempted to be his successors had not his
power, and were gradually defeated, leaving Italy divided and the Pope
victorious.</p>
<p>Deaths of popes made little difference in the struggle; each new Pope
took up his predecessor’s policy practically unchanged. Gregory IX died
in 1241; in 1243 Innocent IV, a bitter enemy of Frederick, was elected.
Louis IX, in spite of his impeccable orthodoxy, tried to moderate the
fury of Gregory and Innocent IV, but in vain. Innocent, especially,
rejected all overtures from the Emperor, and used all manner of
unscrupulous expedients against him. He pronounced him deposed, declared
a crusade against him, and excommunicated all who supported him. The
friars preached against him, the Muslims rose, there were plots among
his prominent nominal supporters. All this made Frederick increasingly
cruel; plotters were ferociously punished, and prisoners were deprived
of the right eye and the right hand.</p>
<p>At one time during this titanic struggle, Frederick thought of
founding a new religion, in which he was to be the Messiah, and his
minister Pietro della Vigna was to take the place of St Peter.1 He did
not get so far as to make this</p>
<p>project public, but wrote about it to della Vigna. Suddenly, however,
he became convinced, rightly or wrongly, that Pietro was plotting
against him; he blinded him, and exhibited him publicly in a cage;
Pietro, however, avoided further suffering by suicide.</p>
<p>Frederick, in spite of his abilities, could not have succeeded,
because the antipapal forces that existed in his time were pious and
democratic, whereas his aim was something like a restoration of the
pagan Roman Empire. In culture he was enlightened, but politically he
was retrograde. His court was oriental; he had a harem with eunuchs. But
it was in this court that Italian poetry began; he himself had some
merit as a poet. In his conflict with the papacy, he published
controversial statements as to the dangers of ecclesiastical absolutism,
which would have been applauded in the sixteenth century, but fell flat
in his own day. The heretics, who should have been his allies, appeared
to him simply rebels, and to please the Pope he persecuted them. The
free cities, but for the Emperor, might have opposed the Pope; but so
long as Frederick demanded their submission they welcomed the Pope as an
ally. Thus, although he was free from the superstitions of his age, and
in culture far above other contemporary rulers, his position as Emperor
compelled him to oppose all that was politically liberal. He failed
inevitably, but of all the failures in history he remains one of the
most interesting.</p>
<p>The heretics, against whom Innocent III crusaded, and whom all rulers
(including Frederick) persecuted, deserve study, both in themselves and
as giving a glimpse of popular feeling, of which, otherwise, hardly a
hint appears in the writings of the time.</p>
<p>The most interesting, and also the largest, of the heretical sects
were the Cathari, who, in the South of France, are better known as
Albigenses. Their doctrines came from Asia by way of the Balkans; they
were widely held in Northern Italy, and in the South of France they were
held by the great majority, including nobles, who liked the excuse to
seize Church lands. The cause of this wide diffusion of heresy was
partly disappointment at the failure of the Crusades, but mainly moral
disgust at the wealth and wickedness of the clergy. There was a
widespread feeling, analogous to later puritanism, in favour of personal
holiness; this was associated with a cult of poverty. The Church was
rich and largely worldly; very many priests were grossly immoral. The
friars brought accusations against the older orders and the parish
priests, asserting abuse of the confessional for purposes of seduction;
and the enemies of the friars retorted the accusation. There can be no
doubt that such charges were largely justified. The more the Church
claimed supremacy on religious grounds, the more plain people were
shocked by the contrast between profession and performance. The same
motives which ultimately led to the Reformation were operative in the
thirteenth century. The main difference was that secular rulers were not
ready to throw in their lot with the heretics; and this was largely
because no existing philosophy could reconcile heresy with the claims of
kings to dominion.</p>
<p>The tenets of the Cathari cannot be known with certainty, as we are
entirely dependent on the testimony of their enemies. Moreover
ecclesiastics, being well versed in the history of heresy, tended to
apply some familiar label, and to attribute to existing sects all the
tenets of former ones, often on the basis of some not very close
resemblance. Nevertheless, there is a good deal that is almost beyond
question. It seems that the Cathari were dualists and that, like the
Gnostics, they considered the Old Testament Jehovah a wicked demiurge,
the true God being only revealed in the New Testament. They regarded
matter as essentially evil, and believed that for the virtuous there is
no resurrection of the body. The wicked, however, will suffer
transmigration into the bodies of animals. On this ground they were
vegetarians, abstaining even from eggs, cheese, and milk. They ate fish,
however, because they believed that fishes are not sexually generated.
All sex was abhorrent to them; marriage, some said, is even worse than
adultery, because it is continuous and complacent. On the other hand,
they saw no objection to suicide. They accepted the New Testament more
literally than did the orthodox; they abstained from oaths, and turned
the other cheek. The persecutors record a case of a man accused of
heresy, who defended himself by saying that he ate meat, lied, swore,
and was a good Catholic.</p>
<p>The stricter precepts of the sect were only to be observed by certain
exceptionally holy people called the ‘perfected’; the others might eat
meat and even marry.</p>
<p>It is interesting to trace the genealogy of these doctrines. They
came to Italy and France, by way of the Crusaders, from a sect called
the Bogomiles in Bulgaria; in 1167, when the Cathari held a council near
Toulouse, Bulgarian delegates attended. The Bogomiles, in turn, were the
result of a fusion of Manichæans and Paulicians. The Paulicians were an
Armenian sect who rejected infant baptism, purgatory, the invocation of
saints, and the Trinity; they spread gradually into Thrace, and thence
into Bulgaria. The Paulicians were followers of Marcion (ca. A.D. 150),
who considered himself to be following St Paul in rejecting the Jewish
elements in Christianity, and who had some affinity with the Gnostics
without being one of them.</p>
<p>The only other popular heresy that I shall consider is that of the
Waldenses. These were the followers of Peter Waldo, an enthusiast who,
in 1170, started a ‘crusade’ for observance of the law of Christ. He
gave all his goods to the poor, and founded a society called the ‘Poor
men of Lyons’, who practised poverty and a strictly virtuous life. At
first they had papal approval, but they inveighed somewhat too forcibly
against the immorality of the clergy, and were condemned by the Council
of Verona in 1184. Thereupon they decided that every good man is
competent to preach and expound the Scriptures; they appointed their own
ministers, and dispensed with the services of the Catholic priesthood.
They spread to Lombardy, and to Bohemia, where they paved the way for
the Hussites. In the Albigensian persecution, which affected them also,
many fled to Piedmont; it was their persecution in Piedmont in Milton’s
time that occasioned his sonnet ‘Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered
saints.’ They survive to this day in remote Alpine valleys and in the
United States.</p>
<p>All this heresy alarmed the Church, and vigorous measures were taken
to suppress it. Innocent III considered that heretics deserved death,
being guilty of treason to Christ. He called upon the king of France to
embark upon a crusade against the Albigenses, which was done in 1209. It
was conducted with incredible ferocity; after the taking of Carcassonne,
especially, there was an appalling massacre. The ferreting out of heresy
had been the business of the bishops, but it became too onerous to be
performed by men who had other duties, and in 1233 Gregory IX founded
the Inquisition, to take over this part of the work of the episcopate.
After 1254, those accused by the Inquisition were not allowed counsel.
If condemned, their property was confiscated—in France, to the crown.
When an accused person was found guilty, he was handed over to the
secular arm with a prayer that his life might be spared; but if the
secular authorities failed to burn him, they were liable to be
themselves brought before the Inquisition. It dealt not only with heresy
in the ordinary sense, but with sorcery and witchcraft. In Spain, it was
chiefly directed against the crypto-Jews. Its work was performed mainly
by Dominicans and Franciscans. It never penetrated to Scandinavia or
England, but the English were quite ready to make use of it against Joan
of Arc. On the whole, it was very successful; at the outset, it
completely stamped out the Albigensian heresy.</p>
<p>The Church, in the early thirteenth century, was in danger of a
revolt scarcely less formidable than that of the sixteenth. From this it
was saved, very largely, by the rise of the mendicant orders; St Francis
and St Dominic did much more for orthodoxy than was done by even the
most vigorous popes.</p>
<p>St Francis of Assisi (1181 or 1182–1226) was one of the most lovable
men known to history. He was of a well-to-do family, and in his youth
was not averse from ordinary gaieties. But one day, as he was riding by
a leper, a sudden impulse of pity led him to dismount and kiss the man.
Soon afterwards, he decided to forgo all worldly goods, and devote his
life to preaching and good works. His father, a respectable business
man, was furious, but could not deter him. He soon gathered a band of
followers, all vowed to complete poverty. At first, the Church viewed
the movement with some suspicion; it seemed too like the ‘Poor Men of
Lyons’. The first missionaries whom St Francis sent to distant places
were taken for heretics, because they practised poverty instead of (like
the monks) only taking a vow which no one regarded as serious. But
Innocent III was shrewd enough to see the value of the movement, if it
could be kept within the bounds of orthodoxy, and in 1209 or 1210 he
gave recognition to the new order. Gregory IX, who was a personal friend
of St Francis, continued to favour him, while imposing certain rules
which were irksome to the Saint’s enthusiastic and anarchic impulses.
Francis wished to interpret the vow of poverty in the strictest possible
way; he objected to houses or churches for his followers. They were to
beg their bread, and to have no lodging but what chance hospitality
provided. In 1219, he travelled to the East and preached before the
Sultan, who received him courteously but remained a Mohammedan. On his
return, he found that the Franciscans had built themselves a house; he
was deeply pained, but the Pope induced or compelled him to give way.
After his death, Gregory canonized him but softened his rule in the
article of poverty.</p>
<p>In the matter of saintliness, Francis has had equals; what makes him
unique among saints is his spontaneous happiness, his universal love,
and his gifts as a poet. His goodness appears always devoid of effort,
as though it had no dross to overcome. He loved all living things, not
only as a Christian or a benevolent man, but as a poet. His hymn to the
sun, written shortly before his death, might almost have been written by
Ikhnaton the sun-worshipper, but not quite—Christianity informs it,
though not very obviously. He felt a duty to lepers, for their sake, not
for his; unlike most Christian saints, he was more interested in the
happiness of others than in his own salvation. He never showed any
feeling of superiority, even to the humblest or most wicked. Thomas of
Celano said of him that he was more than a saint among saints; among
sinners he was one of themselves.</p>
<p>If Satan existed, the future of the order founded by St Francis would
afford him the most exquisite gratification. The saint’s immediate
successor as head of the order, Brother Elias, wallowed in luxury, and
allowed a complete abandonment of poverty. The chief work of the
Franciscans in the years immediately following the death of their
founder was as recruiting sergeants in the bitter and bloody wars of
Guelfs and Ghibellines. The Inquisition, founded seven years after his
death, was, in several countries, chiefly conducted by Franciscans. A
small minority, called the Spirituals, remained true to his teaching;
many of these were burnt by the Inquisition for heresy. These men held
that Christ and the Apostles owned no property, not even the clothes
they wore; this opinion was condemned as heretical in 1323 by John XXII.
The net result of St Francis’s life was to create yet one more wealthy
and corrupt order, to strengthen the hierarchy, and to facilitate the
persecution of all who excelled in moral earnestness or freedom of
thought. In view of his own aims and character, it is impossible to
imagine any more bitterly ironical outcome.</p>
<p>St Dominic (1170–1221) is much less interesting than St Francis. He
was a Castilian, and had, like Loyola, a fanatical devotion to
orthodoxy. His main purpose was to combat heresy, and he adopted poverty
as a means to this end. He was present throughout the Albigensian war,
though he is said to have deplored some of its more extreme atrocities.
The Dominican Order was founded in 1215 by Innocent III, and won quick
success. The only human trait known to me in St Dominic is his
confession to Jordan of Saxony that he liked talking to young women
better than to old ones. In 1242, the Order solemnly decreed that this
passage should be deleted from Jordan’s life of the founder.</p>
<p>The Dominicans were even more active than the Franciscans in the work
of the Inquisition. They performed, however, a valuable service to
mankind by their devotion to learning. This was no part of St Dominic’s
intention; he had decreed that his friars were ‘not to learn secular
sciences or liberal arts except by dispensation’. This rule was
abrogated in 1259, after which date everything was done to make a
studious life easy for Dominicans. Manual labour was no part of their
duties, and the hours of devotion were shortened to give them more time
for study. They devoted themselves to reconciling Aristotle and Christ;
Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, both Dominicans, accomplished this
task as well as it is capable of being accomplished. The authority of
Thomas Aquinas was so overwhelming that subsequent Dominicans did not
achieve much in philosophy; though Francis, even more than Dominic, had
disliked learning, the greatest names in the immediately following
period are Franciscan: Roger Bacon, Duns Scotus, and William of Occam
were all Franciscans. What the friars accomplished for philosophy will
be the subject of the following chapters.</p>
