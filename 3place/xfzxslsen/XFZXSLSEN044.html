<h4 id="the-twelfth-century">11 THE TWELFTH CENTURY</h4>
<p>Four aspects of the twelfth century are especially interesting to
us:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The continued conflict of empire and papacy;</p></li>
<li><p>The rise of the Lombard cities;</p></li>
<li><p>The Crusades; and</p></li>
<li><p>The growth of scholasticism.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All these four continued into the following century. The Crusades
gradually came to an inglorious end; but, as regards the other three
movements, the thirteenth century marks the culmination of what, in the
twelfth, is in a transitional stage. In the thirteenth century, the Pope
definitely triumphed over the Emperor, the Lombard cities acquired
secure independence and scholasticism reached its highest point. All
this, however, was an outcome of what the twelfth century had
prepared.</p>
<p>Not only the first of these four movements, but the other three also,
are intimately bound up with the increase of papal and ecclesiastical
power. The Pope was in alliance with the Lombard cities against the
Emperor; Pope Urban II inaugurated the first Crusade, and subsequent
popes were the main promoters of the later ones; the scholastic
philosophers were all clerics, and Church councils took care to keep
them within the bounds of orthodoxy, or discipline them if they strayed.
Undoubtedly, their sense of the political triumph of the Church, in
which they felt themselves participants, stimulated their intellectual
initiative.</p>
<p>One of the curious things about the Middle Ages is that they were
original and creative without knowing it. All parties justified their
policies by antiquarian and archaistic arguments. The Emperor appealed,
in Germany, to the feudal principles of the time of Charlemagne; in
Italy, to Roman law and the power of ancient Emperors. The Lombard
cities went still further back, to the institutions of republican Rome.
The papal party based its claims partly on the forged Donation of
Constantine, partly on the relations of Saul and Samuel as told in the
Old Testament. The scholastics appealed either to the Scriptures or at
first to Plato and then to Aristotle; when they were original, they
tried to conceal the fact. The Crusades were an endeavour to restore the
state of affairs that had existed before the rise of Islam.</p>
<p>We must not be deceived by this literary archaism. Only in the case
of the Emperor did it correspond with the facts. Feudalism was in decay,
especially in Italy; the Roman Empire was a mere memory. Accordingly,
the Emperor was defeated. The cities of North Italy, while, in their
later development, they showed much similarity to the cities of ancient
Greece, repeated the pattern, not from imitation, but from similarity of
circumstances: that of small, rich, highly civilized republican
commercial communities surrounded by monarchies at a lower level of
culture. The scholastics, however they might revere Aristotle, showed
more originality than any of the Arabs—more, indeed, than any one since
Plotinus, or at any rate since Augustine. In politics as in thought,
there was the same distinguished originality.</p>
<p>CONFLICT OF EMPIRE AND PAPACY</p>
<p>From the time of Gregory VII to the middle of the thirteenth century,
European history centres round the struggle for power between the Church
and the lay monarchs—primarily the Emperor, but also, on occasion, the
kings of France and England. Gregory’s pontificate had ended in apparent
disaster, but his policies were resumed, though with more moderation, by
Urban II (1088–99), who repeated the decrees against lay investiture,
and desired episcopal elections to be made freely by clergy and people.
(The share of the people was, no doubt, to be purely formal.) In
practice, however, he did not quarrel with lay appointments if they were
good.</p>
<p>At first, Urban was safe only in Norman territory. But in 1093 Henry
IV’s son Conrad rebelled against his father, and, in alliance with the
Pope, conquered North Italy, where the Lombard League, an alliance of
cities with Milan at its head, favoured the Pope. In 1094, Urban made a
triumphal procession through North Italy and France. He triumphed over
Philip, King of France, who desired a divorce, and was therefore
excommunicated by the Pope, but submitted. At the Council of Clermont,
in 1095, Urban proclaimed the first Crusade, which produced a wave of
religious enthusiasm leading to increase of papal power—also to
atrocious pogroms of Jews. The last year of Urban’s life he spent in
safety in Rome, where popes were seldom safe.</p>
<p>The next Pope, Paschal II, like Urban, came from Cluny. He continued
the struggle on investitures, and was successful in France and England.
But after the death of Henry IV in 1106, the next Emperor, Henry V, got
the better of the Pope, who was an unworldly man and allowed his
saintliness to outweigh his political sense. The Pope proposed that the
Emperor should renounce investitures, but in return bishops and abbots
should renounce temporal possessions. The Emperor professed to agree;
but when the suggested compromise was made public, the ecclesiastics
rebelled furiously against the Pope. The Emperor, who was in Rome, took
the opportunity to seize the Pope, who yielded to threats, gave way on
investitures, and crowned Henry V. Eleven years later, however, by the
Concordat of Worms in 1122, Pope Calixtus II compelled Henry V to give
way on investitures, and to surrender control over episcopal elections
in Burgundy and Italy.</p>
<p>So far, the net result of the struggle was that the Pope, who had
been subject to Henry III, had become the equal of the Emperor. At the
same time, he had become more completely sovereign in the Church, which
he governed by means of legates. This increase of papal power had
diminished the relative importance of bishops. Papal elections were now
free from lay control, and ecclesiastics generally were more virtuous
than they had been before the reform movement.</p>
<p>RISE OF THE LOMBARD CITIES</p>
<p>The next stage was connected with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa
(1152–90), an able and energetic man, who would have succeeded in any
enterprise in which success was possible. He was a man of education, who
read Latin with pleasure, though he spoke it with difficulty. His
classical learning was considerable, and he was an admirer of Roman law.
He thought of himself as the heir of the Roman Emperors, and hoped to
acquire their power. But as a German he was unpopular in Italy. The
Lombard cities, while willing to acknowledge his formal overlordship,
objected when he interfered in their affairs—except those which feared
Milan, against which city some of them invoked his protection. The
Patarine movement in Milan continued, and was associated with a more or
less democratic tendency; most, but by no means all, of the North
Italian cities sympathized with Milan, and made common cause against the
Emperor.</p>
<p>Hadrian IV, a vigorous Englishman who had been a missionary in
Norway, became Pope two years after the accession of Barbarossa, and
was, at first, on good terms with him. They were reconciled by a common
enmity. The city of Rome claimed independence from both alike, and, as a
help in the struggle, had invited a saintly heretic, Arnold of Brescia.1
His heresy was very grave: he maintained that ‘clerks who have estates,
bishops who hold fiefs, monks who possess property, cannot be saved’. He
held this view because he thought that the clergy ought to devote
themselves entirely to spiritual matters. No one questioned his sincere
austerity, although he was accounted wicked on account of his heresy. St
Bernard, who vehemently opposed him, said, ‘He neither eats nor drinks,
but only, like the Devil, hungers and thirsts for the blood of souls.’
Hadrian’s predecessor in the papacy had written to Barbarossa to
complain that Arnold supported the popular faction, which wished to
elect one hundred senators and two consuls, and to have an Emperor of
their own. Frederick, who was setting out for Italy, was naturally
scandalized. The Roman demand for communal liberty, which was encouraged
by Arnold, led to a riot in which a cardinal was killed. The
newly-elected Pope Hadrian thereupon placed Rome under an interdict. It
was Holy Week, and superstition got the better of the Romans; they
submitted, and promised to banish Arnold. He hid, but was captured by
the Emperor’s troops. He was burnt, and his ashes were thrown into the
Tiber, for fear of their being preserved as holy relics. After a delay
caused by Frederick’s unwillingness to hold the Pope’s bridle and
stirrup while he dismounted, the Pope crowned the Emperor in 1155 amid
the resistance of the populace, which was quelled with great
slaughter.</p>
<p>The honest man being disposed of, the practical politicians were free
to resume their quarrel.</p>
<p>The Pope, having made peace with the Normans, ventured in 1157 to
break with the Emperor. For twenty years there was almost continuous war
between the Emperor on the one side, and the Pope with the Lombard
cities on the other. The Normans mostly supported the Pope. The bulk of
the fighting against the Emperor was done by the Lombard League, which
spoke of ‘liberty’ and was inspired by intense popular feeling. The
Emperor besieged various cities, and in 1162 even captured Milan, which
he razed to the ground, compelling its citizens to live elsewhere. But
five years later the League rebuilt Milan and the former inhabitants
returned. In this same year, the Emperor, duly provided with an
antipope,2 marched on Rome with a great army. The Pope fled, and his
cause seemed desperate, but pestilence destroyed Frederick’s army, and
he returned to Germany a solitary fugitive. Although not only Sicily,
but the Greek Emperor, now sided with the</p>
<p>Lombard League, Barbarossa made another attempt, ending in his defeat
at the battle of Legnano in 1176. After this he was compelled to make
peace, leaving to the cities all the substance of liberty. In the
conflict between Empire and papacy, however, the terms of peace gave
neither party complete victory.</p>
<p>Barbarossa’s end was seemly. In 1189 he went on the third Crusade,
and in the following year he died.</p>
<p>The rise of free cities is what proved of most ultimate importance in
this long strife. The power of the Emperor was associated with the
decaying feudal system; the power of the Pope, though still growing, was
largely dependent upon the world’s need of him as an antagonist to the
Emperor, and therefore decayed when the Empire ceased to be a menace;
but the power of the cities was new, a result of economic progress, and
a source of new political forms. Although this does not appear in the
twelfth century, the Italian cities, before long, developed a
non-clerical culture which reached the very highest levels in
literature, in art, and in science. All this was rendered possible by
their successful resistance to Barbarossa.</p>
<p>All the great cities of Northern Italy lived by trade, and in the
twelfth century the more settled conditions made traders more prosperous
than before. The maritime cities, Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, never had to
fight for their liberty, and were therefore less hostile to the Emperor
than the cities at the foot of the Alps, which were important to him as
the gateways to Italy. It is for this reason that Milan is the most
interesting and important of Italian cities at this time.</p>
<p>Until the time of Henry III, the Milanese had usually been content to
follow their archbishop. But the Patarine movement, mentioned in an
earlier chapter, changed this: the archbishop sided with the nobility,
while a powerful popular movement opposed him and them. Some beginnings
of democracy resulted, and a constitution arose under which the rulers
of the city were elected by the citizens. In various northern cities,
but especially in Bologna, there was a learned class of lay lawyers,
well versed in Roman law; moreover the rich laity, from the twelfth
century onwards, were much better educated than the feudal nobility
north of the Alps. Although they sided with the Pope against the
Emperor, the rich commercial cities were not ecclesiastical in their
outlook. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, many of them adopted
heresies of a Puritan sort, like the merchants of England and Holland
after the Reformation. Later, they tended to be free-thinkers, paying
lip-service to the Church, but destitute of all real piety. Dante is the
last of the old type, Boccaccio the first of the new.</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>The Crusades need not concern us as wars, but they have a certain
importance in relation to culture. It was natural for the papacy to take
the lead in the initiating of a Crusade, since the object was (at least
ostensibly) religious; thus the power of the popes was increased by the
war propaganda and by the religious zeal that was excited. Another
important effect was the massacre of large numbers of Jews; those who
were not massacred were often despoiled of their property and forcibly
baptized. There were large-scale murders of Jews in Germany at the time
of the first Crusade, and in England, at the time of the third Crusade,
on the accession of Richard Cœur de Lion. York, where the first
Christian Emperor had begun his reign, was the scene of one of the most
appalling mass-atrocities against Jews. The Jews, before the Crusades,
had almost a monopoly of the trade in Eastern goods throughout Europe;
after the Crusades, as a result of the persecution of Jews, this trade
was largely in Christian hands.</p>
<p>Another and very different effect of the Crusades was to stimulate
literary intercourse with Constantinople. During the twelfth and early
thirteenth centuries, many translations from Greek into Latin were made
as a result of this intercourse. There had always been much trade with
Constantinople, especially by Venetians; but Italian traders did not
trouble themselves with Greek classics, any more than English or
American traders in Shanghai troubled themselves with the classics of
China. (European knowledge of Chinese classics was derived mainly from
missionaries.)</p>
<p>THE GROWTH OF SCHOLASTICISM</p>
<p>Scholasticism, in its narrower sense, begins early in the twelfth
century. As a philosophic school, it has certain definite
characteristics. First, it is confined within the limits of what appears
to the writer to be orthodoxy; if his views are condemned by a council,
he is usually willing to retract. This is not to be attributed entirely
to cowardice, it is analogous to the submission of a judge to the
decision of a Court of Appeal. Second, within the limits of orthodoxy,
Aristotle, who gradually became more fully known during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, is increasingly accepted as the supreme authority;
Plato no longer holds the first place. Third, there is a great belief in
‘dialectic’ and in syllogistic reasoning; the general temper of the
scholastics is minute and disputatious rather than mystical. Fourth, the
question of universals is brought to the fore by the discovery that
Aristotle and Plato do not agree about it; it would be a mistake to
suppose, however, that universals are the main concern of the
philosophers of this period.</p>
<p>The twelfth century, in this as in other matters, prepares the way
for the thirteenth, to which the greatest names belong. The earlier men
have, however, the interest of pioneers. There is a new intellectual
confidence, and, in spite of the respect for Aristotle, a free and
vigorous exercise of reason wherever dogma has not made speculation too
dangerous. The defects of the scholastic method are those that
inevitably result from laying stress on ‘dialectic’. These defects are:
indifference to facts and science, belief in reasoning in matters which
only observation can decide, and an undue emphasis on verbal
distinctions and subtleties. These defects we had occasion to mention in
connection with Plato, but in the scholastics they exist in a much more
extreme form.</p>
<p>The first philosopher who can be regarded as strictly a scholastic is
Roscelin. Not very much is known about him. He was born at Compiègne
about 1050, and taught at Loches, in Brittany, where Abélard was his
pupil. He was accused of heresy at a council at Rheims in 1092, and
recanted for fear of being stoned to death by ecclesiastics with a taste
for lynching. He fled to England, but there he was rash enough to attack
St Anselm. This time he fled to Rome, where he was reconciled to the
Church. He disappears from history about 1120; the date of his death is
purely conjectural.</p>
<p>Nothing remains of Roscelin’s writings except a letter to Abélard on
the Trinity. In this letter he belittles Abélard and makes merry over
his castration. Ueberweg, who seldom displays emotion, is led to observe
that he can’t have been a very nice man. Apart from this letter,
Roscelin’s views are chiefly known through the controversial writings of
Anselm and Abélard. According to Anselm, he said that universals are
mere flatus vocis, ‘breath of the voice’. If this is to be taken
literally, it means that a universal is a physical occurrence, that,
namely, which takes place when we pronounce a word. It is hardly to be
supposed, however, that Roscelin maintained anything so foolish. Anselm
says that, according to Roscelin, man is not a unity, but only a common
name; this view Anselm, like a good Platonist, attributes to Roscelin’s
only conceding reality to what is sensible. He seems to have held,
generally, that a whole which has parts has no reality of its own, but
is a mere word; the reality is in the parts. This view should have led
him, and perhaps did lead him, to an extreme atomism. In any case, it
led him into trouble about the Trinity. He considered that the Three
Persons are three distinct substances, and that only usage stands in the
way of our saying that there are Three Gods. The alternative, which he
does not accept, is, according to him, to say that not only the Son, but
the Father and the Holy Ghost, were incarnate. All this speculation, in
so far as it was heretical, he recanted at Rheims in 1092. It is
impossible to know exactly what he thought about universals, but at any
rate it is plain that he was some sort of nominalist.</p>
<p>His pupil Abélard (or Abailard) was much abler and much more
distinguished. He was born near Nantes in 1079, was a pupil of William
of Champeaux (a realist) in Paris, and then a teacher in the Paris
cathedral school, where he combated William’s views and compelled him to
modify them. After a period devoted to the study of theology under
Anselm of Laon (not the archbishop), he returned to Paris in 1113, and
acquired extraor dinary popularity as a teacher. It was at this time
that he became the lover of Héloïse, niece of Canon Fulbert. The canon
had him castrated, and he and Héloïse had to retire from the world, he
into a monastery at St Denis, she into a nunnery at Argenteuil. Their
famous correspondence is said, by a learned German named Schmeidler, to
have been entirely composed by Abélard as a literary fiction. I am not
competent to judge as to the correctness of this theory, but nothing in
Abélard’s character makes it impossible. He was always vain,
disputatious, and contemptuous; after his misfortune he was also angry
and humiliated. Héloïse’s letters are much more devoted than his, and
one can imagine him composing them as a balm to his wounded pride.</p>
<p>Even in his retirement, he still had great success as a teacher; the
young liked his cleverness, his dialectical skill, and his irreverence
towards their older teachers. Older men felt the correlative dislike of
him, and in 1121 he was condemned at Soissons for an unorthodox book on
the Trinity. Having made due submission, he became abbot of St Gildas in
Brittany, where he found the monks savage boors. After four miserable
years in this exile, he returned to comparative civilization. His
further history is obscure, except that he continued to teach with great
success, according to the testimony of John of Salisbury. In 1141, at
the instance of St Bernard, he was again condemned, this time at Sens.
He retired to Cluny, and died the next year.</p>
<p>Abélard’s most famous book, composed in 1121–22, is Sic et Non, ‘Yes
and No’. Here he gives dialectical arguments for and against a great
variety of theses, often without attempting to arrive at a conclusion;
clearly he likes the disputation itself, and considers it useful as
sharpening the wits. The book had a considerable effect in waking people
from their dogmatic slumbers. Abélard’s view, that (apart from
Scripture) dialectic is the sole road to truth, while no empiricist can
accept it, had, at the time, a valuable effect as a solvent of
prejudices and an encouragement to the fearless use of the intellect.
Nothing outside the Scriptures, he said, is infallible; even Apostles
and Fathers may err.</p>
<p>His valuation of logic was, from a modern point of view excessive. He
considered it pre-eminently ‘the Christian science’ and made play with
its derivation from ‘Logos’. ‘In the beginning was the Logos’, says St
John’s Gospel, and this, he thought, proves the dignity of Logic.</p>
<p>His chief importance is in logic and theory of knowledge. His
philosophy is a critical analysis, largely linguistic. As for
universals, i.e. what can be predicated of many different things, he
holds that we do not predicate a thing, but a word. In this sense he is
a nominalist. But as against Roscelin he points out that a ‘flatus
vocis’ is a thing; it is not the word as a physical occurrence that we
predicate, but the word as meaning. Here he appeals to Aristotle.
Things, he says, resemble each other, and these resemblances give rise
to universals. But the point of resemblance between two similar things
is not itself a thing; this is the mistake of realism. He says some
things that are even more hostile to realism, for example, that general
concepts are not based in the nature of things, but are confused images
of many things. Nevertheless he does not wholly refuse a place to
Platonic ideas: they exist in the divine mind as patterns for creation;
they are, in fact, God’s concepts.</p>
<p>All this, whether right or wrong, is certainly very able. The most
modern discussions of the problem of universals have not got much
further.</p>
<p>St Bernard, whose saintliness did not suffice to make him
intelligent,3 failed to understand Abélard, and brought unjust
accusations against him. He asserted that Abélard treats the Trinity
like an Arian, grace like a Pelagian, and the Person of Christ like a
Nestorian; that he proves himself a heathen in sweating to prove Plato a
Christian; and further, that he destroys the merit of the Christian
faith by maintaining that God can be completely understood by human
reason. In fact Abélard never maintained this last, and always left a
large province to faith, although, like St Anselm, he thought that the
Trinity could be rationally demonstrated without the help of revelation.
It is true that, at one time, he identified the Holy Ghost with the
Platonic Soul of the World, but he abandoned this view as soon as its
heretical character was pointed out to him. Probably it was more his
combativeness than his doctrines that caused him to be accused of
heresy, for his habit of criticizing pundits made him violently
unpopular with all influential persons.</p>
<p>Most of the learned men of the time were less devoted to dialectic
than Abélard was. There was, especially in the School of Chartres, a
humanistic movement, which admired antiquity, and followed Plato and
Boethius. There was a renewed interest in mathematics: Adelard of Bath
went to Spain early in the twelfth century, and in consequence
translated Euclid.</p>
<p>As opposed to the dry scholastic method, there was a strong mystical
movement, of which St Bernard was the leader. His father was a knight
who died in the first Crusade. He himself was a Cistercian monk, and in
1115 became abbot of the newly-founded abbey of Clairvaux. He was very
influential in ecclesiastical politics—turning the scales against
antipopes, combating heresy in Northern Italy and Southern France,
bringing the weight of orthodoxy to bear on adventurous philosophers,
and preaching the second Crusade. In attacking philosophers he was
usually successful; but after the collapse of his Crusade he failed to
secure the conviction of Gilbert de la Porrée, who agreed with Boethius
more than seemed right to the saintly heresy-hunter. Although a
politician and a bigot, he was a man of genuinely</p>
<p>religious temperament, and his Latin hymns have great beauty.4 Among
those influenced by him, mysticism became increasingly dominant, till it
passed into something like heresy in Joachim of Flora (d. 1202). The
influence of this man, however, belongs to a later time. St Bernard and
his followers sought religious truth, not in reasoning, but in
subjective experience and contemplation. Abélard and Bernard are perhaps
equally one-sided.</p>
<p>Bernard, as a religious mystic, deplored the absorption of the papacy
in worldly concerns, and disliked the temporal power. Although he
preached the Crusade, he did not seem to understand that a war requires
organization, and cannot be conducted by religious enthusiasm alone. He
complains that ‘the law of Justinian, not the law of the Lord’ absorbs
men’s attention. He is shocked when the Pope defends his domain by
military force. The function of the Pope is spiritual, and he should not
attempt actual government. This point of view, however, is combined with
unbounded reverence for the Pope, whom he calls ‘prince of bishops, heir
of the apostles, of the primacy of Abel, the governance of Noah, the
patriarchate of Abraham, the order of Melchizedek, the dignity of Aaron,
the authority of Moses, in judgeship Samuel, in power Peter, in unction
Christ’. The net result of St Bernard’s activities was, of course, a
great increase of the power of the Pope in secular affairs.</p>
<p>John of Salisbury, though not an important thinker, is valuable for
our knowledge of his times, of which he wrote a gossipy account. He was
secretary to three Archbishops of Canterbury, one of whom was Becket; he
was a friend of Hadrian IV; at the end of his life he was bishop of
Chartres, where he died in 1180. In matters outside the faith, he was a
man of sceptical temper; he called himself an Academic (in the sense in
which St Augustine uses this term). His respect for kings was limited:
‘an illiterate king is a crowned ass’. He revered St Bernard, but was
well aware that his attempt to reconcile Plato and Aristotle must be a
failure. He admired Abélard, but laughed at his theory of universals,
and at Roscelin’s equally. He thought logic a good introduction to
learning, but in itself bloodless and sterile. Aristotle, he says, can
be improved on, even in logic; respect for ancient authors should not
hamper the critical exercise of reason. Plato is still to him the
‘prince of all philosophers’. He knows personally most of the learned
men of his time, and takes a friendly part in scholastic debates. On
revisiting one school of philosophy after thirty years, he smiles to
find them still discussing the same problems. The atmosphere of the
society that he frequents is very like that of Oxford Common Rooms
thirty years ago. Towards the end of his life, the cathedral schools
gave place to universities, and</p>
<p>universities, at least in England, have had a remarkable continuity
from that day to this.</p>
<p>During the twelfth century, translators gradually increased the
number of Greek books available to Western students. There were three
main sources of such translations: Constantinople, Palermo, and Toledo.
Of these Toledo was the most important, but the translations coming from
there were often from the Arabic, not direct from the Greek. In the
second quarter of the twelfth century, Archbishop Raymond of Toledo
instituted a college of translators, whose work was very fruitful. In
1128, James of Venice translated Aristotle’s Analytics, Topics, and
Sophistici Elenchi; the Posterior Analytics were found difficult by
Western philosophers. Henry Aristippus of Catania (d. 1162) translated
the Phaedo and Meno, but his translations had no immediate effect.
Partial as was the knowledge of Greek philosophy in the twelfth century,
learned men were aware that much of it remained to be discovered by the
West, and a certain eagerness arose to acquire a fuller knowledge of
antiquity. The yoke of orthodoxy was not so severe as is sometimes
supposed; a man could always write his book, and then, if necessary,
withdraw its heretical portions after full public discussion. Most of
the philosophers of the time were French, and France was important to
the Church as a make-weight against the Empire. Whatever theological
heresies might occur among them, learned clerics were almost all
politically orthodox; this made the peculiar wickedness of Arnold of
Brescia, who was an exception to the rule. The whole of early
scholasticism may be viewed, politically, as an offshoot of the Church’s
struggle for power.</p>
