<h4 id="the-romantic-movement">18 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT</h4>
<p>From the latter part of the eighteenth century to the present day,
art and literature and philosophy, and even politics, have been
influenced, positively or negatively, by a way of feeling which was
characteristic of what, in a large sense, may be called the romantic
movement. Even those who were repelled by this way of feeling were
compelled to take account of it, and in many cases were more affected by
it than they knew. I propose in this chapter to give a brief description
of the romantic outlook, chiefly in matters not definitely
philosophical; for this is the cultural background of most philosophic
thought in the period with which we are now to be concerned.</p>
<p>The romantic movement was not, in its beginnings, connected with
philosophy, though it came before long to have connections with it. With
politics, through Rousseau, it was connected from the first. But before
we can understand its political and philosophical effects we must
consider it in its most essential form, which is as a revolt against
received ethical and aesthetic standards.</p>
<p>The first great figure in the movement is Rousseau, but to some
extent he only expressed already existing tendencies. Cultivated people
in eighteenth-century France greatly admired what they called la
sensibilité, which meant a proneness to emotion, and more particularly
to the emotion of sympathy. To be thoroughly satisfactory, the emotion
must be direct and violent and quite uninformed by thought. The man of
sensibility would be moved to tears by the sight of a single destitute
peasant family, but would be cold to well-thought-out schemes for
ameliorating the lot of peasants as a class. The poor were supposed to
possess more virtue than the rich; the sage was thought of as a man who
retires from the corruption of courts to enjoy the peaceful pleasures of
an unambitious rural existence. As a passing mood, this attitude is to
be found in poets of almost all periods. The exiled Duke in As You Like
It expresses it, though he goes back to his dukedom as soon as he can;
only the melancholy Jaques sincerely prefers the life of the forest.
Even Pope, the perfect exemplar of all that the romantic movement
rebelled against, says:</p>
<p>Happy the man whose wish and care</p>
<p>A few paternal acres bound,</p>
<p>Content to breathe his native air</p>
<p>On his own ground.</p>
<p>The poor, in the imaginations of those who cultivated sensibility,
always had a few paternal acres, and lived on the produce of their own
labour without the need of external commerce. True, they were always
losing the acres in pathetic circumstances, because the aged father
could no longer work, the lovely daughter was going into a decline, and
the wicked mortgagee or the wicked lord was ready to pounce either on
the acres or on the daughter’s virtue. The poor, to the romantics, were
never urban and never industrial; the proletariat is a
nineteenth-century conception, perhaps equally romanticized, but quite
different.</p>
<p>Rousseau appealed to the already existing cult of sensibility, and
gave it a breadth and scope that it might not otherwise have possessed.
He was a democrat, not only in his theories, but in his tastes. For long
periods of his life, he was a poor vagabond, receiving kindness from
people only slightly less destitute than himself. He repaid this
kindness, in action, often with the blackest ingratitude, but in emotion
his response was all that the most ardent devotee of sensibility could
have wished. Having the tastes of a tramp, he found the restraints of
Parisian society irksome. From him the romantics learnt a contempt for
the trammels of convention—first in dress and manners, in the minuet and
the heroic couplet, then in art and love, and at last over the whole
sphere of traditional morals.</p>
<p>The romantics were not without morals; on the contrary, their moral
judgments were sharp and vehement. But they were based on quite other
principles than those that had seemed good to their predecessors. The
period from 1660 to Rousseau is dominated by recollections of the wars
of religion and the civil wars in France and England and Germany. Men
were very conscious of the danger of chaos, of the anarchic tendencies
of all strong passions, of the importance of safety and the sacrifices
necessary to achieve it. Prudence was regarded as the supreme virtue;
intellect was valued as the most effective weapon against subversive
fanatics; polished manners were praised as a barrier against barbarism.
Newton’s orderly cosmos, in which the planets unchangingly revolve about
the sun in law-abiding orbits, became an imaginative symbol of good
government. Restraint in the expression of passion was the chief aim of
education, and the surest mark of a gentleman. In the Revolution,
pre-romantic French aristocrats died quietly; Madame Roland and Danton,
who were romantics, died rhetorically.</p>
<p>By the time of Rousseau, many people had grown tired of safety, and
had begun to desire excitement. The French Revolution and Napoleon gave
them their fill of it. When in 1815, the political world returned to
tranquillity, it was a tranquillity so dead, so rigid, so hostile to all
vigorous life, that only terrified conservatives could endure it.
Consequently there was no such intellectual acquiescence in the status
quo as had characterized France under the Roi Soleil and England until
the French Revolution. Nineteenth-century revolt against the system of
the Holy Alliance took two forms. On the one hand, there was the revolt
of industrialism, both capitalist and proletarian, against monarchy and
aristocracy; this was almost untouched by romanticism, and reverted, in
many respects, to the eighteenth century. This movement is represented
by the philosophical radicals, the free-trade movement, and Marxian
socialism. Quite different from this was the romantic revolt, which was
in part reactionary, in part revolutionary. The romantics did not aim at
peace and quiet, but at vigorous and passionate individual life. They
had no sympathy with industrialism because it was ugly, because
money-grubbing seemed to them unworthy of an immortal soul, and because
the growth of modern economic organizations interfered with individual
liberty. In the post-revolutionary period they were led into politics,
gradually, through nationalism: each nation was felt to have a corporate
soul, which could not be free so long as the boundaries of States were
different from those of nations. In the first half of the nineteenth
century, nationalism was the most vigorous of revolutionary principles,
and most romantics ardently favoured it.</p>
<p>The romantic movement is characterized, as a whole, by the
substitution of aesthetic for utilitarian standards. The earth-worm is
useful, but not beautiful; the tiger is beautiful, but not useful.
Darwin (who was not a romantic) praised the earth-worm; Blake praised
the tiger. The morals of the romantics have primarily aesthetic motives.
But in order to characterize the romantics, it is necessary to take
account, not only of the importance of aesthetic motives, but also of
the change of taste which made their sense of beauty different from that
of their predecessors. Of this, their preference for Gothic architecture
is one of the most obvious examples. Another is their taste in scenery.
Dr Johnson preferred Fleet Street to any rural landscape, and maintained
that a man who is tired of London must be tired of life. If anything in
the country was admired by Rousseau’s predecessors, it was a scene of
fertility, with rich pastures and lowing kine. Rousseau, being Swiss,
naturally admired the Alps. In his disciples’ novels and stories, we
find wild torrents, fearful precipices, pathless forests,
thunder-storms, tempests at sea, and generally what is useless,
destructive, and violent. This change seems to be more or less
permanent: almost everybody, nowadays, prefers Niagara and the Grand
Canyon to lush meadows and fields of waving corn. Tourist hotels afford
statistical evidence of taste in scenery.</p>
<p>The temper of the romantics is best studied in fiction. They liked
what was strange: ghosts, ancient decayed castles, the last melancholy
descendants of once-great families, practitioners of mesmerism and the
occult sciences, falling tyrants and levantine pirates. Fielding and
Smollett wrote of ordinary people in circumstances that might well have
occurred; so did the realists who reacted against romanticism. But to
the romantics such themes were too pedestrian; they felt inspired only
by what was grand, remote, and terrifying. Science, of a somewhat
dubious sort, could be utilized if it led to something astonishing; but
in the main the Middle Ages, and what was most medieval in the present,
pleased the romantics best. Very often they cut loose from actuality,
either past or present, altogether. The Ancient Mariner is typical in
this respect, and Coleridge’s Kubla Khan is hardly the historical
monarch of Marco Polo. The geography of the romantics is interesting:
from Xanadu to ‘the lone Chorasamian shore’, the places in which it is
interested are remote, Asiatic, or ancient.</p>
<p>The romantic movement, in spite of owing its origin to Rousseau, was
at first mainly German. The German romantics were young in the last
years of the eighteenth century, and it was while they were young that
they gave expression to what was most characteristic in their outlook.
Those who had not the good fortune to die young, in the end allowed
their individuality to be obscured in the uniformity of the Catholic
Church. (A romantic could become a Catholic if he had been born a
Protestant, but could hardly be a Catholic otherwise, since it was
necessary to combine Catholicism with revolt.) The German romantics
influenced Coleridge and Shelley, and independently of German influence
the same outlook became common in England during the early years of the
nineteenth century. In France, though in a weakened form, it flourished
after the Restoration, down to Victor Hugo. In America it is to be seen
almost pure in Melville, Thoreau, and Brook Farm, and, somewhat
softened, in Emerson and Hawthorne. Although romantics tended towards
Catholicism, there was something ineradicably Protestant in the
individualism of their outlook, and their permanent successes in
moulding customs, opinions, and institutions were almost wholly confined
to Protestant countries.</p>
<p>The beginnings of romanticism in England can be seen in the writings
of the satirists. In Sheridan’s Rivals (1775), the heroine is determined
to marry some poor man for love rather than a rich man to please her
guardian and his parents; but the rich man whom they have selected wins
her love by wooing her under an assumed name and pretending to be poor.
Jane Austen makes fun of the romantics in Northanger Abbey and Sense and
Sensibility (1797–8). Northanger Abbey has a heroine who is led astray
by Mrs Radcliffe’s ultra-romantic Mysteries of Udolpho, which was
published in 1794. The first good romantic work in England—apart from
Blake, who was a solitary Swedenborgian and hardly part of any
‘movement’—was Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner, published in 1799. In the
following year, having unfortunately been supplied with funds by the
Wedgwoods, he went to Göttingen and became engulfed in Kant, which did
not improve his verse.</p>
<p>After Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Southey had become reactionaries,
hatred of the Revolution and Napoleon put a temporary brake on English
romanticism. But it was soon revived by Byron, Shelley, and Keats, and
in some degree dominated the whole Victorian epoch.</p>
<p>Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, written under the inspiration of
conversations with Byron in the romantic scenery of the Alps, contains
what might almost be regarded as an allegorical prophetic history of the
development of romanticism. Frankenstein’s monster is not, as he has
become in proverbial parlance, a mere monster: he is, at first, a gentle
being, longing for human affection, but he is driven to hatred and
violence by the horror which his ugliness inspires in those whose love
he attempts to gain. Unseen, he observes a virtuous family of poor
cottagers, and surreptitiously assists their labours. At length he
decides to make himself known to them:</p>
<p>‘The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their
protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these
amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with
affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that
they would turn from me with disdain and horror.’</p>
<p>But they did. So he first demanded of his creator the creation of a
female like himself, and, when that was refused, devoted himself to
murdering, one by one, all whom Frankenstein loved. But even then, when
all his murders are accomplished, and while he is gazing upon the dead
body of Frankenstein, the monster’s sentiments remain noble:</p>
<p>‘That also is my victim! in his murder my crimes are consummated; the
miserable genius of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein!
generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee
to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all that
thou lovedst. Alas! he is cold, he cannot answer me…. When I run over
the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so;
the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God
and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.’</p>
<p>Robbed of its romantic form, there is nothing unreal in this
psychology, and it is unnecessary to search out pirates or Vandal kings
in order to find parallels. To an English visitor, the ex-Kaiser, at
Doorn, lamented that the English no longer loved him. Dr Burt, in his
book on the juvenile delinquent, mentions a boy of seven who drowned
another boy in the Regent’s Canal. His reason was that neither his
family nor his contemporaries showed him affection. Dr Burt was kind to
him, and he became a respectable citizen; but no Dr Burt undertook the
reformation of Frankenstein’s monster.</p>
<p>It is not the psychology of the romantics that is at fault: it is
their standard of values. They admire strong passions, of no matter what
kind, and whatever may be their social consequences. Romantic love,
especially when unfortunate, is strong enough to win their approval, but
most of the strongest passions are destructive—hate and resentment and
jealousy, remorse and despair, outraged pride and the fury of the
unjustly oppressed, martial ardour and contempt for slaves and cowards.
Hence the type of man encouraged by romanticism, especially of the
Byronic variety, is violent and anti-social, an anarchic rebel or a
conquering tyrant.</p>
<p>This outlook makes an appeal for which the reasons lie very deep in
human nature and human circumstances. By self-interest Man has become
gregarious, but in instinct he has remained to a great extent solitary;
hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce self-interest. But
the habit of forgoing present satisfactions for the sake of future
advantages is irksome, and when passions are roused the prudent
restraints of social behaviour become difficult to endure. Those who, at
such times, throw them off, acquire a new energy and sense of power from
the cessation of inner conflict, and, though they may come to disaster
in the end, enjoy meanwhile a sense of godlike exaltation which, though
known to the great mystics, can never be experienced by a merely
pedestrian virtue. The solitary part of their nature reasserts itself,
but if the intellect survives the reassertion must clothe itself in
myth. The mystic becomes one with God, and in the contemplation of the
Infinite feels himself absolved from duty to his neighbour. The anarchic
rebel does even better: he feels himself not one with God, but God.
Truth and duty, which represent our subjection to matter and to our
neighbours, exist no longer for the man who has become God; for others,
truth is what he posits, duty what he commands. If we could all live
solitary and without labour, we could all enjoy this ecstasy of
independence; since we cannot, its delights are only available to madmen
and dictators.</p>
<p>Revolt of solitary instincts against social bonds is the key to the
philosophy, the politics, and the sentiments, not only of what is
commonly called the romantic movement, but of its progeny down to the
present day. Philosophy, under the influence of German idealism, became
solipsistic, and self-development was proclaimed as the fundamental
principle of ethics. As regards sentiment, there has to be a distasteful
compromise between the search for isolation and the necessities of
passion and economics. D. H. Lawrence’s story, ‘The Man Who Loved
Islands’, has a hero who disdained such compromise to a gradually
increasing extent and at last died of hunger and cold, but in the
enjoyment of complete isolation; but this degree of consistency has not
been achieved by the writers who praise solitude. The comforts of
civilized life are not obtainable by a hermit, and a man who wishes to
write books or produce works of art must submit to the ministrations of
others if he is to survive while he does his work. In order to continue
to feel solitary, he must be able to prevent those who serve him from
impinging upon his ego, which is best accomplished if they are slaves.
Passionate love, however, is a more difficult matter. So long as
passionate lovers are regarded as in revolt against social trammels,
they are admired; but in real life the love-relation itself quickly
becomes a social trammel, and the partner in love comes to be hated, all
the more vehemently if the love is strong enough to make the bond
difficult to break. Hence love comes to be conceived as a battle, in
which each is attempting to destroy the other by breaking through the
protecting walls of his or her ego. This point of view has become
familiar through the writings of Strindberg, and, still more, of D. H.
Lawrence.</p>
<p>Not only passionate love, but every friendly relation to others, is
only possible, to this way of feeling, in so far as the others can be
regarded as a projection of one’s own Self. This is feasible if the
others are blood-relations, and the more nearly they are related the
more easily it is possible. Hence an emphasis on race, leading, as in
the case of the Ptolemys, to endogamy. How this affected Byron, we know;
Wagner suggests a similar sentiment in the love of Siegmund and
Sieglinde. Nietzsche, though not scandalously, preferred his sister to
all other women: ‘How strongly I feel,’ he writes to her, ‘in all that
you say and do, that we belong to the same stock. You understand more of
me than others do, because we come of the same parentage. This fits in
very well with my “philosophy“.’</p>
<p>The principle of nationality, of which Byron was a protagonist, is an
extension of the same ‘philosophy’. A nation is assumed to be a race,
descended from common ancestors, and sharing some kind of
‘blood-consciousness’. Mazzini, who constantly found fault with the
English for their failure to appreciate Byron, conceived nations as
possessed of a mystical individuality, and attributed to them the kind
of anarchic greatness that other romantics sought in heroic men.
Liberty, for nations, came to be regarded, not only by Mazzini, but by
comparatively sober statesmen, as something absolute, which, in
practice, made international co-operation impossible.</p>
<p>Belief in blood and race is naturally associated with anti-semitism.
At the same time, the romantic outlook, partly because it is
aristocratic, and partly because it prefers passion to calculation, has
a vehement contempt for commerce and finance. It is thus led to proclaim
an opposition to capitalism which is quite different from that of the
socialist who represents the interest of the proletariat, since it is an
opposition based on dislike of economic preoccupations, and strengthened
by the suggestion that the capitalist world is governed by Jews. This
point of view is expressed by Byron on the rare occasions when he
condescends to notice anything so vulgar as economic power:</p>
<p>Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign</p>
<p>O’er conquerors, whether royalist or liberal?</p>
<p>Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?</p>
<p>(That make old Europe’s journals squeak and gibber all.)</p>
<p>Who keep the world, both Old and New, in pain</p>
<p>Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?</p>
<p>The shade of Buonaparte’s noble daring?</p>
<p>Jew Rothschild, and his fellow Christian Baring.</p>
<p>The verse is perhaps not very musical, but the sentiment is quite of
our time, and has been re-echoed by all Byron’s followers.</p>
<p>The romantic movement, in its essence, aimed at liberating human
personality from the fetters of social convention and social morality.
In part, these fetters were a mere useless hindrance to desirable forms
of activity, for every ancient community has developed rules of
behaviour for which there is nothing to be said except that they are
traditional. But egoistic passions, when once let loose, are not easily
brought again into subjection to the needs of society. Christianity has
succeeded, to some extent, in taming the Ego, but economic, political,
and intellectual causes stimulated revolt against the Churches, and the
romantic movement brought the revolt into the sphere of morals. By
encouraging a new lawless Ego it made social co-operation impossible,
and left its disciples faced with the alternative of anarchy or
despotism. Egoism, at first, made men expect from others a parental
tenderness; but when they discovered, with indignation, that others had
their own Ego, the disappointed desire for tenderness turned to hatred
and violence. Man is not a solitary animal, and so long as social life
survives, self-realization cannot be the supreme principle of
ethics.</p>
