<h4 id="platos-theory-of-immortality">16 PLATO’S THEORY OF
IMMORTALITY</h4>
<p>The dialogue called after Phaedo is interesting in several respects.
It purports to describe the last moments in the life of Socrates: his
conversation immediately before drinking the hemlock, and after, until
he loses consciousness. This presents Plato’s ideal of a man who is both
wise and good in the highest degree, and who is totally without fear of
death. Socrates in face of death, as represented by Plato, was important
ethically, both in ancient and in modern times. What the gospel account
of the Passion and the Crucifixion was for Christians, the Phaedo was
for pagan or free-thinking philosophers.1 But the imperturbability of
Socrates in his last hour is bound up with his belief in immortality,
and the Phaedo is important as setting forth, not only the death of a
martyr, but also many doctrines which were afterwards Christian. The
theology of St Paul and of the Fathers was largely derived from it,
directly or indirectly, and can hardly be understood if Plato is
ignored.</p>
<p>An earlier dialogue, the Crito, tells how certain friends and
disciples of Socrates arranged a plan by which he could escape to
Thessaly. Probably the Athenian authorities would have been quite glad
if he had escaped, and the scheme suggested may be assumed to have been
very likely to succeed. Socrates, however, would have none of it. He
contended that he had been condemned by due process of law, and that it
would be wrong to do anything illegal to avoid punishment. He first
proclaimed the principle which we</p>
<p>associate with the Sermon on the Mount, that ‘we ought not to
retaliate evil for evil to any one, whatever evil we may have suffered
from him’. He then imagines himself engaged in a dialogue with the laws
of Athens, in which they point out that he owes them the kind of respect
that a son owes to a father or a slave to his master, but in an even
higher degree; and that, moreover, every Athenian citizen is free to
emigrate if he dislikes the Athenian state. The laws end a long speech
with the words:</p>
<p>Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up. Think not of
life and children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice
first, that you may be justified before the princes of the world below.
For neither will you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or
juster in this life, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids. Now
you depart in innocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim,
not of the laws, but of men. But if you go forth, returning evil for
evil, and injury for injury, breaking the covenants and agreements which
you have made with us, and wronging those whom you ought least of all to
wrong, that is to say, yourself, your friends, your country, and us, we
shall be angry with you while you live, and our brethren, the laws in
the world below, will receive you as an enemy; for they will know that
you have done your best to destroy us.</p>
<p>This voice, Socrates says, ‘I seem to hear humming in my ears like
the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic.’ He decides
accordingly, that it is his duty to stay and abide the death
sentence.</p>
<p>In the Phaedo, the last hour has come; his chains are taken off, and
he is allowed to converse freely with his friends. He sends away his
weeping wife, in order that her grief may not interfere with the
discussion.</p>
<p>Socrates begins by maintaining that, though any one who has the
spirit of philosophy will not fear death, but, on the contrary, will
welcome it, yet he will not take his own life, for that is held to be
unlawful. His friends inquire why suicide is held to be unlawful, and
his answer, which is in accordance with Orphic doctrine, is almost
exactly what a Christian might say. ‘There is a doctrine whispered in
secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door and run
away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite understand.’ He
compares the relation of man to God with that of cattle to their owner;
you would be angry, he says, if your ox took the liberty of putting
himself out of the way, and so ‘there may be reason in saying that a man
should wait, and not take his own life until God summons him, as He is
now summoning me’. He is not grieved at death, because he is convinced
‘in the first place that I am going to other gods who are wise and good
(of which I am as certain as I can be of any such matters) and secondly
(though I am not so sure of this last) to men departed, better than
those whom I leave behind. I have good hope that there is yet something
remaining for the dead, some far better thing for the good than for the
evil’.</p>
<p>Death, says Socrates, is the separation of soul and body. Here we
come under Plato’s dualism: between reality and appearance, ideas and
sensible objects, reason and sense-perception, soul and body. These
pairs are connected: the first in each pair is superior to the second
both in reality and in goodness. An ascetic morality was the natural
consequence of this dualism. Christianity adopted this doctrine in part,
but never wholly. There were two obstacles. The first was that the
creation of the visible world, if Plato was right, might seem to have
been an evil deed, and therefore the Creator could not be good. The
second was that orthodox Christianity could never bring itself to
condemn marriage, though it held celibacy to be nobler. The Manichaeans
were more consistent in both respects.</p>
<p>The distinction between mind and matter, which has become a
commonplace in philosophy and science and popular thought, has a
religious origin, and began as the distinction of soul and body. The
Orphic, as we saw, proclaims himself the child of earth and of the
starry heaven; from earth comes the body, from heaven the soul. It is
this theory that Plato seeks to express in the language of
philosophy.</p>
<p>Socrates, in the Phaedo, proceeds at once to develop the ascetic
implications of his doctrine, but his asceticism is of a moderate and
gentlemanly sort. He does not say that the philosopher should wholly
abstain from ordinary pleasures, but only that he should not be a slave
to them. The philosopher should not care about eating and drinking, but
of course he should eat as much as is necessary; there is no suggestion
of fasting. And we are told that Socrates, though indifferent to wine,
could, on occasion, drink more than anybody else, without ever becoming
intoxicated. It was not drinking that he condemned, but pleasure in
drinking. In like manner, the philosopher must not care for the
pleasures of love, or for costly raiment, or sandals, or other
adornments of the person. He must be entirely concerned with the soul,
and not with the body. ‘He would like, as far as he can, to get away
from the body and to turn to the soul.’</p>
<p>It is obvious that this doctrine, popularized, would become ascetic,
but in intention it is not, properly speaking, ascetic. The philosopher
will not abstain with an effort from the pleasures of sense, but will be
thinking of other things. I have known many philosophers who forgot
their meals, and read a book when at last they did eat. These men were
acting as Plato says they should: they were not abstaining from gluttony
by means of a moral effort, but were more interested in other matters.
Apparently the philosopher should marry, and beget and rear children, in
the same absent-minded way, but since the emancipation of women this has
become more difficult. No wonder Xanthippe was a shrew.</p>
<p>Philosophers, Socrates continues, try to dissever the soul from
communion with the body, whereas other people think that life is not
worth living for a man who has ‘no sense of pleasure and no part in
bodily pleasure’. In this phrase, Plato seems—perhaps inadvertently—to
countenance the view of a certain class of moralists, that bodily
pleasures are the only ones that count. These moralists hold that the
man who does not seek the pleasures of sense must be eschewing pleasure
altogether, and living virtuously. This is an error which has done
untold harm. In so far as the division of mind and body can be accepted,
the worst pleasures, as well as the best, are mental—for example, envy,
and many forms of cruelty and love of power. Milton’s Satan rises
superior to physical torment, and devotes himself to a work of
destruction from which he derives a pleasure that is wholly of the mind.
Many eminent ecclesiastics, having renounced the pleasures of sense, and
not being on their guard against others, became dominated by love of
power, which led them to appalling cruelties and persecutions, nominally
for the sake of religion. In our own day, Hitler belonged to this type;
by all accounts, the pleasures of sense were of very little importance
to him. Liberation from the tyranny of the body contributes to
greatness, but just as much to greatness in sin as to greatness in
virtue.</p>
<p>This, however, is a digression, from which we must return to
Socrates.</p>
<p>We come now to the intellectual aspect of the religion which Plato
(rightly or wrongly) attributes to Socrates. We are told that the body
is a hindrance in the acquisition of knowledge, and that sight and
hearing are inaccurate witnesses: true existence, if revealed to the
soul at all, is revealed in thought, not in sense. Let us consider, for
a moment, the implications of this doctrine. It involves a complete
rejection of empirical knowledge, including all history and geography.
We cannot know that there was such a place as Athens, or such a man as
Socrates; his death, and his courage in dying, belong to the world of
appearance. It is only through sight and hearing that we know anything
about all this, and the true philosopher ignores sight and hearing.
What, then, is left to him? First, logic and mathematics; but these are
hypothetical and do not justify any categorical assertion about the real
world. The next step—and this is the crucial one—depends upon the idea
of the good. Having arrived at this idea, the philosopher is supposed to
know that the good is the real, and thus to be able to infer that the
world of ideas is the real world. Later philosophers had arguments to
prove the identity of the real and the good, but Plato seems to have
assumed it as self-evident. If we wish to understand him, we must,
hypothetically, suppose this assumption justified.</p>
<p>Thought is best, Socrates says, when the mind is gathered into
itself, and is not troubled by sounds or sights or pain or pleasure but
takes leave of the body and aspires after true being; ‘and in this the
philosopher dishonours the body’. From this point, Socrates goes on to
the ideas or forms or essences. There is absolute justice, absolute
beauty, and absolute good, but they are not visible to the eye. ‘And I
speak not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and
strength, and of the essence or true nature of everything.’ All these
are only to be seen by intellectual vision. Therefore while we are in
the body, and while the soul is infected with the evils of the body, our
desire for truth will not be satisfied.</p>
<p>This point of view excludes scientific observation and experiment as
methods for the attainment of knowledge. The experimenter’s mind is not
‘gathered into itself’, and does not aim at avoiding sounds or sights.
The two kinds of mental activity that can be pursued by the method that
Plato recommends are mathematics and mystic insight. This explains how
these two come to be so intimately combined in Plato and the
Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>To the empiricist, the body is what brings us into touch with the
world of external reality, but to Plato it is doubly evil, as a
distorting medium, causing us to see as through a glass darkly, and as a
source of lusts which distract us from the pursuit of knowledge and the
vision of truth. Some quotations will make this clear.</p>
<p>The body is the source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere
requirement of food; and is liable also to diseases which overtake and
impede us in the search after true being: it fills us full of loves, and
lusts, and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and endless foolery, and in
fact, as men say, takes away from us all power of thinking at all.
Whence come wars, and fightings and factions? Whence but from the body
and the lusts of the body? Wars are occasioned by the love of money, and
money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body;
and by reason of all these impediments we have no time to give to
philosophy; and, last and worst of all, even if we are at leisure to
betake ourselves to some speculation, the body is always breaking in
upon us, causing turmoil and confusion in our inquiries, and so amazing
us that we are prevented from seeing the truth. It has been proved to us
by experience that if we would have true knowledge of anything we must
be quit of the body—the soul in herself must behold things in
themselves: and then we shall attain the wisdom which we desire, and of
which we say we are lovers; not while we live, but after death; for if
while in company with the body the soul cannot have pure knowledge,
knowledge must be attained after death, if at all.</p>
<p>And thus having got rid of the foolishness of the body we shall be
pure and have converse with the pure, and know of ourselves the clear
light everywhere, which is no other than the light of truth. For the
impure are not permitted to approach the pure…. And what is purification
but the separation of the soul from the body?… And this separation and
release of the soul from the body is termed death…. And the true
philosophers, and they only, are ever seeking to release the soul.</p>
<p>There is one true coin for which all things ought to be exchanged,
and that is wisdom.</p>
<p>The founders of the mysteries would appear to have had a real
meaning, and were not talking nonsense when they intimated in a figure
long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated into the world
below will lie on a slough, but that he who arrives there after
initiation and purification will dwell with the gods. For many, as they
say in the mysteries, are the thyrsusbearers, but few are the mystics,
meaning, as I interpret the words, the true philosophers.</p>
<p>All this language is mystical, and is derived from the mysteries.
‘Purity’ is an Orphic conception, having primarily a ritual meaning, but
for Plato it means freedom from slavery to the body and its needs. It is
interesting to find him saying that wars are caused by love of money,
and that money is only needed for the service of the body. The first
half of this opinion is the same as that held by Marx, but the second
belongs to a very different outlook. Plato thinks that a man could live
on very little money if his wants were reduced to a minimum, and this no
doubt is true. But he also thinks that a philosopher should be exempt
from manual labour; he must therefore live on wealth created by others.
In a very poor State there are likely to be no philosophers. It was the
imperialism of Athens in the age of Pericles that made it possible for
Athenians to study philosophy. Speaking broadly, intellectual goods are
just as expensive as more material commodities, and just as little
independent of economic conditions. Science requires libraries,
laboratories, telescopes, microscopes, and so on, and men of science
have to be supported by the labour of others. But to the mystic all this
is foolishness. A holy man in India or Tibet needs no apparatus, wears
only a loin cloth, eats only rice, and is supported by very meagre
charity because he is thought wise. This is the logical development of
Plato’s point of view.</p>
<p>To return to the Phaedo: Cebes expresses doubt as to the survival of
the soul after death, and urges Socrates to offer arguments. This he
proceeds to do, but it must be said that the arguments are very
poor.</p>
<p>The first argument is that all things which have opposites are
generated from their opposites—a statement which reminds us of
Anaximander’s views on cosmic justice. Now life and death are opposites,
and therefore each must generate the other. It follows that the souls of
the dead exist somewhere, and come back to earth in due course. St
Paul’s statement, ‘the seed is not quickened except it die,’ seems to
belong to some such theory as this.</p>
<p>The second argument is that knowledge is recollection, and therefore
the soul must have existed before birth. The theory that knowledge is
recollection is supported chiefly by the fact that we have ideas, such
as exact equality, which cannot be derived from experience. We have
experience of approximate equality, but absolute equality is never found
among sensible objects, and yet we know what we mean by ‘absolute
equality’. Since we have not learnt this from experience, we must have
brought the knowledge with us from a previous existence. A similar
argument, he says, applies to all other ideas. Thus the existence of
essences, and our capacity to apprehend them, proves the pre-existence
of the soul with knowledge.</p>
<p>The contention that all knowledge is reminiscence is developed at
greater length in the Meno (82 ff.). Here Socrates says, ‘there is no
teaching, but only recollection.’ He professes to prove his point by
having Meno call in a slaveboy whom Socrates proceeds to question on
geometrical problems. The boy’s answers are supposed to show that he
really knows geometry, although he has hitherto been unaware of
possessing this knowledge. The same conclusion is drawn in the Meno as
in the Phaedo, that knowledge is brought by the soul from a previous
existence.</p>
<p>As to this, one may observe, in the first place, that the argument is
wholly inapplicable to empirical knowledge. The slave-boy could not have
been led to ‘remember’ when the Pyramids were built, or whether the
siege of Troy really occurred, unless he had happened to be present at
these events. Only the sort of knowledge that is called a
priori—especially logic and mathematics—can be possibly supposed to
exist in every one independently of experience. In fact, this is the
only sort of knowledge (apart from mystic insight) that Plato admits to
be really knowledge. Let us see how the argument can be met in regard to
mathematics.</p>
<p>Take the concept of equality. We must admit that we have no
experience, among sensible objects, of exact equality; we see only
approximate equality. How, then, do we arrive at the idea of absolute
equality? Or do we, perhaps, have no such idea?</p>
<p>Let us take a concrete case. The metre is defined as the length of a
certain rod in Paris at a certain temperature. What should we mean if we
said, of some other rod, that its length was exactly one metre? I don’t
think we should mean anything. We could say: That most accurate
processes of measurement known to science at the present day fail to
show that our rod is either longer or shorter than the standard metre in
Paris. We might, if we were sufficiently rash, add a prophecy that no
subsequent refinements in the technique of measurement will alter this
result. But this is still an empirical statement, in the sense that
empirical evidence may at any moment disprove it. I do not think we
really possess the idea of absolute equality that Plato supposes us to
possess.</p>
<p>But even if we do, it is clear that no child possesses it until it
reaches a certain age, and that the idea is elicited by experience,
although not directly derived from experience. Moreover, unless our
existence before birth was not one of sense-perception, it would have
been as incapable of generating the idea as this life is; and if our
previous existence is supposed to have been partly super-sensible, why
not make the same supposition concerning our present existence? On all
these grounds, the argument fails.</p>
<p>The doctrine of reminiscence being considered established, Cebes
says: ‘About half of what was required has been proven; to wit, that our
souls existed before we were born:—that the soul will exist after death
as well as before birth is the other half of which the proof is still
wanting.’ Socrates accordingly applies himself to this. He says that it
follows from what was said about everything being generated from its
opposite, according to which death must generate life just as much as
life generates death. But he adds another argument, which had a longer
history in philosophy: that only what is complex can be dissolved, and
that the soul, like the ideas, is simple and not compounded of parts.
What is simple, it is thought, cannot begin or end or change. Now
essences are unchanging: absolute beauty, for example, is always the
same, whereas beautiful things continually change. Thus things seen are
temporal, but things unseen are eternal. The body is seen, but the soul
is unseen; therefore the soul is to be classified in the group of things
that are eternal.</p>
<p>The soul, being eternal, is at home in the contemplation of eternal
things, that is, essences, but is lost and confused when, as in
sense-perception, it contemplates the world of changing things.</p>
<p>The soul, when using the body as an instrument of perception, that is
to say, when using the sense of sight or hearing or some other sense
(for the meaning of perceiving through the body is perceiving through
the senses) … is then dragged by the body into the region of the
changeable, and wanders and is confused; the world spins round her, and
she is like a drunkard, when she touches change…. But when returning
into herself she reflects, then she passes into the other world, the
region of purity, and eternity, and immortality, and unchangeableness,
which are her kindred, and with them she ever lives, when she is by
herself, and is not let or hindered; then she ceases from her erring
ways, and being in communion with the unchanging is unchanging. And this
state of the soul is called wisdom.</p>
<p>The soul of the true philosopher, which has, in life, been liberated
from thraldom to the flesh, will, after death, depart to the invisible
world, to live in bliss in the company of the gods. But the impure soul,
which has loved the body, will become a ghost haunting the sepulchre, or
will enter into the body of an animal, such as an ass or wolf or hawk,
according to its character. A man who has been virtuous without being a
philosopher will become a bee or wasp or ant, or some other animal of a
gregarious and social sort.</p>
<p>Only the true philosopher goes to heaven when he dies. ‘No one who
has not studied philosophy and who is not entirely pure at the time of
his departure is allowed to enter the company of the Gods, but the lover
of knowledge only.’ That is why the true votaries of philosophy abstain
from fleshly lusts: not that they fear poverty or disgrace, but because
they ‘are conscious that the soul was simply fastened or glued to the
body—until philosophy received her, she could only view real existence
through the bars of a prison, not in and through herself, … and by
reason of lust had become the principal accomplice in her own
captivity’. The philosopher will be temperate because ‘each pleasure and
pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body,
until she becomes like the body, and believes that to be true which the
body affirms to be true’.</p>
<p>At this point, Simmias brings up the Pythagorean opinion that the
soul is a harmony, and urges: if the lyre is broken, can the harmony
survive? Socrates replies that the soul is not a harmony, for a harmony
is complex, but the soul is simple. Moreover, he says, the view that the
soul is a harmony is incompatible with its pre-existence, which was
proved by the doctrine of reminiscence; for the harmony does not exist
before the lyre.</p>
<p>Socrates proceeds to give an account of his own philosophical
development, which is very interesting, but not germane to the main
argument. He goes on to expound the doctrine of ideas, leading to the
conclusion ‘that ideas exist, and that other things participate in them
and derive their names from them’. At last he describes the fate of
souls after death: the good go to heaven, the bad to hell, the
intermediate to purgatory.</p>
<p>His end, and his farewells, are described. His last words are:
‘Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?’
Men paid a cock to Asclepius when they recovered from an illness, and
Socrates has recovered from life’s fitful fever.</p>
<p>‘Of all the men of his time,’ Phaedo concludes, ‘he was the wisest
and justest and best.’</p>
<p>The Platonic Socrates was a pattern to subsequent philosophers for
many ages. What are we to think of him ethically? (I am concerned only
with the man as Plato portrays him.) His merits are obvious. He is
indifferent to worldly success, so devoid of fear that he remains calm
and urbane and humorous to the last moment, caring more for what he
believes to be truth than for anything else whatever. He has, however,
some very grave defects. He is dishonest and sophistical in argument,
and in his private thinking he uses intellect to prove conclusions that
are to him agreeable, rather than in a disinterested search for
knowledge. There is something smug and unctuous about him, which reminds
one of a bad type of cleric. His courage in the face of death would have
been more remarkable if he had not believed that he was going to enjoy
eternal bliss in the company of the gods. Unlike some of his
predecessors, he was not scientific in his thinking, but was determined
to prove the universe agreeable to his ethical standards. This is
treachery to truth, and the worst of philosophic sins. As a man, we may
believe him admitted to the communion of saints; but as a philosopher he
needs a long residence in a scientific purgatory.</p>
