<h4 id="stoicism">28 STOICISM</h4>
<p>Stoicism, while in origin contemporaneous with Epicureanism, had a
longer history and less constancy in doctrine. The teaching of its
founder Zeno, in the early part of the third century B.C., was by no
means identical with that of Marcus Aurelius in the latter half of the
second century A.D. Zeno was a materialist, whose doctrines were, in the
main, a combination of Cynicism and Heraclitus; but gradually, through
an admixture of Platonism, the Stoics abandoned materialism, until, in
the end, little trace of it remained. Their ethical doctrine, it is
true, changed very little, and was what most of them regarded as of the
chief importance. Even in this respect, however, there is some change of
emphasis. As time goes on, continually less is said about the other
aspects of Stoicism, and continually more exclusive stress is laid upon
ethics and those parts of theology that are most relevant to ethics.
With regard to all the earlier Stoics, we are hampered by the fact that
their works survive only in a few fragments. Seneca, Epictetus, and
Marcus Aurelius, who belong to the first and second centuries A.D.,
alone survive in complete books.</p>
<p>Stoicism is less Greek than any school of philosophy with which we
have been hitherto concerned. The early Stoics were mostly Syrian, the
later ones mostly Roman. Tarn (Hellenistic Civilization, p. 287)
suspects Chaldean influences in Stoicism. Ueberweg justly observes that,
in Hellenizing the barbarian world, the Greeks dropped what only suited
themselves. Stoicism, unlike the earlier purely Greek philosophies, is
emotionally narrow, and in a certain sense fanatical; but it also
contains religious elements of which the world felt the need, and which
the Greeks seemed unable to supply. In particular, it appealed to
rulers: ‘nearly all the successors of Alexander—we may say all the
principal kings in existence in the generations following Zeno—professed
themselves Stoics,’ says Professor Gilbert Murray.</p>
<p>Zeno was a Phoenician, born at Citium, in Cyprus, at some time during
the latter half of the fourth century B.C. It seems probable that his
family were engaged in commerce, and that business interests were what
first took him to Athens. When there, however, he became anxious to
study philosophy. The views of the Cynics were more congenial to him
than those of any other school, but he was something of an eclectic. The
followers of Plato accused him of plagiarizing the Academy. Socrates was
the chief saint of the Stoics throughout their history; his attitude at
the time of his trial, his refusal to escape, his calmness in the face
of death, and his contention that the perpetrator of injustice injures
himself more than his victim, all fitted in perfectly with Stoic
teaching. So did his indifference to heat and cold, his plainness in
matters of food and dress, and his complete independence of all bodily
comforts. But the Stoics never took over Plato’s doctrine of ideas, and
most of them rejected his arguments for immortality. Only the later
Stoics followed him in regarding the soul as immaterial; the earlier
Stoics agreed with Heraclitus in the view that the soul is composed of
material fire. Verbally, this doctrine is also to be found in Epictetus
and Marcus Aurelius, but it seems that in them the fire is not to be
taken literally as one of the four elements of which physical things are
composed.</p>
<p>Zeno had no patience with metaphysical subtleties. Virtue was what he
thought important, and he only valued physics and metaphysics in so far
as they contributed to virtue. He attempted to combat the metaphysical
tendencies of the age by means of common sense, which, in Greece, meant
materialism. Doubts as to the trustworthiness of the senses annoyed him,
and he pushed the opposite doctrine to extremes.</p>
<p>’Zeno began by asserting the existence of the real world. “What do
you mean by real?“ asked the Sceptic. “I mean solid and material. I mean
that this table is solid matter.“ “And God,“ asked the Sceptic, “and the
Soul?“ “Perfectly solid,“ said Zeno, “more solid if anything, than the
table.“ “And virtue or justice or the Rule of Three; also solid matter?“
“Of course,“ said Zeno, “quite solid.“’1</p>
<p>It is evident that, at this point, Zeno, like many others, was
hurried by anti-metaphysical zeal into a metaphysic of his own.</p>
<p>The main doctrines to which the school remained constant throughout
are concerned with cosmic determinism and human freedom. Zeno believed
that there is no such thing as chance, and that the course of nature is
rigidly determined by natural laws. Originally there was only fire; then
the other elements—air, water, earth, in that order—gradually emerged.
But sooner or later there will be a cosmic conflagration, and all will
again become fire. This, according to most Stoics, is not a final
consummation, like the end of the</p>
<p>world in Christian doctrine, but only the conclusion of a cycle; the
whole process will be repeated endlessly. Everything that happens has
happened before, and will happen again, not once, but countless
times.</p>
<p>So far, the doctrine might seem cheerless, and in no respect more
comforting than ordinary materialism such as that of Democritus. But
this was only one aspect of it. The course of nature, in Stoicism as in
eighteenth-century theology, was ordained by a Lawgiver who was also a
beneficent Providence. Down to the smallest detail, the whole was
designed to secure certain ends by natural means. These ends, except in
so far as they concern gods and daemons, are to be found in the life of
man. Everything has a purpose connected with human beings. Some animals
are good to eat, some afford tests of courage; even bed bugs are useful,
since they help us to wake in the morning and not lie in bed too long.
The supreme Power is called sometimes God, sometimes Zeus. Seneca
distinguished this Zeus from the object of popular belief, who was also
real, but subordinate.</p>
<p>God is not separate from the world; He is the soul of the world, and
each of us contains a part of the Divine Fire. All things are parts of
one single system, which is called Nature; the individual life is good
when it is in harmony with Nature. In one sense, every life is in
harmony with Nature, since it is such as Nature’s laws have caused it to
be; but in another sense a human life is only in harmony with Nature
when the individual will is directed to ends which are among those of
Nature. Virtue consists in a will which is in agreement with Nature. The
wicked, though perforce they obey God’s law, do so involuntarily; in the
simile of Cleanthes, they are like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled
to go wherever it goes.</p>
<p>In the life of an individual man, virtue is the sole good; such
things as health, happiness, possessions, are of no account. Since
virtue resides in the will, everything really good or bad in a man’s
life depends only upon himself. He may become poor, but what of it? He
can still be virtuous. A tyrant may put him in prison, but he can still
persevere in living in harmony with Nature. He may be sentenced to
death, but he can die nobly, like Socrates. Other men have power only
over externals; virtue, which alone is truly good, rests entirely with
the individual. Therefore every man has perfect freedom, provided he
emancipates himself from mundane desires. It is only through false
judgments that such desires prevail; the sage whose judgments are true
is master of his fate in all that he values, since no outside force can
deprive him of virtue.</p>
<p>There are obvious logical difficulties about this doctrine. If virtue
is really the sole good, a beneficent Providence must be solely
concerned to cause virtue, yet the laws of Nature have produced
abundance of sinners. If virtue is the sole good, there can be no reason
against cruelty and injustice, since, as the Stoics are never tired of
pointing out, cruelty and injustice afford the sufferer the best
opportunities for the exercise of virtue. If the world is completely
deterministic, natural laws will decide whether I shall be virtuous or
not. If I am wicked, Nature compels me to be wicked, and the freedom
which virtue is supposed to give is not possible for me.</p>
<p>To a modern mind, it is difficult to feel enthusiastic about a
virtuous life if nothing is going to be achieved by it. We admire a
medical man who risks his life in an epidemic of plague, because we
think illness is an evil, and we hope to diminish its frequency. But if
illness is no evil, the medical man might as well stay comfortably at
home. To the Stoic, his virtue is an end in itself, not something that
does good. And when we take a longer view, what is the ultimate outcome?
A destruction of the present world by fire, and then a repetition of the
whole process. Could anything be more devastatingly futile? There may be
progress here and there, for a time, but in the long run there is only
recurrence. When we see something unbearably painful, we hope that in
time such things will cease to happen; but the Stoic assures us that
what is happening now will happen over and over again. Providence, which
sees the whole, must, one would think, ultimately grow weary through
despair.</p>
<p>There goes with this a certain coldness in the Stoic conception of
virtue. Not only bad passions are condemned, but all passions. The sage
does not feel sympathy; when his wife or his children die, he reflects
that this event is no obstacle to his own virtue, and therefore he does
not suffer deeply. Friendship, so highly prized by Epicurus, is all very
well, but it must not be carried to the point where your friend’s
misfortunes can destroy your holy calm. As for public life, it may be
your duty to engage in it, since it gives opportunities for justice,
fortitude, and so on; but you must not be actuated by a desire to
benefit mankind, since the benefits you can confer—such as peace, or a
more adequate supply of food—are no true benefits, and, in any case,
nothing matters to you except your own virtue. The Stoic is not virtuous
in order to do good, but does good in order to be virtuous. It has not
occurred to him to love his neighbour as himself; love, except in a
superficial sense, is absent from his conception of virtue.</p>
<p>When I say this, I am thinking of love as an emotion, not as a
principle. As a principle, the Stoics preached universal love; this
principle is found in Seneca and his successors, and probably was taken
by them from earlier Stoics. The logic of the school led to doctrines
which were softened by the humanity of its adherents, who were much
better men than they would have been if they had been consistent.
Kant—who resembles them—says that you must be kind to your brother, not
because you are fond of him, but because the moral law enjoins kindness;
I doubt, however, whether, in private life, he lived down to this
precept.</p>
<p>Leaving these generalities, let us come to the history of
Stoicism.</p>
<p>Of Zeno,2 only some fragments remain. From these it appears that he
defined God as the fiery mind of the world, that he said God was a
bodily substance, and that the whole universe formed the substance of
God; Tertullian says that, according to Zeno, God runs through the
material world as honey runs through the honeycomb. According to
Diogenes Laertius, Zero held that the General Law, which is Right
Reason, pervading everything, is the same as Zeus, the Supreme Head of
the government of the universe: God, Mind, Destiny, Zeus, are one thing.
Destiny is a power which moves matter; ‘Providence’ and ‘Nature’ are
other names for it. Zeno does not believe that there should be temples
to the gods: ‘To build temples there will be no need: for a temple must
not be held a thing of great worth or anything holy. Nothing can be of
great worth or holy which is the work of builders and mechanics.’ He
seems, like the later Stoics, to have believed in astrology and
divination. Cicero says that he attributed a divine potency to the
stars. Diogenes Laertius says: ‘All kinds of divination the Stoics leave
valid. There must be divination, they say, if there is such a thing as
Providence. They prove the reality of the art of divination by a number
of cases in which predictions have come true, as Zeno asserts.’
Chrysippus is explicit on this subject.</p>
<p>The Stoic doctrine as to virtue does not appear in the surviving
fragments of Zeno, but seems to have been held by him.</p>
<p>Cleanthes of Assos, the immediate successor of Zeno, is chiefly
notable for two things. First: as we have already seen, he held that
Aristarchus of Samos should be prosecuted for impiety because he made
the sun, instead of the earth, the centre of the universe. The second
thing is his Hymn to Zeus, much of which might have been written by
Pope, or any educated Christian in the century after Newton. Even more
Christian is the short prayer of Cleanthes:</p>
<p>Lead me, O Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,</p>
<p>Lead thou me on.</p>
<p>To whatsoever task thou sendest me,</p>
<p>Lead thou me on.</p>
<p>I follow fearless, or, if in mistrust</p>
<p>I lag and will not, follow still I must.</p>
<p>Chrysippus (280–207 B.C.), who succeeded Cleanthes, was a voluminous
author, and is said to have written seven hundred and five books. He
made Stoicism systematic and pedantic. He held that only Zeus, the
Supreme Fire, is immortal; the other gods, including the sun and moon,
are born and die. He is said to have considered that God has no share in
the causation of evil, but it is not clear how he reconciled this with
determinism. Elsewhere he deals</p>
<p>with evil after the manner of Heraclitus, maintaining that opposites
imply one another, and good without evil is logically impossible: ‘There
can be nothing more inept than the people who suppose that good could
have existed without the existence of evil. Good and evil being
antithetical, both must needs subsist in opposition.’ In support of this
doctrine he appeals to Plato, not to Heraclitus.</p>
<p>Chrysippus maintained that the good man is always happy and the bad
man unhappy, and that the good man’s happiness differs in no way from
God’s. On the question whether the soul survives death, there were
conflicting opinions. Cleanthes maintained that all souls survive until
the next universal conflagration (when everything is absorbed into God);
but Chrysippus maintained that this is only true of the souls of the
wise. He was less exclusively ethical in his interests than the later
Stoics; in fact, he made logic fundamental. The hypothetical and
disjunctive syllogism, as well as the word ‘disjunction’, are due to the
Stoics; so is the study of grammar and the inventions of ‘cases’ in
declension.3 Chrysippus, or other Stoics inspired by his work, had an
elaborate theory of knowledge, in the main empirical and based on
perception, though they allowed certain ideas and principles, which were
held to be established by consensus gentium, the agreement of mankind.
But Zeno, as well as the Roman Stoics, regarded all theoretical studies
as subordinate to ethics; he says that philosophy is like an orchard, in
which logic is the walls, physics the trees, and ethics the fruit; or
like an egg, in which logic is the shell, physics the white, and ethics
the yolk.4 Chrysippus, it would seem, allowed more independent value to
theoretical studies. Perhaps his influence accounts for the fact that
among the Stoics there were many men who made advances in mathematics
and other sciences.</p>
<p>Stoicism, after Chrysippus, was considerably modified by two
important men, Panaetius and Posidonius. Panaetius introduced a
considerable element of Platonism, and abandoned materialism. He was a
friend of the younger Scipio, and had an influence on Cicero, through
whom, mainly, Stoicism became known to the Romans. Posidonius, under
whom Cicero studied in Rhodes, influenced him even more. Posidonius was
taught by Panaetius, who died about 110 B.C.</p>
<p>Posidonius (ca. 135–ca. 51 B.C.) was a Syrian Greek, and was a child
when the Seleucid empire came to an end. Perhaps it was his experience
of anarchy in Syria that caused him to travel westward, first to Athens,
where he imbibed the Stoic philosophy, and then further afield, to the
western parts of the Roman Empire. ’He saw with his own eyes the sunset
in the Atlantic beyond the verge of the known world, and the African
coast over against Spain, where</p>
<p>the trees were full of apes, and the villages of barbarous people
inland from Marseilles, where human heads hanging at the house-doors for
trophies were an every-day sight.’5 He became a voluminous writer on
scientific subjects; indeed, one of the reasons for his travels was a
wish to study the tides, which could not be done in the Mediterranean.
He did excellent work in astronomy; as we saw in Chapter 24 his estimate
of the distance of the sun was the best in antiquity.6 He was also a
historian of note—he continued Polybius. But it was chiefly as an
eclectic philosopher that he was known: he combined with Stoicism much
of Plato’s teaching, which the Academy, in its sceptical phase, appeared
to have forgotten.</p>
<p>This affinity to Plato is shown in his teaching about the soul and
the life after death. Panaetius had said, as most Stoics did, that the
soul perishes with the body. Posidonius, on the contrary, says that it
continues to live in the air, where, in most cases, it remains unchanged
until the next world-conflagration. There is no hell, but the wicked,
after death, are not so fortunate as the good, for sin makes the vapours
of the soul muddy, and prevents it from rising as far as the good soul
rises. The very wicked stay near the earth and are reincarnated; the
truly virtuous rise to the stellar sphere and spend their time watching
the stars go round. They can help other souls; this explains (he thinks)
the truth of astrology. Bevan suggests that, by this revival of Orphic
notions and incorporation of Neo-Pythagorean beliefs, Posidonius may
have paved the way for Gnosticism. He adds, very truly, that what was
fatal to such philosophies as his was not Christianity but the
Copernican theory.7 Cleanthes was right in regarding Aristarchus of
Samos as a dangerous enemy.</p>
<p>Much more important historically (though not philosophically) than
the earlier Stoics were the three who were connected with Rome: Seneca,
Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius—a minister, a slave, and an emperor,
respectively.</p>
<p>Seneca (ca. 3 B.C. to A.D. 65) was a Spaniard, whose father was a
cultivated man living in Rome. Seneca adopted a political career, and
was being moderately successful when he was banished to Corsica (A.D.
41) by the Emperor Claudius, because he had incurred the enmity of the
Empress Messalina. Claudius’s second wife Agrippina recalled Seneca from
exile in A.D. 48, and appointed him tutor to her son, aged eleven.
Seneca was less fortunate than Aristotle in his pupil, who was the
Emperor Nero. Although, as a Stoic,</p>
<p>Seneca officially despised riches, he amassed a huge fortune,
amounting, it was said, to three hundred million sesterces (about three
million pounds). Much of this he acquired by lending money in Britain;
according to Dio, the excessive rates of interest that he exacted were
among the causes of revolt in that country. The heroic Queen Boadicea,
if this is true, was heading a rebellion against capitalism as
represented by the philosophic apostle of austerity.</p>
<p>Gradually, as Nero’s excesses grew more unbridled, Seneca fell
increasingly out of favour. At length he was accused, justly or
unjustly, of complicity in a widespread conspiracy to murder Nero and
place a new emperor—some said, Seneca himself—upon the throne. In view
of his former services, he was graciously permitted to commit suicide
(A.D. 65).</p>
<p>His end was edifying. At first, on being informed of the Emperor’s
decision, he set about making a will. When told that there was no time
allowed for such a lengthy business, he turned to his sorrowing family
and said: ‘Never mind, I leave you what is of far more value than
earthly riches, the example of a virtuous life’—or words to that effect.
He then opened his veins, and summoned his secretaries to take down his
dying words; according to Tacitus, his eloquence continued to flow
during his last moments. His nephew Lucan, the poet, suffered a similar
death at the same time, and expired reciting his own verses. Seneca was
judged, in future ages, rather by his admirable precepts than by his
somewhat dubious practice. Several of the Fathers claimed him as a
Christian, and a supposed correspondence between him and Saint Paul was
accepted as genuine by such men as Saint Jerome.</p>
<p>Epictetus (born about A.D. 60, died about A.D. 100) is a very
different type of man, though closely akin as a philosopher. He was a
Greek, originally a slave of Epaphroditus, a freedman of Nero and then
his minister. He was lame—as a result, it was said of a cruel punishment
in his days of slavery. He lived and taught at Rome until A.D. 90, when
the Emperor Domitian, who had no use for intellectuals, banished all
philosophers. Epictetus thereupon retired to Nicopolis in Epirus, where,
after some years spent in writing and teaching, he died.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 121–180) was at the other end of the social
scale. He was the adopted son of the good Emperor Antoninus Pius, who
was his uncle and his father-in-law, whom he succeeded in A.D. 161, and
whose memory he revered. As Emperor, he devoted himself to Stoic virtue.
He had much need of fortitude, for his reign was beset by
calamities—earthquakes, pestilences, long and difficult wars, military
insurrections. His Meditations, which are addressed to himself, and
apparently not intended for publication, show that he felt his public
duties burdensome, and that he suffered from a great weariness. His only
son Commodus, who succeeded him, turned out to be one of the worst of
the many bad emperors, but successfully concealed his vicious
propensities so long as his father lived. The philosopher’s wife
Faustina was accused, perhaps unjustly, of gross immorality, but he
never suspected her, and after her death took trouble about her
deification. He persecuted the Christians, because they rejected the
State religion, which he considered politically necessary. In all his
actions he was conscientious, but in most he was unsuccessful. He is a
pathetic figure: in a list of mundane desires to be resisted, the one
that he finds most seductive is the wish to retire to a quiet country
life. For this, the opportunity never came. Some of his Meditations are
dated from the camp, on distant campaigns, the hardships of which
eventually caused his death.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius are completely at
one on all philosophical questions. This suggests that although social
circumstances affect the philosophy of an age, individual circumstances
have less influence than is sometimes thought upon the philosophy of an
individual. Philosophers are usually men with a certain breadth of mind,
who can largely discount the accidents of their private lives; but even
they cannot rise above the larger good or evil of their time. In bad
times they invent consolations; in good times their interests are more
purely intellectual.</p>
<p>Gibbon, whose detailed history begins with the vices of Commodus,
agrees with most eighteenth-century writers in regarding the period of
the Antonines as a golden age. ‘If a man were called upon,’ he says, ‘to
fix the period in the history of the world, during which the condition
of the human race was most happy and prosperous, he would, without
hesitation, name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the
accession of Commodus.’ It is impossible to agree altogether with this
judgment. The evil of slavery involved immense suffering, and was
sapping the vigour of the ancient world. There were gladiatorial shows
and fights with wild beasts, which were intolerably cruel and must have
debased the populations that enjoyed the spectacle. Marcus Aurelius, it
is true, decreed that gladiators should fight with blunted swords; but
this reform was short-lived, and he did nothing about fights with wild
beasts. The economic system was very bad; Italy was going out of
cultivation, and the population of Rome depended upon the free
distribution of grain from the provinces. All initiative was
concentrated in the Emperor and his ministers; throughout the vast
extent of the Empire, no one, except an occasional rebellious general,
could do anything but submit. Men looked to the past for what was best;
the future, they felt, would be at best a weariness, and at worst a
horror. When we compare the tone of Marcus Aurelius with that of Bacon,
or Locke, or Condorcet, we see the difference between a tired and a
hopeful age. In a hopeful age, great present evils can be endured,
because it is thought that they will pass; but in a tired age even real
goods lose their savour. The Stoic ethic suited the times of Epictetus
and Marcus Aurelius, because its gospel was one of endurance rather than
hope.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the age of the Antonines was much better than any later
age until the Renaissance, from the point of view of the general
happiness. But careful study shows that it was not so prosperous as its
architectural remains would lead one to suppose. Graeco-Roman
civilization had made very little impression on the agricultural
regions; it was practically limited to the cities. Even in the cities,
there was a proletariat which suffered very great poverty, and there was
a large slave class. Rostovtseff sums up a discussion of social and
economic conditions in the cities as follows:8</p>
<p>‘This picture of their social conditions is not so attractive as the
picture of their external appearance. The impression conveyed by our
sources is that the splendour of the cities was created by, and existed
for, a rather small minority of their populations, that the welfare even
of this small minority was based on comparatively weak foundations; that
the large masses of the city population had either a very moderate
income or lived in extreme poverty. In a word, we must not exaggerate
the wealth of the cities: their external aspect is misleading.’</p>
<p>On earth, says Epictetus, we are prisoners, and in an earthly body.
According to Marcus Aurelius, he used to say ‘Thou art a little soul
bearing about a corpse.’ Zeus could not make the body free, but he gave
us a portion of his divinity. God is the father of men, and we are all
brothers. We should not say ‘I am an Athenian’ or ‘I am a Roman,’ but ‘I
am a citizen of the universe.’ If you were a kinsman of Caesar, you
would feel safe; how much more should you feel safe in being a kinsman
of God? If we understand that virtue is the only true good, we shall see
that no real evil can befall us.</p>
<p>I must die. But must I die groaning? I must be imprisoned. But must I
whine as well? I must suffer exile. Can any one then hinder me from
going with a smile, and a good courage, and at peace? ‘Tell the secret.’
I refuse to tell, for this is in my power. ‘But I will chain you.’ What
say you, fellow? Chain me? My leg you will chain—yes, but my will—no,
not even Zeus can conquer that. ‘I will imprison you.’ My bit of a body,
you mean. ‘I will behead you.’ Why? When did I ever tell you that I was
the only man in the world that could not be beheaded?</p>
<p>These are the thoughts that those who pursue philosophy should
ponder, these are the lessons they should write down day by day, in
these they should exercise themselves.9</p>
<p>Slaves are the equals of other men, because all alike are sons of
God.</p>
<p>We must submit to God as a good citizen submits to the law. ’The
soldier swears to respect no man above Caesar, but we to respect
ourselves first of</p>
<p>all.’10 ’When you appear before the mighty of the earth, remember
that Another looks from above on what is happening, and that you must
please Him rather than this man.’11</p>
<p>Who then is a Stoic?</p>
<p>Show me a man moulded to the pattern of the judgments that he utters,
in the same way as we call a statue Phidian that is moulded according to
the art of Phidias. Show me one who is sick and yet happy, in peril and
yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and
happy. Show him me. By the gods I would fain see a Stoic. Nay you cannot
show me a finished Stoic; then show me one in the moulding, one who has
set his feet on the path. Do me this kindness, do not grudge an old man
like me a sight I never saw till now. What! You think you are going to
show me the Zeus of Phidias or his Athena, that work of ivory and gold?
It is a soul I want; let one of you show me the soul of a man who wishes
to be one with God, and to blame God or man no longer, to fail in
nothing, to feel no misfortune, to be free from anger, envy, and
jealousy—one who (why wrap up my meaning?) desires to change his manhood
for godhead, and who in this poor body of his has his purpose set upon
communion with God. Show him to me. Nay, you cannot.</p>
<p>Epictetus is never weary of showing how we should deal with what are
considered misfortunes, which he does often by means of homely
dialogues.</p>
<p>Like the Christians, he holds that we should love our enemies. In
general, in common with other Stoics, he despises pleasure, but there is
a kind of happiness that is not to be despised. ‘Athens is beautiful.
Yes, but happiness is far more beautiful—freedom from passion and
disturbance, the sense that your affairs depend on no one’ (p. 428).
Every man is an actor in a play, in which God has assigned the parts; it
is our duty to perform our part worthily, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>There is great sincerity and simplicity in the writings which record
the teaching of Epictetus. (They are written down from notes by his
pupil Arrian.) His morality is lofty and unworldly; in a situation in
which a man’s main duty is to resist tyrannical power, it would be
difficult to find anything more helpful. In some respects, for instance
in recognizing the brotherhood of man and in teaching the equality of
slaves, it is superior to anything to be found in Plato or Aristotle or
any philosopher whose thought is inspired by the City State. The actual
world, in the time of Epictetus, was very inferior to the Athens of
Pericles; but the evil in what existed liberated his aspirations, and
his ideal world is as superior to that of Plato as his actual world is
inferior to the Athens of the fifth century.</p>
<p>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius begin by acknowledging his
indebtedness to his grandfather, father, adopted father, various
teachers, and the gods. Some of the obligations he enumerates are
curious. He learned (he says) from Diognetus not to listen to
miracle-workers; from Rusticus not to write poetry; from Sextus to
practise gravity without affectation; from Alexander the grammarian, not
to correct bad grammar in others, but to use the right expression
shortly afterwards; from Alexander the Platonist, not to excuse
tardiness in answering a letter by the plea of press of business; from
his adopted father, not to fall in love with boys. He owes it to the
gods (he continues) that he was not brought up too long with his
grandfather’s concubine, and did not make proof of his virility too
soon; that his children are neither stupid nor deformed in body; that
his wife is obedient, affectionate, and simple; and that when he took to
philosophy he did not waste time on history, syllogism, or
astronomy.</p>
<p>What is impersonal in the Meditations agrees closely with Epictetus.
Marcus Aurelius is doubtful about immortality, but says, as a Christian
might: ‘Since it is possible that thou mayst depart from life this very
moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly.’ Life in harmony
with the universe is what is good; and harmony with the universe is the
same thing as obedience to the will of God.</p>
<p>‘Everything harmonizes with me which is harmonious to thee, O
Universe. Nothing for me is too early or too late, which is in due time
for thee. Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, O Nature:
from thee are all things, in thee are all things, to thee all things
return. The poet says, Dear city of Cecrops; and wilt not thou say, Dear
city of Zeus?’</p>
<p>One sees that Saint Augustine’s City of God was in part taken over
from the pagan Emperor.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius is persuaded that God gives every man a special
daemon as his guide—a belief which reappears in the Christian guardian
angel. He finds comfort in the thought of the universe as a closely-knit
whole; it is, he says, one living being, having one substance and one
soul. One of his maxims is: ‘Frequently consider the connection of all
things in the universe.’ ‘Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared
for thee from all eternity; and the implication of causes was from
eternity spinning the thread of thy being.’ There goes with this, in
spite of his position in the Roman State, the Stoic belief in the human
race as one community: ‘My city and country, so far as I am Antoninus,
is Rome, but so far as I am a man, it is the world.’ There is the
difficulty that one finds in all Stoics, of reconciling determinism with
the freedom of the will. ‘Men exist for the sake of one another,’ he
says, when he is thinking of his duty as ruler. ‘The wickedness of one
man does no harm to another,’ he says on the same page, when he is
thinking of the doctrine that the virtuous will alone is good. He never
inferred that the goodness of one man does no good to another, and that
he would do no harm to anybody but himself if he were as bad an Emperor
as Nero; and yet this conclusion seems to follow.</p>
<p>‘It is peculiar to man,’ he says, ‘to love even those who do wrong.
And this happens if, when they do wrong, it occurs to thee that they are
kinsmen, and that they do wrong through ignorance and unintentionally,
and that soon both of you will die; and above all, that the wrong-doer
has done thee no harm, for he has not made thy ruling faculty worse than
it was before.’</p>
<p>And again: ‘Love mankind, Follow God…. And it is enough to remember
that Law rules all.’</p>
<p>These passages bring out very clearly the inherent contradictions in
Stoic ethics and theology. On the one hand, the universe is a rigidly
deterministic single whole, in which all that happens is the result of
previous causes. On the other hand, the individual will is completely
autonomous, and no man can be forced to sin by outside causes. This is
one contradiction, and there is a second closely connected with it.
Since the will is autonomous, and the virtuous will alone is good, one
man cannot do either good or harm to another; therefore benevolence is
an illusion. Something must be said about each of these
contradictions.</p>
<p>The contradiction between free will and determinism is one of those
that run through philosophy from early times to our own day, taking
different forms at different times. At present it is the Stoic form that
concerns us.</p>
<p>I think that a Stoic, if we could make him submit to a Socratic
interrogation, would defend his view more or less as follows: The
universe is a single animate Being, having a soul which may also be
called God or Reason. As a whole, this Being is free. God decided, from
the first, that He would act according to fixed general laws, but He
chose such laws as would have the best results. Sometimes, in particular
cases, the results are not wholly desirable, but this inconvenience is
worth enduring, as in human codes of law, for the sake of the advantage
of legislative fixity. A human being is partly fire, partly of lower
clay; in so far as he is fire (at any rate when it is of the best
quality), he is part of God. When the divine part of a man exercises
will virtuously, this will is part of God’s, which is free; therefore in
these circumstances the human will also is free.</p>
<p>This is a good answer up to a point, but it breaks down when we
consider the causes of our volitions. We all know, as a matter of
empirical fact, that dyspepsia, for example, has a bad effect on a man’s
virtue, and that, by suitable drugs forcibly administered, will-power
can be destroyed. Take Epictetus’s favourite case, the man unjustly
imprisoned by a tyrant, of which there have been more examples in recent
years than at any other period in human history. Some of these men have
acted with Stoic heroism; some, rather mysteriously, have not. It has
become clear, not only that sufficient torture will break down almost
any man’s fortitude, but also that morphia or cocaine can reduce a man
to docility. The will, in fact, is only independent of the tyrant so
long as the tyrant is unscientific. This is an extreme example; but the
same arguments that exist in favour of determinism in the inanimate
world exist also in the sphere of human volitions in general. I do not
say—I do not think—that these arguments are conclusive; I say only that
they are of equal strength in both cases, and that there can be no good
reason for accepting them in one region and rejecting them in another.
The Stoic, when he is engaged in urging a tolerant attitude to sinners,
will himself urge that the sinful will is a result of previous causes;
it is only the virtuous will that seems to him free. This, however, is
inconsistent. Marcus Aurelius explains his own virtue as due to the good
influence of parents, grandparents, and teachers; the good will is just
as much a result of previous causes as the bad will. The Stoic may say
truly that his philosophy is a cause of virtue in those who adopt it,
but it seems that it will not have this desirable effect unless there is
a certain admixture of intellectual error. The realization that virtue
and sin alike are the inevitable result of previous causes (as the
Stoics should have held) is likely to have a somewhat paralysing effect
on moral effort.</p>
<p>I come now to the second contradiction, that the Stoic, while he
preached benevolence, held, in theory, that no man can do either good or
harm to another, since the virtuous will alone is good, and the virtuous
will is independent of outside causes. This contradiction is more patent
than the other, and more peculiar to the Stoics (including certain
Christian moralists). The explanation of their not noticing it is that,
like many other people, they had two systems of ethics, a superfine one
for themselves, and an inferior one for ‘the lesser breeds without the
law’. When the Stoic philosopher is thinking of himself, he holds that
happiness and all other worldly so-called goods are worthless; he even
says that to desire happiness is contrary to nature, meaning that it
involves lack of resignation to the will of God. But as a practical man
administering the Roman Empire, Marcus Aurelius knows perfectly well
that this sort of thing won’t do. It is his duty to see that the
grainships from Africa duly reach Rome, that measures are taken to
relieve the sufferings caused by pestilence, and that barbarian enemies
are not allowed to cross the frontier. That is to say, in dealing with
those of his subjects whom he does not regard as Stoic philosophers,
actual or potential, he accepts ordinary mundane standards of what is
good or bad. It is by applying these standards that he arrives at his
duty as an administrator. What is odd is that this duty, itself, is in
the higher sphere of what the Stoic sage should do, although it is
deduced from an ethic which the Stoic sage regards as fundamentally
mistaken.</p>
<p>The only reply that I can imagine to this difficulty is one which is
perhaps logically unassailable, but is not very plausible. It would, I
think, be given by Kant, whose ethical system is very similar to that of
the Stoics. True, he might say, there is nothing good but the good will,
but the will is good when it is directed to certain ends, that, in
themselves, are indifferent. It does not matter whether Mr A is happy or
unhappy, but I, if I am virtuous, shall act in a way which I believe
will make him happy, because that is what the moral law enjoins. I
cannot make Mr A virtuous, because his virtue depends only upon himself;
but I can do something towards making him happy, or rich, or learned, or
healthy. The Stoic ethic may therefore be stated as follows: Certain
things are vulgarly considered goods, but this is a mistake; what is
good is a will directed towards securing these false goods for other
people. This doctrine involves no logical contradiction, but it loses
all plausibility if we genuinely believe that what are commonly
considered goods are worthless, for in that case the virtuous will might
just as well be directed to quite other ends.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, an element of sour grapes in Stoicism. We can’t be
happy, but we can be good; let us therefore pretend that, so long as we
are good, it doesn’t matter being unhappy. This doctrine is heroic, and,
in a bad world, useful; but it is neither quite true nor, in a
fundamental sense, quite sincere.</p>
<p>Although the main importance of the Stoics was ethical, there were
two respects in which their teaching bore fruit in other fields. One of
these is theory of knowledge; the other is the doctrine of natural law
and natural rights.</p>
<p>In theory of knowledge, in spite of Plato, they accepted perception;
the deceptiveness of the senses, they held, was really false judgment,
and could be avoided by a little care. A Stoic philosopher, Sphaerus, an
immediate disciple of Zeno, was once invited to dinner by King Ptolemy,
who, having heard of this doctrine, offered him a pomegranate made of
wax. The philosopher proceeded to try to eat it, whereupon the king
laughed at him. He replied that he had felt no certainty of its being a
real pomegranate, but had thought it unlikely that anything inedible
would be supplied at the royal table.12 In this answer he appealed to a
Stoic distinction, between those things which can be known with
certainty on the basis of perception, and those which, on this basis,
are only probable. On the whole, this doctrine was sane and
scientific.</p>
<p>Another doctrine of theirs in theory of knowledge was more
influential, though more questionable. This was their belief in innate
ideas and principles. Greek logic was wholly deductive, and this raised
the question of first premisses. First premisses had to be, at least in
part, general, and no method existed of proving them. The Stoics held
that there are certain principles which are luminously obvious, and are
admitted by all men; these could be made, as in Euclid’s Elements, the
basis of deduction. Innate ideas, similarly,</p>
<p>could be used as the starting-point of definitions. This point of
view was accepted throughout the Middle Ages, and even by Descartes.</p>
<p>The doctrine of natural right, as it appears in the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, is a revival of a Stoic doctrine,
though with important modifications. It was the Stoics who distinguished
jus naturale from jus gentium. Natural law was derived from first
principles of the kind held to underlie all general knowledge. By
nature, the Stoics held, all human beings are equal. Marcus Aurelius, in
his Meditations, favours ‘a polity in which there is the same law for
all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom
of speech, and kingly government which respects most of all the freedom
of the governed’. This was an ideal which could not be consistently
realized in the Roman Empire, but it influenced legislation,
particularly in improving the status of women and slaves. Christianity
took over this part of Stoic teaching along with much of the rest. And
when at last, in the seventeenth century, the opportunity came to combat
despotism effectually, the Stoic doctrines of natural law and natural
equality, in their Christian dress, acquired a practical force which, in
antiquity, not even an emperor could give to them.</p>
