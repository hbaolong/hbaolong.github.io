<h4 id="aristotles-politics">21 ARISTOTLE’S POLITICS</h4>
<p>Aristotle’s Politics is both interesting and important—interesting,
as showing the common prejudices of educated Greeks in his time, and
important as a source of many principles which remained influential
until the end of the Middle Ages. I do not think there is much in it
that could be of any practical use to a statesman of the present day,
but there is a great deal that throws light on the conflicts of parties
in different parts of the Hellenic world. There is not very much
awareness of methods of government in non-Hellenic States. There are, it
is true, allusions to Egypt, Babylon, Persia, and Carthage, but except
in the case of Carthage they are somewhat perfunctory. There is no
mention of Alexander, and not even the faintest awareness of the
complete transformation that he was effecting in the world. The whole
discussion is concerned with City States, and there is no prevision of
their obsolescence. Greece, owing to its division into independent
cities, was a laboratory of political experiment; but nothing to which
these experiments were relevant existed from Aristotle’s time until the
rise of the Italian cities in the Middle Ages. In many ways, the
experience to which Aristotle appeals is more relevant to the
comparatively modern world than to any that existed for fifteen hundred
years after the book was written.</p>
<p>There are many pleasant incidental remarks, some of which may be
noted before we embark upon political theory. We are told that
Euripides, when he was staying at the court of Archelaus, King of
Macedon, was accused of halitosis by a certain Decamnichus. To soothe
his fury, the king gave him permission to scourge Decamnichus, which he
did. Decamnichus, after waiting many years, joined in a successful plot
to kill the king; but by this time Euripides was dead. We are told that
children should be conceived in winter, when the wind is in the north;
that there must be a careful avoidance of indecency, because ‘shameful
words lead to shameful acts’, and that obscenity is never to be
tolerated except in temples, where the law permits even ribaldry. People
should not marry too young, because, if they do, the children will be
weak and female, the wives will become wanton, and the husbands stunted
in their growth. The right age for marriage is thirty-seven in men,
eighteen in women.</p>
<p>We learn how Thales, being taunted with his poverty, bought up all
the olive-presses on the instalment plan, and was then able to charge
monopoly rates for their use. This he did to show that philosophers can
make money, and, if they remain poor, it is because they have something
more important than wealth to think about. All this, however, is by the
way; it is time to come to more serious matters.</p>
<p>The book begins by pointing out the importance of the State; it is
the highest kind of community, and aims at the highest good. In order of
time, the family comes first; it is built on the two fundamental
relations of man and woman, master and slave, both of which are natural.
Several families combined make a village; several villages, a State,
provided the combination is nearly large enough to be self-sufficing.
The State, though later in time than the family, is prior to it, and
even to the individual, by nature; for ‘what each thing is when fully
developed we call its nature’, and human society, fully developed, is a
State, and the whole is prior to the part. The conception involved here
is that of organism: a hand, when the body is destroyed, is, we are
told, no longer a hand. The implication is that a hand is to be defined
by its purpose—that of grasping—which it can only perform when joined to
a living body. In like manner an individual cannot fulfil his purpose
unless he is part of a State. He who founded the State, Aristotle says,
was the greatest of benefactors; for without law man is the worst of
animals, and law depends for its existence on the State. The State is
not a mere society for exchange and the prevention of crime: ‘The end of
the State is the good life…. And the State is the union of families and
villages in a perfect and self-sufficing life, by which we mean a happy
and honourable life’ (1280b). ‘A political society exists for the sake
of noble actions, not of mere companionship’ (1281a).</p>
<p>A State being composed of households, each of which consists of one
family, the discussion of politics should begin with the family. The
bulk of this discussion is concerned with slavery—for in antiquity the
slaves were always reckoned as part of the family. Slavery is expedient
and right, but the slave should be naturally inferior to the master.
From birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule; the man
who is by nature not his own but another man’s is by nature a slave.
Slaves should not be Greeks, but of an inferior race with less spirit
(1255a and 1330a). Tame animals are better off when ruled by man, and so
are those who are naturally inferior when ruled by their superiors. It
may be questioned whether the practice of making slaves out of prisoners
of war is justified; power, such as leads to victory in war, seems to
imply superior virtue, but this is not always the case. War, however, is
just when waged against men who, though intended by nature to be
governed, will not submit (1256b); and in this case, it is implied, it
would be right to make slaves of the conquered. This would seem enough
to justify any conqueror who ever lived; for no nation will admit that
it is intended by nature to be governed, and the only evidence as to
nature’s intentions must be derived from the outcome of war. In every
war, therefore, the victors are in the right and the vanquished in the
wrong. Very satisfactory!</p>
<p>Next comes a discussion of trade, which profoundly influenced
scholastic casuistry. There are two uses of a thing, one proper, the
other improper; a shoe, for instance, may be worn, which is its proper
use, or exchanged, which is its improper use. It follows that there is
something degraded about a shoemaker, who must exchange his shoes in
order to live. Retail trade, we are told, is not a natural part of the
art of getting wealth (1257a). The natural way to get wealth is by
skilful management of house and land. To the wealth that can be made in
this way there is a limit, but to what can be made by trade there is
none. Trade has to do with money, but wealth is not the acquisition of
coin. Wealth derived from trade is justly hated, because it is
unnatural. ‘The most hated sort, and with the greatest reason, is usury,
which makes a gain out of money itself, and not from the natural object
of it. For money was intended to be used in exchange, but not to
increase at interest…. Of all modes of getting wealth this is the most
unnatural’ (1258).</p>
<p>What came of this dictum you may read in Tawney’s Religion and the
Rise of Capitalism. But while his history is reliable, his comment has a
bias in favour of what is pre-capitalistic.</p>
<p>‘Usury’ means all lending money at interest, not only, as now,
lending at an exorbitant rate. From Greek times to the present day,
mankind, or at least the economically more developed portion of them,
have been divided into debtors and creditors; debtors have disapproved
of interest, and creditors have approved of it. At most times,
landowners have been debtors, while men engaged in commerce have been
creditors. The views of philosophers, with few exceptions, have
coincided with the pecuniary interests of their class. Greek
philosophers belonged to, or were employed by, the landowning class;
they therefore disapproved of interest. Medieval philosophers were
churchmen, and the property of the Church was mainly in land; they
therefore saw no reason to revise Aristotle’s opinion. Their objection
to usury was reinforced by anti-Semitism, for most fluid capital was
Jewish. Ecclesiastics and barons had their quarrels, sometimes very
bitter; but they could combine against the wicked Jew who had tided them
over a bad harvest by means of a loan, and considered that he deserved
some reward for his thrift.</p>
<p>With the Reformation, the situation changed. Many of the most earnest
Protestants were business men, to whom lending money at interest was
essential. Consequently first Calvin, and then other Protestant divines,
sanctioned interest. At last the Catholic Church was compelled to follow
suit, because the old prohibitions did not suit the modern world.
Philosophers, whose incomes are derived from the investments of
universities, have favoured interest ever since they ceased to be
ecclesiastics and therefore connected with landowning. At every stage,
there has been a wealth of theoretical argument to support the
economically convenient opinion.</p>
<p>Plato’s Utopia is criticized by Aristotle on various grounds. There
is first the very interesting comment that it gives too much unity to
the State, and would make it into an individual. Next comes the kind of
argument against the proposed abolition of the family that naturally
occurs to every reader. Plato thinks that, by merely giving the title of
‘son’ to all who are of an age that makes their sonship possible, a man
will acquire towards the whole multitude the sentiments that men have at
present towards their actual sons, and correlatively as regards the
title ‘father’. Aristotle, on the contrary, says that what is common to
the greatest number receives the least care, and that if ‘sons’ are
common to many ‘fathers’ they will be neglected in common; it is better
to be a cousin in reality than a ‘son’ in Plato’s sense; Plato’s plan
would make love watery. Then there is a curious argument that, since
abstinence from adultery is a virtue, it would be a pity to have a
social system which abolishes this virtue and the correlative vice
(1263b). Then we are asked: if women are common, who will manage the
house? I wrote an essay once, called ‘Architecture and the Social
System’, in which I pointed out that all who combine communism with
abolition of the family also advocate communal houses for large numbers,
with communal kitchens, dining-rooms, and nurseries. This system may be
described as monasteries without celibacy. It is essential to the
carrying out of Plato’s plans, but it is certainly not more impossible
than many other things that he recommends.</p>
<p>Plato’s communism annoys Aristotle. It would lead, he says, to anger
against lazy people, and to the sort of quarrels that are common between
fellow-travellers. It is better if each minds his own business. Property
should be private, but people should be so trained in benevolence as to
allow the use of it to be largely common. Benevolence and generosity are
virtues, and without private property they are impossible. Finally we
are told that, if Plato’s plans were good, someone would have thought of
them sooner.1 I do</p>
<p>not agree with Plato, but if anything could make me do so, it would
be Aristotle’s arguments against him.</p>
<p>As we have seen in connection with slavery, Aristotle is no believer
in equality. Granted, however, the subjection of slaves and women, it
still remains a question whether all citizens should be politically
equal. Some men, he says, think this desirable, on the ground that all
revolutions turn on the regulation of property. He rejects this
argument, maintaining that the greatest crimes are due to excess rather
than want; no man becomes a tyrant in order to avoid feeling the
cold.</p>
<p>A government is good when it aims at the good of the whole community,
bad when it cares only for itself. There are three kinds of government
that are good: monarchy, aristocracy, and constitutional government (or
polity); there are three that are bad: tyranny, oligarchy, and
democracy. There are also many mixed intermediate forms. It will be
observed that the good and bad governments are defined by the ethical
qualities of the holders of power, not by the form of the constitution.
This, however, is only partly true. An aristocracy is a rule of men of
virtue, an oligarchy is a rule of the rich, and Aristotle does not
consider virtue and wealth strictly synonymous. What he holds, in
accordance with the doctrine of the golden mean, is that a moderate
competence is most likely to be associated with virtue: ‘Mankind do not
acquire or preserve virtue by the help of external goods, but external
goods by the help of virtue and happiness, whether consisting in
pleasure or virtue, or both, is more often found with those who are most
highly cultivated in their mind and in their character, and have only a
moderate share of external goods, than among those who possess external
goods to a useless extent but are deficient in higher qualities’ (1323a
and b). There is therefore a difference between the rule of the best
(aristocracy) and of the richest (oligarchy), since the best are likely
to have only moderate fortunes. There is also a difference between
democracy and polity, in addition to the ethical difference in the
government, for what Aristotle calls ‘polity’ retains some oligarchic
elements (1293b). But between monarchy and tyranny the only difference
is ethical.</p>
<p>He is emphatic in distinguishing oligarchy and democracy by the
economic status of the governing party: there is oligarchy when the rich
govern without consideration for the poor, democracy when power is in
the hands of the needy and they disregard the interest of the rich.</p>
<p>Monarchy is better than aristocracy, aristocracy is better than
polity. But the corruption of the best is worst; therefore tyranny is
worse than oligarchy, and oligarchy than democracy. In this way
Aristotle arrives at a qualified defence of democracy; for most actual
governments are bad, and therefore, among actual governments,
democracies tend to be best.</p>
<p>The Greek conception of democracy was in many ways more extreme than
ours; for instance, Aristotle says that to elect magistrates is
oligarchic, while it is democratic to appoint them by lot. In extreme
democracies, the assembly of the citizens was above the law, and decided
each question independently. The Athenian law-courts were composed of a
large number of citizens chosen by lot, unaided by any jurist; they
were, of course, liable to be swayed by eloquence or party passion. When
democracy is criticized, it must be understood that this sort of thing
is meant.</p>
<p>There is a long discussion of causes of revolution. In Greece,
revolutions were as frequent as formerly in Latin America, and therefore
Aristotle had a copious experience from which to draw inferences. The
main cause was the conflict of oligarchs and democrats. Democracy,
Aristotle says, arises from the belief that men who are equally free
should be equal in all respects; oligarchy, from the fact that men who
are superior in some respect claim too much. Both have a kind of
justice, but not the best kind. ‘Therefore both parties, whenever their
share in the government does not accord with their preconceived ideas,
stir up revolution’ (1301a). Democratic governments are less liable to
revolutions than oligarchies, because oligarchs may fall out with each
other. The oligarchs seem to have been vigorous fellows. In some cities,
we are told, they swore an oath: ‘I will be an enemy to the people, and
will devise all the harm against them which I can.’ Nowadays
reactionaries are not so frank.</p>
<p>The three things needed to prevent revolution are government
propaganda in education, respect for law, even in small things, and
justice in law and administration, i.e. ‘equality according to
proportion, and for every man to enjoy his own’ (1307a, 1307b, 1310a).
Aristotle never seems to have realized the difficulty of ‘equality
according to proportion’. If this is to be true justice, the proportion
must be of virtue. Now virtue is difficult to measure, and is a matter
of party controversy. In political practice, therefore, virtue tends to
be measured by income; the distinction between aristocracy and
oligarchy, which Aristotle attempts to make, is only possible where
there is a very well-established hereditary nobility. Even then, as soon
as there exists a large class of rich men who are not noble, they have
to be admitted to power for fear of their making a revolution.
Hereditary aristocracies cannot long retain their power except where
land is almost the only source of wealth. All social inequality, in the
long run, is inequality of income. That is part of the argument for
democracy: that the attempt to have a ‘proportionate justice’ based on
any merit other than wealth is sure to break down. Defenders of
oligarchy pretend that income is proportional to virtue; the psalmist
said he had never seen a righteous man begging his bread, and Aristotle
thinks that good men acquire just about his own income, neither very
large nor very small. But such views are absurd. Every kind of ‘justice’
other than absolute equality will, in practice, reward some quality
quite other than virtue, and is therefore to be condemned.</p>
<p>There is an interesting section on tyranny. A tyrant desires riches,
whereas a king desires honour. The tyrant has guards who are
mercenaries, whereas the king has guards who are citizens. Tyrants are
mostly demagogues, who acquire power by promising to protect the people
against the notables. In an ironically Machiavellian tone, Aristotle
explains what a tyrant must do to retain power. He must prevent the rise
of any person of exceptional merit, by execution or assassination if
necessary. He must prohibit common meals, clubs, and any education
likely to produce hostile sentiment. There must be no literary
assemblies or discussions. He must prevent people from knowing each
other well, and compel them to live in public at his gates. He should
employ spies, like the female detectives at Syracuse. He must sow
quarrels, and impoverish his subjects. He should keep them occupied in
great works, as the king of Egypt did in getting the pyramids built. He
should give power to women and slaves, to make them informers. He should
make war, in order that his subjects may have something to do and be
always in want of a leader (1313a and b).</p>
<p>It is a melancholy reflection that this passage is, of the whole
book, the one most appropriate to the present day. Aristotle concludes
that there is no wickedness too great for a tyrant. There is, however,
he says, another method of preserving a tyranny, namely by moderation
and by seeming religious. There is no decision as to which method is
likely to prove the more successful.</p>
<p>There is a long argument to prove that foreign conquest is not the
end of the State, showing that many people took the imperialist view.
There is, it is true, an exception: conquest of ‘natural slaves’ is
right and just. This would, in Aristotle’s view, justify wars against
barbarians, but not against Greeks, for no Greeks are ‘natural slaves’.
In general, war is only a means, not an end; a city in an isolated
situation, where conquest is not possible, may be happy; States that
live in isolation need not be inactive. God and the universe are active,
though foreign conquest is impossible for them. The happiness that a
State should seek, therefore, though war may sometimes be a necessary
means to it, should not be war, but the activities of peace.</p>
<p>This leads to the question: how large should a State be? Large
cities, we are told, are never well governed, because a great multitude
cannot be orderly. A State ought to be large enough to be more or less
self-sufficing, but not too large for constitutional government. It
ought to be small enough for the citizens to know each other’s
characters, otherwise right will not be done in elections and law-suits.
The territory should be small enough to be surveyed in its entirety from
a hill-top. We are told both that it should be self-sufficient (1326b)
and that it should have an export and import trade (1327a), which seems
an inconsistency.</p>
<p>Men who work for their living should not be admitted to citizenship.
‘Citizens should not lead the life of mechanics or tradesmen, for such a
life is ignoble and inimical to virtue.’ Nor should they be husbandmen,
because they need leisure. The citizens should own the property, but the
husbandmen should be slaves of a different race (1330a). Northern races,
we are told, are spirited; southern races, intelligent; therefore slaves
should be of southern races, since it is inconvenient if they are
spirited. The Greeks alone are both spirited and intelligent; they are
better governed than barbarians, and if united could rule the world
(1327b). One might have expected at this point some allusion to
Alexander but there is none.</p>
<p>With regard to the size of States, Aristotle makes, on a different
scale, the same mistake that is made by many modern liberals. A State
must be able to defend itself in war, and even, if any liberal culture
is to survive, to defend itself without very great difficulty. How large
this requires a State to be, depends upon the technique of war and
industry. In Aristotle’s day, the City State was obsolete because it
could not defend itself against Macedonia. In our day, Greece as a
whole, including Macedonia, is obsolete in this sense, as has been
recently proved.2 To advocate complete independence for Greece, or any
other small country, is now as futile as to advocate complete
independence for a single city, whose territory can be seen entire from
an eminence. There can be no true independence except for a State or
alliance strong enough, by its own efforts, to repel all attempts at
foreign conquest. Nothing smaller than America and the British Empire
combined will satisfy this requirement; and perhaps even this would be
too small a unit.</p>
<p>The book, which, in the form in which we have it, appears to be
unfinished, ends with a discussion of education. Education, of course,
is only for children who are going to be citizens; slaves may be taught
useful arts, such as cooking, but these are no part of education. The
citizen should be moulded to the form of government under which he
lives, and there should therefore be differences according as the city
in question is oligarchic or democratic. In the discussion, however,
Aristotle assumes that the citizens will all have a share of political
power. Children should learn what is useful to them, but not
vulgarizing; for instance, they should not be taught any skill that
deforms the body, or that would enable them to earn money. They should
practise athletics in moderation, but not to the point of acquiring
professional skill; the boys who train for the Olympic games suffer in
health, as is shown by the fact that those who have been victors as boys
are hardly ever victors as men. Children should learn drawing, in order
to appreciate the beauty of the human form; and they should be taught to
appreciate such painting and sculpture as expresses moral ideas. They
may learn to sing and to play musical instruments enough to be able to
enjoy music critically, but not enough to be skilled performers; for no
freeman would play or sing unless</p>
<p>drunk. They must, of course, learn to read and write, in spite of the
usefulness of these arts. But the purpose of education is ‘virtue’, not
usefulness. What Aristotle means by ‘virtue’ he has told us in the
Ethics, to which this book frequently refers.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s fundamental assumptions, in his Politics, are very
different from those of any modern writer. The aim of the State, in his
view, is to produce cultured gentlemen—men who combine the aristocratic
mentality with love of learning and the arts. This combination existed,
in its highest perfection, in the Athens of Pericles, not in the
population at large, but among the well-to-do. It began to break down in
the last years of Pericles. The populace, who had no culture, turned
against the friends of Pericles who were driven to defend the privileges
of the rich, by treachery, assassination, illegal despotism, and other
such not very gentlemanly methods. After the death of Socrates, the
bigotry of the Athenian democracy diminished, and Athens remained the
centre of ancient culture, but political power went elsewhere.
Throughout later antiquity, power and culture were usually separate:
power was in the hands of rough soldiers, culture belonged to powerless
Greeks, often slaves. This is only partially true of Rome in its great
days, but it is emphatically true before Cicero and after Marcus
Aurelius. After the barbarian invasion, the ‘gentlemen’ were northern
barbarians, the men of culture subtle southern ecclesiastics. This state
of affairs continued, more or less, until the Renaissance, when the
laity began to acquire culture. From the Renaissance onwards, the Greek
conception of government by cultured gentlemen gradually prevailed more
and more, reaching its acme in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Various forces have put an end to this state of affairs. First,
democracy, as embodied in the French Revolution and its aftermath. The
cultured gentlemen, as after the age of Pericles, had to defend their
privileges against the populace, and in the process ceased to be either
gentlemen or cultured. A second cause was the rise of industrialism,
with a scientific technique very different from traditional culture. A
third cause was popular education, which conferred the power to read and
write, but did not confer culture; this enabled a new type of demagogue
to practise a new type of propaganda, as seen in the dictatorships.</p>
<p>Both for good and evil, therefore, the day of the cultured gentleman
is past.</p>
