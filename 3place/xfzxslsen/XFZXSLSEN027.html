<h4 id="early-greek-mathematics-and-astronomy">24 EARLY GREEK
MATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY</h4>
<p>I am concerned in this chapter with mathematics, not on its own
account, but as it was related to Greek philosophy—a relation which,
especially in Plato, was very close. The pre-eminence of the Greeks
appears more clearly in mathematics and astronomy than in anything else.
What they did in art, in literature, and in philosophy, may be judged
better or worse according to taste, but what they accomplished in
geometry is wholly beyond question. They derived something from Egypt,
and rather less from Babylonia; but what they obtained from these
sources was, in mathematics, mainly simple rules, and in astronomy
records of observations extended over very long periods. The art of
mathematical demonstration was, almost wholly, Greek in origin.</p>
<p>There are many pleasant stories, probably unhistorical, showing what
practical problems stimulated mathematical investigations. The earliest
and simplest relates to Thales, who, when in Egypt was asked by the king
to find out the height of a pyramid. He waited for the time of day when
his shadow was as long as he was tall; he then measured the shadow of
the pyramid, which was of course equal to its height. It is said that
the laws of perspective were first studied by the geometer Agatharcus,
in order to paint scenery for the plays of Aeschylus. The problem of
finding the distance of a ship at sea, which was said to have been
studied by Thales, was correctly solved at an early stage. One of the
great problems that occupied Greek geometers, that of the duplication of
the cube, originated, we are told, with the priests of a certain temple,
who were informed by the oracle that the god wanted a statue twice as
large as the one they had. At first they thought simply of doubling all
the dimensions of the statue, but then they realized that the result
would be eight times as large as the original, which would involve more
expense than the god had demanded. So they sent a deputation to Plato to
ask whether anybody in the Academy could solve their problem. The
geometers took it up, and worked at it for centuries, producing,
incidentally, much admirable work. The problem is, of course, that of
determining the cube root of 2.</p>
<p>The square root of 2, which was the first irrational to be
discovered, was known to the early Pythagoreans, and ingenious methods
of approximating to its value were discovered. The best was as follows:
Form two columns of numbers, which we will call the a’s and the b’s;
each starts with 1. The next a, at each stage, is formed by adding the
last a and b already obtained; the next b is formed by adding twice the
previous a to the previous b. The first 6 pairs so obtained are (1, 1),
(2, 3), (5, 7), (12, 17), (29, 41), (70, 99). In each pair, 2a2 – b2 is
1 or –1. Thus b/a is nearly the square root of two, and at each fresh
step it gets nearer. For instance, the reader may satisfy himself that
the square of 99/70 is very nearly equal to 2.</p>
<p>Pythagoras—always a rather misty figure—is described by Proclus as
the first who made geometry a liberal education. Many authorities,
including Sir Thomas Heath,1 believe that he probably discovered the
theorem that bears his name, to the effect that, in a right-angled
triangle, the square on the side opposite the right angle is equal to
the sum of the squares on the other two sides. In any case, this theorem
was known to the Pythagoreans at a very early date. They knew also that
the sum of the angles of a triangle is two right angles.</p>
<p>Irrationals other than the square root of two were studied, in
particular cases by Theodorus, a contemporary of Socrates, and in a more
general way by Theaetetus, who was roughly contemporary with Plato, but
somewhat older. Democritus wrote a treatise on irrationals, but very
little is known as to its contents. Plato was profoundly interested in
the subject; he mentions the work of Theodorus and Theaetetus in the
dialogue called after the latter. In the Laws (819–820), he says that
the general ignorance on this subject is disgraceful, and implies that
he himself began to know about it rather late in life. It had of course
an important bearing on the Pythagorean philosophy.</p>
<p>One of the most important consequences of the discovery of
irrationals was the invention of the geometrical theory of proportion by
Eudoxus (ca. 408–ca. 355 B.C.). Before him, there was only the
arithmetical theory of proportion. According to this theory, the ratio
of a to b is equal to the ratio of c to d if a times d is equal to b
times c. This definition, in the absence of an arithmetical theory of
irrationals, is only applicable to rationals. Eudoxus, however, gave a
new definition not subject to this restriction, framed in a</p>
<p>manner which suggests the methods of modern analysis. The theory is
developed in Euclid, and has great logical beauty.</p>
<p>Eudoxus also either invented or perfected the ‘method of exhaustion’,
which was subsequently used with great success by Archimedes. This
method is an anticipation of the integral calculus. Take, for example,
the question of the area of a circle. You can inscribe in a circle a
regular hexagon, or a regular dodecagon, or a regular polygon of a
thousand or a million sides. The area of such a polygon, however many
sides it has, is proportional to the square on the diameter of the
circle. The more sides the polygon has, the more nearly it becomes equal
to the circle. You can prove that, if you give the polygon enough sides,
its area can be got to differ from that of the circle by less than any
previously assigned area, however small. For this purpose, the ‘axiom of
Archimedes’ is used. This states (when somewhat simplified) that if the
greater of two quantities is halved, and then the half is halved, and so
on, a quantity will be reached, at last, which is less than the smaller
of the original two quantities. In other words, if a is greater than b,
there is some whole number n such that 2n times b is greater than a.</p>
<p>The method of exhaustion sometimes leads to an exact result, as in
squaring the parabola, which was done by Archimedes; sometimes, as in
the attempt to square the circle, it can only lead to successive
approximations. The problem of squaring the circle is the problem of
determining the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter,
which is called . Archimedes used the approximation in calculations; by
inscribing and circumscribing a regular polygon of 96 sides, he proved
that is less than and greater than . The method could be carried to any
required degree of approximation, and that is all that any method can do
in this problem. The use of inscribed and circumscribed polygons for
approximations to goes back to Antiphon, who was a contemporary of
Socrates.</p>
<p>Euclid, who was still, when I was young, the sole acknowledged
text-book of geometry for boys, lived in Alexandria, about 300 B.C., a
few years after the death of Alexander and Aristotle. Most of his
Elements was not original, but the order of propositions, and the
logical structure, were largely his. The more one studies geometry, the
more admirable these are seen to be. The treatment of parallels by means
of the famous postulate of parallels has the twofold merit of rigour in
deduction and of not concealing the dubiousness of the initial
assumption. The theory of proportion, which follows Eudoxus, avoids all
the difficulties connected with irrationals, by methods essentially
similar to those introduced by Weierstrass into nineteenth-century
analysis. Euclid then passes on to a kind of geometrical algebra, and
deals, in Book X, with the subject of irrationals. After this he
proceeds to solid geometry, ending with the construction of the regular
solids, which had been perfected by Theaetetus and assumed in Plato’s
Timaeus.</p>
<p>Euclid’s Elements is certainly one of the greatest books ever
written, and one of the most perfect monuments of the Greek intellect.
It has, of course, the typical Greek limitations: the method is purely
deductive, and there is no way, within it, of testing the initial
assumptions. These assumptions were supposed to be unquestionable, but
in the nineteenth century non-Euclidean geometry showed that they might
be in part mistaken, and that only observation could decide whether they
were so.</p>
<p>There is in Euclid the contempt for practical utility which had been
inculcated by Plato. It is said that a pupil, after listening to a
demonstration, asked what he would gain by learning geometry, whereupon
Euclid called a slave and said ‘Give the young man threepence, since he
must needs make a gain out of what he learns.’ The contempt for practice
was, however, pragmatically justified. No one, in Greek times, supposed
that conic sections had any utility; at last, in the seventeenth
century, Galileo discovered that projectiles move in parabolas, and
Kepler discovered that planets move in ellipses. Suddenly the work that
the Greeks had done from pure love of theory became the key to warfare
and astronomy.</p>
<p>The Romans were too practical-minded to appreciate Euclid; the first
of them to mention him is Cicero, in whose time there was probably no
Latin translation; indeed there is no record of any Latin translation
before Boethius (ca. A.D. 480). The Arabs were more appreciative: a copy
was given to the caliph by the Byzantine emperor about A.D. 760, and a
translation into Arabic was made under Harun al Rashid, about A.D. 800.
The first still extant Latin translation was made from the Arabic by
Adelard of Bath in A.D. 1120. From that time on, the study of geometry
gradually revived in the West; but it was not until the late Renaissance
that important advances were made.</p>
<p>I come now to astronomy, where Greek achievements were as remarkable
as in geometry. Before their time, among the Babylonians and Egyptians,
many centuries of observation had laid a foundation. The apparent
motions of the planets had been recorded, but it was not known that the
morning and evening star were the same. A cycle of eclipses had been
discovered, certainly in Babylonia and probably in Egypt, which made the
prediction of lunar eclipses fairly reliable, but not of solar eclipses,
since those were not always visible at a given spot. We owe to the
Babylonians the division of the right angle into ninety degrees, and of
the degree into sixty minutes; they had a liking for the number sixty,
and even a system of numeration based upon it. The Greeks were fond of
attributing the wisdom of their pioneers to travels in Egypt, but what
had really been achieved before the Greeks was very little. The
prediction of an eclipse by Thales was, however, an example of foreign
influence; there is no reason to suppose that he added anything to what
he learnt from Egyptian or Babylonian sources, and it was a stroke of
luck that his prediction was verified.</p>
<p>Let us begin with some of the earliest discoveries and correct
hypotheses. Anaximander thought that the earth floats freely, and is not
supported on anything. Aristotle,2 who often rejected the best
hypotheses of his time, objected to the theory of Anaximander, that the
earth, being at the centre, remained immovable because there was no
reason for moving in one direction rather than another. If this were
valid, he said, a man placed at the centre of a circle with food at
various points of the circumference would starve to death for lack of
reason to choose one portion of food rather than another. This argument
reappears in scholastic philosophy, not in connection with astronomy,
but with free will. It reappears in the form of ‘Buridan’s ass’, which
was unable to choose between two bundles of hay placed at equal
distances to right and left, and therefore died of hunger.</p>
<p>Pythagoras, in all probability, was the first to think the earth
spherical, but his reasons were (one must suppose) aesthetic rather than
scientific. Scientific reasons, however, were soon found. Anaxagoras
discovered that the moon shines by reflected light, and gave the right
theory of eclipses. He himself still thought the earth flat, but the
shape of the earth’s shadow in lunar eclipses gave the Pythagoreans
conclusive arguments in favour of its being spherical. They went
further, and regarded the earth as one of the planets. They knew—from
Pythagoras himself, it is said—that the morning star and the evening
star are identical, and they thought that all the planets, including the
earth, move in circles, not round the sun, but round the ‘central fire’.
They had discovered that the moon always turns the same face to the
earth, and they thought that the earth always turns the same face to the
‘central fire’. The Mediterranean regions were on the side turned away
from the central fire, which was therefore always invisible. The central
fire was called ‘the house of Zeus’, or ‘the Mother of the gods’. The
sun was supposed to shine by light reflected from the central fire. In
addition to the earth, there was another body, the counter-earth, at the
same distance from the central fire. For this, they had two reasons, one
scientific, one derived from their arithmetical mysticism. The
scientific reason was the correct observation that an eclipse of the
moon sometimes occurs when both sun and moon are above the horizon.
Refraction, which is the cause of this phenomenon, was unknown to them,
and they thought that, in such cases, the eclipse must be due to the
shadow of a body other than the earth. The other reason was that the sun
and moon, the five planets, the earth and counter-earth, and the central
fire, made ten heavenly bodies, and ten was the mystic number of the
Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>This Pythagorean theory is attributed to Philolaus, a Theban, who
lived at the end of the fifth century B.C. Although it is fanciful and
in part quite unscientific, it is very important, since it involves the
greater part of the</p>
<p>imaginative effort required for conceiving the Copernican hypothesis.
To conceive of the earth, not as the centre of the universe, but as one
among the planets, not as eternally fixed, but as wandering through
space, showed an extraordinary emancipation from anthropocentric
thinking. When once this jolt had been given to men’s natural picture of
the universe, it was not so very difficult to be led by scientific
arguments to a more accurate theory.</p>
<p>To this various observations contributed. Oenopides, who was slightly
later than Anaxagoras, discovered the obliquity of the ecliptic. It soon
became clear that the sun must be much larger than the earth, which fact
supported those who denied that the earth is the centre of the universe.
The central fire and the counter-earth were dropped by the Pythagoreans
soon after the time of Plato. Heraclides of Pontus (whose dates are
about 388 to 315 B.C., contemporary with Aristotle) discovered that
Venus and Mercury revolve about the sun, and adopted the view that the
earth rotates on its own axis once every twenty-four hours. This last
was a very important step, which no predecessor had taken. Heraclides
was of Plato’s school, and must have been a great man, but was not as
much respected as one would expect; he is described as a fat dandy.</p>
<p>Aristarchus of Samos, who lived approximately from 310 to 230 B.C.,
and was thus about twenty-five years older than Archimedes, is the most
interesting of all ancient astronomers, because he advanced the complete
Copernican hypothesis, that all the planets, including the earth,
revolve in circles round the sun, and that the earth, rotates on its
axis once in twenty-four hours. It is a little disappointing to find
that the only extant work of Aristarchus, On the Sizes and Distances of
the Sun and the Moon, adheres to the geocentric view. It is true that,
for the problems with which this book deals, it makes no difference
which theory is adopted, and he may therefore have thought it unwise to
burden his calculations with an unnecessary opposition to the general
opinion of astronomers; or he may have only arrived at the Copernican
hypothesis after writing this book. Sir Thomas Heath, in his work on
Aristarchus,3 which contains the text of this book with a translation,
inclines to the latter view. The evidence that Aristarchus suggested the
Copernican view is, in any case, quite conclusive.</p>
<p>The first and best evidence is that of Archimedes, who, as we have
seen, was a younger contemporary of Aristarchus. Writing to Gelon, King
of Syracuse, he says that Aristarchus brought out ‘a book consisting of
certain hypotheses’, and continues: ‘His hypotheses are that the fixed
stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth revolves about the sun
in the circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the
orbit.’ There is a passage</p>
<p>in Plutarch saying that Cleanthes ‘thought it was the duty of the
Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for
putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe (i.e. the earth), this
being the effect of his attempt to save the phenomena by supposing the
heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle,
while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis’. Cleanthes was a
contemporary of Aristarchus, and died about 232 B.C. In another passage,
Plutarch says that Aristarchus advanced this view only as a hypothesis,
but that his successor Seleucus maintained it as a definite opinion.
(Seleucus flourished about 150 B.C.) Aëtius and Sextus Empiricus also
assert that Aristarchus advanced the heliocentric hypothesis, but do not
say that it was set forth by him only as a hypothesis. Even if he did
so, it seems not unlikely that he, like Galileo two thousand years
later, was influenced by the fear of offending religious prejudices, a
fear which the attitude of Cleanthes (mentioned above) shows to have
been well grounded.</p>
<p>The Copernican hypothesis, after being advanced, whether positively
or tentatively, by Aristarchus, was definitely adopted by Seleucus, but
by no other ancient astronomer. This general rejection was mainly due to
Hipparchus, who flourished from 161 to 126 B.C. He is described by Heath
as ‘the greatest astronomer of antiquity’.4 He was the first to write
systematically on trigonometry; he discovered the precession of the
equinoxes; he estimated the length of the lunar month with an error of
less than one second; he improved Aristarchus’s estimates of the sizes
and distances of the sun and moon; he made a catalogue of eight hundred
and fifty fixed stars, giving their latitude and longitude. As against
the heliocentric hypothesis of Aristarchus, he adopted and improved the
theory of epicycles which had been invented by Apollonius, who
flourished about 220 B.C.; it was a development of this theory that came
to be known, later, as the Ptolemaic system, after the astronomer
Ptolemy, who flourished in the middle of the second century A.D.</p>
<p>Copernicus perhaps came to know something, though not much, of the
almost forgotten hypothesis of Aristarchus, and was encouraged by
finding ancient authority for his innovation. Otherwise, the effect of
this hypothesis on subsequent astronomy was practically nil.</p>
<p>Ancient astronomers, in estimating the sizes of the earth, moon, and
sun, and the distances of the moon and sun, used methods which were
theoretically valid, but they were hampered by the lack of instruments
of precision. Many of their results, in view of this lack, were
surprisingly good. Eratosthenes estimated the earth’s diameter at 7,850
miles, which is only about fifty miles short of the truth. Ptolemy
estimated the mean distance of</p>
<p>the moon at 29 1/2 times the earth’s diameter; the correct figure is
about 30.2. None of them got anywhere near the size and distance of the
sun, which all under-estimated. Their estimates, in terms of the earth’s
diameter, were:</p>
<p>Aristarchus, 180;</p>
<p>Hipparchus, 1,245;</p>
<p>Posidonius, 6,545.</p>
<p>The correct figure is 11,726. It will be seen that these estimates
continually improved (that of Ptolemy, however, showed a retrogression);
that of Posidonius5 is about half the correct figure. On the whole,
their picture of the solar system was not so very far from the
truth.</p>
<p>Greek astronomy was geometrical, not dynamic. The ancients thought of
the motions of the heavenly bodies as uniform and circular, or
compounded of circular motions. They had not the conception of force.
There were spheres which moved as a whole, and on which the various
heavenly bodies were fixed. With Newton and gravitation a new point of
view, less geometrical, was introduced. It is curious to observe that
there is a reversion to the geometrical point of view in Einstein’s
General Theory of Relativity, from which the conception of force, in the
Newtonian sense, has been banished.</p>
<p>The problem for the astronomer is this: given the apparent motions of
the heavenly bodies on the celestial sphere, to introduce, by
hypothesis, a third co-ordinate, depth, in such a way as to make the
description of the phenomena as simple as possible. The merit of the
Copernican hypothesis is not truth, but simplicity; in view of the
relativity of motion, no question of truth is involved. The Greeks, in
their search for hypotheses which would ‘save the phenomena’, were in
effect, though not altogether in intention, tackling the problem in the
scientifically correct way. A comparison with their predecessors, and
with their successors until Copernicus, must convince every student of
their truly astonishing genius.</p>
<p>Two very great men, Archimedes and Apollonius, in the third century
B.C., complete the list of first-class Greek mathematicians. Archimedes
was a friend, probably a cousin, of the king of Syracuse, and was killed
when that city was captured by the Romans in 212 B.C. Apollonius, from
his youth, lived at Alexandria. Archimedes was not only a mathematician,
but also a physicist and student of hydrostatics. Apollonius is chiefly
noted for his work on conic sections. I shall say no more about them, as
they came too late to influence philosophy.</p>
<p>After these two men, though respectable work continued to be done in
Alexandria, the great age was ended. Under the Roman domination, the
Greeks lost the self-confidence that belongs to political liberty, and
in losing it acquired a paralysing respect for their predecessors. The
Roman soldier who killed Archimedes was a symbol of the death of
