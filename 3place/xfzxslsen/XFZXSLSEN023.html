<h4 id="aristotles-ethics">20 ARISTOTLE’S ETHICS</h4>
<p>In the corpus of Aristotle’s works, three treatises on ethics have a
place, but two of these are now generally held to be by disciples. The
third, the Nicomachean Ethics, remains for the most part unquestioned as
to authenticity, but even in this book there is a portion (Books V, VI,
and VII) which is held by many to have been incorporated from one of the
works of disciples. I shall, however, ignore this controversial
question, and treat the book as a whole and as Aristotle’s.</p>
<p>The views of Aristotle on ethics represent, in the main, the
prevailing opinions of educated and experienced men of his day. They are
not, like Plato’s, impregnated with mystical religion; nor do they
countenance such unorthodox theories as are to be found in the Republic
concerning property and the family. Those who neither fall below nor
rise above the level of decent, well-behaved citizens will find in the
Ethics a systematic account of the principles by which they hold that
their conduct should be regulated. Those who demand anything more will
be disappointed. The book appeals to the respectable middle-aged, and
has been used by them, especially since the seventeenth century, to
repress the ardours and enthusiasms of the young. But to a man with any
depth of feeling it is likely to be repulsive.</p>
<p>The good, we are told, is happiness, which is an activity of the
soul. Aristotle says that Plato was right in dividing the soul into two
parts, one rational, the other irrational. The irrational part itself he
divides into the vegetative (which is found even in plants) and the
appetitive (which is found in all animals). The appetitive part may be
in some degree rational, when the goods that it seeks are such as reason
approves of. This is essential to the account of virtue, for reason
alone, in Aristotle, is purely contemplative, and does not, without the
help of appetite, lead to any practical activity.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of virtues, intellectual and moral, corresponding
to the two parts of the soul. Intellectual virtues result from teaching,
moral virtues from habit. It is the business of the legislator to make
the citizens good by forming good habits. We become just by performing
just acts, and similarly as regards other virtues. By being compelled to
acquire good habits, we shall in time, Aristotle thinks, come to find
pleasure in performing good actions. One is reminded of Hamlet’s speech
to his mother:</p>
<p>Assume a virtue if you have it not.</p>
<p>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,</p>
<p>Of habits devil, is angel, yet in this</p>
<p>That to the use of actions fair and good</p>
<p>He likewise gives a frock or livery</p>
<p>That aptly is put on.</p>
<p>We now come to the famous doctrine of the golden mean. Every virtue
is a mean between two extremes, each of which is a vice. This is proved
by an examination of the various virtues. Courage is a mean between
cowardice and rashness; liberality, between prodigality and meanness;
proper pride, between vanity and humility; ready wit, between buffoonery
and boorishness; modesty, between bashfulness and shamelessness. Some
virtues do not seem to fit into this scheme; for instance, truthfulness.
Aristotle says that this is a mean between boastfulness and mock-modesty
(1108a), but this only applies to truthfulness about oneself. I do not
see how truthfulness in any wider sense can be fitted into the scheme.
There was once a mayor who had adopted Aristotle’s doctrine; at the end
of his term of office he made a speech saying that he had endeavoured to
steer the narrow line between partiality on the one hand and
impartiality on the other. The view of truthfulness as a mean seems
scarcely less absurd.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s opinions on moral questions are always such as were
conventional in his day. On some points they differ from those of our
time, chiefly where some form of aristocracy comes in. We think that
human beings, at least in ethical theory, all have equal rights, and
that justice involves equality; Aristotle thinks that justice involves,
not equality, but right proportion, which is only sometimes equality
(1131b).</p>
<p>The justice of a master or a father is a different thing from that of
a citizen, for a son or slave is property, and there can be no injustice
to one’s own property (1134b). As regards slaves, however, there is a
slight modification of this doctrine in connection with the question
whether it is possible for a man to be a friend of his slave: ‘There is
nothing in common between the two parties; the slave is a living tool …
Qua slave, then, one cannot be friends with him. But qua man one can;
for there seems to be some justice between any man and any other who can
share in a system of law or be a party to an agreement; therefore there
can also be friendship with him in so far as he is a man’ (1161b).</p>
<p>A father can repudiate his son if he is wicked, but a son cannot
repudiate his father, because he owes him more than he can possibly
repay, especially existence (1163b). In unequal relations, it is right,
since everybody should be loved in proportion to his worth, that the
inferior should love the superior more than the superior loves the
inferior: wives, children, subjects, should have more love for husbands,
parents, and monarchs than the latter have for them. In a good marriage,
‘the man rules in accordance with his worth, and in those matters in
which a man should rule, but the matters that befit a woman he hands
over to her’ (1160b). He should not rule in her province; still less
should she rule in his, as sometimes happens when she is an heiress.</p>
<p>The best individual, as conceived by Aristotle, is a very different
person from the Christian saint. He should have proper pride, and not
underestimate his own merits. He should despise whoever deserves to be
despised (1124b). The description of the proud or magnanimous man1 is
very interesting as showing the difference between pagan and Christian
ethics, and the sense in which Nietzsche was justified in regarding
Christianity as a slave-morality.</p>
<p>The magnanimous man, since he deserves most, must be good, in the
highest degree; for the better man always deserves more, and the best
man most. Therefore the truly magnanimous man must be good. And
greatness in every virtue would seem to be characteristic of the
magnanimous man. And it would be most unbecoming for the magnanimous man
to fly from danger, swinging his arms by his sides, or to wrong another;
for to what end should he do disgraceful acts, he to whom nothing is
great? … magnanimity, then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues;
for it makes them greater, and it is not found without them. Therefore
it is hard to be truly magnanimous; for it is impossible without
nobility and goodness of character. It is chiefly with honours and
dishonours, then, that the magnanimous man is concerned; and at honours
that are great and conferred by good men he will be moderately pleased,
thinking that he is coming by his own or even less than his own; for
there can be no honour that is worthy of perfect virtue, yet he will at
any rate accept it since they have nothing greater to bestow on him; but
honour from casual people and on trifling grounds he will utterly
despise, since it is not this that he deserves, and dishonour too, since
in his case it</p>
<p>cannot be just…. Power and wealth are desirable for the sake of
honour; and to him for whom even honour is a little thing the others
must be so too. Hence magnanimous men are thought to be disdainful … The
magnanimous man does not run into trifling dangers, … but he will face
great dangers, and when he is in danger he is unsparing of his life,
knowing that there are conditions on which life is not worth having. And
he is the sort of man to confer benefits, but he is ashamed of receiving
them; for the one is the mark of a superior, the other of an inferior.
And he is apt to confer greater benefits in return; for thus the
original benefactor besides being repaid will incur a debt to him…. It
is the mark of the magnanimous man to ask for nothing or scarcely
anything, but to give help readily, and to be dignified towards people
who enjoy a high position but unassuming towards those of the middle
class; for it is a difficult and lofty thing to be superior to the
former, but easy to be so to the latter, and a lofty bearing over the
former is no mark of ill-breeding, but among humble people it is as
vulgar as a display of strength against the weak…. He must also be open
in his hate and in his love, for to conceal one’s feelings, i.e. to care
less for truth than for what people think, is a coward’s part…. He is
free of speech because he is contemptuous, and he is given to telling
the truth, except when he speaks in irony to the vulgar…. Nor is he
given to admiration, for to him nothing is great…. Nor is he a gossip;
for he will speak neither about himself nor about another, since he
cares not to be praised nor for others to be blamed…. He is one who will
possess beautiful and profitless things rather than profitable and
useful ones…. Further, a slow step is thought proper to the magnanimous
man, a deep voice, and a level utterance…. Such, then, is the
magnanimous man; the man who falls short of him is unduly humble, and
the man who goes beyond him is vain’ (1123b–1125a).</p>
<p>One shudders to think what a vain man would be like.</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of the magnanimous man, one thing is clear:
there cannot be very many of him in a community. I do not mean merely in
the general sense in which there are not likely to be many virtuous men,
on the ground that virtue is difficult; what I mean is that the virtues
of the magnanimous man largely depend upon his having an exceptional
social position. Aristotle considers ethics a branch of politics, and it
is not surprising, after his praise of pride, to find that he considers
monarchy the best form of government, and aristocracy the next best.
Monarchs and aristocrats can be ‘magnanimous’, but ordinary citizens
would be laughable if they attempted to live up to such a pattern.</p>
<p>This brings up a question which is half ethical, half political. Can
we regard as morally satisfactory a community which, by its essential
constitution, confines the best things to a few, and requires the
majority to be content with the second-best? Plato and Aristotle say
yes, and Nietzsche agrees with them. Stoics, Christians, and democrats
say no. But there are great differences in their ways of saying no.
Stoics and early Christians consider that the greatest good is virtue,
and that external circumstances cannot prevent a man from being
virtuous; there is therefore no need to seek a just social system, since
social injustice affects only unimportant matters. The democrat, on the
contrary, usually holds that, at least so far as politics are concerned,
the most important goods are power and property; he cannot, therefore,
acquiesce in a social system which is unjust in these respects.</p>
<p>The Stoic-Christian view requires a conception of virtue very
different from Aristotle’s, since it must hold that virtue is as
possible for the slave as for his master. Christian ethics disapproves
of pride, which Aristotle thinks a virtue, and praises humility, which
he thinks a vice. The intellectual virtues, which Plato and Aristotle
value above all others, have to be thrust out of the list altogether, in
order that the poor and humble may be able to be as virtuous as any one
else. Pope Gregory the Great solemnly reproved a bishop for teaching
grammar.</p>
<p>The Aristotelian view, that the highest virtue is for the few, is
logically connected with the subordination of ethics to politics. If the
aim is the good community rather than the good individual, it is
possible that the good community may be one in which there is
subordination. In an orchestra, the first violin is more important than
the oboe, though both are necessary for the excellence of the whole. It
is impossible to organize an orchestra on the principle of giving to
each man what would be best for him as an isolated individual. The same
sort of thing applies to the government of a large modern State, however
democratic. A modern democracy—unlike those of antiquity—confers great
power upon certain chosen individuals, Presidents or Prime Ministers,
and must expect of them kinds of merit which are not expected of the
ordinary citizen. When people are not thinking in terms of religion or
political controversy, they are likely to hold that a good President is
more to be honoured than a good bricklayer. In a democracy a President
is not expected to be quite like Aristotle’s magnanimous man, but still
he is expected to be rather different from the average citizen, and to
have certain merits connected with his station. These peculiar merits
would perhaps not be considered ‘ethical’, but that is because we use
this adjective in a narrower sense than that in which it is used by
Aristotle.</p>
<p>As a result of Christian dogma, the distinction between moral and
other merits has become much sharper than it was in Greek times. It is a
merit in a man to be a great poet or composer or painter, but not a
moral merit; we do not consider him the more virtuous for possessing
such aptitudes, or the more likely to go to heaven. Moral merit is
concerned solely with acts of will, i.e. with choosing rightly among
possible courses of action.2 I am not to blame for not composing an
opera, because I don’t know how to do it. The orthodox view is that,
wherever two courses of action are possible, conscience tells me which
is right, and to choose the other is sin. Virtue consists mainly in the
avoidance of sin, rather than in anything positive. There is no reason
to expect an educated man to be morally better than an uneducated man,
or a clever man than a stupid man. In this way, a number of merits of
great social importance are shut out from the realm of ethics. The
adjective ‘unethical’, in modern usage, has a much narrower range than
the adjective ‘undesirable’. It is undesirable to be feeble-minded, but
not unethical.</p>
<p>Many modern philosophers, however, have not accepted this view of
ethics. They have thought that one should first define the good, and
then say that our actions ought to be such as tend to realize the good.
This point of view is more like that of Aristotle, who holds that
happiness is the good. The highest happiness, it is true, is only open
to the philosopher, but to Aristotle that is no objection to the
theory.</p>
<p>Ethical theories may be divided into two classes, according as they
regard virtue as an end or a means. Aristotle, on the whole, takes the
view that virtues are means to an end, namely happiness. ‘The end, then,
being what we wish for, the means what we deliberate about and choose,
actions concerning means must be according to choice and voluntary. Now
the exercise of the virtues is concerned with means’ (1113b). But there
is another sense of virtue in which it is included in the ends of action
: ‘Human good is activity of soul in accordance with virtue in a
complete life’ (1098a). I think he would say that the intellectual
virtues are ends, but the practical virtues are only means. Christian
moralists hold that, while the consequences of virtuous actions are in
general good, they are not as good as the virtuous actions themselves,
which are to be valued on their own account, and not on account of their
effects. On the other hand, those who consider pleasure the good regard
virtues solely as means. Any other definition of the good, except the
definition as virtue, will have the same consequence, that virtues are
means to goods other than themselves. On this question, Aristotle, as
already said, agrees mainly, though not wholly, with those who think the
first business of ethics is to define the good, and that virtue is to be
defined as action tending to produce the good.</p>
<p>The relation of ethics to politics raises another ethical question of
considerable importance. Granted that the good at which right action
should aim is the good of the whole community, or, ultimately, of the
whole human race, is this social good a sum of goods enjoyed by
individuals, or is it</p>
<p>something belonging essentially to the whole, not to the parts? We
may illustrate the problem by the analogy of the human body. Pleasures
are largely associated with different parts of the body, but we consider
them as belonging to a person as a whole; we may enjoy a pleasant smell,
but we know that the nose alone could not enjoy it. Some contend that,
in a closely organized community, there are, analogously, excellences
belonging to the whole, but not to any part. If they are metaphysicians,
they may hold, like Hegel, that whatever quality is good is an attribute
of the universe as a whole; but they will generally add that it is less
mistaken to attribute good to a State than to an individual. Logically,
the view may be put as follows. We can attribute to a State various
predicates that cannot be attributed to its separate members—that it is
populous, extensive, powerful, etc. The view we are considering puts
ethical predicates in this class, and says that they only derivatively
belong to individuals. A man may belong to a populous State, or to a
good State; but he, they say, is no more good than he is populous. This
view, which has been widely held by German philosophers, is not
Aristotle’s, except possibly, in some degree, in his conception of
justice.</p>
<p>A considerable part of the Ethics is occupied with the discussion of
friendship, including all relations that involve affection. Perfect
friendship is only possible between the good, and it is impossible to be
friends with many people. One should not be friends with a person of
higher station than one’s own, unless he is also of higher virtue, which
will justify the respect shown to him. We have seen that, in unequal
relations, such as those of man and wife or father and son, the superior
should be the more loved. It is impossible to be friends with God,
because He cannot love us. Aristotle discusses whether a man can be a
friend to himself, and decides that this is only possible if he is a
good man; wicked men, he asserts, often hate themselves. The good man
should love himself, but nobly (1169a). Friends are a comfort in
misfortune, but one should not make them unhappy by seeking their
sympathy, as is done by women and womanish men (1171b). It is not only
in misfortune that friends are desirable, for the happy man needs
friends with whom to share his happiness. ‘No one would choose the whole
world on condition of being alone, since man is a political creature and
one whose nature is to live with others’ (1169b). All that is said about
friendship is sensible, but there is not a word that rises above common
sense.</p>
<p>Aristotle again shows his good sense in the discussion of pleasure,
which Plato had regarded somewhat ascetically. Pleasure, as Aristotle
uses the word, is distinct from happiness, though there can be no
happiness without pleasure. There are, he says, three views of pleasure:
(1) that it is never good; (2) that some pleasure is good, but most is
bad; (3) that pleasure is good, but not the best. He rejects the first
of these on the ground that pain is certainly bad, and therefore
pleasure must be good. He says, very justly, that it is nonsense to say
a man can be happy on the rack: some degree of external good fortune is
necessary for happiness. He also disposes of the view that all pleasures
are bodily; all things have something divine, and therefore some
capacity for higher pleasures. Good men have pleasure unless they are
unfortunate, and God always enjoys a single and simple pleasure
(1152–1154).</p>
<p>There is another discussion of pleasure, in a later part of the book,
which is not wholly consistent with the above. Here it is argued that
there are bad pleasures, which, however, are not pleasures to good
people (1173b); that perhaps pleasures differ in kind (ibid.); and that
pleasures are good or bad according as they are connected with good or
bad activities (1175b). There are things that are valued more than
pleasure; no one would be content to go through life with a child’s
intellect, even if it were pleasant to do so. Each animal has its proper
pleasure, and the proper pleasure of man is connected with reason.</p>
<p>This leads on to the only doctrine in the book which is not mere
common sense. Happiness lies in virtuous activity, and perfect happiness
lies in the best activity, which is contemplative. Contemplation is
preferable to war or politics or any other practical career, because it
allows leisure, and leisure is essential to happiness. Practical virtue
brings only a secondary kind of happiness; the supreme happiness is in
the exercise of reason, for reason, more than anything else, is man. Man
cannot be wholly contemplative, but in so far as he is so he shares in
the divine life. ‘The activity of God, which surpasses all others in
blessedness, must be contemplative.’ Of all human beings, the
philosopher is the most godlike in his activity, and therefore the
happiest and best:</p>
<p>He who exercises his reason and cultivates it seems to be both in the
best state of mind and most dear to the gods. For if the gods have any
care for human affairs, as they are thought to have, it would be
reasonable both that they should delight in that which was best and most
akin to them (i.e. reason) and that they should reward those who love
and honour this most, as caring for the things that are dear to them and
acting both rightly and nobly. And that all these attributes belong most
of all to the philosopher is manifest. He, therefore, is the dearest to
the gods. And he who is that will presumably be also the happiest; so
that in this way too the philosopher will more than any other be happy
(1179a).</p>
<p>This passage is virtually the peroration of the Ethics; the few
paragraphs that follow are concerned with the transition to
politics.</p>
<p>Let us now try to decide what we are to think of the merits and
demerits of the Ethics. Unlike many other subjects treated by Greek
philosophers, ethics has not made any definite advances, in the sense of
ascertained discoveries; nothing in ethics is known in a scientific
sense. There is therefore no reason why an ancient treatise on it should
be in any respect inferior to a modern one. When Aristotle talks about
astronomy, we can say definitely that he is wrong; but when he talks
about ethics we cannot say, in the same sense, either that he is wrong
or that he is right. Broadly speaking, there are three questions that we
can ask about the ethics of Aristotle, or of any other philosopher: (1)
Is it internally self-consistent? (2) Is it consistent with the
remainder of the author’s views? (3) Does it give answers to ethical
problems that are consonant to our own ethical feelings? If the answer
to either the first or second question is in the negative, the
philosopher in question has been guilty of some intellectual error. But
if the answer to the third question is in the negative, we have no right
to say that he is mistaken; we have only the right to say that we do not
like him.</p>
<p>Let us examine these three questions in turn, as regards the ethical
theory set forth in the Nicomachean Ethics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On the whole, the book is self-consistent, except in a few not
very important respects. The doctrine that the good is happiness, and
that happiness consists in successful activity, is well worked out. The
doctrine that every virtue is a mean between two extremes, though very
ingeniously developed, is less successful, since it does not apply to
intellectual contemplation, which, we are told, is the best of all
activities. It can, however, be maintained that the doctrine of the mean
is only intended to apply to the practical virtues, not to those of the
intellect. Perhaps, to take another point, the position of the
legislator is somewhat ambiguous. He is to cause children and young
people to acquire the habit of performing good actions, which will, in
the end, lead them to find pleasure in virtue, and to act virtuously
without the need of legal compulsion. It is obvious that the legislator
might equally well cause the young to acquire bad habits; if this is to
be avoided, he must have all the wisdom of a Platonic guardian; and if
it is not avoided, the argument that a virtuous life is pleasant will
fail. This problem, however, belongs perhaps more to politics than to
ethics.</p></li>
<li><p>Aristotle’s ethics is, at all points, consistent with his
metaphysics. Indeed, his metaphysical theories are themselves the
expression of an ethical optimism. He believes in the scientific
importance of final causes, and this implies the belief that purpose
governs the course of development in the universe. He thinks that
changes are, in the main, such as embody an increase of organization or
‘form’, and at bottom virtuous actions are those that favour this
tendency. It is true that a great deal of his practical ethics is not
particularly philosophical, but merely the result of observation of
human affairs; but this part of his doctrine, though it may be
independent of his metaphysics, is not inconsistent with it.</p></li>
<li><p>When we come to compare Aristotle’s ethical tastes with our own,
we find, in the first place, as already noted, an acceptance of
inequality which is repugnant to much modern sentiment. Not only is
there no objection to slavery, or to the superiority of husbands and
fathers over wives and children, but it is held that what is best is
essentially only for the few—magnanimous men and philosophers. Most men,
it would seem to follow, are mainly means for the production of a few
rulers and sages. Kant maintained that every human being is an end in
himself, and this may be taken as an expression of the view introduced
by Christianity. There is, however, a logical difficulty in Kant’s view,
since it gives no means of reaching a decision when two men’s interests
clash. If each is an end in himself, how are we to arrive at a principle
for determining which shall give way? Such a principle must have to do
with the community rather than with the individual. In the broadest
sense of the word, it will have to be a principle of ‘justice’. Bentham
and the utilitarians interpret ‘justice’ as ‘equality’: when two men’s
interests clash, the right course is that which produces the greatest
total of happiness, regardless of which of the two enjoys it, or how it
is shared among them. If more is given to the better man than to the
worse, that is because, in the long run, the general happiness is
increased by rewarding virtue and punishing vice, not because of an
ultimate ethical doctrine that the good deserve more than the bad.
‘Justice’, in this view, consists in considering only the amount of
happiness involved, without favour to one individual or class as against
another. Greek philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle, had a
different conception of justice, and it is one which is still widely
prevalent. They thought—originally on grounds derived from religion—that
each thing or person had its or his proper sphere, to overstep which is
‘unjust’. Some men, in virtue of their character and aptitudes, have a
wider sphere than others, and there is no injustice if they enjoy a
greater share of happiness. This view is taken for granted in Aristotle,
but its basis in primitive religion, which is evident in the earliest
philosophers, is no longer apparent in his writings.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is in Aristotle an almost complete absence of what may be
called benevolence or philanthropy. The sufferings of mankind, in so far
as he is aware of them, do not move him emotionally; he holds them,
intellectually, to be an evil, but there is no evidence that they cause
him unhappiness except when the sufferers happen to be his friends.</p>
<p>More generally, there is an emotional poverty in the Ethics, which is
not found in the earlier philosophers. There is something unduly smug
and comfortable about Aristotle’s speculations on human affairs;
everything that makes men feel a passionate interest in each other seems
to be forgotten. Even his account of friendship is tepid. He shows no
sign of having had any of those experiences which make it difficult to
preserve sanity; all the more profound aspects of the moral life are
apparently unknown to him. He leaves out, one may say, the whole sphere
of human experience with which religion is concerned. What he has to say
is what will be useful to comfortable men of weak passions; but he has
nothing to say to those who are possessed by a god or a devil, or whom
outward misfortune drives to despair. For these reasons, in my judgment,
his Ethics, in spite of its fame, is lacking in intrinsic
importance.</p>
