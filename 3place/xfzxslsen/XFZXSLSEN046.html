<h4 id="st-thomas-aquinas">13 ST THOMAS AQUINAS</h4>
<p>Thomas Aquinas (b. 1225 or 1226, d. 1274) is regarded as the greatest
of scholastic philosophers. In all Catholic educational institutions
that teach philosophy his system has to be taught as the only right one;
this has been the rule since a rescript of 1879 by Leo XIII. St Thomas,
therefore, is not only of historical interest, but is a living
influence, like Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel—more, in fact, than
the latter two. In most respects, he follows Aristotle so closely that
the Stagyrite has, among Catholics, almost the authority of one of the
Fathers; to criticize him in matters of pure philosophy has come to be
thought almost impious.1 This was not always the case. In the time of
Aquinas, the battle for Aristotle, as against Plato, still had to be
fought. The influence of Aquinas secured the victory until the
Renaissance; then Plato, who became better known than in the Middle
Ages, again acquired supremacy in the opinion of most philosophers. In
the seventeenth century, it was possible to be orthodox and a Cartesian;
Malebranche, though a priest, was never censured. But in our day such
freedoms are a thing of the past; Catholic ecclesiastics must accept St
Thomas if they concern themselves with philosophy.</p>
<p>St Thomas was the son of the Count of Aquino, whose castle, in the
kingdom of Naples, was close to Monte Cassino, where the education of
the ‘angelic doctor’ began. He was for six years at Frederick II’s
university of Naples; then he became a Dominican and went to Cologne, to
study under Albertus Magnus, who was the leading Aristotelian among the
philosophers of the time. After a period in Cologne and Paris, he
returned to Italy in 1259, where he spent the rest of his life except
for the three years 1269–72. During these three years he was in Paris,
where the Dominicans, on account of their</p>
<p>Aristotelianism, were in trouble with the university authorities, and
were suspected of heretical sympathy with the Averroists, who had a
powerful party in the university. The Averroists held, on the basis of
their interpretation of Aristotle, that the soul, in so far as it is
individual, is not immortal; immortality belongs only to the intellect,
which is impersonal, and identical in different intellectual beings.
When it was forcibly brought to their notice that this doctrine is
contrary to the Catholic faith, they took refuge in the subterfuge of
‘double truth’; one sort, based on reason, in philosophy, and another,
based on revelation, in theology. All this brought Aristotle into bad
odour, and St Thomas, in Paris, was concerned to undo the harm done by
too close adherence to Arabian doctrines. In this he was singularly
successful.</p>
<p>Aquinas, unlike his predecessors, had a really competent knowledge of
Aristotle. His friend William of Moerbeke provided him with translations
from the Greek, and he himself wrote commentaries. Until his time, men’s
notions of Aristotle had been obscured by Neoplatonic accretions. He,
however, followed the genuine Aristotle, and disliked Platonism, even as
it appears in St Augustine. He succeeded in persuading the Church that
Aristotle’s system was to be preferred to Plato’s as the basis of
Christian philosophy, and that Mohammedans and Christian Averroists had
misinterpreted Aristotle. For my part, I should say that the De Anima
leads much more naturally to the view of Averroes than to that of
Aquinas; however, the Church, since St Thomas, has thought otherwise. I
should say, further, that Aristotle’s views on most questions of logic
and philosophy were not final, and have since been proved to be largely
erroneous; this opinion, also, is not allowed to be professed by any
Catholic philosopher or teacher of philosophy.</p>
<p>St Thomas’s most important work, the Summa contra Gentiles, was
written during the years 1259–64. It is concerned to establish the truth
of the Christian religion by arguments addressed to a reader supposed to
be not already a Christian; one gathers that the imaginary reader is
usually thought of as a man versed in the philosophy of the Arabs. He
wrote another book, Summa Theologiae, of almost equal importance, but of
somewhat less interest to us because less designed to use arguments not
assuming in advance the truth of Christianity.</p>
<p>What follows is an abstract of the Summa contra Gentiles.</p>
<p>Let us first consider what is meant by ‘wisdom’. A man may be wise in
some particular pursuit, such as making houses; this implies that he
knows the means to some particular end. But all particular ends are
subordinate to the end of the universe, and wisdom per se is concerned
with the end of the universe. Now the end of the universe is the good of
the intellect, i.e. truth. The pursuit of wisdom in this sense is the
most perfect, sublime, profitable, and delightful of pursuits. All this
is proved by appeal to the authority of the ‘The Philosopher’,
i.e. Aristotle.</p>
<p>My purpose (he says) is to declare the truth which the Catholic Faith
professes. But here I must have recourse to natural reason, since the
gentiles do not accept the authority of Scripture. Natural reason,
however, is deficient in the things of God; it can prove some parts of
the faith, but not others. It can prove the existence of God and the
immortality of the soul, but not the Trinity, the Incarnation, or the
Last Judgment. Whatever is demonstrable is, so far as it goes, in
accordance with the Christian faith, and nothing in revelation is
contrary to reason. But it is important to separate the parts of the
faith which can be proved by reason from those which cannot.
Accordingly, of the four books into which the Summa is divided, the
first three make no appeal to revelation, except to show that it is in
accordance with conclusions reached by reason; only in the fourth book
are matters treated which cannot be known apart from revelation.</p>
<p>The first step is to prove the existence of God. Some think this
unnecessary, since the existence of God (they say) is self-evident. If
we knew God’s essence, this would be true, since (as is proved later) in
God, essence and existence are one. But we do not know His essence,
except very imperfectly. Wise men know more of His essence than do the
ignorant, and angels know more than either; but no creature knows enough
of it to be able to deduce God’s existence from His essence. On this
ground, the ontological argument is rejected.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that religious truths which can be proved
can also be known by faith. The proofs are difficult, and can only be
understood by the learned; but faith is necessary also to the ignorant,
to the young, and to those who, from practical preoccupations, have not
the leisure to learn philosophy. For them, revelation suffices.</p>
<p>Some say that God is only knowable by faith. They argue that, if the
principles of demonstration became known to us through experience
derived from the senses, as is said in the Posterior Analytics, whatever
transcends sense cannot be proved. This, however, is false; and even if
it were true, God could be known from His sensible effects.</p>
<p>The existence of God is proved, as in Aristotle, by the argument of
the unmoved mover.2 There are things which are only moved, and other
things which both move and are moved. Whatever is moved is moved by
something, and, since an endless regress is impossible, we must arrive
somewhere at something which moves other things without being moved.
This unmoved mover is God. It might be objected that this argument
involves the eternity of movement, which Catholics reject. This would be
an error: it is valid on the hypothesis of the eternity of movement, but
is only strengthened by the opposite hypothesis, which involves a
beginning, and therefore a First Cause.</p>
<p>In the Summa Theologiae, five proofs of God’s existence are given.
First, the argument of the unmoved mover, as above. Second, the argument
of the First Cause, which again depends upon the impossibility of an
infinite regress. Third, that there must be an ultimate source of all
necessity; this is much the same as the second argument. Fourth, that we
find various perfections in the world, and that these must have their
source in something completely perfect. Fifth, that we find even
lifeless things serving a purpose, which must be that of some being
outside them, since only living things can have an internal purpose.</p>
<p>To return to the Summa contra Gentiles, having proved the existence
of God, we can now say many things about Him, but these are all, in a
sense, negative; God’s nature is only known to us through what is not.
God is eternal, since He is unmoved; He is unchanging, since He contains
no passive potentiality. David of Dinant (a materialistic pantheist of
the early thirteenth century) ‘raved’ that God is the same as primary
matter; this is absurd, since primary matter is pure passivity, and God
is pure activity. In God, there is no composition, therefore He is not a
body, because bodies have parts.</p>
<p>God is His own essence, since otherwise He would not be simple, but
would be compounded of essence and existence. (This point is important.)
In God, essence and existence are identical. There are no accidents in
God. He cannot be specified by any substantial difference; He is not in
any genus; He cannot be defined. But He lacks not the excellence of any
genus. Things are in some ways like God, in others not. It is more
fitting to say that things are like God than that God is like
things.</p>
<p>God is good, and is His own goodness; He is the good of every good.
He is intelligent, and His act of intelligence is His essence. He
understands by His essence, and understands Himself perfectly. (John the
Scot, it will be remembered, thought otherwise.)</p>
<p>Although there is no composition in the divine intellect, God
understands many things. This might seem a difficulty, but the things
that He understands have no distinct being in Him. Nor do they exist per
se, as Plato thought, because forms of natural things cannot exist or be
understood apart from matter. Nevertheless, God must understand forms
before creating. The solution of this difficulty is as follows: ’The
concept of the divine intellect, according as He understands Himself,
which concept is His Word, is the likeness not only of God Himself
understood, but also of all the things of which the divine essence is
the likeness. Accordingly many things can be understood by God, by one
intelligible species which is the divine essence, and by one understood
intention which is the divine Word.’3 Every form, so far as it is
something positive, is a perfection. God’s intellect includes in His</p>
<p>essence what is proper to each thing, by understanding where it is
like Him and where unlike; for instance life, not knowledge, is the
essence of a plant, and knowledge, not intellect, is the essence of an
animal. Thus a plant is like God in being alive, but unlike in not
having knowledge; an animal is like God in having knowledge, but unlike
in not having intellect. It is always by a negation that a creature
differs from God.</p>
<p>God understands all things at the same instant. His knowledge is not
a habit, and is not discursive or argumentative. God is truth. (This is
to be understood literally.)</p>
<p>We come now to a question which had already troubled both Plato and
Aristotle. Can God know particular things, or does He only know
universals and general truths? A Christian, since he believes in
Providence, must hold that God knows particular things; nevertheless,
there are weighty arguments against this view. St Thomas enumerates
seven such arguments, and then proceeds to refute them. The seven
arguments are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Singularity being signate matter, nothing immaterial can know
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Singulars do not always exist, and cannot be known when they do
not exist; therefore they cannot be known by an unchanging
being.</p></li>
<li><p>Singulars are contingent, not necessary; therefore there can be
no certain knowledge of them except when they exist.</p></li>
<li><p>Some singulars are due to volitions, which can only be known to
the person willing.</p></li>
<li><p>Singulars are infinite in number, and the infinite as such is
unknown.</p></li>
<li><p>Singulars are too petty for God’s attention.</p></li>
<li><p>In some singulars there is evil, but God cannot know
evil.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Aquinas replies that God knows singulars as their cause; that He
knows things that do not yet exist, just as an artificer does when he is
making something; that He knows future contingents, because He sees each
thing in time as if present, He Himself being not in time; that He knows
our minds and secret wills, and that He knows an infinity of things,
although we cannot do so. He knows trivial things, because nothing is
wholly trivial, and everything has some nobility; otherwise God would
know only Himself. Moreover the order of the universe is very noble, and
this cannot be known without knowing even the trivial parts. Finally,
God knows evil things, because knowing anything good involves knowing
the opposite evil.</p>
<p>In God there is Will; His Will is His essence, and its principal
object is the divine essence. In willing Himself, God wills other things
also, for God is the end of all things. He wills even things that are
not yet, He wills His own being and goodness, but other things, though
He wills them, He does not will necessarily. There is free will in God;
a reason can be assigned for His volition, but not a cause. He cannot
will things impossible in themselves; for example, He cannot make a
contradiction true. The Saint’s example of something beyond even divine
power is not an altogether happy one; he says that God could not make a
man be an ass.</p>
<p>In God are delight and joy and love; God hates nothing, and possesses
the contemplative and active virtues. He is happy, and is His own
happiness.</p>
<p>We come now (in Book II) to the consideration of creatures. This is
useful for refuting errors against God. God created the world out of
nothing, contrary to the opinions of the ancients. The subject of the
things that God cannot do is resumed. He cannot be a body, or change
Himself; He cannot fail; He cannot be weary, or forget, or repent, or be
angry or sad; He cannot make a man have no soul, or make the sum of the
angles of a triangle be not two right angles. He cannot undo the past,
commit sins, make another God, or make Himself not exist.</p>
<p>Book II is mainly occupied with the soul in man. All intellectual
substances are immaterial and incorruptible; angels have no bodies, but
in men the soul is united to a body. It is the form of the body, as in
Aristotle. There are not three souls in man, but only one. The whole
soul is present entire in every part of the body. The souls of animals,
unlike those of men, are not immortal. The intellect is part of each
man’s soul; there is not, as Averroes maintained, only one intellect, in
which various men participate. The soul is not transmitted with the
semen, but is created afresh with each man. There is, it is true, a
difficulty: when a man is born, out of wedlock, this seems to make God
an accomplice in adultery. This objection, however, is only specious.
(There is a grave objection, which troubled St Augustine, and that is as
to the transmission of original sin. It is the soul that sins, and if
the soul is not transmitted, but created afresh, how can it inherit the
sin of Adam? This is not discussed.)</p>
<p>In connection with the intellect, the problem of universals is
discussed. St Thomas’s position is that of Aristotle. Universals do not
subsist outside the soul, but the intellect, in understanding
universals, understands things that are outside the soul.</p>
<p>The Third Book is largely concerned with ethical questions. Evil is
unintentional, not an essence, and has an accidental cause which is
good. All things tend to be like God who is the end of all things. Human
happiness does not consist in carnal pleasures, honour, glory, wealth,
worldly power, or goods of the body, and is not seated in the senses.
Man’s ultimate happiness does not consist in acts of moral virtue,
because these are means; it consists in the contemplation of God. But
the knowledge of God possessed by the majority does not suffice; nor the
knowledge of Him obtained by demonstration; nor even the knowledge
obtained by faith. In this life, we cannot see God in His essence, or
have ultimate happiness; but hereafter we shall see Him face to face.
(Not literally, we are warned, because God has no face.) This will
happen, not by our natural power, but by the divine light; and even
then, we shall not see all of Him. By this vision we become partakers of
eternal life, i.e. of life outside time.</p>
<p>Divine Providence does not exclude evil, contingency, free will,
chance or luck. Evil comes through second causes, as in the case of a
good artist with bad tools.</p>
<p>Angels are not all equals; there is an order among them. Each angel
is the sole specimen of his species, for, since angels have no bodies,
they can only be distinct through specific differences, not through
position in space.</p>
<p>Astrology is to be rejected, for the usual reasons. In answer to the
question ‘Is there such a thing as fate?’ Aquinas replies that we might
give the name ‘fate’ to the order impressed by Providence, but it is
wiser not to do so, as ‘fate’ is a pagan word. This leads to an argument
that prayer is useful although Providence is unchangeable. (I have
failed to follow this argument.) God sometimes works miracles, but no
one else can. Magic, however, is possible with the help of demons; this
is not properly miraculous, and is not by the help of the stars.</p>
<p>Divine law directs us to love God; also, in a lesser degree, our
neighbour. It forbids fornication, because the father should stay with
the mother while the children are being reared. It forbids birth
control, as being against nature; it does not, however, on this account
forbid life-long celibacy. Matrimony should be indissoluble, because the
father is needed in the education of the children, both as more rational
than the mother, and as having more physical strength when punishment is
required. Not all carnal intercourse is sinful, since it is natural; but
to think the married state as good as continence is to fall into the
heresy of Jovinian. There must be strict monogamy; polygyny is unfair to
women, and polyandry makes paternity uncertain. Incest is to be
forbidden because it would complicate family life. Against
brother-sister incest there is a very curious argument: that if the love
of husband and wife were combined with that of brother and sister,
mutual attraction would be so strong as to cause unduly frequent
intercourse.</p>
<p>All these arguments on sexual ethics, it is to be observed, appeal to
purely rational considerations, not to divine commands and prohibitions.
Here, as throughout the first three books, Aquinas is glad, at the end
of a piece of reasoning, to quote texts showing that reason has led him
to a conclusion in harmony with the Scriptures, but he does not appeal
to authority until his result has been reached.</p>
<p>There is a most lively and interesting discussion of voluntary
poverty, which, as one might expect, arrives ultimately at a conclusion
in harmony with the principles of the mendicant Orders, but states the
objections with a force and realism which shows them to be such as he
had actually heard urged by the secular clergy.</p>
<p>He then passes on to sin, predestination, and election, on which his
view is broadly that of Augustine. By mortal sin a man forfeits his last
end to all eternity, and therefore eternal punishment is his due. No man
can be freed from sin except by grace, and yet the sinner is to be
blamed if he is not converted. Man needs grace to persevere in good, but
no one can merit divine assistance. God is not the cause of sinning, but
some He leaves in sin, while others He delivers from it. As regards
predestination, St Thomas seems to hold, with St Augustine, that no
reason can be given why some are elected and go to heaven, while others
are left reprobate and go to hell. He holds also that no man can enter
heaven unless he has been baptized. This is not one of the truths that
can be proved by the unaided reason; it is revealed in John iii. 5.4</p>
<p>The fourth book is concerned with the Trinity, the Incarnation, the
supremacy of the Pope, the sacraments, and the resurrection of the body.
In the main, it is addressed to theologians rather than philosophers,
and I shall therefore deal with it briefly.</p>
<p>There are three ways of knowing God: by reason, by revelation, and by
intuition of things previously known only by revelation. Of the third
way, however, he says almost nothing. A writer inclined to mysticism
would have said more of it than of either of the others, but Aquinas’s
temperament is ratiocinative rather than mystical.</p>
<p>The Greek Church is blamed for denying the double procession of the
Holy Ghost and the supremacy of the Pope. We are warned that, although
Christ was conceived of the Holy Ghost, we must not suppose that He was
the son of the Holy Ghost according to the flesh.</p>
<p>The sacraments are valid even when dispensed by wicked ministers.
This was an important point in Church doctrine. Very many priests lived
in mortal sin, and pious people feared that such priests could not
administer the sacraments. This was awkward; no one could know if he was
really married, or if he had received valid absolution. It led to heresy
and schism, since the puritanically minded sought to establish a
separate priesthood of more impeccable virtue. The Church, in
consequence, was obliged to assert with great emphasis that sin in a
priest did not incapacitate him for the performance of his
functions.</p>
<p>One of the last questions discussed is the resurrection of the body.
Here, as elsewhere, Aquinas states very fairly the arguments that have
been brought against the orthodox position. One of these, at first
sight, offers great difficulties. What is to happen, asks the Saint, to
a man who never, throughout his life, ate anything but human flesh, and
whose parents did likewise? It would</p>
<p>seem unfair to his victims that they should be deprived of their
bodies at the last day as a consequence of his greed; yet, if not, what
will be left to make up his body? I am happy to say that this
difficulty, which might at first sight seem insuperable, is triumphantly
met. The identity of the body, St Thomas points out, is not dependent on
the persistence of the same material particles; during life, by the
processes of eating and digesting, the matter composing the body
undergoes perpetual change. The cannibal may, therefore, receive the
same body at the resurrection, even if it is not composed of the same
matter as was in his body when he died. With this comforting thought we
may end our abstract of the Summa contra Gentiles.</p>
<p>In its general outlines, the philosophy of Aquinas agrees with that
of Aristotle, and will be accepted or rejected by a reader in the
measure in which he accepts or rejects the philosophy of the Stagyrite.
The originality of Aquinas is shown in his adaptation of Aristotle to
Christian dogma, with a minimum of alteration. In his day he was
considered a bold innovator; even after his death many of his doctrines
were condemned by the universities of Paris and Oxford. He was even more
remarkable for systematizing than for originality. Even if every one of
his doctrines were mistaken, the Summa would remain an imposing
intellectual edifice. When he wishes to refute some doctrine, he states
it first, often with great force, and almost always with an attempt at
fairness. The sharpness and clarity with which he distinguishes
arguments derived from reason and arguments derived from revelation are
admirable. He knows Aristotle well, and understands him thoroughly,
which cannot be said of any earlier Catholic philosopher.</p>
<p>These merits, however, seem scarcely sufficient to justify his
immense reputation. The appeal to reason is, in a sense, insincere,
since the conclusion to be reached is fixed in advance. Take, for
example, the indissolubility of marriage. This is advocated on the
ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a)
because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being
stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment. A modern
educator might retort (a) that there is no reason to suppose men in
general more rational than women, (b) that the sort of punishment that
requires great physical strength is not desirable in education. He might
go on to point out that fathers, in the modern world, have scarcely any
part in education. But no follower of St Thomas would, on that account,
cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of
belief are not those which are alleged.</p>
<p>Or take again the arguments professing to prove the existence of God.
All these, except the one from teleology in lifeless things, depend upon
the supposed impossibility of a series having no first term. Every
mathematician knows that there is no such impossibility; the series of
negative integers ending with minus one is an instance to the contrary.
But here again no Catholic is likely to abandon belief in God even if he
becomes convinced that St Thomas’s arguments are bad; he will invent
other arguments, or take refuge in revelation.</p>
<p>The contentions that God’s essence and existence are one and the
same, that God is His own goodness, His own power, and so on, suggest a
confusion, found in Plato, but supposed to have been avoided by
Aristotle, between the manner of being of particulars and the manner of
being of universals. God’s essence is, one must suppose, of the nature
of universals, while His existence is not. It is difficult to state this
difficulty satisfactorily, since it occurs within a logic that can no
longer be accepted. But it points clearly to some kind of syntactical
confusion, without which much of the argumentation about God would lose
its plausibility.</p>
<p>There is little of the true philosophic spirit in Aquinas. He does
not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument
may lead. He is not engaged in an enquiry, the result of which it is
impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he
already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can
find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much
the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The
finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not
philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he
deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of
Greece or of modern times.</p>
