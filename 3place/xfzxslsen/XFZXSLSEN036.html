<h4 id="three-doctors-of-the-church">3 THREE DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH</h4>
<p>Four men are called the Doctors of the Western Church: St Ambrose, St
Jerome, St Augustine, and Pope Gregory the Great. Of these the first
three were contemporaries, while the fourth belonged to a later date. I
shall, in this chapter, give some account of the life and times of the
first three, reserving for a later chapter an account of the doctrines
of St Augustine, who is, for us, the most important of the three.</p>
<p>Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine all flourished during the brief period
between the victory of the Catholic Church in the Roman Empire and the
barbarian invasion. All three were young during the reign of Julian the
Apostate; Jerome lived ten years after the sack of Rome by the Goths
under Alaric; Augustine lived till the irruption of the Vandals into
Africa, and died while they were besieging Hippo, of which he was
bishop. Immediately after their time, the masters of Italy, Spain, and
Africa were not only barbarians, but Arian heretics. Civilization
declined for centuries, and it was not until nearly a thousand years
later that Christendom again produced men who were their equals in
learning and culture. Throughout the dark ages and the medieval period,
their authority was revered; they, more than any other men, fixed the
mould into which the Church was shaped. Speaking broadly, St Ambrose
determined the ecclesiastical conception of the relation of Church and
State; St Jerome gave the Western Church its Latin Bible and a great
part of the impetus to monasticism; while St Augustine fixed the
theology of the Church until the Reformation, and, later, a great part
of the doctrines of Luther and Calvin. Few men have surpassed these
three in influence on the course of history. The independence of the
Church in relation to the secular State, as successfully maintained by
St Ambrose, was a new and revolutionary doctrine, which prevailed until
the Reformation; when Hobbes combated it in the seventeenth century, it
was against St Ambrose that he chiefly argued. St Augustine was in the
forefront of theological controversy during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, Protestants and Jansenists being for him, and
orthodox Catholics against him.</p>
<p>The capital of the Western Empire, at the end of the fourth century,
was Milan, of which Ambrose was bishop. His duties brought him
constantly into relations with the emperors, to whom he spoke habitually
as an equal, sometimes as a superior. His dealings with the imperial
court illustrate a general contrast characteristic of the times: while
the State was feeble, incompetent, governed by unprincipled
self-seekers, and totally without any policy beyond that of momentary
expedients, the Church was vigorous, able, guided by men prepared to
sacrifice everything personal in its interests, and with a policy so
far-sighted that it brought victory for the next thousand years. It is
true that these merits were offset by fanaticism and superstition, but
without these no reforming movement could, at that time, have
succeeded.</p>
<p>St Ambrose had every opportunity to seek success in the service of
the State. His father, also named Ambrose, was a high official—prefect
of the Gauls. The Saint was born, probably, at Treves, a frontier
garrison town, where the Roman legions were stationed to keep the
Germans at bay. At the age of thirteen he was taken to Rome, where he
had a good education, including a thorough grounding in Greek. When he
grew up he took to the law, in which he was very successful; and at the
age of thirty he was made governor of Liguria and Æmilia. Nevertheless,
four years later he turned his back on secular government, and by
popular acclaim became bishop of Milan, in opposition to an Arian
candidate. He gave all his worldly goods to the poor, and devoted the
whole of the rest of his life to the service of the Church, sometimes at
great personal risk. This choice was certaintly not dictated by worldly
motives, but, if it had been, it would have been wise. In the State,
even if he had become Emperor, he could at that time have found no such
scope for his administrative statesmanship as he found in the discharge
of his episcopal duties.</p>
<p>During the first nine years of Ambrose’s episcopate, the Emperor of
the West was Gratian, who was Catholic, virtuous, and careless. He was
so devoted to the chase that he neglected the government, and in the end
was assassinated. He was succeeded, throughout most of the Western
Empire, by a usurper named Maximus; but in Italy the succession passed
to Gratian’s younger brother Valentinian II, who was still a boy. At
first, the imperial power was exercised by his mother, Justina, widow of
the Emperor Valentinian I; but as she was an Arian, conflicts between
her and St Ambrose were inevitable.</p>
<p>All the three Saints with whom we are concerned in this chapter wrote
innumerable letters, of which many are preserved; the consequence is
that we know more about them than about any of the pagan philosophers,
and more than about all but a few of the ecclesiastics of the Middle
Ages. St Augustine wrote letters to all and sundry, mostly on doctrine
or Church discipline; St Jerome’s letters are mainly addressed to
ladies, giving advice on how to preserve virginity; but St Ambrose’s
most important and interesting letters are to Emperors, telling them in
what respects they have fallen short of their duty, or, on occasion,
congratulating them on having performed it.</p>
<p>The first public question with which Ambrose had to deal was that of
the altar and statue of Victory in Rome. Paganism lingered longer among
the senatorial families of the capital than it did elsewhere; the
official religion was in the hands of an aristocratic priesthood, and
was bound up with the imperial pride of the conquerors of the world. The
statue of Victory in the Senate House had been removed by Constantius,
the son of Constantine, and restored by Julian the Apostate. The Emperor
Gratian again removed the statue, whereupon a deputation of the Senate,
headed by Symmachus, prefect of the City, asked for its renewed
restoration.</p>
<p>Symmachus, who also played a part in the life of Augustine, was a
distinguished member of a distinguished family—rich, aristocratic,
cultivated, and pagan. He was banished from Rome by Gratian in 382 for
his protest against the removal of the statue of Victory, but not for
long, as he was prefect of the City in 384. He was the grandfather of
the Symmachus who was the father-in-law of Boethius, and who was
prominent in the reign of Theodoric.</p>
<p>The Christian senators objected, and by the help of Ambrose and the
Pope (Damasus) their view was made to prevail with the Emperor. After
the death of Gratian, Symmachus and the pagan senators petitioned the
new Emperor, Valentinian II, in A.D. 384. In rebuttal of this renewed
attempt, Ambrose wrote to the Emperor, setting forth the thesis that, as
all Romans owed military service to their sovereign, so he (the Emperor)
owed service to Almighty God.1 ‘Let no one,’ he says, ‘take advantage of
your youth; if he be a heathen who demands this, it is not right that he
should bind your mind with the bonds of his own superstition; but by his
zeal he ought to teach and admonish you how to be zealous for the true
faith, since he defends vain things with all the passion of truth.’ To
be compelled to swear at the altar of an idol, he says, is, to a
Christian, persecution. ’If it were a civil cause the right of reply
would be reserved for the opposing party; it is a religious cause, and I
the bishop make a claim…. Certainly if anything else is decreed, we
bishops cannot constantly suffer it and take no notice; you</p>
<p>indeed may come to the Church, but will find either no priest there,
or one who will resist you.’2</p>
<p>The next epistle points out that the endowments of the Church serve
purposes never served by the wealth of heathen temples. ‘The possessions
of the Church are the maintenance of the poor. Let them count up how
many captives the temples have ransomed, what food they have contributed
for the poor, to what exiles they have supplied the means of living.’
This was a telling argument, and one which was quite justified by
Christian practice.</p>
<p>St Ambrose won his point, but a subsequent usurper, Eugenius, who
favoured the heathen, restored the altar and statue. It was only after
the defeat of Eugenius by Theodosius in 394 that the question was
finally decided in favour of the Christians.</p>
<p>The bishop was, at first, on very friendly terms with the imperial
court, and was employed on a diplomatic mission to the usurper Maximus,
who, it was feared, might invade Italy. But before long a grave matter
of controversy arose. The Empress Justina, as an Arian, requested that
one church in Milan might be ceded to the Arians, but Ambrose refused.
The people sided with him, and thronged the basilica in great crowds.
Gothic soldiers, who were Arians, were sent to take possession, but
fraternized with the people. ‘The Counts and Tribunes,’ he says in a
spirited letter to his sister,3 ‘came and urged me to cause the basilica
to be quickly surrendered, saying that the Emperor was exercising his
rights since everything was under his power. I answered that if he asked
of me what was mine, that is, my land, my money, or whatever of this
kind was my own, I would not refuse it, although all that I have
belonged to the poor, but that those things which are God’s are not
subject to the imperial power. “If my patrimony is required, enter upon
it; if my body, I will go at once. Do you wish to cast me into chains,
or to give me to death? It will be a pleasure to me. I will not defend
myself with throngs of people, nor will I cling to the altars and
entreat for my life, but will more gladly be slain myself for the
altars.“ I was indeed struck with horror when I learnt that armed men
had been sent to take possession of the basilica, lest while the people
were defending the basilica, there might be some slaughter which would
tend to the injury of the whole city. I prayed that I might not survive
the destruction of so great a city, or it might be of the whole of
Italy.’</p>
<p>These fears were not exaggerated, as the Gothic soldiery were liable
to break out into savagery, as they did twenty-five years later in the
sack of Rome.</p>
<p>Ambrose’s strength lay in the support of the people. He was accused
of inciting them, but replied that ‘it was in my power not to excite
them, but in God’s hands to quiet them’. None of the Arians, he says,
dared to go forth, as</p>
<p>there was not one Arian among the citizens. He was formally commanded
to surrender the basilica, and the soldiers were ordered to use violence
if necessary. But in the end they refused to use violence, and the
Emperor was compelled to give way. A great battle had been won in the
contest for ecclesiastical independence; Ambrose had demonstrated that
there were matters in which the State must yield to the Church, and had
thereby established a new principle which retains its importance to the
present day.</p>
<p>His next conflict was with the Emperor Theodosius. A synagogue had
been burnt, and the Count of the East reported that this had been done
at the instigation of the local bishop. The Emperor ordered that the
actual incendiaries should be punished, and that the guilty bishop
should rebuild the synagogue. St Ambrose neither admits nor denies the
bishop’s complicity, but is indignant that the Emperor should seem to
side with Jews against Christians. Suppose the bishop refuses to obey?
He will then have to become a martyr if he persists, or an apostate if
he gives way. Suppose the Count decides to rebuild the synagogue himself
at the expense of the Christians? In that case the Emperor will have an
apostate Count, and Christian money will be taken to support unbelief.
‘Shall, then, a place be made for the unbelief of the Jews out of the
spoils of the Church, and shall the patrimony, which by the favour of
Christ has been gained for Christians, be transferred to the treasuries
of unbelievers?’ He continues: ‘But perhaps, the cause of discipline
moves you, O Emperor. Which, then, is of greater importance, the show of
discipline or the cause of religion? It is needful that judgment should
yield to religion. Have you not heard, O Emperor, how, when Julian
commanded that the Temple of Jerusalem should be restored, those who
were clearing the rubbish were consumed by fire?’</p>
<p>It is clear that, in the Saint’s opinion, the destruction of
synagogues should not be punished in any way. This is an example of the
manner in which, as soon as it acquired power, the Church began to
stimulate anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>The next conflict between Emperor and Saint was more honourable to
the latter. In A.D. 390, when Theodosius was in Milan, a mob in
Thessalonica murdered the captain of the garrison. Theodosius, on
receiving the news, was seized with ungovernable fury, and ordered an
abominable revenge. When the people were assembled in the circus, the
soldiers fell upon them, and massacred at least seven thousand of them
in an indiscriminate slaughter. Hereupon Ambrose, who had endeavoured in
advance to restrain the Emperor, but in vain, wrote him a letter full of
splendid courage, on a purely moral issue, involving, for once, no
question of theology or the power of the Church:</p>
<p>‘There was that done in the city of the Thessalonians of which no
similar record exists, which I was not able to prevent happening; which,
indeed, I had before said would be most atrocious when I so often
petitioned against it.’</p>
<p>David repeatedly sinned, and confessed his sin with penitence.4 Will
Theodosius do likewise? Ambrose decides that ‘I dare not offer the
sacrifice if you intend to be present. Is that which is not allowed
after shedding the blood of one innocent person, allowed after shedding
the blood of many? I do not think so.’</p>
<p>The Emperor repented, and, divested of the purple, did public penance
in the cathedral of Milan. From that time until his death in 395, he had
no friction with Ambrose.</p>
<p>Ambrose, while he was eminent as a statesman, was, in other respects,
merely typical of his age. He wrote, like other ecclesiastical authors,
a treatise in praise of virginity, and another deprecating the
remarriage of widows. When he had decided on the site for his new
cathedral, two skeletons (revealed in a vision, it was said) were
conveniently discovered on the spot, were found to work miracles, and
were declared by him to be those of two martyrs. Other miracles are
related in his letters, with all the credulity characteristic of his
times. He was inferior to Jerome as a scholar, and to Augustine as a
philosopher. But as a statesman, who skilfully and courageously
consolidated the power of the Church, he stands out as a man of the
first rank.</p>
<p>Jerome is chiefly notable as the translator who produced the Vulgate,
which remains to this day the official Catholic version of the Bible.
Until his day the Western Church relied, as regards the Old Testament,
chiefly on translations from the Septuagint, which, in important ways,
differed from the Hebrew original. Christians, as we have seen, were
given to maintaining that the Jews, since the rise of Christianity, had
falsified the Hebrew text where it seemed to predict the Messiah. This
was a view which sound scholarship showed to be untenable, and which
Jerome firmly rejected. He accepted the help of rabbis, given secretly
for fear of the Jews. In defending himself against Christian criticism
he said: ‘Let him who would challenge aught in this translation ask the
Jews.’ Because of his acceptance of the Hebrew text in the form which
the Jews regarded as correct, his version had, at first, a largely
hostile reception; but it won its way, partly because St Augustine on
the whole supported it. It was a great achievement, involving
considerable textual criticism.</p>
<p>Jerome was born in 345—five years after Ambrose—not far from
Aquileia, at a town called Stridon, which was destroyed by the Goths in
377. His family were well-to-do, but not rich. In 363 he went to Rome,
where he studied rhetoric and sinned. After travelling in Gaul, he
settled in Aquileia,</p>
<p>and became an ascetic. The next five years he spent as a hermit in
the Syrian wilderness. ’His life while in the desert was one of rigorous
penance, of tears and groans alternating with spiritual ecstasy, and of
temptations from haunting memories of Roman life; he lived in a cell or
cavern; he earned his daily bread, and was clad in sackcloth.’5 After
this period, he travelled to Constantinople, and lived in Rome for three
years, where he became the friend and adviser of Pope Damasus, with
whose encouragement he undertook his translation of the Bible.</p>
<p>St Jerome was a man of many quarrels. He quarrelled with St Augustine
about the somewhat questionable behaviour of St Peter as related by St
Paul in Galatians ii; he broke with his friend Rufinus over Origen; and
he was so vehement against Pelagius that his monastery was attacked by a
Pelagian mob. After the death of Damasus, he seems to have quarrelled
with the new Pope; he had, while in Rome, become acquainted with various
ladies who were both aristocratic and pious, some of whom he persuaded
to adopt the ascetic life. The new Pope, in common with many other
people in Rome, disliked this. For this reason among others, Jerome left
Rome for Bethlehem, where he remained from 386 till his death in
420.</p>
<p>Among his distinguished female converts, two were especially notable:
the widow Paula and her daughter Eustochium. Both these ladies
accompanied him on his circuitous journey to Bethlehem. They were of the
highest nobility, and one cannot but feel a flavour of snobbery in the
Saint’s attitude to them. When Paula died and was buried at Bethlehem,
Jerome composed an epitaph for her tomb:</p>
<p>Within this tomb a child of Scipio lies,</p>
<p>A daughter of the far-famed Pauline house,</p>
<p>A scion of the Gracchi, of the stock</p>
<p>Of Agamemnon’s self, illustrious:</p>
<p>Here rests the lady Paula, well-beloved</p>
<p>Of both her parents, with Eustochium</p>
<p>For daughter; she the first of Roman dames</p>
<p>Who hardship chose and Bethlehem for Christ.6</p>
<p>Some of Jerome’s letters to Eustochium are curious. He gives her
advice on the preservation of virginity, very detailed and frank; he
explains the exact anatomical meaning of certain euphemisms in the Old
Testament; and he employs a kind of erotic mysticism in praising the
joys of conventual life. A nun is the Bride of Christ; this marriage is
celebrated in the Song of Solomon.</p>
<p>In a long letter written at the time when she took the vows, he gives
a remarkable message to her mother: ’Are you angry with her because she
chooses to be a king’s [Christ’s] wife and not a soldier’s? She has
conferred on you a high privilege; you are now the mother-in-law of
God.’7</p>
<p>To Eustochium herself, in the same letter (xxii), he says:</p>
<p>‘Ever let the privacy of your chamber guard you; ever let the
Bridegroom sport with you within. Do you pray? You speak to the
Bridegroom. Do you read? He speaks to you. When sleep overtakes you He
will come behind and put His hand through the hole of the door, and your
heart shall be moved for Him; and you will awake and rise up and say: “I
am sick of love.“ Then He will reply: “A garden enclosed is my sister,
my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.“’</p>
<p>In the same letter he relates how, after cutting himself off from
relations and friends, ‘and—harder still—from the dainty food to which I
had been accustomed’, he still could not bear to be parted from his
library, and took it with him to the desert. ‘And so, miserable man that
I was, I would fast only that I might afterwards read Cicero.’ After
days and nights of remorse, he would fall again, and read Plautus. After
such indulgence, the style of the prophets seemed ‘rude and repellent’.
At last, during a fever, he dreamed that, at the Last Judgment, Christ
asked him who he was, and he replied that he was a Christian. The answer
came: ‘Thou liest, thou art a follower of Cicero and not of Christ.’
Thereupon he was ordered to be scourged. At length Jerome, in his dream,
cried out: ‘Lord, if ever again I possess worldly books, or if ever
again I read such, I have denied Thee.’ This, he adds, ‘was no sleep or
idle dream’.8</p>
<p>After this, for some years, his letters contain few classical
quotations. But after a certain time he lapses again into verses from
Virgil, Horace, and even Ovid. They seem, however, to be from memory,
particularly as some of them are repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>Jerome’s letters express the feelings produced by the fall of the
Roman Empire more vividly than any others known to me. In 396 he
writes:9</p>
<p>’I shudder when I think of the catastrophes of our time. For twenty
years and more the blood of Romans has been shed daily between
Constantinople and the Julian Alps. Scythia, Thrace, Macedonia, Dacia,
Thessaly, Achaia, Epirus, Dalmatia, the Pannonias—each and all of these
have been sacked and pillaged and plundered by Goths and Sarmatians,
Quadi and Alans, Huns</p>
<p>and Vandals and Marchmen…. The Roman world is falling: yet we hold up
our heads instead of bowing them. What courage, think you, have the
Corinthians now, or the Athenians or the Lacedaemonians or the
Arcadians, or any of the Greeks over whom the barbarians bear sway? I
have mentioned only a few cities, but these once the capitals of no mean
States.’</p>
<p>He goes on to relate the ravages of the Huns in the East, and ends
with the reflection: ‘To treat such themes as they deserve, Thucydides
and Sallust would be as good as dumb.’</p>
<p>Seventeen years later, three years after the sack of Rome, he
writes:10</p>
<p>‘The world sinks into ruin: yes! but shameful to say our sins still
live and flourish. The renowned city, the capital of the Roman Empire,
is swallowed up in one tremendous fire; and there is no part of the
earth where Romans are not in exile. Churches once held sacred are now
but heaps of dust and ashes; and yet we have our minds set on the desire
of gain. We live as though we were going to die to-morrow; yet we build
as though we were going to live always in this world. Our walls shine
with gold, our ceilings also and the capitals of our pillars; yet Christ
dies before our doors naked and hungry in the person of His poor.’</p>
<p>This passage occurs incidentally in a letter to a friend who has
decided to devote his daughter to perpetual virginity, and most of it is
concerned with the rules to be observed in the education of girls so
dedicated. It is strange that, with all Jerome’s deep feeling about the
fall of the ancient world, he thinks the preservation of virginity more
important than victory over the Huns and Vandals and Goths. Never once
do his thoughts turn to any possible measure of practical statesmanship;
never once does he point out the evils of the fiscal system, or of
reliance on an army composed of barbarians. The same is true of Ambrose
and of Augustine; Ambrose, it is true, was a statesman, but only on
behalf of the Church. It is no wonder that the Empire fell into ruin
when all the best and most vigorous minds of the age were so completely
remote from secular concerns. On the other hand, if ruin was inevitable,
the Christian outlook was admirably fitted to give men fortitude, and to
enable them to preserve their religious hopes when earthly hopes seemed
vain. The expression of this point of view, in The City of God, was the
supreme merit of St Augustine.</p>
<p>Of St Augustine I shall speak, in this chapter, only as a man; as a
theologian and philosopher, I shall consider him in the next
chapter.</p>
<p>He was born in 354, nine years after Jerome, and fourteen years after
Ambrose; he was a native of Africa, where he passed much the greater
part of his life. His mother was a Christian, but his father was not.
After a period as a Manichæan, he became a Catholic, and was baptized by
Ambrose in Milan.</p>
<p>He became bishop of Hippo, not far from Carthage, about the year 396.
There he remained until his death in 430.</p>
<p>Of his early life we know much more than in the case of most
ecclesiastics, because he has told of it in his Confessions. This book
has had famous imitators, particularly Rousseau and Tolstoy, but I do
not think it had any comparable predecessors. St Augustine is in some
ways similar to Tolstoy, to whom, however, he is superior in intellect.
He was a passionate man, in youth very far from a pattern of virtue, but
driven by an inner impulse to search for truth and righteousness. Like
Tolstoy, he was obsessed, in his later years, by a sense of sin, which
made his life stern and his philosophy inhuman. He combated heresies
vigorously, but some of his views, when repeated by Jansenius in the
seventeenth century, were pronounced heretical. Until the Protestants
took up his opinions, however, the Catholic Church had never impugned
their orthodoxy.</p>
<p>One of the first incidents of his life related in the Confessions
occurred in his boyhood, and did not, in itself, greatly distinguish him
from other boys. It appears that, with some companions of his own age,
he despoiled a neighbour’s pear tree, although he was not hungry, and
his parents had better pears at home. He continued throughout his life
to consider this an act of almost incredible wickedness. It would not
have been so bad if he had been hungry, or had had no other means of
getting pears; but, as it was, the act was one of pure mischief,
inspired by the love of wickedness for its own sake. It is this that
makes it so unspeakably black. He beseeches God to forgive him:</p>
<p>’Behold my heart, O God, behold my heart, which Thou hadst pity upon
in the bottom of the abyss. Now, behold, let my heart tell Thee, what it
sought there, that I should be gratuitously wicked, having no temptation
to that evil deed, but the evil deed itself. It was foul, and I loved
it; I loved to perish, I loved mine own fault, not that for the sake of
which I committed the fault, but my fault itself I loved. Foul soul,
falling from the firmament to expulsion from Thy presence; not seeking
aught through the shame, but the shame itself!’11</p>
<p>He goes on like this for seven chapters, and all about some pears
plucked from a tree in a boyish prank. To a modern mind, this seems
morbid;12 but in his own age it seemed right and a mark of holiness. The
sense of sin, which was very strong in his day, came to the Jews as a
way of reconciling self-importance with outward defeat. Yahweh was
omnipotent, and Yahweh was specially interested in the Jews; why, then,
did they not prosper? Because they were wicked: they were idolators,
they married gentiles, they failed to</p>
<p>observe the Law. God’s purposes were centred on the Jews, but, since
righteousness is the greatest of goods, and is achieved through
tribulation, they must first be chastised, and must recognize their
chastisement as a mark of God’s paternal love.</p>
<p>Christians put the Church in place of the Chosen People, but except
in one respect this made little difference to the psychology of sin. The
Church, like the Jews, suffered tribulation; the Church was troubled by
heresies; individual Christians fell into apostasy under the stress of
persecution. There was, however, one important development, already
made, to a great extent, by the Jews, and that was the substitution of
individual for communal sin. Originally, it was the Jewish nation that
sinned, and that was collectively punished; but later sin became more
personal, thus losing its political character. When the Church was
substituted for the Jewish nation, this change became essential, since
the Church, as a spiritual entity, could not sin, but the individual
sinner could cease to be in communion with the Church. Sin, as we said
just now, is connected with self-importance. Originally the importance
was that of the Jewish nation, but subsequently it was that of the
individual—not of the Church, because the Church never sinned. It thus
came about that Christian theology had two parts, one concerned with the
Church, and one with the individual soul. In later times, the first of
these was most emphasized by Catholics, and the second by Protestants,
but in St Augustine both exist equally, without his having any sense of
disharmony. Those who are saved are those whom God has predestined to
salvation; this is a direct relation of the soul to God. But no one will
be saved unless he has been baptized, and thereby become a member of the
Church; this makes the Church an intermediary between the soul and
God.</p>
<p>Sin is what is essential to the direct relation, since it explains
how a beneficent Deity can cause men to suffer, and how, in spite of
this, individual souls can be what is of most importance in the created
world. It is therefore not surprising that the theology upon which the
Reformation relied should be due to a man whose sense of sin was
abnormal.</p>
<p>So much for the pears. Let us now see what the Confessions have to
say on some other subjects.</p>
<p>Augustine relates how he learnt Latin, painlessly, at his mother’s
knee, but hated Greek, which they tried to teach him at school, because
he was ‘urged vehemently with cruel threats and punishments’. To the end
of his life, his knowledge of Greek remained slight. One might have
supposed that he would go on, from this contrast, to draw a moral in
favour of gentle methods in education. What he says, however, is:</p>
<p>‘It is quite clear, then, that a free curiosity has more power to
make us learn these things than a terrifying obligation. Only this
obligation restrains the waverings of that freedom by Thy laws, O my
God, Thy laws, from the master’s rod to the martyr’s trials, for Thy
laws have the effect of mingling for us certain wholesome bitters, which
recall us to Thee away from that pernicious blithesomeness, by means of
which we depart from Thee.’</p>
<p>The schoolmaster’s blows, though they failed to make him know Greek,
cured him of being perniciously blithesome, and were, on this ground, a
desirable part of education. For those who make sin the most important
of all human concerns, this view is logical. He goes on to point out
that he sinned, not only as a school-boy, when he told lies and stole
food, but even earlier; indeed he devotes a whole chapter (Book I,
chap. vii) to proving that even infants at the breast are full of
sin—gluttony, jealousy, and other horrible vices.</p>
<p>When he reached adolescence, the lusts of the flesh overcame him.
’Where was I, and how far was I exiled from the delights of Thy house,
in that sixteenth year of the age of my flesh, when the madness of lust
which hath licence through man’s viciousness, though forbidden by Thy
laws, took the rule over me, and I resigned myself wholly to it?’13</p>
<p>His father took no pains to prevent this evil, but confined himself
to giving help in Augustine’s studies. His mother, St Monica, on the
contrary, exhorted him to chastity, but in vain. And even she did not,
at that time, suggest marriage, ‘lest my prospects might be embarrassed
by the clog of a wife’.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen he went to Carthage, ’where there seethed all
around me a cauldron of lawless loves. I loved not yet, yet I loved to
love, and out of a deep-seated want, I hated myself for wanting not. I
sought what I might love, in love with loving, and I hated safety…. To
love then, and to be beloved, was sweet to me; but more, when I obtained
to enjoy the person I loved. I defiled, therefore, the spring of
friendship with the filth of concupiscence, and I beclouded its
brightness with the hell of lustfulness.’14 These words describe his
relation to a mistress whom he loved faithfully for many years,15 and by
whom he had a son, whom he also loved, and to whom, after his
conversion, he gave much care in religious education.</p>
<p>The time came when he and his mother thought he ought to begin to
think of marrying. He became engaged to a girl of whom she approved, and
it was held necessary that he should break with his mistress. ‘My
mistress,’ he says, ’being torn from my side as a hindrance to my
marriage, my heart which clave unto her was torn and wounded and
bleeding. And she returned to Africa [Augustine was at this time in
Milan], vowing unto Thee never to know any other man, leaving with me my
son by her.’16 As, however, the marriage could not take place for two
years, owing to the girl’s youth, he took meanwhile another mistress,
less official and less acknowledged. His</p>
<p>conscience increasingly troubled him, and he used to pray: ’Give me
chastity and continence, only not yet.’17 At last, before the time had
come for his marriage, religion won a complete victory, and he dedicated
the rest of his life to celibacy.</p>
<p>To return to an earlier time: in his nineteenth year, having achieved
proficiency in rhetoric, he was recalled to philosophy by Cicero. He
tried reading the Bible, but found it lacking in Ciceronian dignity. It
was at this time that he became a Manichæan, which grieved his mother.
By profession he was a teacher of rhetoric. He was addicted to
astrology, to which, in later life, he was averse, because it teaches
that ‘the inevitable cause of thy sin is in the sky’.18 He read
philosophy, so far as it could be read in Latin; he mentions
particularly Aristotle’s Ten Categories, which, he says, he understood
without the help of a teacher. ’And what did it profit me, that I, the
vilest slave of evil passions, read by myself all the books of so-called
“liberal“ arts, and understood whatever I could read? … For I had my
back to the light, and my face to the things enlightened; whence my face
… itself was not enlightened.’19 At this time he believed that God was a
vast and bright body, and he himself a part of that body. One could wish
that he had told in detail the tenets of the Manichæans, instead of
merely saying they were erroneous.</p>
<p>It is interesting that St Augustine’s first reasons for rejecting the
doctrines of Manichæus were scientific. He remembered—so he tells
us20—what he had learned of astronomy from the writings of the best
astronomers, ‘and I compared them with the sayings of Manichæus, who in
his crazy folly has written much and copiously upon these subjects; but
none of his reasoning of the solstices, nor equinoxes, nor eclipses, nor
whatever of this kind I had learned in books of secular philosophy, was
satisfactory to me. But I was commanded to believe; and yet it
corresponded not with reasonings obtained by calculations, and by my own
observations, but was quite contrary.’ He is careful to point out that
scientific mistakes are not in themselves a sign of errors as to the
faith, but only become so when delivered with an air of authority as
known through divine inspiration. One wonders what he would have thought
if he had lived in the time of Galileo.</p>
<p>In the hope of resolving his doubts, a Manichæan bishop named
Faustus, reputed the most learned member of the sect, met him and
reasoned with him. But ’I found him first utterly ignorant of liberal
sciences, save grammar, and that but in an ordinary way. But because he
had read some of Tully’s Orations, a very few books of Seneca, some
things of the poets, and such few</p>
<p>volumes of his own sect, as were written in Latin and in logical
order, and was daily practised in speaking, he acquired a certain
eloquence, which proved the more pleasing and seductive, because under
the control of his good sense, and with a certain natural grace.’21</p>
<p>He found Faustus quite unable to solve his astronomical difficulties.
The books of the Manichæans, he tells us, ‘are full of lengthy fables,
of the heaven, and stars, sun, and moon’, which do not agree with what
has been discovered by astronomers; but when he questioned Faustus on
these matters, Faustus frankly confessed his ignorance. ’Even for this I
liked him the better. For the modesty of a candid mind is even more
attractive than the knowledge of those things which I desired; and such
I found him, in all the more difficult and subtle questions.’22</p>
<p>This sentiment is surprisingly liberal; one would not have expected
it in that age. Nor is it quite in harmony with St Augustine’s later
attitude towards heretics.</p>
<p>At this time he decided to go to Rome, not, he says, because there
the income of a teacher was higher than at Carthage, but because he had
heard that classes were more orderly. At Carthage, the disorders
perpetrated by students were such that teaching was almost impossible;
but at Rome, while there was less disorder, students fraudulently evaded
payment.</p>
<p>In Rome, he still associated with the Manichæans, but with less
conviction of their rightness. He began to think that the Academics were
right in holding that men ought to doubt everything.23 He still,
however, agreed with the Manichæans in thinking ‘that it is not we
ourselves that sin, but that some other nature (what, I know not) sins
in us’, and he believed Evil to be some kind of substance. This makes it
clear that, before as after his conversion, the question of sin
pre-occupied him.</p>
<p>After about a year in Rome, he was sent to Milan by the Prefect
Symmachus, in response to a request from that city for a teacher of
rhetoric. At Milan he became acquainted with Ambrose, ‘known to the
whole world as among the best of men’. He came to love Ambrose for his
kindness, and to prefer the Catholic doctrine to that of the Manichæans;
but for a while he was held back by the scepticism he had learnt from
the Academics, ‘to which philosophers notwithstanding, because they were
without the saving name of Christ, I utterly refused to commit the care
of my sick soul’.24</p>
<p>In Milan he was joined by his mother, who had a powerful influence in
hastening the last steps of his conversion. She was a very earnest
Catholic, and</p>
<p>he writes of her always in a tone of reverence. She was the more
important to him at this time, because Ambrose was too busy to converse
with him privately.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting chapter25 in which he compares the
Platonic philosophy with Christian doctrine. The Lord, he says, at this
time provided him with ‘certain books of the Platonists, translated from
Greek into Latin. And therein I read, not indeed in these words, but to
the same purpose, enforced by many and diverse reasons, that “In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God:
the same was in the beginning with God; all things were made by Him, and
without Him was nothing made: that which was made by Him is life, and
the life was the light of men, and the light shineth in the darkness,
and the darkness comprehended it not. And that the soul of man, though
it “bears witness to the light“, yet itself “is not that light“, but
God, the Word of God, “is that true light that lighteth every man that
cometh into the world“. And that “He was in the world, and the world was
made by Him, and the world knew Him not.“ But that “He came unto His
own, and His own received him not; but as many as received Him, to them
gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on
His Name“: this I read not there.’ He also did not read there that ‘the
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us’; nor that ‘He humbled Himself,
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross’; nor that
‘at the name of Jesus every knee should bow’.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, he found in the Platonists the metaphysical
doctrine of the Logos, but not the doctrine of the Incarnation and the
consequent doctrine of human salvation. Something not unlike these
doctrines existed in Orphism and the other mystery religions; but of
this St Augustine appears to have been ignorant. In any case, none of
these were connected with a comparatively recent historical event, as
Christianity was.</p>
<p>As against the Manichæans, who were dualists, Augustine came to
believe that evil originates not from some substance, but from
perverseness of will.</p>
<p>He found especial comfort in the writings of St Paul.26</p>
<p>At length, after passionate inward struggles, he was converted (386);
he gave up his professorship, his mistress, and his bride, and, after a
brief period of meditation in retirement, was baptized by St Ambrose.
His mother rejoiced, but died not long afterwards. In 388 he returned to
Africa, where he remained for the rest of his life, fully occupied with
his episcopal duties and with controversial writings against various
heresies, Donatist, Manichæan, and Pelagian.</p>
