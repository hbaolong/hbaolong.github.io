<h4 id="erasmus-and-more">4 ERASMUS AND MORE</h4>
<p>In northern countries the Renaissance began later than in Italy, and
soon became entangled with the Reformation. But there was a brief
period, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, during which the new
learning was being vigorously disseminated in France, England, and
Germany, without having become involved in theological controversy. This
northern Renaissance was in many ways very different from that of Italy.
It was not anarchic or amoral; on the contrary, it was associated with
piety and public virtue. It was much interested in applying standards of
scholarship to the Bible, and in obtaining a more accurate text than
that of the Vulgate. It was less brilliant and more solid than its
Italian progenitor, less concerned with personal display of learning,
and more anxious to spread learning as widely as possible.</p>
<p>Two men, Erasmus and Sir Thomas More, will serve as exemplars of the
northern Renaissance. They were close friends, and had much in common.
Both were learned, though More less so than Erasmus; both despised the
scholastic philosophy; both aimed at ecclesiastical reform from within,
but deplored the Protestant schism when it came; both were witty,
humorous, and highly skilled writers. Before Luther’s revolt, they were
leaders of thought, but after it the world was too violent, on both
sides, for men of their type. More suffered martyrdom, and Erasmus sank
into ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>Neither Erasmus nor More was a philosopher in the strict sense of the
word. My reason for speaking of them is that they illustrate the temper
of a pre-revolutionary age, when there is a widespread demand for
moderate reform, and timid men have not yet been frightened into
reaction by extremists. They exemplify also the dislike of everything
systematic in theology or philosophy which characterized the reactions
against scholasticism.</p>
<p>Erasmus (1466–1536) was born at Rotterdam.1 He was illegitimate and
invented a romantically untrue account of the circumstances of his
birth. In fact, his father was a priest, a man of some learning, with a
knowledge of Greek. His parents died before he was grown up, and his
guardians (apparently because they had embezzled his money) cajoled him
into becoming a monk at the monastery of Steyr, a step which he
regretted all the rest of his life. One of his guardians was a
schoolmaster, but knew less Latin than Erasmus already knew as a
schoolboy; in reply to a Latin epistle from the boy, the schoolmaster
wrote: ‘If you should write again so elegantly, please to add a
commentary.’</p>
<p>In 1493, he became secretary to the bishop of Cambrai, who was
Chancellor of the Order of the Golden Fleece. This gave him the
opportunity to leave the monastery and travel, though not to Italy, as
he had hoped. His knowledge of Greek was as yet very slight, but he was
a highly accomplished Latinist; he particularly admired Lorenzo Valla,
on account of his book on the elegancies of the Latin language. He
considered latinity quite compatible with true devotion, and instanced
Augustine and Jerome—forgetting, apparently, the dream in which Our Lord
denounced the latter for reading Cicero.</p>
<p>He was for a time at the University of Paris, but found nothing there
that was of profit to himself. The university had had its great days,
from the beginning of scholasticism to Gerson and the conciliar
movement, but now the old disputes had become arid. Thomists and
Scotists, who jointly were called the Ancients, disputed against
Occamists, who were called the Terminists, or Moderns. At last, in 1482,
they were reconciled, and made common cause against the humanists, who
were making headway in Paris outside university circles. Erasmus hated
the scholastics, whom he regarded as superannuated and antiquated. He
mentioned in a letter that, as he wanted to obtain the doctor’s degree,
he tried to say nothing either graceful or witty. He did not really like
any philosophy, not even Plato and Aristotle, though they, being
ancients, had to be spoken of with respect.</p>
<p>In 1499 he made his first visit to England, where he liked the
fashion of kissing girls. In England he made friends with Colet and
More, who encouraged him to undertake serious work rather than literary
trifles. Colet lectured on the Bible without knowing Greek; Erasmus,
feeling that he would like to do work on the Bible, considered that a
knowledge of Greek was essential. After leaving England at the beginning
of 1500, he set to work to learn Greek, though he was too poor to afford
a teacher; by the autumn of 1502 he was proficient, and when in 1506 he
went to Italy, he found that the Italians had nothing to teach him. He
determined to edit St Jerome, and to bring out a Greek Testament with a
new Latin translation; both were achieved in 1516.</p>
<p>The discovery of inaccuracies in the Vulgate was subsequently of use
to the Protestants in controversy. He tried to learn Hebrew, but gave it
up.</p>
<p>The only book by Erasmus that is still read is The Praise of Folly.
The conception of this book came to him in 1509, while he was crossing
the Alps on the way from Italy to England. He wrote it quickly in
London, at the house of Sir Thomas More, to whom it is dedicated, with a
playful suggestion of appropriateness since ‘moros’ means ‘fool’. The
book is spoken by Folly in her own person; she sings her own praises
with great gusto, and her text is enlivened still further with
illustrations by Holbein. She covers all parts of human life, and all
classes and professions. But for her, the human race would die out, for
who can marry without folly? She counsels, as an antidote to wisdom,
‘taking a wife, a creature so harmless and silly, and yet so useful and
convenient, as might mollify and make pliable the stiffness and morose
humour of men’. Who can be happy without flattery or without self-love?
Yet such happiness is folly. The happiest men are those who are nearest
the brutes and divest themselves of reason. The best happiness is that
which is based on delusion, since it costs least: it is easier to
imagine oneself a king than to make oneself a king in reality. Erasmus
proceeds to make fun of national pride and of professional conceit:
almost all professors of the arts and sciences are egregiously
conceited, and derive their happiness from their conceit.</p>
<p>There are passages where the satire gives way to invective, and Folly
utters the serious opinions of Erasmus; these are concerned with
ecclesiastical abuses. Pardons and indulgences, by which priests
‘compute the time of each soul’s residence in purgatory’; the worship of
saints, even of the Virgin, ‘whose blind devotees think it manners to
place the mother before the Son’; the disputes of theologians as to the
Trinity and the Incarnation; the doctrine of transubstantiation; the
scholastic sects; popes, cardinals, and bishops—all are fiercely
ridiculed. Particularly fierce is the attack on the monastic orders:
they are ‘brainsick fools’, who have very little religion in them, yet
are ‘highly in love with themselves, and fond admirers of their own
happiness’. They behave as if all religion consisted in minute
punctilio: ‘The precise number of knots to the tying on of their
sandals; what distinct colours their respective habits, and what stuff
made of; how broad and long their girdles,’ and so on. ‘It will be
pretty to hear their pleas before the great tribunal: one will brag how
he mortified his carnal appetite by feeding only upon fish: another will
urge that he spent most of his time on earth in the divine exercise of
singing psalms: … another, that in threescore years he never so much as
touched a piece of money, except he fingered it through a thick pair of
gloves.’ But Christ will interrupt: ‘Woe unto you, scribes and
pharisees, … I left you but one precept, of loving another, which I do
not hear any one plead that he has faithfully discharged.’ Yet on earth
these men are feared, for they know many secrets from the confessional,
and often blab them when they are drunk.</p>
<p>Popes are not spared. They should imitate their Master by humility
and poverty. ‘Their only weapons ought to be those of the Spirit; and of
these indeed they are mightily liberal, as of their interdicts, their
suspensions, their denunciations, their aggravations, their greater and
lesser excommunications, and their roaring bulls, that fight whomever
they are thundered against; and these most holy fathers never issue them
out more frequently than against those who, at the instigation of the
devil, and not having the fear of God before their eyes, do feloniously
and maliciously attempt to lessen and impair St Peter’s patrimony.’</p>
<p>It might be supposed, from such passages, that Erasmus would have
welcomed the Reformation, but it proved otherwise.</p>
<p>The book ends with the serious suggestion that true religion is a
form of Folly. There are, throughout, two kinds of Folly, one praised
ironically, the other seriously; the kind praised seriously is that
which is displayed in Christian simplicity. This praise is of a piece
with Erasmus’s dislike of scholastic philosophy and of learned doctors
whose Latin was unclassical. But it has also a deeper aspect. It is the
first appearance in literature, so far as I know, of the view set forth
in Rousseau’s Savoyard Vicar, according to which true religion comes
from the heart, not the head, and all elaborate theology is superfluous.
This point of view has become increasingly common, and is now pretty
generally accepted among Protestants. It is, essentially, a rejection of
Hellenic intellectualism by the sentimentalism of the North.</p>
<p>Erasmus, on his second visit to England, remained for five years
(1509–14), partly in London, partly at Cambridge. He had a considerable
influence in stimulating English humanism. The education at English
public schools remained, until recently, almost exactly what he would
have wished: a thorough grounding in Greek and Latin, involving not only
translation, but verse and prose composition. Science, although
intellectually dominant since the seventeenth century, was thought
unworthy the attention of a gentleman or a divine; Plato should be
studied, but not the subjects which Plato thought worth studying. All
this is in line with the influence of Erasmus.</p>
<p>The men of the Renaissance had an immense curiosity; ‘these minds’,
says Huizinga, ‘never had their desired share of striking incidents,
curious details, rarities and anomalies’. But at first they sought these
things, not in the world, but in old books. Erasmus was interested in
the world, but could not digest it in the raw: it had to be dished up in
Latin or Greek before he could assimilate it. Travellers’ tales were
discounted, but any marvel in Pliny was believed. Gradually, however,
curiosity became transferred from books to the real world; men became
interested in the savages and strange animals that were actually
discovered, rather than in those described by classical authors. Caliban
comes from Montaigne, and Montaigne’s cannibals come from travellers.
‘The anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders’
had been seen by Othello, not derived from antiquity.</p>
<p>And so the curiosity of the Renaissance, from having been literary,
gradually became scientific. Such a cataract of new facts overwhelmed
men that they could, at first, only be swept along with the current. The
old systems were evidently wrong; Aristotle’s physics and Ptolemy’s
astronomy and Galen’s medicine could not be stretched to include the
discoveries that had been made. Montaigne and Shakespeare are content
with confusion: discovery is delightful, and system is its enemy. It was
not till the seventeenth century that the system-building faculty caught
up with the new knowledge of matters of fact. All this, however, has
taken us far from Erasmus, to whom Columbus was less interesting than
the Argonauts.</p>
<p>Erasmus was incurably and unashamedly literary. He wrote a book,
Enchiridion militis christiani, giving advice to illiterate soldiers:
they were to read the Bible, but also Plato, Ambrose, Jerome, and
Augustine. He made a vast collection of Latin proverbs, to which, in
later editions, he added many in Greek; his original purpose was to
enable people to write Latin idiomatically. He wrote an immensely
successful book of Colloquies, to teach people how to talk in Latin
about every-day matters, such as a game of bowls. This was, perhaps,
more useful than it seems now. Latin was the only international
language, and students at the University of Paris came from all over
Western Europe. It may have often happened that Latin was the only
language in which two students could converse.</p>
<p>After the Reformation, Erasmus lived first in Louvain, which
maintained perfect Catholic orthodoxy, then in Basel, which became
Protestant. Each side tried to enlist him, but for a long time in vain.
He had, as we have seen, expressed himself strongly about ecclesiastical
abuses and the wickedness of popes; in 1518, the very year of Luther’s
revolt, he published a satire, called Julius exclusus, describing the
failure of Julius II to get to heaven. But Luther’s violence repelled
him, and he hated war. At last he came down on the Catholic side. In
1524 he wrote a work defending free will, which Luther, following and
exaggerating Augustine, rejected. Luther replied savagely, and Erasmus
was driven further into reaction. From this time until his death, he
became increasingly unimportant. He had always been timid, and the times
were no longer suited to timid people. For honest men, the only
honourable alternatives were martyrdom or victory. His friend Sir Thomas
More was compelled to choose martyrdom, and Erasmus commented: ‘Would
More had never meddled with that dangerous business, and left the
theological cause to the theologians.’ Erasmus lived too long, into an
age of new virtues and new vices—heroism and intolerance—neither of
which he could acquire.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas More (1478–1535) was, as a man, much more admirable than
Erasmus, but much less important as an influence. He was a humanist, but
also a man of profound piety. At Oxford, he set to work to learn Greek,
which was then unusual, and was thought to show a sympathy with Italian
infidels. The authorities and his father objected, and he was removed
from the university. Thereupon he was attracted to the Carthusians,
practised extreme austerities, and contemplated joining the order. He
was deterred from doing so, apparently by the influence of Erasmus, whom
he first met at this time. His father was a lawyer, and he decided to
follow his father’s profession. In 1504 he was a Member of Parliament,
and led the opposition to Henry VII’s demand for new taxes. In this he
was successful, but the king was furious; he sent More’s father to the
Tower, releasing him, however, on payment of £100. On the king’s death
in 1509, More returned to the practice of the law, and won the favour of
Henry VIII. He was knighted in 1514, and employed on various embassies.
The king kept inviting him to court, but More would not come; at last
the king came uninvited to dine with him at his house in Chelsea. More
had no illusions as to Henry VIII; when complimented on the king’s
favourable disposition, he replied: ‘If my head should win him a castle
in France it should not fail to go.’</p>
<p>When Wolsey fell, the king appointed More chancellor in his stead.
Contrary to the usual practice, he refused all gifts from litigants. He
soon fell into disfavour, because the king was determined to divorce
Catherine of Aragon in order to marry Anne Boleyn, and More was
unalterably opposed to the divorce. He therefore resigned in 1532. His
incorruptibility when in office is shown by the fact that after his
resignation he had only £100 a year. In spite of his opinions, the king
invited him to his wedding with Anne Boleyn, but More refused the
invitation. In 1534, the king got Parliament to pass the Act of
Supremacy, declaring him, not the Pope, the head of the Church of
England. Under this act an Oath of Supremacy was exacted, which More
refused to take; this was only misprision of treason, which did not
involve the death penalty. It was proved, however, by very dubious
testimony, that he had said Parliament could not make Henry head of the
Church; on this evidence he was convicted of high treason, and beheaded.
His property was given to Princess Elizabeth, who kept it to the day of
her death.</p>
<p>More is remembered almost solely on account of his Utopia (1518).
Utopia is an island in the southern hemisphere, where everything is done
in the best possible way. It has been visited accidentally by a sailor
named Raphael Hythloday, who spent five years there, and only returned
to Europe to make its wise institutions known.</p>
<p>In Utopia, as in Plato’s Republic, all things are held in common, for
the public good cannot flourish where there is private property, and
without communism there can be no equality. More, in the dialogue,
objects that communism would make men idle, and destroy respect for
magistrates; to this Raphael replies that no one would say this who had
lived in Utopia.</p>
<p>There are in Utopia fifty-four towns, all on the same plan, except
that one is the capital. All the streets are twenty feet broad, and all
the private houses are exactly alike, with one door onto the street and
one onto the garden. There are no locks on the doors, and everyone may
enter any house. The roofs are flat. Every tenth year people change
houses—apparently to prevent any feeling of ownership. In the country,
there are farms, each containing not fewer than forty persons, including
two bondmen; each farm is under the rule of a master and mistress, who
are old and wise. The chickens are not hatched by hens, but in
incubators (which did not exist in More’s time). All are dressed alike,
except that there is a difference between the dress of men and women,
and of married and unmarried. The fashions never change, and no
difference is made between summer and winter clothing. At work, leather
or skins are worn; a suit will last seven years. When they stop work,
they throw a woollen cloak over their working clothes. All these cloaks
are alike, and are the natural colour of wool. Each family makes its own
clothes.</p>
<p>Everybody—men and women alike—works six hours a day, three before
dinner and three after. All go to bed at eight, and sleep eight hours.
In the early morning there are lectures, to which multitudes go,
although they are not compulsory. After supper an hour is devoted to
play. Six hours’ work is enough, because there are no idlers and there
is no useless work; with us, it is said, women, priests, rich people,
servants, and beggars, mostly do nothing useful, and owing to the
existence of the rich much labour is spent in producing unnecessary
luxuries; all this is avoided in Utopia. Sometimes it is found that
there is a surplus, and the magistrates proclaim a shorter working day
for a time.</p>
<p>Some men are elected to become men of learning, and are exempted from
other work while they are found satisfactory. All who are concerned with
government are chosen from the learned. The government is a
representative democracy, with a system of indirect election; at the
head is a prince who is elected for life, but can be deposed for
tyranny.</p>
<p>Family life is patriarchal; married sons live in their father’s
house, and are governed by him, unless he is in his dotage. If any
family grows too large, the surplus children are moved into another
family. If a town grows too large, some of the inhabitants are moved
into another town. If all the towns are too large, a new town is built
on waste land. Nothing is said as to what is to be done when all the
waste land is used up. All killing of beasts for food is done by
bondmen, lest free citizens should learn cruelty. There are hospitals
for the sick, which are so excellent that people who are ill prefer
them. Eating at home is permitted, but most people eat in common halls.
Here the ‘vile service’ is done by bondmen, but the cooking is done by
women and the waiting by the older children. Men sit at one bench, women
at another; nursing mothers, with children under five, are in a separate
parlour. All women nurse their own children. Children over five, if too
young to be waiters, ‘stand by with marvellous silence’, while their
elders eat; they have no separate dinner, but must be content with such
scraps as are given them from the table.</p>
<p>As for marriage, both men and women are sharply punished if not
virgin when they marry; and the householder of any house in which
misconduct has occurred is liable to incur infamy for carelessness.
Before marriage, bride and groom see each other naked; no one would buy
a horse without first taking off the saddle and bridle, and similar
considerations should apply in marriage. There is divorce for adultery
or ‘intolerable waywardness’ of either party, but the guilty party
cannot remarry. Sometimes divorce is granted solely because both parties
desire it. Breakers of wedlock are punished by bondage.</p>
<p>There is foreign trade, chiefly for the purpose of getting iron, of
which there is none in the island. Trade is used also for purposes
connected with war. The Utopians think nothing of martial glory, though
all learn how to fight, women as well as men. They resort to war for
three purposes: to defend their own territory when invaded; to deliver
the territory of an ally from invaders; and to free an oppressed nation
from tyranny. But whenever they can, they get mercenaries to fight their
wars for them. They aim at getting other nations into their debt, and
letting them work off the debt by supplying mercenaries. For war
purposes also they find a store of gold and silver useful, since they
can use it to pay foreign mercenaries. For themselves, they have no
money, and they teach contempt for gold by using it for chamberpots and
the chains of bondmen. Pearls and diamonds are used as ornaments for
infants, but never for adults. When they are at war, they offer large
rewards to anyone who will kill the prince of the enemy country, and
still larger rewards to anyone who will bring him alive, or to himself
if he yields himself up. They pity the common people among their
enemies, ‘knowing that they be driven and enforced to war against their
wills by the furious madness of their princes and heads’. Women fight as
well as men, but no one is compelled to fight. ‘Engines for war they
devise and invent wondrous wittily.’ It will be seen that their attitude
to war is more sensible than heroic, though they display great courage
when necessary.</p>
<p>As for ethics, we are told that they are too much inclined to think
that felicity consists in pleasure. This view, however, has no bad
consequences, because they think that in the next life the good are
rewarded and the wicked punished. They are not ascetic, and consider
fasting silly. There are many religions among them, all of which are
tolerated. Almost all believe in God and immortality; the few who do not
are not accounted citizens, and have no part in political life, but are
otherwise unmolested. Some holy men eschew meat and matrimony; they are
thought holy, but not wise. Women can be priests, if they are old and
widowed. The priests are few; they have honour, but no power.</p>
<p>Bondmen are people condemned for heinous offences, or foreigners who
have been condemned to death in their own countries, but whom the
Utopians have agreed to take as bondmen.</p>
<p>In the case of a painful incurable disease, the patient is advised to
commit suicide, but is carefully tended if he refuses to do so.</p>
<p>Raphael Hythloday relates that he preached Christianity to the
Utopians, and that many were converted when they learnt that Christ was
opposed to private property. The importance of communism is constantly
stressed; almost at the end we are told that in all other nations ‘I can
perceive nothing but a certain conspiracy of rich men procuring their
own commodities under the name and title of the common wealth.’</p>
<p>More’s Utopia was in many ways astonishingly liberal. I am not
thinking so much of the preaching of communism, which was in the
tradition of many religious movements. I am thinking rather of what is
said about war, about religion and religious toleration, against the
wanton killing of animals (there is a most eloquent passage against
hunting), and in favour of a mild criminal law. (The book opens with an
argument against the death penalty for theft.) It must be admitted,
however, that life in More’s Utopia, as in most others, would be
intolerably dull. Diversity is essential to happiness, and in Utopia
there is hardly any. This is a defect of all planned social systems,
actual as well as imaginary.</p>
