<h4 id="nietzsche">25 NIETZSCHE</h4>
<p>Nietzsche (1844–1900) regarded himself, rightly, as the successor of
Schopenhauer, to whom, however, he is superior in many ways,
particularly in the consistency and coherence of his doctrine.
Schopenhauer’s oriental ethic of renunciation seems out of harmony with
his metaphysic of the omnipotence of will; in Nietzsche, the will has
ethical as well as metaphysical primacy. Nietzsche, though a professor,
was a literary rather than an academic philosopher. He invented no new
technical theories in ontology or epistemology; his importance is
primarily in ethics, and secondarily as an acute historical critic. I
shall confine myself almost entirely to his ethics and his criticism of
religion, since it was this aspect of his writing that made him
influential.</p>
<p>His life was simple. His father was a Protestant pastor, and his
upbringing was very pious. He was brilliant at the university as a
classicist and student of philology, so much so that in 1869, before he
had taken his degree, he was offered a professorship of philology at
Basel, which he accepted. His health was never good, and after periods
of sick leave he was obliged to retire finally in 1879. After this, he
lived in Switzerland and Italy; in 1888 he became insane, and remained
so until his death. He had a passionate admiration for Wagner, but
quarrelled with him, nominally over Parsifal which he thought too
Christian and too full of renunciation. After the quarrel he criticized
Wagner savagely, and even went so far to accuse him of being a Jew. His
general outlook, however, remained very similar to that of Wagner in the
Ring; Nietzsche’s superman is very like Siegfried, except that he knows
Greek. This may seem odd, but that is not my fault.</p>
<p>Nietzsche was not consciously a romantic; indeed he often severely
criticizes the romantics. Consciously his outlook was Hellenic, but with
the Orphic component omitted. He admired the pre-Socratics, except
Pythagoras. He has a close affinity to Heraclitus. Aristotle’s
magnanimous man is very like what Nietzsche calls the ‘noble man’, but
in the main he regards the Greek philosophers from Socrates onwards as
inferior to their predecessors. He cannot forgive Socrates for his
humble origin; he calls him a ‘roturier’, and accuses him of corrupting
the noble Athenian youth with a democratic moral bias. Plato,
especially, is condemned on account of his taste for edification.
Nietzsche, however, obviously does not quite like condemning him, and
suggests, to excuse him, that perhaps he was insincere, and only
preached virtue as a means of keeping the lower classes in order. He
speaks of him on one occasion as ‘a great Cagliostro’. He likes
Democritus and Epicurus, but his affection for the latter seems somewhat
illogical, unless it is interpreted as really an admiration for
Lucretius.</p>
<p>As might be expected, he has a low opinion of Kant, whom he calls ‘a
moral fanatic à la Rousseau’.</p>
<p>In spite of Nietzsche’s criticism of the romantics, his outlook owes
much to them; it is that of aristocratic anarchism, like Byron’s, and
one is not surprised to find him admiring Byron. He attempts to combine
two sets of values which are not easily harmonized: on the one hand he
likes ruthlessness, war, and aristocratic pride; on the other hand, he
loves philosophy and literature and the arts, especially music.
Historically, these values coexisted in the Renaissance; Pope Julius II,
fighting for Bologna and employing Michelangelo, might be taken as the
sort of man whom Nietzsche would wish to see in control of governments.
It is natural to compare Nietzsche with Machiavelli, in spite of
important differences between the two men. As for the differences:
Machiavelli was a man of affairs, whose opinions had been formed by
close contact with public business, and were in harmony with his age; he
was not pedantic or systematic, and his philosophy of politics scarcely
forms a coherent whole; Nietzsche, on the contrary, was a professor, an
essentially bookish man, and a philosopher in conscious opposition to
what appeared to be the dominant political and ethical trends of his
time. The similarities, however, go deeper. Nietzsche’s political
philosophy is analogous to that of The Prince (not The Discourses),
though it is worked out and applied over a wider field. Both Nietzsche
and Machiavelli have an ethic which aims at power and is deliberately
anti-Christian, though Nietzsche is more frank in this respect. What
Caesar Borgia was to Machiavelli, Napoleon was to Nietzsche: a great man
defeated by petty opponents.</p>
<p>Nietzsche’s criticism of religions and philosophies is dominated
entirely by ethical motives. He admires certain qualities which he
believes (perhaps rightly) to be only possible for an aristocratic
minority; the majority, in his opinion, should be only means to the
excellence of the few, and should not be regarded as having any
independent claim to happiness or well-being. He alludes habitually to
ordinary human beings as the ‘bungled and botched’, and sees no
objection to their suffering if it is necessary for the production of a
great man. Thus the whole importance of the period from 1789 to 1815 is
summed up in Napoleon: ‘The Revolution made Napoleon possible: that is
its justification. We ought to desire the anarchical collapse of the
whole of our civilization if such a reward were to be its result.
Napoleon made nationalism possible: that is the latter’s excuse.’ Almost
all of the higher hopes of this century, he says, are due to
Napoleon.</p>
<p>He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to
shocking conventional readers. He does this by employing the words
‘good’ and ‘evil’ with their ordinary connotations, and then saying that
he prefers ‘evil’ to ‘good’. His book, Beyond Good and Evil, really aims
at changing the reader’s opinion as to what is good and what is evil,
but professes, except at moments, to be praising what is ‘evil’ and
decrying what is ‘good’. He says, for instance, that it is a mistake to
regard it as a duty to aim at the victory of good and the annihilation
of evil; this view is English, and typical of ‘that blockhead, John
Stuart Mill,’ a man for whom he has a specially virulent contempt. Of
him he says:</p>
<p>’I abhor the man’s vulgarity when he says “What is right for one man
is right for another“; “Do not to others that which you would not that
they should do unto you.“1 Such principles would fain establish the
whole of human traffic upon mutual services, so that every action would
appear to be a cash payment for something done to us. The hypothesis
here is ignoble to the last degree: it is taken for granted that there
is some sort of equivalence in value between my actions and thine.’2</p>
<p>True virtue, as opposed to the conventional sort, is not for all, but
should remain the characteristic of an aristocratic minority. It is not
profitable or prudent; it isolates its possessor from other men; it is
hostile to order, and does harm to inferiors. It is necessary for higher
men to make war upon the masses, and resist the democratic tendencies of
the age, for in all directions mediocre people are joining hands to make
themselves masters. ‘Everything that pampers, that softens, and that
brings the “people“ or “woman“ to the front, operates in favour of
universal suffrage—that is to say, the dominion of “inferior“ men.’ The
seducer was Rousseau, who made woman interesting; then came Harriet
Beecher Stowe and the slaves; then the Socialists with their
championship of workmen and the poor. All these are to be combated.</p>
<p>Nietzsche’s ethic is not one of self-indulgence in any ordinary
sense; he believes in Spartan discipline and the capacity to endure as
well as inflict pain for important ends. He admires strength of will
above all things. ‘I test the power of a will,’ he says, ’according to
the amount of resistance it can offer and</p>
<p>the amount of pain and torture it can endure and know how to turn to
its own advantage; I do not point to the evil and pain of existence with
the finger of reproach, but rather entertain the hope that life may one
day become more evil and more full of suffering than it has ever been.’
He regards compassion as a weakness to be combated. ‘The object is to
attain that enormous energy of greatness which can model the man of the
future by means of discipline and also by means of the annihilation of
millions of the bungled and botched, and which can yet avoid going to
ruin at the sight of the suffering created thereby, the like of which
has never been seen before.’ He prophesied with a certain glee an era of
great wars; one wonders whether he would have been happy if he had lived
to see the fulfilment of his prophecy.</p>
<p>He is not, however, a worshipper of the State; far from it. He is a
passionate individualist, a believer in the hero. The misery of a whole
nation, he says, is of less importance than the suffering of a great
individual: ‘The misfortunes of all these small folk do not together
constitute a sum-total, except in the feelings of mighty men.’</p>
<p>Nietzsche is not a nationalist, and shows no excessive admiration for
Germany. He wants an international ruling race, who are to be the lords
of the earth: ‘a new vast aristocracy based upon the most severe
self-discipline, in which the will of philosophical men of power and
artist-tyrants will be stamped upon thousands of years.’</p>
<p>He is also not definitely anti-Semitic, though he thinks Germany
contains as many Jews as it can assimilate, and ought not to permit any
further influx of Jews. He dislikes the New Testament, but not the Old,
of which he speaks in terms of the highest admiration. In justice to
Nietzsche it must be emphasized that many modern developments which have
a certain connection with his general ethical outlook are contrary to
his clearly expressed opinions.</p>
<p>Two applications of his ethic deserve notice: first, his contempt for
women; second, his bitter critique of Christianity.</p>
<p>He is never tired of inveighing against women. In his
pseudo-prophetical book, Thus Spake Zarathustra, he says that women are
not, as yet, capable of friendship; they are still cats, or birds, or at
best cows. ‘Man shall be trained for war and woman for the recreation of
the warrior. All else is folly.’ The recreation of the warrior is to be
of a peculiar sort if one may trust his most emphatic aphorism on this
subject: ‘Thou goest to woman? Do not forget thy whip.’</p>
<p>He is not always quite so fierce, though always equally contemptuous.
In the Will to Power he says: ‘We take pleasure in woman as in a perhaps
daintier, more delicate, and more ethereal kind of creature. What a
treat it is to meet creatures who have only dancing and nonsense and
finery in their minds! They have always been the delight of every tense
and profound male soul.’ However, even these graces are only to be found
in women so long as they are kept in order by manly men; as soon as they
achieve any independence they become intolerable. ‘Woman has so much
cause for shame; in woman there is so much pedantry, superficiality,
schoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and indiscretion
concealed … which has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto
by the fear of man.’ So he says in Beyond Good and Evil, where he adds
that we should think of women as property, as Orientals do. The whole of
his abuse of women is offered as self-evident truth; it is not backed up
by evidence from history or from his own experience, which, so far as
women were concerned, was almost confined to his sister.</p>
<p>Nietzsche’s objection to Christianity is that it caused acceptance of
what he calls ‘slave morality’. It is curious to observe the contrast
between his arguments and those of the French philosophes who preceded
the Revolution. They argued that Christian dogmas are untrue; that
Christianity teaches submission to what is deemed to be the will of God,
whereas self-respecting human beings should not bow before any higher
Power; and that the Christian Churches have become the allies of
tyrants, and are helping the enemies of democracy to deny liberty and
continue to grind the faces of the poor. Nietzsche is not interested in
the metaphysical truth of either Christianity or any other religion;
being convinced that no religion is really true, he judges all religions
entirely by their social effects. He agrees with the philosophes in
objecting to submission to the supposed will of God, but he would
substitute for it the will of earthly ‘artist-tyrants’. Submission is
right, except for these supermen, but not submission to the Christian
God. As for the Christian Churches’ being allies of tyrants and enemies
of democracy, that, he says, is the very reverse of the truth. The
French Revolution and Socialism are, according to him, essentially
identical in spirit with Christianity; to all alike he is opposed, and
for the same reason: that he will not treat all men as equal in any
respect whatever.</p>
<p>Buddhism and Christianity, he says, are both ‘nihilistic’ religions,
in the sense that they deny any ultimate difference of value between one
man and another, but Buddhism is much the less objectionable of the two.
Christianity is degenerative, full of decaying and excremental elements;
its driving force is the revolt of the bungled and botched. This revolt
was begun by the Jews, and brought into Christianity by ‘holy
epileptics’ like St Paul, who had no honesty. ‘The New Testament is the
gospel of a completely ignoble species of man.’ Christianity is the most
fatal and seductive lie that ever existed. No man of note has ever
resembled the Christian ideal; consider for instance the heroes of
Plutarch’s Lives. Christianity is to be condemned for denying the value
of ‘pride, pathos of distance, great responsibility, exuberant spirits,
splendid animalism, the instincts of war and of conquest, the
deification of passion, revenge, anger, voluptuousness, adventure,
knowledge’. All these things are good, and all are said by Christianity
to be bad—so Nietzsche contends.</p>
<p>Christianity, he argues, aims at taming the heart in man, but this is
a mistake. A wild beast has a certain splendour, which it loses when it
is tamed. The criminals with whom Dostoevsky associated were better than
he was, because they were more self-respecting. Nietzsche is nauseated
by repentance and redemption, which he calls a folie circulaire. It is
difficult for us to free ourselves from this way of thinking about human
behaviour: ‘we are heirs to the conscience-vivisection and
self-crucifixion of two thousand years.’ There is a very eloquent
passage about Pascal, which deserves quotation, because it shows
Nietzsche’s objections to Christianity at their best:</p>
<p>‘What is it that we combat in Christianity? That it aims at
destroying the strong, at breaking their spirit, at exploiting their
moments of weariness and debility, at converting their proud assurance
into anxiety and conscience-trouble; that it knows how to poison the
noblest instincts and to infect them with disease, until their strength,
their will to power, turns inwards, against themselves—until the strong
perish through their excessive self-contempt and self-immolation: that
gruesome way of perishing, of which Pascal is the most famous
example.’</p>
<p>In place of the Christian saint Nietzsche wishes to see what he calls
the ‘noble’ man, by no means as a universal type, but as a governing
aristocrat. The ‘noble’ man will be capable of cruelty, and, on
occasion, of what is vulgarly regarded as crime; he will recognize
duties only to equals. He will protect artists and poets and all who
happen to be masters of some skill, but he will do so as himself a
member of a higher order than those who only know how to do something.
From the example of warriors he will learn to associate death with the
interests for which he is fighting; to sacrifice numbers, and take his
cause sufficiently seriously not to spare men; to practise inexorable
discipline; and to allow himself violence and cunning in war. He will
recognize the part played by cruelty in aristocratic excellence: ‘almost
everything that we call “higher culture“ is based upon the
spiritualizing and intensifying of cruelty’. The ‘noble’ man is
essentially the incarnate will to power.</p>
<p>What are we to think of Nietzsche’s doctrines? How far are they true?
Are they in any degree useful? Is there in them anything objective, or
are they the mere power-phantasies of an invalid?</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Nietzsche has had a great influence, not among
technical philosophers, but among people of literary and artistic
culture. It must also be conceded that his prophecies as to the future
have, so far, proved more nearly right than those of liberals or
Socialists. If he is a mere symptom of disease, the disease must be very
widespread in the modern world.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there is a great deal in him that must be dismissed as
merely megalomaniac. Speaking of Spinoza he says: ‘How much of personal
timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse
betray!’ Exactly the same may be said of him, with the less reluctance
since he has not hesitated to say it of Spinoza. It is obvious that in
his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all the men he admires
were military. His opinion of women, like every man’s, is an
objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one
of fear. ‘Forget not thy whip’—but nine women out of ten would get the
whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and
soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks.</p>
<p>He condemns Christian love because he thinks it is an outcome of
fear: I am afraid my neighbour may injure me, and so I assure him that I
love him. If I were stronger and bolder, I should openly display the
contempt for him which of course I feel. It does not occur to Nietzsche
as possible that a man should genuinely feel universal love, obviously
because he himself feels almost universal hatred and fear, which he
would fain disguise as lordly indifference. His ‘noble’ man—who is
himself in day-dreams—is a being wholly devoid of sympathy, ruthless,
cunning, cruel, concerned only with his own power. King Lear, on the
verge of madness, says:</p>
<p>I will do such things—</p>
<p>What they are yet I know not—but they shall be</p>
<p>The terror of the earth.</p>
<p>This is Nietzsche’s philosophy in a nutshell.</p>
<p>It never occurred to Nietzsche that the lust for power, with which he
endows his superman, is itself an outcome of fear. Those who do not fear
their neighbours see no necessity to tyrannize over them. Men who have
conquered fear have not the frantic quality of Nietzsche’s
‘artist-tyrant’ Neros, who try to enjoy music and massacre while their
hearts are filled with dread of the inevitable palace revolution. I will
not deny that, partly as a result of his teaching, the real world has
become very like his nightmare, but that does not make it any the less
horrible.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that there is a certain type of Christian ethic
to which Nietzsche’s strictures can be justly applied. Pascal and
Dostoevsky—his own illustrations—have both something abject in their
virtue. Pascal sacrificed his magnificent mathematical intellect to his
God, thereby attributing to Him a barbarity which was a cosmic
enlargement of Pascal’s morbid mental tortures. Dostoevsky would have
nothing to do with ‘proper pride’; he would sin in order to repent and
to enjoy the luxury of confession. I will not argue the question how far
such aberrations can justly be charged against Christianity, but I will
admit that I agree with Nietzsche in thinking Dostoevsky’s prostration
contemptible. A certain uprightness and pride and even self-assertion of
a sort, I should agree, are elements in the best character; no virtue
which has its roots in fear is much to be admired.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of saints: the saint by nature, and the saint
from fear. The saint by nature has a spontaneous love of mankind; he
does good because to do so gives him happiness. The saint from fear, on
the other hand, like the man who only abstains from theft because of the
police, would be wicked if he were not restrained by the thought of
hell-fire or of his neighbours’ vengeance. Nietzsche can only imagine
the second sort of saint; he is so full of fear and hatred that
spontaneous love of mankind seems to him impossible. He has never
conceived of the man who, with all the fearlessness and stubborn pride
of the superman, nevertheless does not inflict pain because he has no
wish to do so. Does anyone suppose that Lincoln acted as he did from
fear of hell? Yet to Nietzsche Lincoln is abject, Napoleon
magnificent.</p>
<p>It remains to consider the main ethical problem raised by Nietzsche,
namely: should our ethic be aristocratic, or should it, in some sense,
treat all men alike? This is a question which, as I have just stated it,
has no very clear meaning, and obviously, the first step is to try to
make the issue more definite.</p>
<p>We must in the first place try to distinguish an aristocratic ethic
from an aristocratic political theory. A believer in Bentham’s principle
of the greatest happiness of the greatest number has a democratic ethic,
but he may think that the general happiness is best promoted by an
aristocratic form of government. This is not Nietzsche’s position. He
holds that the happiness of common people is no part of the good per se.
All that is good or bad in itself exists only in the superior few; what
happens to the rest is of no account.</p>
<p>The next question is: How are the superior few defined? In practice,
they have usually been a conquering race or a hereditary aristocracy—and
aristocracies have usually been, at least in theory, descendants of
conquering races. I think Nietzsche would accept this definition. ‘No
morality is possible without good birth,’ he tells us. He says that the
noble caste is always at first barbarian, but that every elevation of
Man is due to aristocratic society.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Nietzsche regards the superiority of the
aristocrat as congenital or as due to education and environment. If the
latter, it is difficult to defend the exclusion of others from
advantages for which, ex hypothesi, they are equally qualified. I shall
therefore assume that he regards conquering aristocracies and their
descendants as biologically superior to their subjects, as men are
superior to domestic animals, though in a lesser degree.</p>
<p>What shall we mean by ‘biologically superior’? We shall mean, when
interpreting Nietzsche, that individuals of the superior race, and their
descendants, are more likely to be ‘noble’ in Nietzsche’s sense: they
will have more strength of will, more courage, more impulse towards
power, less sympathy, less fear, and less gentleness. We can now state
Nietzsche’s ethic. I think what follows is a fair analysis of it:</p>
<p>Victors in war, and their descendants, are usually biologically
superior to the vanquished. It is therefore desirable that they should
hold all the power, and should manage affairs exclusively in their own
interests.</p>
<p>There is here still the word ‘desirable’ to be considered. What is
‘desirable’ in Nietzsche’s philosophy? From the outsider’s point of
view, what Nietzsche calls ‘desirable’ is what Nietzsche desires. With
this interpretation, Nietzsche’s doctrine might be stated more simply
and honestly in the one sentence : ‘I wish I had lived in the Athens of
Pericles or the Florence of the Medici.’ But this is not a philosophy;
it is a biographical fact about a certain individual. The word
‘desirable’ is not synonymous with ‘desired by me’; it has some claim,
however shadowy, to legislate universally. A theist may say that what is
desirable is what God desires, but Nietzsche cannot say this. He could
say that he knows what is good by an ethical intuition, but he will not
say this, because it sounds too Kantian. What he can say, as an
expansion of the word ‘desirable’, is this: ‘If men will read my works,
a certain percentage of them will come to share my desires as regards
the organization of society; these men, inspired by the energy and
determination which my philosophy will give them, can preserve and
restore aristocracy, with themselves as aristocrats or (like me)
sycophants of aristocracy. In this way they will achieve a fuller life
than they can have as servants of the people.’</p>
<p>There is another element in Nietzsche, which is closely akin to the
objection urged by ‘rugged individualists’ against trade-unions. In a
fight of all against all, the victor is likely to possess certain
qualities which Nietzsche admires, such as courage, resourcefulness, and
strength of will. But if the men who do not possess these aristocratic
qualities (who are the vast majority) band themselves together, they may
win in spite of their individual inferiority. In this fight of the
collective canaille against the aristocrats, Christianity is the
ideological front, as the French Revolution was the fighting front. We
ought therefore to oppose every kind of union among the individually
feeble, for fear lest their combined power should outweigh that of the
individually strong; on the other hand, we ought to promote union among
the tough and virile elements of the population. The first step towards
the creation of such a union is the preaching of Nietzsche’s philosophy.
It will be seen that it is not easy to preserve the distinction between
ethics and politics.</p>
<p>Suppose we wish—as I certainly do—to find arguments against
Nietzsche’s ethics and politics, what arguments can we find?</p>
<p>There are weighty practical arguments, showing that the attempt to
secure his ends will in fact secure something quite different.
Aristocracies of birth are nowadays discredited; the only practicable
form of aristocracy is an organization like the Fascist or the Nazi
party. Such an organization rouses opposition, and is likely to be
defeated in war; but if it is not defeated it must, before long, become
nothing but a police State, where the rulers live in terror of
assassination, and the heroes are in concentration camps. In such a
community faith and honour are sapped by delation, and the would-be
aristocracy of supermen degenerates into a clique of trembling
poltroons.</p>
<p>These, however, are arguments for our time; they would not have held
good in past ages, when aristocracy was unquestioned. The Egyptian
government was conducted on Nietzschean principles for several
millennia. The governments of almost all large States were aristocratic
until the American and the French Revolutions. We have therefore to ask
ourselves whether there is any good reason for preferring democracy to a
form of government which has had such a long and successful history—or
rather, since we are concerned with philosophy, not politics, whether
there are objective grounds for rejecting the ethic by which Nietzsche
supports aristocracy.</p>
<p>The ethical, as opposed to the political, question is one as to
sympathy. Sympathy, in the sense of being made unhappy by the suffering
of others, is to some extent natural to human beings; young children are
troubled when they hear other children crying. But the development of
this feeling is very different in different people. Some find pleasure
in the infliction of torture; others, like Buddha, feel that they cannot
be completely happy so long as any living thing is suffering. Most
people divide mankind emotionally into friends and enemies, feeling
sympathy for the former, but not for the latter. An ethic such as that
of Christianity or Buddhism has its emotional basis in universal
sympathy; Nietzsche’s, in a complete absence of sympathy. (He frequently
preaches against sympathy, and in this respect one feels that he has no
difficulty in obeying his own precepts. The question is: If Buddha and
Nietzsche were confronted, could either produce any argument that ought
to appeal to the impartial listener? I am not thinking of political
arguments. We can imagine them appearing before the Almighty, as in the
first chapter of the Book of Job, and offering advice as to the sort of
world He should create. What could either say?</p>
<p>Buddha would open the argument by speaking of the lepers, outcast and
miserable; the poor, toiling with aching limbs and barely kept alive by
scanty nourishment; the wounded in battle, dying in slow agony; the
orphans, illtreated by cruel guardians; and even the most successful
haunted by the thought of failure and death. From all this load of
sorrow, he would say, a way of salvation must be found, and salvation
can only come through love.</p>
<p>Nietzsche, whom only Omnipotence could restrain from interrupting,
would burst out when his turn came: ‘Good heavens, man, you must learn
to be of tougher fibre. Why go about snivelling because trivial people
suffer? Or, for that matter, because great men suffer? Trivial people
suffer trivially, great men suffer greatly, and great sufferings are not
to be regretted, because they are noble. Your ideal is a purely negative
one, absence of suffering, which can be completely secured by
non-existence. I, on the other hand, have positive ideals: I admire
Alcibiades, and the Emperor Frederick II, and Napoleon. For the sake of
such men, any misery is worth while. I appeal to You, Lord, as the
greatest of creative artists, do not let Your artistic impulses be
curbed by the degenerate fear-ridden maunderings of this wretched
psychopath.’</p>
<p>Buddha, who in the courts of Heaven has learnt all history since his
death, and has mastered science with delight in the knowledge and sorrow
at the use to which men have put it, replies with calm urbanity: ‘You
are mistaken, Professor Nietzsche, in thinking my ideal a purely
negative one. True, it includes a negative element, the absence of
suffering; but it has in addition quite as much that is positive as is
to be found in your doctrine. Though I have no special admiration for
Alcibiades and Napoleon, I, too, have my heroes: my successor Jesus,
because he told men to love their enemies; the men who discovered how to
master the forces of nature and secure food with less labour; the
medical men who have shown how to diminish disease; the poets and
artists and musicians who have caught glimpses of the Divine beatitude.
Love and knowledge and delight in beauty are not negations; they are
enough to fill the lives of the greatest men that have ever lived.’</p>
<p>‘All the same,’ Nietzsche replies, ‘your world would be insipid. You
should study Heraclitus, whose works survive complete in the celestial
library. Your love is compassion, which is elicited by pain; your truth,
if you are honest, is unpleasant, and only to be known through
suffering; and as to beauty, what is more beautiful than the tiger, who
owes his splendour to his fierceness? No, if the Lord should decide for
your world, I fear we should all die of boredom.’</p>
<p>‘You might,’ Buddha replies, ‘because you love pain, and your love of
life is a sham. But those who really love life would be happy as no one
can be happy in the world as it is.’</p>
<p>For my part, I agree with Buddha as I have imagined him. But I do not
know how to prove that he is right by any arguments such as can be used
in a mathematical or a scientific question. I dislike Nietzsche because
he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into a
duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory
is cleverness in causing men to die. But I think the ultimate argument
against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally
self-consistent ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal
to the emotions. Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive
power to all that I desire as regards the world. His followers have had
their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.</p>
