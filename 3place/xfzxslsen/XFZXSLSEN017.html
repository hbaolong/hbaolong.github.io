<h4 id="platos-utopia">14 PLATO’S UTOPIA</h4>
<p>Plato’s most important dialogue, the Republic, consists, broadly, of
three parts. The first (to near the end of Book V) consists in the
construction of an ideal commonwealth; it is the earliest of
Utopias.</p>
<p>One of the conclusions arrived at is that rulers must be
philosophers. Books VI and VII are concerned to define the word
‘philosopher’. This discussion constitutes the second section.</p>
<p>The third section consists mainly of a discussion of various kinds of
actual constitutions and of their merits and defects.</p>
<p>The nominal purpose of the Republic is to define ‘justice’. But at an
early stage it is decided that, since everything is easier to see in the
large than in the small, it will be better to inquire what makes a just
State than what makes a just individual. And since justice must be among
the attributes of the best imaginable State, such a State is first
delineated, and then it is decided which of its perfections is to be
called ‘justice’.</p>
<p>Let us first describe Plato’s Utopia in its broad outlines, and then
consider points that arise by the way.</p>
<p>Plato begins by deciding that the citizens are to be divided into
three classes: the common people, the soldiers, and the guardians. The
last, alone, are to have political power. There are to be much fewer of
them than of the other two classes. In the first instance, it seems,
they are to be chosen by the legislator; after that, they will usually
succeed by heredity, but in exceptional cases a promising child may be
promoted from one of the inferior classes, while among the children of
guardians a child or young man who is unsatisfactory may be
degraded.</p>
<p>The main problem, as Plato perceives, is to insure that the guardians
shall carry out the intentions of the legislator. For this purpose he
has various proposals, educational, economic, biological, and religious.
It is not always clear how far these proposals apply to other classes
than the guardians; it is clear that some of them apply to the soldiers,
but in the main Plato is concerned only with the guardians, who are to
be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in
the States of the Church until 1870, and the Communist Party in the
U.S.S.R. at the present day.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is education. This is divided into two
parts, music and gymnastics. Each has a wider meaning than at present:
‘music’ means everything that is in the province of the muses, and
‘gymnastics’ means everything concerned with physical training and
fitness. ‘Music’ is almost as wide as what we should call ‘culture’, and
‘gymnastics’ is somewhat wider than what we call ‘athletics’.</p>
<p>Culture is to be devoted to making men gentlemen, in the sense which,
largely owing to Plato, is familiar in England. The Athens of his day
was, in one respect, analogous to England in the nineteenth century:
there was in each an aristocracy enjoying wealth and social prestige,
but having no monopoly of political power; and in each the aristocracy
had to secure as much power as it could by means of impressive
behaviour. In Plato’s Utopia, however, the aristocracy rules
unchecked.</p>
<p>Gravity, decorum and courage seem to be the qualities mainly to be
cultivated in education. There is to be a rigid censorship from very
early years over the literature to which the young have access and the
music they are allowed to hear. Mothers and nurses are to tell their
children only authorized stories. Homer and Hesiod are not to be
allowed, for a number of reasons. First they represent the gods as
behaving badly on occasion, which is unedifying; the young must be
taught that evils never come from the gods, for God is not the author of
all things, but only of good things. Second, there are things in Homer
and Hesiod which are calculated to make their readers fear death,
whereas everything ought to be done in education to make young people
willing to die in battle. Our boys must be taught to consider slavery
worse than death, and therefore they must have no stories of good men
weeping and wailing, even for the death of friends. Third, decorum
demands that there should never be loud laughter, and yet Homer speaks
of ‘inextinguishable laughter among the blessed gods’. How is a
schoolmaster to reprove mirth effectively, if boys can quote this
passage? Fourth, there are passages in Homer praising rich feasts, and
others describing the lusts of the gods; such passages discourage
temperance. (Dean Inge, a true Platonist, objected to a line in a
well-known hymn: ‘The shout of them that triumph, the song of them that
feast,’ which occurs in a description of the joys of heaven.) Then there
must be no stories in which the wicked are happy or the good unhappy;
the moral effect on tender minds might be most unfortunate. On all these
counts, the poets are to be condemned.</p>
<p>Plato passes on to a curious argument about the drama. The good man,
he says, ought to be unwilling to imitate a bad man; now most plays
contain villains; therefore the dramatist, and the actor who plays the
villain’s part, have to imitate people guilty of various crimes. Not
only criminals, but women, slaves, and inferiors generally, ought not to
be imitated by superior men. (In Greece, as in Elizabethan England,
women’s parts were acted by men.) Plays, therefore, if permissible at
all, must contain no characters except faultless male heroes of good
birth. The impossibility of this is so evident that Plato decides to
banish all dramatists from his city:</p>
<p>When any of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so clever that they
can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal to exhibit
himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and
holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that in our State
such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not allow them. And
so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a garland of wool upon
his head, we shall send him away to another city.</p>
<p>Next we come to the censorship of music (in the modern sense). The
Lydian and Ionian harmonies are to be forbidden, the first because it
expresses sorrow, the second because it is relaxed. Only the Dorian (for
courage) and the Phrygian (for temperance) are to be allowed.
Permissible rhythms must be simple, and such as are expressive of a
courageous and harmonious life.</p>
<p>The training of the body is to be very austere. No one is to eat
fish, or meat cooked otherwise than roasted, and there must be no sauces
or confectionery. People brought up on his regimen, he says, will have
no need of doctors.</p>
<p>Up to a certain age, the young are to see no ugliness or vice. But at
a suitable moment, they must be exposed to ‘enchantments’, both in the
shape of terrors that must not terrify, and of bad pleasures that must
not seduce the will. Only after they have withstood these tests will
they be judged fit to be guardians.</p>
<p>Young boys, before they are grown up, should see war, though they
should not themselves fight.</p>
<p>As for economics: Plato proposes a thoroughgoing communism for the
guardians, and (I think) also for the soldiers, though this is not very
clear. The guardians are to have small houses and simple food; they are
to live as in a camp, dining together in companies; they are to have no
private property beyond what is absolutely necessary. Gold and silver
are to be forbidden. Though not rich, there is no reason why they should
not be happy; but the purpose of the city is the good of the whole, not
the happiness of one class. Both wealth and poverty are harmful, and in
Plato’s city neither will exist. There is a curious argument about war,
that it will be easy to purchase allies, since our city will not want
any share in the spoils of victory.</p>
<p>With feigned unwillingness, the Platonic Socrates proceeds to apply
his communism to the family. Friends, he says, should have all things in
common, including women and children. He admits that this presents
difficulties, but thinks them not insuperable. First of all, girls are
to have exactly the same education as boys, learning music, gymnastics,
and the art of war along with the boys. Women are to have complete
equality with men in all respects. ‘The same education which makes a man
a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original
nature is the same.’ No doubt there are differences between men and
women, but they have nothing to do with politics. Some women are
philosophic, and suitable as guardians; some are warlike, and could make
good soldiers.</p>
<p>The legislator, having selected the guardians, some men and some
women, will ordain that they shall all share common houses and common
meals. Marriage, as we know it, will be radically transformed.1 At
certain festivals, brides and bridegrooms, in such numbers as are
required to keep the population constant, will be brought together, by
lot, as they will be taught to believe; but in fact the rulers of the
city will manipulate the lots on eugenic principles. They will arrange
that the best sires shall have the most children. All children will be
taken away from their parents at birth, and great care will be taken
that no parents shall know who are their children, and no children shall
know who are their parents. Deformed children, and children of inferior
parents, ‘will be put away in some mysterious unknown place, as they
ought to be’. Children arising from unions not sanctioned by the State
are to be considered illegitimate. Mothers are to be between twenty and
forty, fathers between twenty-five and fifty-five. Outside these ages,
intercourse is to be free, but abortion or infanticide is to be
compulsory. In the ‘marriages’ arranged by the State, the people
concerned have no voice; they are to be actuated by the thought of their
duty to the State, not by any of those common emotions that the banished
poets used to celebrate.</p>
<p>Since no one knows who his parents are, he is to call every one
‘father’ whose age is such that he might be his father, and similarly as
regards ‘mother’ and ‘brother’ and ‘sister’. (This sort of thing happens
among some savages, and used to puzzle missionaries.) There is to be no
marriage between a ‘father’ and ‘daughter’ or ‘mother’ and ‘son’; in
general, but not absolutely, marriages of ‘brother’ and ‘sister’ are to
be prevented. (I think if Plato had thought this out more carefully he
would have found that he had prohibited</p>
<p>all marriages, except the ‘brother-sister’ marriages which he regards
as rare exceptions.)</p>
<p>It is supposed that the sentiments at present attached to the words
‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘son’, and ‘daughter’ will still attach to them
under Plato’s new arrangements; a young man, for instance, will not
strike an old man, because he might be striking his father.</p>
<p>The advantage sought is, of course, to minimize private possessive
emotions, and so remove obstacles to the domination of public spirit, as
well as to acquiescence in the absence of private property. It was
largely motives of a similar kind that led to the celibacy of the
clergy.2</p>
<p>I come last to the theological aspect of the system. I am not
thinking of the accepted Greek gods, but of certain myths which the
government is to inculcate. Lying, Plato says explicitly, is to be a
prerogative of the government, just as giving medicine is of physicians.
The government, as we have already seen, is to deceive people in
pretending to arrange marriages by lot, but this is not a religious
matter.</p>
<p>There is to be ‘one royal lie,’ which, Plato hopes, may deceive the
rulers, but will at any rate deceive the rest of the city. This ‘lie’ is
set forth in considerable detail. The most important part of it is the
dogma that God has created men of three kinds, the best made of gold,
the second best of silver, and the common herd of brass and iron. Those
made of gold are fit to be guardians; those made of silver should be
soldiers; the others should do the manual work. Usually, but by no means
always, children will belong to the same grade as their parents; when
they do not, they must be promoted or degraded accordingly. It is
thought hardly possible to make the present generation believe this
myth, but the next, and all subsequent generations, can be so educated
as not to doubt it.</p>
<p>Plato is right in thinking that belief in this myth could be
generated in two generations. The Japanese have been taught since 1868
that the Mikado is descended from the sun-goddess, and that Japan was
created earlier than the rest of the world. Any university professor,
who, even in a learned work, throws doubt on these dogmas, is dismissed
for un-Japanese activities. What Plato does not seem to realize is that
the compulsory acceptance of such myths is incompatible with philosophy,
and involves a kind of education which stunts intelligence.</p>
<p>The definition of ‘justice’, which is the nominal goal of the whole
discussion, is reached in Book IV. It consists, we are told, in
everybody doing his own work and not being a busybody: the city is just
when trader, auxiliary, and guardian, each does his own job without
interfering with that of other classes.</p>
<p>That everybody should mind his own business is no doubt an admirable
precept, but it hardly corresponds to what a modern would naturally call
‘justice’. The Greek word so translated corresponded to a concept which
was very important in Greek thought, but for which we have no exact
equivalent. It is worth while to recall that Anaximander said:</p>
<p>Into that from which things take their rise they pass away once more,
as is ordained; for they make reparation and satisfaction to one another
for their injustice according to the appointed time.</p>
<p>Before philosophy began, the Greeks had a theory or feeling about the
universe, which may be called religious or ethical. According to this
theory, every person and every thing has his or its appointed place and
appointed function. This does not depend upon the fiat of Zeus, for Zeus
himself is subject to the same kind of law as governs others. The theory
is connected with the idea of fate or necessity. It applies emphatically
to the heavenly bodies. But where there is vigour, there is a tendency
to overstep just bounds; hence arises strife. Some kind of impersonal
super-Olympian law punishes hubris, and restores the eternal order which
the aggressor sought to violate. This whole outlook, originally,
perhaps, scarcely conscious, passed over into philosophy; it is to be
found alike in cosmologies of strife, such as those of Heraclitus and
Empedocles, and in monistic doctrines such as that of Parmenides. It is
the source of the belief both in natural and in human law, and it
clearly underlies Plato’s conception of justice.</p>
<p>The word ‘justice’, as still used in the law, is more similar to
Plato’s conception than it is as used in political speculation. Under
the influence of democratic theory, we have come to associate justice
with equality, while for Plato it has no such implication. ‘Justice’, in
the sense in which it is almost synonymous with ‘law’—as when we speak
of ‘courts of justice’—is concerned mainly with property rights, which
have nothing to do with equality. The first suggested definition of
‘justice’, at the beginning of the Republic, is that it consists in
paying debts. This definition is soon abandoned as inadequate, but
something of it remains at the end.</p>
<p>There are several points to be noted about Plato’s definition. First,
it makes it possible to have inequalities of power and privilege without
justice. The guardians are to have all the power, because they are the
wisest members of the community; injustice would only occur, on Plato’s
definition, if there were men in the other classes who were wiser than
some of the guardians. That is why Plato provides for promotion and
degradation of citizens, although he thinks that the double advantage of
birth and education will, in most cases, make the children of guardians
superior to the children of others. If there were a more exact science
of government, and more certainty of men following its precepts, there
would be much to be said for Plato’s system. No one thinks it unjust to
put the best men into a football team, although they acquire thereby a
great superiority. If football were managed as democratically as the
Athenian government the students to play for their university would be
chosen by lot. But in matters of government it is difficult to know who
has the most skill, and very far from certain that a politician will use
his skill in the public interest rather than in his own or in that of
his class or party or creed.</p>
<p>The next point is that Plato’s definition of ‘justice’ presupposes a
State organized either on traditional lines, or, like his own, so as to
realize, in its totality, some ethical ideal. Justice, we are told,
consists in every man doing his own job. But what is a man’s job? In a
State which, like ancient Egypt or the kingdom of the Incas, remains
unchanged generation after generation, a man’s job is his father’s job,
and no question arises. But in Plato’s State no man has any legal
father. His job, therefore, must be decided either by his own tastes or
by the State’s judgment as to his aptitudes. The latter is obviously
what Plato would desire. But some kinds of work, though highly skilled,
may be deemed pernicious; Plato takes this view of poetry, and I should
take it of the work of Napoleon. The purposes of the Government,
therefore, are essential in determining what is a man’s job. Although
all the rulers are to be philosophers, there are to be no innovations: a
philosopher is to be, for all time, a man who understands and agrees
with Plato.</p>
<p>When we ask: what will Plato’s Republic achieve? the answer is rather
humdrum. It will achieve success in wars against roughly equal
populations, and it will secure a livelihood for a certain small number
of people. It will almost certainly produce no art or science, because
of its rigidity; in this respect, as in others, it will be like Sparta.
In spite of all the fine talk, skill in war and enough to eat is all
that will be achieved. Plato had lived through famine and defeat in
Athens; perhaps, subconsciously, he thought the avoidance of these evils
the best that statesmanship could accomplish.</p>
<p>A Utopia, if seriously intended, obviously must embody the ideals of
its creator. Let us consider, for a moment, what we can mean by
‘ideals’. In the first place, they are desired by those who believe in
them; but they are not desired quite in the same way as a man desires
personal comforts, such as food and shelter. What makes the difference
between an ‘ideal’ and an ordinary object of desire is that the former
is impersonal; it is something having (at least ostensibly) no special
reference to the ego of the man who feels the desire, and therefore
capable, theoretically, of being desired by everybody. Thus we might
define an ‘ideal’ as something desired, not egocentric, and such that
the person desiring it wishes that every one else also desired it. I may
wish that everybody had enough to eat, that everybody felt kindly
towards everybody, and so on, and if I wish anything of this kind I
shall also wish others to wish it. In this way, I can build up what
looks like an impersonal ethic, although in fact it rests upon the
personal basis of my own desires—for the desire remains mine, even when
what is desired has no reference to myself. For example, one man may
wish that everybody understood science, and another that everybody
appreciated art; it is a personal difference between the two men that
produces this difference in their desires.</p>
<p>The personal element becomes apparent as soon as controversy is
involved. Suppose some man says: ‘You are wrong to wish everybody to be
happy; you ought to desire the happiness of Germans and the unhappiness
of everyone else.’ Here ‘ought’ may be taken to mean that that is what
the speaker wishes me to desire. I might retort that, not being German,
it is psychologically impossible for me to desire the unhappiness of all
non-Germans; but this answer seems inadequate.</p>
<p>Again, there may be a conflict of purely impersonal ideals.
Nietzsche’s hero differs from a Christian saint, yet both are
impersonally admired, the one by Nietzscheans, the other by Christians.
How are we to decide between the two except by means of our own desires?
Yet, if there is nothing further, an ethical disagreement can only be
decided by emotional appeals, or by force—in the ultimate resort, by
war. On questions of fact, we can appeal to science and scientific
methods of observation; but on ultimate questions of ethics there seems
to be nothing analogous. Yet, if this is really the case, ethical
disputes resolve themselves into contests for power—including propaganda
power.</p>
<p>This point of view, in a crude form, is put forth in the first book
of the Republic by Thrasymachus, who, like almost all the characters in
Plato’s dialogues, was a real person. He was a Sophist from Chalcedon,
and a famous teacher of rhetoric; he appeared in the first comedy of
Aristophanes, 427 B.C. After Socrates has, for some time, been amiably
discussing justice with an old man named Cephalus, and with Plato’s
elder brothers Glaucon and Adeimantus, Thrasymachus, who has been
listening with growing impatience, breaks in with a vehement protest
against such childish nonsense. He proclaims emphatically that ‘justice
is nothing else than the interest of the stronger’.</p>
<p>This point of view is refuted by Socrates with quibbles; it is never
fairly faced. It raises the fundamental question in ethics and politics,
namely: Is there any standard of ‘good’ and ‘bad’, except what the man
using these words desires? If there is not, many of the consequences
drawn by Thrasymachus seem unescapable. Yet how are we to say that there
is?</p>
<p>At this point, religion has, at first sight, a simple answer. God
determines what is good and what bad; the man whose will is in harmony
with the will of God is a good man. Yet this answer is not quite
orthodox. Theologians say that God is good, and this implies that there
is a standard of goodness which is independent of God’s will. We are
thus forced to face the question: Is there objective truth or falsehood
in such a statement as ‘pleasure is good’, in the same sense as in such
a statement as ‘snow is white’?</p>
<p>To answer this question, a very long discussion would be necessary.
Some may think that we can, for practical purposes, evade the
fundamental issue, and say: ‘I do not know what is meant by “objective
truth“, but I shall consider a statement “true“ if all, or virtually
all, of those who have investigated it are agreed in upholding it.’ In
this sense, it is ‘true’ that snow is white, that Caesar was
assassinated, that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, and so on.
We are then faced with a question of fact: are there any similarly
agreed statements in ethics? If there are, they can be made the basis
both for rules of private conduct, and for a theory of politics. If
there are not, we are driven in practice, whatever may be the
philosophic truth, to a contest by force or propaganda or both, whenever
an irreconcilable ethical difference exists between powerful groups.</p>
<p>For Plato, this question does not really exist. Although his dramatic
sense leads him to state the position of Thrasymachus forcibly, he is
quite unaware of its strength, and allows himself to be grossly unfair
in arguing against it. Plato is convinced that there is ‘the Good’, and
that its nature can be ascertained; when people disagree about it, one,
at least, is making an intellectual error, just as much as if the
disagreement were a scientific one on some matter of fact.</p>
<p>The difference between Plato and Thrasymachus is very important, but
for the historian of philosophy it is one to be only noted, not decided.
Plato thinks he can prove that his ideal Republic is good; a democrat
who accepts the objectivity of ethics may think that he can prove the
Republic bad; but anyone who agrees with Thrasymachus will say: ‘There
is no question of proving or disproving; the only question is whether
you like the kind of State that Plato desires. If you do, it is good for
you; if you do not, it is bad for you. If many do and many do not, the
decision cannot be made by reason, but only by force, actual or
concealed.’ This is one of the issues in philosophy that are still open;
on each side there are men who command respect. But for a very long time
the opinion that Plato advocated remained almost undisputed.</p>
<p>It should be observed, further, that the view which substitutes the
consensus of opinion for an objective standard has certain consequences
that few would accept. What are we to say of scientific innovators like
Galileo, who advocate an opinion with which few agree, but finally win
the support of almost everybody? They do so by means of arguments, not
by emotional appeals or state propaganda or the use of force. This
implies a criterion other than the general opinion. In ethical matters,
there is something analogous in the case of the great religious
teachers. Christ taught that it is not wrong to pluck ears of corn on
the Sabbath, but that it is wrong to hate your enemies. Such ethical
innovations obviously imply some standard other than majority opinion,
but the standard, whatever it is, is not objective fact, as in a
scientific question. This problem is a difficult one, and I do not
profess to be able to solve it. For the present, let us be content to
note it.</p>
<p>Plato’s Republic, unlike modern Utopias, was perhaps intended to be
actually founded. This was not so fantastic or impossible as it might
naturally seem to us. Many of its provisions, including some that we
should have thought quite impracticable, were actually realized at
Sparta. The rule of philosophers had been attempted by Pythagoras, and
in Plato’s time Archytas the Pythagorean was politically influential in
Taras (the modern Taranto) when Plato visited Sicily and southern Italy.
It was a common practice for cities to employ a sage to draw up their
laws; Solon had done this for Athens, and Protagoras for Thurii.
Colonies, in those days, were completely free from control by their
parent cities, and it would have been quite feasible for a band of
Platonists to establish the Republic on the shores of Spain or Gaul.
Unfortunately chance led Plato to Syracuse, a great commercial city
engaged in desperate wars with Carthage; in such an atmosphere, no
philosopher could have achieved much. In the next generation, the rise
of Macedonia had made all small States antiquated, and had brought about
the futility of all political experiments in miniature.</p>
