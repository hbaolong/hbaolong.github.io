<h4 id="hume">17 HUME</h4>
<p>David Hume (1711–76) is one of the most important among philosophers,
because he developed to its logical conclusion the empirical philosophy
of Locke and Berkeley, and by making it self-consistent made it
incredible. He represents, in a certain sense, a dead end: in his
direction, it is impossible to go further. To refute him has been, ever
since he wrote, a favourite pastime among metaphysicians. For my part, I
find none of their refutations convincing; nevertheless, I cannot but
hope that something less sceptical than Hume’s system may be
discoverable.</p>
<p>His chief philosophical work, the Treatise of Human Nature, was
written while he was living in France during the years 1734 to 1737. The
first two volumes were published in 1739, the third in 1740. He was a
very young man, not yet in his thirties; he was not well known, and his
conclusions were such as almost all schools would find unwelcome. He
hoped for vehement attacks, which he would meet with brilliant retorts.
Instead, no one noticed the book; as he says himself, ‘it fell dead-born
from the press’. ‘But,’ he adds, ‘being naturally of a cheerful and
sanguine temper, I very soon recovered from the blow.’ He devoted
himself to the writing of essays, of which he produced the first volume
in 1741. In 1744 he made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a
professorship at Edinburgh; having failed in this, he became first tutor
to a lunatic and then secretary to a general. Fortified by these
credentials, he ventured again into philosophy. He shortened the
Treatise by leaving out the best parts and most of the reasons for his
conclusions; the result was the Inquiry into Human Understanding, for a
long time much better known than the Treatise. It was this book that
awakened Kant from his ‘dogmatic slumbers’; he does not appear to have
known the Treatise.</p>
<p>He wrote also Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, which he kept
unpublished during his lifetime. By his direction, they were published
posthumously in 1779. His Essay on Miracles, which became famous,
maintains that there can never be adequate historical evidence for such
events.</p>
<p>His History of England, published in 1755 and following years,
devoted itself to proving the superiority of Tories to Whigs and of
Scotchmen to Englishmen; he did not consider history worthy of
philosophic detachment. He visited Paris in 1763, and was made much of
by the philosophes. Unfortunately, he formed a friendship with Rousseau,
and had a famous quarrel with him. Hume behaved with admirable
forbearance, but Rousseau, who suffered from persecution mania, insisted
upon a violent breach.</p>
<p>Hume has described his own character in a self-obituary, or ‘funeral
oration’, as he calls it: ‘I was a man of mild dispositions, of command
of temper, of an open, social and cheerful humour, capable of
attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in
all my passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never
soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments.’ All this
is borne out by everything that is known of him.</p>
<p>Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature is divided into three books, dealing
respectively with the understanding, the passions, and morals. What is
important and novel in his doctrines is in the first book, to which I
shall confine myself.</p>
<p>He begins with the distinction between ‘impressions’ and ‘ideas’.
These are two kinds of perceptions, of which impressions are those that
have more force and violence. ‘By ideas I mean the faint images of these
in thinking and reasoning.’ Ideas, at least when simple, are like
impressions, but fainter. ‘Every simple idea has a simple impression,
which resembles it; and every simple impression a correspondent idea.’
‘All our simple ideas in their first appearance are derived from simple
impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly
represent.’ Complex ideas, on the other hand, need not resemble
impressions. We can imagine a winged horse without having ever seen one,
but the constituents of this complex idea are all derived from
impressions. The proof that impressions come first is derived from
experience; for example, a man born blind has no ideas of colours. Among
ideas, those that retain a considerable degree of the vivacity of the
original impressions belong to memory, the others to imagination.</p>
<p>There is a section (Book I, part i, sec. vii) ‘Of Abstract Ideas’,
which opens with a paragraph of emphatic agreement with Berkeley’s
doctrine that ‘all general ideas are nothing but particular ones,
annexed to a certain term, which gives them a more extensive
significance, and makes them recall upon occasion other individuals,
which are similar to them.’ He contends that, when we have an idea of a
man, it has all the particularity that the impression of a man has. ‘The
mind cannot form any notion of quantity or quality without forming a
precise notion of degrees of each.’ ‘Abstract ideas are in themselves
individual, however they may become general in their representation.’
This theory, which is a modern form of nominalism, has two defects, one
logical, the other psychological. To begin with the logical objection:
‘When we have found a resemblance among several objects,’ Hume says, ‘we
apply the same name to all of them.’ Every nominalist would agree. But
in fact a common name, such as ‘cat’, is just as unreal as the universal
CAT is. The nominalist solution of the problem of universals thus fails
through being insufficiently drastic in the application of its own
principles; it mistakenly applies these principles only to ‘things’, and
not also to words.</p>
<p>The psychological objection is more serious, at least in connection
with Hume. The whole theory of ideas as copies of impressions, as he
sets it forth, suffers from ignoring vagueness. When, for example, I
have seen a flower of a certain colour, and I afterwards call up an
image of it, the image is lacking in precision, in this sense, that
there are several closely similar shades of colour of which it might be
an image, or ‘idea’, in Hume’s terminology. It is not true that ‘the
mind cannot form any notion of quantity or quality without forming a
precise notion of degrees of each.’ Suppose you have seen a man whose
height is six feet one inch. You retain an image of him, but it probably
would fit a man half an inch taller or shorter. Vagueness is different
from generality, but has some of the same characteristics. By not
noticing it, Hume runs into unnecessary difficulties, for instance, as
to the possibility of imagining a shade of colour you have never seen,
which is intermediate between two closely similar shades that you have
seen. If these two are sufficiently similar, any image you can form will
be equally applicable to both of them and to the intermediate shade.
When Hume says that ideas are derived from impressions which they
exactly represent he goes beyond what is psychologically true.</p>
<p>Hume banished the conception of substance from psychology, as
Berkeley had banished it from physics. There is, he says, no impression
of self, and therefore no idea of self (Book I, part iv, sec. vi). ‘For
my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always
stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light
or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch myself at any
time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the
perception.’ There may, he ironically concedes, be some philosophers who
can perceive their selves; ‘but setting aside some metaphysicians of
this kind, I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are
nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which
succeed each other with inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual
flux and movement’.</p>
<p>This repudiation of the idea of the Self is of great importance. Let
us see exactly what it maintains, and how far it is valid. To begin
with, the Self, if there is such a thing, is never perceived, and
therefore we can have no idea of it. If this argument is to be accepted,
it must be carefully stated. No man perceives his own brain, yet, in an
important sense, he has an ‘idea’ of it. Such ‘ideas’, which are
inferences from perceptions, are not among the logically basic stock of
ideas; they are complex and descriptive—this must be the case if Hume is
right in his principle that all simple ideas are derived from
impressions, and if this principle is rejected, we are forced back on
‘innate’ ideas. Using modern terminology, we may say: Ideas of
unperceived things or occurrences can always be defined in terms of
perceived things or occurrences, and therefore, by substituting the
definition for the term defined, we can always state that we know
empirically without introducing any unperceived things or occurrences.
As regards our present problem, all psychological knowledge can be
stated without introducing the ‘Self’. Further, the ‘Self’, as defined
can be nothing but a bundle of perceptions, not a new simple ‘thing’. In
this I think that any thoroughgoing empiricist must agree with Hume.</p>
<p>It does not follow that there is no simple Self; it only follows that
we cannot know whether there is or not, and that the Self, except as a
‘bundle’ of perceptions, cannot enter into any part of our knowledge.
This conclusion is important in metaphysics, as getting rid of the last
surviving use of ‘substance’. It is important in theology, as abolishing
all supposed knowledge of the ‘soul’. It is important in the analysis of
knowledge, since it shows that the category of subject and object is not
fundamental. In this matter of the ego Hume made an important advance on
Berkeley.</p>
<p>The most important part of the whole Treatise is the section called
‘Of Knowledge and Probability’. Hume does not mean by ‘probability’ the
sort of knowledge contained in the mathematical theory of probability,
such as that the chance of throwing double sixes with two dice is one
thirty-sixth. This knowledge is not itself probable in any special
sense; it has as much certainty as knowledge can have. What Hume is
concerned with is uncertain knowledge, such as is obtained from
empirical data by inferences that are not demonstrative. This includes
all our knowledge as to the future, and as to unobserved portions of the
past and present. In fact, it includes everything except, on the one
hand, direct observation, and, on the other, logic and mathematics. The
analysis of such ‘probable’ knowledge led Hume to certain sceptical
conclusions, which are equally difficult to refute and to accept. The
result was a challenge to philosophers, which, in my opinion, has still
not been adequately met.</p>
<p>Hume begins by distinguishing seven kinds of philosophical relation:
resemblance, identity, relations of time and place, proportion in
quantity or number, degrees in any quality, contrariety, and causation.
These, he says, may be divided into two kinds: those that depend only on
the ideas, and those that can be changed without any change in the
ideas. Of the first kind are resemblance, contrariety, degrees in
quality, and proportions in quantity or number. But spatio-temporal and
causal relations are of the second kind. Only relations of the first
kind give certain knowledge; our knowledge concerning the others is only
probable. Algebra and arithmetic are the only sciences in which we can
carry on a long chain of reasoning without losing certainty. Geometry is
not so certain as algebra and arithmetic, because we cannot be sure of
the truth of its axioms. It is a mistake to suppose, as many
philosophers do, that the ideas of mathematics ‘must be comprehended by
a pure and intellectual view, of which the superior faculties of the
soul are alone capable’. The falsehood of this view is evident, says
Hume, as soon as we remember that ‘all our ideas are copied from our
impressions’.</p>
<p>The three relations that depend not only on ideas are identity,
spatio-temporal relations, and causation. In the first two, the mind
does not go beyond what is immediately present to the senses.
(Spatio-temporal relations, Hume holds, can be perceived, and can form
parts of impressions.) Causation alone enables us to infer some thing or
occurrence from some other thing or occurrence: “‘Tis only causation,
which produces such a connexion, as to give us assurance from the
existence or action of one object, that ’twas followed or preceded by
any other existence or action.’</p>
<p>A difficulty arises from Hume’s contention that there is no such
thing as an impression of a causal relation. We can perceive, by mere
observation of A and B, that A is above B, or to the right of B, but not
that A causes B. In the past, the relation of causation had been more or
less assimilated to that of ground and consequent in logic, but this,
Hume rightly perceived, was a mistake.</p>
<p>In the Cartesian philosophy, as in that of the Scholastics, the
connection of cause and effect was supposed to be necessary, as logical
connections are necessary. The first really serious challenge to this
view came from Hume, with whom the modern philosophy of causation
begins. He, in common with almost all philosophers down to and including
Bergson, supposes the law to state that there are propositions of the
form ‘A causes B’, where A and B are classes of events; the fact that
such laws do not occur in any well-developed science appears to be
unknown to philosophers. But much of what they have said can be
translated so as to be applicable to causal laws such as do occur; we
may, therefore, ignore this point for the present.</p>
<p>Hume begins by observing that the power by which one subject produces
another is not discoverable from the ideas of the two objects, and that
we can therefore only know cause and effect from experience, not from
reasoning or reflection. The statement ‘what begins must have a cause’,
he says, is not one that has intuitive certainty, like the statements of
logic. As he puts it: ‘There is no object, which implies the existence
of any other if we consider these objects in themselves, and never look
beyond the ideas which we form of them.’ Hume argues from this that it
must be experience that gives knowledge of cause and effect, but that it
cannot be merely the experience of the two events A and B which are in a
causal relation to each other. It must be experience, because the
connection is not logical; and it cannot be merely the experience of the
particular events A and B, since we can discover nothing in A by itself
which should lead to produce B. The experience required, he says, is
that of the constant conjunction of events of the kind A with events of
the kind B. He points out that when, in experience, two objects are
constantly conjoined, we do in fact infer one from the other. (When he
says ‘infer’, he means that perceiving the one makes us expect the
other; he does not mean a formal or explicit inference.) ‘Perhaps, the
necessary connection depends on the inference,’ not vice versa. That is
to say, the sight of A causes the expectation of B, and so leads us to
believe that there is a necessary connection between A and B. The
inference is not determined by reason, since that would require us to
assume the uniformity of nature, which itself is not necessary, but only
inferred from experience.</p>
<p>Hume is thus led to the view that, when we say ‘A causes B’, we mean
only that A and B are constantly conjoined in fact, not that there is
some necessary connection between them. ‘We have no other notion of
cause and effect, but that of certain objects, which have been always
conjoined together…. We cannot penetrate into the reason of the
conjunction.’</p>
<p>He backs up his theory with a definition of ‘belief’, which is, he
maintains, ‘a lively idea related to or associated with a present
impression’. Through association, if A and B have been constantly
conjoined in past experience, the impression of A produces that lively
idea of B which constitutes belief in B. This explains why we believe A
and B to be connected: the percept of A is connected with the idea of B,
and so we come to think that A is connected with B, though this opinion
is really groundless. ‘Objects have no discoverable connexion together;
nor is it from any other principle but custom operating upon the
imagination, that we can draw any inference from the appearance of one
to the experience of another.’ He repeats many times the contention that
what appears to us as necessary connection among objects is really only
connection among the ideas of those objects: the mind is determined by
custom, and ‘’tis this impression, or determination, which affords me
the idea of necessity’. The repetition of instances, which leads us to
the belief that A causes B, gives nothing new in the object, but in the
mind leads to an association of ideas; thus ‘necessity is something that
exists in the mind, not in objects’.</p>
<p>Let us now ask ourselves what we are to think of Hume’s doctrine. It
has two parts, one objective, the other subjective. The objective part
says: When we judge that A causes B, what has in fact happened, so far
as A and B are concerned, is that they have been frequently observed to
be conjoined, i.e. A has been immediately, or very quickly, followed by
B; we have no right to say that A must be followed by B, or will be
followed by B on future occasions. Nor have we any ground for supposing
that, however often A is followed by B, any relation beyond sequence is
involved. In fact, causation is definable in terms of sequence, and is
not an independent notion.</p>
<p>The subjective part of the doctrine says: The frequently observed
conjunction of A and B causes the impression of A to cause the idea of
B. But if we are to define ‘cause’ as is suggested in the objective part
of the doctrine, we must reword the above. Substituting the definition
of ‘cause’, the above becomes:</p>
<p>‘It has been frequently observed that the frequently observed
conjunction of two objects A and B has been frequently followed by
occasions on which the impression of A was followed by the idea of
B.’</p>
<p>This statement, we may admit, is true, but it has hardly the scope
that Hume attributes to the subjective part of his doctrine. He
contends, over and over again, that the frequent conjunction of A and B
gives no reason for expecting them to be conjoined in the future, but is
merely a cause of this expectation. That is to say: Experience of
frequent conjunction is frequently conjoined with a habit of
association. But, if the objective part of Hume’s doctrine is accepted,
the fact that, in the past, associations have been frequently formed in
such circumstances, is no reason for supposing that they will continue,
or that new ones will be formed in similar circumstances. The fact is
that, where psychology is concerned, Hume allows himself to believe in
causation in a sense, which, in general, he condemns. Let us take an
illustration. I see an apple, and expect that, if I eat it, I shall
experience a certain kind of taste. According to Hume, there is no
reason why I should experience this kind of taste: the law of habit
explains the existence of my expectation, but does not justify it. But
the law of habit is itself a causal law. Therefore if we take Hume
seriously we must say: Although in the past the sight of an apple has
been conjoined with expectation of a certain kind of taste, there is no
reason why it should continue to be so conjoined: perhaps the next time
I see an apple I shall expect it to taste like roast beef. You may, at
the moment, think this unlikely; but that is no reason for expecting
that you will think it unlikely five minutes hence. If Hume’s objective
doctrine is right, we have no better reason for expectations in
psychology than in the physical world. Hume’s theory might be
caricatured as follows: ‘The proposition “A causes B“ means “the
impression of A causes the idea of B“.’ As a definition, this is not a
happy effort.</p>
<p>We must therefore examine Hume’s objective doctrine more closely.
This doctrine has two parts: (1) When we say ‘A causes B’, all that we
have a right to say is that, in past experience, A and B have frequently
appeared together or in rapid succession, and no instance has been
observed of A not followed or accompanied by B. (2) However many
instances we may have observed of the conjunction of A and B, that gives
no reason for expecting them to be conjoined on a future occasion,
though it is a cause of this expectation, i.e. it has been frequently
observed to be conjoined with such an expectation. These two parts of
the doctrine may be stated as follows: (1) in causation there is no
indefinable relation except conjunction or succession; (2) induction by
simple enumeration is not a valid form of argument. Empiricists in
general have accepted the first of these theses and rejected the second.
When I say they have rejected the second, I mean that they have believed
that, given a sufficiently vast accumulation of instances of a
conjunction, the likelihood of the conjunction being found in the next
instance will exceed a half; or, if they have not held exactly this,
they have maintained some doctrine having similar consequences.</p>
<p>I do not wish, at the moment, to discuss induction, which is a large
and difficult subject; for the moment, I am content to observe that, if
the first half of Hume’s doctrine is admitted, the rejection of
induction makes all expectation as to the future irrational, even the
expectation that we shall continue to feel expectations. I do not mean
merely that our expectations may be mistaken; that, in any case, must be
admitted. I mean that, taking even our firmest expectations, such as
that the sun will rise tomorrow, there is not a shadow of reason, for
supposing them more likely to be verified than not. With this proviso, I
return to the meaning of ‘cause’.</p>
<p>Those who disagree with Hume maintain that ‘cause’ is a specific
relation, which entails invariable sequence, but is not entailed by it.
To revert to the clocks of the Cartesians: two perfectly accurate
chronometers might strike the hours one after the other invariably,
without either being the cause of the other’s striking. In general,
those who take this view maintain that we can sometimes perceive causal
relations, though in most cases we are obliged to infer them, more or
less precariously, from constant conjunction. Let us see what arguments
there are for and against Hume on this point.</p>
<p>Hume summarizes his argument as follows:</p>
<p>‘I am sensible, that of all the paradoxes, which I have had, or shall
hereafter have occasion to advance in the course of this treatise, the
present one is the most violent, and that ’tis merely by dint of solid
proof and reasoning I can ever hope it will have admission, and overcome
the inveterate prejudices of mankind. Before we are reconcil’d to this
doctrine, how often must we repeat to ourselves, that the simple view of
any two objects or actions, however related, can never give us any idea
of power, or of a connexion betwixt them: that this idea arises from a
repetition of their union: that the repetition neither discovers nor
causes anything in the objects, but has an influence only on the mind,
by that customary transition it produces: that this customary transition
is, therefore, the same with the power and necessity, which are
consequently felt by the soul, and not perceiv’d externally in
bodies?’</p>
<p>Hume is commonly accused of having too atomic a view of perception,
but he allows that certain relations can be perceived. ‘We ought not,’
he says, ‘to receive as reasoning any of the observations we make
concerning identity, and the relations of time and place; since in none
of them the mind can go beyond what is immediately present to the
senses.’ Causation, he says, is different in that it takes us beyond the
impressions of our senses, and informs us of unperceived existences. As
an argument, this seems invalid. We believe in many relations of time
and place which we cannot perceive: we think that time extends backwards
and forwards, and space beyond the walls of our room. Hume’s real
argument is that, while we sometimes perceive relations of time and
place, we never perceive causal relations, which must therefore, if
admitted, be inferred from relations that can be perceived. The
controversy is thus reduced to one of empirical fact: Do we, or do we
not, sometimes perceive a relation which can be called causal? Hume says
no, his adversaries say yes, and it is not easy to see how evidence can
be produced by either side.</p>
<p>I think perhaps the strongest argument on Hume’s side is to be
derived from the character of causal laws in physics. It appears that
simple rules of the form ‘A causes B’ are never to be admitted in
science, except as crude suggestions in early stages. The causal laws by
which such simple rules are replaced in well-developed sciences are so
complex that no one can suppose them given in perception; they are all,
obviously, elaborate inferences from the observed course of nature. I am
leaving out of account modern quantum theory, which reinforces the above
conclusion. So far as the physical sciences are concerned, Hume is
wholly in the right; such propositions as ‘A causes B’ are never to be
accepted, and our inclination to accept them is to be explained by the
laws of habit and association. These laws themselves, in their accurate
form, will be elaborate statements as to nervous tissue—primarily its
physiology, then its chemistry, and ultimately its physics.</p>
<p>The opponent of Hume, however, even if he admits the whole of what
has just been said about the physical sciences, may not yet admit
himself decisively defeated. He may say that in psychology we have cases
where a causal relation can be perceived. The whole conception of cause
is probably derived from volition, and it may be said that we can
perceive a relation, between a volition and the consequent act, which is
something more than invariable sequence. The same might be said of the
relation between a sudden pain and a cry. Such views, however, are
rendered very difficult by physiology. Between the will to move my arm
and the consequent movement there is a long chain of causal
intermediaries consisting of processes in the nerves and muscles. We
perceive only the end terms of this process, the volition and the
movement, and if we think we see a direct causal connection between
these we are mistaken. This argument is not conclusive on the general
question, but it shows that it is rash to suppose that we perceive
causal relations when we think we do. The balance, therefore, is in
favour of Hume’s view that there is nothing in cause except invariable
succession. The evidence, however, is not so conclusive as Hume
supposed.</p>
<p>Hume is not content with reducing the evidence of a causal connection
to experience of frequent conjunction; he proceeds to argue that such
experience does not justify the expectation of similar conjunctions in
the future. For example: when (to repeat a former illustration) I see an
apple, past experience makes me expect that it will taste like an apple,
and not like roast beef; but there is no rational justification for this
expectation. If there were such a justification, it would have to
proceed from the principle ‘that those instances, of which we have had
no experience, resemble those of which we have had experience’. This
principle is not logically necessary, since we can at least conceive a
change in the course of nature. It should therefore be a principle of
probability. But all probable arguments assume this principle, and
therefore it cannot itself be proved by any probable argument, or even
rendered probable by any such argument. ’The supposition, that the
future resembles the past, is not founded on arguments of any kind, but
is derived entirely from habit.’1 The conclusion is one of complete
scepticism:</p>
<p>’All probable reasoning is nothing but a species of sensation. ’Tis
not solely in poetry and music, we must follow our taste and sentiment,
but likewise in philosophy. When I am convinced of any principle, ’tis
only an idea, which strikes more strongly upon me. When I give the
preference to one set of arguments above another, I do nothing but
decide from my feeling concerning the superiority of their influence.
Objects have no discoverable connexion together; nor is it from any
other principle but custom operating upon the imagination, that we can
draw any inference from the appearance of one to the existence of
another.’2</p>
<p>The ultimate outcome of Hume’s investigation of what passes for
knowledge is not what we must suppose him to have desired. The sub-title
of his book is: ‘An attempt to introduce the experimental method of
reasoning into moral subjects.’ It is evident that he started out with a
belief that scientific method yields the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth; he ended, however, with the conviction that
belief is never rational, since we know nothing. After setting forth the
arguments for scepticism (Book I, part iv, sec. i), he goes on, not to
refute the arguments, but to fall back on natural credulity.</p>
<p>’Nature, by an absolute and uncontrollable necessity, has determined
us to judge as well as to breathe and feel; nor can we any more forbear
viewing certain objects in a stronger and fuller light, upon account of
their customary</p>
<p>connexion with a present impression, than we can hinder ourselves
from thinking as long as we are awake, or seeing the surrounding bodies,
when we turn our eyes towards them in broad sunshine. Whoever has taken
the pains to refute this total scepticism, has really disputed without
an antagonist, and endeavoured by arguments to establish a faculty,
which nature has antecedently implanted in the mind, and rendered
unavoidable. My intention then in displaying so carefully the arguments
of that fantastic sect, is only to make the reader sensible of the truth
of my hypothesis, that all our reasonings concerning causes and effects
are derived from nothing but custom; and that belief is more properly an
act of the sensitive, than of the cogitative part of our natures.’</p>
<p>‘The sceptic,’ he continues (Book I, part iv, sec. ii), ‘still
continues to reason and believe, even though he asserts that he cannot
defend his reason by reason; and by the same rule he must assent to the
principle concerning the existence of body, tho’ he cannot pretend by
any arguments of philosophy to maintain its veracity … We may well ask,
what causes us to believe in the existence of body? But ‘tis vain to
ask, whether there be body or not? That is a point, which we must take
for granted in all our reasonings.’</p>
<p>The above is the beginning of a section ‘Of scepticism with regard to
the senses.’ After a long discussion, this section ends with the
following conclusion:</p>
<p>‘This sceptical doubt, both with respect to reason and the senses, is
a malady, which can never be radically cured, but must return upon us
every moment, however we may chase it away, and sometimes may seem
entirely free from it…. Carelessness and inattention alone can afford us
any remedy. For this reason I rely entirely upon them; and take it for
granted, whatever may be the reader’s opinion at this present moment,
that an hour hence he will be persuaded there is both an external and
internal world.’</p>
<p>There is no reason for studying philosophy—so Hume maintains—except
that, to certain temperaments, this is an agreeable way of passing the
time. ‘In all the incidents of life we ought still to preserve our
scepticism. If we believe, that fire warms, or water refreshes, ’tis
only because it costs us too much pains to think otherwise. Nay, if we
are philosophers, it ought only to be upon sceptical principles, and
from an inclination which we feel to be employing ourselves after that
manner.’ If he abandoned speculation, ‘I feel I should be a loser in
point of pleasure; and this is the origin of my philosophy.’</p>
<p>Hume’s philosophy, whether true or false, represents the bankruptcy
of eighteenth-century reasonableness. He starts out, like Locke, with
the intention of being sensible and empirical, taking nothing on trust,
but seeking whatever instruction is to be obtained from experience and
observation. But having a better intellect than Locke’s, a greater
acuteness in analysis, and a smaller capacity for accepting comfortable
inconsistencies, he arrives at the disastrous conclusion that from
experience and observation nothing is to be learnt. There is no such
thing as a rational belief: ‘If we believe that fire warms, or water
refreshes, ’tis only because it costs us too much pains to think
otherwise.’ We cannot help believing, but no belief can be grounded in
reason. Nor can one line of action be more rational than another, since
all alike are based upon irrational convictions. This last conclusion,
however, Hume seems not to have drawn. Even in his most sceptical
chapter, in which he sums up the conclusions of Book I, he says:
‘Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in
philosophy only ridiculous.’ He has no right to say this. ‘Dangerous’ is
a causal word, and a sceptic as to causation cannot know that anything
is ‘dangerous’.</p>
<p>In fact, in the later portions of the Treatise, Hume forgets all
about his fundamental doubts, and writes much as any other enlightened
moralist of his time might have written; he applies to his doubts the
remedy that he recommends, namely ‘carelessness and inattention’. In a
sense, his scepticism is insincere, since he cannot maintain it in
practice. It has, however, this awkward consequence, that it paralyses
every effort to prove one line of action better than another.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that such a self-refutation of rationality should
be followed by a great outburst of irrational faith. The quarrel between
Hume and Rousseau is symbolic: Rousseau was mad but influential, Hume
was sane but had no followers. Subsequent British empiricists rejected
his scepticism without refuting it; Rousseau and his followers agreed
with Hume that no belief is based on reason, but thought the heart
superior to reason, and allowed it to lead them to convictions very
different from those that Hume retained in practice. German
philosophers, from Kant to Hegel, had not assimilated Hume’s arguments.
I say this deliberately, in spite of the belief which many philosophers
share with Kant, that his Critique of Pure Reason answered Hume. In
fact, these philosophers—at least Kant and Hegel—represent a pre-Humian
type of rationalism, and can be refuted by Humian arguments. The
philosophers who cannot be refuted in this way are those who do not
pretend to be rational, such as Rousseau, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche.
The growth of unreason throughout the nineteenth century and what has
passed of the twentieth is a natural sequel to Hume’s destruction of
empiricism.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to discover whether there is any answer to
Hume within the framework of a philosophy that is wholly or mainly
empirical. If not, there is no intellectual difference between sanity
and insanity. The lunatic who believes that he is a poached egg is to be
condemned solely on the ground that he is in a minority, or rather—since
we must not assume democracy—on the ground that the government does not
agree with him. This is a desperate point of view, and it must be hoped
that there is some way of escaping from it.</p>
<p>Hume’s scepticism rests entirely upon his rejection of the principle
of induction. The principle of induction, as applied to causation, says
that, if A has been found very often accompanied or followed by B, and
no instance is known of A not being accompanied or followed by B, then
it is probable that on the next occasion on which A is observed it will
be accompanied or followed by B. If the principle is to be adequate, a
sufficient number of instances must make the probability not far short
of certainty. If this principle, or any other from which it can be
deduced, is true, then the causal inferences which Hume rejects are
valid, not indeed as giving certainty, but as giving a sufficient
probability for practical purposes. If this principle is not true, every
attempt to arrive at general scientific laws from particular
observations is fallacious, and Hume’s scepticism is inescapable for an
empiricist. The principle itself cannot, of course, without circularity,
be inferred from observed uniformities, since it is required to justify
any such inference. It must therefore be, or be deduced from, an
independent principle not based upon experience. To this extent, Hume
has proved that pure empiricism is not a sufficient basis for science.
But if this one principle is admitted, everything else can proceed in
accordance with the theory that all our knowledge is based on
experience. It must be granted that this is a serious departure from
pure empiricism, and that those who are not empiricists may ask why, if
one departure is allowed, others are to be forbidden. These, however,
are questions not directly raised by Hume’s arguments. What these
arguments prove—and I do not think the proof can be controverted—is,
that induction is an independent logical principle, incapable of being
inferred either from experience or from other logical principles, and
that without this principle science is impossible.</p>
