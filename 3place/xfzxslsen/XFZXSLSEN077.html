<h4 id="william-james">29 WILLIAM JAMES</h4>
<p>William James (1842–1910) was primarily a psychologist, but was
important in philosophy on two accounts: he invented the doctrine which
he called ‘radical empiricism’, and he was one of the three protagonists
of the theory called ‘pragmatism’ or ‘instrumentalism’. In later life he
was, as he deserved to be, the recognized leader of American philosophy.
He was led by the study of medicine to the consideration of psychology;
his great book on the subject, published in 1890, had the highest
possible excellence. I shall not, however, deal with it, since it was a
contribution to science rather than to philosophy.</p>
<p>There were two sides to William James’s philosophical interests, one
scientific, the other religious. On the scientific side, the study of
medicine had given his thoughts a tendency towards materialism, which,
however, was held in check by his religious emotions. His religious
feelings were very Protestant, very democratic, and very full of the
warmth of human kindness. He refused altogether to follow his brother
Henry into fastidious snobbishness. ‘The prince of darkness,’ he said,
‘may be a gentleman, as we are told he is, but whatever the God on earth
and heaven is, he can surely be no gentleman.’ This is a very
characteristic pronouncement.</p>
<p>His warm-heartedness and his delightful humour caused him to be
almost universally beloved. The only man I know of who did not feel any
affection for him was Santayana, whose doctor’s thesis William James had
described as ‘the perfection of rottenness’. There was between these two
men a temperamental opposition which nothing could have overcome.
Santayana also liked religion, but in a very different way. He liked it
aesthetically and historically, not as a help towards a moral life; as
was natural, he greatly preferred Catholicism to Protestantism. He did
not intellectually accept any of the Christian dogmas, but he was
content that others should believe them, and himself appreciated what he
regarded as the Christian myth. To James, such an attitude could not but
appear immoral. He retained from his Puritan ancestry a deep-seated
belief that what is of most importance is good conduct, and his
democratic feeling made him unable to acquiesce in the notion of one
truth for philosophers and another for the vulgar. The temperamental
opposition between Protestant and Catholic persists among the
unorthodox; Santayana was a Catholic free thinker, William James a
Protestant, however heretical.</p>
<p>James’s doctrine of radical empiricism was first published in 1904,
in an essay called ‘Does “Consciousness“ Exist?’ The main purpose of
this essay was to deny that the subject-object relation is fundamental.
It had, until then, been taken for granted by philosophers that there is
a kind of occurrence called ‘knowing’, in which one entity, the knower
or subject, is aware of another, the thing known, or the object. The
knower was regarded as a mind or soul; the object known might be a
material object, an eternal essence, another mind, or, in
self-consciousness, identical with the knower. Almost everything in
accepted philosophy was bound up with the dualism of subject and object.
The distinction of mind and matter, the contemplative ideal, and the
traditional notion of ‘truth’, all need to be radically reconsidered if
the distinction of subject and object is not accepted as
fundamental.</p>
<p>For my part, I am convinced that James was partly right on this
matter, and would, on this ground alone, deserve a high place among
philosophers. I had thought otherwise until he, and those who agreed
with him, persuaded me of the truth of his doctrine. But let us proceed
to his arguments.</p>
<p>Consciousness, he says, ‘is the name of a nonentity, and has no right
to a place among first principles. Those who still cling to it are
clinging to a mere echo, the faint rumour left behind by the
disappearing “soul“ upon the air of philosophy’. There is, he continues,
‘no aboriginal stuff or quality of being, contrasted with that of which
material objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are made’.
He explains that he is not denying that our thoughts perform a function
which is that of knowing, and that this function may be called ‘being
conscious’. What he is denying might be put crudely as the view that
consciousness is a ‘thing’. He holds that there is ‘only one primal
stuff or material’, out of which everything in the world is composed.
This stuff he calls ‘pure experience’. Knowing, he says, is a particular
sort of relation between two portions of pure experience. The
subject-object relation is derivative: ‘experience, I believe, has no
such inner duplicity’. A given undivided portion of experience can be in
one context a knower, and in another something known.</p>
<p>He defines ‘pure experience’ as ‘the immediate flux of life which
furnishes the material to our later reflection’.</p>
<p>It will be seen that this doctrine abolishes the distinction between
mind and matter, if regarded as a distinction between two different
kinds of what James calls ‘stuff’. Accordingly those who agree with
James in this matter advocate what they call ‘neutral monism’, according
to which the material of which the world is constructed is neither mind
nor matter, but something anterior to both. James himself did not
develop this implication of his theory; on the contrary, his use of the
phrase ‘pure experience’ points to a perhaps unconscious Berkeleian
idealism. The word ‘experience’ is one often used by philosophers, but
seldom defined. Let us consider for a moment what it can mean.</p>
<p>Common sense holds that many things which occur are not
‘experienced’, for instance, events on the invisible side of the moon.
Berkeley and Hegel, for different reasons, both denied this, and
maintained that what is not experienced is nothing. Their arguments are
now held by most philosophers to be invalid—rightly, in my opinion. If
we are to adhere to the view that the ‘stuff’ of the world is
‘experience’, we shall find it necessary to invent elaborate and
unplausible explanations of what we mean by such things as the invisible
side of the moon. And unless we are able to infer things not experienced
from things experienced, we shall have difficulty in finding grounds for
belief in the existence of anything except ourselves. James, it is true,
denies this, but his reasons are not very convincing.</p>
<p>What do we mean by ‘experience’? The best way to find an answer is to
ask: What is the difference between an event which is not experienced
and one which is? Rain seen or felt to be falling is experienced, but
rain falling in the desert where there is no living thing is not
experienced. Thus we arrive at our first point: there is no experience
except where there is life. But experience is not coextensive with life.
Many things happen to me which I do not notice; these I can hardly be
said to experience. Clearly I experience whatever I remember, but some
things which I do not explicitly remember may have set up habits which
still persist. The burnt child fears the fire, even if he has no
recollection of the occasion on which he was burnt. I think we may say
that an event is ‘experienced’ when it sets up a habit. (Memory is one
kind of habit.) Broadly speaking, habits are only set up in living
organisms. A burnt poker does not fear the fire, however often it is
made red-hot. On commonsense grounds, therefore, we shall say that
‘experience’ is not coextensive with the ‘stuff’ of the world. I do not
myself see any valid reason for departing from common sense on this
point.</p>
<p>Except in this matter of ‘experience’, I find myself in agreement
with James’s radical empiricism.</p>
<p>It is otherwise with his pragmatism and ‘will to believe’. The
latter, especially, seems to me to be designed to afford a specious but
sophistical defence of certain religious dogmas—a defence, moreover,
which no whole-hearted believer could accept.</p>
<p>The Will to Believe was published in 1896; Pragmatism, a New Name for
Some Old Ways of Thinking was published in 1907. The doctrine of the
latter is an amplification of that of the former.</p>
<p>The Will to Believe argues that we are often compelled, in practice,
to take decisions where no adequate theoretical grounds for a decision
exist, for even to do nothing is still a decision. Religious matters,
James says, come under this head; we have, he maintains, a right to
adopt a believing attitude although ‘our merely logical intellect may
not have been coerced’. This is essentially the attitude of Rousseau’s
Savoyard vicar, but James’s development is novel.</p>
<p>The moral duty of veracity, we are told, consists of two coequal
precepts: ‘believe truth’, and ‘shun error’. The sceptic wrongly attends
only to the second, and thus fails to believe various truths which a
less cautious man will believe. If believing truth and avoiding error
are of equal importance, I may do well, when presented with an
alternative, to believe one of the possibilities at will, for then I
have an even chance of believing truth, whereas I have none if I suspend
judgment.</p>
<p>The ethic that would result if this doctrine were taken seriously is
a very odd one. Suppose I meet a stranger in the train, and I ask
myself: ‘Is his name Ebenezer Wilkes Smith?’ If I admit that I do not
know, I am certainly not believing truly about his name: whereas, if I
decide to believe that that is his name, there is a chance that I may be
believing truly. The sceptic, says James, is afraid of being duped, and
through his fear may lose important truth; ‘what proof is there’, he
adds, ‘that dupery through hope is so much worse than dupery through
fear?’ It would seem to follow that, if I have been hoping for years to
meet a man called Ebenezer Wilkes Smith, positive as opposed to negative
veracity should prompt me to believe that this is the name of every
stranger I meet, until I acquire conclusive evidence to the
contrary.</p>
<p>‘But,’ you will say, ‘the instance is absurd, for, though you do not
know the stranger’s name, you do know that a very small percentage of
mankind are called Ebenezer Wilkes Smith. You are therefore not in that
state of complete ignorance that is presupposed in your freedom of
choice.’ Now strange to say, James throughout his essay, never mentions
probability, and yet there is almost always some discoverable
consideration of probability in regard to any question. Let it be
conceded (though no orthodox believer would concede it) that there is no
evidence either for or against any of the religions of the world.
Suppose you are a Chinese, brought into contact with Confucianism,
Buddhism, and Christianity. You are precluded by the laws of logic from
supposing that each of the three is true. Let us suppose that Buddhism
and Christianity each has an even chance, then, given that both cannot
be true, one of them must be, and therefore Confucianism must be false.
If all three are to have equal chances, each must be more likely to be
false than true. In this sort of way James’s principle collapses as soon
as we are allowed to bring in considerations of probability.</p>
<p>It is curious that, in spite of being an eminent psychologist, James
allowed himself at this point a singular crudity. He spoke as if the
only alternatives were complete belief or complete disbelief, ignoring
all shades of doubt. Suppose, for instance, I am looking for a book in
my shelves. I think, ‘It may be in this shelf,’ and I proceed to look;
but I do not think, ‘It is in this shelf’ until I see it. We habitually
act upon hypotheses, but not precisely as we act upon what we consider
certainties; for when we act upon an hypothesis we keep our eyes open
for fresh evidence.</p>
<p>The precept of veracity, it seems to me, is not such as James thinks.
It is, I should say: ‘Give to any hypothesis which is worth your while
to consider just that degree of credence which the evidence warrants.’
And if the hypothesis is sufficiently important there is the additional
duty of seeking further evidence. This is plain common sense, and in
harmony with the procedure in the law courts, but it is quite different
from the procedure recommended by James.</p>
<p>It would be unfair to James to consider his will to believe in
isolation; it was a transitional doctrine, leading by a natural
development to pragmatism. Pragmatism, as it appears in James, is
primarily a new definition of ‘truth’. There were two other protagonists
of pragmatism, F. C. S. Schiller and Dr John Dewey. I shall consider Dr
Dewey in the next chapter; Schiller was of less importance than the
other two. Between James and Dr Dewey there is a difference of emphasis.
Dr Dewey’s outlook is scientific, and his arguments are largely derived
from an examination of scientific method, but James is concerned
primarily with religion and morals. Roughly speaking, he is prepared to
advocate any doctrine which tends to make people virtuous and happy; if
it does so, it is ‘true’ in the sense in which he uses that word.</p>
<p>The principle of pragmatism, according to James, was first enunciated
by C. S. Peirce, who maintained that, in order to attain clearness in
our thoughts of an object, we need only consider what conceivable
effects of a practical kind the object may involve. James, in
elucidation, says that the function of philosophy is to find out what
difference it makes to you or me if this or that world-formula is true.
In this way theories become instruments, not answers to enigmas.</p>
<p>Ideas, we are told by James, become true in so far as they help us to
get into satisfactory relations with other parts of our experience: ‘An
idea is “true“ so long as to believe it is profitable to our lives.’
Truth is one species of good, not a separate category. Truth happens to
an idea; it is made true by events. It is correct to say, with the
intellectualists, that a true idea must agree with reality, but
‘agreeing’ does not mean ‘copying’. ‘To “agree“ in the widest sense with
a reality can only mean to be guided either straight up to it or into
its surroundings, or to be put into such working touch with it as to
handle either it or something connected with it better than if we
disagreed.’ He adds that ‘the true is only the expedient in the way of
our thinking … in the long run and on the whole of course’. In other
words, ‘our obligation to seek truth is part of our general obligation
to do what pays’.</p>
<p>In a chapter on pragmatism and religion he reaps the harvest. ‘We
cannot reject any hypothesis if consequences useful to life flow from
it.’ ‘If the hypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense
of the word, it is true.’ ‘We may well believe, on the proofs that
religious experience affords, that higher powers exist and are at work
to save the world on ideal lines similar to our own.’</p>
<p>I find great intellectual difficulties in this doctrine. It assumes
that a belief is ‘true’ when its effects are good. If this definition is
to be useful—and if not it is condemned by the pragmatist’s test—we must
know (a) what is good. (b) what are the effects of this or that belief,
and we must know these things before we can know that anything is
‘true’, since it is only after we have decided that the effects of a
belief are good that we have a right to call it ‘true’. The result is an
incredible complication. Suppose you want to know whether Columbus
crossed the Atlantic in 1492. You must not, as other people do, look it
up in a book. You must first inquire what are the effects of this
belief, and how they differ from the effects of believing that he sailed
in 1491 or 1493. This is difficult enough, but it is still more
difficult to weigh the effects from an ethical point of view. You may
say that obviously 1492 has the best effects, since it gives you higher
marks in examinations. But your competitors, who would surpass you if
you said 1491 or 1493, may consider your success instead of theirs
ethically regrettable. Apart from examinations, I cannot think of any
practical effects of the belief except in the case of a historian.</p>
<p>But this is not the end of the trouble. You must hold that your
estimate of the consequences of a belief, both ethical and factual, is
true, for if it is false your argument for the truth of your belief is
mistaken. But to say that your belief as to consequences is true is,
according to James, to say that it has good consequences, and this in
turn is only true if it has good consequences, and so on ad infinitum.
Obviously this won’t do.</p>
<p>There is another difficulty. Suppose I say there was such a person as
Columbus, everyone will agree that what I say is true. But why is it
true? Because of a certain man of flesh and blood who lived 450 years
ago—in short, because of the causes of my belief, not because of its
effects. With James’s definition, it might happen that ‘A exists’ is
true although in fact A does not exist. I have always found that the
hypothesis of Santa Claus ‘works satisfactorily in the widest sense of
the word’; therefore ‘Santa Claus exists’ is true, although Santa Claus
does not exist. James says (I repeat): ‘If the hypothesis of God works
satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is true.’ This simply
omits as unimportant the question whether God really is in His heaven;
if He is a useful hypothesis, that is enough. God the Architect of the
Cosmos is forgotten; all that is remembered is belief in God, and its
effects upon the creatures inhabiting our petty planet. No wonder the
Pope condemned the pragmatic defence of religion.</p>
<p>We come here to a fundamental difference between James’s religious
outlook and that of religious people in the past. James is interested in
religion as a human phenomenon, but shows little interest in the objects
which religion contemplates. He wants people to be happy, and if belief
in God makes them happy let them believe in Him. This, so far, is only
benevolence, not philosophy; it becomes philosophy when it is said that
if the belief makes them happy it is ‘true’. To the man who desires an
object of worship this is unsatisfactory. He is not concerned to say,
‘If I believed in God I should be happy’; he is concerned to say, ‘I
believe in God and therefore I am happy.’ And when he believes in God,
he believes in Him as he believes in the existence of Roosevelt or
Churchill or Hitler; God, for him, is an actual Being, not merely a
human idea which has good effects. It is this genuine belief that has
the good effects, not James’s emasculate substitute. It is obvious that
if I say ‘Hitler exists’ I do not mean ‘the effects of believing that
Hitler exists are good’. And to the genuine believer the same is true of
God.</p>
<p>James’s doctrine is an attempt to build a superstructure of belief
upon a foundation of scepticism, and like all such attempts it is
dependent on fallacies. In his case the fallacies spring from an attempt
to ignore all extra-human facts. Berkeleian idealism combined with
scepticism causes him to substitute belief in God for God, and to
pretend that this will do just as well. But this is only a form of the
subjectivistic madness which is characteristic of most modern
philosophy.</p>
