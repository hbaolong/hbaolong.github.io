<h4 id="the-papacy-in-the-dark-ages">7 THE PAPACY IN THE DARK AGES</h4>
<p>During the four centuries from Gregory the Great to Sylvester II, the
papacy underwent astonishing vicissitudes. It was subject, at times, to
the Greek Emperor, at other times to the Western Emperor, and at yet
other times to the local Roman aristocracy; nevertheless, vigorous popes
in the eighth and ninth centuries, seizing propitious moments, built up
the tradition of papal power. The period from A.D. 600 to 1000 is of
vital importance for the understanding of the medieval Church and its
relation to the State.</p>
<p>The popes achieved independence of the Greek emperors, not so much by
their own efforts, as by the arms of the Lombards, to whom, however,
they felt no gratitude whatever. The Greek Church remained always, in a
great measure, subservient to the Emperor, who considered himself
competent to decide on matters of faith, as well as to appoint and
depose bishops, even patriarchs. The monks strove for independence of
the Emperor, and for that reason sided, at times, with the Pope. But the
patriarchs of Constantinople, though willing to submit to the Emperor,
refused to regard themselves as in any degree subject to papal
authority. At times, when the Emperor needed the Pope’s help against
barbarians in Italy, he was more friendly to the Pope than the patriarch
of Constantinople was. The main cause of the ultimate separation of the
Eastern and the Western Churches was the refusal of the former to submit
to papal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the Byzantines by the Lombards, the popes had
reason to fear that they also would be conquered by these vigorous
barbarians. They saved themselves by an alliance with the Franks, who,
under Charlemagne, conquered Italy and Germany. This alliance produced
the Holy Roman Empire, which had a constitution that assumed harmony
between Pope and Emperor. The power of the Carolingian dynasty, however,
decayed rapidly. At first, the Pope reaped the advantage of this decay,
and in the latter half of the ninth century Nicholas I raised the papal
power to hitherto unexampled heights. The general anarchy, however, led
to the practical independence of the Roman aristocracy, which, in the
tenth century, controlled the papacy, with disastrous results. The way
in which, by a great movement of reform, the papacy, and the Church
generally, was saved from subordination to the feudal aristocracy, will
be the subject of a later chapter.</p>
<p>In the seventh century, Rome was still subject to the military power
of the emperors, and popes had to obey or suffer. Some, e.g. Honorius,
obeyed, even to the point of heresy; others, e.g. Martin I, resisted,
and were imprisoned by the Emperor. From 685 to 752, most of the popes
were Syrians or Greeks. Gradually, however, as the Lombards acquired
more and more of Italy, Byzantine power declined. The Emperor Leo the
Isaurian in 726, issued his iconoclast decree, which was regarded as
heretical, not only throughout the West, but by a large party in the
East. This the popes resisted vigorously and successfully; at last, in
787 under the Empress Irene (at first as regent), the East abandoned the
iconoclast heresy. Meanwhile, however, events in the West had put an end
forever to the control of Byzantium over the papacy.</p>
<p>In about the year 751, the Lombards captured Ravenna, the capital of
Byzantine Italy. This event, while it exposed the popes to great danger
from the Lombards, freed them from all dependence on the Greek emperors.
The popes had preferred the Greeks to the Lombards for several reasons.
First, the authority of the emperors was legitimate, whereas barbarian
kings, unless recognized by the emperors, were regarded as usurpers.
Second, the Greeks were civilized. Third, the Lombards were
nationalists, whereas the Church retained Roman internationalism.
Fourth, the Lombards had been Arians, and some odium still clung to them
after their conversion.</p>
<p>The Lombards, under King Liutprand, attempted to conquer Rome in 739,
and were hotly opposed by Pope Gregory III, who turned to the Franks for
aid. The Merovingian kings, the descendants of Clovis, had lost all real
power in the Frankish kingdom, which was governed by the ‘Mayors of the
Palace’. At this time the Mayor of the Palace was an exceptionally
vigorous and able man, Charles Martel, like William the Conqueror a
bastard. In 732 he had won the decisive battle of Tours against the
Moors thereby saving France for Christendom. This should have won him
the gratitude of the Church, but financial necessity led him to seize
some Church lands, which much diminished ecclesiastical appreciation of
his merits. However, he and Gregory III both died in 741, and his
successor Pepin was wholly satisfactory to the Church. Pope Stephen III,
in 754, to escape the Lombards crossed the Alps and visited Pepin, when
a bargain was struck which proved highly advantageous to both parties.
The Pope needed military protection, but Pepin needed vsomething that
only the Pope could bestow: the legitimization of his title as king in
place of the last of the Merovingians. In return for this, Pepin
bestowed on the Pope Ravenna and all the territory of the former
Exarchate in Italy. Since it could not be expected that Constantinople
would recognize such a gift, this involved a political severance from
the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p>If the popes had remained subject to the Greek emperors, the
development of the Catholic Church would have been very different. In
the Eastern Church, the patriarch of Constantinople never acquired
either that independence of secular authority or that superiority to
other ecclesiastics that was achieved by the Pope. Originally all
bishops were considered equal, and to a considerable extent this view
persisted in the East. Moreover, there were other Eastern patriarchs, at
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, whereas the Pope was the only
patriarch in the West. (This fact, however, lost its importance after
the Mohammedan conquest.) In the West, but not in the East, the laity
were mostly illiterate for many centuries, and this gave the Church an
advantage in the West which it did not possess in the East. The prestige
of Rome surpassed that of any Eastern city, for it combined the imperial
tradition with legends of the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, and of Peter
as first Pope. The Emperor’s prestige might have sufficed to cope with
that of the Pope, but no Western monarch’s could. The Holy Roman
emperors were often destitute of real power; moreover they only became
emperors when the Pope crowned them. For all these reasons, the
emancipation of the Pope from Byzantine domination was essential both to
the independence of the Church in relation to secular monarchs, and to
the ultimate establishment of the papal monarchy in the government of
the Western Church.</p>
<p>Certain documents of great importance, the ‘Donation of Constantine’
and the False Decretals, belong to this period. The False Decretals need
not concern us, but something must be said of the Donation of
Constantine. In order to give an air of antique legality to Pepin’s
gift, churchmen forged a document, purporting to be a decree issued by
the Emperor Constantine, by which, when he founded the New Rome, he
bestowed upon the Pope the old Rome and all its Western territories.
This bequest, which was the basis of the Pope’s temporal power, was
accepted as genuine by the whole of the subsequent Middle Ages. It was
first rejected as a forgery, in the time of the Renaissance, by Lorenzo
Valla in 1439. He had written a book ‘on the elegancies of the Latin
language’, which, naturally, were absent in a production of the eighth
century. Oddly enough, after he had published his book against the
Donation of Constantine, as well as a treatise in praise of Epicurus, he
was made apostolic secretary by Pope Nicholas V who cared more for
latinity than for the Church. Nicholas V did not, however, propose to
give up the States of the Church, though the Pope’s title to them had
been based upon the supposed Donation.</p>
<p>The contents of this remarkable document are summarized by C. Delisle
Burns as follows:1</p>
<p>After a summary of the Nicene creed, the fall of Adam, and the birth
of Christ, Constantine says he was suffering from leprosy, that doctors
were useless, and that he therefore approached ‘the priests of the
Capitol’. They proposed that he should slaughter several infants and be
washed in their blood, but owing to their mothers’ tears he restored
them. That night Peter and Paul appeared to him and said that Pope
Sylvester was hiding in a cave on Soracte and would cure him. He went to
Soracte, where the ‘universal Pope’ told him Peter and Paul were
apostles, not gods, showed him portraits which he recognized from his
vision, and admitted it before all his ‘satraps’. Pope Sylvester
thereupon assigned him a period of penance in a hair shirt; then he
baptized him, when he saw a hand from heaven touching him. He was cured
of leprosy, and gave up worshipping idols. Then ‘with all his satraps,
the Senate, his nobles and the whole Roman people he thought it good to
grant supreme power to the See of Peter’, and superiority over Antioch,
Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Constantinople. He then built a church in his
palace of the Lateran. On the Pope he conferred his crown, tiara, and
imperial garments. He placed a tiara on the Pope’s head and held the
reins of his horse. He left to ‘Sylvester and his successors Rome and
all the provinces, districts and cities of Italy and the West to be
subject to the Roman Church forever’; he then moved East ‘because, where
the princedom of bishops and the head of the Christian religion has been
established by the heavenly Emperor it is not just that an earthly
Emperor should have power.’</p>
<p>The Lombards did not tamely submit to Pepin and the Pope, but in
repeated wars with the Franks they were worsted. At last, in 774,
Pepin’s son Charlemagne marched into Italy, completely defeated the
Lombards, had himself recognized as their king, and then occupied Rome,
where he confirmed Pepin’s donation. The Popes of his day, Hadrian and
Leo III, found it to their advantage to further his schemes in every
way. He conquered most of Germany, converted the Saxons by vigorous
persecution, and finally, in his own person, revived the Western Empire,
being crowned Emperor by the Pope in Rome on Christmas Day, A.D.
800.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Holy Roman Empire marks an epoch in medieval
theory, though much less in medieval practice. The Middle Ages were
peculiarly addicted to legal fictions, and until this time the fiction
had persisted that the Western provinces of the former Roman Empire were
still subject, de jure, to the Emperor in Constantinople, who was
regarded as the sole source</p>
<p>of legal authority. Charlemagne, an adept in legal fictions,
maintained that the throne of the Empire was vacant, because the
reigning Eastern sovereign Irene (who called herself emperor, not
empress) was a usurper, since no woman could be emperor. Charles derived
his claim to legitimacy from the Pope. There was thus, from the first, a
curious interdependence of pope and emperor. No one could be emperor
unless crowned by the Pope in Rome; on the other hand, for some
centuries, every strong emperor claimed the right to appoint or depose
popes. The medieval theory of legitimate power depended upon both
emperor and pope; their mutual dependence was galling to both, but for
centuries inescapable. There was constant friction, with advantage now
to one side, now to the other. At last, in the thirteenth century, the
conflict became irreconcilable. The Pope was victorious, but lost moral
authority shortly afterwards. The Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor both
survived, the Pope to the present day, the Emperor to the time of
Napoleon. But the elaborate medieval theory that had been built up
concerning their respective powers ceased to be effective during the
fifteenth century. The unity of Christendom, which it maintained, was
destroyed by the power of the French, Spanish, and English monarchies in
the secular sphere, and by the Reformation in the sphere of
religion.</p>
<p>The character of Charles the Great and his entourage is thus summed
up by Dr Gerhard Seeliger:2</p>
<p>Vigorous life was developed at Charles’s court. We see there
magnificence and genius, but immorality also. For Charles was not
particular about the people he drew round him. He himself was no model,
and he suffered the greatest licence in those whom he liked and found
useful. As ‘Holy Emperor’ he was addressed, though his life exhibited
little holiness. He is so addressed by Alcuin, who also praises the
Emperor’s beautiful daughter Rotrud as distinguished for her virtues in
spite of her having borne a son to Count Roderic of Maine, though not
his wife. Charles would not be separated from his daughters, he would
not allow their marriage, and he was therefore obliged to accept the
consequences. The other daughter, Bertha, also had two sons by the pious
Abbot Angilbert of St Riquier. In fact the court of Charles was a centre
of very loose life.</p>
<p>Charlemagne was a vigorous barbarian, politically in alliance with
the Church, but not unduly burdened with personal piety. He could not
read or write, but he inaugurated a literary renaissance. He was
dissolute in his life, and unduly fond of his daughters, but he did all
in his power to promote holy living among his subjects. He, like his
father Pepin, made skilful use of the</p>
<p>zeal of missionaries to promote his influence in Germany, but he saw
to it that Popes obeyed his orders. They did this the more willingly,
because Rome had become a barbarous city, in which the person of the
Pope was not safe without external protection, and papal elections had
degenerated into disorderly faction fights. In 799, local enemies seized
the Pope, imprisoned him, and threatened to blind him. During Charles’s
lifetime, it seemed as if a new order would be inaugurated; but after
his death little survived except a theory.</p>
<p>The gains of the Church, and more particularly of the papacy, were
more solid than those of the Western Empire. England had been converted
by a monastic mission under the orders of Gregory the Great, and
remained much more subject to Rome than were the countries with bishops
accustomed to local autonomy. The conversion of Germany was largely the
work of St Boniface (680–754), an English missionary, who was a friend
of Charles Martel and Pepin, and completely faithful to the Pope.
Boniface founded many monasteries in Germany; his friend St Gall founded
the Swiss monastery which bears his name. According to some authorities,
Boniface appointed Pepin as king with a ritual taken from the First Book
of Kings.</p>
<p>St Boniface was a native of Devonshire, educated at Exeter and
Winchester. He went to Frisia in 716, but soon had to return. In 717 he
went to Rome, and in 719 Pope Gregory II sent him to Germany to convert
the Germans and to combat the influence of the Irish missionaries (who,
it will be remembered, erred as to the date of Easter and the shape of
the tonsure). After considerable successes, he returned to Rome in 722,
where he was made bishop by Gregory II, to whom he took an oath of
obedience. The Pope gave him a letter to Charles Martel, and charged him
to suppress heresy in addition to converting the heathen. In 732 he
became archbishop; in 738 he visited Rome a third time. In 741 Pope
Zacharias made him legate, and charged him to reform the Frankish
Church. He founded the abbey of Fulda, to which he gave a rule stricter
than the Benedictine. Then he had a controversy with an Irish bishop of
Salzburg, named Virgil, who maintained that there are other worlds than
ours, but was, nevertheless, canonized. In 754, after returning to
Frisia, Boniface and his companions were massacred by the heathen. It
was owing to him that German Christianity was papal, not Irish.</p>
<p>English monasteries, particularly those of Yorkshire, were of great
importance at this time. Such civilization as had existed in Roman
Britain had disappeared, and the new civilization introduced by
Christian missionaries centred entirely round the Benedictine abbeys,
which owed everything directly to Rome. The Venerable Bede was a monk at
Jarrow. His pupil Ecgbert, first archbishop of York, founded a cathedral
school, where Alcuin was educated.</p>
<p>Alcuin is an important figure in the culture of the time. He went to
Rome in 780, and in the course of his journey met Charlemagne at Parma.
The Emperor employed him to teach Latin to the Franks and to educate the
royal family. He spent a considerable part of his life at the court of
Charlemagne, engaged in teaching and in founding schools. At the end of
his life he was abbot of St Martin’s at Tours. He wrote a number of
books, including a verse history of the church at York. The emperor,
though uneducated, had a considerable belief in the value of culture,
and for a brief period diminished the darkness of the dark ages. But his
work in this direction was ephemeral. The culture of Yorkshire was for a
time destroyed by the Danes, that of France was damaged by the Normans.
The Saracens raided Southern Italy, conquered Sicily, and in 846 even
attacked Rome. On the whole, the tenth century was, in Western
Christendom, about the darkest epoch; for the ninth is redeemed by the
English ecclesiastics and by the astonishing figure of Johannes Scotus,
as to whom I shall have more to say presently.</p>
<p>The decay of Carolingian power after the death of Charlemagne and the
division of his empire redounded, at first, to the advantage of the
papacy. Pope Nicholas I (858–67) raised papal power to a far greater
height than it had ever attained before. He quarrelled with the Emperors
of the East and West, with King Charles the Bald of France and King
Lothar II of Lorraine, and with the episcopate of nearly every Christian
country; but in almost all his quarrels he was successful. The clergy in
many regions had become dependent on the local princes, and he set to
work to remedy this state of affairs. His two greatest controversies
concerned the divorce of Lothar II and the uncanonical deposition of
Ignatius, patriarch of Constantinople. The power of the Church
throughout the Middle Ages, had a great deal to do with royal divorces.
Kings were men of headstrong passions, who felt that the indissolubility
of marriage was a doctrine for subjects only. The Church, however, could
alone solemnize a marriage, and if the Church declared a marriage
invalid, a disputed succession and a dynastic war were very likely to
result. The Church, therefore, was in a very strong position in opposing
royal divorces and irregular marriages. In England, it lost this
position under Henry VIII, but recovered it under Edward VIII.</p>
<p>When Lothar II demanded a divorce, the clergy of his kingdom agreed.
Pope Nicholas, however, deposed the bishops who had acquiesced, and
totally refused to admit the King’s plea for divorce. Lothar’s brother,
the Emperor Louis II, thereupon marched on Rome with the intention of
overawing the Pope; but superstitious terrors prevailed, and he retired.
In the end, the Pope’s will prevailed.</p>
<p>The business of the Patriarch Ignatius was interesting, as showing
that the Pope could still assert himself in the East. Ignatius, who was
obnoxious to the Regent Bardas, was deposed, and Photius, hitherto a
layman, was elevated to his place. The Byzantine government asked the
Pope to sanction this proceeding. He sent two legates to inquire into
the matter; when they arrived in Constantinople, they were terrorized,
and gave their assent. For some time, the facts were concealed from the
Pope, but when he came to know them, he took a high line. He summoned a
council in Rome to consider the question; he deposed one of the legates
from his bishopric, and also the archbishop of Syracuse, who had
consecrated Photius; he anathematized Photius, deposed all whom he had
ordained, and restored all who had been deposed for opposing him. The
Emperor Michael III was furious, and wrote the Pope an angry letter, but
the Pope replied: ‘The day of king-priests and emperor-pontiffs is past,
Christianity has separated the two functions, and Christian emperors
have need of the Pope in view of the life eternal, whereas popes have no
need of emperors except as regards temporal things.’ Photius and the
Emperor retorted by summoning a council, which excommunicated the Pope
and declared the Roman Church heretical. Soon after this, however,
Michael III was murdered, and his successor Basil restored Ignatius,
explicitly recognizing papal jurisdiction in the matter. This triumph
happened just after the death of Nicholas, and was attributable almost
entirely to the accidents of palace revolutions. After the death of
Ignatius, Photius again became patriarch, and the split between the
Eastern and the Western Churches was widened. Thus it cannot be said
that Nicholas’s policy in this matter was victorious in the long
run.</p>
<p>Nicholas had almost more difficulty in imposing his will upon the
episcopate than upon kings. Archbishops had come to consider themselves
very great men, and they were reluctant to submit tamely to an
ecclesiastical monarch. He maintained, however, that bishops owe their
existence to the Pope, and while he lived he succeeded, on the whole, in
making this view prevail. There was, throughout these centuries, great
doubt as to how bishops should be appointed. Originally they were
elected by the acclamation of the faithful in their cathedral city;
then, frequently, by a synod of neighbouring bishops; then, sometimes by
the King, and sometimes by the Pope. Bishops could be deposed for grave
causes, but it was not clear whether they should be tried by the Pope or
by a provincial synod. All these uncertainties made the powers of an
office dependent upon the energy and astuteness of its holders. Nicholas
stretched papal power to the utmost limits of which it was then capable;
under his successors, it sank again to a very low ebb.</p>
<p>During the tenth century, the papacy was completely under the control
of the local Roman aristocracy. There was, as yet, no fixed rule as to
the election of Popes; sometimes they owed their elevation to popular
acclaim, sometimes to emperors or kings, and sometimes, as in the tenth
century, to the holders of local urban power in Rome. Rome was, at this
time, not a civilized city, as it had still been in the time of Gregory
the Great. At times there were faction fights; at other times some rich
family acquired control by a combination of violence and corruption. The
disorder and weakness of Western Europe was so great at this period that
Christendom might have seemed in danger of complete destruction. The
Emperor and the King of France were powerless to curb the anarchy
produced in their realms by feudal potentates who were nominally their
vassals. The Hungarians made raids on Northern Italy. The Normans raided
the French coast, until, in 911, they were given Normandy and in return
became Christians. But the greatest danger in Italy and Southern France
came from the Saracens, who could not be converted, and had no reverence
for the Church. They completed the conquest of Sicily about the end of
the ninth century; they were established on the River Garigliano, near
Naples; they destroyed Monte Cassino and other great monasteries; they
had a settlement on the coast of Provence, whence they raided Italy and
the Alpine valleys, interrupting traffic between Rome and the North.</p>
<p>The conquest of Italy by the Saracens was prevented by the Eastern
Empire, which overcame the Saracens of the Garigliano in 915. But it was
not strong enough to govern Rome, as it had done after Justinian’s
conquest, and the papacy became, for about a hundred years, a perquisite
of the Roman aristocracy or of the counts of Tusculum. The most powerful
Romans, at the beginning of the tenth century, were the ‘Senator’
Theophylact and his daughter Marozia, in whose family the papacy nearly
became hereditary. Marozia had several husbands in succession, and an
unknown number of lovers. One of the latter she elevated to the papacy,
under the title of Sergius II (904–11). His and her son was Pope John XI
(931–36); her grandson was John XII (955–64), who became Pope at the age
of sixteen and ‘completed the debasement of the papacy by his debauched
life and the orgies of which the Lateran palace soon became the scene’.3
Marozia is presumably the basis for the legend of a female ‘Pope
Joan’.</p>
<p>The popes of this period naturally lost whatever influence their
predecessors had retained in the East. They lost also the power, which
Nicholas I had successfully exercised, over bishops north of the Alps.
Provincial councils asserted their complete independence of the Pope,
but they failed to maintain independence of sovereigns and feudal lords.
Bishops, more and more, became assimilated to lay feudal magnates. ’The
Church itself thus appears as the victim of the same anarchy in which
lay society is weltering; all evil appetites range unchecked, and, more
than ever, such of the clergy as still retain some concern for religion
and for the salvation of the souls committed to their charge mourn over
the universal decadence and direct the eyes of the faithful towards the
spectre of the end of the world and of the Last Judgment.’4</p>
<p>It is a mistake, however, to suppose that a special dread of the end
of the world in the year 1000 prevailed at this time, as used to be
thought.</p>
<p>Christians, from St Paul onward, believed the end of the world to be
at hand, but they went on with their ordinary business none the
less.</p>
<p>The year 1000 may be conveniently taken as marking the end of the
lowest depth to which the civilization of Western Europe sank. From this
point the upward movement began which continued till 1914. In the
beginning, progress was mainly due to monastic reform. Outside the
monastic orders, the clergy had become, for the most part, violent,
immoral, and worldly; they were corrupted by the wealth and power that
they owed to the benefactions of the pious. The same thing happened,
over and over again, even to the monastic orders; but reformers, with
new zeal, revived their moral force as often as it had decayed.</p>
<p>Another reason which makes the year 1000 a turning-point is the
cessation, at about this time, of conquest by both Mohammedans and
northern barbarians, so far at least as Western Europe is concerned.
Goths, Lombards, Hungarians, and Normans came in successive waves; each
horde in turn was christianized, but each in turn weakened the civilized
tradition. The Western Empire broke up into many barbarian kingdoms; the
kings lost authority over their vassals; there was universal anarchy,
with perpetual violence both on a large and on a small scale. At last
all the races of vigorous northern conquerors had been converted to
Christianity, and had acquired settled habitations. The Normans, who
were the last comers, proved peculiarly capable of civilization. They
reconquered Sicily from the Saracens, and made Italy safe from the
Mohammedans. They brought England back into the Roman world, from which
the Danes had largely excluded it. Once settled in Normandy, they
allowed France to revive, and helped materially in the process.</p>
<p>Our use of the phrase ‘the Dark Ages’ to cover the period from 600 to
1000 marks our undue concentration on Western Europe. In China, this
period includes the time of the Tang dynasty, the greatest age of
Chinese poetry, and in many other ways a most remarkable epoch. From
India to Spain, the brilliant civilization of Islam flourished. What was
lost to Christendom at this time was not lost to civilization, but quite
the contrary. No one could have guessed that Western Europe would later
become dominant both in power and in culture. To us, it seems that
West-European civilization is civilization, but this is a narrow view.
Most of the cultural content of our civilization comes to us from the
Eastern Mediterranean, from Greeks and Jews. As for power: Western
Europe was dominant from the Punic Wars to the fall of Rome—say,
roughly, during the six centuries from 200 B.C. to A.D. 400. After that
time, no State in Western Europe could compare in power with China,
Japan, or the Caliphate.</p>
<p>Our superiority since the Renaissance is due partly to science and
scientific technique, partly to political institutions slowly built up
during the Middle Ages. There is no reason, in the nature of things, why
this superiority should vcontinue. In the present war, great military
strength has been shown by Russia, China, and Japan. All these combine
Western technique with Eastern ideology—Byzantine, Confucian, or Shinto.
India, if liberated, will contribute another Oriental element. It seems
not unlikely that, during the next few centuries, civilization, if it
survives, will have greater diversity than it has had since the
Renaissance. There is an imperialism of culture which is harder to
overcome than the imperialism of power. Long after the Western Empire
fell—indeed until the Reformation—all European culture retained a
tincture of Roman imperialism. It now has, for us, a West-European
imperialistic flavour. I think that, if we are to feel at home in the
world after the present war, we shall have to admit Asia to equality in
our thoughts, not only politically, but culturally. What changes this
will bring about, I do not know, but I am convinced that they will be
profound and of the greatest importance.</p>
