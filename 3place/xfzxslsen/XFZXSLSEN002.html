<h4 id="preface">PREFACE</h4>
<p>A few words of apology and explanation are called for if this book is
to escape even more severe censure than it doubtless deserves.</p>
<p>Apology is due to the specialists on various schools and individual
philosophers. With the possible exception of Leibniz, every philosopher
of whom I treat is better known to some others than to me. If, however,
books covering a wide field are to be written at all, it is inevitable,
since we are not immortal, that those who write such books should spend
less time on any one part than can be spent by a man who concentrates on
a single author or a brief period. Some, whose scholarly austerity is
unbending, will conclude that books covering a wide field should not be
written at all, or, if written, should consist of monographs by a
multitude of authors. There is, however, something lost when many
authors co-operate. If there is any unity in the movement of history, if
there is any intimate relation between what goes before and what comes
later, it is necessary, for setting this forth, that earlier and later
periods should be synthesized in a single mind. The student of Rousseau
may have difficulty in doing justice to his connection with the Sparta
of Plato and Plutarch; the historian of Sparta may not be prophetically
conscious of Hobbes and Fichte and Lenin. To bring out such relations is
one of the purposes of this book, and it is a purpose which only a wide
survey can fulfil.</p>
<p>There are many histories of philosophy, but none of them, so far as I
know, has quite the purpose that I have set myself. Philosophers are
both effects and causes: effects of their social circumstances and of
the politics and institutions of their time; causes (if they are
fortunate) of beliefs which mould the politics and institutions of later
ages. In most histories of philosophy, each philosopher appears as in a
vacuum; his opinions are set forth unrelated except, at most, to those
of earlier philosophers. I have tried, on the contrary, to exhibit each
philosopher, as far as truth permits, as an outcome of his milieu, a man
in whom were crystallized and concentrated thoughts and feelings which,
in a vague and diffused form, were common to the community of which he
was a part.</p>
<p>This has required the insertion of certain chapters of purely social
history. No one can understand the Stoics and Epicureans without some
knowledge of the Hellenistic age, or the scholastics without a modicum
of understanding of the growth of the Church from the fifth to the
thirteenth centuries. I have therefore set forth briefly those parts of
the main historical outlines that seemed to me to have had most
influence on philosophical thought, and I have done this with most
fullness where the history may be expected to be unfamiliar to some
readers—for example, in regard to the early Middle Ages. But in these
historical chapters I have rigidly excluded whatever seemed to have
little or no bearing on contemporary or subsequent philosophy.</p>
<p>The problem of selection, in such a book as the present, is very
difficult. Without detail, a book becomes jejune and uninteresting; with
detail, it is in danger of becoming intolerably lengthy. I have sought a
compromise, by treating only those philosophers who seem to me to have
considerable importance, and mentioning, in connection with them, such
details as, even if not of fundamental importance, have value on account
of some illustrative or vivifying quality.</p>
<p>Philosophy, from the earliest times, has been not merely an affair of
the schools, or of disputation between a handful of learned men. It has
been an integral part of the life of the community, and as such I have
tried to consider it. If there is any merit in this book, it is from
this point of view that it is derived.</p>
<p>This book owes its existence to Dr Albert C. Barnes, having been
originally designed and partly delivered as lectures at the Barnes
Foundation in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As in most of my work during the years since 1932, I have been
greatly assisted in research and in many other ways by my wife, Patricia
Russell.</p>
