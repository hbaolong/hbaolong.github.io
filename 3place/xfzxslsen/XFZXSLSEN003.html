<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>The conceptions of life and the world which we call ‘philosophical’
are a product of two factors: one, inherited religious and ethical
conceptions; the other, the sort of investigation which may be called
‘scientific’, using this word in its broadest sense. Individual
philosophers have differed widely in regard to the proportions in which
these two factors entered into their systems, but it is the presence of
both, in some degree, that characterizes philosophy.</p>

<h5 id="the-relation-between-tradition-and-revelation."><a
href="./hash/0002.html">the relation between tradition and
revelation.</a></h5>
<p>Philosophy, as I shall understand the word, is something intermediate
between theology and science. Like theology, it consists of speculations
on matters as to which definite knowledge has, so far, been
unascertainable; but like science, it appeals to human reason rather
than to authority, whether that of tradition or that of revelation. All
definite knowledge—so I should contend—belongs to science; all dogma as
to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to theology. But between
theology and science there is a No Man’s Land, exposed to attack from
both sides; this No Man’s Land is philosophy. Almost all the questions
of most interest to speculative minds are such as science cannot answer,
and the confident answers of theologians no longer seem so convincing as
they did in former centuries. Is the world divided into mind and matter,
and, if so, what is mind and what is matter? Is mind subject to matter,
or is it possessed of independent powers? Has the universe any unity or
purpose? Is it evolving towards some goal? Are there really laws of
nature, or do we believe in them only because of our innate love of
order? Is man what he seems to the astronomer, a tiny lump of impure
carbon and water impotently crawling on a small and unimportant planet?
Or is he what he appears to Hamlet? Is he perhaps both at once? Is there
a way of living that is noble and another that is base, or are all ways
of living merely futile? If there is a way of living that is noble, in
what does it consist, and how shall we achieve it? Must the good be
eternal in order to deserve to be valued, or is it worth seeking even if
the universe is inexorably moving towards death? Is there such a thing
as wisdom, or is what seems such merely the ultimate refinement of
folly? To such questions no answer can be found in the laboratory.
Theologies have professed to give answers, all too definite; but their
very definiteness causes modern minds to view them with suspicion. The
studying of these questions, if not the answering of them, is the
business of philosophy.</p>

<p>The answer of the historian, in so far as I am capable of giving it,
will appear in the course of this work. Ever since men became capable of
free speculation, their actions, in innumerable important respects, have
depended upon their theories as to the world and human life, as to what
is good and what is evil. This is as true in the present day as at any
former time. To understand an age or a nation, we must understand its
philosophy, and to understand its philosophy we must ourselves be in
some degree philosophers. There is here a reciprocal causation: the
circumstances of men’s lives do much to determine their philosophy, but,
conversely, their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances.
This interaction throughout the centuries will be the topic of the
following pages.</p>
<p>There is also, however, a more personal answer. Science tells us what
we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much
we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great
importance. Theology, on the other hand, induces a dogmatic belief that
we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance, and by doing so
generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe.
Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but
must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting
fairy tales. It is not good either to forget the questions that
philosophy asks, or to persuade ourselves that we have found indubitable
answers to them. To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without
being paralysed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that
philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.</p>
<p>Philosophy, as distinct from theology, began in Greece in the sixth
century B.C. After running its course in antiquity, it was again
submerged by theology as Christianity rose and Rome fell. Its second
great period, from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries, was
dominated by the Catholic Church, except for a few great rebels, such as
the Emperor Frederick II (1195–1250). This period was brought to an end
by the confusions that culminated in the Reformation. The third period,
from the seventeenth century to the present day, is dominated, more than
either of its predecessors, by science; traditional religious beliefs
remain important, but are felt to need justification, and are modified
wherever science seems to make this imperative. Few of the philosophers
of this period are orthodox from a Catholic standpoint, and the secular
State is more important in their speculations than the Church.</p>
<p>Social cohesion and individual liberty, like religion and science,
are in a state of conflict or uneasy compromise throughout the whole
period. In Greece, social cohesion was secured by loyalty to the City
State; even Aristotle, though in his time Alexander was making the City
State obsolete, could see no merit in any other kind of polity. The
degree to which the individual’s liberty was curtailed by his duty to
the City varied widely. In Sparta he had as little liberty as in modem
Germany or Russia; in Athens, in spite of occasional persecutions,
citizens had, in the best period, a very extraordinary freedom from
restrictions imposed by the State. Greek thought down to Aristotle is
dominated by religious and patriotic devotion to the City; its ethical
systems are adapted to the lives of citizens and have a large political
element. When the Greeks became subject, first to the Macedonians, and
then to the Romans, the conceptions appropriate to their days of
independence were no longer applicable. This produced, on the one hand,
a loss of vigour through the breach with tradition, and, on the other
hand, a more individual and less social ethic. The Stoics thought of the
virtuous life as a relation of the soul to God, rather than as a
relation of the citizen to the State. They thus prepared the way for
Christianity, which, like Stoicism, was originally unpolitical, since,
during its first three centuries, its adherents were devoid of influence
on government. Social cohesion, during the six and a half centuries from
Alexander to Constantine, was secured, not by philosophy and not by
ancient loyalties, but by force, first that of armies and then that of
civil administration. Roman armies, Roman roads, Roman law, and Roman
officials first created and then preserved a powerful centralized State.
Nothing was attributable to Roman philosophy, since there was none.</p>
<p>During this long period, the Greek ideas inherited from the age of
freedom underwent a gradual process of transformation. Some of the old
ideas, notably those which we should regard as specifically religious,
gained in relative importance; others, more rationalistic, were
discarded because they no longer suited the spirit of the age. In this
way the later pagans trimmed the Greek tradition until it became
suitable for incorporation in Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>Christianity popularized an important opinion, already implicit in
the teaching of the Stoics, but foreign to the general spirit of
antiquity—I mean, the opinion that a man’s duty to God is more
imperative than his duty to the State.1 This opinion—that ‘we ought to
obey God rather than Man’, as Socrates and the Apostles said—survived
the conversion of Constantine, because the early Christian emperors were
Arians or inclined to Arianism. When the emperors became orthodox, it
fell into abeyance. In the Byzantine Empire it remained latent, as also
in the subsequent Russian Empire, which derived its Christianity from
Constantinople.2 But in the West, where the Catholic emperors were
almost immediately replaced (except in parts of Gaul) by heretical
barbarian conquerors, the superiority of religious to political
allegiance survived, and to some extent still survives.</p>
<p>The barbarian invasion put an end, for six centuries, to the
civilization of western Europe. It lingered in Ireland until the Danes
destroyed it in the ninth century; before its extinction there it
produced one notable figure, Scotus Erigena. In the Eastern Empire,
Greek civilization, in a desiccated form, survived, as in a museum, till
the fall of Constantinople in 1453, but nothing of importance to the
world came out of Constantinople except an artistic tradition and
Justinian’s Codes of Roman law.</p>
<p>During the period of darkness, from the end of the fifth century to
the middle of the eleventh, the western Roman world underwent some very
interesting changes. The conflict between duty to God and duty to the
State, which Christianity had introduced, took the form of a conflict
between Church and king. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Pope
extended over Italy, France, and Spain, Great Britain and Ireland,
Germany, Scandinavia, and Poland. At first, outside Italy and southern
France, his control over bishops and abbots was very slight, but from
the time of Gregory VII (late eleventh century) it became real and
effective. From that time on, the clergy, throughout western Europe,
formed a single organization directed from Rome, seeking power
intelligently and relentlessly, and usually victorious, until after the
year 1300, in their conflicts with secular rulers. The conflict between
Church and State was not only a conflict between clergy and laity; it
was also a renewal of the conflict between the Mediterranean world and
the northern barbarians. The unity of the Church echoed the unity of the
Roman Empire; its liturgy was Latin, and its dominant men were mostly
Italian, Spanish, or southern French. Their education, when education
revived, was classical; their conceptions of law and government would
have been more intelligible to Marcus Aurelius than they were to
contemporary monarchs. The Church represented at once continuity with
the past and what was most civilized in the present.</p>
<p>The secular power, on the contrary, was in the hands of kings and
barons of Teutonic descent, who endeavoured to preserve what they could
of the institutions that they had brought out of the forests of Germany.
Absolute power was alien to those institutions, and so was what appeared
to these vigorous conquerors as a dull and spiritless legality. The king
had to share his power with the feudal aristocracy, but all alike
expected to be allowed occasional outbursts of passion in the form of
war, murder, pillage, or rape. Monarchs might repent, for they were
sincerely pious, and after all, repentance was itself a form of passion.
But the Church could never produce in them the quiet regularity of good
behaviour which a modern employer demands, and usually obtains, of his
employees. What was the use of conquering the world if they could not
drink and murder and love as the spirit moved them? And why should they,
with their armies of proud knights, submit to the orders of bookish men,
vowed to celibacy and destitute of armed force? In spite of
ecclesiastical disapproval, they preserved the duel and trial by battle,
and they developed tournaments and courtly love. Occasionally, in a fit
of rage, they would even murder eminent churchmen.</p>
<p>All the armed force was on the side of the kings, and yet the Church
was victorious. The Church won, partly because it had almost a monopoly
of education, partly because the kings were perpetually at war with each
other, but mainly because, with very few exceptions, rulers and people
alike profoundly believed that the Church possessed the power of the
keys. The Church could decide whether a king should spend eternity in
heaven or in hell; the Church could absolve subjects from the duty of
allegiance, and so stimulate rebellion. The Church, moreover,
represented order in place of anarchy, and consequently won the support
of the rising mercantile class. In Italy, especially, this last
consideration was decisive.</p>
<p>The Teutonic attempt to preserve at least a partial independence of
the Church expressed itself not only in politics, but also in art
romance, chivalry, and war. It expressed itself very little in the
intellectual world, because education was almost wholly confined to the
clergy. The explicit philosophy of the Middle Ages is not an accurate
mirror of the times, but only of what was thought by one party. Among
ecclesiastics, however—especially among the Franciscan friars—a certain
number, for various reasons, were at variance with the Pope. In Italy,
moreover, culture spread to the laity some centuries sooner than it did
north of the Alps. Frederick II, who tried to found a new religion,
represents the extreme of anti-papal culture; Thomas Aquinas, who was
born in the kingdom of Naples where Frederick II was supreme, remains to
this day the classic exponent of papal philosophy. Dante, some fifty
years later, achieved a synthesis, and gave the only balanced exposition
of the complete medieval world of ideas.</p>
<p>After Dante, both for political and for intellectual reasons, the
medieval philosophical synthesis broke down. It had, while it lasted, a
quality of tidiness and miniature completeness; whatever the system took
account of was placed with precision with relation to the other contents
of its very finite cosmos. But the Great Schism, the conciliar movement,
and the Renaissance papacy led up to the Reformation, which destroyed
the unity of Christendom and the scholastic theory of government that
centred round the Pope. In the Renaissance period new knowledge, both of
antiquity and of the earth’s surface, made men tired of systems, which
were felt to be mental prisons. The Copernican astronomy assigned to the
earth and to man a humbler position than they had enjoyed in the
Ptolemaic theory. Pleasure in new facts took the place, among
intelligent men, of pleasure in reasoning, analysing, and systematizing.
Although in art the Renaissance is still orderly, in thought it prefers
a large and fruitful disorder. In this respect, Montaigne is the most
typical exponent of the age.</p>
<p>In the theory of politics, as in everything except art, there was a
collapse of order. The Middle Ages, though turbulent in practice, were
dominated in thought by a passion for legality and by a very precise
theory of political power. All power is ultimately from God; He has
delegated power to the Pope in sacred things and to the Emperor in
secular matters. But Pope and Emperor alike lost their importance during
the fifteenth century. The Pope became merely one of the Italian
princes, engaged in the incredibly complicated and unscrupulous game of
Italian power politics. The new national monarchies in France, Spain,
and England had, in their own territories, a power with which neither
Pope nor Emperor could interfere. The national State, largely owing to
gunpowder, acquired an influence over men’s thoughts and feelings which
it had not had before, and which progressively destroyed what remained
of the Roman belief in the unity of civilization.</p>
<p>This political disorder found expression in Machiavelli’s Prince. In
the absence of any guiding principle, politics becomes a naked struggle
for power; The Prince gives shrewd advice as to how to play this game
successfully. What had happened in the great age of Greece happened
again in Renaissance Italy: traditional moral restraints disappeared,
because they were seen to be associated with superstition; the
liberation from fetters made individuals energetic and creative,
producing a rare florescence of genius; but the anarchy and treachery
which inevitably resulted from the decay of morals made Italians
collectively impotent, and they fell, like the Greeks, under the
domination of nations less civilized than themselves but not so
destitute of social cohesion.</p>
<p>The result, however, was less disastrous than in the case of Greece,
because the newly powerful nations, with the exception of Spain, showed
themselves as capable of great achievement as the Italians had been.</p>
<p>From the sixteenth century onward, the history of European thought is
dominated by the Reformation. The Reformation was a complex many-sided
movement, and owed its success to a variety of causes. In the main, it
was a revolt of the northern nations against the renewed dominion of
Rome. Religion was the force that had subdued the North, but religion in
Italy had decayed: the papacy remained as an institution, and extracted
a huge tribute from Germany and England, but these nations, which were
still pious, could feel no reverence for the Borgias and Medicis, who
professed to save souls from purgatory in return for cash which they
squandered on luxury and immorality. National motives, economic motives,
and moral motives all combined to strengthen the revolt against Rome.
Moreover the Princes soon perceived that, if the Church in their
territories became merely national, they would be able to dominate it,
and would thus become much more powerful at home than they had been
while sharing dominion with the Pope. For all these reasons, Luther’s
theological innovations were welcomed by rulers and peoples alike
throughout the greater part of northern Europe.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church was derived from three sources. Its sacred
history was Jewish, its theology was Greek, its government and canon law
were, at least indirectly, Roman. The Reformation rejected the Roman
elements, softened the Greek elements, and greatly strengthened the
Judaic elements. It thus co-operated with the nationalist forces which
were undoing the work of social cohesion which had been effected first
by the Roman Empire and then by the Roman Church. In Catholic doctrine,
divine revelation did not end with the scriptures, but continued from
age to age through the medium of the Church, to which, therefore, it was
the duty of the individual to submit his private opinions. Protestants,
on the contrary, rejected the Church as a vehicle of revelation; truth
was to be sought only in the Bible, which each man could interpret for
himself. If men differed in their interpretation, there was no divinely
appointed authority to decide the dispute. In practice, the State
claimed the right that had formerly belonged to the Church, but this was
a usurpation. In Protestant theory, there should be no earthly
intermediary between the soul and God.</p>
<p>The effects of this change were momentous. Truth was no longer to be
ascertained by consulting authority, but by inward meditation. There was
a tendency, quickly developed, towards anarchism in politics, and, in
religion, towards mysticism, which had always fitted with difficulty
into the framework of Catholic orthodoxy. There came to be not one
Protestantism, but a multitude of sects; not one philosophy opposed to
scholasticism, but as many as there were philosophers; not, as in the
thirteenth century, one Emperor opposed to the Pope, but a large number
of heretical kings. The result, in thought as in literature, was a
continually deepening subjectivism, operating at first as a wholesome
liberation from spiritual slavery, but advancing steadily towards a
personal isolation inimical to social sanity.</p>
<p>Modern philosophy begins with Descartes, whose fundamental certainty
is the existence of himself and his thoughts, from which the external
world is to be inferred. This was only the first stage in a development,
through Berkeley and Kant, to Fichte, for whom everything is only an
emanation of the ego. This was insanity, and, from this extreme,
philosophy has been attempting, ever since, to escape into the world of
everyday common sense.</p>
<p>With subjectivism in philosophy, anarchism in politics goes hand in
hand. Already during Luther’s lifetime, unwelcome and unacknowledged
disciples had developed the doctrine of Anabaptism, which, for a time,
dominated the city of Münster. The Anabaptists repudiated all law, since
they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by the Holy
Spirit, who cannot be bound by formulas. From this premiss they arrive
at communism and sexual promiscuity; they were therefore exterminated
after a heroic resistance. But their doctrine, in softened forms, spread
to Holland, England and America; historically, it is the source of
Quakerism. A fiercer form of anarchism, no longer connected with
religion, arose in the nineteenth century. In Russia, in Spain, and to a
lesser degree in Italy, it had considerable success, and to this day it
remains a bugbear of the American immigration authorities. This modern
form, though anti-religious, has still much of the spirit of early
Protestantism; it differs mainly in directing against secular
governments the hostility that Luther directed against popes.</p>
<p>Subjectivity, once let loose, could not be confined within limits
until it had run its course. In morals, the Protestant emphasis on the
individual conscience was essentially anarchic. Habit and custom were so
strong that, except in occasional outbreaks such as that of Münster, the
disciples of individualism in ethics continued to act in a manner which
was conventionally virtuous. But this was a precarious equilibrium. The
eighteenth-century cult of ‘sensibility’ began to break it down: an act
was admired, not for its good consequences, or for its conformity to a
moral code, but for the emotion that inspired it. Out of this attitude
developed the cult of the hero, as it is expressed by Carlyle and
Nietzsche, and the Byronic cult of violent passion of no matter what
kind.</p>
<p>The romantic movement, in art, in literature, and in politics, is
bound up with this subjective way of judging men, not as members of a
community, but as aesthetically delightful objects of contemplation.
Tigers are more beautiful than sheep, but we prefer them behind bars.
The typical romantic removes the bars and enjoys the magnificent leaps
with which the tiger annihilates the sheep. He exhorts men to imagine
themselves tigers, and when he succeeds the results are not wholly
pleasant.</p>
<p>Against the more insane forms of subjectivism in modern times there
have been various reactions. First, a half-way compromise philosophy,
the doctrine of liberalism, which attempted to assign the respective
spheres of government and the individual. This begins, in its modern
form, with Locke, who is as much opposed to ‘enthusiasm’—the
individualism of the Anabaptists—as to absolute authority and blind
subservience to tradition. A more thorough-going revolt leads to the
doctrine of State worship, which assigns to the State the position that
Catholicism gave to the Church, or even sometimes, to God. Hobbes,
Rousseau, and Hegel represent different phases of this theory, and their
doctrines are embodied practically in Cromwell, Napoleon, and modern
Germany. Communism, in theory, is far removed from such philosophies,
but is driven, in practice, to a type of community very similar to that
which results from State worship.</p>
<p>Throughout this long development, from 600 B.C. to the present day,
philosophers have been divided into those who wished to tighten social
bonds and those who wished to relax them. With this difference others
have been associated. The disciplinarians have advocated some system of
dogma, either old or new, and have therefore been compelled to be, in a
greater or less degree, hostile to science, since their dogmas could not
be proved empirically. They have almost invariably taught that happiness
is not the good, but that ‘nobility’ or ‘heroism’ is to be preferred.
They have had a sympathy with the irrational parts of human nature,
since they have felt reason to be inimical to social cohesion. The
libertarians, on the other hand, with the exception of the extreme
anarchists, have tended to be scientific, utilitarian, rationalistic,
hostile to violent passion, and enemies of all the more profound forms
of religion. This conflict existed in Greece before the rise of what we
recognize as philosophy, and is already quite explicit in the earliest
Greek thought. In changing forms, it has persisted down to the present
day, and no doubt will persist for many ages to come.</p>
<p>It is clear that each party to this dispute—as to all that persist
through long periods of time—is partly right and partly wrong. Social
cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded in
enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. Every community is
exposed to two opposite dangers, ossification through too much
discipline and reverence for tradition, on the one hand; on the other
hand, dissolution, or subjection to foreign conquest, through the growth
of an individualism and personal independence that makes co-operation
impossible. In general, important civilizations start with a rigid and
superstitious system, gradually relaxed, and leading, at a certain
stage, to a period of brilliant genius, while the good of the old
tradition remains and the evil inherent in its dissolution has not yet
developed. But as the evil unfolds, it leads to anarchy, thence,
inevitably, to a new tyranny, producing a new synthesis secured by a new
system of dogma. The doctrine of liberalism is an attempt to escape from
this endless oscillation. The essence of liberalism is an attempt to
secure a social order not based on irrational dogma, and insuring
stability without involving more restraints than are necessary for the
preservation of the community. Whether this attempt can succeed only the
future can determine.</p>
