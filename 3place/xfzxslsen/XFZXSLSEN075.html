<h4 id="karl-mar">27 KARL MAR</h4>
<p>XKarl Marx is usually thought of as the man who claimed to have made
Socialism scientific, and who did more than anyone else to create the
powerful movement which, by attraction and repulsion, has dominated the
recent history of Europe. It does not come within the scope of the
present work to consider his economics, or his politics except in
certain general aspects; it is only as a philosopher, and an influence
on the philosophy of others, that I propose to deal with him. In this
respect he is difficult to classify. In one aspect, he is an outcome,
like Hodgskin, of the Philosophical Radicals, continuing their
rationalism and their opposition to the romantics. In another aspect he
is a revivifier of materialism, giving it a new interpretation and a new
connection with human history. In yet another aspect he is the last of
the great system-builders, the successor of Hegel, a believer, like him,
in a rational formula summing up the evolution of mankind. Emphasis upon
any one of these aspects at the expense of the others gives a false and
distorted view of his philosophy.</p>
<p>The events of his life in part account for this complexity. He was
born in 1818, at Treves, like St Ambrose. Treves had been profoundly
influenced by the French during the revolutionary and Napoleonic era,
and was much more cosmopolitan in outlook than most parts of Germany.
His ancestors had been rabbis, but his parents became Christian when he
was a child. He married a gentile aristocrat, to whom he remained
devoted throughout his life. At the university he was influenced by the
still prevalent Hegelianism, as also by Feuerbach’s revolt against Hegel
towards materialism. He tried journalism, but the Rheinische Zeitung,
which he edited, was suppressed by the authorities for its radicalism.
After this, in 1843, he went to France to study Socialism. There he met
Engels, who was the manager of a factory in Manchester. Through him he
came to know English labour conditions and English economics. He thus
acquired, before the revolutions of 1848, an unusually international
culture. So far as Western Europe was concerned, he showed no national
bias, This cannot be said of Eastern Europe, for he always despised the
Slavs.</p>
<p>He took part in both the French and the German revolutions of 1848,
but the reaction compelled him to seek refuge in England in 1849. He
spent the rest of his life, with a few brief intervals, in London,
troubled by poverty, illness, and the deaths of children, but
nevertheless indefatigably writing and amassing knowledge. The stimulus
to his work was always the hope of the social revolution, if not in his
lifetime, then in some not very distant future.</p>
<p>Marx, like Bentham and James Mill, will have nothing to do with
romanticism; it is always his intention to be scientific. His economics
is an outcome of British classical economics, changing only the motive
force. Classical economists, consciously or unconsciously, aimed at the
welfare of the capitalist, as opposed both to the landowner and to the
wage-earner; Marx, on the contrary, set to work to represent the
interest of the wage-earner. He had in youth—as appears in the Communist
Manifesto of 1848—the fire and passion appropriate to a new
revolutionary movement, as liberalism had had in the time of Milton. But
he was always anxious to appeal to evidence, and never relied upon any
extra-scientific intuition.</p>
<p>He called himself a materialist, but not of the eighteenth-century
sort. His sort, which, under Hegelian influence, he called
‘dialectical’, differed in an important way from traditional
materialism, and was more akin to what is now called instrumentalism.
The older materialism, he said, mistakenly regarded sensation as
passive, and thus attributed activity primarily to the object. In Marx’s
view, all sensation or perception is an interaction between subject and
object; the bare object, apart from the activity of the percipient, is a
mere raw material, which is transformed in the process of becoming
known. Knowledge in the old sense of passive contemplation is an unreal
abstraction; the process that really takes place is one of handling
things. ‘The question whether objective truth belongs to human thinking
is not a question of theory, but a practical question,’ he says. ’The
truth, i.e. the reality and power, of thought must be demonstrated in
practice. The contest as to the reality or non-reality of a thought
which is isolated from practice, is a purely scholastic question….
Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, but the
real task is to alter it.’1</p>
<p>I think we may interpret Marx as meaning that the process which
philosophers have called the pursuit of knowledge is not, as has been
thought, one in which the object is constant while all the adaptation is
on the part of</p>
<p>the knower. On the contrary, both subject and object, both the knower
and the thing known, are in a continual process of mutual adaptation. He
calls the process ‘dialectical’ because it is never fully completed.</p>
<p>It is essential to this theory to deny the reality of ‘sensation’ as
conceived by British empiricists. What happens, when it is most nearly
what they mean by ‘sensation’, would be better called ‘noticing’, which
implies activity. In fact—so Marx would contend—we only notice things as
part of the process of acting with reference to them, and any theory
which leaves out action is a misleading abstraction.</p>
<p>So far as I know, Marx was the first philosopher who criticized the
notion of ‘truth’ from this activist point of view. In him this
criticism was not much emphasized, and I shall therefore say no more
about it here, leaving the examination of the theory to a later
chapter.</p>
<p>Marx’s philosophy of history is a blend of Hegel and British
economics. Like Hegel, he thinks that the world develops according to a
dialectical formula, but he totally disagrees with Hegel as to the
motive force of this development. Hegel believed in a mystical entity
called ‘Spirit’, which causes human history to develop according to the
stages of the dialectic as set forth in Hegel’s Logic. Why Spirit has to
go through these stages is not clear. One is tempted to suppose that
Spirit is trying to understand Hegel, and at each stage rashly
objectifies what it has been reading. Marx’s dialectic has none of this
quality except a certain inevitableness. For Marx, matter, not spirit,
is the driving force. But it is a matter in the peculiar sense that we
have been considering, not the wholly dehumanized matter of the
atomists. This means that, for Marx, the driving force is really man’s
relation to matter, of which the most important part is his mode of
production. In this way Marx’s materialism, in practice, becomes
economics.</p>
<p>The politics, religion, philosophy, and art of any epoch in human
history are, according to Marx, an outcome of its methods of production,
and, to a lesser extent, of distribution. I think he would not maintain
that this applies to all the niceties of culture, but only to its broad
outlines. The doctrine is called the ‘materialist conception of
history’. This is a very important thesis; in particular, it concerns
the historian of philosophy. I do not myself accept the thesis as it
stands, but I think that it contains very important elements of truth,
and I am aware that it has influenced my own views of philosophical
development as set forth in the present work. Let us, to begin with,
consider the history of philosophy in relation to Marx’s doctrine.</p>
<p>Subjectively, every philosopher appears to himself to be engaged in
the pursuit of something which may be called ‘truth’. Philosophers may
differ as to the definition of ‘truth’, but at any rate it is something
objective, something which, in some sense, everybody ought to accept. No
man would engage in the pursuit of philosophy if he thought that all
philosophy is merely an expression of irrational bias. But every
philosopher will agree that many other philosophers have been actuated
by bias, and have had extra-rational reasons, of which they were usually
unconscious, for many of their opinions. Marx, like the rest, believes
in the truth of his own doctrines; he does not regard them as nothing
but an expression of the feelings natural to a rebellious middle-class
German Jew in the middle of the nineteenth century. What can be said
about this conflict between the subjective and objective views of a
philosophy?</p>
<p>We may say, in a broad way, that Greek philosophy down to Aristotle
expresses the mentality appropriate to the City State; that Stoicism is
appropriate to a cosmopolitan despotism; that scholastic philosophy is
an intellectual expression of the Church as an organization; that
philosophy since Descartes, or at any rate since Locke, tends to embody
the prejudices of the commercial middle class; and that Marxism and
Fascism are philosophies appropriate to the modern industrial State.
This, I think, is both true and important. I think, however, that Marx
is wrong in two respects. First, the social circumstances of which
account must be taken are quite as much political as economic; they have
to do with power, of which wealth is only one form. Second, social
causation largely ceases to apply as soon as a problem becomes detailed
and technical. The first of these objections I have set forth in my book
Power, and I shall therefore say no more about it. The second more
intimately concerns the history of philosophy, and I will give some
examples of its scope.</p>
<p>Take, first, the problem of universals. This problem was first
discussed by Plato, then by Aristotle, by the Schoolmen, by the British
empiricists, and by the most modern logicians. It would be absurd to
deny that bias has influenced the opinions of philosophers on this
question. Plato was influenced by Parmenides and Orphism; he wanted an
eternal world, and could not believe in the ultimate reality of the
temporal flux. Aristotle was more empirical, and had no dislike of the
every-day world. Thorough-going empiricists in modern times have a bias
which is the opposite of Plato’s: they find the thought of a
super-sensible world unpleasant, and are willing to go to great lengths
to avoid having to believe in it. But these opposing kinds of bias are
perennial, and have only a somewhat remote connection with the social
system. It is said that love of the eternal is characteristic of a
leisure class, which lives on the labour of others. I doubt if this is
true. Epictetus and Spinoza were not gentlemen of leisure. It might be
urged, on the contrary, that the conception of heaven as a place where
nothing is done is that of weary toilers who want nothing but rest. Such
argumentation can be carried on indefinitely, and leads nowhere.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we come to the detail of the controversy
about universals, we find that each side can invent arguments which the
other side will admit to be valid. Some of Aristotle’s criticisms of
Plato on this question have been almost universally accepted. In quite
recent times, although no decision has been reached, a new technique has
been developed, and many incidental problems have been solved. It is not
irrational to hope that, before very long, a definite agreement may be
reached by logicians on this question.</p>
<p>Take, as a second example, the ontological argument. This, as we have
seen, was invented by Anselm, rejected by Thomas Aquinas, accepted by
Descartes, refuted by Kant, and reinstated by Hegel. I think it may be
said quite decisively that, as a result of analysis of the concept
‘existence’, modern logic has proved this argument invalid. This is not
a matter of temperament or of the social system; it is a purely
technical matter. The refutation of the argument affords, of course, no
ground for supposing its conclusion, namely the existence of God, to be
untrue; if it did, we cannot suppose that Thomas Aquinas would have
rejected the argument.</p>
<p>Or take the question of materialism. This is a word which is capable
of many meanings; we have seen that Marx radically altered its
significance. The heated controversies as to its truth or falsehood have
largely depended, for their continued vitality, upon avoidance of
definition. When the term is defined, it will be found that, according
to some possible definitions, materialism is demonstrably false;
according to certain others, it may be true, though there is no positive
reason to think so; while according to yet other definitions there are
some reasons in its favour, though these reasons are not conclusive. All
this, again, depends upon technical considerations, and has nothing to
do with the social system.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is really fairly simple. What is
conventionally called ‘philosophy’ consists of two very different
elements. On the one hand, there are questions which are scientific or
logical; these are amenable to methods as to which there is general
agreement. On the other hand, there are questions of passionate interest
to large numbers of people, as to which there is no solid evidence
either way. Among the latter are practical questions as to which it is
impossible to remain aloof. When there is a war, I must support my own
country or come into painful conflict both with friends and with the
authorities. At many times there has been no middle course between
supporting and opposing the official religion. For one reason or
another, we all find it impossible to maintain an attitude of sceptical
detachment on many issues as to which pure reason is silent. A
‘philosophy’, in a very usual sense of the word, is an organic whole of
such extra-rational decisions. It is in regard to ‘philosophy’ in this
sense that Marx’s contention is largely true. But even in this sense a
philosophy is determined by other social causes as well as by those that
are economic. War, especially, has its share in historical causation;
and victory in war does not always go to the side with the greatest
economic resources.</p>
<p>Marx fitted his philosophy of history into a mould suggested by
Hegelian dialectic, but in fact there was only one triad that concerned
him: feudalism, represented by the landowner; capitalism, represented by
the industrial employer; and Socialism, represented by the wage-earner.
Hegel thought of nations as the vehicles of dialectic movement; Marx
substituted classes. He disclaimed always all ethical or humanitarian
reasons for preferring Socialism or taking the side of the wage-earner;
he maintained, not that this side was ethically better, but that it was
the side taken by the dialectic in its wholly deterministic movement. He
might have said that he did not advocate Socialism, but only prophesied
it. This, however, would not have been wholly true. He undoubtedly
believed every dialectical movement to be, in some impersonal sense, a
progress, and he certainly held that Socialism, once established, would
minister to human happiness more than either feudalism or capitalism
have done. These beliefs, though they must have controlled his life,
remained largely in the background so far as his writings are concerned.
Occasionally, however, he abandons calm prophecy for vigorous
exhortation to rebellion, and the emotional basis of his ostensibly
scientific prognostications is implicit in all he wrote.</p>
<p>Considered purely as a philosopher, Marx has grave shortcomings. He
is too practical, too much wrapped up in the problems of his time. His
purview is confined to this planet, and, within this planet, to Man.
Since Copernicus, it has been evident that Man has not the cosmic
importance which he formerly arrogated to himself. No man who has failed
to assimilate this fact has a right to call his philosophy
scientific.</p>
<p>There goes with this limitation to terrestrial affairs a readiness to
believe in progress as a universal law. This readiness characterized the
nineteenth century, and existed in Marx as much as in his
contemporaries. It is only because of the belief in the inevitability of
progress that Marx thought it possible to dispense with ethical
considerations. If Socialism was coming, it must be an improvement. He
would have readily admitted that it would not seem to be an improvement
to landowners or capitalists, but that only showed that they were out of
harmony with the dialectic movement of the time. Marx professed himself
an atheist, but retained a cosmic optimism which only theism could
justify.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, all the elements in Marx’s philosophy which are
derived from Hegel are unscientific, in the sense that there is no
reason whatever to suppose them true.</p>
<p>Perhaps the philosophic dress that Marx gave to his Socialism had
really not much to do with the basis of his opinions. It is easy to
restate the most important part of what he had to say without any
reference to the dialectic. He was impressed by the appalling cruelty of
the industrial system as it existed in England a hundred years ago,
which he came to know thoroughly through Engels and the reports of Royal
Commissions. He saw that the system was likely to develop from free
competition towards monopoly, and that its injustice must produce a
movement of revolt in the proletariat. He held that, in a thoroughly
industrialized community, the only alternative to private capitalism is
State ownership of land and capital. None of these propositions are
matters for philosophy, and I shall therefore not consider their truth
or falsehood. The point is that, if true, they suffice to establish what
is practically important in his system. The Hegelian trappings might
therefore be dropped with advantage.</p>
<p>This history of Marx’s reputation has been peculiar. In his own
country his doctrines inspired the programme of the Social Democratic
Party, which grew steadily until, in the general election of 1912, it
secured one third of all the votes cast. Immediately after the first
world war, the Social Democratic Party was for a time in power, and
Ebert, the first president of the Weimar Republic, was a member of it;
but by this time the Party had ceased to adhere to Marxist orthodoxy.
Meanwhile, in Russia, fanatical believers in Marx had acquired the
government. In the West, no large working-class movement has been quite
Marxist; the British Labour Party, at times, has seemed to move in that
direction, but has nevertheless adhered to an empirical type of
Socialism. Large numbers of intellectuals, however, have been profoundly
influenced by him, both in England and in America. In Germany all
advocacy of his doctrines has been forcibly suppressed, but may be
expected to revive when the Nazis are overthrown.2</p>
<p>Modern Europe and America have thus been divided, politically and
ideologically, into three camps. There are Liberals, who still, as far
as may be, follow Locke or Bentham, but with varying degrees of
adaptation to the needs of industrial organization. There are Marxists,
who control the Government in Russia, and are likely to become
increasingly influential in various other countries. These two sections
of opinion are philosophically not very widely separated, both are
rationalistic, and both, in intention, are scientific and empirical. But
from the point of view of practical politics the division is sharp. It
appears already in the letter of James Mill quoted in the preceding
chapter, saying ‘their notions of property look ugly’.</p>
<p>It must, however, be admitted that there are certain respects in
which the rationalism of Marx is subject to limitations. Although he
holds that his interpretation of the trend of development is true, and
will be borne out by events, he believes that the argument will only
appeal (apart from rare exceptions) to those whose class interest is in
agreement with it. He hopes little from persuasion, everything from the
class war. He is thus committed in practice to power politics, and to
the doctrine of a master class, though not of</p>
<p>va master race. It is true that, as a result of the social
revolution, the division of classes is expected ultimately to disappear,
giving place to complete political and economic harmony. But this is a
distant ideal, like the Second Coming; in the meantime, there is war and
dictatorship, and insistence upon ideological orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The third section of modern opinion, represented politically by Nazis
and Fascists, differs philosophically from the other two far more
profoundly than they differ from each other. It is anti-rational and
anti-scientific. Its philosophical progenitors are Rousseau, Fichte, and
Nietzsche. It emphasizes will, especially will to power; this it
believes to be mainly concentrated in certain races and individuals, who
therefore have a right to rule.</p>
<p>Until Rousseau, the philosophical world had a certain unity. This has
disappeared for the time being, but perhaps not for long. It can be
recovered by a rationalistic reconquest of men’s minds, but not in any
other way, since claims to mastery can only breed strife.</p>
