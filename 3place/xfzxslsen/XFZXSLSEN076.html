<h4 id="bergson">28 BERGSON</h4>
<p>Henri Bergson was the leading French philosopher of the present
century. He influenced William James and Whitehead, and had a
considerable effect upon French thought. Sorel, who was a vehement
advocate of syndicalism and the author of a book called Reflections on
Violence, used Bergsonian irrationalism to justify a revolutionary
labour movement having no definite goal. In the end, however, Sorel
abandoned syndicalism and became a royalist. The main effect of
Bergson’s philosophy was conservative, and it harmonized easily with the
movement which culminated in Vichy. But Bergson’s irrationalism made a
wide appeal quite unconnected with politics, for instance to Bernard
Shaw, whose Back to Methuselah is pure Bergsonism. Forgetting politics,
it is in its purely philosophical aspect that we must consider it. I
have dealt with it somewhat fully as it exemplifies admirably the revolt
against reason which, beginning with Rousseau, has gradually dominated
larger and larger areas in the life and thought of the world.</p>
<p>The classification of philosophies is effected, as a rule, either by
their methods or by their results: ‘empirical’ and ‘a priori’ is a
classification by methods, ‘realist’ and ‘idealist’ is a classification
by results. An attempt to classify Bergson’s philosophy in either of
these ways is hardly likely to be successful, since it cuts across all
the recognized divisions.</p>
<p>But there is another way of classifying philosophies, less precise,
but perhaps more helpful to the non-philosophical; in this way, the
principle of division is according to the predominant desire which has
led the philosopher to philosophize. Thus we shall have philosophies of
feeling, inspired by the love of happiness; theoretical philosophies,
inspired by the love of knowledge; and practical philosophies, inspired
by the love of action.</p>
<p>Among philosophies of feeling we shall place all those which are
primarily optimistic or pessimistic, all those that offer schemes of
salvation or try to prove that salvation is impossible; to this class
belong most religious philosophies. Among theoretical philosophies we
shall place most of the great systems; for though the desire for
knowledge is rare, it has been the source of most of what is best in
philosophy. Practical philosophies, on the other hand, will be those
which regard action as the supreme good, considering happiness an effect
and knowledge a mere instrument of successful activity. Philosophies of
this type would have been common among Western Europeans if philosophers
had been average men; as it is, they have been rare until recent times;
in fact their chief representatives are the pragmatists and Bergson. In
the rise of this type of philosophy we may see, as Bergson himself does,
the revolt of the modern man of action against the authority of Greece,
and more particularly of Plato; or we may connect it, as Dr Schiller
apparently would, with imperialism and the motor-car. The modern world
calls for such a philosophy, and the success which it has achieved is
therefore not surprising.</p>
<p>Bergson’s philosophy, unlike most of the systems of the past, is
dualistic: the world, for him, is divided into two disparate portions,
on the one hand life, on the other matter, or rather that inert
something which the intellect views as matter. The whole universe is the
clash and conflict of two opposite motions: life, which climbs upward,
and matter, which falls downward. Life is one great force, one vast
vital impulse, given once for all from the beginning of the world,
meeting the resistance of matter, struggling to break a way through
matter, learning gradually to use matter by means of organization;
divided by the obstacles it encounters into diverging currents, like the
wind at a street-corner; partly subdued by matter through the very
adaptations which matter forces upon it; yet retaining always its
capacity for free activity, struggling always to find new outlets,
seeking always for greater liberty of movement amid the opposing walls
of matter.</p>
<p>Evolution is not primarily explicable by adaptation to environment;
adaptation explains only the turns and twists of evolution, like the
windings of a road approaching a town through hilly country. But this
simile is not quite adequate; there is no town, no definite goal, at the
end of the road along which evolution travels. Mechanism and teleology
suffer from the same defect: both suppose that there is no essential
novelty in the world. Mechanism regards the future as implicit in the
past, and teleology, since it believes that the end to be achieved can
be known in advance, denies that any essential novelty is contained in
the result.</p>
<p>As against both these views, though with more sympathy for teleology
than for mechanism, Bergson maintains that evolution is truly creative,
like the work of an artist. An impulse to action, an undefined want,
exists beforehand, but until the want is satisfied it is impossible to
know the nature of what will satisfy it. For example, we may suppose
some vague desire in sightless animals to be able to be aware of objects
before they were in contact with them. This led to efforts which finally
resulted in the creation of eyes. Sight satisfied the desire, but could
not have been imagined beforehand. For this reason, evolution is
unpredictable, and determinism cannot refute the advocates of free
will.</p>
<p>This broad outline is filled in by an account of the actual
development of life on the earth. The first division of the current was
into plants and animals; plants aimed at storing up energy in a
reservoir, animals aimed at using energy for sudden and rapid movements.
But among animals, at a later stage, a new bifurcation appeared:
instinct and intellect became more or less separated. They are never
wholly without each other, but in the main intellect is the misfortune
of man, while instinct is seen at its best in ants, bees, and Bergson.
The division between intellect and instinct is fundamental in his
philosophy, much of which is a kind of Sandford and Merton, with
instinct as the good boy and intellect as the bad boy.</p>
<p>Instinct at its best is called intuition. ‘By intuition,’ he says, ‘I
mean instinct that has become disinterested, self-conscious, capable of
reflecting upon its object and of enlarging it indefinitely.’ The
account of the doings of intellect is not always easy to follow, but if
we are to understand Bergson we must do our best.</p>
<p>Intelligence or intellect, ‘as it leaves the hands of nature, has for
its chief object the inorganic solid’; it can only form a clear idea of
the discontinuous and immobile; its concepts are outside each other like
objects in space, and have the same stability. The intellect separates
in space and fixes in time; it is not made to think evolution, but to
represent becoming as a series of states. ‘The intellect is
characterized by a natural inability to understand life’; geometry and
logic, which are its typical products, are strictly applicable to solid
bodies, but elsewhere reasoning must be checked by common sense, which,
as Bergson truly says, is a very different thing. Solid bodies, it would
seem, are something which mind has created on purpose to apply intellect
to them, much as it has created chess-boards in order to play chess on
them. The genesis of intellect and the genesis of material bodies, we
are told, are correlative; both have been developed by reciprocal
adaptation. ‘An identical process must have cut out matter and the
intellect, at the same time, from a stuff that contained both.’</p>
<p>This conception of the simultaneous growth of matter and intellect is
ingenious, and deserves to be understood. Broadly, I think, what is
meant is this: Intellect is the power of seeing things as separate one
from another, and matter is that which is separated into distinct
things. In reality there are no separate solid things, only an endless
stream of becoming, in which nothing becomes and there is nothing that
this nothing becomes. But becoming may be a movement up or a movement
down: when it is a movement up it is called life, when it is a movement
down it is what, as misapprehended by the intellect, is called matter. I
suppose the universe is shaped like a cone, with the Absolute at the
vertex, for the movement up brings things together, while the movement
down separates them, or at least seems to do so. In order that the
upward motion of mind may be able to thread its way through the downward
motion of the falling bodies which hail upon it, it must be able to cut
out paths between them; thus as intelligence was formed, outlines and
paths appeared, and the primitive flux was cut up into separate bodies.
The intellect may be compared to a carver, but it has the peculiarity of
imagining that the chicken always was the separate pieces into which the
carving-knife divides it.</p>
<p>As intellect is connected with space, so instinct or intuition is
connected with time. It is one of the noteworthy features of Bergson’s
philosophy that, unlike most writers, he regards time and space as
profoundly dissimilar. Space, the characteristic of matter, arises from
a dissection of the flux which is really illusory, useful, up to a
certain point, in practice, but utterly misleading in theory. Time, on
the contrary, is the essential characteristic of life or mind. ‘Wherever
anything lives,’ he says, ‘there is, open somewhere, a register in which
time is being inscribed.’ But the time here spoken of is not
mathematical time, the homogeneous assemblage of mutually external
instants. Mathematical time, according to Bergson, is really a form of
space; the time which is of the essence of life is what he calls
duration. This conception of duration is fundamental in his philosophy;
it appears already in his earliest book Time and Free Will, and it is
necessary to understand it if we are to have any comprehension of his
system. It is, however, a very difficult conception. I do not fully
understand it myself, and therefore I cannot hope to explain it with all
the lucidity which it doubtless deserves.</p>
<p>‘Pure duration,’ we are told, ‘is the form which our conscious states
assume when our ego lets itself live, when it refrains from separating
its present state from its former states’. It forms the past and the
present into one organic whole, where there is mutual penetration,
succession without distinction. ‘Within our ego, there is succession
without mutual externality; outside the ego, in pure space, there is
mutual externality without succession.’</p>
<p>‘Questions relating to subject and object, to their distinction and
their union, should be put in terms of time rather than of space.’ In
the duration in which we see ourselves acting, there are dissociated
elements; but in the duration in which we act, our states melt into each
other. Pure duration is what is most removed from externality and least
penetrated with externality, a duration in which the past is big with a
present absolutely new. But then our will is strained to the utmost; we
have to gather up the past which is slipping away, and thrust it whole
and undivided into the present. At such moments we truly possess
ourselves, but such moments are rare. Duration is the very stuff of
reality, which is perpetual becoming, never something made.</p>
<p>It is above all in memory that duration exhibits itself, for in
memory the past survives in the present. Thus the theory of memory
becomes of great importance in Bergson’s philosophy. Matter and Memory
is concerned to show the relation of mind and matter, of which both are
affirmed to be real, by an analysis of memory, which is ‘just the
intersection of mind and matter’.</p>
<p>There are, he says, two radically different things, both of which are
commonly called memory; the distinction between these two is much
emphasized by Bergson. ‘The past survives,’ he says, ‘under two distinct
forms: first, in motor mechanisms; secondly, in independent
recollections.’ For example, a man is said to remember a poem if he can
repeat it by heart, that is to say, if he has acquired a certain habit
or mechanism enabling him to repeat a former action. But he might, at
least theoretically, be able to repeat the poem without any recollection
of the previous occasions on which he has read it; thus there is no
consciousness of past events involved in this sort of memory. The second
sort, which alone really deserves to be called memory, is exhibited in
recollections of separate occasions when he has read the poem, each
unique and with a date. Here, he thinks, there can be no question of
habit, since each event only occurred once, and had to make its
impression immediately. It is suggested that in some way everything that
has happened to us is remembered, but as a rule only what is useful
comes into consciousness. Apparent failures of memory, it is argued, are
not really failures of the mental part of memory, but of the motor
mechanism for bringing memory into action. This view is supported by a
discussion of brain physiology and the facts of amnesia, from which it
is held to result that true memory is not a function of the brain. The
past must be acted by matter, imagined by mind. Memory is not an
emanation of matter; indeed the contrary would be nearer the truth if we
mean matter as grasped in concrete perception, which always occupies a
certain duration.</p>
<p>‘Memory must be, in principle, a power absolutely independent of
matter. If, then, spirit is a reality, it is here, in the phenomena of
memory, that we may come into touch with it experimentally.’</p>
<p>At the opposite end from pure memory Bergson places pure perception,
in regard to which he adopts an ultra-realist position. ‘In pure
perception,’ he says, ‘we are actually placed outside ourselves, we
touch the reality of the object in an immediate intuition.’ So
completely does he identify perception with its object that he almost
refuses to call it mental at all. ‘Pure perception,’ he says, ‘which is
the lowest degree of mind—mind without memory—is really part of matter,
as we understand matter.’ Pure perception is constituted by dawning
action, its actuality lies in its activity. It is in this way that the
brain becomes relevant to perception, for the brain is not an instrument
of action. The function of the brain is to limit our mental life to what
is practically useful. But for the brain, one gathers, everything would
be perceived, but in fact we only perceive what interests us. ‘The body,
always turned towards action, has for its essential function to limit,
with a view to action, the life of the spirit.’ It is, in fact, an
instrument of choice.</p>
<p>In the above outline, I have in the main endeavoured merely to state
Bergson’s views, without giving the reasons adduced by him in favour of
their truth. This is easier than it would be with most philosophers,
since as a rule he does not give reasons for his opinions, but relies on
their inherent attractiveness, and on the charm of an excellent style.
Like advertisers, he relies upon picturesque and varied statement, and
on apparent explanation of many obscure facts. Analogies and similes,
especially, form a very large part of the whole process by which he
recommends his views to the reader. The number of similes for life to be
found in his works exceeds the number in any poet known to me. Life, he
says, is like a shell bursting into fragments which are again shells. It
is like a sheaf. Initially, it was ‘a tendency to accumulate in a
reservoir, as do especially the green parts of vegetables’. But the
reservoir is to be filled with boiling water from which steam is
issuing; ‘jets must be gushing out unceasingly, of which each, falling
back, is a world’. Again ‘life appears in its entirety as an immense
wave which, starting from a centre, spreads outwards, and which on
almost the whole of its circumference is stopped and converted into
oscillation: at one single point the obstacle has been forced, the
impulsion has passed freely’. Then there is the great climax in which
life is compared to a cavalry charge. ‘All organized beings, from the
humblest to the highest, from the first origins of life to the time in
which we are, and in all places as in all times, do but evidence a
single impulsion, the inverse of the movement of matter, and in itself
indivisible. All the living hold together, and all yield to the same
tremendous push. The animal takes its stand on the plant, man bestrides
animality, and the whole of humanity, in space and in time, is one
immense army galloping beside and before and behind each of us in an
overwhelming charge able to beat down every resistance and to clear many
obstacles, perhaps even death.’</p>
<p>But a cool critic, who feels himself a mere spectator, perhaps an
unsympathetic spectator, of the charge in which man is mounted upon
animality, may be inclined to think that calm and careful thought is
hardly compatible with this form of exercise. When he is told that
thought is a mere means of action, the mere impulse to avoid obstacles
in the field, he may feel that such a view is becoming in a cavalry
officer, but not in a philosopher, whose business, after all, is with
thought: he may feel that in the passion and noise of violent motion
there is no room for the fainter music of reason, no leisure for the
disinterested contemplation in which greatness is sought, not by
turbulence, but by the greatness of the universe which is mirrored. In
that case, he may be tempted to ask whether there are any reasons for
accepting such a restless view of the world. And if he asks this
question, he will find, if I am not mistaken, that there is no reason
whatever for accepting this view, either in the universe or in the
writings of M. Bergson.</p>
<p>One of the bad effects of an anti-intellectual philosophy, such as
that of Bergson, is that it thrives upon the errors and confusions of
the intellect. Hence it is led to prefer bad thinking to good, to
declare every momentary difficulty insoluble, and to regard every
foolish mistake as revealing the bankruptcy of intellect and the triumph
of intuition. There are in Bergson’s works many allusions to mathematics
and science, and to a careless reader these allusions may seem to
strengthen his philosophy greatly. As regards science, especially
biology and physiology, I am not competent to criticize his
interpretations. But as regards mathematics, he has deliberately
preferred traditional errors in interpretation to the more modern views
which have prevailed among mathematicians for the last eighty years. In
this matter, he has followed the example of most philosophers. In the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the infinitesimal calculus,
though well developed as a method, was supported, as regards its
foundations, by many fallacies and much confused thinking. Hegel and his
followers seized upon these fallacies and confusions, to support them in
their attempt to prove all mathematics self-contradictory. Thence the
Hegelian account of these matters passed into the current thought of
philosophers, where it has remained long after the mathematicians have
removed all the difficulties upon which the philosophers rely. And so
long as the main object of philosophers is to show that nothing can be
learned by patience and detailed thinking, but that we ought rather to
worship the prejudices of the ignorant under the title of ‘reason’ if we
are Hegelians, or of ‘intuition’ if we are Bergsonians, so long
philosophers will take care to remain ignorant of what mathematicians
have done to remove the errors by which Hegel profited.</p>
<p>Apart from the question of number, which we have already considered,
the chief point at which Bergson touches mathematics is his rejection of
what he calls the ‘cinematographic’ representation of the world.
Mathematics conceives change, even continuous change, as constituted by
a series of states; Bergson, on the contrary, contends that no series of
states can represent what is continuous, and that in change a thing is
never in any state at all. The view that change is constituted by a
series of changing states he calls cinematographic; this view, he says,
is natural to the intellect, but is radically vicious. True change can
only be explained by true duration; it involves an interpenetration of
past and present, not a mathematical succession of static states. This
is what is called a ‘dynamic’ instead of a ‘static’ view of the world.
The question is important, and in spite of its difficulty we cannot pass
it by.</p>
<p>Bergson’s theory of duration is bound up with his theory of memory.
According to this theory, things remembered survive in memory, and thus
interpenetrate present things: past and present are not mutually
external, but are mingled in the unity of consciousness. Action, he
says, is what constitutes being; but mathematical time is a mere passive
receptacle, which does nothing and therefore is nothing. The past, he
says, is that which acts no longer, and the present is that which is
acting. But in this statement, as indeed throughout his account of
duration, Bergson is unconsciously assuming the ordinary mathematical
time; without this, his statements are unmeaning. What is meant by
saying ‘the past is essentially that which acts no longer’ (his
italics), except that the past is that of which the action is past? the
words ‘no longer’ are words expressive of the past; to a person who did
not have the ordinary notion of the past as something outside the
present, these words would have no meaning. Thus his definition is
circular. What he says is, in effect, ‘the past is that of which the
action is in the past’. As a definition, this cannot be regarded as a
happy effort. And the same applies to the present. The present, we are
told, is ‘that which is acting’ (his italics). But the word ‘is’
introduces just that idea of the present which was to be defined. The
present is that which is acting as opposed to that which was acting or
will be acting. That is to say, the present is that whose action is in
the present, not in the past or in the future. Again the definition is
circular. An earlier passage on the same page will illustrate the
fallacy further. ‘That which constitutes our pure perception,’ he says,
‘is our dawning action…. The actuality of our perception thus lies in
its activity, in the movements which prolong it, and not in its greater
intensity: the past is only idea, the present is ideo-motor.’ This
passage makes it quite clear that, when Bergson speaks of the past, he
does not mean the past, but our present memory of the past. The past
when it existed was just as active as the present is now; if Bergson’s
account were correct, the present moment ought to be the only one in the
whole history of the world containing any activity. In earlier times
there were other perceptions, just as active, just as actual in their
day, as our present perceptions; the past, in its day, was by no means
only idea, but was in its intrinsic character just what the present is
now. This real past, however, Bergson simply forgets; what he speaks of
is the present idea of the past. The real past does not mingle with the
present, since it is not part of it; but that is a very different
thing.</p>
<p>The whole of Bergson’s theory of duration and time rests throughout
on the elementary confusion between the present occurrence of a
recollection and the past occurrence which is recollected. But for the
fact that time is so familiar to us, the vicious circle involved in his
attempt to deduce the past as what is no longer active would be obvious
at once. As it is, what Bergson gives is an account of the difference
between perception and recollection—both present facts—and what he
believes himself to have given is an account of the difference between
the present and the past. As soon as this confusion is realized, his
theory of time is seen to be simply a theory which omits time
altogether.</p>
<p>Of course a large part of Bergson’s philosophy, probably the part to
which most of its popularity is due, does not depend upon argument, and
cannot be upset by argument. His imaginative picture of the world,
regarded as a poetic effort, is in the main not capable of either proof
or disproof. Shakespeare says life’s but a walking shadow, Shelley says
it is like a dome of many-coloured glass, Bergson says it is a shell
which bursts into parts that are again shells. If you like Bergson’s
image better, it is just as legitimate.</p>
<p>The good which Bergson hopes to see realized in the world is action
for the sake of action. All pure contemplation he calls ‘dreaming’, and
condemns by a whole series of uncomplimentary epithets: static,
Platonic, mathematical, logical, intellectual. Those who desire some
prevision of the end which action is to achieve are told that an end
foreseen would be nothing new, because desire, like memory, is
identified with its object. Thus we are condemned, in action, to be the
blind slaves of instinct: the life-force pushes us on from behind,
restlessly and unceasingly. There is no room in this philosophy for the
moment of contemplative insight when, rising above the animal life, we
become conscious of the greater ends that redeem man from the life of
the brutes. Those to whom activity without purpose seems a sufficient
good will find in Bergson’s books a pleasing picture of the universe.
But those to whom action, if it is to be of any value, must be inspired
by some vision, by some imaginative foreshadowing of a world less
painful, less unjust, less full of strife than the world of our everyday
life, those, in a word, whose action is built on contemplation, will
find in this philosophy nothing of what they seek, and will not regret
that there is no reason to think it true.</p>
