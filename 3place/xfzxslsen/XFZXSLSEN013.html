<h4 id="protagoras">10 PROTAGORAS</h4>
<p>The great pre-Socratic systems that we have been considering were
confronted, in the latter half of the fifth century, by a sceptical
movement, in which the most important figure was Protagoras, chief of
the Sophists. The word ‘Sophist’ had originally no bad connotation; it
meant, as nearly as may be, what we mean by ‘professor’. A Sophist was a
man who made his living by teaching young men certain things that, it
was thought, would be useful to them in practical life. As there was no
public provision for such education, the Sophists taught only those who
had private means, or whose parents had. This tended to give them a
certain class bias, which was increased by the political circumstances
of the time. In Athens and many other cities, democracy was politically
triumphant, but nothing had been done to diminish the wealth of those
who belonged to the old aristocratic families. It was, in the main, the
rich who embodied what appears to us as Hellenic culture: they had
education and leisure, travel had taken the edge off their traditional
prejudices, and the time that they spent in discussion sharpened their
wits. What was called democracy did not touch the institution of
slavery, which enabled the rich to enjoy their wealth without oppressing
free citizens.</p>
<p>In many cities, however, and especially in Athens, the poorer
citizens had towards the rich a double hostility, that of envy, and that
of traditionalism. The rich were supposed—often with justice—to be
impious and immoral; they were subverting ancient beliefs, and probably
trying to destroy democracy. It thus happened that political democracy
was associated with cultural conservatism, while those who were cultural
innovators tended to be political reactionaries. Somewhat the same
situation exists in modern America, where Tammany, as a mainly Catholic
organization, is engaged in defending traditional theological and
ethical dogmas against the assaults of enlighten-ment. But the
enlightened are politically weaker in America than they were in Athens,
because they have failed to make common cause with the plutocracy. There
is, however, one important and highly intellectual class which is
concerned with the defence of the plutocracy, namely the class of
corporation lawyers. In some respects, their functions are similar to
those that were performed in Athens by the Sophists.</p>
<p>Athenian democracy, though it had the grave limitation of not
including slaves or women, was in some respects more democratic than any
modern system. Judges and most executive officers were chosen by lot,
and served for short periods; they were thus average citizens, like our
jurymen, with the prejudices and lack of professionalism characteristic
of average citizens. In general, there were a large number of judges to
hear each case. The plaintiff and defendant, or prosecutor and accused,
appeared in person, not through professional lawyers. Naturally, success
or failure depended largely on oratorical skill in appealing to popular
prejudices. Although a man had to deliver his own speech, he could hire
an expert to write the speech for him, or, as many preferred, he could
pay for instruction in the arts required for success in the law courts.
These arts the Sophists were supposed to teach.</p>
<p>The age of Pericles is analogous, in Athenian history, to the
Victorian age in the history of England. Athens was rich and powerful,
not much troubled by wars, and possessed of a democratic constitution
administered by aristocrats. As we have seen, in connection with
Anaxagoras, a democratic opposition to Pericles gradually gathered
strength, and attacked his friends one by one. The Peloponnesian War
broke out in 431 B.C.;1 Athens (in common with many other places) was
ravaged by the plague; the population, which had been about 230,000, was
greatly reduced, and never rose again to its former level (Bury, History
of Greece, I, p. 444). Pericles himself, in 430 B.C., was deposed from
the office of general and fined for misappropriation of public money,
but soon reinstated. His two legitimate sons died of the plague, and he
himself died in the following year (429). Pheidias and Anaxagoras were
condemned; Aspasia was prosecuted for impiety and for keeping a
disorderly house, but acquitted.</p>
<p>In such a community, it was natural that men who were likely to incur
the hostility of democratic politicians should wish to acquire forensic
skill. For Athens, though much addicted to persecution, was in one
respect less illiberal than modern America, since those accused of
impiety and corrupting the young were allowed to plead in their own
defence.</p>
<p>This explains the popularity of the Sophists with one class and their
unpopularity with another. But in their own minds they served more
impersonal purposes, and it is clear that many of them were
genuinely</p>
<p>concerned with philosophy. Plato devoted himself to caricaturing and
vilifying them, but they must not be judged by his polemics. In his
lighter vein, take the following passage from the Euthydemus, in which
two Sophists, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, set to work to puzzle a
simple-minded person named Clesippus. Dionysodorus begins:</p>
<p>You say that you have a dog?</p>
<p>Yes, a villain of a one, said Clesippus.</p>
<p>And he has puppies?</p>
<p>Yes, and they are very like himself.</p>
<p>And the dog is the father of them?</p>
<p>Yes, he said, I certainly saw him and the mother of the</p>
<p>puppies come together.</p>
<p>And is he not yours?</p>
<p>To be sure he is.</p>
<p>Then he is a father, and he is yours; ergo, he is your father,</p>
<p>and the puppies are your brothers.</p>
<p>In a more serious vein, take the dialogue called The Sophist. This is
a logical discussion of definition, which uses the sophist as an
illustration. With its logic we are not at present concerned; the only
thing I wish to mention at the moment as regards this dialogue is the
final conclusion:</p>
<p>‘The art of contradiction-making, descended from an insincere kind of
conceited mimicry, of the semblance-making breed, derived from
image-making, distinguished as a portion, not divine but human, of
production, that presents a shadow-play of words—such is the blood and
lineage which can, with perfect truth, be assigned to the authentic
Sophist.’ (Cornford’s translation.)</p>
<p>There is a story about Protagoras, no doubt apocryphal, which
illustrates the connection of the Sophists with the law-courts in the
popular mind. It is said that he taught a young man on the terms that he
should be paid his fee if the young man won his first law-suit, but not
otherwise, and that the young man’s first law-suit was one brought by
Protagoras for recovery of his fee.</p>
<p>However, it is time to leave these preliminaries and see what is
really known about Protagoras.</p>
<p>Protagoras was born about 500 B.C., at Abdera, the city from which
Democritus came. He twice visited Athens, his second visit being not
later than 432 B.C. He made a code of laws for the city of Thurii in
444–3 B.C. There is a tradition that he was prosecuted for impiety, but
this seems to be untrue, in spite of the fact that he wrote a book On
the Gods, which began: ‘With regard to the gods, I cannot feel sure
either that they are or that they are not, nor what they are like in
figure; for there are many things that hinder sure knowledge, the
obscurity of the subject and the shortness of human life.’</p>
<p>His second visit to Athens is described somewhat satirically in
Plato’s Protagoras, and his doctrines are discussed seriously in the
Theaetetus. He is chiefly noted for his doctrine that ‘Man is the
measure of all things, of things that are that they are, and of things
that are not that they are not.’ This is interpreted as meaning that
each man is the measure of all things, and that, when men differ, there
is no objective truth in virtue of which one is right and the other
wrong. The doctrine is essentially sceptical, and is presumably based on
the ‘deceitfulness’ of the senses.</p>
<p>One of the three founders of pragmatism, F. C. S. Schiller, was in
the habit of calling himself a disciple of Protagoras. This was, I
think, because Plato, in the Theaetetus, suggests, as an interpretation
of Protagoras, that one opinion can be better than another, though it
cannot be truer. For example, when a man has jaundice everything looks
yellow. There is no sense in saying that things are really not yellow,
but the colour they look to a man in health; we can say, however, that,
since health is better than sickness, the opinion of the man in health
is better than that of the man who has jaundice. This point of view,
obviously, is akin to pragmatism.</p>
<p>The disbelief in objective truth makes the majority, for practical
purposes, the arbiters as to what to believe. Hence Protagoras was led
to a defence of law and convention and traditional morality. While, as
we saw, he did not know whether the gods existed, he was sure they ought
to be worshipped. This point of view is obviously the right one for a
man whose theoretical scepticism is thoroughgoing and logical.</p>
<p>Protagoras spent his adult life in a sort of perpetual lecture tour
through the cities of Greece, teaching, for a fee, ‘any one who desired
practical efficiency and higher mental culture’ (Zeller, p. 1299). Plato
objects—some-what snobbishly, according to modern notions—to the
Sophists’ practice of charging money for instruction. Plato himself had
adequate private means, and was unable, apparently, to realize the
necessities of those who had not his good fortune. It is odd that modern
professors, who see no reason to refuse a salary, have so frequently
repeated Plato’s strictures.</p>
<p>There was, however, another point in which the Sophists differed from
most contemporary philosophers. It was usual, except among the Sophists,
for a teacher to found a school, which had some of the properties of a
brotherhood; there was a greater or smaller amount of common life, there
was often something analogous to a monastic rule, and there was usually
an esoteric doctrine not proclaimed to the public. All this was natural
wherever philosophy had arisen out of Orphism. Among the Sophists there
was none of this. What they had to teach was not, in their minds,
connected with religion or virtue. They taught the art of arguing, and
as much knowledge as would help in this art. Broadly speaking, they were
prepared, like modern lawyers, to show how to argue for or against any
opinion, and were not concerned to advocate conclusions of their own.
Those to whom philosophy was a way of life, closely bound up with
religion, were naturally shocked; to them, the Sophists appeared
frivolous and immoral.</p>
<p>To some extent—though it is impossible to say how far—the odium which
the Sophists incurred, not only with the general public, but with Plato
and subsequent philosophers, was due to their intellectual merit. The
pursuit of truth, when it is wholehearted, must ignore moral
considerations; we cannot know in advance that the truth will turn out
to be what is thought edifying in a given society. The Sophists were
prepared to follow an argument wherever it might lead them. Often it led
them to scepticism. One of them, Gorgias, maintained that nothing
exists; that if anything exists, it is unknowable; and granting it even
to exist and to be knowable by any one man, he could never communicate
it to others. We do not know what his arguments were, but I can well
imagine that they had a logical force which compelled his opponents to
take refuge in edification. Plato is always concerned to advocate views
that will make people what he thinks virtuous; he is hardly ever
intellectually honest, because he allows himself to judge doctrines by
their social consequences. Even about this, he is not honest; he
pretends to follow the argument and to be judging by purely theoretical
standards, when in fact he is twisting the discussion so as to lead to a
virtuous result. He introduced this vice into philosophy, where it has
persisted ever since. It was probably largely hostility to the Sophists
that gave this character to his dialogues. One of the defects of all
philosophers since Plato is that their inquiries into ethics proceed on
the assumption that they already know the conclusions to be reached.</p>
<p>It seems that there were men, in the Athens of the late fifth
century, who taught political doctrines which seemed immoral to their
contemporaries, and seem so to the democratic nations of the present
day. Thrasymachus, in the first book of the Republic, argues that there
is no justice except the interest of the stronger; that laws are made by
governments for their own advantage; and that there is no impersonal
standard to which to appeal in contests for power. Callicles, according
to Plato (in the Gorgias), maintained a similar doctrine. The law of
nature, he said, is the law of the stronger; but for convenience men
have established institutions and moral precepts to restrain the strong.
Such doctrines have won much wider assent in our day than they did in
antiquity. And whatever may be thought of them, they are not
characteristic of the Sophists.</p>
<p>During the fifth century—whatever part the Sophists may have had in
the change—there was in Athens a transformation from a certain stiff
Puritan simplicity to a quick-witted and rather cruel cynicism in
conflict with a slow-witted and equally cruel defence of crumbling
orthodoxy. At the beginning of the century comes the Athenian
championship of the cities of Ionia against the Persians, and the
victory of Marathon in 490 B.C. At the end comes the defeat of Athens by
Sparta in 404 B.C., and the execution of Socrates in 399 B.C. After this
time Athens ceased to be politically important, but acquired undoubted
cultural supremacy, which it retained until the victory of
Christianity.</p>
<p>Something of the history of fifth-century Athens is essential to the
understanding of Plato and of all subsequent Greek thought. In the first
Persian war, the chief glory went to the Athenians, owing to the
decisive victory at Marathon. In the second war, ten years later, the
Athenians still were the best of the Greeks at sea, but on land victory
was mainly due to the Spartans, who were the acknowledged leaders of the
Hellenic world. The Spartans, however, were narrowly provincial in their
outlook, and ceased to oppose the Persians when they had been chased out
of European Greece. The championship of the Asiatic Greeks, and the
liberation of the islands that had been conquered by the Persians, was
undertaken, with great success, by Athens. Athens became the leading sea
power, and acquired a considerable imperialist control over the Ionian
islands. Under the leadership of Pericles, who was a moderate democrat
and a moderate imperialist, Athens prospered. The great temples, whose
ruins are still the glory of Athens, were built by his initiative, to
replace those destroyed by Xerxes. The city increased very rapidly in
wealth, and also in culture, and, as invariably happens at such times,
particularly when wealth is due to foreign commerce, traditional
morality and traditional beliefs decayed.</p>
<p>There was at this time in Athens an extraordinarily large number of
men of genius. The three great dramatists, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides, all belong to the fifth century. Aeschylus fought at Marathon
and saw the battle of Salamis. Sophocles was still religiously orthodox.
But Euripides was influenced by Protagoras and by the free-thinking
spirit of the time, and his treatment of the myths is sceptical and
subversive. Aristophanes, the comic poet, made fun of Socrates,
Sophists, and philosophers, but, nevertheless, belonged to their circle;
in the Symposium Plato represents him as on very friendly terms with
Socrates. Pheidias the sculptor, as we have seen, belonged to the circle
of Pericles.</p>
<p>The excellence of Athens, at this period, was artistic rather than
intellectual. None of the great mathematicians or philosophers of the
fifth century were Athenians, with the exception of Socrates; and
Socrates was not a writer, but a man who confined himself to oral
discussion.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 B.C. and the death of
Pericles in 429 B.C. introduced a darker period in Athenian history. The
Athenians were superior at sea, but the Spartans had supremacy on land,
and repeatedly occupied Attica (except Athens) during the summer. The
result was that Athens was over-crowded, and suffered severely from the
plague. In 414 B.C. the Athenians sent a large expedition to Sicily, in
the hope of capturing Syracuse, which was allied with Sparta; but the
attempt was a failure. War made the Athenians fierce and persecuting. In
416 B.C. they conquered the island of Melos, put to death all men of
military age and enslaved the other inhabitants. The Trojan Women of
Euripides is a protest against such barbarism. The conflict had an
ideological aspect, since Sparta was the champion of oligarchy and
Athens of democracy. The Athenians had reason to suspect some of their
own aristocrats of treachery, which was generally thought to have had a
part in the final naval defeat at the battle of Aegospotami in 405
B.C.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, the Spartans established in Athens an
oligarchical government, known as the Thirty Tyrants. Some of the
Thirty, including Critias, their chief, had been pupils of Socrates.
They were deservedly unpopular, and were overthrown within a year. With
the compliance of Sparta, democracy was restored, but it was an
embittered democracy, precluded by an amnesty from direct vengeance
against its internal enemies, but glad of any pretext, not covered by
the amnesty, for prosecuting them. It was in this atmosphere that the
trial and death of Socrates took place (399 B.C.).</p>
