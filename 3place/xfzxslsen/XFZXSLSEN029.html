<h4 id="cynics-and-sceptics">26 CYNICS AND SCEPTICS</h4>
<p>The relation of intellectually eminent men to contemporary society
has been very different in different ages. In some fortunate epochs they
have been on the whole in harmony with their surroundings—suggesting, no
doubt, such reforms as seemed to them necessary, but fairly confident
that their suggestions would be welcomed, and not disliking the world in
which they found themselves even if it remained unreformed. At other
times they have been revolutionary, considering that radical alterations
were called for, but expecting that, partly as a result of their
advocacy, these alterations would be brought about in the near future.
At yet other times they have despaired of the world, and felt that,
though they themselves knew what was needed, there was no hope of its
being brought about. This mood sinks easily into the deeper despair
which regards life on earth as essentially bad, and hopes for good only
in a future life or in some mystical transfiguration.</p>
<p>In some ages, all these attitudes have been adopted by different men
living at the same time. Consider, for example, the early nineteenth
century. Goethe is comfortable, Bentham is a reformer, Shelley is a
revolutionary, and Leopardi is a pessimist. But in most periods there
has been a prevailing tone among great writers. In England they were
comfortable under Elizabeth and in the eighteenth century; in France,
they became revolutionary about 1750; in Germany, they have been
nationalistic since 1813.</p>
<p>During the period of ecclesiastical domination, from the fifth
century to the fifteenth, there was a certain conflict between what was
theoretically believed and, what was actually felt. Theoretically, the
world was a vale of tears, a preparation, amid tribulation, for the
world to come. But in practice the writers of books, being almost all
clerics, could not help feeling exhilarated by the power of the Church;
they found opportunity for abundant vactivity of a sort that they
believed to be useful. They had therefore the mentality of a governing
class, not of men who feel themselves exiles in an alien world. This is
part of the curious dualism that runs through the Middle Ages, owing to
the fact that the Church, though based on other-worldly beliefs, was the
most important institution in the every-day world.</p>
<p>The psychological preparation for the other-worldliness of
Christianity begins in the Hellenistic period, and is connected with the
eclipse of the City State. Down to Aristotle, Greek philosophers, though
they might complain of this or that, were, in the main, not cosmically
despairing, nor did they feel themselves politically impotent. They
might, at times, belong to a beaten party, but, if so, their defeat was
due to the chances of conflict, not to any inevitable powerlessness of
the wise. Even those who, like Pythagoras, and Plato in certain moods,
condemned the world of appearance and sought escape in mysticism, had
practical plans for turning the governing classes into saints and sages.
When political power passed into the hands of the Macedonians, Greek
philosophers, as was natural, turned aside from politics and devoted
themselves more to the problem of individual virtue or salvation. They
no longer asked: how can men create a good State? They asked instead:
how can men be virtuous in a wicked world, or happy in a world of
suffering? The change, it is true, is only one of degree; such questions
had been asked before, and the later Stoics, for a time, again concerned
themselves with politics—the politics of Rome, not of Greece. But the
change was none the less real. Except to a limited extent during the
Roman period in Stoicism, the outlook of those who thought and felt
seriously became increasingly subjective and individualistic, until, at
last, Christianity evolved a gospel of individual salvation which
inspired missionary zeal and created the Church. Until that happened,
there was no institution to which the philosopher could give
whole-hearted adherence, and therefore there was no adequate outlet for
his legitimate love of power. For this reason, the philosophers of the
Hellenistic period are more limited as human beings than the men who
lived while the City State could still inspire allegiance. They still
think, because they cannot help thinking; but they scarcely hope that
their thought will bear fruit in the world of affairs.</p>
<p>Four schools of philosophy were founded about the time of Alexander.
The two most famous, the Stoics and Epicureans, will be the subjects of
later chapters; in the present chapter we shall be concerned with the
Cynics and Sceptics.</p>
<p>The first of these schools is derived, through its founder Diogenes,
from Antisthenes, a disciple of Socrates, about twenty years older than
Plato. Antisthenes was a remarkable character, in some ways rather like
Tolstoy. Until after the death of Socrates, he lived in the aristocratic
circle of his fellow disciples, and showed no sign of unorthodoxy. But
something—whether the defeat of Athens, or the death of Socrates, or a
distaste for philosophic quibbling—caused him, when no longer young, to
despise the things that he had formerly valued. He would have nothing
but simple goodness. He associated with working men, and dressed as one
of them. He took to open-air preaching, in a style that the uneducated
could understand. All refined philosophy he held to be worthless; what
could be known, could be known by the plain man. He believed in the
‘return to nature’, and carried this belief very far. There was to be no
government, no private property, no marriage, no established religion.
His followers, if not he himself, condemned slavery. He was not exactly
ascetic, but he despised luxury and all pursuit of artificial pleasures
of the senses. ‘I had rather be mad than delighted’, he said.1</p>
<p>The fame of Antisthenes was surpassed by that of his disciple
Diogenes, ’a young man from Sinope, on the Euxine, whom he [Antisthenes]
did not take to at first sight; the son of a disreputable money-changer
who had been sent to prison for defacing the coinage. Antisthenes
ordered the lad away, but he paid no attention; he beat him with his
stick, but he never moved. He wanted “wisdom“, and saw that Antisthenes
had it to give. His aim in life was to do as his father had done, to
“deface the coinage“, but on a much larger scale. He would deface all
the coinage current in the world. Every conventional stamp was false.
The men stamped as generals and kings; the things stamped as honour and
wisdom and happiness and riches; all were base metal with lying
superscription.’2</p>
<p>He decided to live like a dog, and was therefore called a ‘cynic’,
which means ‘canine’. He rejected all conventions—whether of religion,
of manners, of dress, of housing, of food, or of decency. One is told
that he lived in a tub, but Gilbert Murray assures us that this is a
mistake: it was a large pitcher, of the sort used in primitive times for
burials.3 He lived, like an Indian fakir, by begging. He proclaimed his
brotherhood, not only with the whole human race, but also with animals.
He was a man about whom stories gathered, even in his lifetime. Everyone
knows how Alexander visited him, and asked if he desired any favour;
‘only to stand out of my light,’ he replied.</p>
<p>The teaching of Diogenes was by no means what we now call
‘cynical’—quite the contrary. He had an ardent passion for ‘virtue’, in
comparison with which he held worldly goods of no account. He sought
virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire: be indifferent to
the goods that fortune has to bestow, and you will be emancipated from
fear. In this respect, his doctrine, as we shall see, was taken up by
the Stoics, but they did not follow him in rejecting the amenities of
civilization. He considered that Prometheus</p>
<p>was justly punished for bringing to man the arts that have produced
the complication and artificiality of modern life. In this he resembled
the Taoists and Rousseau and Tolstoy, but was more consistent than they
were.</p>
<p>His doctrine, though he was a contemporary of Aristotle, belongs in
its temper to the Hellenistic age. Aristotle is the last Greek
philosopher who faces the world cheerfully; after him, all have, in one
form or another, a philosophy of retreat. The world is bad; let us learn
to be independent of it. External goods are precarious; they are the
gift of fortune, not the reward of our own efforts. Only subjective
goods—virtue, or contentment through resignation—are secure, and these
alone, therefore, will be valued by the wise man. Diogenes personally
was a man full of vigour, but his doctrine, like all those of the
Hellenistic age, was one to appeal to weary men, in whom disappointment
had destroyed natural zest. And it was certainly not a doctrine
calculated to promote art or science or statesmanship, or any useful
activity except one of protest against powerful evil.</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe what the Cynic teaching became when it
was popularized. In the early part of the third century B.C., the cynics
were the fashion, especially in Alexandria. They published little
sermons pointing out how easy it is to do without material possessions,
how happy one can be on simple food, how warm one can keep in winter
without expensive clothes (which might be true in Egypt!), how silly it
is to feel affection for one’s native country, or to mourn when one’s
children or friends die. ‘Because my son or wife is dead,’ says Teles,
who was one of these popularizing Cynics, ‘is that any reason for my
neglecting myself, who am still alive, and ceasing to look after my
property.’4 At this point, it becomes difficult to feel any sympathy
with the simple life, which has grown altogether too simple. One wonders
who enjoyed these sermons. Was it the rich, who wished to think the
sufferings of the poor imaginary? Or was it the new poor, who were
trying to despise the successful business man? Or was it sycophants who
persuaded themselves that the charity they accepted was unimportant?
Teles says to a rich man: ’You give liberally and I take valiantly from
you, neither grovelling nor demeaning myself basely nor grumbling.’5 A
very convenient doctrine. Popular Cynicism did not teach abstinence from
the good things of this world, but only a certain indifference to them.
In the case of a borrower, this might take the form of minimizing the
obligation to the lender. One can see how the word ’cynic’ acquired its
everyday meaning.</p>
<p>What was best in the Cynic doctrine passed over into Stoicism, which
was an altogether more complete and rounded philosophy.</p>
<p>Scepticism, as a doctrine of the schools, was first proclaimed by
Pyrrho, who was in Alexander’s army, and campaigned with it as far as
India. It seems that this gave him a sufficient taste of travel, and
that he spent the rest of his life in his native city, Elis, where he
died in 275 B.C. There was not much that was new in his doctrine, beyond
a certain systematizing and formalizing of older doubts. Scepticism with
regard to the senses had troubled Greek philosophers from a very early
stage; the only exceptions were those who, like Parmenides and Plato,
denied the cognitive value of perception, and made their denial into an
opportunity for an intellectual dogmatism. The Sophists, notably
Protagoras and Gorgias, had been led by the ambiguities and apparent
contradictions of sense-perception to a subjectivism not unlike Hume’s.
Pyrrho seems (for he very wisely wrote no books) to have added moral and
logical scepticism to scepticism as to the senses. He is said to have
maintained that there could never be any rational ground for preferring
one course of action to another. In practice, this meant that one
conformed to the customs of whatever country one inhabited. A modern
disciple would go to church on Sundays and perform the correct
genuflexions, but without any of the religious beliefs that are supposed
to inspire these actions. Ancient Sceptics went through the whole pagan
ritual, and were even sometimes priests; their Scepticism assured them
that this behaviour could not be proved wrong, and their common sense
(which survived their philosophy) assured them that it was
convenient.</p>
<p>Scepticism naturally made an appeal to many unphilosophic minds.
People observed the diversity of schools and the acerbity of their
disputes, and decided that all alike were pretending to knowledge which
was in fact unattainable. Scepticism was a lazy man’s consolation, since
it showed the ignorant to be as wise as the reputed men of learning. To
men who, by temperament, required a gospel, it might seem unsatisfying,
but like every doctrine of the Hellenistic period it recommended itself
as an antidote to worry. Why trouble about the future? It is wholly
uncertain. You may as well enjoy the present; ‘what’s to come is still
unsure.’ For these reasons, Scepticism enjoyed a considerable popular
success.</p>
<p>It should be observed that Scepticism as a philosophy is not merely
doubt, but what may be called dogmatic doubt. The man of science says ‘l
think it is so-and-so, but I am not sure.’ The man of intellectual
curiosity says ‘I don’t know how it is, but I hope to find out.’ The
philosophical Sceptic says ‘nobody knows, and nobody ever can know.’ It
is this element of dogmatism that makes the system vulnerable. Sceptics,
of course, deny that they assert the impossibility of knowledge
dogmatically, but their denials are not very convincing.</p>
<p>Pyrrho’s disciple Timon, however, advanced some intellectual
arguments which, from the standpoint of Greek logic, were very hard to
answer. The only logic admitted by the Greeks was deductive, and all
deduction had to start, like Euclid, from general principles regarded as
self-evident. Timon denied the possibility of finding such principles.
Everything, therefore, will have to be proved by means of something
else, and all argument will be either circular or an endless chain
hanging from nothing. In either case nothing can be proved. This
argument, as we can see, cut at the root of the Aristotelian philosophy
which dominated the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Some forms of Scepticism which, in our own day, are advocated by men
who are by no means wholly sceptical, had not occurred to the Sceptics
of antiquity. They did not doubt phenomena, or question propositions
which, in their opinion, only expressed what we know directly concerning
phenomena. Most of Timon’s work is lost, but two surviving fragments
will illustrate this point. One says ‘The phenomenon is always valid.’
The other says: ‘That honey is sweet 1 refuse to assert; that it appears
sweet, I fully grant.’6 A modern Sceptic would point out that the
phenomenon merely occurs, and is not either valid or invalid; what is
valid or invalid must be a statement, and no statement can be so closely
linked to the phenomenon as to be incapable of falsehood. For the same
reason, he would say that the statement ’honey appears sweet’ is only
highly probable, not absolutely certain.</p>
<p>In some respects, the doctrine of Timon was very similar to that of
Hume. He maintained that something which had never been observed—atoms,
for instance—could not be validly inferred; but when two phenomena had
been frequently observed together, one could be inferred from the
other.</p>
<p>Timon lived at Athens throughout the later years of his long life,
and died there in 235 B.C. With his death, the school of Pyrrho, as a
school, came to an end but his doctrines, somewhat modified, were taken
up, strange as it may seem, by the Academy, which represented the
Platonic tradition.</p>
<p>The man who effected this surprising philosophic revolution was
Arcesilaus, a contemporary of Timon, who died as an old man about 240
B.C. What most men have taken from Plato is belief in a supersensible
intellectual world and in the superiority of the immortal soul to the
mortal body. But Plato was many-sided, and in some respects could be
regarded as teaching scepticism. The Platonic Socrates professes to know
nothing; we naturally treat this as irony, but it could be taken
seriously. Many of the dialogues reach no positive conclusion, and aim
at leaving the reader in a state of doubt. Some—the latter half of the
Parmenides, for instance—might seem to have no purpose except to show
that either side of any question can be maintained with equal
plausibility. The Platonic dialectic could be treated as an end, rather
than a means, and if so treated it lent itself admirably to the advocacy
of Scepticism. This seems to have been the way in which Arcesilaus
interpreted the man whom he still</p>
<p>professed to follow. He had decapitated Plato, but at any rate the
torso that remained was genuine.</p>
<p>The manner in which Arcesilaus taught would have had much to commend
it, if the young men who learnt from him had been able to avoid being
paralysed by it. He maintained no thesis, but would refute any thesis
set up by a pupil. Sometimes he would himself advance two contradictory
propositions on successive occasions, showing how to argue convincingly
in favour of either. A pupil sufficiently vigorous to rebel might have
learnt dexterity and the avoidance of fallacies; in fact, none seem to
have learnt anything except cleverness and indifference to truth. So
great was the influence of Arcesilaus that the Academy remained
sceptical for about two hundred years.</p>
<p>In the middle of this sceptical period, an amusing incident occurred.
Carneades, a worthy successor of Arcesilaus as head of the Academy, was
one of three philosophers sent by Athens on a diplomatic mission to Rome
in the year 156 B.C. He saw no reason why his ambassadorial dignity
should interfere with the main chance, so he announced a course of
lectures in Rome. The young men, who, at that time, were anxious to ape
Greek manners and acquire Greek culture, flocked to hear him. His first
lecture expounded the views of Aristotle and Plato on justice, and was
thoroughly edifying. His second, however, was concerned in refuting all
that he had said in his first, not with a view to establishing opposite
conclusions, but merely to show that every conclusion is unwarranted.
Plato’s Socrates had argued that to inflict injustice was a greater evil
to the perpetrator than to suffer it. Carneades, in his second lecture,
treated this contention with scorn. Great States, he pointed out, had
become great by unjust aggressions against their weaker neighbours; in
Rome, this could not well be denied. In a shipwreck, you may save your
life at the expense of some one weaker, and you are a fool if you do
not. ‘Women and children first’, he seems to think, is not a maxim that
leads to personal survival. What would you do if you were flying from a
victorious enemy, you had lost your horse, but you found a wounded
comrade on a horse? If you were sensible, you would drag him off and
seize his horse, whatever justice might ordain. All this not very
edifying argumentation is surprising in a nominal follower of Plato, but
it seems to have pleased the modern-minded Roman youths.</p>
<p>There was one man whom it did not please, and that was the elder
Cato, who represented the stern, stiff, stupid, and brutal moral code by
means of which Rome had defeated Carthage. From youth to old age, he
lived simply, rose early, practised severe manual labour, ate only
coarse food, and never wore a gown that cost over a hundred pence.
Towards the State he was scrupulously honest, avoiding all bribery and
plunder. He exacted of other Romans all the virtues that he practised
himself, and asserted that to accuse and pursue the wicked was the best
thing an honest man could do. He enforced, as far as he could, the old
Roman severity of manners:</p>
<p>’Cato put out of the Senate also, one Manilius, who was in great
towardness to have been made Consul the next year following, only
because he kissed his wife too lovingly in the day time, and before his
daughter: and reproving him for it, he told him, his wife never kissed
him, but when it thundered.’7</p>
<p>When he was in power, he put down luxury and feasting. He made his
wife suckle not only her own children, but also those of his slaves, in
order that, having been nourished by the same milk, they might love his
children. When his slaves were too old to work, he sold them
remorselessly. He insisted that his slaves should always be either
working or sleeping. He encouraged his slaves to quarrel with each
other, for ‘he could not abide that they should be friends’. When a
slave had committed a grave fault, he would call in his other slaves,
and induce them to condemn the delinquent to death; he would then carry
out the sentence with his own hands in the presence of the
survivors.</p>
<p>The contrast between Cato and Carneades was very complete: the one
brutal through a morality that was too strict and too traditional, the
other ignoble through a morality that was too lax and too much infected
with the social dissolution of the Hellenistic world.</p>
<p>’Marcus Cato, even from the beginning that young men began to study
the Greek tongue, and that it grew in estimation in Rome, did dislike of
it: fearing lest the youth of Rome that were desirous of learning and
eloquence, would utterly give over the honour and glory of arms…. So he
openly found fault one day in the Senate, that the Ambassadors were long
there, and had no dispatch: considering also they were cunning men, and
could easily persuade what they would. And if there were no other
respect, this only might persuade them to determine some answers for
them, and to send them home again to their schools, to teach their
children of Greece, and to let alone the children of Rome, that they
might learn to obey the laws and the Senate, as they had done before.
Now he spake thus to the Senate, not of any private ill will or malice
he bare to Carneades, as some men thought: but because he generally
hated philosophy.’8</p>
<p>The Athenians, in Cato’s view, were a lesser breed without the law;
it did not matter if they were degraded by the shallow sophistries of
intellectuals, but the Roman youth must be kept puritanical,
imperialistic, ruthless, and stupid. He failed, however; later Romans,
while retaining many of his vices, adopted those of Carneades also.</p>
<p>The next head of the Academy, after Carneades (ca. 180 to ca. 110
B.C.), was a Carthaginian whose real name was Hasdrubal, but who, in his
dealings with Greeks, preferred to call himself Clitomachus. Unlike
Carneades, who confined himself to lecturing, Clitomachus wrote over
four hundred books, some of them in the Phoenician language. His
principles appear to have been the same as those of Carneades. In some
respects, they were useful. These two Sceptics set themselves against
the belief in divination, magic, and astrology, which was becoming more
and more widespread. They also developed a constructive doctrine,
concerning degrees of probability: although we can never be justified in
feeling certainty, some things are more likely to be true than others.
Probability should be our guide in practice, since it is reasonable to
act on the most probable of possible hypotheses. This view is one with
which most modern philosophers would agree. Unfortunately, the books
setting it forth are lost, and it is difficult to reconstruct the
doctrine from the hints that remain.</p>
<p>After Clitomachus, the Academy ceased to be sceptical, and from the
time of Antiochus (who died in 69 B.C.) its doctrines became, for
centuries, practically indistinguishable from those of the Stoics.</p>
<p>Scepticism, however, did not disappear. It was revived by the Cretan
Aenesidemus, who came from Knossos, where, for aught we know, there may
have been Sceptics two thousand years earlier, entertaining dissolute
courtiers with doubts as to the divinity of the mistress of animals. The
date of Aenesidemus is uncertain. He threw over the doctrines on
probability advocated by Carneades, and reverted to the earliest forms
of Scepticism. His influence was considerable; he was followed by the
satirist Lucian in the second century A.D., and also, slightly later, by
Sextus Empiricus, the only Sceptic philosopher of antiquity whose works
survive. There is, for example, a short treatise, ‘Arguments Against
Belief in a God’, translated by Edwyn Bevan in his Later Greek Religion,
pp. 52–56, and said by him to be probably taken by Sextus Empiricus from
Carneades, as reported by Clitomachus.</p>
<p>This treatise begins by explaining that, in behaviour, the Sceptics
are orthodox: ‘We sceptics follow in practice the way of the world, but
without holding any opinion about it. We speak of the Gods as existing
and offer worship to the Gods and say that they exercise providence, but
in saying this we express no belief, and avoid the rashness of the
dogmatizers.’</p>
<p>He then argues that people differ as to the nature of God; for
instance, some think Him corporeal, some incorporeal. Since we have no
experience of Him, we cannot know His attributes. The existence of God
is not self-evident, and therefore needs proof. There is a somewhat
confused argument to show that no such proof is possible. He next takes
up the problem of evil, and concludes with the words:</p>
<p>‘Those who affirm positively that God exists cannot avoid falling
into an impiety. For if they say that God controls everything, they make
Him the author of evil things; if, on the other hand, they say that He
controls some things only, or that He controls nothing, they are
compelled to make God either grudging or impotent, and to do that is
quite obviously an impiety.’</p>
<p>Scepticism, while it continued to appeal to some cultivated
individuals until somewhere in the third century A.D., was contrary to
the temper of the age, which was turning more and more to dogmatic
religion and doctrines of salvation. Scepticism had enough force to make
educated men dissatisfied with the State religions, but it had nothing
positive, even in the purely intellectual sphere, to offer in their
place. From the Renaissance onwards, theological scepticism has been
supplemented, in most of its advocates, by an enthusiastic belief in
science, but in antiquity there was no such supplement to doubt. Without
answering the arguments of the Sceptics, the ancient world turned aside
from them. The Olympians being discredited, the way was left clear for
an invasion of oriental religions, which competed for the favour of the
superstitious until the triumph of Christianity.</p>
