<h4 id="currents-of-thought-in-the-nineteenth-century">21 CURRENTS OF
THOUGHT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</h4>
<p>The intellectual life of the nineteenth century was more complex than
that of any previous age. This was due to several causes. First: the
area concerned was larger than ever before; America and Russia made
important contributions, and Europe became more aware than formerly of
Indian philosophies, both ancient and modern. Second: science, which had
been a chief source of novelty since the seventeenth century, made new
conquests, especially in geology, biology, and organic chemistry. Third:
machine production profoundly altered the social structure, and gave men
a new conception of their powers in relation to the physical
environment. Fourth: a profound revolt, both philosophical and
political, against traditional systems in thought, in politics, and in
economics, gave rise to attacks upon many beliefs and institutions that
had hitherto been regarded as unassailable. This revolt had two very
different forms, one romantic, the other rationalistic. (I am using
these words in a liberal sense.) The romantic revolt passes from Byron,
Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche to Mussolini and Hitler; the rationalistic
revolt begins with the French philosophers of the Revolution, passes on,
somewhat softened, to the philosophical radicals in England, then
acquires a deeper form in Marx and issues in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>The intellectual predominance of Germany is a new factor, beginning
with Kant. Leibniz, though a German, wrote almost always in Latin or
French, and was very little influenced by Germany in his philosophy.
German idealism after Kant, as well as later German philosophy, was, on
the contrary, profoundly influenced by German history; much of what
seems strange in German philosophical speculation reflects the state of
mind of a vigorous nation deprived, by historical accidents, of its
natural share of power. Germany had owed its international position to
the Holy Roman Empire, but the Emperor had gradually lost control of his
nominal subjects. The last powerful Emperor was Charles V, and he owed
his power to his possessions in Spain and the Low Countries. The
Reformation and the Thirty Years’ War destroyed what had been left of
German unity, leaving a number of petty principalities which were at the
mercy of France. In the eighteenth century only one German state,
Prussia, had successfully resisted the French; that is why Frederick was
called the Great. But Prussia itself had failed to stand against
Napoleon, being utterly defeated in the battle of Jena. The resurrection
of Prussia under Bismarck appeared as a revival of the heroic past of
Alaric, Charlemagne, and Barbarossa. (To Germans, Charlemagne is a
German, not a Frenchman). Bismarck showed his sense of history when he
said, ‘We will not go to Canossa.’</p>
<p>Prussia, however, though politically predominant, was culturally less
advanced than much of Western Germany; this explains why many eminent
Germans, including Goethe, did not regret Napoleon’s success at Jena.
Germany, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, presented an
extraordinary cultural and economic diversity. In East Prussia serfdom
still survived; the rural aristocracy were largely immersed in bucolic
ignorance, and the labourers were completely without even the rudiments
of education. Western Germany, on the other hand, had been in part
subject to Rome in antiquity; it had been under French influence since
the seventeenth century; it had been occupied by French revolutionary
armies, and had acquired institutions as liberal as those of France.
Some of the princes were intelligent, patrons of the arts and sciences,
imitating Renaissance princes in their courts; the most notable example
was Weimar, where the Grand Duke was Goethe’s patron. The princes were,
naturally, for the most part opposed to German unity, since it would
destroy their independence. They were therefore anti-patriotic, and so
were many of the eminent men who depended on them, to whom Napoleon
appeared the missionary of a higher culture than that of Germany.</p>
<p>Gradually, during the nineteenth century, the culture of Protestant
Germany became increasingly Prussian. Frederick the Great, as a
free-thinker and an admirer of French philosophy, had struggled to make
Berlin a cultural centre; the Berlin Academy had as its perpetual
President an eminent Frenchman, Maupertuis, who, however, unfortunately
became the victim of Voltaire’s deadly ridicule. Frederick’s endeavours,
like those of the other enlightened despots of the time, did not include
economic or political reform; all that was really achieved was a claque
of hired intellectuals. After his death, it was again in Western Germany
that most of the men of culture were to be found.</p>
<p>German philosophy was more connected with Prussia than were German
literature and art. Kant was a subject of Frederick the Great; Fichte
and Hegel were professors at Berlin. Kant was little influenced by
Prussia; indeed he got into trouble with the Prussian Government for his
liberal theology. But both Fichte and Hegel were philosophic mouthpieces
of Prussia, and did much to prepare the way for the later identification
of German patriotism with admiration for Prussia. Their work in this
respect was carried on by the great German historians, particularly by
Mommsen and Treitschke. Bismarck finally persuaded the German nation to
accept unification under Prussia, and thus gave the victory to the less
internationally minded elements in German culture.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole period after the death of Hegel, most academic
philosophy remained traditional, and therefore not very important.
British empiricist philosophy was dominant in England until near the end
of the century, and in France until a somewhat earlier time; then,
gradually, Kant and Hegel conquered the universities of France and
England, so far as their teachers of technical philosophy were
concerned. The general educated public, however, was very little
affected by this movement, which had few adherents among men of science.
The writers who carried on the academic tradition—John Stuart Mill on
the empiricist side, Lotze, Sigwart, Bradley, and Bosanquet on the side
of German idealism—were none of them quite in the front rank among
philosophers, that is to say, they were not the equals of the men whose
systems they, on the whole, adopted. Academic philosophy has often
before been out of touch with the most vigorous thought of the age, for
instance, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when it was still
mainly scholastic. Whenever this happens, the historian of philosophy is
less concerned with the professors than with the unprofessional
heretics.</p>
<p>Most of the philosophers of the French Revolution combined science
with beliefs associated with Rousseau. Helvetius and Condorcet may be
regarded as typical in their combination of rationalism and
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Helvetius (1715–71) had the honour of having his book De l’Esprit
(1758) condemned by the Sorbonne and burnt by the hangman. Bentham read
him in 1769 and immediately determined to devote his life to the
principles of legislation, saying: ‘What Bacon was to the physical
world, Helvetius was to the moral. The moral world has therefore had its
Bacon, but its Newton is still to come.’ James Mill took Helvetius as
his guide in the education of his son John Stuart.</p>
<p>Following Locke’s doctrine that the mind is a tabula rasa, Helvetius
considered the differences between individuals entirely due to
differences of education: in every individual, his talents and his
virtues are the effect of his instruction. Genius, he maintains, is
often due to chance: if Shakespeare had not been caught poaching, he
would have been a wool merchant. His interest in legislation comes from
the doctrine that the principal instructors of adolescence are the forms
of government and the consequent manners and customs. Men are born
ignorant, not stupid; they are made stupid by education.</p>
<p>In ethics, Helvetius was a utilitarian; he considered pleasure to be
the good. In religion, he was a deist, and vehemently anticlerical. In
theory of knowledge, he adopted a simplified version of Locke:
‘Enlightened by Locke, we know that it is to the sense-organs we owe our
ideas, and consequently our mind.’ Physical sensibility, he says, is the
sole cause of our actions, our thoughts, our passions, and our
sociability. He strongly disagrees with Rousseau as to the value of
knowledge, which he rates very highly.</p>
<p>His doctrine is optimistic, since only a perfect education is needed
to make men perfect. There is a suggestion that it would be easy to find
a perfect education if the priests were got out of the way.</p>
<p>Condorcet (1743–94) has opinions similar to those of Helvetius, but
more influenced by Rousseau. The rights of man, he says, are all deduced
from this one truth, that he is a sensitive being, capable of making
reasonings and acquiring moral ideas, from which it follows that men can
no longer be divided into rulers and subjects, liars and dupes. ‘These
principles, for which the generous Sidney gave his life and to which
Locke attached the authority of his name, were afterwards developed more
precisely by Rousseau.’ Locke, he says, first showed the limits of human
knowledge. His ‘method soon became that of all philosophers, and it is
by applying it to morals, politics, and economics, that they have
succeeded in pursuing in these sciences a road almost as sure as that of
the natural sciences.’</p>
<p>Condorcet much admires the American Revolution. ‘Simple common sense
taught the inhabitants of the British Colonies that Englishmen born on
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean had precisely the same rights as
those born on the meridian of Greenwich.’ The United States
Constitution, he says, is based on natural rights, and the American
Revolution made the rights of man known to all Europe, from the Neva to
the Guadalquivir. The principles of the French Revolution, however, are
‘purer, more precise, deeper than those that guided the Americans’.
These words were written while he was in hiding from Robespierre;
shortly afterwards, he was caught and imprisoned. He died in prison, but
the manner of his death is uncertain.</p>
<p>He was a believer in the equality of women. He was also the inventor
of Malthus’s theory of population, which, however, had not for him the
gloomy consequences that it had for Malthus, because he coupled it with
the necessity of birth control. Malthus’s father was a disciple of
Condorcet, and it was in this way that Malthus came to know of the
theory.</p>
<p>Condorcet is even more enthusiastic and optimistic than Helvetius. He
believes that, through the spread of the principles of the French
Revolution, all the major social ills will soon disappear. Perhaps he
was fortunate in not living beyond 1794.</p>
<p>The doctrines of the French revolutionary philosophers, made less
enthusiastic and much more precise, were brought to England by the
philosophical radicals, of whom Bentham was the recognized chief.
Bentham was, at first, almost exclusively interested in law; gradually,
as he grew older, his interests widened and his opinions became more
subversive. After 1808, he was a republican, a believer in the equality
of women, an enemy of imperialism, and an uncompromising democrat. Some
of these opinions he owed to James Mill. Both believed in the
omnipotence of education. Bentham’s adoption of the principle of ‘the
greatest happiness of the greatest number’ was no doubt due to
democratic feeling, but it involved opposition to the doctrine of the
rights of man, which he bluntly characterized as ‘nonsense’.</p>
<p>The philosophical radicals differed from men like Helvetius and
Condorcet in many ways. Temperamentally, they were patient and fond of
working out their theories in practical detail. They attached great
importance to economics, which they believed themselves to have
developed as a science. Tendencies to enthusiasm which existed in
Bentham and John Stuart Mill, but not in Malthus or James Mill, were
severely held in check by this ‘science’, and particularly by Malthus’s
gloomy version of the theory of population, according to which most
wage-earners must always, except just after a pestilence, earn the
smallest amount that will keep them and their families alive. Another
great difference between the Benthamites and their French predecessors
was that in industrial England there was violent conflict between
employers and wage-earners, which gave rise to trade-unionism and
socialism. In this conflict the Benthamites, broadly speaking, sided
with the emloyers against the working class. Their last representative,
John Stuart Mill, however, gradually ceased to give adherence to his
father’s stern tenets, and became, as he grew older, less and less
hostile to socialism, and less and less convinced of the eternal truth
of classical economics. According to his autobiography, this softening
process was begun by the reading of the romantic poets.</p>
<p>The Benthamites, though at first revolutionary in a rather mild way,
gradually ceased to be so, partly through success in converting the
British government to some of their views, partly through opposition to
the growing strength of socialism and trade-unionism. Men who were in
revolt against tradition, as already mentioned, were of two kinds,
rationalistic and romantic, though in men like Condorcet both elements
were combined. The Benthamites were almost wholly rationalistic, and so
were the Socialists who rebelled against them as well as against the
existing economic order. This movement does not acquire a complete
philosophy until we come to Marx, who will be considered in a later
chapter.</p>
<p>The romantic form of revolt is very different from the rationalist
form, though both are derived from the French Revolution and the
philosophers who immediately preceded it. The romantic form is to be
seen in Byron in an unphilosophical dress, but in Schopenhauer and
Nietzsche it has learnt the language of philosophy. It tends to
emphasize the will at the expense of the intellect, to be impatient of
chains of reasoning, and to glorify violence of certain kinds. In
practical politics it is important as an ally of nationalism. In
tendency, if not always in fact, it is definitely hostile to what is
commonly called reason, and tends to be anti-scientific. Some of its
most extreme forms are to be found among Russian anarchists, but in
Russia it was the rationalist form of revolt that finally prevailed. It
was Germany, always more susceptible to romanticism than any other
country, that provided a governmental outlet for the anti-rational
philosophy of naked will.</p>
<p>So far, the philosophies that we have been considering have had an
inspiration which was traditional, literary, or political. But there
were two other sources of philosophical opinion, namely science and
machine production. The second of these began its theoretical influence
with Marx, and has grown gradually more important ever since. The first
has been important since the seventeenth century, but took new forms
during the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>What Galileo and Newton were to the seventeenth century, Darwin was
to the nineteenth. Darwin’s theory had two parts. On the one hand, there
was the doctrine of evolution, which maintained that the different forms
of life had developed gradually from a common ancestry. This doctrine,
which is now generally accepted, was not new. It had been maintained by
Lamarck and by Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus, not to mention Anaximander.
Darwin supplied an immense mass of evidence for the doctrine, and in the
second part of his theory believed himself to have discovered the cause
of evolution. He thus gave to the doctrine a popularity and a scientific
force which it had not previously possessed, but he by no means
originated it.</p>
<p>The second part of Darwin’s theory was the struggle for existence and
the survival of the fittest. All animals and plants multiply faster than
nature can provide for them; therefore in each generation many perish
before the age for reproducing themselves. What determines which will
survive? To some extent, no doubt, sheer luck, but there is another
cause of more importance. Animals and plants are, as a rule, not exactly
like their parents, but differ slightly by excess or defect in every
measurable characteristic. In a given environment, members of the same
species compete for survival, and those best adapted to the environment
have the best chance. Therefore among chance variations those that are
favourable will preponderate among adults in each generation. Thus from
age to age deer run more swiftly, cats stalk their prey more silently,
and giraffes’ necks become longer. Given enough time, this mechanism, so
Darwin contended, could account for the whole long development from the
protozoa to homo sapiens.</p>
<p>This part of Darwin’s theory has been much disputed, and is regarded
by most biologists as subject to many important qualifications. That,
however, is not what most concerns the historian of nineteenth-century
ideas. From the historical point of view, what is interesting is
Darwin’s extension to the whole of life of the economics that
characterized the philosophical radicals. The motive force of evolution,
according to him, is a kind of biological economics in a world of free
competition. It was Malthus’s doctrine of population, extended to the
world of animals and plants, that suggested to Darwin the struggle for
existence and the survival of the fittest as the source of
evolution.</p>
<p>Darwin himself was a liberal, but his theories had consequences in
some degree inimical to traditional liberalism. The doctrine that all
men are born equal, and that the differences between adults are due
wholly to education, was incompatible with his emphasis on congenital
differences between members of the same species. If, as Lamarck held,
and as Darwin himself was willing to concede up to a point, acquired
characteristics were inherited, this opposition to such views as those
of Helvetius could have been somewhat softened; but it has appeared that
only congenital characteristics are inherited, apart from certain not
very important exceptions. Thus the congenital differences between men
acquire fundamental importance.</p>
<p>There is a further consequence of the theory of evolution, which is
independent of the particular mechanism suggested by Darwin. If men and
animals have a common ancestry, and if men developed by such slow stages
that there were creatures which we should not know whether to classify
as human or not, the question arises: at what stage in evolution did
men, or their semi-human ancestors, begin to be all equal? Would
Pithecanthropus erectus, if he had been properly educated, have done
work as good as Newton’s? Would the Piltdown Man have written
Shakespeare’s poetry if there had been anybody to convict him of
poaching? A resolute egalitarian who answers these questions in the
affirmative will find himself forced to regard apes as the equals of
human beings. And why stop with apes? I do not see how he is to resist
an argument in favour of Votes for Oysters. An adherent of evolution
should maintain that not only the doctrine of the equality of all men,
but also that of the rights of man, must be condemned as unbiological,
since it makes too emphatic a distinction between men and other
animals.</p>
<p>There is, however, another aspect of liberalism which was greatly
strengthened by the doctrine of evolution, namely the belief in
progress. So long as the state of the world allowed optimism, evolution
was welcomed by liberals, both on this ground and because it gave new
arguments against orthodox theology. Marx himself, though his doctrines
are in some respects pre-Darwinian, wished to dedicate his book to
Darwin.</p>
<p>The prestige of biology caused men whose thinking was influenced by
science to apply biological rather than mechanistic categories to the
world. Everything was supposed to be evolving, and it was easy to
imagine an immanent goal. In spite of Darwin, many men considered that
evolution justified a belief in cosmic purpose. The conception of
organism came to be thought the key to both scientific and philosophical
explanations of natural laws, and the atomic thinking of the eighteenth
century came to be regarded as out of date. This point of view has at
last influenced even theoretical physics. In politics it leads naturally
to emphasis upon the community as opposed to the individual. This is in
harmony with the growing power of the State; also with nationalism,
which can appeal to the Darwinian doctrine of survival of the fittest
applied, not to individuals, but to nations. But here we are passing
into the region of extra-scientific views suggested to a large public by
scientific doctrines imperfectly understood.</p>
<p>While biology has militated against a mechanistic view of the world,
modern economic technique has had an opposite effect. Until about the
end of the eighteenth century, scientific technique, as opposed to
scientific doctrines, had no important effect upon opinion. It was only
with the rise of industrialism that technique began to affect men’s
thought. And even then, for a long time, the effect was more or less
indirect. Men who produce philosophical theories are, as a rule, brought
into very little contact with machinery. The romantics noticed and hated
the ugliness that industrialism was producing in places hitherto
beautiful, and the vulgarity (as they considered it) of those who had
made money in ‘trade’. This led them into an opposition to the middle
class which sometimes brought them into something like an alliance with
the champions of the proletariat. Engels praised Carlyle, not perceiving
that what Carlyle desired was not the emancipation of wage-earners, but
their subjection to the kind of masters they had had in the Middle Ages.
The Socialists welcomed industrialism, but wished to free industrial
workers from subjection to the power of employers. They were influenced
by industrialism in the problems that they considered, but not much in
the ideas that they employed in the solution of their problems.</p>
<p>The most important effect of machine production on the imaginative
picture of the world is an immense increase in the sense of human power.
This is only an acceleration of a process which began before the dawn of
history, when men diminished their fear of wild animals by the invention
of weapons and their fear of starvation by the invention of agriculture.
But the acceleration has been so great as to produce a radically new
outlook in those who wield the powers that modern technique has created.
In old days, mountains and waterfalls were natural phenomena; now, an
inconvenient mountain can be abolished and a convenient waterfall can be
created. In old days, there were deserts and fertile regions; now, the
desert can, if people think it worth while, be made to blossom like the
rose, while fertile regions are turned into deserts by insufficiently
scientific optimists. In old days, peasants lived as their parents and
grandparents had lived, and believed as their parents and grandparents
had believed; not all the power of the Church could eradicate pagan
ceremonies, which had to be given a Christian dress by being connected
with local saints. Now the authorities can decree what the children of
peasants shall learn in school, and can transform the mentality of
agriculturists in a generation; one gathers that this has been achieved
in Russia.</p>
<p>There thus arises, among those who direct affairs or are in touch
with those who do so, a new belief in power: first, the power of man in
his conflicts with nature, and then the power of rulers as against the
human beings whose beliefs and aspirations they seek to control by
scientific propaganda, especially education. The result is a diminution
of fixity; no change seems impossible. Nature is raw material; so is
that part of the human race which does not effectively participate in
government. There are certain old conceptions which represent men’s
belief in the limits of human power; of these the two chief are God and
truth. (I do not mean that these two are logically connected.) Such
conceptions tend to melt away; even if not explicitly negated, they lose
importance, and are retained only superficially. This whole outlook is
new, and it is impossible to say how mankind will adapt itself to it. It
has already produced immense cataclysms, and will no doubt produce
others in the future. To frame a philosophy capable of coping with men
intoxicated with the prospect of almost unlimited power and also with
the apathy of the powerless is the most pressing task of our time.</p>
<p>Though many still sincerely believe in human equality and theoretical
democracy, the imagination of modern people is deeply affected by the
pattern of social organization suggested by the organization of industry
in the nineteenth century, which is essentially undemocratic. On the one
hand there are the captains of industry, and on the other the mass of
workers. This disruption of democracy from within is not yet
acknowledged by ordinary citizens in democratic countries, but it has
been a preoccupation of most philosophers from Hegel onwards, and the
sharp opposition which they discovered between the interests of the many
and those of the few has found practical expression in Fascism. Of the
philosophers, Nietzsche was unashamedly on the side of the few, Marx
whole-heartedly on the side of the many. Perhaps Bentham was the only
one of importance who attempted a reconciliation of conflicting
interests; he therefore incurred the hostility of both parties.</p>
<p>To formulate any satisfactory modern ethic of human relationships, it
will be essential to recognize the necessary limitations of men’s power
over the non-human environment, and the desirable limitations of their
power over each other.</p>
