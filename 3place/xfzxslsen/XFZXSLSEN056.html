<h4 id="hobbess-leviathan">8 HOBBES’S LEVIATHAN</h4>
<p>Hobbes (1588–1679) is a philosopher whom it is difficult to classify.
He was an empiricist, like Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, but unlike them,
he was an admirer of mathematical method, not only in pure mathematics,
but in its applications. His general outlook was inspired by Galileo
rather than Bacon. From Descartes to Kant, Continental philosophy
derived much of its conception of the nature of human knowledge from
mathematics, but it regarded mathematics as known independently of
experience. It was thus led, like Platonism, to minimize the part played
by pure thought. English empiricism, on the other hand, was little
influenced by mathematics, and tended to have a wrong conception of
scientific method. Hobbes had neither of these defects. It is not until
our own day that we find any other philosophers who were empiricists and
yet laid due stress on mathematics. In this respect, Hobbes’s merit is
great. He has, however, grave defects, which make it impossible to place
him quite in the first rank. He is impatient of subtleties, and too much
inclined to cut the Gordian knot. His solutions of problems are logical,
but are attained by omitting awkward facts. He is vigorous, but crude;
he wields the battle-axe better than the rapier. Nevertheless, his
theory of the State deserves to be carefully considered, the more so as
it is more modern than any previous theory, even that of
Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Hobbes’s father was a vicar, who was ill-tempered and uneducated; he
lost his job by quarrelling with a neighbouring vicar at the church
door. After this, Hobbes was brought up by an uncle. He acquired a good
knowledge of the classics, and translated The Medea of Euripides into
Latin iambics at the age of fourteen. (In later life, he boasted,
justifiably, that though he abstained from quoting classical poets and
orators, this was not from lack of familiarity with their works.) At
fifteen, he went to Oxford, where they taught him scholastic logic and
the philosophy of Aristotle. These were his bugbears in later life, and
he maintained that he had profited little by his years at the
university; indeed universities in general are constantly criticized in
his writings. In the year 1610, when he was twenty-two years old, he
became tutor to Lord Hardwick (afterwards second Earl of Devonshire),
with whom he made the grand tour. It was at this time that he began to
know the work of Galileo and Kepler, which profoundly influenced him.
His pupil became his patron, and remained so until he died in 1628.
Through him, Hobbes met Ben Jonson and Bacon and Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and many other important men. After the death of the Earl of
Devonshire, who left a young son, Hobbes lived for a time in Paris,
where he began the study of Euclid; then he became tutor to his former
pupil’s son. With him he travelled to Italy, where he visited Galileo in
1636. In 1637 he came back to England.</p>
<p>The political opinions expressed in the Leviathan, which were
Royalist in the extreme, had been held by Hobbes for a long time. When
the Parliament of 1628 drew up the Petition of Right, he published a
translation of Thucydides, with the expressed intention of showing the
evils of democracy. When the Long Parliament met in 1640, and Laud and
Strafford were sent to the Tower, Hobbes was terrified and fled to
France. His book, De Cive, written in 1641, though not published till
1647, sets forth essentially the same theory as that of the Leviathan.
It was not the actual occurrence of the Civil War that caused his
opinions, but the prospect of it; naturally, however, his convictions
were strengthened when his fears were realized.</p>
<p>In Paris he was welcomed by many of the leading mathematicians and
men of science. He was one of those who saw Descartes’ Meditations
before they were published, and wrote objections to them, which were
printed by Descartes with his replies. He also soon had a large company
of English Royalist refugees with whom to associate. For a time, from
1646 to 1648, he taught mathematics to the future Charles II. When,
however, in 1651, he published the Leviathan, it pleased no one. Its
rationalism offended most of the refugees, and its bitter attacks on the
Catholic Church offended the French Government. Hobbes therefore fled
secretly to London, where he made submission to Cromwell, and abstained
from all political activity.</p>
<p>He was not idle, however, either at this time or at any other during
his long life. He had a controversy with Bishop Bramhall on free will;
he was himself a rigid determinist. Over-estimating his own capacities
as a geometer, he imagined that he had discovered how to square the
circle; on this subject he very foolishly embarked on a controversy with
Wallis, the professor of geometry at Oxford. Naturally the professor
succeeded in making him look silly.</p>
<p>At the Restoration, Hobbes was taken up by the less earnest of the
king’s friends, and by the king himself, who not only had Hobbes’s
portrait on his walls, but awarded him a pension of £100 a year—which,
however, His Majesty forgot to pay. The Lord Chancellor Clarendon was
shocked by the favour shown to a man suspected of atheism, and so was
Parliament. After the Plague and the Great Fire, when people’s
superstitious fears were aroused, the House of Commons appointed a
committee to inquire into atheistical writings, specially mentioning
those of Hobbes. From this time onwards, he could not obtain leave in
England to print anything on controversial subjects. Even his history of
the Long Parliament, which he called Behemoth, though it set forth the
most orthodox doctrine, had to be printed abroad (1668). The collected
edition of his works in 1688 appeared in Amsterdam. In his old age, his
reputation abroad was much greater than in England. To occupy his
leisure, he wrote, at eighty-four, an autobiography in Latin verse, and
published, at eighty-seven, a translation of Homer. I cannot discover
that he wrote any large books after the age of eighty-seven.</p>
<p>We will now consider the doctrines of the Leviathan, upon which the
fame of Hobbes mainly rests.</p>
<p>He proclaims, at the very beginning of the book, his thorough-going
materialism. Life, he says, is nothing but a motion of the limbs, and
therefore automata have an artificial life. The commonwealth, which he
calls Leviathan, is a creation of art, and is in fact an artificial man.
This is intended as more than an analogy, and is worked out in some
detail. The sovereignty is an artificial soul. The pacts and covenants
by which ‘Leviathan’ is first created take the place of God’s fiat when
He said ‘Let Us make man’.</p>
<p>The first part deals with man as an individual, and with such general
philosophy as Hobbes deems necessary. Sensations are caused by the
pressure of objects; colours, sounds, etc., are not in the objects. The
qualities in objects that correspond to our sensations are motions. The
first law of motion is stated, and is immediately applied to psychology:
imagination is a decaying sense, both being motions. Imagination when
asleep is dreaming; the religions of the gentiles came of not
distinguishing dreams from waking life. (The rash reader may apply the
same argument to the Christian religion, but Hobbes is much too cautious
to do so himself.1) Belief that dreams are prophetic is a delusion; so
is the belief in witchcraft and in ghosts.</p>
<p>The succession of our thoughts is not arbitrary, but governed by
laws—sometimes those of association, sometimes those depending upon a
purpose in our thinking. (This is important as an application of
determinism to psychology.)</p>
<p>Hobbes, as might be expected, is an out-and-out nominalist. There is,
he says, nothing universal but names, and without words we could not
conceive</p>
<p>any general ideas. Without language, there would be no truth or
falsehood, for ‘true’ and ‘false’ are attributes of speech.</p>
<p>He considers geometry the one genuine science so far created.
Reasoning is of the nature of reckoning, and should start from
definitions. But it is necessary to avoid self-contradictory notions in
definitions, which is not usually done in philosophy. ‘Incorporeal
substance’, for instance, is nonsense. When it is objected that God is
an incorporeal substance, Hobbes has two answers: first, that God is not
an object of philosophy; second, that many philosophers have thought God
corporeal. All error in general propositions, he says, comes from
absurdity (i.e. self-contradiction); he gives as examples of absurdity
the idea of free will, and of cheese having the accidents of bread. (We
know that, according to the Catholic faith, the accidents of bread can
inhere in a substance that is not bread.)</p>
<p>In this passage Hobbes shows an old-fashioned rationalism. Kepler had
arrived at a general proposition: ‘Planets go round the sun in
ellipses’; but other views, such as those of Ptolemy, are not logically
absurd. Hobbes has not appreciated the use of induction for arriving at
general laws, in spite of his admiration for Kepler and Galileo.</p>
<p>As against Plato, Hobbes holds that reason is not innate, but is
developed by industry.</p>
<p>He comes next to a consideration of the passions. ‘Endeavour’ may be
defined as a small beginning of motion; if towards something, it is
desire, and if away from something it is aversion. Love is the same as
desire, and hate is the same as aversion. We call a thing ‘good’ when it
is an object of desire, and ‘bad’ when it is an object of aversion. (It
will be observed that these definitions give no objectivity to ‘good’
and ‘bad’; if men differ in their desires, there is no theoretical
method of adjusting their differences.) There are definitions of various
passions, mostly based on a competitive view of life; for instance,
laughter is sudden glory. Fear of invisible power, if publicly allowed,
is religion; if not allowed, superstition. Thus the decision as to what
is religion and what superstition rests with the legislator. Felicity
involves continual progress; it consists in prospering, not in having
prospered; there is no such thing as a static happiness—excepting, of
course, the joys of heaven, which surpass our comprehension.</p>
<p>Will is nothing but the last appetite or aversion remaining in
deliberation. That is to say, will is not something different from
desire and aversion, but merely the strongest in a case of conflict.
This is connected, obviously, with Hobbes’s denial of free will.</p>
<p>Unlike most defenders of despotic government, Hobbes holds that all
men are naturally equal. In a state of nature, before there is any
government, every man desires to preserve his own liberty, but to
acquire dominion over others; both these desires are dictated by the
impulse to self-preservation. From their conflict arises a war of all
against all, which makes life ‘nasty, brutish, and short’. In a state of
nature, there is no property, no justice or injustice; there is only
war, and ‘force and fraud are, in war, the two cardinal virtues’.</p>
<p>The second part tells how men escape from these evils by combining
into communities each subject to a central authority. This is
represented as happening by means of a social contract. It is supposed
that a number of people come together and agree to choose a sovereign,
or a sovereign body, which shall exercise authority over them and put an
end to the universal war. I do not think this ‘covenant’ (as Hobbes
usually calls it) is thought of as a definite historical event; it is
certainly irrelevant to the argument to think of it as such. It is an
explanatory myth, used to explain why men submit, and should submit, to
the limitations on personal freedom entailed in submission to authority.
The purpose of the restraint men put upon themselves, says</p>
<p>Hobbes, is self-preservation from the universal war resulting from
our love of liberty for ourselves and of dominion over others. Hobbes
considers the question why men cannot co-operate like ants and bees.
Bees in the same hive, he says, do not compete; they have no desire for
honour; and they do not use reason to criticize the government. Their
agreement is natural, but that of men can only be artificial, by
covenant. The covenant must confer power on one man or one assembly,
since otherwise it cannot be enforced. ‘Covenants, without the sword,
are but words.’ (President Wilson unfortunately forgot this.) The
covenant is not, as afterwards in Locke and Rousseau, between the
citizens and the ruling power; it is a covenant made by the citizens
with each other to obey such ruling power as the majority shall choose.
When they have chosen, their political power is at an end. The minority
is as much bound as the majority, since the covenant was to obey the
government chosen by the majority. When the government has been chosen,
the citizens lose all rights except such as the government may find it
expedient to grant. There is no right of rebellion, because the ruler is
not bound by any contract, whereas the subjects are.</p>
<p>A multitude so united is called a commonwealth. This ‘Leviathan’ is a
mortal God.</p>
<p>Hobbes prefers monarchy, but all his abstract arguments are equally
applicable to all forms of government in which there is one supreme
authority not limited by the legal rights of other bodies. He could
tolerate Parliament alone, but not a system in which governmental power
is shared between King and Parliament. This is the exact antithesis to
the views of Locke and Montesquieu. The English Civil War occurred, says
Hobbes, because power was divided between King, Lords, and Commons.</p>
<p>The supreme power, whether a man or an assembly, is called the
Sovereign. The powers of the sovereign, in Hobbes’s system, are
unlimited. He has the right of censorship over all expression of
opinion. It is assumed that his main interest is the preservation of
internal peace, and that therefore he will not use the power of
censorship to suppress truth, for a doctrine repugnant to peace cannot
be true. (A singularly pragmatist view!) The laws of property are to be
entirely subject to the sovereign; for in a state of nature there is no
property, and therefore property is created by government, which may
control its creation as it pleases.</p>
<p>It is admitted that the sovereign may be despotic, but even the worst
despotism is better than anarchy. Moreover, in many points the interests
of the sovereign are identical with those of his subjects. He is richer
if they are richer, safer if they are law-abiding, and so on. Rebellion
is wrong, both because it usually fails, and because, if it succeeds, it
sets a bad example, and teaches others to rebel. The Aristotelian
distinction between tyranny and monarchy is rejected; a ‘tyranny’,
according to Hobbes, is merely a monarchy that the speaker happens to
dislike.</p>
<p>Various reasons are given for preferring government by a monarch to
government by an assembly. It is admitted that the monarch will usually
follow his private interest when it conflicts with that of the public,
but so will an assembly. A monarch may have favourites, but so may every
member of an assembly; therefore the total number of favourites is
likely to be fewer under a monarchy. A monarch can hear advice from
anybody secretly; an assembly can only hear advice from its own members,
and that publicly. In an assembly, the chance absence of some may cause
a different party to obtain the majority, and thus produce a change of
policy. Moreover, if the assembly is divided against itself, the result
may be civil war. For all these reasons, Hobbes concludes, a monarchy is
best.</p>
<p>Throughout the Leviathan, Hobbes never considers the possible effect
of periodical elections in curbing the tendency of assemblies to
sacrifice the public interest to the private interest of their members.
He seems, in fact, to be thinking, not of democratically elected
Parliaments, but of bodies like the Grand Council in Venice or the House
of Lords in England. He conceives democracy, in the manner of antiquity,
as involving the direct participation of every citizen in legislation
and administration; at least, this seems to be his view.</p>
<p>The part of the people, in Hobbes’s system, ends completely with the
first choice of a sovereign. The succession is to be determined by the
sovereign, as was the practice in the Roman Empire when mutinies did not
interfere. It is admitted that the sovereign will usually choose one of
his own children, or a near relative if he has no children, but it is
held that no law ought to prevent him from choosing otherwise.</p>
<p>There is a chapter on the liberty of subjects, which begins with an
admirably precise definition: liberty is the absence of external
impediments to motion. In this sense, liberty is consistent with
necessity; for instance, water necessarily flows down hill when there
are no impediments to its motion, and when, therefore, according to the
definition, it is free. A man is free to do what he wills, but
necessitated to do what God wills. All our volitions have causes, and
are in this sense necessary. As for the liberty of subjects, they are
free where the laws do not interfere; this is no limitation of
sovereignty, since the laws could interfere if the sovereign so decided.
Subjects have no rights as against the sovereign, except what the
sovereign voluntarily concedes. When David caused Uriah to be killed, he
did no injury to Uriah because Uriah was his subject; but he did an
injury to God, because he was God’s subject and was disobeying God’s
law.</p>
<p>The ancient authors, with their praises of liberty, have led men,
according to Hobbes, to favour tumults and seditions. He maintains that,
when they are rightly interpreted, the liberty they praised was that of
sovereigns, i.e. liberty from foreign domination. Internal resistance to
sovereigns he condemns even when it might seem most justified. For
example, he holds that St Ambrose had no right to excommunicate the
Emperor Theodosius after the massacre of Thessalonica. And he vehemently
censures Pope Zachary for having helped to depose the last of the
Merovingians in favour of Pepin.</p>
<p>He admits, however, one limitation on the duty of submission to
sovereigns. The right of self-preservation he regards as absolute, and
subjects have the right of self-defence, even against monarchs. This is
logical, since he has made self-preservation the motive for instituting
government. On this ground he holds (though with limitations) that a man
has a right to refuse to fight when called upon by the government to do
so. This is a right which no modern government concedes. A curious
result of his egoistic ethic is that resistance to the sovereign is only
justified in self-defence; resistance in defence of another is always
culpable.</p>
<p>There is one other quite logical exception: a man has no duty to a
sovereign who has not the power to protect him. This justified Hobbes’s
submission to Cromwell while Charles II was in exile.</p>
<p>There must, of course, be no such bodies, as political parties or
what we should now call trade unions. All teachers are to be ministers
of the sovereign, and are to teach only what the sovereign thinks
useful. The rights of property are only valid as against other subjects,
not as against the sovereign. The sovereign has the right to regulate
foreign trade. He is not subject to the civil law. His right to punish
comes to him, not from any concept of justice, but because he retains
the liberty that all men had in the state of nature, when no man could
be blamed for inflicting injury on another.</p>
<p>There is an interesting list of the reasons (other than foreign
conquest) for the dissolution of commonwealths. These are: giving too
little power to the sovereign; allowing private judgment in subjects;
the theory that everything that is against conscience is sin; the belief
in inspiration; the doctrine that the sovereign is subject to civil
laws; the recognition of absolute private property; division of the
sovereign power; imitation of the Greeks and Romans; separation of
temporal and spiritual powers; refusing the power of taxation to the
sovereign; the popularity of potent subjects; and the liberty of
disputing with the sovereign. Of all these, there were abundant
instances in the then recent history of England and France.</p>
<p>There should not, Hobbes thinks, be much difficulty in teaching
people to believe in the rights of the sovereign, for have they not been
taught to believe in Christianity, and even in transubstantiation, which
is contrary to reason? There should be days set apart for learning the
duty of submission. The instruction of the people depends upon right
teaching in the universities, which must therefore be carefully
supervised. There must be uniformity of worship, the religion being that
ordained by the sovereign.</p>
<p>Part II ends with the hope that some sovereign will read the book and
make himself absolute—a less chimerical hope than Plato’s, that some
king would turn philosopher. Monarchs are assured that the book is easy
reading and quite interesting.</p>
<p>Part III, ‘Of a Christian Commonwealth’, explains that there is no
universal Church, because the Church must depend upon the civil
government. In each country, the king must be head of the Church; the
Pope’s overlordship and infallibility cannot be admitted. It argues, as
might be expected, that a Christian who is a subject of a non-Christian
sovereign should yield outwardly, for was not Naaman suffered to bow
himself in the house of Rimmon?</p>
<p>Part IV, ‘Of the Kingdom of Darkness’, is mainly concerned with
criticism of the Church of Rome, which Hobbes hates because it puts the
spiritual power above the temporal. The rest of this part is an attack
on ‘vain philosophy’, by which Aristotle is usually meant.</p>
<p>Let us now try to decide what we are to think of the Leviathan. The
question is not easy, because the good and the bad in it are so closely
intermingled.</p>
<p>In politics, there are two different questions, one as to the best
form of the State, the other as to its powers. The best form of State,
according to Hobbes, is monarchy, but this is not the important part of
his doctrine. The important part is his contention that the powers of
the State should be absolute. This doctrine, or something like it, had
grown up in Western Europe during the Renaissance and the Reformation.
First, the feudal nobility were cowed by Louis XI, Edward IV, Ferdinand
and Isabella, and their successors. Then the Reformation, in Protestant
countries, enabled the lay government to get the better of the Church.
Henry VIII wielded a power such as no earlier English king had enjoyed.
But in France the Reformation, at first, had the opposite effect;
between the Guises and the Huguenots, the kings were nearly powerless.
Henry IV and Richelieu, not long before Hobbes wrote, had laid the
foundations of the absolute monarchy which lasted in France till the
Revolution. In Spain, Charles V had got the better of the Cortes, and
Philip II was absolute except in relation to the Church. In England,
however, the Puritans had undone the work of Henry VIII; their work
suggested to Hobbes that anarchy must result from resistance to the
sovereign.</p>
<p>Every community is faced with two dangers, anarchy and despotism. The
Puritans, especially the Independents, were most impressed by the danger
of despotism. Hobbes, on the contrary having experienced the conflict of
rival fanaticisms, was obsessed by the fear of anarchy. The liberal
philosophers who arose after the Restoration, and acquired control after
1688, realized both dangers; they disliked both Strafford and the
Anabaptists. This led Locke to the doctrine of division of powers, and
of checks and balances. In England there was a real division of powers
so long as the King had influence; then Parliament became supreme, and
ultimately the Cabinet. In America, there are still checks and balances
in so far as Congress and the Supreme Court can resist the
Administration. In Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan, the government has
had even more power than Hobbes thought desirable. On the whole,
therefore, as regards the powers of the State, the world has gone as
Hobbes wished, after a long liberal period during which, at least
apparently, it was moving in the opposite direction. In spite of the
outcome of the present war, it seems evident that the functions of the
State must continue to increase, and that resistance to it must grow
more and more difficult.</p>
<p>The reason that Hobbes gives for supporting the State, namely that it
is the only alternative to anarchy, is in the main a valid one. A State
may, however, be so bad that temporary anarchy seems preferable to its
continuance, as in France in 1789 and in Russia in 1917. Moreover, the
tendency of every government towards tyranny cannot be kept in check
unless governments have some fear of rebellion. Governments would be
worse than they are if Hobbes’s submissive attitude were universally
adopted by subjects. This is true in the political sphere, where
governments will try, if they can, to make themselves personally
irremovable; it is true in the economic sphere, where they will try to
enrich themselves and their friends at the public expense; it is true in
the intellectual sphere, where they will suppress every new discovery or
doctrine that seems to menace their power. These are reasons for not
thinking only of the risk of anarchy, but also of the danger of
injustice and ossification that is bound up with omnipotence in
government.</p>
<p>The merits of Hobbes appear most clearly when he is contrasted with
earlier political theorists. He is completely free from superstition; he
does not argue from what happened to Adam and Eve at the time of the
Fall. He is clear and logical; his ethics, right or wrong, is completely
intelligible, and does not involve the use of any dubious concepts.
Apart from Machiavelli, who is much more limited, he is the first really
modern writer on political theory. Where he is wrong, he is wrong from
over-simplification, not because the basis of his thought is unreal and
fantastic. For this reason, he is still worth refuting.</p>
<p>Without criticizing Hobbes’s metaphysics or ethics, there are two
points to make against him. The first is that he always considers the
national interest as a whole, and assumes, tacitly, that the major
interests of all citizens are the same. He does not realize the
importance of the clash between different classes, which Marx makes the
chief cause of social change. This is connected with the assumption that
the interests of a monarch are roughly identical with those of his
subjects. In time of war there is a unification of interests, especially
if the war is fierce; but in time of peace the clash may be very great
between the interests of one class and those of another. It is not by
any means always true that, in such a situation, the best way to avert
anarchy is to preach the absolute power of the sovereign. Some
concession in the way of sharing power may be the only way to prevent
civil war. This should have been obvious to Hobbes from the recent
history of England.</p>
<p>Another point in which Hobbes’s doctrine is unduly limited is in
regard to the relations between different States. There is not a word in
Leviathan to suggest any relation between them except war and conquest,
with occasional interludes. This follows, on his principles, from the
absence of an international government, for the relations of States are
still in a state of nature, which is that of a war of all against all.
So long as there is international anarchy, it is by no means clear that
increase of efficiency in the separate States is in the interest of
mankind, since it increases the ferocity and destructiveness of war.
Every argument that he adduces in favour of government, in so far as it
is valid at all, is valid in favour of international government. So long
as national States exist and fight each other, only inefficiency can
preserve the human race. To improve the fighting quality of separate
States without having any means of preventing war is the road to
universal destruction.</p>
