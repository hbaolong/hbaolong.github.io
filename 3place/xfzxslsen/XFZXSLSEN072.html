<h4 id="schopenhauer">24 SCHOPENHAUER</h4>
<p>Schopenhauer (1788–1860) is in many ways peculiar among philosophers.
He is a pessimist, whereas almost all the others are in some sense
optimists. He is not fully academic, like Kant and Hegel, nor yet
completely outside the academic tradition. He dislikes Christianity,
preferring the religions of India, both Hinduism and Buddhism. He is a
man of wide culture, quite as much interested in art as in ethics. He is
unusually free from nationalism, and as much at home with English and
French writers as with those of his own country. His appeal has always
been less to professional philosophers than to artistic and literary
people in search of philosophy that they could believe. He began the
emphasis on Will which is characteristic of much nineteenth- and
twentieth-century philosophy; but for him Will, though metaphysically
fundamental, is ethically evil—an opposition only possible for a
pessimist. He acknowledges three sources of his philosophy, Kant, Plato,
and the Upanishads, but I do not think he owes as much to Plato as he
thinks he does. His outlook has a certain temperamental affinity with
that of the Hellenistic age; it is tired and valetudinarian, valuing
peace more than victory, and quietism more than attempts at reform,
which he regards as inevitably futile.</p>
<p>Both his parents belonged to prominent commercial families in Danzig,
where he was born. His father was a Voltairian, who regarded England as
the land of liberty and intelligence. In common with most of the leading
citizens of Danzig, he hated the encroachments of Prussia on the
independence of the free city, and was indignant when it was annexed to
Prussia in 1793—so indignant that he removed to Hamburg, at considerable
pecuniary loss. Schopenhauer lived there with his father from 1793 to
1797; then he spent two years in Paris, at the end of which his father
was pleased to find that the boy had nearly forgotten German. In 1803 he
was put in a boarding-school in England, where he hated the cant and
hypocrisy. Two years later, to please his father, he became a clerk in a
commercial house in Hamburg, but he loathed the prospect of a business
career, and longed for a literary and academic life. This was made
possible by his father’s death, probably by suicide; his mother was
willing that he should abandon commerce for school and university. It
might be supposed that he would, in consequence, have preferred her to
his father, but the exact opposite happened: he disliked his mother, and
retained an affectionate memory of his father.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer’s mother was a lady of literary aspirations, who settled
in Weimar two weeks before the battle of Jena. There she kept a literary
salon, wrote books, and enjoyed friendships with men of culture. She had
little affection for her son, and a keen eye for his faults. She warned
him against bombast and empty pathos; he was annoyed by her
philanderings. When he came of age he inherited a modest competence;
after this, he and his mother gradually found each other more and more
intolerable. His low opinion of women is no doubt due, at least in part,
to his quarrels with his mother.</p>
<p>Already at Hamburg he had come under the influence of the romantics,
especially Tieck, Novalis, and Hoffmann, from whom he learnt to admire
Greece and to think ill of the Hebraic elements in Christianity. Another
romantic, Friedrich Schlegel, confirmed him in his admiration of Indian
philosophy. In the year in which he came of age (1809), he went to the
university of Göttingen, where he learnt to admire Kant. Two years later
he went to Berlin, where he studied mainly science; he heard Fichte
lecture, but despised him. He remained indifferent throughout the
excitement of the war of liberation. In 1819 he became a Privatdozent at
Berlin, and had the conceit to put his lectures at the same hour as
Hegel’s; having failed to lure away Hegel’s hearers, he soon ceased to
lecture. In the end he settled down to the life of an old bachelor in
Frankfurt. He kept a poodle named Atma (the world-soul) walked two hours
every day, smoked a long pipe, read the London Times, and employed
correspondents to hunt up evidences of his fame. He was anti-democratic,
and hated the revolution of 1848; he believed in spiritualism and magic;
in his study he had a bust of Kant and a bronze of Buddha. In his manner
of life he tried to imitate Kant except as regards early rising.</p>
<p>His principal work, The World as Will and Idea, was published at the
end of 1818. He believed it to be of great importance, and went so far
as to say that some paragraphs in it had been dictated by the Holy
Ghost. To his great mortification it fell completely flat. In 1844 he
persuaded the publisher to bring out a second edition; but it was not
till some years later that he began to receive some of the recognition
for which he longed.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer’s system is an adaptation of Kant’s, but one that
emphasizes quite different aspects of the Critique from those emphasized
by Fichte or Hegel. They got rid of the thing-in-itself, and thus made
knowledge metaphysically fundamental. Schopenhauer retained the
thing-in-itself, but identified it with will. He held that what appears
to perception as my body is really my will. There was more to be said
for this view as a development of Kant than most Kantians were willing
to recognize. Kant had maintained that a study of the moral law can take
us behind phenomena, and give us knowledge which sense-perception cannot
give; he also maintained that the moral law is essentially concerned
with the will. The difference between a good man and a bad man is, for
Kant, a difference in the world of things-in-themselves, and is also a
difference as to volitions. It follows that, for Kant, volitions must
belong to the real world, not to the world of phenomena. The phenomenon
corresponding to a volition is a bodily movement; that is why, according
to Schopenhauer, the body is the appearance of which will is the
reality.</p>
<p>But the will which is behind phenomena cannot consist of a number of
different volitions. Both time and space, according to Kant—and in this
Schopenhauer agrees with him—belong only to phenomena; the
thing-in-itself is not in space or time. My will, therefore, in the
sense in which it is real, cannot be dated, nor can it be composed of
separate acts of will, because it is space and time that are the source
of plurality—the ‘principle of individuation’, to use the scholastic
phrase which Schopenhauer prefers. My will, therefore, is one and
timeless. Nay, more, it is to be identified with the will of the whole
universe; my separateness is an illusion, resulting from my subjective
apparatus of spatio-temporal perception. What is real is one vast will,
appearing in the whole course of nature, animate and inanimate
alike.</p>
<p>So far, we might expect Schopenhauer to identify his cosmic will with
God, and teach a pantheistic doctrine not unlike Spinoza’s, in which
virtue would consist in conformity to the divine will. But at this point
his pessimism leads to a different development. The cosmic will is
wicked; will, altogether, is wicked, or at any rate is the source of all
our endless suffering. Suffering is essential to all life, and is
increased by every increase of knowledge. Will has no fixed end, which
if achieved would bring contentment. Although death must conquer in the
end, we pursue our futile purposes, ‘as we blow out a soap-bubble as
long and as large as possible, although we know perfectly well that it
will burst’. There is no such thing as happiness, for an unfulfilled
wish causes pain, and attainment brings only satiety. Instinct urges men
to procreation, which brings into existence a new occasion for suffering
and death; that is why shame is associated with the sexual act. Suicide
is useless; the doctrine of transmigration, even if not literally true,
conveys truth in the form of a myth.</p>
<p>All this is very sad, but there is a way out, and it was discovered
in India.</p>
<p>The best of myths is that of Nirvana (which Schopenhauer interprets
as extinction). This, he agrees, is contrary to Christian doctrine, but
‘the ancient wisdom of the human race will not be displaced by what
happened in Galilee’. The cause of suffering is intensity of will; the
less we exercise will, the less we shall suffer. And here knowledge
turns out to be useful after all, provided it is knowledge of a certain
sort. The distinction between one man and another is part of the
phenomenal world, and disappears when the world is seen truly. To the
good man, the veil of Maya (illusion) has become transparent; he sees
that all things are one, and that the distinction between himself and
another is only apparent. He reaches this insight by love, which is
always sympathy, and has to do with the pain of others. When the veil of
Maya is lifted, a man takes on the suffering of the whole world. In the
good man, knowledge of the whole quiets all volition; his will turns
away from life and denies his own nature. ‘There arises within him a
horror of the nature of which his own phenomenal existence is an
expression, the kernel and inner nature of that world which is
recognized as full of misery.’</p>
<p>Hence Schopenhauer is led to complete agreement, at least as regards
practice, with ascetic mysticism. Eckhart and Angelus Silesius are
better than the New Testament. There are some good things in orthodox
Christianity, notably the doctrine of original sin as preached, against
‘the vulgar Pelagianism’, by St Augustine and Luther; but the Gospels
are sadly deficient in metaphysics. Buddhism, he says, is the highest
religion; and his ethical doctrines are orthodox throughout Asia, except
where the ‘detestable doctrine of Islam’ prevails.</p>
<p>The good man will practise complete chastity, voluntary poverty,
fasting, and self-torture. In all things he will aim at breaking down
his individual will. But he does not do this, as do the Western mystics,
to achieve harmony with God; no such positive good is sought. The good
that is sought is wholly and entirely negative:</p>
<p>‘We must banish the dark impression of that nothingness which we
discern behind all virtue and holiness as their final goal, and which we
fear as children fear the dark; we must not even evade it like the
Indians, through myths and meaningless words, such as reabsorption in
Brahma or the Nirvana of the Buddhists. Rather do we freely acknowledge
that what remains after the entire abolition of will is for all those
who are still full of will certainly nothing; but, conversely, to those
in whom the will has turned and has denied itself, this our world, which
is so real, with all its suns and milky ways—is nothing.’</p>
<p>There is a vague suggestion here that the saint sees something
positive which other men do not see, but there is nowhere a hint as to
what this is, and I think the suggestion is only rhetorical. The world
and all its phenomena, Schopenhauer says, are only the objectification
of will. With the surrender of the will,</p>
<p>‘all those phenomena are also abolished; that constant strain and
effort without end and without rest at all the grades of objectivity in
which and through which the world consists; the multifarious forms
succeeding each other in gradation; the whole manifestation of the will;
and, finally, also the universal forms of this manifestation, time and
space, and also its last fundamental form, subject and object; all are
abolished. No will: no idea, no world. Before us there is certainly only
nothingness’.</p>
<p>We cannot interpret this except as meaning that the saint’s purpose
is to come as near as possible to non-existence, which, for some reason
never clearly explained, he cannot achieve by suicide. Why the saint is
to be preferred to a man who is always drunk is not very easy to see;
perhaps Schopenhauer thought the sober moments were bound to be sadly
frequent.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer’s gospel of resignation is not very consistent and not
very sincere. The mystics to whom he appeals believed in contemplation;
in the Beatific Vision the most profound kind of knowledge was to be
achieved, and this kind of knowledge was the supreme good. Ever since
Parmenides, the delusive knowledge of appearance was contrasted with
another kind of knowledge, not with something of a wholly different
kind. Christianity teaches that in knowledge of God standeth our eternal
life. But Schopenhauer will have none of this. He agreed that what
commonly passes for knowledge belongs to the realm of Maya, but when we
pierce the veil, we behold not God, but Satan, the wicked omnipotent
will, perpetually busied in weaving a web of suffering for the torture
of its creatures. Terrified by the Diabolic Vision, the sage cries
‘Avaunt!’ and seeks refuge in non-existence. It is an insult to the
mystics to claim them as believers in this mythology. And the suggestion
that, without achieving complete non-existence, the sage may yet live a
life having some value, is not possible to reconcile with Schopenhauer’s
pessimism. So long as the sage exists, he exists because he retains
will, which is evil. He may diminish the quantity of evil by weakening
his will, but he can never acquire any positive good.</p>
<p>Nor is the doctrine sincere, if we may judge by Schopenhauer’s life.
He habitually dined well, at a good restaurant; he had many trivial
love-affairs, which were sensual but not passionate; he was exceedingly
quarrelsome and unusually avaricious. On one occasion he was annoyed by
an elderly seamstress who was talking to a friend outside the door of
his apartment. He threw her downstairs, causing her permanent injury.
She obtained a court order compelling him to pay her a certain sum (15
thalers) every quarter as long as she lived. When at last she died,
after twenty years, he noted in his account-book: ’Obit anus, abit
onus.’1 It is hard to find in his life evidences of</p>
<p>any virtue except kindness to animals, which he carried to the point
of objecting to vivisection in the interests of science. In all other
respects he was completely selfish. It is difficult to believe that a
man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of asceticism and
resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions
in his practice.</p>
<p>Historically, two things are important about Schopenhauer: his
pessimism, and his doctrine that will is superior to knowledge. His
pessimism made it possible for men to take to philosophy without having
to persuade themselves that all evil can be explained away, and in this
way, as an antidote, it was useful. From a scientific point of view,
optimism and pessimism are alike objectionable: optimism assumes, or
attempts to prove, that the universe exists to please us, and pessimism
that it exists to displease us. Scientifically, there is no evidence
that it is concerned with us either one way or the other. The belief in
either pessimism or optimism is a matter of temperament, not of reason,
but the optimistic temperament has been much commoner among Western
philosophers. A representative of the opposite party is therefore likely
to be useful in bringing forward considerations which would otherwise be
overlooked.</p>
<p>More important than pessimism was the doctrine of the primacy of the
will. It is obvious that this doctrine has no necessary logical
connection with pessimism, and those who held it after Schopenhauer
frequently found in it a basis for optimism. In one form or another, the
doctrine that will is paramount has been held by many modern
philosophers, notably Nietzsche, Bergson, James, and Dewey. It has,
moreover, acquired a vogue outside the circles of professional
philosophers. And in proportion as will has gone up in the scale,
knowledge has gone down. This is, I think, the most notable change that
has come over the temper of philosophy in our age. It was prepared by
Rousseau and Kant, but was first proclaimed in its purity by
Schopenhauer. For this reason, in spite of inconsistency and a certain
shallowness, his philosophy has considerable importance as a stage in
historical development.</p>
