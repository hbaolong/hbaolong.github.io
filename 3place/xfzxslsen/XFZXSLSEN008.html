<h4 id="parmenides">5 PARMENIDES</h4>
<p>The Greeks were not addicted to moderation, either in their theories
or in their practice. Heraclitus maintained that everything changes:
Parmenides retorted that nothing changes.</p>
<p>Parmenides was a native of Elea, in the south of Italy, and
flourished in the first half of the fifth century B.C. According to
Plato, Socrates in his youth (say about the year 450 B.C.) had an
interview with Parmenides, then an old man, and learnt much from him.
Whether or not this interview is historical, we may at least infer, what
is otherwise evident, that Plato himself was influenced by the doctrines
of Parmenides. The south Italian and Sicilian philosophers were more
inclined to mysticism and religion than those of Ionia, who were on the
whole scientific and sceptical in their tendencies. But mathematics,
under the influence of Pythagoras, flourished more in Magna Graecia than
in Ionia; mathematics at that time, however, was entangled with
mysticism. Parmenides was influenced by Pythagoras, but the extent of
this influence is conjectural. What makes Parmenides historically
important is that he invented a form of metaphysical argument that, in
one form or another, is to be found in most subsequent metaphysicians
down to and including Hegel. He is often said to have invented logic,
but what he really invented was metaphysics based on logic.</p>
<p>The doctrine of Parmenides was set forth in a poem On Nature. He
considered the senses deceptive, and condemned the multitude of sensible
things as mere illusion. The only true being is ‘the One’, which is
infinite and indivisible. It is not, as in Heraclitus, a union of
opposites, since there are no opposites. He apparently thought, for
instance, that ‘cold’ means only ‘not hot’, and ‘dark’ means only ‘not
light’. ‘The One’ is not conceived by Parmenides as we conceive God; he
seems to think of it as material and extended, for he speaks of it as a
sphere. But it cannot be divided, because the whole of it is present
everywhere.</p>
<p>Parmenides divides his teaching into two parts, called respectively
‘the way of truth’ and ‘the way of opinion’. We need not concern
ourselves with the latter. What he says about the way of truth, so far
as it has survived, is, in its essential points, as follows:</p>
<p>‘Thou canst not know what is not—that is impossible—nor utter it; for
it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be.’</p>
<p>’How, then, can what is be going to be in the future? Or how could it
come into being? If it came into being, it is not; nor is it if it is
going to be in the future. Thus is becoming extinguished and passing
away not to be heard of.</p>
<p>’The thing that can be thought and that for the sake of which the
thought exists is the same; for you cannot find thought without
something that is, as to which it is uttered.’1</p>
<p>The essence of this argument is: When you think, you think of
something; when you use a name, it must be the name of something.
Therefore both thought and language require objects outside themselves.
And since you can think of a thing or speak of it at one time as well as
at another, whatever can be thought of or spoken of must exist at all
times. Consequently there can be no change, since change consists in
things coming into being or ceasing to be.</p>
<p>This is the first example in philosophy of an argument from thought
and language to the world at large. It cannot of course be accepted as
valid, but it is worth while to see what element of truth it
contains.</p>
<p>We can put the argument in this way: if language is not just
nonsense, words must mean something, and in general they must not mean
just other words, but something that is there whether we talk of it or
not. Suppose, for example, that you talk of George Washington. Unless
there were a historical person who had that name, the name (it would
seem) would be meaningless, and sentences containing the name would be
nonsense. Parmenides maintains that not only must George Washington have
existed in the past, but in some sense he must still exist, since we can
still use his name significantly. This seems obviously untrue, but how
are we to get round the argument?</p>
<p>Let us take an imaginary person, say Hamlet. Consider the statement
‘Hamlet was Prince of Denmark.’ In some sense this is true, but not in
the plain historical sense. The true statement is ‘Shakespeare says that
Hamlet was Prince of Denmark,’ or, more explicitly, ‘Shakespeare says
there was a Prince of Denmark called “Hamlet“.’ Here there is no longer
anything imaginary.</p>
<p>Shakespeare and Denmark and the noise ‘Hamlet’ are all real, but the
noise ‘Hamlet’ is not really a name, since nobody is really called
‘Hamlet’. If you say ‘“Hamlet“ is the name of an imaginary person,’ that
is not strictly correct; you ought to say ‘It is imagined that “Hamlet“
is the name of a real person.’</p>
<p>Hamlet is an imagined individual; unicorns are an imagined species.
Some sentences in which the word ‘unicorn’ occurs are true, and some are
false, but in each case not directly. Consider ‘a unicorn has one horn’
and ‘a cow has two horns’. To prove the latter you have to look at a
cow; it is not enough to say that in some book cows are said to have two
horns. But the evidence that unicorns have one horn is only to be found
in books, and in fact the correct statement is: ‘Certain books assert
that there are animals with one horn called “unicorns“.’ All statements
about unicorns are really about the word ‘unicorn’, just as all
statements about Hamlet are really about the word ‘Hamlet’.</p>
<p>But it is obvious that, in most cases, we are not speaking of words,
but of what the words mean. And this brings us back to the argument of
Parmenides, that if a word can be used significantly it must mean
something, not nothing, and therefore what the word means must in some
sense exist.</p>
<p>What, then, are we to say about George Washington? It seems we have
only two alternatives: one is to say that he still exists; the other is
to say that, when we use the words ‘George Washington’, we are not
really speaking of the man who bore that name. Either seems a paradox,
but the latter is less of a paradox, and I shall try to show a sense in
which it is true.</p>
<p>Parmenides assumes that words have a constant meaning; this is really
the basis of his argument, which he supposes unquestionable. But
although the dictionary or the encyclopaedia gives what may be called
the official and socially sanctioned meaning of a word, no two people
who use the same word have just the same thought in their minds.</p>
<p>George Washington himself could use his name and the word ‘I’ as
synonyms. He could perceive his own thoughts and the movements of his
body, and could therefore use his name with a fuller meaning than was
possible for any one else. His friends, when in his presence, could
perceive the movements of his body, and could divine his thoughts; to
them, the name ‘George Washington’ still denoted something concrete in
their own experience. After his death they had to substitute memories
for perceptions, which involved a change in the mental processes taking
place when they used his name. For us, who never knew him, the mental
processes are again different. We may think of his picture, and say to
ourselves ‘yes, that man’. We may think ‘the first President of the
United States’. If we are very ignorant, he may be to us merely ‘The man
who was called “George Washington“.’ Whatever the name suggests to us,
it must be not the man himself, since we never knew him, but something
now present to sense or memory or thought. This shows the fallacy of the
argument of Parmenides.</p>
<p>This perpetual change in the meanings of words is concealed by the
fact that, in general, the change makes no difference to the truth or
falsehood of the propositions in which the words occur. If you take any
true sentence in which the name ‘George Washington’ occurs, it will, as
a rule, remain true if you substitute the phrase ‘the first President of
the United States’. There are exceptions to this rule. Before
Washington’s election, a man might say ‘I hope George Washington will be
the first President of the United States,’ but he would not say ‘I hope
the first President of the United States will be the first President of
the United States’ unless he had an unusual passion for the law of
identity. But it is easy to make a rule for excluding these exceptional
cases, and in those that remain you may substitute for ‘George
Washington’ any descriptive phrase that applies to him alone. And it is
only by means of such phrases that we know what we know about him.</p>
<p>Parmenides contends that, since we can now know what is commonly
regarded as past, it cannot really be past, but must, in some sense,
exist now. Hence he infers that there is no such thing as change. What
we have been saying about George Washington meets this argument. It may
be said, in a sense, that we have no knowledge of the past. When you
recollect, the recollection occurs now, and is not identical with the
event recollected. But the recollection affords a description of the
past event, and for most practical purposes it is unnecessary to
distinguish between the description and what it describes.</p>
<p>This whole argument shows how easy it is to draw metaphysical
conclusions from language, and how the only way to avoid fallacious
arguments of this kind is to push the logical and psychological study of
language further than has been done by most metaphysicians.</p>
<p>I think, however, that, if Parmenides could return from the dead and
read what I have been saying, he would regard it as very superficial.
‘How do you know,’ he would ask, ‘that your statements about George
Washington refer to a past time? By your own account, the direct
reference is to things now present; your recollections, for instance,
happen now, not at the time that you think you recollect. If memory is
to be accepted as a source of knowledge, the past must be before the
mind now, and must therefore in some sense still exist.’</p>
<p>I will not attempt to meet this argument now; it requires a
discussion of memory, which is a difficult subject. I have put the
argument here to remind the reader that philosophical theories, if they
are important, can generally be revived in a new form after being
refuted as originally stated. Refutations are seldom final; in most
cases, they are only a prelude to further refinements.</p>
<p>What subsequent philosophy, down to quite modern times, accepted from
Parmenides, was not the impossibility of all change, which was too
violent a paradox, but the indestructibility of substance. The word
‘substance’ did not occur in his immediate successors, but the concept
is already present in their speculations. A substance was supposed to be
the persistent subject of varying predicates. As such it became, and
remained for more than two thousand years, one of the fundamental
concepts of philosophy, psychology, physics, and theology. I shall have
much to say about it at a later stage. For the present, I am merely
concerned to note that it was introduced as a way of doing justice to
the arguments of Parmenides without denying obvious facts.</p>
