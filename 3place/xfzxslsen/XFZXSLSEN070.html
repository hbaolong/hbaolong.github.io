<h4 id="hegel">22 HEGEL</h4>
<p>Hegel (1770–1831) was the culmination of the movement in German
philosophy that started from Kant; although he often criticized Kant,
his system could never have arisen if Kant’s had not existed. His
influence, though now diminishing, has been very great, not only or
chiefly in Germany. At the end of the nineteenth century, the leading
academic philosophers, both in America and in Great Britain, were
largely Hegelians. Outside of pure philosophy, many Protestant
theologians adopted his doctrines, and his philosophy of history
profoundly affected political theory. Marx, as everyone knows, was a
disciple of Hegel in his youth, and retained in his own finished system
some important Hegelian features. Even if (as I myself believe) almost
all Hegel’s doctrines are false, he still retains an importance which is
not merely historical, as the best representative of a certain kind of
philosophy which, in others, is less coherent and less
comprehensive.</p>
<p>His life contained few events of importance. In youth he was much
attracted to mysticism, and his later views may be regarded, to some
extent, as an intellectualizing of what had first appeared to him as
mystic insight. He taught philosophy, first as Privatdozent at Jena—he
mentions that he finished his Phenomenology of Mind there the day before
the battle of Jena—then at Nuremberg, then as professor at Heidelberg
(1816–1818), and finally at Berlin from 1818 to his death. He was in
later life a patriotic Prussian, a loyal servant of the State, who
comfortably enjoyed his recognized philosophical pre-eminence; but in
his youth he despised Prussia and admired Napoleon, to the extent of
rejoicing in the French victory at Jena.</p>
<p>Hegel’s philosophy is very difficult—he is, I should say, the hardest
to understand of all the great philosophers. Before entering on any
detail, a general characterization may prove helpful.</p>
<p>From his early interest in mysticism he retained a belief in the
unreality of separateness: the world, in his view, was not a collection
of hard units, whether atoms or souls, each completely self-subsistent.
The apparent self-subsistence of finite things appeared to him to be an
illusion; nothing, he held, is ultimately and completely real except the
whole. But he differed from Parmenides and Spinoza in conceiving the
whole, not as a simple substance, but as a complex system, of the sort
that we should call an organism. The apparently separate things of which
the world seems to be composed are not simply an illusion; each has a
greater or lesser degree of reality, and its reality consists in an
aspect of the whole, which is what it is seen to be when viewed truly.
With this view goes naturally a disbelief in the reality of time and
space as such, for these, if taken as completely real, involve
separateness and multiplicity. All this must have come to him first as
mystic ‘insight’; its intellectual elaboration, which is given in his
books, must have come later.</p>
<p>Hegel asserts that the real is rational, and the rational is real.
But when he says this he does not mean by ‘the real’ what an empiricist
would mean. He admits, and even urges, that what to the empiricist
appear to be facts are, and must be, irrational; it is only after their
apparent character has been transformed by viewing them as aspects of
the whole that they are seen to be rational. Nevertheless, the
identification of the real and the rational leads unavoidably to some of
the complacency inseparable from the belief that ‘whatever is, is
right’.</p>
<p>The whole, in all its complexity, is called by Hegel ‘the Absolute’.
The Absolute is spiritual; Spinoza’s view, that it has the attribute of
extension as well as that of thought, is rejected.</p>
<p>Two things distinguish Hegel from other men who have had a more or
less similar metaphysical outlook. One of these is emphasis on logic: it
is thought by Hegel that the nature of Reality can be deduced from the
sole consideration that it must be not self-contradictory. The other
distinguishing feature (which is closely connected with the first) is
the triadic movement called the ‘dialectic’. His most important books
are his two Logics, and these must be understood if the reasons for his
views on other subjects are to be rightly apprehended.</p>
<p>Logic, as Hegel understands the word, is declared by him to be the
same thing as metaphysics; it is something quite different from what is
commonly called logic. His view is that any ordinary predicate, if taken
as qualifying the whole of Reality, turns out to be self-contradictory.
One might take as a crude example the theory of Parmenides, that the
One, which alone is real, is spherical. Nothing can be spherical unless
it has a boundary, and it cannot have a boundary unless there is
something (at least empty space) outside of it. Therefore to suppose the
Universe as a whole to be spherical is self-contradictory. (This
argument might be questioned by bringing in non-Euclidean geometry, but
as an illustration it will serve.) Or let us take another illustration,
still more crude—far too much so to be used by Hegel. You may say,
without apparent contradiction, that Mr A is an uncle; but if you were
to say that the Universe is an uncle, you would land yourself in
difficulties. An uncle is a man who has a nephew, and the nephew is a
separate person from the uncle; therefore an uncle cannot be the whole
of Reality.</p>
<p>This illustration might also be used to illustrate the dialectic,
which consists of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. First we say:
‘Reality is an uncle.’ This is the thesis. But the existence of an uncle
implies that of a nephew. Since nothing really exists except the
Absolute, and we are now committed to the existence of a nephew, we must
conclude: ‘The Absolute is a nephew.’ This is the antithesis. But there
is the same objection to this as to the view that the Absolute is an
uncle; therefore we are driven to the view that the Absolute is the
whole composed of uncle and nephew. This is the synthesis. But this
synthesis is still unsatisfactory, because a man can be an uncle only if
he has a brother or sister who is a parent of the nephew. Hence we are
driven to enlarge our universe to include the brother or sister, with
his wife or her husband. In this sort of way, so it is contended, we can
be driven on, by the mere force of logic, from any suggested predicate
of the Absolute to the final conclusion of the dialectic, which is
called the ‘Absolute Idea’. Throughout the whole process, there is an
underlying assumption that nothing can be really true unless it is about
Reality as a whole.</p>
<p>For this underlying assumption there is a basis in traditional logic,
which assumes that every proposition has a subject and a predicate.
According to this view, every fact consists in something having some
property. It follows that relations cannot be real, since they involve
two things, not one. ‘Uncle’ is a relation, and a man may become an
uncle without knowing it. In that case, from an empirical point of view,
the man is unaffected by becoming an uncle; he has no quality which he
did not have before, if by ‘quality’ we understand something necessary
to describing him as he is in himself, apart from his relations to other
people and things. The only way in which the subject-predicate logic can
avoid this difficulty is to say that the truth is not a property of the
uncle alone, or of the nephew alone, but of the whole composed of
uncle-and-nephew. Since everything, except the Whole, has relations to
outside things, it follows that nothing quite true can be said about
separate things, and that in fact only the Whole is real. This follows
more directly from the fact that ‘A and B are two’ is not a
subject-predicate proposition, and therefore, on the basis of the
traditional logic, there can be no such proposition. Therefore there are
not as many as two things in the world; therefore the Whole, considered
as a unity, is alone real.</p>
<p>The above argument is not explicit in Hegel, but is implicit in his
system, as in that of many other metaphysicians.</p>
<p>A few examples of Hegel’s dialectic method may serve to make it more
intelligible. He begins the argument of his logic by the assumption that
‘the Absolute is Pure Being’; we assume that it just is, without
assigning any qualities to it. But pure being without any qualities is
nothing; therefore we are led to the antithesis: ‘The Absolute is
Nothing’. From this thesis and antithesis we pass on to the synthesis:
the union of Being and Not-Being is Becoming, and so we say: ‘The
Absolute is Becoming.’ This also, of course, won’t do, because there has
to be something that becomes. In this way our views of Reality develop
by the continual correction of previous errors, all of which arose from
undue abstraction, by taking something finite or limited as if it could
be the whole. ‘The limitations of the finite do not come merely from
without; its own nature is the cause of its abrogation, and by its own
act it passes into its counterpart.’</p>
<p>The process, according to Hegel, is essential to the understanding of
the result. Each later stage of the dialectic contains all the earlier
stages, as it were in solution; none of them is wholly superseded, but
is given its proper place as a moment in the Whole. It is therefore
impossible to reach the truth except by going through all the steps of
the dialectic.</p>
<p>Knowledge as a whole has its triadic movement. It begins with
sense-perception, in which there is only awareness of the object. Then,
through sceptical criticism of the senses, it becomes purely subjective.
At last, it reaches the stage of self-knowledge, in which subject and
object are no longer distinct. Thus self-consciousness is the highest
form of knowledge. This, of course, must be the case in Hegel’s system,
for the highest kind of knowledge must be that possessed by the
Absolute, and as the Absolute is the Whole there is nothing outside
itself for it to know.</p>
<p>In the best thinking, according to Hegel, thoughts become fluent and
interfuse. Truth and falsehood are not sharply defined opposites, as is
commonly supposed; nothing is wholly false, and nothing that we can know
is wholly true. ‘We can know in a way that is false’; this happens when
we attribute absolute truth to some detached piece of information. Such
a question as ‘Where was Caesar born?’ has a straightforward answer,
which is true in a sense, but not in the philosophical sense. For
philosophy, ‘the truth is the whole’, and nothing partial is quite
true.</p>
<p>‘Reason,’ Hegel says, ‘is the conscious certainty of being all
reality.’ This does not mean that a separate person is all reality; in
his separateness he is not quite real, but what is real in him is his
participation in Reality as a whole. In proportion as we become more
rational, this participation is increased.</p>
<p>The Absolute Idea, with which the Logic ends, is something like
Aristotle’s God. It is thought thinking about itself. Clearly the
Absolute cannot think about anything but itself, since there is nothing
else, except to our partial and erroneous ways of apprehending Reality.
We are told that Spirit is the only reality, and that its thought is
reflected into itself by self-consciousness. The actual words in which
the Absolute Idea is defined are very obscure. Wallace translates them
as follows:</p>
<p>‘The Absolute Idea. The idea, as unity of the Subjective and
Objective Idea, is the notion of the Idea—a notion whose object
(Gegenstand) is the Idea as such, and for which the objective (Objekt)
is Idea—an Object which embraces all characteristics in its unity.’</p>
<p>The original German is even more difficult.1 The essence of the
matter is, however, somewhat less complicated than Hegel makes it seem.
The Absolute Idea is pure thought thinking about pure thought. This is
all that God does throughout the ages—truly a Professor’s God. Hegel
goes on to say: ‘This unity is consequently the absolute and all truth,
the Idea which thinks itself.’</p>
<p>I come now to a singular feature of Hegel’s philosophy, which
distinguishes it from the philosophy of Plato or Plotinus or Spinoza.
Although ultimate reality is timeless, and time is merely an illusion
generated by our inability to see the Whole, yet the time-process has an
intimate relation to the purely logical process of the dialectic. World
history, in fact, has advanced through the categories, from Pure Being
in China (of which Hegel knew nothing except that it was) to the
Absolute Idea, which seems to have been nearly, if not quite, realized
in the Prussian State. I cannot see any justification, on the basis of
his own metaphysic, for the view that world history repeats the
transitions of the dialectic, yet that is the thesis which he developed
in his Philosophy of History. It was an interesting thesis, giving unity
and meaning to the revolutions of human affairs. Like other historical
theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion
of facts and considerable ignorance. Hegel, like Marx and Spengler after
him, possessed both these qualifications. It is odd that a process which
is represented as cosmic should all have taken place on our planet, and
most of it near the Mediterranean. Nor is there any reason, if reality
is timeless, why the later parts of the process should embody higher
categories than the earlier parts—unless one were to adopt the
blasphemous supposition that the Universe was gradually learning Hegel’s
philosophy.</p>
<p>The time-process, according to Hegel, is from the less to the more
perfect, both in an ethical and in a logical sense. Indeed these two
senses are, for him, not really distinguishable, for logical perfection
consists in being a closely-knit whole, without ragged edges, without
independent parts, but united, like a human body, or still more like a
reasonable mind, into an organism whose parts are interdependent and all
work together towards a single end;</p>
<p>and this also constitutes ethical perfection. A few quotations will
illustrate Hegel’s theory:</p>
<p>‘Like the soul-conductor Mercury, the Idea is, in truth, the leader
of peoples and of the world; and Spirit, the rational and necessitated
will of that conductor, is and has been the director of the events of
the world’s history. To become acquainted with Spirit in this its office
of guidance, is the object of our present undertaking.’</p>
<p>‘The only thought which philosophy brings with it to the
contemplation of history is the simple conception of Reason; that Reason
is the sovereign of the world; that the history of the world, therefore,
presents us with a rational process. This conviction and intuition is a
hypothesis in the domain of history as such. In that of philosophy it is
no hypothesis. It is there proved by speculative cognition, that
Reason—and this term may here suffice us, without investigating the
relation sustained by the universe to the Divine Being—is Substance, as
well as Infinite Power; its own infinite material underlying all the
natural and spiritual life which it originates, as also the Infinite
Form, that which sets the material in motion. Reason is the substance of
the universe.’</p>
<p>‘That this “Idea“ or “Reason“ is the True, the Eternal, the
absolutely powerful essence; that it reveals itself in the world, and
that in that world nothing else is revealed but this and its honour and
glory—is the thesis which, as we have said, has been proved in
philosophy, and is here regarded as demonstrated.’</p>
<p>‘The world of intelligence and conscious volition is not abandoned to
chance, but must show itself in the light of the self-cognizant
Idea.’</p>
<p>This is ‘a result which happens to be known to me, because I have
traversed the entire field’.</p>
<p>All these quotations are from the introduction to The Philosophy of
History.</p>
<p>‘Spirit, and the course of its development, is the substantial object
of the philosophy of history. The nature of Spirit may be understood by
contrasting it with its opposite, namely Matter. The essence of matter
is gravity; the essence of Spirit is Freedom. Matter is outside itself,
whereas Spirit has its centre in itself. Spirit is self-contained
existence.’ If this is not clear, the following definition may be found
more illuminating:</p>
<p>‘But what is Spirit? It is the one immutably homogeneous
Infinite—pure Identity—which in its second phase separates itself from
itself and makes this second aspect its own polar opposite, namely as
existence for and in Self as contrasted with the Universal.’</p>
<p>In the historical development of Spirit there have been three main
phases: The Orientals, the Greeks and Romans, and the Germans. ‘The
history of the world is the discipline of the uncontrolled natural will,
bringing it into obedience to a universal principle and conferring
subjective freedom. The East knew, and to the present day knows, only
that One is free; the Greek and Roman world, that some are free; the
German world knows that All are free.’ One might have supposed that
democracy would be the appropriate form of government where all are
free, but not so. Democracy and aristocracy alike belong to the stage
where some are free, despotism to that where one is free, and monarchy
to that in which all are free. This is connected with the very odd sense
in which Hegel uses the word ‘freedom’. For him (and so far we may
agree) there is no freedom without law; but he tends to convert this,
and to argue that wherever there is law there is freedom. Thus
‘freedom’, for him, means little more than the right to obey the
law.</p>
<p>As might be expected, he assigns the highest role to the Germans in
the terrestrial development of Spirit. ‘The German spirit is the spirit
of the new world. Its aim is the realization of absolute Truth as the
unlimited self-determination of freedom—that freedom which has its own
absolute form itself as its purport.’</p>
<p>This is a very superfine brand of freedom. It does not mean that you
will be able to keep out of a concentration camp. It does not imply
democracy, or a free press,2 or any of the usual Liberal watchwords,
which Hegel rejects with contempt. When Spirit gives laws to itself, it
does so freely. To our mundane vision, it may seem that the Spirit that
gives laws is embodied in the monarch, and the Spirit to which laws are
given is embodied in his subjects. But from the point of view of the
Absolute the distinction between monarch and subjects, like all other
distinctions, is illusory, and when the monarch imprisons a
liberal-minded subject, that is still Spirit freely determining itself.
Hegel praises Rousseau for distinguishing between the general will and
the will of all. One gathers that the monarch embodies the general will,
whereas a parliamentary majority only embodies the will of all. A very
convenient doctrine.</p>
<p>German history is divided by Hegel into three periods: the first, up
to Charlemagne; the second, from Charlemagne to the Reformation; the
third, from the Reformation onwards. These three periods are
distinguished as the Kingdoms of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, respectively. It seems a little odd that the Kingdom of the Holy
Ghost should have begun with the bloody and utterly abominable
atrocities committed in suppressing the Peasants’ War, but Hegel,
naturally, does not mention so trivial an incident. Instead, he goes
off, as might be expected, into praises of Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Hegel’s interpretation of history since the fall of the Roman Empire
is partly the effect, and partly the cause, of the teaching of world
history in German schools. In Italy and France, while there has been a
romantic admiration of the Germans on the part of a few men such as
Tacitus and Machiavelli, they have been viewed, in general, as the
authors of the</p>
<p>‘barbarian’ invasion, and as enemies of the Church, first under the
great Emperors, and later as the leaders of the Reformation. Until the
nineteenth century the Latin nations looked upon the Germans as their
inferiors in civilization. Protestants in Germany naturally took a
different view. They regarded the late Romans as effete, and considered
the German conquest of the Western Empire an essential step towards
revivification. In relation to the conflict of Empire and Papacy in the
Middle Ages, they took a Ghibelline view: to this day, German schoolboys
are taught a boundless admiration of Charlemagne and Barbarossa. In the
times after the Reformation, the political weakness and disunity of
Germany was deplored, and the gradual rise of Prussia was welcomed as
making Germany strong under Protestant leadership, not under the
Catholic and somewhat feeble leadership of Austria. Hegel, in
philosophizing about history, has in mind such men as Theodoric,
Charlemagne, Barbarossa, Luther, and Frederick the Great. He is to be
interpreted in the light of their exploits, and in the light of the then
recent humiliation of Germany by Napoleon.</p>
<p>So much is Germany glorified that one might expect to find it the
final embodiment of the Absolute Idea, beyond which no further
development would be possible. But this is not Hegel’s view. On the
contrary, he says that America is the land of the future, ‘where, in the
ages that lie before us, the burden of the world’s history shall reveal
itself—perhaps [he adds characteristically] in a contest between North
and South America’. He seems to think that everything important takes
the form of war. If it were suggested to him that the contribution of
America to world history might be the development of a society without
extreme poverty, he would not be interested. On the contrary, he says
that, as yet, there is no real State in America, because a real State
requires a division of classes into rich and poor.</p>
<p>Nations, in Hegel, play the part that classes play in Marx. The
principle of historical development, he says, is national genius. In
every age, there is some one nation which is charged with the mission of
carrying the world through the stage of the dialectic that it has
reached. In our age, of course, this nation is Germany. But in addition
to nations, we must also take account of world-historical individuals;
these are men in whose aims are embodied the dialectical transitions
that are due to take place in their time. These men are heroes, and may
justifiably contravene ordinary moral rules. Alexander, Caesar, and
Napoleon are given as examples. I doubt whether, in Hegel’s opinion, a
man could be a ‘hero’ without being a military conqueror.</p>
<p>Hegel’s emphasis on nations, together with his peculiar conception of
‘freedom’, explains his glorification of the State—a very important
aspect of his political philosophy, to which we must now turn our
attention. His philosophy of the State is developed both in his
Philosophy of History and in his Philosophy of Law. It is in the main
compatible with his general metaphysic, but vnot necessitated by it; at
certain points, however—e.g., as regards the relations between
States—his admiration of the national State is carried so far as to
become inconsistent with his general preference of wholes to parts.</p>
<p>Glorification of the State begins, so far as modern times are
concerned, with the Reformation. In the Roman Empire, the Emperor was
deified, and the State thereby acquired a sacred character; but the
philosophers of the Middle Ages, with few exceptions, were
ecclesiastics, and therefore put the Church above the State. Luther,
finding support in Protestant princes, began the opposite practice; the
Lutheran Church, on the whole, was Erastian. Hobbes, who was politically
a Protestant, developed the doctrine of the supremacy of the State, and
Spinoza, on the whole, agreed with him. Rousseau, as we have seen,
thought the State should not tolerate other political organizations.
Hegel was vehemently Protestant, of the Lutheran section; the Prussian
State was an Erastian absolute monarchy. These reasons would make one
expect to find the State highly valued by Hegel, but, even so, he goes
to lengths which are astonishing.</p>
<p>We are told in The Philosophy of History that ‘the State is the
actually existing realized moral life’, and that all the spiritual
reality possessed by a human being he possesses only through the State.
‘For his spiritual reality consists in this, that his own
essence—Reason—is objectively present to him, that it possesses
objective immediate existence for him…. For truth is the unity of the
universal and subjective Will, and the universal is to be found in the
State, in its laws, its universal and rational arrangements. The State
is the Divine Idea as it exists on earth.’ Again: ‘The State is the
embodiment of rational freedom, realizing and recognizing itself in an
objective form…. The State is the Idea of Spirit in the external
manifestation of human Will and its Freedom.’</p>
<p>The Philosophy of Law, in the section on the State, develops the same
doctrine somewhat more fully. ‘The State is the reality of the moral
idea—the moral spirit, as the visible substantial will, evident to
itself, which thinks and knows itself, and fulfils what it knows in so
far as it knows it.’ The State is the rational in and for itself. If the
State existed only for the interests of individuals (as Liberals
contend), an individual might or might not be a member of the State. It
has, however, a quite different relation to the individual: since it is
objective Spirit, the individual only has objectivity, truth, and
morality in so far as he is a member of the State, whose true content
and purpose is union as such. It is admitted that there may be bad
States, but these merely exist, and have no true reality, whereas a
rational State is infinite in itself.</p>
<p>It will be seen that Hegel claims for the State much the same
position as St Augustine and his Catholic successors claimed for the
Church. There are, however, two respects in which the Catholic claim is
more reasonable than Hegel’s. In the first place, the Church is not a
chance geographical association, but a body united by a common creed,
believed by its members to be of supreme importance; it is thus in its
very essence the embodiment of what Hegel calls the ‘Idea’. In the
second place, there is only one Catholic Church, whereas there are many
States. When each State, in relation to its subjects, is made as
absolute as Hegel makes it, there is difficulty in finding any
philosophical principle by which to regulate the relations between
different States. In fact, at this point Hegel abandons his
philosophical talk, falling back on the state of nature and Hobbes’s war
of all against all.</p>
<p>The habit of speaking of ‘the State’, as if there were only one, is
misleading so long as there is no world State. Duty being, for Hegel,
solely a relation of the individual to his State, no principle is left
by which to moralize the relations between States. This Hegel
recognizes. In external relations, he says, the State is an individual,
and each State is independent as against the others. ‘Since in this
independence the being-for-self of real spirit has its existence, it is
the first freedom and highest honour of a people.’ He goes on to argue
against any sort of League of Nations by which the independence of
separate States might be limited. The duty of a citizen is entirely
confined (so far as the external relations of his State are concerned)
to upholding the substantial individuality and independence and
sovereignty of his own State. It follows that war is not wholly an evil,
or something that we should seek to abolish. The purpose of the State is
not merely to uphold the life and property of the citizens, and this
fact provides the moral justification of war, which is not to be
regarded as an absolute evil or as accidental, or as having its cause in
something that ought not to be.</p>
<p>Hegel does not mean only that, in some situations, a nation cannot
rightly avoid going to war. He means much more than this. He is opposed
to the creation of institutions—such as a world government—which would
prevent such situations from arising, because he thinks it a good thing
that there should be wars from time to time. War, he says, is the
condition in which we take seriously the vanity of temporal goods and
things. (This view is to be contrasted with the opposite theory, that
all wars have economic causes.) War has a positive moral value. ‘War has
the higher significance that through it the moral health of peoples is
preserved in their indifference towards the stabilizing of finite
determinations.’ Peace is ossification; the Holy Alliance, and Kant’s
League for Peace, are mistaken, because a family of States needs an
enemy. Conflicts of States can only be decided by war; States being
towards each other in a state of nature, their relations are not legal
or moral. Their rights have their reality in their particular wills, and
the interest of each State is its own highest law. There is no contrast
of morals and politics, because States are not subject to ordinary moral
laws.</p>
<p>Such is Hegel’s doctrine of the State—a doctrine which, if accepted,
justifies every internal tyranny and every external aggression that can
possibly be imagined. The strength of his bias appears in the fact that
his theory is largely inconsistent with his own metaphysic, and that the
inconsistencies are all such as tend to the justification of cruelty and
international brigandage. A man may be pardoned if logic compels him
regretfully to reach conclusions which he deplores, but not for
departing from logic in order to be free to advocate crimes. Hegel’s
logic led him to believe that there is more reality or excellence (the
two for him are synonyms) in wholes than in their parts, and that a
whole increases in reality and excellence as it becomes more organized.
This justified him in preferring a State to an anarchic collection of
individuals, but it should equally have led him to prefer a world State
to an anarchic collection of States. Within the State, his general
philosophy should have led him to feel more respect for the individual
than he did feel, for the wholes of which his Logic treats are not like
the One of Parmenides, or even like Spinoza’s God; they are wholes in
which the individual does not disappear, but acquires fuller reality
through his harmonious relation to a larger organism. A State in which
the individual is ignored is not a small-scale model of the Hegelian
Absolute.</p>
<p>Nor is there any good reason, in Hegel’s metaphysic, for the
exclusive emphasis on the State, as opposed to other social
organizations. I can see nothing but Protestant bias in his preference
of the State to the Church. Moreover, if it is good that society should
be as organic as possible, as Hegel believes, then many social
organizations are necessary, in addition to the State and the Church. It
should follow from Hegel’s principles that every interest which is not
harmful to the community, and which can be promoted by co-operation,
should have its appropriate organization, and that every such
organization should have its quota of limited independence. It may be
objected that ultimate authority must reside somewhere, and cannot
reside elsewhere than in the State. But even so it may be desirable that
this ultimate authority should not be irresistible when it attempts to
be oppressive beyond a point.</p>
<p>This brings us to a question which is fundamental in judging Hegel’s
whole philosophy. Is there more reality, and is there more value, in a
whole than in its parts? Hegel answers both questions in the
affirmative. The question of reality is metaphysical, the question of
value is ethical. They are commonly treated as if they were scarcely
distinguishable, but to my mind it is important to keep them apart. Let
us begin with the metaphysical question.</p>
<p>The view of Hegel, and of many other philosophers, is that the
character of any portion of the universe is so profoundly affected by
its relations to the other parts and to the whole, that no true
statement can be made about any part except to assign it its place in
the whole. Since its place in the whole depends upon all the other
parts, a true statement about its place in the whole will at the same
time assign the place of every other part in the whole. Thus there can
be only one true statement; there is no truth except the whole truth.
And similarly nothing is quite real except the whole, for any part, when
isolated, is changed in character by being isolated, and therefore no
longer appears quite what it truly is. On the other hand, when a part is
viewed in relation to the whole, as it should be, it is seen to be not
self-subsistent, and to be incapable of existing except as part of just
that whole which alone is truly real. This is the metaphysical
doctrine.</p>
<p>The ethical doctrine, which maintains that value resides in the whole
rather than in the parts, must be true if the metaphysical doctrine is
true, but need not be false if the metaphysical doctrine is false. It
may, moreover, be true of some wholes and not of others. It is obviously
true, in some sense, of a living body. The eye is worthless when
separated from the body; a collection of disjecta membra, even when
complete, has not the value that once belonged to the body from which
they were taken. Hegel conceives the ethical relation of the citizen to
the State as analogous to that of the eye to the body: in his place the
citizen is part of a valuable whole, but isolated he is as useless as an
isolated eye. The analogy, however, is open to question; from the
ethical importance of some wholes, that of all wholes does not
follow.</p>
<p>The above statement of the ethical problem is defective in one
important respect, namely, that it does not take account of the
distinction between ends and means. An eye in a living body is useful,
that is to say, it has value as a means; but it has no more intrinsic
value than when detached from the body. A thing has intrinsic value when
it is prized for its own sake, not as a means to something else. We
value the eye as a means of seeing. Seeing may be a means or an end; it
is a means when it shows us food or enemies, it is an end when it shows
us something that we find beautiful. The State is obviously valuable as
a means: it protects us against thieves and murderers, it provides roads
and schools, and so on. It may, of course, also be bad as a means, for
example by waging an unjust war. The real question we have to ask in
connection with Hegel is not this, but whether the State is good per se,
as an end: do the citizens exist for the sake of the State, or the State
for the sake of the citizens? Hegel holds the former view; the liberal
philosophy that comes from Locke holds the latter. It is clear that we
shall only attribute intrinsic value to the State if we think of it as
having a life of its own, as being in some sense a person. At this
point, Hegel’s metaphysic becomes relevant to the question of value. A
person is a complex whole, having a single life; can there be a
super-person, composed of persons as the body is composed of organs, and
having a single life which is not the sum of the lives of the component
persons? If there can be such a super-person, as Hegel thinks, then the
State may be such a being, and it may be as superior to ourselves as the
whole body is to the eye. But if we think this super-person a mere
metaphysical monstrosity, then we shall say that the intrinsic value of
a community is derived from that of its members, and that the State is a
means, not an end. We are thus brought back from vthe ethical to the
metaphysical question. The metaphysical question itself, we shall find,
is really a question of logic.</p>
<p>The question at issue is much wider than the truth or falsehood of
Hegel’s philosophy; it is the question that divides the friends of
analysis from its enemies. Let us take an illustration. Suppose I say
‘John is the father of James.’ Hegel, and all who believe in what
Marshal Smuts calls ‘holism’, will say: ‘Before you can understand this
statement, you must know who John and James are. Now to know who John
is, is to know all his characteristics, for apart from them he would not
be distinguishable from any one else. But all his characteristics
involve other people or things. He is characterized by his relations to
his parents, his wife, and his children, by whether he is a good or a
bad citizen, and by the country to which he belongs. All these things
you must know before you can be said to know whom the word “John“ refers
to. Step by step, in your endeavour to say what you mean by the word
“John“, you will be led to take account of the whole universe, and your
original statement will turn out to be telling you something about the
universe, not about two separate people, John and James.’</p>
<p>Now this is all very well, but it is open to an initial objection. If
the above argument were sound, how could knowledge ever begin? I know
numbers of propositions of the form ‘A is the father of B’, but I do not
know the whole universe. If all knowledge were knowledge of the universe
as a whole, there would be no knowledge. This is enough to make us
suspect a mistake somewhere.</p>
<p>The fact is that, in order to use the word ‘John’ correctly and
intelligently, I do not need to know all about John, but only enough to
recognize him. No doubt he has relations, near or remote, to everything
in the universe, but he can be spoken of truly without taking them into
account, except such as are the direct subject-matter of what is being
said. He may be the father of Jemima as well as of James, but it is not
necessary for me to know this in order to know that he is the father of
James. If Hegel were right, we could not state fully what is meant by
‘John is the father of James’ without mentioning Jemima: we ought to say
‘John, the father of Jemima, is the father of James.’ This would still
be inadequate; we should have to go on to mention his parents and
grandparents, and a whole Who’s Who. But this lands us in absurdities.
The Hegelian position might be stated as follows: ‘The word “John“ means
all that is true of John.’ But as a definition this is circular, since
the word ‘John’ occurs in the defining phrase. In fact, if Hegel were
right, no word could begin to have a meaning, since we should need to
know already the meanings of all other words in order to state all the
properties of what the word designates, which, according to the theory,
are what the word means.</p>
<p>To put the matter abstractly: we must distinguish properties of
different kinds. A thing may have a property not involving any other
thing; this sort is called a quality. Or it may have a property
involving one other thing; such a property is being married. Or it may
have one involving two other things, such as being a brother-in-law. If
a certain thing has a certain collection of qualities, and no other
thing has just this collection of qualities, then it can be defined as
‘the thing having such-and-such qualities’. From its having these
qualities, nothing can be deduced by pure logic as to its relational
properties. Hegel thought that, if enough was known about a thing to
distinguish it from all other things, then all its properties could be
inferred by logic. This was a mistake, and from this mistake arose the
whole imposing edifice of his system. This illustrates an important
truth, namely, that the worse your logic, the more interesting the
consequences to which it gives rise.</p>
