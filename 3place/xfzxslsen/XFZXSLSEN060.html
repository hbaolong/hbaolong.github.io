<h4 id="philosophical-liberalism">12 PHILOSOPHICAL LIBERALISM</h4>
<p>The rise of liberalism, in politics and philosophy, provides material
for the study of a very general and very important question, namely:
What has been the influence of political and social circumstances upon
the thoughts of eminent and original thinkers, and, conversely, what has
been the influence of these men upon subsequent political and social
developments?</p>
<p>Two opposite errors, both common, are to be guarded against. On the
one hand, men who are more familiar with books than with affairs are apt
to over-estimate the influence of philosophers. When they see some
political party proclaiming itself inspired by So-and-So’s teaching,
they think its actions are attributable to So-and-So, whereas, not
infrequently, the philosopher is only acclaimed because he recommends
what the party would have done in any case. Writers of books, until
recently, almost all exaggerated the effects of their predecessors in
the same trade. But conversely, a new error has arisen by reaction
against the old one, and this new error consists in regarding theorists
as almost passive products of their circumstances, and as having hardly
any influence at all upon the course of events. Ideas, according to this
view, are the froth on the surface of deep currents, which are
determined by material and technical causes: social changes are no more
caused by thought than the flow of a river is caused by the bubbles that
reveal its direction to an onlooker. For my part, I believe that the
truth lies between these two extremes. Between ideas and practical life,
as everywhere else, there is reciprocal interaction; to ask which is
cause and which effect is as futile as the problem of the hen and the
egg. I shall not waste time upon a discussion of this question in the
abstract, but shall consider historically one important case of the
general question, namely the development of liberalism and its offshoots
from the end of the seventeenth century to the present day.</p>
<p>Early liberalism was a product of England and Holland, and had
certain well-marked characteristics. It stood for religious toleration;
it was Protestant, but of a latitudinarian rather than of a fanatical
kind; it regarded the wars of religion as silly. It valued commerce and
industry, and favoured the rising middle class rather than the monarchy
and the aristocracy; it had immense respect for the rights of property,
especially when accumulated by the labours of the individual possessor.
The hereditary principle, though not rejected, was restricted in scope
more than it had previously been; in particular, the divine right of
kings was rejected in favour of the view that every community has a
right, at any rate initially, to choose its own form of government.
Implicitly, the tendency of early liberalism was towards democracy
tempered by the rights of property. There was a belief—not at first
wholly explicit—that all men are born equal, and that their subsequent
inequality is a product of circumstances. This led to a great emphasis
upon the importance of education as opposed to congenital
characteristics. There was a certain bias against government, because
governments almost everywhere were in the hands of kings or
aristocracies, who seldom either understood or respected the needs of
merchants, but this bias was held in check by the hope that the
necessary understanding and respect would be won before long.</p>
<p>Early liberalism was optimistic, energetic, and philosophic, because
it represented growing forces which appeared likely to become victorious
without great difficulty, and to bring by their victory great benefits
to mankind. It was opposed to everything medieval, both in philosophy
and in politics, because medieval theories had been used to sanction the
powers of Church and king, to justify persecution, and to obstruct the
rise of science; but it was opposed equally to the then modern
fanaticisms of Calvinists and Anabaptists. It wanted an end to political
and theological strife, in order to liberate energies for the exciting
enterprises of commerce and science, such as the East India Company and
the Bank of England, the theory of gravitation and the discovery of the
circulation of the blood. Throughout the Western world bigotry was
giving place to enlightenment, the fear of Spanish power was ending, all
classes were increasing in prosperity, and the highest hopes appeared to
be warranted by the most sober judgment. For a hundred years, nothing
occurred to dim these hopes; then, at last, they themselves generated
the French Revolution, which led directly to Napoleon and thence to the
Holy Alliance. After these events, liberalism had to acquire its second
wind before the renewed optimism of the nineteenth century became
possible.</p>
<p>Before embarking upon any detail, it will be well to consider the
general pattern of the liberal movements from the seventeenth to the
nineteenth century. This pattern is at first simple, but grows gradually
more and more complex. The distinctive character of the whole movement
is, in a certain wide sense, individualism; but this is a vague term
until further defined. The philosophers of Greece, down to and including
Aristotle, were not individualists in the sense in which I wish to use
the term. They thought of a man as essentially a member of a community;
Plato’s Republic, for example, is concerned to define the good
community, not the good individual. With the loss of political liberty
from the time of Alexander onwards, individualism developed, and was
represented by the Cynics and Stoics. According to the Stoic philosophy,
a man could live a good life in no matter what social circumstances.
This was also the view of Christianity, especially before it acquired
control of the State. But in the Middle Ages, while mystics kept alive
the original individualistic trends in Christian ethics, the outlook of
most men, including the majority of philosophers, was dominated by a
firm synthesis of dogma, law, and custom, which caused men’s theoretical
beliefs and practical morality to be controlled by a social institution,
namely the Catholic Church: what was true and what was good was to be
ascertained, not by solitary thought, but by the collective wisdom of
Councils.</p>
<p>The first important breach in this system was made by Protestantism,
which asserted that General Councils may err. To determine the truth
thus became no longer a social but an individual enterprise. Since
different individuals reached different conclusions, the result was
strife, and theological decisions were sought, no longer in assemblies
of bishops, but on the battlefield. Since neither party was able to
extirpate the other, it became evident, in the end, that a method must
be found of reconciling intellectual and ethical individualism with
ordered social life. This was one of the main problems which early
liberalism attempted to solve.</p>
<p>Meanwhile individualism had penetrated into philosophy. Descartes’
fundamental certainty, ‘I think, therefore I am’, made the basis of
knowledge different for each person, since for each the starting-point
was his own existence, not that of other individuals or of the
community. His emphasis upon the reliability of clear and distinct ideas
tended in the same direction, since it is by introspection that we think
we discover whether our ideas are clear and distinct. Most philosophy
since Descartes has had this intellectually individualistic aspect in a
greater or less degree.</p>
<p>There are, however, various forms of this general position, which
have, in practice, very different consequences. The outlook of the
typical scientific discoverer has perhaps the smallest dose of
individualism. When he arrives at a new theory, he does so solely
because it seems right to him; he does not bow to authority, for, if he
did, he would continue to accept the theories of his predecessors. At
the same time, his appeal is to generally received canons of truth, and
he hopes to persuade other men, not by his authority, but by arguments
which are convincing to them as individuals. In science, any clash
between the individual and society is in essence transitory, since men
of science, broadly speaking, all accept the same intellectual
standards, and therefore debate and investigation usually produce
agreement in the end. This, however, is a modern development; in the
time of Galileo, the authority of Aristotle and the Church was still
considered at least as cogent as the evidence of the senses. This shows
how the element of individualism in scientific method, though not
prominent, is nevertheless essential.</p>
<p>Early liberalism was individualistic in intellectual matters, and
also in economics, but was not emotionally or ethically self-assertive.
This form of liberalism dominated the English eighteenth century, the
founders of the American Constitution, and the French encyclopaedists.
During the French Revolution, it was represented by the more moderate
parties, including the Girondins, but with their extermination it
disappeared for a generation from French politics. In England, after the
Napoleonic wars, it again became influential with the rise of the
Benthamites and the Manchester School. Its greatest success has been in
America, where, unhampered by feudalism and a State Church, it has been
dominant from 1776 to the present day, or at any rate to 1933.</p>
<p>A new movement, which has gradually developed into the antithesis of
liberalism, begins with Rousseau, and acquires strength from the
romantic movement and the principle of nationality. In this movement,
individualism is extended from the intellectual sphere to that of the
passions, and the anarchic aspects of individualism are made explicit.
The cult of the hero, as developed by Carlyle and Nietzsche, is typical
of this philosophy. Various elements were combined in it. There was
dislike of early industrialism, hatred of the ugliness that it produced,
and revulsion against its cruelties. There was a nostalgia for the
Middle Ages, which were idealized owing to hatred of the modern world.
There was an attempt to combine championship of the fading privileges of
Church and aristocracy with defence of wage-earners against the tyranny
of manufacturers. There was vehement assertion of the right of rebellion
in the name of nationalism, and of the splendour of war in defence of
‘liberty’. Byron was the poet of this movement; Fichte, Carlyle, and
Nietzsche were its philosophers.</p>
<p>But since we cannot all have the career of heroic leaders, and cannot
all make our individual will prevail, this philosophy, like all other
forms of anarchism, inevitably leads, when adopted, to the despotic
government of the most successful ‘hero’. And when his tyranny is
established, he will suppress in others the self-assertive ethic by
which he has risen to power. This whole theory of life, therefore, is
self-refuting, in the sense that its adoption in practice leads to the
realization of something utterly different: a dictatorial State in which
the individual is severely repressed.</p>
<p>There is yet another philosophy which, in the main, is an offshoot of
liberalism, namely that of Marx. I shall consider him at a later stage,
but for the moment he is merely to be borne in mind.</p>
<p>The first comprehensive statement of the liberal philosophy is to be
found in Locke, the most influential though by no means the most
profound of modern philosophers. In England, his views were so
completely in harmony with those of most intelligent men that it is
difficult to trace their influence except in theoretical philosophy; in
France, on the other hand, where they led to an opposition to the
existing regime in practice and to the prevailing Cartesianism in
theory, they clearly had a considerable effect in shaping the course of
events. This is an example of a general principle: a philosophy
developed in a politically and economically advanced country, which is,
in its birthplace, little more than a clarification and systemization of
prevalent opinion, may become elsewhere a source of revolutionary
ardour, and ultimately of actual revolution. It is mainly through
theorists that the maxims regulating the policy of advanced countries
become known to less advanced countries. In the advanced countries,
practice inspires theory; in the others, theory inspires practice. This
difference is one of the reasons why transplanted ideas are seldom so
successful as they were in their native soil.</p>
<p>Before considering the philosophy of Locke, let us review some of the
circumstances in seventeenth-century England that were influential in
forming his opinions.</p>
<p>The conflict between King and Parliament in the Civil War gave
Englishmen, once for all, a love of compromise and moderation, and a
fear of pushing any theory to its logical conclusion, which has
dominated them down to the present time. The principles for which the
Long Parliament contended had, at first, the support of a large
majority. They wished to abolish the king’s right to grant trade
monopolies, and to make him acknowledge the exclusive right of
Parliament to impose taxes. They desired liberty within the Church of
England for opinions and practices which were persecuted by Archbishop
Laud. They held that Parliament should meet at stated intervals, and
should not be convoked only on rare occasions when the king found its
collaboration indispensable. They objected to arbitrary arrest and to
the subservience of the judges to the royal wishes. But many, while
prepared to agitate for these ends, were not prepared to levy war
against the king, which appeared to them an act of treason and impiety.
As soon as actual war broke out, the division of forces became more
nearly equal.</p>
<p>The political development from the outbreak of the Civil War to the
establishment of Cromwell as Lord Protector followed the course which
has now become familiar but was then unprecedented. The Parliamentary
party consisted of two factions, the Presbyterians and the Independents;
the Presbyterians desired to preserve a State Church, but to abolish
bishops; the Independents agreed with them about bishops, but held that
each congregation should be free to choose its own theology, without the
interference of any central ecclesiastical government. The
Presbyterians, in the main, were of a higher social class than the
Independents, and their political opinions were more moderate. They
wished to come to terms with the king as soon as defeat had made him
conciliatory. Their policy, however, was rendered impossible by two
circumstances: first, the king developed a martyr’s stubbornness about
bishops; second, the defeat of the king proved difficult, and was only
achieved by Cromwell’s New Model Army, which consisted of Independents.
Consequently, when the king’s military resistance was broken, he could
still not be induced to make a treaty, and the Presbyterians had lost
the preponderance of armed force in the Parliamentary armies. The
defence of democracy had thrown power into the hands of a minority, and
it used its power with a complete disregard for democracy and
parliamentary government. When Charles I had attempted to arrest the
five members, there had been a universal outcry, and his failure had
made him ridiculous. But Cromwell had no such difficulties. By Pride’s
Purge, he dismissed about a hundred Presbyterian members, and obtained
for a time a subservient majority. When, finally, he decided to dismiss
Parliament altogether, ‘not a dog barked’—war had made only military
force seem important, and had produced a contempt for constitutional
forms. For the rest of Cromwell’s life, the government of England was a
military tyranny, hated by an increasing majority of the nation, but
impossible to shake off while his partisans alone were armed.</p>
<p>Charles II, after hiding in oak trees and living as a refugee in
Holland, determined, at the Restoration, that he would not again set out
on his travels. This imposed a certain moderation. He claimed no power
to impose taxes not sanctioned by Parliament. He assented to the Habeas
Corpus Act, which deprived the Crown of the power of arbitrary arrest.
On occasion he could flout the fiscal power of Parliament by means of
subsidies from Louis XIV, but in the main he was a constitutional
monarch. Most of the limitations of royal power originally desired by
the opponents of Charles I were conceded at the Restoration, and were
respected by Charles II because it had been shown that kings could be
made to suffer at the hands of their subjects.</p>
<p>James II, unlike his brother, was totally destitute of subtlety and
finesse. By his bigoted Catholicism he united against himself the
Anglicans and Nonconformists, in spite of his attempts to conciliate the
latter by granting them toleration in defiance of Parliament. Foreign
policy also played a part. The Stuarts, in order to avoid the taxation
required in war-time, which would have made them dependent upon
Parliament, pursued a policy of subservience, first to Spain and then to
France. The growing power of France roused the invariable English
hostility to the leading Continental State, and the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes made Protestant feeling bitterly opposed to Louis XIV.
In the end, almost everybody in England wished to be rid of James. But
almost everybody was equally determined to avoid a return to the days of
the Civil War and Cromwell’s dictatorship. Since there was no
constitutional way of getting rid of James, there must be a revolution,
but it must be quickly ended, so as to give no opportunity for
disruptive forces. The rights of Parliament must be secured once for
all. The king must go, but monarchy must be preserved; it should be,
however, not a monarchy of Divine Right, but one dependent upon
legislative sanction, and so upon Parliament. By a combination of
aristocracy and big business, all this was achieved in a moment, without
the necessity of firing a shot. Compromise and moderation had succeeded,
after every form of intransigence had been tried and had failed.</p>
<p>The new king, being Dutch, brought with him the commercial and
theological wisdom for which his country was noted. The Bank of England
was created; the national debt was made into a secure investment, no
longer liable to repudiation at the caprice of the monarch. The Act of
Toleration, while leaving Catholics and Nonconformists subject to
various disabilities, put an end to actual persecution. Foreign policy
became resolutely anti-French, and remained so, with brief
intermissions, until the defeat of Napoleon.</p>
