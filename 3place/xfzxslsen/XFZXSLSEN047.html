<h4 id="franciscan-schoolmen">14 FRANCISCAN SCHOOLMEN</h4>
<p>Franciscans, on the whole, were less impeccably orthodox than
Dominicans. Between the two orders there was keen rivalry, and the
Franciscans were not inclined to accept the authority of St Thomas. The
three most important of Franciscan philosophers were Roger Bacon, Duns
Scotus and William of Occam. St Bonaventura and Matthew of Aquasparta
also call for notice.</p>
<p>Roger Bacon (ca. 1214–ca. 1294) was not greatly admired in his own
day, but in modern times has been praised far beyond his deserts. He was
not so much a philosopher, in the narrow sense, as a man of universal
learning with a passion for mathematics and science. Science, in his
day, was mixed up with alchemy, and thought to be mixed up with black
magic; Bacon was constantly getting into trouble through being suspected
of heresy and magic. In 1257, St Bonaventura, the General of the
Franciscan order, placed him under surveillance in Paris, and forbade
him to publish. Nevertheless, while this prohibition was still in force,
the papal legate in England, Guy de Foulques, commanded him, contrary
orders notwithstanding, to write out his philosophy for the benefit of
the Pope. He therefore produced in a very short time three books, Opus
Majus, Opus Minus, and Opus Tertium. These seem to have produced a good
impression, and in 1268 he was allowed to return to Oxford, from which
he had been removed to a sort of imprisonment in Paris. However, nothing
could teach him caution. He made a practice of contemptuous criticism of
all the most learned of his contemporaries; in particular, he maintained
that the translators from Greek and Arabic were grossly incompetent. In
1271, he wrote a book called Compendium Studii Philosophiae, in which he
attacked clerical ignorance. This did nothing to add to his popularity
among his colleagues, and in 1278 his books were condemned by the
General of the Order, and he was put in prison for fourteen years. In
1292 he was liberated, but died not long afterwards.</p>
<p>He was encyclopaedic in his learning, but not systematic. Unlike most
philosophers of the time, he valued experiment highly, and illustrated
its importance by the theory of the rainbow. He wrote well on geography;
Columbus read this part of his work, and was influenced by it. He was a
good mathematician; he quotes the sixth and ninth books of Euclid. He
treated of perspective, following Arabic sources. Logic he thought a
useless study; alchemy, on the other hand, he valued enough to write on
it.</p>
<p>To give an idea of his scope and method, I will summarize some parts
of the Opus Majus.</p>
<p>There are, he says, four causes of ignorance: First, the example of
frail and unsuited authority. (The work being written for the Pope, he
is careful to say that this does not include the Church.) Second, the
influence of custom. Third, the opinion of the unlearned crowd. (This,
one gathers, includes all his contemporaries except himself.) Fourth,
the concealment of one’s ignorance in a display of apparent wisdom. From
these four plagues, of which the fourth is the worst, spring all human
evils.</p>
<p>In supporting an opinion, it is a mistake to argue from the wisdom of
our ancestors, or from customs, or from common belief. In support of his
view he quotes Seneca, Cicero, Avicenna, Averroes, Adelard of Bath, St
Jerome, and St Chrysostom. These authorities, he seems to think, suffice
to prove that one should not respect authority.</p>
<p>His respect for Aristotle is great, but not unbounded. ‘Only
Aristotle, together with his followers, has been called philosopher in
the judgment of all wise men.’ Like almost all his contemporaries, he
uses the designation, ‘The Philosopher’, when he speaks of Aristotle,
but even the Stagyrite, we are told, did not come to the limit of human
wisdom. After him, Avicenna was ‘the prince and leader of philosophy’,
though he did not fully understand the rainbow, because he did not
recognize its final cause, which, according to Genesis, is the
dissipation of aqueous vapour. (Nevertheless, when Bacon comes to treat
of the rainbow, he quotes Avicenna with great admiration.) Every now and
then he says something that has a flavour of orthodoxy, such as that the
only perfect wisdom is in the Scriptures, as explained by canon law and
philosophy. But he sounds more sincere when he says that there is no
objection to getting knowledge from the heathen; in addition to Avicenna
and Averroes, he quotes Alfarabi1 very often, and Albumazar2 and others
from time to time. Albumazar is quoted to prove that mathematics was
known before the Flood and by Noah and his sons; this, I suppose, is a
sample</p>
<p>of what we may learn from infidels. Bacon praises mathematics as the
sole (unrevealed) source of certitude, and as needed for astronomy and
astrology.</p>
<p>Bacon follows Averroes in holding that the active intellect is a
substance separated from the soul in essence. He quotes various eminent
divines, among them Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, as also supporting
this opinion, which is contrary to that of St Thomas. Apparently
contrary passages in Aristotle, he says, are due to mistranslation. He
does not quote Plato at first hand, but at second hand through Cicero,
or at third hand through the Arabs on Porphyry. Not that he has much
respect for Porphyry, whose doctrine on universals he calls
‘childish’.</p>
<p>In modern times Bacon has been praised because he valued experiment,
as a source of knowledge, more than argument. Certainly his interests
and his way of dealing with subjects are very different from those of
the typical scholastics. His encyclopaedic tendencies are like those of
the Arabic writers, who evidently influenced him more profoundly than
they did most other Christian philosophers. They, like him, were
interested in science, and believed in magic and astrology, whereas
Christians thought magic wicked and astrology a delusion. He is
astonishing because he differs so widely from other medieval Christian
philosophers, but he had little influence in his own time, and was not,
to my mind, so scientific as is sometimes thought. English writers used
to say that he invented gunpowder, but this, of course, is untrue.</p>
<p>St Bonaventura (1221–1274), who, as General of the Franciscan order,
forbade Bacon to publish, was a man of a totally different kind. He
belonged to the tradition of St Anselm, whose ontological argument he
upheld. He saw in the new Aristotelianism a fundamental opposition to
Christianity. He believed in Platonic ideas, which, however, only God
knows perfectly. In his writings Augustine is quoted constantly, but one
finds no quotations from Arabs, and few from pagan antiquity.</p>
<p>Matthew of Aquasparta (ca. 1235–1302) was a follower of Bonaventura,
but less untouched by the new philosophy. He was a Franciscan, and
became a cardinal; he opposed St Thomas from an Augustinian point of
view. But to him Aristotle has become ‘The Philosopher’; he is quoted
constantly. Avicenna is frequently mentioned; St Anselm is quoted with
respect, as is the pseudo-Dionysius; but the chief authority is St
Augustine. We must, he says, find a middle way between Plato and
Aristotle. Plato’s ideas are ‘utterly erroneous’; they establish wisdom,
but not knowledge. On the other hand, Aristotle is also wrong; he
establishes knowledge, but not wisdom. Our knowledge—so it is
concluded—is caused by both lower and higher things, by external objects
and ideal reasons.</p>
<p>Duns Scotus (ca. 1270–1308) carried on the Franciscan controversy
with Aquinas. He was born in Scotland or Ulster, became a Franciscan at
Oxford, and spent his later years at Paris. Against St Thomas, he
defended the Immacu late Conception, and in this the University of
Paris, and ultimately the whole Catholic Church, agreed with him. He is
Augustinian, but in a less extreme form than Bonaventura, or even
Matthew of Aquasparta; his differences from St Thomas, like theirs, come
of a larger admixture of Platonism (via Augustine) in his
philosophy.</p>
<p>He discusses, for example, the question ‘Whether any sure and pure
truth can be known naturally by the understanding of the wayfarer
without the special illumination of the uncreated light?’ And he argues
that it cannot. He supports this view, in his opening argument, solely
by quotations from St Augustine; the only difficulty he finds in Romans
i, 20: ‘The invisible things of God, understood by means of those things
that have been made, are clearly comprehended from the creation of the
world.’</p>
<p>Duns Scotus was a moderate realist. He believed in free will and had
leanings towards Pelagianism. He held that being is no different from
essence. He was mainly interested in evidence, i.e. the kinds of things
that can be known without proof. Of these there are three kinds: (1)
principles known by themselves, (2) things known by experience, (3) our
own actions. But without divine illumination we can know nothing.</p>
<p>Most Franciscans followed Duns Scotus rather than Aquinas.</p>
<p>Duns Scotus held that, since there is no difference between being and
essence, the ‘principle of individuation’—i.e. that which makes one
thing not identical with another—must be form, not matter. The
‘principle of individuation’ was one of the important problems of the
scholastic philosophy. In various forms, it has remained a problem to
the present day. Without reference to any particular author, we may
perhaps state the problem as follows.</p>
<p>Among the properties of individual things, some are essential, others
accidental; the accidental properties of a thing are those it can lose
without losing its identity—such as wearing a hat, if you are a man. The
question now arises: given two individual things belonging to the same
species, do they always differ in essence, or is it possible for the
essence to be exactly the same in both? St Thomas holds the latter view
as regards material substances, the former as regards those that are
immaterial. Duns Scotus holds that there are always differences of
essence between two different individual things. The view of St Thomas
depends upon the theory that pure matter consists of undifferentiated
parts, which are distinguished solely by difference of position in
space. Thus a person, consisting of mind and body, may differ physically
from another person solely by the spatial position of his body. (This
might happen with identical twins, theoretically.) Duns Scotus, on the
other hand, holds that if things are distinct, they must be
distinguished by some qualitative difference. This view, clearly, is
nearer to Platonism than is that of St Thomas.</p>
<p>Various stages have to be traversed before we can state this problem
in modern terms. The first step, which was taken by Leibniz, was to get
rid of the distinction between essential and accidental properties,
which, like many that the scholastics took over from Aristotle, turns
out to be unreal as soon as we attempt to state it carefully. We thus
have, instead of ‘essence’, ‘all the propositions that are true of the
thing in question’. (In general, however, spatial and temporal position
would still be excluded.) Leibniz contends that it is impossible for two
things to be exactly alike in this sense; this is his principle of the
‘identity of indiscernibles’. This principle was criticized by
physicists, who maintained that two particles of matter might differ
solely as regards position in space and time—a view which has been
rendered more difficult by relativity, which reduces space and time to
relations.</p>
<p>A further step is required in modernizing the problem, and that is,
to get rid of the conception of ‘substance’. When this is done, a
‘thing’ has to be a bundle of qualities, since there is no longer any
kernel of pure ‘thinghood’. It would seem to follow that, if ‘substance’
is rejected, we must take a view more akin to that of Scotus than to
that of Aquinas. This, however, involves much difficulty in connection
with space and time. I have treated the question as I see it, under the
heading ‘Proper Names’, in my Inquiry into Meaning and Truth.</p>
<p>William of Occam is, after St Thomas, the most important schoolman.
The circumstances of his life are very imperfectly known. He was born
probably between 1290 and 1300; he died on April 10th, but whether in
1349 or 1350 is uncertain. (The Black Death was raging in 1349, so that
this is perhaps the more probable year.) Most people say he was born at
Ockham in Surrey, but Delisle Burns prefers Ockham in Yorkshire. He was
at Oxford, and then at Paris, where he was first the pupil and
afterwards the rival of Duns Scotus. He was involved in the quarrel of
the Franciscan order with Pope John XXII on the subject of poverty. The
Pope had persecuted the Spirituals, with the support of Michael of
Cesena, General of the Order. But there had been an arrangement by which
property left to the friars was given by them to the Pope, who allowed
them the benefit of it without the sin of ownership. This was ended by
John XXII, who said they should accept outright ownership. At this a
majority of the Order, headed by Michael of Cesena, rebelled. Occam, who
had been summoned to Avignon by the Pope to answer charges of heresy as
to transubstantiation, sided with Michael of Cesena, as did another
important man, Marsiglio of Padua. All three were excommunicated in
1328, but escaped from Avignon, and took refuge with the Emperor Louis.
Louis was one of the two claimants to the Empire; he was the one
favoured by Germany, but the other was favoured by the Pope. The Pope
excommunicated Louis, who appealed against him to a General Council. The
Pope himself was accused of heresy.</p>
<p>It is said that Occam, on meeting the Emperor, said: ‘Do you defend
me with the sword, and I will defend you with the pen.’ At any rate, he
and Marsiglio of Padua settled in Munich, under the protection of the
Emperor, and there wrote political treatises of considerable importance.
What happened to Occam after the Emperor’s death in 1338 is uncertain.
Some say he was reconciled to the Church, but this seems to be
false.</p>
<p>The Empire was no longer what it had been in the Hohenstaufen era;
and the papacy, though its pretensions had grown continually greater,
did not command the same reverence as formerly. Clement V had moved it
to Avignon at the beginning of the fourteenth century, and the Pope had
become a political subordinate of the King of France. The Empire had
sunk even more; it could no longer claim even the most shadowy kind of
universal dominion, because of the strength of France and England; on
the other hand, the Pope, by subservience to the King of France, also
weakened his claim to universality in temporal matters. Thus the
conflict between Pope and Emperor was really a conflict between France
and Germany. England, under Edward III, was at war with France, and
therefore in alliance with Germany; this caused England, also, to be
antipapal. The Pope’s enemies demanded a General Council—the only
ecclesiastical authority which could be regarded as superior to the
Pope.</p>
<p>The character of the opposition to the Pope changed at this time.
Instead of being merely in favour of the Emperor, it acquired a
democratic tone, particularly in matters of Church government. This gave
it a new strength, which ultimately led to the Reformation.</p>
<p>Dante (1265–1321), though as a poet he was a great innovator, was, as
a thinker, somewhat behind the times. His book De Monarchia is somewhat
Ghibelline in outlook, and would have been more timely a hundred years
earlier. He regards Emperor and Pope as independent, and both divinely
appointed. In the Divine Comedy, his Satan has three mouths, in which he
eternally chews Judas Iscariot, Brutus, and Cassius, who are all three
equally traitors, the first against Christ, the other two against
Caesar. Dante’s thought is interesting, not only in itself, but as that
of a layman; but it was not influential, and was hopelessly out of
date.</p>
<p>Marsiglio of Padua (1270–1342), on the contrary, inaugurated the new
form of opposition to the Pope, in which the Emperor has mainly a role
of decorative dignity. He was a close friend of William of Occam, whose
political opinions he influenced. Politically, he is more important than
Occam. He holds that the legislator is the majority of the people, and
that the majority has the right to punish princes. He applies popular
sovereignty also to the Church, and he includes the laity. There are to
be local councils of the people, including the laity, who are to elect
representatives to General Councils. The General Council alone should
have power to excommunicate, and to give authoritative interpretations
of Scripture. Thus all believers will have a voice in deciding doctrine.
The Church is to have no secular authority; there is to be no
excommunication without civil concurrence; and the Pope is to have no
special powers.</p>
<p>Occam did not go quite so far as Marsiglio, but he worked out a
completely democratic method of electing the General Council.</p>
<p>The conciliar movement came to a head in the early fifteenth century,
when it was needed to heal the Great Schism. But having accomplished
this task, it subsided. Its standpoint, as may be seen already in
Marsiglio, was different from that afterwards adopted, in theory, by the
Protestants. The Protestants claimed the right of private judgment, and
were not willing to submit to a General Council. They held that
religious belief is not a matter to be decided by any governmental
machinery. Marsiglio, on the contrary, still aims at preserving the
unity of the Catholic faith, but wishes this to be done by democratic
means, not by the papal absolutism, In practice, most Protestants, when
they acquired the government, merely substituted the King for the Pope,
and thus secured neither liberty of private judgment nor a democratic
method of deciding doctrinal questions. But in their opposition to the
Pope they found support in the doctrines of the conciliar movement. Of
all the schoolmen, Occam was the one whom Luther preferred. It must be
said that a considerable section of Protestants held to the doctrine of
private judgment even where the State was Protestant. This was the chief
point of difference between Independents and Presbyterians in the
English Civil War.</p>
<p>Occam’s political works3 are written in the style of philosophic
disputations, with arguments for and against various theses, sometimes
not reaching any conclusion. We are accustomed to a more forthright kind
of political propaganda, but in his day the form he chose was probably
effective.</p>
<p>A few samples will illustrate his method and outlook.</p>
<p>There is a long treatise called ‘Eight Questions Concerning the Power
of the Pope.’ The first question is whether one man can rightfully be
supreme both in Church and State. The second: Is secular authority
derived immediately from God or not? Third: Has the Pope the right to
grant secular jurisdiction to the Emperor and other princes? Fourth:
Does election by the electors give full powers to the German king? Fifth
and sixth: What rights does the Church acquire through the right of
bishops to anoint kings? Seventh: Is a coronation ceremony valid if
performed by the wrong archbishop? Eighth: Does election by the electors
give the German king the title of Emperor? All these were, at the time,
burning questions of practical politics.</p>
<p>Another treatise is on the question whether a prince can obtain the
goods of the Church without the Pope’s permission. This is concerned to
justify Edward III in taxing the clergy for his war with France. It will
be remembered that Edward was an ally of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Then comes a ‘Consultation on a matrimonial cause’, on the question
whether the Emperor was justified in marrying his cousin.</p>
<p>It will be seen that Occam did his best to deserve the protection of
the Emperor’s sword.</p>
<p>It is time now to turn to Occam’s purely philosophical doctrines. On
this subject there is a very good book, The Logic of William of Occam,
by Ernest E. Moody. Much of what I shall have to say is based on this
book, which takes a somewhat unusual view, but, I think, a correct one.
There is a tendency in writers on history of philosophy to interpret men
in the light of their successors, but this is generally a mistake. Occam
has been regarded as bringing about the breakdown of scholasticism, as a
precursor of Descartes or Kant or whoever might be the particular
commentator’s favourite among modern philosophers. According to Moody,
with whom I agree, all this is a mistake. Occam, he holds, was mainly
concerned to restore a pure Aristotle, freed from both Augustinian and
Arabic influences. This had also been, to a considerable extent, the aim
of St Thomas; but the Franciscans, as we have seen, had continued to
follow St Augustine much more closely than he did. The interpretation of
Occam by modern historians, according to Moody, has been vitiated by the
desire to find a gradual transition from scholastic to modern
philosophy; this has caused people to read modern doctrines into him,
when in fact he is only interpreting Aristotle.</p>
<p>Occam is best known for a maxim which is not to be found in his
works, but has acquired the name of ‘Occam’s razor’. This maxim says:
‘Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity.’ Although he did
not say this, he said something which has much the same effect, namely:
‘It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer.’ That is to
say, if everything in some science can be interpreted without assuming
this or that hypothetical entity, there is no ground for assuming it. I
have myself found this a most fruitful principle in logical
analysis.</p>
<p>In logic, though apparently not in metaphysics, Occam was a
nominalist; the nominalists of the fifteenth century4 looked upon him as
the founder of their school. He thought that Aristotle had been
misinterpreted by the Scotists, and that this misinterpretation was due
partly to the influence of Augustine, partly to Avicenna, but partly to
an earlier cause, Porphyry’s treatise on Aristotle’s Categories.
Porphyry in this treatise raised three questions: (1) Are genera and
species substances? (2) Are they corporeal or incorporeal? (3) If the
latter, are they in sensible things or separated from them? He raised
these questions as relevant to Aristotle’s Categories, and thus led the
Middle Ages to interpret the Organon too metaphysically. Aquinas had
attempted to</p>
<p>undo this error, but it had been reintroduced by Duns Scotus. The
result had been that logic and theory of knowledge had become dependent
on metaphysics and theology. Occam set to work to separate them
again.</p>
<p>For Occam, logic is an instrument for the philosophy of nature, which
can be independent of metaphysics. Logic is the analysis of discursive
science; science is about things, but logic is not. Things are
individual, but among terms there are universals; logic treats of
universals, while science uses them without discussing them. Logic is
concerned with terms or concepts, not as psychical states, but as having
meaning. ‘Man is a species’ is not a proposition of logic, because it
requires a knowledge of man. Logic deals with things fabricated by the
mind within itself, which cannot exist except through the existence of
reason. A concept is a natural sign, a word is a conventional sign. We
must distinguish when we are speaking of the word as a thing, and when
we are using it as having meaning, otherwise we may fall into fallacies
such as: ‘Man is a species, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is a
species.’</p>
<p>Terms which point at things are called ‘terms of first intention’;
terms which point at terms are called ‘terms of second intention’. The
terms in science are of first intention; in logic, of second.
Metaphysical terms are peculiar in that they signify both things
signified by words of first intention and things signified by words of
second intention. There are exactly six metaphysical terms: being,
thing, something, one, true, good.5 These terms have the peculiarity
that they can all be predicated of each other. But logic can be pursued
independently of them.</p>
<p>Understanding is of things, not of forms produced by the mind; these
are not what is understood, but that by which things are understood.
Universals, in logic, are only terms or concepts predicable of many
other terms or concepts. Universal, genus, species are terms of second
intention, and therefore cannot mean things. But since one and being are
convertible, if a universal existed, it would be one, and an individual
thing. A universal is merely a sign of many things. As to this, Occam
agrees with Aquinas, as against Averroes, Avicenna, and the
Augustinians. Both hold that there are only individual things,
individual minds, and acts of understanding. Both Aquinas and Occam, it
is true, admit the universale ante rem, but only to explain creation; it
had to be in the mind of God before He could create. But this belongs to
theology, not to the explanation of human knowledge, which is only
concerned with the universale post rem. In explaining human knowledge,
Occam never allows universals to be things. Socrates is similar to
Plato, he says, but not in virtue of a third thing called similarity.
Similarity is a term of second intention, and is in the mind. (All this
is good.)</p>
<p>Propositions about future contingents, according to Occam, are not
yet</p>
<p>either true or false. He makes no attempt to reconcile this view with
divine omniscience. Here, as elsewhere, he keeps logic free from
metaphysics and theology.</p>
<p>Some samples of Occam’s discussions may be useful.</p>
<p>He asks: ‘Whether that which is known by the understanding first
according to a primacy of generation is the individual.’</p>
<p>Against: The universal is the first and proper object of the
understanding.</p>
<p>For: The object of sense and the object of understanding are the
same, but the individual is the first object of sense.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the meaning of the question must be stated. (Presumably,
because both arguments seem strong.)</p>
<p>He continues: ‘The thing outside the soul which is not a sign is
understood first by such knowledge (i.e. by knowledge which is
individual), therefore the individual is known first, since everything
outside the soul is individual.’</p>
<p>He goes on to say that abstract knowledge always presupposes
knowledge which is ‘intuitive’ (i.e. of perception), and this is caused
by individual things.</p>
<p>He then enumerates four doubts which may arise, and proceeds to
resolve them.</p>
<p>He concludes with an affirmative answer to his original question, but
adds that ‘the universal is the first object by primacy of adequation,
not by the primacy of generation’.</p>
<p>The question involved is whether, or how far, perception is the
source of knowledge. It will be remembered that Plato, in the
Theaetetus, rejects the definition of knowledge as perception. Occam,
pretty certainly, did not know the Theaetetus, but if he had he would
have disagreed with it.</p>
<p>To the question ‘whether the sensitive soul and the intellective soul
are really distinct in man’, he answers that they are, though this is
hard to prove. One of his arguments is that we may with our appetites
desire something which with our understanding we reject; therefore
appetite and understanding belong to different subjects. Another
argument is that sensations are subjectively in the sensitive soul, but
not subjectively in the intellective soul. Again: the sensitive soul is
extended and material, while the intellective soul is neither. Four
objections are considered, all theological,6 but they are answered. The
view taken by Occam on this question is not, perhaps, what might be
expected. However, he agrees with St Thomas and disagrees with Averroes
in thinking that each man’s intellect is his own, not something
impersonal.</p>
<p>By insisting on the possibility of studying logic and human knowledge
without reference to metaphysics and theology, Occam’s work
encouraged</p>
<p>scientific research. The Augustinians, he said, erred in first
supposing things unintelligible and men unintelligent, and then adding a
light from Infinity by which knowledge became possible. He agreed in
this with Aquinas, but differed in emphasis, for Aquinas was primarily a
theologian, and Occam was, so far as logic is concerned, primarily a
secular philosopher.</p>
<p>His attitude gave confidence to students of particular problems, for
instance, his immediate follower Nicholas of Oresme (d. 1382), who
investigated planetary theory. This man was, to a certain extent, a
precursor of Copernicus; he set forth both the geocentric and the
heliocentric theories, and said that each would explain all the facts
known in his day, so that there was no way of deciding between them.</p>
<p>After William of Occam there are no more great scholastics. The next
time for great philosophers began in the late Renaissance.</p>
