<h4 id="christianity-during-the-first-four-centuries">2 CHRISTIANITY
DURING THE FIRST FOUR CENTURIES</h4>
<p>Christianity, at first, was preached by Jews to Jews, as a reformed
Judaism. St James, and to a lesser extent St Peter, wished it to remain
no more than this, and they might have prevailed but for St Paul, who
was determined to admit gentiles without demanding circumcision or
submission to the Mosaic Law. The contention between the two factions is
related in the Acts of the Apostles, from a Pauline point of view. The
communities of Christians that St Paul established in many places, were,
no doubt, composed partly of converts from among the Jews, partly of
gentiles seeking a new religion. The certainties of Judaism made it
attractive in that age of dissolving faiths, but circumcision was an
obstacle to the conversion of men. The ritual laws in regard to food
were also inconvenient. These two obstacles, even if there had been no
others, would have made it almost impossible for the Hebrew religion to
become universal. Christianity, owing to St Paul, retained what was
attractive in the doctrines of the Jews, without the features that
gentiles found hardest to assimilate.</p>
<p>The view that the Jews were the Chosen People remained, however,
obnoxious to Greek pride. This view was radically rejected by the
Gnostics. They, or at least some of them, held that the sensible world
had been created by an inferior deity named Ialdabaoth, the rebellious
son of Sophia (heavenly wisdom). He, they said, is the Yahweh of the Old
Testament, while the serpent, so far from being wicked, was engaged in
warning Eve against his deceptions. For a long time, the supreme deity
allowed Ialdabaoth free play; at last He sent His Son to inhabit
temporarily the body of the man Jesus, and to liberate the world from
the false teaching of Moses. Those who held this view, or something like
it, combined it, as a rule, with a Platonic philosophy; Plotinus, as we
saw, found some difficulty in refuting it. Gnosticism afforded a
half-way house between philosophic paganism and Christianity, for, while
it honoured Christ, it thought ill of the Jews. The same was true,
later, of Manichæism, through which St Augustine came to the Catholic
Faith. Manichæism combined Christian and Zoroastrian elements, teaching
that evil is a positive principle, embodied in matter, while the good
principle is embodied in spirit. It condemned meat-eating, and all sex,
even in marriage. Such intermediate doctrines helped much in the gradual
conversion of cultivated men of Greek speech; but the New Testament
warns true believers against them: ’O Timothy, keep that which is
committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and
oppositions of science [Gnosis] falsely so called: which some professing
have erred concerning the faith.’1</p>
<p>Gnostics and Manichæans continued to flourish until the government
became Christian. After that time they were led to conceal their
beliefs, but they still had a subterranean influence. One of the
doctrines of a certain sect of Gnostics was adopted by Mohammed. They
taught that Jesus was a mere man, and that the Son of God descended upon
him at the baptism, and abandoned him at the time of the Passion. In
support of this view they appealed to the text: ’My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?’2—a text which, it must be confessed, Christians
have always found difficult. The Gnostics considered it unworthy of the
Son of God to be born, to be an infant, and, above all, to die on the
cross; they said that these things had befallen the man Jesus, but not
the divine Son of God. Mohammed, who recognized Jesus as a prophet,
though not as divine, had a strong class feeling that prophets ought not
to come to a bad end. He therefore adopted the view of the Docetics (a
Gnostic sect), according to which it was a mere phantom that hung upon
the cross, upon which, impotently and ignorantly, Jews and Romans
wreaked their ineffectual vengeance. In this way, something of
Gnosticism passed over into the orthodox doctrine of Islam.</p>
<p>The attitude of Christians to contemporary Jews early became hostile.
The received view was that God had spoken to the patriarchs and
prophets, who were holy men, and had foretold the coming of Christ; but
when Christ came, the Jews failed to recognize Him, and were thenceforth
to be accounted wicked. Moreover Christ had abrogated the Mosaic Law,
substituting the two commandments to love God and our neighbour; this,
also, the Jews perversely failed to recognize. As soon as the State
became Christian, anti-Semitism, in its medieval form, began, nominally
as a manifestation of Christian zeal. How far the economic motives, by
which it was inflamed in later times, operated in the Christian Empire,
it seems impossible to ascertain.</p>
<p>In proportion as Christianity became hellenized, it became
theological. Jewish theology was always simple. Yahweh developed from a
tribal deity into the sole omnipotent God who created heaven and earth;
divine justice, when it was seen not to confer earthly prosperity upon
the virtuous, was transferred to heaven, which entailed belief in
immortality. But throughout its evolution the Jewish creed involved
nothing complicated and metaphysical; it had no mysteries, and every Jew
could understand it.</p>
<p>This Jewish simplicity, on the whole, still characterizes the
synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), but has already disappeared
in St John, where Christ is identified with the Platonic-Stoic Logos. It
is less Christ the Man than Christ the theological figure that interests
the fourth evangelist. This is still more true of the Fathers; you will
find, in their writings, many more allusions to St John than to the
other three gospels put together. The Pauline epistles also contain much
theology, especially as regards salvation; at the same time they show a
considerable acquaintance with Greek culture—a quotation from Menander,
an allusion to Epimenides the Cretan who said that all Cretans are
liars, and so on. Nevertheless St Paul3 says: ‘Beware lest any man spoil
you through philosophy and vain deceit.’</p>
<p>The synthesis of Greek philosophy and Hebrew scriptures remained more
or less haphazard and fragmentary until the time of Origen (A.D.
185–254). Origen, like Philo, lived in Alexandria, which, owing to
commerce and the university, was, from its foundation to its fall, the
chief centre of learned syncretism. Like his contemporary Plotinus, he
was a pupil of Ammonius Saccas, whom many regard as the founder of
Neoplatonism. His doctrines, as set forth in his work De Principiis,
have much affinity to those of Plotinus—more, in fact, than is
compatible with orthodoxy.</p>
<p>There is, Origen says, nothing wholly incorporeal except God—Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost. The stars are living rational beings, to whom God
has given souls that were already in existence. The sun, he thinks, can
sin. The souls of men, as Plato taught, come to them at birth from
elsewhere, having existed even since the Creation. Nous and soul are
distinguished more or less as in Plotinus. When Nous falls away, it
becomes soul; soul, when virtuous, becomes Nous. Ultimately all spirits
will become wholly submissive to Christ, and will then be bodiless. Even
the devil will be saved at the last.</p>
<p>Origen, in spite of being recognized as one of the Fathers, was, in
later times, condemned as having maintained four heresies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The pre-existence of souls, as taught by Plato.</p></li>
<li><p>That the human nature of Christ, and not only His divine nature,
existed before the Incarnation.</p></li>
<li><p>That, at the resurrection, our bodies will be transformed into
absolutely ethereal bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>That all men, and even devils, shall be saved at the
last.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>St Jerome, who had expressed a somewhat unguarded admiration of
Origen for his work in establishing the text of the Old Testament, found
it prudent, subsequently, to expend much time and vehemence in
repudiating his theological errors.</p>
<p>Origen’s aberrations were not only theological; in his youth he was
guilty of an irreparable error through a too literal interpretation of
the text: ’There be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven’s sake.’4 This method of escaping the temptations of
the flesh, which</p>
<p>Origen rashly adopted, had been condemned by the Church; moreover it
made him ineligible for holy orders, although some ecclesiastics seem to
have thought otherwise, thereby giving rise to unedifying controversies.
Origen’s longest work is a book entitled Against Celsus. Celsus was the
author of a book (now lost) against Christianity, and Origen set to work
to answer him point by point. Celsus begins by objecting to Christians
because they belong to illegal associations; this Origen does not deny,
but claims to be a virtue, like tyrannicide. He then comes to what is no
doubt the real basis for the dislike of Christianity: Christianity, says
Celsus, comes from the Jews, who are barbarians; and only Greeks can
extract sense out of the teachings of barbarians. Origen replies that
anyone coming from Greek philosophy to the Gospels would conclude that
they are true, and supply a demonstration satisfying to the Greek
intellect. But further, ’The Gospel has a demonstration of its own, more
divine than any established by Grecian dialectics. And this diviner
method is called by the apostle the “manifestation of the Spirit and of
power“; of “the Spirit“, on account of the prophecies, which are
sufficient to produce faith in any one who reads them, especially in
those things which relate to Christ; and of “power“, because of the
signs and wonders which we must believe to have been performed, both on
many other grounds, and on this, that traces of them are still preserved
among those who regulate their lives by the precepts of the
Gospel.’5</p>
<p>This passage is interesting, as showing already the twofold argument
for belief which is characteristic of Christian philosophy. On the one
hand, pure reason, rightly exercised, suffices to establish the
essentials of the Christian faith, more especially God, immortality, and
free will. But on the other hand the Scriptures prove not only these
bare essentials, but much more; and the divine inspiration of the
Scriptures is proved by the fact that the prophets</p>
<p>foretold the coming of the Messiah, by the miracles, and by the
beneficent effects of belief on the lives of the faithful. Some of these
arguments are now considered out of date, but the last of them was still
employed by William James. All of them, until the Renaissance, were
accepted by every Christian philosopher.</p>
<p>Some of Origen’s arguments are curious. He says that magicians invoke
the ‘God of Abraham’, often without knowing who He is; but apparently
this invocation is specially potent. Names are essential in magic; it is
not indifferent whether God is called by His Jewish, Egyptian,
Babylonian, Greek, or Brahman name. Magic formulae lose their efficacy
when translated. One is led to suppose that the magicians of the time
used formulae from all known religions, but if Origen is right, those
derived from Hebrew sources were the most effective. The argument is the
more curious as he points out that Moses forbade sorcery.6</p>
<p>Christians, we are told, should not take part in the government of
the State, but only of the ‘divine nation’, i.e., the Church.7 This
doctrine, of course, was somewhat modified after the time of
Constantine, but something of it survived. It is implicit in St
Augustine’s City of God. It led churchmen, at the time of the fall of
the Western Empire, to look on passively at secular disasters, while
they exercised their very great talents in Church discipline,
theological controversy, and the spread of monasticism. Some trace of it
still exists: most people regard politics as ‘worldly’ and unworthy of
any really holy man.</p>
<p>Church government developed slowly during the first three centuries,
and rapidly after the conversion of Constantine. Bishops were popularly
elected; gradually they acquired considerable power over Christians in
their own dioceses, but before Constantine there was hardly any form of
central government over the whole Church. The power of bishops in great
cities was enhanced by the practice of almsgiving: the offerings of the
faithful were administered by the bishop, who could give or withhold
charity to the poor. There came thus to be a mob of the destitute, ready
to do the bishop’s will. When the State became Christian, the bishops
were given judicial and administrative functions. There came also to be
a central government, at least in matters of doctrine. Constantine was
annoyed by the quarrel between Catholics and Arians; having thrown in
his lot with the Christians, he wanted them to be a united party. For
the purpose of healing dissensions, he caused the convening of the
oecumenical Council of Nicæa, which drew up the Nicene Creed,8 and, so
far as the Arian controversy was concerned, determined for all time the
standard of orthodoxy. Other later controversies were</p>
<p>similarly decided by oecumenical councils, until the division between
East and West and the Eastern refusal to admit the authority of the Pope
made them impossible.</p>
<p>The Pope, though officially the most important individual in the
Church, had no authority over the Church as a whole until a much later
period. The gradual growth of the papal power is a very interesting
subject, which I shall deal with in later chapters.</p>
<p>The growth of Christianity before Constantine, as well as the motives
of his conversion, has been variously explained by various authors.
Gibbon9 assigns five causes:</p>
<p>’I. The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the intolerant
zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the Jewish religion,
but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which, instead of
inviting, had deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses.</p>
<p>’II. The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional
circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important
truth.</p>
<p>’III. The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive Church.</p>
<p>’IV. The pure and austere morals of the Christians.</p>
<p>‘V. The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which
gradually formed an independent and increasing State in the heart of the
Roman empire.’</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, this analysis may be accepted, but with some
comments. The first cause—the inflexibility and intolerance derived from
the Jews—may be wholly accepted. We have seen in our own day the
advantages of intolerance in propaganda. The Christians, for the most
part, believed that they alone would go to heaven, and that the most
awful punishments would, in the next world, fall upon the heathen. The
other religions which competed for favour during the third century had
not this threatening character. The worshippers of the Great Mother, for
example, while they had a ceremony—the Taurobolium—which was analogous
to baptism, did teach that those who omitted it would go to hell. It may
be remarked, incidentally, that the Taurobolium was expensive: a bull
had to be killed, and its blood allowed to trickle over the convert. A
rite of this sort is aristocratic, and cannot be the basis of a religion
which is to embrace the great bulk of the population, rich and poor,
free and slave. In such respects, Christianity had an advantage over all
its rivals.</p>
<p>As regards the doctrine of a future life, in the West it was first
taught by the Orphics and thence adopted by Greek philosophers. The
Hebrew prophets,</p>
<p>some of them, taught the resurrection of the body, but it seems to
have been from the Greeks that the Jews learnt to believe in the
resurrection of the spirit.10 The doctrine of immortality, in Greece,
had a popular form in Orphism and a learned form in Platonism. The
latter, being based upon difficult arguments, could not become widely
popular; the Orphic form, however, probably had a great influence on the
general opinions of later antiquity, not only among pagans, but also
among Jews and Christians. Elements of mystery religions, both Orphic
and Asiatic, enter largely into Christian theology; in all of them, the
central myth is that of the dying god who rises again.11 I think,
therefore, that the doctrine of immortality must have had less to do
with the spread of Christianity than Gibbon thought.</p>
<p>Miracles certainly played a very large part in Christian propaganda.
But miracles, in later antiquity, were very common, and were not the
prerogative of any one religion. It is not altogether easy to see why,
in this competition, the Christian miracles came to be more widely
believed than those of other sects. I think Gibbon omits one very
important matter, namely the possession of a Sacred Book. The miracles
to which Christians appealed had begun in a remote antiquity, among a
nation which the ancients felt to be mysterious; there was a consistent
history, from the Creation onwards, according to which Providence had
always worked wonders, first for the Jews, then for the Christians. To a
modern historical student it is obvious that the early history of the
Israelites is in the main legendary, but not so to the ancients. They
believed in the Homeric account of the siege of Troy, in Romulus and
Remus, and so on; why, asks Origen, should you accept these traditions
and reject those of the Jews? To this argument there was no logical
answer. It was therefore natural to accept Old Testament miracles, and,
when they had been admitted, those of more recent date became credible,
especially in view of the Christian interpretation of the prophets.</p>
<p>The morals of the Christians, before Constantine, were undoubtedly
very superior to those of average pagans. The Christians were persecuted
at times, and were almost always at a disadvantage in competition with
pagans. They believed firmly that virtue would be rewarded in heaven and
sin punished in hell. Their sexual ethics had a strictness that was rare
in antiquity. Pliny, whose official duty it was to persecute them,
testifies to their high moral character. After the conversion of
Constantine, there were, of course, time-servers among Christians; but
prominent ecclesiastics, with some exceptions, continued to be men of
inflexible moral principles. I think Gibbon is right in attributing
great importance to this high moral level as one of the causes of the
spread of Christianity.</p>
<p>Gibbon puts last ‘the union and discipline of the Christian
republic’. I think that, from a political point of view, this was the
most important of his five causes. In the modern world, we are
accustomed to political organization; every politician has to reckon
with the Catholic vote, but it is balanced by the vote of other
organized groups. A Catholic candidate for the American Presidency is at
a disadvantage, because of Protestant prejudice. But, if there were no
such thing as Protestant prejudice, a Catholic candidate would stand a
better chance than any other. This seems to have been Constantine’s
calculation. The support of the Christians, as a single organized bloc,
was to be obtained by favouring them. Whatever dislike of the Christians
existed was unorganized and politically ineffective. Probably
Rostovtseff is right in holding that a large part of the army was
Christian, and that this was what most influenced Constantine. However
that may be, the Christians, while still a minority, had a kind of
organization which was then new, though now common, and which gave them
all the political influence of a pressure group to which no other
pressure groups are opposed. This was the natural consequence of their
virtual monopoly of zeal, and their zeal was an inheritance from the
Jews.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as soon as the Christians acquired political power,
they turned their zeal against each other. There had been heresies, not
a few, before Constantine, but the orthodox had had no means of
punishing them. When the State became Christian, great prizes, in the
shape of power and wealth, became open to ecclesiastics; there were
disputed elections, and theological quarrels were also quarrels for
worldly advantages. Constantine himself preserved a certain degree of
neutrality in the disputes of theologians, but after his death (337) his
successors (except for Julian the Apostate) were, in a greater or less
degree, favourable to the Arians, until the accession of Theodosius in
379.</p>
<p>The hero of this period is Athanasius (ca. 297–373), who was
throughout his long life the most intrepid champion of Nicene
orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The period from Constantine to the Council of Chalcedon (451) is
peculiar owing to the political importance of theology. Two questions
successively agitated the Christian world: first, the nature of the
Trinity, and then the doctrine of the Incarnation. Only the first of
these was to the fore in the time of Athanasius. Arius, a cultivated
Alexandrian priest, maintained that the Son is not the equal of the
Father, but created by Him. At an earlier period, this view might not
have aroused much antagonism, but in the fourth century most theologians
rejected it. The view which finally prevailed was that the Father and
the Son were equal, and of the same substance; they were, however,
distinct Persons. The view that they were not distinct, but only
different aspects of one Being, was the Sabellian heresy, called after
its founder Sabellius. Orthodoxy thus had to tread a narrow line: those
who unduly emphasized the distinctness of the Father and the Son were in
danger of Arianism, and those who unduly emphasized their oneness were
in danger of Sabellianism.</p>
<p>The doctrines of Arius were condemned by the Council of Nicæa (325)
by an overwhelming majority. But various modifications were suggested by
various theologians, and favoured by Emperors. Athanasius, who was
Bishop of Alexandria from 328 till his death, was constantly in exile
because of his zeal for Nicene orthodoxy. He had immense popularity in
Egypt, which, throughout the controversy, followed him unwaveringly. It
is curious that, in the course of theological controversy, national (or
at least regional) feeling, which had seemed extinct since the Roman
conquest, revived. Constantinople and Asia inclined to Arianism; Egypt
was fanatically Athanasian; the West steadfastly adhered to the decrees
of the Council of Nicæa. After the Arian controversy was ended, new
controversies, of a more or less kindred sort, arose, in which Egypt
became heretical in one direction and Syria in another. These heresies,
which were persecuted by the orthodox, impaired the unity of the Eastern
Empire, and facilitated the Mohammedan conquest. The separatist
movements, in themselves, are not surprising, but it is curious that
they should have been associated with very subtle and abtruse
theological questions.</p>
<p>The Emperors, from 335 to 378, favoured more or less Arian opinions
as far as they dared, except for Julian the Apostate (361–363), who, as
a pagan, was neutral as regards the internal disputes of the Christians.
At last, in 379, the Emperor Theodosius gave his full support to the
Catholics, and their victory throughout the Empire was complete. St
Ambrose, St Jerome, and St Augustine, whom we shall consider in the next

triumph. It was succeeded, however, in the West, by another Arian
domination, that of the Goths and Vandals, who, between them, conquered
most of the Western Empire. Their power lasted for about a century, at

Franks, of whom Justinian and the Franks, and ultimately the Lombards
also, were orthodox. Thus at last the Catholic faith achieved definitive
success.</p>
