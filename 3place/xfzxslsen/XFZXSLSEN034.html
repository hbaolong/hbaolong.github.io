<h4 id="the-religious-development-of-the-jews">1 THE RELIGIOUS
DEVELOPMENT OF THE JEWS</h4>
<p>The Christian religion, as it was handed over by the late Roman
Empire to the barbarians, consisted of three elements: first, certain
philosophical beliefs, derived mainly from Plato and the Neoplatonists,
but also in part from the Stoics; second, a conception of morals and
history derived from the Jews; and third, certain theories, more
especially as to salvation, which were on the whole new in Christianity,
though in part traceable to Orphism, and to kindred cults of the Near
East.</p>
<p>The most important Jewish elements in Christianity appear to me to be
the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A sacred history, beginning with the Creation, leading to a
consummation in the future, and justifying the ways of God to
man.</p></li>
<li><p>The existence of a small section of mankind whom God specially
loves. For Jews, this section was the Chosen People; for Christians, the
elect.</p></li>
<li><p>A new conception of ‘righteousness’. The virtue of almsgiving,
for example, was taken over by Christianity from later Judaism. The
importance attached to baptism might be derived from Orphism or from
oriental pagan mystery religions, but practical philanthropy, as an
element in the Christian conception of virtue, seems to have come from
the Jews.</p></li>
<li><p>The Law. Christians kept part of the Hebrew Law, for instance the
Decalogue, while they rejected its ceremonial and ritual parts. But in
practice they attached to the Creed much the same feelings that the Jews
attached to the Law. This involved the doctrine that correct belief is
at least as important as virtuous action, a doctrine which is
essentially Hellenic. What is Jewish in origin is the exclusiveness of
the elect.</p></li>
<li><p>The Messiah. The Jews believed that the Messiah would bring them
temporal prosperity, and victory over their enemies here on earth;
moreover, he remained in the future. For Christians, the Messiah was the
historical Jesus, who was also identified with the Logos of Greek
philosophy; and it was not on earth, but in heaven, that the Messiah was
to enable his followers to triumph over their enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>The Kingdom of Heaven. Other-worldliness is a conception which
Jews and Christians, in a sense, share with later Platonism, but it
takes, with them, a much more concrete form than with Greek
philosophers. The Greek doctrine—which is to be found in much Christian
philosophy, but not in popular Christianity—was that the sensible world,
in space and time, is an illusion, and that, by intellectual and moral
discipline, a man can learn to live in the eternal world, which alone is
real. The Jewish and Christian doctrine, on the other hand, conceived
the Other World as not metaphysically different from this world, but as
in the future, when the virtuous would enjoy everlasting bliss and the
wicked would suffer everlasting torment. This belief embodied revenge
psychology, and was intelligible to all and sundry, as the doctrines of
Greek philosophers were not.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To understand the origin of these beliefs, we must take account of
certain facts in Jewish history, to which we will now turn our
attention.</p>
<p>The early history of the Israelites cannot be confirmed from any
source outside the Old Testament, and it is impossible to know at what
point it ceases to be purely legendary. David and Solomon may be
accepted as kings who probably had a real existence, but at the earliest
points at which we come to something certainly historical there are
already two kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The first person mentioned in
the Old Testament of whom there is an independent record is Ahab, King
of Israel, who is spoken of in an Assyrian letter of 853 B.C. The
Assyrians finally conquered the Northern kingdom in 722 B.C., and
removed a great part of the population. After this time, the kingdom of
Judah alone preserved the Israelite religion and tradition. The kingdom
of Judah just survived the Assyrians, whose power came to an end with
the capture of Nineveh by the Babylonians and Medes in 606 B.C. But in
586 B.C. Nebuchadrezzar captured Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple, and
removed a large part of the population to Babylon. The Babylonian
kingdom fell in 538 B.C., when Babylon was taken by Cyrus, king of the
Medes and Persians. Cyrus, in 537 B.C. issued an edict allowing the Jews
to return to Palestine. Many of them did so, under the leadership of
Nehemiah and Ezra; the Temple was rebuilt, and Jewish orthodoxy began to
be crystallized.</p>
<p>In the period of the captivity, and for some time before and after
this period, Jewish religion went through a very important development.
Originally, there appears to have been not very much difference, from a
religious point of view, between the Israelites and surrounding tribes.
Yahweh was, at first, only a tribal god who favoured the children of
Israel, but it was not denied that there were other gods, and their
worship was habitual. When the first Commandment says ‘Thou shalt have
none other gods but me,’ it is saying something which was an innovation
in the time immediately preceding the captivity. This is made evident by
various texts in the earlier prophets. It was the prophets at this time
who first taught that the worship of heathen gods was sin. To win the
victory in the constant wars of that time, they proclaimed, the favour
of Yahweh was essential; and Yahweh would withdraw his favour if other
gods were also honoured. Jeremiah and Ezekiel, especially, seem to have
invented the idea that all religions except one are false, and that the
Lord punishes idolatry.</p>
<p>Some quotations will illustrate their teachings, and the prevalence
of the heathen practices against which they protested. ’Seest Thou not
what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The
children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women
knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven [Ishtar], and
pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to
anger.’1 The Lord is angry about it. ’And they have built the high
places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn
their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not,
neither came it into my heart.’2</p>
<p>There is a very interesting passage in Jeremiah in which he denounces
the Jews in Egypt for their idolatry. He himself had lived among them
for a time. The prophet tells the Jewish refugees in Egypt that Yahweh
will destroy them all because their wives have burnt incense to other
gods. But they refuse to listen to him, saying: ‘We will certainly do
whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto
the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we
have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities
of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of
victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.’ But Jeremiah assures them
that Yahweh noticed these idolatrous practices, and that misfortune has
come because of them. ’Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the
Lord, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of
Judah in all the land of Egypt…. I will watch over them for evil, and
not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt
shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end
of them.’3</p>
<p>Ezekiel is equally shocked by the idolatrous practices of the Jews.
The Lord in a vision shows him women at the north gate of the temple
weeping for Tammuz (a Babylonian deity); then He shows him ‘greater
abominations’, five and twenty men at the door of the temple worshipping
the sun. The Lord declares: ’Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine
eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in
mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.’4</p>
<p>The idea that all religions but one are wicked, and that the Lord
punishes idolatry, was apparently invented by these prophets. The
prophets, on the whole, were fiercely nationalistic, and looked forward
to the day when the Lord would utterly destroy the gentiles.</p>
<p>The captivity was taken to justify the denunciations of the prophets.
If Yahweh was all-powerful, and the Jews were his Chosen People, their
sufferings could only be explained by their wickedness. The psychology
is that of paternal correction: the Jews are to be purified by
punishment. Under the influence of this belief, they developed, in
exile, an orthodoxy much more rigid and much more nationally exclusive
than that which had prevailed while they were independent. The Jews who
remained behind and were not transplanted to Babylon did not undergo
this development to anything like the same extent. When Ezra and
Nehemiah came back to Jerusalem after the captivity, they were shocked
to find that mixed marriages had been common, and they dissolved all
such marriages.5</p>
<p>The Jews were distinguished from the other nations of antiquity by
their stubborn national pride. All the others, when conquered,
acquiesced inwardly as well as outwardly; the Jews alone retained the
belief in their own pre-eminence, and the conviction that their
misfortunes were due to God’s anger, because they had failed to preserve
the purity of their faith and ritual. The historical books of the Old
Testament, which were mostly compiled after the captivity, give a
misleading impression, since they suggest that the idolatrous practices
against which the prophets protested were a falling-off from earlier
strictness, whereas in fact the earlier strictness had never existed.
The prophets were innovators to a much greater extent than appears in
the Bible when read unhistorically.</p>
<p>Some things which were afterwards characteristic of Jewish religion
were developed, though in part from previously existing sources, during
the captivity. Owing to the destruction of the Temple, where alone
sacrifices could be offered, the Jewish ritual perforce became
non-sacrificial. Synagogues began at this time, with readings from such
portions of the Scriptures as already existed. The importance of the
Sabbath was first emphasized at this</p>
<p>time, and so was circumcision as the mark of the Jew. As we have
already seen, it was only during the exile that marriage with gentiles
came to be forbidden. There was a growth of every form of exclusiveness,
’I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people.’6
’Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.’7 The Law is a
product of this period. It was one of the chief forces in preserving
national unity.</p>
<p>What we have as the Book of Isaiah is the work of two different
prophets, one before the exile and one after. The second of these, who
is called by Biblical students Deutero-Isaiah, is the most remarkable of
the prophets. He is the first who reports the Lord as saying ‘There is
no God but I.’ He believes in the resurrection of the body, perhaps as a
result of Persian influence. His prophecies of the Messiah were, later,
the chief Old Testament texts used to show that the prophets foresaw the
coming of Christ.</p>
<p>In Christian arguments with both pagans and Jews, these texts from
Deutero-Isaiah played a very important part, and for this reason I shall
quote the most noteworthy of them. All nations are to be converted in
the end: ‘They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their
spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more’ (Is. ii, 4): ‘Behold a virgin
shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.’8 (As
to this text there was a controversy between Jews and Christians; the
Jews said that the correct translation is ’a young woman shall
conceive’, but the Christians thought the Jews were lying.) ‘The people
that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the
land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. … For unto
us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be
upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,
the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.’9 The most
apparently prophetic of these passages is the fifty-third chapter, which
contains the familiar texts: ’He is despised and rejected of men; a man
of sorrows and acquainted with grief…. Surely he hath borne our griefs,
and carried our sorrows…. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he
was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon
him; and with his stripes we are healed…. He was oppressed, and he was
afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not
his mouth.’ The inclusion of the gentiles in the ultimate salvation is
explicit: ’And the gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
brightness of thy rising.’10</p>
<p>After Ezra and Nehemiah, the Jews for a while disappear from history.
The Jewish State survived as a theocracy, but its territory was very
small—only the region of ten to fifteen miles around Jerusalem,
according to E. Bevan.11 After Alexander, it became a disputed territory
between the Ptolemies and Seleucids. This, however, seldom involved
fighting in actual Jewish territory, and left the Jews, for a long time,
to the free exercise of their religion.</p>
<p>Their moral maxims, at this time, are set forth in Ecclesiasticus,
probably written about 200 B.C. Until recently, this book was only known
in a Greek version; this is the reason for its being banished to the
Apocrypha. But a Hebrew manuscript has lately been discovered, in some
respects different from the Greek text translated in our version of the
Apocrypha. The morality taught is very mundane. Reputation among
neighbours is highly prized. Honesty is the best policy, because it is
useful to have Yahweh on your side. Almsgiving is recommended. The only
sign of Greek influence is in the praise of medicine.</p>
<p>Slaves must not be treated too kindly. ‘Fodder, a wand, and burdens,
are for the ass: and bread, correction, and work, for a servant…. Set
him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient, put on more heavy
fetters’ (xxiii, 24, 28). At the same time, remember that you have paid
a price for him, and that if he runs away you will lose your money; this
sets a limit to profitable severity (ibid., 30, 31). Daughters are a
great source of anxiety; apparently in the writer’s day they were much
addicted to immorality (xlii, 9–11). He has a low opinion of women:
‘From garments cometh a moth, and from women wickedness’ (ibid., 13). It
is a mistake to be cheerful with your children; the right course is to
‘bow down their neck from their youth’ (vii, 23, 24).</p>
<p>Altogether, like the elder Cato, he represents the morality of the
virtuous business man in a very unattractive light.</p>
<p>This tranquil existence of comfortable self-righteousness was rudely
interrupted by the Seleucid king Antiochus IV, who was determined to
hellenize all his dominions. In 175 B.C. he established a gymnasium in
Jerusalem, and taught young men to wear Greek hats and practise
athletics. In this he was helped by a hellenizing Jew named Jason, whom
he made high priest. The priestly aristocracy had become lax, and had
felt the attraction of Greek civilization; but they were vehemently
opposed by a party called the ‘Hasidim’ (meaning ‘Holy’), who were
strong among the rural population.12 When, in 170 B.C., Antiochus became
involved in war with Egypt, the Jews rebelled. Thereupon Antiochus took
the holy vessels from the Temple, and</p>
<p>placed in it the image of the God. He identified Yahweh with Zeus,
following a practice which had been successful everywhere else.13 He
resolves to extirpate the Jewish religion, and to stop circumcision and
the observance of the laws relating to food. To all this Jerusalem
submitted, but outside Jerusalem the Jews resisted with the utmost
stubbornness.</p>
<p>The history of this period is told in the first Book of Maccabees.
The first chapter tells how Antiochus decreed that all the inhabitants
of his kingdom should be one people, and abandon their separate laws.
All the heathen obeyed, and many of the Israelites, although the king
commanded that they should profane the sabbath, sacrifice swine’s flesh,
and leave their children uncircumcised. All who disobeyed were to suffer
death. Many, nevertheless, resisted. ’They put to death certain women,
that had caused their children to be circumcised. And they hanged the
infants about their necks, and rifled their houses, and slew them that
had circumcised them. Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and
confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean thing. Wherefore they
chose rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that
they might not profane the holy covenant: so then they died.’14</p>
<p>It was at this time that the doctrine of immortality came to be
widely believed among the Jews. It had been thought that virtue would be
rewarded here on earth; but persecution, which fell upon the most
virtuous, made it evident that this was not the case. In order to
safeguard divine justice, therefore, it was necessary to believe in
rewards and punishments hereafter. This doctrine was not universally
accepted among the Jews; in the time of Christ, the Sadducees still
rejected it. But by that time they were a small party, and in later
times all Jews believed in immortality.</p>
<p>The revolt against Antiochus was led by Judas Maccabæus, an able
military commander, who first recaptured Jerusalem (164 B.C.), and then
embarked upon aggression. Sometimes he killed all the males, sometimes
he circumcised them by force. His brother Jonathan was made high priest,
was allowed to occupy Jerusalem with a garrison, and conquered part of
Samaria, acquiring Joppa and Akra. He negotiated with Rome, and was
successful in securing complete autonomy. His family were high priests
until Herod, and are known as the Hasmonean dynasts.</p>
<p>In enduring and resisting persecution the Jews of this time showed
immense heroism, although in defence of things that do not strike us as
important, such as circumcision and the wickedness of eating pork.</p>
<p>The time of the persecution by Antiochus IV was crucial in Jewish
history. The Jews of the Dispersion were, at this time, becoming more
and more</p>
<p>hellenized; the Jews of Judea were few; and even among them the rich
and powerful were inclined to acquiesce in Greek innovations. But for
the heroic resistance of the Hasidim, the Jewish religion might easily
have died out. If this had happened, neither Christianity nor Islam
could have existed in anything like the form they actually took.
Townsend, in his introduction to the translation of the Fourth Book of
Maccabees, says:</p>
<p>’It has been finely said that if Judaism as a religion had perished
under Antiochus, the seed-bed of Christianity would have been lacking;
and thus the blood of the Maccabean martyrs, who saved Judaism,
ultimately became the seed of the Church. Therefore as not only
Christendom but also Islam derive their monotheism from a Jewish source,
it may well be that the world to-day owes the very existence of
monotheism both in the East and in the West to the Maccabees.’15</p>
<p>The Maccabees themselves, however, were not admired by later Jews,
because their family, as high priests, adopted, after their successes, a
worldly and temporizing policy. Admiration was for the martyrs. The
Fourth Book of Maccabees, written probably in Alexandria about the time
of Christ, illustrates this as well as some other interesting points. In
spite of its title, it nowhere mentions the Maccabees, but relates the
amazing fortitude, first of an old man, and then of seven young
brothers, all of whom were first tortured and then burnt by Antiochus,
while their mother, who was present, exhorted them to stand firm. The
king, at first, tried to win them by friendliness, telling them that, if
they would only consent to eat pork, he would take them into his favour,
and secure successful careers for them. When they refused, he showed
them the instruments of torture. But they remained unshakable, telling
him that he would suffer eternal torment after death, while they would
inherit everlasting bliss. One by one, in each other’s presence, and in
that of their mother, they were first exhorted to eat pork, then, when
they refused, tortured and killed. At the end, the king turned round to
his soldiers and told them he hoped they would profit by such an example
of courage. The account is of course embellished by legend, but it is
historically true that the persecution was severe and was endured
heroically; also that the main points at issue were circumcision and
eating pork.</p>
<p>This book is interesting in another respect. Although the writer is
obviously an orthodox Jew, he uses the language of the Stoic philosophy,
and is concerned to prove that the Jews live most completely in
accordance with its precepts. The book opens with the sentence:</p>
<p>‘Philosophical in the highest degree is the question I propose to
discuss, namely whether the Inspired Reason is supreme ruler over the
passions; and to the philosophy of it I would seriously entreat your
earnest attention.’</p>
<p>Alexandrian Jews were willing, in philosophy, to learn from the
Greeks, but they adhered with extraordinary tenacity to the Law,
especially circumcision, observance of the Sabbath, and abstinence from
pork and other unclean meats. From the time of Nehemiah till after the
fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, the importance that they attached to the
Law steadily increased. They no longer tolerated prophets who had
anything new to say. Those among them who felt impelled to write in the
style of the prophets pretended that they had discovered an old book, by
Daniel or Solomon or some other ancient of impeccable respectability.
Their ritual peculiarities held them together as a nation, but emphasis
on the Law gradually destroyed originality and made them intensely
conservative. This rigidity makes the revolt of St Paul against the
domination of the Law very remarkable.</p>
<p>The New Testament, however, is not such a completely new beginning as
it is apt to seem to those who know nothing of Jewish literature in the
times just before the birth of Christ. Prophetic fervour was by no means
dead, though it had to adopt the device of pseudonymity, in order to
obtain a hearing. Of the greatest interest, in this respect, is the Book
of Enoch,16 a composite work, due to various authors, the earliest being
slightly before the time of the Maccabees, and the latest about 64 B.C.
Most of it professes to relate apocalyptic visions of the patriarch
Enoch. It is very important for the side of Judaism which turned to
Christianity. The New Testament writers are familiar with it; St Jude
considers it to be actually by Enoch. Early Christian Fathers, for
instance Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian, treated it as canonical,
but Jerome and Augustine rejected it. It fell, consequently, into
oblivion, and was lost until, early in the nineteenth century, three
manuscripts of it, in Ethiopic, were found in Abyssinia. Since then,
manuscripts of parts of it have been found in Greek and Latin versions.
It appears to have been originally written partly in Hebrew, partly in
Aramaic. Its authors were members of the Hasidim, and their successors
the Pharisees. It denounces kings and princes, meaning the Hasmonean
dynasty and the Sadducees. It influenced New Testament doctrine,
particularly as regards the Messiah, Sheol (hell), and demonology.</p>
<p>The book consists mainly of ‘parables’, which are more cosmic than
those of the New Testament. There are visions of heaven and hell, of the
Last Judgment, and so on; one is reminded of the first two Books of
Paradise Lost where the literary quality is good, and of Blake’s
Prophetic Books where it is inferior.</p>
<p>There is an expansion of Genesis vi. 2, 4, which is curious and
Promethean. The angels taught men metallurgy, and were punished for
revealing ’eternal</p>
<p>secrets’. They were also cannibals. The angels that had sinned became
pagan gods, and their women became sirens; but at the last, they were
punished with everlasting torments.</p>
<p>There are descriptions of heaven and hell which have considerable
literary merit. The Last Judgment is performed by ‘the Son of Man, who
hath righteousness’ and who sits on the throne of His glory. Some of the
gentiles, at the last, will repent and be forgiven; but most gentiles,
and all hellenizing Jews, will suffer eternal damnation, for the
righteous will pray for vengeance, and their prayer will be granted.</p>
<p>There is a section on astronomy, where we learn that the sun and moon
have chariots driven by the wind, that the year consists of 364 days,
that human sin causes the heavenly bodies to depart from their courses,
and that only the virtuous can know astronomy. Falling stars are falling
angels, and are punished by the seven archangels.</p>
<p>Next comes sacred history. Up to the Maccabees, this pursues the
course known from the Bible in its earlier portions, and from history in
the later parts. Then the author goes on into the future: the New
Jerusalem, the conversion of the remnant of the gentiles, the
resurrection of the righteous, and the Messiah.</p>
<p>There is a great deal about the punishment of sinners and the reward
of the righteous, who never display an attitude of Christian forgiveness
towards sinners. ‘What will ye do, ye sinners, and whither will ye flee
on that day of judgment, when ye hear the voice of the prayer of the
righteous?’ ‘Sin has not been sent upon the earth, but man of himself
has created it.’ Sins are recorded in heaven. ‘Ye sinners shall be
cursed for ever, and ye shall have no peace.’ Sinners may be happy all
their lives, and even in dying, but their souls descend into Sheol,
where they shall suffer ‘darkness and chains and a burning flame’. But
as for the righteous, ‘I and my Son will be united with them for
ever.’</p>
<p>The last words of the book are: ‘To the faithful he will give
faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. And they shall see
those who were born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous
shall be resplendent. And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them
resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and seasons are
prescribed for them.’</p>
<p>Jews, like Christians, thought much about sin, but few of them
thought of themselves as sinners. This was, in the main, a Christian
innovation, introduced by the parable of the Pharisee and the publican,
and taught as a virtue in Christ’s denunciations of the Scribes and
Pharisees. The Christians endeavoured to practise Christian humility;
the Jews, in general, did not.</p>
<p>There are, however, important exceptions among orthodox Jews just
before the time of Christ. Take, for instance, ‘The Testaments of the
Twelve Patriarchs,’ written between 109 and 107 B.C. by a Pharisee who
admired John Hyrcanus, a high priest of the Hasmonean dynasty. This
book, in the form in which we have it, contains Christian
interpolations, but these are all concerned with dogma. When they are
excised, the ethical teaching remains closely similar to that of the
Gospels. As the Rev. Dr R. H. Charles says: ‘The Sermon on the Mount
reflects in several instances the spirit and even reproduces the very
phrases of our text: many passages in the Gospels exhibit traces of the
same, and St Paul seems to have used the book as a vade mecum’ (op.
cit., pp. 291–2). We find in this book such precepts as the
following:</p>
<p>‘Love ye one another from the heart; and if a man sin against thee,
speak peaceably to him, and in thy soul hold not guile; and if he repent
and confess, forgive him. But if he deny it, do not get into a passion
with him, lest catching the poison from thee he take to swearing, and so
then sin doubly. … And if he be shameless and persist in wrong-doing,
even so forgive him from the heart, and leave to God the avenging.’</p>
<p>Dr Charles is of opinion that Christ must have been acquainted with
this passage. Again we find:</p>
<p>‘Love the Lord and your neighbour.’</p>
<p>‘Love the Lord through all your life, and one another with a true
heart.’</p>
<p>‘I love the Lord; likewise also every man with all my heart.’ These
are to be compared with Matthew xxii, 37–39. There is a reprobation of
all hatred in ‘The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs’; for
instance:</p>
<p>‘Anger is blindness, and does not suffer one to see the face of any
man with truth.’</p>
<p>‘Hatred, therefore, is evil; for it constantly mateth with lying.’
The author of this book, as might be expected, holds that not only the
Jews, but all the gentiles, will be saved.</p>
<p>Christians have learnt from the Gospels to think ill of Pharisees,
yet the author of this book was a Pharisee, and he taught, as we have
seen, those very ethical maxims which we think of as most distinctive of
Christ’s preaching. The explanation, however, is not difficult. In the
first place, he must have been, even in his own day, an exceptional
Pharisee; the more usual doctrine was, no doubt, that of the Book of
Enoch. In the second place, we know that all movements tend to ossify;
who could infer the principles of Jefferson from those of the Daughters
of the American Revolution? In the third place, we know, as regards the
Pharisees in particular, that their devotion to the Law, as the absolute
and final truth, soon put an end to all fresh and living thought and
feeling among them. As Dr Charles says:</p>
<p>‘When Pharisaism, breaking with the ancient ideals of its party,
committed itself to political interests and movements, and concurrently
therewith surrendered itself more and more wholly to the study of the
letter of the Law, it soon ceased to offer scope for the development of
such a lofty system of ethics as the Testaments [of the Patriarchs]
attest, and so the true successors of the early Hasids and their
teaching quitted Judaism and found their natural home in the bosom of
primitive Christianity.’</p>
<p>After a period of rule by the High Priests, Mark Antony made his
friend Herod King of the Jews. Herod was a gay adventurer, often on the
verge of bankruptcy, accustomed to Roman society, and very far removed
from Jewish piety. His wife was of the family of the high priests, but
he was an Idumæan, which alone would suffice to make him an object of
suspicion to the Jews. He was a skilful time-server, and deserted Antony
promptly when it became evident that Octavius was going to be
victorious. However, he made strenuous attempts to reconcile the Jews to
his rule. He rebuilt the Temple, though in a hellenistic style, with
rows of Corinthian pillars; but he placed over the main gate a large
golden eagle, thereby infringing the second Commandment. When it was
rumoured that he was dying, the Pharisees pulled down the eagle, but he,
in revenge, caused a number of them to be put to death. He died in 4
B.C., and soon after his death the Romans abolished the kingship,
putting Judea under a procurator. Pontius Pilate, who became procurator
in A.D. 26, was tactless, and was soon retired.</p>
<p>In A.D. 66, the Jews, led by the party of the Zealots, rebelled
against Rome. They were defeated, and Jerusalem was captured in A.D. 70.
The Temple was destroyed, and few Jews were left in Judea.</p>
<p>The Jews of the Dispersion had become important centuries before this
time. The Jews had been originally an almost wholly agricultural people,
but they learnt trading from the Babylonians during the captivity. Many
of them remained in Babylon after the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, and
among these some were very rich. After the foundation of Alexandria,
great numbers of Jews settled in that city; they had a special quarter
assigned to them, not as a ghetto, but to keep them from danger of
pollution by contact with gentiles. The Alexandrian Jews became much
more hellenized than those of Judea, and forgot Hebrew. For this reason
it became necessary to translate the Old Testament into Greek; the
result was the Septuagint. The Pentateuch was translated in the middle
of the third century B.C.; the other parts somewhat later.</p>
<p>Legends arose about the Septuagint, so called because it was the work
of seventy translators. It was said that each of the seventy translated
the whole independently, and that when the versions were compared they
were found to be identical down to the smallest detail, having all been
divinely inspired. Nevertheless, later scholarship showed that the
Septuagint was gravely defective. The Jews, after the rise of
Christianity, made little use of it, but reverted to reading the Old
Testament in Hebrew. The early Christians, on the contrary, few of whom
knew Hebrew, depended upon the Septuagint, or upon translations from it
into Latin. A better text was produced by the labours of Origen in the
third century, but those who only knew Latin had very defective versions
until Jerome, in the fifth century, produced the Vulgate. This was, at
first, received with much criticism, because he had been helped by Jews
in establishing the text, and many Christians thought that Jews had
deliberately falsified the prophets in order that they should not seem
to foretell Christ. Gradually, however, the work of St Jerome was
accepted, and it remains to this day authoritative in the Catholic
Church.</p>
<p>The philosopher Philo, who was a contemporary of Christ, is the best
illustration of Greek influence on the Jews in the sphere of thought.
While orthodox in religion, Philo is, in philosophy, primarily a
Platonist; other important influences are those of the Stoics and
Neo-pythagoreans. While his influence among the Jews ceased after the
fall of Jerusalem, the Christian Fathers found that he had shown the way
to reconcile Greek philosophy with acceptance of the Hebrew
Scriptures.</p>
<p>In every important city of antiquity there came to be considerable
colonies of Jews, who shared with the representatives of other Eastern
religions an influence upon those who were not content either with
scepticism or with the official religions of Greece and Rome. Many
converts were made to Judaism, not only in the Empire, but also in South
Russia. It was probably to Jewish and semi-Jewish circles that
Christianity first appealed. Orthodox Judaism, however, became more
orthodox and more narrow after the fall of Jerusalem, just as it had
done after the earlier fall due to Nebuchadrezzar. After the first
century, Christianity also crystallized, and the relations of Judaism
and Christianity were wholly hostile and external; as we shall see,
Christianity powerfully stimulated anti-Semitism. Throughout the Middle
Ages, Jews had no part in the culture of Christian countries, and were
too severely persecuted to be able to make contributions to
civilization, beyond supplying capital for the building of cathedrals
and such enterprises. It was only among the Mohammedans, at that period,
that Jews were treated humanely, and were able to pursue philosophy and
enlightened speculation.</p>
<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, the Mohammedans were more civilized and
more humane than the Christians. Christians persecuted Jews, especially
at times of religious excitement; the Crusades were associated with
appalling pogroms. In Mohammedan countries, on the contrary, Jews at
most times were not in any way ill treated. Especially in Moorish Spain,
they contributed to learning; Maimonides (1135–1204), who was born at
Cordova, is regarded by some as the source of much of Spinoza’s
philosophy. When the Christians reconquered Spain, it was largely the
Jews who transmitted to them the learning of the Moors. Learned Jews,
who knew Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic, and were acquainted with the
philosophy of Aristotle, imparted their knowledge to less learned
schoolmen. They transmitted also less desirable things, such as alchemy
and astrology.</p>
<p>After the Middle Ages, the Jews still contributed largely to
civilization as individuals, but no longer as a race.</p>
