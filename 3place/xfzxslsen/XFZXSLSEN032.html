<h4 id="the-roman-empire-in-relation-to-culture">29 THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN
RELATION TO CULTURE</h4>
<p>The Roman Empire affected the history of culture in various more or
less separate ways.</p>
<p>First: there is the direct effect of Rome on Hellenistic thought.
This is not very important or profound.</p>
<p>Second: the effect of Greece and the East on the western half of the
empire. This was profound and lasting, since it included the Christian
religion.</p>
<p>Third: the importance of the long Roman peace in diffusing culture
and in accustoming men to the idea of a single civilization associated
with a single government.</p>
<p>Fourth: the transmission of Hellenistic civilization to the
Mohammedans, and thence ultimately to western Europe.</p>
<p>Before considering these influences of Rome, a very brief synopsis of
the political history will be useful.</p>
<p>Alexander’s conquests had left the western Mediterranean untouched;
it was dominated, at the beginning of the third century B.C., by two
powerful City States, Carthage and Syracuse. In the first and second
Punic Wars (264–241 and 218–201), Rome conquered Syracuse and reduced
Carthage to insignificance. During the second century, Rome conquered
the Macedonian monarchies—Egypt, it is true, lingered on as a vassal
state until the death of Cleopatra (30 B.C.). Spain was conquered as an
incident in the war with Hannibal; France was conquered by Caesar in the
middle of the first century B.C., and England was conquered about a
hundred years later. The frontiers of the Empire, in its great days,
were the Rhine and Danube in Europe, the Euphrates in Asia, and the
desert in North Africa.</p>
<p>Roman imperialism was, perhaps, at its best in North Africa
(important in Christian history as the home of Saint Cyprian and Saint
Augustine), where large areas, uncultivated before and after Roman
times, were rendered fertile and supported populous cities. The Roman
Empire was on the whole stable and peaceful for over two hundred years,
from the accession of Augustus (30 B.C.) until the disasters of the
third century.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the constitution of the Roman State had undergone important
developments. Originally Rome was a small City State, not very unlike
those of Greece, especially such as, like Sparta, did not depend upon
foreign commerce. Kings, like those of Homeric Greece, had been
succeeded by an aristocratic republic. Gradually, while the aristocratic
element, embodied in the Senate, remained powerful, democratic elements
were added; the resulting compromise was regarded by Panaetius the Stoic
(whose views are reproduced by Polybius and Cicero) as an ideal
combination of monarchical, aristocratic, and democratic elements. But
conquest upset the precarious balance; it brought immense new wealth to
the senatorial class, and, in a slightly lesser degree, to the
‘knights’, as the upper middle class were called. Italian agriculture,
which had been in the hands of small farmers growing grain by their own
labour and that of their families, came to be a matter of huge estates
belonging to the Roman aristocracy, where vines and olives were
cultivated by slave labour. The result was the virtual omnipotence of
the Senate, which was used shamelessly for the enrichment of
individuals, without regard for the interests of the State or the
welfare of its subjects.</p>
<p>A democratic movement, inaugurated by the Gracchi in the latter half
of the second century B.C., led to a series of civil wars, and
finally—as so often in Greece—to the establishment of a ‘tyranny’. It is
curious to see the repetition, on such a vast scale, of developments
which, in Greece, had been confined to minute areas. Augustus, the heir
and adopted son of Julius Caesar, who reigned from 30 B.C. to A.D. 14,
put an end to civil strife, and (with few exceptions) to external wars
of conquest. For the first time since the beginnings of Greek
civilization, the ancient world enjoyed peace and security.</p>
<p>Two things had ruined the Greek political system: first, the claim of
each city to absolute sovereignty; second, the bitter and bloody strife
between rich and poor within most cities. After the conquest of Carthage
and the Hellenistic kingdoms, the first of these causes no longer
afflicted the world, since no effective resistance to Rome was possible.
But the second cause remained. In the civil wars, one general would
proclaim himself the champion of the Senate, the other of the people.
Victory went to the one who offered the highest rewards to the soldiers.
The soldiers wanted not only pay and plunder, but grants of land;
therefore each civil war ended in the formally legal expulsion of many
existing landholders, who were nominally tenants of the State, to make
room for the legionaries of the victor. The expenses of the war, while
in progress, were defrayed by executing rich men and confiscating their
property. This system, disastrous as it was, could not easily be ended;
at last, to every one’s surprise, Augustus was so completely victorious
that no competitor remained to challenge his claim to power.</p>
<p>To the Roman world, the discovery that the period of civil war was
ended came as a surprise, which was a cause of rejoicing to all except a
small senatorial party. To every one else, it was a profound relief when
Rome, under Augustus, at last achieved the stability and order which
Greeks and Macedonians had sought in vain, and which Rome, before
Augustus, had also failed to produce. In Greece, according to
Rostovtseff, republican Rome had ‘introduced nothing new, except
pauperization, bankruptcy, and a stoppage of all independent political
activity’.1</p>
<p>The reign of Augustus was a period of happiness for the Roman Empire.
The administration of the provinces was at last organized with some
regard to the welfare of the population, and not on a purely predatory
system. Augustus was not only officially deified after his death, but
was spontaneously regarded as a god in various provincial cities. Poets
praised him, the commercial classes found the universal peace
convenient, and even the Senate, which he treated with all the outward
forms of respect, lost no opportunity of heaping honours and offices on
his head.</p>
<p>But although the world was happy, some savour had gone out of life,
since safety had been preferred to adventure. In early times, every free
Greek had had the opportunity of adventure; Philip and Alexander put an
end to this state of affairs, and in the Hellenistic world only
Macedonian dynasts enjoyed anarchic freedom. The Greek world lost its
youth, and became either cynical or religious. The hope of embodying
ideals in earthly institutions faded, and with it the best men lost
their zest. Heaven, for Socrates, was a place where he could go on
arguing; for philosophers after Alexander, it was something more
different from their existence here below.</p>
<p>In Rome, a similar development came later, and in a less painful
form. Rome was not conquered, as Greece was, but had, on the contrary,
the stimulus of successful imperialism. Throughout the period of the
civil wars, it was Romans who were responsible for the disorders. The
Greeks had not secured peace and order by submitting to the Macedonians,
whereas both Greeks and Romans secured both by submitting to Augustus.
Augustus was a Roman, to whom most Romans submitted willingly, not only
on account of his superior power; moreover he took pains to disguise the
military origin of his government, and to base it upon decrees of the
Senate. The adulation expressed by the Senate was, no doubt, largely
insincere, but outside the senatorial class no one felt humiliated.</p>
<p>The mood of the Romans was like that of a jeune homme rangé in
nineteenth-century France, who, after a life of amatory adventure,
settles down to a marriage of reason. This mood, though contented, is
not creative. The great poets of the Augustan age had been formed in
more troubled times; Horace fled at Philippi, and both he and Virgil
lost their farms in confiscations for the benefit of victorious
soldiers. Augustus, for the sake of stability, set to work, somewhat
insincerely, to restore ancient piety, and was therefore necessarily
rather hostile to free inquiry. The Roman world began to become
stereotyped, and the process continued under later emperors.</p>
<p>The immediate successors of Augustus indulged in appalling cruelties
towards Senators and towards possible competitors for the purple. To
some extent, the misgovernment of this period extended to the provinces;
but in the main the administrative machine created by Augustus continued
to function fairly well.</p>
<p>A better period began with the accession of Trajan in A.D. 98, and
continued until the death of Marcus Aurelius in A.D. 180. During this
time, the government of the Empire was as good as any despotic
government can be. The third century, on the contrary, was one of
appalling disaster. The army realized its power, made and unmade
emperors in return for cash and the promise of a life without warfare,
and ceased, in consequence, to be an effective fighting force. The
barbarians, from north and east, invaded and plundered Roman territory.
The army, preoccupied with private gain and civil discord, was
incompetent in defence. The whole fiscal system broke down, since there
was an immense diminution of resources and, at the same time, a vast
increase of expenditure in unsuccessful war and in bribery of the army.
Pestilence, in addition to war, greatly diminished the population. It
seemed as if the Empire was about to fall.</p>
<p>This result was averted by two energetic men, Diocletian (A.D.
286–305) and Constantine, whose undisputed reign lasted from A.D. 312 to
337. By them the Empire was divided into an eastern and western half,
corresponding, approximately, to the division between Greek and Latin
languages. By Constantine the capital of the eastern half was
established at Byzantium, to which he gave the new name of
Constantinople. Diocletian curbed the army, for a while, by altering its
character; from his time onwards, the most effective fighting forces
were composed of barbarians, chiefly German, to whom all the highest
commands were open. This was obviously a dangerous expedient, and early
in the fifth century it bore its natural fruit. The barbarians decided
that it was more profitable to fight for themselves than for a Roman
master. Nevertheless it served its purpose for over a century.
Diocletian’s administrative reforms were equally successful for a time,
and equally disastrous in the long run. The Roman system was to allow
local self-government to the towns, and to leave their officials to
collect the taxes, of which only the total amount due from any one town
was fixed by the central authorities. This system had worked well enough
in prosperous times, but now, in the exhausted state of the empire, the
revenue demanded was more than could be borne without excessive
hardship. The municipal authorities were personally responsible for the
taxes, and fled to escape payment. Diocletian compelled well-to-do
citizens to accept municipal office, and made flight illegal. From
similar motives he turned the rural population into serfs, tied to the
soil and forbidden to migrate. This system was kept on by later
emperors.</p>
<p>Constantine’s most important innovation was the adoption of
Christianity as the State religion, apparently because a large
proportion of the soldiers were Christian.2 The result of this was that
when, during the fifth century, the Germans destroyed the Western
Empire, its prestige caused them to adopt the Christian religion,
thereby preserving for western Europe so much of ancient civilizations
as had been absorbed by the Church.</p>
<p>The development of the territory assigned to the eastern half of the
Empire was different. The Eastern Empire, though continually diminishing
in extent (except for the transient conquests of Justinian in the sixth
century), survived until 1453, when Constantinople was conquered by the
Turks. But most of what had been Roman provinces in the east, including
also Africa and Spain in the west, became Mohammedan. The Arabs, unlike
the Germans, rejected the religion, but adopted the civilization, of
those whom they had conquered. The Eastern Empire was Greek, not Latin,
in its civilization; accordingly, from the seventh to the eleventh
centuries, it was it and the Arabs who preserved Greek literature and
whatever survived of Greek, as opposed to Latin, civilization. From the
eleventh century onward, at first through Moorish influences, the west
gradually recovered what it had lost of the Grecian heritage.</p>
<p>I come now to the four ways in which the Roman Empire affected the
history of culture.</p>
<p>I. The direct effect of Rome on Greek thought. This begins in the
second century B.C., with two men, the historian Polybius, and the Stoic
philosopher Panaetius. The natural attitude of the Greek to the Roman
was one of contempt mingled with fear; the Greek felt himself more
civilized, but politically less powerful. If the Romans were more
successful in politics, that only showed that politics is an ignoble
pursuit. The average Greek of the second century B.C. was
pleasure-loving, quick-witted, clever in business, and unscrupulous in
all things. There were, however, still men of philosophic capacity. Some
of these—notably the sceptics, such as Carneades—had allowed cleverness
to destroy seriousness. Some, like the Epicureans and a section of the
Stoics, had</p>
<p>withdrawn wholly into a quiet private life. But a few, with more
insight than had been shown by Aristotle in relation to Alexander,
realized that the greatness of Rome was due to certain merits which were
lacking among the Greeks.</p>
<p>The historian Polybius, born in Arcadia about 200 B.C., was sent to
Rome as a prisoner, and there had the good fortune to become the friend
of the younger Scipio, whom he accompanied on many of his campaigns. It
was uncommon for a Greek to know Latin, though most educated Romans knew
Greek; the circumstances of Polybius, however, led him to a thorough
familiarity with Latin. He wrote, for the benefit of the Greeks, the
history of the later Punic Wars, which enabled Rome to conquer the
world. His admiration of the Roman constitution was becoming out of date
while he wrote, but until his time it had compared very favourably, in
stability and efficiency, with the continually changing constitutions of
most Greek cities. The Romans naturally read his history with pleasure;
whether the Greeks did so is more doubtful.</p>
<p>Panaetius the Stoic has been already considered in the preceding
chapter. He was a friend of Polybius, and, like him, a protégé of the
younger Scipio. While Scipio lived, he was frequently in Rome, but after
Scipio’s death in 129 B.C. he stayed in Athens as head of the Stoic
school. Rome still had, what Greece had lost, the hopefulness connected
with the opportunity for political activity. Accordingly the doctrines
of Panaetius were more political, and less akin to those of the Cynics,
than were those of earlier Stoics. Probably the admiration of Plato felt
by cultivated Romans influenced him in abandoning the dogmatic
narrowness of his Stoic predecessors. In the broader form given to it by
him and by his successor Posidonius, Stoicism strongly appealed to the
more serious among the Romans.</p>
<p>At a later date, Epictetus, though a Greek, lived most of his life in
Rome. Rome supplied him with most of his illustrations; he is always
exhorting the wise man not to tremble in the presence of the Emperor. We
know the influence of Epictetus on Marcus Aurelius, but his influence on
the Greeks is hard to trace.</p>
<p>Plutarch (ca. A.D. 46–120), in his Lives of the Noble Grecians and
Romans, traced a parallelism between the most eminent men of the two
countries. He spent a considerable time in Rome, and was honoured by the
Emperors Hadrian and Trajan. In addition to his Lives, he wrote numerous
works on philosophy, religion, natural history, and morals. His Lives
are obviously concerned to reconcile Greece and Rome in men’s
thoughts.</p>
<p>On the whole, apart from such exceptional men, Rome acted as a blight
on the Greek-speaking part of the Empire. Thought and art alike
declined. Until the end of the second century A.D., life, for the
well-to-do, was pleasant and easy-going; there was no incentive to
strenuousness, and little opportunity for great achievement. The
recognized schools of philosophy—the Academy, the Peripatetics, the
Epicureans, and the Stoics—continued to exist until they were closed by
Justinian. None of these, however, showed any vitality throughout the
time after Marcus Aurelius, except the Neoplatonists in the third
century A.D., whom we shall consider in the next chapter; and these men
were hardly at all influenced by Rome. The Latin and Greek halves of the
Empire became more and more divergent; the knowledge of Greek became
rare in the west, and after Constantine Latin, in the east, survived
only in law and in the army.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>The influence of Greece and the East on Rome. There are here two
very different things to consider: first, the influence of Hellenic art
and literature and philosophy on the most cultivated Romans; second, the
spread of non-Hellenic religions and superstitions throughout the
Western world.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>When the Romans first came in contact with Greeks, they became aware
of themselves as comparatively barbarous and uncouth. The Greeks were
immeasurably their superiors in many ways: in manufacture and in the
technique of agriculture; in the kinds of knowledge that are necessary
for a good official; in conversation and the art of enjoying life; in
art and literature and philosophy. The only things in which the Romans
were superior were military tactics and social cohesion. The relation of
the Romans to the Greeks was something like that of the Prussians to the
French in 1814 and 1815; but this latter was temporary, whereas the
other lasted a long time. After the Punic Wars, young Romans conceived
an admiration for the Greeks. They learnt the Greek language, they
copied Greek architecture, they employed Greek sculptors. The Roman gods
were identified with the gods of Greece. The Trojan origin of the Romans
was invented to make a connection with the Homeric myths. Latin poets
adopted Greek metres, Latin philosophers took over Greek theories. To
the end, Rome was culturally parasitic on Greece. The Romans invented no
art forms, constructed no original system of philosophy, and made no
scientific discoveries. They made good roads, systematic legal codes,
and efficient armies; for the rest they looked to Greece.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hellenizing of Rome brought with it a certain softening of
manners, abhorrent to the elder Cato. Until the Punic Wars, the Romans
had been a bucolic people, with the virtues and vices of farmers:
austere, industrious, brutal, obstinate, and stupid. Their family life
had been stable and solidly built on the patria potestas; women and
young people were completely sub-ordinated. All this changed with the
influx of sudden wealth. The small farms disappeared, and were gradually
replaced by huge estates on which slave labour was employed to carry out
new scientific kinds of agriculture. A great class of traders grew up,
and a large number of men enriched by plunder, like the nabobs in
eighteenth-century England. Women, who had been virtuous slaves, became
free and dissolute; divorce became common; the rich ceased to have
children. The Greeks, who had gone through a similar development
centuries ago, encouraged, by their example, what historians call the
decay of morals. Even in the most dissolute times of the Empire, the
average Roman still thought of Rome as the upholder of a purer ethical
standard against the decadent corruption of Greece.</p>
<p>The cultural influence of Greece on the Western Empire diminished
rapidly from the third century A.D. onwards, chiefly because culture in
general decayed. For this there were many causes, but one in particular
must be mentioned. In the last times of the Western Empire, the
government was more undisguisedly a military tyranny than it had been,
and the army usually selected a successful general as emperor; but the
army, even in its highest ranks, was no longer composed of cultivated
Romans, but of semi-barbarians from the frontier. These rough soldiers
had no use for culture, and regarded the civilized citizens solely as
sources of revenue. Private persons were too impoverished to support
much in the way of education, and the State considered education
unnecessary. Consequently, in the West, only a few men of exceptional
learning continued to read Greek.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Non-Hellenic religion and superstition, on the contrary, acquired,
as time went on, a firmer and firmer hold on the West. We have already
seen how Alexander’s conquests introduced the Greek world to the beliefs
of Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians. Similarly the Roman conquests
made the Western world familiar with these doctrines, and also with
those of Jews and Christians. I shall consider what concerns the Jews
and Christians at a later stage; for the present, I shall confine myself
as far as possible to pagan superstitions.3</li>
</ol>
<p>In Rome every sect and every prophet was represented, and sometimes
won favour in the highest government circles. Lucian, who stood for sane
scepticism in spite of the credulity of his age, tells an amusing story,
generally accepted as broadly true, about a prophet and miracle-worker
called Alexander the Paphlagonian. This man healed the sick and foretold
the future, with excursions into blackmail. His fame reached the ears of
Marcus Aurelius, then fighting the Marcomanni on the Danube. The Emperor
consulted him as to how to win the war, and was told that if he threw
two lions into the Danube a great victory would result. He followed the
advice of the seer, but it was the Marcomanni who won the great victory.
In spite of this mishap, Alexander’s fame continued to grow. A prominent
Roman of consular rank, Rutilianus, after consulting him on many points,
at last sought his advice as to the choice of a wife. Alexander, like
Endymion, had enjoyed the favours of the moon, and by her had a
daughter, whom the oracle recommended to Rutilianus.</p>
<p>’Rutilianus, who was at the time sixty years old, at once complied
with the divine injunction, and celebrated his marriage by sacrificing
whole hecatombs to his celestial mother-in-law.’4</p>
<p>More important than the career of Alexander the Paphlagonian was the
reign of the Emperor Elagabalus or Heliogabalus (A.D. 218–22), who was,
until his elevation by the choice of the army, a Syrian priest of the
sun. In his slow progress from Syria to Rome, he was preceded by his
portrait, sent as a present to the Senate. ’He was drawn in his
sacerdotal robes of silk and gold, after the loose flowing fashion of
the Medes and Phoenicians; his head was covered with a lofty tiara, his
numerous collars and bracelets were adorned with gems of inestimable
value. His eyebrows were tinged with black, and his cheeks painted with
an artificial red and white. The grave senators confessed with a sigh,
that, after having long experienced the stern tyranny of their own
countrymen, Rome was at length humbled beneath the effeminate luxury of
Oriental despotism.’5 Supported by a large section in the army, he
proceeded, with fanatical zeal, to introduce in Rome the religious
practices of the East; his name was that of the sun-god worshipped at
Emesa, where he had been chief priest. His mother, or grandmother, who
was the real ruler, perceived that he had gone too far, and deposed him
in favour of her nephew Alexander (222–35), whose Oriental proclivities
were more moderate. The mixture of creeds that was possible in his day
was illustrated in his private chapel, in which he placed the statues of
Abraham, Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, and Christ.</p>
<p>The religion of Mithras, which was of Persian origin, was a close
competitor of Christianity, especially during the latter half of the
third century A.D. The emperors, who were making desperate attempts to
control the army, felt that religion might give a much needed stability;
but it would have to be one of the new religions, since it was these
that the soldiers favoured. The cult was introduced at Rome, and had
much to commend it to the military mind. Mithras was a sun-god, but not
so effeminate as his Syrian colleague; he was a god concerned with war,
the great war between good and evil which had been part of the Persian
creed since Zoroaster. Rostovtseff6 reproduces a basrelief representing
his worship, which was found in a subterranean sanctuary at Heddernheim
in Germany, and shows that his disciples must have been numerous among
the soldiers, not only in the East, but in the West also.</p>
<p>Constantine’s adoption of Christianity was politically successful,
whereas earlier attempts to introduce a new religion failed; but the
earlier attempts were, from a governmental point of view, very similar
to his. All alike derived</p>
<p>their possibility of success from the misfortunes and weariness of
the Roman world. The traditional religions of Greece and Rome were
suited to men interested in the terrestrial world, and hopeful of
happiness on earth. Asia, with a longer experience of despair, had
evolved more successful antidotes in the form of other-worldly hopes; of
all these, Christianity was the most effective in bringing consolation.
But Christianity, by the time it became the State religion, had absorbed
much from Greece, and transmitted this, along with the Judaic element,
to succeeding ages in the West.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>The unification of government and culture. We owe it first to
Alexander and then to Rome that the achievements of the great age of
Greece were not lost to the world, like those of the Minoan age. In the
fifth century B.C., a Jenghiz Khan, if one had happened to arise, could
have wiped out all that was important in the Hellenic world; Xerxes,
with a little more competence, might have made Greek civilization very
greatly inferior to what it became after he was repulsed. Consider the
period from Aeschylus to Plato: all that was done in this time was done
by a minority of the population of a few commercial cities. These
cities, as the future showed, had no great capacity for withstanding
foreign conquest, but by an extraordinary stroke of good fortune their
conquerors, Macedonian and Roman, were Philhellenes, and did not destroy
what they conquered, as Xerxes or Carthage would have done. The fact
that we are acquainted with what was done by the Greeks in art and
literature and philosophy and science is due to the stability introduced
by Western conquerors who had the good sense to admire the civilization
which they governed but did their utmost to preserve.</li>
</ol>
<p>In certain respects, political and ethical, Alexander and the Romans
were the causes of a better philosophy than any that was professed by
Greeks in their days of freedom. The Stoics, as we have seen, believed
in the brotherhood of man, and did not confine their sympathies to the
Greeks. The long dominion of Rome accustomed men to the idea of a single
civilization under a single government. We are aware that there were
important parts of the world which were not subject to Rome—India and
China, more especially. But to the Roman it seemed that outside the
Empire there were only more or less barbarian tribes, who might be
conquered whenever it should be worth while to make the effort.
Essentially and in idea, the empire, in the minds of the Romans, was
world-wide. This conception descended to the Church, which was
‘Catholic’ in spite of Buddhists, Confucians, and (later) Mohammedans.
Securus judicat orbis terrarum is a maxim of St Augustine’s embodying
the doctrine of the later Stoics; it owes its appeal to the apparent
universality of the Roman Empire. Throughout the Middle Ages, after the
time of Charlemagne, the Church and the Holy Roman Empire were worldwide
in idea, although everybody knew that they were not so in fact. The
conception of one human family, one Catholic religion, one universal
culture, and one world-wide State, has haunted men’s thoughts ever since
its approximate realization by Rome.</p>
<p>The part played by Rome in enlarging the area of civilization was of
immense importance. Northern Italy, Spain, France, and parts of western
Germany, were civilized as a result of forcible conquest by the Roman
legions. All these regions proved themselves just as capable of a high
level of culture as Rome itself. In the last days of the Western Empire,
Gaul produced men who were at least the equals of their contemporaries
in regions of older civilization. It was owing to the diffusion of
culture by Rome that the barbarians produced only a temporary eclipse,
not a permanent darkness. It may be argued that the quality of
civilization was never again as good as in the Athens of Pericles; but
in a world of war and destruction, quantity is, in the long run, almost
as important as quality, and quantity was due to Rome.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>The Mohammedans as vehicles of Hellenism. In the seventh century,
the disciples of the Prophet conquered Syria, Egypt, and North Africa;
in the following century, they conquered Spain. Their victories were
easy, and the fighting was slight. Except possibly during the first few
years, they were not fanatical; Christians and Jews were unmolested so
long as they paid the tribute. Very soon the Arabs acquired the
civilization of the Eastern Empire, but with the hopefulness of a rising
polity instead of the weariness of decline. Their learned men read Greek
authors in translation, and wrote commentaries. Aristotle’s reputation
is mainly due to them; in antiquity, he was not regarded as on a level
with Plato.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is instructive to consider some of the words that we derive from
Arabic, such as: algebra, alcohol, alchemy, alembic, alkali, azimuth,
zenith. With the exception of ‘alcohol’—which meant, not a drink, but a
substance used in chemistry—these words would give a good picture of
some of the things we owe to the Arabs. Algebra had been invented by the
Alexandrian Greeks, but was carried further by the Mohammedans.
‘Alchemy’, ‘alembic’, ‘alkali’ are words connected with the attempt to
turn base metals into gold, which the Arabs took over from the Greeks,
and in pursuit of which they appealed to Greek philosophy.7 ‘Azimuth’
and ‘zenith’ are astronomical terms, chiefly useful to the Arabs in
connection with astrology.</p>
<p>The etymological method conceals what we owe to the Arabs as regards
knowledge of Greek philosophy, because, when it was again studied in
Europe, the technical terms required were taken from Greek or Latin. In
philosophy, the Arabs were better as commentators than as original
thinkers. Their importance, for us, is that they, and not the
Christians, were the</p>
<p>immediate inheritors of those parts of the Greek tradition which only
the Eastern Empire had kept alive. Contact with the Mohammedans, in
Spain, and to a lesser extent in Sicily, made the West aware of
Aristotle; also of Arabic numerals, algebra, and chemistry. It was this
contact that began the revival of learning in the eleventh century,
leading to the Scholastic philosophy. It was later, from the thirteenth
century onward, that the study of Greek enabled men to go direct to the
works of Plato and Aristotle and other Greek writers of antiquity. But
if the Arabs had not preserved the tradition, the men of the Renaissance
might not have suspected how much was to be gained by the revival of
classical learning.</p>
