<h4 id="the-reformation-and-counter-reformation">5 THE REFORMATION AND
COUNTER-REFORMATION</h4>
<p>The Reformation and Counter-Reformation, alike, represent the
rebellion of less civilized nations against the intellectual domination
of Italy. In the case of the Reformation, the revolt was also political
and theological: the authority of the Pope was rejected, and the tribute
which he had obtained from the power of the keys ceased to be paid. In
the case of the Counter-Reformation, there was only revolt against the
intellectual and moral freedom of Renaissance Italy; the power of the
Pope was not diminished, but enhanced, while at the same time it was
made clear that his authority was incompatible with the easy-going
laxity of the Borgias and Medici. Roughly speaking, the Reformation was
German, the Counter-Reformation Spanish; the wars of religion were at
the same time wars between Spain and its enemies, coinciding in date
with the period when Spanish power was at its height.</p>
<p>The attitude of public opinion in northern nations towards
Renaissance Italy is illustrated in the English saying of that time:</p>
<p>An Englishman Italianate</p>
<p>Is a devil incarnate.</p>
<p>It will be observed how many of the villains in Shakespeare are
Italians. Iago is perhaps the most prominent instance, but an even more
illustrative one is Iachimo in Cymbeline, who leads astray the virtuous
Briton travelling in Italy, and comes to England to practise his wicked
wiles upon unsuspecting natives. Moral indignation against Italians had
much to do with the Reformation. Unfortunately it involved also
intellectual repudiation of what Italy had done for civilization.</p>
<p>The three great men of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation are
Luther, Calvin and Loyola. All three, intellectually, are medieval in
philosophy, as compared either to the Italians who immediately preceded
them, or to such men as Erasmus and More. Philosophically, the century
following the beginning of the Reformation is a barren one. Luther and
Calvin reverted to St Augustine, retaining, however, only that part of
his teaching which deals with the relation of the soul to God, not the
part which is concerned with the Church. Their theology was such as to
diminish the power of the Church. They abolished purgatory, from which
the souls of the dead could be delivered by masses. They rejected the
doctrine of Indulgences, upon which a large part of the papal revenue
depended. By the doctrine of predestination, the fate of the soul after
death was made wholly independent of the actions of priests. These
innovations, while they helped in the struggle with the Pope, prevented
the Protestant Churches from becoming as powerful in Protestant
countries as the Catholic Church was in Catholic countries. Protestant
divines were (at least at first) just as bigoted as Catholic
theologians, but they had less power, and were therefore less able to do
harm.</p>
<p>Almost from the very beginning, there was a division among
Protestants as to the power of the State in religious matters. Luther
was willing, wherever the prince was Protestant, to recognize him as
head of the Church in his own country. In England, Henry VIII and
Elizabeth vigorously asserted their claims in this respect, and so did
the Protestant princes of Germany, Scandinavia, and (after the revolt
from Spain) Holland. This accelerated the already existing tendency to
increase in the power of kings.</p>
<p>But those Protestants who took seriously the individualistic aspects
of the Reformation were as unwilling to submit to the king as to the
Pope. The Anabaptists in Germany were suppressed, but their doctrine
spread to Holland and England. The conflict between Cromwell and the
Long Parliament had many aspects; in its theological aspect, it was in
part a conflict between those who rejected and those who accepted the
view that the State should decide in religious matters. Gradually
weariness resulting from the wars of religion led to the growth of
belief in religious toleration, which was one of the sources of the
movement which developed into eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
liberalism.</p>
<p>Protestant success, at first amazingly rapid, was checked mainly as a
resultant of Loyola’s creation of the Jesuit order. Loyola had been a
soldier, and his order was founded on military models; there must be
unquestioning obedience to the General, and every Jesuit was to consider
himself engaged in warfare against heresy. As early as the Council of
Trent, the Jesuits began to be influential. They were disciplined, able,
completely devoted to the cause, and skilful propagandists. Their
theology was the opposite of that of the Protestants; they rejected
those elements of St Augustine’s teaching which the Protestants
emphasized. They believed in free will, and opposed predestination.
Salvation was not by faith alone, but by both faith and works. The
Jesuits acquired prestige by their missionary zeal, especially in the
Far East. They became popular as confessors, because (if Pascal is to be
believed) they were more lenient, except towards heresy, than other
ecclesiastics. They concentrated on education, and thus acquired a firm
hold on the minds of the young. Whenever theology did not interfere, the
education they gave was the best obtainable; we shall see that they
taught Descartes more mathematics than he would have learnt elsewhere.
Politically, they were a single united disciplined body, shrinking from
no dangers and no exertions; they urged Catholic princes to practise
relentless persecution, and, following in the wake of conquering Spanish
armies, re-established the terror of the Inquisition, even in Italy,
which had had nearly a century of free-thought.</p>
<p>The results of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, in the
intellectual sphere, were at first wholly bad, but ultimately
beneficial. The Thirty Years’ War persuaded everybody that neither
Protestants nor Catholics could be completely victorious; it became
necessary to abandon the medieval hope of doctrinal unity, and this
increased men’s freedom to think for themselves, even about
fundamentals. The diversity of creeds in different countries made it
possible to escape persecution by living abroad. Disgust with
theological warfare turned the attention of able men increasingly to
secular learning, especially mathematics and science. These are among
the reasons for the fact that, while the sixteenth century, after the
rise of Luther is philosophically barren, the seventeenth contains the
greatest names and makes the most notable advance since Greek times.
This advance began in science, with which I shall deal in my next
chapter.</p>
