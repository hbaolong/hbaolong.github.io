<h4 id="the-milesian-school">2 THE MILESIAN SCHOOL</h4>
<p>In every history of philosophy for students, the first thing
mentioned is that philosophy began with Thales, who said that everything
is made of water. This is discouraging to the beginner, who is
struggling—perhaps not very hard—to feel that respect for philosophy
which the curriculum seems to expect. There is, however, ample reason to
feel respect for Thales, though perhaps rather as a man of science than
as a philosopher in the modern sense of the word.</p>
<p>Thales was a native of Miletus, in Asia Minor, a flourishing
commercial city, in which there was a large slave population, and a
bitter class struggle between the rich and poor among the free
population. ’At Miletus the people were at first victorious and murdered
the wives and children of the aristocrats; then the aristocrats
prevailed and burned their opponents alive, lighting up the open spaces
of the city with live torches.’1 Similar conditions prevailed in most of
the cities of Asia Minor at the time of Thales.</p>
<p>Miletus, like other commercial cities of Ionia, underwent important
economic and political developments during the seventh and sixth
centuries. At first, political power belonged to a landowning
aristocracy, but this was gradually replaced by a plutocracy of
merchants. They, in turn, were replaced by a tyrant, who (as was usual)
achieved power by the support of the democratic party. The kingdom of
Lydia lay to the east of the Greek coast towns, but remained on friendly
terms with them until the fall of Nineveh (606 B.C.). This left Lydia
free to turn its attention to the West, but Miletus usually succeeded in
preserving friendly relations, especially with Croesus, the last Lydian
king, who was conquered by Cyrus in 546 B.C. There were also</p>
<p>important relations with Egypt, where the king depended upon Greek
mercenaries, and had opened certain cities to Greek trade. The first
Greek settlement in Egypt was a fort occupied by a Milesian garrison;
but the most important, during the period 610–560 B.C., was Daphnae.
Here Jeremiah and many other Jewish fugitives took refuge from
Nebuchadrezzar (Jeremiah xliii, 5 ff); but while Egypt undoubtedly
influenced the Greeks, the Jews did not, nor can we suppose that
Jeremiah felt anything but horror towards the sceptical Ionians.</p>
<p>As regards the date of Thales, the best evidence, as we saw, is that
he was famous for predicting an eclipse which, according to the
astronomers, must have taken place in 585 B.C. Other evidence, such as
it is, agrees in placing his activities at about this time. It is no
proof of extraordinary genius on his part to have predicted an eclipse.
Miletus was allied with Lydia, and Lydia had cultural relations with
Babylonia, and Babylonian astronomers had discovered that eclipses recur
in a cycle of about nineteen years. They could predict eclipses of the
moon with pretty complete success, but as regards solar eclipses they
were hampered by the fact that an eclipse may be visible in one place
and not in another. Consequently they could only know that at such and
such a date it was worth while to look out for an eclipse, and this is
probably all that Thales knew. Neither he nor they knew why there is
this cycle.</p>
<p>Thales is said to have travelled in Egypt, and to have thence brought
to the Greeks the science of geometry. What the Egyptians knew of
geometry was mainly rules of thumb, and there is no reason to believe
that Thales arrived at deductive proofs, such as later Greeks
discovered. He seems to have discovered how to calculate the distance of
a ship at sea from observations taken at two points on land, and how to
estimate the height of a pyramid from the length of its shadow. Many
other geometrical theorems are attributed to him, but probably
wrongly.</p>
<p>He was one of the Seven Wise men of Greece, each of whom was
specially noted for one wise saying; his it is a mistake to suppose was
‘water is best’.</p>
<p>According to Aristotle, he thought that water is the original
substance, out of which all others are formed; and he maintained that
the earth rests on water. Aristotle also says of him that he said the
magnet has a soul in it, because it moves the iron; further, that all
things are full of gods.2</p>
<p>The statement that everything is made of water is to be regarded as a
scientific hypothesis, and by no means a foolish one. Twenty years ago,
the received view was that everything is made of hydrogen, which is two
thirds of water. The Greeks were rash in their hypotheses, but the
Milesian school, at least, was prepared to test them empirically. Too
little is known of Thales to</p>
<p>make it possible to reconstruct him at all satisfactorily, but of his
successors in Miletus much more is known, and it is reasonable to
suppose that something of their outlook came from him. His science and
his philosophy were both crude, but they were such as to stimulate both
thought and observation.</p>
<p>There are many legends about him, but I do not think more is known
than the few facts I have mentioned. Some of the stories are pleasant,
for instance, the one told by Aristotle in his Politics (1259a): ‘He was
reproached for his poverty, which was supposed to show that philosophy
is of no use. According to the story, he knew by his skill in the stars
while it was yet winter that there would be a great harvest of olives in
the coming year; so, having a little money, he gave deposits for the use
of all the olive-presses in Chios and Miletus, which he hired at a low
price because no one bid against him. When the harvest time came, and
many were wanted all at once and of a sudden, he let them out at any
rate which he pleased, and made a quantity of money. Thus he showed the
world that philosophers can easily be rich if they like, but that their
ambition is of another sort.’</p>
<p>Anaximander, the second philosopher of the Milesian school, is much
more interesting than Thales. His dates are uncertain, but he was said
to have been sixty-four years old in 546 B.C., and there is reason to
suppose that this is somewhere near the truth. He held that all things
come from a single primal substance, but that it is not water, as Thales
held, or any other of the substances that we know. It is infinite,
eternal and ageless, and ‘it encompasses all the worlds’—for he thought
our world only one of many. The primal substance is transformed into the
various substances with which we are familiar, and these are transformed
into each other. As to this, he makes an important and remarkable
statement:</p>
<p>‘Into that from which things take their rise they pass away once
more, as is ordained, for they make reparation and satisfaction to one
another for their injustice according to the ordering of time.’</p>
<p>The idea of justice, both cosmic and human, played a part in Greek
religion and philosophy which is not altogether easy for a modern to
understand; indeed our word ‘justice’ hardly expresses what is meant,
but it is difficult to find any other word that would be preferable. The
thought which Anaximander is expressing seems to be this: there should
be a certain proportion of fire, of earth, and of water in the world,
but each element (conceived as a god) is perpetually attempting to
enlarge its empire. But there is a kind of necessity or natural law
which perpetually redresses the balance; where there has been fire, for
example, there are ashes, which are earth. This conception of justice—of
not overstepping eternally fixed bounds—was one of the most profound of
Greek beliefs. The gods were subject to justice just as much as men
were, but this supreme power was not itself personal, and was not a
supreme God.</p>
<p>Anaximander had an argument to prove that the primal substance could
not be water, or any other known element. If one of these were primal,
it would conquer the others. Aristotle reports him as saying that these
known elements are in opposition to one another. Air is cold, water is
moist, and fire is hot. ‘And therefore, if any one of them were
infinite, the rest would have ceased to be by this time.’ The primal
substance, therefore, must be neutral in this cosmic strife.</p>
<p>There was an eternal motion, in the course of which was brought about
the origin of the worlds. The worlds were not created, as in Jewish or
Christian theology, but evolved. There was evolution also in the animal
kingdom. Living creatures arose from the moist element as it was
evaporated by the sun. Man, like every other animal, was descended from
fishes. He must be derived from animals of a different sort, because,
owing to his long infancy, he could not have survived, originally, as he
is now.</p>
<p>Anaximander was full of scientific curiosity. He is said to have been
the first man who made a map. He held that the earth is shaped like a
cylinder. He is variously reported as saying the sun is as large as the
earth, or twenty-seven times as large, or twenty-eight times as
large.</p>
<p>Wherever he is original, he is scientific and rationalistic.</p>
<p>Anaximenes, the last of the Milesian triad, is not quite so
interesting as Anaximander, but makes some important advances. His dates
are very uncertain. He was certainly subsequent to Anaximander, and he
certainly flourished before 494 B.C., since in that year Miletus was
destroyed by the Persians in the course of their suppression of the
Ionian revolt.</p>
<p>The fundamental substance, he said, is air. The soul is air; fire is
rarefied air; when condensed, air becomes first water, then, if further
condensed, earth, and finally stone. This theory has the merit of making
all the differences between different substances quantitative, depending
entirely upon the degree of condensation.</p>
<p>He thought that the earth is shaped like a round table, and that air
encompasses everything: ‘Just as our soul, being air, holds us together,
so do breath and air encompass the whole world.’ It seems that the world
breathes.</p>
<p>Anaximenes was more admired in antiquity than Anaximander, though
almost any modern world would make the opposite valuation. He had an
important influence on Pythagoras and on much subsequent speculation.
The Pythagoreans discovered that the earth is spherical, but the
atomists adhered to the view of Anaximenes, that it is shaped like a
disc.</p>
<p>The Milesian school is important, not for what it achieved, but for
what it attempted. It was brought into existence by the contact of the
Greek mind with Babylonia and Egypt. Miletus was a rich commercial city,
in which primitive prejudices and superstitions were softened by
intercourse with many nations, Ionia, until its subjugation by Darius at
the beginning of the fifth century, was culturally the most important
part of the Hellenic world. It was almost untouched by the religious
movement connected with Dionysus and Orpheus; its religion was Olympic,
but seems to have been not taken very seriously. The speculations of
Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes are to be regarded as scientific
hypotheses, and seldom show any undue intrusion of anthropomorphic
desires and moral ideas. The questions they asked were good questions,
and their vigour inspired subsequent investigators.</p>
<p>The next stage in Greek philosophy, which is associated with the
Greek cities in southern Italy, is more religious, and, in particular,
more Orphic—in some ways more interesting, admirable in achievement, but
in spirit less scientific than that of the Milesians.</p>
