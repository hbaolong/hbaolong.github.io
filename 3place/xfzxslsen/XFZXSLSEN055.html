<h4 id="francis-bacon">7 FRANCIS BACON</h4>
<p>Francis Bacon (1561–1626), although his philosophy is in many ways
unsatisfactory, has permanent importance as the founder of modern
inductive method and the pioneer in the attempt at logical
systematization of scientific procedure.</p>
<p>He was a son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal,
and his aunt was the wife of Sir William Cecil, afterwards Lord
Burghley; he thus grew up in the atmosphere of State affairs. He entered
Parliament at the age of twenty-three, and became adviser to Essex. None
the less, when Essex fell from favour he helped in his prosecution. For
this he has been severely blamed: Lytton Strachey, for example, in his
Elizabeth and Essex, represents Bacon as a monster of treachery and
ingratitude. This is quite unjust. He worked with Essex while Essex was
loyal, but abandoned him when continued loyalty to him would have been
treasonable; in this there was nothing that even the most rigid moralist
of the age could condemn.</p>
<p>In spite of his abandonment of Essex, he was never completely in
favour during the lifetime of Queen Elizabeth. With James’s accession,
however, his prospects improved. In 1617 he acquired his father’s office
of Keeper of the Great Seal, and in 1618 he became Lord Chancellor. But
after he had held this great position for only two years, he was
prosecuted for accepting bribes from litigants. He admitted the truth of
the accusation, pleading only that presents never influenced his
decision. As to that, anyone may form his own opinion, since there can
be no evidence as to the decisions that Bacon would have come to in
other circumstances. He was condemned to a fine of £40,000, to
imprisonment in the Tower during the king’s pleasure, to perpetual
banishment from Court and inability to hold office. This sentence was
only very partially executed. He was not forced to pay the fine, and he
was kept to the Tower for only four days. But he was compelled to
abandon public life, and to spend the remainder of his days to writing
important books.</p>
<p>The ethics of the legal profession, in those days, were somewhat lax.
Almost every judge accepted presents, usually from both sides. Nowadays
we think it atrocious for a judge to take bribes, but even more
atrocious, after taking them, to decide against the givers of them. In
those days, presents were a matter of course, and a judge showed his
‘virtue’ by not being influenced by them. Bacon was condemned as an
incident in a party squabble, not because he was exceptionally guilty.
He was not a man of outstanding moral eminence, like his forerunner Sir
Thomas More, but he was also not exceptionally wicked. Morally, he was
an average man, no better and no worse than the bulk of his
contemporaries.</p>
<p>After five years spent in retirement, he died of a chill caught while
experimenting on refrigeration by stuffing a chicken full of snow.</p>
<p>Bacon’s most important book, The Advancement of Learning, is in many
ways remarkably modern. He is commonly regarded as the originator of the
saying ‘Knowledge is power’, and though he may have had predecessors who
said the same thing, he said it with new emphasis. The whole basis of
his philosophy was practical: to give mankind mastery over the forces of
nature by means of scientific discoveries and inventions. He held that
philosophy should be kept separate from theology, not intimately blended
with it as in scholasticism. He accepted orthodox religion; he was not
the man to quarrel with the government on such a matter. But while he
thought that reason could show the existence of God, he regarded
everything else in theology as known only by revelation. Indeed he held
that the triumph of faith is greatest when to the unaided reason a dogma
appears most absurd. Philosophy, however, should depend only upon
reason. He was thus an advocate of the doctrine of ‘double truth’, that
of reason and that of revelation. This doctrine had been preached by
certain Averroists in the thirteenth century, but had been condemned by
the Church. The ‘triumph of faith’ was, for the orthodox, a dangerous
device. Bayle, in the late seventeenth century, made ironical use of it,
setting forth at great length all that reason could say against some
orthodox belief, and then concluding ‘so much the greater is the triumph
of faith in nevertheless believing’. How far Bacon’s orthodoxy was
sincere it is impossible to know.</p>
<p>Bacon was the first of the long line of scientifically minded
philosophers who have emphasized the importance of induction as opposed
to deduction. Like most of his successors, he tried to find some better
kind of induction than what is called ‘induction by simple enumeration’.
Induction by simple enumeration may be illustrated by a parable. There
was once upon a time a census officer who had to record the names of all
householders in a certain Welsh village. The first that he questioned
was called William Williams; so were the second, third, fourth…. At last
he said to himself: ‘This is tedious; evidently they are all called
William Williams. I shall put them down so and take a holiday.’ But he
was wrong; there was just one whose name was John Jones. This shows that
we may go astray if we trust too implicitly to induction by simple
enumeration.</p>
<p>Bacon believed that he had a method by which induction could be made
something better than this. He wished, for example, to discover the
nature of heat, which he supposed (rightly) to consist of rapid
irregular motions of the small parts of bodies. His method was to make
lists of hot bodies, lists of cold bodies, and lists of bodies of
varying degrees of heat. He hoped that these lists would show some
characteristic always present in hot bodies and absent in cold bodies,
and present in varying degrees in bodies of different degrees of heat.
By this method he expected to arrive at general laws, having, in the
first instance, the lowest degree of generality. From a number of such
laws he hoped to reach laws of the second degree of generality, and so
on. A suggested law should be tested by being applied in new
circumstances; if it worked in these circumstances it was to that extent
confirmed. Some instances are specially valuable because they enable us
to decide between two theories, each possible as far as previous
observations are concerned; such instances are called ‘prerogative’
instances.</p>
<p>Bacon not only despised the syllogism, but undervalued mathematics,
presumably as insufficiently experimental. He was virulently hostile to
Aristotle, but thought very highly of Democritus. Although he did not
deny that the course of nature exemplifies a divine purpose, he objected
to any admixture of teleological explanation in the actual investigation
of phenomena; everything, he held, should be explained as following
necessarily from efficient causes.</p>
<p>He valued his method as showing how to arrange the observational data
upon which science must be based. We ought, he says, to be neither like
spiders, which spin things out of their own insides, nor like ants,
which merely collect, but like bees, which both collect and arrange.
This is somewhat unfair to the ants, but it illustrates Bacon’s
meaning.</p>
<p>One of the most famous parts of Bacon’s philosophy is his enumeration
of what he calls ‘idols’, by which he means bad habits of mind that
cause people to fall into error. Of these he enumerates four kinds.
‘Idols of the tribe’ are those that are inherent in human nature; he
mentions in particular the habit of expecting more order in natural
phenomena than is actually to be found. ‘Idols of the cave’ are personal
prejudices, characteristic of the particular investigator. ‘Idols of the
market-place’ are those that have to do with the tyranny of words.
‘Idols of the theatre’ are those that have to do with received systems
of thought; of these, naturally, Aristotle and the scholastics afforded
him the most noteworthy instances.</p>
<p>Although science was what interested Bacon, and although his general
outlook was scientific, he missed most of what was being done in science
in his day. He rejected the Copernican theory, which was excusable so
far as Copernicus himself was concerned, since he did not advance any
very solid arguments. But Bacon ought to have been convinced by Kepler,
whose New Astronomy appeared in 1609. Bacon appears not to have known of
the work of Vesalius, the pioneer of modern anatomy, though he admired
Gilbert, whose work on magnetism brilliantly illustrated inductive
method. Surprisingly, he seemed unconscious of the work of Harvey,
although Harvey was his medical attendant. It is true that Harvey did
not publish his discovery of the circulation of the blood until after
Bacon’s death, but one would have supposed that Bacon would have been
aware of his researches. Harvey had no very high opinion of him, saying
‘he writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor’. No doubt Bacon could have
done better if he had been less concerned with worldly success.</p>
<p>Bacon’s inductive method is faulty through insufficient emphasis on
hypothesis. He hoped that mere orderly arrangement of data would make
the right hypothesis obvious, but this is seldom the case. As a rule,
the framing of hypotheses is the most difficult part of scientific work,
and the part where great ability is indispensable. So far, no method has
been found which would make it possible to invent hypotheses by rule.
Usually some hypothesis is a necessary preliminary to the collection of
facts, since the selection of facts demands some way of determining
relevance. Without something of this kind, the mere multiplicity of
facts is baffling.</p>
<p>The part played by deduction in science is greater than Bacon
supposed. Often, when a hypothesis has to be tested, there is a long
deductive journey from the hypothesis to some consequence that can be
tested by observation. Usually the deduction is mathematical, and in
this respect Bacon underestimated the importance of mathematics in
scientific investigation.</p>
<p>The problem of induction by simple enumeration remains unsolved to
this day. Bacon was quite right in rejecting simple enumeration where
the details of scientific investigation are concerned, for in dealing
with details we may assume general laws on the basis of which, so long
as they are taken as valid, more or less cogent methods can be built up.
John Stuart Mill framed four canons of inductive method, which can be
usefully employed so long as the law of causality is assumed; but this
law itself, he had to confess, is to be accepted solely on the basis of
induction by simple enumeration. The thing that is achieved by the
theoretical organization of science is the collection of all subordinate
inductions into a few that are very comprehensive—perhaps only one. Such
comprehensive inductions are confirmed by so many instances that it is
thought legitimate to accept, as regards them, an induction by simple
enumeration. This situation is profoundly unsatisfactory, but neither
Bacon nor any of his successors have found a way out of it.</p>
