<h4 id="platos-cosmogony">17 PLATO’S COSMOGONY</h4>
<p>Plato’s cosmogony is set forth in the Timaeus,1 which was translated
into Latin by Cicero, and was, moreover, the only one of the dialogues
that was known in the West in the Middle Ages. Both then, and earlier in
Neoplatonism, it had more influence than anything else in Plato, which
is curious, as it certainly contains more that is simply silly than is
to be found in his other writings. As philosophy, it is unimportant, but
historically it was so influential that it must be considered in some
detail.</p>
<p>The place occupied by Socrates in the earlier dialogues is taken, in
the Timaeus, by a Pythagorean, and the doctrines of that school are in
the main adopted, including (up to a point) the view that number is the
explanation of the world. There is first a summary of the first five
books of the Republic, then the myth of Atlantis, which is said to have
been an island off the Pillars of Hercules, larger than Libya and Asia
put together. Then Timaeus, who is a Pythagorean astronomer, proceeds to
tell the history of the world down to the creation of man. What he says
is, in outline, as follows.</p>
<p>What is unchanging is apprehended by intelligence and reason; what is
changing is apprehended by opinion. The world being sensible, cannot be
eternal, and must have been created by God. Since God is good, He made
the world after the pattern of the eternal; being without jealousy, He
wanted everything as like Himself as possible. ‘God desired that all
things should be good, and nothing bad, as far as possible.’ ’Finding
the whole visible sphere not at rest, but moving in an irregular and
disorderly fashion, out of disorder</p>
<p>he brought order.’ (Thus it appears that Plato’s God, unlike the
Jewish and Christian God, did not create the world out of nothing, but
rearranged pre-existing material.) He put intelligence in the soul, and
the soul in the body. He made the world as a whole a living creature
having soul and intelligence. There is only one world, not many, as
various pre-Socratics had taught; there cannot be more than one, since
it is a created copy designed to accord as closely as possible with the
eternal original apprehended by God. The world in its entirety is one
visible animal, comprehending within itself all other animals. It is a
globe, because like is fairer than unlike, and only a globe is alike
everywhere. It rotates, because circular motion is the most perfect; and
since this is its only motion it needs no feet or hands.</p>
<p>The four elements, fire, air, water, and earth, each of which
apparently is represented by a number, are in continued proportion,
i.e. fire is to air as air is to water and as water is to earth. God
used all the elements in making the world, and therefore it is perfect,
and not liable to old age or disease. It is harmonized by proportion,
which causes it to have the spirit of friendship, and therefore to be
indissoluble except by God.</p>
<p>God made first the soul, then the body. The soul is compounded of the
indivisible-unchangeable and the divisible-changeable; it is a third and
intermediate kind of essence.</p>
<p>Here follows a Pythagorean account of the planets, leading to an
explanation of the origin of time:</p>
<p>When the father and creator saw the creature which he had made moving
and living, the created image of the eternal gods, he rejoiced, and in
his joy determined to make the copy still more like the original; and as
this was eternal, he sought to make the universe eternal, so far as
might be. Now the nature of the ideal being was everlasting, but to
bestow this attribute in its fulness upon a creature was impossible.
Wherefore he resolved to have a moving image of eternity, and when he
set in order the heaven, he made this image eternal but moving,
according to number, while eternity itself rests in unity; and this
image we call Time.2</p>
<p>Before this, there were no days or nights. Of the eternal essence we
must not say that it was or will be; only is is correct. It is implied
that of the ‘moving image of eternity’ it is correct to say that it was
and will be.</p>
<p>Time and the heavens came into existence at the same instant. God
made the sun so that animals could learn arithmetic—without the
succession of days and nights, one supposes, we should not have thought
of numbers. The</p>
<p>sight of day and night, months and years, has created knowledge of
number and given us the conception of time, and hence came philosophy.
This is the greatest boon we owe to sight.</p>
<p>There are (apart from the world as a whole) four kinds of animals:
gods, birds, fishes, and land animals. The gods are mainly fire; the
fixed stars are divine and eternal animals. The Creator told the gods
that he could destroy them, but would not do so. He left it to them to
make the mortal part of all other animals, after he had made the
immortal and divine part. (This, like other passages about the gods in
Plato, is perhaps not to be taken very seriously. At the beginning,
Timaeus says he seeks only probability, and cannot be sure. Many details
are obviously imaginative, and not meant literally.)</p>
<p>The Creator, Timaeus says, made one soul for each star. Souls have
sensation, love, fear, and anger; if they overcome these, they live
righteously, but if not, not. If a man lives well, he goes, after death,
to live happily for ever in his star. But if he lives badly, he will, in
the next life, be a woman; if he (or she) persists in evil-doing, he (or
she) will become a brute, and go on through transmigrations until at
last reason conquers. God put some souls on earth, some on the moon,
some on other planets and stars, and left it to the gods to fashion
their bodies.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of causes, those that are intelligent, and those
that, being moved by others, are, in turn, compelled to move others. The
former are endowed with mind, and are the workers of things fair and
good, while the latter produce chance effects without order or design.
Both sorts ought to be studied, for the creation is mixed, being made up
of necessity and mind. (It will be observed that necessity is not
subject to God’s power.) Timaeus now proceeds to deal with the part
contributed by necessity.3</p>
<p>Earth, air, fire, and water are not the first principles or letters
or elements; they are not even syllables or first compounds. Fire, for
instance, should not be called this, but such—that is to say, it is not
a substance, but rather a state of substance. At this point, the
question is raised: are intelligible essences only names? The answer
turns, we are told, on whether mind is or is not the same thing as true
opinion. If it is not, knowledge must be knowledge of essences, and
therefore essences cannot be mere names. Now mind and true opinion
certainly differ, for the one is implanted by instruction, the other by
persuasion; one is accompanied by true reason, the other is not; all men
share in true opinion, but mind is the attribute of the gods and of a
very few among men.</p>
<p>This leads to a somewhat curious theory of space, as something
intermediate between the world of essence and the world of transient
sensible things.</p>
<p>There is one kind of being which is always the same, uncreated and
indestructible, never receiving anything into itself from without, nor
itself going out to any other, but invisible and imperceptible by any
sense, and of which the contemplation is granted to intelligence only.
And there is another nature of the same name with it, and like to it,
perceived by sense, created, always in motion, becoming in place and
again vanishing out of place, which is apprehended by opinion and sense.
And there is a third nature, which is space, and is eternal, and admits
not of destruction and provides a home for all created things, and is
apprehended without the help of sense, by a kind of spurious reason, and
is hardly real; which we beholding as in a dream, say of all existence
that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy a space, but that
what is neither in heaven nor on earth has no existence.</p>
<p>This is a very difficult passage, which I do not pretend to
understand at all fully. The theory expressed must, I think, have arisen
from reflection on geometry, which appeared to be a matter of pure
reason, like arithmetic, and yet had to do with space, which was an
aspect of the sensible world. In general it is fanciful to find
analogies with later philosophers, but I cannot help thinking that Kant
must have liked this view of space, as one having an affinity with his
own.</p>
<p>The true elements of the material world, Timaeus says, are not earth,
air, fire, and water, but two sorts of right-angled triangles, the one
which is half a square and the one which is half an equilateral
triangle. Originally everything was in confusion, and ‘the various
elements had different places before they were arranged so as to form
the universe’. But then God fashioned them by form and number, and ‘made
them as far as possible the fairest and best, out of things which were
not fair and good’. The above two sorts of triangles, we are told, are
the most beautiful forms, and therefore God used them in constructing
matter. By means of these two triangles, it is possible to construct
four of the five regular solids, and each atom of one of the four
elements is a regular solid. Atoms of earth are cubes; of fire,
tetrahedra; of air, octahedra; and of water, icosahedra. (I shall come
to the dodecahedron presently.)</p>
<p>The theory of the regular solids, which is set forth in the
thirteenth book of Euclid, was, in Plato’s day, a recent discovery; it
was completed by Theaetetus, who appears as a very young man in the
dialogue that bears his name. It was, according to tradition, he who
first proved that there are only five kinds of regular solids, and
discovered the octahedron and the icosahedron.4 The regular tetrahedron,
octahedron, and icosahedron, have equilateral</p>
<p>triangles for their faces; the dodecahedron has regular pentagons,
and cannot therefore be constructed out of Plato’s two triangles. For
this reason he does not use it in connection with the four elements.</p>
<p>As for the dodecahedron, Plato says only ‘there was yet a fifth
combination which God used in the delineation of the universe’. This is
obscure, and suggests that the universe is a dodecahedron; but elsewhere
it is said to be a sphere.5 The pentagram has always been prominent in
magic, and apparently owes this position to the Pythagoreans, who called
it ‘Health’ and used it as a symbol of recognition of members of the
brotherhood:6 It seems that it owed its properties to the fact that the
dodecahedron has pentagons for its faces, and is, in some sense, a
symbol of the universe. This topic is attractive, but it is difficult to
ascertain much that is definite about it.</p>
<p>After a discussion of sensation, Timaeus proceeds to explain the two
souls in man, one immortal, the other mortal, one created by God, the
other by the gods. The mortal soul is ‘subject to terrible and
irresistible affections—first of all, pleasure, the greatest incitement
to evil; then pain, which deters from good; also rashness and fear, two
foolish counsellors, anger hard to be appeased, and hope easily led
astray; these they (the gods) mingled with irrational sense and with
all-daring love according to necessary laws, and so framed men’.</p>
<p>The immortal soul is in the head, the mortal in the breast.</p>
<p>There is some curious physiology, as, that the purpose of the
intestines is to prevent gluttony by keeping the food in, and then there
is another account of transmigration. Cowardly or unrighteous men will,
in the next life, be women. Innocent light-minded men, who think that
astronomy can be learnt by looking at the stars without knowledge of
mathematics, will become birds; those who have no philosophy will become
wild land-animals; the very stupidest will become fishes.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of the dialogue sums it up:</p>
<p>We may now say that our discourse about the nature of the universe
has an end. The world has received animals, mortal and immortal, and is
fulfilled with them, and has become a visible animal containing the
visible—the sensible God who is the image of the intellectual, the
greatest, best, fairest, most perfect—the one only-begotten heaven.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know what to take seriously in the Timaeus, and
what to regard as play of fancy. I think the account of the creation as
bringing order out of chaos is to be taken quite seriously; so also is
the proportion between</p>
<p>the four elements, and their relation to the regular solids and their
constituent triangles. The accounts of time and space are obviously what
Plato believes, and so is the view of the created world as a copy of an
eternal archetype. The mixture of necessity and purpose in the world is
a belief common to practically all Greeks, long antedating the rise of
philosophy; Plato accepted it, and thus avoided the problem of evil,
which troubles Christian theology. I think his world-animal is seriously
meant. But the details about transmigration, and the part attributed to
the gods, and other inessentials, are, I think, only put in to give a
possible concreteness.</p>
<p>The whole dialogue, as I said before, deserves to be studied because
of its great influence on ancient and medieval thought; and this
influence is not confined to what is least fantastic.</p>
