<h4 id="the-theory-of-ideas">15 THE THEORY OF IDEAS</h4>
<p>The middle of the Republic, from the later part of Book V to the end
of Book VII, is occupied mainly with questions of pure philosophy, as
opposed to politics. These questions are introduced by a somewhat abrupt
statement:</p>
<p>Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world
have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and
wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the
exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never
have rest from these evils—no, nor the human race, as I believe—and then
only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light
of day.</p>
<p>If this is true, we must decide what constitutes a philosopher, and
what we mean by ‘philosophy’. The consequent discussion is the most
famous part of the Republic, and has perhaps been the most influential.
It has, in parts, extraordinary literary beauty; the reader may disagree
(as I do) with what is said, but cannot help being moved by it.</p>
<p>Plato’s philosophy rests on the distinction between reality and
appearance, which was first set forth by Parmenides; throughout the
discussion with which we are now concerned, Parmenidean phrases and
arguments are constantly recurring. There is, however, a religious tone
about reality, which is rather Pythagorean than Parmenidean; and there
is much about mathematics and music which is directly traceable to the
disciples of Pythagoras. This combination of the logic of Parmenides
with the other-worldliness of Pythagoras and the Orphics produced a
doctrine which was felt to be satisfying to both the intellect and the
religious emotions; the result was a very powerful synthesis, which,
with various modifications, influenced most of the great philosophers,
down to and including Hegel. But not only philosophers were influenced
by Plato. Why did the Puritans object to the music and painting and
gorgeous ritual of the Catholic Church? You will find the answer in the
tenth book of the Republic. Why are children in school compelled to
learn arithmetic? The reasons are given in the seventh book.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs summarize Plato’s theory of ideas.</p>
<p>Our question is: What is a philosopher? The first answer is in
accordance with the etymology: a philosopher is a lover of wisdom. But
this is not the same thing as a lover of knowledge, in the sense in
which an inquisitive man may be said to love knowledge; vulgar curiosity
does not make a philosopher. The definition is therefore amended: the
philosopher is a man who loves the ‘vision of truth’. But what is this
vision?</p>
<p>Consider a man who loves beautiful things, who makes a point of being
present at new tragedies, seeing new pictures, and hearing new music.
Such a man is not a philosopher, because he loves only beautiful things,
whereas the philosopher loves beauty in itself. The man who only loves
beautiful things is dreaming, whereas the man who knows absolute beauty
is wide awake. The former has only opinion; the latter has
knowledge.</p>
<p>What is the difference between ‘knowledge’ and ‘opinion’? The man who
has knowledge has knowledge of something, that is to say, of something
that exists, for what does not exist is nothing. (This is reminiscent of
Parmenides.) Thus knowledge is infallible, since it is logically
impossible for it to be mistaken. But opinion can be mistaken. How can
this be? Opinion cannot be of what is not, for that is impossible; nor
of what is, for then it would be knowledge. Therefore opinion must be of
what both is and is not.</p>
<p>But how is this possible? The answer is that particular things always
partake of opposite characters: what is beautiful is also, in some
respects, ugly; what is just is, in some respects, unjust; and so on.
All particular sensible objects, so Plato contends, have this
contradictory character; they are thus intermediate between being and
not-being, and are suitable as objects of opinion, but not of knowledge.
‘But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to
know, and not to have opinion only.’</p>
<p>Thus we arrive at the conclusion that opinion is of the world
presented to the senses, whereas knowledge is of a super-sensible
eternal world; for instance, opinion is concerned with particular
beautiful things, but knowledge is concerned with beauty in itself.</p>
<p>The only argument advanced is that it is self-contradictory to
suppose that a thing can be both beautiful and not beautiful, or both
just and not just, and that nevertheless particular things seem to
combine such contradictory characters. Therefore particular things are
not real. Heraclitus had said ‘We step and do not step into the same
rivers; we are and are not.’ But combining this with Parmenides we
arrive at Plato’s result.</p>
<p>There is, however, something of great importance in Plato’s doctrine
which is not traceable to his predecessors, and that is the theory of
‘ideas’ or ‘forms’. This theory is partly logical, partly metaphysical.
The logical part has to do with the meaning of general words. There are
many individual animals of whom we can truly say ‘this is a cat’. What
do we mean by the word ‘cat’? Obviously something different from each
particular cat. An animal is a cat, it would seem, because it
participates in a general nature common to all cats. Language cannot get
on without general words such as ‘cat’, and such words are evidently not
meaningless. But if the word ‘cat’ means anything, it means something
which is not this or that cat, but some kind of universal cattiness.
This is not born when a particular cat is born, and does not die when it
dies, In fact, it has no position in space or time; it is ‘eternal’.
This is the logical part of the doctrine. The arguments in its favour,
whether ultimately valid or not, are strong, and quite independent of
the metaphysical part of the doctrine.</p>
<p>According to the metaphysical part of the doctrine, the word ‘cat’
means a certain ideal cat, ‘the cat’, created by God, and unique.
Particular cats partake of the nature of the cat, but more or less
imperfectly; it is only owing to this imperfection that there can be
many of them. The cat is real; particular cats are only apparent.</p>
<p>In the last book of the Republic, as a preliminary to a condemnation
of painters, there is a very clear exposition of the doctrine of ideas
or forms.</p>
<p>Here Plato explains that, whenever a number of individuals have a
common name, they have also a common ‘idea’ or ‘form’. For instance,
though there are many beds, there is only one ‘idea’ or ‘form’ of a bed.
Just as a reflection of a bed in a mirror is only apparent and not
‘real’, so the various particular beds are unreal, being only copies of
the ‘idea’, which is the one real bed, and is made by God. Of this one
bed, made by God, there can be knowledge, but in respect of the many
beds made by carpenters there can be only opinion. The philosopher, as
such, will be interested only in the one ideal bed, not in the many beds
found in the sensible world. He will have a certain indifference to
ordinary mundane affairs: ‘how can he who has magnificence of mind and
is the spectator of all time and all existence, think much of human
life?’ The youth who is capable of becoming a philosopher will be
distinguished among his fellows as just and gentle, fond of learning,
possessed of a good memory and a naturally harmonious mind. Such a one
shall be educated into a philosopher and a guardian.</p>
<p>At this point Adeimantus breaks in with a protest. When he tries to
argue with Socrates, he says, he feels himself led a little astray at
each step, until, in the end, all his former notions are turned upside
down. But whatever Socrates may say, it remains the case, as any one can
see, that people who stick to philosophy become strange monsters, not to
say utter rogues; even the best of them are made useless by
philosophy.</p>
<p>Socrates admits that this is true in the world as it is, but
maintains that it is the other people who are to blame, not the
philosophers; in a wise community the philosophers would not seem
foolish; it is only among fools that the wise are judged to be destitute
of wisdom.</p>
<p>What are we to do in this dilemma? There were to have been two ways
of inaugurating our Republic: by philosophers becoming rulers, or by
rulers becoming philosophers. The first way seems impossible as a
beginning, because in a city not already philosophic the philosophers
are unpopular. But a born prince might be a philosopher, and ‘one is
enough; let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will, and he
might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world is so
incredulous.’ Plato hoped that he had found such a prince in the younger
Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, but the young man turned out
disappointingly.</p>
<p>In the sixth and seventh books of the Republic, Plato is concerned
with two questions: First, what is philosophy? Second, how can a young
man or woman, of suitable temperament, be so educated as to become a
philosopher?</p>
<p>Philosophy, for Plato, is a kind of vision, the ‘vision of truth’. It
is not purely intellectual; it is not merely wisdom, but love of wisdom,
Spinoza’s ‘intellectual love of God’ is much the same intimate union of
thought and feeling. Every one who has done any kind of creative work
has experienced, in a greater or less degree, the state of mind in
which, after long labour, truth or beauty appears, or seems to appear,
in a sudden glory—it may be only about some small matter, or it may be
about the universe. The experience is, at the moment, very convincing;
doubt may come later, but at the time there is utter certainty. I think
most of the best creative work, in art, in science, in literature, and
in philosophy, has been the result of such a moment. Whether it comes to
others as to me, I cannot say. For my part, I have found that, when I
wish to write a book on some subject, I must first soak myself in
detail, until all the separate parts of the subject-matter are familiar;
then, some day, if I am fortunate, I perceive the whole, with all its
parts duly interrelated. After that, I only have to write down what I
have seen. The nearest analogy is first walking all over a mountain in a
mist, until every path and ridge and valley is separately familiar, and
then, from a distance, seeing the mountain whole and clear in bright
sunshine.</p>
<p>This experience, I believe, is necessary to good creative work, but
it is not sufficient; indeed the subjective certainty that it brings
with it may be fatally misleading. William James describes a man who got
the experience from laughing-gas; whenever he was under its influence,
he knew the secret of the universe, but when he came to, he had
forgotten it. At last, with immense effort, he wrote down the secret
before the vision had faded. When completely recovered, he rushed to see
what he had written. It was: ‘A smell of petroleum prevails throughout.’
What seems like sudden insight may be misleading, and must be tested
soberly, when the divine intoxication has passed.</p>
<p>Plato’s vision, which he completely trusted at the time when he wrote
the Republic, needs ultimately the help of a parable, the parable of the
cave, in order to convey its nature to the reader. But it is led up to
by various preliminary discussions, designed to make the reader see the
necessity of the world of ideas.</p>
<p>First, the world of the intellect is distinguished from the world of
the senses; then intellect and sense-perception are in turn each divided
into two kinds. The two kinds of sense-perception need not concern us;
the two kinds of intellect are called, respectively, ‘reason’ and
‘understanding’. Of these, reason is the higher kind; it is concerned
with pure ideas, and its method is dialectic. Understanding is the kind
of intellect that is used in mathematics; it is inferior to reason in
that it uses hypotheses which it cannot test. In geometry, for example,
we say: ‘Let ABC be a rectilinear triangle.’ It is against the rules to
ask whether ABC really is a rectilinear triangle, although, if it is a
figure that we have drawn, we may be sure that it is not, because we
can’t draw absolutely straight lines. Accordingly, mathematics can never
tell us what is, but only what would be if…. There are no straight lines
in the sensible world; therefore, if mathematics is to have more than
hypothetical truth, we must find evidence for the existence of
super-sensible straight lines in a super-sensible world. This cannot be
done by the understanding, but according to Plato it can be done by
reason, which shows that there is a rectilinear triangle in heaven, of
which geometrical propositions can be affirmed categorically, not
hypothetically.</p>
<p>There is, at this point, a difficulty which did not escape Plato’s
notice, and was evident to modern idealistic philosophers. We saw that
God made only one bed, and it would be natural to suppose that he made
only one straight line. But if there is a heavenly triangle, he must
have made at least three straight lines. The objects of geometry, though
ideal, must exist in many examples; we need the possibility of two
intersecting circles, and so on. This suggests that geometry, on Plato’s
theory, should not be capable of ultimate truth, but should be condemned
as part of the study of appearance. We will, however, ignore this point,
as to which Plato’s answer is somewhat obscure.</p>
<p>Plato seeks to explain the difference between clear intellectual
vision and the confused vision of sense-perception by an analogy from
the sense of sight. Sight, he says, differs from the other senses, since
it requires not only the eye and the object, but also light. We see
clearly objects on which the sun shines: in twilight we see confusedly,
and in pitch-darkness not at all. Now the world of ideas is what we see
when the object is illumined by the sun, while the world of passing
things is a confused twilight world. The eye is compared to the soul,
and the sun, as the source of light, to truth or goodness.</p>
<p>The soul is like an eye: when resting upon that on which truth and
being shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with
intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is
first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
intelligence…. Now what imparts truth to the known and the power of
knowing to the knower is what I would have you term the idea of good,
and this you will deem to be the cause of science.</p>
<p>This leads up to the famous simile of the cave or den, according to
which those who are destitute of philosophy may be compared to prisoners
in a cave, who are only able to look in one direction because they are
bound, and who have a fire behind them and a wall in front. Between them
and the wall there is nothing; all that they see are shadows of
themselves, and of objects behind them, cast on the wall by the light of
the fire. Inevitably they regard these shadows as real, and have no
notion of the objects to which they are due. At last some man succeeds
in escaping from the cave to the light of the sun; for the first time he
sees real things, and becomes aware that he had hitherto been deceived
by shadows. If he is the sort of philosopher who is fit to become a
guardian, he will feel it is his duty to those who were formerly his
fellow-prisoners to go down again into the cave, instruct them as to the
truth, and show them the way up. But he will have difficulty in
persuading them, because, coming out of the sunlight, he will see
shadows less clearly than they do, and will seem to them stupider than
before his escape.</p>
<p>’And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is
enlightened or unenlightened:—Behold! human beings living in an
underground den, which has a mouth open toward the light and reaching
all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have
their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see
before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their
heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and
between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will
see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which
marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the
puppets.</p>
<p>’I see.</p>
<p>’And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all
sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and
stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them
are talking, others silent.</p>
<p>’You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange
prisoners.</p>
<p>‘Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or
the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall
of the cave.’</p>
<p>The position of the good in Plato’s philosophy is peculiar. Science
and truth, he says, are like the good, but the good has a higher place.
‘The good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.’
Dialectic leads to the end of the intellectual world in the perception
of the absolute good. It is by means of the good that dialectic is able
to dispense with the hypotheses of the mathematician. The underlying
assumption is that reality, as opposed to appearance, is completely and
perfectly good; to perceive the good, therefore, is to perceive reality.
Throughout Plato’s philosophy there is the same fusion of intellect and
mysticism as in Pythagoreanism, but at this final culmination mysticism
clearly has the upper hand.</p>
<p>Plato’s doctrine of ideas contains a number of obvious errors. But in
spite of these it marks a very important advance in philosophy, since it
is the first theory to emphasize the problem of universals, which, in
varying forms, has persisted to the present day. Beginnings are apt to
be crude, but their originality should not be overlooked on this account
Something remains of what Plato had to say, even after all necessary
corrections have been made. The absolute minimum of what remains, even
in the view of those most hostile to Plato, is this: that we cannot
express ourselves in a language composed wholly of proper names, but
must have also general words such as ‘man’, ‘dog’, ‘cat’; or, if not
these, then relational words such as ‘similar’, ‘before’, and so on.
Such words are not meaningless noises, and it is difficult to see how
they can have meaning if the world consists entirely of particular
things, such as are designated by proper names. There may be ways of
getting round this argument, but at any rate it affords a prima facie
case in favour of universals. I shall provisionally accept it as in some
degree valid. But when so much is granted, the rest of what Plato says
by no means follows.</p>
<p>In the first place, Plato has no understanding of philosophical
syntax. I can say ‘Socrates is human’, ‘Plato is human’, and so on. In
all these statements, it may be assumed that the word ‘human’ has
exactly the same meaning. But whatever it means, it means something
which is not of the same kind as Socrates, Plato, and the rest of the
individuals who compose the human race. ‘Human’ is an adjective; it
would be nonsense to say ‘human is human’. Plato makes a mistake
analogous to saying ‘human is human’. He thinks that beauty is
beautiful; he thinks that the universal ‘man’ is the name of a pattern
man created by God, of whom actual men are imperfect and somewhat unreal
copies. He fails altogether to realize how great is the gap between
universals and particulars; his ‘ideas’ are really just other
particulars, ethically and aesthetically superior to the ordinary kind.
He himself, at a later date, began to see this difficulty, as appears in
the Parmenides, which contains one of the most remarkable cases in
history of self-criticism by a philosopher.</p>
<p>The Parmenides is supposed to be related by Antiphon (Plato’s
half-brother), who alone remembers the conversation, but is now only
interested in horses. They find him carrying a bridle, and with
difficulty persuade him to relate the famous discussion between
Parmenides, Zeno, and Socrates. This, we are told, took place when
Parmenides was old (about sixty-five), Zeno in middle life (about
forty), and Socrates quite a young man. Socrates expounds the theory of
ideas; he is sure that there are ideas of likeness, justice, beauty, and
goodness; he is not sure that there is an idea of man; and he rejects
with indignation the suggestion that there could be ideas of such things
as hair and mud and dirt—though, he adds, there are times when he thinks
that there is nothing without an idea. He runs away from this view
because he is afraid of falling into a bottomless pit of nonsense.</p>
<p>‘Yes, Socrates, said Parmenides; that is because you are still young;
the time will come, if I am not mistaken, when philosophy will have a
firmer grasp of you, and then you will not despise even the meanest
things.’</p>
<p>Socrates agrees that, in his view, ‘There are certain ideas of which
all other things partake, and from which they derive their names; that
similars, for example, become similar, because they partake of
similarity; and great things become great, because they partake of
greatness; and that just and beautiful things become just and beautiful,
because they partake of justice and beauty.’</p>
<p>Parmenides proceeds to raise difficulties. (a) Does the individual
partake of the whole idea, or only of a part? To either view there are
objections. If the former, one thing is in many places at once; if the
latter, the idea is divisible, and a thing which has a part of smallness
will be smaller than absolute smallness, which is absurd. (b) When an
individual partakes of an idea, the individual and the idea are similar;
therefore there will have to be another idea, embracing both the
particulars and the original idea. And there will have to be yet
another, embracing the particulars and the two ideas, and so on ad
infinitum. Thus every idea, instead of being one, becomes an infinited
series of ideas. (This is the same as Aristotle’s argument of the ‘third
man’.) (c) Socrates suggests that perhaps ideas are only thoughts; but
Parmenides points out that thoughts must be of something. (d) Ideas
cannot resemble the particulars that partake of them, for the reason
given in (b) above. (e) Ideas, if there are any, must be unknown to us,
because our knowledge is not absolute. (f) If God’s knowledge is
absolute, He will not know us, and therefore cannot rule us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the theory of ideas is not wholly abandoned. Without
ideas, Socrates says, there will be nothing on which the mind can rest,
and therefore reasoning will be destroyed. Parmenides tells him that his
troubles come of lack of previous training, but no definite conclusion
is reached.</p>
<p>I do not think that Plato’s logical objections to the reality of
sensible particulars will bear examination. He says, for example, that
whatever is beautiful is also in some respects ugly; what is double is
also half; and so on. But when we say of some work of art that it is
beautiful in some respects and ugly in others, analysis will always (at
least theoretically) enable us to say ‘this part or aspect is beautiful,
while that part or aspect is ugly.’ And as regards ‘double’ and ‘half’,
these are relative terms; there is no contradiction in the fact that 2
is double of 1 and half of 4. Plato is perpetually getting into trouble
through not understanding relative terms. He thinks that if A is greater
than B and less than C, then A is at once great and small, which seems
to him a contradiction. Such troubles are among the infantile diseases
of philosophy.</p>
<p>The distinction between reality and appearance cannot have the
consequences attributed to it by Parmenides and Plato and Hegel. If
appearance really appears, it is not nothing, and is therefore part of
reality; this is an argument of the correct Parmenidean sort. If
appearance does not really appear, why trouble our heads about it? But
perhaps some one will say: ‘Appearance does not really appear, but it
appears to appear.’ This will not help, for we shall ask again: ‘Does it
really appear to appear, or only apparently appear to appear?’ Sooner or
later, if appearance is even to appear to appear, we must reach
something that really appears, and is therefore part of reality. Plato
would not dream of denying that there appear to be many beds, although
there is only one real bed, namely the one made by God. But he does not
seem to have faced the implications of the fact that there are many
appearances, and that this manyness is part of reality. Any attempt to
divide the world into portions, of which one is more ‘real’ than the
other, is doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Connected with this is another curious view of Plato’s, that
knowledge and opinion must be concerned with different subject-matters.
We should say: If I think it is going to snow, that is opinion; if later
I see it snowing, that is knowledge; but the subject-matter is the same
on both occasions. Plato, however, thinks that what can at any time be a
matter of opinion can never be a matter of knowledge. Knowledge is
certain and infallible; opinion is not merely fallible, but is
necessarily mistaken, since it assumes the reality of what is only
appearance. All this repeats what had been said by Parmenides.</p>
<p>There is one respect in which Plato’s metaphysic is apparently
different from that of Parmenides. For Parmenides there is only the One;
for Plato, there are many ideas. There are not only beauty, truth, and
goodness, but, as we saw, there is the heavenly bed, created by God;
there is a heavenly man, a heavenly dog, a heavenly cat, and so on
through a whole Noah’s ark. All this however, seems, in the Republic, to
have been not adequately thought out. A Platonic idea or form is not a
thought, though it may be the object of a thought. It is difficult to
see how God can have created it, since its being is timeless, and he
could not have decided to create a bed unless his thought, when he
decided, had had for its object that very Platonic bed which we are told
he brought into existence. What is timeless must be uncreated. We come
here to a difficulty which has troubled many philosophic theologians.
Only the contingent world, the world in space and time, can have been
created; but this is the everyday world which has been condemned as
illusory and also bad. Therefore the Creator, it would seem, created
only illusion and evil. Some Gnostics were so consistent as to adopt
this view; but in Plato the difficulty is still below the surface, and
he seems, in the Republic, to have never become aware of it.</p>
<p>The philosopher who is to be a guardian must, according to Plato,
return into the cave, and live among those who have never seen the sun
of truth. It would seem that God Himself, if He wishes to amend His
creation, must do likewise; a Christian Platonist might so interpret the
Incarnation. But it remains completely impossible to explain why God was
not content with the world of ideas. The philosopher finds the cave in
existence, and is actuated by benevolence in returning to it; but the
Creator, if He created everything, might, one would think, have avoided
the cave altogether.</p>
<p>Perhaps this difficulty arises only from the Christian notion of a
Creator, and is not chargeable to Plato, who says that God did not
create everything, but only what is good. The multiplicity of the
sensible world, on this view, would have some other source than God. And
the ideas would, perhaps, be not so much created by God as constituents
of His essence. The apparent pluralism involved in the multiplicity of
ideas would thus not be ultimate. Ultimately there is only God, or the
Good, to whom the ideas are adjectival. This, at any rate, is a possible
interpretation of Plato.</p>
<p>Plato proceeds to an interesting sketch of the education proper to a
young man who is to be a guardian. We saw that the young man is selected
for this honour on the ground of a combination of intellectual and moral
qualities; he must be just and gentle, fond of learning, with a good
memory and a harmonious mind. The young man who has been chosen for
these merits will spend the years from twenty to thirty on the four
Pythagorean studies: arithmetic, geometry (plane and solid), astronomy,
and harmony. These studies are not to be pursued in any utilitarian
spirit, but in order to prepare his mind for the vision of eternal
things. In astronomy, for example, he is not to trouble himself too much
about the actual heavenly bodies, but rather with the mathematics of the
motion of ideal heavenly bodies. This may sound absurd to modern ears,
but strange to say, it proved to be a fruitful point of view in
connection with empirical astronomy. The way this came about is curious,
and worth considering.</p>
<p>The apparent motions of the planets, until they have been very
profoundly analysed, appear to be irregular and complicated, and not at
all such as a Pythagorean Creator would have chosen. It was obvious to
every Greek that the heavens ought to exemplify mathematical beauty,
which would only be the case if the planets moved in circles. This would
be especially evident to Plato, owing to his emphasis on the good. The
problem thus arose: is there any hypothesis which will reduce the
apparent disorderliness of planetary motions to order and beauty and
simplicity? If there is, the idea of the good will justify us in
asserting this hypothesis. Aristarchus of Samos found such a hypothesis:
that all the planets, including the earth, go round the sun in circles.
This view was rejected for two thousand years, partly on the authority
of Aristotle, who attributes a rather similar hypothesis to ‘the
Pythagoreans’ (De Coelo, 293 a). It was revived by Copernicus, and its
success might seem to justify Plato’s aesthetic bias in astronomy.
Unfortunately, however, Kepler discovered that the planets move in
ellipses, not in circles, with the sun at a focus, not at the centre;
then Newton discovered that they do not move even in exact ellipses. And
so the geometrical simplicity sought by Plato, and apparently found by
Aristarchus of Samos, proved in the end illusory.</p>
<p>This piece of scientific history illustrates a general maxim: that
any hypothesis, however absurd, may be useful in science, if it enables
a discoverer to conceive things in a new way; but that, when it has
served this purpose by luck, it is likely to become an obstacle to
further advance. The belief in the good as the key to the scientific
understanding of the world was useful, at a certain stage, in astronomy,
but at every later stage it was harmful. The ethical and aesthetic bias
of Plato, and still more of Aristotle, did much to kill Greek
science.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that modern Platonists, with few exceptions, are
ignorant of mathematics, in spite of the immense importance that Plato
attached to arithmetic and geometry, and the immense influence that they
had on his philosophy. This is an example of the evils of
specialization: a man must not write on Plato unless he has spent so
much of his youth on Greek as to have had no time for the things that
Plato thought important.</p>
