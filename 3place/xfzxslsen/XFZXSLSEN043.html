<h4 id="mohammedan-culture-and-philosophy">10 MOHAMMEDAN CULTURE AND
PHILOSOPHY</h4>
<p>The attacks upon the Eastern Empire, Africa, and Spain, differed from
those of Northern barbarians on the West in two respects: first, the
Eastern Empire survived till 1453, nearly a thousand years longer than
the Western; second, the main attacks upon the Eastern Empire were made
by Mohammedans, who did not become Christians after conquest, but
developed an important civilization of their own.</p>
<p>The Hegira,1 with which the Mohammedan era begins, took place in A.D.
622; Mohammed died ten years later. Immediately after his death the Arab
conquests began, and they proceeded with extraordinary rapidity. In the
East, Syria was invaded in 634, and completely subdued within two years.
In 637 Persia was invaded; in 650 its conquest was completed. India was
invaded in 664; Constantinople was besieged in 669 (and again in
716–17). The westward movement was not quite so sudden. Egypt was
conquered in 642, Carthage not till 697. Spain, except for a small
corner in the north-west, was acquired in 711–12. Westward expansion
(except in Sicily and Southern Italy) was brought to a standstill by the
defeat of the Mohammedans at the battle of Tours in 732, just one
hundred years after the death of the prophet. (The Ottoman Turks, who
finally conquered Constantinople, belong to a later period than that
with which we are now concerned.)</p>
<p>Various circumstances facilitated this expansion. Persia and the
Eastern Empire were exhausted by their long wars. The Syrians, who were
largely Nestorian, suffered persecution at the hands of the Catholics,
whereas</p>
<p>Mohammedans tolerated all sects of Christians in return for the
payment of tribute. Similarly in Egypt the Monophysites, who were the
bulk of the population, welcomed the invaders. In Africa, the Arabs
allied themselves with the Berbers, whom the Romans had never thoroughly
subdued. Arabs and Berbers together invaded Spain, where they were
helped by the Jews, whom the Visigoths had severely persecuted.</p>
<p>The religion of the Prophet was a simple monotheism, uncomplicated by
the elaborate theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation. The Prophet
made no claim to be divine, nor did his followers make such a claim on
his behalf. He revived the Jewish prohibition of graven images, and
forbade the use of wine. It was the duty of the faithful to conquer as
much of the world as possible for Islam, but there was to be no
persecution of Christians, Jews, or Zoroastrians—the ‘people of the
Book’, as the Koran calls them, i.e. those who followed the teaching of
a Scripture.</p>
<p>Arabia was largely desert, and was growing less and less capable of
supporting its population. The first conquests of the Arabs began as
mere raids for plunder, and only turned into permanent occupation after
experience had shown the weakness of the enemy. Suddenly, in the course
of some twenty years, men accustomed to all the hardships of a meagre
existence on the fringe of the desert found themselves masters of some
of the richest regions of the world, able to enjoy every luxury and to
acquire all the refinements of an ancient civilization. They withstood
the temptations of this transformation better than most of the Northern
barbarians had done. As they had acquired their empire without much
severe fighting, there had been little destruction, and the civil
administration was kept on almost unchanged. Both in Persia and in the
Byzantine Empire, the civil government had been highly organized. The
Arab tribesmen, at first, understood nothing of its complications, and
perforce accepted the services of the trained men whom they found in
charge. These men, for the most part, showed no reluctance to serve
under their new masters. Indeed, the change made their work easier,
since taxation was lightened very considerably. The populations,
moreover, in order to escape the tribute, very largely abandoned
Christianity for Islam.</p>
<p>The Arab Empire was an absolute monarchy, under the caliph, who was
the successor of the Prophet, and inherited much of his holiness. The
caliphate was nominally elective, but soon became hereditary. The first
dynasty, that of the Umayyads, who lasted till 750, was founded by men
whose acceptance of Mohammed was purely political, and it remained
always opposed to the more fanatical among the faithful. The Arabs,
although they conquered a great part of the world in the name of a new
religion, were not a very religious race; the motive of their conquests
was plunder and wealth rather than religion. It was only in virtue of
their lack of fanaticism that a handful of warriors were able to govern,
without much difficulty, vast populations of higher civilization and
alien religion.</p>
<p>The Persians, on the contrary, have been, from the earliest times,
deeply religious and highly speculative. After their conversion, they
made out of Islam something much more interesting, more religious, and
more philosophical, than had been imagined by the Prophet and his
kinsmen. Ever since the death of Mohammed’s son-in-law Ali in 661,
Mohammedans have been divided into two sects, the Sunni and the Shiah.
The former is the larger; the latter follows Ali, and considers the
Umayyad dynasty to have been usurpers. The Persians have long belonged
to the Shiah sect. Largely by Persian influence, the Umayyads were at
last overthrown, and succeeded by the Abbasids, who represented Persian
interests. The change was marked by the removal of the capital from
Damascus to Baghdad.</p>
<p>The Abbasids were, politically, more in favour of the fanatics than
the Umayyads had been. They did not, however, acquire the whole of the
empire. One member of the Umayyad family escaped the general massacre,
fled to Spain, and was there acknowledged as the legitimate ruler. From
that time on, Spain was independent of the rest of the Mohammedan
world.</p>
<p>Under the early Abbasids the caliphate attained its greatest
splendour. The best known of them is Harun-al-Rashid (d. 809), who was a
contemporary of Charlemagne and the Empress Irene, and is known to every
one in legendary form through the Arabian Nights. His court was a
brilliant centre of luxury, poetry, and learning; his revenue was
enormous; his empire stretched from the Straits of Gibraltar to the
Indus. His will was absolute; he was habitually accompanied by the
executioner, who performed his office at a nod from the caliph. This
splendour, however, was short-lived. His successor made the mistake of
composing his army mainly of Turks, who were insubordinate, and soon
reduced the caliph to a cipher to be blinded or murdered whenever the
soldiery grew tired of him. Nevertheless, the caliphate lingered on; the
last caliph of the Abbasid dynasty was put to death by the Mongols in
1256, along with 800,000 of the inhabitants of Baghdad.</p>
<p>The political and social system of the Arabs had defects similar to
those of the Roman Empire, together with some others. Absolute monarchy
combined with polygamy led, as it usually does, to dynastic wars
whenever a ruler died, ending with the victory of one of the ruler’s
sons and the death of all the rest. There were immense numbers of
slaves, largely as a result of successful wars; at times there were
dangerous servile insurrections. Com-merce was greatly developed, the
more so as the caliphate occupied a central position between East and
West. ’Not only did the possession of enormous wealth create a demand
for costly articles, such as silks from China, and furs from Northern
Europe, but trade was promoted by certain special conditions, such as
the vast extent of the Muslim Empire, the spread of Arabic as a world
language, and the exalted status assigned to the merchant in the Muslim
system of ethics; it was remembered that the Prophet himself had been a
merchant and had commended trading during the pilgrimage to Mecca.’2
This commerce, like military cohesion, depended on the great roads which
the Arabs inherited from the Romans and Persians, and which they, unlike
the Northern conquerors, did not allow to fall into disrepair.
Gradually, however, the empire broke up into fractions—Spain, Persia,
North Africa, and Egypt successively split off and acquired complete or
almost complete independence.</p>
<p>One of the best features of the Arab economy was agriculture,
particularly the skilful use of irrigation, which they learnt from
living where water is scarce. To this day Spanish agriculture profits by
Arab irrigation works.</p>
<p>The distinctive culture of the Muslim world, though it began in
Syria, soon came to flourish most in the Eastern and Western
extremities, Persia and Spain. The Syrians, at the time of the conquest,
were admirers of Aristotle, whom Nestorians preferred to Plato, the
philosopher favoured by Catholics. The Arabs first acquired their
knowledge of Greek philosophy from the Syrians, and thus, from the
beginning, they thought Aristotle more important than Plato.
Nevertheless, their Aristotle wore a Neoplatonic dress. Kindi (d. ca.
873), the first to write philosophy in Arabic, and the only philosopher
of note who was himself an Arab, translated parts of the Enneads of
Plotinus, and published his translation under the title The Theology of
Aristotle. This introduced great confusion into Arabic ideas of
Aristotle, from which it took centuries to recover.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Persia, Muslims came in contact with India. It was from
Sanskrit writings that they acquired, during the eighth century, their
first knowledge of astronomy. About 830, Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarazmi,
a translator of mathematical and astronomical books from the Sanskrit,
published a book which was translated into Latin in the twelfth century,
under the title Algoritmi de numero Indrum. It was from this book that
the West first learnt of what we call ‘Arabic’ numerals, which ought to
be called ‘Indian’. The same author wrote a book on algebra which was
used in the West as a text-book until the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Persian civilization remained both intellectually and artistically
admirable, though it was seriously damaged by the invasion of the
Mongols in the thirteenth century. Omar Khayyám, the only man known to
me who was both a poet and a mathematician, reformed the calendar in
1079. His best friend, oddly enough, was the founder of the sect of the
Assassins, the ‘Old Man of the Mountain’, of legendary fame. The
Persians were great poets: Firdousi (ca. 941), author of the Shahnama,
is said by those who have read him</p>
<p>to be comparable to Homer. They were also remarkable as mystics,
which other Mohammedans were not. The Sufi sect, which still exists,
allowed itself great latitude in the mystical and allegorical
interpretation of orthodox dogma; it was more or less Neoplatonic.</p>
<p>The Nestorians, through whom, at first, Greek influences came into
the Muslim world, were by no means purely Greek in their outlook. Their
school at Edessa had been closed by the Emperor Zeno in 481; its learned
men thereupon migrated to Persia, where they continued their work, but
not without suffering Persian influences. The Nestorians valued
Aristotle only for his logic, and it was above all his logic that the
Arabic philosophers thought important at first. Later, however, they
studied also his Metaphysics and his De Anima. Arabic philosophers, in
general, are encyclopedic: they are interested in alchemy, astrology,
astronomy, and zoology, as much as in what we should call philosophy.
They were looked upon with suspicion by the populace, which was
fanatical and bigoted; they owed their safety (when they were safe) to
the protection of comparatively free-thinking princes.</p>
<p>Two Mohammedan philosophers, one of Persia, one of Spain, demand
special notice; they are Avicenna and Averroes. Of these the former is
the more famous among Mohammedans, the latter among Christians.</p>
<p>Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (980–1037) spent his life in the sort of places
that one used to think only exist in poetry. He was born in the province
of Bokhara; at the age of twenty-four he went to Khiva—‘lone Khiva in
the waste’—then to Khorassan—‘the lone Chorasmian shore’. For a while he
taught medicine and philosophy at Ispahan; then he settled at Teheran.
He was even more famous in medicine than in philosophy, though he added
little to Galen. From the twelfth to the seventeenth century, he was
used in Europe as a guide to medicine. He was not a saintly character,
in fact he had a passion for wine and women. He was suspect to the
orthodox, but was befriended by princes on account of his medical skill.
At times he got into trouble owing to the hostility of Turkish
mercenaries; sometimes he was in hiding, sometimes in prison. He was the
author of an encyclopedia, almost unknown to the East because of the
hostility of theologians, but influential in the West through Latin
translations. His psychology has an empirical tendency.</p>
<p>His philosophy is nearer to Aristotle, and less Neoplatonic, than
that of his Muslim predecessors. Like the Christian scholastics later,
he is occupied with the problem of universals. Plato said they were
anterior to things. Aristotle has two views, one when he is thinking,
the other when he is combating Plato. This makes him ideal material for
the commentator.</p>
<p>Avicenna invented a formula, which was repeated by Averroes and
Albertus Magnus: ‘Thought brings about the generality in forms.’ From
this it might be supposed that he did not believe in universals apart
from thought. This, however, would be an unduly simple view. Genera—that
is, universals—are, he says, at once before things, in things, and after
things. He explains this as follows. They are before things in God’s
understanding. (God decides, for instance, to create cats. This requires
that He should have the idea ‘cat’, which is thus, in this respect,
anterior to particular cats.) Genera are in things in natural objects.
(When cats have been created, felinity is in each of them.) Genera are
after things in our thought. (When we have seen many cats, we notice
their likeness to each other, and arrive at the general idea ‘cat’.)
This view is obviously intended to reconcile different theories.</p>
<p>Averroes (Ibn Rushd) (1126–98) lived at the opposite end of the
Muslim world from Avicenna. He was born at Cordova, where his father and
grandfather had been cadis; he himself was a cadi, first in Seville,
then in Cordova. He studied, first, theology and jurisprudence, then
medicine, mathematics, and philosophy. He was recommended to the
‘Caliph’ Abu Yaqub Yusuf as a man capable of making an analysis of the
works of Aristotle. (It seems, however, that he did not know Greek.)
This ruler took him into favour; in 1184 he made him his physician, but
unfortunately the patient died two years later. His successor, Yaqub
Al-Mansur, for eleven years continued his father’s patronage; then,
alarmed by the opposition of the orthodox to the philosopher, he
deprived him of his position, and exiled him, first to a small place
near Cordova, and then to Morocco. He was accused of cultivating the
philosophy of the ancients at the expense of the true faith. Al-Mansur
published an edict to the effect that God had decreed hell-fire for
those who thought that truth could be found by the unaided reason. All
the books that could be found on logic and metaphysics were given to the
flames.3</p>
<p>Shortly after this time the Moorish territory in Spain was greatly
diminished by Christian conquests. Muslim philosophy in Spain ended with
Averroes; and in the rest of the Mohammedan world a rigid orthodoxy put
an end to speculation.</p>
<p>Ueberweg, rather amusingly, undertakes to defend Averroes against the
charge of unorthodoxy—a matter, one would say, for Muslims to decide.
Ueberweg points out that, according to the mystics, every text of the
Koran had 7 or 70 or 700 layers of interpretation, the literal meaning
being only for the ignorant vulgar. It would seem to follow that a
philosopher’s teaching could not possibly conflict with the Koran; for
among 700 interpretations there would surely be at least one that would
fit what the philosopher had to say. In the Mohammedan world, however,
the ignorant seem to have objected to all learning that went beyond a
knowledge of the Holy Book; it was dangerous, even if no specific heresy
could be demonstrated. The view of the mystics, that the populace should
take the Koran literally but wise people need not do so, was hardly
likely to win wide popular acceptance.</p>
<p>Averroes was concerned to improve the Arabic interpretation of
Aristotle, which had been unduly influenced by Neoplatonism. He gave to
Aristotle the sort of reverence that is given to the founder of a
religion—much more than was given even by Avicenna. He holds that the
existence of God can be proved by reason independently of revelation, a
view also held by Thomas Aquinas. As regards immortality, he seems to
have adhered closely to Aristotle, maintaining that the soul is not
immortal, but intellect (nous) is. This, however, does not secure
personal immortality, since intellect is one and the same when
manifested in different persons. This view, naturally, was combated by
Christian philosophers.</p>
<p>Averroes, like most of the later Mohammedan philosophers, though a
believer, was not rigidly orthodox. There was a sect of completely
orthodox theologians, who objected to all philosophy as deleterious to
the faith. One of these, named Algazel, wrote a book called Destruction
of the Philosophers, pointing out that, since all necessary truth is in
the Koran, there is no need of speculation independent of revelation.
Averroes replied by a book called Destruction of the Destruction. The
religious dogmas that Algazel specially upheld against the philosophers
were the creation of the world in time out of nothing, the reality of
the divine attributes, and the resurrection of the body. Averroes
regards religion as containing philosophic truth in allegorical form.
This applies in particular to creation, which he, in his philosophic
capacity, interprets in an Aristotelian fashion.</p>
<p>Averroes is more important in Christian than in Mohammedan
philosophy. In the latter he was a dead end; in the former, a beginning.
He was translated into Latin early in the thirteenth century by Michael
Scott; as his works belong to the latter half of the twelfth century,
this is surprising. His influence in Europe was very great, not only on
the scholastics, but also on a large body of unprofessional
free-thinkers, who denied immortality and were called Averroists. Among
professional philosophers, his admirers were at first especially among
the Franciscans and at the University of Paris. But this is a topic
which will be dealt with in a later chapter.</p>
<p>Arabic philosophy is not important as original thought. Men like
Avicenna and Averroes are essentially commentators. Speaking generally,
the views of the more scientific philosophers come from Aristotle and
the Neoplatonists in logic and metaphysics, from Galen in medicine, from
Greek and Indian sources in mathematics and astronomy, and among mystics
religious philosophy has also an admixture of old Persian beliefs.
Writers in Arabic showed some originality in mathematics and in
chemistry—in the latter case, as an incidental result of alchemical
researches. Mohammedan civilization in its great days was admirable in
the arts and in many technical ways, but it showed no capacity for
independent speculation in theoretical matters. Its importance, which
must not be under-rated, is as a transmitter. Between ancient and modern
European civilization, the dark ages intervened. The Mohammedans and the
Byzantines, while lacking the intellectual energy required for
innovation, preserved the apparatus of civilization—education, books,
and learned leisure. Both stimulated the West when it emerged from
barbarism—the Mohammedans chiefly in the thirteenth century, the
Byzantines chiefly in the fifteenth. In each case the stimulus produced
new thought better than any produced by the transmitters—in the one case
scholasticism, in the other the Renaissance (which however had other
causes also).</p>
<p>Between the Spanish Moors and the Christians, the Jews formed a
useful link. There were many Jews in Spain, who remained when the
country was reconquered by the Christians. Since they knew Arabic, and
perforce acquired the language of the Christians, they were able to
supply translations. Another means of transfusion arose through
Mohammedan persecution of Aristotelians in the thirteenth century, which
led Moorish philosophers to take refuge with Jews, especially in
Provence.</p>
<p>The Spanish Jews produced one philosopher of importance, Maimonides.
He was born in Cordova in 1135, but went to Cairo at the age of thirty,
and stayed there for the rest of his life. He wrote in Arabic, but was
immediately translated into Hebrew. A few decades after his death, he
was translated into Latin, probably at the request of the Emperor
Frederick II. He wrote a book called Guide to Wanderers, addressed to
philosophers who have lost their faith. Its purpose is to reconcile
Aristotle with Jewish theology. Aristotle is the authority on the
sublunary world, revelation on the heavenly. But philosophy and
revelation come together in the knowledge of God. The pursuit of truth
is a religious duty. Astrology is rejected. The Pentateuch is not always
to be taken literally; when the literal sense conflicts with reason, we
must seek an allegorical interpretation. As against Aristotle, he
maintains that God created not only form, but matter, out of nothing. He
gives a summary of the Timaeus (which he knew in Arabic), preferring it
on some points to Aristotle. The essence of God is unknowable, being
above all predicated perfections. The Jews considered him heretical, and
went so far as to invoke the Christian ecclesiastical authorities
against him. Some think that he influenced Spinoza, but this is very
questionable.</p>
