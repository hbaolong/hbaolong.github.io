<h4 id="john-dewey">30 JOHN DEWEY</h4>
<p>John Dewey, who was born in 1859, is generally admitted to be the
leading living philosopher of America. In this estimate I entirely
concur. He has had a profound influence, not only among philosophers,
but on students of education, aesthetics, and political theory. He is a
man of the highest character, liberal in outlook, generous and kind in
personal relations, indefatigable in work. With many of his opinions I
am in almost complete agreement. Owing to my respect and admiration for
him, as well as to personal experience of his kindness, I should wish to
agree completely, but to my regret I am compelled to dissent from his
most distinctive philosophical doctrine, namely the substitution of
‘inquiry’ for ‘truth’ as the fundamental concept of logic and theory of
knowledge.</p>
<p>Like William James, Dewey is a New Englander, and carries on the
tradition of New England liberalism, which has been abandoned by some of
the descendants of the great New Englanders of a hundred years ago. He
has never been what might be called a ‘mere’ philosopher. Education,
especially, has been in the forefront of his interests, and his
influence on American education has been profound. I, in my lesser way,
have tried to have an influence on education very similar to his.
Perhaps he, like me, has not always been satisfied with the practice of
those who professed to follow his teaching, but any new doctrine, in
practice, is bound to be subject to some extravagance and excess. This,
however, does not matter so much as might be thought, because the faults
of what is new are so much more easily seen than those of what is
traditional.</p>
<p>When Dewey became professor of philosophy at Chicago in 1894,
pedagogy was included among his subjects. He founded a progressive
school, and wrote much about education. What he wrote at this time was
summed up in his book The School and Society (1899), which is considered
the most influential of all his writings. He has continued to write on
education throughout his life, almost as much as on philosophy.</p>
<p>Other social and political questions have also had a large share of
his thought. Like myself, he was much influenced by visits to Russia and
China, negatively in the first case, positively in the second. He was
reluctantly a supporter of the first World War. He had an important part
in the inquiry as to Trotsky’s alleged guilt, and, while he was
convinced that the charges were unfounded, he did not think that the
Soviet régime would have been satisfactory if Trotsky instead of Stalin
had been Lenin’s successor. He became persuaded that violent revolution
leading to dictatorship is not the way to achieve a good society.
Although very liberal in all economic questions, he has never been a
Marxist. I heard him say once that, having emancipated himself with some
difficulty from the traditional orthodox theology, he was not going to
shackle himself with another. In all this his point of view is almost
identical with my own.</p>
<p>From the strictly philosophical point of view, the chief importance
of Dewey’s work lies in his criticism of the traditional notion of
‘truth’, which is embodied in the theory that he calls
‘instrumentalism’. Truth, as conceived by most professional
philosophers, is static and final, perfect and eternal; in religious
terminology, it may be identified with God’s thoughts, and with those
thoughts which, as rational beings, we share with God. The perfect model
of truth is the multiplication table, which is precise and certain and
free from all temporal dross. Since Pythagoras, and still more since
Plato, mathematics has been linked with theology, and has profoundly
influenced the theory of knowledge of most professional philosophers.
Dewey’s interests are biological rather than mathematical, and he
conceives thought as an evolutionary process. The traditional view
would, of course, admit that men gradually come to know more, but each
piece of knowledge, when achieved, is regarded as something final.
Hegel, it is true, does not regard human knowledge in this way. He
conceives human knowledge as an organic whole, gradually growing in
every part, and not perfect in any part until the whole is perfect. But
although the Hegelian philosophy influenced Dewey in his youth, it still
has its Absolute and its eternal world which is more real than the
temporal process. These can have no place in Dewey’s thought, for which
all reality is temporal, and process, though evolutionary, is not, as
for Hegel, the unfolding of an eternal Idea.</p>
<p>So far, I am in agreement with Dewey. Nor is this the end of my
agreement. Before embarking upon discussion of the points as to which I
differ, I will say a few words as to my own view of ‘truth’.</p>
<p>The first question is: What sort of thing is ‘true’ or ‘false’? The
simplest answer would be: a sentence. ‘Columbus crossed the ocean in
1492’ is true; ‘Columbus crossed the ocean in 1776’ is false. This
answer is correct, but incomplete. Sentences are true or false as the
case may be, because they are ‘significant’, and their significance
depends upon the language used. If you were translating an account of
Columbus into Arabic, you would have to alter ‘1492’ into the
corresponding year of the Mohammedan era. Sentences in different
languages may have the same significance, and it is the significance,
not the words, that determines whether the sentence is ‘true’ or
‘false’. When you assert a sentence, you express a ‘belief’, which may
be equally well expressed in a different language. The ‘belief’ whatever
it may be, is what is ‘true’ or ‘false’ or ‘more or less true’. Thus we
are driven to the investigation of ‘belief’.</p>
<p>Now a belief, provided it is sufficiently simple, may exist without
being expressed in words. It would be difficult, without using words, to
believe that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter
is approximately 3.14159, or that Caesar, when he decided to cross the
Rubicon, sealed the fate of the Roman republican constitution. But in
simple cases unverbalized beliefs are common. Suppose, for instance, in
descending a staircase, you make a mistake as to when you have got to
the bottom: you take a step suitable for level ground, and come down
with a bump. The result is a violent shock or surprise. You would
naturally say, ‘I thought I was at the bottom’, but in fact you were not
thinking about the stairs, or you would not have made the mistake. Your
muscles were adjusted in a way suitable to the bottom, when in fact you
were not yet there. It was your body rather than your mind that made the
mistake—at least that would be a natural way to express what happened.
But in fact the distinction between mind and body is a dubious one. It
will be better to speak of an ‘organism’, leaving the division of its
activities between the mind and the body undetermined. One can say,
then: your organism was adjusted in a manner which would have been
suitable if you had been at the bottom, but in fact was not suitable.
This failure of adjustment constituted error, and one may say that you
were entertaining a false belief.</p>
<p>The test or error in the above illustration is surprise. I think this
is true generally of beliefs that can be tested. A false belief is one
which, in suitable circumstances, will cause the person entertaining it
to experience surprise, while a true belief will not have this effect.
But although surprise is a good criterion when it is applicable, it does
not give the meaning of the words ‘true’ and ‘false’, and is not always
applicable. Suppose you are walking in a thunderstorm, and you say to
yourself, ‘I am not at all likely to be struck by lightning’. The next
moment you are struck, but you experience no surprise, because you are
dead. If one day the sun explodes, as Sir James Jeans seems to expect,
we shall all perish instantly, and therefore not be surprised, but
unless we expect the catastrophe we shall all have been mistaken. Such
illustrations suggest objectivity in truth and falsehood: what is true
(or false) is a state of the organism, but it is true (or false), in
general, in virtue of occurrences outside the organism. Sometimes
experimental tests are possible to determine truth and falsehood, but
sometimes they are not; when they are not, the alternative nevertheless
remains, and is significant.</p>
<p>I will not further develop my view of truth and falsehood, but will
proceed to the examination of Dewey’s doctrine.</p>
<p>Dewey does not aim at judgments that shall be absolutely ‘true’, or
condemn their contradictories as absolutely ‘false’. In his opinion
there is a process called ‘inquiry’, which is one form of mutual
adjustment between an organism and its environment. If I wished, from my
point of view, to go as far as possible towards agreeing with Dewey, I
should begin by an analysis of ‘meaning’ or ‘significance’. Suppose for
example you are at the Zoo, and you hear a voice through a megaphone
saying, ‘A lion has just escaped.’ You will, in that case, act as you
would if you saw the lion—that is to say, you will get away as quickly
as possible. The sentence ‘a lion has escaped’ means a certain
occurrence, in the sense that it promotes the same behaviour as the
occurrence would if you saw it. Broadly: a sentence S ‘means’ an event E
if it promotes behaviour which E would have promoted. If there has in
fact been no such occurrence, the sentence is false. Just the same
applies to a belief which is not expressed in words. One may say: a
belief is a state of an organism promoting behaviour such as a certain
occurrence would promote if sensibly present; the occurrence which would
promote this behaviour is the ‘significance’ of the belief. This
statement is unduly simplified, but it may serve to indicate the theory
I am advocating. So far, I do not think that Dewey and I would disagree
very much. But with his further developments I find myself in very
definite disagreement.</p>
<p>Dewey makes inquiry the essence of logic, not truth or knowledge. He
defines inquiry as follows: ‘Inquiry is the controlled or directed
transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so
determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert
the elements of the original situation into a unified whole.’ He adds
that ‘inquiry is concerned with objective transformations of objective
subject-matter’. This definition is plainly inadequate. Take for
instance the dealings of a drill-sergeant with a crowd of recruits, or
of a bricklayer with a heap of bricks; these exactly fulfil Dewey’s
definition of ‘inquiry’. Since he clearly would not include them, there
must be an element in his notion of ‘inquiry’ which he has forgotten to
mention in his definition. What this element is, I shall attempt to
determine in a moment. But let us first consider what emerges from the
definition as it stands.</p>
<p>It is clear that ‘inquiry’, as conceived by Dewey, is part of the
general process of attempting to make the world more organic. ‘Unified
wholes’ are to be the outcome of inquiries. Dewey’s love of what is
organic is due partly to biology, partly to the lingering influence of
Hegel. Unless on the basis of an unconscious Hegelian metaphysic, I do
not see why inquiry should be expected to result in ‘unified wholes’. If
I am given a pack of cards in disorder, and asked to inquire into their
sequence, I shall, if I follow Dewey’s prescription, first arrange them
in order, and then say that this was the order resulting from inquiry.
There will be, it is true, an ‘objective transformation of objective
subject-matter’ while I am arranging the cards, but the definition
allows for this. If, at the end, I am told: ‘We wanted to know the
sequence of the cards when they were given to you, not after you had
re-arranged them,’ I shall, if I am a disciple of Dewey, reply: ‘Your
ideas are altogether too static. I am a dynamic person, and when I
inquire into any subject-matter I first alter it in such a way as to
make the inquiry easy.’ The notion that such a procedure is legitimate
can only be justified by a Hegelian distinction of appearance and
reality: the appearance may be confused and fragmentary, but the reality
is always orderly and organic. Therefore when I arrange the cards I am
only revealing their true eternal nature. But this part of the doctrine
is never made explicit. The metaphysic of organism underlies Dewey’s
theories, but I do not know how far he is aware of this fact.</p>
<p>Let us now try to find the supplement to Dewey’s definition which is
required in order to distinguish inquiry from other kinds of organizing
activity, such as those of the drill-sergeant and the bricklayer.
Formerly it would have been said that inquiry is distinguished by its
purpose, which is to ascertain some truth. But for Dewey ‘truth’ is to
be defined in terms of ‘inquiry’, not vice versa; he quotes with
approval Peirce’s definition: ‘Truth’ is ‘the opinion which is fated to
be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate.’ This leaves us
completely in the dark as to what the investigators are doing, for we
cannot, without circularity, say that they are endeavouring to ascertain
the truth.</p>
<p>I think Dr Dewey’s theory might be stated as follows. The relations
of an organism to its environment are sometimes satisfactory to the
organism, sometimes unsatisfactory. When they are unsatisfactory, the
situation may be improved by mutual adjustment. When the alterations by
means of which the situation is improved are mainly on the side of the
organism—they are never wholly on either side—the process involved is
called ‘inquiry’. For example: during a battle you are mainly concerned
to alter the environment, i.e. the enemy; but during the preceding
period of reconnaissance you are mainly concerned to adapt your own
forces to his dispositions. This earlier period is one of ‘inquiry’.</p>
<p>The difficulty of this theory, to my mind, lies in the severing of
the relation between a belief and the fact or facts which would commonly
be said to ‘verify’ it. Let us continue to consider the example of a
general planning a battle. His reconnaissance planes report to him
certain enemy preparations, and he, in consequence, makes certain
counter-preparations. Common sense would say that the reports upon which
he acts are ‘true’ if, in fact, the enemy have made the moves which they
are said to have made, and that, in that case, the reports remain true
even if the general subsequently loses the battle. This view is rejected
by Dr Dewey. He does not divide beliefs into ‘true’ and ‘false’, but he
still has two kinds of beliefs, which we will call ‘satisfactory’ if the
general wins and ‘unsatisfactory’ if he is defeated. Until the battle
has taken place, he cannot tell what to think about the reports of his
scouts.</p>
<p>Generalizing, we may say that Dr Dewey, like everyone else, divides
beliefs into two classes, of which one is good and the other bad. He
holds, however, that a belief may be good at one time and bad at
another; this happens with imperfect theories which are better than
their predecessors but worse than their successors. Whether a belief is
good or bad depends upon whether the activities which it inspires in the
organism entertaining the belief have consequences which are
satisfactory or unsatisfactory to it. Thus a belief about some event in
the past is to be classified as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, not according to
whether the event really took place, but according to the future effects
of the belief. The results are curious. Suppose somebody says to me:
‘Did you have coffee with your breakfast this morning?’ If I am an
ordinary person, I shall try to remember. But if I am a disciple of Dr
Dewey I shall say: ‘Wait a while; I must try two experiments before I
can tell you.’ I shall then first make myself believe that I had coffee,
and observe the consequences, if any; I shall then make myself believe
that I did not have coffee, and again observe the consequences, if any.
I shall then compare the two sets of consequences, to see which I found
the more satisfactory. If there is a balance on one side I shall decide
for that answer. If there is not, I shall have to confess that I cannot
answer the question.</p>
<p>But this is not the end of our troubles. How am I to know the
consequences of believing that I had coffee for breakfast? If I say ‘the
consequences are such-and-such’, this in turn will have to be tested by
its consequences before I can know whether what I have said was a ‘good’
or a ‘bad’ statement. And even if this difficulty were overcome, how am
I to judge which set of consequences is the more satisfactory? One
decision as to whether I had coffee may fill me with contentment, the
other with determination to further the war effort. Each of these may be
considered good, but until I have decided which is better I cannot tell
whether I had coffee for breakfast. Surely this is absurd.</p>
<p>Dewey’s divergence from what has hitherto been regarded as common
sense is due to his refusal to admit ‘facts’ into his metaphysic, in the
sense in which ‘facts’ are stubborn and cannot be manipulated. In this
it may be that common sense is changing, and that his view will not seem
contrary to what common sense is becoming.</p>
<p>The main difference between Dr Dewey and me is that he judges a
belief by its effects, whereas I judge it by its causes where a past
occurrence is concerned. I consider such a belief ‘true’, or as nearly
‘true’ as we can make it, if it has a certain kind of relation
(sometimes very complicated) to its causes. Dr Dewey holds that it has
‘warranted assertability’—which he substitutes for ‘truth’—if it has
certain kinds of effects. This divergence is connected with a difference
of outlook on the world. The past cannot be affected by what we do, and
therefore, if truth is determined by what has happened, it is
independent of present or future volitions; it represents, in logical
form, the limitations on human power. But if truth, or rather ‘warranted
assertability’, depends upon the future, then, in so far as it is in our
power to alter the future, it is in our power to alter what should be
asserted. This enlarges the sense of human power and freedom. Did Caesar
cross the Rubicon? I should regard an affirmative answer as unalterably
necessitated by a past event. Dr Dewey would decide whether to say yes
or no by an appraisal of future events, and there is no reason why these
future events could not be arranged by human power so as to make a
negative answer the more satisfactory. If I find the belief that Caesar
crossed the Rubicon very distasteful, I need not sit down in dull
despair; I can, if I have enough skill and power, arrange a social
environment in which the statement that he did not cross the Rubicon
will have ‘warranted assertability’.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, I have sought, where possible, to connect
philosophies with the social environment of the philosophers concerned.
It has seemed to me that the belief in human power, and the
unwillingness to admit ‘stubborn facts’, were connected with the
hopefulness engendered by machine production and the scientific
manipulation of our physical environment. This view is shared by many of
Dr Dewey’s supporters. Thus George Raymond Geiger, in a laudatory essay,
says that Dr Dewey’s method ‘would mean a revolution in thought just as
middle-class and unspectacular, but just as stupendous, as the
revolution in industry of a century ago’. It seemed to me that I was
saying the same thing when I wrote ‘Dr Dewey has an outlook which, where
it is distinctive, is in harmony with the age of industrialism and
collective enterprise. It is natural that his strongest appeal should be
to Americans, and also that he should be almost equally appreciated by
the progressive elements in countries like China and Mexico.’</p>
<p>To my regret and surprise, this statement, which I had supposed
completely innocuous, vexed Dr Dewey, who replied: ‘Mr Russell’s
confirmed habit of connecting the pragmatic theory of knowing with
obnoxious aspects of American industrialism … is much as if I were to
link his philosophy to the interests of the English landed
aristocracy.’</p>
<p>For my part, I am accustomed to having my opinions explained
(especially by Communists) as due to my connection with the British
aristocracy, and I am quite willing to suppose that my views, like other
men’s, are influenced by social environment. But if, in regard to Dr
Dewey, I am mistaken as to the social influences concerned, I regret the
mistake. I find, however, that I am not alone in having made it.
Santayana, for instance, says: ‘In Dewey, as in current science and
ethics, there is a pervasive quasi-Hegelian tendency to dissolve the
individual into his social functions, as well as everything substantial
and actual into something relative and transitional.’</p>
<p>Dr Dewey’s world, it seems to me, is one in which human beings occupy
the imagination; the cosmos of astronomy, though of course acknowledged
to exist, is at most times ignored. His philosophy is a power
philosophy, though not, like Nietzsche’s, a philosophy of individual
power; it is the power of the community that is felt to be valuable. It
is this element of social power that seems to me to make the philosophy
of instrumentalism attractive to those who are more impressed by our new
control over natural forces than by the limitations to which that
control is still subject.</p>
<p>The attitude of man towards the non-human environment has differed
profoundly at different times. The Greeks, with their dread of hubris
and their belief in a Necessity or Fate superior even to Zeus, carefully
avoided what would have seemed to them insolence towards the universe.
The Middle Ages carried submission much further: humility towards God
was a Christian’s first duty. Initiative was cramped by this attitude,
and great originality was scarcely possible. The Renaissance restored
human pride, but carried it to the point where it led to anarchy and
disaster. Its work was largely undone by the Reformation and the
Counter-reformation. But modern technique, while not altogether
favourable to the lordly individual of the Renaissance, has revived the
sense of the collective power of human communities. Man, formerly too
humble, begins to think of himself as almost a God. The Italian
pragmatist Papini urges us to substitute the ‘Imitation of God’ for the
‘Imitation of Christ’.</p>
<p>In all this I feel a grave danger, the danger of what might be called
cosmic impiety. The concept of ‘truth’ as something dependent upon facts
largely outside human control has been one of the ways in which
philosophy hitherto has inculcated the necessary element of humility.
When this check upon pride is removed, a further step is taken on the
road towards a certain kind of madness—the intoxication of power which
invaded philosophy with Fichte, and to which modern men, whether
philosophers or not, are prone. I am persuaded that this intoxication is
the greatest danger of our time, and that any philosophy which, however
unintentionally, contributes to it is increasing the danger of vast
social disaster.</p>
