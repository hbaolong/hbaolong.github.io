<h4 id="general-characteristics">1 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
<p>The period of history which is commonly called ‘modern’ has a mental
outlook which differs from that of the medieval period in many ways. Of
these, two are the most important: the diminishing authority of the
Church, and the increasing authority of science. With these two, others
are connected. The culture of modern times is more lay than clerical.
States increasingly replace the Church as the governmental authority
that controls culture. The government of nations is, at first, mainly in
the hands of kings; then, as in ancient Greece, the kings are gradually
replaced by democracies or tyrants. The power of the national State, and
the functions that it performs, grow steadily throughout the whole
period (apart from some minor fluctuations); but at most times the State
has less influence on the opinions of philosophers than the Church had
in the Middle Ages. The feudal aristocracy, which, north of the Alps,
had been able, till the fifteenth century, to hold its own against
central governments, loses first its political and then its economic
importance. It is replaced by the king in alliance with rich merchants;
these two share power in different proportions in different countries.
There is a tendency for the rich merchants to become absorbed into the
aristocracy. From the time of the American and French Revolutions
onwards, democracy, in the modern sense, becomes an important political
force. Socialism, as opposed to democracy based on private property,
first acquires governmental power in 1917. This form of government,
however, if it spreads, must obviously bring with it a new form of
culture; the culture with which we shall be concerned is in the main
‘liberal’, that is to say, of the kind most naturally associated with
commerce. To this there are important exceptions, especially in Germany;
Fichte and Hegel, to take two examples, have an outlook which is totally
unconnected with commerce. But such exceptions are not typical of their
age.</p>
<p>The rejection of ecclesiastical authority, which is the negative
characteristic of the modern age, begins earlier than the positive
characteristic, which is the acceptance of scientific authority. In the
Italian renaissance, science played a very small part; the opposition to
the Church, in men’s thoughts, was connected with antiquity, and looked
still to the past, but to a more distant past than that of the early
Church and the Middle Ages. The first serious irruption of science was
the publication of the Copernican theory in 1543; but this theory did
not become influential until it was taken up and improved by Kepler and
Galileo in the seventeenth century. Then began the long fight between
science and dogma, in which traditionalists fought a losing battle
against new knowledge.</p>
<p>The authority of science, which is recognized by most philosophers of
the modern epoch, is a very different thing from the authority of the
Church, since it is intellectual, not governmental. No penalties fall
upon those who reject it; no prudential arguments influence those who
accept it. It prevails solely by its intrinsic appeal to reason. It is,
moreover, a piecemeal and partial authority; it does not, like the body
of Catholic dogma, lay down a complete system, covering human morality,
human hopes, and the past and future history of the universe. It
pronounces only on whatever, at the time, appears to have been
scientifically ascertained, which is a small island in an ocean of
nescience. There is yet another difference from ecclesiastical
authority, which declares its pronouncements to be absolutely certain
and eternally unalterable: the pronouncements of science are made
tentatively, on a basis of probability, and are regarded as liable to
modification. This produces a temper of mind very different from that of
the medieval dogmatist.</p>
<p>So far, I have been speaking of theoretical science, which is an
attempt to understand the world. Practical science, which is an attempt
to change the world, has been important from the first, and has
continually increased in importance, until it has almost ousted
theoretical science from men’s thoughts. The practical importance of
science was first recognized in connection with war; Galileo and
Leonardo obtained government employment by their claim to improve
artillery and the art of fortification. From their time onwards, the
part of men of science in war has steadily grown greater. Their part in
developing machine production, and accustoming the population to the
use, first of steam, then of electricity, came later, and did not begin
to have important political effects until near the end of the nineteenth
century. The triumph of science has been mainly due to its practical
utility, and there has been an attempt to divorce this aspect from that
of theory, thus making science more and more a technique, and less and
less a doctrine as to the nature of the world. The penetration of this
point of view to the philosophers is very recent.</p>
<p>Emancipation from the authority of the Church led to the growth of
individualism, even to the point of anarchy. Discipline, intellectual,
moral, and political, was associated in the minds of the men of the
Renaissance with the scholastic philosophy and ecclesiastical
government. The Aristotelian logic of the Schoolmen was narrow, but
afforded a training in a certain kind of accuracy. When this school of
logic became unfashionable, it was not, at first, succeeded by something
better, but only by an eclectic imitation of ancient models. Until the
seventeenth century, there was nothing of importance in philosophy. The
moral and political anarchy of fifteenth-century Italy was appalling,
and gave rise to the doctrines of Machiavelli. At the same time, the
freedom from mental shackles led to an astonishing display of genius in
art and literature. But such a society is unstable. The Reformation and
the Counter-Reformation, combined with the subjection of Italy to Spain,
put an end to both the good and the bad of the Italian Renaissance. When
the movement spread north of the Alps, it had not the same anarchic
character.</p>
<p>Modern philosophy, however, has retained, for the most part, an
individualistic and subjective tendency. This is very marked in
Descartes, who builds up all knowledge from the certainty of his own
existence, and accepts clearness and distinctness (both subjective) as
criteria of truth. It is not prominent in Spinoza, but reappears in
Leibniz’s windowless monads. Locke, whose temperament is thoroughly
objective, is forced reluctantly into the subjective doctrine that
knowledge is of the agreement or disagreement of ideas—a view so
repulsive to him that he escapes from it by violent inconsistencies.
Berkeley, after abolishing matter, is only saved from complete
subjectivism by a use of God which most subsequent philosophers have
regarded as illegitimate. In Hume, the empiricist philosophy culminated
in a scepticism which none could refute and none could accept. Kant and
Fichte were subjective in temperament as well as in doctrine; Hegel
saved himself by means of the influence of Spinoza. Rousseau and the
romantic movement extended subjectivity from theory of knowledge to
ethics and politics, and ended, logically, in complete anarchism such as
that of Bakunin. This extreme of subjectivism is a form of madness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile science as technique was building up in practical men a
quite different outlook from any that was to be found among theoretical
philosophers. Technique conferred a sense of power: man is now much less
at the mercy of his environment than he was in former times. But the
power conferred by technique is social, not individual; an average
individual wrecked on a desert island could have achieved more in the
seventeenth century than he could now. Scientific technique requires the
co-operation of a large number of individuals organized under a single
direction. Its tendency, therefore, is against anarchism and even
individualism, since it demands a well-knit social structure. Unlike
religion, it is ethically neutral: it assures men that they can perform
wonders, but does not tell them what wonders to perform. In this way it
is incomplete. In practice, the purposes to which scientific skill will
be devoted depend largely on chance. The men at the head of the vast
organizations which it necessitates can, within limits, turn it this way
or that as they please. The power impulse thus has a scope which it
never had before. The philosophies that have been inspired by scientific
technique are power philosophies, and tend to regard everything
non-human as mere raw material. Ends are no longer considered; only the
skilfulness of the process is valued. This also is a form of madness. It
is, in our day, the most dangerous form, and the one against which a
sane philosophy should provide an antidote.</p>
<p>The ancient world found an end to anarchy in the Roman Empire, but
the Roman Empire was a brute fact, not an idea. The Catholic world
sought an end to anarchy in the Church, which was an idea, but was never
adequately embodied in fact. Neither the ancient nor the medieval
solution was satisfactory—the one because it could not be idealized, the
other because it could not be actualized. The modern world, at present,
seems to be moving towards a solution like that of antiquity: a social
order imposed by force, representing the will of the powerful rather
than the hopes of common men. The problem of a durable and satisfactory
social order can only be solved by combining the solidity of the Roman
Empire with the idealism of St Augustine’s City of God. To achieve this
a new philosophy will be needed.</p>
