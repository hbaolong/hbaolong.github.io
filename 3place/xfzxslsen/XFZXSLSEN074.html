<h4 id="the-utilitarians1">26 THE UTILITARIANS1</h4>
<p>Throughout the period from Kant to Nietzsche, professional
philosophers in Great Britain remained almost completely unaffected by
their German contemporaries, with the sole exception of Sir William
Hamilton, who had little influence. Coleridge and Carlyle, it is true,
were profoundly affected by Kant, Fichte, and the German Romantics, but
they were not philosophers in the technical sense. Somebody seems to
have once mentioned Kant to James Mill, who, after a cursory inspection,
remarked: ‘I see well enough what poor Kant would be at.’ But this
degree of recognition is exceptional; in general, there is complete
silence about the Germans. Bentham and his school derived their
philosophy, in all its main outlines, from Locke, Hartley, and
Helvetius; their importance is not so much philosophical as political,
as the leaders of British radicalism, and as the men who unintentionally
prepared the way for the doctrines of socialism.</p>
<p>Jeremy Bentham, who was the recognized leader of the ‘Philosophical
Radicals’, was not the sort of man one expects to find at the head of a
movement of this sort. He was born in 1748, but did not become a Radical
till 1808. He was painfully shy, and could not without great trepidation
endure the company of strangers. He wrote voluminously, but never
bothered to publish; what was published under his name had been
benevolently purloined by his friends. His main interest was
jurisprudence, in which he recognized Helvetius and Beccaria as his most
important predecessors. It was through the theory of law that he became
interested in ethics and politics.</p>
<p>He bases his whole philosophy on two principles, the ‘association
principle’, and the ‘greatest-happiness principle’. The association
principle had been emphasized by Hartley in 1749; before him, though
association of ideas was recognized as occurring, it was regarded, for
instance by Locke, only as a source of trivial errors. Bentham,
following Hartley, made it the basic principle of psychology. He
recognizes association of ideas and language, and also association of
ideas and ideas. By means of this principle he aims at a deterministic
account of mental occurrences. In essence the doctrine is the same as
the more modern theory of the ‘conditioned reflex’, based on Pavlov’s
experiments. The only important difference is that Pavlov’s conditioned
reflex is physiological, whereas the association of ideas was purely
mental. Pavlov’s work is therefore capable of a materialistic
explanation, such as is given to it by the behaviourists, whereas the
association of ideas led rather towards a psychology more or less
independent of physiology. There can be no doubt that, scientifically,
the principle of the conditioned reflex is an advance on the older
principle. Pavlov’s principle is this: Given a reflex according to which
a stimulus B produces a reaction C, and given that a certain animal has
frequently experienced a stimulus A at the same time as B, it often
happens that in time the stimulus A will produce the reaction C even
when B is absent. To determine the circumstances under which this
happens is a matter of experiment. Clearly, if we substitute ideas for
A, B, and C, Pavlov’s principle becomes that of the association of
ideas.</p>
<p>Both principles, indubitably, are valid over a certain field; the
only controversial question is as to the extent of this field. Bentham
and his followers exaggerated the extent of the field in the case of
Hartley’s principle, as certain behaviourists have in the case of
Pavlov’s principle.</p>
<p>To Bentham, determinism in psychology was important, because he
wished to establish a code of laws—and, more generally, a social
system—which would automatically make men virtuous. His second
principle, that of the greatest happiness, became necessary at this
point in order to define ‘virtue’.</p>
<p>Bentham maintained that what is good is pleasure or happiness—he used
these words as synonyms—and what is bad is pain. Therefore one state of
affairs is better than another if it involves a greater balance of
pleasure over pain, or a smaller balance of pain over pleasure. Of all
possible states of affairs, that one is best which involves the greatest
balance of pleasure over pain.</p>
<p>There is nothing new in this doctrine, which came to be called
‘utilitarianism’. It had been advocated by Hutcheson as early as 1725.
Bentham attributes it to Priestley, who, however, had no special claim
to it. It is virtually contained in Locke. Bentham’s merit consisted,
not in the doctrine, but in his vigorous application of it to various
practical problems.</p>
<p>Bentham held not only that the good is happiness in general, but also
that each individual always pursues what he believes to be his own
happiness. The business of the legislator, therefore, is to produce
harmony between public and private interests. It is to the interest of
the public that I should abstain from theft, but it is not to my
interest except where there is an effective criminal law. Thus the
criminal law is a method of making the interests of the individual
coincide with those of the community; that is its justification.</p>
<p>Men are to be punished by the criminal law in order to prevent crime,
not because we hate the criminal. It is more important that the
punishment should be certain than that it should be severe. In his day,
in England, many quite minor offences were subject to the death penalty,
with the result that juries often refused to convict because they
thought the penalty excessive. Bentham advocated abolition of the death
penalty for all but the worst offences, and before he died the criminal
law had been mitigated in this respect.</p>
<p>Civil law, he says, should have four aims: subsistence, abundance,
security, and equality. It will be observed that he does not mention
liberty. In fact, he cared little for liberty. He admired the benevolent
autocrats who preceded the French Revolution—Catherine the Great and the
Emperor Francis. He had a great contempt for the doctrine of the rights
of man. The rights of man, he said, are plain nonsense; the
imprescriptible rights of man, nonsense on stilts. When the French
revolutionaries made their ‘Déclaration des droits de l’homme,’ Bentham
called it ‘a metaphysical work—the ne plus ultra of metaphysics’. Its
articles, he said, could be divided into three classes: (1) Those that
are unintelligible, (2) those that are false, (3) those that are
both.</p>
<p>Bentham’s ideal, like that of Epicurus, was security, not liberty.
‘Wars and storms are best to read of, but peace and calms are better to
endure.’</p>
<p>His gradual evolution towards Radicalism had two sources: on the one
hand, a belief in equality, deduced from the calculus of pleasures and
pains; on the other hand, an inflexible determination to submit
everything to the arbitrament of reason as he understood it. His love of
equality early led him to advocate equal division of a man’s property
among his children, and to oppose testamentary freedom. In later years
it led him to oppose monarchy and hereditary aristocracy, and to
advocate complete democracy, including votes for women. His refusal to
believe without rational grounds led him to reject religion, including
belief in God; it made him keenly critical of absurdities and anomalies
in the law, however venerable their historical origin. He would not
excuse anything on the ground that it was traditional. From early youth
he was opposed to imperialism, whether that of the British in America,
or that of other nations; he considered colonies a folly.</p>
<p>It was through the influence of James Mill that Bentham was induced
to take sides in practical politics. James Mill was twenty-five years
younger than Bentham, and an ardent disciple of his doctrines, but he
was also an active Radical. Bentham gave Mill a house (which had
belonged to Milton), and assisted him financially while he wrote a
history of India. When this history was finished, the East India Company
gave James Mill a post, as they did afterwards to his son until their
abolition as a sequel to the Mutiny. James Mill greatly admired
Condorcet and Helvetius. Like all Radicals of that period, he believed
in the omnipotence of education. He practised his theories on his son
John Stuart Mill, with results partly good, partly bad. The most
important bad result was that John Stuart could never quite shake off
his influence, even when he perceived that his father’s outlook had been
narrow.</p>
<p>James Mill, like Bentham, considered pleasure the only good and pain
the only evil. But like Epicurus he valued moderate pleasure most. He
thought intellectual enjoyments the best, and temperance the chief
virtue. ‘The intense was with him a bye-word of scornful
disapprobation,’ says his son, who adds that he objected to the modern
stress laid upon feeling. Like the whole utilitarian school, he was
utterly opposed to every form of romanticism. He thought politics could
be governed by reason, and expected men’s opinions to be determined by
the weight of evidence. If opposing sides in a controversy are presented
with equal skill, there is a moral certainty—so he held—that the greater
number will judge right. His outlook was limited by the poverty of his
emotional nature, but within his limitations he had the merits of
industry, disinterestedness, and rationality.</p>
<p>His son John Stuart Mill, who was born in 1806, carried on a somewhat
softened form of the Benthamite doctrine to the time of his death in
1873.</p>
<p>Throughout the middle portion of the nineteenth century, the
influence of the Benthamites on British legislation and policy was
astonishingly great, considering their complete absence of emotional
appeal.</p>
<p>Bentham advanced various arguments in favour of the view that the
general happiness is the summum bonum. Some of these arguments were
acute criticisms of other ethical theories. In his treatise on political
sophisms he says, in language which seems to anticipate Marx, that
sentimental and ascetic moralities serve the interests of the governing
class, and are the product of an aristocratic régime. Those who teach
the morality of sacrifice, he continues, are not victims of error: they
want others to sacrifice to them. The moral order, he says, results from
equilibrium of interests. Governing corporations pretend that there is
already identity of interests between the governors and the governed,
but reformers make it clear that this identity does not yet exist, and
try to bring it about. He maintains that only the principle of utility
can give a criterion in morals and legislation, and lay the foundation
of a social science. His main positive argument in favour of his
principle is that it is really implied by apparently different ethical
systems. This, however, is only made plausible by a severe restriction
of his survey.</p>
<p>There is an obvious lacuna in Bentham’s system. If every man always
pursues his own pleasure, how are we to secure that the legislator shall
pursue the pleasure of mankind in general? Bentham’s own instinctive
benevolence (which his psychological theories prevented him from
noticing) concealed the problem from him. If he had been employed to
draw up a code of laws for some country, he would have framed his
proposals in what he conceived to be the public interest, not so as to
further his own interests or (consciously) the interests of his class.
But if he had recognized this fact, he would have had to modify his
psychological doctrines. He seems to have thought that, by means of
democracy combined with adequate supervision, legislators could be so
controlled that they could only further their private interests by being
useful to the general public. There was in his day not much material for
forming a judgment as to the working of democratic institutions, and his
optimism was therefore perhaps excusable, but in our more disillusioned
age it seems somewhat naïve.</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill, in his Utilitarianism, offers an argument which is
so fallacious that it is hard to understand how he can have thought it
valid. He says: Pleasure is the only thing desired; therefore pleasure
is the only thing desirable. He argues that the only things visible are
things seen, the only things audible are things heard, and similarly the
only things desirable are things desired. He does not notice that a
thing is ‘visible’ if it can be seen, but ‘desirable’ if it ought to be
desired. Thus ‘desirable’ is a word presupposing an ethical theory; we
cannot infer what is desirable from what is desired.</p>
<p>Again: if each man in fact and inevitably pursues his own pleasure,
there is no point in saying he ought to do something else. Kant urged
that ‘you ought’ implies ‘you can’; conversely, if you cannot, it is
futile to say you ought. If each man must always pursue his own
pleasure, ethics is reduced to prudence: you may do well to further the
interests of others in the hope that they in turn will further yours.
Similarly in politics all co-operation is a matter of log-rolling. From
the premisses of the utilitarians no other conclusion is validly
deducible.</p>
<p>There are two distinct questions involved. First, does each man
pursue his own happiness? Second, is the general happiness the right end
of human action?</p>
<p>When it is said that each man desires his own happiness, the
statement is capable of two meanings, of which one is a truism and the
other is false. Whatever I may happen to desire, I shall get some
pleasure from achieving my wish; in this sense, whatever I desire is a
pleasure, and it may be said, though somewhat loosely, that pleasures
are what I desire. This is the sense of the doctrine which is a
truism.</p>
<p>But if what is meant is that, when I desire anything, I desire it
because of the pleasure that it will give me, that is usually untrue.
When I am hungry I desire food, and so long as my hunger persists food
will give me pleasure. But the hunger, which is a desire, comes first;
the pleasure is a consequence of the desire. I do not deny that there
are occasions when there is a direct desire for pleasure. If you have
decided to devote a free evening to the theatre, you will choose the
theatre that you think will give you the most pleasure. But the actions
thus determined by the direct desire for pleasure are exceptional and
unimportant. Everybody’s main activities are determined by desires which
are anterior to the calculation of pleasures and pains.</p>
<p>Anything whatever may be an object of desire; a masochist may desire
his own pain. The masochist, no doubt, derives pleasure from the pain
that he has desired, but the pleasure is because of the desire, not vice
versa. A man may desire something that does not affect him personally
except because of his desire—for instance, the victory of one side in a
war in which his country is neutral. He may desire an increase of
general happiness, or a mitigation of general suffering. Or he may, like
Carlyle, desire the exact opposite. As his desires vary, so do his
pleasures.</p>
<p>Ethics is necessary because men’s desires conflict. The primary cause
of conflict is egoism: most people are more interested in their own
welfare than in that of other people. But conflicts are equally possible
where there is no element of egoism. One man may wish everybody to be
Catholic, another may wish everybody to be Calvinist. Such non-egoistic
desires are frequently involved in social conflicts. Ethics has a
twofold purpose: first, to find a criterion by which to distinguish good
and bad desires; second, by means of praise and blame, to promote good
desires and discourage such as are bad.</p>
<p>The ethical part of the utilitarian doctrine, which is logically
independent of the psychological part, says: Those desires and those
actions are good which in fact promote the general happiness. This need
not be the intention of an action, but only its effect. Is there any
valid theoretical argument either for or against this doctrine? We found
ourselves faced with a similar question in relation to Nietzsche. His
ethic differs from that of the utilitarians, since it holds that only a
minority of the human race have ethical importance—the happiness or
unhappiness of the remainder should be ignored. I do not myself believe
that this disagreement can be dealt with by theoretical arguments such
as might be used in a scientific question. Obviously those who are
excluded from the Nietzschean aristocracy will object, and thus the
issue becomes political rather than theoretical. The utilitarian ethic
is democratic and anti-romantic. Democrats are likely to accept it, but
those who like a more Byronic view of the world can, in my opinion, be
refuted only practically, not by considerations which appeal only to
facts as opposed to desires.</p>
<p>The Philosophical Radicals were a transitional school. Their system
gave birth to two others, of more importance than itself, namely
Darwinism and Socialism. Darwinism was an application to the whole of
animal and vegetable life of Malthus’s theory of population, which was
an integral part of the politics and economics of the Benthamites—a
global free competition, in which victory went to the animals that most
resembled successful capitalists. Darwin himself was influenced by
Malthus, and was in general sympathy with the Philosophical Radicals.
There was, however, a great difference between the competition admired
by orthodox economists and the struggle for existence which Darwin
proclaimed as the motive force of evolution. ‘Free competition’, in
orthodox economics, is a very artificial conception, hedged in by legal
restrictions. You may undersell a competitor, but you must not murder
him. You must not use the armed forces of the State to help you to get
the better of foreign manufacturers. Those who have not the good fortune
to possess capital must not seek to improve their lot by revolution.
‘Free competition’, as understood by the Benthamites, was by no means
really free.</p>
<p>Darwinian competition was not of this limited sort; there were no
rules against hitting below the belt. The framework of law does not
exist among animals, nor is war excluded as a competitive method. The
use of the State to secure victory in competition was against the rules
as conceived by the Benthamites, but could not be excluded from the
Darwinian struggle. In fact, though Darwin himself was a Liberal, and
though Nietzsche never mentions him except with contempt, Darwin’s
‘Survival of the Fittest’ led, when thoroughly assimilated, to something
much more like Nietzsche’s philosophy than like Bentham’s. These
developments, however, belong to a later period, since Darwin’s Origin
of Species was published in 1859, and its political implications were
not at first perceived.</p>
<p>Socialism, on the contrary, began in the heyday of Benthamism, and as
a direct outcome of orthodox economics. Ricardo, who was intimately
associated with Bentham, Malthus, and James Mill, taught that the
exchange value of a commodity is entirely due to the labour expended in
producing it. He published this theory in 1817, and eight years later
Thomas Hodgskin, an ex-naval officer, published the first Socialist
rejoinder, Labour Defended Against the Claims of Capital. He argued that
if, as Ricardo taught, all value is conferred by labour, then all the
reward ought to go to labour; the share at present obtained by the
landowner and the capitalist must be mere extortion. Meanwhile Robert
Owen, after much practical experience as a manufacturer, had become
convinced of the doctrine which soon came to be called Socialism. (The
first use of the word ‘Socialist’ occurs in 1827, when it is applied to
the followers of Owen.) Machinery, he said, was displacing labour, and
laisser-faire gave the working classes no adequate means of combating
mechanical power. The method which he proposed for dealing with the evil
was the earliest form of modern Socialism.</p>
<p>Although Owen was a friend of Bentham, who had invested a
considerable sum of money in Owen’s business, the Philosophical Radicals
did not like his new doctrines; in fact, the advent of Socialism made
them less Radical and less philosophical than they had been. Hodgskin
secured a certain following in London, and James Mill was horrified. He
wrote:</p>
<p>‘Their notions of property look ugly; … they seem to think that it
should not exist, and that the existence of it is an evil to them.
Rascals, I have no doubt, are at work among them…. The fools, not to see
that what they madly desire would be such a calamity to them as no hands
but their own could bring upon them.’</p>
<p>This letter, written in 1831, may be taken as the beginning of the
long war between Capitalism and Socialism. In a later letter, James Mill
attributes the doctrine to the ‘mad nonsense’ of Hodgskin, and adds:
‘These opinions if they were to spread, would be the subversion of
civilized society; worse than the overwhelming deluge of Huns and
Tartars.’</p>
<p>Socialism, in so far as it is only political or economic, does not
come within the purview of a history of philosophy. But in the hands of
Karl Marx Socialism acquired a philosophy. His philosophy will be
considered in the next chapter.</p>
