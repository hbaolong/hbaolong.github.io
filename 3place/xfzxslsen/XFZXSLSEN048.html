<h4 id="the-eclipse-of-the-papacy">15 THE ECLIPSE OF THE PAPACY</h4>
<p>The thirteenth century had brought to completion a great synthesis,
philosophical, theological, political, and social, which had been slowly
built up by the combination of many elements. The first element was pure
Greek philosophy, especially the philosophies of Pythagoras, Parmenides,
Plato and Aristotle. Then came, as a result of Alexander’s conquests, a
great influx of oriental beliefs.1 These, taking advantage of Orphism
and the Mysteries, transformed the outlook of the Greek-speaking world,
and ultimately of the Latin-speaking world also. The dying and
resurrected god, the sacramental eating of what purported to be the
flesh of the god, the second birth into a new life through some ceremony
analogous to baptism, came to be part of the theology of large sections
of the pagan Roman world. With these was associated an ethic of
liberation from bondage to the flesh, which was, at least theoretically,
ascetic. From Syria, Egypt, Babylonia, and Persia came the institution
of a priesthood separated from the lay population, possessed of more or
less magical powers, and able to exert considerable political influence.
Impressive rituals, largely connected with belief in a life after death,
came from the same sources. From Persia, in particular, came a dualism
which regarded the world as the battleground of two great hosts, one,
which was good, led by Ahura Mazda, the other, which was evil, led by
Ahriman. Black magic was the kind that was worked by the help of Ahriman
and his followers in the world of spirits. Satan is a development of
Ahriman.</p>
<p>This influx of barbarian ideas and practices was synthesized with
certain Hellenic elements in the Neoplatonic philosophy. In Orphism,
Pythagoreanism, and some parts of Plato, the Greeks had developed points
of view which</p>
<p>were easy to combine with those of the Orient, perhaps because they
had been borrowed from the East at a much earlier time. With Plotinus
and Porphyry the development of pagan philosophy ends.</p>
<p>The thought of these men, however, though deeply religious, was not
capable, without much transformation, of inspiring a victorious popular
religion. Their philosophy was difficult, and could not be generally
understood; their way of salvation was too intellectual for the masses.
Their conservatism led them to uphold the traditional religion of
Greece, which, however, they had to interpret allegorically in order to
soften its immoral elements and to reconcile it with their philosophical
monotheism. The Greek religion had fallen into decay, being unable to
compete with Eastern rituals and theologies. The oracles had become
silent, and the priesthood had never formed a powerful distinct caste.
The attempt to revive Greek religion had therefore an archaistic
character which gave it a certain feebleness and pedantry, especially
noticeable in the Emperor Julian. Already in the third century, it could
have been foreseen that some Asiatic religion would conquer the Roman
world, though at that time there were still several competitors which
all seemed to have a chance of victory.</p>
<p>Christianity combined elements of strength from various sources. From
the Jews it accepted a Sacred Book and the doctrine that all religions
but one are false and evil; but it avoided the racial exclusiveness of
the Jews and the inconveniences of the Mosaic law. Later Judaism had
already learnt to believe in the life after death, but the Christians
gave a new definiteness to heaven and hell, and to the ways of reaching
the one and escaping the other. Easter combined the Jewish Passover with
pagan celebrations of the resurrected God. Persian dualism was absorbed,
but with a firmer assurance of the ultimate omnipotence of the good
principle, and with the addition that the pagan gods were followers of
Satan. At first the Christians were not the equals of their adversaries
in philosophy or in ritual, but gradually these deficiencies were made
good. At first, philosophy was more advanced among the semi-Christian
Gnostics than among the orthodox; but from the time of Origen onwards,
the Christians developed an adequate philosophy by modification of
Neoplatonism. Ritual among the early Christians is a somewhat obscure
subject, but at any rate by the time of St Ambrose it had become
extremely impressive. The power and the separateness of the priesthood
were taken from the East, but were gradually strengthened by methods of
government, in the Church, which owed much to the practice of the Roman
Empire. The Old Testament, the mystery religions, Greek philosophy, and
Roman methods of administration were all blended in the Catholic Church,
and combined to give it a strength which no earlier social organization
had equalled.</p>
<p>The Western Church, like ancient Rome, developed, though more slowly,
from a republic into a monarchy. We have seen the stages in the growth
of papal power, from Gregory the Great through Nicholas I, Gregory VII,
and Innocent III, to the final defeat of the Hohenstaufen in the wars of
Guelfs and Ghibellines. At the same time Christian philosophy, which had
hitherto been Augustinian and therefore largely Platonic, was enriched
by new elements due to contact with Constantinople and the Mohammedans.
Aristotle, during the thirteenth century, came to be known fairly
completely in the West, and, by the influence of Albertus Magnus and
Thomas Aquinas, was established in the minds of the learned as the
supreme authority after Scripture and the Church. Down to the present
day, he has retained this position among Catholic philosophers. I cannot
but think that the substitution of Aristotle for Plato and St Augustine
was a mistake from the Christian point of view. Plato’s temperament was
more religious than Aristotle’s, and Christian theology had been, from
almost the first, adapted to Platonism. Plato had taught that knowledge
is not perception, but a kind of reminiscent vision; Aristotle was much
more of an empiricist. St Thomas, little though he intended it, prepared
the way for the return from Platonic dreaming to scientific
observation.</p>
<p>Outward events had more to do than philosophy with the disintegration
of the Catholic synthesis which began in the fourteenth century. The
Byzantine Empire was conquered by the Latins in 1204, and remained in
their hands till 1261. During this time the religion of its government
was Catholic, not Greek; but after 1261 Constantinople was lost to the
Pope and never recovered, in spite of nominal union at Ferrara in 1438.
The defeat of the Western Empire in its conflict with the papacy proved
useless to the Church, owing to the rise of national monarchies in
France and England; throughout most of the fourteenth century the Pope
was, politically, a tool in the hands of the king of France. More
important than these causes was the rise of a rich commercial class and
the increase of knowledge in the laity. Both of these began in Italy,
and remained more advanced in that country than in other parts of the
West until the middle of the sixteenth century. North Italian cities
were much richer, in the fourteenth century, than any of the cities of
the North; and learned laymen, especially in law and medicine, were
becoming increasingly numerous. The cities had a spirit of independence
which, now that the Emperor was no longer a menace, was apt to turn
against the Pope. But the same movements, though to a lesser degree,
existed elsewhere. Flanders prospered; so did the Hanse towns. In
England the wool trade was a source of wealth. The age was one in which
tendencies which may be broadly called democratic were very strong, and
nationalistic tendencies were even stronger. The papacy, which had
become very worldly, appeared largely as a taxing agency, drawing to
itself vast revenues which most countries wished to retain at home. The
popes no longer had or deserved the moral authority which had given them
power. St Francis had been able to work in harmony with Innocent III and
Gregory IX, but the most earnest men of the fourteenth century were
driven into conflict with the papacy.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the century, however, these causes of decline in
the papacy were not yet apparent. Boniface VIII, in the Bull Unam
Sanctam, made more extreme claims than had ever been made by any
previous Pope. He instituted, in 1300, the year of Jubilee, when plenary
indulgence is granted to all Catholics who visit Rome and perform
certain ceremonies while there. This brought immense sums of money to
the coffers of the Curia and the pockets of the Roman people. There was
to be a Jubilee every hundredth year, but the profits were so great that
the period was shortened to fifty years, and then to twenty-five, at
which it remains to the present day. The first Jubilee, that of 1300,
showed the Pope at the summit of his success, and may be conveniently
regarded as the date from which the decline began.</p>
<p>Boniface VIII was an Italian, born at Anagni. He had been besieged in
the Tower of London when in England, on behalf of the Pope, to support
Henry III against the rebellious barons, but he was rescued in 1267 by
the King’s son, afterwards Edward I. There was already in his day a
powerful French party in the Church, and his election was opposed by the
French cardinals. He came into violent conflict with the French king
Philip IV, on the question whether the King had the right to tax the
French clergy. Boniface was addicted to nepotism and avarice; he
therefore wished to retain control over as many sources of revenue as
possible. He was accused of heresy, probably with justice; it seems that
he was an Averroist and did not believe in immortality. His quarrel with
the king of France became so bitter that the king sent a force to arrest
him, with a view to his being deposed by a General Council. He was
caught at Anagni, but escaped to Rome, where he died. After this, for a
long time, no pope ventured to oppose the king of France.</p>
<p>After a very brief intermediate reign, the cardinals in 1305 elected
the Archbishop of Bordeaux, who took the name of Clement V. He was a
Gascon, and consistently represented the French party in the Church.
Throughout his pontificate he never went to Italy. He was crowned in
Lyons, and in 1309, he settled in Avignon, where the popes remained for
about seventy years. Clement V signalized his alliance with the king of
France by their joint action against the Templars. Both needed money,
the Pope because he was addicted to favouritism and nepotism, Philip for
the English war, the Flemish revolt, and the costs of an increasingly
energetic government. After he had plundered the bankers of Lombardy,
and persecuted the Jews to the limit of ‘what the traffic would bear’,
it occurred to him that the Templars, in addition to being bankers, had
immense landed estates in France, which, with the Pope’s help, he might
acquire. It was therefore arranged that the Church should discover that
the Templars had fallen into heresy, and that king and pope should share
the spoils. On a given day in 1307, all the leading Templars in France
were arrested; a list of leading questions, previously drawn up, was put
to them all; under torture, they confessed that they had done homage to
Satan and committed various other abominations; at last, in 1313, the
Pope suppressed the order, and all its property was confiscated. The
best account of this proceeding is in Henry C. Lea’s History of the
Inquisition, where, after full investigation, the conclusion is reached
that the charges against the Templars were wholly without
foundation.</p>
<p>In the case of the Templars, the financial interests of pope and king
coincided. But on most occasions in most parts of Christendom, they
conflicted. In the time of Boniface VIII, Philip IV had secured the
support of the Estates (even the Estate of the Church) in his disputes
with the Pope as to taxation. When the popes became politically
subservient to France, the sovereigns hostile to the French king were
necessarily hostile to the Pope. This led to the protection of William
of Occam and Marsiglio of Padua by the Emperor; at a slightly later
date, it led to the protection of Wycliffe by John of Gaunt.</p>
<p>Bishops, in general, were by this time completely in subjection to
the Pope; in an increasing proportion, they were actually appointed by
him. The monastic Orders and the Dominicans were equally obedient, but
the Franciscans still had a certain spirit of independence. This led to
their conflict with John XXII, which we have already considered in
connection with William of Occam. During this conflict, Marsiglio
persuaded the Emperor to march on Rome, where the imperial crown was
conferred on him by the populace, and a Franciscan antipope was elected
after the populace had declared John XXII deposed. However, nothing came
of all this beyond a general diminution of respect for the papacy.</p>
<p>The revolt against papal domination took different forms in different
places. Sometimes it was associated with monarchical nationalism,
sometimes with a Puritan horror of the corruption and worldliness of the
papal court. In Rome itself, the revolt was associated with an
archaistic democracy. Under Clement VI (1342–52) Rome, for a time,
sought to free itself from the absentee Pope under the leadership of a
remarkable man, Cola di Rienzi. Rome suffered not only from the rule of
the popes, but also from the local aristocracy, which continued the
turbulence that had degraded the papacy in the tenth century. Indeed it
was partly to escape from the lawless Roman nobles that the popes had
fled to Avignon. At first Rienzi, who was the son of a tavern-keeper,
rebelled only against the nobles, and in this he had the support of the
Pope. He roused so much popular enthusiasm that the nobles fled (1347).
Petrarch, who admired him and wrote an ode to him, urged him to continue
his great and noble work. He took the title of tribune, and proclaimed
the sovereignty of the Roman people over the Empire. He seems to have
conceived this sovereignty democratically, for he called representatives
from the Italian cities to a sort of parliament. Success, however, gave
him delusions of grandeur. At this time, as at many others, there were
rival claimants to the Empire. Rienzi summoned both of them, and the
Electors, to come before him to have the issue decided. This naturally
turned both imperial candidates against him, and also the Pope, who
considered that it was for him to pronounce judgment in such matters.
Rienzi was captured by the Pope (1352), and kept in prison for two
years, until Clement VI died. Then he was released, and returned to
Rome, where he acquired power again for a few months. On this second
occasion, however, his popularity was brief, and in the end he was
murdered by the mob. Byron, as well as Petrarch, wrote a poem in his
praise.</p>
<p>It became evident that, if the papacy was to remain effectively the
head of the whole Catholic Church, it must free itself from dependence
on France by returning to Rome. Moreover, the Anglo-French war, in which
France was suffering severe defeats, made France unsafe. Urban V
therefore went to Rome in 1367; but Italian politics were too
complicated for him, and he returned to Avignon shortly before his
death. The next Pope, Gregory XI, was more resolute. Hostility to the
French curia had made many Italian towns, especially Florence, bitterly
anti-papal, but by returning to Rome and opposing the French cardinals
Gregory did everything in his power to save the situation. However, at
his death the French and Roman parties in the College of Cardinals
proved irreconcilable. In accordance with the wishes of the Roman party,
an Italian, Bartolomeo Prignano, was elected, and took the name of Urban
VI. But a number of Cardinals declared his election uncanonical, and
proceeded to elect Robert of Geneva, who belonged to the French party.
He took the name of Clement VII, and lived in Avignon.</p>
<p>Thus began the Great Schism, which lasted for some forty years.
France, of course, recognized the Avignon Pope, and the enemies of
France recognized the Roman Pope. Scotland was the enemy of England, and
England of France; therefore Scotland recognized the Avignon Pope. Each
pope chose cardinals from among his own partisans, and when either died
his cardinals quickly elected another. Thus there was no way of healing
the schism except by bringing to bear some power superior to both popes.
It was clear that one of them must be legitimate, therefore a power
superior to a legitimate pope had to be found. The only solution lay in
a General Council. The University of Paris, led by Gerson, developed a
new theory, giving powers of initiative to a Council. The lay
sovereigns, to whom the schism was inconvenient, lent their support. At
last, in 1409, a Council was summoned, and met at Pisa. It failed,
however, in a ridiculous manner. It declared both popes deposed for
heresy and schism, and elected a third, who promptly died; but his
cardinals elected as his successor an ex-pirate named Baldassare Cossa,
who took the name of John XXIII. Thus the net result was that there were
three popes instead of two, the conciliar pope being a notorious
ruffian. At this stage, the situation seemed more hopeless than
ever.</p>
<p>But the supporters of the conciliar movement did not give in. In
1414, a new Council was summoned at Constance, and proceeded to vigorous
action. It first decreed that popes cannot dissolve councils, and must
submit to them in certain respects; it also decided that future popes
must summon a General Council every seven years. It deposed John XXIII,
and induced the Roman Pope to resign. The Avignon Pope refused to
resign, and after his death the king of Aragon caused a successor to be
elected. But France, at this time at the mercy of England, refused to
recognize him, and his party dwindled into insignificance and finally
ceased to exist. Thus at last there was no opposition to the Pope chosen
by the Council, who was elected in 1417, and took the name Martin V.</p>
<p>These proceedings were creditable, but the treatment of Huss, the
Bohemian disciple of Wycliffe, was not. He was brought to Constance with
the promise of a safe conduct, but when he got there he was condemned
and suffered death at the stake. Wycliffe was safely dead, but the
Council ordered his bones to be dug up and burnt. The supporters of the
conciliar movement were anxious to free themselves from all suspicion of
unorthodoxy.</p>
<p>The Council of Constance had healed the schism, but it had hoped to
do much more, and to substitute a constitutional monarchy for the papal
absolutism. Martin V had made many promises before his election; some he
kept, some he broke. He had assented to the decree that a council should
be summoned every seven years, and to this decree he remained obedient.
The Council of Constance having been dissolved in 1417, a new Council,
which proved of no importance, was summoned in 1424; then, in 1431,
another was convoked to meet at Basel. Martin V died just at this
moment, and his successor Eugenius IV was, throughout his pontificate,
in bitter conflict with the reformers who controlled the Council. He
dissolved the Council, but it refused to consider itself dissolved; in
1433 he gave way for a time, but in 1437 he dissolved it again.
Nevertheless it remained in session till 1448, by which time it was
obvious to all that the Pope had won a complete triumph. In 1439 the
Council had alienated sympathy by declaring the Pope deposed and
electing an antipope (the last in history), who, however, resigned
almost immediately. In the same year Eugenius IV won prestige by holding
a Council of his own at Ferrara, where the Greek Church, in desperate
fear of the Turks, made a nominal submission to Rome. The papacy thus
emerged politically triumphant, but with very greatly diminished power
of inspiring moral reverence.</p>
<p>Wycliffe (ca. 1320–84) illustrates, by his life and doctrine, the
diminished authority of the papacy in the fourteenth century. Unlike the
earlier schoolmen, he was a secular priest, not a monk or friar. He had
a great reputation in Oxford, where he became a doctor of theology in
1372. For a short time he was Master of Balliol. He was the last of the
important Oxford scholastics. As a philosopher, he was not progressive;
he was a realist, and a Platonist rather than an Aristotelian. He held
that God’s decrees are not arbitrary, as some maintained; the actual
world is not one among possible worlds, but is the only possible world,
since God is bound to choose what is best. All this is not what makes
him interesting, nor does it seem to have been what most interested him,
for he retired from Oxford to the life of a country clergyman. During
the last ten years of his life he was the parish priest of Lutterworth,
by crown appointment. He continued, however, to lecture at Oxford.</p>
<p>Wycliffe is remarkable for the extreme slowness of his development.
In 1372, when his age was fifty or more, he was still orthodox; it was
only after this date, apparently, that he became heretical. He seems to
have been driven into heresy entirely by the strength of his moral
feelings—his sympathy with the poor, and his horror of rich worldly
ecclesiastics. At first his attack on the papacy was only political and
moral, not doctrinal; it was only gradually that he was driven into
wider revolt.</p>
<p>Wycliffe’s departure from orthodoxy began in 1376 with a course of
lectures at Oxford ‘On Civil Dominion’. He advanced the theory that
righteousness alone gives the title to dominion and property; that
unrighteous clergy have no such title; and that the decision as to
whether an ecclesiastic should retain his property or not ought to be
taken by the civil power. He taught, further, that property is the
result of sin; Christ and the Apostles had no property, and the clergy
ought to have none. These doctrines offended all clerics except the
friars. The English government, however, favoured them, for the Pope
drew a huge tribute from England, and the doctrine that money should not
be sent out of England to the Pope was a convenient one. This was
especially the case while the Pope was subservient to France, and
England was at war with France. John of Gaunt, who held power during the
minority of Richard II, befriended Wycliffe as long as possible. Gregory
XI, on the other hand, condemned eighteen theses in Wycliffe’s lectures,
saying that they were derived from Marsiglio of Padua. Wycliffe was
summoned to appear for trial before a tribunal of bishops, but the Queen
and the mob protected him, while the University of Oxford refused to
admit the Pope’s jurisdiction over its teachers. (Even in those days,
English universities believed in academic freedom.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wycliffe continued, during 1378 and 1379, to write learned
treatises, maintaining that the king is God’s vicar, and that bishops
are subject to him. When the great schism came, he went further than
before, branding the Pope as Antichrist, and saying that acceptance of
the Donation of Constantine had made all subsequent popes apostates. He
translated the Vulgate into English, and established ‘poor priests’, who
were secular. (By this action he at last annoyed the friars.) He
employed the ‘poor priests’ as itinerant preachers, whose mission was
especially to the poor. At last, in attacking sacerdotal power, he was
led to deny transubstantiation, which he called a deceit and a
blasphemous folly. At this point, John of Gaunt ordered him to be
silent.</p>
<p>The Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, led by Wat Tyler, made matters more
difficult for Wycliffe. There is no evidence that he actively encouraged
it, but, unlike Luther in similar circumstances, he refrained from
condemning it. John Ball, the Socialist unfrocked priest who was one of
the leaders, admired Wycliffe, which was embarrassing. But as he had
been excommunicated in 1366, when Wycliffe was still orthodox, he must
have arrived independently at his opinions. Wycliffe’s communistic
opinions, though no doubt the ‘poor priests’ disseminated them, were, by
him, only stated in Latin, so that at first hand they were inaccessible
to peasants.</p>
<p>It is surprising that Wycliffe did not suffer more than he did for
his opinions and his democratic activities. The University of Oxford
defended him against the bishops as long as possible. When the House of
Lords condemned his itinerant preachers, the House of Commons refused to
concur. No doubt trouble would have accumulated if he had lived longer,
but when he died in 1384 he had not yet been formally condemned. He was
buried at Lutterworth, where he died, and his bones were left in peace
until the Council of Constance had them dug up and burnt.</p>
<p>His followers in England, the Lollards, were severely persecuted and
practically stamped out. But owing to the fact that Richard II’s wife
was a Bohemian, his doctrines became known in Bohemia, where Huss was
his disciple; and in Bohemia, in spite of persecution, they survived
until the Reformation. In England, although driven underground, the
revolt against the papacy remained in men’s thoughts, and prepared the
soil for Protestantism.</p>
<p>During the fifteenth century, various other causes were added to the
decline of the papacy to produce a very rapid change, both political and
cultural. Gunpowder strengthened central governments at the expense of
the feudal nobility. In France and England, Louis XI and Edward IV
allied themselves with the rich middle class, who helped them to quell
aristocratic anarchy. Italy, until the last years of the century, was
fairly free from Northern armies, and advanced rapidly both in wealth
and culture. The new culture was essentially pagan, admiring Greece and
Rome, and despising the Middle Ages. Architecture and literary style
were adapted to ancient models. When Constantinople, the last survival
of antiquity, was captured by the Turks, Greek refugees in Italy were
welcomed by humanists. Vasco da Gama and Columbus enlarged the world,
and Copernicus enlarged the heavens. The Donation of Constantine was
rejected as a fable, and overwhelmed with scholarly derision. By the
help of the Byzantines, Plato came to be known, not only in Neoplatonic
and Augustinian versions, but at first hand. This sublunary sphere
appeared no longer as a vale of tears, a place of painful pilgrimage to
another world, but as affording opportunity for pagan delights, for fame
and beauty and adventure. The long centuries of asceticism were
forgotten in a riot of art and poetry and pleasure. Even in Italy, it is
true, the Middle Ages did not die without a struggle; Savonarola and
Leonardo were born in the same year. But in the main the old terrors had
ceased to be terrifying, and the new liberty of the spirit was found
intoxicating. The intoxication could not last, but for the moment it
shut out fear. In this moment of joyful liberation the modern world was
born.</p>
