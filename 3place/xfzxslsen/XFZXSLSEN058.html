<h4 id="spinoza">10 SPINOZA</h4>
<p>Spinoza (1632–77) is the noblest and most lovable of the great
philosophers. Intellectually, some others have surpassed him, but
ethically he is supreme. As a natural consequence, he was considered,
during his lifetime and for a century after his death, a man of
appalling wickedness. He was born a Jew, but the Jews excommunicated
him. Christians abhorred him equally; although his whole philosophy is
dominated by the idea of God, the orthodox accused him of atheism.
Leibniz, who owed much to him, concealed his debt, and carefully
abstained from saying a word in his praise; he even went so far as to
lie about the extent of his personal acquaintance with the heretic
Jew.</p>
<p>The life of Spinoza was very simple. His family had come to Holland
from Spain, or perhaps Portugal, to escape the Inquisition. He himself
was educated in Jewish learning, but found it impossible to remain
orthodox. He was offered 1000 florins a year to conceal his doubts; when
he refused, an attempt was made to assassinate him; when this failed, he
was cursed with all the curses in Deuteronomy and with the curse that
Elisha pronounced on the children who, in consequence, were torn to
pieces by the she-bears. But no she-bears attacked Spinoza. He lived
quietly, first at Amsterdam and then at the Hague, making his living by
polishing lenses. His wants were few and simple, and he showed
throughout his life a rare indifference to money. The few who knew him
loved him, even if they disapproved of his principles. The Dutch
Government, with its usual liberalism, tolerated his opinions on
theological matters, though at one time he was in bad odour politically
because he sided with the De Witts against the House of Orange. At the
early age of forty-three he died of phthisis.</p>
<p>His chief work, the Ethics, was published posthumously. Before
considering it, a few words must be said about two of his other books,
the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus and the Tractatus Politicus. The
former is a curious combination of biblical criticism and political
theory; the latter deals with political theory only. In biblical
criticism Spinoza partially anticipates modern views, particularly in
assigning much later dates to various books of the Old Testament than
those assigned by tradition. He endeavours throughout to show that the
Scriptures can be interpreted so as to be compatible with a liberal
theology.</p>
<p>Spinoza’s political theory is, in the main, derived from Hobbes, in
spite of the enormous temperamental difference between the two men. He
holds that in a state of nature there is no right or wrong, for wrong
consists in disobeying the law. He holds that the sovereign can do no
wrong, and agrees with Hobbes that the Church should be entirely
subordinate to the State. He is opposed to all rebellion, even against a
bad government, and instances the troubles in England as a proof of the
harm that comes of forcible resistance to authority. But he disagrees
with Hobbes in thinking democracy the ‘most natural’ form of government.
He disagrees also in holding that subjects should not sacrifice all
their rights to the sovereign. In particular, he holds freedom of
opinion important. I do not quite know how he reconciles this with the
opinion that religious questions should be decided by the State. I think
when he says this he means that they should be decided by the State
rather than the Church; in Holland the State was much more tolerant than
the Church.</p>
<p>Spinoza’s Ethics deals with three distinct matters. It begins with
metaphysics; it then goes on to the psychology of the passions and the
will; and finally it sets forth an ethic based on the preceding
metaphysics and psychology. The metaphysic is a modification of
Descartes, the psychology is reminiscent of Hobbes, but the ethic is
original, and is what is of most value in the book. The relation of
Spinoza to Descartes is in some ways not unlike the relation of Plotinus
to Plato. Descartes was a many-sided man, full of intellectual
curiosity, but not much burdened with moral earnestness. Although he
invented ‘proofs’ intended to support orthodox beliefs, he could have
been used by sceptics as Carneades used Plato. Spinoza, although he was
not without scientific interests, and even wrote a treatise on the
rainbow, was in the main concerned with religion and virtue. He accepted
from Descartes and his contemporaries a materialistic and deterministic
physics, and sought, within this framework, to find room for reverence
and a life devoted to the Good. His attempt was magnificent, and rouses
admiration even in those who do not think it successful.</p>
<p>The metaphysical system of Spinoza is of the type inaugurated by
Parmenides. There is only one substance, ‘God or Nature’; nothing finite
is self-subsistent. Descartes admitted three substances, God and mind
and matter; it is true that, even for him, God was, in a sense, more
substantial than mind and matter, since He had created them, and could,
if He chose, annihilate them. But except in relation to God’s
omnipotence, mind and matter were two independent substances, defined,
respectively, by the attributes of thought and extension. Spinoza would
have none of this. For him, thought and extension were both attributes
of God. God has also an infinite number of other attributes, since He
must be in every respect infinite; but these others are unknown to us.
Individual souls and separate pieces of matter are, for Spinoza,
adjectival; they are not things, but merely aspects of the divine Being.
There can be no such personal immortality as Christians believe in, but
only that impersonal sort that consists in becoming more and more one
with God. Finite things are defined by their boundaries, physical or
logical, that is to say, by what they are not: ‘all determination is
negation’. There can be only one Being who is wholly positive, and He
must be absolutely infinite. Hence Spinoza is led to a complete and
undiluted pantheism.</p>
<p>Everything, according to Spinoza, is ruled by an absolute logical
necessity. There is no such thing as free will in the mental sphere or
chance in the physical world. Everything that happens is a manifestation
of God’s inscrutable nature, and it is logically impossible that events
should be other than they are. This leads to difficulties in regard to
sin, which critics were not slow to point out. One of them, observing
that, according to Spinoza, everything is decreed by God and is
therefore good, asks indignantly: Was it good that Nero should kill his
mother? Was it good that Adam ate the apple? Spinoza answers that what
was positive in these acts was good, and only what was negative was bad;
but negation exists only from the point of view of finite creatures. In
God, who alone is completely real, there is no negation, and therefore
the evil in what to us seem sins does not exist when they are viewed as
parts of the whole. This doctrine, though, in one form or another, it
has been held by most mystics, cannot, obviously, be reconciled with the
orthodox doctrine of sin and damnation. It is bound up with Spinoza’s
complete rejection of free will. Although not at all polemical, Spinoza
was too honest to conceal his opinions, however shocking to
contemporaries; the abhorrence of his teaching is therefore not
surprising.</p>
<p>The Ethics is set forth in the style of Euclid, with definitions,
axioms, and theorems; everything after the axioms is supposed to be
rigorously demonstrated by deductive argument. This makes him difficult
reading. A modern student, who cannot suppose that there are rigorous
‘proofs’ of such things as he professes to establish, is bound to grow
impatient with the detail of the demonstrations, which is, in fact, not
worth mastering. It is enough to read the enunciations of the
propositions, and to study the scholia, which contain much of what is
best in the Ethics. But it would show a lack of understanding to blame
Spinoza for his geometrical method. It was of the essence of his system,
ethically as well as metaphysically, to maintain that everything could
be demonstrated, and it was therefore essential to produce
demonstrations. We cannot accept his method, but that is because we
cannot accept his metaphysic. We cannot believe that the
interconnections of the parts of the universe are logical, because we
hold that scientific laws are to be discovered by observation, not by
reasoning alone. But for Spinoza the geometrical method was necessary,
and was bound up with the most essential parts of his doctrine.</p>
<p>I come now to Spinoza’s theory of the emotions. This comes after a
metaphysical discussion of the nature and origin of the mind, which
leads up to the astonishing proposition that ‘the human mind has an
adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God’. But the
passions, which are discussed in the Third Book of the Ethics, distract
us and obscure our intellectual vision of the whole. ‘Everything,’ we
are told, ‘in so far as it is in itself, endeavours to persevere in its
own being.’ Hence arise love and hate and strife. The psychology of Book
III is entirely egoistic. ‘He who conceives that the object of his hate
is destroyed will feel pleasure.’ ‘If we conceive that anyone takes
delight in something, which only one person can possess, we shall
endeavour to bring it about, that the man in question shall not gain
possession thereof.’ But even in this Book there are moments when
Spinoza abandons the appearance of mathematically demonstrated cynicism,
as when he says: ‘Hatred is increased by being reciprocated, and can on
the other hand be destroyed by love.’ Self-preservation is the
fundamental motive of the passions, according to Spinoza; but
self-preservation alters its character when we realize that what is real
and positive in us is what unites us to the whole, and not what
preserves the appearance of separateness.</p>
<p>The last two books of the Ethics, entitled respectively ‘Of human
bondage, or the strength of the emotions’ and ‘Of the power of the
understanding, or of human freedom,’ are the most interesting. We are in
bondage in proportion as what happens to us is determined by outside
causes, and we are free in proportion as we are self-determined.
Spinoza, like Socrates and Plato, believes that all wrong action is due
to intellectual error: the man who adequately understands his own
circumstances will act wisely, and will even be happy in the face of
what to another would be misfortune. He makes no appeal to
unselfishness; he holds that self-seeking, in some sense, and more
particularly self-preservation, govern all human behaviour. ‘No virtue
can be conceived as prior to this endeavour to preserve one’s own
being.’ But his conception of what a wise man will choose as the goal of
his self-seeking is different from that of the ordinary egoist: ‘The
mind’s highest good is the knowledge of God, and the mind’s highest
virtue is to know God.’ Emotions are called ‘passions’ when they spring
from inadequate ideas; passions in different men may conflict, but men
who live in obedience to reason will agree together. Pleasure in itself
is good, but hope and fear are bad, and so are humility and repentance:
‘he who repents of an action is doubly wretched or infirm’. Spinoza
regards time as unreal, and therefore all emotions which have to do
essentially with an event as future or as past are contrary to reason.
‘In so far as the mind conceives a thing under the dictate of reason, it
is affected equally, whether the idea be of a thing present, past, or
future.’</p>
<p>This is hard saying, but it is of the essence of Spinoza’s system,
and we shall do well to dwell upon it for a moment. In popular
estimation, ‘all’s well that ends well’; if the universe is gradually
improving, we think better of it than if it is gradually deteriorating,
even if the sum of good and evil be the same in the two cases. We are
more concerned about a disaster in our own time than in the time of
Jenghiz Khan. According to Spinoza this is irrational. Whatever happens
is part of the eternal timeless world as God sees it; to Him, the date
is irrelevant. The wise man, so far as human finitude allows, endeavours
to see the world as God sees it, sub specie æternitatis, under the
aspect of eternity. But, you may retort, we are surely right in being
more concerned about future misfortunes, which may possibly be averted,
than about past calamities about which we can do nothing. To this
argument Spinoza’s determinism supplies the answer. Only ignorance makes
us think that we can alter the future; what will be will be, and the
future is as unalterably fixed as the past. That is why hope and fear
are condemned: both depend upon viewing the future as uncertain, and
therefore spring from lack of wisdom.</p>
<p>When we acquire, in so far as we can, a vision of the world which is
analogous to God’s, we see everything as part of the whole, and as
necessary to the goodness of the whole. Therefore ‘the knowledge of evil
is an inadequate knowledge’. God has no knowledge of evil, because there
is no evil to be known; the appearance of evil only arises through
regarding parts of the universe as if they were self-subsistent.</p>
<p>Spinoza’s outlook is intended to liberate men from the tyranny of
fear. ‘A free man thinks of nothing less than of death; and his wisdom
is a meditation not of death, but of life.’ Spinoza lived up to this
precept very completely. On the last day of his life he was entirely
calm, not exalted, like Socrates in the Phaedo, but conversing, as he
would on any other day, about matters of interest to his interlocutor.
Unlike some other philosophers, he not only believed his own doctrines,
but practised them; I do not know of any occasion, in spite of great
provocation, in which he was betrayed into the kind of heat or anger
that his ethic condemned. In controversy he was courteous and
reasonable, never denouncing, but doing his utmost to persuade.</p>
<p>In so far as what happens to us springs from ourselves, it is good;
only what comes from without is bad for us. ‘As all things whereof a man
is the efficient cause are necessarily good, no evil can befall a man
except through external causes.’ Obviously, therefore, nothing bad can
happen to the universe as a whole, since it is not subject to external
causes. ‘We are a part of universal nature, and we follow her order. If
we have a clear and distinct understanding of this, that part of our
nature which is defined by intelligence, in other words the better part
of ourselves, will assuredly acquiesce in what befalls us, and in such
acquiescence will endeavour to persist.’ In so far as a man is an
unwilling part of a larger whole, he is in bondage; but in so far as,
through the understanding, he has grasped the sole reality of the whole,
he is free. The implications of this doctrine are developed in the last
Book of the Ethics.</p>
<p>Spinoza does not, like the Stoics, object to all emotions; he objects
only to those that are ‘passions’, i.e. those in which we appear to
ourselves to be passive in the power of outside forces. ‘An emotion
which is a passion ceases to be a passion as soon as we form a clear and
distinct idea of it.’ Understanding that all things are necessary helps
the mind to acquire power over the emotions. ‘He who clearly and
distinctly understands himself and his emotions, loves God, and so much
the more as he more understands himself and his emotions.’ This
proposition introduces us to the ‘intellectual love of God’, in which
wisdom consists. The intellectual love of God is a union of thought and
emotion: it consists, I think one may say, in true thought combined with
joy in the apprehension of truth. All joy in true thought is part of the
intellectual love of God, for it contains nothing negative, and is
therefore truly part of the whole, not only apparently, as are
fragmentary things so separated in thought as to appear bad.</p>
<p>I said a moment ago that the intellectual love of God involves joy,
but perhaps this was a mistake, for Spinoza says that God is not
affected by any emotion of pleasure or pain, and also says that ‘the
intellectual love of the mind towards God is part of the infinite love
wherewith God loves himself’. I think, nevertheless, that there is
something in ‘intellectual love’ which is not mere intellect; perhaps
the joy involved is considered as something superior to pleasure.</p>
<p>‘Love towards God,’ we are told, ‘must hold the chief place in the
mind.’ I have omitted Spinoza’s demonstrations, but in so doing I have
given an incomplete picture of his thought. As the proof of the above
proposition is short, I will quote it in full; the reader can then in
imagination supply proofs to other propositions. The proof of the above
proposition is as follows:</p>
<p>‘For this love is associated with all the modifications of the body
(V, 14) and is fostered by them all (V, 15); therefore (V, 11) it must
hold the chief place in the mind, Q.E.D.’</p>
<p>Of the propositions referred to in the above proof, V, 14 states:
‘The mind can bring it about, that all bodily modifications or images of
things may be referred to the idea of God’; V, 15, quoted above, states:
‘He who clearly and distinctly understands himself and his emotions
loves God, and so much the more in proportion as he understands himself
and his emotions’; V, 11 states: ‘In proportion as a mental image is
referred to more objects, so is it more frequent, or more often vivid,
and occupies the mind more.’</p>
<p>The ‘proof’ quoted above might be expressed as follows: Every
increase in the understanding of what happens to us consists in
referring events to the idea of God, since, in truth, everything is part
of God. This understanding of everything as part of God is love of God.
When all objects are referred to God, the idea of God will fully occupy
the mind.</p>
<p>Thus the statement that ‘love of God must hold the chief place in the
mind’ is not a primarily moral exhortation, but an account of what must
inevitably happen as we acquire understanding.</p>
<p>We are told that no one can hate God, but, on the other hand, ‘he who
loves God cannot endeavour that God should love him in return’. Goethe,
who admired Spinoza without even beginning to understand him, thought
this proposition an instance of self-abnegation. It is nothing of the
sort, but a logical consequence of Spinoza’s metaphysic. He does not say
that a man ought not to want God to love him; he says that a man who
loves God cannot want God to love him. This is made plain by the proof,
which says: ‘For, if a man should so endeavour, he would desire (V, 17,
Corol.) that God, whom he loves, should not be God, and consequently he
would desire to feel pain (III, 19), which is absurd (III, 28).’ V, 17
is the proposition already referred to, which says that God has no
passions or pleasures or pains; the corollary referred to above deduces
that God loves and hates no one. Here again what is involved is not an
ethical precept, but a logical necessity: a man who loved God and wished
God to love him would be wishing to feel pain, ‘which is absurd’.</p>
<p>The statement that God can love no one should not be considered to
contradict the statement that God loves Himself with an infinite
intellectual love. He may love Himself, since that is possible without
false belief; and in any case intellectual love is a very special kind
of love.</p>
<p>At this point Spinoza tells us that he has now given us ‘all the
remedies against the emotions’. The great remedy is clear and distinct
ideas as to the nature of the emotions and their relation to external
causes. There is a further advantage in love of God as compared to love
of human beings: ‘Spiritual unhealthiness and misfortunes can generally
be traced to excessive love of something which is subject to many
variations.’ But clear and distinct knowledge ‘begets a love towards a
thing immutable and eternal’, and such love has not the turbulent and
disquieting character of love for an object which is transient and
changeable.</p>
<p>Although personal survival after death is an illusion, there is
nevertheless something in the human mind that is eternal. The mind can
only imagine or remember while the body endures, but there is in God an
idea which expresses the essence of this or that human body under the
form of eternity, and this idea is the eternal part of the mind. The
intellectual love of God, when experienced by an individual, is
contained in this eternal part of the mind.</p>
<p>Blessedness, which consists of love towards God, is not the reward of
virtue, but virtue itself; we do not rejoice in it because we control
our lusts, but we control our lusts because we rejoice in it.</p>
<p>The Ethics ends with these words:</p>
<p>‘The wise man, in so far as he is regarded as such, is scarcely at
all disturbed in spirit, but being conscious of himself, and of God, and
of things, by a certain eternal necessity, never ceases to be, but
always possesses true acquiescence of his spirit. If the way which I
have pointed out as leading to this result seems exceedingly hard, it
may nevertheless be discovered. Needs must it be hard, since it is so
seldom found. How would it be possible, if salvation were ready to our
hand, and could without great labour be found, that it should be by
almost all men neglected? But all excellent things are as difficult as
they are rare.’</p>
<p>In forming a critical estimate of Spinoza’s importance as a
philosopher, it is necessary to distinguish his ethics from his
metaphysics, and to consider how much of the former can survive the
rejection of the latter.</p>
<p>Spinoza’s metaphysic is the best example of what may be called
‘logical monism’—the doctrine, namely, that the world as a whole is a
single substance, none of whose parts are logically capable of existing
alone. The ultimate basis for this view is the belief that every
proposition has a single subject and a single predicate, which leads us
to the conclusion that relations and plurality must be illusory. Spinoza
thought that the nature of the world and of human life could be
logically deduced from self-evident axioms; we ought to be as resigned
to events as to the fact that 2 and 2 are 4, since they are equally the
outcome of logical necessity. The whole of this metaphysic is impossible
to accept; it is incompatible with modern logic and with scientific
method. Facts have to be discovered by observation, not by reasoning;
when we successfully infer the future, we do so by means of principles
which are not logically necessary, but are suggested by empirical data.
And the concept of substance, upon which Spinoza relies, is one which
neither science nor philosophy can nowadays accept.</p>
<p>But when we come to Spinoza’s ethics, we feel—or at least I feel—that
something, though not everything, can be accepted even when the
metaphysical foundation has been rejected. Broadly speaking, Spinoza is
concerned to show how it is possible to live nobly even when we
recognize the limits of human power. He himself, by his doctrine of
necessity, makes these limits narrower than they are; but when they
indubitably exist, Spinoza’s maxims are probably the best possible.
Take, for instance, death: nothing that a man can do will make him
immortal, and it is therefore futile to spend time in fears and
lamentations over the fact that we must die. To be obsessed by the fear
of death is a kind of slavery; Spinoza is right in saying that ‘the free
man thinks of nothing less than of death’. But even in this case, it is
only death in general that should be so treated; death of any particular
disease should, if possible, be averted by submitting to medical care.
What should, even in this case, be avoided, is a certain kind of anxiety
or terror; the necessary measures should be taken calmly, and our
thoughts should, as far as possible, be then directed to other matters.
The same considerations apply to all other purely personal
misfortunes.</p>
<p>But how about misfortunes to people whom you love? Let us think of
some of the things that are likely to happen in our time to inhabitants
of Europe or China. Suppose you are a Jew, and your family has been
massacred. Suppose you are an underground worker against the Nazis, and
your wife has been shot because you could not be caught. Suppose your
husband, for some purely imaginary crime, has been sent to forced labour
in the Arctic, and has died of cruelty and starvation. Suppose your
daughter has been raped and then killed by enemy soldiers. Ought you, in
these circumstances, to preserve a philosophic calm?</p>
<p>If you follow Christ’s teaching, you will say ‘Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.’ I have known Quakers who could have
said this sincerely and profoundly, and whom I admired because they
could. But before giving admiration one must be very sure that the
misfortune is felt as deeply as it should be. One cannot accept the
attitude of some among the Stoics, who said, ‘What does it matter to me
if my family suffer? I can still be virtuous.’ The Christian principle,
‘Love your enemies,’ is good, but the Stoic principle, ‘Be indifferent
to your friends,’ is bad. And the Christian principle does not inculcate
calm, but an ardent love even towards the worst of men. There is nothing
to be said against it except that it is too difficult for most of us to
practise sincerely.</p>
<p>The primitive reaction to such disasters is revenge. When Macduff
learns that his wife and children have been killed by Macbeth, he
resolves to kill the tyrant himself. This reaction is still admired by
most people, when the injury is great, and such as to arouse moral
horror in disinterested people. Nor can it be wholly condemned, for it
is one of the forces generating punishment, and punishment is sometimes
necessary. Moreover, from the point of view of mental health, the
impulse to revenge is likely to be so strong that, if it is allowed no
outlet, a man’s whole outlook on life may become distorted and more or
less insane. This is not true universally, but it is true in a large
percentage of cases. But on the other side it must be said that revenge
is a very dangerous motive. In so far as society admits it, it allows a
man to be the judge in his own case, which is exactly what the law tries
to prevent. Moreover it is usually an excessive motive; it seeks to
inflict more punishment than is desirable. Torture, for example, should
not be punished by torture, but the man maddened by lust for vengeance
will think a painless death too good for the object of his hate.
Moreover—and it is here that Spinoza is in the right—a life dominated by
a single passion is a narrow life, incompatible with every kind of
wisdom. Revenge as such is therefore not the best reaction to
injury.</p>
<p>Spinoza would say what the Christian says, and also something more.
For him, all sin is due to ignorance; he would ‘forgive them, for they
know not what they do’. But he would have you avoid the limited purview
from which, in his opinion, sin springs, and would urge you, even under
the greatest misfortunes, to avoid being shut up in the world of your
sorrow; he would have you understand it by seeing it in relation to its
causes and as a part of the whole order of nature. As we saw, he
believes that hatred can be overcome by love: ‘Hatred is increased by
being reciprocated, and can on the other hand be destroyed by love.
Hatred which is completely vanquished by love, passes into love; and
love is thereupon greater, than if hatred had not preceded it.’ I wish I
could believe this, but I cannot, except in exceptional cases where the
person hating is completely in the power of the person who refuses to
hate in return. In such cases, surprise at being not punished may have a
reforming effect. But so long as the wicked have power, it is not much
use assuring them that you do not hate them, since they will attribute
your words to the wrong motive. And you cannot deprive them of power by
non-resistance.</p>
<p>The problem for Spinoza is easier than it is for one who has no
belief in the ultimate goodness of the universe. Spinoza thinks that, if
you see your misfortunes as they are in reality, as part of the
concatenation of causes stretching from the beginning of time to the
end, you will see that they are only misfortunes to you, not to the
universe, to which they are merely passing discords heightening an
ultimate harmony. I cannot accept this; I think that particular events
are what they are, and do not become different by absorption into a
whole. Each act of cruelty is eternally a part of the universe; nothing
that happens later can make that act good rather than bad, or can confer
perfection on the whole of which it is a part.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when it is your lot to have to endure something that is
(or seems to you) worse than the ordinary lot of mankind, Spinoza’s
principle of thinking about the whole, or at any rate about larger
matters than your own grief, is a useful one. There are even times when
it is comforting to reflect that human life, with all that it contains
of evil and suffering, is an infinitesimal part of the life of the
universe. Such reflections may not suffice to constitute a religion, but
in a painful world they are a help towards sanity and an antidote to the
paralysis of utter despair.</p>
