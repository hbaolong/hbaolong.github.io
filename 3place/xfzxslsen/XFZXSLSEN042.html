<h4 id="ecclesiastical-reform-in-the-eleventh-century">9 ECCLESIASTICAL
REFORM IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY</h4>
<p>For the first time since the fall of the Western Empire, Europe,
during the eleventh century, made rapid progress not subsequently lost.
There had been progress of a sort during the Carolingian renaissance,
but it proved to be not solid. In the eleventh century, the improvement
was lasting and many-sided. It began with monastic reform; it then
extended to the papacy and Church government; towards the end of the
century it produced the first scholastic philosophers. The Saracens were
expelled from Sicily by the Normans; the Hungarians, having become
Christians, ceased to be marauders; the conquests of the Normans in
France and England saved those countries from further Scandinavian
incursions. Architecture, which had been barbaric except where Byzantine
influence prevailed, attained sudden sublimity. The level of education
rose enormously among the clergy, and considerably in the lay
aristocracy.</p>
<p>The reform movement, in its earlier stages, was, in the minds of its
promoters, actuated exclusively by moral motives. The clergy, both
regular and secular, had fallen into bad ways, and earnest men set to
work to make them live more in accordance with their principles. But
behind this purely moral motive there was another, at first perhaps
unconscious, but gradually becoming more and more open. This motive was
to complete the separation between clergy and laity, and, in so doing,
to increase the power of the former. It was therefore natural that the
victory of reform in the Church should lead straight on to a violent
conflict between Emperor and Pope.</p>
<p>Priests had formed a separate and powerful caste in Egypt, Babylonia,
and Persia, but not in Greece or Rome. In the primitive Christian
Church, the distinction between clergy and laity arose gradually; when
we read of ‘bishops’ in the New Testament, the word does not mean what
it has come to mean to us. The separation of the clergy from the rest of
the population had two aspects, one doctrinal, the other political; the
political aspect depended upon the doctrinal. The clergy possessed
certain miraculous powers, especially in connection with the
sacraments—except baptism, which could be performed by laymen. Without
the help of the clergy, marriage, absolution, and extreme unction were
impossible. Even more important, in the Middle Ages, was
transubstantiation: only a priest could perform the miracle of the mass.
It was not until the eleventh century, in 1079, that the doctrine of
transubstantiation became an article of faith, though it had been
generally believed for a long time.</p>
<p>Owing to their miraculous powers, priests could determine whether a
man should spend eternity in heaven or in hell. If he died while
excommunicate, he went to hell; if he died after a priest had performed
all the proper ceremonies, he would ultimately go to heaven provided he
had duly repented and confessed. Before going to heaven, however, he
would have to spend some time—perhaps a very long time—suffering the
pains of purgatory. Priests could shorten this time by saying masses for
his soul, which they were willing to do for a suitable money
payment.</p>
<p>All this, it must be understood, was genuinely and firmly believed
both by priests and by laity; it was not merely a creed officially
professed. Over and over again, the miraculous powers of the clergy gave
them the victory over powerful princes at the head of their armies. This
power, however, was limited on two ways: by reckless outbreaks of
passion on the part of furious laymen, and by divisions among the
clergy. The inhabitants of Rome, until the time of Gregory VII, showed
little respect for the person of the Pope. They would kidnap him,
imprison him, poison him, or fight against him, whenever their turbulent
factional strife tempted them to such action. How is this compatible
with their beliefs? Partly, no doubt, the explanation lies in mere lack
of self-control; partly, however, in the thought that one could repent
on one’s deathbed. Another reason, which operated less in Rome than
elsewhere, was that kings could bend to their will the bishops in their
kingdoms, and thus secure enough priestly magic to save themselves from
damnation. Church discipline and a unified ecclesiastical government
were therefore essential to the power of the clergy. These ends were
secured during the eleventh century, as part and parcel of a moral
reformation of the clergy.</p>
<p>The power of the clergy as a whole could only be secured by very
considerable sacrifices on the part of individual ecclesiastics. The two
great evils against which all clerical reformers directed their energies
were simony and concubinage. Something must be said about each of
these.</p>
<p>Owing to the benefactions of the pious, the Church had become rich.
Many bishops had huge estates, and even parish priests had, as a rule,
what for those times was a comfortable living. The appointment of
bishops was usually, in practice, in the hands of the king, but
sometimes in those of some subordinate feudal noble. It was customary
for the king to sell bishoprics; this, in fact, provided a substantial
part of his income. The bishop, in turn, sold such ecclesiastical
preferment as was in his power. There was no secret about this. Gerbert
(Sylvester II) represented bishops as saying: ’I gave gold and I
received the episcopate; but yet I do not fear to receive it back if I
behave as I should. I ordain a priest and I receive gold; I make a
deacon and I receive a heap of silver. Behold the gold which I gave I
have once more unlessened in my purse.’1 Peter Damian in Milan, in 1059,
found that every cleric in the city, from the archbishop downwards, had
been guilty of simony. And this state of affairs was in no way
exceptional.</p>
<p>Simony, of course, was a sin, but that was not the only objection to
it. It caused ecclesiastical preferment to go by wealth, not merit; it
confirmed lay authority in the appointment of bishops, and episcopal
subservience to secular rulers; and it tended to make the episcopate
part of the feudal system. Moreover, when a man had purchased
preferment, he was naturally anxious to recoup himself, so that worldly
rather than spiritual concerns were likely to preoccupy him. For these
reasons, the campaign against simony was a necessary part of the
ecclesiastical struggle for power.</p>
<p>Very similar considerations applied to clerical celibacy. The
reformers of the eleventh century often spoke of ‘concubinage’ when it
would have been more accurate to speak of ‘marriage’. Monks, of course,
were precluded from marriage by their vow of chastity, but there had
been no clear prohibition of marriage for the secular clergy. In the
Eastern Church, to this day, parish priests are allowed to be married.
In the West, in the eleventh century, most parish priests were married.
Bishops, for their part, appealed to St Paul’s pronouncement: ’A bishop
then must be blameless, the husband of one wife.’2 There was not the
same clear moral issue as in the matter of simony, but in the insistence
on clerical celibacy there were political motives very similar to those
in the campaign against simony.3</p>
<p>When priests were married, they naturally tried to pass on Church
property to their sons. They could do this legally if their sons became
priests; therefore one of the first steps of the reform party, when it
acquired power, was to forbid the ordination of priests’ sons.4 But in
the confusion of the times there was still danger that, if priests had
sons, they would find means of</p>
<p>illegally alienating parts of the Church lands. In addition to this
economic consideration, there was also the fact that, if a priest was a
family man like his neighbours, he seemed to them less removed from
themselves. There was, from at least the fifth century onwards, an
intense admiration for celibacy, and if the clergy were to command the
reverence on which their powers depended, it was highly advantageous
that they should be obviously separated from other men by abstinence
from marriage. The reformers themselves, no doubt, sincerely believed
that the married state, though not actually sinful, is lower than the
state of celibacy, and is only conceded to the weakness of the flesh. St
Paul says ‘If they cannot contain, let them marry’5; but a really holy
man ought to be able to ’contain’. Therefore clerical celibacy is
essential to the moral authority of the Church.</p>
<p>After these general preliminaries, let us come to the actual history
of the reform movement in the eleventh-century Church.</p>
<p>The beginning goes back to the foundation of the abbey of Cluny in
910 by William the Pious, Duke of Aquitaine. This abbey was, from the
first, independent of all external authority except that of the Pope;
moreover, its abbot was given authority over other monasteries that owed
their origin to it. Most monasteries, at this time, were rich and lax;
Cluny, though avoiding extreme asceticism, was careful to preserve
decency and decorum. The second abbot, Odo, went to Italy, and was given
control of several Roman monasteries. He was not always successful:
’Farfa, divided by a schism between two rival abbots who had murdered
their predecessor, resisted the introduction of Cluniac monks by Odo and
got rid by poison of the abbot whom Alberic installed by armed force.’6
(Alberic was the ruler of Rome who had invited Odo.) In the twelfth
century Cluny’s reforming zeal grew cold. St Bernard objected to its
fine architecture; like all the most earnest men of his time, he
considered splendid ecclesiastical edifices a sign of sinful pride.</p>
<p>During the eleventh century, various other orders were founded by
reformers. Romuald, an ascetic hermit, founded the Camaldolese Order in
1012; Peter Damian, of whom we shall speak shortly, was a follower of
his. The Carthusians, who never ceased to be austere, were founded by
Bruno of Cologne in 1084. In 1098 the Cistercian Order was founded, and
in 1113 it was joined by St Bernard. It adhered strictly to the
Benedictine Rule. It forbade stained-glass windows. For labour, it
employed conversi, or lay brethren. These men took the vows, but were
forbidden to learn reading and writing; they were employed mainly in
agriculture, but also in other work, such as architecture. Fountains
Abbey, in Yorkshire, is Cistercian—a remarkable work for men who thought
all beauty of the Devil.</p>
<p>As will be seen from the case of Farfa, which was by no means unique,
monastic reformers required great courage and energy. Where they
succeeded, they were supported by the secular authorities. It was these
men and their followers who made possible the reformation, first of the
papacy and then of the Church as a whole.</p>
<p>The reform of the papacy, however, was, at first, mainly the work of
the Emperor. The last dynastic Pope was Benedict IX, elected in 1032,
and said to have been only twelve years old at the time. He was the son
of Alberic of Tusculum, whom we have already met in connection with
Abbot Odo. As he grew older, he grew more and more debauched, and
shocked even the Romans. At last his wickedness reached such a pitch
that he decided to resign the papacy in order to marry. He sold it to
his godfather, who became Gregory VI. This man, though he acquired the
papacy simoniacally, was a reformer; he was a friend of Hildebrand
(Gregory VII). The manner of his acquiring the papacy, however, was too
scandalous to be passed over. The young Emperor Henry III (1039–56) was
a pious reformer, who had abandoned simony at great cost to his revenue,
while retaining the right to appoint bishops. He came to Italy in 1046,
at the age of twenty-two, and deposed Gregory VI on the charge of
simony.</p>
<p>Henry III retained throughout his reign the power of making and
unmaking popes, which, however, he exercised wisely in the interests of
reform. After getting rid of Gregory VI, he appointed a German bishop,
Suidger of Bamberg; the Romans resigned the election rights which they
had claimed and often exercised, almost always badly. The new Pope died
next year, and the Emperor’s next nominee also died almost
immediately—of poison, it was said. Henry III then chose a relation of
his own, Bruno of Toul, who became Leo IX (1049–54). He was an earnest
reformer, who travelled much and held many councils; he wished to fight
the Normans in Southern Italy, but in this he was unsuccessful.
Hildebrand was his friend, and might almost be called his pupil. At his
death the Emperor appointed one more Pope, Gebhard of Eichstadt, who
became Victor II, in 1055. But the Emperor died the next year, and the
Pope the year after. From this point onwards, the relations of Emperor
and Pope became less friendly. The Pope, having acquired moral authority
by the help of Henry III, claimed first independence of the Emperor, and
then superiority to him. Thus began the great conflict which lasted two
hundred years and ended in the defeat of the Emperor. In the long run,
therefore, Henry III’s policy of reforming the papacy was perhaps
short-sighted.</p>
<p>The next Emperor, Henry IV, reigned for fifty years (1056–1106). At
first he was a minor, and the regency was exercised by his mother the
Empress Agnes. Stephen IX was Pope for one year, and at his death the
cardinals chose one Pope while the Romans, reasserting the rights they
had surrendered, chose another. The Empress sided with the cardinals,
whose nominee took the name of Nicholas II. Although his reign only
lasted three years, it was important. He made peace with the Normans,
thereby making the papacy less dependent on the Emperor. In his time the
manner in which popes were to be elected was determined by a decree,
according to which the choice was to be made first by the cardinal
bishops, then by the other cardinals, and last by the clergy and people
of Rome, whose participation, one gathers, was to be purely formal. In
effect, the cardinal bishops were to select the Pope. The election was
to take place in Rome if possible, but might take place elsewhere if
circumstances made election in Rome difficult or undesirable. No part in
the election was allotted to the Emperor. This decree, which was
accepted only after a struggle, was an essential step in the
emancipation of the papacy from lay control.</p>
<p>Nicholas II secured a decree that, for the future, ordinations by men
guilty of simony were not to be valid. The decree was not made
retroactive, because to do so would have invalidated the great majority
of ordinations of existing priests.</p>
<p>During the pontificate of Nicholas II an interesting struggle began
in Milan. The Archbishop, following the Ambrosian tradition, claimed a
certain independence of the Pope. He and his clergy were in alliance
with the aristocracy, and were strongly opposed to reform. The
mercantile and lower classes, on the other hand, wished the clergy to be
pious; there were riots in support of clerical celibacy, and a powerful
reform movement, called ‘Patarine’, against the archbishop and his
supporters. In 1059 the Pope, in support of reform, sent to Milan as his
legate the eminent St Peter Damian. Damian was the author of a treatise
On Divine Omnipotence, which maintained that God can do things contrary
to the law of contradiction, and can undo the past. (This view was
rejected by St Thomas, and has, since his time, been unorthodox.) He
opposed dialectic, and spoke of philosophy as the handmaid of theology.
He was, as we have seen, a follower of the hermit Romuald, and engaged
with great reluctance in the conduct of affairs. His holiness, however,
was such an asset to the papacy that very strong persuasion was brought
to bear on him to help in the reform campaign, and he yielded to the
Pope’s representations. At Milan in 1059 he made a speech against simony
to the assembled clerics. At first they were so enraged that his life
was in danger, but at last his eloquence won them over, and with tears
they one and all confessed themselves guilty. Moreover, they promised
obedience to Rome. Under the next Pope, there was a dispute with the
Emperor about the see of Milan, in which, with the help of the
Patarines, the Pope was ultimately victorious.</p>
<p>At the death of Nicholas II in 1061, Henry IV being now of age, there
was a dispute between him and the cardinals as to the succession to the
papacy. The Emperor had not accepted the election decree, and was not
prepared to forgo his rights in the election of the Pope. The dispute
lasted for three years, but in the end the cardinals’ choice prevailed,
without a definite trial of strength between Emperor and curia. What
turned the scale was the obvious merit of the cardinals’ Pope, who was a
man combining virtue with experience, and a former pupil of Lanfranc
(afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury). The death of this Pope, Alexander
II, in 1073, was followed by the election of Hildebrand (Gregory
VII).</p>
<p>Gregory VII (1073–85) is one of the most eminent of the Popes. He had
long been prominent, and had great influence on papal policy. It was
owing to him that Pope Alexander II blessed William the Conqueror’s
English enterprise; he favoured the Normans both in Italy and in the
North. He had been a protégé of Gregory VI, who bought the papacy in
order to combat simony; after the deposition of this Pope, Hildebrand
passed two years in exile. Most of the rest of his life was spent in
Rome. He was not a learned man, but was inspired largely by St
Augustine, whose doctrines he learnt at second-hand from his hero
Gregory the Great. After he became Pope, he believed himself the
mouthpiece of St Peter. This gave him a degree of self-confidence which,
on a mundane calculation, was not justified. He admitted that the
Emperor’s authority was also of divine origin: at first, he compared
Pope and Emperor to two eyes; later, when quarrelling with the Emperor,
to the sun and moon—the Pope, of course being the sun. The Pope must be
supreme in morals, and must therefore have the right to depose the
Emperor if the Emperor was immoral. And nothing could be more immoral
than resisting the Pope. All this he genuinely and profoundly
believed.</p>
<p>Gregory VII did more than any previous Pope to enforce clerical
celibacy. In Germany the clergy objected, and on this ground as well as
others were inclined to side with the Emperor. The laity, however,
everywhere preferred their priests celibate. Gregory stirred up riots of
the laity against married priests and their wives, in which both often
suffered brutal ill-treatment. He called on the laity not to attend mass
when celebrated by a recalcitrant priest. He decreed that the sacraments
of married clergy were invalid, and that such clergy must not enter
churches. All this roused clerical opposition and lay support; even in
Rome, where Popes had usually gone in danger of their lives, he was
popular with the people.</p>
<p>In Gregory’s time began the great dispute concerning ‘investitures’.
When a bishop was consecrated, he was invested with a ring and staff as
symbols of his office. These had been given by Emperor or king
(according to the locality), as the bishop’s feudal overlord. Gregory
insisted that they should be given by the Pope. The dispute was part of
the work of detaching the ecclesiastical from the feudal hierarchy. It
lasted a long time, but in the end the papacy was completely
victorious.</p>
<p>The quarrel which led to Canossa began over the archbishopric of
Milan. In 1075 the Emperor, with the concurrence of the suffragans,
appointed an archbishop; the Pope considered this an infringement of his
prerogative, and threatened the Emperor with excommunication and
deposition. The Emperor retaliated by summoning a council of bishops at
Worms, where the bishops renounced their allegiance to the Pope. They
wrote him a letter accusing him of adultery and perjury, and (worse than
either) ill-treatment of bishops. The Emperor also wrote him a letter,
claiming to be above all earthly judgment. The Emperor and his bishops
pronounced Gregory deposed; Gregory excommunicated the Emperor and his
bishops, and pronounced them deposed. Thus the stage was set.</p>
<p>In the first act, victory went to the Pope. The Saxons, who had
before rebelled against Henry IV and then made peace with him, rebelled
again; the German bishops made their peace with Gregory. The world at
large was shocked by the Emperor’s treatment of the Pope. Accordingly in
the following year (1077) Henry decided to seek absolution from the
Pope. In the depth of winter, with his wife and infant son and a few
attendants, he crossed the Mont Cenis pass, and presented himself as a
suppliant before the castle of Canossa, where the Pope was. For three
days the Pope kept him waiting, barefoot and in penitential garb. At
last he was admitted. Having expressed penitence and sworn, in future,
to follow the Pope’s directions in dealing with his German opponents, he
was pardoned and received back into communion.</p>
<p>The Pope’s victory, however, was illusory. He had been caught out by
the rules of his own theology, one of which enjoined absolution for
penitents. Strange to say, he was taken in by Henry, and supposed his
repentance sincere. He soon discovered his mistake. He could no longer
support Henry’s German enemies, who felt that he had betrayed them. From
this moment, things began to go against him.</p>
<p>Henry’s German enemies elected a rival Emperor, named Rudolf. The
Pope, at first, while maintaining that it was for him to decide between
Henry and Rudolf, refused to come to a decision. At last, in 1080,
having experienced the insincerity of Henry’s repentance, he pronounced
for Rudolf. By this time, however, Henry had got the better of most of
his opponents in Germany. He had an antipope elected by his clerical
supporters, and with him, in 1084, he entered Rome. His antipope duly
crowned him, but both had to retreat quickly before the Normans, who
advanced to the relief of Gregory. The Normans brutally sacked Rome, and
took Gregory away with them. He remained virtually their prisoner until
his death the next year.</p>
<p>Thus his policies appeared to have ended in disaster. But in fact
they were pursued with more moderation, by his successors. A compromise
favourable to the papacy was patched up for the moment, but the conflict
was essentially irreconcilable. Its later stages will be dealt with in
subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>It remains to say something of the intellectual revival in the
eleventh century. The tenth century was destitute of philosophers,
except for Gerbert (Pope Sylvester II, 999–1003), and even he was more a
mathematician than a philosopher. But as the eleventh century advanced,
men of real philosophical eminence began to appear. Of these, the most
important were Anselm and Roscelin, but some others deserve mention. All
were monks connected with the reform movement.</p>
<p>Peter Damian, the oldest of them, has already been mentioned.
Berengar of Tours (d. 1088) is interesting as being something of a
rationalist. He maintained that reason is superior to authority, in
support of which view he appealed to John the Scot, who was therefore
posthumously condemned. Berengar denied transubstantiation, and was
twice compelled to recant. His heresies were combated by Lanfranc in his
book De corpore et sanguine Domini. Lanfranc was born at Pavia, studied
law at Bologna, and became a first-rate dialectician. But he abandoned
dialectic for theology, and entered the monastery of Bec, in Normandy,
where he conducted a school. William the Conqueror made him Archbishop
of Canterbury in 1070.</p>
<p>St Anselm was, like Lanfranc, an Italian, a monk at Bec, and
Archbishop of Canterbury (1093–1109), in which capacity he followed the
principles of Gregory VII and quarrelled with the king. He is chiefly
known to fame as the inventor of the ‘ontological argument’ for the
existence of God. As he put it, the argument is as follows: We define
‘God’ as the greatest possible object of thought. Now if an object of
thought does not exist, another, exactly like it, which does exist, is
greater. Therefore the greatest of all objects of thought must exist,
since, otherwise, another, still greater, would be possible. Therefore
God exists.</p>
<p>This argument has never been accepted, by theologians. It was
adversely criticized at the time; then it was forgotten till the latter
half of the thirteenth century. Thomas Aquinas rejected it, and among
theologians his authority has prevailed ever since. But among
philosophers it has had a better fate. Descartes revived it in a
somewhat amended form; Leibniz thought that it could be made valid by
the addition of a supplement to prove that God is possible. Kant
considered that he had demolished it once for all. Nevertheless, in some
sense, it underlies the system of Hegel and his followers, and reappears
in Bradley’s principle: ‘What may be and must be, is.’</p>
<p>Clearly an argument with such a distinguished history is to be
treated with respect, whether valid or not. The real question is: Is
there anything we can think of which, by the mere fact that we can think
of it, is shown to exist outside our thought? Every philosopher would
like to say yes, because a philosopher’s job is to find out things about
the world by thinking rather than observing. If yes is the right answer,
there is a bridge from pure thought to things, if not, not. In this
generalized form, Plato uses a kind of ontological argument to prove the
objective reality of ideas. But no one before Anselm had stated the
argument in its naked logical purity. In gaining purity, it loses
plausibility; but this also is to Anselm’s credit.</p>
<p>For the rest, Anselm’s philosophy is mainly derived from St
Augustine, from whom it acquires many Platonic elements. He believes in
Platonic ideas, from which he derives another proof of the existence of
God. By Neoplatonic arguments he professes to prove not only God, but
the Trinity. (It will be remembered that Plotinus has a Trinity, though
not one that a Christian can accept as orthodox.) Anselm considers
reason subordinate to faith. ‘I believe in order to understand,’ he
says; following Augustine, he holds that without belief it is impossible
to understand. God, he says, is not just, but justice. It will be
remembered that John the Scot says similar things. The common origin is
in Plato.</p>
<p>St Anselm, like his predecessors in Christian philosophy, is in the
Platonic rather than the Aristotelian tradition. For this reason, he has
not the distinctive characteristics of the philosophy which is called
‘scholastic’, which culminated in Thomas Aquinas. This kind of
philosophy may be reckoned as beginning with Roscelin, who was Anselm’s
contemporary, being seventeen years younger than Anselm. Roscelin marks
a new beginning, and will be considered in a later chapter.</p>
<p>When it is said that medieval philosophy, until the thirteenth
century, was mainly Platonic, it must be remembered that Plato, except
for a fragment of the Timaeus, was known only at second or third hand.
John the Scot, for example, could not have held the views which he did
hold but for Plato, but most of what is Platonic in him comes from the
pseudo-Dionysius. The date of this author is uncertain, but it seems
probable that he was a disciple of Proclus the Neoplatonist. It is
probable, also, that John the Scot had never heard of Proclus or read a
line of Plotinus. Apart from the pseudo-Dionysius, the other source of
Platonism in the Middle Ages was Boethius. This Platonism was in many
ways different from that which a modern student derives from Plato’s own
writings. It omitted almost everything that had no obvious bearing on
religion, and in religious philosophy it enlarged and emphasized certain
aspects at the expense of others. This change in the conception of Plato
had already been effected by Plotinus. The knowledge of Aristotle was
also fragmentary, but in an opposite direction: all that was known of
him until the twelfth century was Boethius’s translation of the
Categories and De Emendatione. Thus Aristotle was conceived as a mere
dialectician, and Plato as only a religious philosopher and the author
of the theory of ideas. During the course of the later Middle Ages, both
these partial conceptions were gradually emended, especially the
conception of Aristotle. But the process, as regards Plato, was not
completed until the Renaissance.</p>
