<h4 id="empedocles">6 EMPEDOCLES</h4>
<p>The mixture of philosopher, prophet, man of science, and charlatan
which we found already in Pythagoras, was exemplified very completely in
Empedocles, who flourished about 440 B.C., and was thus a younger
contemporary of Parmenides, though his doctrine had in some ways more
affinity with that of Heraclitus. He was a citizen of Acragas, on the
south coast of Sicily; he was a democratic politician, who at the same
time claimed to be a god. In most Greek cities, and especially in those
of Sicily, there was a constant conflict between democracy and tyranny;
the leaders of whichever party was at the moment defeated were executed
or exiled. Those who were exiled seldom scrupled to enter into
negotiations with the enemies of Greece—Persia in the East, Carthage in
the West. Empedodes, in due course, was banished, but he appears, after
his banishment, to have preferred the career of a sage to that of an
intriguing refugee. It seems probable that in youth he was more or less
Orphic; that before his exile he combined politics and science; and that
it was only in later life, as an exile, that he became a prophet.</p>
<p>Legend had much to say about Empedocles. He was supposed to have
worked miracles, or what seemed such, sometimes by magic, sometimes by
means of his scientific knowledge. He could control the winds, we are
told; he restored to life a woman who had seemed dead for thirty days;
finally, it is said, he died by leaping into the crater of Etna to prove
that he was a god. In the words of the poet:</p>
<p>Great Empedocles, that ardent soul,</p>
<p>Leapt into Etna, and was roasted whole.</p>
<p>Matthew Arnold wrote a poem on this subject, but, although one of his
worst, it does not contain the above couplet.</p>
<p>Like Parmenides, Empedocles wrote in verse. Lucretius, who was
influenced by him, praised him highly as a poet, but on this subject
opinions were divided. Since only fragments of his writings have
survived, his poetic merit must remain in doubt.</p>
<p>It is necessary to deal separately with his science and his religion,
as they are not consistent with each other. I shall consider first his
science, then his philosophy, and finally his religion.</p>
<p>His most important contribution to science was his discovery of air
as a separate substance This he proved by the observation that when a
bucket or any similar vessel is put upside down into water, the water
does not enter into the bucket. He says:</p>
<p>‘When a girl, playing with a water-clock of shining brass, puts the
orifice of the pipe upon her comely hand, and dips the water-clock into
the yielding mass of silvery water, the stream does not then flow into
the vessel, but the bulk of the air inside, pressing upon the
close-packed perforations, keeps it out till she uncovers the compressed
stream; but then air escapes and an equal volume of water runs in.’</p>
<p>This passage occurs in an explanation of respiration.</p>
<p>He also discovered at least one example of centrifugal force: that if
a cup of water is whirled round at the end of a string, the water does
not come out.</p>
<p>He knew that there is sex in plants, and he had a theory (somewhat
fantastic, it must be admitted) of evolution and the survival of the
fittest. Originally, ‘countless tribes of mortal creatures were
scattered abroad endowed with all manner of forms, a wonder to behold.’
There were heads without necks, arms without shoulders, eyes without
foreheads, solitary limbs seeking for union. These things joined
together as each might chance; there were shambling creatures with
countless hands, creatures with faces and breasts looking in different
directions, creatures with the bodies of oxen and the faces of men, and
others with the faces of oxen and the bodies of men. There were
hermaphrodites combining the natures of men and women, but sterile. In
the end, only certain forms survived.</p>
<p>As regards astronomy: he knew that the moon shines by reflected
light, and thought that this is also true of the sun; he said that light
takes time to travel, but so little time that we cannot observe it; he
knew that solar eclipses are caused by the interposition of the moon, a
fact which he seems to have learnt from Anaxagoras.</p>
<p>He was the founder of the Italian school of medicine, and the medical
school which sprang from him influenced both Plato and Aristotle.
According to Burnet (p. 234), it affected the whole tendency of
scientific and philosophical thinking.</p>
<p>All this shows the scientific vigour of his time, which was not
equalled in the later ages of Greece.</p>
<p>I come now to his cosmology. It was he, as already mentioned, who
established earth, air, fire, and water as the four elements (though the
word ‘element’ was not used by him). Each of these was everlasting, but
they could be mixed in different proportions and thus produce the
changing complex substances that we find in the world. They were
combined by Love and separated by Strife. Love and Strife were, for
Empedocles, primitive substances on a level with earth, air, fire, and
water. There were periods when Love was in the ascendant, and others
when Strife was the stronger. There had been a golden age when Love was
completely victorious. In that age, men worshipped only the Cyprian
Aphrodite (fr. 128). The changes in the world are not governed by any
purpose, but only by Chance and Necessity. There is a cycle: when the
elements have been thoroughly mixed by Love, Strife gradually sorts them
out again; when Strife has separated them, Love gradually reunites them.
Thus every compound substance is temporary; only the elements, together
with Love and Strife, are everlasting.</p>
<p>There is a similarity to Heraclitus, but a softening since it is not
Strife alone, but Strife and Love together, that produce change. Plato
couples Heraclitus and Empedocles in the Sophist (242):</p>
<p>There are Ionian, and in more recent time Sicilian, muses, who have
arrived at the conclusion that to unite the two principles (of the One
and the Many), is safer, and to say that being is one and many, and that
these are held together by enmity and friendship, ever parting, ever
meeting, as the severer Muses assert, while the gentler ones do not
insist on the perpetual strife and peace, but admit a relaxation and
alternation of them; peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway
of Aphrodite, and then again plurality and war, by reason of a principle
of strife.</p>
<p>Empedocles held that the material world is a sphere; that in the
Golden Age Strife was outside and Love inside; then, gradually, Strife
entered and Love was expelled, until, at the worst, Strife will be
wholly within and Love wholly without the sphere. Then—though for what
reason is not clear—an opposite movement begins, until the Golden Age
returns, but not for ever. The whole cycle is then repeated. One might
have supposed that either extreme could be stable, but that is not the
view of Empedocles. He wished to explain motion while taking account of
the arguments of Parmenides, and he had no wish to arrive, at any stage,
at an unchanging universe.</p>
<p>The views of Empedocles on religion are, in the main, Pythagorean. In
a fragment which, in all likelihood, refers to Pythagoras, he says:
‘There was among them a man of rare knowledge, most skilled in all
manner of wise works, a man who had won the utmost wealth of wisdom; for
whensoever he strained with all his mind, he easily saw everything of
all the things that are, in ten, yea twenty lifetimes of men.’ In the
Golden. Age, as already mentioned, men worshipped only Aphrodite, ‘and
the altar did not reek with pure bull’s blood, but this was held in the
greatest abomination among men, to eat the goodly limbs after tearing
out the life’.</p>
<p>At one time he speaks of himself exuberantly as a god:</p>
<p>Friends, that inhabit the great city looking down on the yellow rock
of Acragas, up by the citadel, busy in goodly works, harbour of honour
for the stranger, men unskilled in meanness, all hail. I go about among
you an immortal god, no mortal now, honoured among all as is meet,
crowned with fillets and flowery garlands. Straightway, whenever I enter
with these in my train, both men and women, into the flourishing towns,
is reverence done me; they go after me in countless throngs, asking of
me what is the way to gain; some desiring oracles, while some, who for
many a weary day have been pierced by the grievous pangs of all manner
of sickness, beg to hear from me the word of healing…. But why do I harp
on these things, as if it were any great matter that I should surpass
mortal, perishable men?</p>
<p>At another time he feels himself a great sinner, undergoing expiation
for his impiety:</p>
<p>There is an oracle of Necessity, an ancient ordinance of the gods,
eternal and sealed fast by broad oaths, that whenever one of the
daemons, whose portion is length of days, has sinfully polluted his
hands with blood, or followed strife and forsworn himself, he must
wander thrice ten thousand years from the abodes of the blessed, being
born throughout the time in all manners of mortal forms, changing one
toilsome path of life for another. For the mighty Air drives him into
the Sea, and the Sea spews him forth upon the dry Earth; Earth tosses
him into the beams of the blazing Sun, and he flings him back to the
eddies of Air. One takes him from the other, and all reject him. One of
these I now am, an exile and a wanderer from the gods, for that I put my
trust in an insensate strife.</p>
<p>What his sin had been, we do not know; perhaps nothing that we should
think very grievous. For he says:</p>
<p>’Ah, woe is me that the pitiless day of death did not destroy me ere
ever I wrought evil deeds of devouring with my lips!…</p>
<p>’Abstain wholly from laurel leaves…</p>
<p>‘Wretches, utter wretches, keep your hands from beans!’</p>
<p>So perhaps he had done nothing worse than munching laurel leaves or
guzzling beans.</p>
<p>The most famous passage in Plato, in which he compares this world to
a cave, in which we see only shadows of the realities in the bright
world above, is anticipated by Empedocles; its origin is in the teaching
of the Orphics.</p>
<p>There are some—presumably those who abstain from sin through many
incarnations—who at last achieve immortal bliss in the company of the
gods:</p>
<p>But at the last, they1 appear among mortal men as prophets,
song-writers, physicians, and princes; and thence they rise up as gods
exalted in honour, sharing the hearth of the other gods and the same
table, free from human woes, safe from destiny, and incapable of
hurt.</p>
<p>In all this, it would seem, there is very little that was not already
contained in the teaching of Orphism and Pythagoreanism.</p>
<p>The originality of Empedocles, outside science, consists in the
doctrine of the four elements, and in the use of the two principles of
Love and Strife to explain change.</p>
<p>He rejected monism, and regarded the course of nature as regulated by
chance and necessity rather than by purpose. In these respects his
philosophy was more scientific than those of Parmenides, Plato, and
Aristotle. In other respects, it is true, he acquiesced in current
superstitions; but in this he was no worse than many more recent men of
science.</p>
