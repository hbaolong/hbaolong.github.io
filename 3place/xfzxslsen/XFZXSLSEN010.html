<h4 id="athens-in-relation-to-culture">7 ATHENS IN RELATION TO
CULTURE</h4>
<p>The greatness of Athens begins at the time of the two Persian wars
(490 B.C. and 480–79 B.C.). Before that time Ionia and Magna Graecia
(the Greek cities of south Italy and Sicily) produced the great men. The
victory of Athens against the Persian king Darius at Marathon (490), and
of the combined Greek fleets against his son and successor Xerxes (480)
under Athenian leadership, gave Athens great prestige. The Ionians in
the islands and on part of the mainland of Asia Minor had rebelled
against Persia, and their liberation was effected by Athens after the
Persians had been driven from the mainland of Greece. In this operation
the Spartans, who cared only about their own territory, took no part.
Thus Athens became the predominant partner in an alliance against
Persia. By the constitution of the alliance, any constituent State was
bound to contribute either a specified number of ships, or the cost of
them. Most chose the latter, and thus Athens acquired naval supremacy
over the other allies, and gradually transformed the alliance into an
Athenian Empire. Athens became rich, and prospered under the wise
leadership of Pericles, who governed, by the free choice of the
citizens, for about thirty years, until his fall in 430 B.C.</p>
<p>The age of Pericles was the happiest and most glorious time in the
history of Athens. Aeschylus, who had fought in the Persian wars,
inaugurated Greek tragedy; one of his tragedies, the Persae, departing
from the custom of choosing Homeric subjects, deals with the defeat of
Xerxes. He was quickly followed by Sophocles, and Sophocles by
Euripides. Both extend into the dark days of the Peloponnesian War that
followed the fall and death of Pericles, and Euripides reflects in his
plays the scepticism of the later period. His contemporary Aristophanes,
the comic poet, makes fun of all isms from the standpoint of robust and
limited common sense; more particularly, he holds up Socrates to obloquy
as one who denies the existence of Zeus and dabbles in unholy
pseudo-scientific mysteries.</p>
<p>Athens had been captured by Xerxes, and the temples on the Acropolis
had been destroyed by fire. Pericles devoted himself to their
reconstruction. The Parthenon and the other temples whose ruins remain
to impress our age were built by him. Pheidias the sculptor was employed
by the State to make colossal statues of gods and goddesses. At the end
of this period, Athens was the most beautiful and splendid city of the
Hellenic world.</p>
<p>Herodotus, the father of history, was a native of Halicarnassus, in
Asia Minor, but lived in Athens, was encouraged by the Athenian State,
and wrote his account of the Persian wars from the Athenian point of
view.</p>
<p>The achievements of Athens in the time of Pericles are perhaps the
most astonishing thing in all history. Until that time, Athens had
lagged behind many other Greek cities; neither in art nor in literature
had it produced any great man (except Solon, who was primarily a
lawgiver). Suddenly, under the stimulus of victory and wealth and the
need of reconstruction, architects, sculptors, and dramatists, who
remain unsurpassed to the present day, produced works which dominated
the future down to modern times. This is the more surprising when we
consider the smallness of the population involved. Athens at its
maximum, about 430 B.C., is estimated to have numbered about 230,000
(including slaves), and the surrounding territory of rural Attica
probably contained a rather smaller population. Never before or since
has anything approaching the same proportion of the inhabitants of any
area shown itself capable of work of the highest excellence.</p>
<p>In philosophy, Athens contributes only two great names, Socrates and
Plato. Plato belongs to a somewhat later period, but Socrates passed his
youth and early manhood under Pericles. The Athenians were sufficiently
interested in philosophy to listen eagerly to teachers from other
cities. The Sophists were sought after by young men who wished to learn
the art of disputation; in the Protagoras, the Platonic Socrates gives
an amusing satirical description of the ardent disciples hanging on the
words of the eminent visitor. Pericles, as we shall see, imported
Anaxagoras, from whom Socrates professed to have learned the
pre-eminence of mind in creation.</p>
<p>Most of Plato’s dialogues are supposed by him to take place during
the time of Pericles, and they give an agreeable picture of life among
the rich. Plato belonged to an aristocratic Athenian family, and grew up
in the tradition of the period before war and democracy had destroyed
the wealth and security of the upper classes. His young men, who, have
no need to work, spend most of their leisure in the pursuit of science
and mathematics and philosophy; they know Homer almost by heart, and are
critical judges of the merits of professional reciters of poetry. The
art of deductive reasoning had been lately discovered, and afforded the
excitement of new theories, both true and false, over the whole field of
knowledge. It was possible in that age, as in few others, to be both
intelligent and happy, and happy through intelligence.</p>
<p>But the balance of forces which produced this golden age was
precarious. It was threatened both from within and from without—from
within by the democracy, and from without by Sparta. To understand what
happened after Pericles, we must consider briefly the earlier history of
Attica.</p>
<p>Attica, at the beginning of the historical period, was a
self-supporting little agricultural region; Athens, its capital, was not
large, but contained a growing population of artisans and skilled
artificers who desired to dispose of their produce abroad. Gradually it
was found more profitable to cultivate vines and olives rather than
grain, and to import grain, chiefly from the coast of the Black Sea.
This form of cultivation required more capital than the cultivation of
grain, and the small farmers got into debt. Attica, like other Greek
states, had been a monarchy in the Homeric age, but the king became a
merely religious official without political power. The government fell
into the hands of the aristocracy, who oppressed both the country
farmers and the urban artisans. A compromise in the direction of
democracy was effected by Solon early in the sixth century, and much of
his work survived through a subsequent period of tyranny under
Peisistratus and his sons. When this period came to an end, the
aristocrats, as the opponents of tyranny, were able to recommend
themselves to the democracy. Until the fall of Pericles, democratic
processes gave power to the aristocracy, as in nineteenth-century
England. But towards the end of his life the leaders of the Athenian
democracy began to demand a larger share of political power. At the same
time, his imperialist policy, with which the economic prosperity of
Athens was bound up, caused increasing friction with Sparta, leading at
last to the Peloponnesian War (431–404), in which Athens was completely
defeated.</p>
<p>In spite of political collapse, the prestige of Athens survived, and
throughout almost a millennium philosophy was centred there. Alexandria
eclipsed Athens in mathematics and science, but Plato and Aristotle had
made Athens philosophically supreme. The Academy, where Plato had
taught, survived all other schools, and persisted, as an island of
paganism, for two centuries after the conversion of the Roman Empire to
Christianity. At last, in A.D. 529, it was closed by Justinian because
of his religious bigotry, and the Dark Ages descended upon Europe.</p>
