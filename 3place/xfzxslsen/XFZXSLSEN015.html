<h4 id="the-influence-of-sparta">12 THE INFLUENCE OF SPARTA</h4>
<p>To understand Plato, and indeed many later philosophers, it is
necessary to know something of Sparta. Sparta had a double effect on
Greek thought: through the reality, and through the myth. Each is
important. The reality enabled the Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the
myth influenced Plato’s political theory, and that of countless
subsequent writers. The myth, fully developed, is to be found in
Plutarch’s Life of Lycurgus; the ideals that it favours have had a great
part in framing the doctrines of Rousseau, Nietzsche, and National
Socialism.1 The myth is of even more importance, historically, than the
reality; nevertheless, we will begin with the latter. For the reality
was the source of the myth.</p>
<p>Laconia, of which Sparta, or Lacedaemon was the capital, occupied the
south-east of the Peloponnesus. The Spartans, who were the ruling race,
had conquered the country at the time of the Dorian invasion from the
north, and had reduced the population that they found there to the
condition of serfs. These serfs were called helots. In historical times,
all the land belonged to the Spartans, who, however, were forbidden by
law and custom to cultivate it themselves, both on the ground that such
labour was degrading, and in order that they might always be free for
military service. The serfs were not bought and sold, but remained
attached to the land, which was divided into lots, one or more for each
adult male Spartan. These lots, like the helots, could not be bought or
sold, and passed, by law, from father to son. (They could, however, be
bequeathed.) The landowner received from the helot who cultivated the
lot seventy medimni (about 105 bushels) of grain for himself, twelve for
his</p>
<p>wife, and a stated portion of wine and fruit annually.2 Anything
beyond this amount was the property of the helot. The helots were
Greeks, like the Spartans, and bitterly resented their servile
condition. When they could, they rebelled. The Spartans had a body of
secret police to deal with this danger, but to supplement this
precaution they had another: once a year, they declared war on the
helots, so that their young men could kill any who seemed insubordinate
without incurring the legal guilt of homicide. Helots could be
emancipated by the State, but not by their masters; they were
emancipated, rather rarely, for exceptional bravery in battle.</p>
<p>At some time during the eighth century B.C. the Spartans conquered
the neighbouring country of Messenia, and reduced most of its
inhabitants to the condition of helots. There had been a lack of
Lebensraum in Sparta, but the new territory, for a time, removed this
source of discontent.</p>
<p>Lots were for the common run of Spartans; the aristocracy had estates
of their own, whereas the lots were portions of common land assigned by
the State.</p>
<p>The free inhabitants of other parts of Laconia, called ‘perioeci’,
had no share of political power.</p>
<p>The sole business of a Spartan citizen was war, to which he was
trained from birth. Sickly children were exposed after inspection by the
heads of the tribe; only those judged vigorous were allowed to be
reared. Up to the age of twenty, all the boys were trained in one big
school; the purpose of the training was to make them hardy, indifferent
to pain, and submissive to discipline. There was no nonsense about
cultural or scientific education; the sole aim was to produce good
soldiers, wholly devoted to the State.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty, actual military service began. Marriage was
permitted to anyone over the age of twenty, but until the age of thirty
a man had to live in the ‘men’s house’, and had to manage his marriage
as if it were an illicit and secret affair. After thirty, he was a
full-fledged citizen. Every citizen belonged to a mess, and dined with
the other members; he had to make a contribution in kind from the
produce of his lot. It was the theory of the State that no Spartan
citizen should be destitute, and none should be rich. Each was expected
to live on the produce of his lot, which he could not alienate except by
free gift. None was allowed to own gold or silver, and the money was
made of iron. Spartan simplicity became proverbial.</p>
<p>The position of women in Sparta was peculiar. They were not secluded,
like respectable women elsewhere in Greece. Girls went through the same
physical training as was given to boys; what is more remarkable, boys
and</p>
<p>girls did their gymnastics together, all being naked. It was desired
(I quote Plutarch’s Lycurgus in North’s translation):</p>
<p>that the maidens should harden their bodies with exercise of running,
wrestling, throwing the bar, and casting the dart, to the end that the
fruit wherewith they might be afterwards conceived, taking nourishment
of a strong and lusty body, should shoot out and spread the better: and
that they by gathering strength thus by exercises, should more easily
away with the pains of child bearing…. And though the maidens did show
themselves thus naked openly, yet was there no dishonesty seen nor
offered, but all this sport was full of play and toys, without any
youthful part or wantonness.</p>
<p>Men who would not marry were made ‘infamous by law’, and compelled,
even in the coldest weather, to walk up and down naked outside the place
where the young people were doing their exercises and dances.</p>
<p>Women were not allowed to exhibit any emotion not profitable to the
State. They might display contempt for a coward, and would be praised if
he were their son; but they might not show grief if their new-born child
was condemned to death as a weakling, or if their sons were killed in
battle. They were considered, by other Greeks, exceptionally chaste; at
the same time, a childless married woman would raise no objection if the
State ordered her to find out whether some other man would be more
successful than her husband in begetting citizens. Children were
encouraged by legislation. According to Aristotle, the father of three
sons was exempt from military service, and the father of four from all
the burdens of the State.</p>
<p>The constitution of Sparta was complicated. There were two kings,
belonging to two different families, and succeeding by heredity. One or
other of the kings commanded the army in time of war, but in time of
peace their powers were limited. At communal feasts they got twice as
much to eat as any one else, and there was general mourning when one of
them died. They were members of the Council of Elders, a body consisting
of thirty men (including the kings); the other twenty-eight must be over
sixty, and were chosen for life by the whole body of the citizens, but
only from aristocratic families. The Council tried criminal cases, and
prepared matters which were to come before the Assembly. This body (the
Assembly) consisted of all the citizens; it could not initiate anything,
but could vote yes or no to any proposal brought before it. No law could
be enacted without its consent. But its consent, though necessary, was
not sufficient; the elders and magistrates must proclaim the decision
before it became valid.</p>
<p>In addition to the kings, the Council of Elders, and the Assembly,
there was a fourth branch of the government, peculiar to Sparta. This
was the five ephors. These were chosen out of the whole body of the
citizens, by a method which Aristotle says was ‘too childish’, and which
Bury says was virtually by lot. They were a ‘democratic’ element in the
constitution,3 apparently intended to balance the kings. Every month the
kings swore to uphold the constitution, and the ephors then swore to
uphold the kings so long as they remained true to their oath. When
either king went on a warlike expedition, two ephors accompanied him to
watch his behaviour. The ephors were the supreme civil court, but over
the kings they had criminal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Spartan constitution was supposed, in later antiquity, to have
been due to a legislator named Lycurgus, who was said to have
promulgated his laws in 885 B.C. In fact, the Spartan system grew up
gradually, and Lycurgus was a mythical person, originally a god. His
name meant ‘wolf-repeller’, and his origin was Arcadian.</p>
<p>Sparta aroused among the other Greeks an admiration which is to us
somewhat surprising. Originally, it had been much less different from
other Greek cities than it became later; in early days it produced poets
and artists as good as those elsewhere. But about the seventh century
B.C., or perhaps even later, its constitution (falsely attributed to
Lycurgus) crystallized into the form we have been considering;
everything else was sacrificed to success in war, and Sparta ceased to
have any part whatever in what Greece contributed to the civilization of
the world. To us, the Spartan State appears as a model, in miniature, of
the State that the Nazis would establish if victorious. To the Greeks it
seemed otherwise. As Bury says:</p>
<p>A stranger from Athens or Miletus in the fifth century visiting the
straggling villages which formed her unwalled unpretentious city must
have had a feeling of being transported into an age long past, when men
were braver, better and simpler, unspoiled by wealth, undisturbed by
ideas. To a philosopher, like Plato, speculating in political science,
the Spartan State seemed the nearest approach to the ideal. The ordinary
Greek looked upon it as a structure of severe and simple beauty, a
Dorian city stately as a Dorian temple, far nobler than his own abode
but not so comfortable to dwell in.4</p>
<p>One reason for the admiration felt for Sparta by other Greeks was its
stability. All other Greek cities had revolutions, but the Spartan
constitution remained unchanged for centuries, except for a gradual
increase in the powers of the ephors, which occurred by legal means,
without violence.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that, for a long period, the Spartans were
successful in their main purpose, the creation of a race of invincible
warriors. The battle of Thermopylae (480 B.C.), though technically a
defeat, is perhaps the best example of their valour. Thermopylae was a
narrow pass through the mountains, where it was hoped that the Persian
army could be held. Three hundred Spartans, with auxiliaries, repulsed
all frontal attacks. But at last the Persians discovered a detour
through the hills, and succeeded in attacking the Greeks on both sides
at once. Every single Spartan was killed at his post. Two men had been
absent on sick leave, suffering from a disease of the eyes amounting
almost to temporary blindness. One of them insisted on being led by his
helot to the battle, where he perished; the other, Aristodemus, decided
that he was too ill to fight, and remained absent. When he returned to
Sparta, no one would speak to him; he was called ‘the coward
Aristodemus’. A year later, he wiped out his disgrace by dying bravely
at the battle of Plataea, where the Spartans were victorious.</p>
<p>After the war, the Spartans erected a memorial on the battlefield of
Thermopylae, saying only: ‘Stranger, tell the Lacedaemonians that we lie
here, in obedience to their orders.’</p>
<p>For a long time, the Spartans proved themselves invincible on land.
They retained their supremacy until the year 371 B.C., when they were
defeated by the Thebans at the battle of Leuctra. This was the end of
their military greatness.</p>
<p>Apart from war, the reality of Sparta was never quite the same as the
theory. Herodotus, who lived at its great period, remarks, surprisingly,
that no Spartan could resist a bribe. This was in spite of the fact that
contempt for riches and love of the simple life was one of the main
things inculcated in Spartan education. We are told that the Spartan
women were chaste, yet it happened several times that a reputed heir to
the kingship was set aside on the ground of not being the son of his
mother’s husband. We are told that the Spartans were inflexibly
patriotic, yet the king Pausanias, the victor of Plataea, ended as a
traitor in the pay of Xerxes. Apart from such flagrant matters, the
policy of Sparta was always petty and provincial. When Athens liberated
the Greeks of Asia Minor and the adjacent islands from the Persians,
Sparta held aloof; so long as the Peloponnesus was deemed safe, the fate
of other Greeks was a matter of indifference. Every attempt at a
confederation of the Hellenic world was defeated by Spartan
particularism.</p>
<p>Aristotle, who lived after the downfall of Sparta, gives a very
hostile account of its constitution.5 What he says is so different from
what other people say that it is difficult to believe he is speaking of
the same place, e.g. ’The legislator wanted to make the whole State
hardy and temperate, and he</p>
<p>has carried out his intention in the case of men, but he has
neglected the women, who live in every sort of intemperance and luxury.
The consequence is that in such a State wealth is too highly valued,
especially if the citizens fall under the dominion of their wives, after
the manner of most warlike races…. Even in regard to courage, which is
of no use in daily life, and is needed only in war, the influence of the
Lacedaemonian women has been most mischievous…. This license of the
Lacedaemonian women existed from the earliest times, and was only what
might be expected. For … when Lycurgus, as tradition says, wanted to
bring the women under his laws, they resisted, and he gave up the
attempt.’</p>
<p>He goes on to accuse Spartans of avarice, which he attributes to the
unequal distribution of property. Although lots cannot be sold, he says,
they can be given or bequeathed. Two-fifths of all the land, he adds,
belongs to women. The consequence is a great diminution in the number of
citizens: it is said that once there were ten thousand, but at the time
of the defeat by Thebes there were less than one thousand.</p>
<p>Aristotle criticizes every point of the Spartan constitution. He says
that the ephors are often very poor, and therefore easy to bribe; and
their power is so great that even kings are compelled to court them, so
that the constitution has been turned into a democracy. The ephors, we
are told, have too much licence, and live in a manner contrary to the
spirit of the constitution, while the strictness in relation to ordinary
citizens is so intolerable that they take refuge in the secret illegal
indulgence of sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>Aristotle wrote when Sparta was decadent, but on some points he
expressly says that the evil he is mentioning has existed from early
times. His tone is so dry and realistic that it is difficult to
disbelieve him, and it is in line with all modern experience of the
results of excessive severity in the laws. But it was not Aristotle’s
Sparta that persisted in men’s imagination; it was the mythical Sparta
of Plutarch and the philosophic idealization of Sparta in Plato’s
Republic. Century after century, young men read these works, and were
fired with the ambition to become Lycurguses or philosopher-kings. The
resulting union of idealism and love of power has led men astray over
and over again, and is still doing so in the present day.</p>
<p>The myth of Sparta, for medieval and modern readers, was mainly fixed
by Plutarch. When he wrote, Sparta belonged to the romantic past; its
great period was as far removed from his time as Columbus is from ours.
What he says must be treated with great caution by the historian of
institutions, but to the historian of myth it is of the utmost
importance. Greece has influenced the world, always, through its effect
on men’s imaginations, ideals, and hopes, not directly through political
power. Rome made roads which largely still survive, and laws which are
the source of many modern legal codes, but it was the armies of Rome
that made these things important. The Greeks, though admirable fighters,
made few conquests, because they expended their military fury mainly on
each other. It was left to the semi-barbarian Alexander to spread
Hellenism throughout the Near East, and to make Greek the literary
language in Egypt and Syria and the inland parts of Asia Minor. The
Greeks could never have accomplished this task, not for lack of military
force, but owing to their incapacity for political cohesion. The
political vehicles of Hellenism have always been non-Hellenic; but it
was the Greek genius that so inspired alien nations as to cause them to
spread the culture of those whom they had conquered.</p>
<p>What is important to the historian of the world is not the petty wars
between Greek cities, or the sordid squabbles for party ascendancy, but
the memories retained by mankind when the brief episode was ended—like
the recollection of a brilliant sunrise in the Alps, while the
mountaineer struggles through an arduous day of wind and snow. These
memories, as they gradually faded, left in men’s minds the images of
certain peaks that had shone with peculiar brightness in the early
light, keeping alive the knowledge that behind the clouds a splendour
still survived, and might at any moment become manifest. Of these, Plato
was the most important in early Christianity, Aristotle in the medieval
Church; but when, after the Renaissance, men began to value political
freedom, it was above all to Plutarch that they turned. He influenced
profoundly the English and French liberals of the eighteenth century,
and the founders of the United States; he influenced the romantic
movement in Germany, and has continued, mainly by indirect channels, to
influence German thought down to the present day. In some ways his
influence was good, in some bad; as regards Lycurgus and Sparta, it was
bad. What he has to say about Lycurgus is important, and I shall give a
brief account of it, even at the cost of some repetition.</p>
<p>Lycurgus—so Plutarch says—having resolved to give laws to Sparta,
travelled widely in order to study different institutions. He liked the
laws of Crete, which were ‘very straight and severe’,6 but disliked
those of Ionia, where there were ‘superfluities and vanities’. In Egypt
he learned the advantage of separating the soldiers from the rest of the
people, and afterwards, having returned from his travels, ‘brought the
practice of it into Sparta: where setting the merchants, artificers, and
labourers every one a part by themselves, he did establish a noble
Commonwealth’. He made an equal division of lands among all the citizens
of Sparta in order to ‘banish out of the city all insolvency, envy,
covetousness, and deliciousness, and also all riches and poverty’. He
forbade gold and silver money, allowing only iron coinage, of so little
value that ‘to lay up thereof the value of ten minas, it would have
occupied a whole cellar in a house’. By this means he banished ’all
superfluous</p>
<p>and unprofitable sciences’, since there was not enough money to pay
their practitioners; and by the same law he made all external commerce
impossible. Rhetoricians, panders, and jewellers, not liking the iron
money, avoided Sparta. He next ordained that all the citizens should eat
together, and all should have the same food.</p>
<p>Lycurgus, like other reformers, thought the education of children
‘the chiefest and greatest matter, that a reformer of laws should
establish’; and like all who aim chiefly at military power, he was
anxious to keep up the birth rate. The ‘plays, sports, and dances the
maids did naked before young men, were provocation to draw and allure
the young men to marry: not as persuaded by geometrical reasons, as
saith Plato, but brought to it by liking, and of very love’. The habit
of treating a marriage, for the first few years, as if it were a
clandestine affair, ‘continued in both parties a still burning love, and
a new desire of the one to the other’—such, at least, is the opinion of
Plutarch. He goes on to explain that a man was not thought ill of if,
being old and having a young wife, he allowed a younger man to have
children by her. ‘It was lawful also for an honest man that loved
another man’s wife … to intreat her husband to suffer him to lie with
her, and that he might also plough in that lusty ground, and cast abroad
the seed of well-favoured children’. There was to be no foolish
jealousy, for ‘Lycurgus did not like that children should be private to
any men, but that they should be common to the common weal: by which
reason he would also, that such as should become citizens should not be
begotten of every man, but of the most honest men only.’ He goes on to
explain that this is the principle that farmers apply to their
live-stock.</p>
<p>When a child was born, the father brought him before the elders of
his family to be examined: if he was healthy, he was given back to the
father to be reared; if not, he was thrown into a deep pit of water.
Children, from the first, were subjected to a severe hardening process,
in some respects good—for example, they were not put in swaddling
clothes. At the age of seven, boys were taken away from home and put in
a boarding school, where they were divided into companies, each under
the orders of one of their number, chosen for sense and courage.
‘Touching learning they had as much as served their turn: for the rest
of their time they spent in learning how to obey, to away with pain, to
endure labour, to overcome still in fight.’ They played naked together
most of the time; after twelve years old, they wore no coats; they were
always ‘nasty and sluttish’, and they never bathed except on certain
days in the year. They slept on beds of straw, which in winter they
mixed with thistle. They were taught to steal, and were punished if
caught—not for stealing, but for stupidity.</p>
<p>Homosexual love, male if not female, was a recognized custom in
Sparta, and had an acknowledged part in the education of adolescent
boys. A boy’s lover suffered credit or discredit by the boy’s actions;
Plutarch states that once, when a boy cried out because he was hurt in
fighting, his lover was fined for the boy’s cowardice.</p>
<p>There was little liberty at any stage in the life of a Spartan.</p>
<p>Their discipline and order of life continued still, after they were
full grown men. For it was not lawful for any man to live as he listed,
but they were within their city, as if they had been in a camp, where
every man knoweth what allowance he hath to live withal, and what
business he hath else to do in his calling. To be short, they were all
of this mind, that they were not born to serve themselves, but to serve
their country…. One of the best and happiest things which Lycurgus ever
brought into his city, was the great rest and leisure which he made his
citizens to have, only forbidding them that they should not profess any
vile or base occupation: and they needed not also to be careful to get
great riches, in a place where goods were nothing profitable nor
esteemed. For the Helots, which were bond men made by the wars, did till
their grounds, and yielded them a certain revenue every year.</p>
<p>Plutarch goes on to tell a story of an Athenian condemned for
idleness, upon hearing of which a Spartan exclaimed: ‘show me the man
condemned for living nobly and like a gentleman.’</p>
<p>Lycurgus (Plutarch continues) ‘did accustom his citizens so, that
they neither would nor could live alone, but were in manner as men
incorporated one with another, and were always in company together, as
the bees be about their master bee’.</p>
<p>Spartans were not allowed to travel, nor were foreigners admitted to
Sparta, except on business; for it was feared that alien customs would
corrupt Lacedaemonian virtue.</p>
<p>Plutarch relates the law that allowed Spartans to kill helots
whenever they felt so disposed, but refuses to believe that anything so
abominable can have been due to Lycurgus. ‘For I cannot be persuaded,
that ever Lycurgus invented, or instituted so wicked and mischievous an
act, as that kind of ordinance was: because I imagine his nature was
gentle and merciful, by the clemency and justice we see he used in all
his other doings.’ Except in this matter Plutarch has nothing but praise
for the constitution of Sparta.</p>
<p>The effect of Sparta on Plato, with whom, at the moment, we shall be
specially concerned, will be evident from the account of his Utopia,
which will occupy the next chapter.</p>
