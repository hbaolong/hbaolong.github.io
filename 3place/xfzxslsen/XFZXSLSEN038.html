<h4 id="the-fifth-and-sixth-centuries">5 THE FIFTH AND SIXTH
CENTURIES</h4>
<p>The fifth century was that of the barbarian invasion and the fall of
the Western Empire. After the death of Augustine in 430, there was
little philosophy; it was a century of destructive action, which,
however, largely determined the lines upon which Europe was to be
developed. It was in this century that the English invaded Britain,
causing it to become England; it was also in this century that the
Frankish invasion turned Gaul into France, and that the Vandals invaded
Spain, giving their name to Andalusia. St Patrick, during the middle
years of the century, converted the Irish to Christianity. Throughout
the Western World, rough Germanic kingdoms succeeded the centralized
bureaucracy of the Empire. The imperial post ceased, the great roads
fell into decay, war put an end to large-scale commerce, and life again
became local both politically and economically. Centralized authority
was preserved only in the Church, and there with much difficulty.</p>
<p>Of the Germanic tribes that invaded the Empire in the fifth century,
the most important were the Goths. They were pushed westwards by the
Huns, who attacked them from the East. At first they tried to conquer
the Eastern Empire, but were defeated; then they turned upon Italy.
Since Diocletian, they had been employed as Roman mercenaries; this had
taught them more of the art of war than barbarians would otherwise have
known. Alaric, king of the Goths, sacked Rome in 410, but died the same
year. Odovaker, king of the Ostrogoths, put an end to the Western Empire
in 476, and reigned until 493, when he was treacherously murdered by
another Ostrogoth, Theodoric, who was king of Italy until 526. Of him I
shall have more to say shortly. He was important both in history and
legend; in the Niebelungenlied he appears as ‘Dietrich von Bern’ (‘Bern’
being Verona).</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Vandals established themselves in Africa, the Visigoths
in the south of France, and the Franks in the north.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Germanic invasion came the inroads of the Huns
under Attila. The Huns were of Mongul race, and yet they were often
allied with the Goths. At the crucial moment, however, when they invaded
Gaul in 451, they had quarrelled with the Goths; the Goths and Romans
together defeated them in that year at Chalons. Attila then turned
against Italy, and thought of marching on Rome, but Pope Leo dissuaded
him, pointing out that Alaric had died after sacking Rome. His
forbearance, however, did him no service, for he died in the following
year. After his death the power of the Huns collapsed.</p>
<p>During this period of confusion the Church was troubled by a
complicated controversy on the Incarnation. The protagonists in the
debates were two ecclesiastics, Cyril and Nestorius, of whom, more or
less by accident, the former was proclaimed a saint and the latter a
heretic. St Cyril was patriarch of Alexandria from about 412 till his
death in 444; Nestorius was patriarch of Constantinople. The question at
issue was the relation of Christ’s divinity to His humanity. Were there
two Persons, one human and one divine? This was the view held by
Nestorius. If not, was there only one nature, or were there two natures
in one person, a human nature and a divine nature? These questions
roused, in the fifth century, an almost incredible degree of passion and
fury. ’A secret and incurable discord was cherished between those who
were most apprehensive of confounding, and those who were most fearful
of separating, the divinity and the humanity of Christ.’1</p>
<p>St Cyril, the advocate of unity, was a man of fanatical zeal. He used
his position as patriarch to incite pogroms against the very large
Jewish colony in Alexandria. His chief claim to fame is the lynching of
Hypatia, a distinguished lady who, in an age of bigotry, adhered to the
Neoplatonic philosophy and devoted her talents to mathematics. She was
’torn from her chariot, stripped naked, dragged to the church, and
inhumanly butchered by the hands of Peter the Reader and a troop of
savage and merciless fanatics: her flesh was scraped from her bones with
sharp oyster-shells and her quivering limbs were delivered to the
flames. The just progress of inquiry and punishment was stopped by
seasonable gifts.’2 After this, Alexandria was no longer troubled by
philosophers.</p>
<p>St Cyril was pained to learn that Constantinople was being led astray
by the teaching of its patriarch Nestorius, who maintained that there
were two Persons in Christ, one human and one divine. On this ground
Nestorius</p>
<p>objected to the new practice of calling the Virgin ‘Mother of God’;
she was, he said, only the mother of the human Person, while the divine
Person, who was God, had no mother. On this question the Church was
divided: roughly speaking, bishops east of Suez favoured Nestorius,
while those west of Suez favoured St Cyril. A council was summoned to
meet at Ephesus in 431 to decide the question. The Western bishops
arrived first, and proceeded to lock the doors against latecomers and
decide in hot haste for St Cyril, who presided. ’This episcopal tumult,
at the distance of thirteen centuries, assumes the venerable aspect of
the third oecumenical Council.’3</p>
<p>As a result of this council, Nestorius was condemned as a heretic. He
did not recant, but was the founder of the Nestorian sect, which had a
large following in Syria and throughout the East. Some centuries later,
Nestorianism was so strong in China that it seemed to have a chance of
becoming the established religion. Nestorians were found in India by the
Spanish and Portuguese missionaries in the sixteenth century. The
persecution of Nestorianism by the Catholic government of Constantinople
caused disaffection which helped the Mohammedans in their conquest of
Syria.</p>
<p>The tongue of Nestorius, which by its eloquence had seduced so many,
was eaten by worms—so at least we are assured.</p>
<p>Ephesus had learnt to substitute the Virgin for Artemis, but had
still the same intemperate zeal for its goddess as in the time of St
Paul. It was said that the Virgin was buried there. In 449, after the
death of St Cyril, a synod at Ephesus tried to carry the triumph
further, and thereby fell into the heresy opposite to that of Nestorius;
this is called the Monophysite heresy, and maintains that Christ has
only one nature. If St Cyril had still been alive, he would certainly
have supported this view, and have become heretical. The Emperor
supported the synod, but the Pope repudiated it. At last Pope Leo—the
same Pope who turned Attila from attacking Rome—in the year of the
battle of Chalons secured the summoning of an oecumenical council at
Chalcedon in 451, which condemned the Monophysites and finally decided
the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation. The Council of Ephesus had
decided that there is only one Person of Christ, but the Council of
Chalcedon decided that He exists in two natures, one human and one
divine. The influence of the Pope was paramount in securing this
decision.</p>
<p>The Monophysites, like the Nestorians, refused to submit. Egypt,
almost to a man, adopted their heresy, which spread up the Nile and as
far as Abyssinia. The heresy of the Abyssinians was given by Mussolini
as one of his reasons for conquering them. The heresy of Egypt, like the
opposite heresy of Syria, facilitated the Arab conquest.</p>
<p>During the sixth century, there were four men of great importance in
the history of culture: Boethius, Justinian, Benedict, and Gregory the
Great. They will be my chief concern in the remainder of this chapter
and in the next.</p>
<p>The Gothic conquest of Italy did not put an end to Roman
civilization. Under Theodoric, king of Italy and of the Goths, the civil
administration of Italy was entirely Roman; Italy enjoyed peace and
religious toleration (till near the end); the king was both wise and
vigorous. He appointed consuls, preserved Roman law, and kept up the
Senate: when in Rome, his first visit was to the Senate House.</p>
<p>Though an Arian, Theodoric was on good terms with the Church until
his last years. In 523, the Emperor Justin proscribed Arianism, and this
annoyed Theodoric. He had reason for fear, since Italy was Catholic, and
was led by theological sympathy to side with the Emperor. He believed,
rightly or wrongly, that there was a plot involving men in his own
government. This led him to imprison and execute his minister, the
senator Boethius, whose Consolations of Philosophy was written while he
was in prison.</p>
<p>Boethius is a singular figure. Throughout the Middle Ages he was read
and admired, regarded always as a devout Christian and treated almost as
if he had been one of the Fathers. Yet his Consolations of Philosophy,
written in 524 while he was awaiting execution, is purely Platonic; it
does not prove that he was not a Christian, but it does show that pagan
philosophy had a much stronger hold on him than Christian theology. Some
theological works, especially one on the Trinity, which are attributed
to him, are by many authorities considered to be spurious; but it was
probably owing to them that the Middle Ages were able to regard him as
orthodox, and to imbibe from him much Platonism which would otherwise
have been viewed with suspicion.</p>
<p>The work is an alternation of verse and prose: Boethius, in his own
person, speaks in prose, while Philosophy answers in verse. There is a
certain resemblance to Dante, who was no doubt influenced by him in the
Vita Nuova.</p>
<p>The Consolations, which Gibbon rightly calls a ‘golden volume’,
begins by the statement that Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the true
philosophers; Stoics, Epicureans, and the rest are usurpers whom the
profane multitude mistook for the friends of philosophy. Boethius says
he obeyed the Pythagorean command to ‘follow God’ (not the Christian
command). Happiness, which is the same thing as blessedness, is the
good, not pleasure. Friendship is a ‘most sacred thing’. There is much
morality that agrees closely with Stoic doctrine, and is in fact largely
taken from Seneca. There is a summary, in verse, of the beginning of the
Timaeus. This is followed by a great deal of purely Platonic
metaphysics. Imperfection, we are told, is a lack, implying the
existence of a perfect pattern. He adopted the privative theory of evil.
He then passes on to a pantheism which should have shocked Christians,
but for some reason did not. Blessedness and God, he says, are both the
chiefest good, and are therefore identical. ‘Men are made happy by the
obtaining of divinity.’ ‘They who obtain divinity become gods. Wherefore
every one that is happy is a god, but by nature there is only one God,
but there may be many by participation.’ ‘The sum, origin, and cause of
all that is sought after is rightly thought to be goodness.’ ‘The
substance of God consisteth in nothing else but in goodness.’ Can God do
evil? No. Therefore evil is nothing, since God can do everything.
Virtuous men are always powerful, and bad men always weak; for both
desire the good, but only the virtuous get it. The wicked are more
unfortunate if they escape punishment than if they suffer it. ‘In wise
men there is no place for hatred.’</p>
<p>The tone of the book is more like that of Plato than that of
Plotinus. There is no trace of the superstition or morbidness of the
age, no obsession with sin, no excessive straining after the
unattainable. There is perfect philosophic calm—so much that, if the
book had been written in prosperity, it might almost have been called
smug. Written when it was, in prison under sentence of death, it is as
admirable as the last moments of the Platonic Socrates.</p>
<p>One does not find a similar outlook until after Newton. I will quote
in extenso one poem from the book, which, in its philosophy, is not
unlike Pope’s Essay on Man.</p>
<p>If Thou wouldst see</p>
<p>God’s laws with purest mind,</p>
<p>Thy sight on heaven fixed must be,</p>
<p>Whose settled course the stars in peace doth bind,</p>
<p>The sun’s bright fire</p>
<p>Stops not his sister’s team,</p>
<p>Nor doth the northern bear desire</p>
<p>Within the ocean’s wave to hide her beam.</p>
<p>Though she behold</p>
<p>The other stars there crouching,</p>
<p>Yet she incessantly is rolled</p>
<p>About high heaven, the ocean never touching.</p>
<p>The evening light</p>
<p>With certain course doth show</p>
<p>The coming of the shady night,</p>
<p>And Lucifer before the day doth go.</p>
<p>This mutual love</p>
<p>Courses eternal makes,</p>
<p>And from the starry spheres above</p>
<p>All cause of war and dangerous discord takes.</p>
<p>This sweet consent</p>
<p>In equal bands doth tie</p>
<p>The nature of each element</p>
<p>So that the moist things yield unto the dry.</p>
<p>The piercing cold</p>
<p>With flames doth friendship heap</p>
<p>The trembling fire the highest place doth hold,</p>
<p>And the gross earth sinks down into the deep.</p>
<p>The flowery year</p>
<p>Breathes odours in the spring,</p>
<p>The scorching summer corn doth bear,</p>
<p>The autumn fruit from laden trees doth bring.</p>
<p>The falling rain</p>
<p>Doth winter’s moisture give.</p>
<p>These rules thus nourish and maintain</p>
<p>All creatures which we see on earth to live.</p>
<p>And when they die,</p>
<p>These bring them to their end,</p>
<p>While their Creator sits on high,</p>
<p>Whose hand the reins of the whole world doth bend.</p>
<p>He as their king</p>
<p>Rules them with lordly might.</p>
<p>From Him they rise, flourish, and spring,</p>
<p>He as their law and judge decides their right.</p>
<p>Those things whose course</p>
<p>Most swiftly glides away</p>
<p>His might doth often backward force,</p>
<p>And suddenly their wandering motion stay.</p>
<p>Unless his strength</p>
<p>Their violence should bound,</p>
<p>And them which else would run at length,</p>
<p>Should bring within the compass of a round,</p>
<p>That firm decree</p>
<p>Which now doth all adorn</p>
<p>Would soon destroyed and broken be,</p>
<p>Things being far from their beginning borne.</p>
<p>This powerful love</p>
<p>Is common unto all,</p>
<p>Which for desire of good do move</p>
<p>Back to the springs from when they first did fall.</p>
<p>No worldly thing</p>
<p>Can a continuance have</p>
<p>Unless love back again it bring</p>
<p>Unto the cause which first the essence gave.</p>
<p>Boethius was, until the end, a friend of Theodoric. His father was
consul, he was consul, and so were his two sons. His father-in-law
Symmachus (probably grandson of the one who had a controversy with
Ambrose about the statue of Victory) was an important man in the court
of the Gothic king. Theodoric employed Boethius to reform the coinage,
and to astonish less sophisticated barbarian kings with such devices as
sun-dials and water-clocks. It may be that his freedom from superstition
was not so exceptional in Roman aristocratic families as elsewhere; but
its combination with great learning and zeal for the public good was
unique in that age. During the two centuries before his time and the ten
centuries after it, I cannot think of any European man of learning so
free from superstition and fanaticism. Nor are his merits merely
negative; his survey is lofty, disinterested, and sublime. He would have
been remarkable in any age; in the age in which he lived, he is utterly
amazing.</p>
<p>The medieval reputation of Boethius was partly due to his being
regarded as a martyr to Arian persecution—a view which began two or
three hundred years after his death. In Pavia, he was regarded as a
saint, but in fact he was not canonized. Though Cyril was a saint.
Boethius was not.</p>
<p>Two years after the execution of Boethius, Theodoric died. In the
next year, Justinian became Emperor. He reigned until 565, and in this
long time managed to do much harm and some good. He is of course chiefly
famous for his Digest, but I shall not venture on this topic, which is
one for the lawyers. He was a man of deep piety, which he signalized,
two years after his accession, by closing the schools of philosophy in
Athens, where paganism still reigned. The dispossessed philosophers
betook themselves to Persia, where the king received them kindly. But
they were shocked—more so, says Gibbon, than became philosophers—by the
Persian practices of polygamy and incest, so they returned home again,
and faded into obscurity. Three years after this exploit (532),
Justinian embarked upon another, more worthy of praise—the building of
St Sophia. I have never seen St Sophia, but I have seen the beautiful
contemporary mosaics at Ravenna, including portraits of Justinian and
his empress Theodora. Both were very pious, though Theodora was a lady
of easy virtue whom he had picked up in the circus. What is even worse,
she was inclined to be a Monophysite.</p>
<p>But enough of scandal. The Emperor himself, I am happy to say, was of
impeccable orthodoxy, even in the matter of the ‘Three Chapters’. This
was a vexatious controversy. The Council of Chalcedon had pronounced
orthodox three Fathers suspected of Nestorianism; Theodora, along with
many others, accepted all the other decrees of the Council, but not this
one. The Western Church stood for everything decided by the Council, and
the empress was driven to persecute the Pope. Justinian adored her, and
after her death in 548, she became to him what the dead Prince Consort
was to Queen Victoria. So in the end he lapsed into heresy, that of
Aphthartodocetism. A contemporary historian (Evagrius) writes: ‘Having
since the end of his life received the wages of his misdeeds, he has
gone to seek the justice which was his due before the judgment-seat of
hell.’</p>
<p>Justinian aspired to reconquer as much as possible of the Western
Empire. In 535 he invaded Italy, and at first had quick success against
the Goths. The Catholic population welcomed him, and he came as
representing Rome against the barbarians. But the Goths rallied, and the
war lasted eighteen years, during which Rome, and Italy generally,
suffered far more than in the barbarian invasion.</p>
<p>Rome was five times captured, thrice by Byzantines, twice by Goths,
and sank to a small town. The same sort of thing happened in Africa,
which Justinian also more or less reconquered. At first his armies were
welcomed; then it was found that Byzantine administration was corrupt
and Byzantine taxes were ruinous. In the end, many people wished the
Goths and Vandals back. The Church, however, until his last years, was
steadily on the side of the Emperor, because of his orthodoxy. He did
not attempt the reconquest of Gaul, partly because of distance, but
partly also because the Franks were orthodox.</p>
<p>In 568, three years after Justinian’s death, Italy was invaded by a
new and fierce German tribe, the Lombards. Wars between them and the
Byzantines continued intermittently for two hundred years, until nearly
the time of Charlemagne. The Byzantines held gradually less and less of
Italy; in the South, they had also to face the Saracens. Rome remained
nominally subject to them, and the popes treated the Eastern emperors
with deference. But in most parts of Italy the emperors, after the
coming of the Lombards, had very little authority or even none at all.
It was this period that ruined Italian civilization. It was refugees
from the Lombards who founded Venice, not, as tradition avers, fugitives
from Attila.</p>
