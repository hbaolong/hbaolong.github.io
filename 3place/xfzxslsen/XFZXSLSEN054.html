<h4 id="the-rise-of-science">6 THE RISE OF SCIENCE</h4>
<p>Almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier
centuries is attributable to science, which achieved its most
spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century. The Italian
Renaissance, though not medieval, is not modern; it is more akin to the
best age of Greece. The sixteenth century, with its absorption in
theology, is more medieval than the world of Machiavelli. The modern
world, so far as mental outlook is concerned, begins in the seventeeth
century. No Italian of the Renaissance would have been unintelligible to
Plato or Aristotle; Luther would have horrified Thomas Aquinas, but
would not have been difficult for him to understand. With the
seventeenth century it is different: Plato and Aristotle, Aquinas and
Occam, could not have made head or tail of Newton.</p>
<p>The new conceptions that science introduced profoundly influenced
modern philosophy. Descartes, who was in a sense the founder of modern
philosophy, was himself one of the creators of seventeenth-century
science. Something must be said about the methods and results of
astronomy and physics before the mental atmosphere of the time in which
modern philosophy began can be understood.</p>
<p>Four great men—Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton—are
pre-eminent in the creation of science. Of these, Copernicus belongs to
the sixteenth century, but in his own time he had little influence.</p>
<p>Copernicus (1473–1543) was a Polish ecclesiastic, of unimpeachable
orthodoxy. In his youth he travelled in Italy, and absorbed something of
the atmosphere of the Renaissance. In 1500 he had a lectureship or
professorship of mathematics in Rome, but in 1503 he returned to his
native land, where he was a canon of Frauenburg. Much of his time seems
to have been spent in combating the Germans and reforming the currency,
but his leisure was devoted to astronomy. He came early to believe that
the sun is at the centre of the universe, and that the earth has a
twofold motion: a diurnal rotation, and an annual revolution about the
sun. Fear of ecclesiastical censure led him to delay publication of his
views though he allowed them to become known. His chief work, De
Revolutionibus Orbium Cœlestium, was published in the year of his death
(1543), with a preface by his friend Osiander saying that the
heliocentric theory was only put forward as a hypothesis. It is
uncertain how far Copernicus sanctioned this statement, but the question
is not very important, as he himself made similar statements in the body
of the book.1 The book is dedicated to the Pope, and escaped official
Catholic condemnation until the time of Galileo. The Church in the
lifetime of Copernicus was more liberal than it became after the Council
of Trent, the Jesuits, and the revived Inquisition had done their
work.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of Copernicus’s work is not modern; it might rather be
described as Pythagorean. He takes it as axiomatic that all celestial
motions must be circular and uniform, and like the Greeks he allows
himself to be influenced by æsthetic motives. There are still epicycles
in his system, though their centres are at the sun, or, rather, near the
sun. The fact that the sun is not exactly in the centre marred the
simplicity of his theory. Though he had heard of the Pythagorean
doctrines, he does not seem to have known of Aristarchus’s heliocentric
theory, but there is nothing in his speculations that could not have
occurred to a Greek astronomer. What was important in his work was the
dethronement of the earth from its geometrical pre-eminence. In the long
run, this made it difficult to give to man the cosmic importance
assigned to him in the Christian theology, but such consequences of his
theory would not have been accepted by Copernicus, whose orthodoxy was
sincere, and who protested against the view that his theory contradicted
the Bible.</p>
<p>There were genuine difficulties in the Copernican theory. The
greatest of these was the absence of stellar parallax. If the earth at
any one point of its orbit is 186,000,000 miles from the point at which
it will be in six months, this ought to cause a shift in the apparent
positions of the stars, just as a ship at sea which is due north from
one point of the coast will not be due north from another. No parallax
was observed, and Copernicus rightly inferred that the fixed stars must
be very much more remote than the sun. It was not till the nineteenth
century that the technique of measurement became sufficiently precise
for stellar parallax to be observed, and then only in the case of a few
of the nearest stars.</p>
<p>Another difficulty arose as regards falling bodies. If the earth is
continually rotating from west to east, a body dropped from a height
ought not to fall to a</p>
<p>point vertically below its starting-point, but to a point somewhat
further west, since the earth will have slipped away a certain distance
during the time of the fall. To this difficulty the answer was found by
Galileo’s law of inertia, but in the time of Copernicus no answer was
forthcoming.</p>
<p>There is an interesting book by E. A. Burtt, called The Metaphysical
Foundations of Modern Physical Science (1925), which sets forth with
much force the many unwarrantable assumptions made by the men who
founded modern science. He points out quite truly that there were in the
time of Copernicus no known facts which compelled the adoption of his
system, and several which militated against it. ‘Contemporary
empiricists, had they lived in the sixteenth century, would have been
the first to scoff out of court the new philosophy of the universe.’ The
general purpose of the book is to discredit modern science by suggesting
that its discoveries were lucky accidents springing by chance from
superstitions as gross as those of the Middle Ages. I think this shows a
misconception of the scientific attitude: it is not what the man of
science believes that distinguishes him, but how and why he believes it.
His beliefs are tentative, not dogmatic; they are based on evidence, not
on authority or intuition. Copernicus was right to call his theory a
hypothesis; his opponents were wrong in thinking new hypotheses
undesirable.</p>
<p>The men who founded modern science had two merits which are not
necessarily found together: immense patience in observation, and great
boldness in framing hypotheses. The second of these merits had belonged
to the earliest Greek philosophers; the first existed, to a considerable
degree, in the later astronomers of antiquity. But no one among the
ancients, except perhaps Aristarchus, possessed both merits, and no one
in the Middle Ages possessed either. Copernicus, like his great
successors, possessed both. He knew all that could be known, with the
instruments existing in his day, about the apparent motions of the
heavenly bodies on the celestial sphere, and he perceived that the
diurnal rotation of the earth was a more economical hypothesis than the
revolution of all the celestial spheres. According to modern views,
which regard all motion as relative, simplicity is the only gain
resulting from his hypothesis, but this was not his view or that of his
contemporaries. As regards the earth’s annual revolution, there was
again a simplification, but not so notable a one as in the case of the
diurnal rotation. Copernicus still needed epicycles, though fewer than
were needed in the Ptolemaic system. It was not until Kepler discovered
his laws that the new theory acquired its full simplicity.</p>
<p>Apart from the revolutionary effect on cosmic imagination, the great
merits of the new astronomy were two: first, the recognition that what
had been believed since ancient times might be false; second, that the
test of scientific truth is patient collection of facts, combined with
bold guessing as to laws binding the facts together. Neither merit is so
fully developed in Copernicus as in his successors, but both are already
present in a high degree in his work.</p>
<p>Some of the men to whom Copernicus communicated his theory were
German Lutherans, but when Luther came to know of it, he was profoundly
shocked. ‘People give ear,’ he said, ‘to an upstart astrologer who
strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the
firmament, the sun and the moon. Whoever wishes to appear clever must
devise some new system, which of all systems is of course the very best.
This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred
Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not
the earth.’ Calvin similarly, demolished Copernicus with the text: ‘The
world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved’ (Psa. xciii. 1), and
exclaimed: ‘Who will venture to place the authority of Copernicus above
that of the Holy Spirit?’ Protestant clergy were at least as bigoted as
Catholic ecclesiastics; nevertheless there soon came to be much more
liberty of speculation in Protestant than in Catholic countries, because
in Protestant countries the clergy had less power. The important aspect
of Protestantism was schism, not heresy, for schism led to national
Churches, and national Churches were not strong enough to control the
lay government. This was wholly a gain, for the Churches, everywhere,
opposed as long as they could practically every innovation that made for
an increase of happiness or knowledge here on earth.</p>
<p>Copernicus was not in a position to give any conclusive evidence in
favour of his hypothesis, and for a long time astronomers rejected it.
The next astronomer of importance was Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), who
adopted an intermediate position: he held that the sun and moon go round
the earth, but the planets go round the sun. As regards theory he was
not very original. He gave, however, two good reasons against
Aristotle’s view that everything above the moon is unchanging. One of
these was the appearance of a new star in 1572, which was found to have
no daily parallax, and must therefore be more distant than the moon. The
other reason was derived from observation of comets, which were also
found to be distant. The reader will remember Aristotle’s doctrine that
change and decay are confined to the sublunary sphere; this, like
everything else that Aristotle said on scientific subjects, proved an
obstacle to progress.</p>
<p>The importance of Tycho Brahe was not as a theorist, but as an
observer, first under the patronage of the king of Denmark, then under
the Emperor Rudolf II. He made a star catalogue, and noted the positions
of the planets throughout many years. Towards the end of his life
Kepler, then a young man, became his assistant. To Kepler his
observations were invaluable.</p>
<p>Kepler (1571–1630) is one of the most notable examples of what can be
achieved by patience without much in the way of genius. He was the first
important astronomer after Copernicus to adopt the heliocentric theory,
but Tycho Brahe’s data showed that it could not be quite right in the
form given to it by Copernicus. He was influenced by Pythagoreanism, and
more or less fancifully inclined to sun-worship, though a good
Protestant. These motives no doubt gave him a bias in favour of the
heliocentric hypothesis. His Pythagoreanism also inclined him to follow
Plato’s Timaeus in supposing that cosmic significance must attach to the
five regular solids. He used them to suggest hypotheses to his mind; at
last, by good luck, one of these worked.</p>
<p>Kepler’s great achievement was the discovery of his three laws of
planetary motion. Two of these he published in 1609, and the third in
1619. His first law states: The planets describe elliptic orbits, of
which the sun occupies one focus. His second law states: The line
joining a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. His
third law states: The square of the period of revolution of a planet is
proportional to the cube of its average distance from the sun.</p>
<p>Something must be said in explanation of the importance of these
laws.</p>
<p>The first two laws, in Kepler’s time, could only be proved in the
case of Mars; as regards the other planets, the observations were
compatible with them, but not such as to establish them definitely. It
was not long, however, before decisive confirmation was found.</p>
<p>The discovery of the first law, that the planets move in ellipses,
required a greater effort of emancipation from tradition than a modern
man can easily realize. The one thing upon which all astronomers,
without exception, had been agreed, was that all celestial motions are
circular, or compounded of circular motions. Where circles were found
inadequate to explain planetary motions, epicycles were used. An
epicycle is the curve traced by a point on a circle which rolls on
another circle. For example: take a big wheel and fasten it flat on the
ground; take a smaller wheel (also flat on the ground) which has a nail
through it, and roll the smaller wheel round the big wheel, with the
point of the nail touching the ground. Then the mark of the nail in the
ground will trace out an epicycle. The orbit of the moon, in relation to
the sun, is roughly of this kind: approximately, the earth describes a
circle round the sun, and the moon meanwhile describes a circle round
the earth. But this is only an approximation. As observation grew more
exact, it was found that no system of epicycles would exactly fit the
facts. Kepler’s hypothesis, he found, was far more closely in accord
with the recorded positions of Mars than was that of Ptolemy, or even
that of Copernicus.</p>
<p>The substitution of ellipses for circles involved the abandonment of
the æsthetic bias which had governed astronomy ever since Pythagoras.
The circle was a perfect figure, and the celestial orbs were perfect
bodies—originally gods, and even in Plato and Aristotle closely related
to gods. It seemed obvious that a perfect body must move in a perfect
figure. Moreover, since the heavenly bodies move freely, without being
pushed or pulled, their motion must be ‘natural’. Now it was easy to
suppose that there is something ‘natural’ about a circle, but not about
an ellipse. Thus many deep-seated prejudices had to be discarded before
Kepler’s first law could be accepted. No ancient, not even Aristarchus
of Samos, had anticipated such an hypothesis.</p>
<p>The second law deals with the varying velocity of the planet at
different points of its orbit. If S is the sun, and P1, P2 P3, P4 P5 are
successive positions of the planet at equal intervals of time—say at
intervals of a month—then Kepler’s law states that the areas P1SP2,
P2SP3, P3SP4, P4SP5 are all equal. The planet, therefore moves fastest
when it is nearest to the sun, and slowest when it is farthest from it.
This, again, was shocking; a planet ought to be too stately to hurry at
one time and dawdle at another.</p>
<p>The third law was important because it compared the movements of
different planets, whereas the first two laws dealt with the several
planets singly. The third law says: If r is the average distance of a
planet from the sun, and T is the length of its year, then r3 divided by
T2 is the same for all the different planets. This law afforded the
proof (as far as the solar system is concerned) of Newton’s law of the
inverse square for gravitation. But of this we shall speak later.</p>
<p>Galileo (1564–1642) is the greatest of the founders of modern
science, with the possible exception of Newton. He was born on about the
day on which Michelangelo died, and he died in the year in which Newton
was born. I commend these facts to those (if any) who still believe in
metempsychosis. He is important as an astronomer, but perhaps even more
as the founder of dynamics.</p>
<p>Galileo first discovered the importance of acceleration in dynamics.
‘Acceleration’ means change of velocity, whether in magnitude or
direction; thus a body moving uniformly in a circle has at all times an
acceleration towards the centre of the circle. In the language that had
been customary before this time, we might say that he treated uniform
motion in a straight line as alone ‘natural’, whether on earth or in the
heavens. It had been thought ‘natural’ for heavenly bodies to move in
circles, and for terrestrial bodies to move in straight lines; but
moving terrestrial bodies, it was thought, would gradually cease to move
if they were let alone. Galileo held, as against this view, that every
body, if left alone, will continue to move in a straight line with
uniform velocity; any change, either in the rapidity or the direction of
motion, requires to be explained as due to the action of some ‘force’.
This principle was enunciated by Newton as the ‘first law of motion’. It
is also called the law of inertia. I shall return to its purport later,
but first something must be said as to the detail of Galileo’s
discoveries.</p>
<p>Galileo was the first to establish the law of falling bodies. This
law, given the concept of ‘acceleration’, is of the utmost simplicity.
It says that, when a body is falling freely, its acceleration is
constant, except in so far as the resistance of the air may interfere;
further, the acceleration is the same for all bodies, heavy or light,
great or small. The complete proof of this law was not possible until
the air pump had been invented, which was about 1654. After this, it was
possible to observe bodies falling in what was practically a vacuum, and
it was found that feathers fell as fast as lead. What Galileo proved was
that there is no measurable difference between large and small lumps of
the same substance. Until his time it had been supposed that a large
lump of lead would fall much quicker than a small one, but Galileo
proved by experiment that this is not the case. Measurement, in his day,
was not such an accurate business as it has since become; nevertheless
he arrived at the true law of falling bodies. If a body is falling
freely in a vacuum, its velocity increases at a constant rate. At the
end of the first second, its velocity will be 32 feet per second; at the
end of another second, 64 feet per second; at the end of the third, 96
feet per second; and so on. The acceleration, i.e. the rate at which the
velocity increases, is always the same; in each second, the increase of
velocity is (approximately) 32 feet per second.</p>
<p>Galileo also studied projectiles, a subject of importance to his
employer, the duke of Tuscany. It had been thought that a projectile
fired horizontally will move horizontally for a while, and then suddenly
begin to fall vertically. Galileo showed that, apart from the resistance
of the air, the horizontal velocity would remain constant, in accordance
with the law of inertia, but a vertical velocity would be added, which
would grow according to the law of falling bodies. To find out how the
projectile will move during some short time, say a second, after it has
been in flight for some time, we proceed as follows: First, if it were
not falling, it would cover a certain horizontal distance, equal to that
which it covered in the first second of its flight. Second, if it were
not moving horizontally, but merely falling, it would fall vertically
with a velocity proportional to the time since the flight began. In
fact, its change of place is what it would be if it first moved
horizontally for a second with the initial velocity, and then fell
vertically for a second with a velocity proportional to the time during
which it has been in flight. A simple calculation shows that its
consequent course is a parabola, and this is confirmed by observation
except in so far as the resistance of the air interferes.</p>
<p>The above gives a simple instance of a principle which proved
immensely fruitful in dynamics, the principle that, when several forces
act simultaneously, the effect is as if each acted in turn. This is part
of a more general principle called the parallelogram law. Suppose, for
example, that you are on the deck of a moving ship, and you walk across
the deck. While you are walking the ship has moved on, so that, in
relation to the water, you have moved both forward and across the
direction of the ship’s motion. If you want to know where you will have
got to in relation to the water, you may suppose that first you stood
still while the ship moved, and then, for an equal time, the ship stood
still while you walked across it. The same principle applies to forces.
This makes it possible to work out the total effect of a number of
forces, and makes it feasible to analyse physical phenomena, discovering
the separate laws of the several forces to which moving bodies are
subject. It was Galileo who introduced this immensely fruitful
method.</p>
<p>In what I have been saying, I have tried to speak, as nearly as
possible, in the language of the seventeenth century. Modern language is
different in important respects, but to explain what the seventeenth
century achieved it is desirable to adopt its modes of expression for
the time being.</p>
<p>The law of inertia explained a puzzle which, before Galileo, the
Copernican system had been unable to explain. As observed above, if you
drop a stone from the top of a tower, it will fall at the foot of the
tower, not somewhat to the west of it; yet, if the earth is rotating, it
ought to have slipped away a certain distance during the fall of the
stone. The reason this does not happen is that the stone retains the
velocity of rotation which, before being dropped, it shared with
everything else on the earth’s surface. In fact, if the tower were high
enough, there would be the opposite effect to that expected by the
opponents of Copernicus. The top of the tower, being further from the
centre of the earth than the bottom, is moving faster, and therefore the
stone should fall slightly to the east of the foot of the tower. This
effect, however, would be too slight to be measurable.</p>
<p>Galileo ardently adopted the heliocentric system; he corresponded
with Kepler, and accepted his discoveries. Having heard that a Dutchman
had lately invented a telescope, Galileo made one himself, and very
quickly discovered a number of important things. He found that the Milky
Way consists of a multitude of separate stars. He observed the phases of
Venus, which Copernicus knew to be implied by his theory, but which the
naked eye was unable to perceive. He discovered the satellites of
Jupiter, which, in honour of his employer, he called ‘sidera medicea’.
It was found that these satellites obey Kepler’s laws. There was,
however, a difficulty. There had always been seven heavenly bodies, the
five planets and the sun and moon; now seven is a sacred number. Is not
the Sabbath the seventh day? Were there not the seven-branched
candlesticks and the seven churches of Asia? What, then, could be more
appropriate than that there should be seven heavenly bodies? But if we
have to add Jupiter’s four moons, that makes eleven—a number which has
no mystic properties. On this ground the traditionalists denounced the
telescope, refused to look through it, and maintained that it revealed
only delusions. Galileo wrote to Kepler wishing they could have a good
laugh together at the stupidity of ‘the mob’; the rest of his letter
makes it plain that ‘the mob’ consisted of the professors of philosophy,
who tried to conjure away Jupiter’s moons, using ‘logic-chopping
arguments as though they were magical incantations’.</p>
<p>Galileo, as everyone knows, was condemned by the Inquisition, first
privately in 1616, and then publicly in 1633, on which latter occasion
he recanted, and promised never again to maintain that the earth rotates
or revolves. The Inquisition was successful in putting an end to science
in Italy, which did not revive there for centuries. But it failed to
prevent men of science from adopting the heliocentric theory, and did
considerable damage to the Church by its stupidity. Fortunately there
were Protestant countries, where the clergy, however anxious to do harm
to science, were unable to gain control of the State.</p>
<p>Newton (1642–1727) achieved the final and complete triumph for which
Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo had prepared the way. Starting from his
three laws of motion—of which the first two are due to Galileo—he proved
that Kepler’s three laws are equivalent to the proposition that every
planet, at every moment, has an acceleration towards the sun which
varies inversely as the square of the distance from the sun. He showed
that acceleration towards the earth and sun, following the same formula,
explains the moon’s motion, and that the acceleration of falling bodies
on the earth’s surface is again related to that of the moon according to
the inverse square law. He defined ‘force’ as the cause of change of
motion, i.e. of acceleration. He was thus able to enunciate his law of
universal gravitation: ‘Every body attracts every other with a force
directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them.’ From this
formula he was able to deduce everything in planetary theory: the
motions of the planets and their satellites, the orbits of comets, the
tides. It appeared later that even the minute departures from elliptical
orbits on the part of the planets were deducible from Newton’s law. The
triumph was so complete that Newton was in danger of becoming another
Aristotle, and imposing an insuperable barrier to progress. In England,
it was not till a century after his death that men freed themselves from
his authority sufficiently to do important original work in the subjects
of which he had treated.</p>
<p>The seventeenth century was remarkable, not only in astronomy and
dynamics, but in many other ways connected with science.</p>
<p>Take first the question of scientific instruments.2 The compound
microscope was invented just before the seventeenth century, about 1590.
The telescope was invented in 1608, by a Dutchman named Lippershey,
though it was Galileo who first made serious use of it for scientific
purposes. Galileo also invented the thermometer—at least, this seems
most probable. His pupil Torricelli invented the barometer. Guericke
(1602–86) invented the air pump. Clocks, though not new, were greatly
improved in the seventeenth</p>
<p>century, largely by the work of Galileo. Owing to these inventions,
scientific observation became immensely more exact and more extensive
than it had been at any former time.</p>
<p>Next, there was important work in other sciences than astronomy and
dynamics. Gilbert (1540–1603) published his great book on the magnet in
1600. Harvey (1578–1657) discovered the circulation of the blood, and
published his discovery in 1628. Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) discovered
spermatozoa, though another man, Stephen Hamm, had discovered them,
apparently, a few months earlier; Leeuwenhoek also discovered protozoa
or unicellular organisms, and even bacteria. Robert Boyle (1627–91) was,
as children were taught when I was young, ‘the father of chemistry and
son of the Earl of Cork’; he is now chiefly remembered on account of
‘Boyle’s Law’, that in a given quantity of gas at a given temperature,
pressure is inversely proportional to volume.</p>
<p>I have hitherto said nothing of the advances in pure mathematics, but
these were very great indeed, and were indispensable to much of the work
in the physical sciences. Napier published his invention of logarithms
in 1614. Co-ordinate geometry resulted from the work of several
seventeenth-century mathematicians, among whom the greatest contribution
was made by Descartes. The differential and integral calculus was
invented independently by Newton and Leibniz; it is the instrument for
almost all higher mathematics. These are only the most outstanding
achievements in pure mathematics; there were innumerable others of great
importance.</p>
<p>The result of the scientific work we have been considering was that
the outlook of educated men was completely transformed. At the beginning
of the century, Sir Thomas Browne took part in trials for witchcraft; at
the end, such a thing would have been impossible. In Shakespeare’s time,
comets were still portents; after the publication of Newton’s Principia
in 1687, it was known that he and Halley had calculated the orbits of
certain comets, and that they were as obedient as the planets to the law
of gravitation. The reign of law had established its hold on men’s
imaginations, making such things as magic and sorcery incredible. In
1700 the mental outlook of educated men was completely modern; in 1600,
except among a very few, it was still largely medieval.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this chapter I shall try to state briefly the
philosophical beliefs which appeared to follow from seventeenth-century
science, and some of the respects in which modern science differs from
that of Newton.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is the removal of almost all traces of
animism from the laws of physics. The Greeks, though they did not say so
explicitly, evidently considered the power of movement a sign of life.
To common-sense observation it seems that animals move themselves, while
dead matter only moves when impelled by an external force. The soul of
an animal, in Aristotle, has various functions, and one of them is to
move the animal’s body. The sun and planets, in Greek thinking, are apt
to be gods, or at least regulated and moved by gods. Anaxagoras thought
otherwise, but was impious. Democritus thought otherwise, but was
neglected, except by the Epicureans, in favour of Plato and Aristotle.
Aristotle’s forty-seven or fifty-five unmoved movers are divine spirits,
and are the ultimate source of all the motion in the heavens. Left to
itself, any inanimate body would soon become motionless; thus the
operation of soul on matter has to be continuous if motion is not to
cease.</p>
<p>All this was changed by the first law of motion. Lifeless matter,
once set moving, will continue to move for ever unless stopped by some
external cause. Moreover the external causes of change of motion turned
out to be themselves material, whenever they could be definitely
ascertained. The solar system, at any rate, was kept going by its own
momentum and its own laws; no outside interference was needed. There
might still seem to be need of God to set the mechanism working; the
planets, according to Newton, were originally hurled by the hand of God.
But when He had done this, and decreed the law of gravitation,
everything went on by itself without further need of divine
intervention. When Laplace suggested that the same forces which are now
operative might have caused the planets to grow out of the sun, God’s
share in the course of nature was pushed still further back. He might
remain as Creator, but even that was doubtful, since it was not clear
that the world had a beginning in time. Although most of the men of
science were models of piety, the outlook suggested by their work was
disturbing to orthodoxy, and the theologians were quite justified in
feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Another thing that resulted from science was a profound change in the
conception of man’s place in the universe. In the medieval world, the
earth was the centre of the heavens, and everything had a purpose
concerned with man. In the Newtonian world, the earth was a minor planet
of a not specially distinguished star; astronomical distances were so
vast that the earth, in comparison, was a mere pin-point. It seemed
unlikely that this immense apparatus was all designed for the good of
certain small creatures on this pin-point. Moreover purpose, which had
since Aristotle formed an intimate part of the conception of science,
was now thrust out of scientific procedure. Anyone might still believe
that the heavens exist to declare the glory of God, but no one could let
this belief intervene in an astronomical calculation. The world might
have a purpose, but purposes could no longer enter into scientific
explanations.</p>
<p>The Copernican theory should have been humbling to human pride, but
in fact the contrary effect was produced, for the triumphs of science
revived human pride. The dying ancient world had been obsessed with a
sense of sin, and had bequeathed this as an oppression to the Middle
Ages. To be humble before God was both right and prudent, for God would
punish pride. Pestilences, floods, earthquakes, Turks, Tartars, and
comets perplexed the gloomy centuries, and it was felt that only greater
and greater humility would avert these real or threatened calamities.
But it became impossible to remain humble when men were achieving such
triumphs:</p>
<p>Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night.</p>
<p>God said ‘Let Newton be’, and all was light.</p>
<p>And as for damnation, surely the Creator of so vast a universe had
something better to think about than sending men to hell for minute
theological errors. Judas Iscariot might be damned, but not Newton,
though he were an Arian.</p>
<p>There were of course many other reasons for self-satisfaction. The
Tartars had been confined to Asia, and the Turks were ceasing to be a
menace. Comets had been humbled by Halley, and as for earthquakes,
though they were still formidable, they were so interesting that men of
science could hardly regret them. Western Europeans were growing rapidly
richer, and were becoming lords of all the world: they had conquered
North and South America, they were powerful in Africa and India,
respected in China and feared in Japan. When to all this were added the
triumphs of science, it is no wonder that the men of the seventeenth
century felt themselves to be fine fellows, not the miserable sinners
that they still proclaimed themselves on Sundays.</p>
<p>There are some respects in which the concepts of modern theoretical
physics differ from those of the Newtonian system. To begin with, the
conception of ‘force’, which is prominent in the seventeenth century,
has been found to be superfluous. ‘Force’, in Newton, is the cause of
change of motion, whether in magnitude or direction. The notion of cause
is regarded as important, and force is conceived imaginatively as the
sort of thing that we experience when we push or pull. For this reason
it was considered an objection to gravitation that it acted at a
distance, and Newton himself conceded that there must be some medium by
which it was transmitted. Gradually it was found that all the equations
could be written down without bringing in forces. What was observable
was a certain relation between acceleration and configuration; to say
that this relation was brought about by the intermediacy of ‘force’ was
to add nothing to our knowledge. Observation shows that planets have at
all times an acceleration towards the sun, which varies inversely as the
square of their distance from it. To say that this is due to the ‘force’
of gravitation is merely verbal, like saying that opium makes people
sleep because it has a dormitive virtue. The modern physicist,
therefore, merely states formulae which determine accelerations, and
avoids the word ‘force’ altogether. ‘Force’ was the faint ghost of the
vitalist view as to the causes of motions, and gradually the ghost has
been exorcized.</p>
<p>Until the coming of quantum mechanics, nothing happened to modify in
any degree what is the essential purport of the first two laws of
motion, namely this: that the laws of dynamics are to be stated in terms
of accelerations. In this respect, Copernicus and Kepler are still to be
classed with the ancients; they sought laws stating the shapes of the
orbits of the heavenly bodies. Newton made it clear that laws stated in
this form could never be more than approximate. The planets do not move
in exact ellipses, because of the perturbations caused by the
attractions of other planets. Nor is the orbit of a planet ever exactly
repeated, for the same reason. But the law of gravitation, which dealt
with accelerations, was very simple, and was thought to be quite exact
until two hundred years after Newton’s time. When it was amended by
Einstein, it still remained a law dealing with accelerations.</p>
<p>It is true that the conservation of energy is a law dealing with
velocities, not accelerations. But in calculations which use this law it
is still accelerations that have to be employed.</p>
<p>As for the changes introduced by quantum mechanics, they are very
profound, but still, to some degree, a matter of controversy and
uncertainty.</p>
<p>There is one change from the Newtonian philosophy which must be
mentioned now, and that is the abandonment of absolute space and time.
The reader will remember a mention of this question in connection with
Democritus. Newton believed in a space composed of points, and a time
composed of instants, which had an existence independent of the bodies
and events that occupied them. As regards space, he had an empirical
argument to support his view, namely that physical phenomena enable us
to distinguish absolute rotation. If the water in a bucket is rotated,
it climbs up the sides and is depressed in the centre; but if the bucket
is rotated while the water is not, there is no such effect. Since his
day, the experiment of Foucault’s pendulum has been devised, giving what
has been considered a demonstration of the earth’s rotation. Even on the
most modern views, the question of absolute rotation presents
difficulties. If all motion is relative, the difference between the
hypothesis that the earth rotates and the hypothesis that the heavens
revolve is purely verbal; it is no more than the difference between
‘John is the father of James’ and ‘James is the son of John’. But if the
heavens revolve, the stars move faster than light, which is considered
impossible. It cannot be said that the modern answers to this difficulty
are completely satisfying, but they are sufficiently satisfying to cause
almost all physicists to accept the view that motion and space are
purely relative. This, combined with the amalgamation of space and time
into space-time, has considerably altered our view of the universe from
that which resulted from the work of Galileo and Newton. But of this, as
of quantum theory, I will say no more at this time.</p>
