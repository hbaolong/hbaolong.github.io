<h4 id="machiavelli">3 MACHIAVELLI</h4>
<p>The Renaissance, though it produced no important theoretical
philosopher, produced one man of supreme eminence in political
philosophy: Niccolò Machiavelli. It is the custom to be shocked by him,
and he certainly is sometimes shocking. But many other men would be
equally so if they were equally free from humbug. His political
philosophy is scientific and empirical, based upon his own experience of
affairs, concerned to set forth the means to assigned ends, regardless
of the question whether the ends are to be considered good or bad. When,
on occasion, he allows himself to mention the ends that he desires, they
are such as we can all applaud. Much of the conventional obloquy that
attaches to his name is due to the indignation of hypocrites who hate
the frank avowal of evil-doing. There remains, it is true, a good deal
that genuinely demands criticism, but in this he is an expression of his
age. Such intellectual honesty about political dishonesty would have
been hardly possible at any other time or in any other country, except
perhaps in Greece among men who owed their theoretical education to the
sophists and their practical training to the wars of petty states which,
in classical Greece as in Renaissance Italy, were the political
accompaniment of individual genius.</p>
<p>Machiavelli (1467–1527) was a Florentine, whose father, a lawyer, was
neither rich nor poor. When he was in his twenties, Savonarola dominated
Florence; his miserable end evidently made a great impression on
Machiavelli, for he remarks that ‘all armed prophets have conquered and
unarmed ones failed’, proceeding to give Savonarola as an instance of
the latter class. On the other side he mentions Moses, Cyrus, Theseus,
and Romulus. It is typical of the Renaissance that Christ is not
mentioned.</p>
<p>Immediately after Savonarola’s execution, Machiavelli obtained a
minor post in the Florentine government (1498). He remained in its
service, at times on important diplomatic missions, until the
restoration of the Medici in 1512; then, having always opposed them, he
was arrested, but acquitted, and allowed to live in retirement in the
country near Florence. He became an author for want of other occupation.
His most famous work, The Prince, was written in 1513, and dedicated to
Lorenzo the Second, since he hoped (vainly, as it proved) to win the
favour of the Medici. Its tone is perhaps partly due to this practical
purpose; his longer work, the Discourses, which he was writing at the
same time, is markedly more republican and more liberal. He says at the
beginning of The Prince that he will not speak of republics in this
book, since he has dealt with them elsewhere. Those who do not read also
the Discourses are likely to get a very one-sided view of his
doctrine.</p>
<p>Having failed to conciliate the Medici, Machiavelli was compelled to
go on writing. He lived in retirement until the year of his death, which
was that of the sack of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This year may
be reckoned also that in which the Italian Renaissance died.</p>
<p>The Prince is concerned to discover, from history and from
contemporary events, how principalities are won, how they are held, and
how they are lost. Fifteenth-century Italy afforded a multitude of
examples, both great and small. Few rulers were legitimate; even the
popes, in many cases, secured election by corrupt means. The rules for
achieving success were not quite the same as they became when times grew
more settled, for no one was shocked by cruelties and treacheries which
would have disqualified a man in the eighteenth or the nineteenth
century. Perhaps our age, again, can better appreciate Machiavelli, for
some of the most notable successes of our time have been achieved by
methods as base as any employed in Renaissance Italy. He would have
applauded, as an artistic connoisseur in statecraft, Hitler’s Reichstag
fire, his purge of the party in 1934, and his breach of faith after
Munich.</p>
<p>Caesar Borgia, son of Alexander VI, comes in for high praise. His
problem was a difficult one: first, by the death of his brother, to
become the sole beneficiary of his father’s dynastic ambition; second,
to conquer by force of arms, in the name of the Pope, territories which
should, after Alexander’s death, belong to himself and not to the Papal
States; third, to manipulate the College of Cardinals so that the next
Pope should be his friend. He pursued this difficult end with great
skill; from his practice, Machiavelli says, a new prince should derive
precepts. Caesar failed, it is true, but only ‘by the extraordinary
malignity of fortune’. It happened that, when his father died, he also
was dangerously ill; by the time he recovered, his enemies had organized
their forces, and his bitterest opponent had been elected Pope. On the
day of this election, Caesar told Machiavelli that he had provided for
everything, ‘except that he had never thought that at his father’s death
he would be dying himself’.</p>
<p>Machiavelli, who was intimately acquainted with his villainies, sums
up thus: ‘Reviewing thus all the actions of the duke [Caesar], I find
nothing to blame, on the contrary, I feel bound, as I have done, to hold
him as an example to be imitated by all who by fortune and with the arms
of others have risen to power.’</p>
<p>There is an interesting chapter ‘Of Ecclesiastical Principalities’,
which, in view of what is said in the Discourses, evidently conceals
part of Machiavelli’s thought. The reason for concealment was, no doubt,
that The Prince was designed to please the Medici, and that, when it was
written, a Medici had just become Pope (Leo X). In regard to
ecclesiastical principalities, he says in The Prince, the only
difficulty is to acquire them, for, when acquired, they are defended by
ancient religious customs, which keep their princes in power no matter
how they behave. Their princes do not need armies (so he says), because
‘they are upheld by higher causes which the human mind cannot attain
to’. They are ‘exalted and maintained by God’, and ‘it would be the work
of a presumptuous and foolish man to discuss them’. Nevertheless, he
continues, it is permissible to inquire by what means Alexander VI so
greatly increased the temporal power of the Pope.</p>
<p>The discussion of the papal powers in the Discourses is longer and
more sincere. Here he begins by placing eminent men in an ethical
hierarchy. The best, he says, are the founders of religions; then come
the founders of monarchies or republics; then literary men. These are
good, but destroyers of religions, subverters of republics or kingdoms,
and enemies of virtue or of letters, are bad. Those who establish
tyrannies are wicked, including Julius Caesar; on the other hand, Brutus
was good. (The contrast between this view and Dante’s shows the effect
of classical literature.) He holds that religion should have a prominent
place in the State, not on the ground of its truth, but as a social
cement: the Romans were right to pretend to believe in auguries, and to
punish those who disregarded them. His criticisms of the Church in his
day are two: that by its evil conduct it has undermined religious
belief, and that the temporal power of the popes, with the policy that
it inspires, prevents the unification of Italy. These criticisms are
expressed with great vigour. ’The nearer people are to the Church of
Rome, which is the head of our religion, the less religious are they….
Her ruin and chastisement is near at hand…. We Italians owe to the
Church of Rome and to her priests our having become irreligious and bad;
but we owe her a still greater debt, and one that will be the cause of
our ruin, namely that the Church has kept and still keeps our country
divided.’1</p>
<p>In view of such passages, it must be supposed that Machiavelli’s
admiration of Caesar Borgia was only for his skill, not for his
purposes. Admiration of skill,</p>
<p>and of the actions that lead to fame, was very great at the time of
the Renaissance. This kind of feeling has, of course, always existed;
many of Napoleon’s enemies enthusiastically admired him as a military
strategist. But in the Italy of Machiavelli’s time the quasi-artistic
admiration of dexterity was much greater than in earlier or later
centuries. It would be a mistake to try to reconcile it with the larger
political aims which Machiavelli considered important; the two things,
love of skill and patriotic desire for Italian unity, existed side by
side in his mind, and were not in any degree synthesized. Thus he can
praise Caesar Borgia for his cleverness, and blame him for keeping Italy
disrupted. The perfect character, one must suppose, would be, in his
opinion, a man as clever and unscrupulous as Caesar Borgia where means
are concerned, but aiming at a different end. The Prince ends with an
eloquent appeal to the Medici to liberate Italy from the ‘barbarians’
(i.e. the French and Spaniards), whose domination ‘stinks’. He would not
expect such a work to be undertaken from unselfish motives, but from
love of power, and still more of fame.</p>
<p>The Prince is very explicit in repudiating received morality where
the conduct of rulers is concerned. A ruler will perish if he is always
good; he must be as cunning as a fox and as fierce as a lion. There is a
chapter (XVIII) entitled: ‘In What Way Princes Must Keep Faith.’ We
learn that they should keep faith when it pays to do so, but not
otherwise. A prince must on occasion be faithless.</p>
<p>‘But it is necessary to be able to disguise this character well, and
to be a great feigner and dissembler; and men are so simple and so ready
to obey present necessities, that one who deceives will always find
those who allow themselves to be deceived. I will mention only one
modern instance. Alexander VI did nothing else but deceive men, he
thought of nothing else, and found the occasion for it; no man was ever
more able to give assurances, or affirmed things with stronger oaths,
and no man observed them less; however, he always succeeded in his
deceptions, as he knew well this aspect of things. It is not necessary
therefore for a prince to have all the above-named qualities [the
conventional virtues], but it is very necessary to seem to have
them.’</p>
<p>He goes on to say that, above all, a prince should seem to be
religious.</p>
<p>The tone of the Discourses, which are nominally a commentary on Livy,
is very different. There are whole chapters which seem almost as if they
had been written by Montesquieu; most of the book could have been read
with approval by an eighteenth-century liberal. The doctrine of checks
and balances is set forth explicitly. Princes, nobles, and people should
all have a part in the Constitution; ‘then these three powers will keep
each other reciprocally in check’. The constitution of Sparta, as
established by Lycurgus, was the best, because it embodied the most
perfect balance; that of Solon was too democratic, and therefore led to
the tyranny of Peisistratus. The Roman republican constitution was good,
owing to the conflict of Senate and people.</p>
<p>The word ‘liberty’ is used throughout as denoting something precious,
though what it denotes is not very clear. This, of course, comes from
antiquity, and was passed on to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Tuscany has preserved its liberties, because it contains no castles or
gentlemen. (‘Gentlemen’ is of course a mistranslation, but a pleasing
one.) It seems to be recognized that political liberty requires a
certain kind of personal virtue in the citizens. In Germany alone, we
are told, probity and religion are still common, and therefore in
Germany there are many republics. In general, the people are wiser and
more constant than princes, although Livy and most other writers
maintain the opposite. It is not without good reason that it is said,
‘the voice of the people is the voice of God’.</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe how the political thought of the Greeks
and Romans, in their republican days, acquired an actuality in the
fifteenth century which it had not had in Greece since Alexander or in
Rome since Augustus. The Neoplatonists, the Arabs, and the Schoolmen
took a passionate interest in the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle,
but none at all in their political writings, because the political
systems of the age of City States had completely disappeared. The growth
of City States in Italy synchronized with the revival of learning, and
made it possible for humanists to profit by the political theories of
republican Greeks and Romans. The love of ‘liberty’, and the theory of
checks and balances, came to the Renaissance from antiquity, and to
modern times largely from the Renaissance, though also directly from
antiquity. This aspect of Machiavelli is at least as important as the
more famous ‘immoral’ doctrines of The Prince.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that Machiavelli never bases any political argument
on Christian or biblical grounds. Medieval writers had a conception of
‘legitimate’ power, which was that of the Pope and the Emperor, or
derived from them. Northern writers, even so late as Locke, argue as to
what happened in the Garden of Eden, and think that they can thence
derive proofs that certain kinds of power are ‘legitimate’. In
Machiavelli there is no such conception. Power is for those who have the
skill to seize it in a free competition. His preference for popular
government is not derived from any idea of ‘rights’, but from the
observation that popular governments are less cruel, unscrupulous, and
inconstant than tyrannies.</p>
<p>Let us try to make a synthesis (which Machiavelli himself did not
make) of the ‘moral’ and ‘immoral’ parts of his doctrine. In what
follows, I am expressing not my own opinions, but opinions which are
explicitly or implicitly his.</p>
<p>There are certain political goods, of which three are specially
important: national independence, security, and a well-ordered
constitution. The best constitution is one which apportions legal rights
among prince, nobles, and people in proportion to their real power, for
under such a constitution successful revolutions are difficult and
therefore stability is possible; but for considerations of stability, it
would be wise to give more power to the people. So far as regards
ends.</p>
<p>But there is also, in politics, the question of means. It is futile
to pursue a political purpose by methods that are bound to fail; if the
end is held good, we must choose means adequate to its achievement. The
question of means can be treated in a purely scientific manner, without
regard to the goodness or badness of the ends. ‘Success’ means the
achievement of your purpose, whatever it may be. If there is a science
of success, it can be studied just as well in the successes of the
wicked as in those of the good—indeed better, since the examples of
successful sinners are more numerous than those of successful saints.
But the science, once established, will be just as useful to the saint
as to the sinner. For the saint, if he concerns himself with politics,
must wish, just as the sinner does, to achieve success.</p>
<p>The question is ultimately one of power. To achieve a political end,
power, of one kind or another, is necessary. This plain fact is
concealed by slogans, such as ‘right will prevail’ or ‘the triumph of
evil is short-lived’. If the side that you think right prevails, that is
because it has superior power. It is true that power, often, depends
upon opinion, and opinion upon propaganda; it is true, also, that it is
an advantage in propaganda to seem more virtuous than your adversary,
and that one way of seeming virtuous is to be virtuous. For this reason,
it may sometimes happen that victory goes to the side which has the most
of what the general public considers to be virtue. We must concede to
Machiavelli that this was an important element in the growing power of
the Church during the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, as
well as in the success of the Reformation in the sixteenth century. But
there are important limitations. In the first place, those who have
seized power can, by controlling propaganda, cause their party to appear
virtuous; no one, for example, could mention the sins of Alexander VI in
a New York or Boston public school. In the second place, there are
chaotic periods during which obvious knavery frequently succeeds; the
period of Machiavelli was one of them. In such times, there tends to be
a rapidly growing cynicism, which makes men forgive anything provided it
pays. Even in such times, as Machiavelli himself says, it is desirable
to present an appearance of virtue before the ignorant public.</p>
<p>This question can be carried a step further. Machiavelli is of
opinion that civilized men are almost certain to be unscrupulous
egoists. If a man wished nowadays to establish a republic, he says, he
would find it easier with mountaineers than with the men of a large
city, since the latter would be already corrupted.2 If a man is an
unscrupulous egoist, his wisest line of conduct will</p>
<p>depend upon the population with which he has to operate. The
Renaissance Church shocked everybody, but it was only north of the Alps
that it shocked people enough to produce the Reformation. At the time
when Luther began his revolt, the revenue of the papacy was probably
larger than it would have been if Alexander VI and Julius II had been
more virtuous, and if this is true, it is so because of the cynicism of
Renaissance Italy. It follows that politicians will behave better when
they depend upon a virtuous population than when they depend upon one
which is indifferent to moral considerations; they will also behave
better in a community in which their crimes, if any, can be made widely
known, than in one in which there is a strict censorship under their
control. A certain amount can, of course, always be achieved by
hypocrisy, but the amount can be much diminished by suitable
institutions.</p>
<p>Machiavelli’s political thinking, like that of most of the ancients,
is in one respect somewhat shallow. He is occupied with great lawgivers,
such as Lycurgus and Solon, who are supposed to create a community all
in one piece, with little regard to what has gone before. The conception
of a community as an organic growth, which the statesmen can only affect
to a limited extent, is in the main modern, and has been greatly
strengthened by the theory of evolution. This conception is not to be
found in Machiavelli any more than in Plato.</p>
<p>It might, however, be maintained that the evolutionary view of
society, though true in the past, is no longer applicable, but must, for
the present and the future, be replaced by a much more mechanistic view.
In Russia and Germany new societies have been created, in much the same
way as the mythical Lycurgus was supposed to have created the Spartan
polity. The ancient lawgiver was a benevolent myth; the modern lawgiver
is a terrifying reality. The world has become more like that of
Machiavelli than it was, and the modern man who hopes to refute his
philosophy must think more deeply than seemed necessary in the
nineteenth century.</p>
