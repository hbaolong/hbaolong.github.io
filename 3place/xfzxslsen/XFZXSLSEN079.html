<h4 id="the-philosophy-of-logical-analysis">31 THE PHILOSOPHY OF LOGICAL
ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>In philosophy ever since the time of Pythagoras there has been an
opposition between the men whose thought was mainly inspired by
mathematics and those who were more influenced by the empirical
sciences. Plato, Thomas Aquinas, Spinoza, and Kant belong to what may be
called the mathematical party; Democritus, Aristotle, and the modern
empiricists from Locke onwards, belong to the opposite party. In our day
a school of philosophy has arisen which sets to work to eliminate
Pythagoreanism from the principles of mathematics, and to combine
empiricism with an interest in the deductive parts of human knowledge.
The aims of this school are less spectacular than those of most
philosophers in the past, but some of its achievements are as solid as
those of the men of science.</p>
<p>The origin of this philosophy is in the achievements of
mathematicians who set to work to purge their subject of fallacies and
slipshod reasoning. The great mathematicians of the seventeenth century
were optimistic and anxious for quick results; consequently they left
the foundations of analytical geometry and the infinitesimal calculus
insecure. Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but although this
belief suited his metaphysics it had no sound basis in mathematics.
Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, showed how
to establish the calculus without infinitesimals, and thus at last made
it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of
continuity and infinite number. ‘Continuity’ had been, until he defined
it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to
introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics. Cantor gave a precise
significance to the word, and showed that continuity, as he defined it,
was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists. By this means a
great deal of mysticism, such as that of Bergson, was rendered
antiquated.</p>
<p>Cantor also overcame the long-standing logical puzzles about infinite
number. Take the series of whole numbers from 1 onwards; how many of
them are there? Clearly the number is not finite. Up to a thousand,
there are a thousand numbers; up to a million, a million. Whatever
finite number you mention, there are evidently more numbers than that,
because from 1 up to the number in question there are just that number
of numbers, and then there are others that are greater. The number of
finite whole numbers must, therefore, be an infinite number. But now
comes a curious fact: The number of even numbers must be the same as the
number of all whole numbers. Consider the two rows:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …</p>
<p>2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, …</p>
<p>There is one entry in the lower row for every one in the top row;
therefore the number of terms in the two rows must be the same, although
the lower row consists of only half the terms in the top row. Leibniz,
who noticed this, thought it a contradiction, and concluded that, though
there are infinite collections, there are no infinite numbers. Georg
Cantor, on the contrary, boldly denied that it is a contradiction. He
was right; it is only an oddity.</p>
<p>Georg Cantor defined an ‘infinite’ collection as one which has parts
containing as many terms as the whole collection contains. On this basis
he was able to build up a most interesting mathematical theory of
infinite numbers, thereby taking into the realm of exact logic a whole
region formerly given over to mysticism and confusion.</p>
<p>The next man of importance was Frege, who published his first work in
1879, and his definition of ‘number’ in 1884; but, in spite of the
epoch-making nature of his discoveries, he remained wholly without
recognition until I drew attention to him in 1903. It is remarkable
that, before Frege, every definition of number that had been suggested
contained elementary logical blunders. It was customary to identify
‘number’ with ‘plurality’. But an instance of ‘number’ is a particular
number, say 3, and an instance of 3 is a particular triad. The triad is
a plurality, but the class of all triads—which Frege identified with the
number 3—is a plurality of pluralities, and number in general, of which
3 is an instance, is a plurality of pluralities of pluralities. The
elementary grammatical mistake of confounding this with the simple
plurality of a given triad made the whole philosophy of number, before
Frege, a tissue of nonsense in the strictest sense of the term
‘nonsense’.</p>
<p>From Frege’s work it followed that arithmetic, and pure mathematics
generally, is nothing but a prolongation of deductive logic. This
disproved Kant’s theory that arithmetical propositions are ‘synthetic’
and involve a reference to time. The development of pure mathematics
from logic was set forth in detail in Principia Mathematica, by
Whitehead and myself.</p>
<p>It gradually became clear that a great part of philosophy can be
reduced to something that may be called ‘syntax’, though the word has to
be used in a somewhat wider sense than has hitherto been customary. Some
men, notably Carnap, have advanced the theory that all philosophical
problems are really syntactical, and that, when errors in syntax are
avoided, a philosophical problem is thereby either solved or shown to be
insoluble. I think, and Carnap now agrees, that this is an
overstatement, but there can be no doubt that the utility of
philosophical syntax in relation to traditional problems is very
great.</p>
<p>I will illustrate its utility by a brief explanation of what is
called the theory of descriptions. By a ‘description’ I mean a phrase
such as ‘The present President of the United States’, in which a person
or thing is designated, not by name, but by some property which is
supposed or known to be peculiar to him or it. Such phrases had given a
lot of trouble. Suppose I say, ‘The golden mountain does not exist’, and
suppose you ask ‘What is it that does not exist?’ It would seem that, if
I say ‘It is the golden mountain,’ I am attributing some sort of
existence to it. Obviously I am not making the same statement as if I
said, ‘The round square does not exist.’ This seemed to imply that the
golden mountain is one thing and the round square is another, although
neither exists. The theory of descriptions was designed to meet this and
other difficulties.</p>
<p>According to this theory, when a statement containing a phrase of the
form ‘the so-and-so’ is rightly analysed, the phrase ‘the so-and-so’
disappears. For example, take the statement ‘Scott was the author of
Waverley.’ The theory interprets this statement as saying</p>
<p>‘One and only one man wrote Waverley, and that man was Scott.’ Or,
more fully:</p>
<p>‘There is an entity c such that the statement “x wrote Waverley“ is
true if x is c and false otherwise; moreover c is Scott.’</p>
<p>The first part of this, before the word ‘moreover’, is defined as
meaning: ‘The author of Waverley exists (or existed or will exist).’
Thus ‘The golden mountain does not exist’ means:</p>
<p>‘There is no entity c such that “x is golden and mountainous“ is true
when x is c, but not otherwise.’</p>
<p>With this definition the puzzle as to what is meant when we say ‘The
golden mountain does not exist’ disappears.</p>
<p>‘Existence,’ according to this theory, can only be asserted of
descriptions. We can say ‘The author of Waverley exists,’ but to say
‘Scott exists’ is bad grammar, or rather bad syntax. This clears up two
millennia of muddle-headedness about ‘existence’, beginning with Plato’s
Theaetetus.</p>
<p>One result of the work we have been considering is to dethrone
mathematics from the lofty place that it has occupied since Pythagoras
and Plato, and to destroy the presumption against empiricism which has
been derived from it. Mathematical knowledge, it is true, is not
obtained by induction from experience; our reason for believing that 2
and 2 are 4 is not that we have so often found, by observation, that one
couple and another couple together make a quartet. In this sense,
mathematical knowledge is still not empirical. But it is also not a
priori knowledge about the world. It is, in fact, merely verbal
knowledge. ‘3’ means ‘2 + 1’, and ‘4’ means ‘3 + 1’. Hence it follows
(though the proof is long) that ‘4’ means the same as ‘2 + 2’. Thus
mathematical knowledge ceases to be mysterious. It is all of the same
nature as the ‘great truth’ that there are three feet in a yard.</p>
<p>Physics, as well as pure mathematics, has supplied material for the
philosophy of logical analysis. This has occurred especially through the
theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>What is important to the philosopher in the theory of relativity is
the substitution of space-time for space and time. Common sense thinks
of the physical world as composed of ‘things’ which persist through a
certain period of time and move in space. Philosophy and physics
developed the notion of ‘thing’ into that of ‘material substance’, and
thought of material substance as consisting of particles, each very
small, and each persisting throughout all time. Einstein substituted
events for particles; each event had to each other a relation called
‘interval’, which could be analysed in various ways into a time-element
and a space-element. The choice between these various ways was
arbitrary, and no one of them was theoretically preferable to any other.
Given two events A and B, in different regions, it might happen that
according to one convention they were simultaneous, according to another
A was earlier than B, and according to yet another B was earlier than A.
No physical facts correspond to these different conventions.</p>
<p>From all this it seems to follow that events, not particles, must be
the ‘stuff’ of physics. What has been thought of as a particle will have
to be thought of as a series of events. The series of events that
replaces a particle has certain important physical properties, and
therefore demands our attention; but it has no more substantiality than
any other series of events that we might arbitrarily single out. Thus
‘matter’ is not part of the ultimate material of the world, but merely a
convenient way of collecting events into bundles.</p>
<p>Quantum theory reinforces this conclusion, but its chief
philosophical importance is that it regards physical phenomena as
possibly discontinuous. It suggests that, in an atom (interpreted as
above), a certain state of affairs persists for a certain time, and then
suddenly is replaced by a finitely different state of affairs.
Continuity of motion, which had always been assumed, appears to have
been a mere prejudice. The philosophy appropriate to quantum theory,
however, has not yet been adequately developed. I suspect that it will
demand even more radical departures from the traditional doctrine of
space and time than those demanded by the theory of relativity.</p>
<p>While physics has been making matter less material, psychology has
been making mind less mental. We had occasion in a former chapter to
compare the association of ideas with the conditioned reflex. The
latter, which has replaced the former, is obviously much more
physiological. (This is only one illustration; I do not wish to
exaggerate the scope of the conditioned reflex.) Thus from both ends
physics and psychology have been approaching each other, and making more
possible the doctrine of ‘neutral monism’ suggested by William James’s
criticism of ‘consciousness’. The distinction of mind and matter came
into philosophy from religion, although, for a long time, it seemed to
have valid grounds. I think that both mind and matter are merely
convenient ways of grouping events. Some single events, I should admit,
belong only to material groups, but others belong to both kinds of
groups, and are therefore at once mental and material. This doctrine
effects a great simplification in our picture of the structure of the
world.</p>
<p>Modern physics and physiology throw a new light upon the ancient
problem of perception. If there is to be anything that can be called
‘perception’, it must be in some degree an effect of the object
perceived, and it must more or less resemble the object if it is to be a
source of knowledge of the object. The first requisite can only be
fulfilled if there are causal chains which are, to a greater or less
extent, independent of the rest of the world. According to physics, this
is the case. Light-waves travel from the sun to the earth, and in doing
so obey their own laws. This is only roughly true. Einstein has shown
that light-rays are affected by gravitation. When they reach our
atmosphere, they suffer refraction, and some are more scattered than
others. When they reach a human eye, all sorts of things happen which
would not happen elsewhere, ending up with what we call ‘seeing the
sun’. But although the sun of our visual experience is very different
from the sun of the astronomer, it is still a source of knowledge as to
the latter, because ‘seeing the sun’ differs from ‘seeing the moon’ in
ways that are causally connected with the difference between the
astronomer’s sun and the astronomer’s moon. What we can know of physical
objects in this way, however, is only certain abstract properties of
structure. We can know that the sun is round in a sense, though not
quite the sense in which what we see is round; but we have no reason to
suppose that it is bright or warm, because physics can account for its
seeming so without supposing that it is so. Our knowledge of the
physical world, therefore, is only abstract and mathematical.</p>
<p>Modern analytical empiricism, of which I have been giving an outline,
differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume by its incorporation of
mathematics and its development of a powerful logical technique. It is
thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite answers,
which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has the
advantage, as compared with the philosophies of the system-builders, of
being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to
invent at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods,
in this respect, resemble those of science. I have no doubt that, in so
far as philosophical knowledge is possible, it is by such methods that
it must be sought; I have also no doubt that, by these methods, many
ancient problems are completely soluble.</p>
<p>There remains, however, a vast field, traditionally included in
philosophy, where scientific methods are inadequate. This field includes
ultimate questions of value; science alone, for example, cannot prove
that it is bad to enjoy the infliction of cruelty. Whatever can be
known, can be known by means of science; but things which are
legitimately matters of feeling lie outside its province.</p>
<p>Philosophy, throughout its history, has consisted of two parts
inharmoniously blended: on the one hand a theory as to the nature of the
world, on the other an ethical or political doctrine as to the best way
of living. The failure to separate these two with sufficient clarity has
been a source of much confused thinking. Philosophers, from Plato to
William James, have allowed their opinions as to the constitution of the
universe to be influenced by the desire for edification: knowing, as
they supposed, what beliefs would make men virtuous, they have invented
arguments, often very sophistical, to prove that these beliefs are true.
For my part I reprobate this kind of bias, both on moral and on
intellectual grounds. Morally, a philosopher who uses his professional
competence for anything except a disinterested search for truth is
guilty of a kind of treachery. And when he assumes, in advance of
inquiry, that certain beliefs, whether true or false, are such as to
promote good behaviour, he is so limiting the scope of philosophical
speculation as to make philosophy trivial; the true philosopher is
prepared to examine all preconceptions. When any limits are placed,
consciously or unconsciously, upon the pursuit of truth, philosophy
becomes paralysed by fear, and the ground is prepared for a government
censorship punishing those who utter ‘dangerous thoughts’—in fact, the
philosopher has already placed such a censorship over his own
investigations.</p>
<p>Intellectually, the effect of mistaken moral considerations upon
philosophy has been to impede progress to an extraordinary extent. I do
not myself believe that philosophy can either prove or disprove the
truth of religious dogmas, but ever since Plato most philosophers have
considered it part of their business to produce ‘proofs’ of immortality
and the existence of God. They have found fault with the proofs of their
predecessors—St Thomas rejected St Anselm’s proofs, and Kant rejected
Descartes’—but they have supplied new ones of their own. In order to
make their proofs seem valid, they have had to falsify logic, to make
mathematics mystical, and to pretend that deep-seated prejudices were
heaven-sent intuitions.</p>
<p>All this is rejected by the philosophers who make logical analysis
the main business of philosophy. They confess frankly that the human
intellect is unable to find conclusive answers to many questions of
profound importance to mankind, but they refuse to believe that there is
some ‘higher’ way of knowing, by which we can discover truths hidden
from science and the intellect. For this renunciation they have been
rewarded by the discovery that many questions, formerly obscured by the
fog of metaphysics, can be answered with precision, and by objective
methods which introduce nothing of the philosopher’s temperament except
the desire to understand. Take such questions as: What is number? What
are space and time? What is mind, and what is matter? I do not say that
we can here and now give definitive answers to all these ancient
questions, but I do say that a method has been discovered by which, as
in science, we can make successive approximations to the truth, in which
each new stage results from an improvement, not a rejection, of what has
gone before.</p>
<p>In the welter of conflicting fanaticisms, one of the few unifying
forces is scientific truthfulness, by which I mean the habit of basing
our beliefs upon observations and inferences as impersonal, and as much
divested of local and temperamental bias, as is possible for human
beings. To have insisted upon the introduction of this virtue into
philosophy, and to have invented a powerful method by which it can be
rendered fruitful, are the chief merits of the philosophical school of
which I am a member. The habit of careful veracity acquired in the
practice of this philosophical method can be extended to the whole
sphere of human activity, producing, wherever it exists, a lessening of
fanaticism with an increasing capacity of sympathy and mutual
understanding. In abandoning a part of its dogmatic pretensions,
philosophy does not cease to suggest and inspire a way of life.</p>
