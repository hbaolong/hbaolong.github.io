<h4 id="st-augustines-philosophy-and-theology">4 ST AUGUSTINE’S
PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY</h4>
<p>St Augustine was a very voluminous writer, mainly on theological
subjects. Some of his controversial writing was topical, and lost
interest through its very success; but some of it, especially what is
concerned with the Pelagians, remained practically influential down to
modern times. I do not propose to treat his works exhaustively, but only
to discuss what seems to me important, either intrinsically or
historically. I shall consider:</p>
<p>First: his pure philosophy, particularly his theory of time;</p>
<p>Second: his philosophy of history, as developed in The City of
God;</p>
<p>Third: his theory of salvation, as propounded against the
Pelagians.</p>
<p>I. PURE PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>St Augustine, at most times, does not occupy himself with pure
philosophy, but when he does he shows very great ability. He is the
first of a long line whose purely speculative views are influenced by
the necessity of agreeing with Scripture. This cannot be said of earlier
Christian philosophers, e.g. Origen; in Origen, Christianity and
Platonism lie side by side, and do not interpenetrate. In St Augustine,
on the other hand, original thinking in pure philosophy is stimulated by
the fact that Platonism, in certain respects, is not in harmony with
Genesis.</p>
<p>The best purely philosophical work in St Augustine’s writings is the
eleventh book of the Confessions. Popular editions of the Confessions
end with Book X, on the ground that what follows is uninteresting; it is
uninteresting because it is good philosophy, not biography. Book XI is
concerned with the problem: Creation having occurred as the first
chapter of Genesis asserts, and as Augustine maintains against the
Manichæans, it should have occurred as soon as possible. So he imagines
an objector arguing.</p>
<p>The first point to realize, if his answer is to be understood, is
that creation out of nothing, which was taught in the Old Testament, was
an idea wholly foreign to Greek philosophy. When Plato speaks of
creation, he imagines a primitive matter to which God gives form; and
the same is true of Aristotle. Their God is an artificer or architect,
rather than a Creator. Substance is thought of as eternal and uncreated;
only form is due to the will of God. As against this view, St Augustine
maintains, as every orthodox Christian must, that the world was created
not from any certain matter, but from nothing. God created substance,
not only order and arrangement.</p>
<p>The Greek view, that creation out of nothing is impossible, has
recurred at intervals in Christian times, and has led to pantheism.
Pantheism holds that God and the world are not distinct, and that
everything in the world is part of God. This view is developed most
fully in Spinoza, but is one to which almost all mystics are attracted.
It has thus happened, throughout the Christian centuries, that mystics
have had difficulty in remaining orthodox, since they find it hard to
believe that the world is outside God. Augustine, however, feels no
difficulty on this point; Genesis is explicit, and that is enough for
him. His view on this matter is essential to his theory of time.</p>
<p>Why was the world not created sooner? Because there was no ‘sooner’.
Time was created when the world was created. God is eternal, in the
sense of being timeless; in God there is no before and after, but only
an eternal present. God’s eternity is exempt from the relation of time;
all time is present to Him at once. He did not precede His own creation
of time, for that would imply that He was in time, whereas He stands
eternally outside the stream of time. This leads St Augustine to a very
admirable relativistic theory of time.</p>
<p>‘What, then, is time?’ he asks. ‘If no one asks of me, I know; if I
wish to explain to him who asks, I know not.’ Various difficulties
perplex him. Neither past nor future, he says, but only the present,
really is; the present is only a moment, and time can only be measured
while it is passing. Nevertheless, there really is time past and future.
We seem here to be led into contradictions. The only way Augustine can
find to avoid these contradictions is to say that past and future can
only be thought of as present: ‘past’ must be identified with memory,
and ‘future’ with expectation, memory and expectation being both present
facts. There are, he says, three times: ‘a present of things past, a
present of things present, and a present of things future’. ‘The present
of things past is memory,’ the present of things present is sight; and
the present of things future is expectation.’1 To say that there are
three times, past, present, and future, is a loose way of speaking.</p>
<p>He realizes that he has not really solved all difficulties by this
theory. ‘My soul yearns to know this most entangled enigma,’ he says,
and he prays to God to enlighten him, assuring Him that his interest in
the problem does not arise from vain curiosity. ‘I confess to Thee, O
Lord, that I am as yet ignorant what time is.’ But the gist of the
solution he suggests is that time is subjective: time is in the human
mind, which expects, considers, and remembers.2 It follows that there
can be no time without a created being,3 and that to speak of time
before the Creation is meaningless.</p>
<p>I do not myself agree with this theory, in so far as it makes time
something mental. But it is clearly a very able theory, deserving to be
seriously considered. I should go further, and say that it is a great
advance on anything to be found on the subject in Greek philosophy. It
contains a better and clearer statement than Kant’s of the subjective
theory of time—a theory which, since Kant, has been widely accepted
among philosophers.</p>
<p>The theory that time is only an aspect of our thoughts is one of the
most extreme forms of that subjectivism which, as we have seen,
gradually increased in antiquity from the time of Protagoras and
Socrates onwards. Its emotional aspect is obsession with sin, which came
later than its intellectual aspects. St Augustine exhibits both kinds of
subjectivism. Subjectivism led him to anticipate not only Kant’s theory
of time, but Descartes’ cogito. In his Soliloquia he says: ‘You, who
wish to know, do you know you are? I know it. Whence are you? I know
not. Do you feel yourself single or multiple? I know not. Do you feel
yourself moved? I know not. Do you know that you think? I do.’ This
contains not only Descarte’s cogito, but his reply to Gassendi’s ambulo
ergo sum. As a philosopher, therefore, Augustine deserves a high
place.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE CITY OF GOD</li>
</ol>
<p>When, in 410, Rome was sacked by the Goths, the pagans, not
unnaturally, attributed the disaster to the abandonment of the ancient
gods. So long as Jupiter was worshipped, they said, Rome remained
powerful; now that the Emperors have turned away from him, he no longer
protects his Romans. This pagan argument called for an answer. The City
of God, written gradually between 412 and 427, was St Augustine’s
answer; but it took, as it proceeded, a far wider flight, and developed
a complete Christian scheme of history, past, present, and future. It
was an immensely influential book throughout the Middle Ages, especially
in the struggles of the Church with secular princes.</p>
<p>Like some other very great books, it composes itself, in the memory
of those who have read it, into something better than at first appears
on re-reading. It contains a great deal that hardly anyone at the
present day can accept, and its central thesis is somewhat obscured by
excrescences belonging to his age. But the broad conception of a
contrast between the City of this world and the City of God has remained
an inspiration to many, and even now can be restated in non-theological
terms.</p>
<p>To omit detail in an account of the book, and concentrate on the
central idea, would give an unduly favourable view; on the other hand,
to concentrate on the detail would be to omit what is best and most
important. I shall endeavour to avoid both errors by first giving some
account of the detail and then passing on to the general idea as it
appeared in historical development.</p>
<p>The book begins with considerations arising out of the sack of Rome,
and designed to show that even worse things happened in pre-Christian
times. Among the pagans who attribute the disaster to Christianity,
there are many, the Saint says, who, during the sack, sought sanctuary
in the churches, which the Goths, because they were Christians,
respected. In the sack of Troy, on the contrary, Juno’s temple afforded
no protection, nor did the gods preserve the city from destruction. The
Romans never spared temples in conquered cities; in this respect, the
sack of Rome was milder than most, and the mitigation was a result of
Christianity.</p>
<p>Christians who suffered the sack have no right to complain, for
several reasons. Some wicked Goths may have prospered at their expense,
but they will suffer hereafter: if all sin were punished on earth, there
would be no need of the Last Judgment. What Christians endured would, if
they were virtuous, turn to their edification, for saints, in the loss
of things temporal, lose nothing of any value. It does not matter if
their bodies lie unburied, because ravenous beasts cannot interfere with
the resurrection of the body.</p>
<p>Next comes the question of pious virgins who were raped during the
sack. There were apparently some who held that these ladies, by no fault
of their own, had lost the crown of virginity. This view the Saint very
sensibly opposes. ‘Tush, another’s lust cannot pollute thee.’ Chastity
is a virtue of the mind, and is not lost by rape, but is lost by the
intention of sin, even if unperformed. It is suggested that God
permitted rapes because the victims had been too proud of their
continence. It is wicked to commit suicide in order to avoid being
raped; this leads to a long discussion of Lucretia, who ought not to
have killed herself, because suicide is always a sin.</p>
<p>There is one proviso to the exculpation of virtuous women who are
raped: they must not enjoy it. If they do, they are sinful.</p>
<p>He comes next to the wickedness of the heathen gods. For example:
‘Your stage-plays, those spectacles of uncleanness, those licentious
vanities, were not first brought up at Rome by the corruptions of men,
but by the direct command of your gods.’4 It would be better to worship
a virtuous man, such as Scipio, than these immoral gods. But as for the
sack of Rome, it need not trouble Christians, who have a sanctuary in
the ’pilgrim city of God’.</p>
<p>In this world, the two cities—the earthly and the heavenly—are
commingled; but hereafter the predestinate and the reprobate will be
separated. In this life, we cannot know who, even among our seeming
enemies, are to be found ultimately among the elect.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of the work, we are told, will consist in the
refutation of the philosophers, with the best of whom Christians are to
a large extent in agreement—for instance as to immortality and the
creation of the world by God.5</p>
<p>The philosophers did not throw over the worship of the heathen gods,
and their moral instructions were weak because the gods were wicked. It
is not suggested that the gods are mere fables; they are held by St
Augustine to exist, but to be devils. They liked to have filthy stories
told of them, because they wanted to injure men. Jupiter’s deeds count
more, with most pagans, than Plato’s doctrines or Cato’s opinions.
’Plato, who would not allow poets to dwell in a well-governed city,
showed that his sole worth was better than those gods, that desire to be
honoured with stage-plays.’6</p>
<p>Rome was always wicked, from the rape of the Sabine women onwards.
Many chapters are devoted to the sinfulness of Roman imperialism. Nor is
it true that Rome did not suffer before the State became Christian; from
the Gauls and the civil wars it suffered as much as from the Goths, and
more.</p>
<p>Astrology is not only wicked, but false; this may be proved from the
different fortunes of twins, who have the same horoscope.7 The Stoic
conception of Fate (which was connected with astrology) is mistaken,
since angels and men have free will. It is true that God has
foreknowledge of our sins, but we do not sin because of His
foreknowledge. It is a mistake to suppose that virtue brings
unhappiness, even in this world: Christian emperors, if virtuous, have
been happy even if not fortunate, and Constantine and Theodosius were
fortunate as well; again, the Jewish kingdom lasted as long as the Jews
adhered to the truth of religion.</p>
<p>There is a very sympathetic account of Plato, whom he places above
all other philosophers. All others are to give place to him: ’Let Thales
depart with his water, Anaximenes with the air, the Stoics with their
fire, Epicurus with his atoms.’8 All these were materialists; Plato was
not. Plato saw that God is</p>
<p>not any bodily thing, but that all things have their being from God,
and from something immutable. He was right, also, in saying that
perception is not the source of truth. Platonists are the best in logic
and ethics, and nearest to Christianity. ‘It is said that Plotinus, that
lived but lately, understood Plato the best of any.’ As for Aristotle,
he was Plato’s inferior, but far above the rest. Both, however, said
that all gods are good, and to be worshipped.</p>
<p>As against the Stoics, who condemned all passion, St Augustine holds
that the passions of Christians may be causes of virtue; anger, or pity,
is not to be condemned per se, but we must inquire into its cause.</p>
<p>Platonists are right about God, wrong about gods. They are also wrong
in not acknowledging the Incarnation.</p>
<p>There is a long discussion of angels and demons, which is connected
with the Neoplatonists. Angels may be good or bad, but demons are always
bad. To angels, knowledge of temporal things (though they have it) is
vile. St Augustine holds with Plato that the sensible world is inferior
to the eternal.</p>
<p>Book XI begins the account of the nature of the City of God. The City
of God is the society of the elect. Knowledge of God is obtained only
through Christ. There are things that can be discovered by reason (as in
the philosophers), but for all further religious knowledge we must rely
on the Scriptures. We ought not to seek to understand time and space
before the world was made: there was no time before the Creation, and
there is no place where the world is not.</p>
<p>Everything blessed is eternal, but not everything eternal is
blessed—e.g. hell and Satan. God foreknew the sins of devils, but also
their use in improving the universe as a whole, which is analogous to
antithesis in rhetoric.</p>
<p>Origen errs in thinking that souls were given bodies as a punishment.
If this were so, bad souls would have bad bodies; but devils, even the
worst of them, have airy bodies, which are better than ours.</p>
<p>The reason the world was created in six days is that six is a perfect
number (i.e. equal to the sum of its factors).</p>
<p>There are good and bad angels, but even the bad angels do not have an
essence which is contrary to God. God’s enemies are not so by nature,
but by will. The vicious will has no efficient cause, but only a
deficient one; it is not an effect, but a defect.</p>
<p>The world is less than six thousand years old. History is not cyclic,
as some philosophers suppose: ’Christ died once for our sins.’9</p>
<p>If our first parents had not sinned, they would not have died, but,
because they sinned, all their posterity die. Eating the apple brought
not only natural death, but eternal death, i.e. damnation.</p>
<p>Porphyry is wrong in refusing bodies to saints in heaven. They will
have better bodies than Adam’s before the fall; their bodies will be
spiritual, but not spirits, and will not have weight. Men will have male
bodies, and women female bodies, and those who have died in infancy will
rise again with adult bodies.</p>
<p>Adam’s sin would have brought all mankind to eternal death
(i.e. damnation), but that God’s grace has freed many from it. Sin came
from the soul, not from the flesh. Platonists and Manichæans both err in
ascribing sin to the nature of the flesh, though Platonists are not so
bad as Manichæans. The punishment of all mankind for Adam’s sin was
just; for, as a result of this sin, man, that might have been spiritual
in body, became carnal in mind.10</p>
<p>This leads to a long and minute discussion of sexual lust, to which
we are subject as part of our punishment for Adam’s sin. This discussion
is very important as revealing the psychology of asceticism; we must
therefore go into it, although the Saint confesses that the theme is
immodest. The theory advanced is as follows.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that sexual intercourse in marriage is not
sinful, provided the intention is to beget offspring. Yet even in
marriage a virtuous man will wish that he could manage without lust.
Even in marriage, as the desire for privacy shows, people are ashamed of
sexual intercourse, because ‘this lawful act of nature is (from our
first parents) accompanied with our penal shame’. The cynics thought
that one should be without shame, and Diogenes would have none of it,
wishing to be in all things like a dog; yet even he, after one attempt,
abandoned, in practice, this extreme of shamelessness. What is shameful
about lust is its independence of the will. Adam and Eve, before the
fall, could have had sexual intercourse without lust, though in fact
they did not. Handicraftsmen, in the pursuit of their trade, move their
hands without lust; similarly Adam, if only he had kept away from the
apple-tree, could have performed the business of sex without the
emotions that it now demands. The sexual members, like the rest of the
body, would have obeyed the will. The need of lust in sexual intercourse
is a punishment for Adam’s sin, but for which sex might have been
divorced from pleasure. Omitting some physiological details which the
translator has very properly left in the decent obscurity of the
original Latin, the above is St Augustine’s theory as regards sex.</p>
<p>It is evident from the above that what makes the ascetic dislike sex
is its independence of the will. Virtue, it is held, demands a complete
control of the will over the body, but such control does not suffice to
make the sexual act possible. The sexual act, therefore, seems
inconsistent with a perfectly virtuous life.</p>
<p>Ever since the Fall, the world has been divided into two cities, of
which one shall reign eternally with God, the other shall be in eternal
torment with Satan. Cain belongs to the city of the Devil, Abel to the
City of God. Abel, by grace, and in virtue of predestination, was a
pilgrim on earth and a citizen of heaven. The patriarchs belonged to the
City of God. Discussion of the death of Methuselah brings St Augustine
to the vexed question of the comparison of the Septuagint with the
Vulgate. The data, as given in the Septuagint, lead to the conclusion
that Methuselah survived the flood by fourteen years, which is
impossible, since he was not in the Ark. The Vulgate, following the
Hebrew manuscripts, gives data from which it follows that he died in the
year of the flood. On this point, St Augustine holds that St Jerome and
the Hebrew manuscripts must be right. Some people maintained that the
Jews had deliberately falsified the Hebrew manuscripts, out of malice
towards the Christians; this hypothesis is rejected. On the other hand,
the Septuagint must have been divinely inspired. The only conclusion is
that Ptolemy’s copyists made mistakes in transcribing the Septuagint.
Speaking of the translations of the Old Testament, he says: ‘The Church
has received that of the Seventy, as if there were no other, as many of
the Greek Christians, using this wholly, know not whether there be or
no. Our Latin translation is from this also. Although one Jerome, a
learned priest, and a great linguist, has translated the same Scriptures
from the Hebrew into Latin. But although the Jews affirm his learned
labour to be all truth, and avouch the Seventy to have oftentimes erred,
yet the Churches of Christ hold no one man to be preferred before so
many, especially being selected by the high priest, for this work.’ He
accepts the story of the miraculous agreement of the seventy independent
translations, and considers this a proof that the Septuagint is divinely
inspired. The Hebrew, however, is equally inspired. This conclusion
leaves undecided the question as to the authority of Jerome’s
translation. Perhaps he might have been more decidedly on Jerome’s side
if the two Saints had not had a quarrel about St Peter’s time-serving
propensities.11</p>
<p>He gives a synchronism of sacred and profane history. We learn that
Æneas came to Italy when Abdon12 was judge in Israel, and that the last
persecution will be under Antichrist, but its date is unknown.</p>
<p>After an admirable chapter against judicial torture, St Augustine
proceeds to combat the new Academicians, who hold all things to be
doubtful. ‘The Church of Christ detests these doubts as madness, having
a most certain knowledge of the things it apprehends.’ We should believe
in the truth of the Scriptures. He goes on to explain that there is no
true virtue apart from true</p>
<p>religion. Pagan virtue is ‘prostituted with the influence of obscene
and filthy devils’. What would be virtues in a Christian are vices in a
pagan. ‘Those things which she [the soul] seems to account virtues, and
thereby to sway her affections, if they be not all referred unto God,
are indeed vices rather than virtues.’ They that are not of this society
(the Church) shall suffer eternal misery. ‘In our conflicts here on
earth, either the pain is victor, and so death expels the sense of it,
or nature conquers, and expels the pain. But there, pain shall afflict
eternally, and nature shall suffer eternally, both enduring to the
continuance of the inflicted punishment.’</p>
<p>There are two resurrections, that of the soul at death, and that of
the body at the Last Judgment. After a discussion of various
difficulties concerning the millennium, and the subsequent doings of Gog
and Magog, he comes to a text in II Thessalonians (ii, 11, 12): ‘God
shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie, that
they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness.’ Some people might think it unjust that the Omnipotent
should first deceive them, and then punish them for being deceived; but
to St Augustine this seems quite in order. ‘Being condemned, they are
seduced, and, being seduced, condemned. But their seducement is by the
secret judgment of God, justly secret, and secretly just; even His that
hath judged continually, ever since the world began.’ St Augustine holds
that God divided mankind into the elect and the reprobate, not because
of their merits or demerits, but arbitrarily. All alike deserve
damnation, and therefore the reprobate have no ground of complaint. From
the above passage of St Paul, it appears that they are wicked because
they are reprobate, not reprobate because they are wicked.</p>
<p>After the resurrection of the body, the bodies of the damned will
burn eternally without being consumed. In this there is nothing strange;
it happens to the salamander and Mount Etna. Devils, though incorporeal,
can be burnt by corporeal fire. Hell’s torments are not purifying, and
will not be lessened by the intercessions of saints. Origen erred in
thinking hell not eternal. Heretics, and sinful Catholics, will be
damned.</p>
<p>The book ends with a description of the Saints’ vision of God in
heaven, and of the eternal felicity of the City of God.</p>
<p>From the above summary, the importance of the work may not be clear.
What was influential was the separation of Church and State, with the
clear implication that the State could only be part of the City of God
by being submissive towards the Church in all religious matters. This
has been the doctrine of the Church ever since. All through the Middle
Ages, during the gradual rise of the papal power, and throughout the
conflict between Pope and Emperor, St Augustine supplied the Western
Church with the theoretical justification of its policy. The Jewish
State, in the legendary time of the judges, and in the historical period
after the return from the Babylonian captivity, had been a theocracy;
the Christian State should imitate it in this respect. The weakness of
the emperors, and of most Western medieval monarchs, enabled the Church,
to a great extent, to realize the ideal of the City of God. In the East,
where the emperor was strong, this development never took place, and the
Church remained much more subject to the State than it became in the
West.</p>
<p>The Reformation, which revived St Augustine’s doctrine of salvation,
threw over his theocratic teaching, and became Erastian,13 largely owing
to the practical exigencies of the fight with Catholicism. But
Protestant Erastianism was half-hearted, and the most religious among
Protestants were still influenced by St Augustine. Anabaptists, Fifth
Monarchy Men, and Quakers took over a part of his doctrine, but laid
less stress on the Church. He held to predestination, and also to the
need of baptism for salvation; these two doctrines do not harmonize
well, and the extreme Protestants threw over the latter. But their
eschatology remained Augustinian.</p>
<p>The City of God contains little that is fundamentally original. The
eschatology is Jewish in origin, and came into Christianity mainly
through the Book of Revelation. The doctrine of predestination and
election is Pauline, though St Augustine gave it a much fuller and more
logical development than is to be found in the Epistles. The distinction
between sacred and profane history is quite clearly set forth in the Old
Testament. What St Augustine did was to bring these elements together,
and to relate them to the history of his own time, in such a way that
the fall of the Western Empire, and the subsequent period of confusion,
could be assimilated by Christians without any unduly severe trial of
their faith.</p>
<p>The Jewish pattern of history, past and future, is such as to make a
powerful appeal to the oppressed and unfortunate at all times. St
Augustine adapted this pattern to Christianity, Marx to Socialism. To
understand Marx psychologically, one should use the following
dictionary:</p>
<p>The terms on the left give the emotional content of the terms on the
right, and it is this emotional content, familiar to those who have had
a Christian or</p>
<p>a Jewish upbringing, that makes Marx’s eschatology credible. A
similar dictionary could be made for the Nazis, but their conceptions
are more purely Old Testament and less Christian than those of Marx, and
their Messiah is more analogous to the Maccabees than to Christ.</p>

<li>THE PELAGIAN CONTROVERSY</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the most influential part of St Augustine’s theology was
concerned in combating the Pelagian heresy. Pelagius was a Welshman,
whose real name was Morgan, which means ‘man of the sea’, as ‘Pelagius’
does in Greek. He was a cultivated and agreeable ecclesiastic, less
fanatical than many of his contemporaries. He believed in free will,
questioned the doctrine of original sin, and thought that, when men act
virtuously, it is by reason of their own moral effort. If they act
rightly, and are orthodox, they go to heaven as a reward of their
virtues.</p>
<p>These views, though they may now seem commonplace, caused, at the
time, a great commotion, and were, largely through St Augustine’s
efforts, declared heretical. They had, however, a considerable temporary
success. Augustine had to write to the patriarch of Jerusalem to warn
him against the wily heresiarch, who had persuaded many Eastern
theologians to adopt his views. Even after his condemnation, other
people, called semi-Pelagians, advocated weakened forms of his
doctrines. It was a long time before the purer teaching of the Saint was
completely victorious, especially in France, where the final
condemnation of the semi-Pelagian heresy took place at the Council of
Orange in 529.</p>
<p>St Augustine taught that Adam, before the Fall, had had free will,
and could have abstained from sin. But as he and Eve ate the apple,
corruption entered into them, and descended to all their posterity, none
of whom can, of their own power, abstain from sin. Only God’s grace
enables men to be virtuous. Since we all inherit Adam’s sin, we all
deserve eternal damnation. All who die unbaptized, even infants, will go
to hell and suffer unending torment. We have no reason to complain of
this, since we are all wicked. (In the Confessions, the Saint enumerates
the crimes of which he was guilty in the cradle.) But by God’s free
grace certain people, among those who have been baptized, are chosen to
go to heaven; these are the elect. They do not go to heaven because they
are good; we are all totally depraved, except in so far as God’s grace,
which is only bestowed on the elect, enables us to be otherwise. No
reason can be given why some are saved and the rest damned; this is due
to God’s unmotived choice. Damnation proves God’s justice; salvation,
His mercy. Both equally display His goodness.</p>
<p>The arguments in favour of this ferocious doctrine—which was revived
by Calvin, and has since then not been held by the Catholic Church—are
to be found in the writings of St Paul, particularly the Epistle to the
Romans. These are treated by Augustine as a lawyer treats the law: the
interpretation is able, and the texts are made to yield their utmost
meaning. One is persuaded, at the end, not that St Paul believed what
Augustine deduces, but that, taking certain texts in isolation, they do
imply just what he says they do. It may seem odd that the damnation of
unbaptized infants should not have been thought shocking, but should
have been attributed to a good God. The conviction of sin, however, so
dominated him that he really believed new-born children to be limbs of
Satan. A great deal of what is most ferocious in the medieval Church is
traceable to his gloomy sense of universal guilt.</p>
<p>There is only one intellectual difficulty that really troubles St
Augustine. This is not that it seems a pity to have created Man, since
the immense majority of the human race are predestined to eternal
torment. What troubles him is that, if original sin is inherited from
Adam, as St Paul teaches, the soul, as well as the body, must be
propagated by the parents, for sin is of the soul, not the body. He sees
difficulties in this doctrine, but says that, since Scripture is silent,
it cannot be necessary to salvation to arrive at a just view on the
matter. He therefore leaves it undecided.</p>
<p>It is strange that the last men of intellectual eminence before the
dark ages were concerned, not with saving civilization or expelling the
barbarians or reforming the abuses of the administration, but with
preaching the merit of virginity and the damnation of unbaptized
infants. Seeing that these were the preoccupations that the Church
handed on to the converted barbarians, it is no wonder that the
succeeding age surpassed almost all other fully historical periods in
cruelty and superstition.</p>
