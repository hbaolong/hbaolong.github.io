<h4 id="aristotles-logic">22 ARISTOTLE’S LOGIC</h4>
<p>Aristotle’s influence, which was very great in many different fields,
was greatest of all in logic. In late antiquity, when Plato was still
supreme in metaphysics, Aristotle was the recognized authority in logic,
and he retained this position throughout the Middle Ages. It was not
till the thirteenth century that Christian philosophers accorded him
supremacy in the field of metaphysics. This supremacy was largely lost
after the Renaissance, but his supremacy in logic survived. Even at the
present day, all Catholic teachers of philosophy and many others still
obstinately reject the discoveries of modern logic, and adhere with a
strange tenacity to a system which is as definitely antiquated as
Ptolemaic astronomy. This makes it difficult to do historical justice to
Aristotle. His present-day influence is so inimical to clear thinking
that it is hard to remember how great an advance he made upon all his
predecessors (including Plato), or how admirable his logical work would
still seem if it had been a stage in a continual progress, instead of
being (as in fact it was) a dead end, followed by over two thousand
years of stagnation. In dealing with the predecessors of Aristotle, it
is not necessary to remind the reader that they are not verbally
inspired; one can therefore praise them for their ability without being
supposed to subscribe to all their doctrines. Aristotle, on the
contrary, is still, especially in logic, a battle-ground, and cannot be
treated in a purely historical spirit.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s most important work in logic is the doctrine of the
syllogism. A syllogism is an argument consisting of three parts, a major
premiss, a minor premiss, and a conclusion. Syllogisms are of a number
of different kinds, each of which has a name, given by the scholastics.
The most familiar is the kind called ‘Barbara’:</p>
<p>All men are mortal (Major premiss).</p>
<p>Socrates is a man (Minor premiss).</p>
<p>Therefore: Socrates is mortal (Conclusion).</p>
<p>Or: all men are mortal.</p>
<p>All Greeks are men.</p>
<p>Therefore: All Greeks are mortal.</p>
<p>(Aristotle does not distinguish between these two forms; this, as we
shall see later, is a mistake.)</p>
<p>Other forms are: No fishes are rational, all sharks are fishes,
therefore no sharks are rational. (This is called ‘Celarent’.)</p>
<p>All men are rational, some animals are men, therefore some animals
are rational. (This is called ‘Darii’.)</p>
<p>No Greeks are black, some men are Greeks, therefore some men are not
black. (This is called ‘Ferio’.)</p>
<p>These four make up the ‘first figure’; Aristotle adds a second and
third figure, and the schoolmen added a fourth. It is shown that the
three later figures can be reduced to the first by various devices.</p>
<p>There are some inferences that can be made from a single premiss.
From ‘some men are mortal’ we can infer that ‘some mortals are men’.
According to Aristotle, this can be also inferred from ‘all men are
mortal’. From ‘no gods are mortal’ we can infer ‘no mortals are gods’,
but from ‘some men are not Greeks’ it does not follow that ‘some Greeks
are not men’.</p>
<p>Apart from such inferences as the above, Aristotle and his followers
thought that all deductive inference, when strictly stated, is
syllogistic. By setting forth all the valid kinds of syllogism, and
setting out any suggested argument in syllogistic form, it should
therefore be possible to avoid all fallacies.</p>
<p>This system was the beginning of formal logic, and, as such, was both
important and admirable. But considered as the end, not the beginning,
of formal logic, it is open to three kinds of criticism:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Formal defects within the system itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Over-estimation of the syllogism, as compared to other forms of
deductive argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Over-estimation of deduction as a form of argument.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On each of these three, something must be said.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Formal defects. Let us begin with the two statements ‘Socrates is a
man’ and ‘all Greeks are men’. It is necessary to make a sharp
distinction between these two, which is not done in Aristotelian logic.
The statement ‘all Greeks are men’ is commonly interpreted as implying
that there are Greeks; without this implication, some of Aristotle’s
syllogisms are not valid. Take for instance:</li>
</ol>
<p>‘All Greeks are men, All Greeks are white, therefore some men are
white.’ This is valid if there are Greeks, but not otherwise. If I were
to say:</p>
<p>‘All golden mountains are mountains, all golden mountains are golden,
therefore some mountains are golden,’ my conclusion would be false,
though in some sense my premisses would be true. If we are to be
explicit, we must therefore divide the one statement ‘all Greeks are
men’ into two, one saying ‘there are Greeks’, and the other saying ‘if
anything is a Greek it is a man’. The latter statement is purely
hypothetical, and does not imply that there are Greeks.</p>
<p>The statement ‘all Greeks are men’ is thus much more complex in form
than the statement ‘Socrates is a man’. ‘Socrates is a man’ has
‘Socrates’ for its subject, but ‘all Greeks are men’ does not have ‘all
Greeks’ for its subject, for there is nothing about ‘all Greeks’ either
in the statement ‘there are Greeks’, or in the statement ‘if anything is
a Greek it is a man’.</p>
<p>This purely formal error was a source of errors in metaphysics and
theory of knowledge. Consider the state of our knowledge in regard to
the two propositions ‘Socrates is mortal’ and ‘all men are mortal’. In
order to know the truth of ‘Socrates is mortal’, most of us are content
to rely upon testimony; but if testimony is to be reliable, it must lead
us back to some one who knew Socrates and saw him dead. The one
perceived fact—the dead body of Socrates—together with the knowledge
that this was called ‘Socrates’, was enough to assure us of the
mortality of Socrates. But when it comes to ‘all men are mortal’, the
matter is different. The question of our knowledge of such general
propositions is a very difficult one. Sometimes they are merely verbal:
‘all Greeks are men’ is known because nothing is called ‘a Greek’ unless
it is a man. Such general statements can be ascertained from the
dictionary; they tell us nothing about the world except how words are
used. But ‘all men are mortal’ is not of this sort; there is nothing
logically self-contradictory about an immortal man. We believe the
proposition on the basis of induction, because there is no
well-authenticated case of a man living more than (say) 150 years; but
this only makes the proposition probable, not certain. It cannot be
certain so long as living men exist.</p>
<p>Metaphysical errors arose through supposing that ‘all men’ is the
subject of ‘all men are mortal’ in the same sense as that in which
‘Socrates’ is the subject of ‘Socrates is mortal’. It made it possible
to hold that, in some sense, ‘all men’ denotes an entity of the same
sort as that denoted by ‘Socrates’. This led Aristotle to say that in a
sense a species is a substance. He is careful to qualify this statement,
but his followers, especially Porphyry, showed less caution.</p>
<p>Another error into which Aristotle falls through this mistake is to
think that a predicate of a predicate can be a predicate of the original
subject. If I say ‘Socrates is Greek, all Greeks are human’, Aristotle
thinks that ‘human’ is a predicate of ‘Greek’, while ‘Greek’ is a
predicate of ‘Socrates’, and obviously ‘human’ is a predicate of
‘Socrates’. But in fact ‘human’ is not a predicate of ‘Greek’. The
distinction between names and predicates, or in metaphysical language,
between particulars and universals, is thus blurred, with disastrous
consequences to philosophy. One of the resulting confusions was to
suppose that a class with only one member is identical with that one
member. This made it impossible to have a correct theory of the number
one, and led to endless bad metaphysics about unity.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Over-estimation of the syllogism. The syllogism is only one kind
of deductive argument. In mathematics, which is wholly deductive,
syllogisms hardly ever occur. Of course, it would be possible to
re-write mathematical arguments in syllogistic form, but this would be
very artificial and would not make them any more cogent. Take
arithmetic, for example. If I buy goods worth 16s. 3d., and tender a £1
note in payment, how much change is due to me? To put this simple sum in
the form of a syllogism would be absurd, and would tend to conceal the
real nature of the argument. Again, within logic there are
non-syllogistic inferences such as: ‘A horse is an animal, therefore a
horse’s head is an animal’s head.’ Valid syllogisms, in fact, are only
some among valid deductions, and have no logical priority over others.
The attempt to give pre-eminence to the syllogism in deduction misled
philosophers as to the nature of mathematical reasoning. Kant, who
perceived that mathematics is not syllogistic, inferred that it uses
extra-logical principles, which, however, he supposed to be as certain
as those of logic. He, like his predecessors, though in a different way,
was misled by respect for Aristotle.</p></li>
<li><p>Over-estimation of deduction. The Greeks in general attached more
importance to deduction as a source of knowledge than modern
philosophers do. In this respect, Aristotle was less at fault than
Plato; he repeatedly admitted the importance of induction, and he
devoted considerable attention to the question: how do we know the first
premisses from which deduction must start? Nevertheless, he, like other
Greeks, gave undue prominence to deduction in his theory of knowledge.
We shall agree that Mr Smith (say) is mortal, and we may, loosely, say
that we know this because we know that all men are mortal. But what we
really know is not ‘all men are mortal’; we know rather something like
‘all men born more than one hundred and fifty years ago are mortal, and
so are almost all men born more than one hundred years ago’. This is our
reason for thinking that Mr Smith will die. But this argument is an
induction, not a deduction. It has less cogency than a deduction, and
yields only a probability, not a certainty; but on the other hand it
gives new knowledge, which deduction does not. All the important
inferences outside logic and pure mathematics are inductive, not
deductive; the only exceptions are law and theology, each of which
derives its first principles from an unquestionable text, viz. the
statute books or the scriptures.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from The Prior Analytics, which deals with the syllogism, there
are other logical writings of Aristotle which have considerable
importance in the history of philosophy. One of these is the short work
on The Categories. Porphyry the Neoplatonist wrote a commentary on this
book, which had a very notable influence on medieval philosophy; but for
the present let us ignore Porphyry and confine ourselves to
Aristotle.</p>
<p>What, exactly is meant by the word ‘category’, whether in Aristotle
or in Kant and Hegel, I must confess that I have never been able to
understand. I do not myself believe that the term ‘category’ is in any
way useful in philosophy, as representing any clear idea. There are, in
Aristotle, ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, relation,
place, time, position, state, action, and affection. The only definition
offered of the term ‘category’ is: ‘expressions which are in no way
composite signify’—and then follows the above list. This seems to mean
that every word of which the meaning is not compounded of the meanings
of other words signifies a substance or a quantity or etc. There is no
suggestion of any principle on which the list of ten categories has been
compiled.</p>
<p>‘Substance’ is primarily what is not predicable of a subject nor
present in a subject. A thing is said to be ‘present in a subject’ when,
though not a part of the subject, it cannot exist without the subject.
The instances given are a piece of grammatical knowledge which is
present in a mind, and a certain whiteness which may be present in a
body. A substance in the above primary sense is an individual thing or
person or animal. But in a secondary sense a species or a
genus—e.g. ‘man’ or ‘animal’—may be called a substance. This secondary
sense seems indefensible, and opened the door, in later writers, to much
bad metaphysics.</p>
<p>The Posterior Analytics is a work largely concerned with a question
which must trouble any deductive theory, namely: How are first premisses
obtained? Since deduction must start from somewhere, we must begin with
something unproved, which must be known otherwise than by demonstration.
I shall not give Aristotle’s theory in detail, since it depends upon the
notion of essence. A definition, he says, is a statement of a thing’s
essential nature. The notion of essence is an intimate part of every
philosophy subsequent to Aristotle, until we come to modern times. It
is, in my opinion, a hopelessly muddle-headed notion, but its historical
importance requires us to say something about it.</p>
<p>The ‘essence’ of a thing appears to have meant ‘those of its
properties which it cannot change without losing its identity’. Socrates
may be sometimes happy, sometimes sad; sometimes well, sometimes
ill. Since he can change these properties without ceasing to be
Socrates, they are no part of his essence. But it is supposed to be of
the essence of Socrates that he is a man, though a Pythagorean, who
believes in transmigration, will not admit this. In fact, the question
of ‘essence’ is one as to the use of words. We apply the same name, on
different occasions, to somewhat different occurrences, which we regard
as manifestations of a single ‘thing’ or ‘person’. In fact, however,
this is only a verbal convenience. The ‘essence’ of Socrates thus
consists of those properties in the absence of which we should not use
the name ‘Socrates’. The question is purely linguistic: a word may have
an essence, but a thing cannot.</p>
<p>The conception of ‘substance’, like that of ‘essence’, is a
transference to metaphysics of what is only a linguistic convenience. We
find it convenient, in describing the world, to describe a certain
number of occurrences as events in the life of ‘Socrates’, and a certain
number of others as events in the life of ‘Mr Smith’. This leads us to
think of ‘Socrates’ or ‘Mr Smith’ as denoting something that persists
through a certain number of years, and as in some way more ‘solid’ and
‘real’ than the events that happen to him. If Socrates is ill, we think
that Socrates, at other times, is well, and therefore the being of
Socrates is independent of his illness; illness, on the other hand,
requires somebody to be ill. But although Socrates need not be ill,
something must be occurring to him if he is to be considered to exist.
He is not, therefore, really any more ‘solid’ than the things that
happen to him.</p>
<p>‘Substance’, when taken seriously, is a concept impossible to free
from difficulties. A substance is supposed to be the subject of
properties, and to be something distinct from all its properties. But
when we take away the properties, and try to imagine the substance by
itself, we find that there is nothing left. To put the matter in another
way: What distinguishes one substance from another? Not difference of
properties, for, according to the logic of substance, difference of
properties presupposes numerical diversity between the substances
concerned. Two substances, therefore, must be just two, without being,
in themselves, in any way distinguishable. How, then, are we ever to
find out that they are two?</p>
<p>‘Substance’, in fact is merely a convenient way of collecting events
into bundles. What can we know about Mr Smith? When we look at him, we
see a pattern of colours; when we listen to him talking, we hear a
series of sounds. We believe that, like us, he has thoughts and
feelings. But what is Mr Smith apart from all these occurrences? A mere
imaginary hook, from which the occurrences are supposed to hang. They
have in fact no need of a hook, any more than the earth needs an
elephant to rest upon. Any one can see, in the analogous case of a
geographical region, that such a word as ‘France’ (say) is only a
linguistic convenience, and that there is not a thing called ‘France’
over and above its various parts. The same holds of ‘Mr Smith’; it is a
collective name for a number of occurrences. If we take it as anything
more, it denotes something completely unknowable, and therefore not
needed for the expression of what we know.</p>
<p>‘Substance’, in a word, is a metaphysical mistake, due to
transference to the world-structure of the structure of sentences
composed of a subject and a predicate.</p>
<p>I conclude that the Aristotelian doctrines with which we have been
concerned in this chapter are wholly false, with the exception of the
formal theory of the syllogism, which is unimportant. Any person in the
present day who wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he
reads Aristotle or any of his disciples. None the less, Aristotle’s
logical writings show great ability, and would have been useful to
mankind if they had appeared at a time when intellectual originality was
still active. Unfortunately, they appeared at the very end of the
creative period of Greek thought, and therefore came to be accepted as
authoritative. By the time that logical originality revived, a reign of
two thousand years had made Aristotle very difficult to dethrone.
Throughout modern times, practically every advance in science, in logic,
or in philosophy has had to be made in the teeth of opposition from
Aristotle’s disciples.</p>
