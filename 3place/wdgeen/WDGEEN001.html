<p>FROM THE PAGES OF OLIVER TWIST</p>
<p>“Please, sir, I want some more.”</p>
<p>(page 39)</p>
<p>He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as
ever stood four feet six, or something less.</p>
<p>(page 83)</p>
<p>Having prepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any
society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary
place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he
hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever.</p>
<p>(page 170)</p>
<p>It was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright
fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving
wretch to lay him down and die.</p>
<p>(page 201)</p>
<p>“We have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience! He’ll
be here soon enough for us all.”</p>
<p>(page 210)</p>
<p>Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is
dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are
reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are
delicate, and need a clearer vision.</p>
<p>(page 295)</p>
<p>Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter
tears: for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such
sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and
lost all character of pain.</p>
<p>(page 450)</p>
<p>The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow
sound—Death.</p>

<p>CHARLES DICKENS</p>
<p>Born on February 7, 1812, Charles Dickens was the second of eight
children in a family burdened with financial troubles. Despite difficult
early years, he became the most successful British writer of the
Victorian age.</p>
<p>In 1824, young Charles was withdrawn from school and forced to work
at a boot-blacking factory when his improvident father, accompanied by
his mother and siblings, was sentenced to three months in a debtor’s
prison. Once they were released, Charles attended a private school for
three years. The young man then became a solicitor’s clerk, mastered
shorthand, and before long was employed as a Parliamentary reporter.
When he was in his early twenties, Dickens began to publish stories and
sketches of London life in a variety of periodicals.</p>
<p>It was the publication of Pickwick Papers (1836-1837) that catapulted
the twenty-five-year-old author to national renown. Dickens wrote with
unequaled speed and often worked on several novels at a time, publishing
them first in monthly installments and then as books. His early novels
Oliver Twist (1837—1838), Nicholas Nickleby (1838-1839), The Old
Curiosity Shop (1840-1841), and A Christmas Carol (1843) solidified his
enormous, ongoing popularity. As Dickens matured, his social criticism
became increasingly biting, his humor dark, and his view of poverty
darker still. David Copperfield (1849-1850), Bleak House (1852-1853),
Hard Times (1854), A Tale of Two Cities (1859), Great Expectations
(1860-1861), and Our Mutual Friend (1864-1865) are the great works of
his masterful and prolific later period.</p>
<p>In 1858 Dickens’s twenty-three-year marriage to Catherine Hogarth
dissolved when he fell in love with Ellen Ternan, a young actress. The
last years of his life were filled with intense activity: writing,
managing amateur theatricals, and undertaking several reading tours that
reinforced the public’s favorable view of his work but took an enormous
toll on his health. Working feverishly to the last, Dickens collapsed
and died on June 9, 1870, leaving The Mystery of Edwin Drood
uncompleted.</p>
<p>Oliver claimed by his Affectionate Friends</p>
<p>THE WORLD OF CHARLES DICKENS AND OLIVER TWIST</p>
<p>1811 Jane Austen publishes Sense and Sensibility, arguably the first
modern English novel.</p>
<p>1812 Charles John Huffam Dickens is born at Portsmouth to John and
Elizabeth (nee Barrow) Dickens. The government orders a group of
Luddites, an organized band of laborers opposed to the industrialized
machinery that threatens to replace them, to be shot down.</p>
<p>1817 The Dickens family moves to Chatham, in Kent. Dickens be gins
reading the books in his father’s library; his favorites include the
works of Miguel de Cervantes, Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, and Tobias
Smollett.</p>
<p>1822 The Dickens family moves again, this time to Camden, in North
London. Dickens quickly and fastidiously learns the landscape of London,
an invaluable resource for his later writing.</p>
<p>1824 Charles is sent to work at Warren’s Blacking Factory, a
manufacturer of boot-blacking. His father is arrested for debt and
imprisoned for three months, and while the rest of the family stays with
John Dickens in prison, Charles lodges elsewhere and continues pasting
labels onto bottles of blacking at Warren’s.</p>
<p>1825 John Dickens retires on a naval pension, and Charles attends
Wellington House Academy, a private school where he wins a prize in
Latin.</p>
<p>1827 Dickens becomes a clerk in a solicitor’s office.</p>
<p>1829 After learning shorthand, he establishes himself as a reporter
for the law courts, Parliament, and various London newspapers. He meets
Maria Beadnell and falls in love with her.</p>
<p>1831 Dickens joins the journalistic staff of the Mirror of
Parliament: he transcribes speeches by the members of Parliament on such
topics as factory conditions, penal reform, education reform, the Poor
Law Commission, and the First Reform Bill of 1832.</p>
<p>1833 After four arduous years, Dickens’s affair with Beadnell
dissolves in the face of her family’s disapproval. He publishes his
first story, “A Dinner at Poplar Walk,” in the Monthly Magazine. The
British Parliament passes the Factory Act, which regulates child labor
and forces children to attend school until age thirteen.</p>
<p>1834 Dickens becomes a journalist for the Morning Chronicle, a job
that requires frequent travel and attendance at political meetings. He
continues to publish stories and sketches in periodicals. The Poor Law
Amendment Act ends out-of-door relief (aid given to the poor in their
own homes) and compels those in need of assistance to enter workhouses,
where conditions are very harsh.</p>
<p>1835 Dickens becomes engaged to Catherine Hogarth, the daughter of
George Hogarth, editor of the Evening Chronicle.</p>
<p>1836 Dickens writes in several different genres and achieves
significant literary success. Adopting the pseudonym “Boz,” based on his
pronunciation as a young child of Moses as “Boses,” Dickens publishes in
volume form Sketches by Boz, a collection of his earlier writings. He
marries Catherine Hogarth; the couple eventually has ten children.
Dickens becomes intensely and unceasingly prolific, continuing to write
feverishly throughout his life. Pickwick Papers, his first novel, brings
him instant popular success; it also sets the precedent of serialization
that he will follow for nearly all of his novels. He meets his future
biographer John Forster.</p>
<p>1837 Victoria is crowned queen. Dickens becomes the editor of
Bentley’s Miscellany and begins publishing installments of his novel
Oliver Twist in the journal.</p>
<p>1838 Oliver Twist is published in three volumes, while the serial
publication in Bentley’s continues. The novel was extremely popular, and
three dramatic versions were produced in London theaters in the winter
of 1838-1839.</p>
<p>1839 Nicholas Nickleby is published. Because of tension with Richard
Bentley, Dickens resigns his editorship and devotes himself fully to
writing. The Dickens family moves to Devonshire Terrace.</p>
<p>1840 Dickens establishes his own weekly miscellany, Master Humphrey’s
Clock, and writes all the content himself. After eighteen months, sales
fall off, and he is forced to abandon the periodical. To generate
capital, he quickly begins serial publication of The Old Curiosity
Shop.</p>
<p>1841 Dickens publishes Barnaby Rudge. He publicly denounces the
child-labor laws and abysmal factory conditions of the times; he
lambastes the Tories, who oppose humane labor laws.</p>
<p>1842 Accompanied by Catherine, an exhausted Dickens travels to
America, where he is lionized. His popularity there falters upon the
publication of American Notes, a chronicle that records his negative
reactions to the United States.</p>
<p>1843 Dickens publishes the most famous and best-loved of his annual
Christmas books, A Christmas Carol, which had taken him only a matter of
weeks to write.</p>
<p>1844 The Dickens family relocates to Genoa, Italy, where they remain
for a year.</p>
<p>1846 Dickens signs on as the first editor of the Daily News but soon
leaves because of disagreements with the publishers. The family moves to
Switzerland, then Paris, and remains abroad for six months.</p>
<p>1847 Upon his return to London, Dickens helps Miss Burdett Coutts
start a home for reformed prostitutes, which he later runs. William
Makepeace Thackeray begins publishing Vanity Fair in monthly parts.</p>
<p>1848 Dombey and Son, published in one volume, heralds Dickens’s more
mature and decidedly dark period, which over the next two decades yields
such major works as David Copperfield, Bleak House, Hard Times, Little
Dorrit, A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and Our Mutual Friend.
Dickens begins to run a private theater, in which he acts and performs
for charity. His company of amateurs includes painter Augustus Egg, who
depicts scenes from novels by Sir Walter Scott, Thackeray, and other
writers.</p>
<p>1850 Realism becomes a conscious agenda among artists working in
media such as painting, literature, and theater. Dickens establishes his
magazine Household Words, which is succeeded by the end of the decade by
his publication All the Year Round.</p>
<p>1851 Dickens’s father dies. The author meets landscape painter Wilkie
Collins, who has a gift for mystery writing and whom Dickens admires
greatly. Dickens’s theater troupe performs before Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>1857 Dickens’s marriage becomes increasingly strained. The Frozen
Deep, a melodrama written jointly by Dickens and Collins, stars Dickens
and the enchanting actress Ellen Ternan, with whom he falls in love.
Ternan, twenty-seven years Dickens’s junior, haunts the author’s fiction
from this time on. Dickens tours Switzerland and Italy with Collins and
Egg.</p>
<p>1858 Dickens embarks on an exhausting series of public readings,
which earn him money but take a toll on his physical health. He and
Catherine separate.</p>
<p>1860 Dickens settles in rural Gadshill, his residence for the rest of
his life.</p>
<p>1861 Great Expectations is published in three volumes. Dickens begins
a second series of public readings that lasts two years.</p>
<p>1863 Dickens’s mother dies, followed by his son Walter’s death in
India. After quarreling with Thackeray, Dickens reconciles with him just
before Thackeray’s death. The world’s first subway, the Metropolitan
Railway, opens in London.</p>
<p>1865 A shaken Dickens survives a disastrous train accident after he
returns from France with Ellen Ternan, who is rumored to be his
mistress.</p>
<p>1867 Dickens journeys again to America, where he reads publicly in
Boston, New York, and Washington.</p>
<p>1868 After returning to England, Dickens continues to give public
readings despite his declining health.</p>
<p>1870 Dickens begins his last series of readings in London. He
publishes six parts of The Mystery of Edwin Drood, but the novel’s
composition is halted by his sudden death in June. Charles Dickens is
buried in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey.</p>
