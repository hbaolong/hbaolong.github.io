<h4 id="preface-to-the-third-edition">PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h4>
<p>“Some of the author’s friends cried, ‘Lookee, gendemen, the man is a
villain; but it is Nature for all that’; and the young critics of the
age, the clerks, apprentices, etc., called it low, and fell
a-groaning.”—FIELDlNG.1</p>
<p>The greater part of this tale was originally published in a mag
azine. When I completed it, and put it forth in its present form three
years ago, I full expected it would be objected to on some very high
moral grounds in some very high moral quarters. The result did not fail
to prove the justice of my anticipations.</p>
<p>I embrace the present opportunity of saying a few words in
explanation of my aim and object in its production. It is in some sort a
duty with me to do so, in gratitude to those who sympathized with me and
divined my purpose at the time, and who, perhaps, will not be sorry to
have their impression confirmed under my own hand.</p>
<p>It is, it seems, a very coarse and shocking circumstance that some of
the characters in these pages are chosen from the most criminal and
degraded of London’s population, that Sikes is a thief and Fagin a
receiver of stolen goods, that the boys are pick-pockets and the girl is
a prostitute.</p>
<p>I confess I have yet to learn that a lesson of the purest good may
not be drawn from the vilest evil. I have always believed this to be a
recognized and established truth, laid down by the greatest men the
world has ever seen, constantly acted upon by the best and wisest
natures, and confirmed by the reason and experience of every thinking
mind. I saw no reason, when I wrote this book, why the very dregs of
life, so long as their speech did not offend the ear, should not serve
the purpose of a moral at least as well as its froth and cream. Nor did
I doubt that there lay festering in Saint Giles’ as good materials
towards the truth as any flaunting in Saint James’s.2</p>
<p>In this spirit, when I wished to show in little Oliver the principle
of Good surviving through every adverse circumstance and triumphing at
last, and when I considered among what companions I could try him
best—having regard to that kind of men into whose hands he would most
naturally fall—I bethought myself of those who figure in these volumes.
When I came to discuss the subject more maturely with myself, I saw many
strong reasons for pursuing the course to which I was inclined. I had
read of thieves by scores—seductive fellows (amiable for the most part),
faultless in dress, plump in pocket, choice in horseflesh, bold in
bearing, fortunate in gallantry, great at a song, a bottle, pack of
cards or dice-box, and fit companions for the bravest. But I had never
met (except in Hogarth) with the miserable reality.3 It appeared to me
that to draw a knot of such associates in crime as really do exist; to
paint them in all their deformity, in all their wretchedness, in all the
squalid poverty of their lives; to show them as they really are, for
ever skulking uneasily through the dirtiest paths of life, with the
great, black, ghastly gallows closing up their prospects, turn them
where they may—it appeared to me that to do this would be to attempt a
something which was greatly needed and which would be a service to
society. And therefore I did it as I best could.</p>
<p>In every book I know, where such characters are treated of at all,
certain allurements and fascinations are thrown around them. Even in the
Beggar’s Opera, the thieves are represented as leading a life which is
rather to be envied than otherwise; while Macheath,a with all the
captivations of command, and the devotion of the most beautiful girl and
only pure character in the piece, is as much to be admired and emulated
by weak beholders as any fine gentleman in a red coat who has purchased,
as Voltaireb says, the right to command a couple of thousand men or so
and to affront death at their head. Johnson’s question, whether any man
will turn thief because Macheath is reprieved, seems to me beside the
matter.4 I ask myself whether any man will be deterred from turning
thief because of his being sentenced to death and because of the
existence of Peachum and Lockit; and remembering the captain’s roaring
life, great appearance, vast success, and strong advantages, I feel
assured that nobody having a bent that way will take any warning from
him, or will see anything in the play but a very flowery and pleasant
road, conducting an honourable ambition, in course of time, to Tyburn
Tree.c</p>
<p>In fact, Gay’s witty satire on society had a general object which
made him careless of example in this respect and gave him other, wider,
and higher aims. The same may be said of Sir Edward Bulwer’s admirable
and most powerful novel of Paul Clifford,d which cannot be fairly
considered as having, or being intended to have, any bearing on this
part of the subject, one way or other.</p>
<p>What manner of life is that which is described in these pages, as the
everyday existence of a Thief? What charms has it for the young and
ill-disposed, what allurements for the most jolter-headed of juveniles?
Here are no canterings upon moonlit heaths, no merry-makings in the
snuggest of all possible caverns, none of the attractions of dress, no
embroidery, no lace, no jack-boots, no crimson coats and ruffles, none
of the dash and freedom with which “the road” has been time out of mind
invested. The cold, wet, shelterless midnight streets of London; the
foul and frowsy dens, where vice is closely packed and lacks the room to
turn; the haunts of hunger and disease, the shabby rags that scarcely
hold together—where are the attractions of these things? Have they no
lesson, and do they not whisper something beyond the little-regarded
warning of a moral precept?</p>
<p>But there are people of so refined and delicate a nature that they
cannot bear the contemplation of these horrors. Not that they turn
instinctively from crime, but that criminal characters, to suit them,
must be, like their meat, in delicate disguise. A Massaronie in green
velvet is quite an enchanting creature, but a Sikes in fustian is
un-supportable. A Mrs. Massaroni, being a lady in short petticoats and a
fancy dress, is a thing to imitate in tableaux and have in lithograph on
pretty songs; but a Nancy, being a creature in a cotton gown and cheap
shawl, is not to be thought of. It is wonderful how Virtue turns from
dirty stockings, and how Vice, married to ribbons and a little gay
attire, changes her name, as wedded ladies do, and becomes Romance.</p>
<p>Now, as the stern and plain truth, even in the dress of this (in
novels) much exalted race, was a part of the purpose of this book, I
will not, for these readers, abate one hole in the Dodger’s coat or one
scrap of curl-paper in the girl’s dishevelled hair. I have no faith in
the delicacy which cannot bear to look upon them. I have no desire to
make proselytes among such people. I have no respect for their opinion,
good or bad, do not covet their approval, and do not write for their
amusement. I venture to say this without reserve; for I am not aware of
any writer in our language having a respect for himself, or held in any
respect by his posterity, who ever has descended to the taste of this
fastidious class.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I look for examples and for precedents, I find
them in the noblest range of English literature. Fielding, Defoe,
Goldsmith, Smollett, Richardson, Mackenzie—all these for wise purposes,
and especially the two first, brought upon the scene the very scum and
refuse of the land. Hogarth, the moralist, and censor of his age—in
whose great works the times in which he lived and the characters of
every time will never cease to be reflected—did the like, without the
compromise of a hair’s breadth, with a power and depth of thought which
belonged to few men before him and will probably appertain to fewer
still in time to come. Where does this giant stand now in the estimation
of his countrymen? And yet, if I turn back to the days in which he or
any of these men flourished, I find the same reproach levelled against
them every one, each in his turn, by the insects of the hour, who raised
their little hum and died and were forgotten.</p>
<p>Cervantesf laughed Spain’s chivalry away by showing Spain its
impossible and wild absurdity. It was my attempt, in my humble and
far-distant sphere, to dim the false glitter surrounding something which
really did exist by showing it in its unattractive and repulsive truth.
No less consulting my own taste than the manners of the age, I
endeavoured, while I painted it in all its fallen and degraded aspects,
to banish from the lips of the lowest character I introduced, any
expression that could by possibility offend, and rather to lead to the
unavoidable inference that its existence was of the most debased and
vicious kind than to prove it elaborately by words and deeds. In the
case of the girl in particular I kept this intention constantly in view.
Whether it is apparent in the narrative, and how it is executed, I leave
my readers to determine.</p>
<p>It has been observed of this girl that her devotion to the brutal
housebreaker does not seem natural, and it has been objected to Sikes in
the same breath—with some inconsistency, as I venture to think—that he
is surely overdrawn, because in him there would appear to be none of
those redeeming traits which are objected to as unnatural in his
mistress. Of the latter objection I will merely say that I fear there
are in the world some insensible and callous natures that do become, at
last, utterly and irredeemably bad. But whether this be so or not, of
one thing I am certain: that there are such men as Sikes, who, being
closely followed through the same space of time and through the same
current of circumstances, would not give, by one look or action of a
moment, the faintest indication of a better nature. Whether every
gentler human feeling is dead within such bosoms, or the proper chord to
strike has rusted and is hard to find, I do not know; but that the fact
is so, I am sure.</p>
<p>It is useless to discuss whether the conduct and character of the
girl seems natural or unnatural, probable or improbable, right or wrong.
It is true. Every man who has watched these melancholy shades of life
knows it to be so. Suggested to my mind long ago—long before I dealt in
fiction—by what I often saw and read of in actual life around me, I have
for years tracked it through many profligate and noisome ways, and found
it still the same. From the first introduction of that poor wretch to
her laying her bloody head upon the robber’s breast, there is not one
word exaggerated or overwrought. It is emphatically God’s truth, for it
is the truth. He leaves in such depraved and miserable breasts, the hope
yet lingering behind, the last fair drop of water at the bottom of the
dried-up weed-choked well. It involves the best and worst shades of our
common nature, much of its ugliest hues and something of its most
beautiful ; it is a contradiction, an anomaly, an apparent
impossibility, but it is a truth. I am glad to have had it doubted, for
in that circumstance I find a sufficient assurance that it needed to be
told.</p>
