<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Second novels separate the sheep from the goats, the possessors of
enduring talent from the mere purveyors of flash-in-the-pan literary
sensation. Many writers embark on a second novel with a good deal of
trepidation, especially if their first book has achieved the kind of
instant acclaim awarded to Charles Dickens’s Pickwick Papers. If Dickens
experienced any such anxiety when he set out to write Oliver Twist, he
countered it with his lifelong drug of choice, a frenetic and compulsive
productivity. Appearing in monthly installments, the usual mode of
publication for novels until late in the nineteenth century, Oliver
Twist was mostly written in tandem with other projects. When the first
two chapters were published in Bentley’s Miscellany in February 1837,
Dickens was still writing Pickwick Papers as a serial for Chapman and
Hall. With Pickwick Papers completed in November 1837, the
twenty-five-year-old Dickens devoted himself to Oliver Twist for a mere
four months before beginning a third novel, Nicholas Nickleby. Oliver
Twist was finished and published in three volumes in November 1838,
while the serial version in Bentley’s still had five months to run. This
frenzied pace of production was halted only once, in June 1837, when the
intensity of his grief over the sudden death of his seventeen-year-old
sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth, forced Dickens to postpone that month’s
installments of both Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. Mary Hogarth is
memorialized as Rose Maylie in Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>Where many young writers would have been tempted to stay with a
winning formula, Dickens’s second novel was a total departure from the
timeless comedic world of Pickwick Papers. The first three installments
of Oliver Twist employed ferocious satire to address a contemporary
social evil, the sufferings of the poor in the new workhouses mandated
by the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act. Then, with the introduction of Fagin
and his gang of juvenile pickpockets in the fourth installment,
Dickens’s readers found themselves plunged into London’s criminal
underworld. The novel’s final installment contained a gruesome murder, a
manhunt, and a hanging. While a few readers, such as the Prime Minister,
Lord Melbourne, were shocked by Dickens’s turn to such sordid subject
matter, many more, including nineteen-year-old Queen Victoria, were
enthralled.</p>
<p>Oliver Twist was every bit as popular as Pickwick Papers. Three
dramatizations played in London theaters during the winter of 1838—1839.
Perfectly complemented by George Cruikshank’s quirky illustrations, the
novel was in a third edition by 1841, and even spawned an imitation,
Thomas Prest’s Oliver Twiss. It remained a best-seller through Dickens’s
lifetime and beyond. The penny edition of 1871 sold 150,000 copies in
three weeks. During the last decade of his life, Dickens toured England,
Ireland, and America, giving public readings of favorite sections from
his novels. “Sikes and Nancy,” based on chapter XLVII of Oliver Twist,
was a particular favorite of both author and audience. While Dickens’s
rendition of Nancy’s brutal murder sent audiences into fits of screaming
and fainting, a physician waited backstage to monitor the ailing
author’s pulse rate. Dickens’s friend and biographer John Forster
speculated that the energy and fervor with which Dickens threw himself
into these performances may have contributed to his early death from
heart disease in 1870.</p>
<p>Oliver Twist remains one of the best known and most popular of
Dickens’s novels. Translated, adapted, dramatized, filmed (most notably
by David Lean in 1948), and even turned into a musical, the story of
Little Orphan Oliver and his grotesque tormentors has passed into
popular culture. Millions of people who have never opened the
nineteenth-century novel are familiar with the image of a ragged child
holding out his porringer and asking for more. Like Robinson Crusoe or
Huck Finn, Oliver has evolved from fiction into fable and archetype. Or
perhaps he has simply returned to his roots. The characters and settings
of Oliver Twist resonate so deeply and so variously because they echo a
diverse collection of popular genres. The novel is at once social
satire, thriller, melodrama, autobiography, fairy tale, moral fable, and
religious allegory. While some of the specific texts that influenced
Oliver Twist’s composition are no longer familiar to contemporary
readers and may require some literary excavation, each of the various
genres whose competing voices create the novel’s seductive energy
survive and are easily recognizable in modern forms of
entertainment.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, Pickwick Papers, Dickens’s second novel
reflects his childhood passion for the eighteenth-century picaresque
novels Tom Jones and Roderick Random. As in the novels by Henry Fielding
and Tobias Smollett, the plot of Oliver Twist revolves around
illegitimacy and disputed inheritance. Like his literary forebears,
Oliver is unaware of his true identity and adrift in a world of rogues
and schemers. Unlike the more robust heroes of Fielding and Smollett,
however, Dickens’s orphan does not grow up; he remains a frail and
passive child throughout the novel, more victim than protagonist.
Oliver’s failure to reach adolescence preserves him from the sexual
temptations that befall Tom Jones and Roderick Random, perhaps making it
easier for Dickens to persuade his Victorian audience that “little
Oliver” embodies “the purest good.”</p>
<p>Dickens’s 1841 preface to the third edition of Oliver Twist echoes
his eighteenth-century masters in its declaration of high moral purpose.
Where Smollett’s preface to Roderick Random had announced the author’s
wish to arouse “generous indignation … against the sordid and vicious
disposition of the world,” and Fielding’s dedication of Tom Jones had
insisted that “to recommend goodness and innocence hath been my sincere
endeavour in this history,” Dickens assures the readers of Oliver Twist
of his intention to show “the principle of Good surviving through every
adverse circumstance and triumphing at last.” Indeed, in his efforts to
persuade us that his depiction of “the most criminal and degraded of
London’s population” is intended for instruction and not titillation,
Dickens cites both Fielding and Smollett, among a host of other
eighteenth-century novelists, as examples of writers who described “the
very scum and refuse of the land” for “wise purposes.”</p>
<p>Dickens’s invocation of Fielding and Smollett in defense of his
decision to draw Fagin, Sikes, Nancy, and the Artful Dodger “in all
their deformity, in all their wretchedness, in all the squalid poverty
of their lives” was intended to refute charges, by his rival, Thackeray,
and others, that Oliver Twist was an attempt to cash in on the immense
popularity of the so-called Newgate novels of Edward George
Bulwer-Lytton and William Harrison Ainsworth. Based on true accounts of
notorious criminals published in compilations such as The Newgate
Calendar (1773) and The New Newgate Calendar (1826—1828), the Newgate
novels romanticized the lives of highwaymen and other lowlife
characters. The popularity of the genre was at its height in the 1830s,
beginning with Bulwer-Lytton’s Paul Clifford (1830) and culminating in
the most successful Newgate novel of all, Ainsworth’s Jack Sheppard,
which for four months in 1839 overlapped with Oliver Twist in Bentley’s
Miscellany. Critics of the genre argued that such novels encouraged
sympathy with vice and were a harmful influence on the young.</p>
<p>Dickens’s 1841 preface answers those who would lump Oliver Twist with
the novels of Bulwer-Lytton and Ainsworth by insisting that his
portrayal of Fagin’s gang, far from romanticizing villains, intends “to
show them as they really are, for ever skulking uneasily through the
dirtiest paths of life, with the great, black, ghastly gallows closing
up their prospects, turn them where they may.” He argues that Oliver
Twist’s relationship to the Newgate novel is comparable to Don Quixote’s
relationship to the chivalric romance: Both seek to expose the absurdity
of a genre they appear to imitate. Certainly Fagin and Bill Sikes would
be unlikely to tempt even the most impressionable reader into a life of
crime, though Dickens may be skating on thinner ice with the Artful
Dodger, regarded by many as the novel’s most energetic and engaging
character. Nancy, the prostitute who sacrifices her life for Oliver, has
always presented a different kind of problem for readers. In his
representation of Nancy, Dickens is hindered in his aim of showing vice
in all its wretchedness by his anxiety to conform to “the manners of the
age” and avoid “any expression that could by possibility offend.” The
constraints of Victorian prudery, and Dickens’s “own taste” prevent any
direct reference to Nancy’s occupation and result in a character
scarcely less colorless than her respectable counterpart, Rose
Maylie.</p>
<p>While it may be true that Dickens’s moral purposes are very different
from those of Bulwer-Lytton and Ainsworth, there can be no doubt that
the popularity of the Newgate novel contributed to the initial success
of Oliver Twist. Dickens’s shrewd literary instincts are further
revealed in his omission of any direct reference to Bulwer-Lytton or
Ainsworth in the 1841 preface. Instead he uses John Gay’s The Beggar’s
Opera (1728) as an example of a work in which villains are romanticized.
As the editor of Bentley’s Miscellany, he was not about to alienate two
popular contributors.</p>
<p>Another influence on Oliver Twist was the Gothic novel, a fashionable
genre in the 1790s and the early decades of the nineteenth century whose
best-known practitioners included Ann Radcliffe and Matthew (“Monk”)
Lewis. The word “Gothic” originally implied medieval, as in Horace
Walpole’s influential The Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story (1765), but
by the late eighteenth century Gothic fiction was primarily concerned
with the supernatural and the macabre, the medieval element being
sometimes entirely abandoned. Oliver’s evil half-brother, Monks, with
his swirling cloak, scowling features, and foaming at the mouth, is an
all-too-perfect Gothic villain. Likewise, the episode in chapter XXXIV
in which Oliver wakes from a deep sleep to see Fagin and Monks peering
at him through the Maylie’s cottage window has the hallmarks of Gothic
mystery. When Oliver calls for help, an extensive search reveals no
trace of the intruders: “in no one place could they discern the print of
men’s shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet
had pressed the ground for hours before” (chap. XXXV) . Oliver’s friends
try to persuade him it was all a dream. Yet the atmosphere of threat
generated by this scene comes from Fagin and not from his companion.
While Fagin transcends anti-Semitic caricature to become a highly
complex character whose motives and mental processes are carefully
explained, Monks is a cardboard figure who never comes alive beyond his
generic Gothic attributes. Oliver Twist’s Gothic elements seem tired and
mechanical, as though Dickens never really had his heart in them.</p>
<p>The full title of his second novel, The Adventures of Oliver Twist;
or, The Parish Boy’s Progress, suggests that Dickens intended to
confront deeper moral and spiritual issues than are found in the popular
crime stories and mysteries of his time. The subtitle invokes both John
Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress (1678, 1684), and Hogarth’s two
best-known and most powerful series of engravings, The Harlot’s Progress
(1732) and The Rake’s Progress (1735). In the early nineteenth century,
Bunyan’s Puritan allegory, tracing the journey of Christian through the
snares of the world to the Celestial City, remained one of the most
widely read books in the English language. Bunyan describes a perilous
but ultimately successful struggle against temptation and evil.
Hogarth’s images depict the opposite trajectory. In the 1841 preface to
OliverTwist, Dickens cites Hogarth, “the moralist, and censor of his
age” as an inspiration for his plan to show vice and crime in all their
“miserable reality.” Bunyan’s allegorical hero, Christian, takes a
secular form in Dickens’s conception of Oliver as “the principle of
Good.” Oliver’s progress, like Christian’s, is destined to end in
triumph. The fates of Nancy, Fagin, and Sikes, on the other hand, are as
grim as those of Hogarth’s harlot and rake. While Bunyan presents the
triumph of virtue as an individual moral struggle, Hogarth uses his
representations of moral degradation as opportunities to expose social
and political corruption. In Oliver Twist, as we shall see, Dickens
struggles to reconcile Hogarth and Bunyan, social criticism and moral
allegory.</p>
<p>Pilgrimage is one of literature’s universal themes. As Steven Marcus
points out in Dickens: From Pickwick to Dombey (see “For Further
Reading”), “when Oliver sets out on his road to London with nothing but
‘a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings,’ he is
traversing one of history’s best worn paths.”Yet Oliver is an unusual
kind of pilgrim in that he has no particular destination or goal. He
does not seek spiritual rewards, like Bunyan’s Christian. Nor is he in
search of earthly gain, like that other famous British pauper boy, Dick
Whittington, who came to London to seek his fortune, ended up as Lord
Mayor of the city, and was memorialized in the statue that confronts the
fleeing murderer, Sikes, on Highgate Hill. Oliver, one might say, is an
accidental pilgrim.</p>
<p>At the beginning of The Pilgrim’s Progress, Christian announces his
intention to set out from the City of Destruction in search of “an
inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.” In the
terms of Bunyan’s Christian allegory, the riches his protagonist will
inherit are salvation and eternal life. When Dickens’s Oliver leaves the
town of his birth, he has no object beyond self-preservation in mind; he
is in flight from the intolerable conditions of his apprenticeship to
the undertaker, Sowerberry. Yet Oliver, like Christian, will come into
an inheritance, and at the conclusion of Oliver Twist, we learn that
Oliver’s earthly fortune, like Christian’s heavenly reward, can be
gained only through virtue and moral rectitude. Oliver’s father’s will
states that his son may receive his inheritance only if “in his minority
he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour,
meanness, cowardice, or wrong.” Oliver, who has steadfastly eschewed all
criminal acts throughout his acquaintance with Fagin’s gang, deserves
his inheritance. Yet whereas Christian earns his reward through active
choices, perseverance, and cooperation with the workings of Grace,
Oliver seems to achieve his by passivity and chance.</p>
<p>Dickens seems even more Calvinist than Bunyan in his insistence on
human helplessness and the necessity to yield all to Grace. Like
Christian, Oliver is alternately exposed to the forces of good and evil.
Unlike Christian, who does battle with the dark angel Apollyon and even
wounds him, Oliver acts only to refuse evil, never to combat it. Seized
by Fagin, rescued by Mr. Brownlow, snatched back by Fagin, and then
rescued again, Oliver is a passive bystander in the final battle for his
soul. Oliver encounters the agents of Grace in his life, Mr. Brownlow
and the Maylies, not as result of prayer and earnest supplication, but
through a pair of outrageous coincidences: He pickpockets the only man
in London who possesses a portrait of his mother, and then he assists in
the robbery of his own aunt’s house. In both cases, it is his
unwillingness to be a criminal, rather than any positive action on his
part, that brings him into contact with his rescuers. In Calvinist
terms, it seems that Oliver is already one of the Elect. Where Bunyan’s
Christian must become worthy of salvation, Oliver’s innate worthiness
must only be preserved. In an interesting reversal of Augustine’s
formulation, the “principle of Good” embodied in Oliver is in fact a
vacuum, a mere absence of evil.</p>
<p>With his genius for adapting different genres to his own purposes,
Dickens has reshaped formal elements of Bunyan’s religious allegory to
construct a bourgeois and secular fable. Salvation, for Oliver, is a
comfortable income and a cottage in suburbia. He is entitled to it not
even primarily because he has resisted evil, but because he is the son
of a gentleman. His ability to withstand the coercions of Fagin, the
threats of Bill Sikes, the seductions of the Artful Dodger, is, it is
implied, a part of his genetic inheritance. He is the offspring of a
decent, though erring, man and an angelic, ill-used woman. Through all
his trials, Oliver has retained the best aspects of his parents’ natures
and justified their unconventional love. Dickens, the romantic, uses
Oliver’s spotless character to argue that true affection is more
valuable than an empty marriage contract. The orphan’s half-brother,
Monks, the child of their father’s hate-filled coupling with his legal
wife, is physically and morally scarred. Oliver, the result of true,
though legally unsanctioned, love, is morally immaculate.</p>
<p>In some miraculous fashion, growing up in a workhouse and a thieves’
den, Oliver even possesses innate middle-class manners and a more
genteel style of speech than any of his early companions. Dickens
appears to be arguing that social class is a matter of essential,
inherited characteristics that express themselves regardless of nurture.
Oliver is like Hans Christian Andersen’s Ugly Duckling; out of place and
cruelly abused in the squalid environment of his birth, he is eventually
recognized and claimed by his true family. At some time or another
almost every child, stung by some perceived parental injustice, takes
refuge in the myth of a lost “real family” of rank and privilege. The
particular appeal, for Dickens, of such a fantasy is best understood in
autobiographical terms. Much of the story of Oliver Twist is driven by
memories of childhood ordeals. As Michael Slater points out, in his
introduction to the 1992 Everyman’s Library edition of Oliver Twist,
“Dickens had a closer, more intensely personal involvement with his
story of a sensitive, intelligent young child’s exposure to social
degradation and moral danger than his readers can possibly have dreamed
of.”</p>
<p>When Charles Dickens was twelve years old, his father was arrested
for debt and sent to Marshalsea Prison. As was customary at the time,
the whole family took up residence in the prison—all except Charles, the
oldest boy, who was taken out of school and sent to work in Warren’s
Blacking Factory. For six months, the studious and ambitious boy was
employed pasting labels on bottles of shoe polish for six or seven
shillings a week. He spent his nights in lodgings near the factory and
visited his family only once a week, on Sundays. For years Dickens was
unable to discuss this period of his life, or to walk past Warren’s
factory in the Strand. Eventually he wrote an account of the experience
for his friend John Forster, who included it in The Life of Charles
Dickens (1872—1874). Writing decades after the event, Dickens vividly
recalled his boyhood feelings of betrayal and wounded pride: “It is
wonderful to me how I could have been so easily cast away at such an
age. It is wonderful to me that … no one had compassion enough on me—a
child of singular abilities, quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt,
bodily or mentally—to suggest that something might have been spared … to
place me at any common school” (Forster, p. 25).</p>
<p>The young Charles Dickens, acutely aware of his family’s fallen
status in the world, and full of conventional nineteenth-century
snobbery, was particularly humiliated to find himself working side by
side with uneducated street urchins: “No words can express the secret
agony of my soul as I sunk into this companionship; compared these
everyday associates with those of my happier childhood; and felt my
early hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man, crushed
in my breast” (Forster, p. 26). One of Dickens’s companions, an orphan
named Bob Fagin, seems to have had some real regard for him. Dickens
recounts how Fagin taught him the job, nursed him when he was sick, and
protected him from the bullying that his refined accent provoked.
However, Bob Fagin’s kindness was more threatening to Dickens than the
other boys’ taunts. By helping him to function in his new, degraded
world, Fagin also unintentionally helped to undermine the boy’s sense of
his true identity. The last thing the twelve-year-old Charles Dickens
wanted was to fit in with his new companions. Years later, Dickens
rewarded Bob Fagin for his solicitude by giving his name to the most
dangerous villain in Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>In Oliver Twist, it is Bob Fagin’s namesake who attempts to socialize
Oliver to the life of a pickpocket and, at the behest of Monks, to
prevent him from discovering his true parentage. Fagin’s prize pupil,
the Artful Dodger, discovers Oliver soon after his arrival in London.
Hungry and homeless, the orphan runaway is at the lowest ebb of
“lonesomeness and desolation” as he sits, “with bleeding feet and
covered with dust, upon a doorstep” (chap. VIII). The Dodger takes him
home to Fagin’s den, where he is given food and shelter. At first, the
world of Fagin and his apprentices seems one of fellowship and fun. Only
later, through the corrupting game with the pocket-handkerchiefs, do the
real motives of the “merry old gentleman” become clear. He is preparing
his charges for the gallows. Fagin is the most dangerous person a lonely
and vulnerable child could meet, a corrupter with a smiling face.</p>
<p>Whether or not he realized it at the time, in hindsight Dickens knew
how close he had come, during the months at the blacking factory, to
disappearing, like Oliver, into the criminal world of the London
streets: “I know that I have lounged about the streets, insufficiently
and unsatisfactorily fed. I know that, but for the mercy of God, I might
easily have been, for any care that was taken of me, a little robber or
a little vagabond” (Forster, p. 28). The youthful Charles Dickens
preserved himself from such an outcome, or so he afterward believed,
only by keeping aloof from other boys and constantly reminding himself
of his superior origins and ambitions: “Though perfectly familiar with
them, my conduct and manners were different enough from theirs to place
a space between us. They … always spoke of me as ‘the young gentleman’”
(p. 29). If, in his “lonesomeness and desolation,” he had allowed
himself to make friends with the well-meaning Bob Fagin, who knows what
might have been his fate?</p>
<p>Dickens’s boyhood miseries came to an end when his grand-mother died,
leaving her son, John Dickens, enough money to discharge his debts.
Charles was rescued from the blacking factory and sent to school at
Wellington House Academy. From then on, successes came rapidly. Leaving
school at the age of fifteen, he became a lawyer’s clerk and later a
parliamentary reporter. By the time he was twenty-one, Dickens was
contributing stories to newspapers and magazines under the pen name of
“Boz.” At twenty-four, he was the celebrated author of Pickwick Papers.
Yet his experiences at the blacking factory left their mark. Fear of
poverty and debt drove Dickens to a lifetime of frenzied overwork.
Obsession with childhood, and especially with the experiences of
vulnerable and abused children, is a primary feature of his imaginative
world.</p>
<p>Looking back on the most traumatic five months of his life, Dickens
recalled, “That I suffered in secret, and that I suffered exquisitely,
no one ever knew but I. How much I suffered, it is … utterly beyond my
power to tell. No man’s imagination can overstep the reality. But I kept
my own counsel, and I did my work” (Forster, p. 29). Though it seems
most unlikely, judging from his ebullient adult personality, that the
twelve-year-old Charles Dickens bore much outward resemblance to Oliver
Twist, it is easy to see how Oliver might represent the young Dickens’s
hidden feelings of helplessness and abandonment. Pale, thin, starved,
and utterly pathetic, passive little Oliver is the embodiment of all
that his creator had suffered secretly. Dickens’s childhood feelings of
undeserved humiliation and lack of control over the circumstances of his
own life are relived in his account of the ordeals of an orphan boy,
born in the workhouse and later left to fend for himself on the streets
of London.</p>
<p>Kathleen Tillotson, in her introduction to the Clarendon edition of
Oliver Twist, traces the novel’s long incubation. Several significant
scenes and characters are reworkings of ideas in Sketches by Boz,
Dickens’s 1836 compilation of his early stories. The Artful Dodger has a
prototype in “Criminal Courts,” Sikes and Nancy resemble characters in
“The Hospital Patient,” and “A Visit to Newgate” anticipates Oliver’s
interview with Fagin in the condemned cell. Tillotson suggests that
elements of the narrative that would later become Oliver Twist had begun
to take shape in Dickens’s mind long before he started writing Pickwick
Papers. As the first novel Dickens published under his own name (for
Pickwick Papers he retained the pen name of “Boz”), Oliver Twist is far
more autobiographical than its genial predecessor. Indeed it exhibits
many of the strengths and weaknesses of a first novel.</p>
<p>Dickens’s intense identification with Oliver, while contributing to
Oliver Twist’s powerful emotional impact, also accounts for many of the
novel’s structural flaws. The author’s insistence on his protagonist’s
absolute innocence and helplessness severely limits Oliver’s potential
for interesting character development. He is too much a “principle” and
not enough a real child. Dickens himself appears to recognize this and,
in the second half of the novel, increasingly turns his focus from
Oliver to more entertaining secondary characters. A further problem lies
in Dickens’s insistence on Oliver’s innate superiority to other boys in
the workhouse and on the streets, and on the eventual restoration of his
status as gentleman. The myth of “gentility” as an inborn trait may have
helped the author to come to terms with the social humiliations of his
youth, but it severely undermines the effectiveness of Oliver Twist as
social criticism. If Oliver is to arouse readers’ indignation at the
plight of children in workhouses, it is essential that they view him not
as a specimen of unique virtue and sensitivity, but as a typical
case.</p>
<p>Dickens’s method of composition may explain some of the apparent
conflicts and inconsistencies in the narrative of his second novel.
Unlike contemporary writers, Dickens composed his novels episodically,
publishing early installments long before he had decided on the eventual
direction of the plot. His relationship with his characters undoubtedly
evolved and shifted as Oliver Twist progressed; his intense
identification with Oliver may have taken him by surprise, subverting
his original intention of using the child as a representative victim of
an inhumane system of poor relief.</p>
<p>The initial inspiration for Oliver Twist seems to have been Dickens’s
opposition to the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. This law brought to an
end the practice of out-of-door relief (aid given to the poor in their
own homes) on the grounds of inefficiency, and compelled everyone in
need of parish assistance to enter the workhouse. At the same time, the
indigent were to be deterred from coming to the workhouse, except as a
last resort, by ensuring that conditions there were as harsh as
possible. Inmates were kept on near starvation diets, forced to do hard
labor of a kind normally allocated to prisoners, and denied adequate
medical care. Death rates were high, especially among children. Every
child who died was one less charge on the parish. Dickens set out to
dramatize the cruelty of the new law by charting its effects on a
helpless orphan. His satirical exposure of heartlessness and greed made
an immediate and powerful impression on his audience. He was by no means
the first to protest the inhumanity of the new system, but the first
fifty pages of Oliver Twist constituted the liveliest and most
compelling literary onslaught the new legislation had yet received.</p>
<p>Oliver Twist contains scathing and memorable portraits of
hypocritical and self-important officialdom. Much of the novel’s
harshest irony is directed at the parish beadle, Mr. Bumble, who proudly
wears his “porochial seal” of “the Good Samaritan healing the sick and
bruised man” (chap. IV) while allowing the indigent to die in the
streets. Bumble boasts that his “great principle of out-of-door relief
is, to give the paupers exactly what they don’t want; and then they get
tired of coming” (chap. XXIII). Dickens makes use of mordant satire to
animate melancholy statistics. The infant Oliver is farmed out to a
branch workhouse in which “twenty or thirty … juvenile offenders against
the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience
of too much food or too much clothing,” and where it seemed to
“perversely happen” that in “eight and a half cases out of ten” children
“sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got
half-smothered by accident” (chap. II). Yet for all its poignant scenes
and memorable characters, Oliver Twist has serious limitations as social
criticism. The novel arouses our indignation against the general
treatment of the poor but does not argue for any specific reforms.
Indeed it is not entirely clear whether Dickens is attacking the Poor
Law Amendment Act itself, or the failure of the new commissioners to
stamp out abuses that had become entrenched under the old system. The
main targets of his satire, Bumble, Mrs. Corney, and Mrs. Mann, are all
relics of the old system of poor relief. In Oliver Twist, and throughout
his writings, Dickens fails to present cogent arguments for reform at a
systemic or institutional level because he harbors a deep mistrust of
all systems and institutions. As Steven Marcus points out, Oliver
Twist’s “determined, aggressive satire” cannot “in any convincing sense
be assigned to partisan allegiance.” Dickens can conceive of reform only
on a personal level.</p>
<p>In the world of Oliver Twist, public officials are at worst negligent
and corrupt like Bumble or Mrs. Mann, at best merely inept and comic
like the Bow Street Runners Blathers and Duff, who fail to solve the
Maylies’ burglary. Oliver’s rescue is accomplished through the
compassionate actions of individuals in the private sphere. Dickens
nowhere offends his middle-class readership by suggesting that Brownlow,
Grimwig, or the Maylies, as members of bourgeois society, can be blamed
for condoning or collaborating in institutionalized oppression of the
poor. He further assuages bourgeois sensibilities by providing his
readers with a middle-class hero in disguise. In reality, Noah Claypole,
and even Charley Bates and the Artful Dodger, present far more
convincing models of the likely fate of a penniless nineteenth-century
orphan.</p>
<p>Successful or not, social criticism ceases to be Dickens’s chief
concern once his orphan hero arrives in London. In his portrayals of the
workhouse officials, Dickens gives evil a comic face: Polemic is never
far from pantomime. In their marital squabbles, Mr. Bumble and
Mrs. Corney are like Punch and Judy, the sparring couple in a
traditional English slapstick puppet show. When Oliver falls among
thieves, the characters he encounters are recovered from a much darker
and more primitive layer of the author’s imagination. From now on,
Dickens can rarely muster enough detachment to write satire. He has
entered Oliver’s orphanhood and is once again the abandoned and fearful
boy in the blacking factory. As many readers have noticed, the denizens
of Dickens’s underworld are curiously sexless: Nancy, the prostitute, is
a slatternly Madonna, and there is never a hint of pederasty in Fagin’s
relationship with the boys. Rather than, as is commonly supposed,
distorting his characters to please a prudish Victorian audience, I
believe Dickens created them this way because this was how they
presented themselves to him: exaggerated, larger-than-life, erotic but
sexless, grotesque, and mysteriously powerful, as grown-ups appear to a
child.</p>
<p>Oliver Twist’s extreme polarities reproduce the moral landscape of
childhood. In this respect, the novel resembles a fairy tale. As Bruno
Bettelheim observes in The Uses of Enchantment, “The figures in fairy
tales are not ambivalent—not good and bad at the same time, as we all
are in reality. But since polarization dominates the child’s mind, it
also dominates fairy tales” (p. 9). In the world of Oliver Twist, adult
characters are either neglectful or corrupting parents, like Bumble,
Sikes, or Fagin, or they are wise fathers and nurturing mothers, like
Brownlow and Rose Maylie. Only Nancy, the sacrificial penitent, is
allowed the least shade of moral ambiguity. Oliver’s good and bad
adoptive families each have their own domestic hearth: While Brownlow
and the Maylies sip tea from fine china and introduce Oliver to the
pleasures of reading, Fagin presides over a den of drinking and
gambling. The thieves’ London is a labyrinth of mean and dirty streets,
noisy and noisome. Oliver’s refuges are neat and orderly. He picks
flowers in the Maylies’ Edenic garden. Yet in Dickens’s novel, as in
many a fairy tale, it is the ogre, the bad fairy, the wicked
stepmother—that embodiment of all that we fear and reject in
ourselves—who comes most convincingly to life. Brownlow is bland,
Grimwig is tedious, but Fagin compels our attention with his exuberant
villainy.</p>
<p>The extraordinary power of Dickens’s Fagin comes from the author’s
ability to clothe his childhood bogeyman in the sinister vestments of a
cultural archetype. While communicating the very personal distaste he
felt for his companion in the blacking factory, Dickens also exploits
the shameful burden of anti-Semitism in European culture. Fagin, who is
referred to as “the Jew” almost three hundred times in Oliver Twist, is
not only morally contemptible; he is also physically repellent and
possessed of several characteristics and accessories that directly link
him to Judas Iscariot and even Satan. When Oliver first meets the “old
shriveled Jew,” we learn that his “villainous-looking and repulsive face
was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair” (chap. VIII). In medieval
morality plays, Judas Iscariot traditionally wore long red hair, and
Dickens would later bestow the same greasy red locks on another of his
arch-villains, Uriah Heep, in David Copperfield. At his first encounter
with Oliver, Fagin is crouched over the fire, cooking sausages and
wielding a toasting fork that might easily be mistaken for Satan’s
pitchfork. Just in case we do not pick up on these cues, Dickens
repeatedly refers to Fagin as “the merry old gentleman,” a traditional
English nickname for the devil. Like Satan, Fagin is compared to a
serpent; like Satan, he flourishes in darkness. Describing one of
Fagin’s nighttime excursions through the slum streets of Little Saffron
Hill, Dickens informs us that, as he “glided stealthily along, creeping
beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man
seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness
through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich
offal for a meal” (chap. XIX). Invoking the most hideous charge of
medieval anti-Semitism, Fagin is shown to prey upon Christian children.
When his protégées no longer serve him, he makes sure that they
hang.</p>
<p>As Humphry House explains in his 1949 introduction to the Oxford
Illustrated Edition of Oliver Twist, the stereotype of the Jewish
“fence,” or receiver of stolen goods, was widely accepted in Victorian
England. House quotes from an article in the popular periodical, the
Quarterly Review: “A Jew seldom thieves, but is worse than a thief; he
encourages others to thieve. In every town there is a Jew, either
resident or tramping…. If a robbery is effected, the property is hid
till a Jew is found, and a bargain is then made” (House, p. vii). In
creating a Jewish villain and scapegoat, Dickens was articulating
prejudices so deeply and unquestioningly held in his culture that he
appears to have been quite shocked and stung when a Jewish reader, Eliza
Davies, reproached him for them. He endeavored to make amends by
eliminating many of the references to Fagin as “the Jew” in the 1867
edition of Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>Without in any way attempting to mitigate the offensiveness of
Dickens’s anti-Semitic caricature, it is worth pointing out that Fagin
is a lawless outsider even within his own religion. Not only does he
disregard Jewish dietary laws by cooking sausages (in nineteenth-century
England these would certainly have been made with pork), but we learn
that during his last night in the condemned cell at Newgate: “Venerable
men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven
them away with curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he
beat them off” (chap. LII).</p>
<p>Like his victims, Fagin is a hapless exile from bourgeois society. As
a predatory outcast, his literary lineage goes back to Grendel in the
Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf and to Cain in the Book of Genesis. As a human
type, he embodies the young Charles Dickens’s worst fears for himself as
he wandered the London streets, hungry and resentful, after long days in
the blacking factory. Fagin and his boys are the criminal outsiders that
Dickens narrowly escaped becoming. They are the shadow selves he must
reject utterly in order to identify with Oliver and the “principle of
Good.”Yet, although Fagin and the murderer Sikes are brought sternly to
justice, and indeed their final sufferings are described with ghoulish
glee, it is undeniably true that the criminal characters in Oliver Twist
receive the author’s most inspired and loving attention.</p>
<p>The novel is most compelling when Fagin, Sikes, and the Artful Dodger
hold court. We turn the pages impatiently when forced to stay too long
with Brownlow or the Maylies. Once he has left the workhouse, Oliver
becomes a mere pawn in the novel’s larger game, and scarcely a character
at all. It is the Artful Dodger, another orphan, though emphatically not
a victim or a principle, who bursts out of the novel endowed with all of
the author’s industry, vigor, and comic energy. Dickens cannot bring
himself to assign the Dodger a bad end. After his dazzling linguistic
performance in court, he is shipped off to Australia, protesting to the
last, “I shall have something to say elsewhere” (chap. XLIII).
Somewhere, outside the margins of Victorian society and free from the
constraining polarities of Oliver Twist, Dickens promises him a blank
page and a brilliant career. His creator is, we suspect, as Blake said
of Milton, “of the Devil’s party without knowing it.”</p>
