<h4 id="chapter-liii-and-last.">CHAPTER LIII And last.</h4>
<p>The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly
closed. The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in
few and simple words.</p>
<p>Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were
married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
the young clergyman’s labours; on the same day they entered into
possession of their new and happy home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to
enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity
that age and worth can know—the contemplation of the happiness of those
on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life,
have been unceasingly bestowed.</p>
<p>It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of
property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered
either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided
between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than
three thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father’s will, Oliver
would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to
deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices
and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to
which his young charge joyfully acceded.</p>
<p>Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a
distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he
once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long
confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk
under an attack of his old disorder,dc and died in prison. As far from
home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin’s gang.</p>
<p>Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old
housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear
friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver’s warm
and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose
condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever
be known in this changing world.</p>
<p>Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor
returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends,
he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such
feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For
two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared
the air began to disagree with him; then, findingthat the place really
no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his
assistant, took a bachelor’s cottage outside the village of which his
young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here, he took to
gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits
of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity.
In each and all, he has since become famous throughout the
neighbourhood, as a most profound authority.</p>
<p>Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship
for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated.
He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the
course of the year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes,
and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular
and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite
asseveration, that his mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never fails
to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman’s face: always informing
Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an
excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so. It is a
standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his
old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which
they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but
Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof
thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back, after all; which always
calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.</p>
<p>Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in
consequence of being admitted approverdd against Fagin: and considering
his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for
some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burthened
with too much work. After some consideration, he went into business as
an Informer,de in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His
plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by
Charlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of
charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with
threepennyworth of brandy to restore her, lays an informationnext day,
and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but
the result is the same.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually
reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in
that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.
Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation,
he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his
wife.</p>
<p>As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,
although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They
sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its
inmates, and Oliver, and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this
day the villagers have never been able to discover to which
establishment they properly belong.</p>
<p>Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes’s crime, fell into a train of
reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving
at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the
scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action.
He struggled hard and suffered much, for some time; but, having a
contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and,
from being a farmer’s drudge, and a carrier’s lad, he is now the
merriest young grazierdf in all Northamptonshire.</p>
<p>And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches
the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space,
the thread of these adventures.</p>
<p>I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long
moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would
show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding
on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who
trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint her the
life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I
would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low
tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her
in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring
discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her, and her dead
sister’s child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole
hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I
would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that
clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would
recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising
tear that glistened in the soft blue eyes. These, and a thousand looks
and smiles, and turns of thought and speech—I would fain recall them
every one.</p>
<p>Rose Maylie and Oliver</p>
<p>How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his
adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him,
more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving
seeds of all he wished him to become—how he traced in him new traits of
his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances,
melancholy and yet sweet and soothing—how the two orphans, tried by
adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love,
and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them—these are
all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were truly
happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude
to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is
Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be
attained.</p>
<p>Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white
marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: “AGNES.” There is no
coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name
is placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to
earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love—the love beyond the grave—of
those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes
sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less
because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.</p>
