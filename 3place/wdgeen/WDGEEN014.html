IX Containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman,
and his hopeful pupils.</h4>
<p>It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.
There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling
some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself
as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop
every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and
when he had satisfied himself, he would go on, whistling and stirring
again, as before.</p>
<p>Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly
awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you
dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half
conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in
five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect
unconsciousness. At such times, a mortal knows just enough of what his
mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers,
its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the
restraint of its corporeal associate.</p>
<p>Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his
half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of
the spoon grating against the saucepan’s sides; and yet the selfsame
senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with
almost everybody he had ever known.</p>
<p>When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.
Standing, then, in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he
did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at
Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all
appearance asleep.</p>
<p>After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to
the door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,
from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on
the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.
Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a
magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every
feature with a hideous grin. “Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the
last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never peached upon old
Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn’t have loosened the knot, or kept
the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine
fellows!”</p>
<p>With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the
Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half
a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed
with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other
articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly
workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.</p>
<p>Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small
that it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute
inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and, shading
it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put it
down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair,
muttered:</p>
<p>“What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead
men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it’s a fine thing for the
trade! Five of ’em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or
turn white-livered!”</p>
<p>As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been
staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver’s face; the boy’s eyes were
fixed on his in mute curiosity; and although the recognition was only
for an instant—for the briefest space of time that can possibly be
conceived—it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.
He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on
a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled
very much though; for, even in his terror Oliver could see that the
knife quivered in the air.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” said the Jew. “What do you watch me for? Why are you
awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick—quick! for your
life!”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t able to sleep any longer, sir,” replied Oliver, meekly. “I
am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.”</p>
<p>“You were not awake an hour ago?” said the Jew, scowling fiercely on
the boy.</p>
<p>“No! No, indeed!” replied Oliver.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:
and a threatening attitude.</p>
<p>“Upon my word I was not, sir,” replied Oliver, earnestly. “I was not,
indeed, sir.”</p>
<p>“Tush, tush, my dear!” said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old
manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as
if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. “Of
course I know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You’re a
brave boy. Ha! ha! you’re a brave boy, Oliver!” The Jew rubbed his hands
with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.</p>
<p>“Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew,
laying his hand upon it after a short pause.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said the Jew, turning rather pale. “They—they’re mine, Oliver;
my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks
call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that’s all.”</p>
<p>Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in
such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his
fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of
money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might
get up.</p>
<p>“Certainly, my dear, certainly,” replied the old gentleman. “Stay.
There’s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and
I’ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.”</p>
<p>Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to
raise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.</p>
<p>He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying
the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew’s directions, when the
Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom
Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally
introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on
the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home
in the crown of his hat.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing
himself to the Dodger. “I hope you’ve been at work this morning, my
dears?”</p>
<p>“Hard,” replied the Dodger.</p>
<p>“As Nails,” added Charley Bates.</p>
<p>“Good boys, good boys!” said the Jew. “What have you got,
Dodger?”</p>
<p>“A couple of pocket-books,” replied the young gentleman.</p>
<p>“Lined?” inquired the Jew, with eagerness.</p>
<p>“Pretty well,” replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one
green, and the other red.</p>
<p>“Not so heavy as they might be,” said the Jew, after looking at the
insides carefully; “but very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman,
ain’t he, Oliver?”</p>
<p>“Very, indeed, sir,” said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed
uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to
laugh at, in anything that had passed.</p>
<p>“And what have you got, my dear?” said Fagin to Charley Bates.</p>
<p>“Wipes,” replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four
pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the Jew, inspecting them closely; “they’re very good
ones, very. You haven’t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks
shall be picked out with a needle, and we’ll teach Oliver how to do it.
Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!”</p>
<p>“If you please, sir,” said Oliver.</p>
<p>“You’d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as
Charley Bates, wouldn’t you, my dear?” said the Jew.</p>
<p>“Very much, indeed, if you’ll teach me, sir,” replied Oliver.</p>
<p>Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply
that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was
drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly
terminated in his premature suffocation.</p>
<p>“He is so jolly green!” said Charley when he recovered, as an apology
to the company for his unpolite behaviour.</p>
<p>The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver’s hair over his eyes,
and said he’d know better, by-and-bye; upon which the old gentleman,
observing Oliver’s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking
whether there had been much of a crowd at the executionaf that morning?
This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of
the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally
wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very
industrious.</p>
<p>When the breakfast was cleared away, the merry old gentleman and the
two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed
in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket
of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat
pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond
pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his
spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the
room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen
walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the
fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was
staring with all his might into shopwindows. At such times he would look
constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all
his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn’t lost anything, in such a very
funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down
his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about:
getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it
was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon
his toes, or ran upon his boot accidentally, while Charley Bates
stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from
him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, notecase,
watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the
spectacle-case. If the old gentleman felt a hand in any one of his
pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over
again.</p>
<p>When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young
ladies called to see the young gentlemen; one of whom was named Bet, and
the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned
up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. They
were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in
their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably free
and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls
indeed. As there is no doubt they were.</p>
<p>These visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in
consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her
inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn.
At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad
the hoof. This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out;
for, directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young
ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable
old Jew with money to spend.</p>
<p>“There, my dear,” said Fagin. “That’s a pleasant life, isn’t it? They
have gone out for the day.”</p>
<p>“Have they done work, sir?” inquired Oliver.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the Jew; “that is, unless they should unexpectedly come
across any, when they are out; and they won’t neglect it, if they do, my
dear, depend upon it. Make ’em your models, my dear. Make ’em your
models,” tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his
words; “do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all
matters—especially the Dodger’s, my dear. He’ll be a great man himself,
and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.—Is my
handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?” said the Jew, stopping
short.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” said Oliver.</p>
<p>“See if you can take it out, without my feeling it: as you saw them
do, when we were at play this morning.”</p>
<p>Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen
the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the
other.</p>
<p>“Is it gone?” cried the Jew.</p>
<p>“Here it is, sir,” said Oliver, showing it in his hand.</p>
<p>“You’re a clever boy, my dear,” said the playful old gentleman,
patting Oliver on the head approvingly. “I never saw a sharper lad.
Here’s a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you’ll be the
greatest man of the time. And now come here, and I’ll show you how to
take the marksag out of the handkerchiefs.”</p>
<p>Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman’s pocket in play, had
to do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew,
being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the
table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.</p>
