<h4 id="endnotes">ENDNOTES</h4>
<p>1 (p. 13) “Some of the author’s friends… Fielding: The epigraph is
from book 8, chapter 1 of Tom Jones: A Foundling (1749), by Henry
Fielding. Dickens is invoking Fielding’s support for his plan to present
an honest portrayal of vice.</p>
<p>2 (p. 13) Saint Giles’ … Saint James’s: Dickens contrasts two very
different London districts: Saint Giles’s was a notorious slum area,
whereas the Court of Saint James was a center of fashionable life.</p>
<p>3 (p. 14) Hogarth: William Hogarth (1697—1764) was most famous for
his series of satirical engravings The Rake’s Progress (1735), which
portrayed the seamier side of London life.</p>
<p>4 (p. 14) Johnson’s question: In his Life of John Gay (1779), Samuel
Johnson writes that no one is going to ”imagine that he may rob with
safety, because he sees Macheath reprieved upon the stage.”</p>
<p>5 (p. 27) workhouse: The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 decreed that
all unemployed and destitute people seeking assistance must do so within
the workhouse. Victorian workhouses were massive, prison-like structures
in which living conditions were intentionally harsh, in order to
dissuade all but the most desperate from seeking relief Families were
separated, and inmates were required to wear identical uniforms, to
sleep in cramped dormitories, and to perform ten hours of hard labor per
day. Mortality rates were high.</p>
<p>6 (p. 30) lowest depth a deeper still: Dickens is alluding to Satan’s
description of hell in John Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667): ”And, in the
lowest deep, a lower deep / Still threatening to devour me opens wide, /
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven” (book 4, lines 76-78).</p>
<p>7 (p. 33) half-baptized: Oliver was baptized privately and without
the full rites of the Church of England, a measure often taken when it
seemed likely that an infant would die before a full baptism could be
arranged.</p>
<p>8 (p. 45) indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate: An
apprentice was bound to his master by legal documents, known as
indentures, which defined his terms of service. In the case of certain
hazardous occupations, such as chimney-sweeping, a magistrate was
required to approve the indenture, and to ensure that the contract was
voluntarily entered into. Hence Mr. Bumble commands Oliver to say that
he ”should like it very much indeed” (p. 46) .</p>
<p>9 (p. 52) millstone: This is an ironic reference to the words of
Jesus in the Bible, Matthew 18:6: ”But whoso shall offend one of these
little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
sea” (King James Version). Dickens’s heavy irony regarding Mr. Bumble’s
hypocrisy and perversion of Christian teachings on compassion continues
in the following paragraphs. The beadle wears a large brass button,
bearing the “porochial” seal of the Good Samaritan healing the sick and
bruised man (Luke 10:30—37). The grimly ironic equation of beadle and
Good Samaritan is underscored when we learn that Bumble wore the button
for the first time when attending the inquest of a man who ”died from
exposure to the cold” (p. 53) in a doorway at midnight, a reference to
the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16 :19-31 ) .</p>
<p>10 (p. 62) some medicine in a blacking-bottle: The medicine bottle
had formerly contained shoe polish. This is an autobiographical
reference to an unhappy period in Dickens’s life. When his father was
briefly imprisoned for debt, twelve-year-old Charles Dickens was sent to
work pasting labels on bottles in a blacking factory. When he fell ill,
his friend Bob Fagin tended him with doses of hot water in empty
blacking-bottles. Dickens unfairly rewarded his friend’s solicitude by
using his name for the villain in Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>11 (p. 85) from the Angel… into Saffron Hill the Great: Oliver and
the Artful Dodger entered London from the northeast; the Angel Inn at
Islington marked the city boundary. From there they followed a path
southeastward to the slums of the East End. Saffron Hill (present-day
Holborn) was a notorious haunt of thieves and prostitutes.</p>
<p>12 (p. 103) the renowned Mr. Fang: Fang is based on the notoriously
harsh London magistrate Allan Stewart Laing, whom Dickens had observed
in action while working on Oliver Twist in 1837. Among Laing’s more
outrageous sentences was his committal of three youths to a House of
Correction for singing in the street. After much public outcry, he was
removed from office in 1838.</p>
<p>13 (p. 141 ) the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry: The Police
Gazette or Hue and Cry, was the official London police magazine,
providing detailed information of crimes committed and criminals sought
and apprehended. No doubt Fagin read this magazine in order to keep one
step ahead of the police.</p>
<p>14 (p. 150) what you are?: Although Dickens explicitly identifies
Nancy as a prostitute in his preface to the third edition of Oliver
Twist (p. 13), her occupation is never more than implied in the pages of
the novel.</p>
<p>15 (p. 155) A legal action… about a settlement: According to the 1662
Act of Settlement and Removal, each parish was responsible for its own
indigent inhabitants but had no obligations to inhabitants of other
parishes. In questionable cases, parishes were eager to prove that
paupers were someone else’s responsibility. Bumble is escorting two
paupers to the courts at Clerkenwell in the hope that the magistrates
will establish their original settlement in a parish other than his
own.</p>
<p>16 (p. 188) Bethnal Green Road: Sikes and Oliver travel southwest
from the slums of Bethnal Green to the City (an area in the center of
London that lies within the boundaries of the ancient city) and then
through Smithfield meat market to the fashionable West End. From
Kensington they travel on foot and by cart to theThameside village of
Chertsey, about 25 miles west of London, in the county of Surrey.</p>
<p>17 (p. 204) out-of-door relief: Prior to the Poor Law Amendment Act
of 1834, paupers were given financial assistance in their own homes
under a system known as out-of-door relief This system became unpopular
because it encouraged employers to keep wages low, counting on the
parish to provide supplementary poor relief. After 1834 paupers were
required to commit themselves to the workhouse. Bumble, however, chooses
to reduce the burden on the workhouse by administering out-of-door
relief of such an inappropriate kind (for example, giving uncooked
potatoes to a naked and homeless man) that paupers “get tired of
coming.”</p>
<p>18 (p. 260) the runners: The forerunners of the London Metropolitan
Police were known as the Bow Street Runners. By the early nineteenth
century, the runners, a detective force originally set up by the
magistrates of Bow Street in 1749, were viewed as poorly trained and
inadequate for the task of policing the rapidly growing metropolis. They
were replaced in 1839 by a professional police force instituted by Sir
Robert Peel.</p>
<p>19 (p. 360) one brief and a motion: A brief is a case as a barrister,
and a motion an application for a court ruling; the meaning is that
Grimwig was unable to obtain much work as a lawyer.</p>
<p>20 (p. 365) homeopathic doses: Homeopathy, a form of medicine first
practiced in the late eighteenth century, is founded on the principle
that like cures like. Diseases are treated by the administration of
minute doses of a substance that would cause healthy subjects to display
symptoms of the disease. However, the tiny amounts of beef and porter
given to Charlotte by Noah Claypole signify the latter’s gluttony rather
than any concern for his girlfriend’s health.</p>
<p>21 (p. 375) transportation for life: Convicts were transported to
Australia and other British colonies to serve out their sentences, or
for life; the practice ended in 1863.</p>
<p>22 (p. 408) struck her down: Dickens’s dramatic rendering of this
scene became the most celebrated of his public readings, and one in
which the author clearly took a ghoulish glee. His son and some of his
friends believed that the emotional intensity of Dickens’s frequent
performances of “ikes and Nancy” contributed to his early death.</p>
<p>23 (p. 409) such flesh, and so much blood!: This passage recalls Lady
Macbeth’s sleepwalking scene in Shakespeare’s Macbeth (act 5, scene 1):
“ut, damned spot! Out, I say! … Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him?”</p>
<p>24 (p. 409) the stone in honour of Whittington: Richard (Dick)
Whittington (1358-1423) was a merchant and famous Lord Mayor of London.
Whittington came to London as a young boy, determined to seek his
fortune. When he discovered that the streets of the capital were not, in
fact, paved with gold, young Dick decided to go home. The monument on
Highgate Hill marks the spot where, according to the rags-to-riches
legend, the boy heard a chorus of London church bells calling him to
return and prophesying his bright future: “urn again, Whittington, Lord
Mayor of London.”</p>
<p>25 (p. 457) Those dreadful walls of Newgate: Dickens was familiar
with Newgate, including the condemned cell, having visited the prison in
November 1835. He recorded his impressions in “ Visit to Newgate,”
published in Sketches by Boz (1836).</p>
<p>INSPIRED BY OLIVER TWIST</p>
<p>Orphan Oliver Twist, it seems, finds no difficulty in being welcomed
into the movie theater. In the early twentieth century, the American
film industry produced a string of silent cinematic versions. The first
was A Modern Oliver Twist (1906); others, all titled Oliver Twist, were
released in 1909, 1912, 1916, and 1922. Oliver Twist, Jr. came out in
1921, and Germany released a version in 1920. In 1933 Oliver entered the
sound era, though with little initial success.</p>
<p>David Lean’s Oliver Twist</p>
<p>The first truly acclaimed film was director David Lean’s gloomy 1948
adaptation. Lean, who had directed Dickens’s Great Expectations (1946)
and who would direct the epic Lawrence of Arabia (1962), depicts a damp
and dingy London in all its gruesome vitality; amid thunder and rain,
the film opens with a woman on the verge of labor, staggering toward
shelter. Oliver is played by the eight-year-old and decidedly waifish
John Howard Davies, who embodies the pathos and vulnerability of the
street urchin to perfection. (Davies would go on to produce early
episodes of the BBC’s classic TV comedy series Monty Python’s Flying
Circus.) Twenty-two-year-old Alec Guinness plays the master pickpocket
Fagin. Shot in a nightmarish style that enhances Dickens’s bleak story,
the film was perhaps too dark and realistic for its time, and Lean’s
Oliver Twist was not immediately recognized by critics. Later, however,
it attained cult classic status and now is widely considered to be among
the greatest British films.</p>
<p>Lionel Bart’s and Sir Carol Reed’s Oliver!</p>
<p>Many children first encounter Dickens’s famous orphan through the
musical Oliver!, by British composer Lionel Bart, and its film version,
by Carol Reed. Oliver! premiered in London in 1960 and opened on
Broadway in 1963, running to 774 performances in New York. Bart, who
wrote the book, lyrics, and music, freely adapted Dickens’s novel and
did away with much of the despair. The result made him famous. The
catchy score includes such tunes as “Where Is Love?,” “Consider
Yourself,” and “You’ve Got to Pick a Pocket or Two.” In 1963 Oliver! was
nominated for Musical of the Year, and Bart won a Tony for his
score.</p>
<p>Five years later, director Carol Reed (The Third Man) adapted the
musical for film. Following Bart’s lead, Reed focused on the
light-hearted aspects of the story, and the energy level remains
remarkably high throughout the film. It opens, like the musical, in the
dark and dreary workhouse, where Oliver and his orphan retinue sing a
rousing “Food, Glorious Food” as a prelude to Oliver’s celebrated
utterance “Please, sir, I want some more.” Once beyond the workhouse,
Oliver! bursts with color. Nineteenth-century London is beautifully
rendered, and each musical sequence seems to improve on the previous
one.</p>
<p>Oliver is played by an especially innocent Mark Lester. Ron Moody, as
a crusty Fagin, and Jack Wild, as the Artful Dodger, earned Oscars for
their performances. Oliver Reed, Carol’s nephew, menacingly portrays
Bill Sikes.</p>
<p>The success of Carol Reed’s Oliver! was so overwhelming that its
recognition eclipsed that of the original musical. Nominated for eleven
Academy Awards, the film took home six, including Oscars for Best
Picture, Best Director, and Best Score.</p>
<p>Recent Film and TV Versions</p>
<p>After the success of the Lean and Reed films, Disney perceived
audiences as asking for some more and released a cartoon musical Oliver
andandandand Company (1988) that features the popular musical and vocal
talents of Billy Joel, Huey Lewis, and Bette Midler. There have been
several television adaptations. Clive Donner directed a British version
in 1982, with George C. Scott as Fagin and Tim Curry as Bill Sikes. A
British miniseries appeared in 1985. Tony Bill’s version of 1997, also
produced by Disney, has Richard Dreyfuss as Fagin and Elijah Wood
playing the Artful Dodger. The BBC offered another miniseries version in
1999.</p>
<p>COMMENTS andandandand QUESTIONS</p>
<p>In this section, we aim to provide the reader with an array of
perspectives on the text, as well as questions that challenge those
perspectives. The commentary has been culled from sources as diverse as
reviews contemporaneous with the work, letters written by the author,
literary criticism of later generations, and appreciations written
throughout history. Following the commentary, a series of questions
seeks to filter Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist through a variety of
points of view and bring about a richer understanding of this enduring
work.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>JOHN FORSTER</p>
<p>The story of Oliver Twist, so far as it has yet proceeded, is its
author’s masterpiece, and mean as the subject appears to be—the account
of the Progress of a Parish Boy—promises to take its place among the
higher prose fictions of the language.</p>
<p>—from an unsigned article in the Examiner (September 10, 1837)</p>
<p>THE SPECTATOR</p>
<p>That [Charles Dickens] exhibits genius in embodying London character,
and very remarkable skill in making use of peculiarities of expression,
even to the current phrase of the day, is undoubtedly true; but he has
higher merits, and other elements of success. His powers of pathos,
sadly touching rather than tearful, are great; he has a hearty sympathy
with humanity, however degraded by vice or disguised by circumstances,
and a quick perception to detect the existence of the good, however
overlaid; his truth and nature in dialogue are conspicuous to all; he
has the great art of bringing the actors and incidents before the reader
by a few effective strokes; though deficient in narrative, his
description is sometimes nicely true, and often powerful; and his
command of language considerable, without his style ever appearing
forced. In addition to these qualities, he has a manly
self-reliance—above all pretence, and all conventional servilities of
classes and coteries; nor does he ever, with a sickly vanity, obtrude
himself upon the reader’s attention. Above all, he has genius to vivify
his observation.</p>
<p>—November 24, 1838</p>
<p>RICHARD FORD</p>
<p>[Oliver Twist] deals with the outcasts of humanity, who do their
dirty work in work, pot, and watch houses, to finish on the Newgate
drop. Alas! for the Horatian precept, ‘Virginibus puerisque canto.’ The
happy ignorance of innocence is disregarded. Our youth should not even
suspect the possibility of such hidden depths of guilt, for their tender
memories are wax to receive and marble to retain. These infamies feed
the innate evil principle, which luxuriates in the supernatural and
horrid, the dread and delight of our childhood, which is never shaken
off, for no man entirely outlives the nursery. We object to the
familiarising our ingenuous youth with ‘slang;’ it is based in travestie
of better things…. The jests and jeers of the ‘slangers’ leave a sting
behind them. They corrupt pure taste and pervert morality, for vice
loses shame when treated as a fool-born joke, and those who are not
ashamed to talk of a thing will not be long ashamed to put it into
practice.</p>
<p>—from an unsigned article in the Quarterly Review (1839)</p>
<p>WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY</p>
<p>No one has read that remarkable tale of Oliver Twist without being
interested in poor Nancy and her murderer; and especially amused and
tickled by the gambols of the Artful Dodger and his companions. The
power of the writer is so amazing, that the reader at once becomes his
captive, and must follow him whithersoever he leads; and to what are we
led? Breathless to watch all the crimes of Fagin, tenderly to deplore
the errors of Nancy, to have for Bill Sikes a kind of pity and
admiration, and an absolute love for the society of the Dodger. All
these heroes stepped from the novel on to the stage; and the whole
London public, from peers to chimney-sweeps, were interested about a set
of ruffians whose occupations are thievery, murder, and prostitution. A
most agreeable set of rascals, indeed, who have their virtues, too, but
not good company for any man. We had better pass them by in decent
silence; for, as no writer can or dare tell the whole truth concerning
them, and faithfully explain their vices, there is no need to give ex
parte statements of their virtues.</p>
<p>—from Catherine (1839-1840)</p>
<p>JOHN RUSKIN</p>
<p>The reader will perhaps be surprised at my separating the greatest
work of Dickens, Oliver Twist, with honour, from the loathsome mass to
which it typically belongs. That book is an earnest and uncaricatured
record of states of criminal life, written with didactic purpose, full
of the gravest instruction, nor destitute of pathetic studies of noble
passion.</p>
<p>—from the Nineteenth Century (June 1880)</p>
<p>G. K. CHESTERTON</p>
<p>Relative to the other works of Dickens “Oliver Twist” is not of great
value, but it is of great importance. Some parts of it are so crude and
of so clumsy a melodrama, that one is almost tempted to say that Dickens
would have been greater without it. But even if he had been greater
without it he would still have been incomplete without it. With the
exception of some gorgeous passages, both of humour and horror, the
interest of the book lies not so much in its revelation of Dickens’s
literary genius as in its revelation of those moral, personal, and
political instincts which were the make-up of his character and the
permanent support of that literary genius. It is by far the most
depressing of all his books; it is in some ways the most irritating; yet
its ugliness gives the last touch of honesty to all that spontaneous and
splendid output. Without this one discordant note all his merriment
might have seemed like levity.</p>
<p>—from Chesterton’s Introduction to Oliver Twist (1907)</p>
<p>GEORGE ORWELL</p>
<p>In Oliver Twist, Hard Times, Bleak House, Little Dorrit, Dickens
attacked English institutions with a ferocity that has never since been
approached. Yet he managed to do it without making himself hated, and,
more than this, the very people he attacked have swallowed him so
completely that he has become a national institution himself</p>
<p>—from Dickens, Dali, and Others (1946)</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>William Makepeace Thackeray imagines the reader “breathless to
watch all the crimes of Fagin, tenderly to deplore the errors of Nancy,
to have for Bill Sikes a kind of pity and admiration, and an absolute
love for the society of the Dodger.” In all, Thackeray finds them “a
most agreeable set of rascals.” Richard Ford, on the other hand, felt
that these rascals, even in fiction, were corrupters of the young—“Our
youth should not even suspect the possibility of such hidden depths of
guilt”; these rascals “corrupt pure tastes and pervert morality.” Who’s
right? How does Ford’s criticism pertain to debates raging today over
children’s access to negative influences via television, film, and the
Internet?</p></li>
<li><p>A number of critics have observed that in Dickens’s settings,
things often have more life in them than the characters. The settings
are vivid, active agents, bursting with energy—they seem ready to make
things happen. The characters, on the other hand, are either stock male
and female leads or machinelike assemblages of repetitive gestures,
phrases, and attitudes that they are doomed to repeat every time they
appear. Are these critics being fair? Does Oliver Twist contain any
settings that seem to you particularly powerful or effective? How
effective are the characters in Oliver Twist?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any sense in which it would be accurate to call Dickens
“realistic”?</p></li>
<li><p>In 1883 Anthony Trollope described Dickens as “probably the most
