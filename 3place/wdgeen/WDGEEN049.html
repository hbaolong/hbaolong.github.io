XLIV The time arrives for Nancy to redeem her pledge to Rose Maylie. She
fails.</h4>
<p>Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the
girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowl edge of
the step she had taken wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both
the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which
had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was
trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those
schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were
her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and
deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;
still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting,
lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so
long eluded, and he should fall at last—richly as he merited such a
fate—by her hand.</p>
<p>But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach
itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix
itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by
any consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful
inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated
that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which
could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a
refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompassed her—and what
more could she do! She was resolved.</p>
<p>Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they
forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too.
She grew pale and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no
heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where
once, she would have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed
without merriment, and was noisy without cause or meaning. At
others—often within a moment afterwards—she sat silent and dejected,
brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which
she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications,
that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with
matters very ditierent and distant trom those in course of discussion by
her companions.</p>
<p>It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the
hour. Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The
girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened
too. Eleven.</p>
<p>“An hour this side of midnight,” said Sikes, raising the blind to
look out and returning to his seat. “Dark and heavy it is too. A good
night for business this.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” replied Fagin. “What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there’s none
quite ready to be done.”</p>
<p>“You’re right for once,” replied Sikes gruffly. “It is a pity, for
I’m in the humour too.”</p>
<p>Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.</p>
<p>“We must make up for lost time when we’ve got things into a good
train. That’s all I know,” said Sikes.</p>
<p>“That’s the way to talk, my dear,” replied Fagin, venturing to pat
him on the shoulder. “It does me good to hear you.”</p>
<p>“Does you good does it!” cried Sikes. “Well, so be it.”</p>
<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this
concession. “You’re like yourself to-night, Bill! Quite like
yourself.”</p>
<p>“I don’t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my
shoulder, so take it away,” said Sikes casting off the Jew’s hand.</p>
<p>“It makes you nervous, Bill—reminds you of being nabbed, does it?”
said Fagin, determined not to be offended.</p>
<p>“Reminds of me being nabbed by the devil,” returned Sikes. “There
never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your
father, and I suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this
time, unless you came straight from the old ’un without any father at
all betwixt you; which I shouldn’t wonder at, a bit.”</p>
<p>Fagin offered no reply to this compliment; but, pulling Sikes by the
sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the
foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the
room.</p>
<p>“Hallo!” cried Sikes. “Nance. Where’s the gal going to at this time
of night?”</p>
<p>“Not far.”</p>
<p>“What answer’s that?” returned Sikes. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I say, not far.”</p>
<p>“And I say where?” retorted Sikes. “Do you hear me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know where,” replied the girl.</p>
<p>“Then I do,” said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinancy than
because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.
“Nowhere. Sit down.”</p>
<p>“I’m not well. I told you that before,” rejoined the girl. “I want a
breath of air.”</p>
<p>“Put your head out of the winder,” replied Sikes.</p>
<p>“There’s not enough there,” said the girl. “I want it in the
street.”</p>
<p>“Then you won’t have it,” replied Sikes. With which assurance he
rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her
head, flung it up to the top of an old press.cn “There,” said the
robber. “Now stop quietly where you are, will you?”</p>
<p>“It’s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,” said the girl
turning very pale. “What do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you’re
doing?”</p>
<p>“Know what I’m—Oh!” cried Sikes turning to Fagin, “she’s out of her
senses, you know, or she daren’t talk to me in that way.”</p>
<p>“You’ll drive me on to something desperate,” muttered the girl,
placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some
violent outbreak. “Let me go, will you,—this minute—this instant.”</p>
<p>“No!” said Sikes.</p>
<p>“Tell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It’ll be better for
him. Do you hear me?” cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.</p>
<p>“Hear you!” repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront
her. “Aye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall
have such a grip on your throat as’ll tear some of that screaming voice
out. Wot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?”</p>
<p>“Let me go,” said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting
herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, “Bill, let me go;
you don’t know what you are doing. You don’t, indeed. For only one
hour—do—do!”</p>
<p>“Cut my limbs off one by one!” cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by
the arm, “if I don’t think the gal’s stark raving mad. Get up.”</p>
<p>“Not till you let me go—not till you let me go—Never—never!” screamed
the girl. Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and
suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with
him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a
bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. She
struggled and implored by turns until twelve o’clock had struck, and
then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.
With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out
that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.</p>
<p>“Whew!” said the housebreaker, wiping the perspiration from his face.
“Wot a precious strange gal that is!”</p>
<p>“You may say that, Bill,” replied Fagin thoughtfully. “You may say
that.”</p>
<p>“Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you
think?” asked Sikes. “Come; you should know her better than me. Wot does
it mean?”</p>
<p>“Obstinancy; woman’s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose it is,” growled Sikes. “I thought I had tamed her,
but she’s as bad as ever.”</p>
<p>“Worse,” said Fagin thoughtfully. “I never knew her like this, for
such a little cause.”</p>
<p>“Nor I,” said Sikes. “I think she’s got a touch of that fever in her
blood yet, and it won’t come out—eh?”</p>
<p>“Like enough.”</p>
<p>“I’ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she’s
took that way again,” said Sikes.</p>
<p>Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.</p>
<p>“She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was
stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept
yourself aloof,” said Sikes. “We was very poor too, all the time, and I
think, one way or other, it’s worried and fretted her; and that being
shut up here so long has made her restless—eh?”</p>
<p>“That’s it, my dear,” replied the Jew in a whisper. “Hush!”</p>
<p>As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her
former seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and
fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Why, now she’s on the other tack!” exclaimed Sikes, turning a look
of excessive surprise on his companion.</p>
<p>Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a
few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering
Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and
bade him good-night. He paused when he reached the room-door, and
looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark
stairs.</p>
<p>“Light him down,” said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. “It’s a pity
he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers. Show
him a light.”</p>
<p>Nancy followed the old man down stairs, with a candle. When they
reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to
the girl, said, in a whisper.</p>
<p>“What is it, Nancy, dear?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” replied the girl, in the same tone.</p>
<p>“The reason of all this,” replied Fagin. “If he”—he pointed with his
skinny fore-finger up the stairs—“is so hard with you (he’s a brute,
Nance, a brute-beast), why don’t you—”</p>
<p>“Well?” said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost
touching her ear, and his ears looking into hers.</p>
<p>“No matter just now. We’ll talk of this again. You have a friend in
me, Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close.
If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog—like a dog! worse
than his dog, for he humours him sometimes—come to me. I say, come to
me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.”</p>
<p>“I know you well,” replied the girl, without manifesting the least
emotion. “Good night.”</p>
<p>She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said
good night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look
with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.</p>
<p>Fagin walked towards his own home, intent upon the thoughts that were
working within his brain. He had conceived the idea—not from what had
just passed, though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by
degrees—that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker’s brutality, had
conceived an attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her
repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the
interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added
to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a
particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him
at least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this new liking was
not among his myrmidons. co He would be a valuable acquisition with such
an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without
delay.</p>
<p>There was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too
much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the
wounds were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off,
she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely
wreaked—to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life—on the
object of her more recent fancy. “With a little persuasion,” thought
Fagin, “what more likely than that she would consent to poison him?
Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before
now. There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another
secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge
of this crime to back it, unlimited.”</p>
<p>These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time
he sat alone, in the housebreaker’s room; and with them uppermost in his
thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of
sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There was
no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand
his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at parting
showed that.</p>
<p>But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes,
and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. “How,” thought Fagin,
as he crept homeward, “can I increase my influence with her? what new
power can I acquire?”</p>
<p>Such brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a
confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her
altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of
whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs,
could he not secure her compliance?</p>
<p>“I can,” said Fagin, almost aloud. “She durst not refuse me then. Not
for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and
shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!”</p>
<p>He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand,
towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his
way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which
he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy
crushed with every motion of his fingers.</p>
