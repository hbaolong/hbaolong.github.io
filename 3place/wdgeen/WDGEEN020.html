XV Showing how very fond of Oliver Twist the merry old Jew and Miss
Nancy were.</h4>
<p>In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part
of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas light
burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in
the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small
glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a
velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, who even by that
dim light no experienced agent of police would have hesitated to
recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet sat a white-coated, red-eyed
dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with
both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one
side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent
conflict.</p>
<p>“Keep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!” said Mr. Sikes, suddenly
breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be
disturbed by the dog’s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought
upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from
kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and
consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a
curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.</p>
<p>Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by
their masters; but Mr. Sikes’s dog, having faults of temper in common
with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful
sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of
the half-boots. Having given it a hearty shake, he retired, growling,
under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled
at his head.</p>
<p>“You would, would you?” said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand,
and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife, which he
drew from his pocket. “Come here, you born devil! Come here! D’ye
hear?”</p>
<p>The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest
key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some
unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he
was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping
the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild
beast.</p>
<p>This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on
his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped
from right to left, and from left to right: snapping, growling, and
barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the
struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the
door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the
poker and the clasp knife in his hands.</p>
<p>There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.
Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog’s participation, at once
transferred his share in the quarrel to the new-comer.</p>
<p>“What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?” said
Sikes, with a fierce gesture.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know, my dear, I didn’t know,” replied Fagin, humbly; for
the Jew was the new-comer.</p>
<p>“Didn’t know, you white-livered thief!” growled Sikes. “Couldn’t you
hear the noise?”</p>
<p>“Not a sound of it, as I’m a living man, Bill,” replied the Jew.</p>
<p>“Oh no! You hear nothing, you don’t,” retorted Sikes with a fierce
sneer. “Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I
wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.</p>
<p>“Why?” inquired the Jew with a forced smile.</p>
<p>“’Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as
haven’t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,”
replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;
“that’s why.”</p>
<p>The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to
laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at
ease, however.</p>
<p>“Grin away,” said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with
savage contempt; “grin away. You’ll never have the laugh at me, though,
unless it’s behind a night-cap.aq I’ve got the upper hand over you,
Fagin; and, d—me, I’ll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of
me.”</p>
<p>“Well, well, my dear,” said the Jew, “I know all that; we—we—have a
mutual interest, Bill,—a mutual interest.”</p>
<p>“Humph,” said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on
the Jew’s side than on his. “Well, what have you got to say to me?”</p>
<p>“It’s all passed safe through the melting-pot,” replied Fagin, “and
this is your share. It’s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but
as I know you’ll do me a good turn another time, and—”</p>
<p>“Stow that gammon,” interposed the robber, impatiently. “Where is it?
Hand over!”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,” replied the Jew,
soothingly. “Here it is! All safe!” As he spoke, he drew forth an old
cotton handkerchief from his breast, and untying a large knot in one
corner, produced a small brownpaper packet. Sikes, snatching it from
him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it
contained.</p>
<p>“This is all, is it?” inquired Sikes.</p>
<p>“All,” replied the Jew.</p>
<p>“You haven’t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
along, have you?” inquired Sikes, suspiciously. “Don’t put on an injured
look at the question; you’ve done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.”</p>
<p>These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the
bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as
vile and repulsive in appearance.</p>
<p>Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly
understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a
remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in
expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the
action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third
person. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie
the boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the
brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no
good to him.</p>
<p>“Is anybody here, Barney?” inquired Fagin; speaking, now that Sikes
was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.</p>
<p>“Dot a shoul,” replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from
the heart or not: made their way through the nose.</p>
<p>“Nobody?” inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might
mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.</p>
<p>“Dobody but Biss Dadsy,” replied Barney.</p>
<p>“Nancy!” exclaimed Sikes. “Where? Strike me blind, if I don’t honour
that ’ere girl, for her native talents.”</p>
<p>“She’s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,” replied
Barney.</p>
<p>“Send her here,” said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. “Send her
here.”</p>
<p>Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew
remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired;
and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the
bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.</p>
<p>“You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?” inquired Sikes, proffering
the glass.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am, Bill,” replied the young lady, disposing of its contents;
“and tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat’s been ill and
confined to the crib; and—”</p>
<p>“Ah, Nancy, dear!” said Fagin, looking up.</p>
<p>Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew’s red eyebrows, and a
half-closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was
disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.
The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she
suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon
Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten
minutes’ time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which
Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to
go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way
himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away
together, followed, at a little distance, by the dog, who slunk out of a
back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.</p>
<p>The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;
looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched
fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, re-seated
himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the
interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.13</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very
short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the
book-stall. When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidentally turned down a
bye-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his
mistake until he had got halfway down it, and knowing it must lead in
the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and
so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.</p>
<p>He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to
feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick,
who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment;
when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud, “Oh, my
dear brother!” And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was,
when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his
neck.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” cried Oliver, struggling. “Let go of me. Who is it? What are
you stopping me for?”</p>
<p>The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from
the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a
street-door key in her hand.</p>
<p>“Oh my gracious!” said the young woman, “I’ve found him! Oh! Oliver!
Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer sich distress on your
account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I’ve found him. Thank gracious
goodness heavins, I’ve found him!” With these incoherent exclamations,
the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully
hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
butcher’s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also
looking on, whether he didn’t think he had better run for the doctor. To
which, the butcher’s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say
indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, never mind,” said the young woman, grasping Oliver’s
hand; “I’m better now. Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, ma’am?” inquired one of the women.</p>
<p>“Oh, ma’am,” replied the young woman, “he ran away, near a month ago,
from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went
and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his
mother’s heart.”</p>
<p>“Young wretch!” said one woman.</p>
<p>“Go home, do, you little brute,” said the other.</p>
<p>“I am not,” replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. “I don’t know her. I
haven’t any sister, or father and mother either. I’m an orphan; I live
at Pentonville.”</p>
<p>“Only hear him, how he braves it out!” cried the young woman.</p>
<p>“Why, it’s Nancy!” exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the
first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.</p>
<p>“You see he knows me!” cried Nancy, appealing to the by-standers. “He
can’t help himself Make him come home, there’s good people, or he’ll
kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!”</p>
<p>“What the devil’s this?” said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop,
with a white dog at his heels; “young Oliver! Come home to your poor
mother, you young dog! Come home directly.”</p>
<p>“I don’t belong to them. I don’t know them. Help! help!” cried
Oliver, struggling in the man’s powerful grasp.</p>
<p>“Help!” repeated the man. “Yes; I’ll help you, you young rascal! What
books are these? You’ve been a stealing ’em, have you? Give ’em here.”
With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck
him on the head.</p>
<p>“That’s right!” cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. “That’s the
only way of bringing him to his senses!”</p>
<p>“To be sure!” cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving
look at the garret-window.</p>
<p>“It’ll do him good!” said the two women.</p>
<p>“And he shall have it, too!” rejoined the man, administering another
blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. “Come on, you young villain!
Here, Bull’s-eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!”</p>
<p>Weak with recent illness; stupefied by the blows and the suddenness
of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the
brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the by-standers
that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be;
what could one poor child do? Darkness had set in; it was a low
neighbourhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. In another
moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was
forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to
give utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed,
whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for
them, had they been ever so plain.</p>
<p>The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the
open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if
there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,
perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.</p>
