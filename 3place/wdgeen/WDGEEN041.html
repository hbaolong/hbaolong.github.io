XXXVI Is a very short one, and may appear of no great importance in its
place. But it should be read, notwithstanding, as a sequel to the last,
and a key to one that will follow when its time arrives.</h4>
<p>And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning;
eh?” said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the
breakfast-table. ”Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two
half-hours together!”</p>
<p>“You will tell me a different tale one of these days,” said Harry,
colouring without any perceptible reason.</p>
<p>“I hope I may have good cause to do so,” replied Mr. Losberne;
“though I confess I don’t think I shall. But yesterday morning you had
made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your
mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce
that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I
go, on your road to London. And at night, you urge me, with great
mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of
which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he
ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds.
Too bad, isn’t it, Oliver?”</p>
<p>“I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and
Mr. Maylie went away, sir,” rejoined Oliver.</p>
<p>“That’s a fine fellow,” said the doctor; “you shall come and see me
when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication
from the great nobsbv produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be
gone?”</p>
<p>“The great nobs,” replied Harry, “under which designation, I presume,
you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all,
since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that
anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among
them.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the doctor, “you are a queer fellow. But of course they
will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these
sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life.
There’s something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether
the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.”</p>
<p>Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short
dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not
a little; but he contented himself with saying, “We shall see,” and
pursued the subject no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door
shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor
bustled out, to see it packed.</p>
<p>“Oliver,” said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, “let me speak a word
with you.”</p>
<p>Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned
him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits,
which his whole behaviour displayed.</p>
<p>“You can write well now?” said Harry, laying his hand upon his
arm.</p>
<p>“I hope so, sir,” replied Oliver.</p>
<p>“I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you
would write to me—say once a fortnight: every alternate Monday: to the
General Post Office in London. Will you?”</p>
<p>“Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,” exclaimed Oliver,
greatly delighted with the commission.</p>
<p>“I should like to know how—how my mother and Miss Maylie are,” said
the young man; “and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you
take, and what you talk about, and whether she—they, I mean—seem happy
and quite well. You understand me?”</p>
<p>“Oh! quite, sir, quite,” replied Oliver.</p>
<p>“I would rather you did not mention it to them,” said Harry, hurrying
over his words; “because it might make my mother anxious to write to me
oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret
between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon
you.”</p>
<p>Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance,
faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.
Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and
protection.</p>
<p>The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged,
should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the
women-servants were in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight
glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.</p>
<p>“Drive on!” he cried, “hard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of
flying will keep pace with me, to-day.”</p>
<p>“Holloa!” cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great
hurry, and shouting to the postillion;bw “something very short of flying
will keep pace with me. Do you hear?”</p>
<p>Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible,
and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound
its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly
disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or
the intricacies of the way, permitted. It was not until even the dusty
cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.</p>
<p>And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the
spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles
away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view
when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.</p>
<p>“He seems in high spirits and happy,” she said, at length. “I feared
for a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very
glad.”</p>
<p>Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed
down Rose’s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in
the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.</p>
