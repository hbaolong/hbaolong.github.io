<h4 id="preface-to-the-charles-dickens-edition-1867">PREFACE TO THE
CHARLES DICKENS EDITION 1867</h4>
<p>Once upon a time it was held to be a coarse and shocking circumstance
that some of the characters in these pages are chosen from the most
criminal and degraded of London’s population.</p>
<p>As I saw no reason, when I wrote this book, why the dregs of life (so
long as their speech did not offend the ear) should not serve the
purpose of a moral, as well as its froth and cream, I made bold to
believe that this same Once upon a time would not prove to be All-time
or even a long time. I saw many strong reasons for pursuing my course. I
had read of thieves by scores; seductive fellows (amiable for the most
part), faultless in dress, plump in pocket, choice in horseflesh, bold
in bearing, fortunate in gallantry, great at a song, a bottle, pack of
cards or dice-box, and fit companions for the bravest. But I had never
met (except in Hogarth) with the miserable reality. It appeared to me
that to draw a knot of such associates in crime as really did exist; to
paint them in all their deformity, in all their wretchedness, in all the
squalid misery of their lives; to show them as they really were, for
ever skulking uneasily through the dirtiest paths of life, with the
great black ghastly gallows closing up their prospect, turn them where
they might; it appeared to me that to do this would be to attempt a
something which was needed and which would be a service to society. And
I did it as I best could.</p>
<p>In every book I know, where such characters are treated of,
allurements and fascinations are thrown around them. Even in the
Beggar’s Opera, the thieves are represented as leading a life which is
rather to be envied than otherwise; while Macheath, with all the
captivations of command, and the devotion of the most beautiful girl and
only pure character in the piece, is as much to be admired and emulated
by weak beholders as any fine gentleman in a red coat who has purchased,
as Voltaire says, the right to command a couple of thousand men or so
and to affront death at their head. Johnson’s question, whether any man
will turn thief because Macheath is reprieved, seems to me beside the
matter. I ask myself whether any man will be deterred from turning thief
because of Macheath’s being sentenced to death and because of the
existence of Peachum and Lockit; and remembering the captain’s roaring
life, great appearance, vast success, and strong advantages, I feel
assured that nobody having a bent that way will take any warning from
him, or will see anything in the play but a flowery and pleasant road,
conducting an honourable ambition—in course of time—to Tyburn Tree.</p>
<p>In fact, Gay’s witty satire on society had a general object which
made him quite regardless of example in this respect and gave him other
and wider aims. The same may be said of Sir Edward Bulwer’s admirable
and powerful novel of Paul Clifford, which cannot be fairly considered
as having, or as being intended to have, any bearing on this part of the
subject, one way or other.</p>
<p>What manner of life is that which is described in these pages as the
everyday existence of a Thief? What charms has it for the young and
ill-disposed, what allurements for the most jolter-headed of juveniles?
Here are no canterings on moonlit heaths, no merrymakings in the
snuggest of all possible caverns, none of the attractions of dress, no
embroidery, no lace, no jack-boots, no crimson coats and ruffles, none
of the dash and freedom with which “the road” has been time out of mind
invested. The cold, wet, shelterless midnight streets of London; the
foul and frowsy dens, where vice is closely packed and lacks the room to
turn; the haunts of hunger and disease; the shabby rags that scarcely
hold together—where are the attractions of these things?</p>
<p>There are people, however, of so refined and delicate a nature that
they cannot bear the contemplation of such horrors. Not that they turn
instinctively from crime, but that criminal characters, to suit them,
must be like their meat, in delicate disguise. A Massaroni in green
velvet is an enchanting creature, but a Sikes in fustian is
insupportable. A Mrs. Massaroni, being a lady in short petticoats and a
fancy dress, is a thing to imitate in tableaux and have in lithograph on
pretty songs; but a Nancy, being a creature in a cotton gown and cheap
shawl, is not to be thought of. It is wonderful how Virtue turns from
dirty stockings, and how Vice, married to ribbons and a little gay
attire, changes her name, as wedded ladies do, and becomes Romance.</p>
<p>But as the stern truth, even in the dress of this (in novels) much
exalted race, was a part of the purpose of this book, I did not, for
these readers, abate one hole in the Dodger’s coat, or one scrap of
curl-paper in Nancy’s dishevelled hair. I had no faith in the delicacy
which could not bear to look upon them. I had no desire to make
proselytes among such people. I had no respect for their opinion, good
or bad, did not covet their approval, and did not write for their
amusement.</p>
<p>It has been observed of Nancy that her devotion to the brutal
housebreaker does not seem natural. And it has been objected to Sikes in
the same breath—with some inconsistency, as I venture to think—that he
is surely overdrawn, because in him there would appear to be none of
those redeeming traits which are objected to as unnatural in his
mistress. Of the latter objection I will merely remark that I fear there
are in the world some insensible and callous natures that do become
utterly and incurably bad. Whether this be so or not, of one thing I am
certain: that there are such men as Sikes, who, being closely followed
through the same space of time and through the same current of
circumstances, would not give, by the action of a moment, the faintest
indication of a better nature. Whether every gentler human feeling is
dead within such bosoms, or the proper chord to strike has rusted and is
hard to find, I do not pretend to know; but that the fact is as I state
it, I am sure.</p>
<p>It is useless to discuss whether the conduct and character of the
girl seems natural or unnatural, probable or improbable, right or wrong.
IT IS TRUE. Every man who has watched these melancholy shades of life
must know it to be so. From the first introduction of that poor wretch
to her laying her blood-stained head upon the robber’s breast, there is
not a word exaggerated or overwrought. It is emphatically God’s truth,
for it is the truth He leaves in such depraved and miserable breasts,
the hope yet lingering there, the last fair drop of water at the bottom
of the weed-choked well. It involves the best and worst shades of our
nature, much of its ugliest hues and something of its most beautiful; it
is a contradiction, an anomaly, an apparent impossibility; but it is a
truth. I am glad to have had it doubted, for in that circumstance I
should find a sufficient assurance (if I wanted any) that it needed to
be told.</p>
<p>In the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty it was publicly
declared in London by an amazing Alderman that Jacob’s Island did not
exist and never had existed. Jacob’s Island continues to exist (like an
ill-bred place as it is) in the year one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-seven, though improved and much changed.</p>
