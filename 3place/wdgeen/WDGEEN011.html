VI Oliver, being goaded by the taunts of Noah, rouses into action, and
rather astonishes him.</h4>
<p>The month’s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a
nice sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were
looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great
deal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry’s ingenious
speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest
inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so
prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful
processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to
his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the
mothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his
adult expeditions, too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity
of demeanour and full command of nerve which are essential to a finished
undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful
resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear
their trials and losses.</p>
<p>For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some
rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of
nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the
previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on
the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as
need be—quite cheerful and contented—conversing together with as much
freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them.
Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic
calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far
from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to
render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable,
too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during
the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached
home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All
this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with
great admiration.</p>
<p>That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these
good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm
with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for
many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and
ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now
that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black
stick and hat-band, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the
muffin-capy and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did;
and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was
disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a
glut of funerals on the other Oliver was not altogether as comfortable
as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain
department of a brewery.</p>
<p>And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver’s history; for
I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,
but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future
prospects and proceedings.</p>
<p>One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton—a pound and a half
of the worst end of the neck—when Charlotte being called out of the way,
there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry
and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier
purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the
table-cloth; and pulled Oliver’s hair; and twitched his ears; and
expressed his opinion that he was a “sneak;” and furthermore announced
his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event
should take place; and entered upon various other topics of petty
annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.
But, none of these taunts producing the desired effect of making Oliver
cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in this attempt, did
what many small wits, with far greater reputations than Noah, sometimes
do to this day, when they want to be funny. He got rather personal.</p>
<p>“Work’us,” said Noah, “how’s your mother?”</p>
<p>“She’s dead,” replied Oliver; “don’t you say anything about her to
me!”</p>
<p>Oliver’s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there
was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole
thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.
Under this impression he returned to the charge.</p>
<p>“What did she die of, Work’us?” said Noah.</p>
<p>“Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,” replied Oliver:
more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. “I think I
know what it must be to die of that!”</p>
<p>“Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work’us,” said Noah, as a tear
rolled down Oliver’s cheek. “What’s set you a snivelling now?”</p>
<p>“Not you,” replied Oliver, hastily brushing the tear away. “Don’t
think it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, not me, eh!” sneered Noah.</p>
<p>“No, not you,” replied Oliver, sharply. “There; that’s enough. Don’t
say anything more to me about her; you’d better not!”</p>
<p>“Better not!” exclaimed Noah. “Well! Better not! Work‘us, don’t be
impudent. Your mother, too! She was a nice ’un, she was. Oh, Lor!” And
here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his
small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the
occasion.</p>
<p>“Yer know, Work‘us,” continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver’s silence,
and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most
annoying: “Yer know, Work’us, it can’t be helped now; and of course yer
couldn’t help it then; and I’m very sorry for it; and I’m sure we all
are, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work‘us, yer mother was
a regular right-down bad ’un.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?” inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.</p>
<p>“A regular right-down bad ’un, Work’us,” replied Noah, coolly. “And
it’s a great deal better, Work’us, that she died when she did, or else
she’d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, z or transported, or hung;
which is more likely than either, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Crimson with fury, Oliver started up, overthrew the chair and table;
seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till
his teeth chattered in his head; and, collecting his whole force into
one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.</p>
<p>A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet, mild, dejected creature
that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused at last;
the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His
breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eyes bright and vivid; his
whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor
who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had
never known before.</p>
<p>Oliver plucks up a Spirit</p>
<p>“He’ll murder me!” blubbered Noah. “Charlotte! missis! Here’s the new
boy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver’s gone mad! Char—lotte!”</p>
<p>Noah’s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and
a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the
kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till
she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of
human life, to come further down.</p>
<p>“Oh, you little wretch!” screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her
utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man
in particularly good training. “Oh, you little un-grateful, mur-de-rous,
hor-rid villain!” And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a
blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit
of society.</p>
<p>Charlotte’s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not
be effectual in calming Oliver’s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the
kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his
face with the other. In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose
from the ground, and pommelled him behind.</p>
<p>This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all
wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,
struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and
there locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair,
and burst into tears.</p>
<p>“Bless her, she’s going off!” said Charlotte. “A glass of water,
Noah, dear. Make haste!”</p>
<p>“Oh! Charlotte,” said Mrs. Sowerberry; speaking as well as she could,
through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which
Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. “Oh! Charlotte, what a
mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!”</p>
<p>“Ah! mercy indeed, ma‘am,” was the reply. “I only hope this’ll teach
master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born
to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was
all but killed, ma’am, when I come in.”</p>
<p>“Poor fellow!” said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the
charity-boy.</p>
<p>Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level
with the crown of Oliver’s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his
wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed
some affecting tears and sniffs.</p>
<p>“What’s to be done!” exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. “Your master’s not at
home; there’s not a man in the house, and he’ll kick that door down in
ten minutes.” Oliver’s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in
question, rendered this occurrence highly probable.</p>
<p>“Dear, dear! I don’t know, ma’am,” said Charlotte, “unless we send
for the police-officers.”</p>
<p>“Or the millingtary,” suggested Mr. Claypole.</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver’s old
friend. “Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,
and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold
a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It’ll keep the swelling
down.”</p>
<p>Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed;
and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a
charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his
head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.</p>
