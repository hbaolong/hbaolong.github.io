<h4 id="preface-to-the-first-cheap-edition">PREFACE TO THE FIRST CHEAP
EDITION</h4>
<p>At page 267 of this present edition of Oliver Twist there is a de
scription of “the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordi nary of
the many localities that are hidden in London.” And the name of this
place is Jacob’s Island.</p>
<p>Eleven or twelve years have elapsed since the description was first
published. I was as well convinced then as I am now, that nothing
effectual can be done for the elevation of the poor in England until
their dwelling-places are made decent and wholesome. I have always been
convinced that this reform must precede all other Social Reforms; that
it must prepare the way for Education, even for Religion; and that,
without it, those classes of the people which increase the fastest must
become so desperate, and be made so miserable, as to bear within
themselves the certain seeds of ruin to the whole community.</p>
<p>The metropolis (of all places under heaven) being excluded from the
provisions of the Public Health Act passed last year, a society has been
formed called the Metropolitan Sanitary Association, with the view of
remedying this grievous mistake. The association held its first public
meeting at Freemason’s Hall on Wednesday the sixth of February last, the
Bishop of London presiding. It happened that this very place, Jacob’s
Island, had lately attracted the attention of the Board of Health, in
consequence of its having been ravaged by cholera; and that the Bishop
of London had in his hands the result of an inquiry under the
Metropolitan Sewers Commission, showing, by way of proof of the
cheapness of sanitary improvements, an estimate of the probable cost at
which the houses in Jacob’s Island could be rendered fit for human
habitation—which cost, as stated, was about a penny three farthings per
week per house. The Bishop referred to this paper with the moderation
and forbearance which pervaded all his observations, and did me the
honour to mention that I had described Jacob’s Island. When I
subsequently made a few observations myself, I confessed that soft
impeachment.</p>
<p>Now the vestry of Marylebone parish, meeting on the following
Saturday, had the honour to be addressed by Sir Peter Laurie, a
gentleman of infallible authority, of great innate modesty, and of a
most sweet humanity. This remarkable alderman, as I am informed by The
Observer newspaper, then and there delivered himself (I quote the
passage without any correction) as follows:</p>
<p>“Having touched upon the point of saving to the poor, he begged to
illustrate it by reading for them the particulars of a survey that had
been made in a locality called—‘Jacob’s Island’—(a laugh)—where,
according to the surveyor, 1300 houses were erected on forty acres of
ground. The surveyor asserted and laid down that each house could be
supplied with a constant supply of pure water—secondly, that each house
could be supplied with a sink—thirdly, a water-closet—fourthly, a
drain—fifthly, a foundation drain—and, sixthly, the accommodation of a
dust-bin (laughter), and all at the average rate of 13s. 4d. per week
(oh, oh, and laughter).</p>
<p>“Mr. G. Bird: Can Sir Peter Laurie tell the vestry where ‘Jacob’s
Island’ is? (laughter).</p>
<p>“Sir P Laurie: That was just what he was about to tell them. The
Bishop of London, poor soul, in his simplicity, thought there really was
such a place, which he had been describing so minutely, whereas it
turned out that it ONLY existed in a work of fiction, written by
Mr. Charles Dickens ten years ago (roars of laughter). The fact was
admitted by Mr. Charles Dickens himself at the meeting, and he (Sir P.
Laurie) had extracted his words from the same paper, the Morning Herald.
Mr. Dickens said, ‘Now the first of these classes proceeded generally on
the supposition that the compulsory improvement of these dwellings, when
exceedingly defective, would be very expensive. But that was a great
mistake, for nothing was cheaper than good sanitary improvements, as
they knew in this case of “Jacob’s Island” (laughter), which he had
described in a work of fiction some ten or eleven years ago.’”</p>
<p>When I came to read this I was so much struck by the honesty, by the
truth, and by the wisdom of this logic, as well as by the fact of the
sagacious vestry, including members of parliament, magistrates,
officers, chemists, and I know not who else listening to it meekly (as
became them), that I resolved to record the fact here as a certain means
of making it known to, and causing it to be reverenced by, many
thousands of people. Reflecting upon this logic and its universal
application; remembering that when Fielding described Newgate, the
prison immediately ceased to exist; that when Smollett took Roderick
Random to Bath, that city instantly sank into the earth; that when Scott
exercised his genius on Whitefriars, it incontinently glided into the
Thames; that an ancient place called Windsor was entirely destroyed in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth by two Merry Wives of that town, acting
under the direction of a person of the name of Shakespeare; and that
Mr. Pope, after having at a great expense completed his grotto at
Twickenham, incautiously reduced it to ashes by writing a poem upon it—I
say, when I came to consider these things, I was inclined to make this
preface the vehicle of my humble tribute of admiration to Sir Peter
Laurie. But I am restrained by a very painful consideration—by no less a
consideration than the impossibility of his existence. For Sir Peter
Laurie having been himself described in a book (as I understand he was,
one Christmas time, for his conduct on the seat of justice), it is but
too clear that there CAN be no such man!g</p>
<p>Otherwise, I should have been quite sure of his concurrence in the
following passage, written thirty years ago by my late lamented friend,
the Reverend Sydney Smith, that great master of wit, and terror of
noodles, but singularly applicable to the present occasion.</p>
<p>We have been thus particular in stating the case that we may make an
answer to those profligate persons who are always ready to fling an air
of ridicule upon the labours of humanity, because they are desirous that
what they have not the virtue to do themselves should appear to be
foolish and romantic when done by others. A still higher degree of
depravity than this is to want every sort of compassion for human misery
when it is accompanied by filth, poverty, and ignorance. To regulate
humanity by the income tax, and to deem the bodily wretchedness and the
dirty tears of the poor a fit subject for pleasantry and contempt. We
should have been loth to believe that such deep-seated and disgusting
immorality existed in these days, but the notice of it is forced upon
us.”</p>
