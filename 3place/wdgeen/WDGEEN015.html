X Oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new
associates; and purchases experience at a high price. Being a short, but
very important chapter, in this history.</h4>
<p>For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew’s room, picking the marks
out of the pocket-handkerchiefs, (of which a great num ber were brought
home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which
the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length, he
began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly
entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work, with his
two companions.</p>
<p>Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what
he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman’s character.
Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,
he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy
habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by
sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went so
far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying
out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.</p>
<p>At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so
eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or
three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these were
reasons for the old gentleman’s giving his assent; but, whether they
were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint
guardianship of Charley Bates. and his friend the Dodger.</p>
<p>The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked
up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his
hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were
going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,
first.</p>
<p>The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking
saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to
deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a
vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small
boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some
very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering
divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and
thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that
they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.
These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring
his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when
his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very
mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.</p>
<p>They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open
square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion
of terms, “The Green:” when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying
his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest
caution and circumspection.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Oliver.</p>
<p>“Hush!” replied the Dodger. “Do you see that old cove at the
book-stall?”</p>
<p>“The old gentleman over the way?” said Oliver. “Yes, I see him.”</p>
<p>“He’ll do,” said the Dodger.</p>
<p>“A prime plant,” observed Master Charley Bates.</p>
<p>Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but
he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked
stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman
towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces
after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking
on in silent amazement.</p>
<p>The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a
powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green coat
with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart
bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall, and
there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair,
in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied himself there,
indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the
book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but
the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the
leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of
the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and
eagerness.</p>
<p>What was Oliver’s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off,
looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to
see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman’s pocket, and draw
from thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates;
and finally to behold them, both, running away round the corner at full
speed.</p>
<p>In an instant the whole mystery of the handkerchiefs, and the
watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy’s mind. He
stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins
from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then,
confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he
did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.</p>
<p>This was all done in a minute’s space. In the very instant when
Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket,
and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy
scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to
be the depredator; and, shouting “Stop thief!” with all his might, made
off after him, book in hand.</p>
<p>But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the
hue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public
attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the
very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and
saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they
issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting “Stop thief!” too,
joined in the pursuit like good citizens.</p>
<p>Oliver amazed at the Dodger’s Mode of ‘going to work’</p>
<p>Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not
theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation
is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been
prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more;
so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys
roaring and shouting behind him.</p>
<p>“Stop thief! Stop thief!”There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman
leaves his counter, and the carman his waggon; the butcher throws down
his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his
parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviourah his pick-axe; the
child his battledore.ai Away they run, pell-mell, helterskelter,
slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as
they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls:
and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.</p>
<p>“Stop thief! Stop thief!” The cry is taken up by a hundred voices,
and the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing
through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows,
out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punchaj
in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell
the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, “Stop thief! Stop
thief!”</p>
<p>“Stop thief! Stop thief!” There is a passion for hunting something
deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child,
panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large
drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to
make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain
upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with still
louder shouts, and whoop and scream with joy. “Stop thief!” Ay, stop him
for God’s sake, were it only in mercy!</p>
<p>Stopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the
crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling
with the others to catch a glimpse. “Stand aside! “Give him a little
air!” “Nonsense! he don’t deserve it.” “Where’s the gentleman?” “Here he
is, coming down the street.” “Make room there for the gentleman!” “Is
this the boy, sir!” “Yes.”</p>
<p>Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,
looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when
the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by
the foremost of the pursuers.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the gentleman, “I am afraid it is the boy.”</p>
<p>“Afraid!” murmured the crowd. “That’s a good ’un!”</p>
<p>“Poor fellow!” said the gentleman, “he has hurt himself.”</p>
<p>“I did that, sir,” said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;
“and preciously I cut my knuckle agin’ his mouth. I stopped him,
sir.”</p>
<p>The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his
pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike,
looked anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself:
which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have
afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the
last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through
the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.</p>
<p>“Come, get up,” said the man, roughly.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,”
said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. “They
are here somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, they ain’t,” said the officer. He meant this to be ironical,
but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off
down the first convenient court they came to. “Come, get up!”</p>
<p>“Don’t hurt him,” said the old gentleman, compassionately.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I won’t hurt him,” replied the officer, tearing his jacket
half off his back, in proof thereof. “Come, I know you; it won’t do.
Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?”</p>
<p>Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his
feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at
a rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer’s side;
and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little a-head,
and stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in
triumph; and on they went.</p>
