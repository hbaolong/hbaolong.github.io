<h4 id="iv">IV</h4>
<p>I had a busy time in the office throughout the week. Raymond dropped
in once to tell me he’d sent off the letter. I went to the pictures
twice with Emmanuel, who doesn’t always understand what’s happening on
the screen and asks me to explain it. Yesterday was Saturday, and Marie
came as we’d arranged. She had a very pretty dress, with red and white
stripes, and leather sandals, and I couldn’t take my eyes off her. One
could see the outline of her firm little breasts, and her sun-tanned
face was like a velvety brown flower. We took the bus and went to a
beach I know, some miles out of Algiers. It’s just a strip of sand
between two rocky spurs, with a line of rushes at the back, along the
tide line. At four o’clock the sun wasn’t too hot, but the water was
pleasantly tepid, and small, languid ripples were creeping up the
sand.</p>
<p>Marie taught me a new game. The idea was, while one swam, to suck in
the spray off the waves and, when one’s mouth was full of foam, to lie
on one’s back and spout it out against the sky. It made a sort of frothy
haze that melted into the air or fell back in a warm shower on one’s
cheeks. But very soon my mouth was smarting with all the salt I’d drawn
in; then Marie came up and hugged me in the water, and pressed her mouth
to mine. Her tongue cooled my lips, and we let the waves roll us about
for a minute or two before swimming back to the beach.</p>
<p>When we had finished dressing, Marie looked hard at me. Her eyes were
sparkling. I kissed her; after that neither of us spoke for quite a
while. I pressed her to my side as we scrambled up the foreshore. Both
of us were in a hurry to catch the bus, get back to my place, and tumble
on to the bed. I’d left my window open, and it was pleasant to feel the
cool night air flowing over our sunburned bodies.</p>
<p>Marie said she was free next morning, so I proposed she should have
luncheon with me. She agreed, and I went down to buy some meat. On my
way back I heard a woman’s voice in Raymond’s room. A little later old
Salamano started grumbling at his dog and presently there was a sound of
boots and paws on the wooden stairs; then, “Filthy brute! Get on, you
cur!” and the two of them went out into the street. I told Marie about
the old man’s habits, and it made her laugh. She was wearing one of my
pajama suits, and had the sleeves rolled up. When she laughed I wanted
her again. A moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that sort
of question had no meaning, really; but I supposed I didn’t. She looked
sad for a bit, but when we were getting our lunch ready she brightened
up and started laughing, and when she laughs I always want to kiss her.
It was just then that the row started in Raymond’s room.</p>
<p>First we heard a woman saying something in a high-pitched voice; then
Raymond bawling at her, “You let me down, you bitch! I’ll learn you to
let me down!” There came some thuds, then a piercing scream—it made
one’s blood run cold—and in a moment there was a crowd of people on the
landing. Marie and I went out to see. The woman was still screaming and
Raymond still knocking her about. Marie said, wasn’t it horrible! I
didn’t answer anything. Then she asked me to go and fetch a policeman,
but I told her I didn’t like policemen. However, one turned up
presently; the lodger on the second floor, a plumber, came up, with him.
When he banged on the door the noise stopped inside the room. He knocked
again, and, after a moment, the woman started crying, and Raymond opened
the door. He had a cigarette dangling from his underlip and a rather
sickly smile.</p>
<p>“Your name?” Raymond gave his name. “Take that cigarette out of your
mouth when you’re talking to me,” the policeman said gruffly. Raymond
hesitated, glanced at me, and kept the cigarette in his mouth. The
policeman promptly swung his arm and gave him a good hard smack on the
left cheek. The cigarette shot from his lips and dropped a yard away.
Raymond made a wry face, but said nothing for a moment. Then in a humble
tone he asked if he mightn’t pick up his cigarette.</p>
<p>The officer said, “Yes,” and added: “But don’t you forget next time
that we don’t stand for any nonsense, not from guys like you.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile the girl went on sobbing and repeating: “He hit me, the
coward. He’s a pimp.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, officer,” Raymond put in, “but is that in order, calling
a man a pimp in the presence of witnesses?”</p>
<p>The policeman told him to shut his trap.</p>
<p>Raymond then turned to the girl. “Don’t you worry, my pet. We’ll meet
again.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough,” the policeman said, and told the girl to go away.
Raymond was to stay in his room till summoned to the police station.
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” the policeman added, “getting so
tight you can’t stand steady. Why, you’re shaking all over!”</p>
<p>“I’m not tight,” Raymond explained. “Only when I see you standing
there and looking at me, I can’t help trembling. That’s only
natural.”</p>
<p>Then he closed his door, and we all went away. Marie and I finished
getting our lunch ready. But she hadn’t any appetite, and I ate nearly
all. She left at one, and then I had a nap.</p>
<p>Toward three there was a knock at my door and Raymond came in. He sat
down on the edge of my bed and for a minute or two said nothing. I asked
him how it had gone off. He said it had all gone quite smoothly at
first, as per program; only then she’d slapped his face and he’d seen
red, and started thrashing her. As for what happened after that, he
needn’t tell me, as I was there.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “you taught her a lesson, all right, and that’s what
you wanted, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>He agreed, and pointed out that whatever the police did, that
wouldn’t change the fact she’d had her punishment. As for the police, he
knew exactly how to handle them. But he’d like to know if I’d expected
him to return the blow when the policeman hit him.</p>
<p>I told him I hadn’t expected anything whatsoever and, anyhow, I had
no use for the police. Raymond seemed pleased and asked if I’d like to
come out for a stroll with him. I got up from the bed and started
brushing my hair. Then Raymond said that what he really wanted was for
me to act as his witness. I told him I had no objection; only I didn’t
know what he expected me to say.</p>
<p>“It’s quite simple,” he replied. “You’ve only got to tell them that
the girl had let me down.”</p>
<p>So I agreed to be his witness.</p>
<p>We went out together, and Raymond stood me a brandy in a café. Then
we had a game of billiards; it was a close game and I lost by only a few
points. After that he proposed going to a brothel, but I refused; I
didn’t feel like it. As we were walking slowly back he told me how
pleased he was at having paid out his mistress so satisfactorily. He
made himself extremely amiable to me, and I quite enjoyed our walk.</p>
<p>When we were nearly home I saw old Salamano on the doorstep; he
seemed very excited. I noticed that his dog wasn’t with him. He was
turning like a teetotum, looking in all directions, and sometimes
peering into the darkness of the hall with his little bloodshot eyes.
Then he’d mutter something to himself and start gazing up and down the
street again. Raymond asked him what was wrong, but he didn’t answer at
once. Then I heard him grunt, “The bastard! The filthy cur!” When I
asked him where his dog was, he scowled at me and snapped out, “Gone!” A
moment later, all of a sudden, he launched out into it. “I’d taken him
to the Parade Ground as usual. There was a fair on, and you could hardly
move for the crowd. I stopped at one of the booths to look at the
Handcuff King. When I turned to go, the dog was gone. I’d been meaning
to get a smaller collar, but I never thought the brute could slip it and
get away like that.”</p>
<p>Raymond assured him the dog would find its way home, and told him
stories of dogs that had traveled miles and miles to get back to their
masters. But this seemed to make the old fellow even more worried than
before.</p>
<p>“Don’t you understand, they’ll do away with him; the police, I mean.
It’s not likely anyone will take him in and look after him; with all
those scabs he puts everybody off.”</p>
<p>I told him that there was a pound at the police station, where stray
dogs are taken. His dog was certain to be there and he could get it back
on payment of a small charge. He asked me how much the charge was, but
there I couldn’t help him. Then he flew into a rage again.</p>
<p>“Is it likely I’d give money for a mutt like that? No damned fear!
They can kill him, for all I care.” And he went on calling his dog the
usual names.</p>
<p>Raymond gave a laugh and turned into the hall. I followed him
upstairs, and we parted on the landing. A minute or two later I heard
Salamano’s footsteps and a knock on my door.</p>
<p>When I opened it, he halted for a moment in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Excuse me… I hope I’m not disturbing you.”</p>
<p>I asked him in, but he shook his head. He was staring at his toe
caps, and the gnarled old hands were trembling. Without meeting my eyes,
he started talking.</p>
<p>“They won’t really take him from me, will they, Monsieur Meursault?
Surely they wouldn’t do a thing like that. If they do—I don’t know what
will become of me.” I told him that, so far as I knew, they kept stray
dogs in the pound for three days, waiting for their owners to call for
them. After that they disposed of the dogs as they thought fit.</p>
<p>He stared at me in silence for a moment, then said, “Good evening.”
After that I heard him pacing up and down his room for quite a while.
Then his bed creaked. Through the wall there came to me a little
wheezing sound, and I guessed that he was weeping. For some reason, I
don’t know what, I began thinking of Mother. But I had to get up early
next day; so, as I wasn’t feeling hungry, I did without supper, and went
straight to bed.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Raymond rang me up at the office. He said that a friend of his—to
whom he’d spoken about me—invited me to spend next Sunday at his little
seaside bungalow just outside Algiers. I told him I’d have been
delighted; only I had promised to spend Sunday with a girl. Raymond
promptly replied that she could come, too. In fact, his friend’s wife
would be very pleased not to be the only woman in a party of men.</p>
<p>I’d have liked to hang up at once, as my employer doesn’t approve of
my using the office phone for private calls. But Raymond asked me to
hold on; he had something else to tell me, and that was why he’d rung me
up, though he could have waited till the evening to pass on the
invitation.</p>
<p>“It’s like this,” he said. “I’ve been shadowed all the morning by
some Arabs. One of them’s the brother of that girl I had the row with.
If you see him hanging round the house when you come back, pass me the
word.”</p>
<p>I promised to do so.</p>
<p>Just then my employer sent for me. For a moment I felt uneasy, as I
expected he was going to tell me to stick to my work and not waste time
chattering with friends over the phone. However, it was nothing of the
kind. He wanted to discuss a project he had in view, though so far he’d
come to no decision. It was to open a branch at Paris, so as to be able
to deal with the big companies on the spot, without postal delays, and
he wanted to know if I’d like a post there.</p>
<p>“You’re a young man,” he said, “and I’m pretty sure you’d enjoy
living in Paris.</p>
<p>And, of course, you could travel about France for some months in the
year.”</p>
<p>I told him I was quite prepared to go; but really I didn’t care much
one way or the other.</p>
<p>He then asked if a “change of life,” as he called it, didn’t appeal
to me, and I answered that one never changed his way of life; one life
was as good as another, and my present one suited me quite well.</p>
<p>At this he looked rather hurt, and told me that I always
shilly-shallied, and that I lacked ambition—a grave defect, to his mind,
when one was in business.</p>
<p>I returned to my work. I’d have preferred not to vex him, but I saw
no reason for “changing my life.” By and large it wasn’t an unpleasant
one. As a student I’d had plenty of ambition of the kind he meant. But,
when I had to drop my studies, I very soon realized all that was pretty
futile.</p>
<p>Marie came that evening and asked me if I’d marry her. I said I
didn’t mind; if she was keen on it, we’d get married.</p>
<p>Then she asked me again if I loved her. I replied, much as before,
that her question meant nothing or next to nothing—but I supposed I
didn’t.</p>
<p>“If that’s how you feel,” she said, “why marry me?”</p>
<p>I explained that it had no importance really, but, if it would give
her pleasure, we could get married right away. I pointed out that,
anyhow, the suggestion came from her; as for me, I’d merely said,
“Yes.”</p>
<p>Then she remarked that marriage was a serious matter.</p>
<p>To which I answered: “No.”</p>
<p>She kept silent after that, staring at me in a curious way. Then she
asked: “Suppose another girl had asked you to marry her—I mean, a girl
you liked in the same way as you like me—would you have said ‘Yes’ to
her, too?”</p>
<p>“Naturally.”</p>
<p>Then she said she wondered if she really loved me or not. I, of
course, couldn’t enlighten her as to that. And, after another silence,
she murmured something about my being “a queer fellow.” “And I daresay
that’s why I love you,” she added. “But maybe that’s why one day I’ll
come to hate you.”</p>
<p>To which I had nothing to say, so I said nothing.</p>
<p>She thought for a bit, then started smiling and, taking my arm,
repeated that she was in earnest; she really wanted to marry me.</p>
<p>“All right,” I answered. “We’ll get married whenever you like.” I
then mentioned the proposal made by my employer, and Marie said she’d
love to go to Paris.</p>
<p>When I told her I’d lived in Paris for a while, she asked me what it
was like.</p>
<p>“A dingy sort of town, to my mind. Masses of pigeons and dark
courtyards. And the people have washed-out, white faces.” Then we went
for a walk all the way across the town by the main streets. The women
were good-lookers, and I asked Marie if she, too, noticed this. She
said, “Yes,” and that she saw what I meant. After that we said nothing
for some minutes. However, as I didn’t want her to leave me, I suggested
we should dine together at Céleste’s. She’d have loved to dine with me,
she said, only she was booked up for the evening. We were near my place,
and I said, “Au revoir, then.”</p>
<p>She looked me in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to know what I’m doing this evening?”</p>
<p>I did want to know, but I hadn’t thought of asking her, and I guessed
she was making a grievance of it. I must have looked embarrassed, for
suddenly she started laughing and bent toward me, pouting her lips for a
kiss.</p>
<p>I went by myself to Céleste’s. When I had just started my dinner an
odd-looking little woman came in and asked if she might sit at my table.
Of course she might. She had a chubby face like a ripe apple, bright
eyes, and moved in a curiously jerky way, as if she were on wires. After
taking off her closefitting jacket she sat down and started studying the
bill of fare with a sort of rapt attention. Then she called Céleste and
gave her order, very fast but quite distinctly; one didn’t lose a word.
While waiting for the hors d’oeuvre she opened her bag, took out a slip
of paper and a pencil, and added up the bill in advance. Diving into her
bag again, she produced a purse and took from it the exact sum, plus a
small tip, and placed it on the cloth in front of her.</p>
<p>Just then the waiter brought the hors d’oeuvre, which she proceeded
to wolf down voraciously. While waiting for the next course, she
produced another pencil, this time a blue one, from her bag, and the
radio magazine for the coming week, and started making ticks against
almost all the items of the daily programs. There were a dozen pages in
the magazine, and she continued studying them closely throughout the
meal. When I’d finished mine she was still ticking off items with the
same meticulous attention. Then she rose, put on her jacket again with
the same abrupt, robot-like gestures, and walked briskly out of the
restaurant.</p>
<p>Having nothing better to do, I followed her for a short distance.
Keeping on the curb of the pavement, she walked straight ahead, never
swerving or looking back, and it was extraordinary how fast she covered
the ground, considering her smallness. In fact, the pace was too much
for me, and I soon lost sight of her and turned back homeward. For a
moment the “little robot” (as I thought of her) had much impressed me,
but I soon forgot about her.</p>
<p>As I was turning in at my door I ran into old Salamano. I asked him
into my room, and he informed me that his dog was definitely lost. He’d
been to the pound to inquire, but it wasn’t there, and the staff told
him it had probably been run over. When he asked them whether it was any
use inquiring about it at the police station, they said the police had
more important things to attend to than keeping records of stray dogs
run over in the streets. I suggested he should get another dog, but,
reasonably enough, he pointed out that he’d become used to this one, and
it wouldn’t be the same thing.</p>
<p>I was seated on my bed, with my legs up, and Salamano on a chair
beside the table, facing me, his hands spread on his knees. He had kept
on his battered felt hat and was mumbling away behind his draggled
yellowish mustache. I found him rather boring, but I had nothing to do
and didn’t feel sleepy. So, to keep the conversation going, I asked some
questions about his dog—how long he had had it and so forth. He told me
he had got it soon after his wife’s death. He’d married rather late in
life. When a young man, he wanted to go on the stage; during his
military service he’d often played in the regimental theatricals and
acted rather well, so everybody said. However, finally, he had taken a
job in the railway, and he didn’t regret it, as now he had a small
pension. He and his wife had never hit it off very well, but they’d got
used to each other, and when she died he felt lonely. One of his mates
on the railway whose bitch had just had pups had offered him one, and he
had taken it, as a companion. He’d had to feed it from the bottle at
first. But, as a dog’s life is shorter than a man’s, they’d grown old
together, so to speak.</p>
<p>“He was a cantankerous brute,” Salamano said. “Now and then we had
some proper set-tos, he and I. But he was a good mutt all the same.”</p>
<p>I said he looked well bred, and that evidently pleased the old
man.</p>
<p>“Ah, but you should have seen him before his illness!” he said. “He
had a wonderful coat; in fact, that was his best point, really. I tried
hard to cure him; every mortal night after he got that skin disease I
rubbed an ointment in. But his real trouble was old age, and there’s no
curing that.”</p>
<p>Just then I yawned, and the old man said he’d better make a move. I
told him he could stay, and that I was sorry about what had happened to
his dog. He thanked me, and mentioned that my mother had been very fond
of his dog. He referred to her as “your poor mother,” and was afraid I
must be feeling her death terribly. When I said nothing he added hastily
and with a rather embarrassed air that some of the people in the street
said nasty things about me because I’d sent my mother to the Home. But
he, of course, knew better; he knew how devoted to my mother I had
always been.</p>
<p>I answered—why, I still don’t know—that it surprised me to learn I’d
produced such a bad impression. As I couldn’t afford to keep her here,
it seemed the obvious thing to do, to send her to a home. “In any case,”
I added, “for years she’d never had a word to say to me, and I could see
she was moping, with no one to talk to.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, “and at a home one makes friends, anyhow.”</p>
<p>He got up, saying it was high time for him to be in bed, and added
that life was going to be a bit of a problem for him, under the new
conditions. For the first time since I’d known him he held out his hand
to me—rather shyly, I thought—and I could feel the scales on his skin.
Just as he was going out of the door, he turned and, smiling a little,
said:</p>
<p>“Let’s hope the dogs won’t bark again tonight. I always think it’s
mine I hear…”</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>It was an effort waking up that Sunday morning; Marie had to jog my
shoulders and shout my name. As we wanted to get into the water early,
we didn’t trouble about breakfast. My head was aching slightly and my
first cigarette had a bitter taste. Marie told me I looked like a
mourner at a funeral, and I certainly did feel very limp. She was
wearing a white dress and had her hair loose. I told her she looked
quite ravishing like that, and she laughed happily.</p>
<p>On our way out we banged on Raymond’s door, and he shouted that he’d
be with us in a jiffy. We went down to the street and, because of my
being rather under the weather and our having kept the blind down in my
room, the glare of the morning sun hit me in the eyes like a clenched
fist.</p>
<p>Marie, however, was almost dancing with delight, and kept repeating,
“What a heavenly day!” After a few minutes I was feeling better, and
noticed that I was hungry. I mentioned this to Marie, but she paid no
attention. She was carrying an oilcloth bag in which she had stowed our
bathing kit and a towel. Presently we heard Raymond shutting his door.
He was wearing blue trousers, a short-sleeved white shirt, and a straw
hat. I noticed that his forearms were rather hairy, but the skin was
very white beneath. The straw hat made Marie giggle. Personally, I was
rather put off by his getup. He seemed in high spirits and was whistling
as he came down the stairs. He greeted me with, “Hello, old boy!” and
addressed Marie as “Mademoiselle.”</p>
<p>On the previous evening we had visited the police station, where I
gave evidence for Raymond—about the girl’s having been false to him. So
they let him off with a warning. They didn’t check my statement.</p>
<p>After some talk on the doorstep we decided to take the bus. The beach
was within easy walking distance, but the sooner we got there the
better. Just as we were starting for the bus stop, Raymond plucked my
sleeve and told me to look across the street. I saw some Arabs lounging
against the tobacconist’s window. They were staring at us silently, in
the special way these people have—as if we were blocks of stone or dead
trees. Raymond whispered that the second Arab from the left was “his
man,” and I thought he looked rather worried However, he assured me that
all that was ancient history. Marie, who hadn’t followed his remarks,
asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p>I explained that those Arabs across the way had a grudge against
Raymond. She insisted on our going at once. Then Raymond laughed, and
squared his shoulders. The young lady was quite right, he said. There
was no point in hanging about here. Halfway to the bus stop he glanced
back over his shoulder and said the Arabs weren’t following. I, too,
looked back. They were exactly as before, gazing in the same vague way
at the spot where we had been.</p>
<p>When we were in the bus, Raymond, who now seemed quite at ease, kept
making jokes to amuse Marie. I could see he was attracted by her, but
she had hardly a word for him. Now and again she would catch my eye and
smile.</p>
<p>We alighted just outside Algiers. The beach is not far from the bus
stop; one has only to cross a patch of highland, a sort of plateau,
which overlooks the sea and shelves down steeply to the sands. The
ground here was covered with yellowish pebbles and wild lilies that
showed snow-white against the blue of the sky, which had already the
hard, metallic glint it gets on very hot days. Marie amused herself
swishing her bag against the flowers and sending the petals showering in
all directions. Then we walked between two rows of little houses with
wooden balconies and green or white palings. Some of them were half
hidden in clumps of tamarisks; others rose naked from the stony plateau.
Before we came to the end of it, the sea was in full view; it lay smooth
as a mirror, and in the distance a big headland jutted out over its
black reflection. Through the still air came the faint buzz of a motor
engine and we saw a fishing boat very far out, gliding almost
imperceptibly across the dazzling smoothness.</p>
<p>Marie picked some rock irises. Going down the steep path leading to
the sea, we saw some bathers already on the sands.</p>
<p>Raymond’s friend owned a small wooden bungalow at the near end of the
beach. Its back rested against the cliffside, while the front stood on
piles, which the water was already lapping. Raymond introduced us to his
friend, whose name was Masson. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and
thick-set; his wife was a plump, cheerful little woman who spoke with a
Paris accent.</p>
<p>Masson promptly told us to make ourselves at home. He had gone out
fishing, he said, first thing in the morning, and there would be fried
fish for lunch. I congratulated him on his little bungalow, and he said
he always spent his week ends and holidays here. “With the missus,
needless to say,” he added. I glanced at her, and noticed that she and
Marie seemed to be getting on well together; laughing and chattering
away. For the first time, perhaps, I seriously considered the
possibility of my marrying her.</p>
<p>Masson wanted to have a swim at once, but his wife and Raymond were
disinclined to move. So only the three of us, Marie, Masson, and myself,
went down to the beach. Marie promptly plunged in, but Masson and I
waited for a bit. He was rather slow of speech and had, I noticed, a
habit of saying “and what’s more” between his phrases—even when the
second added nothing really to the first. Talking of Marie, he said:
“She’s an awfully pretty girl, and what’s more, charming.”</p>
<p>But I soon ceased paying attention to this trick of his; I was
basking in the sunlight, which, I noticed, was making me feel much
better. The sand was beginning to stoke up underfoot and, though I was
eager for a dip, I postponed it for a minute or two more. At last I said
to Masson: “Shall we go in now?” and plunged. Masson walked in gingerly
and only began to swim when he was out of his depth. He swam hand over
hand and made slow headway, so I left him behind and caught up with
Marie. The water was cold and I felt all the better for it. We swam a
long way out, Marie and I, side by side, and it was pleasant feeling how
our movements matched, hers and mine, and how we were both in the same
mood, enjoying every moment.</p>
<p>Once we were out in the open, we lay on our backs and, as I gazed up
at the sky, I could feel the sun drawing up the film of salt water on my
lips and cheeks. We saw Masson swim back to the beach and slump down on
the sand under the sun. In the distance he looked enormous, like a
stranded whale. Then Marie proposed that we should swim tandem. She went
ahead and I put my arms round her waist, from behind, and while she drew
me forward with her arm strokes, I kicked out behind to help us on.</p>
<p>That sound of little splashes had been in my ears for so long that I
began to feel I’d had enough of it. So I let go of Marie and swam back
at an easy pace, taking long, deep breaths. When I made the beach I
stretched myself belly downward beside Masson, resting my face on the
sand. I told him “it was fine” here, and he agreed. Presently Marie came
back. I raised my head to watch her approach. She was glistening with
brine and holding her hair back. Then she lay down beside me, and what
with the combined warmth of our bodies and the sun, I felt myself
dropping off to sleep.</p>
<p>After a while Marie tugged my arm and said Masson had gone to his
place; it must be nearly lunchtime. I rose at once, as I was feeling
hungry, but Marie told me I hadn’t kissed her once since the early
morning. That was so—though I’d wanted to, several times. “Let’s go into
the water again,” she said, and we ran into the sea and lay flat amongst
the ripples for a moment. Then we swam a few strokes, and when we were
almost out of our depth she flung her arms round me and hugged me. I
felt her legs twining round mine, and my senses tingled.</p>
<p>When we got back, Masson was on the steps of his bungalow, shouting
to us to come. I told him I was ravenously hungry, and he promptly
turned to his wife and said he’d taken quite a fancy to me. The bread
was excellent, and I had my full share of the fish. Then came some steak
and potato chips. None of us spoke while eating. Masson drank a lot of
wine and kept refilling my glass the moment it was empty. By the time
coffee was handed round I was feeling slightly muzzy, and I started
smoking one cigarette after another. Masson, Raymond, and I discussed a
plan of spending the whole of August on the beach together, sharing
expenses.</p>
<p>Suddenly Marie exclaimed: “I say! Do you know the time? It’s only
half-past eleven!” We were all surprised at that, and Masson remarked
that we’d had a very early lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast,
you had it when you felt like it.</p>
<p>This set Marie laughing, I don’t know why. I suspect she’d drunk a
bit too much.</p>
<p>Then Masson asked if I’d like to come with him for a stroll on the
beach.</p>
<p>“My wife always has a nap after lunch,” he said. “Personally I find
it doesn’t agree with me; what I need is a short walk. I’m always
telling her it’s much better for the health. But, of course, she’s
entitled to her own opinion.”</p>
<p>Marie proposed to stay and help with the washing up. Mme Masson
smiled and said that, in that case, the first thing was to get the men
out of the way. So we went out together, the three of us.</p>
<p>The light was almost vertical and the glare from the water seared
one’s eyes. The beach was quite deserted now. One could hear a faint
tinkle of knives and forks and crockery in the shacks and bungalows
lining the foreshore. Heat was welling up from the rocks, and one could
hardly breathe.</p>
<p>At first Raymond and Masson talked of things and people I didn’t
know. I gathered that they’d been acquainted for some time and had even
lived together for a while. We went down to the water’s edge and walked
along it; now and then a longer wave wet our canvas shoes. I wasn’t
thinking of anything, as all that sunlight beating down on my bare head
made me feel half asleep.</p>
<p>Just then Raymond said something to Masson that I didn’t quite catch.
But at the same moment I noticed two Arabs in blue dungarees a long way
down the beach, coming in our direction. I gave Raymond a look and he
nodded, saying, “That’s him.” We walked steadily on. Masson wondered how
they’d managed to track us here. My impression was that they had seen us
taking the bus and noticed Marie’s oilcloth bathing bag; but I didn’t
say anything.</p>
<p>Though the Arabs walked quite slowly, they were much nearer already.
We didn’t change our pace, but Raymond said:</p>
<p>“Listen! If there’s a roughhouse, you, Masson, take on the second
one. I’ll tackle the fellow who’s after me. And you, Meursault, stand by
to help if another one comes up, and lay him out.”</p>
<p>I said, “Right,” and Masson put his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>The sand was as hot as fire, and I could have sworn it was glowing
red. The distance between us and the Arabs was steadily decreasing. When
we were only a few steps away the Arabs halted. Masson and I slowed
down, while Raymond went straight up to his man. I couldn’t hear what he
said, but I saw the native lowering his head, as if to butt him in the
chest. Raymond lashed out promptly and shouted to Masson to come. Masson
went up to the man he had been marking and struck him twice with all his
might. The fellow fell flat into the water and stayed there some seconds
with bubbles coming up to the surface round his head. Meanwhile Raymond
had been slogging the other man, whose face was streaming with blood. He
glanced at me over his shoulder and shouted:</p>
<p>“Just you watch! I ain’t finished with him yet!”</p>
<p>“Look out!” I cried. “He’s got a knife.”</p>
<p>I spoke too late. The man had gashed Raymond’s arm and his mouth as
well. Masson sprang forward. The other Arab got up from the water and
placed himself behind the fellow with the knife. We didn’t dare to move.
The two natives backed away slowly, keeping us at bay with the knife and
never taking their eyes off us. When they were at a safe distance they
swung round and took to their heels. We stood stock-still, with the
sunlight beating down on us. Blood was dripping from Raymond’s wounded
arm, which he was squeezing hard above the elbow.</p>
<p>Masson remarked that there was a doctor who always spent his Sundays
here, and Raymond said: “Good. Let’s go to him at once.” He could hardly
get the words out, as the blood from his other wound made bubbles in his
mouth.</p>
<p>We each gave him an arm and helped him back to the bungalow. Once we
were there he told us the wounds weren’t so very deep and he could walk
to where the doctor was. Marie had gone quite pale, and Mme Masson was
in tears.</p>
<p>Masson and Raymond went off to the doctor’s while I was left behind
at the bungalow to explain matters to the women. I didn’t much relish
the task and soon dried up and started smoking, staring at the sea.</p>
<p>Raymond came back at about half-past one, accompanied by Masson. He
had his arm bandaged and a strip of sticking plaster on the corner of
his mouth. The doctor had assured him it was nothing serious, but he was
looking very glum. Masson tried to make him laugh, but without
success.</p>
<p>Presently Raymond said he was going for a stroll on the beach. I
asked him where he proposed to go, and he mumbled something about
“wanting to take the air.” We—Masson and I—then said we’d go with him,
but he flew into a rage and told us to mind our own business. Masson
said we mustn’t insist, seeing the state he was in. However, when he
went out, I followed him.</p>
<p>It was like a furnace outside, with the sunlight splintering into
flakes of fire on the sand and sea. We walked for quite a while, and I
had an idea that Raymond had a definite idea where he was going; but
probably I was mistaken about this.</p>
<p>At the end of the beach we came to a small stream that had cut a
channel in the sand, after coming out from behind a biggish rock. There
we found our two Arabs again, lying on the sand in their blue dungarees.
They looked harmless enough, as if they didn’t bear any malice, and
neither made any move when we approached. The man who had slashed
Raymond stared at him without speaking. The other man was blowing down a
little reed and extracting from it three notes of the scale, which he
played over and over again, while he watched us from the corner of an
eye.</p>
<p>For a while nobody moved; it was all sunlight and silence except for
the tinkle of the stream and those three little lonely sounds. Then
Raymond put his hand to his revolver pocket, but the Arabs still didn’t
move. I noticed the man playing on the reed had his big toes splayed out
almost at right angles to his feet.</p>
<p>Still keeping his eyes on his man, Raymond said to me: “Shall I plug
him one?”</p>
<p>I thought quickly. If I told him not to, considering the mood he was
in, he might very well fly into a temper and use his gun. So I said the
first thing that came into my head.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t spoken to you yet. It would be a lowdown trick to shoot
him like that, in cold blood.”</p>
<p>Again, for some moments one heard nothing but the tinkle of the
stream and the flute notes weaving through the hot, still air.</p>
<p>“Well,” Raymond said at last, “if that’s how you feel, I’d better say
something insulting, and if he answers back I’ll loose off.”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said. “Only, if he doesn’t get out his knife you’ve no
business to fire.”</p>
<p>Raymond was beginning to fidget. The Arab with the reed went on
playing, and both of them watched all our movements.</p>
<p>“Listen,” I said to Raymond. “You take on the fellow on the right,
and give me your revolver. If the other one starts making trouble or
gets out his knife, I’ll shoot.”</p>
<p>The sun glinted on Raymond’s revolver as he handed it to me. But
nobody made a move yet; it was just as if everything had closed in on us
so that we couldn’t stir. We could only watch each other, never lowering
our eyes; the whole world seemed to have come to a standstill on this
little strip of sand between the sunlight and the sea, the twofold
silence of the reed and stream. And just then it crossed my mind that
one might fire, or not fire—and it would come to absolutely the same
thing.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, the Arabs vanished; they’d slipped like
lizards under cover of the rock. So Raymond and I turned and walked
back. He seemed happier, and began talking about the bus to catch for
our return.</p>
<p>When we reached the bungalow Raymond promptly went up the wooden
steps, but I halted on the bottom one. The light seemed thudding in my
head and I couldn’t face the effort needed to go up the steps and make
myself amiable to the women. But the heat was so great that it was just
as bad staying where I was, under that flood of blinding light falling
from the sky. To stay, or to make a move—it came to much the same. After
a moment I returned to the beach, and started walking.</p>
<p>There was the same red glare as far as eye could reach, and small
waves were lapping the hot sand in little, flurried gasps. As I slowly
walked toward the boulders at the end of the beach I could feel my
temples swelling under the impact of the light. It pressed itself on me,
trying to check my progress. And each time I felt a hot blast strike my
forehead, I gritted my teeth, I clenched my fists in my trouser pockets
and keyed up every nerve to fend off the sun and the dark befuddlement
it was pouring into me. Whenever a blade of vivid light shot upward from
a bit of shell or broken glass lying on the sand, my jaws set hard. I
wasn’t going to be beaten, and I walked steadily on.</p>
<p>The small black hump of rock came into view far down the beach. It
was rimmed by a dazzling sheen of light and feathery spray, but I was
thinking of the cold, clear stream behind it, and longing to hear again
the tinkle of running water. Anything to be rid of the glare, the sight
of women in tears, the strain and effort—and to retrieve the pool of
shadow by the rock and its cool silence!</p>
<p>But when I came nearer I saw that Raymond’s Arab had returned. He was
by himself this time, lying on his back, his hands behind his head, his
face shaded by the rock while the sun beat on the rest of his body. One
could see his dungarees steaming in the heat. I was rather taken aback;
my impression had been that the incident was closed, and I hadn’t given
a thought to it on my way here.</p>
<p>On seeing me, the Arab raised himself a little, and his hand went to
his pocket. Naturally, I gripped Raymond’s revolver in the pocket of my
coat. Then the Arab let himself sink back again, but without taking his
hand from his pocket. I was some distance off, at least ten yards, and
most of the time I saw him as a blurred dark form wobbling in the heat
haze. Sometimes, however, I had glimpses of his eyes glowing between the
half-closed lids. The sound of the waves was even lazier, feebler, than
at noon. But the light hadn’t changed; it was pounding as fiercely as
ever on the long stretch of sand that ended at the rock. For two hours
the sun seemed to have made no progress; becalmed in a sea of molten
steel. Far out on the horizon a steamer was passing; I could just make
out from the corner of an eye the small black moving patch, while I kept
my gaze fixed on the Arab.</p>
<p>It struck me that all I had to do was to turn, walk away, and think
no more about it. But the whole beach, pulsing with heat, was pressing
on my back. I took some steps toward the stream. The Arab didn’t move.
After all, there was still some distance between us. Perhaps because of
the shadow on his face, he seemed to be grinning at me.</p>
<p>I waited. The heat was beginning to scorch my cheeks; beads of sweat
were gathering in my eyebrows. It was just the same sort of heat as at
my mother’s funeral, and I had the same disagreeable
sensations—especially in my forehead, where all the veins seemed to be
bursting through the skin. I couldn’t stand it any longer, and took
another step forward. I knew it was a fool thing to do; I wouldn’t get
out of the sun by moving on a yard or so. But I took that step, just one
step, forward. And then the Arab drew his knife and held it up toward
me, athwart the sunlight.</p>
<p>A shaft of light shot upward from the steel, and I felt as if a long,
thin blade transfixed my forehead. At the same moment all the sweat that
had accumulated in my eyebrows splashed down on my eyelids, covering
them with a warm film of moisture. Beneath a veil of brine and tears my
eyes were blinded; I was conscious only of the cymbals of the sun
clashing on my skull, and, less distinctly, of the keen blade of light
flashing up from the knife, scarring my eyelashes, and gouging into my
eyeballs.</p>
<p>Then everything began to reel before my eyes, a fiery gust came from
the sea, while the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great
sheet of flame poured down through the rift. Every nerve in my body was
a steel spring, and my grip closed on the revolver. The trigger gave,
and the smooth underbelly of the butt jogged my palm. And so, with that
crisp, whipcrack sound, it all began. I shook off my sweat and the
clinging veil of light. I knew I’d shattered the balance of the day, the
spacious calm of this beach on which I had been happy. But I fired four
shots more into the inert body, on which they left no visible trace. And
each successive shot was another loud, fateful rap on the door of my
undoing.</p>
