<h4 id="ii">II</h4>
<p>There are some things of which I’ve never cared to talk. And, a few
days after I’d been sent to prison, I decided that this phase of my life
was one of them. However, as time went by, I came to feel that this
aversion had no real substance. In point of fact, during those early
days, I was hardly conscious of being in prison; I had always a vague
hope that something would turn up, some agreeable surprise.</p>
<p>The change came soon after Marie’s first and only visit. From the day
when I got her letter telling me they wouldn’t let her come to see me
any more, because she wasn’t my wife—it was from that day that I
realized that this cell was my last home, a dead end, so to speak.</p>
<p>On the day of my arrest they put me in a biggish room with several
other prisoners, mostly Arabs. They grinned when they saw me enter, and
asked me what I’d done. I told them I’d killed an Arab, and they kept
mum for a while. But presently night began to fall, and one of them
explained to me how to lay out my sleeping mat. By rolling up one end
one makes a sort of bolster. All night I felt bugs crawling over my
face.</p>
<p>Some days later I was put by myself in a cell, where I slept on a
plank bed hinged to the wall. The only other furniture was a latrine
bucket and a tin basin. The prison stands on rising ground, and through
my little window I had glimpses of the sea. One day when I was hanging
on the bars, straining my eyes toward the sunlight playing on the waves,
a jailer entered and said I had a visitor. I thought it must be Marie,
and so it was.</p>
<p>To go to the Visitors’ Room, I was taken along a corridor, then up a
flight of steps, then along another corridor. It was a very large room,
lit by a big bow window, and divided into three compartments by high
iron grilles running transversally. Between the two grilles there was a
gap of some thirty feet, a sort of no man’s land between the prisoners
and their friends. I was led to a point exactly opposite Marie, who was
wearing her striped dress. On my side of the rails were about a dozen
other prisoners, Arabs for the most part. On Marie’s side were mostly
Moorish women. She was wedged between a small old woman with tight-set
lips and a fat matron, without a hat, who was talking shrilly and
gesticulated all the time. Because of the distance between the visitors
and prisoners I found I, too, had to raise my voice.</p>
<p>When I came into the room the babel of voices echoing on the bare
walls, and the sunlight streaming in, flooding everything in a harsh
white glare, made me feel quite dizzy. After the relative darkness and
the silence of my cell it took me some moments to get used to these
conditions. After a bit, however, I came to see each face quite clearly,
lit up as if a spotlight played on it.</p>
<p>I noticed a prison official seated at each end of the no man’s land
between the grilles. The native prisoners and their relations on the
other side were squatting opposite each other. They didn’t raise their
voices and, in spite of the din, managed to converse almost in whispers.
This murmur of voices coming from below made a sort of accompaniment to
the conversations going on above their heads. I took stock of all this
very quickly and moved a step forward toward Marie. She was pressing her
brown, sun-tanned face to the bars and smiling as hard as she could. I
thought she was looking very pretty, but somehow couldn’t bring myself
to tell her so.</p>
<p>“Well?” she asked, pitching her voice very high. “What about it? Are
you all right, have you everything you want?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. I’ve everything I want.”</p>
<p>We were silent for some moments; Marie went on smiling. The fat woman
was bawling at the prisoner beside me, her husband presumably, a tall,
fair, pleasant-looking man.</p>
<p>“Jeanne refused to have him,” she yelled.</p>
<p>“That’s just too bad,” the man replied.</p>
<p>“Yes, and I told her you’d take him back the moment you got out; but
she wouldn’t hear of it.”</p>
<p>Marie shouted across the gap that Raymond sent me his best wishes,
and I said,</p>
<p>“Thanks.” But my voice was drowned by my neighbor’s, asking “if he
was quite fit.”</p>
<p>The fat woman gave a laugh. “Fit? I should say he is! The picture of
health.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile the prisoner on my left, a youngster with thin, girlish
hands, never said a word. His eyes, I noticed, were fixed on the little
old woman opposite him, and she returned his gaze with a sort of hungry
passion. But I had to stop looking at them as Marie was shouting to me
that we mustn’t lose hope.</p>
<p>“Certainly not,” I answered. My gaze fell on her shoulders, and I had
a sudden longing to squeeze them, through the thin dress. Its silky
texture fascinated me, and I had a feeling that the hope she spoke of
centered on it, somehow. I imagine something of the same sort was in
Marie’s mind, for she went on smiling, looking straight at me.</p>
<p>“It’ll all come right, you’ll see, and then we shall get
married.”</p>
<p>All I could see of her now was the white flash of her teeth, and the
little puckers round her eyes. I answered: “Do you really think so?” but
chiefly because I felt it up to me to answer something.</p>
<p>She started talking very fast in the same high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, you’ll be acquitted, and we’ll go bathing again, Sundays.”</p>
<p>The woman beside me was still yelling away, telling her husband that
she’d left a basket for him in the prison office. She gave a list of the
things she’d brought and told him to mind and check them carefully, as
some had cost quite a lot. The youngster on my other side and his mother
were still gazing mournfully at each other, and the murmur of the Arabs
droned on below us. The light outside seemed to be surging up against
the window, seeping through, and smearing the faces of the people facing
it with a coat of yellow oil.</p>
<p>I began to feel slightly squeamish, and wished I could leave. The
strident voice beside me was jarring on my ears. But, on the other hand,
I wanted to have the most I could of Marie’s company. I’ve no idea how
much time passed. I remember Marie’s describing to me her work, with
that set smile always on her face. There wasn’t a moment’s letup in the
noise—shouts, conversations, and always that muttering undertone. The
only oasis of silence was made by the young fellow and the old woman
gazing into each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>Then, one by one, the Arabs were led away; almost everyone fell
silent when the first one left. The little old woman pressed herself
against the bars and at the same moment a jailer tapped her son’s
shoulder. He called, “Au revoir, Mother,” and, slipping her hand between
the bars, she gave him a small, slow wave with it.</p>
<p>No sooner was she gone than a man, hat in hand, took her place. A
prisoner was led up to the empty place beside me, and the two started a
brisk exchange of remarks—not loud, however, as the room had become
relatively quiet. Someone came and called away the man on my right, and
his wife shouted at him—she didn’t seem to realize it was no longer
necessary to shout—“Now, mind you look after yourself, dear, and don’t
do anything rash!”</p>
<p>My turn came next. Marie threw me a kiss. I looked back as I walked
away. She hadn’t moved; her face was still pressed to the rails, her
lips still parted in that tense, twisted smile.</p>
<p>Soon after this I had a letter from her. And it was then that the
things I’ve never liked to talk about began. Not that they were
particularly terrible; I’ve no wish to exaggerate and I suffered less
than others. Still, there was one thing in those early days that was
really irksome: my habit of thinking like a free man. For instance, I
would suddenly be seized with a desire to go down to the beach for a
swim. And merely to have imagined the sound of ripples at my feet, the
smooth feel of the water on my body as I struck out, and the wonderful
sensation of relief it gave brought home still more cruelly the
narrowness of my cell.</p>
<p>Still, that phase lasted a few months only. Afterward, I had
prisoner’s thoughts. I waited for the daily walk in the courtyard or a
visit from my lawyer. As for the rest of the time, I managed quite well,
really. I’ve often thought that had I been compelled to live in the
trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but gaze up at the patch of sky
just overhead, I’d have got used to it by degrees. I’d have learned to
watch for the passing of birds or drifting clouds, as I had come to
watch for my lawyer’s odd neckties, or, in another world, to wait
patiently till Sunday for a spell of love-making with Marie. Well, here,
anyhow, I wasn’t penned in a hollow tree trunk. There were others in the
world worse off than I. I remembered it had been one of Mother’s pet
ideas—she was always voicing it—that in the long run one gets used to
anything.</p>
<p>Usually, however, I didn’t think things out so far. Those first
months were trying, of course; but the very effort I had to make helped
me through them. For instance, I was plagued by the desire for a
woman—which was natural enough, considering my age. I never thought of
Marie especially. I was obsessed by thoughts of this woman or that, of
all the ones I’d had, all the circumstances under which I’d loved them;
so much so that the cell grew crowded with their faces, ghosts of my old
passions. That unsettled me, no doubt; but, at least, it served to kill
time.</p>
<p>I gradually became quite friendly with the chief jailer, who went the
rounds with the kitchen hands at mealtimes. It was he who brought up the
subject of women. “That’s what the men here grumble about most,” he told
me.</p>
<p>I said I felt like that myself. “There’s something unfair about it,”
I added, “like hitting a man when he’s down.”</p>
<p>“But that’s the whole point of it,” he said; “that’s why you fellows
are kept in prison.”</p>
<p>“I don’t follow.”</p>
<p>“Liberty,” he said, “means that. You’re being deprived of your
liberty.”</p>
<p>It had never before struck me in that light, but I saw his point.
“That’s true,” I said. “Otherwise it wouldn’t be a punishment.”</p>
<p>The jailer nodded. “Yes, you’re different, you can use your brains.
The others can’t. Still, those fellows find a way out; they do it by
themselves.” With which remark the jailer left my cell. Next day I did
like the others.</p>
<p>The lack of cigarettes, too, was a trial. When I was brought to the
prison, they took away my belt, my shoelaces, and the contents of my
pockets, including my cigarettes. Once I had been given a cell to myself
I asked to be given back, anyhow, the cigarettes. Smoking was forbidden,
they informed me. That, perhaps, was what got me down the most; in fact,
I suffered really badly during the first few days. I even tore off
splinters from my plank bed and sucked them. All day long I felt faint
and bilious. It passed my understanding why I shouldn’t be allowed even
to smoke; it could have done no one any harm. Later on, I understood the
idea behind it; this privation, too, was part of my punishment. But, by
the time I understood, I’d lost the craving, so it had ceased to be a
punishment.</p>
<p>Except for these privations I wasn’t too unhappy. Yet again, the
whole problem was: how to kill time. After a while, however, once I’d
learned the trick of remembering things, I never had a moment’s boredom.
Sometimes I would exercise my memory on my bedroom and, starting from a
corner, make the round, noting every object I saw on the way. At first
it was over in a minute or two. But each time I repeated the experience,
it took a little longer. I made a point of visualizing every piece of
furniture, and each article upon or in it, and then every detail of each
article, and finally the details of the details, so to speak: a tiny
dent or incrustation, or a chipped edge, and the exact grain and color
of the woodwork. At the same time I forced myself to keep my inventory
in mind from start to finish, in the right order and omitting no item.
With the result that, after a few weeks, I could spend hours merely in
listing the objects in my bedroom. I found that the more I thought, the
more details, half-forgotten or malobserved, floated up from my memory.
There seemed no end to them.</p>
<p>So I learned that even after a single day’s experience of the outside
world a man could easily live a hundred years in prison. He’d have laid
up enough memories never to be bored. Obviously, in one way, this was a
compensation.</p>
<p>Then there was sleep. To begin with, I slept badly at night and never
in the day. But gradually my nights became better, and I managed to doze
off in the daytime as well. In fact, during the last months, I must have
slept sixteen or eighteen hours out of the twenty-four. So there
remained only six hours to fill—with meals, relieving nature, my
memories… and the story of the Czech.</p>
<p>One day, when inspecting my straw mattress, I found a bit of
newspaper stuck to its underside. The paper was yellow with age, almost
transparent, but I could still make out the letter print. It was the
story of a crime. The first part was missing, but I gathered that its
scene was some village in Czechoslovakia. One of the villagers had left
his home to try his luck abroad. After twenty-five years, having made a
fortune, he returned to his country with his wife and child. Meanwhile
his mother and sister had been running a small hotel in the village
where he was born. He decided to give them a surprise and, leaving his
wife and child in another inn, he went to stay at his mother’s place,
booking a room under an assumed name. His mother and sister completely
failed to recognize him. At dinner that evening he showed them a large
sum of money he had on him, and in the course of the night they
slaughtered him with a hammer. After taking the money they flung the
body into the river. Next morning his wife came and, without thinking,
betrayed the guest’s identity. His mother hanged herself. His sister
threw herself into a well. I must have read that story thousands of
times. In one way it sounded most unlikely; in another, it was plausible
enough. Anyhow, to my mind, the man was asking for trouble; one
shouldn’t play fool tricks of that sort.</p>
<p>So, what with long bouts of sleep, my memories, readings of that
scrap of newspaper, the tides of light and darkness, the days slipped
by. I’d read, of course, that in jail one ends up by losing track of
time. But this had never meant anything definite to me. I hadn’t grasped
how days could be at once long and short. Long, no doubt, as periods to
live through, but so distended that they ended up by overlapping on each
other. In fact, I never thought of days as such; only the words
“yesterday” and “tomorrow” still kept some meaning.</p>
<p>When, one morning, the jailer informed me I’d now been six months in
jail, I believed him—but the words conveyed nothing to my mind. To me it
seemed like one and the same day that had been going on since I’d been
in my cell, and that I’d been doing the same thing all the time.</p>
<p>After the jailer left me I shined up my tin pannikin and studied my
face in it. My expression was terribly serious, I thought, even when I
tried to smile. I held the pannikin at different angles, but always my
face had the same mournful, tense expression.</p>
<p>The sun was setting and it was the hour of which I’d rather not
speak—“the nameless hour,” I called it—when evening sounds were creeping
up from all the floors of the prison in a sort of stealthy procession. I
went to the barred window and in the last rays looked once again at my
reflected face. It was as serious as before; and that wasn’t surprising,
as just then I was feeling serious. But, at the same time, I heard
something that I hadn’t heard for months. It was the sound of a voice;
my own voice, there was no mistaking it. And I recognized it as the
voice that for many a day of late had been sounding in my ears. So I
knew that all this time I’d been talking to myself.</p>
<p>And something I’d been told came back; a remark made by the nurse at
Mother’s funeral. No, there was no way out, and no one can imagine what
the evenings are like in prison.</p>
