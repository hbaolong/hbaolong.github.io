<h4 id="iv">IV</h4>
<p>It is always interesting, even in the prisoner’s dock, to hear
oneself being talked about. And certainly in the speeches of my lawyer
and the prosecuting counsel a great deal was said about me; more, in
fact, about me personally than about my crime.</p>
<p>Really there wasn’t any very great difference between the two
speeches. Counsel for the defense raised his arms to heaven and pleaded
guilty, but with extenuating circumstances. The Prosecutor made similar
gestures; he agreed that I was guilty, but denied extenuating
circumstances.</p>
<p>One thing about this phase of the trial was rather irksome. Quite
often, interested as I was in what they had to say, I was tempted to put
in a word, myself. But my lawyer had advised me not to. “You won’t do
your case any good by talking,” he had warned me. In fact, there seemed
to be a conspiracy to exclude me from the proceedings; I wasn’t to have
any say and my fate was to be decided out of hand.</p>
<p>It was quite an effort at times for me to refrain from cutting them
all short, and saying: “But, damn it all, who’s on trial in this court,
I’d like to know? It’s a serious matter for a man, being accused of
murder. And I’ve something really important to tell you.”</p>
<p>However, on second thoughts, I found I had nothing to say. In any
case, I must admit that hearing oneself talked about loses its interest
very soon. The Prosecutor’s speech, especially, began to bore me before
he was halfway through it. The only things that really caught my
attention were occasional phrases, his gestures, and some elaborate
tirades—but these were isolated patches.</p>
<p>What he was aiming at, I gathered, was to show that my crime was
premeditated. I remember his saying at one moment, “I can prove this,
gentlemen of the jury, to the hilt. First, you have the facts of the
crime; which are as clear as daylight. And then you have what I may call
the night side of this case, the dark workings of a criminal
mentality.”</p>
<p>He began by summing up the facts, from my mother’s death onward. He
stressed my heartlessness, my inability to state Mother’s age, my visit
to the swimming pool where I met Marie, our matinee at the pictures
where a Fernandel film was showing, and finally my return with Marie to
my rooms. I didn’t quite follow his remarks at first, as he kept on
mentioning “the prisoner’s mistress,” whereas for me she was just
“Marie.” Then he came to the subject of Raymond. It seemed to me that
his way of treating the facts showed a certain shrewdness. All he said
sounded quite plausible. I’d written the letter in collusion with
Raymond so as to entice his mistress to his room and subject her to
ill-treatment by a man “of more than dubious reputation.” Then, on the
beach, I’d provoked a brawl with Raymond’s enemies, in the course of
which Raymond was wounded. I’d asked him for his revolver and gone back
by myself with the intention of using it. Then I’d shot the Arab. After
the first shot I waited. Then, “to be certain of making a good job of
it,” I fired four more shots deliberately, point-blank, and in cold
blood, at my victim.</p>
<p>“That is my case,” he said. “I have described to you the series of
events which led this man to kill the deceased, fully aware of what he
was doing. I emphasize this point. We are not concerned with an act of
homicide committed on a sudden impulse which might serve as extenuation.
I ask you to note, gentlemen of the jury, that the prisoner is an
educated man. You will have observed the way in which he answered my
questions; he is intelligent and he knows the value of words. And I
repeat that it is quite impossible to assume that, when he committed the
crime, he was unaware what he was doing.”</p>
<p>I noticed that he laid stress on my “intelligence.” It puzzled me
rather why what would count as a good point in an ordinary person should
be used against an accused man as an overwhelming proof of his guilt.
While thinking this over, I missed what he said next, until I heard him
exclaim indignantly: “And has he uttered a word of regret for his most
odious crime? Not one word, gentlemen. Not once in the course of these
proceedings did this man show the least contrition.”</p>
<p>Turning toward the dock, he pointed a finger at me, and went on in
the same strain. I really couldn’t understand why he harped on this
point so much. Of course, I had to own that he was right; I didn’t feel
much regret for what I’d done. Still, to my mind he overdid it, and I’d
have liked to have a chance of explaining to him, in a quite friendly,
almost affectionate way, that I have never been able really to regret
anything in all my life. I’ve always been far too much absorbed in the
present moment, or the immediate future, to think back. Of course, in
the position into which I had been forced, there was no question of my
speaking to anyone in that tone. I hadn’t the right to show any friendly
feeling or possess good intentions. And I tried to follow what came
next, as the Prosecutor was now considering what he called my
“soul.”</p>
<p>He said he’d studied it closely—and had found a blank, “literally
nothing, gentlemen of the jury.” Really, he said, I had no soul, there
was nothing human about me, not one of those moral qualities which
normal men possess had any place in my mentality. “No doubt,” he added,
“we should not reproach him with this. We cannot blame a man for lacking
what it was never in his power to acquire. But in a criminal court the
wholly passive ideal of tolerance must give place to a sterner, loftier
ideal, that of justice. Especially when this lack of every decent
instinct is such as that of the man before you, a menace to society.” He
proceeded to discuss my conduct toward my mother, repeating what he had
said in the course of the hearing. But he spoke at much greater length
of my crime—at such length, indeed, that I lost the thread and was
conscious only of the steadily increasing heat.</p>
<p>A moment came when the Prosecutor paused and, after a short silence,
said in a low, vibrant voice: “This same court, gentlemen, will be
called on to try tomorrow that most odious of crimes, the murder of a
father by his son.” To his mind, such a crime was almost unimaginable.
But, he ventured to hope, justice would be meted out without paltering.
And yet, he made bold to say, the horror that even the crime of
parricide inspired in him paled beside the loathing inspired by my
callousness.</p>
<p>“This man, who is morally guilty of his mother’s death, is no less
unfit to have a place in the community than that other man who did to
death the father that begat him. And, indeed, the one crime led on to
the other; the first of these two criminals, the man in the dock, set a
precedent, if I may put it so, and authorized the second crime. Yes,
gentlemen, I am convinced”—here he raised his voice a tone—“that you
will not find I am exaggerating the case against the prisoner when I say
that he is also guilty of the murder to be tried tomorrow in this court.
And I look to you for a verdict accordingly.”</p>
<p>The Prosecutor paused again, to wipe the sweat off his face. He then
explained that his duty was a painful one, but he would do it without
flinching. “This man has, I repeat, no place in a community whose basic
principles he flouts without compunction. Nor, heartless as he is, has
he any claim to mercy. I ask you to impose the extreme penalty of the
law; and I ask it without a qualm. In the course of a long career, in
which it has often been my duty to ask for a capital sentence, never
have I felt that painful duty weigh so little on my mind as in the
present case. In demanding a verdict of murder without extenuating
circumstances, I am following not only the dictates of my conscience and
a sacred obligation, but also those of the natural and righteous
indignation I feel at the sight of a criminal devoid of the least spark
of human feeling.”</p>
<p>When the Prosecutor sat down there was a longish silence. Personally
I was quite overcome by the heat and my amazement at what I had been
hearing. The presiding judge gave a short cough, and asked me in a very
low tone if I had anything to say. I rose, and as I felt in the mood to
speak, I said the first thing that crossed my mind: that I’d had no
intention of killing the Arab. The Judge replied that this statement
would be taken into consideration by the court. Meanwhile he would be
glad to hear, before my counsel addressed the court, what were the
motives of my crime. So far, he must admit, he hadn’t fully understood
the grounds of my defense.</p>
<p>I tried to explain that it was because of the sun, but I spoke too
quickly and ran my words into each other. I was only too conscious that
it sounded nonsensical, and, in fact, I heard people tittering.</p>
<p>My lawyer shrugged his shoulders. Then he was directed to address the
court, in his turn. But all he did was to point out the lateness of the
hour and to ask for an adjournment till the following afternoon. To this
the judge agreed.</p>
<p>When I was brought back next day, the electric fans were still
churning up the heavy air and the jurymen plying their gaudy little fans
in a sort of steady rhythm. The speech for the defense seemed to me
interminable. At one moment, however, I pricked up my ears; it was when
I heard him saying: “It is true I killed a man.” He went on in the same
strain, saying “I” when he referred to me. It seemed so queer that I
bent toward the policeman on my right and asked him to explain. He told
me to shut up; then, after a moment, whispered: “They all do that.” It
seemed to me that the idea behind it was still further to exclude me
from the case, to put me off the map so to speak, by substituting the
lawyer for myself. Anyway, it hardly mattered; I already felt worlds
away from this courtroom and its tedious “proceedings.”</p>
<p>My lawyer, in any case, struck me as feeble to the point of being
ridiculous. He hurried through his plea of provocation, and then he,
too, started in about my soul. But I had an impression that he had much
less talent than the Prosecutor.</p>
<p>“I, too,” he said, “have closely studied this man’s soul; but, unlike
my learned friend for the prosecution, I have found something there.
Indeed, I may say that I have read the prisoner’s mind like an open
book.” What he had read there was that I was an excellent young fellow,
a steady, conscientious worker who did his best by his employer; that I
was popular with everyone and sympathetic in others’ troubles. According
to him I was a dutiful son, who had supported his mother as long as he
was able. After anxious consideration I had reached the conclusion that,
by entering a home, the old lady would have comforts that my means
didn’t permit me to provide for her. “I am astounded, gentlemen,” he
added, “by the attitude taken up by my learned friend in referring to
this Home. Surely if proof be needed of the excellence of such
institutions, we need only remember that they are promoted and financed
by a government department.” I noticed that he made no reference to the
funeral, and this seemed to me a serious omission. But, what with his
long-windedness, the endless days and hours they had been discussing my
“soul,” and the rest of it, I found that my mind had gone blurred;
everything was dissolving into a grayish, watery haze.</p>
<p>Only one incident stands out; toward the end, while my counsel
rambled on, I heard the tin trumpet of an ice-cream vendor in the
street, a small, shrill sound cutting across the flow of words. And then
a rush of memories went through my mind—memories of a life which was
mine no longer and had once provided me with the surest, humblest
pleasures: warm smells of summer, my favorite streets, the sky at
evening, Marie’s dresses and her laugh. The futility of what was
happening here seemed to take me by the throat, I felt like vomiting,
and I had only one idea: to get it over, to go back to my cell, and
sleep… and sleep.</p>
<p>Dimly I heard my counsel making his last appeal.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen of the jury, surely you will not send to his death a
decent, hard-working young man, because for one tragic moment he lost
his self-control? Is he not sufficiently punished by the lifelong
remorse that is to be his lot? I confidently await your verdict, the
only verdict possible—that of homicide with extenuating
circumstances.”</p>
<p>The court rose, and the lawyer sat down, looking thoroughly
exhausted. Some of his colleagues came to him and shook his hand. “You
put up a magnificent show, old man,” I heard one of them say. Another
lawyer even called me to witness: “Fine, wasn’t it?” I agreed, but
insincerely; I was far too tired to judge if it had been “fine” or
otherwise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the day was ending and the heat becoming less intense. By
some vague sounds that reached me from the street I knew that the cool
of the evening had set in. We all sat on, waiting. And what we all were
waiting for really concerned nobody but me. I looked round the
courtroom. It was exactly as it had been on the first day. I met the
eyes of the journalist in gray and the robot woman. This reminded me
that not once during the whole hearing had I tried to catch Marie’s eye.
It wasn’t that I’d forgotten her; only I was too preoccupied. I saw her
now, seated between Céleste and Raymond. She gave me a little wave of
her hand, as if to say, “At last!” She was smiling, but I could tell
that she was rather anxious. But my heart seemed turned to stone, and I
couldn’t even return her smile.</p>
<p>The judges came back to their seats. Someone read out to the jury,
very rapidly, a string of questions. I caught a word here and there.
“Murder of malice aforethought… Provocation… Extenuating circumstances.”
The jury went out, and I was taken to the little room where I had
already waited. My lawyer came to see me; he was very talkative and
showed more cordiality and confidence than ever before. He assured me
that all would go well and I’d get off with a few years’ imprisonment or
transportation. I asked him what were the chances of getting the
sentence quashed. He said there was no chance of that. He had not raised
any point of law, as this was apt to prejudice the jury. And it was
difficult to get a judgment quashed except on technical grounds. I saw
his point, and agreed. Looking at the matter dispassionately, I shared
his view. Otherwise there would be no end to litigation. “In any case,”
the lawyer said, “you can appeal in the ordinary way. But I’m convinced
the verdict will be favorable.”</p>
<p>We waited for quite a while, a good three quarters of an hour, I
should say. Then a bell rang. My lawyer left me, saying:</p>
<p>“The foreman of the jury will read out the answers. You will be
called on after that to hear the judgment.”</p>
<p>Some doors banged. I heard people hurrying down flights of steps, but
couldn’t tell whether they were near by or distant. Then I heard a voice
droning away in the courtroom.</p>
<p>When the bell rang again and I stepped back into the dock, the
silence of the courtroom closed in round me, and with the silence came a
queer sensation when I noticed that, for the first time, the young
journalist kept his eyes averted. I didn’t look in Marie’s direction. In
fact, I had no time to look, as the presiding judge had already started
pronouncing a rigmarole to the effect that “in the name of the French
people” I was to be decapitated in some public place.</p>
<p>It seemed to me then that I could interpret the look on the faces of
those present; it was one of almost respectful sympathy. The policemen,
too, handled me very gently. The lawyer placed his hand on my wrist. I
had stopped thinking altogether. I heard the Judge’s voice asking if I
had anything more to say. After thinking for a moment, I answered, “No.”
Then the policemen led me out.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>I have just refused, for the third time, to see the prison chaplain.
I have nothing to say to him, don’t feel like talking—and shall be
seeing him quite soon enough, anyway. The only thing that interests me
now is the problem of circumventing the machine, learning if the
inevitable admits a loophole.</p>
<p>They have moved me to another cell. In this one, lying on my back, I
can see the sky, and there is nothing else to see. All my time is spent
in watching the slowly changing colors of the sky, as day moves on to
night. I put my hands behind my head, gaze up, and wait.</p>
<p>This problem of a loophole obsesses me; I am always wondering if
there have been cases of condemned prisoners’ escaping from the
implacable machinery of justice at the last moment, breaking through the
police cordon, vanishing in the nick of time before the guillotine
falls. Often and often I blame myself for not having given more
attention to accounts of public executions. One should always take an
interest in such matters. There’s never any knowing what one may come
to. Like everyone else I’d read descriptions of executions in the
papers. But technical books dealing with this subject must certainly
exist; only I’d never felt sufficiently interested to look them up. And
in these books I might have found escape stories. Surely they’d have
told me that in one case, anyhow, the wheels had stopped; that once, if
only once, in that inexorable march of events, chance or luck had played
a happy part. Just once! In a way I think that single instance would
have satisfied me. My emotion would have done the rest. The papers often
talk of “a debt owed to society”—a debt which, according to them, must
be paid by the offender. But talk of that sort doesn’t touch the
imagination. No, the one thing that counted for me was the possibility
of making a dash for it and defeating their bloodthirsty rite; of a mad
stampede to freedom that would anyhow give me a moment’s hope, the
gambler’s last throw. Naturally, all that “hope” could come to was to be
knocked down at the corner of a street or picked off by a bullet in my
back. But, all things considered, even this luxury was forbidden me; I
was caught in the rattrap irrevocably.</p>
<p>Try as I might, I couldn’t stomach this brutal certitude. For really,
when one came to think of it, there was a disproportion between the
judgment on which it was based and the unalterable sequence of events
starting from the moment when that judgment was delivered. The fact that
the verdict was read out at eight P.M. rather than at five, the fact
that it might have been quite different, that it was given by men who
change their underclothes, and was credited to so vague an entity as the
“French people”—for that matter, why not to the Chinese or the German
people?—all these facts seemed to deprive the court’s decision of much
of its gravity. Yet I could but recognize that, from the moment the
verdict was given, its effects became as cogent, as tangible, as, for
example, this wall against which I was lying, pressing my back to
it.</p>
<p>When such thoughts crossed my mind, I remembered a story Mother used
to tell me about my father. I never set eyes on him. Perhaps the only
things I really knew about him were what Mother had told me. One of
these was that he’d gone to see a murderer executed. The mere thought of
it turned his stomach. But he’d seen it through and, on coming home, was
violently sick. At the time, I found my father’s conduct rather
disgusting. But now I understood; it was so natural. How had I failed to
recognize that nothing was more important than an execution; that,
viewed from one angle, it’s the only thing that can genuinely interest a
man? And I decided that, if ever I got out of jail, I’d attend every
execution that took place. I was unwise, no doubt, even to consider this
possibility. For, the moment I’d pictured myself in freedom, standing
behind a double rank of policemen—on the right side of the line, so to
speak—the mere thought of being an onlooker who comes to see the show,
and can go home and vomit afterward, flooded my mind with a wild, absurd
exultation. It was a stupid thing to let my imagination run away with me
like that; a moment later I had a shivering fit and had to wrap myself
closely in my blanket. But my teeth went on chattering; nothing would
stop them.</p>
<p>Still, obviously, one can’t be sensible all the time. Another equally
ridiculous fancy of mine was to frame new laws, altering the penalties.
What was wanted, to my mind, was to give the criminal a chance, if only
a dog’s chance; say, one chance in a thousand. There might be some drug,
or combination of drugs, which would kill the patient (I thought of him
as “the patient”) nine hundred and ninety times in a thousand. That he
should know this was, of course, essential. For after taking much
thought, calmly, I came to the conclusion that what was wrong about the
guillotine was that the condemned man had no chance at all, absolutely
none. In fact, the patient’s death had been ordained irrevocably. It was
a foregone conclusion. If by some fluke the knife didn’t do its job,
they started again. So it came to this, that—against the grain, no
doubt—the condemned man had to hope the apparatus was in good working
order! This, I thought, was a flaw in the system; and, on the face of
it, my view was sound enough. On the other hand, I had to admit it
proved the efficiency of the system. It came to this; the man under
sentence was obliged to collaborate mentally, it was in his interest
that all should go off without a hitch.</p>
<p>Another thing I had to recognize was that, until now, I’d had wrong
ideas on the subject. For some reason I’d always supposed that one had
to go up steps and climb on to a scaffold, to be guillotined. Probably
that was because of the 1789 Revolution; I mean, what I’d learned about
it at school, and the pictures I had seen. Then one morning I remembered
a photograph the newspapers had featured on the occasion of the
execution of a famous criminal. Actually the apparatus stood on the
ground; there was nothing very impressing about it, and it was much
narrower than I’d imagined. It struck me as rather odd that picture had
escaped my memory until now. What had struck me at the time was the neat
appearance of the guillotine; its shining surfaces and finish reminded
me of some laboratory instrument. One always has exaggerated ideas about
what one doesn’t know. Now I had to admit it seemed a very simple
process, getting guillotined; the machine is on the same level as the
man, and he walks toward it as he steps forward to meet somebody he
knows. In a sense, that, too, was disappointing. The business of
climbing a scaffold, leaving the world below, so to speak, gave
something for a man’s imagination to get hold of. But, as it was, the
machine dominated everything; they killed you discreetly, with a hint of
shame and much efficiency.</p>
<p>There were two other things about which I was always thinking: the
dawn and my appeal. However, I did my best to keep my mind off these
thoughts. I lay down, looked up at the sky, and forced myself to study
it. When the light began to turn green I knew that night was coming.
Another thing I did to deflect the course of my thoughts was to listen
to my heart. I couldn’t imagine that this faint throbbing which had been
with me for so long would ever cease. Imagination has never been one of
my strong points. Still, I tried to picture a moment when the beating of
my heart no longer echoed in my head. But, in vain. The dawn and my
appeal were still there. And I ended by believing it was a silly thing
to try to force one’s thoughts out of their natural groove.</p>
<p>They always came for one at dawn; that much I knew. So, really, all
my nights were spent in waiting for that dawn. I have never liked being
taken by surprise. When something happens to me I want to be ready for
it. That’s why I got into the habit of sleeping off and on in the
daytime and watching through the night for the first hint of daybreak in
the dark dome above. The worst period of the night was that vague hour
when, I knew, they usually come; once it was after midnight I waited,
listening intently. Never before had my ears perceived so many noises,
such tiny sounds. Still, I must say I was lucky in one respect; never
during any of those periods did I hear footsteps. Mother used to say
that however miserable one is, there’s always something to be thankful
for. And each morning, when the sky brightened and light began to flood
my cell, I agreed with her. Because I might just as well have heard
footsteps, and felt my heart shattered into bits. Even though the
faintest rustle sent me hurrying to the door and, pressing an ear to the
rough, cold wood, I listened so intently that I could hear my breathing,
quick and hoarse like a dog’s panting—even so there was an end; my heart
hadn’t split, and I knew I had another twenty-four hours’ respite.</p>
<p>Then all day there was my appeal to think about. I made the most of
this idea, studying my effects so as to squeeze out the maximum of
consolation. Thus, I always began by assuming the worst; my appeal was
dismissed. That meant, of course, I was to die. Sooner than others,
obviously. “But,” I reminded myself, “it’s common knowledge that life
isn’t worth living, anyhow.” And, on a wide view, I could see that it
makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or
threescore and ten—since, in either case, other men and women will
continue living, the world will go on as before. Also, whether I died
now or forty years hence, this business of dying had to be got through,
inevitably. Still, somehow this line of thought wasn’t as consoling as
it should have been; the idea of all those years of life in hand was a
galling reminder! However, I could argue myself out of it, by picturing
what would have been my feelings when my term was up, and death had
cornered me. Once you’re up against it, the precise manner of your death
has obviously small importance. Therefore—but it was hard not to lose
the thread of the argument leading up to that “therefore”—I should be
prepared to face the dismissal of my appeal.</p>
<p>At this stage, but only at this stage, I had, so to speak, the right,
and accordingly I gave myself leave, to consider the other alternative;
that my appeal was successful. And then the trouble was to calm down
that sudden rush of joy racing through my body and even bringing tears
to my eyes. But it was up to me to bring my nerves to heel and steady my
mind; for, even in considering this possibility, I had to keep some
order in my thoughts, so as to make my consolations, as regards the
first alternative, more plausible. When I’d succeeded, I had earned a
good hour’s peace of mind; and that, anyhow, was something.</p>
<p>It was at one of these moments that I refused once again to see the
chaplain. I was lying down and could mark the summer evening coming on
by a soft golden glow spreading across the sky. I had just turned down
my appeal, and felt my blood circulating with slow, steady throbs. No, I
didn’t want to see the chaplain… Then I did something I hadn’t done for
quite a while; I fell to thinking about Marie. She hadn’t written for
ages; probably, I surmised, she had grown tired of being the mistress of
a man sentenced to death. Or she might be ill, or dead. After all, such
things happen. How could I have known about it, since, apart from our
two bodies, separated now, there was no link between us, nothing to
remind us of each other? Supposing she were dead, her memory would mean
nothing; I couldn’t feel an interest in a dead girl. This seemed to me
quite normal; just as I realized people would soon forget me once I was
dead. I couldn’t even say that this was hard to stomach; really, there’s
no idea to which one doesn’t get acclimatized in time.</p>
<p>My thoughts had reached this point when the chaplain walked in,
unannounced. I couldn’t help giving a start on seeing him. He noticed
this evidently, as he promptly told me not to be alarmed. I reminded him
that usually his visits were at another hour, and for a pretty grim
occasion. This, he replied, was just a friendly visit; it had no concern
with my appeal, about which he knew nothing. Then he sat down on my bed,
asking me to sit beside him. I refused—not because I had anything
against him; he seemed a mild, amiable man.</p>
<p>He remained quite still at first, his arms resting on his knees, his
eyes fixed on his hands. They were slender but sinewy hands, which made
me think of two nimble little animals. Then he gently rubbed them
together. He stayed so long in the same position that for a while I
almost forgot he was there.</p>
<p>All of a sudden he jerked his head up and looked me in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Why,” he asked, “don’t you let me come to see you?”</p>
<p>I explained that I didn’t believe in God.</p>
<p>“Are you really so sure of that?”</p>
<p>I said I saw no point in troubling my head about the matter; whether
I believed or didn’t was, to my mind, a question of so little
importance.</p>
<p>He then leaned back against the wall, laying his hands flat on his
thighs. Almost without seeming to address me, he remarked that he’d
often noticed one fancies one is quite sure about something, when in
point of fact one isn’t. When I said nothing, he looked at me again, and
asked:</p>
<p>“Don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>I said that seemed quite possible. But, though I mightn’t be so sure
about what interested me, I was absolutely sure about what didn’t
interest me. And the question he had raised didn’t interest me at
all.</p>
<p>He looked away and, without altering his posture, asked if it was
because I felt utterly desperate that I spoke like this. I explained
that it wasn’t despair I felt, but fear—which was natural enough.</p>
<p>“In that case,” he said firmly, “God can help you. All the men I’ve
seen in your position turned to Him in their time of trouble.”</p>
<p>Obviously, I replied, they were at liberty to do so, if they felt
like it. I, however, didn’t want to be helped, and I hadn’t time to work
up interest for something that didn’t interest me.</p>
<p>He fluttered his hands fretfully; then, sitting up, smoothed out his
cassock. When this was done he began talking again, addressing me as “my
friend.” It wasn’t because I’d been condemned to death, he said, that he
spoke to me in this way. In his opinion every man on the earth was under
sentence of death.</p>
<p>There, I interrupted him; that wasn’t the same thing, I pointed out,
and, what’s more, could be no consolation.</p>
<p>He nodded. “Maybe. Still, if you don’t die soon, you’ll die one day.
And then the same question will arise. How will you face that terrible,
final hour?”</p>
<p>I replied that I’d face it exactly as I was facing it now.</p>
<p>Thereat he stood up, and looked me straight in the eyes. It was a
trick I knew well. I used to amuse myself trying it on Emmanuel and
Céleste, and nine times out of ten they’d look away uncomfortably. I
could see the chaplain was an old hand at it, as his gaze never
faltered. And his voice was quite steady when he said: “Have you no hope
at all? Do you really think that when you die you die outright, and
nothing remains?”</p>
<p>I said: “Yes.”</p>
<p>He dropped his eyes and sat down again. He was truly sorry for me, he
said. It must make life unbearable for a man, to think as I did.</p>
<p>The priest was beginning to bore me, and, resting a shoulder on the
wall, just beneath the little skylight, I looked away. Though I didn’t
trouble much to follow what he said, I gathered he was questioning me
again. Presently his tone became agitated, urgent, and, as I realized
that he was genuinely distressed, I began to pay more attention.</p>
<p>He said he felt convinced my appeal would succeed, but I was saddled
with a load of guilt, of which I must get rid. In his view man’s justice
was a vain thing; only God’s justice mattered. I pointed out that the
former had condemned me. Yes, he agreed, but it hadn’t absolved me from
my sin. I told him that I wasn’t conscious of any “sin”; all I knew was
that I’d been guilty of a criminal offense. Well, I was paying the
penalty of that offense, and no one had the right to expect anything
more of me.</p>
<p>Just then he got up again, and it struck me that if he wanted to move
in this tiny cell, almost the only choice lay between standing up and
sitting down. I was staring at the floor. He took a single step toward
me, and halted, as if he didn’t dare to come nearer. Then he looked up
through the bars at the sky. “You’re mistaken, my son,” he said gravely.
“There’s more that might be required of you. And perhaps it will be
required of you.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You might be asked to see…”</p>
<p>“To see what?”</p>
<p>Slowly the priest gazed round my cell, and I was struck by the
sadness of his voice when he replied:</p>
<p>“These stone walls, I know it only too well, are steeped in human
suffering. I’ve never been able to look at them without a shudder. And
yet—believe me, I am speaking from the depths of my heart—I know that
even the wretchedest amongst you have sometimes seen, taking form
against that grayness, a divine face. It’s that face you are asked to
see.”</p>
<p>This roused me a little. I informed him that I’d been staring at
those walls for months; there was nobody, nothing in the world, I knew
better than I knew them. And once upon a time, perhaps, I used to try to
see a face. But it was a sun-gold face, lit up with desire—Marie’s face.
I had no luck; I’d never seen it, and now I’d given up trying. Indeed,
I’d never seen anything “taking form,” as he called it, against those
gray walls.</p>
<p>The chaplain gazed at me with a sort of sadness. I now had my back to
the wall and light was flowing over my forehead. He muttered some words
I didn’t catch; then abruptly asked if he might kiss me. I said, “No.”
Then he turned, came up to the wall, and slowly drew his hand along
it.</p>
<p>“Do you really love these earthly things so very much?” he asked in a
low voice.</p>
<p>I made no reply.</p>
<p>For quite a while he kept his eyes averted. His presence was getting
more and more irksome, and I was on the point of telling him to go, and
leave me in peace, when all of a sudden he swung round on me, and burst
out passionately:</p>
<p>“No! No! I refuse to believe it. I’m sure you’ve often wished there
was an afterlife.”</p>
<p>Of course I had, I told him. Everybody has that wish at times. But
that had no more importance than wishing to be rich, or to swim very
fast, or to have a better-shaped mouth. It was in the same order of
things. I was going on in the same vein, when he cut in with a question.
How did I picture the life after the grave?</p>
<p>I fairly bawled out at him: “A life in which I can remember this life
on earth. That’s all I want of it.” And in the same breath I told him
I’d had enough of his company.</p>
<p>But, apparently, he had more to say on the subject of God. I went
close up to him and made a last attempt to explain that I’d very little
time left, and I wasn’t going to waste it on God.</p>
<p>Then he tried to change the subject by asking me why I hadn’t once
addressed him as “Father,” seeing that he was a priest. That irritated
me still more, and I told him he wasn’t my father; quite the contrary,
he was on the others’ side.</p>
<p>“No, no, my son,” he said, laying his hand on my shoulder. “I’m on
your side, though you don’t realize it—because your heart is hardened.
But I shall pray for you.”</p>
<p>Then, I don’t know how it was, but something seemed to break inside
me, and I started yelling at the top of my voice. I hurled insults at
him, I told him not to waste his rotten prayers on me; it was better to
burn than to disappear. I’d taken him by the neckband of his cassock,
and, in a sort of ecstasy of joy and rage, I poured out on him all the
thoughts that had been simmering in my brain. He seemed so cocksure, you
see. And yet none of his certainties was worth one strand of a woman’s
hair. Living as he did, like a corpse, he couldn’t even be sure of being
alive. It might look as if my hands were empty. Actually, I was sure of
myself, sure about everything, far surer than he; sure of my present
life and of the death that was coming. That, no doubt, was all I had;
but at least that certainty was something I could get my teeth into—just
as it had got its teeth into me. I’d been right, I was still right, I
was always right. I’d passed my life in a certain way, and I might have
passed it in a different way, if I’d felt like it. I’d acted thus, and I
hadn’t acted otherwise; I hadn’t done x, whereas I had done y or z. And
what did that mean? That, all the time, I’d been waiting for this
present moment, for that dawn, tomorrow’s or another day’s, which was to
justify me. Nothing, nothing had the least importance and I knew quite
well why. He, too, knew why. From the dark horizon of my future a sort
of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long,
from the years that were to come. And on its way that breeze had leveled
out all the ideas that people tried to foist on me in the equally unreal
years I then was living through. What difference could they make to me,
the deaths of others, or a mother’s love, or his God; or the way a man
decides to live, the fate he thinks he chooses, since one and the same
fate was bound to “choose” not only me but thousands of millions of
privileged people who, like him, called themselves my brothers. Surely,
surely he must see that? Every man alive was privileged; there was only
one class of men, the privileged class. All alike would be condemned to
die one day; his turn, too, would come like the others’. And what
difference could it make if, after being charged with murder, he were
executed because he didn’t weep at his mother’s funeral, since it all
came to the same thing in the end? The same thing for Salamano’s wife
and for Salamano’s dog. That little robot woman was as “guilty” as the
girl from Paris who had married Masson, or as Marie, who wanted me to
marry her. What did it matter if Raymond was as much my pal as Céleste,
who was a far worthier man? What did it matter if at this very moment
Marie was kissing a new boy friend? As a condemned man himself, couldn’t
he grasp what I meant by that dark wind blowing from my future?…</p>
<p>I had been shouting so much that I’d lost my breath, and just then
the jailers rushed in and started trying to release the chaplain from my
grip. One of them made as if to strike me. The chaplain quietened them
down, then gazed at me for a moment without speaking. I could see tears
in his eyes. Then he turned and left the cell.</p>
<p>Once he’d gone, I felt calm again. But all this excitement had
exhausted me and I dropped heavily on to my sleeping plank. I must have
had a longish sleep, for, when I woke, the stars were shining down on my
face. Sounds of the countryside came faintly in, and the cool night air,
veined with smells’ of earth and salt, fanned my cheeks. The marvelous
peace of the sleepbound summer night flooded through me like a tide.
Then, just on the edge of daybreak, I heard a steamer’s siren. People
were starting on a voyage to a world which had ceased to concern me
forever. Almost for the first time in many months I thought of my
mother. And now, it seemed to me, I understood why at her life’s end she
had taken on a “fiancé”; why she’d played at making a fresh start.
There, too, in that Home where lives were flickering out, the dusk came
as a mournful solace. With death so near, Mother must have felt like
someone on the brink of freedom, ready to start life all over again. No
one, no one in the world had any right to weep for her. And I, too, felt
ready to start life all over again. It was as if that great rush of
anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the
dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the
first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.
To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that
I’d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished,
for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the
day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that
they should greet me with howls of execration.</p>
