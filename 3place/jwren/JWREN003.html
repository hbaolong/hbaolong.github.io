<h4 id="ii">II</h4>
<p>On waking I understood why my employer had looked rather cross when I
asked for my two days off; it’s a Saturday today. I hadn’t thought of
this at the time; it only struck me when I was getting out of bed.
Obviously he had seen that it would mean my getting four days’ holiday
straight off, and one couldn’t expect him to like that. Still, for one
thing, it wasn’t my fault if Mother was buried yesterday and not today;
and then, again, I’d have had my Saturday and Sunday off in any case.
But naturally this didn’t prevent me from seeing my employer’s
point.</p>
<p>Getting up was an effort, as I’d been really exhausted by the
previous day’s experiences. While shaving, I wondered how to spend the
morning, and decided that a swim would do me good. So I caught the
streetcar that goes down to the harbor.</p>
<p>It was quite like old times; a lot of young people were in the
swimming pool, amongst them Marie Cardona, who used to be a typist at
the office. I was rather keen on her in those days, and I fancy she
liked me, too. But she was with us so short a time that nothing came of
it.</p>
<p>While I was helping her to climb on to a raft, I let my hand stray
over her breasts. Then she lay flat on the raft, while I trod water.
After a moment she turned and looked at me. Her hair was over her eyes
and she was laughing. I clambered up on to the raft, beside her. The air
was pleasantly warm, and, half jokingly, I let my head sink back upon
her lap. She didn’t seem to mind, so I let it stay there. I had the sky
full in my eyes, all blue and gold, and I could feel Marie’s stomach
rising and falling gently under my head. We must have stayed a good
half-hour on the raft, both of us half asleep. When the sun got too hot
she dived off and I followed. I caught up with her, put my arm round her
waist, and we swam side by side. She was still laughing.</p>
<p>While we were drying ourselves on the edge of the swimming pool she
said: “I’m browner than you.” I asked her if she’d come to the movies
with me that evening. She laughed again and said, “Yes,” if I’d take her
to the comedy everybody was talking about, the one with Fernandel in
it.</p>
<p>When we had dressed, she stared at my black tie and asked if I was in
mourning. I explained that my mother had died. “When?” she asked, and I
said, “Yesterday.” She made no remark, though I thought she shrank away
a little. I was just going to explain to her that it wasn’t my fault,
but I checked myself, as I remembered having said the same thing to my
employer, and realizing then it sounded rather foolish. Still, foolish
or not, somehow one can’t help feeling a bit guilty, I suppose.</p>
<p>Anyhow, by evening Marie had forgotten all about it. The film was
funny in parts, but some of it was downright stupid. She pressed her leg
against mine while we were in the picture house, and I was fondling her
breast. Toward the end of the show I kissed her, but rather clumsily.
Afterward she came back with me to my place.</p>
<p>When I woke up, Marie had gone. She’d told me her aunt expected her
first thing in the morning. I remembered it was a Sunday, and that put
me off; I’ve never cared for Sundays. So I turned my head and lazily
sniffed the smell of brine that Marie’s head had left on the pillow. I
slept until ten. After that I stayed in bed until noon, smoking
cigarettes. I decided not to lunch at Céleste’s restaurant as I usually
did; they’d be sure to pester me with questions, and I dislike being
questioned. So I fried some eggs and ate them off the pan. I did without
bread as there wasn’t any left, and I couldn’t be bothered going down to
buy it.</p>
<p>After lunch I felt at loose ends and roamed about the little flat. It
suited us well enough when Mother was with me, but now that I was by
myself it was too large and I’d moved the dining table into my bedroom.
That was now the only room I used; it had all the furniture I needed: a
brass bedstead, a dressing table, some cane chairs whose seats had more
or less caved in, a wardrobe with a tarnished mirror. The rest of the
flat was never used, so I didn’t trouble to look after it.</p>
<p>A bit later, for want of anything better to do, I picked up an old
newspaper that was lying on the floor and read it. There was an
advertisement of Kruschen Salts and I cut it out and pasted in into an
album where I keep things that amuse me in the papers. Then I washed my
hands and, as a last resource, went out on to the balcony.</p>
<p>My bedroom overlooks the main street of our district. Though it was a
fine afternoon, the paving blocks were black and glistening. What few
people were about seemed in an absurd hurry. First of all there came a
family, going for their Sunday-afternoon walk; two small boys in sailor
suits, with short trousers hardly down to their knees, and looking
rather uneasy in their Sunday best; then a little girl with a big pink
bow and black patent-leather shoes. Behind them was their mother, an
enormously fat woman in a brown silk dress, and their father, a dapper
little man, whom I knew by sight. He had a straw hat, a walking stick,
and a butterfly tie. Seeing him beside his wife, I understood why people
said he came of a good family and had married beneath him.</p>
<p>Next came a group of young fellows, the local “bloods,” with sleek
oiled hair, red ties, coats cut very tight at the waist, braided
pockets, and square-toed shoes. I guessed they were going to one of the
big theaters in the center of the town. That was why they had started
out so early and were hurrying to the streetcar stop, laughing and
talking at the top of their voices.</p>
<p>After they had passed, the street gradually emptied. By this time all
the matinées must have begun. Only a few shopkeepers and cats remained
about. Above the sycamores bordering the road the sky was cloudless, but
the light was soft. The tobacconist on the other side of the street
brought a chair out on to the pavement in front of his door and sat
astride it, resting his arms on the back. The streetcars which a few
minutes before had been crowded were now almost empty. In the little
café, Chez Pierrot, beside the tobacconist’s, the waiter was sweeping up
the sawdust in the empty restaurant. A typical Sunday afternoon…</p>
<p>I turned my chair round and seated myself like the tobacconist, as it
was more comfortable that way. After smoking a couple of cigarettes I
went back to the room, got a tablet of chocolate, and returned to the
window to eat it. Soon after, the sky clouded over, and I thought a
summer storm was coming. However, the clouds gradually lifted. All the
same, they had left in the street a sort of threat of rain, which made
it darker. I stayed watching the sky for quite a while.</p>
<p>At five there was a loud clanging of streetcars. They were coming
from the stadium in our suburb where there had been a football match.
Even the back platforms were crowded and people were standing on the
steps. Then another streetcar brought back the teams. I knew they were
the players by the little suitcase each man carried. They were bawling
out their team song, “Keep the ball rolling, boys.” One of them looked
up at me and shouted, “We licked them!” I waved my hand and called back,
“Good work!” From now on there was a steady stream of private cars.</p>
<p>The sky had changed again; a reddish glow was spreading up beyond the
housetops. As dusk set in, the street grew more crowded. People were
returning from their walks, and I noticed the dapper little man with the
fat wife amongst the passers-by. Children were whimpering and trailing
wearily after their parents. After some minutes the local picture houses
disgorged their audiences. I noticed that the young fellows coming from
them were taking longer strides and gesturing more vigorously than at
ordinary times; doubtless the picture they’d been seeing was of the
wild-West variety. Those who had been to the picture houses in the
middle of the town came a little later, and looked more sedate, though a
few were still laughing. On the whole, however, they seemed languid and
exhausted. Some of them remained loitering in the street under my
window. A group of girls came by, walking arm in arm. The young men
under my window swerved so as to brush against them, and shouted
humorous remarks, which made the girls turn their heads and giggle. I
recognized them as girls from my part of the town, and two or three of
them, whom I knew, looked up and waved to me.</p>
<p>Just then the street lamps came on, all together, and they made the
stars that were beginning to glimmer in the night sky paler still. I
felt my eyes getting tired, what with the lights and all the movement
I’d been watching in the street. There were little pools of brightness
under the lamps, and now and then a streetcar passed, lighting up a
girl’s hair, or a smile, or a silver bangle.</p>
<p>Soon after this, as the streetcars became fewer and the sky showed
velvety black above the trees and lamps, the street grew emptier, almost
imperceptibly, until a time came when there was nobody to be seen and a
cat, the first of the evening, crossed, unhurrying, the deserted
street.</p>
<p>It struck me that I’d better see about some dinner. I had been
leaning so long on the back of my chair, looking down, that my neck hurt
when I straightened myself up. I went down, bought some bread and
spaghetti, did my cooking, and ate my meal standing. I’d intended to
smoke another cigarette at my window, but the night had turned rather
chilly and I decided against it. As I was coming back, after shutting
the window, I glanced at the mirror and saw reflected in it a corner of
my table with my spirit lamp and some bits of bread beside it. It
occurred to me that somehow I’d got through another Sunday, that Mother
now was buried, and tomorrow I’d be going back to work as usual. Really,
nothing in my life had changed.</p>
