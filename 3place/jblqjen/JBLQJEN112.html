<p>THE CAST</p>
<p>Lazarus</p>
<p>Mary, his sister</p>
<p>Martha, his sister</p>
<p>The mother of Lazarus</p>
<p>Philip, a disciple</p>
<p>A Madman</p>
<p>THE SCENE</p>
<p>The garden outside of the home of Lazarus and his mother and sisters
in Bethany</p>
<p>Late afternoon of Monday, the day after the resurrection of Jesus of
Nazareth from the grave.</p>
<p>At curtain rise: Mary is at right gazing up towards the hills. Martha
is seated at her loom near the house door, left. The Madman is seated
around the corner of the house, and against its wall, down left.</p>
<p>THE PLAY</p>
<p>Mary: (Turning to Martha) You do not work. You have not worked much
lately.</p>
<p>Martha: You are not thinking of my work. My idleness makes you think
of what our Master said. Oh, beloved Master!</p>
<p>The Madman: The day shall come when there will be no weaver, and no
one to wear the cloth. We shall all stand naked in the sun.</p>
<p>(There is a long silence. The women do not appear to have heard The
Madman speaking. They never hear him.)</p>
<p>Mary: It is getting late.</p>
<p>Martha: Yes, yes, I know. It is getting late.</p>
<p>(The mother enters, coming out from the house door.)</p>
<p>Mother: Has he not returned yet?</p>
<p>Martha: No, mother, he has not returned yet.</p>
<p>(The three women look towards the hills.)</p>
<p>The Madman: He himself will never return. All that you may see is a
breath struggling in a body.</p>
<p>Mary: It seems to me that he has not yet returned from the other
world.</p>
<p>Mother: The death of our Master has afflicted him deeply, and during
these last days he has hardly eaten a morsel, and I know at night that
he does not sleep. Surely it must have been the death of our Friend.</p>
<p>Martha: No, mother. There is something else; something I do not
understand.</p>
<p>Mary: Yes, yes. There is something else. I know it, too. I have known
it all these days, yet I cannot explain it. His eyes are deeper. He
gazes at me as though he were seeing someone else through me. He is
tender but his tenderness is for someone not here. And he is silent,
silent as if the seal of death is yet upon his lips.</p>
<p>(A silence falls over the three women.)</p>
<p>The Madman: Everyone looks through everyone else to see someone
else.</p>
<p>Mother: (Breaking the silence) Would that he’d return. Of late he has
spent too many hours among those hills alone. He should be here with
us.</p>
<p>Mary: Mother, he has not been with us for a long time.</p>
<p>Martha: Why, he has always been with us, only those three days!</p>
<p>Mary: Three days? Three days! Yes, Martha, you are right. It was only
three days.</p>
<p>Mother: I wish my son would return from the hills.</p>
<p>Martha: He will come soon, mother. You must not worry.</p>
<p>Mary: (in a strange voice) Sometimes I feel that he will never come
back from the hills.</p>
<p>Mother: If he came back from the grave, the surely he will come back
from the hills. And oh, my daughters, to think that the One who gave us
back his life was slain but yesterday.</p>
<p>Mary: Oh the mystery of it, and the pain of it.</p>
<p>Mother: Oh, to think that they could be so cruel to the One who gave
my son back to my heart.</p>
<p>(A silence)</p>
<p>Martha: But Lazarus should not stay so long among the hills.</p>
<p>Mary: It is easy for one in a dream to lose his way among the olive
groves. And I know a place where Lazarus loved to sit and dream and be
still. Oh, mother, it is beside a little stream. If you do not know the
place you could not find it. He took me there once, and we sat on two
stones, like children. It was spring, and little flowers were growing
beside us. We often spoke of that place during the winter season. And
each time that he spoke of that place a strange light came into his
eyes.</p>
<p>The Madman: Yes, that strange light, that shadow cast by the other
light.</p>
<p>Mary: And mother, you know that Lazarus has always been away from us,
though he was always with us.</p>
<p>Mother: You say so many things I cannot understand. (Pause) I wish my
son would come back from the hills. I wish he would come back! (Pause) I
must go in now. The lentils must not be overcooked.</p>
<p>(The mother exits through the door)</p>
<p>Martha: I wish I could understand all that you say, Mary. When you
speak it is as though someone else is speaking.</p>
<p>Mary: (Her voice a little strange) I know, my sister, I know.
Whenever we speak it is someone else who is speaking.</p>
<p>(There is a prolonged silence. Mary is faraway in her thoughts, and
Martha watches her half-curiously. Lazarus enters, coming from the
hills, back left. He throws himself upon the grass under the almond
trees near the house.)</p>
<p>Mary: (Running toward him) Oh Lazarus, you are tired and weary. You
should not have walked so far.</p>
<p>Lazarus: (Speaking absently) Walking, walking and going nowhere;
seeking and finding nothing. But it is better to be among the hills.</p>
<p>The Madman: Well, after all it is a cubit nearer to the other
hills.</p>
<p>Martha: (After brief silence) But you are not well, and you leave us
all day long, and we are much concerned. What you came back, Lazarus,
you made us happy. But in leaving us alone here you turn our happiness
into anxiety.</p>
<p>Lazarus: (Turning his face toward the hills) Did I leave you long
this day? Strange that you should call a moment among the hills a
separation. Did I truly stay more that a moment among the hills?</p>
<p>Martha: You have been gone all day.</p>
<p>Lazarus: To think, to think! A whole day among the hills! Who would
believe it?</p>
<p>(A silence. The mother enters, coming out from the house door.)</p>
<p>Mother: Oh, my son, I am glad you have come back. It is late and the
mist is gathering upon the hills. I feared for you my son.</p>
<p>The Madman: They are afraid of the mist. And the mist is their
beginning and the mist is their end.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Yes, I have come back to you from the hills. The pity of it,
the pity of it all.</p>
<p>Mother: What is it Lazarus? What is the pity of it all?</p>
<p>Lazarus: Nothing, mother. Nothing.</p>
<p>Mother: You speak strangely. I do not understand you, Lazarus. You
have said little since your home-coming. But whatever you have said has
been strange to me.</p>
<p>Martha: Yes, strange.</p>
<p>(There is a pause.)</p>
<p>Mother: And now the mist is gathering here. Let us go into the house.
Come, my children.</p>
<p>(The mother, after kissing Lazarus with wistful tenderness, enters
the house.)</p>
<p>Martha: Yes, there is a chill in the air. I must take my loom and my
linen indoors.</p>
<p>Mary: (sitting down beside Lazarus on the grass under the almond
trees, and speaking to Martha) It is true the April evenings are not
good for either your loom or your linen. Would you want me to help you
take your loom indoors?</p>
<p>Martha: No, no. I can do it alone. I have always done it alone.</p>
<p>(Martha carries her loom into the house, then she returns for the
linen, taking that in also. A wind passes by, shaking the almond tree,
and a drift of petals falls over Mary and Lazarus.)</p>
<p>Lazarus: Even spring would comfort us, and even the trees would weep
for us. All there is on earth, if all there is on earth could know our
downfall and our grief, would pity us and weep for us.</p>
<p>Mary: But spring is with us, and though veiled with the veil of
sorrow, yet it is spring. Let us not speak of pity. Let us rather accept
both our spring and our sorrow with gratitude. And let us wonder in
sweet silence at Him who gave you life yet yielded His own life. Let us
not speak of pity, Lazarus.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Pity, pity that I should be torn away from a thousand
thousand years of heart’s desire, a thousand thousand years of heart’s
hunger. Pity that after a thousand thousand springs I am turned to this
winter.</p>
<p>Mary: What do you mean, my brother? Why do you speak of a thousand
thousand springs? You were but three days away from us. Three short
days. But our sorrow was indeed longer than three days.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Three days? Three centuries, three aeons! All of time! All
of time with the one my soul loved before time began.</p>
<p>The Madman: Yes, three days, three centuries, three aeons. Strange
they would always weigh and measure. It is always a sundial and a pair
of scales.</p>
<p>Mary: (In amazement) The one you soul loved before time began?
Lazarus, why do you say these things? It is but a dream you dreamed in
another garden. Now we are here in this garden, a stone’s throw from
Jerusalem. We are here. And you know well, my brother, that our Master
would have you be with us in this awakening to dream of life and love;
and He would have you an ardent disciple, a living witness of His
glory.</p>
<p>Lazarus: There is no dream here and there is no awakening. You and I
and this garden are but an illusion, a shadow of the real. The awakening
is there where I was with my beloved and the reality.</p>
<p>Mary: (Rising) Your beloved?</p>
<p>Lazarus: (Also rising) My beloved.</p>
<p>The Madman: Yes, yes. His beloved, the space virgin, the beloved of
everyman.</p>
<p>Mary: But where is your beloved? Who is your beloved?</p>
<p>Lazarus: My twin heart whom I sought here and did not find. Then
death, the angel with winged feet, came and led my longing to her
longing, and I lived with her in the very heart of God. And I became
nearer to her and she to me, and we were one. We were a sphere that
shines in the sun; and we were a song among the stars. All this, Mary,
all this and more, till a voice, a voice from the depths, the voice of a
world called me; and that which was inseparable was torn asunder. And
the thousand thousand years with my beloved in space could not guard me
from the power of that voice which called me back.</p>
<p>Mary: (Looking unto the sky) O blessed angels of our silent hours,
make me to understand this thing! I would not be an alien in this new
land discovered by death. Say more, my brother, go on. I believe in my
heart I can follow you.</p>
<p>The Madman: Follow him, if you can, little woman. Shall the turtle
follow the stag?</p>
<p>Lazarus: I was a stream and I sought the sea where my beloved dwells,
and when I reached the sea I was brought to the hills to run again among
the rocks. I was a song imprisoned in silence, longing for the heart of
my beloved, and when the winds of heaven released me and uttered me in
that green forest I was recaptured by a voice, and I was turned again
into silence. I was a root in the dark earth, and I became a flower and
then a fragrance in space rising to enfold my beloved, and I was caught
and gathered by hand, and I was made a root again, a root in the dark
earth.</p>
<p>The Madman: If you are a root you can always escape the tempests in
the branches. And it is good to be a running stream even after you have
reached the sea. Of course it is good for water to run upward.</p>
<p>Mary: (To herself) Oh strange, passing strange! (To Lazarus) But my
brother it is good to be a running stream, and it is not good to be a
song not yet sung, and it is good to be a root in the dark earth. The
Master knew all this and He called you back to us that we may know there
is no veil between life and death. Do you not see how one word uttered
in love may bring together elements scattered by an illusion called
death? Believe and have faith, for only in faith, which is our deeper
knowledge, can you find comfort.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Comfort! Comfort the treacherous, the deadly! Comfort that
cheats our senses and makes us slaves to the passing hour! I would not
have comfort. I would have passion! I would burn in the cool space with
my beloved. I would be in the boundless space with my mate, my other
self. O Mary, Mary, you were once my sister, and we knew one another
even when our nearest kin knew us not. Now listen to me, listen to me
with your heart.</p>
<p>Mary: I am listening, Lazarus.</p>
<p>The Madman: Let the whole world listen. The sky will now speak to the
earth, but the earth is deaf as you and I.</p>
<p>Lazarus: We were in space, my beloved and I, and we were all space.
We were in light and we were all light. And we roamed even like the
ancient spirit that moved upon the face of the waters; and it was
forever the first day. We were love itself that dwells in the heart of
the white silence. Then a voice like thunder, a voice like countless
spears piercing the ether, cried out saying, “Lazarus, come forth!” And
the voice echoed and re-echoed in space, and I, even as a flood tide
became an ebbing tide; a house divided, a garment rent, a youth unspent,
a tower that fell down, and out of its broken stones a landmark was
made. A voice cried “Lazarus, come forth!” and I descended from the
mansion of the sky to a tomb within a tomb, this body in a sealed
cave.</p>
<p>The Madman: Master of the caravan, where are your camels and where
are your men? Was it the hungry earth that swallowed them? Was it the
simoom that shrouded them with sand? No! Jesus of Nazareth raised His
hand, Jesus of Nazareth uttered a word; and tell me now, where are your
camels and where are your men, and where are your treasures? In the
trackless sand, in the trackless sand. But the moon will always come
again.</p>
<p>Mary: Oh, it is like a dream dreamt upon a mountaintop. I know, my
brother, I know the world you have visited, though I have never seen it.
Yet all that you say is passing strange. It is a tale told by someone
across a valley, and I can hardly hear it.</p>
<p>Lazarus: It is all so different across the valley. There is no weight
there and there is no measure. You are with your beloved.</p>
<p>(A silence)</p>
<p>Lazarus: O my beloved! O my beloved fragrance in space! Wings that
were spread for me! Tell me, tell me in the stillness of my heart, do
you seek me, and was it pain to you to be separated from me? Was I also
a fragrance and wings spread in space? And tell me now, my beloved, was
there a double cruelty, was there a brother of His in another world who
called you from life to death, and had you a mother and sisters and
friends who deemed it a miracle? Was there a double cruelty performed in
blessedness?</p>
<p>Mary: No, no, my brother. There is only one Jesus of one world. All
else is but a dream, even as your beloved.</p>
<p>Lazarus: (With great passion) No, no! If He is not a dream then He is
nothing. If He had not known what is beyond Jerusalem, then He is
nothing. If He did not know my beloved in space then He was not the
Master. O my friend Jesus, you once gave me a cup of wine across the
table, and you said, “Drink this in remembrance of me.” And you dipped a
morsel of bread in the oil, and you said, “Eat this, it is my share of
the loaf.” O my friend, you have put your arm on my shoulder and called
me “son.” My mother and my sisters have said in their hearts, “He loves
our Lazarus.” And I loved you. And then you went away to build more
towers in the sky, and I went to my beloved. Tell me now, tell me, why
did you bring me back? Did you not know in your knowing heart that I was
with my beloved? Did you not meet her in you wandering above the summits
of Lebanon? Surely you saw her image in my eyes when I came and stood
before you at the door of the tomb. And have you not a beloved in the
sun? And would you have a greater one than yourself separate you from
her? And after separation what would you say? What shall I say to you
now?</p>
<p>The Madman: He bade me also to come back but I did not obey, and now
they call me mad.</p>
<p>Mary: Lazarus, Have I a beloved in the sky? Has my longing created a
being beyond this world? And must I die to be with him? Oh, my brother,
tell me, have I a mate also? If this thing be so, how good it is to live
and die, and live and die again; if a beloved awaits me, to fulfil all
that I am, and I to fulfil all that he is!</p>
<p>The Madman: Everywoman has a beloved in the sky. The heart of
everywoman creates a being in space.</p>
<p>Mary: (Repeating softly as if to herself) Have I a beloved in the
sky?</p>
<p>Lazarus: I do not know. But if you had a beloved, an other self,
somewhere, somewhen, and you should meet him, surely there would not be
one to separate you from him.</p>
<p>The Madman: He may be here, and He may call her. But like many others
she may not hear.</p>
<p>Lazarus: (Coming to the centre of stage) To wait, to wait for each
season to overcome another season; and then to wait for that season to
be overcome by another; to watch all things ending before your own end
comes-your end which is your beginning. To listen to all voices, and to
know that they melt to silence, all save the voice of your heart that
would cry even in sleep.</p>
<p>The Madman: The children of God married the children of men. Then
they were divorced. Now, the children of men long for the children of
God. I pity them all, the children of men and the children of God.</p>
<p>(A silence)</p>
<p>Martha: (Appearing in the doorway) Why don’t you come into the house,
Lazarus? Our mother has prepared the supper. (With a little impatience)
Whenever you and Mary are together you talk and talk, and no one knows
what you say.</p>
<p>(Martha stands for a sew seconds, then goes into the house.)</p>
<p>Lazarus: (Speaking to himself, and as though he has not heard Martha)
Oh, I am spent. I am wasted, I am hungry and I am thirsty. Would that
you could give me some bread and some wine.</p>
<p>Mary: (Going to him and putting her arm around him) I will, I will,
my brother. But some into the house. Our mother has prepared the evening
meal.</p>
<p>The Madman: He asks for bread which they cannot bake, and wine for
which they have no bottles.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Did I say I was hungry and thirsty? I am not hungry for your
bread, nor thirsty for your wine. I tell you I shall not enter a house
until my beloved’s hand is upon the latch of the door. I shall not sit
at the feast till she be at my side.</p>
<p>(Mother peers from the house door.)</p>
<p>Mother: Now, Lazarus, why do you stay out in the mist? And you, Mary,
why do you not come into the house? I have lit the candles and the food
is upon the board, and yet you will stay out babbling and chewing your
words in the dark.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Mine own mother would have me enter a tomb. She would have
me eat and drink and she would even bid me sit among shrouded faces and
receive eternity from withered hands and draw life from clay cups.</p>
<p>The Madman: White bird that flew southward where the sun loves all
things, what held you in mid-air, and who brought you back? It was your
friend, Jesus of Nazareth. He brought you back out of pity for the
wingless who would not be along. Oh, white bird, it is cold here, and
you shiver and the North wind laughs in your feathers.</p>
<p>Lazarus: You would be in a house and under a roof. You would be
within four walls, with a door and a window. You would be here, and you
are without vision. Your mind is here, and my spirit is there. All of
you is upon the earth; all of me is in space. You creep into houses, and
I flew beyond upon the mountaintop. You are all slaves, the one to the
other, and you worship but yourselves. You sleep and you dream not; you
wake but you walk not among the hills. And yesterday I was weary of you
and of lives, and I sought the other world which you call death, and if
I had died it was out of longing. Now, I stand here at this moment,
rebelling against that which you call life.</p>
<p>Martha: (Who has come out of the house while Lazarus was speaking)
But the Master saw our sorrow and our pain, and He called you back to
us, and yet you rebel. Oh, what cloth, rebelling against its own weaver!
What a house rebelling against its own builder!</p>
<p>Mary: He knew our hearts and He was gracious unto us, and when He met
our mother and saw in her eyes a dead son, buried, then her sorrow held
Him, and for a moment He was still, and He was silent. (Pause) Then we
followed Him to your tomb.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Yes, it was my mother’s sorrow, and your sorrow. It was
pity, self-pity, that brought me back. How selfish is self-pity, and how
deep. I say that I rebel. I say that divinity itself should not turn
spring to winter. I had climbed the hills in longing, and your sorrow
brought me back to this valley. You wanted a son and a brother to be
with you through life. Your neighbours wanted a miracle. You and your
neighbours, like your fathers and your forefathers, would have a
miracle, that you may believe in the simplest things in life. How cruel
you are and how hard are your hearts, and how dark is the night of your
eyes. For that you bring down the prophets from their glory to you joys,
and then you kill the prophets.</p>
<p>Martha: (with reproof) You call our sorrow self-pity. What is your
wailing but self-pity? Be quiet, and accept the life the Master has
given you.</p>
<p>Lazarus: He did not give me life, He gave you my life. He took my
life from my own beloved, and gave it to you, a miracle to open your
eyes and your ears. He sacrificed me even as He sacrificed Himself.
(Speaking unto the sky) Father, forgive them. They know not what they
do.</p>
<p>Mary: (In awe) It was He who said those very words, hanging upon the
cross.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Yes, He said these words for me as for Himself, and for all
the unknown who understand and are not understood. Did He not say these
words when your tears begged Him for my life? It was your desire and not
His will that bade His spirit to stand at the sealed door and urge
eternity to yield me unto you. It was the ancient longing for a son and
a brother that brought me back.</p>
<p>Mother: (Approaches him and puts her arm around his shoulders)
Lazarus, you were ever an obedient son and a loving son. What has
happened to you? Be with us, and forget all that troubles you.</p>
<p>Lazarus: (Raising his hand) My mother and my brothers and my sisters
are those who hear my words.</p>
<p>Mary: These are also His words.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Yes, and He said these words for me as well as for Himself,
and for all those who have earth for mother, and sky for father, and for
all those who are born free of a people and a country and a race.</p>
<p>The Madman: Captain of my ship, the wind filled your sails, and you
dared the sea; and you sought the blessed isles. What other wind changed
your course, and why did you return to these shores? It was Jesus of
Nazareth who commanded the wind with a breath of His own breath, and
then filled the sail where it was empty, and emptied it where it was
full.</p>
<p>Lazarus: (Suddenly he forgets them all, and he raises his head, and
opens his arms.) O my beloved! There was dawn in your eyes, and in that
dawn there was the silent mystery of a deep night, and the silent
promise of a full day, and I was fulfilled, and I was whole. O my
beloved, this life, this veil, is between us now. Must I live this death
and die again that I may live again? Must needs linger until all these
green things turn yellow and then naked again, and yet again? (Pause)
Oh, I cannot curse Him. But why, of all men, why should I return? Why
should I of all shepherds be driven back into the desert after the green
pasture?</p>
<p>The Madman: If you were one of those who would curse, you would not
have died so young.</p>
<p>Lazarus: Jesus of Nazareth, tell me now, why did you do this to me?
Was it fair that I should be laid down, a humble lowly sorrowful stone
leading to the height of your glory? Any one of the dead might have
served to glorify you. Why have you separated this lover from his
beloved? Why did you call me to a world which you knew in your heart you
would leave? (Then crying with a great voice) Why – why – why did you
call me from the living heart of eternity to this living death? O Jesus
of Nazareth – I cannot curse you! I cannot curse you. I would bless you.
(Silence. Lazarus becomes as one whose strength has gone out in a
stream. His head falls forward almost upon his breast. After a moment of
awful silence, he raises his head again, and with a transfigured face he
cries in a deep and thrilling voice.) Jesus of Narareth! My friend! We
have both been crucified. Forgive me! Forgive me. I bless you-now, and
forevermore.</p>
<p>(At this moment the disciple appears running from the direction of
the hills.)</p>
<p>Mary: Philip!</p>
<p>Philip: He is risen! The Master is risen from the dead and now He is
gone to Galilee.</p>
<p>The Madman: He is risen, but He will be crucified again a thousand
times.</p>
<p>Mary: Philip, my friend, what do you say?</p>
<p>Martha: (Rushes toward the disciple, and grasps him by the arms) How
glad I am to see you again. But who has risen? Of whom are you
speaking?</p>
<p>Mother: (Walking toward him) Come in, my son. You shall have supper
with us tonight.</p>
<p>Philip: (Unmoved by any of their words) I say the Master has risen
from the dead and has gone into Galilee.</p>
<p>(A deep silence falls.)</p>
<p>Lazarus: Now you shall all listen to me. If He has risen from the
dead they will crucify Him again, but they shall not crucify Him alone.
Now I shall proclaim Him, and they shall crucify me also.</p>
<p>(He turns in exaltation and walk in the direction of the hills.)</p>
<p>Lazarus: My mother and my sisters, I shall follow Him who gave me
life until He gives me death. Yes, I too would be crucified, and that
crucifixion will end this crucifixion.</p>
<p>(A silence)</p>
<p>Lazarus: Now I shall seek His spirit, and I shall be released. And
though they bind me in iron chains I shall not be bound. And though a
thousand mothers and a thousand thousand sisters shall hold my garments
I shall not be held. I shall go with the East wind where the East wind
goes. And I shall seek my beloved in the sunset where all our days find
peace. And I shall seek my beloved in the night where all the mornings
sleep. And I shall be the one man among all men who twice suffered life,
and twice death, and twice knew eternity.</p>
<p>(Lazarus looks into the face of his mother, then into the faces of
his sisters, the at Philip’s face; then again at his mother’s face. Then
as if he were a sleepwalker he turns and runs toward the hills. He
disappears. They are all dazed and shaken.)</p>
<p>Mother: My son, my son, come back to me!</p>
<p>Mary: My brother, where are you going? Oh come, my brother, come back
to us.</p>
<p>Martha: (As if to herself) It is so dark I know that he will lose his
way.</p>
<p>Mother: (Almost screaming) Lazarus, my son!</p>
<p>(A silence)</p>
<p>Philip: He has gone where we all shall go. And he shall not
return.</p>
<p>Mother: (Going to the very back of the stage, close to where he has
disappeared) Lazarus, Lazarus, my son! Come back to me! (She
shrieks.)</p>
<p>(There is a silence. The running steps of Lazarus are lost in the
distance.)</p>
<p>The Madman: Now he is gone, and he is beyond your reach. And now your
sorrow must seek another. (He pauses) Poor, poor Lazarus, the first of
the martyrs, and the greatest of them all.</p>
