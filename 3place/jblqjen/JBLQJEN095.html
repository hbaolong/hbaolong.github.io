<h4 id="she-who-was-deaf">SHE WHO WAS DEAF</h4>
<p>Once there lived a rich man who had a young wife, and she was stone
deaf.</p>
<p>And upon a morning when they were breaking their feast, she spoke to
him and she said, “Yesterday I visited the market place, and there were
exhibited silken raiment from Damascus, and coverchiefs from India,
necklaces from Persia, and bracelets from Yamman. It seems that the
caravans had but just brought these things to our city. And now behold
me, in rags, yet the wife of a rich man. I would have some of those
beautiful things.”</p>
<p>The husband, still busy with his morning coffee said, “My dear, there
is no reason why you should not go down to the Street and buy all that
your heart may desire.”</p>
<p>And the deaf wife said, “‘No!’ You always say, ‘No, no.’ Must I needs
appear in tatters among our friends to shame your wealth and my
people?”</p>
<p>And the husband said, “I did not say, ‘No.’ You may go forth freely
to the market place and purchase the most beautiful apparel and jewels
that have come to our city.”</p>
<p>But again the wife mis-read his words, and she replied, “Of all rich
men you are the most miserly. You would deny me everything of beauty and
loveliness, while other women of my age walk the gardens of the city
clothed in rich raiment.”</p>
<p>And she began to weep. And as her tears fell upon her breast she
cried out again, “You always say, ‘Nay, nay’ to me when I desire a
garment or a jewel.”</p>
<p>Then the husband was moved, and he stood up and took out of his purse
a handful of gold and placed it before her, saying in a kindly voice,
“Go down to the market place, my dear, and buy all that you will.”</p>
<p>From that day onward the deaf young wife, whenever she desired
anything, would appear before her husband with a pearly tear in her eye,
and he in silence would take out a handful of gold and place it in her
lap.</p>
<p>Now, it changed that the young woman fell in love with a youth whose
habit it was to make long journeys. And whenever he was away she would
sit in her casement and weep.</p>
<p>When her husband found her thus weeping, he would say in his heart,
“There must be some new caravan, and some silken garments and rare
jewels in the Street.”</p>
<p>And he would take a handful of gold and place it before her.</p>
