<h4 id="crime-and-punishment">Crime and Punishment</h4>
<p>Then one of the judges of the city stood forth and said, “Speak to us
of Crime and Punishment.”</p>
<p>And he answered saying:</p>
<p>It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind,</p>
<p>That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and
therefore unto yourself.</p>
<p>And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded
at the gate of the blessed.</p>
<p>Like the ocean is your god-self;</p>
<p>It remains for ever undefiled.</p>
<p>And like the ether it lifts but the winged.</p>
<p>Even like the sun is your god-self;</p>
<p>It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the
serpent.</p>
<p>But your god-self does not dwell alone in your being.</p>
<p>Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man,</p>
<p>But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its
own awakening.</p>
<p>And of the man in you would I now speak.</p>
<p>For it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that
knows crime and the punishment of crime.</p>
<p>Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as
though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder
upon your world.</p>
<p>But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond
the highest which is in each one of you,</p>
<p>So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is
in you also.</p>
<p>And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge
of the whole tree,</p>
<p>So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you
all.</p>
<p>Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self.</p>
<p>You are the way and the wayfarers.</p>
<p>And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a
caution against the stumbling stone.</p>
<p>Ay, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer
of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.</p>
<p>And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:</p>
<p>The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,</p>
<p>And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.</p>
<p>The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,</p>
<p>And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.</p>
<p>Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,</p>
<p>And still more often the condemned is the burden-bearer for the
guiltless and unblamed.</p>
<p>You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the
wicked;</p>
<p>For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black
thread and the white are woven together.</p>
<p>And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the
whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also.</p>
<p>If any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife,</p>
<p>Let him also weigh the heart of her husband in scales, and measure
his soul with measurements.</p>
<p>And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the
offended.</p>
<p>And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay
the axe unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;</p>
<p>And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the
fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of
the earth.</p>
<p>And you judges who would be just,</p>
<p>What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh
yet is a thief in spirit?</p>
<p>What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself
slain in the spirit?</p>
<p>And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an
oppressor,</p>
<p>Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged?</p>
<p>And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than
their misdeeds?</p>
<p>Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law
which you would fain serve?</p>
<p>Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the
heart of the guilty.</p>
<p>Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon
themselves.</p>
<p>And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look
upon all deeds in the fullness of light?</p>
<p>Only then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one
man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self and the day
of his god-self,</p>
<p>And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest
stone in its foundation.</p>
