the fortieth day after His death, all the women neighbours came to the
house of Mary to console her and to sing threnodies.</h4>
<p>And one of the women sang this song:</p>
<p>Whereto my Spring, whereto?</p>
<p>And to what other space your perfume ascending?</p>
<p>In what other fields shall you walk?</p>
<p>And to what sky shall you lift up your head to speak your heart?</p>
<p>These valleys shall be barren,</p>
<p>And we shall have naught but dried fields and arid.</p>
<p>All green things will parch in the sun,</p>
<p>And our orchards will bring forth sour apples,</p>
<p>And our vineyards bitter grapes.</p>
<p>We shall thirst for your wine,</p>
<p>And our nostrils will long for your fragrance.</p>
<p>Whereto Flower of our first spring., whereto?</p>
<p>And will you return no more?</p>
<p>Will not your jasmine visit us again,</p>
<p>And your cyclamen stand by our wayside</p>
<p>To tell us that we too have our roots deep in earth,</p>
<p>And that our ceaseless breath would forever climb the sky?</p>
<p>Whereto Jesus, whereto,</p>
<p>Son of my neighbour Mary,</p>
<p>And comrade to my son?</p>
<p>Whither, our first Spring, and to what other fields?</p>
<p>Will you return to us again?</p>
<p>Will you in your love-tide visit the barren shores of our dreams?</p>
<p>AHAZ THE PORTLY</p>
<p>The Keeper of the Inn</p>
<p>Well do I remember the last time I saw Jesus the Nazarene. Judas had
come to me at the noon hour of that Thursday, and bidden me prepare
supper for Jesus and His friends.</p>
<p>He gave me two silver pieces and said, “Buy all that you deem needful
for the meal.”</p>
<p>And after He was gone my wife said to me, “This is indeed a
distinction.” For Jesus had become a prophet and He had wrought many
miracles.</p>
<p>At twilight He came and His followers, and they sat in the upper
chamber around the board, but they were silent and quiet.</p>
<p>Last year also and the year before they had come and then they had
been joyous. They broke the bread and drank the wine and sang our
ancient strains; and Jesus would talk to them till midnight.</p>
<p>After that they would leave Him alone in the upper chamber and go to
sleep in other rooms; for after midnight it was His desire to be
alone.</p>
<p>And He would remain awake; I would hear His steps as I lay upon my
bed.</p>
<p>But this last time He and His friends were not happy.</p>
<p>My wife had prepared fishes from the Lake of Galilee, and pheasants
from Houran stuffed with rice and pomegranate seeds, and I had carried
them a jug of my cypress wine.</p>
<p>And then I had left them for I felt that they wished to be alone.</p>
<p>They stayed until it was full dark, and then they all descended
together from the upper chamber, but at the foot of the stairs Jesus
tarried awhile. And He looked at me and my wife, and He placed His hand
upon the head of my daughter and He said, “Good night to you all. We
shall come back again to your upper chamber, but we shall not leave you
at this early hour. We shall stay until the sun rises above the
horizon.</p>
<p>“In a little while we shall return and ask for more bread and more
wine. You and your wife have been good hosts to us, and we shall
remember you when we come to our mansion and sit at our own board.”</p>
<p>And I said, “Sir, it was an honour to serve you. The other innkeepers
envy me because of your visits, and in my pride I smile at them in the
market-place. Sometimes I even make a grimace.”</p>
<p>And He said, “All innkeepers should be proud in serving. For he who
gives bread and wine is the brother of him who reaps and gathers the
sheaves for the threshing-floor, and of him who crushes the grapes at
the winepress. And you are all kindly. You give of your bounty even to
those who come with naught but hunger and thirst.”</p>
<p>Then He turned to Judas Iscariot who kept the purse of the company,
and He said, “Give me two shekels.”</p>
<p>And Judas gave Him two shekels saying: “These are the last silver
pieces in my purse.”</p>
<p>Jesus looked at him and said, “Soon, oversoon, your purse shall be
filled with silver.”</p>
<p>Then He put the two pieces into my hand and said, “With these buy a
silken girdle for your daughter, and bid her wear it on the day of the
Passover, in remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>And looking again into the face of my daughter, He leaned down and
kissed her brow. And then He said once more, “Good-night to you
all.”</p>
<p>And He walked away.</p>
<p>I have been told that what He said to us has been recorded upon a
parchment by one of His friends, but I repeat it to you even as I heard
it from His own lips.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the sound of His voice as He said those words,
“Good night to you all.”</p>
<p>If you would know more of Him, ask my daughter. She is a woman now,
but she cherishes the memory of her girlhood. And her words are more
ready than mine.</p>
<p>BARABBAS</p>
<p>The Last Words of Jesus</p>
<p>They released me and chose Him. Then He rose and I fell down.</p>
<p>And they held Him a victim and a sacrifice for the Passover.</p>
<p>I was freed from my chains, and walked with the throng behind Him,
but I was a living man going to my own grave.</p>
<p>I should have fled to the desert where shame is burned out by the
sun.</p>
<p>Yet I walked with those who had chosen Him to bear my crime.</p>
<p>When they nailed Him on His cross I stood there.</p>
<p>I saw and I heard but I seemed outside of my body.</p>
<p>The thief who was crucified on His right said to Him, “Are you
bleeding with me, even you, Jesus of Nazareth?”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered and said, “Were it not for this nail that stays my
hand I would reach forth and clasp your hand.</p>
<p>“We are crucified together. Would they had raised your cross nearer
to mine.”</p>
<p>Then He looked down and gazed upon His mother and a young man who
stood beside her.</p>
<p>He said, “Mother, behold your son standing beside you.</p>
<p>“Woman, behold a man who shall carry these drops of my blood to the
North Country.”</p>
<p>And when he heard the wailing of the women of Galilee He said,
“Behold, they weep and I thirst.</p>
<p>“I am held too high to reach their tears.</p>
<p>“I will not take vinegar and gall to quench this thirst.”</p>
<p>Then His eyes opened wide to the sky, and He said, “Father, why hast
Thou forsaken us?”</p>
<p>And then He said in compassion, “Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do.”</p>
<p>When He uttered those words methought I saw all men prostrated before
God beseeching forgiveness for the crucifixion of this one man.</p>
<p>Then again He said with a great voice: “Father, into Thy hand I yield
back my spirit.”</p>
<p>And at last He lifted up His head and said, “Now it is finished, but
only upon this hill.”</p>
<p>And He closed His eyes.</p>
<p>Then lightning cracked the dark skies, and there was a great
thunder.</p>
<p>I know now that those who slew Him in my stead achieved my endless
torment.</p>
<p>His crucifixion endured but for an hour.</p>
<p>But I shall be crucified unto the end of my years.</p>
<p>CLAUDIUS A ROMAN SENTINEL</p>
<p>Jesus the Stoic</p>
<p>After he was taken, they entrusted Him to me. And I was ordered by
Pontius Pilatus to keep Him in custody until the following morning.</p>
<p>My soldiers led Him prisoner, and He was obedient to them.</p>
<p>At midnight I left my wife and children and visited the arsenal. It
was my habit to go about and see all that was well with my battalions in
Jerusalem; and that night I visited the arsenal where He was held.</p>
<p>My soldiers and some of the young Jews were making sport of Him. They
had stripped Him of His garment, and they had put a crown of last year’s
brier-thorns upon His head.</p>
<p>They had seated Him against a pillar, and they were dancing and
shouting before Him.</p>
<p>And they had given Him a reed to hold in His hand.</p>
<p>As I entered someone shouted, “Behold, O Captain, the King of the
Jews.”</p>
<p>I stood before Him and looked at Him, and I was ashamed. I knew not
why.</p>
<p>I had fought in Gallia and in Spain, and with my men I had faced
death. Yet never had I been in fear, nor been a coward. But when I stood
before that man and He looked at me I lost heart. It seemed as though my
lips were sealed, and I could not utter no word.</p>
<p>And straightway I left the arsenal.</p>
<p>This chanced thirty years ago. My sons who were babes then are men
now. And they are serving Caesar and Rome.</p>
<p>But often in counselling them I have spoken of Him, a man facing
death with the sap of life upon His lips, and with compassion for His
slayers in His eyes.</p>
<p>And now I am old. I have lived the years fully. And I think truly
that neither Pompey nor Caesar was so great a commander as that Man of
Galilee.</p>
<p>For since His unresisting death an army has risen out of the earth to
fight for Him. . . . And He is better served by them, though dead, than
ever Pompey or Caesar was served, though living.</p>
<p>JAMES THE BROTHER OF THE LORD</p>
<p>The Last Supper</p>
<p>A thousand times I have been visited by the memory of that night. And
I know now that I shall be visited a thousand times again.</p>
<p>The earth shall forget the furrows ploughed upon her breast, and a
woman the pain and joy of childbirth, ere I shall forget that night.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we had been outside the walls of Jerusalem, and
Jesus had said, “Let us go into the city now and take supper at the
inn.”</p>
<p>It was dark when we reached the inn, and we were hungry. The
innkeeper greeted us and led us to an upper chamber.</p>
<p>And Jesus bade us sit around the board, but He himself remained
standing, and His eyes rested upon us.</p>
<p>And He spoke to the keeper of the inn and said, “Bring me a basin and
a pitcher full of water, and a towel.”</p>
<p>And He looked at us again and said gently, “Cast off your
sandals.”</p>
<p>We did not understand, but at His command we cast them off.</p>
<p>Then the keeper of the inn brought the basin and the pitcher; and
Jesus said, “Now I will wash your feet. For I must needs free your feet
from the dust of the ancient road, and give them the freedom of the new
way.”</p>
<p>And we were all abashed and shy.</p>
<p>Then Simon Peter stood up and said: “How shall I suffer my Master and
my Lord to wash my feet?”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered, “I will wash your feet that you may remember that
he who serves men shall be the greatest among men.”</p>
<p>Then He looked at each one of us and He said: “The Son of Man who has
chosen you for His brethren, He whose feet were anointed yesterday with
myrrh of Arabia and dried with a women’s hair, desires now to wash your
feet.”</p>
<p>And He took the basin and the pitcher and kneeled down and washed our
feet, beginning with Judas Iscariot.</p>
<p>Then He sat down with us at the board; and His face was like the dawn
rising upon a battlefield after a night of strife and
blood-shedding.</p>
<p>And the keeper of the inn came with his wife, bringing food and
wine.</p>
<p>And though I had been hungry before Jesus knelt at my feet, now I had
no stomach for food. And there was a flame in my throat which I would
not quench with wine.</p>
<p>Then Jesus took a loaf of bread and gave to us, saying, “Perhaps we
shall not break bread again. Let us eat this morsel in remembrance of
our days in Galilee.”</p>
<p>And He poured wine from the jug into a cup and He drank, and gave to
us, and He said, “Drink this in remembrance of a thirst we have known
together. And drink it also in hope for the new vintage. When I am
enfolded and am no more among you, and when you meet here or elsewhere,
break the bread and pour the wine, and eat and drink even as you are
doing now. Then look about you; and perchance you may see me sitting
with you at the board.”</p>
<p>After saying this He began to distribute among us morsels of fish and
pheasant, like a bird feeding its fledglings.</p>
<p>We ate little yet we were filled; and we drank but a drop, for we
felt that the cup was like a space between this land and another
land.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said, “Ere we leave this board let us rise and sing the
joyous hymns of Galilee.”</p>
<p>And we rose and sang together, and His voice was above our voices,
and there was a ringing in every word of His words.</p>
<p>And He looked at our faces, each and every one, and He said, “Now I
bid you farewell. Let us go beyond these walls. Let us go unto
Gethsemane.”</p>
<p>And John the Son of Zebedee said, “Master, why do you say farewell to
us this night?”</p>
<p>And Jesus said, “Let not your heart be troubled. I only leave you to
prepare a place for you in my Father’s house. But if you shall be in
need of me, I will come back to you. Where you call me, there I shall
hear you, and wherever your spirit shall seek me, there I will be.</p>
<p>“Forget not that thirst leads to the winepress, and hunger to the
wedding-feast.</p>
<p>“It is in your longing that you shall find the Son of Man. For
longing is the fountain-head of ecstasy, and it is the path to the
Father.”</p>
<p>And John spoke again and said, “If you would indeed leave us, how
shall we be of good cheer? And why speak you of separation?”</p>
<p>And Jesus said, “The hunted stag knows the arrow of the hunter before
it feels it in his breast; and the river is aware of the sea ere it
comes to her shore. And the Son of Man has travelled the ways of
men.</p>
<p>Before another almond tree renders her blossoms to the sun, my roots
shall be reaching into the heart of another field.”</p>
<p>Then Simon Peter said: “Master, leave us not now, and deny us not the
joy of your presence. Where you go we too will go; and wherever you
abide there we will be also.”</p>
<p>And Jesus put His hand upon Simon Peter’s shoulder, and smiled upon
him, and He said, “Who knows but that you may deny me before this night
is over, and leave me before I leave you?”</p>
<p>Then of a sudden He said, “Now let us go hence.”</p>
<p>And He left the inn and we followed Him. But when we reached the gate
of the city, Judas of Iscariot was no longer with us. And we crossed the
Valley of Jahannam. Jesus walked far ahead of us, and we walked close to
one another.</p>
<p>When He reached an olive grove he stopped and turned towards us
saying, “Rest here for an hour.”</p>
<p>The evening was cool, though it was full spring with the mulberries
unfolding their shoots and the apple trees in bloom. And the gardens
were sweet.</p>
<p>Each one of us sought the trunk of a tree, and we lay down. I myself
gathered my cloak around me and lay under a pine tree.</p>
<p>But Jesus left us and walked by Himself in the olive grove. And I
watched Him while the others slept.</p>
<p>He would suddenly stand still, and again He would walk up and down.
This He did many times.</p>
<p>Then I saw Him lift His face towards the sky and outstretch His arms
to east and west.</p>
<p>Once He had said, “Heaven and earth, and hell too, are of man.” And
now I remembered His saying, and I knew that He who was pacing the olive
grove was heaven made man; and I bethought me that the womb of the earth
is not a beginning nor an end, but rather a chariot, a pause; and a
moment of wonder and surprise; and hell I saw also, in the valley called
Jahannam, which lay between Him and the Holy City.</p>
<p>And as He stood there and I lay wrapped in my garment, I heard His
voice speaking. But He was not speaking to us. Thrice I heard Him
pronounce the word Father . And that was all I heard.</p>
<p>After a while His arms dropped down, and He stood still like a
cypress tree between my eyes and the sky.</p>
<p>At last He came over among us again, and He said to us, “Wake and
rise. My hour has come. The world is already upon us, armed for
battle.”</p>
<p>And then He said, “A moment ago I heard the voice of my Father. If I
see you not again, remember that the conqueror shall not have peace
until he is conquered.”</p>
<p>And when we had risen and come close to Him, His face was like the
starry heaven above the desert.</p>
<p>Then He kissed each one of us upon the cheek. And when His lips
touched my cheek, they were hot, like the hand of a child in fever.</p>
<p>Suddenly we heard a great noise in the distance, as of numbers, and
when it came near it was a company of men approaching with lanterns and
slaves. And they came in haste.</p>
<p>As they reached the hedge of the grove Jesus left us and went forth
and met them. And Judas of Iscariot was leading them.</p>
<p>There were Roman soldiers with swords and spears, and men of
Jerusalem with clubs and pickaxes.</p>
<p>And Judas came up to Jesus and kissed Him. And then he said to the
armed men, “This is the Man.”</p>
<p>And Jesus said to Judas, “Judas, you were patient with me. This could
have been yesterday.”</p>
<p>Then He turned to the armed men and said: “Take me now. But see that
your cage is large enough for these wings.”</p>
<p>Then they fell upon Him and held Him, and they were all shouting.</p>
<p>But we in our fear ran away and sought to escape. I ran alone through
the olive groves, nor had I power to be mindful, nor did any voice speak
in me except my fear.</p>
<p>Through the two or three hours that remained of that night I was
fleeing and hiding, and at dawn I found myself in a village near
Jericho.</p>
<p>Why had I left Him? I do not know. But to my sorrow I did leave Him.
I was a coward and I fled from the face of His enemies.</p>
<p>Then I was sick and ashamed at heart, and I returned to Jerusalem,
but He was a prisoner, and no friend could have speech with Him.</p>
<p>He was crucified, and His blood has made new clay of the earth.</p>
<p>And I am living still; I am living upon the honeycomb of His sweet
life.</p>
<p>SIMON THE CYRENE</p>
<p>He who Carried the Cross</p>
<p>I was on my way to the fields when I saw Him carrying His cross; and
multitudes were following Him.</p>
<p>Then I too walked beside Him.</p>
<p>His burden stopped Him many a time, for His body was exhausted.</p>
<p>Then a Roman soldier approached me, saying, “Come, you are strong and
firm built; carry the cross of this man.”</p>
<p>When I heard these words my heart swelled within me and I was
grateful.</p>
<p>And I carried His cross.</p>
<p>It was heavy, for it was made of poplar soaked through with the rains
of winter.</p>
<p>And Jesus looked at me. And the sweat of His forehead was running
down upon His beard.</p>
<p>Again He looked at me and He said, “Do you too drink this cup? You
shall indeed sip its rim with me to the end of time.”</p>
<p>So saying He placed His hand upon my free shoulder. And we walked
together towards the Hill of the Skull.</p>
<p>But now I felt not the weight of the cross. I felt only His hand. And
it was like the wing of a bird upon my shoulder.</p>
<p>Then we reached the hill top, and there they were to crucify Him.</p>
<p>And then I felt the weight of the tree.</p>
<p>He uttered no word when they drove the nails into His hands and feet,
nor made He any sound.</p>
<p>And His limbs did not quiver under the hammer.</p>
<p>It seemed as if His hands and feet had died and would only live again
when bathed in blood. Yet it seemed also as if He sought the nails as
the prince would seek the sceptre; and that He craved to be raised to
the heights.</p>
<p>And my heart did not think to pity Him, for I was too filled to
wonder.</p>
<p>Now, the man whose cross I carried has become my cross.</p>
<p>Should they say to me again, “Carry the cross of this man,” I would
carry it till my road ended at the grave.</p>
<p>But I would beg Him to place His hand upon my shoulder.</p>
<p>This happened many years ago; and still whenever I follow the furrow
in the field, and in that drowsy moment before sleep, I think always of
that Beloved Man.</p>
<p>And I feel His winged hand, here, on my left shoulder.</p>
<p>CYBOREA</p>
<p>The Mother of Judas</p>
<p>My son was a good man and upright. He was tender and kind to me, and
he loved his kin and his countrymen. And he hated our enemies, the
cursed Romans, who wear purple cloth though they spin no thread nor sit
at any loom; and who reap and gather where they have not ploughed nor
sowed the seed.</p>
<p>My son was but seventeen when he was caught shooting arrows at the
Roman legion passing through our vineyard.</p>
<p>Even at that age he would speak to the other youths of the glory of
Israel, and he would utter many strange things that I did not
understand.</p>
<p>He was my son, my only son.</p>
<p>He drank life from these breasts now dry, and he took his first steps
in this garden, grasping these fingers that are now like trembling
reeds.</p>
<p>With these selfsame hands, young and fresh then like the grapes of
Lebanon, I put away his first sandals in a linen kerchief that my mother
had given me. I still keep them there in that chest, beside the
window.</p>
<p>He was my first-born, and when he took his first step, I too took my
first step. For women travel not save when led by their children.</p>
<p>And now they tell me he is dead by his own hand; that he flung
himself from the High Rock in remorse because he had betrayed his friend
Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>I know my son is dead. But I know he betrayed no one; for he loved
his kin and hated none but the Romans.</p>
<p>My son sought the glory of Israel, and naught but that glory was upon
his lips and in his deeds.</p>
<p>When he met Jesus on the highway he left me to follow Him. And in my
heart I knew that he was wrong to follow any man.</p>
<p>When he bade me farewell I told him that he was wrong, but he
listened not.</p>
<p>Our children do not heed us; like the high tide of today, they take
no counsel with the high tide of yesterday.</p>
<p>I beg you question me no further about my son.</p>
<p>I loved him and I shall love him forevermore.</p>
<p>If love were in the flesh I would burn it out with hot irons and be
at peace. But it is in the soul, unreachable.</p>
<p>And now I would speak no more. Go question another woman more
honoured than the mother of Judas.</p>
<p>Go to the mother of Jesus. The sword is in her heart also; she will
tell you of me, and you will understand.</p>
<p>THE WOMAN OF BYBLOS</p>
<p>A Lamentation</p>
<p>Weep with me, ye daughters of Ashtarte, and all ye lovers of Tamouz,
Bid your heart melt and rise and run blood-tears, For He who was made of
gold and ivory is no more.</p>
<p>In the dark forest the boar overcame Him, And the tusks of the boar
pierced His flesh. Now He lies stained with the leaves of yesteryear,
And no longer shall His footsteps wake the seeds that sleep in the bosom
of the spring. His voice will not come with the dawn to my window, And I
shall be forever alone.</p>
<p>Weep with me, ye daughters of Ashtarte, and all ye lovers of Tamouz,
For my Beloved has escaped me; He who spoke as the rivers speak; He
whose voice and time were twins; He whose mouth was a red pain made
sweet; He on whose lips gall would turn to honey.</p>
<p>Weep with me, daughters of Ashtarte, and ye lovers of Tamouz. Weep
with me around His bier as the stars weep, And as the moon-petals fall
upon His wounded body. Wet with your tears the silken covers of my bed,
Where my Beloved once lay in my dream, And was gone away in my
awakening.</p>
<p>I charge ye, daughters of Ashtarte, and all ye lovers of Tamouz, Bare
your breasts and weep and comfort me, For Jesus of Nazareth is dead.</p>
