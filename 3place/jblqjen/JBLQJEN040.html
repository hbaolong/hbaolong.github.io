<h4 id="on-the-various-appellations-of-jesus">On the Various
Appellations of Jesus</h4>
<p>You have remarked that some of us call Jesus the Christ, and some the
Word, and others call Him the Nazarene, and still others the Son of
Man.</p>
<p>I will try to make these names clear in the light that is given
me.</p>
<p>The Christ, He who was in the ancient of days, is the flame of God
that dwells in the spirit of man. He is the breath of life that visits
us, and takes unto Himself a body like our bodies.</p>
<p>He is the will of the Lord.</p>
<p>He is the first Word, which would speak with our voice and live in
our ear that we may heed and understand.</p>
<p>And the Word of the Lord our God builded a house of flesh and bones,
and was man like unto you and myself.</p>
<p>For we could not hear the song of the bodiless wind nor see our
greater self walking in the mist.</p>
<p>Many times the Christ has come to the world, and He has walked many
lands. And always He has been deemed a stranger and a madman.</p>
<p>Yet the sound of His voice descended never to emptiness, for the
memory of man keeps that which his mind takes no care to keep.</p>
<p>This is the Christ, the innermost and the height, who walks with man
towards eternity.</p>
<p>Have you not heard of Him at the cross-roads of India? And in the
land of the Magi, and upon the sands of Egypt?</p>
<p>And here in your North Country your bards of old sang of Prometheus,
the fire-bringer, he who was the desire of man fulfilled, the caged hope
made free; and Orpheus, who came with a voice and a lyre to quicken the
spirit in beast and man.</p>
<p>And know you not of Mithra the king, and of Zoroaster the prophet of
the Persians, who woke from man’s ancient sleep and stood at the bed of
our dreaming?</p>
<p>We ourselves become man anointed when we meet in the Temple
Invisible, once every thousand years. Then comes one forth embodied, and
at His coming our silence turns to singing.</p>
<p>Yet our ears turn not always to listening nor our eyes to seeing.</p>
<p>Jesus the Nazarene was born and reared like ourselves; His mother and
father were like our parents, and He was a man.</p>
<p>But the Christ, the Word, who was in the beginning, the Spirit who
would have us live our fuller life, came unto Jesus and was with
Him.</p>
<p>And the Spirit was the versed hand of the Lord, and Jesus was the
harp.</p>
<p>The Spirit was the psalm, and Jesus was the turn thereof.</p>
<p>And Jesus, the Man of Nazareth, was the host and the mouthpiece of
the Christ, who walked with us in the sun and who called us His
friends.</p>
<p>In those days the hills of Galilee and her valleys heard but His
voice. And I was a youth then, and trod in His path and pursued His
footprints.</p>
<p>I pursued His footprints and trod in His path, to hear the words of
the Christ from the lips of Jesus of Galilee.</p>
<p>Now you would know why some of us call Him the Son of Man.</p>
<p>He Himself desired to be called by that name, for He knew the hunger
and the thirst of man, and He beheld man seeking after His greater
self.</p>
<p>The Son of Man was Christ the Gracious, who would be with us all.</p>
<p>He was Jesus the Nazarene who would lead His brothers to the Anointed
One, even to the Word which was in the beginning with God.</p>
<p>In my heart dwells Jesus of Galilee, the Man above men, the Poet who
makes poets of us all, the Spirit who knocks at our door that we may
wake and rise and walk out to meet truth naked and unencumbered.</p>
<p>A YOUNG PRIEST OF CAPERNAUM</p>
<p>Of Jesus the Magician</p>
<p>He was a magician, warp and woof, and a sorcerer, a man who
bewildered the simple by charms and incantations. And He juggled with
the words of our prophets and with the sanctities of our
forefathers.</p>
<p>Aye, He even bade the dead be His witnesses, and the voiceless graves
His forerunners and authority.</p>
<p>He sought the women of Jerusalem and the women of the countryside
with the cunning of the spider that seeks the fly; and they were caught
in His web.</p>
<p>For women are weak and empty-headed, and they follow the man who
would comfort their unspent passion with soft and tender words. Were it
not for these women, infirm and possessed by His evil spirit, His name
would have been erased from the memory of man.</p>
<p>And who were the men who followed Him?</p>
<p>They were of the horde that are yoked and trodden down. In their
ignorance and fear they would never have rebelled against their rightful
masters. But when He promised them high stations in His kingdom of
mirage, they yielded to His fantasy as clay to the potter.</p>
<p>Know you not, the slave in his dreaming would always be master; and
the weakling would be a lion?</p>
<p>The Galilean was a conjuror and a deceiver, a man who forgave the
sins of all sinners that He might hear Hail and Hosanna from their
unclean mouths; and who fed the faint heart of the hopeless and the
wretched that He might have ears for His voice and a retinue at His
command.</p>
<p>He broke the Sabbath with those who break that He might gain the
support of the lawless; and He spoke ill of our high priests that He
might win attention in Sanhedrim, and by opposition increase His
fame.</p>
<p>I have said often that I hated that man. Ay, I hate Him more than I
hate the Romans who govern our country. Even His coming was from
Nazareth, a town cursed by our prophets, a dunghill of the Gentiles,
from which no good shall ever proceed.</p>
<p>A RICH LEVI IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NAZARETH</p>
<p>Jesus the Good Carpenter</p>
<p>He was a good carpenter. The doors He fashioned were never unlocked
by thieves, and the windows he made were always ready to open to the
east wind and to the west.</p>
<p>And He made chests of cedar wood, polished and enduring, and ploughs
and pitchforks strong and yielding to the hand.</p>
<p>And He carved lecterns for our synagogues. He carved them out of the
golden mulberry; and on both sides of the support, where the sacred book
lies, He chiselled wings outspreading; and under the support, heads of
bulls and doves, and large-eyed deer.</p>
<p>All this He wrought in the manner of the Chaldeans and the Greeks.
But there was that in His skill which was neither Chaldean nor
Greek.</p>
<p>Now this my house was builded by many hands thirty years ago. I
sought builders and carpenters in all the towns of Galilee. They had
each the skill and the art of building, and I was pleased and satisfied
with all that they did.</p>
<p>But come now, and behold two doors and a window that were fashioned
by Jesus of Nazareth. They in their stability mock at all else in my
house.</p>
<p>See you not that these two doors are different from all other doors?
And this window opening to the east, is it not different from other
windows?</p>
<p>All my doors and windows are yielding to the years save these which
He made. They alone stand strong against the elements.</p>
<p>And see those cross-beams, how he placed them; and these nails, how
they are driven from one side of the board, and then caught and fastened
so firmly upon the other side.</p>
<p>And what is passing strange is that that labourer who was worthy the
wages of two men received but the wage of one man; and that same
labourer now is deemed a prophet in Israel.</p>
<p>Had I known then that this youth with saw and plane was a prophet, I
would have begged Him to speak rather than work, and then I would have
overpaid Him for his words.</p>
<p>And now I still have many men working in my house and fields. How
shall I know the man whose own hand is upon his tool, from the man upon
whose hand God lays His hand?</p>
<p>Yea, how shall I know God’s hand?</p>
<p>A SHEPHERD IN SOUTH LEBANON</p>
<p>A Parable</p>
<p>It was late summer when He and three other men first walked upon that
road yonder. It was evening, and He stopped and stood there at the end
of the pasture.</p>
<p>I was playing upon my flute, and my flock was grazing all around me.
When He stopped I rose and walked over and stood before Him.</p>
<p>And He asked me, “Where is the grave of Elijah? Is it not somewhere
near this place?”</p>
<p>And I answered Him, “It is there, Sir, underneath that great heap of
stones. Even unto this day every passer-by brings a stone and places it
upon the heap.”</p>
<p>And He thanked me and walked away, and His friends walked behind
Him.</p>
<p>And after three days Ganaliel who was also a shepherd, said to me
that the man who had passed by was a prophet in Judea; but I did not
believe him. Yet I thought of that man for many a moon.</p>
<p>When spring came Jesus passed once more by this pasture, and this
time He was alone.</p>
<p>I was not playing on my flute that day for I had lost a sheep and I
was bereaved, and my heart was downcast within me.</p>
<p>And I walked towards Him and stood still before Him, for I desired to
be comforted.</p>
<p>And He looked at me and said, “You do not play upon your flute this
day. Whence is the sorrow in your eyes?” ý</p>
<p>And I answered, “A sheep from among my sheep is lost. I have sought
her everywhere but I find her not. And I know not what to do.”</p>
<p>And He was silent for a moment. Then He smiled upon me and said,
“Wait here awhile and I will find your sheep.” And He walked away and
disappeared among the hills.</p>
<p>After an hour He returned, and my sheep was close behind Him. And as
He stood before me, the sheep looked up into His face even as I was
looking. Then I embraced her inn gladness.</p>
<p>And He put His hand upon my shoulder and said, “From this day you
shall love this sheep more than any other in your flock, for she was
lost and now she is found.”</p>
<p>And again I embraced my sheep in gladness, and she came close to me,
and I was silent.</p>
<p>But when I raised my head to thank Jesus, He was already walking afar
off, and I had not the courage to follow Him.</p>
<p>JOHN THE BAPTIST</p>
<p>He Speaks in Prison to His Disciples</p>
<p>I am not silent in this foul hole while the voice of Jesus is heard
on the battlefield. I am not to be held nor confined while He is
free.</p>
<p>They tell me the vipers are coiling round His loins, but I answer:
The vipers shall awaken His strength, and He shall crush them with His
heel.</p>
<p>I am only the thunder of His lightning. Though I spoke first, His was
the word and the purpose.</p>
<p>They caught me unwarned. Perhaps they will lay hands on Him also. Yet
not before He has pronounced His word in full. And He shall overcome
them.</p>
<p>His chariot shall pass over them, and the hoofs of His horses shall
trample them, and He shall be triumphant.</p>
<p>They shall go forth with lance and sword, but He shall meet them with
the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>His blood shall run upon the earth, but they themselves shall know
the wounds and the pain thereof, and they shall be baptized in their
tears until they are cleansed of their sins.</p>
<p>Their legions shall march towards His cities with rams of iron, but
on their way they shall be drowned in the River Jordan.</p>
<p>And His walls and His towers shall rise higher, and the shields of
His warriors shall shine brighter in the sun.</p>
<p>They say I am in league with Him, and that our design is to urge the
people to rise and revolt against the kingdom of Judea.</p>
<p>I answer, and would that I had flames for words: if they deem this
pit of iniquity a kingdom, let it fall into destruction and be no more.
Let it go the way Sodom and Gomorrah, and let this race be forgotten by
God, and this land be turned to ashes.</p>
<p>Aye, behind these prison walls I am indeed an ally to Jesus of
Nazareth, and He shall lead my armies, horse and foot. And I myself,
though a captain, am not worthy to loose the strings of His sandals.</p>
<p>Go to Him and repeat my words, and then in my name beg Him for
comfort and blessing.</p>
<p>I shall not be here long. At night ’twixt waking and waking I feel
slow feet with measured steps treading above this body. And when I
hearken, I hear the rain falling upon my grave.</p>
<p>Go to Jesus, and say that John of Kedron whose soul is filled with
shadows and then emptied again, prays for Him, while the grave-digger
stands close by, and the swordman outstretches his hand for his
wages.</p>
