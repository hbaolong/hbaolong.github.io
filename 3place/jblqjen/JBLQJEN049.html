<h4 id="on-the-speech-and-gesture-of-jesus">On the Speech and Gesture of
Jesus</h4>
<p>Yes, I used to hear Him speak. There was always a ready word upon His
lips.</p>
<p>But I admired Him as a man rather than as a leader. He preached
something beyond my liking, perhaps beyond my reason. And I would have
no man preach to me.</p>
<p>I was taken by His voice and His gestures, not by the substance of
His speech. He charmed me but never convinced me; for He was too vague,
too distant and obscure to reach my mind.</p>
<p>I have known other men like Him. They are never constant nor are they
consistent. It is with eloquence not with principles that they hold your
ear and your passing thought, but never the core of your heart.</p>
<p>What a pity that His enemies confronted Him and forced the issue. It
was not necessary. I believe their hostility will add to His stature and
turn His mildness to power.</p>
<p>For is it not strange that in opposing a man you give Him courage?
And in staying His feet you give Him wings?</p>
<p>I know not His enemies, yet I am certain that in their fear of a
harmless man they have lent Him strength and made Him dangerous.</p>
<p>JEPHTHA OF CAESAREA</p>
<p>A Man Weary of Jesus</p>
<p>This man who fills your day and haunts your night is repellent to me.
Yet you would tire my eyes with His sayings and my mind with His
deeds.</p>
<p>I am weary of His words, and all that He did. His very name offends
me, and the name of His countryside. I will none of Him.</p>
<p>Why make you a prophet of a man who was but a shadow? Why see a tower
in this sand-dune, or imagine a lake in the raindrops gathered together
in this hoof-print?</p>
<p>I scorn not the echo of caves in valleys nor the long shadows of the
sunset; but I would not listen to the deceptions that hum in your head,
nor study the reflections in your eyes.</p>
<p>What word did Jesus utter that Halliel had not spoken? What wisdom
did He reveal that was not of Gamaliel? What are His lispings to the
voice of Philo? What cymbals did He beat that were not beaten ere ever
He lived?</p>
<p>I hearken to the echo from the caves into the silent valleys, and I
gaze upon the long shadows of sunset; but I would not have this man’s
heart echo the sound of another heart, nor would I have a shadow of the
seers call himself a prophet.</p>
<p>What man shall speak since Isaiah has spoken? Who dares sing since
David? And shall wisdom be born now, after Solomon has been gathered to
his fathers?</p>
<p>And what of our prophets, whose tongues were swords and their lips
flames?</p>
<p>Left they a straw behind for this gleaner of Galilee? Or a fallen
fruit for the beggar from the North Country? There was naught for Him
save to break the loaf already baked by our ancestors, and to pour the
wine which their holy feet had already passed from the grapes of
old.</p>
<p>It is the potter’s hand I honour not the man who buys the ware.</p>
<p>I honour those who sit at the loom rather than the boor who wears the
cloth.</p>
<p>Who was this Jesus of Nazareth, and what is He? A man who dared not
live His mind. Therefore He faded into oblivion and that is His end.</p>
<p>I beg you, charge not my ears with His words or His deeds. My heart
is overfull with the prophets of old, and that is enough.</p>
<p>JOHN THE BELOVED DISCIPLE</p>
<p>On Jesus the Word</p>
<p>You would have me speak of Jesus, but how can I lure the passion-song
of the world into a hollowed reed?</p>
<p>In every aspect of the day Jesus was aware of the Father. He beheld
Him in the clouds and in the shadows of the clouds that pass over the
earth. He saw the Father’s face reflected in the quiet pools, and the
faint print of His feet upon the sand; and He often closed His eyes to
gaze into the Holy Eyes.</p>
<p>The night spoke to Him with the voice of the Father, and in solitude
He heard the angel of the Lord calling to Him. And when He stilled
Himself to sleep He heard the whispering of the heavens in His
dreams.</p>
<p>He was often happy with us, and He would call us brothers.</p>
<p>Behold, He who was the first Word called us brothers, though we were
but syllables uttered yesterday.</p>
<p>You ask why I call Him the first Word.</p>
<p>Listen, and I will answer:</p>
<p>In the beginning God moved in space, and out of His measureless
stirring the earth was born and the seasons thereof.</p>
<p>Then God moved again, and life streamed forth, and the longing of
life sought the height and the depth and would have more of itself.</p>
<p>Then God spoke thus, and His words were man, and man was a spirit
begotten by God’s Spirit.</p>
<p>And when God spoke thus, the Christ was His first Word and that Word
was perfect; and when Jesus of Nazareth came to the world the first Word
was uttered unto us and the sound was made flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Jesus the Anointed was the first Word of God uttered unto man, even
as if an apple tree in an orchard should bud and blossom a day before
the other trees. And in God’s orchard that day was an aeon.</p>
<p>We are all sons and daughters of the Most High, but the Anointed One
was His first-born, who dwelt in the body of Jesus of Nazareth, and He
walked among us and we beheld Him.</p>
<p>All this I say that you may understand not only in the mind but
rather in the spirit. The mind weighs and measures but it is the spirit
that reaches the heart of life and embraces the secret; and the seed of
the spirit is deathless.</p>
<p>The wind may blow and then cease, and the sea shall swell and then
weary, but the heart of life is a sphere quiet and serene, and the star
that shines therein is fixed for evermore.</p>
