id="on-the-fourth-day-of-the-following-week-i-was-taken-to-the-house-of-my-bridegroom-and-given-in-marriage.">On
the fourth day of the following week I was taken to the house of my
bridegroom and given in marriage.</h4>
<p>And Jesus came, and with Him His mother and His brother James.</p>
<p>And they sat around the wedding-board with our guests whilst my
maiden comrades sang the wedding-songs of Solomon the King. And Jesus
ate our food and drank our wine and smiled upon me and upon the
others.</p>
<p>And He heeded all the songs of the lover bringing his beloved into
his tent; and of the young vineyard-keeper who loved the daughter of the
lord of the vineyard and led her to his mother’s house; and of the
prince who met the beggar maiden and bore her to his realm and crowned
her with the crown of his fathers.</p>
<p>And it seemed as if He were listening to yet other songs also, which
I could not hear.</p>
<p>At sundown the father of my bridegroom came to the mother of Jesus
and whispered saying, “We have no more wine for our guests. And the day
is not yet over.”</p>
<p>And Jesus heard the whispering, and He said, “The cup bearer knows
that there is still more wine.”</p>
<p>And so it was indeed – and as long as the guests remained there was
fine wine for all who would drink.</p>
<p>Presently Jesus began to speak with us. He spoke of the wonders of
earth and heaven; of sky flowers that bloom when night is upon the
earth, and of earth flowers that blossom when the day hides the
stars.</p>
<p>And He told us stories and parables, and His voice enchanted us so
that we gazed upon Him as if seeing visions, and we forgot the cup and
the plate.</p>
<p>And as I listened to Him it seemed as if I were in a land distant and
unknown.</p>
<p>After a while one of the guests said to the father of my bridegroom,
“You have kept the best wine till the end of the feast. Other hosts do
not so.”</p>
<p>And all believed that Jesus had wrought a miracle, that they should
have more wine and better at the end of the wedding-feast than at the
beginning.</p>
<p>I too thought that Jesus had poured the wine, but I was not
astonished; for in His voice I had already listened to miracles.</p>
<p>And afterwards indeed, His voice remained close to my heart, even
until I had been delivered of my first-born child.</p>
<p>And now even to this day in our village and in the villages near by,
the word of our guest is still remembered. And they say, “The spirit of
Jesus of Nazareth is the best and the oldest wine.”</p>
<p>A PERSIAN PHILOSOPHER IN DAMASCUS</p>
<p>Of Ancient Gods and New</p>
<p>I cannot tell the fate of this man, nor can I say what shall befall
His disciples.</p>
<p>A seed hidden in the heart of an apple is an orchard invisible. Yet
should that seed fall upon a rock, it will come to naught.</p>
<p>But this I say: The ancient God of Israel is harsh and relentless.
Israel should have another God; one who is gentle and forgiving, who
would look down upon them with pity; one who would descend with the rays
of the sun and walk on the path of their limitations, rather than sit
for ever in the judgment seat to weigh their faults and measure their
wrong-doings.</p>
<p>Israel should bring forth a God whose heart is not a jealous heart,
and whose memory of their shortcomings is brief; one who would not
avenge Himself upon them even to the third and the fourth
generation.</p>
<p>Man here in Syria is like man in all lands. He would look into the
mirror of his own understanding and therein find his deity. He would
fashion the gods after his own likeness, and worship that which reflects
his own image.</p>
<p>In truth man prays to his deeper longing, that it may rise and fulfil
the sum of his desires.</p>
<p>There is no depth beyond the soul of man, and the soul is the deep
that calls unto itself; for there is no other voice to speak and there
are no other ears to hear.</p>
<p>Even we in Persia would see our faces in the disc of the sun and our
bodies dancing in the fire that we kindle upon the altars.</p>
<p>Now the God of Jesus, whom He called Father, would not be a stranger
unto the people of Jesus, and He would fulfil their desires.</p>
<p>The gods of Egypt have cast off their burden of stones and fled to
the Nubian desert, to be free among those who are still free from
knowing.</p>
<p>The gods of Greece and Rome are vanishing into their own sunset. They
were too much like men to live in the ecstasy of men. The groves in
which their magic was born have been cut down by the axes of the
Athenians and the Alexandrians.</p>
<p>And in this land also the high places are made low by the lawyers of
Beirut and the young hermits of Antioch.</p>
<p>Only the old women and the weary men seek the temples of their
forefathers; only the exhausted at the end of the road seek its
beginning.</p>
<p>But this man Jesus, this Nazarene, He has spoken of a God too vast to
be unlike the soul of any man, too knowing to punish, too loving to
remember the sins of His creatures. And this God of the Nazarene shall
pass over the threshold of the children of the earth, and He shall sit
at their hearth, and He shall be a blessing within their walls and a
light upon their path.</p>
<p>But my God is the God of Zoroaster, the God who is the sun in the sky
and fire upon the earth and light in the bosom of man. And I am content.
I need no other God.</p>
<p>DAVID ONE OF HIS FOLLOWERS</p>
<p>Jesus the Practical</p>
<p>I did not know the meaning of His discourses or His parables until He
was no longer among us. Nay, I did not understand until His words took
living forms before my eyes and fashioned themselves into bodies that
walk in the procession of my own day.</p>
<p>Let me tell you this: On a night as I sat in my house pondering, and
remembering His words and His deeds that I might inscribe them in a
book, three thieves entered my house. And though I knew they came to rob
me of my goods, I was too mindful of what I was doing to meet them with
the sword, or even to say, “What do you here?”</p>
<p>But I continued writing my remembrances of the Master.</p>
<p>And when the thieves had gone then I remembered His saying, “He who
would take your cloak, let him take your other cloak also.”</p>
<p>And I understood.</p>
<p>As I sat recording His words no man could have stopped me even were
he to have carried away all my possessions.</p>
<p>For though I would guard my possessions and also my person, I know
there lies the greater treasure.</p>
<p>LUKE</p>
<p>On Hypocrites</p>
<p>Jesus despised and scorned the hypocrites, and His wrath was like a
tempest that scourged them. His voice was thunder in their ears and He
cowed them.</p>
<p>In their fear of Him they sought His death; and like moles in the
dark earth they worked to undermine His footsteps. But He fell not into
their snares.</p>
<p>He laughed at them, for well He knew that the spirit shall not be
mocked, nor shall it be taken in the pitfall.</p>
<p>He held a mirror in His hand and therein He saw the sluggard and the
limping and those who stagger and fall by the roadside on the way to the
summit.</p>
<p>And He pitied them all. He would even have raised them to His stature
and He would have carried their burden. Nay, He would have bid their
weakness lean on His strength.</p>
<p>He did not utterly condemn the liar or the thief or the murderer, but
He did utterly condemn the hypocrite whose face is masked and whose hand
is gloved.</p>
<p>Often I have pondered on the heart that shelters all who come from
the wasteland to its sanctuary, yet against the hypocrite is closed and
sealed.</p>
<p>On a day as we rested with Him in the Garden of Pomegranates, I said
to Him, “Master, you forgive and console the sinner and all the weak and
the infirm save only the hypocrite alone.”</p>
<p>And He said, “You have chosen your words well when you called the
sinners weak and infirm. I do forgive them their weakness of body and
their infirmity of spirit. For their failings have been laid upon them
by their forefathers, or by the greed of their neighbours.</p>
<p>“But I tolerate not the hypocrite, because he himself lays a yoke
upon the guileless and the yielding.</p>
<p>“Weaklings, whom you call sinners, are like the featherless young
that fall from the nest. The hypocrite is the vulture waiting upon a
rock for the death of the prey.</p>
<p>“Weaklings are men lost in a desert. But the hypocrite is not lost.
He knows the way yet he laughs between the sand and the wind.</p>
<p>“For this cause I do not receive him.”</p>
<p>Thus our Master spoke, and I did not understand. But I understand
now.</p>
<p>Then the hypocrites of the land laid hands upon Him and they judged
Him; and in so doing they deemed themselves justified. For they cited
the law of Moses in the Sanhedrim in witness and evidence against
Him.</p>
<p>And they who break the law at the rise of every dawn and break it
again at sunset, brought about His death.</p>
<p>MATTHEW</p>
<p>The Sermon on the Mount</p>
<p>One harvest day Jesus called us and His other friends to the hills.
The earth was fragrant, and like the daughter of a king at her
wedding-feast, she wore all her jewels. And the sky was her
bridegroom.</p>
<p>When we reached the heights Jesus stood still in the grove of the
laurels, and He said, “Rest here, quiet your mind and tune your heart,
for I have much to tell you.”</p>
<p>Then we reclined on the grass, and the summer flowers were all about
us, and Jesus sat in our midst.</p>
<p>And Jesus said:</p>
<p>“Blessed are the serene in spirit.</p>
<p>“Blessed are they who are not held by possessions, for they shall be
free.</p>
<p>“Blessed are they who remember their pain, and in their pain await
their joy.</p>
<p>“Blessed are they who hunger after truth and beauty, for their hunger
shall bring bread, and their thirst cool water.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the kindly, for they shall be consoled by their own
kindliness.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall be one with God.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the merciful, for mercy shall be in their portion.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the peacemakers, for their spirit shall dwell above the
battle, and they shall turn the potter’s field into a garden.</p>
<p>“Blessed are they who are hunted, for they shall be swift of foot and
they shall be winged.</p>
<p>“Rejoice and be joyful, for you have found the kingdom of heaven
within you. The singers of old were persecuted when they sang of that
kingdom. You too shall be persecuted, and therein lies your honour,
therein your reward.</p>
<p>“You are the salt of the earth; should the salt lose its savour
wherewith shall the food of man’s heart be salted?</p>
<p>“You are the light of the world. Put not that light under a bushel.
Let it shine rather from the summit, to those who seek the City of
God.</p>
<p>“Think not I came to destroy the laws of the scribes and the
Pharisees; for my days among you are numbered and my words are counted,
and I have but hours in which to fulfil another law and reveal a new
covenant.</p>
<p>“You have been told that you shall not kill, but I say unto you, you
shall not be angry without a cause.</p>
<p>“You have been charged by the ancients to bring your calf and your
lamb and your dove to the temple, and to slay them upon the altar, that
the nostrils of God may feed upon the odour of their fat, and that you
may be forgiven your failings.</p>
<p>“But I say unto you, would you give God that which was His own from
the beginning; and would you appease Him whose throne is above the
silent deep and whose arms encircle space?</p>
<p>“Rather, seek out your brother and be reconciled unto him ere you
seek the temple; and be a loving giver unto your neighbour. For in the
soul of these God has builded a temple that shall not be destroyed, and
in their heart He has raised an altar that shall never perish.</p>
<p>“You have been told, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I
say unto you: Resist not evil, for resistance is food unto evil and
makes it strong. And only the weak would revenge themselves. The strong
of soul forgive, and it is honour in the injured to forgive.</p>
<p>“Only the fruitful tree is shaken or stoned for food.</p>
<p>“Be not heedful of the morrow, but rather gaze upon today, for
sufficient for today is the miracle thereof.</p>
<p>“Be not over-mindful of yourself when you give but be mindful of the
necessity. For every giver himself receives from the Father, and that
much more abundantly.</p>
<p>“And give to each according to his need; for the Father gives not
salt to the thirsty, nor a stone to the hungry, nor milk to the
weaned.</p>
<p>“And give not that which is holy to dogs; nor cast your pearls before
swine. For with such gifts you mock them; and they also shall mock your
gift, and in their hate would fain destroy you.</p>
<p>“Lay not up for yourselves treasures that corrupt or that thieves may
steal away. Lay up rather treasure which shall not corrupt or be stolen,
and whose loveliness increases when many eyes behold it. For where your
treasure is, your heart is also.</p>
<p>“You have been told that the murderer shall be put to the sword, that
the thief shall be crucified, and the harlot stoned. But I say unto you
that you are not free from wrongdoing of the murderer and the thief and
the harlot, and when they are punished in the body your own spirit is
darkened.</p>
<p>“Verily no crime is committed by one man or one woman. All crimes are
committed by all. And he who pays the penalty may be breaking a link in
the chain that hangs upon your own ankles. Perhaps he is paying with his
sorrow the price for your passing joy.”</p>
<p>Thus spake Jesus, and it was in my desire to kneel down and worship
Him, yet in my shyness I could not move nor speak a word.</p>
<p>But at last I spoke; and I said, “I would pray this moment, yet my
tongue is heavy. Teach me to pray.”</p>
<p>And Jesus said, “When you would pray, let your longing pronounce the
words. It is in my longing now to pray thus:</p>
<p>“Our Father in earth and heaven, sacred is Thy name.</p>
<p>Thy will be done with us, even as in space.</p>
<p>Give us of Thy bread sufficient for the day.</p>
<p>In Thy compassion forgive us and enlarge us to forgive one
another.</p>
<p>Guide us towards Thee and stretch down Thy hand to us in
darkness.</p>
<p>For Thine is the kingdom, and in Thee is our power and our
fulfilment.”</p>
<p>And it was now evening, and Jesus walked down from the hills, and all
of us followed Him. And as I followed I was repeating His prayer, and
remembering all that He had said; for I knew that the words that had
fallen like flakes that day must set and grow firm like crystals, and
that wings that had fluttered above our heads were to beat the earth
like iron hoofs.</p>
