<h4 id="on-the-kingdoms-of-the-world">On the Kingdoms of the World</h4>
<p>Upon a day in the spring of the year Jesus stood in the market-place
of Jerusalem and He spoke to the multitudes of the kingdom of
heaven.</p>
<p>And He accused the scribes and the Pharisees of setting snares and
digging pitfalls in the path of those who long after the kingdom; and He
denounced them.</p>
<p>Now amongst the crowd was a company of men who defended the Pharisees
and the scribes, and they sought to lay hands upon Jesus and upon us
also.</p>
<p>But He avoided them and turned aside from them, and walked towards
the north gate of the city.</p>
<p>And He said to us, “My hour has not yet come. Many are the things I
have still to say unto you, and many are the deeds I shall yet perform
ere I deliver myself up to the world.”</p>
<p>Then He said, and there was joy and laughter in His voice, “Let us go
into the North Country and meet the spring. Come with me to the hills,
for winter is past and the snows of Lebanon are descending to the
valleys to sing with the brooks.</p>
<p>“The fields and the vineyards have banished sleep and are awake to
greet the sun with their green figs and tender grapes.”</p>
<p>And He walked before us and we followed Him, that day and the
next.</p>
<p>And upon the afternoon of the third day we reached the summit of
Mount Hermon, and there He stood looking down upon the cities of the
plains.</p>
<p>And His face shone like molten gold, and He outstretched His arms and
He said to us, “Behold the earth in her green raiment, and see how the
streams have hemmed the edges of her garments with silver.</p>
<p>“In truth the earth is fair and all that is upon her is fair.</p>
<p>“But there is a kingdom beyond all that you behold, and therein I
shall rule. And if it is your choice, and if it is indeed your desire,
you too shall come and rule with me.</p>
<p>“My face and your faces shall not be masked; our hand shall hold
neither sword nor sceptre, and our subjects shall love us in peace and
shall not be in fear of us.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Jesus, and unto all the kingdoms of the earth I was
blinded, and unto all the cities of walls and towers; and it was in my
heart to follow the Master to His kingdom.</p>
<p>Then just at that moment Judas of Iscariot stepped forth. And he
walked up to Jesus, and spoke and said, “Behold, the kingdoms of the
world are vast, and behold the cities of David and Solomon shall prevail
against the Romans. If you will be the king of the Jews we shall stand
beside you with sword and shield and we shall overcome the alien.”</p>
<p>But when Jesus heard this He turned upon Judas, and His face was
filled with wrath. And He spoke in a voice terrible as the thunder of
the sky and He said, “Get you behind me, Satan. Think you that I came
down the years to rule an ant-hill for a day?</p>
<p>“My throne is a throne beyond your vision. Shall he whose wings
encircle the earth seek shelter in a nest abandoned and forgotten?</p>
<p>“Shall the living be honoured and exalted by the wearer of
shrouds?”</p>
<p>“My kingdom is not of this earth, and my seat is not builded upon the
skulls of your ancestors.</p>
<p>“If you seek aught save the kingdom of the spirit then it were better
for you to leave me here, and go down to the caves of your dead, where
the crowned heads of yore hold court in their tombs and may still be
bestowing honours upon the bones of your forefathers.</p>
<p>“Dare you tempt me with a crown of dross, when my forehead seeks the
Pleiades, or else your thorns?</p>
<p>“Were it not for a dream dreamed by a forgotten race I would not
suffer your sun to rise upon my patience, nor your moon to throw my
shadow across your path.</p>
<p>“Were it not for a mother’s desire I would have stripped me of the
swaddling-clothes and escaped back to space.</p>
<p>“And were it not for sorrow in all of you I would not have stayed to
weep.</p>
<p>“Who are you and what are you, Judas Iscariot? And why do you tempt
me?</p>
<p>“Have you in truth weighed me in the scale and found me one to lead
legions of pygmies, and to direct chariots of the shapeless against an
enemy that encamps only in your hatred and marches nowhere but in your
fear?</p>
<p>“Too many are the worms that crawl about me feet, and I will give
them no battle. I am weary of the jest, and weary of pitying the
creepers who deem me coward because I will not move among their guarded
walls and towers.</p>
<p>“Pity it is that I must needs pity to the very end. Would that I
could turn my steps towards a larger world where larger men dwell. But
how shall I?</p>
<p>“Your priest and your emperor would have my blood. They shall be
satisfied ere I go hence. I would not change the course of the law. And
I would not govern folly.</p>
<p>“Let ignorance reproduce itself until it is weary of its own
offspring.</p>
<p>“Let the blind lead the blind to the pitfall.</p>
<p>“And let the dead bury the dead till the earth be choked with its own
bitter fruit.</p>
<p>“My kingdom is not of the earth. My kingdom shall be where two or
three of you shall meet in love, and in wonder at the loveliness of
life, and in good cheer, and in remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Then of a sudden He turned to Judas, and He said, “Get you behind me,
man. Your kingdoms shall never be in my kingdom.”</p>
<p>And now it was twilight, and He turned to us and said, “Let us go
down. The night is upon us. Let us walk in light while the light is with
us.”</p>
<p>Then He went down from the hills and we followed Him. And Judas
followed afar off.</p>
<p>And when we reached the lowland it was night.</p>
<p>And Thomas, the son of Diophanes, said unto Him, “Master, it is dark
now, and we can no longer see the way. If it is in your will, lead us to
the lights of yonder village where we may find meat and shelter.”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered Thomas, and He said, “I have led you to the
heights when you were hungry, and I have brought you down to the plains
with a greater hunger. But I cannot stay with you this night. I would be
alone.”</p>
<p>Then Simon Peter stepped forth, and said:</p>
<p>Master, suffer us not to go alone in the dark. Grant that we may stay
with you even here on this byway. The night and the shadows of the night
will not linger, and the morning shall soon find us if you will but stay
with us.”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered, “This night the foxes shall have their holes, and
the birds of the air their nests, but the Son of Man has not where on
earth to lay His head. And indeed I would now be alone. Should you
desire me you will find me again by the lake where I found you.”</p>
<p>Then we walked away from Him with heavy hearts, for it was not in our
will to leave Him.</p>
<p>Many times did we stop and turn our faces towards Him, and we saw him
in lonely majesty, moving westward.</p>
<p>The only man among us who did not turn to behold Him in His aloneness
was Judas Iscariot.</p>
<p>And from that day Judas became sullen and distant. And methought
there was danger in the sockets of his eyes.</p>
