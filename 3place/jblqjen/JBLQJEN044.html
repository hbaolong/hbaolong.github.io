<h4 id="on-the-forefathers-of-his-doubts">On the Forefathers of His
Doubts</h4>
<p>My grandfather who was a lawyer once said, “Let us observe truth, but
only when truth is made manifest unto us.”</p>
<p>When Jesus called me I heeded Him, for His command was more potent
than my will; yet I kept my counsel.</p>
<p>When He spoke and the others were swayed like branches in the wind, I
listened immovable. Yet I loved Him.</p>
<p>Three years ago He left us, a scattered company to sing His name, and
to be His witnesses unto the nations.</p>
<p>At that time I was called Thomas the Doubter. The shadow of my
grandfather was still upon me, and always I would have truth made
manifest.</p>
<p>I would even put my hand in my own wound to feel the blood ere I
would believe in my pain.</p>
<p>Now a man who loves with his heart yet holds a doubt in his mind, is
but a slave in a galley who sleeps at his oar and dreams of his freedom,
till the lash of the master wakes him.</p>
<p>I myself was that slave, and I dreamed of freedom, but the sleep of
my grandfather was upon me. My flesh needed the whip of my own day.</p>
<p>Even in the presence of the Nazarene I had closed my eyes to see my
hands chained to the oar.</p>
<p>Doubt is a pain too lonely to know that faith is his twin
brother.</p>
<p>Doubt is a foundling unhappy and astray, and though his own mother
who gave him birth should find him and enfold him, he would withdraw in
caution and in fear.</p>
<p>For Doubt will not know truth till his wounds are healed and
restored.</p>
<p>I doubted Jesus until He made Himself manifest to me, and thrust my
own hand into His very wounds.</p>
<p>Then indeed I believed, and after that I was rid of my yesterday and
the yesterdays of my forefathers.</p>
<p>The dead in me buried their dead; and the living shall live for the
Anointed King, even for Him who was the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Yesterday they told me that I must go and utter His name among the
Persians and the Hindus.</p>
<p>I shall go. And from this day to my last day, at dawn and at
eventide, I shall see my Lord rising in majesty and I shall hear Him
speak.</p>
<p>ELMADAM THE LOGICIAN</p>
<p>Jesus the Outcast</p>
<p>You bid me speak of Jesus the Nazarene, and much have I to tell, but
the time has not come. Yet whatever I say of Him now is the truth; for
all speech is worthless save when it discloses the truth.</p>
<p>Behold a man disorderly, against all order; a mendicant, opposed to
all possessions; a drunkard who would only make merry with rogues and
castaways.</p>
<p>He was not the proud son of the State, nor was He the protected
citizen of the Empire; therefore He had contempt for both State and
Empire.</p>
<p>He would live as free and dutiless as the fowls of the air, and for
this the hunters brought Him to earth with arrows.</p>
<p>No one shall open the flood gates of his ancestors without drowning.
It is the law. And because the Nazarene broke the law, He and His
witless followers were brought to naught.</p>
<p>And there lived many others like Him, men who would change the course
of our destiny.</p>
<p>They themselves were changed, and they were the losers.</p>
<p>There is a grapeless vine that grows by the city walls. It creeps
upward and clings to the stones. Should that vine say in her heart,
“With my might and my weight I shall destroy these walls,” what would
other plants say? Surely they would laugh at her foolishness.</p>
<p>Now sir, I cannot but laugh at this man and His ill-advised
disciples.</p>
<p>ONE OF THE MARYS</p>
<p>On His Sadness and His Smile</p>
<p>His head was always high, and the flame of God was in His eyes.</p>
<p>He was often sad, but His sadness was tenderness shown to those in
pain, and comradeship given to the lonely.</p>
<p>When He smiled His smile was as the hunger of those who long after
the unknown. It was like the dust of stars falling upon the eyelids of
children. And it was like a morsel of bread in the throat.</p>
<p>He was sad, yet it was a sadness that would rise to the lips and
become a smile.</p>
<p>It was like a golden veil in the forest when autumn is upon the
world. And sometimes it seemed like moonlight upon the shores of the
lake.</p>
<p>He smiled as if His lips would sing at the wedding-feast.</p>
<p>Yet He was sad with the sadness of the winged who will not soar above
his comrade.</p>
<p>RUMANOUS A GREEK POET</p>
<p>Jesus the Poet</p>
<p>He was a poet. He saw for our eyes and heard for our ears, and our
silent words were upon His lips; and His fingers touched what we could
not feel.</p>
<p>Out of His heart there flew countless singing birds to the north and
to the south, and the little flowers on the hill-sides stayed His steps
towards the heavens.</p>
<p>Oftentimes I have seen Him bending down to touch the blades of grass.
And in my heart I have heard Him say: “Little green things, you shall be
with me in my kingdom, even as the oaks of Besan, and the cedars of
Lebanon.”</p>
<p>He loved all things of loveliness, the shy faces of children, and the
myrrh and frankincense from the south.</p>
<p>He loved a pomegranate or a cup of wine given Him in kindness; it
mattered not whether it was offered by a stranger in the inn or by a
rich host.</p>
<p>And He loved the almond blossoms. I have seen Him gathering them into
His hands and covering His face with the petals, as though He would
embrace with His love all the trees in the world.</p>
<p>He knew the sea and the heavens; and He spoke of pearls which have
light that is not of this light, and of stars that are beyond our
night.</p>
<p>He knew the mountains as eagles know them, and the valleys as they
are known by the brooks and the streams. And there was a desert in His
silence and a garden in His speech.</p>
<p>Aye, He was a poet whose heart dwelt in a bower beyond the heights,
and His songs though sung for our ears, were sung for other ears also,
and to men in another land where life is for ever young and time is
always dawn.</p>
<p>Once I too deemed myself a poet, but when I stood before Him in
Bethany, I knew what it is to hold an instrument with but a single
string before one who commands all instruments. For in His voice there
was the laughter of thunder and the tears of rain, and the joyous
dancing of trees in the wind.</p>
<p>And since I have known that my lyre has but one string, and that my
voice weaves neither the memories of yesterday nor the hopes of
tomorrow, I have put aside my lyre and I shall keep silence. But always
at twilight I shall hearken, and I shall listen to the Poet who is the
sovereign of all poets.</p>
<p>LEVI A DISCIPLE</p>
<p>On Those who would Confound Jesus</p>
<p>Upon an eventide He passed by my house, and my soul was quickened
within me.</p>
<p>He spoke to me and said, “Come, Levi, and follow me.”</p>
<p>And I followed Him that day.</p>
<p>And at eventide of the next day I begged Him to enter my house and be
my guest. And He and His friends crossed my threshold and blessed me and
my wife and my children.</p>
<p>And I had other guests. They were publicans and men of learning, but
they were against Him in their hearts.</p>
<p>And when we were sitting about the board, one of the publicans
questioned Jesus, saying, “Is it true that you and your disciples break
the law, and make fire on the Sabbath day?”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered him saying, “We do indeed make fire on the Sabbath
day. We would inflame the Sabbath day, and we would burn with our touch
the dry stubble of all days.”</p>
<p>And another publican said, “It was brought to us that you drink wine
with the unclean at the inn.”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered, “Aye, these also we would comfort. Came we here
except to share the loaf and the cup with the uncrowned and the unshod
amongst you?</p>
<p>“Few, aye too few are the featherless who dare the wind, and many are
the winged and full-fledged yet in the nest.</p>
<p>“And we would feed them all with our beak, both the sluggish and the
swift.”</p>
<p>And another publican said, “Have I not been told that you would
protect the harlots of Jerusalem?”</p>
<p>Then in the face of Jesus I saw, as it were, the rocky heights of
Lebanon, and He said, “It is true.</p>
<p>“On the day of reckoning these women shall rise before the throne of
my Father, and they shall be made pure by their own tears. But you shall
be held down by the chains of your own judgment.</p>
<p>“Babylon was not put to waste by her prostitutes; Babylon fell to
ashes that the eyes of her hypocrites might no longer see the light of
day.”</p>
<p>And other publicans would have questioned Him, but I made a sign and
bade them be silent, for I knew He would confound them; and they too
were my guests, and I would not have them put to shame.</p>
<p>When it was midnight the publicans left my house, and their souls
were limping.</p>
<p>Then I closed my eyes and I saw, as if in a vision, seven women in
white raiment standing about Jesus. Their arms were crossed upon their
bosoms, and their heads were bent down, and I looked deep into the mist
of my dream and beheld the face of one of the seven women, and it shone
in my darkness.</p>
<p>It was the face of a harlot who lived in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Then I opened my eyes and looked at Him, and He was smiling at me and
at the others who had not left the board.</p>
<p>And I closed my eyes again, and I saw in a light seven men in white
garments standing around Him. And I beheld the face of one of them.</p>
<p>It was the face of the thief who was crucified afterward at His right
hand.</p>
<p>And later Jesus and His comrades left my house for the road.</p>
<p>A WIDOW IN GALILEE</p>
<p>Jesus the Cruel</p>
<p>My son was my first and my only born. He laboured in our field and he
was contented until he heard the man called Jesus speaking to the
multitude.</p>
<p>Then my son suddenly became different, as if a new spirit, foreign
and unwholesome, had embraced his spirit.</p>
<p>He abandoned the field and the garden; and he abandoned me also. He
became worthless, a creature of the highways.</p>
<p>That man Jesus of Nazareth was evil, for what good man would separate
a son from his mother?</p>
<p>The last thing my child said to me was this: “I am going with one of
His disciples to the North Country. My life is established upon the
Nazarene. You have given me birth, and for that I am grateful to you.
But I needs must go. Am I not leaving with you our rich land, and all
our silver and gold? I shall take naught but this garment and this
staff.”</p>
<p>Thus my son spoke, and departed.</p>
<p>And now the Romans and the priests have laid hold upon Jesus and
crucified Him; and they have done well.</p>
<p>A man who would part mother and son could not be godly.</p>
<p>The man who sends our children to the cities of the Gentiles cannot
be our friend.</p>
<p>I know my son will not return to me. I saw it in his eyes. And for
this I hate Jesus of Nazareth who caused me to be alone in this
unploughed field and this withered garden.</p>
<p>And I hate all those who praise Him.</p>
<p>Not many days ago they told me that Jesus once said, “My father and
my mother and my brethren are those who hear my word and follow me.”</p>
<p>But why should sons leave their mothers to follow His footsteps?</p>
<p>And why should the milk of my breast be forgotten for a fountain not
yet tasted? And the warmth of my arms be forsaken for the Northland,
cold and unfriendly?</p>
<p>Aye, I hate the Nazarene, and I shall hate Him to the end of my days,
for He has robbed me of my first-born, my only son.</p>
