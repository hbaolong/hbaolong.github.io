<h4 id="on-the-neighbour">On the Neighbour</h4>
<p>Once in Capernaum my Lord and Master spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Your neighbour is your other self dwelling behind a wall. In
understanding, all walls shall fall down.</p>
<p>“Who knows but that your neighbour is your better self wearing
another body? See that you love him as you would love yourself.</p>
<p>“He too is a manifestation of the Most High, whom you do not
know.</p>
<p>“Your neighbour is a field where the springs of your hope walk in
their green garments, and where the winters of your desire dream of
snowy heights.</p>
<p>“Your neighbour is a mirror wherein you shall behold your countenance
made beautiful by a joy which you yourself if not know, and by a sorrow
you yourself did not share.</p>
<p>“I would have you love your neighbour even as I have loved you.”</p>
<p>Then I asked Him saying, “How can I love a neighbour who loves me
not, and who covets my property? One who would steal my
possessions?”</p>
<p>And He answered, “When you are ploughing and your manservant is
sowing the seed behind you, would you stop and look backward and put to
flight a sparrow feeding upon a few of your seeds? Should you do this,
you were not worthy of the riches of your harvest.”</p>
<p>When Jesus had said this, I was ashamed and I was silent. But I was
not in fear, for He smiled upon me.</p>
<p>A COBBLER IN JERUSALEM</p>
<p>A Neutral</p>
<p>I loved him not, yet I did not hate Him. I listened to Him not to
hear His words but rather he sound of His voice; for His voice pleased
me.</p>
<p>All that He said was vague to my mind, but the music thereof was
clear to my ear.</p>
<p>Indeed were it not for what others have said to me of His teaching, I
should not have known even so much as whether He was with Judea or
against it.</p>
<p>SUZANNAH OF NAZARETH</p>
<p>Of the Youth and Manhood of Jesus</p>
<p>I knew Mary the mother of Jesus, before she became the wife of Joseph
the carpenter, when we were both still unwedded.</p>
<p>In those days Mary would behold visions and hear voices, and she
would speak of heavenly ministers who visited her dreams.</p>
<p>And the people of Nazareth were mindful of her, and they observed her
going and her coming. And they gazed upon her brows and spaces in her
steps.</p>
<p>But some said she was possessed. They said this because she would go
only upon her own errands.</p>
<p>I deemed her old while she was young, for there was a harvest in her
blossoming and ripe fruit in her spring.</p>
<p>She was born and reared amongst us yet she was like an alien from the
North Country. In her eyes there was always the astonishment of one not
yet familiar with our faces.</p>
<p>And she was as haughty as Miriam of old who marched with her brothers
form the Nile to the wilderness.</p>
<p>Then Mary was betrothed to Joseph the carpenter.</p>
<p>When Mary was big with Jesus she would walk among the hills and
return at eventide with loveliness and pain in her eyes.</p>
<p>And when Jesus was born I was told that Mary said to her mother, “I
am but a tree unpruned. See you to this fruit.” Martha the midwife heard
her.</p>
<p>After three days I visited her. And there was wonder in her eyes, and
her breasts heaved, and her arm was around her first-born like the shell
that holds the pearl.</p>
<p>We all loved Mary’s babe and we watched Him, for there was warmth in
His being and He throbbed with the pace of His life.</p>
<p>The seasons passed, and He became a boy full of laughter and little
wanderings. None of us knew what He would do for He seemed always
outside of our race. But He was never rebuked though He was venturous
and over-daring.</p>
<p>He played with the other children rather than they with Him.</p>
<p>When He was twelve years old, one day He led a blind man across the
brook to the safety of the open road.</p>
<p>And in gratitude the blind man asked Him, “Little boy, who are
you?”</p>
<p>And He answered, “I am not a little boy. I am Jesus.”</p>
<p>And the blind man said, “Who is your father?”</p>
<p>And He answered, “God is my father.”</p>
<p>And the blind man laughed and replied, “Well said, my little boy. But
who is your mother?”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered, “I am not your little boy. And my mother is the
earth.”</p>
<p>And the blind man said, “Then behold, I was led by the Son of God and
the earth across the stream.”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered, “I will lead you wherever you would go, and my
eyes will accompany your feet.”</p>
<p>And He grew like a precious palm tree in our gardens.</p>
<p>When He was nineteen He was as comely as a hart, and His eyes were
like honey and full of the surprise of day.</p>
<p>And upon His mouth there was the thirst of the desert flock for the
lake.</p>
<p>He would walk the fields alone and our eyes would follow Him, and the
eyes of all the maidens of Nazareth. But we were shy of Him.</p>
<p>Love is forever shy of beauty, yet beauty shall forever be pursued by
love.</p>
<p>Then the years bade Him speak in the temple and in the gardens of
Galilee.</p>
<p>And at times Mary followed Him to listen to His words and to hear the
sound of her own heart. But when He and those who loved Him went down to
Jerusalem she would not go.</p>
<p>For we at the North Country are often mocked in the streets of
Jerusalem, even when we go carrying our offerings to the temple.</p>
<p>And Mary was too proud to yield to the South Country.</p>
<p>And Jesus visited other lands in the east and in the west. We knew
not what lands He visited, yet our hearts followed Him.</p>
<p>But Mary awaited Him upon her threshold and every eventide her eyes
sought the road for His home-coming.</p>
<p>Yet upon His return she would say to us, “He is too vast to be my
Son, too eloquent for my silent heart. How shall I claim Him?”</p>
<p>It seemed to us that Mary could not believe that the plain had given
birth to the mountain; in the whiteness of her heart she did not see
that the ridge is a pathway to the summit.</p>
<p>She knew the man, but because He was her Son she dared not know
Him.</p>
<p>And on a day when Jesus went to the lake to be with the fishermen she
said to me, “What is man but this restless being that would rise from
the earth, and who is man but a longing that desires the stars?</p>
<p>“My son is a longing. He is all of us longing for the stars.</p>
<p>“Did I say my son? May God forgive me. Yet in my heart I would be His
mother.”</p>
<p>Now, it is hard to tell more of Mary and her Son, but though there
shall be husks in my throat, and my words shall reach you like cripples
on crutches, I must needs relate what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>It was in the youth of the year when the red anemones were upon the
hills that Jesus called His disciples saying to them, “Come with me to
Jerusalem and witness the slaying of the lamb for the Passover.”</p>
<p>Upon the selfsame day Mary came to my door and said, “He is seeking
the Holy City. Will you come and follow Him with me and the other
women?”</p>
<p>And we walked the long road behind Mary and her son till we reached
Jerusalem. And there a company of men and women hailed us at the gate,
for His coming had been heralded to those who loved Him.</p>
<p>But upon that very night Jesus left the city with His men.</p>
<p>We were told that He had gone to Bethany.</p>
<p>And Mary stayed with us in the inn, awaiting His return.</p>
<p>Upon the eve of the following Thursday He was caught without the
walls, and was held prisoner.</p>
<p>And when we heard He was a prisoner, Mary uttered not a word, but
there appeared in her eyes the fulfilment of that promised pain and joy
which we had beheld when she was but a bride in Nazareth.</p>
<p>She did not weep. She only moved among us like the ghost of a mother
who would not bewail the ghost of her son.</p>
<p>We sat low upon the floor but she was erect, walking up and down the
room.</p>
<p>She would stand beside the window and gaze eastward, and then with
the fingers of her two hands brush back her hair.</p>
<p>At dawn she was still standing among us, like a lone banner in the
wilderness wherein there are no hosts.</p>
<p>We wept because we knew the morrow of her son; but she did not weep
for she knew also what would befall Him.</p>
<p>Her bones were of bronze and her sinews of the ancient elms, and her
eyes were like the sky, wide and daring.</p>
<p>Have you heard a thrush sing while its nest burns in the wind?</p>
<p>Have you seen a woman whose sorrow is too much for tears, or a
wounded heart that would rise beyond its own pain?</p>
<p>You have not seen such a woman, for you have not stood in the
presence of Mary; and you have not been enfolded by the Mother
Invisible.</p>
<p>In that still moment when the muffled hoofs of silence beat upon the
breasts of the sleepless, John the young son of Zebedee, came and said:
“Mary Mother, Jesus is going forth. Come, let us follow Him.”</p>
<p>And Mary laid her hand upon John’s shoulder and they went out, and we
followed them.</p>
<p>When we came to the Tower of David we saw Jesus carrying His cross.
And there was a great crowd about Him.</p>
<p>And two other men were also carrying their crosses.</p>
<p>And Mary’s head was held high, and she walked with us after her son.
And her step was firm.</p>
<p>And behind her walked Zion and Rome, ay, the whole world, to revenge
itself upon one free Man.</p>
<p>When we reached the hill, He was raised high upon the cross.</p>
<p>And I looked at Mary. And her face was not the face of a woman
bereaved. It was the countenance of the fertile earth, forever giving
birth, forever burying her children.</p>
<p>Then to her eyes came the remembrance of His childhood, and she said
aloud, “My son, who is not my son; man who once visited my womb, I glory
in your power. I know that every drop of blood that runs down from your
hands shall be the well-stream of a nation.</p>
<p>“You die in this tempest even as my heart once died in the sunset,
and I shall now sorrow.”</p>
<p>At that moment I desired to cover my face with my cloak and run away
to the North Country. But of a sudden I heard Mary say, “My son, who is
not my son, what have you said to the man at your right hand that has
made him happy in his agony? The shadow of death is light upon his face,
and he cannot turn his eyes from you.</p>
<p>“Now you smile upon me, and because you smile I know you have
conquered.”</p>
<p>And Jesus looked upon His mother and said, “Mary, from this hour be
you the mother of John.”</p>
<p>And to John He said, “Be a loving son unto this woman. Go to her
house and let your shadow cross the threshold where I once stood. Do
this in remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>And Mary raised her right hand towards Him, and she was like a tree
with one branch. And again she cried, “My son, who is not my son, if
this be of God may God give us patience and the knowledge thereof. And
if it be of man may God forgive him forevermore.</p>
<p>“If it be of God, the snow of Lebanon shall be your shroud; and if it
be only of the priests and soldiers, then I have this garment for your
nakedness.</p>
<p>“My son, who is not my son, that which God builds here shall not
perish; and that which man would destroy shall remain builded, but not
in his sight.”</p>
<p>And at that moment the heavens yielded Him to the earth, a cry and a
breath.</p>
<p>And Mary yielded Him also unto man, a wound and a balsam.</p>
<p>And Mary said, “Now behold, He is gone. The battle is over. The star
has shone forth. The ship has reached the harbour. He who once lay
against my heart is throbbing in space.”</p>
<p>And we came close to her, and she said to us, “Even in death He
smiles. He has conquered. I would indeed be the mother of a
conqueror.”</p>
<p>And Mary returned to Jerusalem leaning upon John the young
disciple.</p>
<p>And she was a woman fulfilled.</p>
<p>And when we reached the gate of the city, I gazed upon her face and I
was astonished, for on that day the head of Jesus was the highest among
men, and yet Mary’s head was not less high.</p>
<p>All this came to pass in the spring of the year.</p>
<p>And now it is autumn. And Mary the mother of Jesus has come again to
her dwelling-place, and she is alone.</p>
<p>Two Sabbaths ago my heart was as a stone in my breast, for my son had
left me for a ship in Tyre. He would be a sailor.</p>
<p>And he said he would return no more.</p>
<p>And upon an evening I sought Mary.</p>
<p>When I entered her house she was sitting at her loom, but she was not
weaving. She was looking into the sky beyond Nazareth.</p>
<p>And I said to her, “Hail, Mary.”</p>
<p>And she stretched out her arm to me, and said, “Come and sit beside
me, and let us watch the sun pour its blood upon the hills.”</p>
<p>And I sat beside her on the bench and we gazed into the west through
the window.</p>
<p>And after a moment Mary said, “I wonder who is crucifying the sun
this eventide.”</p>
<p>Then I said, “I came to you for comfort. My son has left me for the
sea and I am alone in the house across the way.”</p>
<p>Then Mary said, “I would comfort you but how shall I?”</p>
<p>And I said, “If you will only speak of your son I shall be
comforted.”</p>
<p>And Mary smiled upon me, and she laid her hand about my shoulder and
she said, “I will speak of Him. That which will console you will give me
consolation.”</p>
<p>Then she spoke of Jesus, and she spoke long of all that was in the
beginning.</p>
<p>And it seemed to me that in her speech she would have no difference
between her son and mine.</p>
<p>For she said to me, “My son is also a seafarer. Why would you not
trust your son to the waves even as I have trusted Him?</p>
<p>“Woman shall be forever the womb and the cradle but never the tomb.
We die that we may give life unto life even as our fingers spin the
thread for the raiment that we shall never wear.</p>
<p>“And we cast the net for the fish that we shall never taste.</p>
<p>“And for this we sorrow, yet in all this is our joy.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Mary to me.</p>
<p>And I left her and came to my house, and though the light of the day
was spent I sat at my loom to weave more of the cloth.</p>
<p>JOSEPH SURNAMED JUSTUS</p>
<p>Jesus the Wayfarer</p>
<p>They say he was vulgar, the common offspring of common seed, a man
uncouth and violent.</p>
<p>They say that only the wind combed His hair, and only the rain
brought His clothes and His body together.</p>
<p>They deem Him mad, and they attribute His words to demons.</p>
<p>Yet behold, the Man despised sounded a challenge and the sound
thereof shall never cease.</p>
<p>He sang a song and none shall arrest that melody. It shall hover from
generation to generation and it shall rise from sphere to sphere
remembering the lips that gave it birth and the ears that cradled
it.</p>
<p>He was a stranger. Aye, He was a stranger, a wayfarer on His way to a
shrine, a visitor who knocked at our door, a guest from a far
country.</p>
<p>And because He found not a gracious host, He has returned to His own
place.</p>
<p>PHILIP</p>
<p>And When He Died All Mankind Died</p>
<p>When our beloved died, all mankind died and all things for a space
were still and grey. Then the east was darkened, and a tempest rushed
out of it and swept the land. The eyes of the sky opened and shut, and
the rain came down in torrents and carried away the blood that streamed
from His hands and His feet.</p>
<p>I too died. But in the depth of my oblivion I heard Him speak and
say, “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.”</p>
<p>And His voice sought my drowned spirit and I was brought back to the
shore.</p>
<p>And I opened my eyes and I saw His white body hanging against the
cloud, and His words that I had heard took the shape within me and
became a new man. And I sorrowed no more.</p>
<p>Who would sorrow for a sea that is unveiling its face, or for a
mountain that laughs in the sun?</p>
<p>Was it ever in the heart of man, when that heart was pierced, to say
such words?</p>
<p>What other judge of men has released His judges? And did ever love
challenge hate with power more certain of itself?</p>
<p>Was ever such a trumpet heard ’twixt heaven and earth?</p>
<p>Was it known before that the murdered had compassion on his
murderers? Or that the meteor stayed his footsteps for the mole?</p>
<p>The seasons shall tire and the years grow old, ere they exhaust these
words: “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.”</p>
<p>And you and I, though born again and again, shall keep them.</p>
<p>And now I would go into my house, and stand an exalted beggar, at His
door.</p>
<p>BIRBARAH OF YAMMOUNI</p>
<p>On Jesus the Impatient</p>
<p>Jesus was patient with the dullard and the stupid, even as the winter
awaits the spring.</p>
<p>He was patient like a mountain in the wind.</p>
<p>He answered with kindliness the harsh questionings of His foes.</p>
<p>He could even be silent to cavil and dispute, for He was strong and
the strong can be forbearing.</p>
<p>But Jesus was also impatient.</p>
<p>He spared not the hypocrite.</p>
<p>He yielded not to men of cunning nor to the jugglers of words.</p>
<p>And He would not be governed.</p>
<p>He was impatient with those who believed not in light because they
themselves dwelt in shadow; and with those who sought after signs in the
sky rather than in their own hearts.</p>
<p>He was impatient with those who weighed and measured the day and the
night before they would trust their dreams to dawn or eventide.</p>
<p>Jesus was patient.</p>
<p>Yet He was the most impatient of men.</p>
<p>He would have you weave the cloth though you spend years between the
loom and the linen.</p>
<p>But He would have none tear an inch off the woven fabric.</p>
<p>PILATE’S WIFE TO A ROMAN LADY</p>
<p>I was walking with my maidens in the groves outside of Jerusalem when
I saw Him with a few men and women sitting about Him; and He was
speaking to them in a language which I only half understood.</p>
<p>But one needs not a language to perceive a pillar of light or a
mountain of crystal. The heart knows what the tongue may never utter and
the ears may never hear.</p>
<p>He was speaking to His friends of love and strength. I know He spoke
of love because there was melody in His voice; and I know He spoke of
strength because there were armies in His gestures. And He was tender,
though even my husband could not have spoken with such authority.</p>
<p>When He saw me passing by He stopped speaking for a moment and looked
kindly upon me. And I was humbled; and in my soul I knew I had passed by
a god.</p>
<p>After that day His image visited my privacy when I would not be
visited by man or woman; and His eyes searched my soul when my own eyes
were closed. And His voice governs the stillness of my nights.</p>
<p>I am held fast forevermore; and there is peace in my pain, and
freedom in my tears.</p>
<p>Belovèd friend, you have never seen that man, and you will never see
Him.</p>
<p>He is gone beyond our senses, but of all men He is now the nearest to
me.</p>
<p>A MAN OUTSIDE OF JERUSALEM</p>
<p>Of Judas</p>
<p>Judas came to my house that Friday, upon the eve of the Passover; and
he knocked at my door with force.</p>
<p>When he entered I looked at him, and his face was ashen. His hands
trembled like dry twigs in the wind, and his clothes were as wet as if
he had stepped out from a river; for on that evening there were great
tempests.</p>
<p>He looked at me, and the sockets of his eyes were like dark caves and
his eyes were blood-sodden.</p>
<p>And he said, “I have delivered Jesus of Nazareth to His enemies and
to my enemies.”</p>
<p>Then Judas wrung his hands and he said, “Jesus declared that He would
overcome all His foes and the foes of our people. And I believed and I
followed Him.</p>
<p>“When first He called us to Him He promised us a kingdom mighty and
vast, and in our faith we sought His favour that we might have
honourable stations in His court.</p>
<p>“We beheld ourselves princes dealing with these Romans as they have
dealt with us. And Jesus said much about His kingdom, and I thought He
had chosen me a captain of His chariots, and a chief man of his
warriors. And I followed His footsteps willingly.</p>
<p>“But I found it was not a kingdom that Jesus sought, nor was it from
the Romans He would have had us free. His kingdom was but the kingdom of
the heart. I heard Him talk of love and charity and forgiveness, and the
wayside women listened gladly, but my heart grew bitter and I was
hardened.</p>
<p>“My promised king of Judea seemed suddenly to have turned
flute-player, to soothe the mind of wanderers and vagabonds.</p>
<p>“I had loved Him as others of my tribe had loved Him. I had beheld
Him a hope and a deliverance from the yoke of the aliens. But when He
would not utter a word or move a hand to free us from that yoke, and
when He would even have rendered unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s,
then despair filled me and my hopes died. And I said, ‘He who murders my
hopes shall be murdered, for my hopes and expectations are more precious
than the life of any man’.”</p>
<p>Then Judas gnashed his teeth; and he bent down his head. And when he
spoke again, he said, “I have delivered Him up. And He was crucified
this day. . . . Yet when He died upon the cross, He died a king. He died
in the tempest as deliverers die, like vast men who live beyond the
shroud and the stone.</p>
<p>“And all the while He was dying, He was gracious, and He was kindly;
and His heart was full of pity. He felt pity even for me who had
delivered Him up.”</p>
<p>And I said, “Judas, you have committed a grave wrong.”</p>
<p>And Judas answered, “But He died a king. Why did He not live a
king?”</p>
<p>And I said again, “You have committed a grave crime.”</p>
<p>And he sat down there, upon that bench, and he was as still as a
stone.</p>
<p>But I walked to and fro in the room, and once more I said, “You have
committed a great sin.”</p>
<p>But Judas said not a word. He remained as silent as the earth.</p>
<p>And after a while he stood up and faced me and he seemed taller, and
when he spoke his voice was like the sound of a cracked vessel; and he
said, “Sin was not in my heart. This very night I shall seek His
kingdom, and I shall stand in His presence and beg His forgiveness.</p>
<p>“He died a king, and I shall die a felon. But in my heart I know He
will forgive me.”</p>
<p>After saying these words he folded his wet cloak around him and he
said, “It was good that I came to you this night even though I have
brought you trouble. Will you also forgive me?</p>
<p>“Say to your sons and to your sons’ sons: ‘Judas Iscariot delivered
Jesus of Nazareth to His enemies because he believed Jesus was an enemy
to His own race.’</p>
<p>“And say also that Judas upon the selfsame day of his great error
followed the King to the steps of His throne to deliver up his own soul
and to be judged.</p>
<p>“I shall tell Him that my blood also was impatient for the sod, and
my crippled spirit would be free.”</p>
<p>Then Judas leaned his head back against the wall and he cried out, “O
God whose dreaded name no man shall utter ere his lips are touched by
the fingers of death, why did you burn me with a fire that had no
light?</p>
<p>“Why did you give the Galilean a passion for a land unknown and
burden me with desire that would not escape kin or hearth? And who is
this man Judas, whose hands are dipped in blood?</p>
<p>“Lend me a hand to cast him off, an old garment and a tattered
harness.</p>
<p>“Help me to do this tonight.</p>
<p>“And let me stand again outside of these walls.</p>
<p>“I am weary of this wingless liberty. I would a larger dungeon.</p>
<p>“I would flow a stream of tears to the bitter sea. I would be a man
of your mercy rather than one knocking at the gate of his own
heart.”</p>
<p>Thus Judas spoke, and thereupon he opened the door and went out again
into the tempest.</p>
<p>Three days afterwards I visited Jerusalem and heard of all that had
come to pass. And I also heard that Judas had flung himself from the
summit of the High Rock.</p>
<p>I have pondered long since that day, and I understand Judas. He
fulfilled his little life, which hovered like a mist on this land and
enslaved by the Romans, while the great prophet was ascending the
heights.</p>
<p>One man longed for a kingdom in which he was to be a prince.</p>
<p>Another man desired a kingdom in which all men shall be princes.</p>
<p>SARKIS AN OLD GREEK SHEPHERD CALLED THE MADMAN</p>
<p>Jesus and Pan</p>
<p>In a dream I saw Jesus and My God Pan sitting together in the heart
of the forest.</p>
<p>They laughed at each other’s speech, with the brook that ran near
them, and the laughter of Jesus was the merrier. And they conversed
long.</p>
<p>Pan spoke of earth and her secrets, and of his hoofed brothers and
his horned sisters; and of dreams. And he spoke of roots and their
nestlings, and of the sap that wakes and rises and sings to summer.</p>
<p>And Jesus told of the young shoots in the forest, and of flowers and
fruit, and the seed that they shall bear in a season not yet come.</p>
<p>He spoke of birds in space and their singing in the upper world.</p>
<p>And He told of white harts in the desert wherein God shepherds
them.</p>
<p>And Pan was pleased with the speech of the new God, and his nostrils
quivered.</p>
<p>And in the same dream I beheld Pan and Jesus grow quiet and still in
the stillness of the green shadows.</p>
<p>And then Pan took his reeds and played to Jesus.</p>
<p>The trees were shaken and the ferns trembled, and there was a fear
upon me.</p>
<p>And Jesus said, “Good brother, you have the glade and the rocky
height in your reeds.”</p>
<p>Then Pan gave the reeds to Jesus and said, “You play now. It is your
turn.”</p>
<p>And Jesus said, “These reeds are too many for my mouth. I have this
flute.”</p>
<p>And He took His flute and He played.</p>
<p>And I heard the sound of rain in the leaves, and the singing of
streams among the hills, and the falling of snow on the
mountain-top.</p>
<p>The pulse of my heart, that had once beaten with the wind, was
restored again to the wind, and all the waves of my yesterdays were upon
my shore, and I was again Sarkis the shepherd, and the flute of Jesus
became the pipes of countless shepherds calling to countless flocks.</p>
<p>Then Pan said to Jesus, “Your youth is more kin to the reed than my
years. And long ere this in my stillness I have heard your song and the
murmur of your name.</p>
<p>“Your name has a goodly sound; well shall it rise with the sap to the
branches, and well shall it run with the hoofs among the hills.</p>
<p>And it is not strange to me, though my father called me not by that
name. It was your flute that brought it back to my memory.</p>
<p>“And now let us play our reeds together.”</p>
<p>And they played together.</p>
<p>And their music smote heaven and earth, and a terror struck all
living things.</p>
<p>I heard the bellow of beasts and the hunger of the forest. And I
heard the cry of lonely men, and the plaint of those who long for what
they know not.</p>
<p>I heard the sighing of the maiden for her lover, and the panting of
the luckless hunter for his prey.</p>
<p>And then there came peace into their music, and the heavens and the
earth sang together.</p>
<p>All this I saw in my dream, and all this I heard.</p>
<p>ANNAS THE HIGH PRIEST</p>
<p>On Jesus the Rabble</p>
<p>He was of the rabble, a brigand, a mountebank and a self-trumpeter.
He appealed only to the unclean and the disinherited, and for this He
had to go the way of all the tainted and the defiled.</p>
<p>He made sport of us and of our laws; He mocked at our honour and
jeered at our dignity. He even said He would destroy the temple and
desecrate the holy places. He was shameless, and for this He had to die
a shameful death.</p>
<p>He was a man from Galilee of the Gentiles, an alien, from the North
Country where Adonis and Ashtarte still claim power against Israel and
the God of Israel.</p>
<p>He whose tongue halted when He spoke the speech of our prophets was
loud and ear-splitting when he spoke the bastard language of the
low-born and the vulgar.</p>
<p>What else was there for me but to decree His death?</p>
<p>Am I not a guardian of the temple? Am I not a keeper of the law?
Could I have turned my back on Him, saying in all tranquillity: “He is a
madman among madmen. Let Him alone to exhaust Himself raving; for the
mad and the crazed and those possessed with devils shall be naught in
the path of Israel” ?</p>
<p>Could I have been deaf unto Him when he called us liars. hypocrites,
wolves, vipers, and the sons of vipers?</p>
<p>Nay I could not be deaf to Him, for He was not a madman. He was
self-possessed; and in His big-sounding sanity He denounced and
challenged us all.</p>
<p>For this I had Him crucified, and His crucifixion was a signal and
warning unto the others who are stamped with the same damned seal.</p>
<p>I know well I have been blamed for this, even by some of the elders
in the Sanhedrim. But I was mindful then as I am mindful now, that one
man should die for the people rather than the people be led astray by
one man.</p>
<p>Jesus was conquered by an enemy from without. I shall see that Judea
is not conquered again, by an enemy from within.</p>
<p>No man from the cursed North shall reach our Holy of Holies nor lay
His shadow across the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
