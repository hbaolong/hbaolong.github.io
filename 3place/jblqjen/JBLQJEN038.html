<h4 id="on-the-speech-of-jesus">On the Speech of Jesus</h4>
<p>What shall I say of His speech? Perhaps something about His person
lent power to His words and swayed those who heard Him. For He was
comely, and the sheen of the day was upon His countenance.</p>
<p>Men and women gazed at Him more than they listened to His argument.
But at times He spoke with the power of a spirit, and that spirit had
authority over those who heard Him.</p>
<p>In my youth I had heard the orators of Rome and Athens and
Alexandria. The young Nazarene was unlike them all.</p>
<p>They assembled their words with an art to enthral the ear, but when
you heard Him your heart would leave you and go wandering into regions
not yet visited.</p>
<p>He would tell a story or relate a parable, and the like of His
stories and parables had never been heard in Syria. He seemed to spin
them out of the seasons, even as time spins the years and the
generations.</p>
<p>He would begin a story thus: “The ploughman went forth to the field
to sow his seeds.”</p>
<p>Or, “Once there was a rich man who had many vineyards.”</p>
<p>Or, “A shepherd counted his sheep at eventide and found that one
sheep was missing.”</p>
<p>And such words would carry His listeners into their simpler selves,
and into the ancient of their days.</p>
<p>At heart we are all ploughmen, and we all love the vineyard. And in
the pastures of our memory there is a shepherd and a flock and the lost
sheep.</p>
<p>And there is the plough-share and the winepress and the
threshing-floor.</p>
<p>He knew the source of our older self, and the persistent thread of
which we are woven.</p>
<p>The Greek and the Roman orators spoke to their listeners of life as
it seemed to the mind. The Nazarene spoke of a longing that lodged in
the heart.</p>
<p>They saw life with eyes only a little clearer than yours and mine. He
saw life in the light of God.</p>
<p>I often think that He spoke to the crowd as a mountain would speak to
the plain.</p>
<p>And in His speech there was a power that was not commanded by the
orators of Athens or of Rome.</p>
<p>MARY MAGDALENE</p>
<p>On Meeting Jesus for the First Time</p>
<p>It was in the month of June when I saw Him for the first time. He was
walking in the wheat field when I passed by with my handmaidens, and He
was alone.</p>
<p>The rhythm of His steps was different from other men’s, and the
movement of His body was like naught I had seen before.</p>
<p>Men do not pace the earth in that manner. And even now I do not know
whether He walked fast or slow.</p>
<p>My handmaidens pointed their fingers at Him and spoke in shy whispers
to one another. And I stayed my steps for a moment, and raised my hand
to hail Him. But He did not turn His face, and He did not look at me.
And I hated Him. I was swept back into myself, and I was as cold as if I
had been in a snow-drift. And I shivered.</p>
<p>That night I beheld Him in my dreaming; and they told me afterward
that I screamed in my sleep and was restless upon my bed.</p>
<p>It was in the month of August that I saw Him again, through my
window. He was sitting in the shadow of the cypress tree across my
garden, and He was still as if He had been carved out of stone, like the
statues in Antioch and other cities of the North Country.</p>
<p>And my slave, the Egyptian, came to me and said, “That man is here
again. He is sitting there across your garden.”</p>
<p>And I gazed at Him, and my soul quivered within me, for He was
beautiful.</p>
<p>His body was single and each part seemed to love every other
part.</p>
<p>Then I clothed myself with raiment of Damascus, and I left my house
and walked towards Him.</p>
<p>Was it my aloneness, or was it His fragrance, that drew me to Him?
Was it a hunger in my eyes that desired comeliness, or was it His beauty
that sought the light of my eyes?</p>
<p>Even now I do not know.</p>
<p>I walked to Him with my scented garments and my golden sandals, the
sandals the Roman captain had given me, even these sandals. And when I
reached Him, I said, “Good-morrow to you.”</p>
<p>And He said, “Good-morrow to you, Miriam.”</p>
<p>And He looked at me, and His night-eyes saw me as no man had seen me.
And suddenly I was as if naked, and I was shy.</p>
<p>Yet He had only said, “Good-morrow to you.”</p>
<p>And then I said to Him, “Will you not come to my house?”</p>
<p>And He said, “Am I not already in your house?”</p>
<p>I did not know what He meant then, but I know now.</p>
<p>And I said, “Will you not have wine and bread with me?”</p>
<p>And He said, “Yes, Miriam, but not now.”</p>
<p>Not now, not now, He said. And the voice of the sea was in those two
words, and the voice of the wind and the trees. And when He said them
unto me, life spoke to death.</p>
<p>For mind you, my friend, I was dead. I was a woman who had divorced
her soul. I was living apart from this self which you now see. I
belonged to all men, and to none. They called me harlot, and a woman
possessed of seven devils. I was cursed, and I was envied.</p>
<p>But when His dawn-eyes looked into my eyes all the stars of my night
faded away, and I became Miriam, only Miriam, a woman lost to the earth
she had known, and finding herself in new places.</p>
<p>And now again I said to Him, “Come into my house and share bread and
wine with me.”</p>
<p>And He said, “Why do you bid me to be your guest?”</p>
<p>And I said, “I beg you to come into my house.” And it was all that
was sod in me, and all that was sky in me calling unto Him.</p>
<p>Then He looked at me, and the noontide of His eyes was upon me, and
He said, “You have many lovers, and yet I alone love you. Other men love
themselves in your nearness. I love you in your self. Other men see a
beauty in you that shall fade away sooner than their own years. But I
see in you a beauty that shall not fade away, and in the autumn of your
days that beauty shall not be afraid to gaze at itself in the mirror,
and it shall not be offended.</p>
<p>“I alone love the unseen in you.”</p>
<p>Then He said in a low voice, “Go away now. If this cypress tree is
yours and you would not have me sit in its shadow, I will walk my
way.”</p>
<p>And I cried to Him and I said, “Master, come to my house. I have
incense to burn for you, and a silver basin for your feet. You are a
stranger and yet not a stranger. I entreat you, come to my house.”</p>
<p>Then He stood up and looked at me even as the seasons might look down
upon the field, and He smiled. And He said again: “All men love you for
themselves. I love you for yourself.”</p>
<p>And then He walked away.</p>
<p>But no other man ever walked the way He walked. Was it a breath born
in my garden that moved to the east? Or was it a storm that would shake
all things to their foundations?</p>
<p>I knew not, but on that day the sunset of His eyes slew the dragon in
me, and I became a woman, I became Miriam, Miriam of Mijdel.</p>
<p>PHILEMON A GREEK APOTHECARY</p>
<p>On Jesus the Master Physician</p>
<p>The Nazarene was the Master Physician of His people. No other man
knew so much of our bodies and of their elements and properties.</p>
<p>He made whole those who were afflicted with diseases unknown to the
Greeks and the Egyptians. They say He even called back the dead to life.
And whether this be true or not true, it declares His power; for only to
him who has wrought great things is the greatest ever attributed.</p>
<p>They say also that Jesus visited India and the Country between the
Two Rivers, and that there the priests revealed to Him the knowledge of
all that is hidden in the recesses of our flesh.</p>
<p>Yet that knowledge may have been given to Him direct by the gods, and
not through the priests. For that which has remained unknown to all men
for an eon may be disclosed to one man in but a moment. And Apollo may
lay his hand on the heart of the obscure and make it wise.</p>
<p>Many doors were open to the Tyrians and the Thebans, and to this man
also certain sealed doors were opened. He entered the temple of the
soul, which is the body; and He beheld the evil spirits that conspire
against our sinews, and also the good spirits that spin the threads
thereof.</p>
<p>Methinks it was by the power of opposition and resistance that He
healed the sick, but in a manner unknown to our philosophers. He
astonished fever with His snow-like touch and it retreated; and He
surprised the hardened limbs with His own calm and they yielded to Him
and were at peace.</p>
<p>He knew the ebbing sap within the furrowed bark – but how He reached
the sap with His fingers I do not know. He knew the sound steel
underneath the rust – but how He freed the sword and made it shine no
man can tell.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems to me that He heard the murmuring pain of all
things that grow in the sun, and that then He lifted them up and
supported them, not only by His own knowledge, but also by disclosing to
them their own power to rise and become whole.</p>
<p>Yet He was not much concerned with Himself as a physician. He was
rather preoccupied with the religion and the politics of this land. And
this I regret, for first of all things we must needs be sound of
body.</p>
<p>But these Syrians, when they are visited by an illness, seek an
argument rather than medicine.</p>
<p>And pity it is that the greatest of all their physicians chose rather
to be but a maker of speeches in the market-place.</p>
<p>SIMON WHO WAS CALLED PETER</p>
<p>When He and His Brother were Called</p>
<p>I was on the shore of the Lake of Galilee when I first beheld Jesus
my Lord and my Master.</p>
<p>My brother Andrew was with me and we were casting out net into the
waters.</p>
<p>The waves were rough and high and we caught but few fish. And our
hearts were heavy.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jesus stood near us, as if He had taken form that very
moment, for we had not seen Him approaching.</p>
<p>He called us by our names, and He said, “If you will follow me I will
lead you to an inlet where the fishes are swarming.”</p>
<p>And as I looked at His face the net fell from my hands, for a flame
kindled within me and I recognized Him.</p>
<p>And my brother Andrew spoke and said, “We know all the inlets upon
these shores, and we know also that on a windy day like this the fish
seek a depth beyond our nets.”</p>
<p>And Jesus answered, “Follow me to the shores of a greater sea. I
shall make you fishers of men. And your net shall never be empty.”</p>
<p>And we abandoned our boat and our net and followed Him.</p>
<p>I myself was drawn by a power, viewless, that walked beside His
person.</p>
<p>I walked near Him, breathless and full of wonder, and my brother
Andrew was behind us, bewildered and amazed.</p>
<p>And as we walked on the sand I made bold and said unto Him, “Sir, I
and my brother will follow your footsteps, and where you go we too will
go. But if it please you to come to our house this night, we shall be
graced by your visit. Our house is not large and our ceiling not high,
and you will sit at but a frugal meal. Yet if you will abide in our
hovel it will be to us a palace. And would you break bread with us, we
in your presence were to be envied by the princes of the land.”</p>
<p>And He said, “Yea, I will be your guest this night.”</p>
<p>And I rejoiced in my heart. And we walked behind Him in silence until
we reached our house.</p>
<p>And as we stood at the threshold Jesus said, “Peace be to this house,
and to those who dwell in it.”</p>
<p>Then He entered and we followed Him.</p>
<p>My wife and my wife’s mother and my daughter stood before Him and
they worshipped Him; then they knelt before Him and kissed the hem of
His sleeve.</p>
<p>They were astonished that He, the chosen and the well beloved, had
come to be our guest; for they had already seen Him by the River Jordan
when John the Baptist had proclaimed Him before the people.</p>
<p>And straightway my wife and my wife’s mother began to prepare the
supper.</p>
<p>My brother Andrew was a shy man, but his faith in Jesus was deeper
than my faith.</p>
<p>And my daughter, who was then but twelve year old, stood by Him and
held His garment as if she were in fear He would leave us and go out
again into the night. She clung to Him like a lost sheep that has found
its shepherd.</p>
<p>Then we sat at the board, and He broke the bread and poured the wine;
and He turned to us saying, “My friends, grace me now in sharing this
food with me, even as the Father has graced us in giving it unto
us.”</p>
<p>These words He said ere He touched a morsel, for He wished to follow
an ancient custom that the honoured guest becomes the host.</p>
<p>And as we sat with Him around the board we felt as if we were sitting
at the feast of the great King.</p>
<p>My daughter Petronelah, who was young and unknowing, gazed at His
face and followed the movements of His hands. And I saw a veil of tears
in her eyes.</p>
<p>When He left the board we followed Him and sat about Him in the
vine-arbour.</p>
<p>And He spoke to us and we listened, and our hearts fluttered within
us like birds.</p>
<p>He spoke of the second birth of man, and of the opening of the gates
of the heavens; and of angels descending and bringing peace and good
cheer to all men, and of angels ascending to the throne bearing the
longings of men to the Lord God.</p>
<p>Then He looked into my eyes and gazed into the depths of my heart.
And He said, “I have chosen you and your brother, and you must needs
come with me. You have laboured and you have been heavy-laden. Now I
shall give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn of me, for in my heart is
peace, and your soul shall find abundance and a home-coming.”</p>
<p>When He spoke thus I and my brother stood up before Him, and I said
to Him, “Master, we will follow you to the ends of the earth. And if our
burden were as heavy as the mountain we would bear it with you in
gladness. And should we fall by the wayside we shall know that we have
fallen on the way to heaven, and we shall be satisfied.”</p>
<p>And my brother Andrew spoke and said, “Master, we would be threads
between your hands and your loom. Weave us into the cloth if you will,
for we would be in the raiment of the Most High.”</p>
<p>And my wife raised her face, and the tears were upon her cheeks and
she spoke with joy, and she said, “Blessed are you who come in the name
of the Lord. Blessed is the womb that carried you, and the breast that
gave you milk.”</p>
<p>And my daughter, who was but twelve years old, sat at His feet and
she nestled close to Him.</p>
<p>And the mother of my wife, who sat at the threshold, said no word.
She only wept in silence and her shawl was wet with her tears.</p>
<p>Then Jesus walked over to her and He raised her face to His face and
He said to her, “You are the mother of all these. You weep for joy, and
I will keep your tears in my memory.”</p>
<p>And now the old moon rose above the horizon. And Jesus gazed upon it
for a moment, and then He turned to us and said, “It is late. Seek your
beds, and may God visit your repose. I will be here in this arbour until
dawn. I have cast my net this day and I have caught two men; I am
satisfied, and now I bid you good-night.”</p>
<p>Then my wife’s mother said, “But we have laid your bed in the house,
I pray you enter and rest.”</p>
<p>And He answered her saying, “I would indeed rest, but not under a
roof. Suffer me to lie this night under the canopy of the grapes and the
stars.”</p>
<p>And she made haste and brought out the mattress and the pillows and
the coverings. And He smiled at her and He said, “Behold, I shall lie
down upon a bed twice made.”</p>
<p>Then we left Him and entered into the house, and my daughter was the
last one to enter. And her eyes were upon Him until I had closed the
door.</p>
<p>Thus for the first time I knew my Lord and Master.</p>
<p>And though it was many years ago, it still seems but of today.</p>
<p>CAIAPHAS</p>
<p>The High Priest</p>
<p>In speaking of that man Jesus and of His death let us consider two
salient facts: the Torah must needs be held in safety by us, and this
kingdom must needs be protected by Rome.</p>
<p>Now that man was defiant to us and to Rome. He poisoned the mind of
the simple people, and He led them as if by magic against us and against
Caesar.</p>
<p>My own slaves, both men and women, after hearing him speak in the
market-place, turned sullen and rebellious. Some of them left my house
and escaped to the desert whence they came.</p>
<p>Forget not that the Torah is our foundation and our tower of
strength. No man shall undermine us while we have this power to restrain
his hand, and no man shall overthrow Jerusalem so long as its walls
stand upon the ancient stone that David laid.</p>
<p>If the seed of Abraham is indeed to live and thrive this soil must
remain undefiled.</p>
<p>And that man Jesus was a defiler and a corrupter. We slew Him with a
conscience both deliberate and clean. And we shall slay all those who
would debase the laws of Moses or seek to befoul our sacred
heritage.</p>
<p>We and Pontius Pilatus knew the danger in that man, and that it was
wise to bring Him to an end.</p>
<p>I shall see that His followers come to the same end, and the echo of
His words to the same silence.</p>
<p>If Judea is to live all men who oppose her must be brought down to
the dust. And ere Judea shall die I will cover my grey head with ashes
even as did Samuel the prophet, and I will tear off this garment of
Aaron and clothe me in sackcloth until I go hence for ever.</p>
<p>JOANNA THE WIFE OF HEROD’S STEWARD</p>
<p>On Children</p>
<p>Jesus was never married but He was a friend of women, and He knew
them as they would be known in sweet comradeship.</p>
<p>And He loved children as they would be loved in faith and
understanding.</p>
<p>In the light of His eyes there was a father and a brother and a
son.</p>
<p>He would hold a child upon His knees and say, “Of such is your might
and your freedom; and of such is the kingdom of the spirit.”</p>
<p>They say that Jesus heeded not the law of Moses, and that He was
over-forgiving to the prostitutes of Jerusalem and the country side.</p>
<p>I myself at that time was deemed a prostitute, for I loved a man who
was not my husband, and he was a Sadducee.</p>
<p>And on a day the Sadducees came upon me in my house when my lover was
with me, and they seized me and held me, and my lover walked away and
left me.</p>
<p>Then they led me to the market-place where Jesus was teaching.</p>
<p>it was their desire to hold me up before Him as a test and a trap for
Him.</p>
<p>But Jesus judged me not. He laid shame upon those who would have had
me shamed, and He reproached them.</p>
<p>And He bade me go my way.</p>
<p>And after that all the tasteless fruit of life turned sweet to my
mouth, and the scentless blossoms breathed fragrance into my nostrils. I
became a woman without a tainted memory, and I was free, and my head was
no longer bowed down.</p>
<p>RAFCA</p>
<p>The Bride of Cana</p>
<p>This happened before He was known to the people.</p>
<p>I was in my mother’s garden tending the rose-bushes, when He stopped
at our gate.</p>
<p>And He said, “I am thirsty. Will you give me water from your
well?”</p>
<p>And I ran and brought the silver cup, and filled it with water; and I
poured into it a few drops from the jasmine vial.</p>
<p>And He drank deep and was pleased.</p>
<p>Then He looked into my eyes and said, “My blessing shall be upon
you.”</p>
<p>When He said that I felt as it were a gust of wind rushing through my
body. And I was no longer shy; and I said, “Sir, I am betrothed to a man
of Cana in Galilee. And I shall be married on the fourth day of the
coming week. Will you not come to my wedding and grace my marriage with
your presence?”</p>
<p>And He answered, “I will come, my child.”</p>
<p>Mind you, He said, “My child,” yet He was but a youth, and I was
nearly twenty.</p>
<p>Then He walked on down the road.</p>
<p>And I stood at the gate of our garden until my mother called me into
the house.</p>
