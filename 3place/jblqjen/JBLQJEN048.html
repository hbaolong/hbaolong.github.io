<h4 id="on-the-fate-of-jesus">On the Fate of Jesus</h4>
<p>You believe in what you hear said. Believe in the unsaid, for the
silence of men is nearer the truth than their words.</p>
<p>You ask if Jesus could have escaped His shameful death and saved His
followers from persecution.</p>
<p>I answer, He could indeed have escaped had He chosen, but He did not
seek safety nor was He mindful of protecting His flock from wolves of
the night.</p>
<p>He knew His fate and the morrow of His constant lovers. He foretold
and prophesied what should befall every one of us. He sought not His
death; but He accepted death as a husband-man shrouding his corn with
earth, accepts the winter, and then awaits the spring and harvest; and
as a builder lays the largest stone in the foundation.</p>
<p>We were men of Galilee and from the slopes of Lebanon. Our Master
could have led us back to our country, to live with His youth in our
gardens until old age should come and whisper us back into the
years.</p>
<p>Was anything barring His path back to the temples of our villages
where others were reading the prophets and then disclosing their
hearts?</p>
<p>Could He not have said, “Now I go east with the west wind,” and so
saying dismiss us with a smile upon His lips?</p>
<p>Aye, He could have said, “Go back to your kin. The world is not ready
for me. I shall return a thousand years hence. Teach your children to
await my return.”</p>
<p>He could have done this had He so chosen.</p>
<p>But He knew that to build the temple invisible He must needs lay
Himself the corner-stone, and lay us around as little pebbles cemented
close to Himself.</p>
<p>He knew that the sap of His tree must rise from its roots, and He
poured His blood upon its roots; and to Him it was not sacrifice but
rather gain.</p>
<p>Death is the revealer. The death of Jesus revealed His life.</p>
<p>Had He escaped you and His enemies, you would have been the
conquerors of the world. Therefore He did not escape.</p>
<p>Only He who desires all shall give all.</p>
<p>Aye, Jesus could have escaped His enemies and lived to old age. But
He knew the passing of the seasons, and He would sing His song.</p>
<p>What man facing the armed world would not be conquered for the moment
that he might overcome the ages?</p>
<p>And now you ask who, in very truth, slew Jesus, the Romans or the
priests of Jerusalem?</p>
<p>Neither the Romans slew Him, nor the priests. The whole world stood
to honour Him upon that hill.</p>
<p>JONATHAN</p>
<p>Among the Water-Lilies</p>
<p>Upon a day my beloved and I were rowing upon the lake of sweet
waters. And the hills of Lebanon were about us.</p>
<p>We moved beside the weeping willows, and the reflections of the
willows were deep around us.</p>
<p>And while I steered the boat with an oar, my beloved took her lute
and sang thus:</p>
<p>What flower save the lotus knows the waters and the sun?</p>
<p>What heart save the lotus heart shall know both earth and sky?</p>
<p>Behold my love, the golden flower that floats ’twixt deep and
high</p>
<p>Even as you and I float betwixt a love that has for ever been</p>
<p>And shall for ever be.</p>
<p>Dip your oar, my love,</p>
<p>And let me touch my strings.</p>
<p>Let us follow the willows, and let us leave not the water-lilies.</p>
<p>In Nazareth there lives a Poet, and His heart is like the lotus.</p>
<p>He has visited the soul of woman,</p>
<p>He knows her thirst is growing out of the waters,</p>
<p>And her hunger for the sun, though all her lips are fed.</p>
<p>They say He walks in Galilee.</p>
<p>I say He is rowing with us.</p>
<p>Can you not see His face, my love?</p>
<p>Can you not see, where the willow bough and its reflection meet,</p>
<p>He is moving as we move?</p>
<p>Beloved, it is good to know the youth of life.</p>
<p>It is good to know its singing joy.</p>
<p>Would that you might always have the oar,</p>
<p>And I my stringed lute,</p>
<p>Where the lotus laughs in the sun,</p>
<p>And the willow is dipping to the waters,</p>
<p>And His voice is upon my strings.</p>
<p>Dip your oar, my beloved,</p>
<p>And let me touch my strings.</p>
<p>There is a Poet in Nazareth</p>
<p>Who knows and loves us both.</p>
<p>Dip your oar, my lover,</p>
<p>And let me touch my strings.</p>
<p>HANNAH OF BETHSAIDA</p>
<p>She Speaks of her Father’s Sister</p>
<p>The sister of my father had left us in her youth to dwell in a hut
beside her father’s ancient vineyard.</p>
<p>She lived alone, and the people of the countryside sought her in
their maladies, and she healed them with green herbs, and with roots and
flowers dried in the sun.</p>
<p>And they deemed her a seeress; but there were those also who called
her witch and sorceress.</p>
<p>One day my father said to me, “Take these loaves of wheaten bread to
my sister, and take this jug of wine and this basket of raisins.”</p>
<p>And it was all put upon the back of a colt, and I followed the road
until I reached the vineyard, and the hut of my father’s sister. And she
was gladdened.</p>
<p>Now as we sat together in the cool of the day, a man came by upon the
road, and He greeted the sister of my father, saying, “Good-even to you,
and the blessing of the night be upon you.”</p>
<p>Then she rose up; and she stood as in awe before Him and said,
“Good-even to you, master of all good spirits, and conqueror of all evil
spirits.”</p>
<p>The man looked at her with tender eyes, and then He passed on by.</p>
<p>But I laughed in my heart. Methought my father’s sister was mad. But
now I know that she was not mad. It was I who did not understand.</p>
<p>She knew of my laughter, though it was hidden.</p>
<p>And she spoke, but not in anger. She said, “Listen, my daughter, and
hearken and keep my word in remembrance: the man who but now passed by,
like the shadow of a bird flying between the sun and the earth, shall
prevail against the Caesars and the empire of the Caesars. He shall
wrestle with the crowned bull of Chaldea, and the man-headed lion of
Egypt, and He shall overcome them; and He shall rule the world.</p>
<p>“But this land that now He walks shall come to naught; and Jerusalem,
which sits proudly upon the hill, shall drift away in smoke upon the
wind of desolation.”</p>
<p>When she spoke thus, my laughter turned to stillness and I was quiet.
Then I said, “Who is this man, and of what country and tribe does He
come? And how shall He conquer the great kings and the empires of the
great kings?”</p>
<p>And she answered, “He is one born here in this land, but we have
conceived Him in our longing from the beginning of years. He is of all
tribes and yet of none. He shall conquer by the word of His mouth and by
the flame of His spirit.”</p>
<p>Then suddenly she rose and stood up like a pinnacle of rock; and she
said, “May the angel of the Lord forgive me for pronouncing this word
also: He shall be slain, and His youth shall be shrouded, and He shall
be laid in silence beside the tongue-less heart of the earth. And the
maidens of Judea shall weep for Him.”</p>
<p>Then she lifted her hand skyward and spoke again, and she said, “But
He shall be slain only in the body.</p>
<p>“In the spirit He shall rise and go forth leading His host from this
land where the sun is born, to the land where the sun is slain at
eventide.</p>
<p>“And His name shall be first among men.”</p>
<p>She was an aged seeress when she said these things, and I was but a
girl, a field unploughed, a stone not yet in a wall.</p>
<p>But all that she beheld in the mirror of her mind has come to pass
even in my day.</p>
<p>Jesus of Nazareth rose from the dead and led men and women unto the
people of the sunset. The city that yielded Him to judgment was given
unto destruction; and in the Judgment Hall where He was tried and
sentenced, the owl hoots a dirge while the night weeps the dew of her
heart upon the fallen marble.</p>
<p>And I am an old woman, and the years bend me down. My people are no
more and my race is vanished.</p>
<p>I saw Him but once again after that day, and once again heard His
voice. It was upon a hill-top when He was talking to His friends and
followers.</p>
<p>And now I am old and alone, yet still He visits my dreams.</p>
<p>He comes like a white angel with pinions; and with His grace He
hushes my dread of darkness. And He uplifts me to dreams yet more
distant.</p>
<p>I am still a field unploughed, a ripe fruit that would not fall. The
most that I possess is the warmth of the sun, and the memory of that
man.</p>
<p>I know that among my people these shall not rise again king nor
prophet nor priest, even as the sister of my father foretold.</p>
<p>We shall pass with the flowing of the rivers, and we shall be
nameless.</p>
<p>But those who crossed Him in mid-stream shall be remembered for
crossing Him in mid-stream.</p>
<p>MANASSEH</p>
