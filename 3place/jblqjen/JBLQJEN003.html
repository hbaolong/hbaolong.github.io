<h4 id="brief-introduction-kahlil-gibran">BRIEF INTRODUCTION: KAHLIL
GIBRAN</h4>
<p>Kahlil Gibran, the renowned Lebanese-American poet, was born into a
Maronite Catholic family from the historical town of Bsharri in northern
Mount Lebanon, then a semi-autonomous part of the Ottoman Empire. His
mother, Kamila, daughter of a priest, was thirty when he was born; his
father, Khalil, was her third husband. As a result of his family’s
poverty, Gibran received no formal schooling during his youth; however,
priests regularly visited him and taught him about the Bible and the
Arabic language. His father initially worked as an apothecary, but with
gambling debts he was unable to pay, he went to work for a local
Ottoman-appointed administrator. In 1891 Gibran’s father was imprisoned
for embezzlement and his family’s property was confiscated by the
authorities. With mounting debts and difficulties surrounding her,
Kamila decided to follow her brother to America. Although the father was
released in 1894, Kamila held fast and left for New York on 25 June
1895, taking Khalil, his younger sisters Mariana and Sultana, and his
elder half-brother Peter.</p>
<p>The family settled in Boston’s South End, at the time the
second-largest Syrian-Lebanese-American community in the United States.
Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as “Kahlil Gibran”. His
mother found work as a seamstress peddler, selling lace and linens that
she carried from door to door. Gibran started school in September 1895
and was placed in a special class for immigrants to learn English. He
also enrolled in an art school at Denison House, a nearby settlement
house, where his teachers introduced him to the avant-garde Boston
artist, photographer and publisher Fred Holland Day, who encouraged and
supported Gibran in his artistic endeavours.</p>
<p>Gibran’s mother, along with his elder brother Peter, wanted him to
absorb more of his own heritage rather than the Western aesthetic
culture he was attracted to. Therefore, aged fifteen, Gibran returned to
his homeland to study at a Maronite-run preparatory school and
higher-education institute in Beirut, called “al-Hikma” (The Wisdom).
There he established a student literary magazine with a classmate and
was elected college poet. He remained there for several years before
returning to Boston in 1902. Tragically, two weeks before he returned to
Boston, his sister Sultana died of tuberculosis at the age of fourteen;
the following year, Peter died of the same disease and his mother died
of cancer. During this very difficult time, his sister Mariana supported
Gibran and herself by working at a dressmaker’s shop.</p>
<p>Gibran was an accomplished artist, especially in drawing and
watercolour, having attended the Académie Julian art school in Paris
from 1908 to 1910. Adopting a symbolist and romantic style, he held his
first art exhibition in 1904 at Day’s studio in Boston. During the
exhibition, he met Mary Elizabeth Haskell, a respected headmistress ten
years his senior. The two formed an important friendship that lasted the
rest of the poet’s life. The nature of their relationship remains
unclear; though some biographers believe they were lovers, yet never
married as Haskell’s family objected; others believe their relationship
was only platonic. Haskell later married Jacob Florance Minis, yet she
continued to support Gibran financially and helped advance his career.
She became his editor and introduced him to Charlotte Teller, a
journalist, and Emilie Michel (Micheline), a French teacher, who
accepted to pose for him as a model and became close friends.</p>
<p>Though most of Gibran’s early poetry was composed in Arabic, his work
published after 1918 was chiefly written in English. His first book for
the publishing company Alfred A. Knopf, in 1918, was The Madman, a slim
volume of aphorisms and parables written in biblical cadence, somewhere
between poetry and prose. Gibran also took part in the New York Pen
League, also known as the “immigrant poets”, alongside important
Lebanese-American authors such as Ameen Rihani, Elia Abu Madi and
Mikhail Naimy, a close friend and distinguished master of Arabic
literature.</p>
<p>Gibran’s most celebrated work is a book composed of twenty-six poetic
essays, entitled The Prophet. It concerns the prophet, Almustafa, who
has lived in the foreign city of Orphalese for twelve years and is about
to board a ship that will carry him home. He is stopped by a group of
people, with whom he discusses topics such as life and the human
condition. The book is divided into chapters dealing with love,
marriage, children, giving, eating and drinking, work, joy and sorrow,
houses, clothes, buying and selling, crime and punishment, laws,
freedom, reason and passion, pain, self-knowledge, teaching, friendship,
religion and death.</p>
<p>From an ambitious first printing of 2,000 copies in 1923, Knopf sold
1,159 books. The demand for The Prophet doubled the following year — and
doubled again the year after that. Since then, annual sales have risen
steadily: from 12,000 in 1935 to 111,000 in 1961 to 240,000 in 1965. The
book sold its one millionth copy in 1957. Its popularity grew markedly
during the 1960’s with the American counterculture and subsequently with
the flowering of New Age movements. It has remained popular with this
readership and with the wider population to this day. Since its first
publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. Having
been translated into more than forty languages, it is one of the
bestselling books of the twentieth century in the United States.</p>
<p>Though born a Maronite, Gibran was influenced not only by his own
religion but also by Islam, and especially by the mysticism of the
Sufis. His knowledge of Lebanon’s bloody history, with its destructive
factional struggles, strengthened his belief in the fundamental unity of
religions, which his parents exemplified by welcoming people of various
religions in their home. Connections and parallels have also been made
to William Blake’s poetry, as well as the theological ideas of Walt
Whitman and Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>
<p>Gibran was a great admirer of Francis Marrash, a Syrian writer and
poet of the Nahda movement, whose works he had studied at the al-Hikma
school in Beirut. Commentators have remarked how Gibran’s own poetical
works resemble Marrash’s subject matter, use of structure and style.
Marrash is noted for his concept of universal love, which would have a
profound influence on the writings of the later poet. Gibran’s poetry
often employs formal language and spiritual terms, heightening the sense
of the divine. Many of Gibran’s poems deal with Christianity, especially
on the theme of spiritual love. But his mysticism is a convergence of
several different influences, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism and
theosophy. He famously wrote: “You are my brother and I love you. I love
you when you prostrate yourself in your mosque, and kneel in your church
and pray in your synagogue. You and I are sons of one faith — the
Spirit.”</p>
<p>Gibran died of cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis in New York on
10 April 1931, aged forty-eight. He had expressed a wish to be buried in
Lebanon, which was fulfilled in 1932, when Haskell and his sister
Mariana purchased the Mar Sarkis Monastery, which has since become the
Gibran Museum. Written next to Gibran’s grave are the words “a word I
want to see written on my grave: I am alive like you, and I am standing
beside you. Close your eyes and look around, you will see me in front of
you.”</p>
<p>Gibran willed the contents of his studio to Haskell, where she
discovered her letters to him spanning twenty-three years. She initially
agreed to burn them due to their intimacy, but recognising their
historical value she later decided to preserve them. Today they are held
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library. Haskell also
donated her personal collection of nearly one hundred original works of
art by Gibran to the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah, Georgia. Her
gift to the Telfair is the largest public collection of Gibran’s visual
art in the country, consisting of five oils and numerous works on paper
rendered in the artist’s lyrical style, reflecting the influence of
symbolism. The future American royalties to his books were willed to his
hometown of Bsharri, to be “used for good causes”.</p>
