<h4 id="on-the-morrow-of-his-followers">On the Morrow of His
Followers</h4>
<p>Once at sundown Jesus led us into the village of Beithsaida. We were
a tired company, and the dust of the road was upon us. And we came to a
great house in the midst of a garden, and the owner stood at the
gate.</p>
<p>And Jesus said to him, “These men are weary and footsore. Let them
sleep in your house. The night is cold and they are in need of warmth
and rest.”</p>
<p>And the rich man said, “They shall not sleep in my house.”</p>
<p>And Jesus said, “Suffer them then to sleep in your garden.”</p>
<p>And the man answered, “Nay, they shall not sleep in my garden.”</p>
<p>Then Jesus turned to us and said, “This is what your tomorrow will
be, and this present is like your future. All doors shall be closed in
your face, and not even the gardens that lie under the stars may be your
couch.</p>
<p>“Should your feet indeed be patient with the road and follow me, it
may be you will find a basin and a bed, and perhaps bread and wine also.
But if it should be that you find none of those things, forget not then
that you have crossed one of my deserts.</p>
<p>“Come, let us go forth.”</p>
<p>And the rich man was disturbed, and his face was changed, and he
muttered to himself words that I did not hear; and he shrank away from
us and turned into his garden.</p>
<p>And we followed Jesus upon the road.</p>
<p>MELACHI OF BABYLON AN ASTRONOMER</p>
<p>The Miracles of Jesus</p>
<p>You question me concerning the miracles of Jesus.</p>
<p>Every thousand thousand years the sun and the moon and this earth and
all her sister planets meet in a straight line, and they confer for a
moment together.</p>
<p>Then they slowly disperse and await the passing of another thousand
thousand years.</p>
<p>There are no miracles beyond the seasons, yet you and I do not know
all the seasons. And what if a season shall be made manifest in the
shape of a man?</p>
<p>In Jesus the elements of our bodies and our dreams came together
according to law. All that was timeless before Him became timeful in
Him.</p>
<p>They say He gave sight to the blind and walking to the paralysed, and
that He drove devils out of madmen.</p>
<p>Perchance blindness is but a dark thought that can be overcome by a
burning thought. Perchance a withered limb is but idleness that can be
quickened by energy. And perhaps the devils, these restless elements in
our life, are driven out by the angels of peace and serenity.</p>
<p>They say He raised the dead to life. If you can tell me what is
death, then I will tell you what is life.</p>
<p>In a field I have watched an acorn, a thing so still and seemingly
useless. And in the spring I have seen that acorn take roots and rise,
the beginning of an oak tree, towards the sun.</p>
<p>Surely you would deem this a miracle, yet that miracle is wrought a
thousand thousand times in the drowsiness of every autumn and the
passion of every spring.</p>
<p>Why shall it not be wrought in the heart of man? Shall not the
seasons meet in the hand or upon the lips of a Man Anointed?</p>
<p>If our God has given to earth the art to nestle seed whilst the seed
is seemingly dead, why shall He not give to the heart of man to breathe
life into another heart, even a heart seemingly dead?</p>
<p>I have spoken of these miracles which I deem but little beside the
greater miracle, which is the man Himself, the Wayfarer, the man who
turned my dross into gold, who taught me how to love those who hate me,
and in so doing brought me comfort and gave sweet dreams to my
sleep.</p>
<p>This is the miracle in my own life.</p>
<p>My soul was blind, my soul was lame. I was possessed by restless
spirits, and I was dead.</p>
<p>But now I see clearly, and I walk erect. I am at peace, and I live to
witness and proclaim my own being every hour of the day.</p>
<p>And I am not one of His followers. I am but an old astronomer who
visits the fields of space once a season, and who would be heedful of
the law and the miracles thereof.</p>
<p>And I am at the twilight of my time, but whenever I would seek its
dawning, I seek the youth of Jesus.</p>
<p>And for ever shall age seek youth. In me now it is knowledge that is
seeking vision.</p>
<p>A PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>On Wonder and Beauty</p>
<p>When he was with us He gazed at us and at our world with eyes of
wonder, for His eyes were not veiled with the veil of years, and all
that He saw was clear in the light of His youth.</p>
<p>Though He knew the depth of beauty, He was for ever surprised by its
peace and its majesty; and He stood before the earth as the first man
had stood before the first day.</p>
<p>We whose senses have been dulled, we gaze in full daylight and yet we
do not see. We would cup our ears, but we do not hear; and stretch forth
our hands, but we do not touch. And though all the incense of Arabia is
burned, we go our way and do not smell.</p>
<p>We see not the ploughman returning from his field at eventide; nor
hear the shepherd’s flute when he leads his flock to the fold, nor do we
stretch our arms to touch the sunset; and our nostrils hunger no longer
for the roses of Sharon.</p>
<p>Nay, we honour no kings without kingdoms; nor hear the sound of harps
save when the strings are plucked by hands; nor do we see a child
playing in our olive grove as if he were a young olive tree. And all
words must needs rise from lips of flesh, or else we deem each other
dumb and deaf.</p>
<p>In truth we gaze but do not see, and hearken but do not hear; we eat
and drink but do not taste. And there lies the difference between Jesus
of Nazareth and ourselves.</p>
<p>His senses were all continually made new, and the world to Him was
always a new world.</p>
<p>To Him the lisping of a babe was not less than the cry of all
mankind, while to us it is only lisping.</p>
<p>To Him the root of a buttercup was a longing towards God, while to us
it is naught but a root.</p>
<p>URIAH AN OLD MAN OF NAZARETH</p>
<p>He was a Stranger in our Midst</p>
<p>He was a stranger in our midst, and His life was hidden with dark
veils.</p>
<p>He walked not the path of our God, but followed the course of the
foul and the infamous.</p>
<p>His childhood revolted, and rejected the sweet milk of our
nature.</p>
<p>His youth was inflamed like dry grass that burns in the night.</p>
<p>And when He became a man, He took arms against us all.</p>
<p>Such men are conceived in the ebb tide of human kindness, and born in
unholy tempests. And in tempests they live a day and the perish
forever.</p>
<p>Do you not remember Him, a boy overweening, who would argue with our
learned elders, and laugh at their dignity?</p>
<p>And remember you not His youth, when He lived by the saw and the
chisel? He would not accompany our sons and daughters on their holidays.
He would walk alone.</p>
<p>And He would not return the salutation of those who hailed Him, as
though He were above us.</p>
<p>I myself met Him once in the field and greeted Him, and He only
smiled, and in His smile I beheld arrogance and insult.</p>
<p>Not long afterward my daughter went with her companions to the
vineyards to gather the grapes, and she spoke to Him and He did not
answer her.</p>
<p>He spoke only to the whole company of grape-gatherers, as if my
daughter had not been among them.</p>
<p>When He abandoned His people and turned vagabond He became naught but
a babbler. His voice was like a claw in our flesh, and the sound of His
voice is still a pain in our memory.</p>
<p>He would utter only evil of us and of our fathers and forefathers.
And His tongue sought our bosoms like a poisoned arrow.</p>
<p>Such was Jesus.</p>
<p>If He had been my son, I would have committed Him with the Roman
legions to Arabia, and I would have begged the captain to place Him in
the forefront of the battle, so that the archer of the foe might mark
Him, and free me of His insolence.</p>
<p>But I have no son. And mayhap I should be grateful. For what if my
son had been an enemy of his own people, and my grey hairs were now
seeking the dust with shame, my white beard humbled?</p>
<p>NICODEMUS THE POET</p>
<p>On Fools and Jugglers</p>
<p>Many are the fools who say that Jesus stood in His own path and
opposed Himself; that He knew not His own mind, and in the absence of
that knowledge confounded Himself.</p>
<p>Many indeed are the owls who know no song unlike their own
hooting.</p>
<p>You and I know the jugglers of words who would honour only a greater
juggler, men who carry their heads in baskets to the market-place and
sell them to the first bidder.</p>
<p>We know the pygmies who abuse the sky-man. And we know what the weed
would say of the oak tree and the cedar.</p>
<p>I pity them that they cannot rise to the heights.</p>
<p>I pity the shrivelling thorn envying the elm that dares the
seasons.</p>
<p>But pity, though enfolded by the regret of all the angels, can bring
them no light.</p>
<p>I know the scarecrow whose rotting garments flutter in the corn, yet
he himself is dead to the corn and to the singing wind.</p>
<p>I know the wingless spider that weaves a net for all who fly.</p>
<p>I know the crafty, the blowers of horns and the beaters of drums, who
in the abundance of their own noise cannot hear the skylark nor the east
wind in the forest.</p>
<p>I know him who paddles against all streams, but never finds the
source, who runs with all rivers, but never dares to the sea.</p>
<p>I know him who offers his unskilled hands to the builder of the
temple, and when his unskilled hands are rejected, says in the darkness
of his heart, “I will destroy all that shall be builded.”</p>
<p>I know all these. They are the men who object that Jesus said on a
certain day, “I bring peace unto you,” and on another day, “I bring a
sword.”</p>
<p>They cannot understand that in truth He said, “I bring peace unto men
of goodwill, and I lay a sword between him who would peace and him who
would a sword.”</p>
<p>They wonder that He who said, “My kingdom is not of this earth,” said
also, “Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s”; and know not that if
they would indeed be free to enter the kingdom of their passion, they
must not resist the gate-keeper of their necessities. It behooves them
gladly to pay that dole to enter into that city.</p>
<p>There are the men who say, “He preached tenderness and kindliness and
filial love, yet He would not heed His mother and His brothers when they
sought Him in the streets of Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>They do not know that His mother and brothers in their loving fear
would have had Him return to the bench of the carpenter, whereas He was
opening our eyes to the dawn of a new day.</p>
<p>His mother and His brothers would have had Him live in the shadow of
death, but He Himself was challenging death upon yonder hill that He
might live in our sleepless memory.</p>
<p>I know these moles that dig paths to nowhere. Are they not the ones
who accuse Jesus of glorifying Himself in that He said to the multitude,
“I am the path and the gate to salvation,” and even called Himself the
life and the resurrection.</p>
<p>But Jesus was not claiming more than the month of May claims in her
high tide.</p>
<p>Was He not to tell the shining truth because it was so shining?</p>
<p>He indeed said that He was the way and the life and the resurrection
of the heart; and I myself as a testimony to His truth.</p>
<p>Do you not remember me, Nicodemus, who believed in naught but the
laws and decrees and was in continual subjection to observances?</p>
<p>And behold me now, a man who walks with life and laughs with the sun
from the first moment it smiles upon the mountain until it yields itself
to bed behind the hills.</p>
<p>Why do you halt before the word salvation? I myself through Him have
attained my salvation.</p>
<p>I care not for what shall befall me tomorrow, for I know that Jesus
quickened my sleep and made my distant dreams my companions and my
road-fellows.</p>
<p>Am I less man because I believe in a greater man?</p>
<p>The barriers of flesh and bone fell down when the Poet of Galilee
spoke to me; and I was held by a spirit, and was lifted to the heights,
and in midair my wings gathered the song of passion.</p>
<p>And when I dismounted from the wind and in the Sanhedrim my pinions
were shorn, even then my ribs, my featherless wings, kept and guarded
the song. And all the poverties of the lowlands cannot rob me of my
treasure.</p>
<p>I have said enough. Let the deaf bury the humming of life in their
dead ears. I am content with the sound of His lyre, which He held and
struck while the hands of His body were nailed and bleeding.</p>
<p>JOSEPH OF ARIMETHEA</p>
<p>The Two Streams in Jesus’ Heart</p>
<p>There were two streams running in the heart of the Nazarene: the
stream of kinship to God whom He called Father, and the stream of
rapture which He called the kingdom of the Above-world.</p>
<p>And in my solitude I thought of Him and I followed these two streams
in His heart. Upon the banks of the one I met my own soul; and sometimes
my soul was a beggar and a wanderer, and sometimes it was a princess in
her garden.</p>
<p>Then I followed the other stream in His heart, and on my way I met
one who had been beaten and robbed of his gold, and he was smiling. And
farther on I saw the robber who had robbed him, and there were unshed
tears upon his face.</p>
<p>Then I heard the murmur of these two streams in my own bosom also,
and I was gladdened.</p>
<p>When I visited Jesus the day before Pontius Pilatus and the elders
laid hands on Him, we talked long, and I asked Him many questions, and
He answered my questionings with graciousness; and when I left Him I
knew He was the Lord and Master of this our earth.</p>
<p>It is long since our cedar tree has fallen, but its fragrance
endures, and will forever seek the four corners of the earth.</p>
<p>GEORGUS OF BEIRUT</p>
<p>On Strangers</p>
<p>He and his friends were in the grove of pines beyond my hedge, and He
was talking to them.</p>
<p>I stood near the hedge and listened. And I knew who He was, for His
fame had reached these shores ere He Himself visited them.</p>
<p>When He ceased speaking I approached Him, and I said, “Sir, come with
these men and honour me and my roof.”</p>
<p>And He smiled upon me and said, “Not this day, my friend. Not this
day.”</p>
<p>And there was a blessing in His words, and His voice enfolded me like
a garment on a cold night.</p>
<p>Then He turned to His friends and said, “Behold a man who deems us
not strangers, and though He has not seen us ere this day, he bids us to
His threshold.</p>
<p>“Verily in my kingdom there are no strangers. Our life is but the
life of all other men, given us that we may know all men, and in that
knowledge love them.</p>
<p>“The deeds of all men are but our deeds, both the hidden and the
revealed.</p>
<p>“I charge you not to be one self but rather many selves, the
householder and the homeless, the ploughman and the sparrow that picks
the grain ere it slumber in the earth, the giver who gives in gratitude,
and the receiver who receives in pride and recognition.</p>
<p>“The beauty of the day is not only in what you see, but in what other
men see.</p>
<p>“For this I have chosen you from among the many who have chosen
me.”</p>
<p>Then He turned to me again and smiled and said, “I say these things
to you also, and you also shall remember them.”</p>
<p>Then I entreated Him and said, “Master, will you not visit in my
house?”</p>
<p>And He answered, “I know your heart, and I have visited your larger
house.”</p>
<p>And as He walked away with His disciples He said, “Good-night, and
may your house be large enough to shelter all the wanderers of the
land.”</p>
<p>MARY MAGDALENE</p>
<p>His Mouth was like the Heart of a Pomegranate</p>
<p>His mouth was like the heart of a pomegranate, and the shadows in His
eyes were deep.</p>
<p>And He was gentle, like a man mindful of his own strength.</p>
<p>In my dreams I beheld the kings of the earth standing in awe in His
presence.</p>
<p>I would speak of His face, but how shall I?</p>
<p>It was like night without darkness, and like day without the noise of
day.</p>
<p>It was a sad face, and it was a joyous face.</p>
<p>And well I remember how once He raised His hand towards the sky, and
His parted fingers were like the branches of an elm.</p>
<p>And I remember Him pacing the evening. He was not walking. He Himself
was a road above the road; even as a cloud above the earth that would
descend to refresh the earth.</p>
<p>But when I stood before Him and spoke to him, He was a man, and His
face was powerful to behold. And He said to me, “What would you,
Miriam?”</p>
<p>I would not answer Him, but my wings enfolded my secret, and I was
made warm.</p>
<p>And because I could bear His light no more, I turned and walked away,
but not in shame. I was only shy, and I would be alone, with His fingers
upon the strings of my heart.</p>
<p>JOTHAM OF NAZARETH TO A ROMAN</p>
<p>On Living and Being</p>
<p>My friend, you like all other Romans would conceive life rather than
live it. You would rule lands rather than be ruled by the spirit.</p>
<p>You would conquer races and be cursed by them rather than stay in
Rome and be blest and happy.</p>
<p>You think but of armies marching and of ships launched into the
sea.</p>
<p>How shall you then understand Jesus of Nazareth, a man simple and
alone, who came without armies or ships, to establish a kingdom in the
heart and an empire in the free spaces of the soul?</p>
<p>How shall you understand the man who was not a warrior, but who came
with the power of the mighty ether?</p>
<p>He was not a god, He was a man like unto ourselves; but in Him the
myrrh of the earth rose to meet the frankincense of the sky; and in His
words our lisping embraced the whispering of the unseen; and in His
voice we heard a song unfathomable.</p>
<p>Aye, Jesus was a man and not a god, and therein lies our wonder and
our surprise.</p>
<p>But you Romans wonder not save at the gods, and no man shall surprise
you. Therefore you understand not the Nazarene.</p>
<p>He belonged to the youth of the mind and you belong to its old
age.</p>
<p>You govern us today; but let us wait another day.</p>
<p>Who knows that this man with neither armies nor ships shall govern
tomorrow?</p>
<p>We who follow the spirit shall sweat blood while journeying after
Him. But Rome shall lie a white skeleton in the sun.</p>
<p>We shall suffer much, yet we shall endure and we shall live. But Rome
must needs fall into the dust.</p>
<p>Yet if Rome, when humbled and made low, shall pronounce His name, He
will heed her voice. And He will breathe new life into her bones that
she may rise again, a city among the cities of the earth.</p>
<p>But this He shall do without legions, nor with slaves to oar His
galleys. He will be alone.</p>
<p>EPHRAIM OF JERICHO</p>
<p>The Other Wedding-Feast</p>
<p>When he came again to Jericho I sought Him out and said to Him,
“Master, on the morrow my son will take a wife. I beg you come to the
wedding-feast and do us honour, even as you honoured the wedding at Cana
of Galilee.”</p>
<p>And He answered, “It is true that I was once a guest at a
wedding-feast, but I shall not be a guest again. I am myself now the
Bridegroom.”</p>
<p>And I said, “I entreat you, Master, come to the wedding-feast of my
son.”</p>
<p>And He smiled as though He would rebuke me, and said, “Why do you
entreat me? Have you not wine enough?”</p>
<p>And I said, “My jugs are full, Master; yet I beseech you, come to my
son’s wedding-feast.”</p>
<p>Then He said, “Who knows? I may come, I may surely come, if your
heart is an altar in your temple.”</p>
<p>Upon the morrow my son was married, but Jesus came not to the
wedding-feast. And though we had many guests, I felt that no one had
come.</p>
<p>In very truth, I myself who welcomed the guests, was not there.</p>
<p>Perhaps my heart had not been an altar when I invited Him. Perhaps I
desired another miracle.</p>
<p>BARCA A MERCHANT OF TYRE</p>
<p>On Buying and Selling</p>
<p>I believe that neither the Romans nor the Jews understood Jesus of
Nazareth, nor did His disciples who now preach His name.</p>
<p>The Romans slew Him and that was a blunder. The Galileans would make
a god of Him and that is a mistake.</p>
<p>Jesus was the heart of man.</p>
<p>I have sailed the Seven Seas with my ships, and bartered with kings
and princes and with cheats and the wily in the market-places of distant
cities; but never have I seen a man who understood merchants as He
did.</p>
<p>I heard Him once tell this parable:</p>
<p>“A merchant left his country for a foreign land. He had two servants,
and he gave each a handful of gold, saying: ‘Even as I go abroad, you
also shall go forth and seek profit. Make just exchange, and see that
you serve in giving and taking.’</p>
<p>“And after a year the merchant returned.</p>
<p>“And he asked his two servants what they had done with his gold.</p>
<p>“The first servant said, ‘Behold, Master, I have bought and sold, and
I have gained.’</p>
<p>“And the merchant answered, ‘The gain shall be yours, for you have
done well, and have been faithful to me and to yourself.’</p>
<p>“Then the other servant stood forth and said, ‘Sir, I feared the loss
of your money; and I did not buy nor sell. Behold, it is all here in
this purse.’</p>
<p>“And the merchant took the gold, and said, ‘Little is your faith. To
barter and lose is better than not to go forth. For even as the wind
scatters her seed and waits for the fruit, so must all merchants. It
were fitter for you henceforth to serve others.’ “</p>
<p>When Jesus spoke thus, though He was no merchant, He disclosed the
secret of commerce.</p>
<p>Moreover, His parables often brought to my mind lands more distant
than my journeys, and yet nearer than my house and my goods.</p>
<p>But the young Nazarene was not a god; and it is a pity His followers
seek to make a god of such a sage.</p>
<p>PHUMIAH THE HIGH PRIESTESS OF SIDON</p>
<p>An Invocation</p>
<p>Take your harps and let me sing.</p>
<p>Beat your strings, the silver and the gold;</p>
<p>For I would sing the dauntless Man</p>
<p>Who slew the dragon of the valley,</p>
<p>Then gazed down with pity</p>
<p>Upon the thing He had slain.</p>
<p>Take your harps and sing with me</p>
<p>The lofty Oak upon the height,</p>
<p>The sky-hearted and the ocean-handed Man,</p>
<p>Who kissed the pallid lips of death,</p>
<p>Yet quivers now upon the mouth of life.</p>
<p>Take your harps and let us sing</p>
<p>The fearless Hunter on the hill,</p>
<p>Who marked the beast, and shot His viewless arrow,</p>
<p>And brought the horn and tusk</p>
<p>Down to the earth.</p>
<p>Take your harps and sing with me</p>
<p>The valiant Youth who conquered the mountain cities,</p>
<p>And the cities of the plain that coiled like serpents in the
sand.</p>
<p>He fought not against pygmies but against gods</p>
<p>Who hungered for our flesh and thirsted for our blood.</p>
<p>And like the first Golden Hawk</p>
<p>He would rival only eagles;</p>
<p>For His wings were vast and proud</p>
<p>And would not outwing the less winged.</p>
<p>Take your harps and sing with me</p>
<p>The joyous song of sea and cliff.</p>
<p>The gods are dead,</p>
<p>And they are lying still</p>
<p>In the forgotten isle of a forgotten sea.</p>
<p>And He who slew them sits upon His throne.</p>
<p>He was but a youth.</p>
<p>Spring had not yet given Him full beard,</p>
<p>And His summer was still young in His field.</p>
<p>Take your harps and sing with me</p>
<p>The tempest in the forest</p>
<p>That breaks the dry branch and the leafless twig,</p>
<p>Yet sends the living root to nestle deeper at the breast of
earth.</p>
<p>Take your harps and sing with me</p>
<p>The deathless song of our Beloved.</p>
<p>Nay, my maidens, stay your hands.</p>
<p>Lay by your harps.</p>
<p>We cannot sing Him now.</p>
<p>The faint whisper of our song cannot reach His tempest,</p>
<p>Nor pierce the majesty of His silence.</p>
<p>Lay by your harps and gather close around me,</p>
<p>I would repeat His words to you,</p>
<p>And I would tell you of His deeds,</p>
<p>For the echo of His voice is deeper than our passion.</p>
<p>BENJAMIN THE SCRIBE</p>
<p>Let the Dead Bury Their Dead</p>
<p>It has been said that Jesus was the enemy of Rome and Judea.</p>
<p>But I say that Jesus was the enemy of no man and no race.</p>
<p>I have heard Him say, “The birds of the air and the mountain tops are
not mindful of the serpents in their dark holes.</p>
<p>“Let the dead bury their dead. Be you yourself among the living, and
soar high.”</p>
<p>I was not one of His disciples. I was but one of the many who went
after Him to gaze upon His face.</p>
<p>He looked upon Rome and upon us who are the slaves of Rome, as a
father looks upon his children playing with toys and fighting among
themselves for the larger toy. And He laughed from His height.</p>
<p>He was greater than State and race; He was greater than
revolution.</p>
<p>He was single and alone, and He was an awakening.</p>
<p>He wept all our unshed tears and smiled all our revolts.</p>
<p>We knew it was in His power to be born with all who are not yet born,
and to bid them see, not with their eyes but with His vision.</p>
<p>Jesus was the beginning of a new kingdom upon the earth, and that
kingdom shall remain.</p>
<p>He was the son and the grandson of all the kings who builded the
kingdom of the spirit.</p>
<p>And only the kings of spirit have ruled our world.</p>
