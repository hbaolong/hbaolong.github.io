BACON’S FIRST ALLEGORICAL ROMANCE.</h4>
<p>There is another work which it is impossible not to associate with
this period, and that is John Barclay’s “Argenis.” It is little better
known than is “The French Academy,” and yet Cowper pronounced it the
most amusing romance ever written. Cardinal Richelieu is said to have
been extremely fond of reading it, and to have derived thence many of
his political maxims. It is an allegorical novel. It is proposed now
only to mention some evidence connected with the “Argenis” which
supports the contention that the 1625 English edition contains the
original composition, and that its author was young Francis Bacon.</p>
<p>The first edition of the “Argenis” in Latin was published in 1621.
The authority to the publisher, Nicholas Buon, to print and sell the
“Argenis” is dated the 21st July, 1621, and was signed by Barclay at
Rome. The Royal authority is dated on the 31st August following.</p>
<p>Barclay’s death took place between these dates, on the 12th of
August, at Rome. It is reported that the cause of death was stone, but
in an appreciation of him, published by his friend, Ralph Thorie, his
death is attributed to poison.</p>
<p>The work is an example of the highest type of Latinity. So impressed
was Cowper with its style that he stated that it would not have
dishonoured Tacitus himself. A translation in Spanish was published in
1624, and in Italian in 1629. The Latin version was frequently reprinted
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries — perhaps more
frequently than any other book.</p>
<p>In a letter dated 11th May, 1622, Chamberlain, writing to Carleton,
says: “The King has ordered Ben Jonson to translate the ‘Argenis,’ but
he will not be able to equal the original.” On the 2nd October, 1623,
Ben Jonson entered a translation in Stationers’ Hall, but it was never
published. About that time there was a fire in Jonson’s house, in which
it is said some manuscripts were destroyed; but it is a pure assumption
that the “Argenis” was one of these.</p>
<p>In 1629 an English translation appeared by Sir Robert Le Grys,
Knight, and the verses by Thomas May, Esquire. The title-page bears the
statement: “The prose upon his Majesty’s command.” There is a Clavis
appended, also stated to be “published at his Majesties command.” It was
printed by Felix Kyngston for Richard Mughten and Henry Seile. In the
address to “The understanding Reader” Le Grys says, “What then should I
say? Except it were to entreate thee, that where my English phrase doth
not please thee, thou wilt compare it with the originall Latin and mend
it. Which I doe not speak as thinking it impossible, but as willing to
have it done, for the saving me a labour, who, if his Majesty had not so
much hastened the publishing it, would have reformed some things in it,
that did not give myselfe very full satisfaction.”</p>
<p>In 1622 King James ordered a translation of the “Argenis.” In 162915
Charles I. was so impatient to have a translation that he hastened the
publication, thus preventing the translator from revising his work.
Three years previously, however, in 1625 — if the date may be relied on
— there was published as printed by G. P. for Henry Seile a translation
by Kingesmill Long. James died on the 25th March, 1625. The “Argenis”
may not have been published in his lifetime; but if the date be correct,
three or four years before Charles hastened the publication of Le Grys’s
translation, this far superior one with Kingesmill Long’s name attached
to it could have been obtained from H. Seile. Surely the publisher would
have satisfied the King’s impatience by supplying him with a copy of the
1625 edition had it been on sale. The publication of a translation of
the “Argenis” must have attracted attention. Is it possible that it
could have been in existence and not brought to the notice of the King?
There is something here that requires explanation. The Epistle
Dedicatorie of the 1625 edition is written in the familiar style of
another pen, although it bears the name of Kingesmill Long. The
title-page states that it is “faithfully translated out of Latine into
English,” but it is not directly in the Epistle Dedicatorie spoken of as
a translation. The following extract implies that the work had been
lying for years waiting publication: —</p>
<p>“This rude piece, such as it is, hath long lyen by me, since it was
finished; I not thinking it worthy to see the light. I had always a
desire and hope to have it undertaken by a more able workman, that our
Nation might not be deprived of the use of so excellent a Story: But
finding none in so long time to have done it; and knowing that it spake
not English, though it were a rich jewell to the learned Linguist, yet
it was close lockt from all those, to whom education had not given more
languages, than Nature Tongues: I have adventured to become the key to
this piece of hidden Treasure, and have suffered myselfe to be overruled
by some of my worthy friends, whose judgements I have alwayes esteemed,
sending it abroad (though coursely done) for the delight and use of
others.”</p>
<p>Not a word about the author! The translations, said to be by Thomas
May, of the Latin verses in the 1629 are identical with those in the
1625 edition, although Kingesmill Long, on the title-page, appears as
the translator. Nothing can be learnt as to who or what Long was.</p>
<p>Over lines “Authori,” signed Ovv: Fell:16 in the 1625 edition is one
of the well-known light and dark A devices. This work is written in
flowing and majestic English; the 1629 edition in the cramped style of
translation.</p>
<p>The copy bearing date 1628, to which reference has been made,
belonged to John Henry Shorthouse. He has made this note on the front
page: “Jno. Barclay’s description of himself under the person of
Nicopompus Argenis, p. 60.” This is the description to which he alludes:
—</p>
<p>“Him thus boldly talking, Nicopompus could no longer endure: he was a
man who from his infancy loved Learning; but who disdaining to be
nothing but a booke-man had left the schooles very young, that in the
courts of Kings and Princes, he might serve his apprenticeship in
publicke affairs; so he grew there with an equall abilitie, both in
learning and imployment, his descent and disposition fitting him for
that kind of life: wel esteemed of many Princes, and especially of
Meleander, whose cause together with the rest of the Princes, he had
taken upon him to defend.”</p>
<p>This description is inaccurate as applied to John Barclay, but in
every detail it describes Francis Bacon.</p>
<p>A comparison has been made between the editions of 1625 and 1629 with
the 1621 Latin edition. It leaves little room for doubting that the 1625
is the original work. Throughout the Latin appears to follow it rather
than to be the leader; whilst the 1629 edition follows the Latin
closely. In some cases the word used in the 1625 edition has been
incorrectly translated into the 1621 edition, and the Latin word
re-translated literally and incorrectly in view of the sense in the 1629
edition. But space forbids this comparison being further followed;
suffice it to say that everything points to the 1625 edition being the
original work.</p>
<p>As to the date of composition much may be said; but the present
contention is that “The French Academie,” “The Argenis,” and “Love’s
Labour’s Lost” are productions from the same pen, and that they all
represent the work of Francis Bacon probably between the years 1577 and
1580. At any rate, the first-named was written whilst he was in France,
and the others were founded on the incidents and experience obtained
during his sojourn there.</p>
