PHILOSOPHY OF BACON.</h4>
<p>APPENDIX.</p>
<p>ROBERT BANKS AND SON, RACQUET COURT, FLEET STREET.</p>
<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>Is there a mystery connected with the life of Francis Bacon? The
average student of history or literature will unhesitatingly reply in
the negative, perhaps qualifying his answer by adding: — Unless it be a
mystery that a man with such magnificent intellectual attainments could
have fallen so low as to prove a faithless friend to a generous
benefactor in the hour of his trial, and, upon being raised to one of
the highest positions of honour and influence in the State, to become a
corrupt public servant and a receiver of bribes to pervert justice. — It
is one of the most remarkable circumstances to be found in the history
of any country that a man admittedly pre-eminent in his intellectual
powers, spoken of by his contemporaries in the highest terms for his
virtues and his goodness, should, in subsequent ages, be held up to
obloquy and scorn and seldom be referred to except as an example of a
corrupt judge, a standing warning to those who must take heed how they
stand lest they fall. Truly the treatment which Francis Bacon has
received confirms the truth of the aphorism, “The evil that men do lives
after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.”</p>
<p>It is not the intention in the following brief survey of Bacon’s life
to enter upon any attempt to vindicate his character. Since his works
and life have come prominently before the reading public, he has never
been without a defender. Montagu, Hepworth Dixon, and Spedding have, one
after the other, raised their voices against the injustice which has
been done to the memory of this great Englishman; and although Macaulay,
in his misleading and inaccurate essay,1 abounding in paradoxes and
inconsistencies, produced the most powerful, though prejudiced, attack
which has been made on Bacon’s fame, he may almost be forgiven, because
it provided the occasion for James Spedding in “Evenings with a
Reviewer,” to respond with a thorough and complete vindication of the
man to whose memory he devoted his life. There rests on every member of
the Anglo-Saxon race an obligation — imposed upon him by the benefits
which he enjoys as the result of Francis Bacon’s life-work — to read
this vindication of his character. Nor should mention be omitted of the
essay by Mr. J. M. Robertson on “Francis Bacon” in his excellent work
“Pioneer Humanists.” All these defenders of Bacon treat their subject
from what may be termed the orthodox point of view. They follow in the
beaten track. They do not look for Bacon outside his acknowledged works
and letters. Since 1857, however, there has been steadily growing a
belief that Bacon was associated with the literature of the Elizabethan
and early Jacobean periods, and that he deliberately concealed his
connection with it. That this view is scouted by what are termed the men
of letters is well-known. They will have none of it. They refuse its
claim to a rational hearing. But, in spite of this, as years go on, the
number of adherents to the new theory steadily increases. The scornful
epithets that are hurled at them only appear to whet their appetite, and
increase their determination. Men and women devote their lives with
enthusiasm to the quest for further knowledge. They dig and delve in the
records of the period, and in the byeways of literature. Theories which
appear extravagant and untenable are propounded. Whether any of these
theories will come to be accepted and established beyond cavil, time
alone can prove. But, at any rate, it is certain that in this quest many
forgotten facts are brought to light, and the general stock of
information as to the literature of the period is augmented.</p>
<p>In the following pages it is sought to establish what may be termed
one of these extravagant theories. How far this attempt is successful,
it is for the reader to judge. Notwithstanding all that may be said to
the contrary, by far the greater part of Francis Bacon’s life is
unknown. An attempt will be made by the aid of accredited documents and
books to represent in a new light his youth and early manhood. It is
contended that he deliberately sought to conceal his movements and work,
although, at the same time, he left the landmarks by which a diligent
student might follow them. In his youth he conceived the idea that the
man Francis Bacon should be concealed, and be revealed only by his
works. The motto, “Mente videbor” — by the mind I shall be seen — became
the guiding principle of his life.</p>
