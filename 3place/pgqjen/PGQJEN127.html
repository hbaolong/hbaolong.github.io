<h4 id="chapter-xiv.">CHAPTER XIV.</h4>
<p>Postscriptum.</p>
<p>Most fortunately before going to press we were able to see at the
Record Office, Chancery Lane, London, the revealing documents recently
discovered by Dr. Wallace and described by him in an article published
in the March number of Harper’s Monthly Magazine, under the title of
“New Shakespeare Discoveries.” The documents found by Dr. Wallace are
extremely valuable and important. They tell us a few real facts about
the Householder of Stratford-upon-Avon, and they effectually once and
for all dispose of the idea that the Stratford man was the Poet and
Dramatist, — the greatest genius of all the ages.</p>
<p>In the first place they prove beyond the possibility of cavil or
question that “Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon, Gentleman,” was
totally unable to write even so much as any portion of his own name. It
is true that the Answers to the Interrogatories which are given by
“William Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon, Gentleman,” are marked at
the bottom “Wilm Shaxpr,” but this is written by the lawyer or law
clerk, in fact “dashed in” by the ready pen of an extremely rapid
writer. A full size photographic facsimile of this “so-called”
signature, with a portion of the document above it, is given in Plate
38, Page 164, and on the opposite page, in Plate 39, is shewn also in
full size facsimile the real signature of Daniell Nicholas with a
portion of the document, which he signed, above it.</p>
<p>In order that the reader may be able more easily to read the law
writing we give on page 167, in modern type, the portion of the document
photographed above the name Wilm Shaxp’r, and on the same page a modern
type transcript of the document above the signature of Daniell
Nicholas.</p>
<p>Any expert in handwriting will at once perceive that “Wilm Shaxp’r”
is written by the same hand that wrote the lower portion of
Shakespeare’s Answers to Interrogatories, and by the same hand that
wrote the other set of Answers to Interrogatories which are signed very
neatly by “Daniell Nicholas.”</p>
<p>The words “Daughter Marye” occur in the portion photographed of both
documents, and are evidently written by the same law writer, and can be
seen in Plate 38, Page 164, just above the “Wilm Shaxp’r,” and in Plate
39, Page 165, upon the fifth line from the top. The name of
“Shakespeare” also occurs several times in the “Answers to
Interrogatories.” One instance occurs in Plate 39, Page 165, eight lines
above the name of Daniell Nicholas, and if the reader compares it with
the “Wilm Shaxp’r” on Plate 38, Page 164, it will be at once seen that
both writings are by the same hand.</p>
<p>portion What c’tayne he . . . . . . . plt twoe hundered pounds
decease. But sayth that his house. And they had amo about their
marriadge w’ch nized. And more he can ponnt saythe he can saye of the
same Interro for cessaries of houshould stuffe his daughter Marye WILM
SHAXPR</p>
<p>TYPE FACSIMILE OF PLATE XXXVIII.</p>
<hr />
<p>Interr this depnnt sayth that the deft did beare ted him well when he
by him the said Shakespeare his daughter Marye that purpose sent him
swade the plt to the solempnised uppon pmise of nnt. And more he can
this deponnt sayth is deponnt to goe wth DANIELL NICHOLAS.</p>
<p>TYPE FACSIMILE OF PLATE XXXIX.</p>
<p>Answers to Interrogatories are required to be signed by the
deponents. In the case of “Johane Johnsone,” who could not write her
name, the depositions are signed with a very neat cross which was her
mark. In the case of “William Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon,
Gentleman,” who was also unable to write his name, they are signed with
a dot which might quite easily be mistaken for an accidental blot. Our
readers will see this mark, which is not a blot but a purposely made
mark, just under “Wilm Shaxp’r.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace reads the “so-called” signature as Willm Shaks, but the
Christian name is written quite clearly Wilm. And we should have
supposed that any one possessing even the smallest acquaintance with the
law writing of the period must have known that the scroll which looks
like a flourish at the end of the surname is not and cannot be an “s,”
but is most certainly without any possibility of question a “p,” and
that the dash through the “p” is the usual and accepted abbreviation for
words ending in “per,” or “peare,” etc.12</p>
<p>Then how ought we, nay how arewe, compelled to read the so-called
signature? The capital S is quite clear, so also is the “h,” then the
next mass of strokes all go to make up simply the letter “a.” Then we
come to the blotted letter,</p>
<p>this is not and cannot be “kes” or “ks” because in the law writing of
the period every letter “s” (excepting “s” at the end of a word) was
written as a very long letter. This may readily be seen in the word
Shakespeare which occurs in Plate 39 on the eighth line above the
signature of Daniell Nicholas. What then is this blotted letter if it is
not kes or ks? The answer is quite plain, it is an “X,” and a careful
examination under a very strong magnifying glass will satisfy the
student that it is without possibility of question correctly described
as an “X.”13 Yes, the lawclerk marked the Stratford Gentleman’s “Answers
to Interrogatories” with the name “Wilm Shaxp’r.” Does there exist a
Stratfordian who will contend that William Shakespeare, of
Stratford-upon-Avon, Gentleman, if he had been able to write any portion
of his name would have marked his depositions Wilm Shaxp’r? Does there
exist any man who will venture to contend that the great Dramatist, the
author of the Immortal plays, would or could have so signed his name? We
trow not; indeed, such an abbreviation would be impossible in a legal
document in a Court of Law where depositions are required to be signed
in full.</p>
<p>With reference to the other so-called Shakespeare’s signatures we
must refer the reader to our Chapter III. which was penned before these
“New Shakespeare Discoveries” were announced. And it is perhaps
desirable to say that the dot in the “W” which appears in two of those
“so-called” signatures of Shakespeare, and also in the one just
discovered, is part of the regular method of writing a “W” in the law
writing of the period. In the Purchase Deed of the property in
Blackfriars, of March 10th 1612-13, mentioned on page 38, there are in
the first six lines of the Deed seven “W’s,” in each of which appears a
dot. And in the Mortgage Deed of March 11th 1612-13, there are seven
“W’s” in the first five lines, in each of which appears a similar dot.
The above-mentioned two Deeds are in the handwriting of different law
clerks.</p>
<p>It may not be out of place here again to call our readers’ attention
to the fact that law documents are required to be signed “in full,” and
that if the very rapid and ready writer who wrote “Wilm Shaxp’r” were
indeed the Gentleman of Stratford it would have been quite easy for such
a good penman to have written his name in full; this the law writer has
not done because he did not desire to forge a signature to the document,
but desired only to indicate by an abbreviation that the dot or spot
below was the mark of William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>
<p>Thus the question, whether William Shakespeare, of
Stratford-upon-Avon, Gentleman, could or could not write his name is for
ever settled in the negative, and there is no doubt, there can be no
doubt, upon this matter.</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace declares “I have had no theory to defend and no
hypothesis to propose.” But as a matter of fact his whole article
falsely assumes that “William Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon,
Gentleman,” who is referred to in the documents, is no other than the
great Dramatist who wrote the Immortal plays. And the writer can only
express his unbounded wonder and astonishment that even so ardent a
Stratfordian as Dr. Wallace, after studying the various documents which
he discovered, should have ventured to say:</p>
<p>“Shakespeare was the third witness examined. Although, forsooth, the
matter of his statements is of no high literary quality and the manner
is lacking in imagination and style, as the Rev. Joseph Green in 1747
complained of the will, we feel none the less as we hear him talk that
we have for the first time met Shakespeare in the flesh and that the
acquaintance is good.”</p>
<p>As a matter of fact none of the words of any of the deponents are
their own words, but they are the words of the lawyers who drew the
Answers to the Interrogatories. The present writer, when a pupil in the
chambers of a distinguished lawyer who afterwards became a Lord Justice,
saw any number of Interrogatories and Answers to Interrogatories, and
even assisted in their preparation. The last thing that any one of the
pupils thought of, was in what manner the client would desire to express
his own views. They drew the most plausible Answers they could imagine,
taking care that their words were sufficiently near to the actual facts
for the client to be able to swear to them.</p>
<p>The so-called signature “Wilm Shaxp’r,” is written by the lawyer or
law clerk who wrote the lower part of Shakespeare’s depositions, and
this same clerk also wrote the depositions above the name of another
witness who really signs his own name, viz., “Daniell Nicholas.” The
only mark William Shakespeare put to the document was the blot above
which the abbreviated name “Wilm Shaxp’r” was written by the lawyer or
law clerk.</p>
<p>The documents shew that Shakespeare of Stratford occasionally “lay”
in the house in Silver Street, and Ben Jonson’s words in “The Staple of
News” (Third Intermeane; Act iii.), to which Dr. Wallace refers viz.,
that “Siluer-Streete” was “a good seat for a Vsurer” are very informing,
because as we have before pointed out the Stratford man was a cruel
usurer.</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace’s contention that Mountjoy, the wig-maker, of the corner
house in Silver Street where Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon,
Gentleman, occasionally slept, was the original of the name of the
Herald in Henry V.14 really surpasses, in want of knowledge of History,
anything that the writer has ever previously encountered, and he is
afraid that it really is a measure of the value of Dr. Wallace’s other
inferences connecting the illiterate Stratford Rustic with the great
Dramatist who “took all knowledge for his province.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace’s “New Shakespeare Discoveries” are really extremely
valuable and informing, and very greatly assist the statements which the
writer has made in the previous chapters, viz., that the Stratford
Householder was a mean Rustic who was totally unable to read or to
write, and was not even an actor of repute, but was a mere hanger-on at
the Theatre. Indeed, the more these important documents are examined the
clearer it will be perceived that, as Dr. Wallace points out, they shew
us that the real William Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon, gentleman,
was not the “Aristocrat,” whom Tolstoi declares the author of the plays
to have been, but was in fact a man who resided [occasionally when he
happened to revisit London] “in a hardworking family,” a man who was
familiar with hairdressers and their apprentices, a man who mixed as an
equal among tradesmen in a humble position of life, who referred to him
as “One Shakespeare.” These documents prove that “One Shakespeare” was
not and could not have been the “poet and dramatist.” In a word these
documents strongly confirm the fact that</p>
<p>BACON IS SHAKESPEARE.</p>
