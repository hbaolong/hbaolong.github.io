<p>BACON’S PHILOSOPHY.</p>
<p>Bacon was one of those men to whom posterity forgives a great deal
for the greatness of what he has done and attempted for posterity. It is
idle, unless all honest judgment is foregone, to disguise the many
deplorable shortcomings of his life; it is unjust to have one measure
for him, and another for those about him and opposed to him. But it is
not too much to say that in temper, in honesty, in labour, in humility,
in reverence, he was the most perfect example that the world had yet
seen of the student of nature, the enthusiast for knowledge. That such a
man was tempted and fell, and suffered the Nemesis of his fall, is an
instance of the awful truth embodied in the tragedy of Faust. But his
genuine devotion, so unwearied and so paramount, to a great idea and a
great purpose for the good of all generations to come, must shield him
from the insult of Pope’s famous and shallow epigram. Whatever may have
been his sins, and they were many, he cannot have been the “meanest of
mankind,” who lived and died, holding unaltered, amid temptations and
falls, so noble a conception of the use and calling of his life: the
duty and service of helping his brethren to know as they had never yet
learned to know. That thought never left him; the obligations it imposed
were never forgotten in the crush and heat of business; the toils,
thankless at the time, which it heaped upon him in addition to the
burdens of public life were never refused. Nothing diverted him, nothing
made him despair. He was not discouraged because he was not understood.
There never was any one in whose life the “Souveraineté du but” was more
certain and more apparent; and that object was the second greatest that
man can have. To teach men to know is only next to making them good.</p>
<p>The Baconian philosophy, the reforms of the Novum Organum, the method
of experiment and induction, are commonplaces, and sometimes lead to a
misconception of what Bacon did. Bacon is, and is not, the founder of
modern science. What Bacon believed could be done, what he hoped and
divined, for the correction and development of human knowledge, was one
thing; what his methods were, and how far they were successful, is
another. It would hardly be untrue to say that though Bacon is the
parent of modern science, his methods contributed nothing to its actual
discoveries; neither by possibility could they have done so. The great
and wonderful work which the world owes to him was in the idea, and not
in the execution. The idea was that the systematic and wide examination
of facts was the first thing to be done in science, and that till this
had been done faithfully and impartially, with all the appliances and
all the safeguards that experience and forethought could suggest, all
generalisations, all anticipations from mere reasoning, must be
adjourned and postponed; and further, that sought on these conditions,
knowledge, certain and fruitful, beyond all that men then imagined,
could be attained. His was the faith of the discoverer, the imagination
of the poet, the voice of the prophet. But his was not the warrior’s
arm, the engineer’s skill, the architect’s creativeness. “I only sound
the clarion,” he says, “but I enter not into the battle;” and with a
Greek quotation very rare with him, he compares himself to one of
Homer’s peaceful heralds, χαίρετε κήρυκες, Δίος ἄγγελοι ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν.
Even he knew not the full greatness of his own enterprise. He underrated
the vastness and the subtlety of nature. He overrated his own appliances
to bring it under his command. He had not that incommunicable genius and
instinct of the investigator which in such men as Faraday close hand to
hand with phenomena. His weapons and instruments wanted precision; they
were powerful up to a certain point, but they had the clumsiness of an
unpractised time. Cowley compared him to Moses on Pisgah surveying the
promised land; it was but a distant survey, and Newton was the Joshua
who began to take possession of it.</p>
<p>The idea of the great enterprise, in its essential outline, and with
a full sense of its originality and importance, was early formed, and
was even sketched on paper with Bacon’s characteristic self-reliance
when he was but twenty-five. Looking back, in a letter written in the
last year of his life, on the ardour and constancy with which he had
clung to his faith— “in that purpose my mind never waxed old; in that
long interval of time it never cooled” — he remarks that it was then
“forty years since he put together a youthful essay on these matters,
which with vast confidence I called by the high-sounding title, The
Greatest Birth of Time.” “The Greatest Birth of Time,” whatever it was,
has perished, though the name, altered to “Partus Temporis Masculus” has
survived, attached to some fragments of uncertain date and arrangement.
But in very truth the child was born, and, as Bacon says, for forty
years grew and developed, with many changes yet the same. Bacon was most
tenacious, not only of ideas, but even of the phrases, images, and turns
of speech in which they had once flashed on him and taken shape in his
mind. The features of his undertaking remained the same from first to
last, only expanded and enlarged as time went on and experience widened;
his conviction that the knowledge of nature, and with it the power to
command and to employ nature, were within the capacity of mankind and
might be restored to them; the certainty that of this knowledge men had
as yet acquired but the most insignificant part, and that all existing
claims to philosophical truth were as idle and precarious as the guesses
and traditions of the vulgar; his belief that no greater object could be
aimed at than to sweep away once and for ever all this sham knowledge
and all that supported it, and to lay an entirely new and clear
foundation to build on for the future; his assurance that, as it was
easy to point out with fatal and luminous certainty the rottenness and
hollowness of all existing knowledge and philosophy, so it was equally
easy to devise and practically apply new and natural methods of
investigation and construction, which should replace it by knowledge of
infallible truth and boundless fruitfulness. His object — to gain the
key to the interpretation of nature; his method — to gain it, not by the
means common to all previous schools of philosophy, by untested
reasonings and imposing and high-sounding generalisations, but by a
series and scale of rigorously verified inductions, starting from the
lowest facts of experience to discoveries which should prove and realise
themselves by leading deductively to practical results — these, in one
form or another, were the theme of his philosophical writings from the
earliest sight of them that we gain.</p>
<p>He had disclosed what was in his mind in the letter to Lord Burghley,
written when he was thirty-one (1590/91), in which he announced that he
had “taken all knowledge for his province,” to “purge it of ‘frivolous
disputations’ and ‘blind experiments,’ and that whatever happened to
him, he meant to be a ‘true pioneer in the mine of truth.’” But the
first public step in the opening of his great design was the publication
in the autumn of 1605 of the Advancement of Learning, a careful and
balanced report on the existing stock and deficiencies of human
knowledge. His endeavours, as he says in the Advancement itself, are
“but as an image in a cross-way, that may point out the way, but cannot
go it.” But from this image of his purpose, his thoughts greatly widened
as time went on. The Advancement, in part at least, was probably a
hurried work. It shadowed out, but only shadowed out, the lines of his
proposed reform of philosophical thought; it showed his dissatisfaction
with much that was held to be sound and complete, and showed the
direction of his ideas and hopes. But it was many years before he took a
further step. Active life intervened. In 1620, at the height of his
prosperity, on the eve of his fall, he published the long meditated
Novum Organum, the avowed challenge to the old philosophies, the engine
and instrument of thought and discovery which was to put to shame and
supersede all others, containing, in part at least, the principles of
that new method of the use of experience which was to be the key to the
interpretation and command of nature, and, together with the method, an
elaborate but incomplete exemplification of its leading processes. Here
were summed up, and stated with the most solemn earnestness, the
conclusions to which long study and continual familiarity with the
matters in question had led him. And with the Novum Organum was at
length disclosed, though only in outline, the whole of the vast scheme
in all its parts, object, method, materials, results, for the
“Instauration” of human knowledge, the restoration of powers lost,
disused, neglected, latent, but recoverable by honesty, patience,
courage, and industry.</p>
<p>The Instauratio, as he planned the work, “is to be divided,” says
Mr. Ellis, “into six portions, of which the first is to contain a
general survey of the present state of knowledge. In the second, men are
to be taught how to use their understanding aright in the investigation
of nature. In the third, all the phenomena of the universe are to be
stored up as in a treasure-house, as the materials on which the new
method is to be employed. In the fourth, examples are to be given of its
operation and of the results to which it leads. The fifth is to contain
what Bacon had accomplished in natural philosophy without the aid of his
own method, ex eodem intellectûs usu quem alii in inquirendo et
inveniendo adhibere consueverunt. It is therefore less important than
the rest, and Bacon declares that he will not bind himself to the
conclusions which it contains. Moreover, its value will altogether cease
when the sixth part can be completed, wherein will be set forth the new
philosophy — the results of the application of the new method to all the
phenomena of the universe. But to complete this, the last part of the
Instauratio, Bacon does not hope; he speaks of it as a thing, et supra
vires et ultra spes nostras collocata.” — Works, i. 71.</p>
<p>The Novum Organum, itself imperfect, was the crown of all that he
lived to do. It was followed (1622) by the publication, intended to be
periodical, of materials for the new philosophy to work upon, particular
sections and classes of observations on phenomena — the History of the
Winds, the History of Life and Death. Others were partly prepared but
not published by him. And finally, in 1623, he brought out in Latin a
greatly enlarged recasting of the Advancement; the nine books of the “De
Augmentis.” But the great scheme was not completed; portions were left
more or less finished. Much that he purposed was left undone, and could
not have been yet done at that time.</p>
<p>But the works which he published represent imperfectly the labour
spent on the undertaking. Besides these there remains a vast amount of
unused or rejected work, which shows how it was thought out, rearranged,
tried first in one fashion and then in another, recast, developed.
Separate chapters, introductions, “experimental essays and discarded
beginnings,” treatises with picturesque and imaginative titles,
succeeded one another in that busy work-shop; and these first drafts and
tentative essays have in them some of the freshest and most felicitous
forms of his thoughts. At one time his enterprise, connecting itself
with his own life and mission, rose before his imagination and kindled
his feelings, and embodied itself in the lofty and stately “Proem”
already quoted. His quick and brilliant imagination saw shadows and
figures of his ideas in the ancient mythology, which he worked out with
curious ingenuity and often much poetry in his Wisdom of the Ancients.
Towards the end of his life he began to embody his thoughts and plans in
a philosophical tale, which he did not finish — the New Atlantis — a
charming example of his graceful fancy and of his power of easy and
natural story-telling. Between the Advancement and the Novum Organum
(1605-20) much underground work had been done. “He had finally (about
1607) settled the plan of the Great Instauration, and began to call it
by that name.” The plan, first in three or four divisions, had been
finally digested into six. Vague outlines had become definite and clear.
Distinct portions had been worked out. Various modes of treatment had
been tried, abandoned, modified. Prefaces were written to give the
sketch and purpose of chapters not yet composed. The Novum Organum had
been written and rewritten twelve times over. Bacon kept his papers, and
we can trace in the unused portion of those left behind him much of the
progress of his work, and the shapes which much of it went through. The
Advancement itself is the filling-out and perfecting of what is found in
germ, meagre and rudimentary, in a Discourse in Praise of Knowledge,
written in the days of Elizabeth, and in some Latin chapters of an early
date, the Cogitationes de Scientia Humana, on the limits and use of
knowledge, and on the relation of natural history to natural philosophy.
These early essays, with much of the same characteristic illustration,
and many of the favourite images and maxims and texts and phrases, which
continue to appear in his writings to the end, contain the thoughts of a
man long accustomed to meditate and to see his way on the new aspects of
knowledge opening upon him. And before the Advancement he had already
tried his hand on a work intended to be in two books, which Mr. Ellis
describes as a “great work on the Interpretation of Nature,” the
“earliest type of the Instauratio,” and which Bacon called by the
enigmatical name of Valerius Terminus. In it, as in a second draft,
which in its turn was superseded by the Advancement, the line of thought
of the Latin Cogitationes reappears, expanded and more carefully
ordered; it contains also the first sketch of his certain and infallible
method for what he calls the “freeing of the direction” in the search
after Truth, and the first indications of the four classes of “Idols”
which were to be so memorable a portion of Bacon’s teaching. And between
the Advancement and the Novum Organum at least one unpublished treatise
of great interest intervened, the Visa et Cogitata, on which he was long
employed, and which he brought to a finished shape, fit to be submitted
to his friends and critics, Sir Thomas Bodley and Bishop Andrewes. It is
spoken of as a book to be “imparted sicut videbitur,” in the review
which he made of his life and objects soon after he was made Solicitor
in 1608. A number of fragments also bear witness to the fierce scorn and
wrath which possessed him against the older and the received
philosophies. He tried his hand at declamatory onslaughts on the leaders
of human wisdom, from the early Greeks and Aristotle down to the latest
“novellists;” and he certainly succeeded in being magnificently abusive.
But he thought wisely that this was not the best way of doing what in
the Commentarius Solutus he calls on himself to do— “taking a greater
confidence and authority in discourses of this nature, tanquam sui
certus et de alto despiciens;” and the rhetorical Redargutio
Philosophiarum and writings of kindred nature were laid aside by his
more serious judgment. But all these fragments witness to the immense
and unwearied labour bestowed in the midst of a busy life on his
undertaking; they suggest, too, the suspicion that there was much waste
from interruption, and the doubt whether his work would not have been
better if it could have been more steadily continuous. But if ever a man
had a great object in life, and pursued it through good and evil report,
through ardent hope and keen disappointment, to the end, with unwearied
patience and unshaken faith, it was Bacon, when he sought the
improvement of human knowledge “for the glory of God and the relief of
man’s estate.” It is not the least part of the pathetic fortune of his
life that his own success was so imperfect.</p>
<p>When a reader first comes from the vague, popular notions of Bacon’s
work to his definite proposals the effect is startling. Every one has
heard that he contemplated a complete reform of the existing conceptions
of human knowledge, and of the methods by which knowledge was to be
sought; that rejecting them as vitiated, by the loose and untested way
in which they had been formed, he called men from verbal generalisations
and unproved assumptions to come down face to face with the realities of
experience; that he substituted for formal reasoning, from baseless
premises and unmeaning principles, a methodical system of cautious and
sifting inference from wide observation and experiment; and that he thus
opened the path which modern science thenceforth followed, with its
amazing and unexhausted discoveries, and its vast and beneficent
practical results. We credit all this to Bacon, and assuredly not
without reason. All this is what was embraced in his vision of a changed
world of thought and achievement. All this is what was meant by that
Regnum Hominis, which, with a play on sacred words which his age did not
shrink from, and which he especially pleased himself with, marked the
coming of that hitherto unimagined empire of man over the powers and
forces which encompassed him. But the detail of all this is multifarious
and complicated, and is not always what we expect; and when we come to
see how his work is estimated by those who, by greatest familiarity with
scientific ideas and the history of scientific inquiries, are best
fitted to judge of it, many a surprise awaits us.</p>
<p>For we find that the greatest differences of opinion exist on the
value of what he did. Not only very unfavourable judgments have been
passed upon it, on general grounds — as an irreligious, or a shallow and
one-sided, or a poor and “utilitarian” philosophy, and on a definite
comparison of it with the actual methods and processes which as a matter
of history have been the real means of scientific discovery — but also
some of those who have most admired his genius, and with the deepest
love and reverence have spared no pains to do it full justice, have yet
come to the conclusion that as an instrument and real method of work
Bacon’s attempt was a failure. It is not only De Maistre and Lord
Macaulay who dispute his philosophical eminence. It is not only the
depreciating opinion of a contemporary like Harvey, who was actually
doing what Bacon was writing about. It is not only that men who after
the long history of modern science have won their place among its
leaders, and are familiar by daily experience with the ways in which it
works — a chemist like Liebig, a physiologist like Claude Bernard — say
that they can find nothing to help them in Bacon’s methods. It is not
only that a clear and exact critic like M. de Rémusat looks at his
attempt, with its success and failure, as characteristic of English,
massive, practical good sense rather than as marked by real
philosophical depth and refinement, such as Continental thinkers point
to and are proud of in Descartes and Leibnitz. It is not even that a
competent master of the whole domain of knowledge, Whewell, filled with
the deepest sense of all that the world owes to Bacon, takes for granted
that “though Bacon’s general maxims are sagacious and animating, his
particular precepts failed in his hands, and are now practically
useless;” and assuming that Bacon’s method is not the right one, and not
complete as far as the progress of science up to his time could direct
it, proceeds to construct a Novum Organum Renovatum. But Bacon’s
writings have recently undergone the closest examination by two editors,
whose care for his memory is as loyal and affectionate as their capacity
is undoubted, and their willingness to take trouble boundless. And
Mr. Ellis and Mr. Spedding, with all their interest in every detail of
Bacon’s work, and admiration of the way in which he performed it, make
no secret of their conclusion that he failed in the very thing on which
he was most bent — the discovery of practical and fruitful ways of
scientific inquiry. “Bacon,” says Mr. Spedding, “failed to devise a
practicable method for the discovery of the Forms of Nature, because he
misconceived the conditions of the case…. For the same reason he failed
to make any single discovery which holds its place as one of the steps
by which science has in any direction really advanced. The clew with
which he entered the labyrinth did not reach far enough; before he had
nearly attained his end he was obliged either to come back or to go on
without it.”</p>
<p>“His peculiar system of philosophy,” says Mr. Spedding in another
preface, “that is to say, the peculiar method of investigation, the
“organum,” the “formula,” the “clavis,” the “ars ipsa interpretandi
naturam,” the “filum Labyrinthi,” or by whatever of its many names we
choose to call that artificial process by which alone he believed man
could attain a knowledge of the laws and a command over the powers of
nature — of this philosophy we can make nothing. If we have not tried
it, it is because we feel confident that it would not answer. We regard
it as a curious piece of machinery, very subtle, elaborate, and
ingenious, but not worth constructing, because all the work it could do
may be done more easily another way.” — Works, iii. 171.</p>
<p>What his method really was is itself a matter of question. Mr. Ellis
speaks of it as a matter “but imperfectly apprehended.” He differs from
his fellow-labourer Mr. Spedding, in what he supposes to be its central
and characteristic innovation. Mr. Ellis finds it in an improvement and
perfection of logical machinery. Mr. Spedding finds it in the formation
of a great “natural and experimental history,” a vast collection of
facts in every department of nature, which was to be a more important
part of his philosophy than the Novum Organum itself. Both of them think
that as he went on, the difficulties of the work grew upon him, and
caused alterations in his plans, and we are reminded that “there is no
didactic exposition of his method in the whole of his writings,” and
that “this has not been sufficiently remarked by those who have spoken
of his philosophy.”</p>
<p>In the first place, the kind of intellectual instrument which he
proposed to construct was a mistake. His great object was to place the
human mind “on a level with things and nature” (ut faciamus intellectum
humanum rebus et naturæ parem), and this could only be done by a
revolution in methods. The ancients had all that genius could do for
man; but it was a matter, he said, not of the strength and fleetness of
the running, but of the rightness of the way. It was a new method,
absolutely different from anything known, which he proposed to the
world, and which should lead men to knowledge, with the certainty and
with the impartial facility of a high-road. The Induction which he
imagined to himself as the contrast to all that had yet been tried was
to have two qualities. It was to end, by no very prolonged or difficult
processes, in absolute certainty. And next, it was to leave very little
to the differences of intellectual power: it was to level minds and
capacities. It was to give all men the same sort of power which a pair
of compasses gives the hand in drawing a circle. “Absolute certainty,
and a mechanical mode of procedure” says Mr. Ellis, “such that all men
should be capable of employing it, are the two great features of the
Baconian system.” This he thought possible, and this he set himself to
expound— “a method universally applicable, and in all cases infallible.”
In this he saw the novelty and the vast importance of his discovery. “By
this method all the knowledge which the human mind was capable of
receiving might be attained, and attained without unnecessary labour.”
It was a method of “a demonstrative character, with the power of
reducing all minds to nearly the same level.” The conception, indeed, of
a “great Art of knowledge,” of an “Instauration” of the sciences, of a
“Clavis” which should unlock the difficulties which had hindered
discovery, was not a new one. This attempt at a method which should be
certain, which should level capacities, which should do its work in a
short time, had a special attraction for the imagination of the wild
spirits of the South, from Raimond Lulli in the thirteenth century to
the audacious Calabrians of the sixteenth. With Bacon it was something
much more serious and reasonable and business-like. But such a claim has
never yet been verified; there is no reason to think that it ever can
be; and to have made it shows a fundamental defect in Bacon’s conception
of the possibilities of the human mind and the field it has to work
in.</p>
<p>In the next place, though the prominence which he gave to the
doctrine of Induction was one of those novelties which are so obvious
after the event, though so strange before it, and was undoubtedly the
element in his system which gave it life and power and influence on the
course of human thought and discovery, his account of Induction was far
from complete and satisfactory. Without troubling himself about the
theory of Induction, as De Rémusat has pointed out, he contented himself
with applying to its use the precepts of common-sense and a sagacious
perception of the circumstances in which it was to be employed. But even
these precepts, notable as they were, wanted distinctness, and the
qualities needed for working rules. The change is great when in fifty
years we pass from the poetical science of Bacon to the mathematical and
precise science of Newton. His own time may well have been struck by the
originality and comprehensiveness of such a discriminating arrangement
of proofs as the “Prerogative Instances” of the Novum Organum, so
natural and real, yet never before thus compared and systematized. But
there is a great interval between his method of experimenting, his “Hunt
of Pan” — the three tables of Instances, “Presence,” “Absence” and
“Degrees, or Comparisons,” leading to a process of sifting and
exclusion, and to the First Vintage, or beginnings of theory — and say,
for instance, Mill’s four methods of experimental inquiry: the method of
agreement, of differences, of residues, and of concomitant variations.
The course which he marked out so laboriously and so ingeniously for
Induction to follow was one which was found to be impracticable, and as
barren of results as those deductive philosophies on which he lavished
his scorn. He has left precepts and examples of what he meant by his
cross-examining and sifting processes. As admonitions to cross-examine
and to sift facts and phenomena they are valuable. Many of the
observations and classifications are subtle and instructive. But in his
hands nothing comes of them. They lead at the utmost to mere negative
conclusions; they show what a thing is not. But his attempt to elicit
anything positive out of them breaks down, or ends at best in
divinations and guesses, sometimes — as in connecting Heat and Motion —
very near to later and more carefully-grounded theories, but always
unverified. He had a radically false and mechanical conception, though
in words he earnestly disclaims it, of the way to deal with the facts of
nature. He looked on them as things which told their own story, and
suggested the questions which ought to be put to them; and with this
idea half his time was spent in collecting huge masses of indigested
facts of the most various authenticity and value, and he thought he was
collecting materials which his method had only to touch in order to
bring forth from them light and truth and power. He thought that, not in
certain sciences, but in all, one set of men could do the observing and
collecting, and another be set on the work of Induction and the
discovery of “axioms.” Doubtless in the arrangement and sorting of them
his versatile and ingenious mind gave itself full play; he divides and
distinguishes them into their companies and groups, different kinds of
Motion, “Prerogative” instances, with their long tale of imaginative
titles. But we look in vain for any use that he was able to make of
them, or even to suggest. Bacon never adequately realised that no
promiscuous assemblage of even the most certain facts could ever lead to
knowledge, could ever suggest their own interpretation, without the
action on them of the living mind, without the initiative of an idea. In
truth he was so afraid of assumptions and “anticipations” and prejudices
— his great bugbear was so much the “intellectus sibi permissus” the
mind given liberty to guess and imagine and theorise, instead of, as it
ought, absolutely and servilely submitting itself to the control of
facts — that he missed the true place of the rational and formative
element in his account of Induction. He does tell us, indeed, that
“truth emerges sooner from error than from confusion.” He indulges the
mind, in the course of its investigation of “Instances,” with a first
“vintage” of provisional generalisations. But of the way in which the
living mind of the discoverer works, with its ideas and insight, and
thoughts that come no one knows whence, working hand in hand with what
comes before the eye or is tested by the instrument, he gives us no
picture. Compare his elaborate investigation of the “Form of Heat” in
the Novum Organum, with such a record of real inquiry as Wells’s
Treatise on Dew, or Herschel’s analysis of it in his Introduction to
Natural Philosophy. And of the difference of genius between a Faraday or
a Newton, and the crowd of average men who have used and finished off
their work, he takes no account. Indeed, he thinks that for the future
such difference is to disappear.</p>
<p>“That his method is impracticable,” says Mr. Ellis, “cannot, I think,
be denied, if we reflect not only that it never has produced any result,
but also that the process by which scientific truths have been
established cannot be so presented as even to appear to be in accordance
with it. In all cases this process involves an element to which nothing
corresponds in the Tables of ‘Comparence’ and ‘Exclusion,’ namely, the
application to the facts of observation of a principle of arrangement,
an idea, existing in the mind of the discoverer antecedently to the act
of induction. It may be said that this idea is precisely one of the
naturæ into which the facts of observation ought in Bacon’s system to be
analysed. And this is in one sense true; but it must be added that this
analysis, if it be thought right so to call it, is of the essence of the
discovery which results from it. In most cases the act of induction
follows as a matter of course as soon as the appropriate idea has been
introduced.” — Ellis, General Preface, i. 38.</p>
<p>Lastly, not only was Bacon’s conception of philosophy so narrow as to
exclude one of its greatest domains; for, says Mr. Ellis, “it cannot be
denied that to Bacon all sound philosophy seemed to be included in what
we now call the natural sciences,” and in all its parts was claimed as
the subject of his inductive method; but Bacon’s scientific knowledge
and scientific conceptions were often very imperfect — more imperfect
than they ought to have been for his time. Of one large part of science,
which was just then beginning to be cultivated with high promise of
success — the knowledge of the heavens — he speaks with a coldness and
suspicion which contrasts remarkably with his eagerness about things
belonging to the sphere of the earth and within reach of the senses. He
holds, of course, the unity of the world; the laws of the whole visible
universe are one order; but the heavens, wonderful as they are to him,
are — compared with other things — out of his track of inquiry. He had
his astronomical theories; he expounded them in his “Descriptio Globi
Intellectualis” and his Thema Coeli He was not altogether ignorant of
what was going on in days when Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo were at
work. But he did not know how to deal with it, and there were men in
England, before and then, who understood much better than he the
problems and the methods of astronomy. He had one conspicuous and
strange defect for a man who undertook what he did. He was not a
mathematician: he did not see the indispensable necessity of mathematics
in the great Instauration which he projected; he did not much believe in
what they could do. He cared so little about them that he takes no
notice of Napier’s invention of Logarithms. He was not able to trace how
the direct information of the senses might be rightly subordinated to
the rational, but not self-evident results of geometry and arithmetic.
He was impatient of the subtleties of astronomical calculations; they
only attempted to satisfy problems about the motion of bodies in the
sky, and told us nothing of physical fact; they gave us, as Prometheus
gave to Jove, the outside skin of the offering, which was stuffed inside
with straw and rubbish. He entirely failed to see that before dealing
with physical astronomy, it must be dealt with mathematically. “It is
well to remark,” as Mr. Ellis says, “that none of Newton’s astronomical
discoveries could have been made if astronomers had not continued to
render themselves liable to Bacon’s censure.” Bacon little thought that
in navigation the compass itself would become a subordinate instrument
compared with the helps given by mathematical astronomy. In this, and in
other ways, Bacon rose above his time in his conceptions of what might
be, but not of what was; the list is a long one, as given by
Mr. Spedding (iii. 511), of the instances which show that he was
ill-informed about the advances of knowledge in his own time. And his
mind was often not clear when he came to deal with complex phenomena.
Thus, though he constructed a table of specific gravities— “the only
collection,” says Mr. Ellis, “of quantitative experiments that we find
in his works,” and “wonderfully accurate considering the manner in which
they were obtained;” yet he failed to understand the real nature of the
famous experiment of Archimedes. And so with the larger features of his
teaching it is impossible not to feel how imperfectly he had emancipated
himself from the power of words and of common prepossessions; how for
one reason or another he had failed to call himself to account in the
terms he employed, and the assumptions on which he argued. The caution
does not seem to have occurred to him that the statement of a fact may,
in nine cases out of ten, involve a theory. His whole doctrine of
“Forms” and “Simple natures,” which is so prominent in his method of
investigation, is an example of loose and slovenly use of unexamined and
untested ideas. He allowed himself to think that it would be possible to
arrive at an alphabet of nature, which, once attained, would suffice to
spell out and constitute all its infinite combinations. He accepted,
without thinking it worth a doubt, the doctrine of appetites and
passions and inclinations and dislikes and horrors in inorganic nature.
His whole physiology of life and death depends on a doctrine of animal
spirits, of which he traces the operations and qualities as if they were
as certain as the nerves or the blood, and of which he gives this
account— “that in every tangible body there is a spirit covered and
enveloped in the grosser body;” “not a virtue, not an energy, not an
actuality, nor any such idle matter, but a body thin and invisible, and
yet having place and dimension, and real.” … “a middle nature between
flame, which is momentary, and air which is permanent.” Yet these are
the very things for which he holds up Aristotle and the Scholastics and
the Italian speculators to reprobation and scorn. The clearness of his
thinking was often overlaid by the immense profusion of decorative
material which his meditation brought along with it. The defect was
greater than that which even his ablest defenders admit. It was more
than that in that “greatest and radical difference, which he himself
observes” between minds, the difference between minds which were apt to
note distinctions, and those which were apt to note likenesses, he was,
without knowing it, defective in the first. It was that in many
instances he exemplified in his own work the very faults which he
charged on the older philosophies: haste, carelessness, precipitancy,
using words without thinking them out, assuming to know when he ought to
have perceived his real ignorance.</p>
<p>What, then, with all these mistakes and failures, not always
creditable or pardonable, has given Bacon his preeminent place in the
history of science?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The answer is that with all his mistakes and failures, the
principles on which his mode of attaining a knowledge of nature was
based were the only true ones; and they had never before been propounded
so systematically, so fully, and so earnestly. His was not the first
mind on whom these principles had broken. Men were, and had been for
some time, pursuing their inquiries into various departments of nature
precisely on the general plan of careful and honest observation of real
things which he enjoined. They had seen, as he saw, the futility of all
attempts at natural philosophy by mere thinking and arguing, without
coming into contact with the contradictions or corrections or
verifications of experience. In Italy, in Germany, in England there were
laborious and successful workers, who had long felt that to be in touch
with nature was the only way to know. But no one had yet come before the
world to proclaim this on the house-tops, as the key of the only certain
path to the secrets of nature, the watchword of a revolution in the
methods of interpreting her; and this Bacon did with an imposing
authority and power which enforced attention. He spoke the thoughts of
patient toilers like Harvey with a largeness and richness which they
could not command, and which they perhaps smiled at. He disentangled and
spoke the vague thoughts of his age, which other men had not the courage
and clearness of mind to formulate. What Bacon did, indeed, and what he
meant, are separate matters. He meant an infallible method by which man
should be fully equipped for a struggle with nature; he meant an
irresistible and immediate conquest, within a definite and not distant
time. It was too much. He himself saw no more of what he meant than
Columbus did of America. But what he did was to persuade men for the
future that the intelligent, patient, persevering cross-examination of
things, and the thoughts about them, was the only, and was the
successful road to know. No one had yet done this, and he did it. His
writings were a public recognition of real science, in its humblest
tasks about the commonplace facts before our feet, as well as in its
loftiest achievements. “The man who is growing great and happy by
electrifying a bottle,” says Dr. Johnson, “wonders to see the world
engaged in the prattle about peace and war,” and the world was ready to
smile at the simplicity or the impertinence of his enthusiasm. Bacon
impressed upon the world for good, with every resource of subtle
observation and forcible statement, that “the man who is growing great
by electrifying a bottle” is as important a person in the world’s
affairs as the arbiter of peace and war.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet this is not all. An inferior man might have made himself the
mouthpiece of the hopes and aspirations of his generation after a larger
science. But to Bacon these aspirations embodied themselves in the form
of a great and absorbing idea; an idea which took possession of the
whole man, kindling in him a faith which nothing could quench, and a
passion which nothing could dull; an idea which, for forty years, was
his daily companion, his daily delight, his daily business; an idea
which he was never tired of placing in ever fresh and more attractive
lights, from which no trouble could wean him, about which no disaster
could make him despair; an idea round which the instincts and intuitions
and obstinate convictions of genius gathered, which kindled his rich
imagination and was invested by it with a splendour and magnificence
like the dreams of fable. It is this idea which finds its fitting
expression in the grand and stately aphorisms of the Novum Organum, in
the varied fields of interest in the De Augmentis, in the romance of the
New Atlantis. It is this idea, this certainty of a new unexplored
Kingdom of Knowledge within the reach and grasp of man, if he will be
humble enough and patient enough and truthful enough to occupy it — this
announcement not only of a new system of thought, but of a change in the
condition of the world — a prize and possession such as man had not yet
imagined; this belief in the fortunes of the human race and its issue,
“such an issue, it may be, as in the present condition of things and
men’s minds cannot easily be conceived or imagined,” yet more than
verified in the wonders which our eyes have seen — it is this which
gives its prerogative to Bacon’s work. That he bungled about the
processes of Induction, that he talked about an unintelligible doctrine
of Forms, did not affect the weight and solemnity of his call to learn,
so full of wisdom and good-sense, so sober and so solid, yet so
audaciously confident. There had been nothing like it in its ardour of
hope, in the glory which it threw around the investigation of nature. It
was the presence and the power of a great idea — long become a
commonplace to us, but strange and perplexing at first to his own
generation, which probably shared Coke’s opinion that it qualified its
champion for a place in the company of the “Ship of Fools,” which
expressed its opinion of the man who wrote the Novum Organum, in the
sentiment that “a fool could not have written it, and a wise man would
not” — it is this which has placed Bacon among the great discoverers of
the human race.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is this imaginative yet serious assertion of the vast range and
possibilities of human knowledge which, as M. de Rémusat remarks — the
keenest and fairest of Bacon’s judges — gives Bacon his claim to the
undefinable but very real character of greatness. Two men stand out,
“the masters of those who know,” without equals up to their time, among
men — the Greek Aristotle and the Englishman Bacon. They agree in the
universality and comprehensiveness of their conception of human
knowledge; and they were absolutely alone in their serious practical
ambition to work out this conception. In the separate departments of
thought, of investigation, of art, each is left far behind by numbers of
men, who in these separate departments have gone far deeper than they,
have soared higher, have been more successful in what they attempted.
But Aristotle first, and for his time more successfully, and Bacon after
him, ventured on the daring enterprise of “taking all knowledge for
their province;” and in this they stood alone. This present scene of
man’s existence, this that we call nature, the stage on which mortal
life begins and goes on and ends, the faculties with which man is
equipped to act, to enjoy, to create, to hold his way amid or against
the circumstances and forces round him — this is what each wants to
know, as thoroughly and really as can be. It is not to reduce things to
a theory or a system that they look around them on the place where they
find themselves with life and thought and power; that were easily done,
and has been done over and over again, only to prove its futility. It is
to know, as to the whole and its parts, as men understand knowing in
some one subject of successful handling, whether art or science or
practical craft. This idea, this effort, distinguishes these two men.
The Greeks — predecessors, contemporaries, successors of Aristotle —
were speculators, full of clever and ingenious guesses, in which the
amount of clear and certain fact was in lamentable disproportion to the
schemes blown up from it; or they devoted themselves more profitably to
some one or two subjects of inquiry, moral or purely intellectual, with
absolute indifference to what might be asked, or what might be known, of
the real conditions under which they were passing their existence. Some
of the Romans, Cicero and Pliny, had encyclopædic minds; but the Roman
mind was the slave of precedent, and was more than satisfied with
partially understanding and neatly arranging what the Greeks had left.
The Arabians looked more widely about them; but the Arabians were
essentially sceptics, and resigned subjects to the inevitable and the
inexplicable; there was an irony, open or covert, in their philosophy,
their terminology, their transcendental mysticism, which showed how
little they believed that they really knew. The vast and mighty
intellects of the schoolmen never came into a real grapple with the
immensity of the facts of the natural or even of the moral world; within
the world of abstract thought, the world of language, with its infinite
growths and consequences, they have never had their match for keenness,
for patience, for courage, for inexhaustible toil; but they were as much
disconnected from the natural world, which was their stage of life, as
if they had been disembodied spirits. The Renaissance brought with it
not only the desire to know, but to know comprehensively and in all
possible directions; it brought with it temptations to the awakened
Italian genius, renewed, enlarged, refined, if not strengthened by its
passage through the Middle Ages, to make thought deal with the real, and
to understand the scene in which men were doing such strange and
wonderful things; but Giordano Bruno, Telesio, Campanella, and their
fellows, were not men capable of more than short flights, though they
might be daring and eager ones. It required more thoroughness, more
humble-minded industry, to match the magnitude of the task. And there
have been men of universal minds and comprehensive knowledge since
Bacon, Leibnitz, Goethe, Humboldt, men whose thoughts were at home
everywhere, where there was something to be known. But even for them the
world of knowledge has grown too large. We shall never again see an
Aristotle or a Bacon, because the conditions of knowledge have altered.
Bacon, like Aristotle, belonged to an age of adventure, which went to
sea little knowing whither it went, and ill furnished with knowledge and
instruments. He entered with a vast and vague scheme of discovery on
these unknown seas and new worlds which to us are familiar, and daily
traversed in every direction. This new world of knowledge has turned out
in many ways very different from what Aristotle or Bacon supposed, and
has been conquered by implements and weapons very different in precision
and power from what they purposed to rely on. But the combination of
patient and careful industry, with the courage and divination of genius,
in doing what none had done before, makes it equally stupid and idle to
impeach their greatness.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Bacon has been charged with bringing philosophy down from the
heights, not as of old to make men know themselves, and to be the
teacher of the highest form of truth, but to be the purveyor of material
utility. It contemplates only, it is said, the “commoda vitæ;” about the
deeper and more elevating problems of thought it does not trouble
itself. It concerns itself only about external and sensible nature,
about what is “of the earth, earthy.” But when it comes to the questions
which have attracted the keenest and hardiest thinkers, the question,
what it is that thinks and wills — what is the origin and guarantee of
the faculties by which men know anything at all and form rational and
true conceptions about nature and themselves, whence it is that reason
draws its powers and materials and rules — what is the meaning of words
which all use but few can explain — Time and Space, and Being and Cause,
and consciousness and choice, and the moral law — Bacon is content with
a loose and superficial treatment of them. Bacon certainly was not a
metaphysician, nor an exact and lucid reasoner. With wonderful flashes
of sure intuition or happy anticipation, his mind was deficient in the
powers which deal with the deeper problems of thought, just as it was
deficient in the mathematical faculty. The subtlety, the intuition, the
penetration, the severe precision, even the force of imagination, which
make a man a great thinker on any abstract subject were not his; the
interest of questions which had interested metaphysicians had no
interest for him: he distrusted and undervalued them. When he touches
the “ultimities” of knowledge he is as obscure and hard to be understood
as any of those restless Southern Italians of his own age, who shared
with him the ambition of reconstructing science. Certainly the science
which most interested Bacon, the science which he found, as he thought,
in so desperate a condition, and to which he gave so great an impulse,
was physical science. But physical science may be looked at and pursued
in different ways, in different tempers, with different objects. It may
be followed in the spirit of Newton, of Boyle, of Herschel, of Faraday;
or with a confined and low horizon it may be dwarfed and shrivelled into
a mean utilitarianism. But Bacon’s horizon was not a narrow one. He
believed in God and immortality and the Christian creed and hope. To him
the restoration of the Reign of Man was a noble enterprise, because man
was so great and belonged to so great an order of things, because the
things which he was bid to search into with honesty and truthfulness
were the works and laws of God, because it was so shameful and so
miserable that from an ignorance which industry and good-sense could
remedy, the tribes of mankind passed their days in self-imposed darkness
and helplessness. It was God’s appointment that men should go through
this earthly stage of their being. Each stage of man’s mysterious
existence had to be dealt with, not according to his own fancies, but
according to the conditions imposed on it; and it was one of man’s first
duties to arrange for his stay on earth according to the real laws which
he could find out if he only sought for them. Doubtless it was one of
Bacon’s highest hopes that from the growth of true knowledge would
follow in surprising ways the relief of man’s estate; this, as an end,
runs through all his yearning after a fuller and surer method of
interpreting nature. The desire to be a great benefactor, the spirit of
sympathy and pity for mankind, reign through this portion of his work —
pity for confidence so greatly abused by the teachers of man, pity for
ignorance which might be dispelled, pity for pain and misery which might
be relieved. In the quaint but beautiful picture of courtesy, kindness,
and wisdom, which he imagines in the New Atlantis, the representative of
true philosophy, the “Father of Solomon’s House,” is introduced as one
who “had an aspect as if he pitied men.” But unless it is utilitarianism
to be keenly alive to the needs and pains of life, and to be eager and
busy to lighten and assuage them, Bacon’s philosophy was not
utilitarian. It may deserve many reproaches, but not this one. Such a
passage as the following — in which are combined the highest motives and
graces and passions of the soul, love of truth, humility of mind, purity
of purpose, reverence for God, sympathy for man, compassion for the
sorrows of the world and longing to heal them, depth of conviction and
faith — fairly represents the spirit which runs through his works. After
urging the mistaken use of imagination and authority in science, he goes
on —</li>
</ol>
<p>“There is not and never will be an end or limit to this; one catches
at one thing, another at another; each has his favourite fancy; pure and
open light there is none; every one philosophises out of the cells of
his own imagination, as out of Plato’s cave; the higher wits with more
acuteness and felicity, the duller, less happily, but with equal
pertinacity. And now of late, by the regulation of some learned and (as
things now are) excellent men (the former license having, I suppose,
become wearisome), the sciences are confined to certain and prescribed
authors, and thus restrained are imposed upon the old and instilled into
the young; so that now (to use the sarcasm of Cicero concerning Cæsar’s
year) the constellation of Lyra rises by edict, and authority is taken
for truth, not truth for authority. Which kind of institution and
discipline is excellent for present use, but precludes all prospect of
improvement. For we copy the sin of our first parents while we suffer
for it. They wished to be like God, but their posterity wish to be even
greater. For we create worlds, we direct and domineer over nature, we
will have it that all things are as in our folly we think they should
be, not as seems fittest to the Divine wisdom, or as they are found to
be in fact; and I know not whether we more distort the facts of nature
or of our own wits; but we clearly impress the stamp of our own image on
the creatures and works of God, instead of carefully examining and
recognising in them the stamp of the Creator himself. Wherefore our
dominion over creatures is a second time forfeited, not undeservedly;
and whereas after the fall of man some power over the resistance of
creatures was still left to him — the power of subduing and managing
them by true and solid arts — yet this too through our insolence, and
because we desire to be like God and to follow the dictates of our own
reason, we in great part lose. If, therefore, there be any humility
towards the Creator, any reverence for or disposition to magnify His
works, any charity for man and anxiety to relieve his sorrows and
necessities, any love of truth in nature, any hatred of darkness, any
desire for the purification of the understanding, we must entreat men
again and again to discard, or at least set apart for a while, these
volatile and preposterous philosophies which have preferred theses to
hypotheses, led experience captive, and triumphed over the works of God;
and to approach with humility and veneration to unroll the volume of
Creation, to linger and meditate therein, and with minds washed clean
from opinions to study it in purity and integrity. For this is that
sound and language which “went forth into all lands,” and did not incur
the confusion of Babel; this should men study to be perfect in, and
becoming again as little children condescend to take the alphabet of it
into their hands, and spare no pains to search and unravel the
interpretation thereof, but pursue it strenuously and persevere even
unto death.” — Preface to Historia Naturalis: translated, Works, v.
132-3.</p>
