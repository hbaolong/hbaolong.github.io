<li><p>Now we pass unto the arts of judgment, which handle the natures
of proofs and demonstrations, which as to induction hath a coincidence
with invention; for all inductions, whether in good or vicious form, the
same action of the mind which inventeth, judgeth — all one as in the
sense. But otherwise it is in proof by syllogism, for the proof being
not immediate, but by mean, the invention of the mean is one thing, and
the judgment of the consequence is another; the one exciting only, the
other examining. Therefore, for the real and exact form of judgment, we
refer ourselves to that which we have spoken of interpretation of
Nature.</p></li>
<li><p>For the other judgment by syllogism, as it is a thing most
agreeable to the mind of man, so it hath been vehemently end excellently
laboured. For the nature of man doth extremely covet to have somewhat in
his understanding fixed and unmovable, and as a rest and support of the
mind. And, therefore, as Aristotle endeavoureth to prove, that in all
motion there is some point quiescent; and as he elegantly expoundeth the
ancient fable of Atlas (that stood fixed, and bare up the heaven from
falling) to be meant of the poles or axle-tree of heaven, whereupon the
conversion is accomplished, so assuredly men have a desire to have an
Atlas or axle-tree within to keep them from fluctuation, which is like
to a perpetual peril of falling. Therefore men did hasten to set down
some principles about which the variety of their disputatious might
turn.</p></li>
<li><p>So, then, this art of judgment is but the reduction of
propositions to principles in a middle term. The principles to be agreed
by all and exempted from argument; the middle term to be elected at the
liberty of every man’s invention; the reduction to be of two kinds,
direct and inverted: the one when the proposition is reduced to the
principle, which they term a probation ostensive; the other, when the
contradictory of the proposition is reduced to the contradictory of the
principle, which is that which they call per incommodum, or pressing an
absurdity; the number of middle terms to be as the proposition standeth
degrees more or less removed from the principle.</p></li>
<li><p>But this art hath two several methods of doctrine, the one by way
of direction, the other by way of caution: the former frameth and
setteth down a true form of consequence, by the variations and
deflections from which errors and inconsequences may be exactly judged.
Toward the composition and structure of which form it is incident to
handle the parts thereof, which are propositions, and the parts of
propositions, which are simple words. And this is that part of logic
which is comprehended in the Analytics.</p></li>
<li><p>The second method of doctrine was introduced for expedite use and
assurance sake, discovering the more subtle forms of sophisms and
illaqueations with their redargutions, which is that which is termed
elenches. For although in the more gross sorts of fallacies it happeneth
(as Seneca maketh the comparison well) as in juggling feats, which,
though we know not how they are done, yet we know well it is not as it
seemeth to be; yet the more subtle sort of them doth not only put a man
besides his answer, but doth many times abuse his judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>This part concerning elenches is excellently handled by Aristotle
in precept, but more excellently by Plato in example; not only in the
persons of the sophists, but even in Socrates himself, who, professing
to affirm nothing, but to infirm that which was affirmed by another,
hath exactly expressed all the forms of objection, fallace, and
redargution. And although we have said that the use of this doctrine is
for redargution, yet it is manifest the degenerate and corrupt use is
for caption and contradiction, which passeth for a great faculty, and no
doubt is of very great advantage, though the difference be good which
was made between orators and sophisters, that the one is as the
greyhound, which hath his advantage in the race, and the other as the
hare, which hath her advantage in the turn, so as it is the advantage of
the weaker creature.</p></li>
<li><p>But yet further, this doctrine of elenches hath a more ample
latitude and extent than is perceived; namely, unto divers parts of
knowledge, whereof some are laboured and other omitted. For first, I
conceive (though it may seem at first somewhat strange) that that part
which is variably referred, sometimes to logic, sometimes to metaphysic,
touching the common adjuncts of essences, is but an elenche; for the
great sophism of all sophisms being equivocation or ambiguity of words
and phrase, specially of such words as are most general and intervene in
every inquiry, it seemeth to me that the true and fruitful use (leaving
vain subtleties and speculations) of the inquiry of majority, minority,
priority, posteriority, identity, diversity, possibility, act, totality,
parts, existence, privation, and the like, are but wise cautions against
ambiguities of speech. So, again, the distribution of things into
certain tribes, which we call categories or predicaments, are but
cautions against the confusion of definitions and divisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, there is a seducement that worketh by the strength of
the impression, and not by the subtlety of the illaqueation — not so
much perplexing the reason, as overruling it by power of the
imagination. But this part I think more proper to handle when I shall
speak of rhetoric.</p></li>
<li><p>But lastly, there is yet a much more important and profound kind
of fallacies in the mind of man, which I find not observed or inquired
at all, and think good to place here, as that which of all others
appertaineth most to rectify judgment, the force whereof is such as it
doth not dazzle or snare the understanding in some particulars, but doth
more generally and inwardly infect and corrupt the state thereof. For
the mind of man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass,
wherein the beams of things should reflect according to their true
incidence; nay, it is rather like an enchanted glass, full of
superstition and imposture, if it be not delivered and reduced. For this
purpose, let us consider the false appearances that are imposed upon us
by the general nature of the mind, beholding them in an example or two;
as first, in that instance which is the root of all superstition,
namely, that to the nature of the mind of all men it is consonant for
the affirmative or active to affect more than the negative or privative.
So that a few times hitting or presence countervails ofttimes failing or
absence, as was well answered by Diagoras to him that showed him in
Neptune’s temple the great number of pictures of such as had escaped
shipwreck, and had paid their vows to Neptune, saying, “Advise now, you
that think it folly to invocate Neptune in tempest.” “Yea, but,” saith
Diagoras, “where are they painted that are drowned?” Let us behold it in
another instance, namely, that the spirit of man, being of an equal and
uniform substance, doth usually suppose and feign in nature a greater
equality and uniformity than is in truth. Hence it cometh that the
mathematicians cannot satisfy themselves except they reduce the motions
of the celestial bodies to perfect circles, rejecting spiral lines, and
labouring to be discharged of eccentrics. Hence it cometh that whereas
there are many things in Nature as it were monodica, sui juris, yet the
cogitations of man do feign unto them relatives, parallels, and
conjugates, whereas no such thing is; as they have feigned an element of
fire to keep square with earth, water, and air, and the like. Nay, it is
not credible, till it be opened, what a number of fictions and fantasies
the similitude of human actions and arts, together with the making of
man communis mensura, have brought into natural philosophy; not much
better than the heresy of the Anthropomorphites, bred in the cells of
gross and solitary monks, and the opinion of Epicurus, answerable to the
same in heathenism, who supposed the gods to be of human shape. And,
therefore, Velleius the Epicurean needed not to have asked why God
should have adorned the heavens with stars, as if He had been an
aedilis, one that should have set forth some magnificent shows or plays.
For if that great Work-master had been of a human disposition, He would
have cast the stars into some pleasant and beautiful works and orders
like the frets in the roofs of houses; whereas one can scarce find a
posture in square, or triangle, or straight line, amongst such an
infinite number, so differing a harmony there is between the spirit of
man and the spirit of Nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Let us consider again the false appearances imposed upon us by
every man’s own individual nature and custom in that feigned supposition
that Plato maketh of the cave; for certainly if a child were continued
in a grot or cave under the earth until maturity of age, and came
suddenly abroad, he would have strange and absurd imaginations. So, in
like manner, although our persons live in the view of heaven, yet our
spirits are included in the caves of our own complexions and customs,
which minister unto us infinite errors and vain opinions if they be not
recalled to examination. But hereof we have given many examples in one
of the errors, or peccant humours, which we ran briefly over in our
first book.</p></li>
<li><p>And lastly, let us consider the false appearances that are
imposed upon us by words, which are framed and applied according to the
conceit and capacities of the vulgar sort; and although we think we
govern our words, and prescribe it well loquendum ut vulgus sentiendum
ut sapientes, yet certain it is that words, as a Tartar’s bow, do shoot
back upon the understanding of the wisest, and mightily entangle and
pervert the judgment. So as it is almost necessary in all controversies
and disputations to imitate the wisdom of the mathematicians, in setting
down in the very beginning the definitions of our words and terms, that
others may know how we accept and understand them, and whether they
concur with us or no. For it cometh to pass, for want of this, that we
are sure to end there where we ought to have begun, which is, in
questions and differences about words. To conclude, therefore, it must
be confessed that it is not possible to divorce ourselves from these
fallacies and false appearances because they are inseparable from our
nature and condition of life; so yet, nevertheless, the caution of them
(for all elenches, as was said, are but cautions) doth extremely import
the true conduct of human judgment. The particular elenches or cautions
against these three false appearances I find altogether
deficient.</p></li>
<li><p>There remaineth one part of judgment of great excellency which to
mine understanding is so slightly touched, as I may report that also
deficient; which is the application of the differing kinds of proofs to
the differing kinds of subjects. For there being but four kinds of
demonstrations, that is, by the immediate consent of the mind or sense,
by induction, by syllogism, and by congruity, which is that which
Aristotle calleth demonstration in orb or circle, and not a notioribus,
every of these hath certain subjects in the matter of sciences, in which
respectively they have chiefest use; and certain others, from which
respectively they ought to be excluded; and the rigour and curiosity in
requiring the more severe proofs in some things, and chiefly the
facility in contenting ourselves with the more remiss proofs in others,
hath been amongst the greatest causes of detriment and hindrance to
knowledge. The distributions and assignations of demonstrations
according to the analogy of sciences I note as deficient.</p></li>
