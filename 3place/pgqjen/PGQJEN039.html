<h4 id="chapter-xii">Chapter XII</h4>
<p>Cœlum, or Beginnings Explained of the Creation, or Origin of all
Things</p>
<p>THE poets relate, that Cœlum was the most ancient of all the gods;
that his parts of generation were cut off by his Son Saturn; that Saturn
had a numerous offspring, but devoured all his sons, as soon as they
were born; that Jupiter at length escaped the common fate; and when
grown up, drove his father Saturn into Tartarus; usurped the kingdom;
cut off his father’s genitals, with the same knife wherewith Saturn had
dismembered Cœlum, and throwing them into the sea, thence sprung
Venus.</p>
<p>Before Jupiter was well established in his empire, two memorable wars
were made upon him: the first by the Titans, in subduing of whom, So1,
the only one of the Titans who favoured Jupiter, performed him singular
service; the second by the giants, who being destroyed and subdued by
the thunder and arms of Jupiter, he now reigned secure.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - This fable appears to be an enigmatical account of the
origin of all things, not greatly differing from the philosophy
afterwards embraced by Democritus, who expressly asserts the eternity of
matter, but denies the eternity of the world; thereby approaching to the
truth of sacred writ, which makes chaos, or uninformed matter, to exist
before the six days’ works.</p>
<p>The meaning of the fable seems to he this: Cœlum denotes all the
concave space, or vaulted roof that incloses all matter, and Saturn the
matter itself, which cuts off all power of generation from his father;
as one and the same quantity of matter remains invariable in nature,
without addition or diminution. But the agitations and struggling
motions of matter, first produced certain imperfect and illjoined
compositions of things, as it were so many first rudiments, or essays of
worlds; till, in process of time, there arose a fabric capable of
preserving its form and structure. Whence the first age was shadowed out
by the reign of Saturn; who, on account of the frequent dissolutions,
and short durations of things, was said to devour his children. And the
second age was denoted by the reign of Jupiter; who thrust, or drove
those frequent and transitory changes into Tartarus - a place expressive
of disorder. This place seems to be the middle space, between the lower
heavens and the internal parts of the earth, wherein disorder,
imperfection, mutation, mortality, destruction, and corruption, are
principally found.</p>
<p>Venus was not born during the former generation of things, under the
reign of Saturn; for whilst discord and jar had the upper hand of
concord and uniformity in the matter of the universe, a change of the
entire structure was necessary. And in this manner things were generated
and destroyed, before Saturn was dismembered. But when this manner of
generation ceased, there immediately followed another, brought about by
Venus, or a perfect and established harmony of things; whereby clues
were wrought in the parts, whilst the universal fabric remained entire
and undisturbed. Saturn, however, is said to be thrust out and
dethroned, not killed, and become extinct; because, agreeably to the
opinion of Democritus, the world might relapse into its old confusion
and disorder, which Lucretius hoped would not happen in his time.</p>
<p>But now, when the world was compact, and held together by its own
bulk and energy, yet there was no rest from the beginning; for first,
there followed considerable motions and disturbances in the celestial
regions, though so regulated and moderated by the power of the Sun,
prevailing over the heavenly bodies, as to continue the world in its
state. Afterwards there followed the like in the lower parts, by
inundations, storms, winds, general earthquakes, andandandandc., which,
however, being subdued and kept under, there ensued a more peaceable and
lasting harmony, and consent of things. It may be said of this fable,
that it includes philosophy; and again, that philosophy includes the
fable; for we know, by faith, that all these things are but the oracle
of sense, long since ceased and decayed; but the matter and fabric of
the world being justly attributed to a creator.</p>
