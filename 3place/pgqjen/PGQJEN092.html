<h4 id="iii.-century.">III. Century.</h4>
<p>ALL Sounds (whatsoeuer) moue Round; That is to say; On all Sides;
Vpwards; Downwards; Forwards; and Backwards. This appeareth in all
Instances.</p>
<p>Sounds doe not require to bee conueyed to the Sense, in a Right Line,
as Visibles doe, but may be Arched; Though it be true, they moue
strongest in a Right Line; Which neuerthelesse is not caused by the
Rightnesse of the Line, but by the Shortnesse of the distance; Linea
recta breuissima. And therefore we see, if a Wall be betweene, and you
speake on the one Side, you heare it on the other; Which is not because
the Sound Passeth thorow the Wall; but Archeth ouer the Wall.</p>
<p>If the Sound be Stopped and Reperenssed, it commeth about on the
other Side, in an Oblique Line. So, if in a Coach, one side of the Boot
be downe, and the other vp; And a Begger beg on the Close Side; you
would thinke that he were on the Open Side. So likewise, if a Bell or
Clocke, be (for Example) on the North-side of a Chamber; And the Window
of that Chamber be vpon the South; He that is in the Chamber, will
thinke the Sound came from the South.</p>
<p>Sounds, though they spread round, (so that there is an Orbe, or
Sphericall Area of the Sound;) yet they moue strongest, and goe furthest
in the Fore-lines, from the first Locall Impulsion of the Aire. And
therefore in Preaching, you shall heare the Preachers Voice, better,
before the Pulpit, than behinde it, or on the Sides, though it stand
open. So a Plarquebuz, or Ordnance, will be further heard, forwards,
from the Mouth of the Peece, than backwards, or on the Sides.</p>
<p>It may bee doubted, that Sounds doe moue better, Downwards than
Vpwards, Pulpits are placed high aboue the People. And when the Ancient
Generalls spake to their Armies, they had euer a Mount of Turfe cast vp,
whereupon they stood: But this may be imputed to the Stops and
Obstacles, which the voice meeteth with, when one speaketh vpon the
leuell. But there seemeth to be more in it: For it may bee, that
Spirituall Species, both of Things Visible and Sounds, doe moue better
Downewards than Vpwards. It is a strange Thing, that to Men standing
below on the Ground, those that be on the Top of Pauls, seeme much lesse
then they are, and cannot bee knowne; But to Men aboue, those below
seeme nothing so much lessened, and may bee knowne; yet it is true, that
all things to them aboue, seeme also somewhat contracted, and better
collected into Figure: as Knots in Gardens shew best from an Vpper
window, or Tarras.</p>
<p>But to make an exact Triall of it, let a Man stand in a Chamber, not
much aboue the Ground, and speake out at the window, through a Trunke,
to one standing on the Ground, as softly as he can, the other laying his
Eare close to the Truncke: Then viâ versa, let the other speake below
keeping the same Proportion of Softnesse; And let him in the Chamber lay
his Eare to the Trunck: And this may be the aptest Meanes, to make a
Iudgement, whether Sounds descend, or ascend, better.</p>
<p>After that Sound is created, (which is in a moment,) wee finde it
continueth some small time, melting by little and little. In this there
is a wonderfull Errour amongst Men, who take this to be a Continuance of
the First Sound; whereas (in truth) it is a Renouation, and not a
Continuance: For the Body percussed, hath by reason of the Percussion, a
Trepidation wrought in the Minute Parts; and so reneweth the Percussion
of the Aire. This appeareth manifestly, because that the Melting Sound
of a Bell, or of a String strucken, which is thought to be a
Continuance, ceaseth as soone as the Bell or String are touched. As in a
Virginall, as soone as euer the Iacke falleth, and toucheth the String,
the Sound ceaseth; And in a Bell, after you haue chimed vpon it, if you
touch the Bell, the Sound ceaseth, And in this you must distingush, that
there are two Trepidations: The one Manifest, and Locall; As of the
Bell, when it is Pensile: The other Secret, of the Minute Parts; such as
is described in the 9th Instance. But it is true, that the Locall
helpeth the Secret great’y. We see likewise that in Pipes, and other
winde Instruments, the Sound lasteth no longer, than the breath bloweth.
It is true, that in Organs, there is a confused Murmur for a while,
after you haue plaied; But that is but while the Bellowes are in
Falling.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that in the Noise of great Ordnance, where many are
shot off together, the Sound will be carried, (at the least) twenty
Miles vpon the land, and much further vpon the Water. But then it will
come to the Eare; Not in the Instant of the Shooting off, but it will
come an Houre, or more later. This must needs be a Continuance of the
First Sound; For there is no Trepidation which should renew it. And the
Touching of the Ordnance would not extinguish the Sound the sooner: So
that in great Sounds the Continuance is more than Momentany.</p>
<p>To try exactly the time wherein Sound is Delated. Let a Man stand in
a Steeple, and haue with him a Taper; And let some Vaile be put before
the Tapar; And let another Man stand in the Field a Mile off. Then let
him in the Steeple strike the Bell; And in the same Instant withdraw the
Vaile; And so let him in the Field tell by his Pulse what distance of
Time there is, betweene the Light seene, and the Sound heards For it is
certaine that the Delation of Light is in an Instant. This may be tried
in farre greater Distances, allowing greater Lights and Sounds.</p>
<p>It is generally knowne and obserued, that Light, and the Obiect of
Sight, moue swifter than Sound; For we see the Flash of a Peece is seene
sooner, than the Noise is heard. And in Flewing wood, if one be some
distance off, he shall see the Arme lifted vp for a second Stroke,
before he heare the Noise of the first. And the greater the Distance,
the greater is the Preuention: As we see in Thunder, which is farre off;
where the Lightning Precedeth the Cracke a good space.</p>
<p>Colours, when they represent themselues to the Eye, fade not, nor
melt not by Degrees, but appeare still in the same Strength; But Sounds
melt, and vanish, by little and little. The Cause is, for that Colours
participate nothing with the Motion of the Aire; but Sounds doe. And it
is a plaine Argument, that Sound participateth of some Locall Motion, of
the Aire, (as a Cause Sinè quônon.) in that, it perisheth so suddenly;
For in euery Section, or Impulsion of the Aire, the Aire doth suddenly
restore and reunite it selfe; which the Water also doth, but nothing so
swiftly.</p>
<p>In the Trialls of the Passage, or Not Passage of Sounds, you must
take heed, you mistake not the Passing By the Sides of a Body, for the
Passing thorow a Body: And therefore you must make the Intercepting Body
very close; For Sound will passe thorow a small Chincke.</p>
<p>Where Sound passeth thorow a Hard, or Close Body (as thorow Water;
thorow a Wall; thorow Metall, as in Hawkes Bells stopped;
andandandandc.) the Hard, or Close Body, must be but thinne and small;
For else it deadeth and extinguisheth the Sound vtterly. And therefore,
in the Experiment of Speaking in Aire vnder Water, the Voice must not be
very deepe within the Water: For then the Sound pierceth not. So if you
speake on the further side of a Close Wall, if the Wall be very thicke,
you shall not be heard: And if there were an Hogshead emptie, whereof
the Sides were some two Foot thicke, and the Bunghole stopped; I
conceiue the Resounding Sound, by the Communication of the Outward Aire,
with the Aire within, would be little or none, But onely you shall heare
the Noise of the Outward Knocke, as if the Vessell were full.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that in the Passage of Sounds thorow Hard Bodies, the
Spirit of Pneumaticall Part of the Hard body it selfe, doth cooperate;
But much better, when the Sides of that Hard Body are strucke, than when
the Percussion is onely within, without: Touch of the Sides: Take
therefore a Hawkes Bell, the holes; stopped vp, and hang it by a threed,
within a Bottle Glasse; And stop the Mouth of the Glasse, very close
with Wax; And then shake the Glasse, and see whether the Bell giue any
Sound at all, or how weake? But note, that you must in stead of the
Threed, take a Wire; Or else let the Glasse haue a great Belly; lest
when you shake the Bell, it dash vpon the Sides of the Glasse.</p>
<p>It is plaine, that a very Long, and Downe-right Arch, for the Sound
to passe, will extinguish the Sound quite; So that that Sound, which
would be heard ouer a wall, will not be heard ouer a Church; Nor that
Sound, which will be heard, if you stand some distance from the wall,
will be heard if you stand close vnder the Wall.</p>
<p>Soft and Foraminous Bodies, in the first Creation of the Sound, will
dead it; For the Striking against Cloth, or Furre, will make little
Sound; As hath beene said: But in the Passage of the Sound, they will
admit it better than Harder Bodies; As we see, that Curtaines, and
Hangings, will not stay the Sound much; But Glasse-windowes, if they be
very Close, will checke a Sound more, than the like Thicknesse of Cloth.
Wee see also, in the Rumbling of the Belly, how easily the Sound passeth
thorow the Guts, and Skin.</p>
<p>It is worthy the Enquiry, whether Great Sounds, (As of Ordnance, or
Bells,) become not more Weake, and Exile, when they passe thorow Small
Crannies. For the Subtilties of Articulate Sounds, (it may be,) may
passe thorow Small Crannies, not confused; But the Magnitude of the
Sound (perhaps,) not so well.</p>
<p>The Mediums of Sounds are Aire; Soft and Porous Bodies; Also Water.
And Hard Bodies refuse not altogether to be Mediums of Sounds. But all
of them are dull and vnapt Deferents, except the Airè.</p>
<p>In Aire, the Thinner or Drier Aire, carrieth not the Sound so well,
as the more Dense; As appeareth in Night Sounds; And Euening Sounds; And
Sounds in moist Weather, and Southerne Winds. The reason is already
mentioned in the Title of Maioration of Sounds; Being for that Thinne
Aire is better pierced; but Thicke Aire preserueth the Sound better from
Wast; Let further Triall be made by Hollowing in Mists, and Gentle
Showers: For (it may be) that will somewhat dead the Sound.</p>
<p>How farreforth Flame may be a Medium of Sounds, (especially of such
Sounds as are created by Aire, and not betwixt Hard Bodies) let it be
tried, in Speaking where a Bonsire is betweene; But then you must allow,
for some disturbance, the Noise that the Flame it selfe maketh.</p>
<p>Whether any other Liquours, being made Mediums, cause a Diuersity of
Sound from Water, it may be tried: As by the Knapping of the Tongs; Or
Striking of the Bottome of a vessell, filled either with Milke, or with
Oyle; which though they be more light, yet are they more vnequall Bodies
than Aire.</p>
<p>Of the Natures of the Mediums, we haue now spoken; As for the
Disposition of the said Mediums, it doth consist in the Penning, or not
Penning of the Aire; Of which we haue spoken before, in the Title of
Delation of Sounds: It consisteth also in the Figure of the Concaue,
through which it passeth; Of which we will speake next.</p>
<p>How the Figures of Pipes, or Concaues, through which Sounds passe; Or
of other Bodies deferent; conduce to the Varietie and Alteration of the
Sounds; Either in respect of the Greater Quantitie, or lesse Quantitie
of Aire, which the Concaues receiue; Or in respect of the Carrying of
Sounds longer or shorter way; Or in respect of many other Circumstances;
they haue beene touched, as falling into other Titles. But those
Figures, which we now are to speake of, wee intend to be, as they
concerne the Lines, through which Sound passeth; As Straight; Crooked;
Angular; Circular; andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Figure of a Bell pertaketh of the Pyramis, but yet comming off,
and dilating more suddenly. The Figure of a Hunters Horne, and Cornet,
is oblique; yet they haue likewise Straight Heroes; which if they be of
the same Bore with the Oblique, differ little in Sound; Saue that the
Straight require somewhat a stronger Blast. The Figures of Recorders,
and Flates, and Pipes are straight; But the Recorder hath a lesse Bore,
and a greater; Aboue, and below. The Trumpts hath the Figure of the
Letter S: which maketh that Purling Sound, andandandandc. Generally, the
Straight Like hath the cleanest and roundest Sound, And the Crooked the
more Hoarse, and larring.</p>
<p>Of a Sinnous Pipe, that may haue some foure Flexions, Triall would be
made, Likewise of a Pipe, made like a Crosse, open in the middest. And
so likewise of an Angular Pipe: And see what will be the Effects of
these seuerall Sounds. And so againe of a Circular Pipe; As if you take
a Pipe perfect Round, and make a Hole whereinto you shall blow; And
another Hole not farre from that; But with a Trauerse or Stope betweene
them; So that your Breath may goe the Round of the Circle, and come
forth at the second Hole. You may trie likewise Per — ssions of Solide
Bodies of seuerall Figures; As Globes, Flare, Cobes, Croffes, Triangles,
andandandandc. And their Combinasions; As Flat against Flat; And Co — ex
against Con — ; And Conn — against Flat, andandandandc. And marks well
the diversities of the Sounds. Tri —— the difference in Sound of
seuerall Crasitudre of Hard Bodies percussed; And take knowledge of the
— of the Sounds. I my selfe haue tried, that a Bell of Gold yeeldeth an
excellent Sound, not infariour to that of Siluer, or Brasse, but rather
better: yet wee see that a peece of Money of Gold soundeth farre more
flat than a peece of Money of Siluer.</p>
<p>The Harpe hath the Concaue, not along the Strings, but acrosse the
Strings; And no Instrument hath the Sound so Melting, and Prolonged, as
the Irish Harpe. So as I suppose, that if a Virginall were made with a
double Concaue; the one all the length as the Virginall hath; the other
at the End of the Strings, as the Harpe hath; It must needs make the
Sound perfecter, and not so Shallow, and Iarring. You may trie it,
without any Sound-Board along, but only Harpe-wise, at one End of the
Strings: Or lastly with a double Concaue, at Each end of the Strings
one.</p>
<p>There is an apparent Diuersitie betweene the Species Visible, and
Audible, in this; That the Visible doth not mingle in the Medium, but
the Audible doth. For if wee looke abroad, wee see Heauen, a number of
Stars, Trees, Hills, Men, Beasts, at once. And the Species of the one
doth not confound the other. But if so many Sounds came from seuerall
Parts, one of them would vtterly confound the other. So wee see, that
Voices or Consorts of Musicke doe make an Harmony by Mixture, which
Colours doe not. It is true neuerthelesse, that a great Light drowneth a
smaller, that it cannot be seene; As the Sunne that of a Gloworme; as
well as a Great Sound drowneth a lesser. And I suppose likewise, that if
there were two Lanthornes of Glasse, the one a Grimsin, and the other an
Azure, and a Candle within either of them, those Coloured Lights would
mingle and cast vpon a White Paper - Purple Colour. And euen in Colours,
they yeeld a faint and weake Mixture: For white walls make Roomes more
lightsome than blacke, andandandandc. But the Cause of the Confusion in
Sounds, and the Inconfusion in Species Visible, is, For that the Sight
worketh in Right Lines, and maketh seuerall Cones; And so there can be
no Coincidence in the Eye, or Visuall Point: But Sounds, that moue in
Oblique and Arcuate Lines, must needs encounter, and disturbe the one
the other.</p>
<p>The sweetest and best Harmony is, when euery Part, or Instrument, is
not heard by it selfe, but a Conflation of them all; Which requireth to
stand some distance off. Euen as it is in the Mixture of Perfumes; Or
the Taking of the Smells of seuerall Flowers in the Aire.</p>
<p>The Disposition of the Aire, in other Qualities, except it be ioyned
with Sound, hath no great Operation vpon Sounds: For whether the Aire be
lightsome or darke, hot or cold, quiet or stirring, (except it be with
Noise) sweet-smelling, or stinking, or the like: it importeth not much:
Some petty Alteration or difference it may make.</p>
<p>But Sounds doe disturbe and alter the one the other: Sometimes the
one drowning the other, and making it not heard; Sometimes the one
larring and discording with the other, and making a Confusion; Sometimes
the one Mingling and Compounding with the other; and making an
Harmony.</p>
<p>Two Voices of like lowdnesse, will not be heard, twice as farre, as
one of them alone; And two Candles of like light, will not make Things
seene twice as farre off, as one. The Cause is profound. But it seemeth
that the Impressions from the Obiects of the Senses, doe mingle
respectiu-ly, euery one with his kinde; But not in proportion, as is
before demonstrated: And the reason may be, because the first
Impression, which is from Priuatiue to Actiue, (As from Silence to
Noise, or from Darknesse to Light,) is a greater Degree, than from Lesse
Noise, to More Noise, or from Lesse Light, to More Light. And the Reason
of that againe may be; For that the Aire, after it hath receiued a
Charge, doth not receiue a Surcharge, or greater Charge, with like
Appetite, as it doth the first Charge. As for the Encrease of Vertue,
generally, what Proportion it beareth to the Encrease of the Matter, it
is a large Field, and to be handled by it selfe.</p>
<p>All Reflexions Concurrent doe make Sounds Greater; But if the Body
that createth, either, the Originall Sound, or the Reflexion, be cleane
and smooth, it maketh them Sweeter. Triall may be made of a Lute, or
Violl, with the Belly of polished Brasse, in stead of Wood. We see that
euen in the Open Aire, the Wire String is sweeter, than the String of
Guts. And we see that for Reflexion, Water excelleth; As in Musick neare
the Water; Or in Eccho’s.</p>
<p>It hath beene tried, that a Pipe a little moistened on the inside,
but yet so as there be no Drops left, maketh a more solemne Sound, than
if the Pipe were dry: But yet with a sweet Degree of Sibilation, or
Purling. As we touched it before in the title of Equality. The Cause is,
for that all Things Porous, being superficially wet, and (as it were)
betweene dry and wet, become a little more Euen and Smooth; But the
Purling, (which must needs proceed of Inequality,) I take to be bred
betweene the Smoothnesse of the in ward Surface of the Pipe, which is
wet; And the Rest of the Wood of the Pipe, vnto which the Wet commeth
nor, but it remaineth dry.</p>
<p>In Frosty weather, Mosicke within doores soundeth better. Which may
be, by reason, not of the Disposition of the Aire, but of the Wood or
String of the Instrument; which is made more Crispe, and so more porous
and hollow: And we see that Old Lutes sound better than New, for the
same reason. And so doe Lute Strings that haue beene kept long.</p>
<p>Sound is likewise Meliorated by the Mingling of open Aire with Pent
Aire; Therefore Triall may be made, of a Lute or Violl with a double
Belly; Making another Belly with a Knot oliet the Strings; yet so, as
there be Roome enough for the Strings, and Roome enough to play below
that Belly. Triall may be made also of an Irish Harpe, with a Concaue on
both Sides; Whereas — seth to haue it but on one Side. The doubt may be,
lest it should make too much Resounding; wherby one Note would ouertake
anot —</p>
<p>If you sing into the Hole of a Drum, it maketh the Singing more
sweet. And so I conceiue it would, if it were a Song in Parts, sung into
seuerall Drums; And for handsomnesse and strangeness sake, it would not
be amisse to haue a Curtaine betweene the Place where the Drums are, and
the Hearers.</p>
<p>When a Sound is created in a Wind-Instrument, betweene the Breath and
the Aire, yet if the Sound be communicate with a more equall Body of the
Pipe, it meliorateth the Sound. For (no doubt) there would be a
differing Sound in a Trumpet, or Pipe of Wood; And againe in a Trumpet
or Pipe of Brasse. It were good to try Recorders and Hunters Hornes of
Brasse, what the Sound would be.</p>
<p>Sounds are meliorated by the Intension of the Sense; where the Common
Sense is collected most, to the particular Sense of Hearing, and the
Sight suspended: And therefore, Sounds are sweeter, (as well as
greater,) in the Night, than in the Day; And I suppose, they are sweeter
to blinde Men, than to Others: And it is manifest, that betweene
Sleeping and Waking, (when all the Senses are bound and suspended)
Musicke is farre sweeter, than when one is fully Waking.</p>
<p>It is Thing strange in Nature, when it is attentiuely considered; How
Children, and some Birds, learne to imitate Speech. They take no Marke
(at all) of the Motion of the Mouth of Him that speaketh; For Birds are
as well taught in Darke, as by Light. The Sounds of Speech are very
Curious and Exquisite: So one would thinke it were a Lesson hard to
learne. It is true, that it is done with time, and by little and little,
and with many Essayes and Proffers: But all this dischargeth not the
Wonder. It would make a Man thinke (though this which we shall say may
seeme exceeding strange) that there is some Transmission of Spirits; and
that the Spirits of the Teacher put in Motion, should worke with the
Spirits of the Learner, a Pre-disposition to offer to Imitate; And so to
perfect the Imitation by degrees. But touching Operations by
Transmissions of Spirits, (which is one of the highest Secrets in
Nature,) we shall speake in due place; Chiefly when we come to enquire
of Imagination. But as for Imitation, it is certaine, that there is in
Men, and other Creatures, a predisposition to Imitate We see how ready
Apes and Monkies are, to imitate all Motions of Man: And in the Catching
of Dottrells, we see, how the Foolish Bird playeth the Ape in Gestures:
And no Man (in effect) doth accompany with others, but he learneth, (ere
he is aware,) some Gesture, or Voice, or Fashion of the other.</p>
<p>In Imitation of Sounds, that Man should be the Teacher, is no Part of
the Matter; For Birds will learne one of another; And there is no
Reward, by feeding, or the like, giuen them for the Imitation; And
besides, you shall haue Parrots, that will not only Iimitate Voices, but
Laughing, Knocking, Squeaking of a Doore vpon the Hinges, or of a
Cart-wheele; And (in effect) any other Noise they heare.</p>
<p>No Beast can imitate the Speech of Men, but Birds onely; For the Ape
it selfe that is so ready to imitate otherwise, attaineth not any degree
of Imitation of Speech. It is true, that I haue knowne a Dog, that if
one how led in his Eare, he would fall a how ling a great while. What
should be the Aptnesse of Birds, in comparison of Beasts, to imitate the
Speech of Man, may be further enquired. We see that Beasts haue those
Parts, which they count the Instruments of Speech, (as Lips, Teeth,
andandandandc.) liker vnto Man, than Birds. As for the Necke, by which
the Throat passeth; we see many Beasts haue it, for the Length, as much
as Birds. What better Gorge, or Attire, Birds haue, may be further
enquired. The Birds that are knowne to be Speakers, are, Parrots, Pyes,
layes, Dawes, and Rauens. Of which Parrots haue an adunque Bill, but the
rest not.</p>
<p>But I conceiue, that the Apinesse of Birds, is not so much in the
Conformitie of the Organs of Speech, as in their Attention. For Speech
must come by Hearing, and Learning; And Birds giue more heed, and marke
Sounds, more than Beasts; Because naturally they are more delighted with
them, and practise them more; As appeareth in their Singing. We see
also, that those that teach Birds to sing, doe keepe them Waking, to
increase their Attention. We see also, that Cock-Birds, amongst
SingingBirds, are euer the better Singers; which may be, because they
are more liuely, and listen more.</p>
<p>Labour, and Intention to imitate voices, doth conduce much to
Imitation: And therfore we see, that there be certaine P-nt-vimi that
will represent the voices of Players of Enterludes, so to life, as if
you see them not, you would thinke they were those Players themselues;
and so the Voices of other Men that they heare.</p>
<p>There haue beene some, that could counterfeit the Distance of Voices,
(which is a Secondary Obiect of Hearing,) in such sort; As when they
stand fast by you, you would thinke the Speech came from a farre off, in
a fearefull manner. How this is done, may be further enquired. But I see
no great vse of it, but for Imposture, in counterseiting Ghosts or
Spirits.</p>
<p>There be three Kindes of Reflexions of Sounds, A Reflexion
Concurrent; A Reflexion Iterant, which we call Eccho; And a
Super-reflexion, or an Eccho of an Eccho, wherof the first hath beene
handled in the Title of Magnitude of Sounds: The Latter two we will now
speake of.</p>
<p>The Reflexion of Species Visible, Mirrours, you may command; Because
passing in Right Lines, they may be guided to any Point: But the
Reflexion of Sounds is hard to master; Because the Sound filling great
Spaces in Arched Lines, cannot be so guided: and therfore we see there
hath not beene practised, any Meanes to make Artificiall Eccho’s. And no
Eccho already knowne returneth in a very narrow Roome.</p>
<p>The Naturall Eccho’s are made vpon Walls, Woods, Rockes, Hills, and
Banckes; As for Waters, being neare, they make a Concurrent Eccho; But
being further off, (as vpon a large Riuer) they make an Iterant Eccho:
For there is no difference betweene the Concurrent Eccho, and the
Iterant, but the Quicknesse, or Slownesse of the Returne. But there is
no doubt, but Water doth helpe the Delation of Eccho; as well as it
helpeth the Delution of Originall Sounds.</p>
<p>It is certaine, (as hath beene formerly touched,) that if you speake
thorow a Truncke, stopped at the further end, you shall finde a Blast
returne vpon your Mouth, but no Sound at all. The Cause is, for that the
Closenesse, which preferueth the Originall, is not able to preserue the
Reflected Sound: Besides that Eccho’s are seldom created, but by loud
Sounds. And therfore there is lesse hope of Artificiall Eccho’s in Aire,
pent in a narrow Concaue. Neuerthelesse it hath beene tried, that One
leaning ouer a Well, of 25. Fathome deepe, and speaking, though but
softly, (yet not so soft as a whisper,) the Water returned a good
Audible Eccho. It would be tried, whether Speaking in Caues, where there
is no Issue, faue where you speake, will not yeeld Eccho’s, as Wells
doe.</p>
<p>The Eccho commeth as the Originall Sound doth, in a Round Orbe of
Aire: It were good to try the Creating of the Eccho, where the Body
Repercussing maketh an Angle: As against the Returne of a Wall,
andandandandc. Also we see that in Mirrours, there is the like Angle of
Incidence, from the Obiect to the Glasse, and from the Glasse to the
Eye. And if you strike a Ball side-long, nor full vpon the Surface, the
Rebound will be as much the contrary way; Whether there be any such
Re-ilience in Eccho’s, (that is, whether a Man shall heare better, if he
stand aside the Body Repercussing, than if he stand where he speaketh,
or any where in a right Line betweene;) may be tried. Triall likewise
would be made, by Standing nearer the Place of Repercussing, than he
that speaketh; And againe by Standing further off, than hee that
speaketh; And so Knowledge would be taken, whether Eccho’s, as well as
Originall Sounds, be not strongest neare hand.</p>
<p>There be many Places, where you shall heare a Number of Eccho’s, one
after another: And it is, when there is Variety of Hills, or Woods, some
nearer, some further off: So that the Returne from the further, being
last created, will be likewise last heard.</p>
<p>As the Voice goeth round, as well towards the Backe, as towards the
Front of him that speaketh; So likewise doth the Eccho; For you haue
many Back-Eccho’s to the Place where you stand.</p>
<p>To make an Eccho, that will report, three, or foure, or fiue Words,
distinctly, it is requisite, that the Body Repercussing, be a good
distance off: For if it be neare, and yet not so neare, as to make a
Concurrent Eccho, it choppeth with you vpon the sudden. It is requisite
likewise, that the Aire be not much pent. For Aire, at a great distance,
pent, worketh the same effect with Aire, at large, in a small distance.
And therefore in the Triall of Speaking in the Well, though the Well was
deepe, the Voice came backe, suddenly; And would beare the Report but of
two Words.</p>
<p>For Eccho’s vpon Eccho’s, there is a rare Instance thereof in a
Place, which I will now exactly describe. It is some three or foure
Miles from Paris, neere a Towne called Pont-charenton; And some
Bird-bolt shot, or more, from the Riuer of Seane. The Roome is a
Chappell, or small Church. The Walls all standing, both at the Sides,
and at the Ends. Two Rowes of Pillars, after the manner of Isles of
Churches, also standing; The Roofe all open, not so much as any
Embowment neere any of the walls left. There was against euery Pillar, a
Stacke of Billets, aboue a Mans Height; which the Watermen, that bring
Wood downe the Seane, in Stacks, and not in Boats, laid there (as it
seemeth) for their ease. Speaking at the one End, I did heare it returne
the Voice thirteene seuerall times; And I haue heard of others, that it
would returne sixteene times: For I was there about three of the Clocke
in the Afternoone: And it is best, (as all other Eccho’s are) in the
Euening. It is manifest, that it is not Eccho’s from seuerall places,
but a Tossing of the Voice, as a Ball, to and fro; Like to Reflexions in
Looking-glasses; where if you place one Glasse before, and another
behinde, you shall see the Glasse behinde with the Image, within the
Glasse before; And againe, the Glasse before in that; and diuers such
Super-Reflexions, till the species speciei at last die. For it is euery
Returne weaker, and more shady. In like manner, the Voice in that
Chappell, createth speciem, speciei, and maketh succeeding
Super-Reflexions; For it melteth by degrees, and euery Reflexion is
weaker than the former: So that, if you speake three Words, it will
(perhaps) some three times report you the whole three Words; And then
the two latter Words for some times; And then the last Word alone for
some times; Still fading, and growing weaker. And whereas in Eccho’s of
one Returne, it is much to heare foure or fiue Words; In this Eccho of
so many Returnes, vpon the matter, you heare aboue twenty Words, for
three.</p>
<p>The like Eccho vpon Eccho, but only with two Reports, hath beene
obserued to be, if you stand betweene a House, and a Hill, and lure
towards the Hill. For the House will giue a Backe-Eccho; One taking it
from the other, and the latter the weaker.</p>
<p>There are certaine Letters, that an Eccho will hardly expresse; As S,
for one; Especially being Principiall in a Word. I remember well, that
when I went to the Eccho at Pont-Charenton, there was an Old Parisian,
that tooke it to be the Worke of Spirits, and of good Spirits. For,
(said he) call Saten, and the Eccho will not deliuer backe the Deuils
name; But will say, Va-’on; Which is as much in French, as Apage, or
A-oid. And thereby I did hap to finde, that an Eccho would not returne
S, being but a Hissing and an Interiour Sound.</p>
<p>Eccho’s are some more sudden, and chop againe, as soone as the Voice
is deliuered; As hath beene partly said: Others are more deliberate,
that is, giue more Space betweene the Voice, and the Eccho; which is
caused by the locall Nearenesse, or Distance: Some will report a longer
Traine of Words; And some a shorter: Some more loud (full as loud as the
Originall, and sometimes more loud;) And some weaker and fainter.</p>
<p>Where Eccho’s come from seuerall Parts, at the same distance, they
must needs make (as it were) a Quire of Eccho’s, and so make the Report
greater, and euen a Continued Eccho; which you shall finde in some
Hills, that stand encompassed, Theater-like.</p>
<p>It doth not yet appeare, that there is Refraction in Sounds, as well
as in Species Visible. For I doe not thinke, that if a Sound should
passe through diuers Mediums, (as Aire, Cloth, Wood) it would deliuer
the Sound, in a differing Place, from that vnto which it is deferred;
which is the Proper Effect of Refraction. But Maioration, which is also
the Worke of Refraction, appeareth plainly in Sounds, (as hath beene
handled at full;) But it is not by Diuersitie of Mediums.</p>
<p>We haue obitèr, for Demonstrations sake, vsed in diuers Instances,
the Examples of the Sight, and Things Visible, to illustrate the Nature
of Sounds. But wee thinke good now to prosecute that Comparison more
fully.</p>
