<h4 id="section">17</h4>
<p>But when I assign so prominent a part to forms, I cannot too often
warn and admonish men against applying what I say to those forms to
which their thoughts and contemplations have hitherto been
accustomed.</p>
<p>For in the first place I do not at present speak of compound forms,
which are, as I have remarked, combinations of simple natures according
to the common course of the universe: as of the lion, eagle, rose, gold,
and the like. It will be time to treat of these when we come to the
latent processes and latent configurations, and the discovery of them,
as they are found in what are called substances or natures concrete.</p>
<p>And even in the case of simple natures I would not be understood to
speak of abstract forms and ideas, either not defined in matter at all,
or ill defined. For when I speak of forms, I mean nothing more than
those laws and determinations of absolute actuality which govern and
constitute any simple nature, as heat, light, weight, in every kind of
matter and subject that is susceptible of them. Thus the form of heat or
the form of light is the same thing as the law of heat or the law of
light. Nor indeed do I ever allow myself to be drawn away from things
themselves and the operative part. And therefore when I say (for
instance) in the investigation of the form of heat, “reject rarity,” or
“rarity does not belong to the form of heat,” it is the same as if I
said, “It is possible to superinduce heat on a dense body”; or, “It is
possible to take away or keep out heat from a rare body.”</p>
<p>But if anyone conceive that my forms too are of a somewhat abstract
nature, because they mix and combine things heterogeneous (for the heat
of heavenly bodies and the heat of fire seem to be very heterogeneous;
so do the fixed red of the rose or the like, and the apparent red in the
rainbow, the opal, or the diamond; so again do the different kinds of
death: death by drowning, by hanging, by stabbing, by apoplexy, by
atrophy; and yet they agree severally in the nature of heat, redness,
death); if anyone, I say, be of this opinion, he may be assured that his
mind is held in captivity by custom, by the gross appearance of things,
and by men’s opinions. For it is most certain that these things, however
heterogeneous and alien from each other, agree in the form or law which
governs heat, redness and death; and that the power of man cannot
possibly be emancipated and freed from the common course of nature, and
expanded and exalted to new efficients and new modes of operation,
except by the revelation and discovery of forms of this kind. And yet,
when I have spoken of this union of nature, which is the point of most
importance, I shall proceed to the divisions and veins of nature, as
well the ordinary as those that are more inward and exact, and speak of
them in their place.</p>
