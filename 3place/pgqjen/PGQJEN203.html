<h4 id="section">66</h4>
<p>So much, then, for the mischievous authorities of systems, which are
founded either on common notions, or on a few experiments, or on
superstition. It remains to speak of the faulty subject matter of
contemplations, especially in natural philosophy. Now the human
understanding is infected by the sight of what takes place in the
mechanical arts, in which the alteration of bodies proceeds chiefly by
composition or separation, and so imagines that something similar goes
on in the universal nature of things. From this source has flowed the
fiction of elements, and of their concourse for the formation of natural
bodies. Again, when man contemplates nature working freely, he meets
with different species of things, of animals, of plants, of minerals;
whence he readily passes into the opinion that there are in nature
certain primary forms which nature intends to educe, and that the
remaining variety proceeds from hindrances and aberrations of nature in
the fulfillment of her work, or from the collision of different species
and the transplanting of one into another. To the first of these
speculations we owe our primary qualities of the elements; to the other
our occult properties and specific virtues; and both of them belong to
those empty compendia of thought wherein the mind rests, and whereby it
is diverted from more solid pursuits. It is to better purpose that the
physicians bestow their labor on the secondary qualities of matter, and
the operations of attraction, repulsion, attenuation, conspissation,
dilatation, astriction, dissipation, maturation, and the like; and were
it not that by those two compendia which I have mentioned (elementary
qualities, to wit, and specific virtues) they corrupted their correct
observations in these other matters — either reducing them to first
qualities and their subtle and incommensurable mixtures, or not
following them out with greater and more diligent observations to third
and fourth qualities, but breaking off the scrutiny prematurely — they
would have made much greater progress. Nor are powers of this kind (I do
not say the same, but similar) to be sought for only in the medicines of
the human body, but also in the changes of all other bodies.</p>
<p>But it is a far greater evil that they make the quiescent principles,
wherefrom, and not the moving principles, whereby, things are produced,
the object of their contemplation and inquiry. For the former tend to
discourse, the latter to works. Nor is there any value in those vulgar
distinctions of motion which are observed in the received system of
natural philosophy, as generation, corruption, augmentation, diminution,
alteration, and local motion. What they mean no doubt is this: if a body
in other respects not changed be moved from its place, this is local
motion; if without change of place or essence, it be changed in quality,
this is alteration; if by reason of the change the mass and quantity of
the body do not remain the same, this is augmentation or diminution; if
they be changed to such a degree that they change their very essence and
substance and turn to something else, this is generation and corruption.
But all this is merely popular, and does not at all go deep into nature;
for these are only measures and limits, not kinds of motion. What they
intimate is how far, not by what means, or from what source. For they do
not suggest anything with regard either to the desires of bodies or to
the development of their parts. It is only when that motion presents the
thing grossly and palpably to the sense as different from what it was
that they begin to mark the division. Even when they wish to suggest
something with regard to the causes of motion, and to establish a
division with reference to them, they introduce with the greatest
negligence a distinction between motion natural and violent, a
distinction which is itself drawn entirely from a vulgar notion, since
all violent motion is also in fact natural; the external efficient
simply setting nature working otherwise than it was before. But if,
leaving all this, anyone shall observe (for instance) that there is in
bodies a desire of mutual contact, so as not to suffer the unity of
nature to be quite separated or broken and a vacuum thus made; or if
anyone say that there is in bodies a desire of resuming their natural
dimensions or tension, so that if compressed within or extended beyond
them, they immediately strive to recover themselves, and fall back to
their old volume and extent; or if anyone say that there is in bodies a
desire of congregating toward masses of kindred nature — of dense
bodies, for instance, toward the globe of the earth, of thin and rare
bodies toward the compass of the sky; all these and the like are truly
physical kinds of motion — but those others are entirely logical and
scholastic, as is abundantly manifest from this comparison.</p>
<p>Nor again is it a lesser evil that in their philosophies and
contemplations their labor is spent in investigating and handling the
first principles of things and the highest generalities of nature;
whereas utility and the means of working result entirely from things
intermediate. Hence it is that men cease not from abstracting nature
till they come to potential and uninformed matter, nor on the other hand
from dissecting nature till they reach the atom; things which, even if
true, can do but little for the welfare of mankind.</p>
