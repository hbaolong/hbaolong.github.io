11 — The Chapter Immediately Following the Inventory; Being the 11th in
Order; a Part Thereof</h4>
<p>It appeareth then what is now in proposition not by general
circumlocution but by particular note. No former philosophy varied in
terms or method; no new PLACET or speculation upon particulars already
known; no referring to action by any manual of practice; but the
revealing and discovering of new inventions and operations. This to be
done without the errors and conjectures of art, or the length or
difficulties of experience; the nature and kinds of which inventions
have been described as they could be discovered; for your eye cannot
pass one kenning without further sailing; only we have stood upon the
best advantages of the notions received, as upon a mount, to shew the
knowledges adjacent and confining. If therefore the true end of
knowledge not propounded hath bred large error, the best and perfectest
condition of the same end not perceived will cause some declination. For
when the butt is set up men need not rove, but except the white be
placed men cannot level. This perfection we mean not in the worth of the
effect, but in the nature of the direction; for our purpose is not to
stir up men’s hopes, but to guide their travels. The fullness of
direction to work and produce any effect consisteth in two conditions,
certainty and liberty. Certainty is when the direction is not only true
for the most part, but infallible. Liberty is when the direction is not
restrained to some definite means, but comprehendeth all the means and
ways possible; for the poet saith well SAPIENTIBUS UNDIQUE LATAE SUNT
VIAE, and where there is the greatest plurality of change, there is the
greatest singularity of choice. Besides as a conjectural direction
maketh a casual effect, so a particular and restrained direction is no
less casual than an uncertain. For those particular means whereunto it
is tied may be out of your power or may be accompanied with an overvalue
of prejudice; and so if for want of certainty in direction you are
frustrated in success, for want of variety in direction you are stopped
in attempt. If therefore your direction be certain, it must refer you
and point you to somewhat which, if it be present, the effect you seek
will of necessity follow, else may you perform and not obtain. If it be
free, then must it refer you to somewhat which if it be absent the
effect you seek will of necessity withdraw, else may you have power and
not attempt. This notion Aristotle had in light, though not in use. For
the two commended rules by him set down, whereby the axioms of sciences
are precepted to be made convertible, and which the latter men have not
without elegancy surnamed the one the rule of truth because it
preventeth deceit, the other the rule of prudence because it freeth
election, are the same thing in speculation and affirmation which we now
observe. An example will make my meaning attained, and yet percase make
it thought that they attained it not. Let the effect to be produced be
Whiteness; let the first direction be that if air and water be
intermingled or broken in small portions together, whiteness will ensue,
as in snow, in the breaking of the waves of the sea and rivers, and the
like. This direction is certain, but very particular and restrained,
being tied but to air and water. Let the second direction be, that if
air be mingled as before with any transparent body, such nevertheless as
is uncoloured and more grossly transparent than air itself, that then
etc. as glass or crystal, being beaten to fine powder, by the
interposition of the air becometh white; the white of an egg being clear
of itself, receiving air by agitation becometh white, receiving air by
concoction becometh white; here you are freed from water, and advanced
to a clear body, and still tied to air. Let the third direction exclude
or remove the restraint of an uncoloured body, as in amber, sapphires,
etc. which beaten to fine powder become white; in wine and beer, which
brought to froth become white. Let the fourth direction exclude the
restraint of a body more grossly transparent than air, as in flame,
being a body compounded between air and a finer substance than air;
which flame if it were not for the smoke, which is the third substance
that incorporateth itself and dyeth the flame, would be more perfect
white. In all these four directions air still beareth a part. Let the
fifth direction then be, that if any bodies, both transparent but in an
unequal degree, be mingled as before, whiteness will follow; as oil and
water beaten to an ointment, though by settling the air which gathereth
in the agitation be evaporate, yet remaineth white; and the powder of
glass or crystal put into water, whereby the air giveth place, yet
remaineth white, though not so perfect. Now are you freed from air, but
still you are tied to transparent bodies. To ascend further by scale I
do forbear, partly because it would draw on the example to an over-great
length, but chiefly because it would open that which in this work I
determine to reserve; for to pass through the whole history and
observation of colours and objects visible were too long a digression;
and our purpose is now to give an example of a free direction, thereby
to distinguish and describe it; and not to set down a form of
interpretation how to recover and attain it. But as we intend not now to
reveal, so we are circumspect not to mislead; and therefore (this
warning being given) returning to our purpose in hand, we admit the
sixth direction to be, that all bodies or parts of bodies which are
unequal equally, that is in a simple proportion, do represent whiteness;
we will explain this, though we induce it not. It is then to be
understood, that absolute equality produceth transparence, inequality in
simple order or proportion produceth whiteness, inequality in compound
or respective order or proportion produceth all other colours, and
absolute or orderless inequality produceth blackness; which diversity,
if so gross a demonstration be needful, may be signified by four tables;
a blank, a chequer, a fret, and a medley; whereof the fret is evident to
admit great variety. Out of this assertion are satisfied a multitude of
effects and observations, as that whiteness and blackness are most
incompatible with transparence; that whiteness keepeth light, and
blackness stoppeth light, but neither passeth it; that whiteness or
blackness are never produced in rainbows, diamonds, crystals, and the
like; that white giveth no dye, and black hardly taketh dye; that
whiteness seemeth to have an affinity with dryness, and blackness with
moisture; that adustion causeth blackness, and calcination whiteness;
that flowers are generally of fresh colours, and rarely black, etc. All
which I do now mention confusedly by way of derivation and not by way of
induction. This sixth direction, which I have thus explained, is of good
and competent liberty for whiteness fixed and inherent, but not for
whiteness fantastical or appearing, as shall be afterwards touched. But
first do you need a reduction back to certainty or verity; for it is not
all position or contexture of unequal bodies that will produce colour;
for AQUA FORTIS, oil of VITRIOL, etc. more manifestly, and many other
substances more obscurely, do consist of very unequal parts, which yet
are transparent and clear. Therefore the reduction must be, that the
bodies or parts of bodies so intermingled as before be of a certain
grossness or magnitude; for the unequalities which move the sight must
have a further dimension and quantity than those which operate many
other effects. Some few grains of saffron will give a tincture to a tun
of water; but so many grains of civet will give a perfume to a whole
chamber of air. And therefore when Democritus (from whom Epicurus did
borrow it) held that the position of the solid portions was the cause of
colours, yet in the very truth of his assertion he should have added,
that the portions are required to be of some magnitude. And this is one
cause why colours have little inwardness and necessitude with the nature
and proprieties of things, those things resembling in colour which
otherwise differ most, as salt and sugar, and contrariwise differing in
colour which otherwise resemble most, as the white and blue violets, and
the several veins of one agate or marble, by reason that other virtues
consist in more subtile proportions than colours do; and yet are there
virtues and natures which require a grosser magnitude than colours, as
well as scents and divers other require a more subtile; for as the
portion of a body will give forth scent which is too small to be seen,
so the portion of a body will shew colours which is too small to be
endued with weight; and therefore one of the prophets with great
elegancy describing how all creatures carry no proportion towards God
the creator, saith, THAT ALL THE NATIONS IN RESPECT OF HIM ARE LIKE THE
DUST UPON THE BALANCE, which is a thing appeareth but weigheth not. But
to return, there resteth a further freeing of this sixth direction; for
the clearness of a river or stream sheweth white at a distance, and
crystalline glasses deliver the face or any other object falsified in
whiteness, and long beholding the snow to a weak eye giveth an
impression of azure rather than of whiteness. So as for whiteness in
apparition only and representation by the qualifying of the light,
altering the INTERMEDIUM, or affecting the eye itself, it reacheth not.
But you must free your direction to the producing of such an incidence,
impression, or operation, as may cause a precise and determinate passion
of the eye; a matter which is much more easy to induce than that which
we have passed through; but yet because it hath a full coherence both
with that act of radiation (which hath hitherto been conceived and
termed so unproperly and untruly by some an effluxion of spiritual
species and by others an investing of the INTERMEDIUM with a motion
which successively is conveyed to the eye) and with the act of sense,
wherein I should likewise open that which I think good to withdraw, I
will omit. Neither do I contend but that this motion which I call the
freeing of a direction, in the received philosophies (as far as a
swimming anticipation could take hold) might be perceived and discerned;
being not much other matter than that which they did not only aim at in
the two rules of AXIOMS before remembered, but more nearly also in that
which they term the form or formal cause, or that which they call the
true difference; both which nevertheless it seemeth they propound rather
as impossibilities and wishes than as things within the compass of human
comprehension. For Plato casteth his burden and saith THAT HE WILL
REVERE HIM AS A GOD, THAT CAN TRULY DIVIDE AND DEFINE; which cannot be
but by true forms and differences. Wherein I join hands with him,
confessing as much as yet assuming to myself little; for if any man call
by the strength of his ANTICIPATIONS find out forms, I will magnify him
with the foremost. But as any of them would say that if divers things
which many men know by instruction and observation another knew by
revelation and without those means, they would take him for somewhat
supernatural and divine; so I do acknowledge that if any man can by
anticipations reach to that which a weak and inferior wit may attain to
by interpretation, he cannot receive too high a title. Nay I for my part
do indeed admire to see how far some of them have proceeded by their
ANTICIPATIONS; but how? It is as I wonder at some blind men, to see what
shift they make without their eye-sight; thinking with myself that if I
were blind I could hardly do it. Again Aristotle’s school confesseth
that there is no true knowledge but by causes, no true cause but the
form, no true form known except one, which they are pleased to allow;
and therefore thus far their evidence standeth with us, that both
hitherto there hath been nothing but a shadow of knowledge, and that we
propound now that which is agreed to be worthiest to be sought, and
hardest to be found. There wanteth now a part very necessary, not by way
of supply but by way of caution; for as it is seen for the most part
that the outward tokens and badges of excellency and perfection are more
incident to things merely counterfeit than to that which is true, but
for a meaner and baser sort; as a dubline is more like a perfect ruby
than a spinel, and a counterfeit angel is made more like a true angel
than if it were an angel coined of China gold; in like manner the
direction carrieth a resemblance of a true direction in verity and
liberty which indeed is no direction at all. For though your direction
seem to be certain and free by pointing you to a nature that is
unseparable from the nature you inquire upon, yet if it do not carry you
on a degree or remove nearer to action, operation, or light to make or
produce, it is but superficial and counterfeit. Wherefore to secure and
warrant what is a true direction, though that general note I have given
be perspicuous in itself (for a man shall soon cast with himself whether
he be ever the nearer to effect and operate or no, or whether he have
won but an abstract or varied notion) yet for better instruction I will
deliver three particular notes of caution. The first is that the nature
discovered be more original than the nature supposed, and not more
secondary or of the like degree; as to make a stone bright or to make it
smooth it is a good direction to say, make it even; but to make a stone
even it is no good direction to say, make it bright or make it smooth;
for the rule is that the disposition of any thing referring to the state
of it in itself or the parts, is more original than that which is
relative or transitive towards another thing. So evenness is the
disposition of the stone in itself, but smooth is to the hand and bright
to the eye, and yet nevertheless they all cluster and concur; and yet
the direction is more unperfect, if it do appoint you to such a relative
as is in the same kind and not in a diverse. For in the direction to
produce brightness by smoothness, although properly it win no degree,
and will never teach you any new particulars before unknown; yet by way
of suggestion or bringing to mind it may draw your consideration to some
particulars known but not remembered; as you shall sooner remember some
practical means of making smoothness, than if you had fixed your
consideration only upon brightness by making reflexion, as thus, make it
such as you may see your face in it, this is merely secondary, and
helpeth neither by way of informing nor by way of suggestion. So if in
the inquiry of whiteness you were directed to make such a colour as
should be seen furthest in a dark light; here you are advanced nothing
at all. For these kinds of natures are but proprieties, effects,
circumstances, concurrences, or what else you shall like to call them,
and not radical and formative natures towards the nature supposed. The
second caution is that the nature inquired be collected by division
before composition, or to speak more properly, by composition subaltern
before you ascend to composition absolute, etc.</p>
<p>OF THE INTERNAL AND PROFOUND ERRORS AND SUPERSTITIONS IN THE NATURE
OF THE MIND, AND OF THE FOUR SORTS OF IDOLS OR FICTIONS WHICH OFFER
THEMSELVES TO THE UNDERSTANDING IN THE INQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE; BEING
THE 16TH CHAPTER, AND THIS A SMALL FRAGMENT THEREOF, BEING A PREFACE TO
THE INWARD ELENCHES OF THE MIND.</p>
<p>The opinion of Epicurus that the gods were of human shape, was rather
justly derided than seriously confuted by the other sects, demanding
whether every kind of sensible creatures did not think their own figure
fairest, as the horse, the bull, and the like, which found no beauty but
in their own forms, as in appetite of lust appeared. And the heresy of
the Anthropomorphites was ever censured for a gross conceit bred in the
obscure cells of solitary monks that never looked abroad. Again the
fable so well known of QUIS PINXIT LEONEM, doth set forth well that
there is an error of pride and partiality, as well as of custom and
familiarity. The reflexion also from glasses so usually resembled to the
imagery of the mind, every man knoweth to receive error and variety both
in colour, magnitude, and shape, according to the quality of the glass.
But yet no use hath been made of these and many the like observations,
to move men to search out and upon search to give true cautions of the
native and inherent errors in the mind of man which have coloured and
corrupted all his notions and impressions.</p>
<p>I do find therefore in this enchanted glass four Idols or false
appearances of several and distinct sorts, every sort comprehending many
subdivisions: the first sort, I call idols of the NATION or TRIBE; the
second, idols of the PALACE; the third, idols of the CAVE; and the
fourth, idols of the THEATRE, etc.</p>
