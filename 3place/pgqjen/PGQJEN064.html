<h4 id="preface">PREFACE</h4>
<p>They who have presumed to dogmatize on nature, as on some well
investigated subject, either from self-conceit or arrogance, and in the
professorial style, have inflicted the greatest injury on philosophy and
learning. For they have tended to stifle and interrupt inquiry exactly
in proportion as they have prevailed in bringing others to their
opinion: and their own activity has not counterbalanced the mischief
they have occasioned by corrupting and destroying that of others. They
again who have entered upon a contrary course, and asserted that nothing
whatever can be known, whether they have fallen into this opinion from
their hatred of the ancient sophists, or from the hesitation of their
minds, or from an exuberance of learning, have certainly adduced reasons
for it which are by no means contemptible. They have not, however,
derived their opinion from true sources, and, hurried on by their zeal
and some affectation, have certainly exceeded due moderation. But the
more ancient Greeks (whose writings have perished), held a more prudent
mean, between the arrogance of dogmatism, and the despair of scepticism;
and though too frequently intermingling complaints and indignation at
the difficulty of inquiry, and the obscurity of things, and champing, as
it were, the bit, have still persisted in pressing their point, and
pursuing their intercourse with nature; thinking, as it seems, that the
better method was not to dispute upon the very point of the possibility
of anything being known, but to put it to the test of experience. Yet
they themselves, by only employing the power of the understanding, have
not adopted a fixed rule, but have laid their whole stress upon intense
meditation, and a continual exercise and perpetual agitation of the
mind.</p>
<p>Our method, though difficult in its operation, is easily explained.
It consists in determining the degrees of certainty, while we, as it
were, restore the senses to their former rank, but generally reject that
operation of the mind which follows close upon the senses, and open and
establish a new and certain course for the mind from the first actual
perceptions of the senses themselves. This, no doubt, was the view taken
by those who have assigned so much to logic; showing clearly thereby
that they sought some support for the mind, and suspected its natural
and spontaneous mode of action. But this is now employed too late as a
remedy, when all is clearly lost, and after the mind, by the daily habit
and intercourse of life, has come prepossessed with corrupted doctrines,
and filled with the vainest idols. The art of logic therefore being (as
we have mentioned), too late a precaution,1 and in no way remedying the
matter, has tended more to confirm errors, than to disclose truth. Our
only remaining hope and salvation is to begin the whole labor of the
mind again; not leaving it to itself, but directing it perpetually from
the very first, and attaining our end as it were by mechanical aid. If
men, for instance, had attempted mechanical labors with their hands
alone, and without the power and aid of instruments, as they have not
hesitated to carry on the labors of their understanding with the unaided
efforts of their mind, they would have been able to move and overcome
but little, though they had exerted their utmost and united powers. And
just to pause awhile on this comparison, and look into it as a mirror;
let us ask, if any obelisk of a remarkable size were perchance required
to be moved, for the purpose of gracing a triumph or any similar
pageant, and men were to attempt it with their bare hands, would not any
sober spectator avow it to be an act of the greatest madness? And if
they should increase the number of workmen, and imagine that they could
thus succeed, would he not think so still more? But if they chose to
make a selection, and to remove the weak, and only employ the strong and
vigorous, thinking by this means, at any rate, to achieve their object,
would he not say that they were more fondly deranged? Nay, if not
content with this, they were to determine on consulting the athletic
art, and were to give orders for all to appear with their hands, arms,
and muscles regularly oiled and prepared, would he not exclaim that they
were taking pains to rave by method and design? Yet men are hurried on
with the same senseless energy and useless combination in intellectual
matters, as long as they expect great results either from the number and
agreement, or the excellence and acuteness of their wits; or even
strengthen their minds with logic, which may be considered as an
athletic preparation, but yet do not desist (if we rightly consider the
matter) from applying their own understandings merely with all this zeal
and effort. While nothing is more clear, than that in every great work
executed by the hand of man without machines or implements, it is
impossible for the strength of individuals to be increased, or for that
of the multitude to combine.</p>
<p>Having premised so much, we lay down two points on which we would
admonish mankind, lest they should fail to see or to observe them. The
first of these is, that it is our good fortune (as we consider it), for
the sake of extinguishing and removing contradiction and irritation of
mind, to leave the honor and reverence due to the ancients untouched and
undiminished, so that we can perform our intended work, and yet enjoy
the benefit of our respectful moderation. For if we should profess to
offer something better than the ancients, and yet should pursue the same
course as they have done, we could never, by any artifice, contrive to
avoid the imputation of having engaged in a contest or rivalry as to our
respective wits, excellences, or talents; which, though neither
inadmissible nor new (for why should we not blame and point out anything
that is imperfectly discovered or laid down by them, of our own right, a
right common to all?), yet however just and allowable, would perhaps be
scarcely an equal match, on account of the disproportion of our
strength. But since our present plan leads up to open an entirely
different course to the understanding, and one unattempted and unknown
to them, the case is altered. There is an end to party zeal, and we only
take upon ourselves the character of a guide, which requires a moderate
share of authority and good fortune, rather than talents and excellence.
The first admonition relates to persons, the next to things.</p>
<p>We make no attempt to disturb the system of philosophy that now
prevails, or any other which may or will exist, either more correct or
more complete. For we deny not that the received system of philosophy,
and others of a similar nature, encourage discussion, embellish
harangues, are employed, and are of service in the duties of the
professor, and the affairs of civil life. Nay, we openly express and
declare that the philosophy we offer will not be very useful in such
respects. It is not obvious, nor to be understood in a cursory view, nor
does it flatter the mind in its preconceived notions, nor will it
descend to the level of the generality of mankind unless by its
advantages and effects.</p>
<p>Let there exist then (and may it be of advantage to both), two
sources, and two distributions of learning, and in like manner two
tribes, and as it were kindred families of contemplators or
philosophers, without any hostility or alienation between them; but
rather allied and united by mutual assistance. Let there be in short one
method of cultivating the sciences, and another of discovering them. And
as for those who prefer and more readily receive the former, on account
of their haste or from motives arising from their ordinary life, or
because they are unable from weakness of mind to comprehend and embrace
the other (which must necessarily be the case with by far the greater
number), let us wish that they may prosper as they desire in their
undertaking, and attain what they pursue. But if any individual desire,
and is anxious not merely to adhere to, and make use of present
discoveries, but to penetrate still further, and not to overcome his
adversaries in disputes, but nature by labor, not in short to give
elegant and specious opinions, but to know to a certainty and
demonstration, let him, as a true son of science (if such be his wish),
join with us; that when he has left the antechambers of nature trodden
by the multitude, an entrance may at last be discovered to her inner
apartments. And in order to be better understood, and to render our
meaning more familiar by assigning determinate names, we have accustomed
ourselves to call the one method the anticipation of the mind, and the
other the interpretation of nature.</p>
<p>We have still one request left. We have at least reflected and taken
pains in order to render our propositions not only true, but of easy and
familiar access to men’s minds, however wonderfully prepossessed and
limited. Yet it is but just that we should obtain this favor from
mankind (especially in so great a restoration of learning and the
sciences), that whosoever may be desirous of forming any determination
upon an opinion of this our work either from his own perceptions, or the
crowd of authorities, or the forms of demonstrations, he will not expect
to be able to do so in a cursory manner, and while attending to other
matters; but in order to have a thorough knowledge of the subject, will
himself by degrees attempt the course which we describe and maintain;
will be accustomed to the subtilty of things which is manifested by
experience; and will correct the depraved and deeply rooted habits of
his mind by a seasonable, and, as it were, just hesitation: and then,
finally (if he will), use his judgment when he has begun to be master of
himself.</p>
<p>ENDNOTE.</p>
<p>1 Because it was idle to draw a logical conclusion from false
principles, error being propagated as much by false premises, which
logic does not pretend to examine, as by illegitimate inference. Hence,
as Bacon says further on, men being easily led to confound legitimate
inference with truth, were confirmed in their errors by the very
subtilty of their genius. — Ed.</p>
<p>APHORISMS — BOOK I. ON THE INTERPRETATION OF NATURE AND THE EMPIRE OF
MAN</p>
<p>I. Man, as the minister and interpreter of nature, does and
understands as much as his observations on the order of nature, either
with regard to things or the mind, permit him, and neither knows nor is
capable of more.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li><p>The unassisted hand and the understanding left to itself possess
but little power. Effects are produced by the means of instruments and
helps, which the understanding requires no less than the hand; and as
instruments either promote or regulate the motion of the hand, so those
that are applied to the mind prompt or protect the
understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowledge and human power are synonymous, since the ignorance of
the cause frustrates the effect; for nature is only subdued by
submission, and that which in contemplative philosophy corresponds with
the cause in practical science becomes the rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Man while operating can only apply or withdraw natural bodies;
nature internally performs the rest.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>V. Those who become practically versed in nature are, the mechanic,
the mathematician, the physician, the alchemist, and the magician,2 but
all (as matters now stand) with faint efforts and meagre success.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li><p>It would be madness and inconsistency to suppose that things
which have never yet been performed can be performed without employing
some hitherto untried means.</p></li>
<li><p>The creations of the mind and hand appear very numerous, if we
judge by books and manufactures; but all that variety consists of an
excessive refinement, and of deductions from a few well known matters —
not of a number of axioms.3</p></li>
<li><p>Even the effects already discovered are due to chance and
experiment rather than to the sciences; for our present sciences are
nothing more than peculiar arrangements of matters already discovered,
and not methods for discovery or plans for new operations.</p></li>
<li><p>The sole cause and root of almost every defect in the sciences is
this, that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human
mind, we do not search for its real helps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>X. The subtilty of nature is far beyond that of sense or of the
understanding: so that the specious meditations, speculations, and
theories of mankind are but a kind of insanity, only there is no one to
stand by and observe it.</p>
<ol start="11" type="I">
<li><p>As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects,
so the present system of logic4 is useless for the discovery of the
sciences.</p></li>
<li><p>The present system of logic rather assists in confirming and
rendering inveterate the errors founded on vulgar notions than in
searching after truth, and is therefore more hurtful than
useful.</p></li>
<li><p>The syllogism is not applied to the principles of the sciences,
and is of no avail in intermediate axioms,5 as being very unequal to the
subtilty of nature. It forces assent, therefore, and not
things.</p></li>
<li><p>The syllogism consists of propositions; propositions of words;
words are the signs of notions. If, therefore, the notions (which form
the basis of the whole) be confused and carelessly abstracted from
things, there is no solidity in the superstructure. Our only hope, then,
is in genuine induction.</p></li>
<li><p>We have no sound notions either in logic or physics; substance,
quality, action, passion, and existence are not clear notions; much less
weight, levity, density, tenuity, moisture, dryness, generation,
corruption, attraction, repulsion, element, matter, form, and the like.
They are all fantastical and ill-defined.</p></li>
<li><p>The notions of less abstract natures, as man, dog, dove, and the
immediate perceptions of sense, as heat, cold, white, black, do not
deceive us materially, yet even these are sometimes confused by the
mutability of matter and the intermixture of things. All the rest which
men have hitherto employed are errors, and improperly abstracted and
deduced from things.</p></li>
<li><p>There is the same degree of licentiousness and error in forming
axioms as in abstracting notions, and that in the first principles,
which depend on common induction; still more is this the case in axioms
and inferior propositions derived from syllogisms.</p></li>
<li><p>The present discoveries in science are such as lie immediately
beneath the surface of common notions. It is necessary, however, to
penetrate the more secret and remote parts of nature, in order to
abstract both notions and axioms from things by a more certain and
guarded method.</p></li>
<li><p>There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and
discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and
particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and
their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the
intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs
its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and
gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is
the true but unattempted way.</p></li>
<li><p>The understanding when left to itself proceeds by the same way as
that which it would have adopted under the guidance of logic, namely,
the first; for the mind is fond of starting off to generalities, that it
may avoid labor, and after dwelling a little on a subject is fatigued by
experiment. But those evils are augmented by logic, for the sake of the
ostentation of dispute.</p></li>
<li><p>The understanding, when left to itself in a man of a steady,
patient, and reflecting disposition (especially when unimpeded by
received doctrines), makes some attempt in the right way, but with
little effect, since the understanding, undirected and unassisted, is
unequal to and unfit for the task of vanquishing the obscurity of
things.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars,
and ends in the greatest generalities. But they are immeasurably
different; for the one merely touches cursorily the limits of experiment
and particulars, while the other runs duly and regularly through them —
the one from the very outset lays down some abstract and useless
generalities, the other gradually rises to those principles which are
really the most common in nature.6</p></li>
<li><p>There is no small difference between the idols of the human mind
and the ideas of the Divine mind — that is to say, between certain idle
dogmas and the real stamp and impression of created objects, as they are
found in nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Axioms determined upon in argument can never assist in the
discovery of new effects; for the subtilty of nature is vastly superior
to that of argument. But axioms properly and regularly abstracted from
particulars easily point out and define new particulars, and therefore
impart activity to the sciences.</p></li>
<li><p>The axioms now in use are derived from a scanty handful, as it
were, of experience, and a few particulars of frequent occurrence,
whence they are of much the same dimensions or extent as their origin.
And if any neglected or unknown instance occurs, the axiom is saved by
some frivolous distinction, when it would be more consistent with truth
to amend it.</p></li>
<li><p>We are wont, for the sake of distinction, to call that human
reasoning which we apply to nature the anticipation of nature (as being
rash and premature), and that which is properly deduced from things the
interpretation of nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Anticipations are sufficiently powerful in producing unanimity,
for if men were all to become even uniformly mad, they might agree
tolerably well with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Anticipations again, will be assented to much more readily than
interpretations, because being deduced from a few instances, and these
principally of familiar occurrence, they immediately hit the
understanding and satisfy the imagination; while, on the contrary,
interpretations, being deduced from various subjects, and these widely
dispersed, cannot suddenly strike the understanding, so that in common
estimation they must appear difficult and discordant, and almost like
the mysteries of faith.</p></li>
<li><p>In sciences founded on opinions and dogmas, it is right to make
use of anticipations and logic if you wish to force assent rather than
things.</p></li>
<li><p>If all the capacities of all ages should unite and combine and
transmit their labors, no great progress will be made in learning by
anticipations, because the radical errors, and those which occur in the
first process of the mind, are not cured by the excellence of subsequent
means and remedies.</p></li>
<li><p>It is in vain to expect any great progress in the sciences by the
superinducing or ingrafting new matters upon old. An instauration must
be made from the very foundations, if we do not wish to revolve forever
in a circle, making only some slight and contemptible progress.</p></li>
<li><p>The ancient authors and all others are left in undisputed
possession of their honors; for we enter into no comparison of capacity
or talent, but of method, and assume the part of a guide rather than of
a critic.</p></li>
<li><p>To speak plainly, no correct judgment can be formed either of our
method or its discoveries by those anticipations which are now in common
use; for it is not to be required of us to submit ourselves to the
judgment of the very method we ourselves arraign.</p></li>
<li><p>Nor is it an easy matter to deliver and explain our sentiments;
for those things which are in themselves new can yet be only understood
from some analogy to what is old.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander Borgia7 said of the expedition of the French into Italy
that they came with chalk in their hands to mark up their lodgings, and
not with weapons to force their passage. Even so do we wish our
philosophy to make its way quietly into those minds that are fit for it,
and of good capacity; for we have no need of contention where we differ
in first principles, and in our very notions, and even in our forms of
demonstration.</p></li>
<li><p>We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments,
namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and
order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to
form an acquaintance with things.</p></li>
<li><p>Our method and that of the sceptics8 agree in some respects at
first setting out, but differ most widely, and are completely opposed to
each other in their conclusion; for they roundly assert that nothing can
be known; we, that but a small part of nature can be known, by the
present method; their next step, however, is to destroy the authority of
the senses and understanding, while we invent and supply them with
assistance.</p></li>
<li><p>The idols and false notions which have already preoccupied the
human understanding, and are deeply rooted in it, not only so beset
men’s minds that they become difficult of access, but even when access
is obtained will again meet and trouble us in the instauration of the
sciences, unless mankind when forewarned guard themselves with all
possible care against them.</p></li>
<li><p>Four species of idols beset the human mind,9 to which (for
distinction’s sake) we have assigned names, calling the first Idols of
the Tribe, the second Idols of the Den, the third Idols of the Market,
the fourth Idols of the Theatre.</p></li>
<li><p>The formation of notions and axioms on the foundation of true
induction is the only fitting remedy by which we can ward off and expel
these idols. It is, however, of great service to point them out; for the
doctrine of idols bears the same relation to the interpretation of
nature as that of the confutation of sophisms does to common
logic.10</p></li>
<li><p>The idols of the tribe are inherent in human nature and the very
tribe or race of man; for man’s sense is falsely asserted to be the
standard of things; on the contrary, all the perceptions both of the
senses and the mind bear reference to man and not to the universe, and
the human mind resembles those uneven mirrors which impart their own
properties to different objects, from which rays are emitted and distort
and disfigure them.11</p></li>
<li><p>The idols of the den are those of each individual; for everybody
(in addition to the errors common to the race of man) has his own
individual den or cavern, which intercepts and corrupts the light of
nature, either from his own peculiar and singular disposition, or from
his education and intercourse with others, or from his reading, and the
authority acquired by those whom he reverences and admires, or from the
different impressions produced on the mind, as it happens to be
preoccupied and predisposed, or equable and tranquil, and the like; so
that the spirit of man (according to its several dispositions), is
variable, confused, and as it were actuated by chance; and Heraclitus
said well that men search for knowledge in lesser worlds, and not in the
greater or common world.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also idols formed by the reciprocal intercourse and
society of man with man, which we call idols of the market, from the
commerce and association of men with each other; for men converse by
means of language, but words are formed at the will of the generality,
and there arises from a bad and unapt formation of words a wonderful
obstruction to the mind. Nor can the definitions and explanations with
which learned men are wont to guard and protect themselves in some
instances afford a complete remedy — words still manifestly force the
understanding, throw everything into confusion, and lead mankind into
vain and innumerable controversies and fallacies.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, there are idols which have crept into men’s minds from
the various dogmas of peculiar systems of philosophy, and also from the
perverted rules of demonstration, and these we denominate idols of the
theatre: for we regard all the systems of philosophy hitherto received
or imagined, as so many plays brought out and performed, creating
fictitious and theatrical worlds. Nor do we speak only of the present
systems, or of the philosophy and sects of the ancients, since numerous
other plays of a similar nature can be still composed and made to agree
with each other, the causes of the most opposite errors being generally
the same. Nor, again, do we allude merely to general systems, but also
to many elements and axioms of sciences which have become inveterate by
tradition, implicit credence, and neglect. We must, however, discuss
each species of idols more fully and distinctly in order to guard the
human understanding against them.</p></li>
<li><p>The human understanding, from its peculiar nature, easily
supposes a greater degree of order and equality in things than it really
finds; and although many things in nature be sui generis and most
irregular, will yet invent parallels and conjugates and relatives, where
no such thing is. Hence the fiction, that all celestial bodies move in
perfect circles, thus rejecting entirely spiral and serpentine lines
(except as explanatory terms).12 Hence also the element of fire is
introduced with its peculiar orbit,13 to keep square with those other
three which are objects of our senses. The relative rarity of the
elements (as they are called) is arbitrarily made to vary in tenfold
progression, with many other dreams of the like nature.14 Nor is this
folly confined to theories, but it is to be met with even in simple
notions.</p></li>
<li><p>The human understanding, when any proposition has been once laid
down (either from general admission and belief, or from the pleasure it
affords), forces everything else to add fresh support and confirmation;
and although most cogent and abundant instances may exist to the
contrary, yet either does not observe or despises them, or gets rid of
and rejects them by some distinction, with violent and injurious
prejudice, rather than sacrifice the authority of its first conclusions.
It was well answered by him15 who was shown in a temple the votive
tablets suspended by such as had escaped the peril of shipwreck, and was
pressed as to whether he would then recognize the power of the gods, by
an inquiry, But where are the portraits of those who have perished in
spite of their vows? All superstition is much the same, whether it be
that of astrology, dreams, omens, retributive judgment, or the like, in
all of which the deluded believers observe events which are fulfilled,
but neglect and pass over their failure, though it be much more common.
But this evil insinuates itself still more craftily in philosophy and
the sciences, in which a settled maxim vitiates and governs every other
circumstance, though the latter be much more worthy of confidence.
Besides, even in the absence of that eagerness and want of thought
(which we have mentioned), it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the
human understanding to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than
negatives, whereas it ought duly and regularly to be impartial; nay, in
establishing any true axiom the negative instance is the most
powerful.</p></li>
<li><p>The human understanding is most excited by that which strikes and
enters the mind at once and suddenly, and by which the imagination is
immediately filled and inflated. It then begins almost imperceptibly to
conceive and suppose that everything is similar to the few objects which
have taken possession of the mind, while it is very slow and unfit for
the transition to the remote and heterogeneous instances by which axioms
are tried as by fire, unless the office be imposed upon it by severe
regulations and a powerful authority.</p></li>
<li><p>The human understanding is active and cannot halt or rest, but
even, though without effect, still presses forward. Thus we cannot
conceive of any end or external boundary of the world, and it seems
necessarily to occur to us that there must be something beyond. Nor can
we imagine how eternity has flowed on down to the present day, since the
usually received distinction of an infinity, a parte ante and a parte
post,16 cannot hold good; for it would thence follow that one infinity
is greater than another, and also that infinity is wasting away and
tending to an end. There is the same difficulty in considering the
infinite divisibility of lines, arising from the weakness of our minds,
which weakness interferes to still greater disadvantage with the
discovery of causes; for although the greatest generalities in nature
must be positive, just as they are found, and in fact not causable, yet
the human understanding, incapable of resting, seeks for something more
intelligible. Thus, however, while aiming at further progress, it falls
back to what is actually less advanced, namely, final causes; for they
are clearly more allied to man’s own nature, than the system of the
universe, and from this source they have wonderfully corrupted
philosophy. But he would be an unskilful and shallow philosopher who
should seek for causes in the greatest generalities, and not be anxious
to discover them in subordinate objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The human understanding resembles not a dry light, but admits a
tincture of the will17 and passions, which generate their own system
accordingly; for man always believes more readily that which he prefers.
He, therefore, rejects difficulties for want of patience in
investigation; sobriety, because it limits his hope; the depths of
nature, from superstition; the light of experiment, from arrogance and
pride, lest his mind should appear to be occupied with common and
varying objects; paradoxes, from a fear of the opinion of the vulgar; in
short, his feelings imbue and corrupt his understanding in innumerable
and sometimes imperceptible ways.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>L. But by far the greatest impediment and aberration of the human
understanding proceeds from the dulness, incompetence, and errors of the
senses; since whatever strikes the senses preponderates over everything,
however superior, which does not immediately strike them. Hence
contemplation mostly ceases with sight, and a very scanty, or perhaps no
regard is paid to invisible objects. The entire operation, therefore, of
spirits inclosed in tangible bodies18 is concealed, and escapes us. All
that more delicate change of formation in the parts of coarser
substances (vulgarly called alteration, but in fact a change of position
in the smallest particles) is equally unknown; and yet, unless the two
matters we have mentioned be explored and brought to light, no great
effect can be produced in nature. Again, the very nature of common air,
and all bodies of less density (of which there are many) is almost
unknown; for the senses are weak and erring, nor can instruments be of
great use in extending their sphere or acuteness — all the better
interpretations of nature are worked out by instances, and fit and apt
experiments, where the senses only judge of the experiment, the
experiment of nature and the thing itself.</p>
<ol start="51" type="I">
<li><p>The human understanding is, by its own nature, prone to
abstraction, and supposes that which is fluctuating to be fixed. But it
is better to dissect than abstract nature: such was the method employed
by the school of Democritus,19 which made greater progress in
penetrating nature than the rest. It is best to consider matter, its
conformation, and the changes of that conformation, its own action,20
and the law of this action or motion; for forms are a mere fiction of
the human mind, unless you will call the laws of action by that
name.21</p></li>
<li><p>Such are the idols of the tribe, which arise either from the
uniformity of the constitution of man’s spirit, or its prejudices, or
its limited faculties or restless agitation, or from the interference of
the passions, or the incompetence of the senses, or the mode of their
impressions.</p></li>
<li><p>The idols of the den derive their origin from the peculiar nature
of each individual’s mind and body, and also from education, habit, and
accident; and although they be various and manifold, yet we will treat
of some that require the greatest caution, and exert the greatest power
in polluting the understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Some men become attached to particular sciences and
contemplations, either from supposing themselves the authors and
inventors of them, or from having bestowed the greatest pains upon such
subjects, and thus become most habituated to them.22 If men of this
description apply themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a
universal nature, they wrest and corrupt them by their preconceived
fancies, of which Aristotle affords us a single instance, who made his
natural philosophy completely subservient to his logic, and thus
rendered it little more than useless and disputatious. The chemists,
again, have formed a fanciful philosophy with the most confined views,
from a few experiments of the furnace. Gilbert,23 too, having employed
himself most assiduously in the consideration of the magnet, immediately
established a system of philosophy to coincide with his favorite
pursuit.</p></li>
<li><p>The greatest and, perhaps, radical distinction between different
men’s dispositions for philosophy and the sciences is this, that some
are more vigorous and active in observing the differences of things,
others in observing their resemblances; for a steady and acute
disposition can fix its thoughts, and dwell upon and adhere to a point,
through all the refinements of differences, but those that are sublime
and discursive recognize and compare even the most delicate and general
resemblances; each of them readily falls into excess, by catching either
at nice distinctions or shadows of resemblance.</p></li>
<li><p>Some dispositions evince an unbounded admiration of antiquity,
others eagerly embrace novelty, and but few can preserve the just
medium, so as neither to tear up what the ancients have correctly laid
down, nor to despise the just innovations of the moderns. But this is
very prejudicial to the sciences and philosophy, and instead of a
correct judgment we have but the factions of the ancients and moderns.
Truth is not to be sought in the good fortune of any particular
conjuncture of time, which is uncertain, but in the light of nature and
experience, which is eternal. Such factions, therefore, are to be
abjured, and the understanding must not allow them to hurry it on to
assent.</p></li>
<li><p>The contemplation of nature and of bodies in their individual
form distracts and weakens the understanding; but the contemplation of
nature and of bodies in their general composition and formation
stupefies and relaxes it. We have a good instance of this in the school
of Leucippus and Democritus compared with others, for they applied
themselves so much to particulars as almost to neglect the general
structure of things, while the others were so astounded while gazing on
the structure that they did not penetrate the simplicity of nature.
These two species of contemplation must, therefore, be interchanged, and
each employed in its turn, in order to render the understanding at once
penetrating and capacious, and to avoid the inconveniences we have
mentioned, and the idols that result from them.</p></li>
<li><p>Let such, therefore, be our precautions in contemplation, that we
may ward off and expel the idols of the den, which mostly owe their
birth either to some predominant pursuit, or, secondly, to an excess in
synthesis and analysis, or, thirdly, to a party zeal in favor of certain
ages, or, fourthly, to the extent or narrowness of the subject. In
general, he who contemplates nature should suspect whatever particularly
takes and fixes his understanding, and should use so much the more
caution to preserve it equable and unprejudiced.</p></li>
<li><p>The idols of the market are the most troublesome of all, those
namely which have entwined themselves round the understanding from the
associations of words and names. For men imagine that their reason
governs words, while, in fact, words react upon the understanding; and
this has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive.
Words are generally formed in a popular sense, and define things by
those broad lines which are most obvious to the vulgar mind; but when a
more acute understanding or more diligent observation is anxious to vary
those lines, and to adapt them more accurately to nature, words oppose
it. Hence the great and solemn disputes of learned men often terminate
in controversies about words and names, in regard to which it would be
better (imitating the caution of mathematicians) to proceed more
advisedly in the first instance, and to bring such disputes to a regular
issue by definitions. Such definitions, however, cannot remedy the evil
in natural and material objects, because they consist themselves of
words, and these words produce others;24 so that we must necessarily
have recourse to particular instances, and their regular series and
arrangement, as we shall mention when we come to the mode and scheme of
determining notions and axioms.</p></li>
<li><p>The idols imposed upon the understanding by words are of two
kinds. They are either the names of things which have no existence (for
as some objects are from inattention left without a name, so names are
formed by fanciful imaginations which are without an object), or they
are the names of actual objects, but confused, badly defined, and
hastily and irregularly abstracted from things. Fortune, the primum
mobile, the planetary orbits,25 the element of fire, and the like
fictions, which owe their birth to futile and false theories, are
instances of the first kind. And this species of idols is removed with
greater facility, because it can be exterminated by the constant
refutation or the desuetude of the theories themselves. The others,
which are created by vicious and unskilful abstraction, are intricate
and deeply rooted. Take some word, for instance, as moist, and let us
examine how far the different significations of this word are
consistent. It will be found that the word moist is nothing but a
confused sign of different actions admitted of no settled and defined
uniformity. For it means that which easily diffuses itself over another
body; that which is indeterminable and cannot be brought to a
consistency; that which yields easily in every direction; that which is
easily divided and dispersed; that which is easily united and collected;
that which easily flows and is put in motion; that which easily adheres
to, and wets another body; that which is easily reduced to a liquid
state though previously solid. When, therefore, you come to predicate or
impose this name, in one sense flame is moist, in another air is not
moist, in another fine powder is moist, in another glass is moist; so
that it is quite clear that this notion is hastily abstracted from water
only, and common ordinary liquors, without any due verification of
it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are, however, different degrees of distortion and mistake in
words. One of the least faulty classes is that of the names of
substances, particularly of the less abstract and more defined species
(those then of chalk and mud are good, of earth bad); words signifying
actions are more faulty, as to generate, to corrupt, to change; but the
most faulty are those denoting qualities (except the immediate objects
of sense), as heavy, light, rare, dense. Yet in all of these there must
be some notions a little better than others, in proportion as a greater
or less number of things come before the senses.</p>
<ol start="61" type="I">
<li>The idols of the theatre are not innate, nor do they introduce
themselves secretly into the understanding, but they are manifestly
instilled and cherished by the fictions of theories and depraved rules
of demonstration. To attempt, however, or undertake their confutation
would not be consistent with our declarations. For since we neither
agree in our principles nor our demonstrations, all argument is out of
the question. And it is fortunate that the ancients are left in
possession of their honors. We detract nothing from them, seeing our
whole doctrine relates only to the path to be pursued. The lame (as they
say) in the path outstrip the swift who wander from it, and it is clear
that the very skill and swiftness of him who runs not in the right
direction must increase his aberration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our method of discovering the sciences is such as to leave little to
the acuteness and strength of wit, and indeed rather to level wit and
intellect. For as in the drawing of a straight line, or accurate circle
by the hand, much depends on its steadiness and practice, but if a ruler
or compass be employed there is little occasion for either; so it is
with our method. Although, however, we enter into no individual
confutations, yet a little must be said, first, of the sects and general
divisions of these species of theories; secondly, something further to
show that there are external signs of their weakness; and, lastly, we
must consider the causes of so great a misfortune, and so long and
general a unanimity in error, that we may thus render the access to
truth less difficult, and that the human understanding may the more
readily be purified, and brought to dismiss its idols.</p>
<ol start="62" type="I">
<li>The idols of the theatre, or of theories, are numerous, and may, and
perhaps will, be still more so. For unless men’s minds had been now
occupied for many ages in religious and theological considerations, and
civil governments (especially monarchies), had been averse to novelties
of that nature even in theory (so that men must apply to them with some
risk and injury to their own fortunes, and not only without reward, but
subject to contumely and envy), there is no doubt that many other sects
of philosophers and theorists would have been introduced, like those
which formerly flourished in such diversified abundance among the
Greeks. For as many imaginary theories of the heavens can be deduced
from the phenomena of the sky, so it is even more easy to found many
dogmas upon the phenomena of philosophy — and the plot of this our
theatre resembles those of the poetical, where the plots which are
invented for the stage are more consistent, elegant, and pleasurable
than those taken from real history.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, men take for the groundwork of their philosophy either
too much from a few topics, or too little from many; in either case
their philosophy is founded on too narrow a basis of experiment and
natural history, and decides on too scanty grounds. For the theoretic
philosopher seizes various common circumstances by experiment, without
reducing them to certainty or examining and frequently considering them,
and relies for the rest upon meditation and the activity of his wit.</p>
<p>There are other philosophers who have diligently and accurately
attended to a few experiments, and have thence presumed to deduce and
invent systems of philosophy, forming everything to conformity with
them.</p>
<p>A third set, from their faith and religious veneration, introduce
theology and traditions; the absurdity of some among them having
proceeded so far as to seek and derive the sciences from spirits and
genii. There are, therefore, three sources of error and three species of
false philosophy; the sophistic, empiric, and superstitious.</p>
<ol start="63" type="I">
<li><p>Aristotle affords the most eminent instance of the first; for he
corrupted natural philosophy by logic — thus he formed the world of
categories, assigned to the human soul, the noblest of substances, a
genus determined by words of secondary operation, treated of density and
rarity (by which bodies occupy a greater or lesser space), by the frigid
distinctions of action and power, asserted that there was a peculiar and
proper motion in all bodies, and that if they shared in any other
motion, it was owing to an external moving cause, and imposed
innumerable arbitrary distinctions upon the nature of things; being
everywhere more anxious as to definitions in teaching and the accuracy
of the wording of his propositions, than the internal truth of things.
And this is best shown by a comparison of his philosophy with the others
of greatest repute among the Greeks. For the similar parts of
Anaxagoras, the atoms of Leucippus and Democritus, the heaven and earth
of Parmenides, the discord and concord of Empedocles,26 the resolution
of bodies into the common nature of fire, and their condensation
according to Heraclitus, exhibit some sprinkling of natural philosophy,
the nature of things, and experiment; while Aristotle’s physics are mere
logical terms, and he remodelled the same subject in his metaphysics
under a more imposing title, and more as a realist than a nominalist.
Nor is much stress to be laid on his frequent recourse to experiment in
his books on animals, his problems, and other treatises; for he had
already decided, without having properly consulted experience as the
basis of his decisions and axioms, and after having so decided, he drags
experiment along as a captive constrained to accommodate herself to his
decisions: so that he is even more to be blamed than his modern
followers (of the scholastic school) who have deserted her
altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>The empiric school produces dogmas of a more deformed and
monstrous nature than the sophistic or theoretic school; not being
founded in the light of common notions (which, however poor and
superstitious, is yet in a manner universal, and of a general tendency),
but in the confined obscurity of a few experiments. Hence this species
of philosophy appears probable, and almost certain to those who are
daily practiced in such experiments, and have thus corrupted their
imagination, but incredible and futile to others. We have a strong
instance of this in the alchemists and their dogmas; it would be
difficult to find another in this age, unless perhaps in the philosophy
of Gilbert.27 We could not, however, neglect to caution others against
this school, because we already foresee and augur, that if men be
hereafter induced by our exhortations to apply seriously to experiments
(bidding farewell to the sophistic doctrines), there will then be
imminent danger from empirics, owing to the premature and forward haste
of the understanding, and its jumping or flying to generalities and the
principles of things. We ought, therefore, already to meet the
evil.</p></li>
<li><p>The corruption of philosophy by the mixing of it up with
superstition and theology, is of a much wider extent, and is most
injurious to it both as a whole and in parts. For the human
understanding is no less exposed to the impressions of fancy, than to
those of vulgar notions. The disputatious and sophistic school entraps
the understanding, while the fanciful, bombastic, and, as it were,
poetical school, rather flatters it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a clear example of this among the Greeks, especially in
Pythagoras, where, however, the superstition is coarse and overcharged,
but it is more dangerous and refined in Plato and his school. This evil
is found also in some branches of other systems of philosophy, where it
introduces abstracted forms, final and first causes, omitting frequently
the intermediate and the like. Against it we must use the greatest
caution; for the apotheosis of error is the greatest evil of all, and
when folly is worshipped, it is, as it were, a plague spot upon the
understanding. Yet some of the moderns have indulged this folly with
such consummate inconsiderateness, that they have endeavored to build a
system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of Genesis, the book
of Job, and other parts of Scripture; seeking thus the dead among the
living.28 And this folly is the more to be prevented and restrained,
because not only fantastical philosophy, but heretical religion spring
from the absurd mixture of matters divine and human. It is therefore
most wise soberly to render unto faith the things that are faith’s.</p>
<ol start="66" type="I">
<li>Having spoken of the vicious authority of the systems founded either
on vulgar notions, or on a few experiments, or on superstition, we must
now consider the faulty subjects for contemplation, especially in
natural philosophy. The human understanding is perverted by observing
the power of mechanical arts, in which bodies are very materially
changed by composition or separation, and is induced to suppose that
something similar takes place in the universal nature of things. Hence
the fiction of elements, and their co-operation in forming natural
bodies.29 Again, when man reflects upon the entire liberty of nature, he
meets with particular species of things, as animals, plants, minerals,
and is thence easily led to imagine that there exist in nature certain
primary forms which she strives to produce, and that all variation from
them arises from some impediment or error which she is exposed to in
completing her work, or from the collision or metamorphosis of different
species. The first hypothesis has produced the doctrine of elementary
properties, the second that of occult properties and specific powers;
and both lead to trifling courses of reflection, in which the mind
acquiesces, and is thus diverted from more important subjects. But
physicians exercise a much more useful labor in the consideration of the
secondary qualities of things, and the operations of attraction,
repulsion, attenuation, inspissation, dilatation, astringency,
separation, maturation, and the like; and would do still more if they
would not corrupt these proper observations by the two systems I have
alluded to, of elementary qualities and specific powers, by which they
either reduce the secondary to first qualities, and their subtile and
immeasurable composition, or at any rate neglect to advance by greater
and more diligent observation to the third and fourth qualities, thus
terminating their contemplation prematurely. Nor are these powers (or
the like) to be investigated only among the medicines for the human
body, but also in all changes of other natural bodies.</li>
</ol>
<p>A greater evil arises from the contemplation and investigation rather
of the stationary principles of things from which, than of the active by
which things themselves are created. For the former only serve for
discussion, the latter for practice. Nor is any value to be set on those
common differences of motion which are observed in the received system
of natural philosophy, as generation, corruption, augmentation,
diminution, alteration, and translation. For this is their meaning: if a
body, unchanged in other respects, is moved from its place, this is
translation; if the place and species be given, but the quantity
changed, it is alteration; but if, from such a change, the mass and
quantity of the body do not continue the same, this is the motion of
augmentation and diminution; if the change be continued so as to vary
the species and substance, and transfuse them to others, this is
generation and corruption. All this is merely popular, and by no means
penetrates into nature; and these are but the measures and bounds of
motion, and not different species of it; they merely suggest how far,
and not how or whence. For they exhibit neither the affections of bodies
nor the process of their parts, but merely establish a division of that
motion, which coarsely exhibits to the senses matter in its varied form.
Even when they wish to point out something relative to the causes of
motion, and to establish a division of them, they most absurdly
introduce natural and violent motion, which is also a popular notion,
since every violent motion is also in fact natural, that is to say, the
external efficient puts nature in action in a different manner to that
which she had previously employed.</p>
<p>But if, neglecting these, any one were, for instance, to observe that
there is in bodies a tendency of adhesion, so as not to suffer the unity
of nature to be completely separated or broken, and a vacuum30 to be
formed, or that they have a tendency to return to their natural
dimensions or tension, so that, if compressed or extended within or
beyond it, they immediately strive to recover themselves, and resume
their former volume and extent; or that they have a tendency to
congregate into masses with similar bodies — the dense, for instance,
toward the circumference of the earth, the thin and rare toward that of
the heavens. These and the like are true physical genera of motions, but
the others are clearly logical and scholastic, as appears plainly from a
comparison of the two.</p>
<p>Another considerable evil is, that men in their systems and
contemplations bestow their labor upon the investigation and discussion
of the principles of things and the extreme limits of nature, although
all utility and means of action consist in the intermediate objects.
Hence men cease not to abstract nature till they arrive at potential and
shapeless matter,31 and still persist in their dissection, till they
arrive at atoms; and yet were all this true, it would be of little use
to advance man’s estate.</p>
<ol start="67" type="I">
<li>The understanding must also be cautioned against the intemperance of
systems, so far as regards its giving or withholding its assent; for
such intemperance appears to fix and perpetuate idols, so as to leave no
means of removing them.</li>
</ol>
<p>These excesses are of two kinds. The first is seen in those who
decide hastily, and render the sciences positive and dictatorial. The
other in those who have introduced scepticism, and vague unbounded
inquiry. The former subdues, the latter enervates the understanding. The
Aristotelian philosophy, after destroying other systems (as the
Ottomans32 do their brethren) by its disputatious confutations, decided
upon everything, and Aristotle himself then raises up questions at will,
in order to settle them; so that everything should be certain and
decided, a method now in use among his successors.</p>
<p>The school of Plato introduced scepticism, first, as it were in joke
and irony, from their dislike to Protagoras, Hippias,33 and others, who
were ashamed of appearing not to doubt upon any subject. But the new
academy dogmatized in their scepticism, and held it as their tenet.
Although this method be more honest than arbitrary decision (for its
followers allege that they by no means confound all inquiry, like Pyrrho
and his disciples, but hold doctrines which they can follow as probable,
though they cannot maintain them to be true), yet when the human mind
has once despaired of discovering truth, everything begins to languish.
Hence men turn aside into pleasant controversies and discussions, and
into a sort of wandering over subjects rather than sustain any rigorous
investigation. But as we observed at first, we are not to deny the
authority of the human senses and understanding, although weak, but
rather to furnish them with assistance.</p>
<ol start="68" type="I">
<li><p>We have now treated of each kind of idols, and their qualities,
all of which must be abjured and renounced with firm and solemn
resolution, and the understanding must be completely freed and cleared
of them, so that the access to the kingdom of man, which is founded on
the sciences, may resemble that to the kingdom of heaven, where no
admission is conceded except to children.</p></li>
<li><p>Vicious demonstrations are the muniments and support of idols,
and those which we possess in logic, merely subject and enslave the
world to human thoughts, and thoughts to words. But demonstrations are
in some manner themselves systems of philosophy and science; for such as
they are, and accordingly as they are regularly or improperly
established, such will be the resulting systems of philosophy and
contemplation. But those which we employ in the whole process leading
from the senses and things to axioms and conclusions, are fallacious and
incompetent. This process is fourfold, and the errors are in equal
number. In the first place the impressions of the senses are erroneous,
for they fail and deceive us. We must supply defects by substitutions,
and fallacies by their correction. Secondly, notions are improperly
abstracted from the senses, and indeterminate and confused when they
ought to be the reverse. Thirdly, the induction that is employed is
improper, for it determines the principles of sciences by simple
enumeration,34 without adopting exclusions and resolutions, or just
separations of nature. Lastly, the usual method of discovery and proof,
by first establishing the most general propositions, then applying and
proving the intermediate axioms according to them, is the parent of
error and the calamity of every science. But we will treat more fully of
that which we now slightly touch upon, when we come to lay down the true
way of interpreting nature, after having gone through the above
expiatory process and purification of the mind.</p></li>
<li><p>But experience is by far the best demonstration, provided it
adhere to the experiment actually made, for if that experiment be
transferred to other subjects apparently similar, unless with proper and
methodical caution it becomes fallacious. The present method of
experiment is blind and stupid; hence men wandering and roaming without
any determined course, and consulting mere chance, are hurried about to
various points, and advance but little — at one time they are happy, at
another their attention is distracted, and they always find that they
want something further. Men generally make their experiments carelessly,
and as it were in sport, making some little variation in a known
experiment, and then if they fail they become disgusted and give up the
attempt; nay, if they set to work more seriously, steadily, and
assiduously, yet they waste all their time on probing some solitary
matter, as Gilbert on the magnet, and the alchemists on gold. But such
conduct shows their method to be no less unskilful than mean; for nobody
can successfully investigate the nature of any object by considering
that object alone; the inquiry must be more generally extended.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Even when men build any science and theory upon experiment, yet they
almost always turn with premature and hasty zeal to practice, not merely
on account of the advantage and benefit to be derived from it, but in
order to seize upon some security in a new undertaking of their not
employing the remainder of their labor unprofitably, and by making
themselves conspicuous, to acquire a greater name for their pursuit.
Hence, like Atalanta, they leave the course to pick up the golden apple,
interrupting their speed, and giving up the victory. But in the true
course of experiment, and in extending it to new effects, we should
imitate the Divine foresight and order; for God on the first day only
created light, and assigned a whole day to that work without creating
any material substance thereon. In like manner we must first, by every
kind of experiment, elicit the discovery of causes and true axioms, and
seek for experiments which may afford light rather than profit. Axioms,
when rightly investigated and established, prepare us not for a limited
but abundant practice, and bring in their train whole troops of effects.
But we will treat hereafter of the ways of experience, which are not
less beset and interrupted than those of judgment; having spoken at
present of common experience only as a bad species of demonstration, the
order of our subject now requires some mention of those external signs
of the weakness in practice of the received systems of philosophy and
contemplation35 which we referred to above, and of the causes of a
circumstance at first sight so wonderful and incredible. For the
knowledge of these external signs prepares the way for assent, and the
explanation of the causes removes the wonder; and these two
circumstances are of material use in extirpating more easily and gently
the idols from the understanding.</p>
<ol start="71" type="I">
<li><p>The sciences we possess have been principally derived from the
Greeks; for the addition of the Roman, Arabic, or more modern writers,
are but few and of small importance, and such as they are, are founded
on the basis of Greek invention. But the wisdom of the Greeks was
professional and disputatious, and thus most adverse to the
investigation of truth. The name, therefore, of sophists, which the
contemptuous spirit of those who deemed themselves philosophers,
rejected and transferred to the rhetoricians — Gorgias,36 Protagoras,
Hippias, Polus — might well suit the whole tribe, such as Plato,
Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, Theophrastus, and their successors —
Chrysippus, Carneades, and the rest. There was only this difference
between them — the former were mercenary vagabonds, travelling about to
different states, making a show of their wisdom, and requiring pay; the
latter more dignified and noble, in possession of fixed habitations,
opening schools, and teaching philosophy gratuitously. Both, however
(though differing in other respects), were professorial, and reduced
every subject to controversy, establishing and defending certain sects
and dogmas of philosophy, so that their doctrines were nearly (what
Dionysius not unaptly objected to Plato) the talk of idle old men to
ignorant youths. But the more ancient Greeks, as Empedocles, Anaxagoras,
Leucippus, Democritus, Parmenides, Heraclitus, Xenophanes, Philolaus,
and the rest37 (for I omit Pythagoras as being superstitious), did not
(that we are aware) open schools, but betook themselves to the
investigation of truth with greater silence and with more severity and
simplicity, that is, with less affectation and ostentation. Hence in our
opinion they acted more advisedly, however their works may have been
eclipsed in course of time by those lighter productions which better
correspond with and please the apprehensions and passions of the vulgar;
for time, like a river,38 bears down to us that which is light and
inflated, and sinks that which is heavy and solid. Nor were even these
more ancient philosophers free from the national defect, but inclined
too much to the ambition and vanity of forming a sect, and captivating
public opinion, and we must despair of any inquiry after truth when it
condescends to such trifles. Nor must we omit the opinion, or rather
prophecy, of an Egyptian priest with regard to the Greeks, that they
would forever remain children, without any antiquity of knowledge or
knowledge of antiquity; for they certainly have this in common with
children, that they are prone to talking, and incapable of generation,
their wisdom being loquacious and unproductive of effects. Hence the
external signs derived from the origin and birthplace of our present
philosophy are not favorable.</p></li>
<li><p>Nor are those much better which can be deduced from the character
of the time and age, than the former from that of the country and
nation; for in that age the knowledge both of time and of the world was
confined and meagre, which is one of the worst evils for those who rely
entirely on experience — they had not a thousand years of history worthy
of that name, but mere fables and ancient traditions; they were
acquainted with but a small portion of the regions and countries of the
world, for they indiscriminately called all nations situated far toward
the north Scythians, all those to the west Celts; they knew nothing of
Africa but the nearest part of Ethiopia, or of Asia beyond the Ganges,
and had not even heard any sure and clear tradition of the regions of
the New World. Besides, a vast number of climates and zones, in which
innumerable nations live and breathe, were pronounced by them to be
uninhabitable; nay, the travels of Democritus, Plato, and Pythagoras,
which were not extensive, but rather mere excursions from home, were
considered as something vast. But in our times many parts of the New
World, and every extremity of the Old, are well known, and the mass of
experiments has been infinitely increased; wherefore, if external signs
were to be taken from the time of the nativity or procreation (as in
astrology), nothing extraordinary could be predicted of these early
systems of philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>Of all signs there is none more certain or worthy than that of
the fruits produced, for the fruits and effects are the sureties and
vouchers, as it were, for the truth of philosophy. Now, from the systems
of the Greeks, and their subordinate divisions in particular branches of
the sciences during so long a period, scarcely one single experiment can
be culled that has a tendency to elevate or assist mankind, and can be
fairly set down to the speculations and doctrines of their philosophy.
Celsus candidly and wisely confesses as much, when he observes that
experiments were first discovered in medicine, and that men afterward
built their philosophical systems upon them, and searched for and
assigned causes, instead of the inverse method of discovering and
deriving experiments from philosophy and the knowledge of causes; it is
not, therefore, wonderful that the Egyptians (who bestowed divinity and
sacred honors on the authors of new inventions) should have consecrated
more images of brutes than of men, for the brutes by their natural
instinct made many discoveries, while men derived but few from
discussion and the conclusions of reason.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The industry of the alchemists has produced some effect, by chance,
however, and casualty, or from varying their experiments (as mechanics
also do), and not from any regular art or theory, the theory they have
imagined rather tending to disturb than to assist experiment. Those,
too, who have occupied themselves with natural magic (as they term it)
have made but few discoveries, and those of small import, and bordering
on imposture; for which reason, in the same manner as we are cautioned
by religion to show our faith by our works, we may very properly apply
the principle to philosophy, and judge of it by its works, accounting
that to be futile which is unproductive, and still more so if, instead
of grapes and olives, it yield but the thistle and thorns of dispute and
contention.</p>
<ol start="74" type="I">
<li><p>Other signs may be selected from the increase and progress of
particular systems of philosophy and the sciences; for those which are
founded on nature grow and increase, while those which are founded on
opinion change and increase not. If, therefore, the theories we have
mentioned were not like plants, torn up by the roots, but grew in the
womb of nature, and were nourished by her, that which for the last two
thousand years has taken place would never have happened, namely, that
the sciences still continue in their beaten track, and nearly
stationary, without having received any important increase, nay, having,
on the contrary, rather bloomed under the hands of their first author,
and then faded away. But we see that the case is reversed in the
mechanical arts, which are founded on nature and the light of
experience, for they (as long as they are popular) seem full of life,
and uninterruptedly thrive and grow, being at first rude, then
convenient, lastly polished, and perpetually improved.</p></li>
<li><p>There is yet another sign (if such it may be termed, being rather
an evidence, and one of the strongest nature), namely, the actual
confession of those very authorities whom men now follow; for even they
who decide on things so daringly, yet at times, when they reflect,
betake themselves to complaints about the subtilty of nature, the
obscurity of things, and the weakness of man’s wit. If they would merely
do this, they might perhaps deter those who are of a timid disposition
from further inquiry, but would excite and stimulate those of a more
active and confident turn to further advances. They are not, however,
satisfied with confessing so much of themselves, but consider everything
which has been either unknown or unattempted by themselves or their
teachers, as beyond the limits of possibility, and thus, with most
consummate pride and envy, convert the defects of their own discoveries
into a calumny on nature and a source of despair to every one else.
Hence arose the New Academy, which openly professed scepticism,39 and
consigned mankind to eternal darkness; hence the notion that forms, or
the true differences of things (which are in fact the laws of simple
action), are beyond man’s reach, and cannot possibly be discovered;
hence those notions in the active and operative branches, that the heat
of the sun and of fire are totally different, so as to prevent men from
supposing that they can elicit or form, by means of fire, anything
similar to the operations of nature; and again, that composition only is
the work of man and mixture of nature, so as to prevent men from
expecting the generation or transformation of natural bodies by art. Men
will, therefore, easily allow themselves to be persuaded by this sign
not to engage their fortunes and labor in speculations, which are not
only desperate, but actually devoted to desperation.</p></li>
<li><p>Nor should we omit the sign afforded by the great dissension
formerly prevalent among philosophers, and the variety of schools, which
sufficiently show that the way was not well prepared that leads from the
senses to the understanding, since the same groundwork of philosophy
(namely, the nature of things), was torn and divided into such widely
differing and multifarious errors. And although in these days the
dissensions and differences of opinions with regard to first principles
and entire systems are nearly extinct,40 yet there remain innumerable
questions and controversies with regard to particular branches of
philosophy. So that it is manifest that there is nothing sure or sound
either in the systems themselves or in the methods of
demonstration.41</p></li>
<li><p>With regard to the supposition that there is a general unanimity
as to the philosophy of Aristotle, because the other systems of the
ancients ceased and became obsolete on its promulgation, and nothing
better has been since discovered; whence it appears that it is so well
determined and founded, as to have united the suffrages of both ages; we
will observe — 1st. That the notion of other ancient systems having
ceased after the publication of the works of Aristotle is false, for the
works of the ancient philosophers subsisted long after that event, even
to the time of Cicero, and the subsequent ages. But at a later period,
when human learning had, as it were, been wrecked in the inundation of
barbarians into the Roman empire, then the systems of Aristotle and
Plato were preserved in the waves of ages, like planks of a lighter and
less solid nature. 2d. The notion of unanimity, on a clear inspection,
is found to be fallacious. For true unanimity is that which proceeds
from a free judgment, arriving at the same conclusion, after an
investigation of the fact. Now, by far the greater number of those who
have assented to the philosophy of Aristotle, have bound themselves down
to it from prejudice and the authority of others, so that it is rather
obsequiousness and concurrence than unanimity. But even if it were real
and extensive unanimity, so far from being esteemed a true and solid
confirmation, it should even lead to a violent presumption to the
contrary. For there is no worse augury in intellectual matters than that
derived from unanimity, with the exception of divinity and politics,
where suffrages are allowed to decide. For nothing pleases the
multitude, unless it strike the imagination or bind down the
understanding, as we have observed above, with the shackles of vulgar
notions. Hence we may well transfer Phocion’s remark from morals to the
intellect: “That men should immediately examine what error or fault they
have committed, when the multitude concurs with, and applauds them.”42
This then is one of the most unfavorable signs. All the signs,
therefore, of the truth and soundness of the received systems of
philosophy and the sciences are unpropitious, whether taken from their
origin, their fruits, their progress, the confessions of their authors,
or from unanimity.</p></li>
<li><p>We now come to the causes of errors,43 and of such perseverance
in them for ages. These are sufficiently numerous and powerful to remove
all wonder, that what we now offer should have so long been concealed
from, and have escaped the notice of mankind, and to render it more
worthy of astonishment, that it should even now have entered any one’s
mind, or become the subject of his thoughts; and that it should have
done so, we consider rather the gift of fortune than of any
extraordinary talent, and as the offspring of time rather than wit. But,
in the first place, the number of ages is reduced to very narrow limits,
on a proper consideration of the matter. For out of twenty-five44
centuries, with which the memory and learning of man are conversant,
scarcely six can be set apart and selected as fertile in science and
favorable to its progress. For there are deserts and wastes in times as
in countries, and we can only reckon up three revolutions and epochs of
philosophy. 1. The Greek. 2. The Roman. 3. Our own, that is the
philosophy of the western nations of Europe: and scarcely two centuries
can with justice be assigned to each. The intermediate ages of the world
were unfortunate both in the quantity and richness of the sciences
produced. Nor need we mention the Arabs, or the scholastic philosophy,
which, in those ages, ground down the sciences by their numerous
treatises, more than they increased their weight. The first cause, then,
of such insignificant progress in the sciences, is rightly referred to
the small proportion of time which has been favorable thereto.</p></li>
<li><p>A second cause offers itself, which is certainly of the greatest
importance; namely, that in those very ages in which men’s wit and
literature flourished considerably, or even moderately, but a small part
of their industry was bestowed on natural philosophy, the great mother
of the sciences. For every art and science torn from this root may,
perhaps, be polished, and put into a serviceable shape, but can admit of
little growth. It is well known, that after the Christian religion had
been acknowledged, and arrived at maturity, by far the best wits were
busied upon theology, where the highest rewards offered themselves, and
every species of assistance was abundantly supplied, and the study of
which was the principal occupation of the western European nations
during the third epoch; the rather because literature flourished about
the very time when controversies concerning religion first began to bud
forth. 2. In the preceding ages, during the second epoch (that of the
Romans), philosophical meditation and labor was chiefly occupied and
wasted in moral philosophy (the theology of the heathens): besides, the
greatest minds in these times applied themselves to civil affairs, on
account of the magnitude of the Roman empire, which required the labor
of many. 3. The age during which natural philosophy appeared principally
to flourish among the Greeks, was but a short period, since in the more
ancient times the seven sages (with the exception of Thales), applied
themselves to moral philosophy and politics, and at a later period,
after Socrates had brought down philosophy from heaven to earth, moral
philosophy became more prevalent, and diverted men’s attention from
natural. Nay, the very period during which physical inquiries
flourished, was corrupted and rendered useless by contradictions, and
the ambition of new opinions. Since, therefore, during these three
epochs, natural philosophy has been materially neglected or impeded, it
is not at all surprising that men should have made but little progress
in it, seeing they were attending to an entirely different
matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Add to this that natural philosophy, especially of late, has
seldom gained exclusive possession of an individual free from all other
pursuits, even among those who have applied themselves to it, unless
there may be an example or two of some monk studying in his cell, or
some nobleman in his villa.45 She has rather been made a passage and
bridge to other pursuits.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus has this great mother of the sciences been degraded most
unworthily to the situation of a handmaid, and made to wait upon
medicine or mathematical operations, and to wash the immature minds of
youth, and imbue them with a first dye, that they may afterward be more
ready to receive and retain another. In the meantime, let no one expect
any great progress in the sciences (especially their operative part),
unless natural philosophy be applied to particular sciences, and
particular sciences again referred back to natural philosophy. For want
of this, astronomy, optics, music, many mechanical arts, medicine
itself, and (what perhaps is more wonderful), moral and political
philosophy, and the logical sciences have no depth, but only glide over
the surface and variety of things; because these sciences, when they
have been once partitioned out and established, are no longer nourished
by natural philosophy, which would have imparted fresh vigor and growth
to them from the sources and genuine contemplation of motion, rays,
sounds, texture, and conformation of bodies, and the affections and
capacity of the understanding. But we can little wonder that the
sciences grow not when separated from their roots.</p>
<ol start="81" type="I">
<li><p>There is another powerful and great cause of the little
advancement of the sciences, which is this; it is impossible to advance
properly in the course when the goal is not properly fixed. But the real
and legitimate goal of the sciences is the endowment of human life with
new inventions and riches. The great crowd of teachers know nothing of
this, but consist of dictatorial hirelings; unless it so happen that
some artisan of an acute genius, and ambitious of fame, gives up his
time to a new discovery, which is generally attended with a loss of
property. The majority, so far from proposing to themselves the
augmentation of the mass of arts and sciences, make no other use of an
inquiry into the mass already before them, than is afforded by the
conversion of it to some use in their lectures, or to gain, or to the
acquirement of a name, and the like. But if one out of the multitude be
found, who courts science from real zeal, and on his own account, even
he will be seen rather to follow contemplation, and the variety of
theories, than a severe and strict investigation of truth. Again, if
there even be an unusually strict investigator of truth, yet will he
propose to himself, as the test of truth, the satisfaction of his mind
and understanding, as to the causes of things long since known, and not
such a test as to lead to some new earnest of effects, and a new light
in axioms. If, therefore, no one have laid down the real end of science,
we cannot wonder that there should be error in points subordinate to
that end.</p></li>
<li><p>But, in like manner, as the end and goal of science is ill
defined, so, even were the case otherwise, men have chosen an erroneous
and impassable direction. For it is sufficient to astonish any
reflecting mind, that nobody should have cared or wished to open and
complete a way for the understanding, setting off from the senses, and
regular, well-conducted experiment; but that everything has been
abandoned either to the mists of tradition, the whirl and confusion of
argument, or the waves and mazes of chance, and desultory, ill-combined
experiment. Now, let any one but consider soberly and diligently the
nature of the path men have been accustomed to pursue in the
investigation and discovery of any matter, and he will doubtless first
observe the rude and inartificial manner of discovery most familiar to
mankind: which is no other than this. When any one prepares himself for
discovery, he first inquires and obtains a full account of all that has
been said on the subject by others, then adds his own reflections, and
stirs up and, as it were, invokes his own spirit, after much mental
labor, to disclose its oracles. All which is a method without
foundation, and merely turns on opinion.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Another, perhaps, calls in logic to assist him in discovery, which
bears only a nominal relation to his purpose. For the discoveries of
logic are not discoveries of principles and leading axioms, but only of
what appears to accord with them.46 And when men become curious and
importunate, and give trouble, interrupting her about her proofs, and
the discovery of principles or first axioms, she puts them off with her
usual answer, referring them to faith, and ordering them to swear
allegiance to each art in its own department.</p>
<p>There remains but mere experience, which, when it offers itself, is
called chance; when it is sought after, experiment.47 But this kind of
experience is nothing but a loose fagot; and mere groping in the dark,
as men at night try all means of discovering the right road, while it
would be better and more prudent either to wait for day, or procure a
light, and then proceed. On the contrary, the real order of experience
begins by setting up a light, and then shows the road by it, commencing
with a regulated and digested, not a misplaced and vague course of
experiment, and thence deducing axioms, and from those axioms new
experiments: for not even the Divine Word proceeded to operate on the
general mass of things without due order.</p>
<p>Let men, therefore, cease to wonder if the whole course of science be
not run, when all have wandered from the path; quitting it entirely, and
deserting experience, or involving themselves in its mazes, and
wandering about, while a regularly combined system would lead them in a
sure track through its wilds to the open day of axioms.</p>
<ol start="83" type="I">
<li><p>The evil, however, has been wonderfully increased by an opinion,
or inveterate conceit, which is both vainglorious and prejudicial,
namely, that the dignity of the human mind is lowered by long and
frequent intercourse with experiments and particulars, which are the
objects of sense, and confined to matter; especially since such matters
generally require labor in investigation, are mean subjects for
meditation, harsh in discourse, unproductive in practice, infinite in
number, and delicate in their subtilty. Hence we have seen the true path
not only deserted, but intercepted and blocked up, experience being
rejected with disgust, and not merely neglected or improperly
applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, the reverence for antiquity,48 and the authority of men
who have been esteemed great in philosophy, and general unanimity, have
retarded men from advancing in science, and almost enchanted them. As to
unanimity, we have spoken of it above.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The opinion which men cherish of antiquity is altogether idle, and
scarcely accords with the term. For the old age and increasing years of
the world should in reality be considered as antiquity, and this is
rather the character of our own times than of the less advanced age of
the world in those of the ancients; for the latter, with respect to
ourselves, are ancient and elder, with respect to the world modern and
younger. And as we expect a greater knowledge of human affairs, and more
mature judgment from an old man than from a youth, on account of his
experience, and the variety and number of things he has seen, heard, and
meditated upon, so we have reason to expect much greater things of our
own age (if it knew but its strength and would essay and exert it) than
from antiquity, since the world has grown older, and its stock has been
increased and accumulated with an infinite number of experiments and
observations.</p>
<p>We must also take into our consideration that many objects in nature
fit to throw light upon philosophy have been exposed to our view, and
discovered by means of long voyages and travels, in which our times have
abounded. It would, indeed, be dishonorable to mankind, if the regions
of the material globe, the earth, the sea, and stars, should be so
prodigiously developed and illustrated in our age, and yet the
boundaries of the intellectual globe should be confined to the narrow
discoveries of the ancients.</p>
<p>With regard to authority, it is the greatest weakness to attribute
infinite credit to particular authors, and to refuse his own prerogative
to time, the author of all authors, and, therefore, of all authority.
For truth is rightly named the daughter of time, not of authority. It is
not wonderful, therefore, if the bonds of antiquity, authority, and
unanimity, have so enchained the power of man, that he is unable (as if
bewitched) to become familiar with things themselves.</p>
<ol start="85" type="I">
<li>Nor is it only the admiration of antiquity, authority, and
unanimity, that has forced man’s industry to rest satisfied with present
discoveries, but, also, the admiration of the effects already placed
within his power. For whoever passes in review the variety of subjects,
and the beautiful apparatus collected and introduced by the mechanical
arts for the service of mankind, will certainly be rather inclined to
admire our wealth than to perceive our poverty: not considering that the
observations of man and operations of nature (which are the souls and
first movers of that variety) are few, and not of deep research; the
rest must be attributed merely to man’s patience, and the delicate and
well-regulated motion of the hand or of instruments. To take an
instance, the manufacture of clocks is delicate and accurate, and
appears to imitate the heavenly bodies in its wheels, and the pulse of
animals in its regular oscillation, yet it only depends upon one or two
axioms of nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, if one consider the refinement of the liberal arts, or even
that exhibited in the preparation of natural bodies in mechanical arts
and the like, as the discovery of the heavenly motions in astronomy, of
harmony in music, of the letters of the alphabet49 (still unadopted by
the Chinese) in grammar; or, again, in mechanical operations, the
productions of Bacchus and Ceres, that is, the preparation of wine and
beer, the making of bread, or even the luxuries of the table,
distillation, and the like; if one reflect also, and consider for how
long a period of ages (for all the above, except distillation, are
ancient) these things have been brought to their present state of
perfection, and (as we instanced in clocks) to how few observations and
axioms of nature they may be referred, and how easily, and as it were,
by obvious chance or contemplation, they might be discovered, one would
soon cease to admire and rather pity the human lot on account of its
vast want and dearth of things and discoveries for so many ages. Yet
even the discoveries we have mentioned were more ancient than philosophy
and the intellectual arts; so that (to say the truth) when contemplation
and doctrinal science began, the discovery of useful works ceased.</p>
<p>But if any one turn from the manufactories to libraries, and be
inclined to admire the immense variety of books offered to our view, let
him but examine and diligently inspect the matter and contents of these
books, and his astonishment will certainly change its object: for when
he finds no end of repetitions, and how much men do and speak the same
thing over again, he will pass from admiration of this variety to
astonishment at the poverty and scarcity of matter, which has hitherto
possessed and filled men’s minds.</p>
<p>But if any one should condescend to consider such sciences as are
deemed rather curious than sound, and take a full view of the operations
of the alchemists or magii, he will perhaps hesitate whether he ought
rather to laugh or to weep. For the alchemist cherishes eternal hope,
and when his labors succeed not, accuses his own mistakes, deeming, in
his self-accusation, that he has not properly understood the words of
art or of his authors; upon which he listens to tradition and vague
whispers, or imagines there is some slight unsteadiness in the minute
details of his practice, and then has recourse to an endless repetition
of experiments: and in the meantime, when, in his casual experiments, he
falls upon something in appearance new, or of some degree of utility, he
consoles himself with such an earnest, and ostentatiously publishes
them, keeping up his hope of the final result. Nor can it be denied that
the alchemists have made several discoveries, and presented mankind with
useful inventions. But we may well apply to them the fable of the old
man, who bequeathed to his sons some gold buried in his garden,
pretending not to know the exact spot, whereupon they worked diligently
in digging the vineyard, and though they found no gold, the vintage was
rendered more abundant by their labor.</p>
<p>The followers of natural magic, who explain everything by sympathy
and antipathy, have assigned false powers and marvellous operations to
things by gratuitous and idle conjectures: and if they have ever
produced any effects, they are rather wonderful and novel than of any
real benefit or utility.</p>
<p>In superstitious magic (if we say anything at all about it) we must
chiefly observe, that there are only some peculiar and definite objects
with which the curious and superstitious arts have, in every nation and
age, and even under every religion, been able to exercise and amuse
themselves. Let us, therefore, pass them over. In the meantime we cannot
wonder that the false notion of plenty should have occasioned want.</p>
<ol start="86" type="I">
<li>The admiration of mankind with regard to the arts and sciences,
which is of itself sufficiently simple and almost puerile, has been
increased by the craft and artifices of those who have treated the
sciences, and delivered them down to posterity. For they propose and
produce them to our view so fashioned, and as it were masked, as to make
them pass for perfect and complete. For if you consider their method and
divisions, they appear to embrace and comprise everything which can
relate to the subject. And although this frame be badly filled up and
resemble an empty bladder, yet it presents to the vulgar understanding
the form and appearance of a perfect science.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first and most ancient investigators of truth were wont, on the
contrary, with more honesty and success, to throw all the knowledge they
wished to gather from contemplation, and to lay up for use, into
aphorisms, or short scattered sentences unconnected by any method, and
without pretending or professing to comprehend any entire art. But
according to the present system, we cannot wonder that men seek nothing
beyond that which is handed down to them as perfect, and already
extended to its full complement.</p>
<ol start="87" type="I">
<li><p>The ancient theories have received additional support and credit
from the absurdity and levity of those who have promoted the new,
especially in the active and practical part of natural philosophy. For
there have been many silly and fantastical fellows who, from credulity
or imposture, have loaded mankind with promises, announcing and boasting
of the prolongation of life, the retarding of old age, the alleviation
of pains, the remedying of natural defects, the deception of the senses,
the restraint and excitement of the passions, the illumination and
exaltation of the intellectual faculties, the transmutation of
substances, the unlimited intensity and multiplication of motion, the
impressions and changes of the air, the bringing into our power the
management of celestial influences, the divination of future events, the
representation of distant objects, the revelation of hidden objects, and
the like. One would not be very wrong in observing with regard to such
pretenders, that there is as much difference in philosophy, between
their absurdity and real science, as there is in history between the
exploits of Cæsar or Alexander, and those of Amadis de Gaul and Arthur
of Britain. For those illustrious generals are found to have actually
performed greater exploits than such fictitious heroes are even
pretended to have accomplished, by the means, however, of real action,
and not by any fabulous and portentous power. Yet it is not right to
suffer our belief in true history to be diminished, because it is
sometimes injured and violated by fables. In the meantime we cannot
wonder that great prejudice has been excited against any new
propositions (especially when coupled with any mention of effects to be
produced), by the conduct of impostors who have made a similar attempt;
for their extreme absurdity, and the disgust occasioned by it, has even
to this day overpowered every spirited attempt of the kind.</p></li>
<li><p>Want of energy, and the littleness and futility of the tasks that
human industry has undertaken, have produced much greater injury to the
sciences: and yet (to make it still worse) that very want of energy
manifests itself in conjunction with arrogance and disdain.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For, in the first place, one excuse, now from its repetition become
familiar, is to be observed in every art, namely, that its promoters
convert the weakness of the art itself into a calumny upon nature: and
whatever it in their hands fails to effect, they pronounce to be
physically impossible. But how can the art ever be condemned while it
acts as judge in its own cause? Even the present system of philosophy
cherishes in its bosom certain positions or dogmas, which (it will be
found on diligent inquiry) are calculated to produce a full conviction
that no difficult, commanding, and powerful operation upon nature ought
to be anticipated through the means of art; we instanced50 above the
alleged different quality of heat in the sun and fire, and composition
and mixture. Upon an accurate observation the whole tendency of such
positions is wilfully to circumscribe man’s power, and to produce a
despair of the means of invention and contrivance, which would not only
confound the promises of hope, but cut the very springs and sinews of
industry, and throw aside even the chances of experience. The only
object of such philosophers is to acquire the reputation of perfection
for their own art, and they are anxious to obtain the most silly and
abandoned renown, by causing a belief that whatever has not yet been
invented and understood can never be so hereafter. But if any one
attempt to give himself up to things, and to discover something new; yet
he will only propose and destine for his object the investigation and
discovery of some one invention, and nothing more; as the nature of the
magnet, the tides, the heavenly system, and the like, which appear
enveloped in some degree of mystery, and have hitherto been treated with
but little success. Now it is the greatest proof of want of skill, to
investigate the nature of any object in itself alone; for that same
nature, which seems concealed and hidden in some instances, is manifest
and almost palpable in others, and excites wonder in the former, while
it hardly attracts attention in the latter.51 Thus the nature of
consistency is scarcely observed in wood or stone, but passed over by
the term solid without any further inquiry about the repulsion of
separation or the solution of continuity. But in water-bubbles the same
circumstance appears matter of delicate and ingenious research, for they
form themselves into thin pellicles, curiously shaped into hemispheres,
so as for an instant to avoid the solution of continuity.</p>
<p>In general those very things which are considered as secret are
manifest and common in other objects, but will never be clearly seen if
the experiments and contemplation of man be directed to themselves only.
Yet it commonly happens, that if, in the mechanical arts, any one bring
old discoveries to a finer polish, or more elegant height of ornament,
or unite and compound them, or apply them more readily to practice, or
exhibit them on a less heavy and voluminous scale, and the like, they
will pass off as new.</p>
<p>We cannot, therefore, wonder that no magnificent discoveries, worthy
of mankind, have been brought to light, while men are satisfied and
delighted with such scanty and puerile tasks, nay, even think that they
have pursued or attained some great object in their accomplishment.</p>
<ol start="89" type="I">
<li>Nor should we neglect to observe that natural philosophy has, in
every age, met with a troublesome and difficult opponent: I mean
superstition, and a blind and immoderate zeal for religion. For we see
that, among the Greeks, those who first disclosed the natural causes of
thunder and storms to the yet untrained ears of man were condemned as
guilty of impiety toward the gods.52 Nor did some of the old fathers of
Christianity treat those much better who showed by the most positive
proofs (such as no one now disputes) that the earth is spherical, and
thence asserted that there were antipodes.53</li>
</ol>
<p>Even in the present state of things the condition of discussions on
natural philosophy is rendered more difficult and dangerous by the
summaries and methods of divines, who, after reducing divinity into such
order as they could, and brought it into a scientific form, have
proceeded to mingle an undue proportion of the contentious and thorny
philosophy of Aristotle with the substance of religion.54</p>
<p>The fictions of those who have not feared to deduce and confirm the
truth of the Christian religion by the principles and authority of
philosophers, tend to the same end, though in a different manner.55 They
celebrate the union of faith and the senses as though it were
legitimate, with great pomp and solemnity, and gratify men’s pleasing
minds with a variety, but in the meantime confound most improperly
things divine and human. Moreover, in these mixtures of divinity and
philosophy the received doctrines of the latter are alone included, and
any novelty, even though it be an improvement, scarcely escapes
banishment and extermination.</p>
<p>In short, you may find all access to any species of philosophy,
however pure, intercepted by the ignorance of divines. Some in their
simplicity are apprehensive that a too deep inquiry into nature may
penetrate beyond the proper bounds of decorum, transferring and absurdly
applying what is said of sacred mysteries in Holy Writ against those who
pry into divine secrets, to the mysteries of nature, which are not
forbidden by any prohibition. Others with more cunning imagine and
consider, that if secondary causes be unknown, everything may more
easily be referred to the Divine hand and wand, a matter, as they think,
of the greatest consequence to religion, but which can only really mean
that God wishes to be gratified by means of falsehood. Others fear, from
past example, lest motion and change in philosophy should terminate in
an attack upon religion. Lastly, there are others who appear anxious
lest there should be something discovered in the investigation of nature
to overthrow, or at least shake, religion, particularly among the
unlearned. The last two apprehensions appear to resemble animal
instinct, as if men were diffident, in the bottom of their minds and
secret meditations, of the strength of religion and the empire of faith
over the senses, and therefore feared that some danger awaited them from
an inquiry into nature. But any one who properly considers the subject
will find natural philosophy to be, after the Word of God, the surest
remedy against superstition, and the most approved support of faith. She
is, therefore, rightly bestowed upon religion as a most faithful
attendant, for the one exhibits the will and the other the power of God.
Nor was he wrong who observed, “Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures and
the power of God,” thus uniting in one bond the revelation of his will
and the contemplation of his power. In the meanwhile, it is not
wonderful that the progress of natural philosophy has been restrained,
since religion, which has so much influence on men’s minds, has been led
and hurried to oppose her through the ignorance of some and the
imprudent zeal of others.</p>
<ol start="90" type="I">
<li><p>Again, in the habits and regulations of schools, universities,
and the like assemblies, destined for the abode of learned men and the
improvement of learning, everything is found to be opposed to the
progress of the sciences; for the lectures and exercises are so ordered,
that anything out of the common track can scarcely enter the thoughts
and contemplations of the mind. If, however, one or two have perhaps
dared to use their liberty, they can only impose the labor on
themselves, without deriving any advantage from the association of
others; and if they put up with this, they will find their industry and
spirit of no slight disadvantage to them in making their fortune; for
the pursuits of men in such situations are, as it were, chained down to
the writings of particular authors, and if any one dare to dissent from
them he is immediately attacked as a turbulent and revolutionary spirit.
Yet how great is the difference between civil matters and the arts, for
there is not the same danger from new activity and new light. In civil
matters even a change for the better is suspected on account of the
commotion it occasions, for civil government is supported by authority,
unanimity, fame, and public opinion, and not by demonstration. In the
arts and sciences, on the contrary, every department should resound, as
in mines, with new works and advances. And this is the rational, though
not the actual view of the case, for that administration and government
of science we have spoken of is wont too rigorously to repress its
growth.</p></li>
<li><p>And even should the odium I have alluded to be avoided, yet it is
sufficient to repress the increase of science that such attempts and
industry pass unrewarded; for the cultivation of science and its reward
belong not to the same individual. The advancement of science is the
work of a powerful genius, the prize and reward belong to the vulgar or
to princes, who (with a few exceptions) are scarcely moderately well
informed. Nay, such progress is not only deprived of the rewards and
beneficence of individuals, but even of popular praise; for it is above
the reach of the generality, and easily overwhelmed and extinguished by
the winds of common opinions. It is not wonderful, therefore, that
little success has attended that which has been little honored.</p></li>
<li><p>But by far the greatest obstacle to the advancement of the
sciences, and the undertaking of any new attempt or department, is to be
found in men’s despair and the idea of impossibility; for men of a
prudent and exact turn of thought are altogether diffident in matters of
this nature, considering the obscurity of nature, the shortness of life,
the deception of the senses, and weakness of the judgment. They think,
therefore, that in the revolutions of ages and of the world there are
certain floods and ebbs of the sciences, and that they grow and flourish
at one time, and wither and fall off at another, that when they have
attained a certain degree and condition they can proceed no
further.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If, therefore, any one believe or promise greater things, they impute
it to an uncurbed and immature mind, and imagine that such efforts begin
pleasantly, then become laborious, and end in confusion. And since such
thoughts easily enter the minds of men of dignity and excellent
judgment, we must really take heed lest we should be captivated by our
affection for an excellent and most beautiful object, and relax or
diminish the severity of our judgment; and we must diligently examine
what gleam of hope shines upon us, and in what direction it manifests
itself, so that, banishing her lighter dreams, we may discuss and weigh
whatever appears of more sound importance. We must consult the prudence
of ordinary life, too, which is diffident upon principle, and in all
human matters augurs the worst. Let us, then, speak of hope, especially
as we are not vain promisers, nor are willing to enforce or insnare
men’s judgment, but would rather lead them willingly forward. And
although we shall employ the most cogent means of enforcing hope when we
bring them to particulars, and especially those which are digested and
arranged in our Tables of Invention (the subject partly of the second,
but principally of the fourth part of the Instauration), which are,
indeed, rather the very object of our hopes than hope itself; yet to
proceed more leniently we must treat of the preparation of men’s minds,
of which the manifestation of hope forms no slight part; for without it
all that we have said tends rather to produce a gloom than to encourage
activity or quicken the industry of experiment, by causing them to have
a worse and more contemptuous opinion of things as they are than they
now entertain, and to perceive and feel more thoroughly their
unfortunate condition. We must, therefore, disclose and prefix our
reasons for not thinking the hope of success improbable, as Columbus,
before his wonderful voyage over the Atlantic, gave the reasons of his
conviction that new lands and continents might be discovered besides
those already known; and these reasons, though at first rejected, were
yet proved by subsequent experience, and were the causes and beginnings
of the greatest events.</p>
<ol start="93" type="I">
<li><p>Let us begin from God, and show that our pursuit from its
exceeding goodness clearly proceeds from him, the author of good and
father of light. Now, in all divine works the smallest beginnings lead
assuredly to some result, and the remark in spiritual matters that “the
kingdom of God cometh without observation,” is also found to be true in
every great work of Divine Providence, so that everything glides quietly
on without confusion or noise, and the matter is achieved before men
either think or perceive that it is commenced. Nor should we neglect to
mention the prophecy of Daniel, of the last days of the world, “Many
shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased,”56 thus plainly
hinting and suggesting that fate (which is Providence) would cause the
complete circuit of the globe (now accomplished, or at least going
forward by means of so many distant voyages), and the increase of
learning to happen at the same epoch.</p></li>
<li><p>We will next give a most potent reason for hope deduced from the
errors of the past, and the ways still unattempted; for well was an
ill-governed state thus reproved, “That which is worst with regard to
the past should appear most consolatory for the future; for if you had
done all that your duty commanded, and your affairs proceeded no better,
you could not even hope for their improvement; but since their present
unhappy situation is not owing to the force of circumstances, but to
your own errors, you have reason to hope that by banishing or correcting
the latter you can produce a great change for the better in the former.”
So if men had, during the many years that have elapsed, adhered to the
right way of discovering and cultivating the sciences without being able
to advance, it would be assuredly bold and presumptuous to imagine it
possible to improve; but if they have mistaken the way and wasted their
labor on improper objects, it follows that the difficulty does not arise
from things themselves, which are not in our power, but from the human
understanding, its practice and application, which is susceptible of
remedy and correction. Our best plan, therefore, is to expose these
errors; for in proportion as they impeded the past, so do they afford
reason to hope for the future. And although we have touched upon them
above, yet we think it right to give a brief, bare, and simple
enumeration of them in this place.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who have treated of the sciences have been either empirics
or dogmatical.57 The former like ants only heap up and use their store,
the latter like spiders spin out their own webs. The bee, a mean between
both, extracts matter from the flowers of the garden and the field, but
works and fashions it by its own efforts. The true labor of philosophy
resembles hers, for it neither relies entirely or principally on the
powers of the mind, nor yet lays up in the memory the matter afforded by
the experiments of natural history and mechanics in its raw state, but
changes and works it in the understanding. We have good reason,
therefore, to derive hope from a closer and purer alliance of these
faculties (the experimental and rational) than has yet been
attempted.</p></li>
<li><p>Natural philosophy is not yet to be found unadulterated, but is
impure and corrupted — by logic in the school of Aristotle, by natural
theology in that of Plato,58 by mathematics in the second school of
Plato (that of Proclus and others)59 which ought rather to terminate
natural philosophy than to generate or create it. We may, therefore,
hope for better results from pure and unmixed natural
philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>No one has yet been found possessed of sufficient firmness and
severity to resolve upon and undertake the task of entirely abolishing
common theories and notions, and applying the mind afresh, when thus
cleared and levelled, to particular researches; hence our human
reasoning is a mere farrago and crude mass made up of a great deal of
credulity and accident, and the puerile notions it originally
contracted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But if a man of mature age, unprejudiced senses, and clear mind,
would betake himself anew to experience and particulars, we might hope
much more from such a one; in which respect we promise ourselves the
fortune of Alexander the Great, and let none accuse us of vanity till
they have heard the tale, which is intended to check vanity.</p>
<p>For Æschines spoke thus of Alexander and his exploits: “We live not
the life of mortals, but are born at such a period that posterity will
relate and declare our prodigies”; as if he considered the exploits of
Alexander to be miraculous.</p>
<p>But in succeeding ages60 Livy took a better view of the fact, and has
made some such observation as this upon Alexander: “That he did no more
than dare to despise insignificance.” So in our opinion posterity will
judge of us, that we have achieved no great matters, but only set less
account upon what is considered important; for the meantime (as we have
before observed) our only hope is in the regeneration of the sciences,
by regularly raising them on the foundation of experience and building
them anew, which I think none can venture to affirm to have been already
done or even thought of.</p>
<ol start="98" type="I">
<li><p>The foundations of experience (our sole resource) have hitherto
failed completely or have been very weak; nor has a store and collection
of particular facts, capable of informing the mind or in any way
satisfactory, been either sought after or amassed. On the contrary,
learned, but idle and indolent, men have received some mere reports of
experience, traditions as it were of dreams, as establishing or
confirming their philosophy, and have not hesitated to allow them the
weight of legitimate evidence. So that a system has been pursued in
philosophy with regard to experience resembling that of a kingdom or
state which would direct its councils and affairs according to the
gossip of city and street politicians, instead of the letters and
reports of ambassadors and messengers worthy of credit. Nothing is
rightly inquired into, or verified, noted, weighed, or measured, in
natural history; indefinite and vague observation produces fallacious
and uncertain information. If this appear strange, or our complaint
somewhat too unjust (because Aristotle himself, so distinguished a man
and supported by the wealth of so great a king, has completed an
accurate history of animals, to which others with greater diligence but
less noise have made considerable additions, and others again have
composed copious histories and notices of plants, metals, and fossils),
it will arise from a want of sufficiently attending to and comprehending
our present observations; for a natural history compiled on its own
account, and one collected for the mind’s information as a foundation
for philosophy, are two different things. They differ in several
respects, but principally in this — the former contains only the
varieties of natural species without the experiments of mechanical arts;
for as in ordinary life every person’s disposition, and the concealed
feelings of the mind and passions are most drawn out when they are
disturbed — so the secrets of nature betray themselves more readily when
tormented by art than when left to their own course. We must begin,
therefore, to entertain hopes of natural philosophy then only, when we
have a better compilation of natural history, its real basis and
support.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, even in the abundance of mechanical experiments, there is
a very great scarcity of those which best inform and assist the
understanding. For the mechanic, little solicitous about the
investigation of truth, neither directs his attention, nor applies his
hand to anything that is not of service to his business. But our hope of
further progress in the sciences will then only be well founded, when
numerous experiments shall be received and collected into natural
history, which, though of no use in themselves, assist materially in the
discovery of causes and axioms; which experiments we have termed
enlightening, to distinguish them from those which are profitable. They
possess this wonderful property and nature, that they never deceive or
fail you; for being used only to discover the natural cause of some
object, whatever be the result, they equally satisfy your aim by
deciding the question.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>C. We must not only search for, and procure a greater number of
experiments, but also introduce a completely different method, order,
and progress of continuing and promoting experience. For vague and
arbitrary experience is (as we have observed), mere groping in the dark,
and rather astonishes than instructs. But when experience shall proceed
regularly and uninterruptedly by a determined rule, we may entertain
better hopes of the sciences.</p>
<ol start="101" type="I">
<li><p>But after having collected and prepared an abundance and store of
natural history, and of the experience required for the operations of
the understanding or philosophy, still the understanding is as incapable
of acting on such materials of itself, with the aid of memory alone, as
any person would be of retaining and achieving, by memory, the
computation of an almanac. Yet meditation has hitherto done more for
discovery than writing, and no experiments have been committed to paper.
We cannot, however, approve of any mode of discovery without writing,
and when that comes into more general use, we may have further
hopes.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides this, there is such a multitude and host, as it were, of
particular objects, and lying so widely dispersed, as to distract and
confuse the understanding; and we can, therefore, hope for no advantage
from its skirmishing, and quick movements and incursions, unless we put
its forces in due order and array, by means of proper and well arranged,
and, as it were, living tables of discovery of these matters, which are
the subject of investigation, and the mind then apply itself to the
ready prepared and digested aid which such tables afford.</p></li>
<li><p>When we have thus properly and regularly placed before the eyes a
collection of particulars, we must not immediately proceed to the
investigation and discovery of new particulars or effects, or, at least,
if we do so, must not rest satisfied therewith. For, though we do not
deny that by transferring the experiments from one art to another (when
all the experiments of each have been collected and arranged, and have
been acquired by the knowledge, and subjected to the judgment of a
single individual), many new experiments may be discovered tending to
benefit society and mankind, by what we term literate experience; yet
comparatively insignificant results are to be expected thence, while the
more important are to be derived from the new light of axioms, deduced
by certain method and rule from the above particulars, and pointing out
and defining new particulars in their turn. Our road is not a long
plain, but rises and falls, ascending to axioms, and descending to
effects.</p></li>
<li><p>Nor can we suffer the understanding to jump and fly from
particulars to remote and most general axioms (such as are termed the
principles of arts and things), and thus prove and make out their
intermediate axioms according to the supposed unshaken truth of the
former. This, however, has always been done to the present time from the
natural bent of the understanding, educated too, and accustomed to this
very method, by the syllogistic mode of demonstration. But we can then
only augur well for the sciences, when the assent shall proceed by a
true scale and successive steps, without interruption or breach, from
particulars to the lesser axioms, thence to the intermediate (rising one
above the other), and lastly, to the most general. For the lowest axioms
differ but little from bare experiment;61 the highest and most general
(as they are esteemed at present), are notional, abstract, and of no
real weight. The intermediate are true, solid, full of life, and upon
them depend the business and fortune of mankind; beyond these are the
really general, but not abstract, axioms, which are truly limited by the
intermediate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We must not then add wings, but rather lead and ballast to the
understanding, to prevent its jumping or flying, which has not yet been
done; but whenever this takes place, we may entertain greater hopes of
the sciences.</p>
<ol start="105" type="I">
<li><p>In forming axioms, we must invent a different form of induction
from that hitherto in use; not only for the proof and discovery of
principles (as they are called), but also of minor, intermediate, and,
in short, every kind of axioms. The induction which proceeds by simple
enumeration is puerile, leads to uncertain conclusions, and is exposed
to danger from one contradictory instance, deciding generally from too
small a number of facts, and those only the most obvious. But a really
useful induction for the discovery and demonstration of the arts and
sciences, should separate nature by proper rejections and exclusions,
and then conclude for the affirmative, after collecting a sufficient
number of negatives. Now this has not been done, nor even attempted,
except perhaps by Plato, who certainly uses this form of induction in
some measure, to sift definitions and ideas. But much of what has never
yet entered the thoughts of man must necessarily be employed, in order
to exhibit a good and legitimate mode of induction or demonstration, so
as even to render it essential for us to bestow more pains upon it than
have hitherto been bestowed on syllogisms. The assistance of induction
is to serve us not only in the discovery of axioms, but also in defining
our notions. Much indeed is to be hoped from such an induction as has
been described.</p></li>
<li><p>In forming our axioms from induction, we must examine and try
whether the axiom we derive be only fitted and calculated for the
particular instances from which it is deduced, or whether it be more
extensive and general. If it be the latter, we must observe, whether it
confirm its own extent and generality by giving surety, as it were, in
pointing out new particulars, so that we may neither stop at actual
discoveries, nor with a careless grasp catch at shadows and abstract
forms, instead of substances of a determinate nature: and as soon as we
act thus, well authorized hope may with reason be said to beam upon
us.</p></li>
<li><p>Here, too, we may again repeat what we have said above,
concerning the extending of natural philosophy and reducing particular
sciences to that one, so as to prevent any schism or dismembering of the
sciences; without which we cannot hope to advance.</p></li>
<li><p>Such are the observations we would make in order to remove
despair and excite hope, by bidding farewell to the errors of past ages,
or by their correction. Let us examine whether there be other grounds
for hope. And, first, if many useful discoveries have occurred to
mankind by chance or opportunity, without investigation or attention on
their part, it must necessarily be acknowledged that much more may be
brought to light by investigation and attention, if it be regular and
orderly, not hasty and interrupted. For although it may now and then
happen that one falls by chance upon something that had before escaped
considerable efforts and laborious inquiries, yet undoubtedly the
reverse is generally the case. We may, therefore, hope for further,
better, and more frequent results from man’s reason, industry, method,
and application, than from chance and mere animal instinct, and the
like, which have hitherto been the sources of invention.</p></li>
<li><p>We may also derive some reason for hope from the circumstance of
several actual inventions being of such a nature, that scarcely any one
could have formed a conjecture about them previously to their discovery,
but would rather have ridiculed them as impossible. For men are wont to
guess about new subjects from those they are already acquainted with,
and the hasty and vitiated fancies they have thence formed: than which
there cannot be a more fallacious mode of reasoning, because much of
that which is derived from the sources of things does not flow in their
usual channel.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If, for instance, before the discovery of cannon, one had described
its effects in the following manner: There is a new invention by which
walls and the greatest bulwarks can be shaken and overthrown from a
considerable distance; men would have begun to contrive various means of
multiplying the force of projectiles and machines by means of weights
and wheels, and other modes of battering and projecting. But it is
improbable that any imagination or fancy would have hit upon a fiery
blast, expanding and developing itself so suddenly and violently,
because none would have seen an instance at all resembling it, except
perhaps in earthquakes or thunder, which they would have immediately
rejected as the great operations of nature, not to be imitated by
man.</p>
<p>So, if before the discovery of silk thread, any one had observed,
that a species of thread had been discovered, fit for dresses and
furniture, far surpassing the thread of worsted or flax in fineness, and
at the same time in tenacity, beauty, and softness; men would have begun
to imagine something about Chinese plants, or the fine hair of some
animals, or the feathers or down of birds, but certainly would never
have had an idea of its being spun by a small worm, in so copious a
manner, and renewed annually. But if any one had ventured to suggest the
silkworm, he would have been laughed at as if dreaming of some new
manufacture from spiders.</p>
<p>So again, if before the discovery of the compass, any one had said,
that an instrument had been invented, by which the quarters and points
of the heavens could be exactly taken and distinguished, men would have
entered into disquisitions on the refinement of astronomical
instruments, and the like, from the excitement of their imaginations;
but the thought of anything being discovered, which, not being a
celestial body, but a mere mineral or metallic substance, should yet in
its motion agree with that of such bodies, would have appeared
absolutely incredible. Yet were these facts, and the like (unknown for
so many ages) not discovered at last either by philosophy or reasoning,
but by chance and opportunity; and (as we have observed), they are of a
nature most heterogeneous, and remote from what was hitherto known, so
that no previous knowledge could lead to them.</p>
<p>We may, therefore, well hope62 that many excellent and useful matters
are yet treasured up in the bosom of nature, bearing no relation or
analogy to our actual discoveries, but out of the common track of our
imagination, and still undiscovered, and which will doubtless be brought
to light in the course and lapse of years, as the others have been
before them; but in the way we now point out, they may rapidly and at
once be both represented and anticipated.</p>
<ol start="110" type="I">
<li>There are, moreover, some inventions which render it probable that
men may pass and hurry over the most noble discoveries which lie
immediately before them. For however the discovery of gunpowder, silk,
the compass, sugar, paper, or the like, may appear to depend on peculiar
properties of things and nature, printing at least involves no
contrivance which is not clear and almost obvious. But from want of
observing that although the arrangement of the types of letters required
more trouble than writing with the hand, yet these types once arranged
serve for innumerable impressions, while manuscript only affords one
copy; and again, from want of observing that ink might be thickened so
as to stain without running (which was necessary, seeing the letters
face upward, and the impression is made from above), this most beautiful
invention (which assists so materially the propagation of learning)
remained unknown for so many ages.</li>
</ol>
<p>The human mind is often so awkward and ill-regulated in the career of
invention that it is at first diffident, and then despises itself. For
it appears at first incredible that any such discovery should be made,
and when it has been made, it appears incredible that it should so long
have escaped men’s research. All which affords good reason for the hope
that a vast mass of inventions yet remains, which may be deduced not
only from the investigation of new modes of operation, but also from
transferring, comparing, and applying these already known, by the method
of what we have termed literate experience.</p>
<ol start="111" type="I">
<li><p>Nor should we omit another ground of hope. Let men only consider
(if they will) their infinite expenditure of talent, time, and fortune,
in matters and studies of far inferior importance and value; a small
portion of which applied to sound and solid learning would be sufficient
to overcome every difficulty. And we have thought right to add this
observation, because we candidly own that such a collection of natural
and experimental history as we have traced in our own mind, and as is
really necessary, is a great and as it were royal work, requiring much
labor and expense.</p></li>
<li><p>In the meantime let no one be alarmed at the multitude of
particulars, but rather inclined to hope on that very account. For the
particular phenomena of the arts and nature are in reality but as a
handful, when compared with the fictions of the imagination removed and
separated from the evidence of facts. The termination of our method is
clear, and I had almost said near at hand; the other admits of no
termination, but only of infinite confusion. For men have hitherto dwelt
but little, or rather only slightly touched upon experience, while they
have wasted much time on theories and the fictions of the imagination.
If we had but any one who could actually answer our interrogations of
nature, the invention of all causes and sciences would be the labor of
but a few years.</p></li>
<li><p>We think some ground of hope is afforded by our own example,
which is not mentioned for the sake of boasting, but as a useful remark.
Let those who distrust their own powers observe myself, one who have
among my contemporaries been the most engaged in public business, who am
not very strong in health (which causes a great loss of time), and am
the first explorer of this course, following the guidance of none, nor
even communicating my thoughts to a single individual; yet having once
firmly entered in the right way, and submitting the powers of my mind to
things, I have somewhat advanced (as I make bold to think) the matter I
now treat of. Then let others consider what may be hoped from men who
enjoy abundant leisure, from united labors, and the succession of ages,
after these suggestions on our part, especially in a course which is not
confined, like theories, to individuals, but admits of the best
distribution and union of labor and effect, particularly in collecting
experiments. For men will then only begin to know their own power, when
each performs a separate part, instead of undertaking in crowds the same
work.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, though a much more faint and uncertain breeze of hope
were to spring up from our new continent, yet we consider it necessary
to make the experiment, if we would not show a dastard spirit. For the
risk attending want of success is not to be compared with that of
neglecting the attempt; the former is attended with the loss of a little
human labor, the latter with that of an immense benefit. For these and
other reasons it appears to us that there is abundant ground to hope,
and to induce not only those who are sanguine to make experiment, but
even those who are cautious and sober to give their assent.</p></li>
<li><p>Such are the grounds for banishing despair, hitherto one of the
most powerful causes of the delay and restraint to which the sciences
have been subjected; in treating of which we have at the same time
discussed the signs and causes of the errors, idleness, and ignorance
that have prevailed; seeing especially that the more refined causes,
which are not open to popular judgment and observation, may be referred
to our remarks on the idols of the human mind.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, too, we should close the demolishing branch of our
Instauration, which is comprised in three confutations: 1, the
confutation of natural human reason left to itself; 2, the confutation
of demonstration; 3, the confutation of theories, or received systems of
philosophy and doctrines. Our confutation has followed such a course as
was open to it, namely, the exposing of the signs of error, and the
producing evidence of the causes of it: for we could adopt no other,
differing as we do both in first principles and demonstrations from
others.</p>
<p>It is time for us therefore to come to the art itself, and the rule
for the interpretation of nature: there is, however, still something
which must not be passed over. For the intent of this first book of
aphorisms being to prepare the mind for understanding, as well as
admitting, what follows, we must now, after having cleansed, polished,
and levelled its surface, place it in a good position, and as it were a
benevolent aspect toward our propositions; seeing that prejudice in new
matters may be produced not only by the strength of preconceived
notions, but also by a false anticipation or expectation of the matter
proposed. We shall therefore endeavor to induce good and correct
opinions of what we offer, although this be only necessary for the
moment, and as it were laid out at interest, until the matter itself be
well understood.</p>
<ol start="116" type="I">
<li>First, then, we must desire men not to suppose that we are ambitious
of founding any philosophical sect, like the ancient Greeks, or some
moderns, as Telesius, Patricius, and Severinus.63 For neither is this
our intention, nor do we think that peculiar abstract opinions on nature
and the principles of things are of much importance to men’s fortunes,
since it were easy to revive many ancient theories, and to introduce
many new ones; as, for instance, many hypotheses with regard to the
heavens can be formed, differing in themselves, and yet sufficiently
according with the phenomena.</li>
</ol>
<p>We bestow not our labor on such theoretical and, at the same time,
useless topics. On the contrary, our determination is that of trying,
whether we can lay a firmer foundation, and extend to a greater distance
the boundaries of human power and dignity. And although here and there,
upon some particular points, we hold (in our own opinion) more true and
certain, and I might even say, more advantageous tenets than those in
general repute (which we have collected in the fifth part of our
Instauration), yet we offer no universal or complete theory. The time
does not yet appear to us to be arrived, and we entertain no hope of our
life being prolonged to the completion of the sixth part of the
Instauration (which is destined for philosophy discovered by the
interpretation of nature), but are content if we proceed quietly and
usefully in our intermediate pursuit, scattering, in the meantime, the
seeds of less adulterated truth for posterity, and, at least, commence
the great work.</p>
<ol start="117" type="I">
<li>And, as we pretend not to found a sect, so do we neither offer nor
promise particular effects; which may occasion some to object to us,
that since we so often speak of effects, and consider everything in its
relation to that end, we ought also to give some earnest of producing
them. Our course and method, however (as we have often said, and again
repeat), is such as not to deduce effects from effects, nor experiments
from experiments (as the empirics do), but in our capacity of legitimate
interpreters of nature, to deduce causes and axioms from effects and
experiments; and new effects and experiments from those causes and
axioms.</li>
</ol>
<p>And although any one of moderate intelligence and ability will
observe the indications and sketches of many noble effects in our tables
of inventions (which form the fourth part of the Instauration), and also
in the examples of particular instances cited in the second part, as
well as in our observations on history (which is the subject of the
third part); yet we candidly confess that our present natural history,
whether compiled from books or our own inquiries, is not sufficiently
copious and well ascertained to satisfy, or even assist, a proper
interpretation.</p>
<p>If, therefore, there be any one who is more disposed and prepared for
mechanical art, and ingenious in discovering effects, than in the mere
management of experiment, we allow him to employ his industry in
gathering many of the fruits of our history and tables in this way, and
applying them to effects, receiving them as interest till he can obtain
the principal. For our own part, having a greater object in view, we
condemn all hasty and premature rest in such pursuits as we would
Atalanta’s apple (to use a common allusion of ours); for we are not
childishly ambitious of golden fruit, but use all our efforts to make
the course of art outstrip nature, and we hasten not to reap moss or the
green blade, but wait for a ripe harvest.</p>
<ol start="118" type="I">
<li><p>There will be some, without doubt, who, on a perusal of our
history and tables of invention, will meet with some uncertainty, or
perhaps fallacy, in the experiments themselves, and will thence perhaps
imagine that our discoveries are built on false foundations and
principles. There is, however, really nothing in this, since it must
needs happen in beginnings.64 For it is the same as if in writing or
printing one or two letters were wrongly turned or misplaced, which is
no great inconvenience to the reader, who can easily by his own eye
correct the error; let men in the same way conclude, that many
experiments in natural history may be erroneously believed and admitted,
which are easily expunged and rejected afterward, by the discovery of
causes and axioms. It is, however, true, that if these errors in natural
history and experiments become great, frequent, and continued, they
cannot be corrected and amended by any dexterity of wit or art. If then,
even in our natural history, well examined and compiled with such
diligence, strictness, and (I might say) reverential scruples, there be
now and then something false and erroneous in the details, what must we
say of the common natural history, which is so negligent and careless
when compared with ours? or of systems of philosophy and the sciences,
based on such loose soil (or rather quicksand)? Let none then be alarmed
by such observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, our history and experiments will contain much that is
light and common, mean and illiberal, too refined and merely
speculative, and, as it were, of no use, and this perhaps may divert and
alienate the attention of mankind.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With regard to what is common; let men reflect, that they have
hitherto been used to do nothing but refer and adapt the causes of
things of rare occurrence to those of things which more frequently
happen, without any investigation of the causes of the latter, taking
them for granted and admitted.</p>
<p>Hence, they do not inquire into the causes of gravity, the rotation
of the heavenly bodies, heat, cold, light, hardness, softness, rarity,
density, liquidity, solidity, animation, inanimation, similitude,
difference, organic formation, but taking them to be self-evident,
manifest, and admitted, they dispute and decide upon other matters of
less frequent and familiar occurrence.</p>
<p>But we (who know that no judgment can be formed of that which is rare
or remarkable, and much less anything new brought to light, without a
previous regular examination and discovery of the causes of that which
is common, and the causes again of those causes) are necessarily
compelled to admit the most common objects into our history. Besides, we
have observed that nothing has been so injurious to philosophy as this
circumstance, namely, that familiar and frequent objects do not arrest
and detain men’s contemplation, but are carelessly admitted, and their
causes never inquired after; so that information on unknown subjects is
not more often wanted than attention to those which are known.</p>
<ol start="120" type="I">
<li><p>With regard to the meanness, or even the filthiness of
particulars, for which (as Pliny observes), an apology is requisite,
such subjects are no less worthy of admission into natural history than
the most magnificent and costly; nor do they at all pollute natural
history, for the sun enters alike the palace and the privy, and is not
thereby polluted. We neither dedicate nor raise a capitol or pyramid to
the pride of man, but rear a holy temple in his mind, on the model of
the universe, which model therefore we imitate. For that which is
deserving of existence is deserving of knowledge, the image of
existence. Now the mean and splendid alike exist. Nay, as the finest
odors are sometimes produced from putrid matter (such as musk and
civet), so does valuable light and information emanate from mean and
sordid instances. But we have already said too much, for such fastidious
feelings are childish and effeminate.</p></li>
<li><p>The next point requires a more accurate consideration, namely,
that many parts of our history will appear to the vulgar, or even any
mind accustomed to the present state of things, fantastically and
uselessly refined. Hence, we have in regard to this matter said from the
first, and must again repeat, that we look for experiments that shall
afford light rather than profit, imitating the divine creation, which,
as we have often observed, only produced light on the first day, and
assigned that whole day to its creation, without adding any material
work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If any one, then, imagine such matters to be of no use, he might
equally suppose light to be of no use, because it is neither solid nor
material. For, in fact, the knowledge of simple natures, when
sufficiently investigated and defined, resembles light, which, though of
no great use in itself, affords access to the general mysteries of
effects, and with a peculiar power comprehends and draws with it whole
bands and troops of effects, and the sources of the most valuable
axioms. So also the elements of letters have of themselves separately no
meaning, and are of no use, yet are they, as it were, the original
matter in the composition and preparation of speech. The seeds of
substances, whose effect is powerful, are of no use except in their
growth, and the scattered rays of light itself avail not unless
collected.</p>
<p>But if speculative subtilties give offence, what must we say of the
scholastic philosophers who indulged in them to such excess? And those
subtilties were wasted on words, or, at least, common notions (which is
the same thing), not on things or nature, and alike unproductive of
benefit in their origin and their consequences: in no way resembling
ours, which are at present useless, but in their consequences of
infinite benefit. Let men be assured that all subtile disputes and
discursive efforts of the mind are late and preposterous, when they are
introduced subsequently to the discovery of axioms, and that their true,
or, at any rate, chief opportunity is, when experiment is to be weighed
and axioms to be derived from it. They otherwise catch and grasp at
nature, but never seize or detain her: and we may well apply to nature
that which has been said of opportunity or fortune, that she wears a
lock in front, but is bald behind.</p>
<p>In short, we may reply decisively to those who despise any part of
natural history as being vulgar, mean, or subtile, and useless in its
origin, in the words of a poor woman to a haughty prince,65 who had
rejected her petition as unworthy, and beneath the dignity of his
majesty: “Then cease to reign”; for it is quite certain that the empire
of nature can neither be obtained nor administered by one who refuses to
pay attention to such matters as being poor and too minute.</p>
<ol start="122" type="I">
<li>Again, it may be objected to us as being singular and harsh, that we
should with one stroke and assault, as it were, banish all authorities
and sciences, and that too by our own efforts, without requiring the
assistance and support of any of the ancients.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we are aware, that had we been ready to act otherwise than
sincerely, it was not difficult to refer our present method to remote
ages, prior to those of the Greeks (since the sciences in all
probability flourished more in their natural state, though silently,
than when they were paraded with the fifes and trumpets of the Greeks);
or even (in parts, at least) to some of the Greeks themselves, and to
derive authority and honor from thence; as men of no family labor to
raise and form nobility for themselves in some ancient line, by the help
of genealogies. Trusting, however, to the evidence of facts, we reject
every kind of fiction and imposture; and think it of no more consequence
to our subject, whether future discoveries were known to the ancients,
and set or rose according to the vicissitudes of events and lapse of
ages, than it would be of importance to mankind to know whether the new
world be the island of Atlantis,66 and known to the ancients, or be now
discovered for the first time.</p>
<p>With regard to the universal censure we have bestowed, it is quite
clear, to any one who properly considers the matter, that it is both
more probable and more modest than any partial one could have been. For
if the errors had not been rooted in the primary notions, some well
conducted discoveries must have corrected others that were deficient.
But since the errors were fundamental, and of such a nature, that men
may be said rather to have neglected or passed over things, than to have
formed a wrong or false judgment of them, it is little to be wondered
at, that they did not obtain what they never aimed at, nor arrive at a
goal which they had not determined, nor perform a course which they had
neither entered upon nor adhered to.</p>
<p>With regard to our presumption, we allow that if we were to assume a
power of drawing a more perfect straight line or circle than any one
else, by superior steadiness of hand or acuteness of eye, it would lead
to a comparison of talent; but if one merely assert that he can draw a
more perfect line or circle with a ruler or compasses, than another can
by his unassisted hand or eye, he surely cannot be said to boast of
much. Now this applies not only to our first original attempt, but also
to those who shall hereafter apply themselves to the pursuit. For our
method of discovering the sciences merely levels men’s wits, and leaves
but little to their superiority, since it achieves everything by the
most certain rules and demonstrations. Whence (as we have often
observed), our attempt is to be attributed to fortune rather than
talent, and is the offspring of time rather than of wit. For a certain
sort of chance has no less effect upon our thoughts than on our acts and
deeds.</p>
<ol start="123" type="I">
<li><p>We may, therefore, apply to ourselves the joke of him who said,
that water and wine drinkers could not think alike,67 especially as it
hits the matter so well. For others, both ancients and moderns, have in
the sciences drank a crude liquor like water, either flowing of itself
from the understanding, or drawn up by logic as the wheel draws up the
bucket. But we drink and pledge others with a liquor made of many
well-ripened grapes, collected and plucked from particular branches,
squeezed in the press, and at last clarified and fermented in a vessel.
It is not, therefore, wonderful that we should not agree with
others.</p></li>
<li><p>Another objection will without doubt be made, namely, that we
have not ourselves established a correct, or the best goal or aim of the
sciences (the very defect we blame in others). For they will say that
the contemplation of truth is more dignified and exalted than any
utility or extent of effects; but that our dwelling so long and
anxiously on experience and matter, and the fluctuating state of
particulars, fastens the mind to earth, or rather casts it down into an
abyss of confusion and disturbance, and separates and removes it from a
much more divine state, the quiet and tranquillity of abstract wisdom.
We willingly assent to their reasoning, and are most anxious to effect
the very point they hint at and require. For we are founding a real
model of the world in the understanding, such as it is found to be, not
such as man’s reason has distorted. Now this cannot be done without
dissecting and anatomizing the world most diligently; but we declare it
necessary to destroy completely the vain, little and, as it were, apish
imitations of the world, which have been formed in various systems of
philosophy by men’s fancies. Let men learn (as we have said above) the
difference that exists between the idols of the human mind and the ideas
of the divine mind. The former are mere arbitrary abstractions; the
latter the true marks of the Creator on his creatures, as they are
imprinted on, and defined in matter, by true and exquisite touches.
Truth, therefore, and utility, are here perfectly identical, and the
effects are of more value as pledges of truth than from the benefit they
confer on men.</p></li>
<li><p>Others may object that we are only doing that which has already
been done, and that the ancients followed the same course as ourselves.
They may imagine, therefore, that, after all this stir and exertion, we
shall at last arrive at some of those systems that prevailed among the
ancients: for that they, too, when commencing their meditations, laid up
a great store of instances and particulars, and digested them under
topics and titles in their commonplace books, and so worked out their
systems and arts, and then decided upon what they discovered, and
related now and then some examples to confirm and throw light upon their
doctrine; but thought it superfluous and troublesome to publish their
notes, minutes, and commonplaces, and therefore followed the example of
builders who remove the scaffolding and ladders when the building is
finished. Nor can we indeed believe the case to have been otherwise. But
to any one, not entirely forgetful of our previous observations, it will
be easy to answer this objection or rather scruple; for we allow that
the ancients had a particular form of investigation and discovery, and
their writings show it. But it was of such a nature, that they
immediately flew from a few instances and particulars (after adding some
common notions, and a few generally received opinions most in vogue) to
the most general conclusions or the principles of the sciences, and then
by their intermediate propositions deduced their inferior conclusions,
and tried them by the test of the immovable and settled truth of the
first, and so constructed their art. Lastly, if some new particulars and
instances were brought forward, which contradicted their dogmas, they
either with great subtilty reduced them to one system, by distinctions
or explanations of their own rules, or got rid of them clumsily as
exceptions, laboring most pertinaciously in the meantime to accommodate
the causes of such as were not contradictory to their own principles.
Their natural history and their experience were both far from being what
they ought to have been, and their flying off to generalities ruined
everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Another objection will be made against us, that we prohibit
decisions and the laying down of certain principles, till we arrive
regularly at generalities by the intermediate steps, and thus keep the
judgment in suspense and lead to uncertainty. But our object is not
uncertainty but fitting certainty, for we derogate not from the senses
but assist them, and despise not the understanding but direct it. It is
better to know what is necessary, and not to imagine we are fully in
possession of it, than to imagine that we are fully in possession of it,
and yet in reality to know nothing which we ought.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, some may raise this question rather than objection,
whether we talk of perfecting natural philosophy alone according to our
method, or the other sciences also, such as logic, ethics, politics. We
certainly intend to comprehend them all. And as common logic, which
regulates matters by syllogisms, is applied not only to natural, but
also to every other science, so our inductive method likewise
comprehends them all.68 For we form a history and tables of invention
for anger, fear, shame, and the like, and also for examples in civil
life, and the mental operations of memory, composition, division,
judgment, and the rest, as well as for heat and cold, light, vegetation,
and the like. But since our method of interpretation, after preparing
and arranging a history, does not content itself with examining the
operations and disquisitions of the mind like common logic, but also
inspects the nature of things, we so regulate the mind that it may be
enabled to apply itself in every respect correctly to that nature. On
that account we deliver numerous and various precepts in our doctrine of
interpretation, so that they may apply in some measure to the method of
discovering the quality and condition of the subject matter of
investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Let none even doubt whether we are anxious to destroy and
demolish the philosophy, arts, and sciences, which are now in use. On
the contrary, we readily cherish their practice, cultivation, and honor;
for we by no means interfere to prevent the prevalent system from
encouraging discussion, adorning discourses, or being employed
serviceably in the chair of the professor or the practice of common
life, and being taken, in short, by general consent as current coin.
Nay, we plainly declare, that the system we offer will not be very
suitable for such purposes, not being easily adapted to vulgar
apprehensions, except by effects and works. To show our sincerity in
professing our regard and friendly disposition toward the received
sciences, we can refer to the evidence of our published writings
(especially our books on the Advancement of Learning). We will not,
therefore, endeavor to evince it any further by words; but content
ourselves with steadily and professedly premising, that no great
progress can be made by the present methods in the theory or
contemplation of science, and that they cannot be made to produce any
very abundant effects.</p></li>
<li><p>It remains for us to say a few words on the excellence of our
proposed end. If we had done so before, we might have appeared merely to
express our wishes, but now that we have excited hope and removed
prejudices, it will perhaps have greater weight. Had we performed and
completely accomplished the whole, without frequently calling in others
to assist in our labors, we should then have refrained from saying any
more, lest we should be thought to extol our own deserts. Since,
however, the industry of others must be quickened, and their courage
roused and inflamed, it is right to recall some points to their
memory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>First, then, the introduction of great inventions appears one of the
most distinguished of human actions, and the ancients so considered it;
for they assigned divine honors to the authors of inventions, but only
heroic honors to those who displayed civil merit (such as the founders
of cities and empire legislators, the deliverers of their country from
lasting misfortunes, the quellers of tyrants, and the like). And if any
one rightly compare them, he will find the judgment of antiquity to be
correct; for the benefits derived from inventions may extend to mankind
in general, but civil benefits to particular spots alone; the latter,
moreover, last but for a time, the former forever. Civil reformation
seldom is carried on without violence and confusion, while inventions
are a blessing and a benefit without injuring or afflicting any.</p>
<p>Inventions are also, as it were, new creations and imitations of
divine works, as was expressed by the poet:69</p>
<p>“Primum frugiferos fœtus mortalibus ægris Dididerant quondam
præstanti nomine Athenæ Et recreaverunt vitam legesque rogarunt.”</p>
<p>And it is worthy of remark in Solomon, that while he flourished in
the possession of his empire, in wealth, in the magnificence of his
works, in his court, his household, his fleet, the splendor of his name,
and the most unbounded admiration of mankind, he still placed his glory
in none of these, but declared70 that it is the glory of God to conceal
a thing, but the glory of a king to search it out.</p>
<p>Again, let any one but consider the immense difference between men’s
lives in the most polished countries of Europe, and in any wild and
barbarous region of the new Indies, he will think it so great, that man
may be said to be a god unto man, not only on account of mutual aid and
benefits, but from their comparative states — the result of the arts,
and not of the soil or climate.</p>
<p>Again, we should notice the force, effect, and consequences of
inventions, which are nowhere more conspicuous than in those three which
were unknown to the ancients; namely, printing, gunpowder, and the
compass. For these three have changed the appearance and state of the
whole world: first in literature, then in warfare, and lastly in
navigation; and innumerable changes have been thence derived, so that no
empire, sect, or star, appears to have exercised a greater power and
influence on human affairs than these mechanical discoveries.</p>
<p>It will, perhaps, be as well to distinguish three species and degrees
of ambition. First, that of men who are anxious to enlarge their own
power in their country, which is a vulgar and degenerate kind; next,
that of men who strive to enlarge the power and empire of their country
over mankind, which is more dignified but not less covetous; but if one
were to endeavor to renew and enlarge the power and empire of mankind in
general over the universe, such ambition (if it may be so termed) is
both more sound and more noble than the other two. Now the empire of man
over things is founded on the arts and sciences alone, for nature is
only to be commanded by obeying her.</p>
<p>Besides this, if the benefit of any particular invention has had such
an effect as to induce men to consider him greater than a man, who has
thus obliged the whole race, how much more exalted will that discovery
be, which leads to the easy discovery of everything else! Yet (to speak
the truth) in the same manner as we are very thankful for light which
enables us to enter on our way, to practice arts, to read, to
distinguish each other, and yet sight is more excellent and beautiful
than the various uses of light; so is the contemplation of things as
they are, free from superstition or imposture, error or confusion, much
more dignified in itself than all the advantage to be derived from
discoveries.</p>
<p>Lastly, let none be alarmed at the objection of the arts and sciences
becoming depraved to malevolent or luxurious purposes and the like, for
the same can be said of every worldly good; talent, courage, strength,
beauty, riches, light itself, and the rest. Only let mankind regain
their rights over nature, assigned to them by the gift of God, and
obtain that power, whose exercise will be governed by right reason and
true religion.</p>
<ol start="130" type="I">
<li>But it is time for us to lay down the art of interpreting nature, to
which we attribute no absolute necessity (as if nothing could be done
without it) nor perfection, although we think that our precepts are most
useful and correct. For we are of opinion, that if men had at their
command a proper history of nature and experience, and would apply
themselves steadily to it, and could bind themselves to two things: 1,
to lay aside received opinions and notions; 2, to restrain themselves,
till the proper season, from generalization, they might, by the proper
and genuine exertion of their minds, fall into our way of interpretation
without the aid of any art. For interpretation is the true and natural
act of the mind, when all obstacles are removed: certainly, however,
everything will be more ready and better fixed by our precepts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet do we not affirm that no addition can be made to them; on the
contrary, considering the mind in its connection with things, and not
merely relatively to its own powers, we ought to be persuaded that the
art of invention can be made to grow with the inventions themselves.</p>
<p>ENDNOTES.</p>
<p>2 Bacon uses the term in its ancient sense, and means one who,
knowing the occult properties of bodies, is able to startle the ignorant
by drawing out of them wonderful and unforeseen changes. See the 85th
aphorism of this book, and the 5th cap. book iii. of the De Augmentis
Scientiarum, where he speaks more clearly. — Ed.</p>
<p>3 By this term axiomata, Bacon here speaks of general principles, or
universal laws. In the 19th aphorism he employs the term to express any
proposition collected from facts by induction, and thus fitted to become
the starting-point of deductive reasoning. In the last and more rigorous
sense of the term, Bacon held they arose from experience. See Whewell’s
“Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,” vol. i. p. 74; and Mill’s
“Logic,” vol. i. p. 311; and the June “Quarterly,” 1841, for the modern
phase of the discussion. — Ed.</p>
<p>4 Bacon here attributes to the Aristotelian logic the erroneous
consequences which sprung out of its abuse. The demonstrative forms it
exhibits, whether verbally or mathematically expressed, are necessary to
the support, verification, and extension of induction, and when the
propositions they embrace are founded on an accurate and close
observation of facts, the conclusions to which they lead, even in moral
science, may be regarded as certain as the facts wrested out of nature
by direct experiment. In physics such forms are absolutely required to
generalize the results of experience, and to connect intermediate axioms
with laws still more general, as is sufficiently attested by the fact,
that no science since Bacon’s day has ceased to be experimental by the
mere method of induction, and that all become exact only so far as they
rise above experience, and connect their isolated phenomena with general
laws by the principles of deductive reasoning. So far, then, are these
forms from being useless, that they are absolutely essential to the
advancement of the sciences, and in no case can be looked on as
detrimental, except when obtruded in the place of direct experiment, or
employed as a means of deducing conclusions about nature from imaginary
hypotheses and abstract conceptions. This had been unfortunately the
practice of the Greeks. From the rapid development geometry received in
their hands, they imagined the same method would lead to results equally
brilliant in natural science, and snatching up some abstract principle,
which they carefully removed from the test of experiment, imagined they
could reason out from it all the laws and external appearances of the
universe. The scholastics were impelled along the same path, not only by
precedent, but by profession. Theology was the only science which
received from them a consistent development, and the à priori grounds on
which it rested prevented them from employing any other method in the
pursuit of natural phenomena. Thus, forms of demonstration, in
themselves accurate, and of momentous value in their proper sphere,
became confounded with fable, and led men into the idea they were
exploring truth when they were only accurately deducing error from
error. One principle ever so slightly deflected, like a false quantity
in an equation, could be sufficient to infect the whole series of
conclusions of which it was the base; and though the philosopher might
subsequently deduce a thousand consecutive inferences with the utmost
accuracy or precision, he would only succeed in drawing out very
methodically nine hundred and ninety-nine errors. — Ed.</p>
<p>5 It would appear from this and the two preceding aphorisms, that
Bacon fell into the error of denying the utility of the syllogism in the
very part of inductive science where it is essentially required. Logic,
like mathematics, is purely a formal process, and must, as the
scaffolding to the building, be employed to arrange facts in the
structure of a science, and not to form any portion of its groundwork,
or to supply the materials of which the system is to be composed. The
word syllogism, like most other psychological terms, has no fixed or
original signification, but is sometimes employed, as it was by the
Greeks, to denote general reasoning, and at others to point out the
formal method of deducing a particular inference from two or more
general propositions. Bacon does not confine the term within the
boundaries of express definition, but leaves us to infer that he took it
in the latter sense, from his custom of associating the term with the
wranglings of the schools. The scholastics, it is true, abused the
deductive syllogism, by employing it in its naked, skeleton-like form,
and confounding it with the whole breadth of logical theory; but their
errors are not to be visited on Aristotle, who never dreamed of playing
with formal syllogisms, and, least of all, mistook the descending for
the ascending series of inference. In our mind we are of accord with the
Stagyrite, who propounds, as far as we can interpret him, two modes of
investigating truth — the one by which we ascend from particular and
singular facts to general laws and axioms, and the other by which we
descend from universal propositions to the individual cases which they
virtually include. Logic, therefore, must equally vindicate the formal
purity of the synthetic illation by which it ascends to the whole, as
the analytic process by which it descends to the parts. The deductive
and inductive syllogism are of equal significance in building up any
body of truth, and whoever restricts logic to either process, mistakes
one-half of its province for the whole; and if he acts upon his error,
will paralyze his methods, and strike the noblest part of science with
sterility. — Ed.</p>
<p>6 The Latin is, ad ea quæ revera sunt naturæ notiora. This
expression, naturæ notiora, naturæ notior, is so frequently employed by
Bacon, that we may conclude it to point to some distinguishing feature
in the Baconian physics. It properly refers to the most evident
principles and laws of nature, and springs from that system which
regards the material universe as endowed with intelligence, and acting
according to rules either fashioned or clearly understood by itself. —
Ed.</p>
<p>7 This Borgia was Alexander VI., and the expedition alluded to that
in which Charles VIII. overran the Italian peninsula in five months.
Bacon uses the same illustration in concluding his survey of natural
philosophy, in the second book of the “De Augmentis.” — Ed.</p>
<p>8 Ratio eorum qui acatalepsiam tenuerunt. Bacon alludes to the
members of the later academy, who held the ἀκατάληψια, or the
impossibility of comprehending anything. His translator, however, makes
him refer to the sceptics, who neither dogmatized about the known or the
unknown, but simply held, that as all knowledge was relative, πρòς πάντα
τι, man could never arrive at absolute truth, and therefore could not
with certainty affirm or deny anything. — Ed.</p>
<p>9 It is argued by Hallam, with some appearance of truth, that idols
is not the correct translation of εἴδωλα, from which the original idola
is manifestly derived; but that Bacon used it in the literal sense
attached to it by the Greeks, as a species of illusion, or false
appearance, and not as a species of divinity before which the mind bows
down. If Hallam be right, Bacon is saved from the odium of an analogy
which his foreign commentators are not far wrong in denouncing as
barbarous; but this service is rendered at the expense of the men who
have attached an opposite meaning to the word, among whom are Brown,
Playfair and Dugald Stewart. — Ed.</p>
<p>10 We cannot see how these idols have less to do with sophistical
paralogisms than with natural philosophy. The process of scientific
induction involves only the first elements of reasoning, and presents
such a clear and tangible surface, as to allow no lurking-place for
prejudice; while questions of politics and morals, to which the
deductive method, or common logic, as Bacon calls it, is peculiarly
applicable, are ever liable to be swayed or perverted by the prejudices
he enumerates. After mathematics, physical science is the least amenable
to the illusions of feeling; each portion having been already tested by
experiment and observation, is fitted into its place in the system, with
all the rigor of the geometrical method; affection or prejudice cannot,
as in matters of taste, history or religion, select fragmentary pieces,
and form a system of their own. The whole must be admitted, or the
structure of authoritative reason razed to the ground. It is needless to
say that the idols enumerated present only another interpretation of the
substance of logical fallacies. — Ed.</p>
<p>11 The propensity to this illusion may be viewed in the spirit of
system, or hasty generalization, which is still one of the chief
obstacles in the path of modern science. — Ed.</p>
<p>12 Though Kepler had, when Bacon wrote this, already demonstrated his
three great laws concerning the elliptical path of the planets, neither
Bacon nor Descartes seems to have known or assented to his discoveries.
Our author deemed the startling astronomical announcements of his time
to be mere theoretic solutions of the phenomena of the heavens, not so
perfect as those advanced by antiquity, but still deserving a praise for
the ingenuity displayed in their contrivance. Bacon believed a hundred
such systems might exist, and though true in their explanation of
phenomena, yet might all more or less differ, according to the
preconceived notions which their framers brought to the survey of the
heavens. He even thought he might put in his claim to the notice of
posterity for his astronomical ingenuity, and, as Ptolemy had labored by
means of epicycles and eccentrics, and Kepler with ellipses, to explain
the laws of planetary motion, Bacon thought the mystery would unfold
itself quite as philosophically through spiral labyrinths and serpentine
lines. What the details of his system were, we are left to conjecture,
and that from a very meagre but naïve account of one of his inventions
which he has left in his Miscellany MSS. — Ed.</p>
<p>13 Hinc elementum ignis cum orbe suo introductum est. Bacon saw in
fire the mere result of a certain combination of action, and was
consequently led to deny its elementary character. The ancient
physicists attributed an orbit to each of the four elements, into which
they resolved the universe, and supposed their spheres to involve each
other. The orbit of the earth was in the centre, that of fire at the
circumference. For Bacon’s inquisition into the nature of heat, and its
complete failure, see the commencement of the second book of the Novum
Organum. — Ed.</p>
<p>14 Robert Fludd is the theorist alluded to, who had supposed the
gravity of the earth to be ten times heavier than water, that of water
ten times heavier than air, and that of air ten times heavier than fire.
— Ed.</p>
<p>15 Diagoras. The same allusion occurs in the second part of the
Advancement of Learning, where Bacon treats of the idols of the
mind.</p>
<p>16 A scholastic term, to signify the two eternities of past and
future duration, that stretch out on both sides of the narrow isthmus
(time) occupied by man. It must be remembered that Bacon lived before
the doctrine of limits gave rise to the higher calculus, and therefore
could have no conception of different denominations of infinities: on
the other hand he would have thought the man insane who should have
talked to him about lines infinitely great, inclosing angles infinitely
little; that a right line, which is a right line so long as it is
finite, by changing infinitely little its direction, becomes an infinite
curve, and that a curve may become infinitely less than another curve;
that there are infinite squares and infinite cubes, and infinites of
infinites, all greater than one another, and the last but one of which
is nothing in comparison with the last. Yet half a century sufficed from
Bacon’s time, to make this nomenclature, which would have appeared to
him the excess of frenzy, not only reasonable but necessary, to grasp
the higher demonstrations of physical science. — Ed.</p>
<p>17 Spinoza, in his letter to Oldenberg (Op. Posth. p. 398), considers
this aphorism based on a wrong conception of the origin of error, and,
believing it to be fundamental, was led to reject Bacon’s method
altogether. Spinoza refused to acknowledge in man any such thing as a
will, and resolved all his volitions into particular acts, which he
considered to be as fatally determined by a chain of physical causes as
any effects in nature. — Ed.</p>
<p>18 Operatio spirituum in corporibus tangibilibus. Bacon distinguished
with the schools the gross and tangible parts of bodies, from such as
were volatile and intangible. These, in conformity with the scholastic
language, he terms spirits, and frequently returns to their operations
in the 2d book. — Ed.</p>
<p>19 Democritus, of Abdera, a disciple of Leucippus, born B.C. 470,
died 360; all his works are destroyed. He is said to be the author of
the doctrine of atoms: he denied the immortality of the soul, and first
taught that the milky way was occasioned by a confused light from a
multitude of stars. He may be considered as the parent of experimental
philosophy, in the prosecution of which he was so ardent as to declare
that he would prefer the discovery of one of the causes of natural
phenomena, to the possession of the diadem of Persia. Democritus imposed
on the blind credulity of his contemporaries, and, like Roger Bacon,
astonished them by his inventions. — Ed.</p>
<p>20 The Latin is actus purus, another scholastic expression to denote
the action of the substance, which composes the essence of the body
apart from its accidental qualities. For an exposition of the various
kinds of motions he contemplates, the reader may refer to the 48th
aphorism of the 2d book. — Ed.</p>
<p>21 The scholastics after Aristotle distinguished in a subject three
modes of beings: viz., the power or faculty, the act, and the habitude,
or in other words that which is able to exist, what exists actually, and
what continues to exist. Bacon means that is necessary to fix our
attention not on that which can or ought to be, but on that which
actually is; not on the right, but on the fact. — Ed.</p>
<p>22 The inference to be drawn from this is to suspect that kind of
evidence which is most consonant to our inclinations, and not to admit
any notion as real except we can base it firmly upon that kind of
demonstration which is peculiar to the subject, not to our impression.
Sometimes the mode of proof may be consonant to our inclinations, and to
the subject at the same time, as in the case of Pythagoras, when he
applied his beloved numbers to the solution of astronomical phenomena;
or in that of Descartes, when he reasoned geometrically concerning the
nature of the soul. Such examples cannot be censured with justice,
inasmuch as the methods pursued were adapted to the end of the inquiry.
The remark in the text can only apply to those philosophers who attempt
to build up a moral or theological system by the instruments of
induction alone, or who rush, with the geometrical axiom, and the à
priori syllogism, to the investigation of nature. The means in such
cases are totally inadequate to the object in view. — Ed.</p>
<p>23 Gilbert lived toward the close of the sixteenth century, and was
court physician to both Elizabeth and James. In his work alluded to in
the text he continually asserts the advantages of the experimental over
the à priori method in physical inquiry, and succeeded when his censor
failed in giving a practical example of the utility of his precepts. His
“De Magnete” contains all the fundamental parts of the science, and
these so perfectly treated, that we have nothing to add to them at the
present day.</p>
<p>Gilbert adopted the Copernican system, and even spoke of the contrary
theory as utterly absurd, grounding his argument on the vast velocities
which such a supposition requires us to ascribe to the heavenly bodies.
— Ed.</p>
<p>24 The Latin text adds “without end”; but Bacon is scarcely right in
supposing that the descent from complex ideas and propositions to those
of simple nature, involve the analyst in a series of continuous and
interminable definitions. For in the gradual and analytical scale, there
is a bar beyond which we cannot go, as there is a summit bounded by the
limited variations of our conceptions. Logical definitions, to fulfil
their conditions, or indeed to be of any avail, must be given in simpler
terms than the object which is sought to be defined; now this, in the
case of primordial notions and objects of sense, is impossible;
therefore we are obliged to rest satisfied with the mere names of our
perceptions. — Ed.</p>
<p>25 The ancients supposed the planets to describe an exact circle
round the south. As observations increased and facts were disclosed,
which were irreconcilable with this supposition, the earth was removed
from the centre to some other point in the circle, and the planets were
supposed to revolve in a smaller circle (epicycle) round an imaginary
point, which in its turn described a circle of which the earth was the
centre. In proportion as observation elicited fresh facts, contradictory
to these representations, other epicycles and eccentrics were added,
involving additional confusion. Though Kepler had swept away all these
complicated theories in the preceding century, by the demonstration of
his three laws, which established the elliptical course of the planets,
Bacon regarded him and Copernicus in the same light as Ptolemy and
Xenophanes. — Ed.</p>
<p>26 Empedocles, of Agrigentum, flourished 444 B.C. He was the disciple
of Telanges the Pythagorean, and warmly adopted the doctrine of
transmigration. He resolved the universe into the four ordinary
elements, the principles of whose composition were life and happiness,
or concord and amity, but whose decomposition brought forth death and
evil, or discord and hatred. Heraclitus held matter to be indifferent to
any peculiar form, but as it became rarer or more dense, it took the
appearance of fire, air, earth and water. Fire, however, he believed to
be the elementary principle out of which the others were evolved. This
was also the belief of Lucretius. See book i. 783, etc.</p>
<p>27 It is thus the Vulcanists and Neptunians have framed their
opposite theories in geology. Phrenology is a modern instance of hasty
generalization. — Ed.</p>
<p>28 In Scripture everything which concerns the passing interests of
the body is called dead; the only living knowledge having regard to the
eternal interest of the soul. — Ed.</p>
<p>29 In mechanics and the general sciences, causes compound their
effects, or in other words, it is generally possible to deduce à priori
the consequence of introducing complex agencies into any experiment, by
allowing for the effect of each of the simple causes which enter into
their composition. In chemistry and physiology a contrary law holds; the
causes which they embody generally uniting to form distinct substances,
and to introduce unforeseen laws and combinations. The deductive method
here is consequently inapplicable, and we are forced back upon
experiment.</p>
<p>Bacon in the text is hardly consistent with himself, as he admits in
the second book the doctrine, to which modern discovery points, of the
reciprocal transmutation of the elements. What seemed poetic fiction in
the theories of Pythagoras and Seneca, assumes the appearance of
scientific fact in the hands of Baron Caynard. — Ed.</p>
<p>30 Galileo had recently adopted the notion that nature abhorred a
vacuum for an axiomatic principle, and it was not till Torricelli, his
disciple, had given practical proof of the utility of Bacon’s method, by
the discovery of the barometer (1643) that this error, as also that
expressed below, and believed by Bacon, concerning the homœopathic
tendencies of bodies, was destroyed. — Ed.</p>
<p>31 Donec ad materiam potentialem et informem ventum fuerit. Nearly
all the ancient philosophers admitted the existence of a certain
primitive and shapeless matter as the substratum of things which the
creative power had reduced to fixed proportions, and resolved into
specific substances. The expression potential matter refers to that
substance forming the basis of the Peripatetic system, which virtually
contained all the forms that it was in the power of the efficient cause
to draw out of it. — Ed.</p>
<p>32 An allusion to the humanity of the Sultans, who, in their earlier
histories are represented as signalizing their accession to the throne
by the destruction of their family, to remove the danger of rivalry and
the terrors of civil war. — Ed.</p>
<p>33 The text is “in odium veterum sophistarum, Protagoræ, Hippiæ, et
reliquorum.” Those were called sophists, who, ostentationis aut questus
causa philosophabantur. (Acad. Prior. ii. 72.) They had corrupted and
degraded philosophy before Socrates. Protagoras of Abdera (Ἄβδηρα), the
most celebrated, taught that man is the measure of all things, by which
he meant not only that all which can be known is known only as it
related to our faculties, but also that apart from our faculties nothing
can be known. The sceptics equally held that knowledge was probable only
as it related to our faculties, but they stopped there, and did not,
like the sophist, dogmatize about the unknown. The works of Protagoras
were condemned for their impiety, and publicly burned by the ædiles of
Athens, who appear to have discharged the office of common hangmen to
the literary blasphemers of their day. — Ed.</p>
<p>34 Bacon is hardly correct in implying that the enumerationem per
simplicem was the only light in which the ancients looked upon
induction, as they appear to have regarded it as only one, and that the
least important, of its species. Aristotle expressly considers induction
in a perfect or dialectic sense, and in an imperfect or rhetorical
sense. Thus if a genus (G), contains four species (A, B, C, D), the
syllogism would lead us to infer, that what is true of G, is true of any
one of the four. But perfect induction would reason, that what we can
prove of A, B, C, D, separately, we may properly state as true of G, the
whole genus. This is evidently a formal argument as demonstrative as the
syllogism. In necessary matters, however, legitimate induction may claim
a wider province, and infer of the whole genus what is only apparent in
a part of the species. Such are those inductive inferences which concern
the laws of nature, the immutability of forms, by which Bacon strove to
erect his new system of philosophy. The Stagyrite, however, looked upon
enumerationem per simplicem, without any regard to the nature of the
matter, or to the completeness of the species, with as much reprehensive
caution as Bacon, and guarded his readers against it as the source of
innumerable errors. — Ed.</p>
<p>35 See Ax. lxi. toward the end. This subject extends to Ax.
lxxviii.</p>
<p>36 Gorgias of Leontium went to Athens in 424 B.C. He and Polus were
disciples of Empedocles, whom we have already noticed (Aphorism 63),
where he sustained the three famous propositions, that nothing exists,
that nothing can be known, and that it is out of the power of man to
transmit or communicate intelligence. He is reckoned one of the earliest
writers on the art of rhetoric, and for that reason, Plato called his
elegant dialogue on that subject after his name.</p>
<p>37 Chrysippus, a stoic philosopher of Soli in Cilicia, Campestris,
born in 280, died in the 143d Olympiad, 208 B.C. He was equally
distinguished for natural abilities and industry, seldom suffering a day
to elapse without writing 500 lines. He wrote several hundred volumes,
of which three hundred were on logical subjects; but in all, borrowed
largely from others. He was very fond of the sorites in argument, which
is hence called by Persius the heap of Chrysippus. He was called the
Column of the Portico, a name given to the Stoical School from Zeno, its
founder, who had given his lessons under the portico.</p>
<p>Carneades, born about 215, died in 130. He attached himself to
Chrysippus, and sustained with éclat the scepticism of the academy. The
Athenians sent him with Critolaus and Diogenes as ambassador to Rome,
where he attracted the attention of his new auditory by the subtilty of
his reasoning, and the fluency and vehemence of his language. Before
Galba and Cato the Censor, he harangued with great variety of thought
and copiousness of diction in praise of justice. The next day, to
establish his doctrine of the uncertainty of human knowledge, he
undertook to refute all his arguments. He maintained with the New
Academy, that the senses, the imagination, and the understanding
frequently deceive us, and therefore cannot be infallible judges of
truth, but that from the impressions produced on the mind by means of
the senses, we infer appearances of truth or probabilities.
Nevertheless, with respect to the conduct of life, Carneades held that
probable opinions are a sufficient guide.</p>
<p>Xenophanes, a Greek philosopher, of Colophon, born in 556, the
founder of the Eleatic school, which owes its fame principally to
Parmenides. Wild in his opinions about astronomy, he supposed that the
stars were extinguished every morning, and rekindled at night; that
eclipses were occasioned by the temporary extinction of the sun, and
that there were several suns for the convenience of the different
climates of the earth. Yet this man held the chair of philosophy at
Athens for seventy years.</p>
<p>Philolaus, a Pythagorean philosopher of Crotona, B.C. 374. He first
supported the diurnal motion of the earth round its axis, and its annual
motion round the sun. Cicero (Acad. iv. 39) has ascribed this opinion to
the Syracusan philosopher Nicetas, and likewise to Plato. From this
passage, it is most probable that Copernicus got the idea of the system
he afterward established. Bacon, in the Advancement of Human Learning,
charges Gilbert with restoring the doctrines of Philolaus, because he
ventured to support the Copernican theory. — Ed.</p>
<p>38 Bacon is equally conspicuous for the use and abuse of analogical
illustrations. The levity, as Stuart Mill very properly observes, by
which substances float on a stream, and the levity which is synonymous
with worthlessness, have nothing beside the name in common; and to show
how little value there is in the figure, we need only change the word
into buoyancy, to turn the semblance of Bacon’s argument against
himself. — Ed.</p>
<p>39 We have before observed, that the New Academy did not profess
skepticism, but the ἀκατάληψια, or incomprehensibility of the absolute
essences of things. Even modern physicists are not wanting, to assert
with this school that the utmost knowledge we can obtain is relative,
and necessarily short of absolute certainty. It is not without an
appearance of truth that these philosophers maintain that our ideas and
perceptions do not express the nature of the things which they
represent, but only the effects of the peculiar organs by which they are
conveyed to the understanding, so that were these organs changed, we
should have different conceptions of their nature. That constitution of
air which is dark to man is luminous to bats and owls.</p>
<p>40 Owing to the universal prevalence of Aristotelism.</p>
<p>41 It must be remembered, that when Bacon wrote, algebra was in its
infancy, and the doctrine of units and infinitesimals undiscovered.</p>
<p>42 Because the vulgar make up the overwhelming majority in such
decisions, and generally allow their judgments to be swayed by passion
or prejudice.</p>
<p>43 See end of Axiom lxi. The subject extends to Axiom xc.</p>
<p>44 If we adopt the statement of Herodotus, who places the Homeric era
400 years back from his time, Homer lived about 900 years before Christ.
On adding this number to the sixteen centuries of the Christian era
which had elapsed up to Bacon’s time, we get the twenty-five centuries
he mentions. The Homeric epoch is the furthest point in antiquity from
which Bacon could reckon with any degree of certainty. Hesiod, if he
were not contemporary, immediately preceded him.</p>
<p>The epoch of Greek philosophy may be included between Thales and
Plato, that is, from the 35th to the 88th Olympiad; that of the Roman,
between Terence and Pliny. The modern revolution, in which Bacon is one
of the central figures, took its rise from the time of Dante and
Petrarch, who lived at the commencement of the fourteenth century; and
to which, on account of the invention of printing, and the universal
spread of literature, which has rendered a second destruction of
learning impossible, it is difficult to foresee any other end than the
extinction of the race of man. — Ed.</p>
<p>45 The allusion is evidently to Roger Bacon and Réné Descartes. —
Ed.</p>
<p>46 From the abuse of the scholastics, who mistook the à priori
method, the deductive syllogism, for the entire province of logic. —
Ed.</p>
<p>47 See Aphorism xcv.</p>
<p>48 The incongruity to which Bacon alludes appears to spring from
confounding two things, which are not only distinct, but affect human
knowledge in inverse proportion, viz., the experience which terminates
with life, with that experience which one century transmits to another.

<p>51 The methods by which Newton carried the rule and compass to the
boundaries of creation is a sufficient comment on the sagacity of the
text. The same cause which globulizes a bubble, has rounded the earth,
and the same law which draws a stone to its surface, keeps the moon in
her orbit. It was by calculating and ascertaining these principles upon
substances entirely at his disposal that this great philosopher was
enabled to give us a key to unlock the mysteries of the universe. —
Ed.</p>
<p>52 See the “Clouds” of Aristophanes, where Socrates is represented as
chasing Jupiter out of the sky, by resolving thunderstorms into aërial
concussions and whirlwinds. — Ed.</p>
<p>53 Robespierre was the latest victim of this bigotry. In his younger
days he attempted to introduce Franklin’s lightning conductor into
France, but was persecuted by those whose lives he sought to protect, as
one audaciously striving to avert the designs of Providence. — Ed.</p>
<p>54 We can hardly agree with the text. The scholastics, in building up
a system of divinity, certainly had recourse to the deductive syllogism,
because the inductive was totally inapplicable, except as a verificatory
process. With regard to the technical form in which they marshalled
their arguments, which is what our author aims at in his censure, they
owed nothing at all to Aristotle, the conducting a dispute in naked
syllogistic fashion having originated entirely with themselves. —
Ed.</p>
<p>55 Bacon cannot be supposed to allude to those divines who have
attempted to show that the progress of physical science is confirmatory
of revelation, but only to such as have built up a system of faith out
of their own refinements on nature and revelation, as Patricius and
Emanuel Swedenborg. — Ed.</p>
<p>56 Daniel xii. 4.</p>
<p>57 Bacon, in this Aphorism, appears to have entertained a fair idea
of the use of the inductive and deductive methods in scientific inquiry,
though his want of geometrical knowledge must have hindered him from
accurately determining the precise functions of each, as it certainly
led him in other parts of the Organon (V. Aph. 82), to undervalue the
deductive, and, as he calls it, the dogmatic method, and to rely too
much upon empiricism. — Ed.</p>
<p>58 The reader may consult the note of the 23d Aphorism for the fault
which Bacon censures, and, if he wish to pursue the subject further, may
read Plato’s Timæus, where that philosopher explains his system in
detail. Bacon, however, is hardly consistent in one part of his censure,
for he also talks about the spirit and appetites of inanimate
substances, and that so frequently, as to preclude the supposition that
he is employing metaphor. — Ed.</p>
<p>59 Proclus flourished about the beginning of the fifth century, and
was the successor of Plotinus, Porphyry and Iamblicus, who, in the two
preceding centuries, had revived the doctrines of Plato, and assailed
the Christian religion. The allusion in the text must be assigned to
Iamblicus, who, in the fourth century, had republished the Pythagorean
theology of numbers, and endeavored to construct the world out of
arithmetic, thinking everything could be solved by the aid of
proportions and geometry. Bacon must not be understood in the text to
censure the use but the abuse of mathematics and physical
investigations, as in the “De Augmentis” (lib. iv. c. 6), he enumerates
the multiplicity of demonstration scientific facts admit of, from this
source. — Ed.</p>
<p>60 See Livy, lib. ix. c. 17, where, in a digression on the probable
effect of a contest between Rome and Alexander the Great, he says: “Non
cum Dario rem esse dixisset: quem mulierum ac spadonum agmen trahentem
inter purpuram atque aurum, oneratum fortunæ apparatibus, prædam veriùs
quam hostem, nihil aliud quam ausus vana contemnere, incruentus
devicit.”</p>
<p>61 The lowest axioms are such as spring from simple experience — such
as in chemistry, that animal substances yield no fixed salt by
calcination; in music, that concords intermixed with discords make
harmony, etc. Intermediate axioms advance a step further, being the
result of reflection, which, applied to our experimental knowledge,
deduces laws from them, such as in optics of the first degree of
generality, that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection; and in mechanics, Kepler’s three laws of motion, while his
general law, that all bodies attract each other with forces proportional
to their masses, and inversely as the squares of their distances, may be
taken as one of the highest axioms. Yet so far is this principle from
being only notional or abstract, it has presented us with a key which
fits into the intricate wards of the heavens, and has laid bare to our
gaze the principal mechanism of the universe. But natural philosophy in
Bacon’s day had not advanced beyond intermediate axioms, and the term
notional or abstract is applied to those general axioms then current,
not founded on the solid principles of inductive inquiry, but based upon
à priori reasoning and airy metaphysics. — Ed.</p>
<p>62 This hope has been abundantly realized in the discovery of gravity
and the decomposition of light, mainly by the inductive method. To a
better philosophy we may also attribute the discovery of electricity,
galvanism and their mutual connection with each other, and magnetism,
the inventions of the air-pump, steam-engine and the chronometer.</p>
<p>63 As Bacon very frequently cites these authors, a slight notice of
their labors may not be unacceptable to the reader. Bernardinus
Telesius, born at Cosenza, in 1508, combated the Aristotelian system in
a work entitled “De Rerum Natura juxta propria principia,” i.e.,
according to principles of his own. The proem of the work announces his
design was to show that “the construction of the world, the magnitude
and nature of the bodies contained in it, are not to be investigated by
reasoning, which was done by the ancients, but are to be apprehended by
the senses, and collected from the things themselves.” He had, however,
no sooner laid down this principle than he departed from it in practice,
and pursued the deductive method he so much condemned in his
predecessors. His first step was an assumption of principles as
arbitrary as any of the empirical notions of antiquity; at the outset of
his book he very quietly takes it for granted that heat is the principle
of motion, cold of immobility, matter being assumed as the corporeal
substratum, in which these incorporeal and active agents carry on their
operations. Out of these abstract and ill-defined conceptions Telesius
builds up a system quite as complete, symmetrical, and imaginative as
any of the structures of antiquity.</p>
<p>Francis Patricius, born at Cherso, in Dalmatia, about 1529, was
another physicist who rose up against Aristotle, and announced the dawn
of a new philosophy. In 1593 appeared his “Nova de Universis
Philosophia.” He lays down a string of axioms, in which scholastic
notions, physical discoveries, and theological dogmas, are strangely
commingled, and erects upon them a system which represents all the
grotesque features of theological empiricism.</p>
<p>Severinus, born in Jutland, in 1529, published an attack on
Aristotle’s natural history, but adopted fantasies which the Stagyrite
ridiculed in his own day. He was a follower of Paracelsus, a Swiss
enthusiast of the fifteenth century, who ignored the ancient doctrine of
the four elements for salt, sulphur and mercury, and allied chemistry
and medicine with mysticism. — Ed.</p>
<p>64 Bacon’s apology is sound, and completely answers those German and
French critics, who have refused him a niche in the philosophical
pantheon. One German commentator, too modest to reveal his name, accuses
Bacon of ignorance of the calculus, though, in his day, Wallis had not
yet stumbled upon the laws of continuous fractions; while Count de
Maistre, in a coarse attack upon his genius, expresses his astonishment
at finding Bacon unacquainted with discoveries which were not heard of
till a century after his death. — Ed.</p>

<p>66 See Plato’s Timæus.</p>
<p>67 The saying of Philocrates when he differed from Demosthenes. —
Ed.</p>
<p>68 The old error of placing the deductive syllogism in antagonism to
the inductive, as if they were not both parts of one system or refused
to cohere together. So far from there being any radical opposition
between them, it would not be difficult to show that Bacon’s method was
syllogistic in his sense of the term. For the suppressed premise of
every Baconian enthymeme, viz., the acknowledged uniformity of the laws
of nature as stated in the axiom, whatever has once occurred will occur
again, must be assumed as the basis of every conclusion which he draws
before we can admit its legitimacy. The opposition, therefore, of
Bacon’s method could not be directed against the old logic, for it
assumed and exemplified its principles, but rather to the abusive
application which the ancients made of this science, on turning its
powers to the development of abstract principles which they imagined to
be pregnant with the solution of the latent mysteries of the universe.
Bacon justly overthrew these ideal notions, and accepted of no principle
as a basis which was not guaranteed by actual experiment and
observation; and so far he laid the foundations of a sound philosophy by
turning the inductive logic to its proper account in the interpretation
of nature.</p>
<p>69 This is the opening of the Sixth Book of Lucretius. Bacon probably
quoted from memory; the lines are —</p>
<p>“Primæ frugiferos fœtus mortalibus ægris Dididerunt quondam præclaro
nomine Athenæ Et recreaverunt,” etc.</p>
<p>The teeming corn, that feeble mortals crave, First, and long since,
renowned Athens gave, And cheered their life — then taught to frame
their laws.</p>

<p>APHORISMS — BOOK II. ON THE INTERPRETATION OF NATURE, OR THE REIGN OF
MAN</p>
<p>I. To generate and superinduce a new nature or new natures, upon a
given body, is the labor and aim of human power: while to discover the
form or true difference of a given nature, or the nature71 to which such
nature is owing, or source from which it emanates (for these terms
approach nearest to an explanation of our meaning), is the labor and
discovery of human knowledge; and subordinate to these primary labors
are two others of a secondary nature and inferior stamp. Under the first
must be ranked the transformation of concrete bodies from one to
another, which is possible within certain limits; under the second, the
discovery, in every species of generation and motion, of the latent and
uninterrupted process from the manifest efficient and manifest subject
matter up to the given form: and a like discovery of the latent
conformation of bodies which are at rest instead of being in motion.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li><p>The unhappy state of man’s actual knowledge is manifested even by
the common assertions of the vulgar. It is rightly laid down that true
knowledge is that which is deduced from causes. The division of four
causes also is not amiss: matter, form, the efficient, and end or final
cause.72 Of these, however, the latter is so far from being beneficial,
that it even corrupts the sciences, except in the intercourse of man
with man. The discovery of form is considered desperate. As for the
efficient cause and matter (according to the present system of inquiry
and the received opinions concerning them, by which they are placed
remote from, and without any latent process toward form), they are but
desultory and superficial, and of scarcely any avail to real and active
knowledge. Nor are we unmindful of our having pointed out and corrected
above the error of the human mind, in assigning the first qualities of
essence to forms.73 For although nothing exists in nature except
individual bodies,74 exhibiting clear individual effects according to
particular laws, yet in each branch of learning, that very law, its
investigation, discovery, and development, are the foundation both of
theory and practice. This law, therefore, and its parallel in each
science, is what we understand by the term form,75 adopting that word
because it has grown into common use, and is of familiar
occurrence.</p></li>
<li><p>He who has learned the cause of a particular nature (such as
whiteness or heat), in particular subjects only, has acquired but an
imperfect knowledge: as he who can induce a certain effect upon
particular substances only, among those which are susceptible of it, has
acquired but an imperfect power. But he who has only learned the
efficient and material cause (which causes are variable and mere
vehicles conveying form to particular substances) may perhaps arrive at
some new discoveries in matters of a similar nature, and prepared for
the purpose, but does not stir the limits of things which are much more
deeply rooted; while he who is acquainted with forms, comprehends the
unity of nature in substances apparently most distinct from each other.
He can disclose and bring forward, therefore (though it has never yet
been done), things which neither the vicissitudes of nature, nor the
industry of experiment, nor chance itself, would ever have brought
about, and which would forever have escaped man’s thoughts; from the
discovery of forms, therefore, results genuine theory and free
practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Although there is a most intimate connection, and almost an
identity between the ways of human power and human knowledge, yet, on
account of the pernicious and inveterate habit of dwelling upon
abstractions, it is by far the safest method to commence and build up
the sciences from those foundations which bear a relation to the
practical division, and to let them mark out and limit the theoretical.
We must consider, therefore, what precepts, or what direction or guide,
a person would most desire, in order to generate and superinduce any
nature upon a given body: and this not in abstruse, but in the plainest
language.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, if a person should wish to superinduce the yellow color
of gold upon silver, or an additional weight (observing always the laws
of matter) or transparency on an opaque stone, or tenacity in glass, or
vegetation on a substance which is not vegetable, we must (I say)
consider what species of precept or guide this person would prefer. And,
first, he will doubtless be anxious to be shown some method that will
neither fail in effect, nor deceive him in the trial of it; secondly, he
will be anxious that the prescribed method should not restrict him and
tie him down to peculiar means, and certain particular methods of
acting; for he will, perhaps, be at loss, and without the power or
opportunity of collecting and procuring such means. Now if there be
other means and methods (besides those prescribed) of creating such a
nature, they will perhaps be of such a kind as are in his power, yet by
the confined limits of the precept he will be deprived of reaping any
advantage from them; thirdly, he will be anxious to be shown something
not so difficult as the required effect itself, but approaching more
nearly to practice.</p>
<p>We will lay this down, therefore, as the genuine and perfect rule of
practice, that it should be certain, free and preparatory, or having
relation to practice. And this is the same thing as the discovery of a
true form; for the form of any nature is such, that when it is assigned
the particular nature infallibly follows. It is, therefore, always
present when that nature is present, and universally attests such
presence, and is inherent in the whole of it. The same form is of such a
character, that if it be removed the particular nature infallibly
vanishes. It is, therefore, absent, whenever that nature is absent, and
perpetually testifies such absence, and exists in no other nature.
Lastly, the true form is such, that it deduces the particular nature
from some source of essence existing in many subjects, and more known
(as they term it) to nature, than the form itself. Such, then, is our
determination and rule with regard to a genuine and perfect theoretical
axiom, that a nature be found convertible with a given nature, and yet
such as to limit the more known nature, in the manner of a real genus.
But these two rules, the practical and theoretical, are in fact the
same, and that which is most useful in practice is most correct in
theory.</p>
<p>V. But the rule or axiom for the transformation of bodies is of two
kinds. The first regards the body as an aggregate or combination of
simple natures. Thus, in gold are united the following circumstances: it
is yellow, heavy, of a certain weight, malleable and ductile to a
certain extent; it is not volatile, loses part of its substance by fire,
melts in a particular manner, is separated and dissolved by particular
methods, and so of the other natures observable in gold. An axiom,
therefore, of this kind deduces the subject from the forms of simple
natures; for he who has acquired the forms and methods of superinducing
yellowness, weight, ductility, stability, deliquescence, solution, and
the like, and their degrees and modes, will consider and contrive how to
unite them in any body, so as to transform76 it into gold. And this
method of operating belongs to primary action; for it is the same thing
to produce one or many simple natures, except that man is more confined
and restricted in his operations, if many be required, on account of the
difficulty of uniting many natures together. It must, however, be
observed, that this method of operating (which considers natures as
simple though in a concrete body) sets out from what is constant,
eternal, and universal in nature, and opens such broad paths to human
power, as the thoughts of man can in the present state of things
scarcely comprehend or figure to itself.</p>
<p>The second kind of axiom (which depends on the discovery of the
latent process) does not proceed by simple natures, but by concrete
bodies, as they are found in nature and in its usual course. For
instance, suppose the inquiry to be, from what beginnings, in what
manner, and by what process gold or any metal or stone is generated from
the original menstruum, or its elements, up to the perfect mineral: or,
in like manner, by what process plants are generated, from the first
concretion of juices in the earth, or from seeds, up to the perfect
plant, with the whole successive motion, and varied and uninterrupted
efforts of nature; and the same inquiry be made as to a regularly
deduced system of the generation of animals from coition to birth, and
so on of other bodies.</p>
<p>Nor is this species of inquiry confined to the mere generation of
bodies, but it is applicable to other changes and labors of nature. For
instance, where an inquiry is made into the whole series and continued
operation of the nutritive process, from the first reception of the food
to its complete assimilation to the recipient;77 or into the voluntary
motion of animals, from the first impression of the imagination, and the
continuous effects of the spirits, up to the bending and motion of the
joints; or into the free motion of the tongue and lips, and other
accessories which give utterance to articulate sounds. For all these
investigations relate to concrete or associated natures artificially
brought together, and take into consideration certain particular and
special habits of nature, and not those fundamental and general laws
which constitute forms. It must, however, be plainly owned, that this
method appears more prompt and easy, and of greater promise than the
primary one.</p>
<p>In like manner the operative branch, which answers to this
contemplative branch, extends and advances its operation from that which
is usually observed in nature, to other subjects immediately connected
with it, or not very remote from such immediate connection. But the
higher and radical operations upon nature depend entirely on the primary
axioms. Besides, even where man has not the means of acting, but only of
acquiring knowledge, as in astronomy (for man cannot act upon, change,
or transform the heavenly bodies), the investigation of facts or truth,
as well as the knowledge of causes and coincidences, must be referred to
those primary and universal axioms that regard simple natures; such as
the nature of spontaneous rotation, attraction, or the magnetic force,
and many others which are more common than the heavenly bodies
themselves. For let no one hope to determine the question whether the
earth or heaven revolve in the diurnal motion, unless he have first
comprehended the nature of spontaneous rotation.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>But the latent process of which we speak, is far from being obvious
to men’s minds, beset as they now are. For we mean not the measures,
symptoms, or degrees of any process which can be exhibited in the bodies
themselves, but simply a continued process, which, for the most part,
escapes the observation of the senses.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, in all generations and transformations of bodies, we
must inquire, what is in the act of being lost and escaping, what
remains, what is being added, what is being diluted, what is being
contracted, what is being united, what is being separated, what is
continuous, what is broken off, what is urging forward, what impedes,
what predominates, what is subservient, and many other
circumstances.</p>
<p>Nor are these inquiries again to be made in the mere generation and
transformation of bodies only, but in all other alterations and
fluctuations we must in like manner inquire; what precedes, what
succeeds, what is quick, what is slow, what produces and what governs
motion, and the like. All which matters are unknown and unattempted by
the sciences, in their present heavy and inactive state. For, since
every natural act is brought about by the smallest efforts,78 or at
least such as are too small to strike our senses, let no one hope that
he will be able to direct or change nature unless he have properly
comprehended and observed these efforts.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>In like manner, the investigation and discovery of the latent
conformation in bodies is no less new, than the discovery of the latent
process and form. For we as yet are doubtless only admitted to the
antechamber of nature, and do not prepare an entrance into her
presence-room. But nobody can endue a given body with a new nature, or
transform it successfully and appropriately into a new body, without
possessing a complete knowledge of the body so to be changed or
transformed. For he will run into vain, or, at least, into difficult and
perverse methods, ill adapted to the nature of the body upon which he
operates. A clear path, therefore, toward this object also must be
thrown open, and well supported.</li>
</ol>
<p>Labor is well and usefully bestowed upon the anatomy of organized
bodies, such as those of men and animals, which appears to be a subtile
matter, and a useful examination of nature. The species of anatomy,
however, is that of first sight, open to the senses, and takes place
only in organized bodies. It is obvious, and of ready access, when
compared with the real anatomy of latent conformation in bodies which
are considered similar, particularly in specific objects and their
parts; as those of iron, stone, and the similar parts of plants and
animals, as the root, the leaf, the flower, the flesh, the blood, and
bones, etc. Yet human industry has not completely neglected this species
of anatomy; for we have an instance of it in the separation of similar
bodies by distillation, and other solutions, which shows the
dissimilarity of the compound by the union of the homogeneous parts.
These methods are useful, and of importance to our inquiry, although
attended generally with fallacy: for many natures are assigned and
attributed to the separate bodies, as if they had previously existed in
the compound, which, in reality, are recently bestowed and superinduced
by fire and heat, and the other modes of separation. Besides, it is,
after all, but a small part of the labor of discovering the real
conformation in the compound, which is so subtile and nice, that it is
rather confused and lost by the operation of the fire, than discovered
and brought to light.</p>
<p>A separation and solution of bodies, therefore, is to be effected,
not by fire indeed, but rather by reasoning and true induction, with the
assistance of experiment, and by a comparison with other bodies, and a
reduction to those simple natures and their forms which meet, and are
combined in the compound; and we must assuredly pass from Vulcan to
Minerva, if we wish to bring to light the real texture and conformation
of bodies, upon which every occult and (as it is sometimes called)
specific property and virtue of things depends, and whence also every
rule of powerful change and transformation is deduced.</p>
<p>For instance, we must examine what spirit is in every body,79 what
tangible essence; whether that spirit is copious and exuberant, or
meagre and scarce, fine or coarse, aëriform or igniform, active or
sluggish, weak or robust, progressive or retrograde, abrupt or
continuous, agreeing with external and surrounding objects, or differing
from them, etc. In like manner must we treat tangible essence (which
admits of as many distinctions as the spirit), and its hairs, fibres,
and varied texture. Again, the situation of the spirit in the corporeal
mass, its pores, passages, veins, and cells, and the rudiments or first
essays of the organic body, are subject to the same examination. In
these, however, as in our former inquiries, and therefore in the whole
investigation of latent conformation, the only genuine and clear light
which completely dispels all darkness and subtile difficulties, is
admitted by means of the primary axioms.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>This method will not bring us to atoms,80 which takes for granted
the vacuum, and immutability of matter (neither of which hypotheses is
correct), but to the real particles such as we discover them to be. Nor
is there any ground for alarm at this refinement as if it were
inexplicable, for, on the contrary, the more inquiry is directed to
simple natures, the more will everything be placed in a plain and
perspicuous light, since we transfer our attention from the complicated
to the simple, from the incommensurable to the commensurable, from surds
to rational quantities, from the indefinite and vague to the definite
and certain; as when we arrive at the elements of letters, and the
simple tones of concords. The investigation of nature is best conducted
when mathematics are applied to physics. Again, let none be alarmed at
vast numbers and fractions, for in calculation it is as easy to set down
or to reflect upon a thousand as a unit, or the thousandth part of an
integer as an integer itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>IX.81 From the two kinds of axioms above specified, arise the two
divisions of philosophy and the sciences, and we will use the commonly
adopted terms which approach the nearest to our meaning, in our own
sense. Let the investigation of forms, which (in reasoning at least, and
after their own laws), are eternal and immutable, constitute
metaphysics,82 and let the investigation of the efficient cause of
matter, latent process, and latent conformation (which all relate merely
to the ordinary course of nature, and not to her fundamental and eternal
laws), constitute physics. Parallel to these, let there be two practical
divisions; to physics that of mechanics, and to metaphysics that of
magic, in the purest sense of the term, as applied to its ample means,
and its command over nature.</p>
<p>X. The object of our philosophy being thus laid down, we proceed to
precepts, in the most clear and regular order. The signs for the
interpretation of nature comprehend two divisions; the first regards the
eliciting or creating of axioms from experiment, the second the deducing
or deriving of new experiments from axioms. The first admits of three
subdivisions into ministrations. 1. To the senses. 2. To the memory. 3.
To the mind or reason.</p>
<p>For we must first prepare as a foundation for the whole, a complete
and accurate natural and experimental history. We must not imagine or
invent, but discover the acts and properties of nature.</p>
<p>But natural and experimental history is so varied and diffuse, that
it confounds and distracts the understanding unless it be fixed and
exhibited in due order. We must, therefore, form tables and
co-ordinations of instances, upon such a plan, and in such order that
the understanding may be enabled to act upon them.</p>
<p>Even when this is done, the understanding, left to itself and to its
own operation, is incompetent and unfit to construct its axioms without
direction and support. Our third ministration, therefore, must be true
and legitimate induction, the very key of interpretation. We must begin,
however, at the end, and go back again to the others.</p>
<ol start="11" type="I">
<li>The investigation of forms proceeds thus: a nature being given, we
must first present to the understanding all the known instances which
agree in the same nature, although the subject matter be considerably
diversified. And this collection must be made as a mere history, and
without any premature reflection, or too great degree of refinement. For
instance; take the investigation of the form of heat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instances agreeing in the Form of Heat</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The rays of the sun, particularly in summer, and at
noon.</p></li>
<li><p>The same reflected and condensed, as between mountains, or along
walls, and particularly in burning mirrors.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignited meteors.</p></li>
<li><p>Burning lightning.</p></li>
<li><p>Eruptions of flames from the cavities of mountains, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Flame of every kind.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignited solids.</p></li>
<li><p>Natural warm baths.</p></li>
<li><p>Warm or heated liquids.</p></li>
<li><p>Warm vapors and smoke; and the air itself, which admits a most
powerful and violent heat if confined, as in reverberating
furnaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Damp hot weather, arising from the constitution of the air,
without any reference to the time of the year.</p></li>
<li><p>Confined and subterraneous air in some caverns, particularly in
winter.</p></li>
<li><p>All shaggy substances, as wool, the skins of animals, and the
plumage of birds, contain some heat.</p></li>
<li><p>All bodies, both solid and liquid, dense and rare (as the air
itself), placed near fire for any time.</p></li>
<li><p>Sparks arising from the violent percussion of flint and
steel.</p></li>
<li><p>All bodies rubbed violently, as stone, wood, cloth, etc., so that
rudders, and axles of wheels, sometimes catch fire, and the West Indians
obtain fire by attrition.</p></li>
<li><p>Green and moist vegetable matter confined and rubbed together, as
roses, peas in baskets; so hay, if it be damp when stacked, often
catches fire.</p></li>
<li><p>Quicklime sprinkled with water.</p></li>
<li><p>Iron, when first dissolved by acids in a glass, and without any
application to fire; the same of tin, but not so intensely.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals, particularly internally; although the heat is not
perceivable by the touch in insects, on account of their small
size.</p></li>
<li><p>Horse dung, and the like excrement from other animals, when
fresh.</p></li>
<li><p>Strong oil of sulphur and of vitriol exhibit the operation of
heat in burning linen.</p></li>
<li><p>As does the oil of marjoram, and like substances, in burning the
bony substance of the teeth.</p></li>
<li><p>Strong and well rectified spirits of wine exhibit the same
effects; so that white of eggs when thrown into it grows hard and white,
almost in the same manner as when boiled, and bread becomes burned and
brown as if toasted.</p></li>
<li><p>Aromatic substances and warm plants, as the dracunculus [arum],
old nasturtium, etc., which, though they be not warm to the touch
(whether whole or pulverized), yet are discovered by the tongue and
palate to be warm and almost burning when slightly masticated.</p></li>
<li><p>Strong vinegar and all acids, on any part of the body not clothed
with the epidermis, as the eye, tongue, or any wounded part, or where
the skin is removed, excite a pain differing but little from that
produced by heat.</p></li>
<li><p>Even a severe and intense cold produces a sensation of
burning.83</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Nec Boreæ penetrabile frigus adurit.”</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>Other instances.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are wont to call this a table of existence and presence.</p>
<ol start="12" type="I">
<li>We must next present to the understanding instances which do not
admit of the given nature, for form (as we have observed) ought no less
to be absent where the given nature is absent, than to be present where
it is present. If, however, we were to examine every instance, our labor
would be infinite.</li>
</ol>
<p>Negatives, therefore, must be classed under the affirmatives, and the
want of the given nature must be inquired into more particularly in
objects which have a very close connection with those others in which it
is present and manifest. And this we are wont to term a table of
deviation or of absence in proximity.</p>
<p>Proximate Instances wanting the Nature of Heat</p>
<p>The rays of the moon, stars, and comets, are not found to be warm to
the touch, nay, the severest cold has been observed to take place at the
full of the moon. Yet the larger fixed stars are supposed to increase
and render more intense the heat of the sun, as he approaches them, when
the sun is in the sign of the Lion, for instance, and in the
dog-days.84</p>
<p>The rays of the sun in what is called the middle region of the air
give no heat, to account for which the commonly assigned reason is
satisfactory; namely, that that region is neither sufficiently near to
the body of the sun whence the rays emanate, nor to the earth whence
they are reflected. And the fact is manifested by snow being perpetual
on the tops of mountains, unless extremely lofty. But it is observed, on
the other hand, by some, that at the Peak of Teneriffe, and also among
the Andes of Peru, the tops of the mountains are free from snow, which
only lies in the lower part as you ascend. Besides, the air on the
summit of these mountains is found to be by no means cold, but only thin
and sharp; so much so, that in the Andes it pricks and hurts the eyes
from its extreme sharpness, and even excites the orifice of the stomach
and produces vomiting. The ancients also observed, that the rarity of
the air on the summit of Olympus was such, that those who ascended it
were obliged to carry sponges moistened with vinegar and water, and to
apply them now and then to their nostrils, as the air was not dense
enough for their respiration; on the summit of which mountain it is also
related, there reigned so great a serenity and calm, free from rain,
snow, or wind, that the letters traced upon the ashes of the sacrifices
on the altar of Jupiter, by the fingers of those who had offered them,
would remain undisturbed till the next year. Those even, who at this day
go to the top of the Peak of Teneriffe, walk by night and not in the
daytime, and are advised and pressed by their guides, as soon as the sun
rises, to make haste in their descent, on account of the danger
(apparently arising from the rarity of the atmosphere), lest their
breathing should be relaxed and suffocated.85</p>
<p>The reflection of the solar rays in the polar regions is found to be
weak and inefficient in producing heat, so that the Dutch, who wintered
in Nova Zembla, and expected that their vessel would be freed about the
beginning of July from the obstruction of the mass of ice which had
blocked it up, were disappointed and obliged to embark in their boat.
Hence the direct rays of the sun appear to have but little power even on
the plain, and when reflected, unless they are multiplied and condensed,
which takes place when the sun tends more to the perpendicular; for,
then, the incidence of the rays occurs at more acute angles, so that the
reflected rays are nearer to each other, while, on the contrary, when
the sun is in a very oblique position, the angles of incidence are very
obtuse, and the reflected rays at a greater distance. In the meantime it
must be observed, that there may be many operations of the solar rays,
relating, too, to the nature of heat, which are not proportioned to our
touch, so that, with regard to us, they do not tend to produce warmth,
but, with regard to some other bodies, have their due effect in
producing it.</p>
<p>Let the following experiment be made. Take a lens the reverse of a
burning-glass, and place it between the hand and the solar rays, and
observe whether it diminish the heat of the sun as a burning-glass
increases it. For it is clear, with regard to the visual rays, that in
proportion as the lens is made of unequal thickness in the middle and at
its sides, the images appear either more diffused or contracted. It
should be seen, therefore, if the same be true with regard to heat.</p>
<p>Let the experiment be well tried, whether the lunar rays can be
received and collected by the strongest and best burning-glasses, so as
to produce even the least degree of heat.86 But if that degree be,
perhaps, so subtile and weak, as not to be perceived or ascertained by
the touch, we must have recourse to those glasses which indicate the
warm or cold state of the atmosphere, and let the lunar rays fall
through the burning-glass on the top of this thermometer, and then
notice if the water be depressed by the heat.87</p>
<p>Let the burning-glass be tried on warm objects which emit no luminous
rays, as heated but not ignited iron or stone, or hot water, or the
like; and observe whether the heat become increased and condensed, as
happens with the solar rays.</p>
<p>Let it be tried on common flame.</p>
<p>The effect of comets (if we can reckon them among meteors88) in
augmenting the heat of the season is not found to be constant or clear,
although droughts have generally been observed to follow them. However,
luminous lines, and pillars, and openings, and the like, appear more
often in winter than in summer, and especially with the most intense
cold but joined with drought. Lightning, and coruscations, and thunder,
however, rarely happen in winter; and generally at the time of the
greatest heats. The appearances we term falling stars are generally
supposed to consist of some shining and inflamed viscous substance,
rather than of violently hot matter; but let this be further
investigated.</p>
<p>Some coruscations emit light without burning, but are never
accompanied by thunder.</p>
<p>Eructations and eruptions of flame are to be found in cold climates
as well as in hot, as in Iceland and Greenland; just as the trees of
cold countries are sometimes inflammable and more pitchy and resinous
than in warm, as the fir, pine, and the like. But the position and
nature of the soil, where such eruptions are wont to happen, is not yet
sufficiently investigated to enable us to subjoin a negative instance to
the affirmative.</p>
<p>All flame is constantly more or less warm, and this instance is not
altogether negative; yet it is said that the ignis fatuus (as it is
called), and which sometimes is driven against walls, has but little
heat; perhaps it resembles that of spirits of wine, which is mild and
gentle. That flame, however, appears yet milder, which in some well
authenticated and serious histories is said to have appeared round the
head and hair of boys and virgins, and instead of burning their hair,
merely to have played about it. And it is most certain that a sort of
flash, without any evident heat, has sometimes been seen about a horse
when sweating at night, or in damp weather. It is also a well known
fact,89 and it was almost considered as a miracle, that a few years
since a girl’s apron sparkled when a little shaken or rubbed, which was,
perhaps, occasioned by the alum or salts with which the apron was
imbued, and which, after having been stuck together and incrusted rather
strongly, were broken by the friction. It is well known that all sugar,
whether candied or plain, if it be hard, will sparkle when broken or
scraped in the dark. In like manner sea and salt water is sometimes
found to shine at night when struck violently by the oar. The foam of
the sea when agitated by tempests also sparkles at night, and the
Spaniards call this appearance the sea’s lungs. It has not been
sufficiently ascertained what degree of heat attends the flame which the
ancient sailors called Castor and Pollux, and the moderns call
St. Ermus’ fire.</p>
<p>Every ignited body that is red-hot is always warm, although without
flame, nor is any negative instance subjoined to this affirmative.
Rotten wood, however, approaches nearly to it, for it shines at night,
and yet is not found to be warm; and the putrefying scales of fish which
shine in the same manner are not warm to the touch, nor the body of the
glowworm, or of the fly called Lucciola.90</p>
<p>The situation and nature of the soil of natural warm baths has not
been sufficiently investigated, and therefore a negative instance is not
subjoined.</p>
<p>To the instances of warm liquids we may subjoin the negative one of
the peculiar nature of liquids in general; for no tangible liquid is
known that is at once warm in its nature and constantly continues warm;
but their heat is only superinduced as an adventitious nature for a
limited time, so that those which are extremely warm in their power and
effect, as spirits of wine, chemical aromatic oils, the oils of vitriol
and sulphur, and the like, and which speedily burn, are yet cold at
first to the touch, and the water of natural baths, poured into any
vessel and separated from its source, cools down like water heated by
the fire. It is, however, true that oily substances are rather less cold
to the touch than those that are aqueous, oil for instance than water,
silk than linen; but this belongs to the table of degrees of cold.</p>
<p>In like manner we may subjoin a negative instance to that of warm
vapor, derived from the nature of vapor itself, as far as we are
acquainted with it. For exhalations from oily substances, though easily
inflammable, are yet never warm unless recently exhaled from some warm
substance.</p>
<p>The same may be said of the instance of air; for we never perceive
that air is warm unless confined or pressed, or manifestly heated by the
sun, by fire, or some other warm body.</p>
<p>A negative instance is exhibited in weather by its coldness with an
east or north wind, beyond what the season would lead us to expect, just
as the contrary takes place with the south or west winds. An inclination
to rain (especially in winter) attends warm weather, and to frost cold
weather.</p>
<p>A negative instance as to air confined in caverns may be observed in
summer. Indeed, we should make a more diligent inquiry into the nature
of confined air. For in the first place the qualities of air in its own
nature with regard to heat and cold may reasonably be the subject of
doubt; for air evidently derives its heat from the effects of celestial
bodies, and possibly its cold from the exhalation of the earth, and in
the mid region of air (as it is termed) from cold vapors and snow, so
that no judgment can be formed of the nature of air by that which is out
of doors and exposed, but a more correct one might be derived from
confined air. It is necessary, however, that the air should be inclosed
in a vessel of such materials as would not imbue it with heat or cold of
themselves, nor easily admit the influence of the external atmosphere.
The experiment should be made, therefore, with an earthen jar, covered
with folds of leather to protect it from the external air, and the air
should be kept three or four days in this vessel well closed. On opening
the jar, the degree of heat may be ascertained either by the hand or a
graduated glass tube.</p>
<p>There is a similar doubt as to whether the warmth of wool, skins,
feathers, and the like, is derived from a slight inherent heat, since
they are animal excretions, or from their being of a certain fat and
oily nature that accords with heat, or merely from the confinement and
separation of air which we spoke of in the preceding paragraph;91 for
all air appears to possess a certain degree of warmth when separated
from the external atmosphere. Let an experiment be made, therefore, with
fibrous substances of linen, and not of wool, feathers, or silk, which
are animal excretions. For it is to be observed that all powders (where
air is manifestly inclosed) are less cold than the substances when
whole, just as we imagine froth (which contains air) to be less cold
than the liquid itself.</p>
<p>We have here no exactly negative instance, for we are not acquainted
with any body tangible or spirituous which does not admit of heat when
exposed to the fire. There is, however, this difference, that some admit
it more rapidly, as air, oil, and water, others more slowly, as stone
and metals.92 This, however, belongs to the table of degrees.</p>
<p>No negative is here subjoined, except the remark that sparks are not
kindled by flint and steel, or any other hard substance, unless some
small particles of the stone or metal are struck off, and that the air
never forms them by friction, as is commonly supposed; besides, the
sparks from the weight of the ignited substance have a tendency to
descend rather than to rise, and when extinguished become a sort of dark
ash.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that here again there is no negative; for we are
not acquainted with any tangible body which does not become decidedly
warm by friction, so that the ancients feigned that the gods had no
other means or power of creating heat than the friction of air, by rapid
and violent rotation. On this point, however, further inquiry must be
made, whether bodies projected by machines (as balls from cannon) do not
derive some degree of heat from meeting the air, which renders them
somewhat warm when they fall. The air in motion rather cools than heats,
as in the winds, the bellows, or breath when the mouth is contracted.
The motion, however, in such instances is not sufficiently rapid to
excite heat, and is applied to a body of air, and not to its component
parts, so that it is not surprising that heat should not be
generated.</p>
<p>We must make a more diligent inquiry into this instance; for herbs
and green and moist vegetables appear to possess a latent heat, so
small, however, as not to be perceived by the touch in single specimens,
but when they are united and confined, so that their spirit cannot
exhale into the air, and they rather warm each other, their heat is at
once manifested, and even flame occasionally in suitable substances.</p>
<p>Here, too, we must make a more diligent inquiry; for quicklime, when
sprinkled with water, appears to conceive heat, either from its being
collected into one point (as we observed of herbs when confined), or
from the irritation and exasperation of the fiery spirit by water, which
occasions a conflict and struggle. The true reason will more readily be
shown if oil be used instead of water, for oil will equally tend to
collect the confined spirit, but not to irritate. The experiment may be
made more general, both by using the ashes and calcined products of
different bodies and by pouring different liquids upon them.</p>
<p>A negative instance may be subjoined of other metals which are more
soft and soluble; for leaf gold dissolved by aqua regia, or lead by aqua
fortis, are not warm to the touch while dissolving, no more is
quicksilver (as far as I remember), but silver excites a slight heat,
and so does copper, and tin yet more plainly, and most of all iron and
steel, which excite not only a powerful heat, but a violent bubbling.
The heat, therefore, appears to be occasioned by the struggle which
takes place when these strong dissolvents penetrate, dig into, and tear
asunder the parts of those substances, while the substances themselves
resist. When, however, the substances yield more easily, scarcely any
heat is excited.</p>
<p>There is no negative instance with regard to the heat of animals,
except in insects (as has been observed), owing to their small size; for
in fishes, as compared with land animals, a lower degree rather than a
deprivation of heat is observable. In plants and vegetables, both as to
their exudations and pith when freshly exposed, there is no sensible
degree of heat. But in animals there is a great difference in the
degree, both in particular parts (for the heat varies near the heart,
the brain, and the extremities) and in the circumstances in which they
are placed, such as violent exercise and fevers.</p>
<p>Here, again, there is scarcely a negative instance. I might add that
the excrements of animals, even when they are no longer fresh, possess
evidently some effective heat, as is shown by their enriching the
soil.</p>
<p>Such liquids (whether oily or watery) as are intensely acrid exhibit
the effects of heat, by the separation and burning of bodies after some
little action upon them, yet they are not at first warm to the touch,
but they act according to their affinity and the pores of the substances
to which they are applied; for aqua regia dissolves gold but not silver
— on the contrary, aqua fortis dissolves silver but not gold; neither of
them dissolves glass, and so of the rest.</p>
<p>Let spirits of wine be tried on wood, or butter, wax, or pitch, to
see if this will melt them at all by their heat; for the twenty-fourth
instance shows that they possess properties resembling those of heat in
causing incrustation. Let an experiment also be made with a graduated
glass or calendar,93 concave at the top, by pouring well-rectified
spirits of wine into the cavity, and covering it up in order that they
may the better retain their heat, then observe whether their heat make
the water descend.</p>
<p>Spices and acrid herbs are sensibly warm to the palate, and still
more so when taken internally; one should see, therefore, on what other
substances they exhibit the effects of heat. Now, sailors tell us that
when large quantities of spices are suddenly opened, after having been
shut up for some time, there is some danger of fever and inflammation to
those who stir them or take them out. An experiment might, therefore, be
made whether such spices and herbs, when produced, will, like smoke, dry
fish and meat hung up over them.</p>
<p>There is an acrid effect and a degree of penetration in cold liquids,
such as vinegar and oil of vitriol, as well as in warm, such as oil of
marjoram and the like; they have, therefore, an equal effect in causing
animated substances to smart, and separating and consuming inanimate
parts. There is not any negative instance as to this, nor does there
exist any animal pain unaccompanied by the sensation of heat.</p>
<p>There are many effects common to cold and heat, however different in
their process; for snowballs appear to burn boys’ hands after a little
time, and cold no less than fire preserves bodies from putrefaction —
besides both heat and cold contract bodies. But it is better to refer
these instances and the like to the investigation of cold.</p>
<ol start="13" type="I">
<li>In the third place we must exhibit to the understanding the
instances in which that nature, which is the object of our inquiries, is
present in a greater or less degree, either by comparing its increase
and decrease in the same object, or its degree in different objects; for
since the form of a thing is its very essence, and the thing only
differs from its form as the apparent from the actual object, or the
exterior from the interior, or that which is considered with relation to
man from that which is considered with relation to the universe; it
necessarily follows that no nature can be considered a real form which
does not uniformly diminish and increase with the given nature. We are
wont to call this our Table of Degrees, or Comparative Instances.</li>
</ol>
<p>Table of the Degrees or Comparative Instances of Heat</p>
<p>We will first speak of those bodies which exhibit no degree of heat
sensible to the touch, but appear rather to possess a potential heat, or
disposition and preparation for it. We will then go on to others, which
are actually warm to the touch, and observe the strength and degree of
it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is no known solid or tangible body which is by its own
nature originally warm; for neither stone, metal, sulphur, fossils,
wood, water, nor dead animal carcasses are found warm. The warm springs
in baths appear to be heated accidentally, by flame, subterraneous fire
(such as is thrown up by Etna and many other mountains), or by the
contact of certain bodies, as heat is exhibited in the dissolution of
iron and tin. The degree of heat, therefore, in inanimate objects is not
sensible to our touch; but they differ in their degrees of cold, for
wood and metal are not equally cold.94 This, however, belongs to the
Table of Degrees of Cold.</p></li>
<li><p>But with regard to potential heat and predisposition to flame, we
find many inanimate substances wonderfully adapted to it, as sulphur,
naphtha, and saltpetre.</p></li>
<li><p>Bodies which have previously acquired heat, as horse dung from
the animal, or lime, and perhaps ashes and soot from fire, retain some
latent portion of it. Hence distillations and separations of substances
are effected by burying them in horse dung, and heat is excited in lime
by sprinkling it with water (as has been before observed).</p></li>
<li><p>In the vegetable world we know of no plant, nor part of any plant
(as the exudations or pith) that is warm to man’s touch. Yet (as we have
before observed) green weeds grow warm when confined, and some
vegetables are warm and others cold to our internal touch, i.e., the
palate and stomach, or even after a while to our external skin (as is
shown in plasters and ointments).</p></li>
<li><p>We know of nothing in the various parts of animals, when dead or
detached from the rest, that is warm to the touch; for horse dung itself
does not retain its heat, unless it be confined and buried. All dung,
however, appears to possess a potential heat, as in manuring fields; so
also dead bodies are endued with this latent and potential heat to such
a degree, that in cemeteries where people are interred daily the earth
acquires a secret heat, which consumes any recently deposited body much
sooner than pure earth; and they tell you that the people of the East
are acquainted with a fine soft cloth, made of the down of birds, which
can melt butter wrapped gently up in it by its own warmth.</p></li>
<li><p>Manures, such as every kind of dung, chalk, sea-sand, salt and
the like, have some disposition toward heat.</p></li>
<li><p>All putrefaction exhibits some slight degree of heat, though not
enough to be perceptible by the touch; for neither the substances which
by putrefaction are converted into animalculæ,95 as flesh and cheese,
nor rotten wood which shines in the dark, are warm to the touch. The
heat, however, of putrid substances displays itself occasionally in a
disgusting and strong scent.</p></li>
<li><p>The first degree of heat, therefore, in substances which are warm
to the human touch appears to be that of animals, and this admits of a
great variety of degrees, for the lowest (as in insects) is scarcely
perceptible, the highest scarcely equals that of the sun’s rays in warm
climates and weather, and is not so acute as to be insufferable to the
hand. It is said, however, of Constantius, and some others of a very dry
constitution and habit of body, that when attacked with violent fevers,
they became so warm as to appear almost to burn the hand applied to
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals become more warm by motion and exercise, wine and
feasting, venery, burning fevers, and grief.</p></li>
<li><p>In the paroxysm of intermittent fevers the patients are at first
seized with cold and shivering, but soon afterward become more heated
than at first — in burning and pestilential fevers they are hot from the
beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Let further inquiry be made into the comparative heat of
different animals, as fishes, quadrupeds, serpents, birds, and also of
the different species, as the lion, the kite, or man; for, according to
the vulgar opinion, fishes are the least warm internally, and birds the
most, particularly doves, hawks, and ostriches.</p></li>
<li><p>Let further inquiry be made as to the comparative heat in
different parts and limbs of the same animal; for milk, blood, seed, and
eggs are moderately warm, and less hot than the outward flesh of the
animal when in motion or agitated. The degree of heat of the brain,
stomach, heart, and the rest, has not yet been equally well
investigated.</p></li>
<li><p>All animals are externally cold in winter and cold weather, but
are thought to be internally warmer.</p></li>
<li><p>The heat of the heavenly bodies, even in the warmest climates and
seasons, never reaches such a pitch as to light or burn the driest wood
or straw, or even tinder without the aid of burning-glasses. It can,
however, raise vapor from moist substances.</p></li>
<li><p>Astronomers tell us that some stars are hotter than others. Mars
is considered the warmest after the Sun, then Jupiter, then Venus. The
Moon and, above all, Saturn, are considered to be cold. Among the fixed
stars Sirius is thought the warmest, then Cor Leonis or Regulus, then
the lesser Dog-star.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun gives out more heat as it approaches toward the
perpendicular or zenith, which may be supposed to be the case with the
other planets, according to their degree of heat; for instance, that
Jupiter gives out more heat when situated beneath Cancer or Leo than
when he is beneath Capricorn and Aquarius.</p></li>
<li><p>It is to be supposed that the sun and other planets give more
heat in perigee, from their approximation to the earth, than when in
apogee. But if in any country the sun should be both in its perigee and
nearer to the perpendicular at the same time, it must necessarily give
out more heat than in a country where it is also in perigee, but
situated more obliquely; so that the comparative altitude of the planets
should be observed, and their approach to or declination from the
perpendicular in different countries.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun and other planets are thought also to give out more heat
in proportion as they are nearer to the larger fixed stars, as when the
sun is in Leo he is nearer Cor Leonis, Cauda Leonis, Spica Virginis,
Sirius, and the lesser Dog-star, than when he is in Cancer, where,
however, he approaches nearer to the perpendicular. It is probable,
also, that the quarters of the heavens produce a greater heat (though
not perceptibly), in proportion as they are adorned with a greater
number of stars, particularly those of the first magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>On the whole, the heat of the heavenly bodies is augmented in
three ways: 1. The approach to the perpendicular; 2. Proximity or their
perigee; 3. The conjunction or union of stars.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a very considerable difference between the degree of
heat in animals, and even in the rays of the heavenly bodies (as they
reach us), and the heat of the most gentle flame, and even of all
ignited substances, nay, liquids, or the air itself when unusually
heated by fire. For the flame of spirit of wine, though diffused and
uncollected, is yet able to set straw, linen, or paper on fire, which
animal heat, or that of the sun, will never accomplish without a
burning-glass.</p></li>
<li><p>There are, however, many degrees of strength and weakness in
flame and ignited bodies: but no diligent inquiry has been made in this
respect, and we must, therefore, pass it hastily over. Of all flames,
that of spirits of wine appears to be the most gentle, except perhaps
the ignis fatuus, or the flashes from the perspiration of animals. After
this we should be inclined to place the flame of light and porous
vegetables, such as straw, reeds, and dried leaves; from which the flame
of hair or feathers differs but little. Then, perhaps, comes the flame
of wood, particularly that which contains but little rosin or pitch;
that of small wood, however (such as is usually tied up in fagots), is
milder than that of the trunks or roots of trees. This can be easily
tried in iron furnaces, where a fire of fagots or branches of trees is
of little service. Next follows the flame of oil, tallow, wax, and the
like oily and fat substances, which are not very violent. But a most
powerful heat is found in pitch and rosin, and a still greater in
sulphur, camphor, naphtha, saltpetre, and salts (after they have
discharged their crude matter), and in their compounds; as in gunpowder,
Greek fire (vulgarly called wild fire), and its varieties, which possess
such a stubborn heat as scarcely to be extinguished by water.</p></li>
<li><p>We consider that the flame which results from some imperfect
metals is very strong and active; but on all these points further
inquiry should be made.</p></li>
<li><p>The flame of vivid lightning appears to exceed all the above, so
as sometimes to have melted even wrought iron into drops, which the
other flames cannot accomplish.</p></li>
<li><p>In ignited bodies there are different degrees of heat, concerning
which, also, a diligent inquiry has not been made. We consider the
faintest heat to be that of tinder, touchwood, and dry rope match, such
as is used for discharging cannon. Next follows that of ignited charcoal
or cinders, and even bricks, and the like; but the most violent is that
of ignited metals, as iron, copper, and the like. Further inquiry,
however, must be made into this also.</p></li>
<li><p>Some ignited bodies are found to be much warmer than some flames;
for instance, red hot iron is much warmer, and burns more than the flame
of spirits of wine.</p></li>
<li><p>Some bodies even not ignited, but only heated by the fire, as
boiling water, and the air confined in reverberatories, surpass in heat
many flames and ignited substances.</p></li>
<li><p>Motion increases heat,96 as is shown in the bellows and the
blowpipe; for the harder metals are not dissolved or melted by steady
quiet fire, without the aid of the blowpipe.</p></li>
<li><p>Let an experiment be made with burning-glasses; in which respect
I have observed, that if a glass be placed at the distance of ten
inches, for instance, from the combustible object, it does not kindle or
burn it so readily, as if the glass be placed at the distance of five
inches (for instance), and be then gradually and slowly withdrawn to the
distance of ten inches. The cone and focus of the rays, however, are the
same, but the mere motion increases the effect of the heat.</p></li>
<li><p>Conflagrations, which take place with a high wind, are thought to
make greater way against than with the wind, because when the wind
slackens, the flame recoils more rapidly than it advances when the wind
is favorable.</p></li>
<li><p>Flame does not burst out or arise unless it have some hollow
space to move and exert itself in, except in the exploding flame of
gunpowder, and the like, where the compression and confinement of the
flame increase its fury.</p></li>
<li><p>The anvil becomes so hot by the hammer, that if it were a thin
plate it might probably grow red, like ignited iron by repeated strokes.
Let the experiment be tried.</p></li>
<li><p>But in ignited bodies that are porous, so as to leave room for
the fire to move itself, if its motion be prevented by strong
compression, the fire is immediately extinguished; thus it is with
tinder, or the burning snuff of a candle or lamp, or even hot charcoal
or cinders; for when they are squeezed by snuffers, or the foot, and the
like, the effect of the fire instantly ceases.</p></li>
<li><p>The approach toward a hot body increases heat in proportion to
the approximation; a similar effect to that of light, for the nearer any
object is placed toward the light, the more visible it becomes.</p></li>
<li><p>The97 union of different heats increases heat, unless the
substances be mixed; for a large and small fire in the same spot tend
mutually to increase each other’s heat, but lukewarm water poured into
boiling water cools it.</p></li>
<li><p>The continued neighborhood of a warm body increases heat. For the
heat, which perpetually passes and emanates from it, being mixed with
that which preceded it, multiplies the whole. A fire, for instance, does
not warm a room in half an hour as much as the same fire would in an
hour. This does not apply to light, for a lamp or candle placed in a
spot gives no more light by remaining there, than it did at
first.</p></li>
<li><p>The irritation of surrounding cold increases heat, as may be seen
in fires during a sharp frost. We think that this is owing not merely to
the confinement and compression of the heat (which forms a sort of
union), but also by the exasperation of it, as when the air or a stick
are violently compressed or bent, they recoil, not only to the point
they first occupied, but still further back. Let an accurate experiment,
therefore, be made with a stick, or something of the kind, put into the
flame, in order to see whether it be not sooner burned at the sides than
in the middle of it.98</p></li>
<li><p>There are many degrees in the susceptibility of heat. And, first,
it must be observed how much a low gentle heat changes and partially
warms even the bodies least susceptible of it. For even the heat of the
hand imparts a little warmth to a ball of lead or other metal held a
short time in it; so easily is heat transmitted and excited, without any
apparent change in the body.</p></li>
<li><p>Of all bodies that we are acquainted with, air admits and loses
heat the most readily, which is admirably seen in weather-glasses, whose
construction is as follows: Take a glass with a hollow belly, and a thin
and long neck; turn it upside down, and place it with its mouth downward
into another glass vessel containing water; the end of the tube touching
the bottom of the vessel, and the tube itself leaning a little on the
edge, so as to be fixed upright. In order to do this more readily, let a
little wax be applied to the edge, not, however, so as to block up the
orifice, lest, by preventing the air from escaping, the motion, which we
shall presently speak of, and which is very gentle and delicate, should
be impeded.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before the first glass be inserted in the other, its upper part (the
belly) should be warmed at the fire. Then upon placing it as we have
described, the air (which was dilated by the heat), after a sufficient
time has been allowed for it to lose the additional temperature, will
restore and contract itself to the same dimensions as that of the
external or common atmosphere at the moment of immersion, and the water
will be attracted upward in the tube to a proportionate extent. A long
narrow slip of paper should be attached to the tube, divided into as
many degrees as you please. You will then perceive, as the weather grows
warmer or colder, that the air contracts itself into a narrower space in
cold weather and dilates in the warm, which will be exhibited by the
rising of the water as the air contracts itself, and its depression as
the air dilates. The sensibility of the air with regard to heat or cold
is so delicate and exquisite, that it far exceeds the human touch, so
that a ray of sunshine, the heat of the breath, and much more, that of
the hand placed on the top of the tube, immediately causes an evident
depression of the water. We think, however, that the spirit of animals
possesses a much more delicate susceptibility of heat and cold, only
that it is impeded and blunted by the grossness of their bodies.</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><p>After air, we consider those bodies to be most sensible of heat,
which have been recently changed and contracted by cold, as snow and
ice; for they begin to be dissolved and melt with the first mild
weather. Next, perhaps, follows quicksilver; then greasy substances, as
oil, butter, and the like; then wood; then water; lastly, stones and
metals, which do not easily grow hot, particularly toward their
centre.99 When heated, however, they retain their temperature for a very
long time; so that a brick or stone, or hot iron, plunged in a basin of
cold water, and kept there for a quarter of an hour or thereabout,
retains such a heat as not to admit of being touched.</p></li>
<li><p>The less massive the body is, the more readily it grows warm at
the approach of a heated body, which shows that heat with us is somewhat
averse to a tangible mass.100</p></li>
<li><p>Heat with regard to the human senses and touch is various and
relative, so that lukewarm water appears hot if the hand be cold, and
cold if the hand be hot.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="14" type="I">
<li><p>Any one may readily see how poor we are in history, since in the
above tables, besides occasionally inserting traditions and report
instead of approved history and authentic instances (always, however,
adding some note if their credit or authority be doubtful), we are often
forced to subjoin, “Let the experiment be tried — Let further inquiry be
made.”</p></li>
<li><p>We are wont to term the office and use of these three tables the
presenting a review of instances to the understanding; and when this has
been done, induction itself is to be brought into action. For on an
individual review of all the instances a nature is to be found, such as
always to be present and absent with the given nature, to increase and
decrease with it, and, as we have said, to form a more common limit of
the nature. If the mind attempt this affirmatively from the first (which
it always will when left to itself), there will spring up phantoms, mere
theories and ill-defined notions, with axioms requiring daily
correction. These will, doubtless, be better or worse, according to the
power and strength of the understanding which creates them. But it is
only for God (the bestower and creator of forms), and perhaps for angels
and intelligences, at once to recognize forms affirmatively at the first
glance of contemplation: man, at lest, is unable to do so, and is only
allowed to proceed first by negatives, and then to conclude with
affirmatives, after every species of exclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>We must, therefore, effect a complete solution and separation of
nature; not by fire, but by the mind, that divine fire. The first work
of legitimate induction, in the discovery of forms, is rejection, or the
exclusive instances of individual natures, which are not found in some
one instance where the given nature is present, or are found in any one
instance where it is absent, or are found to increase in any one
instance where the given nature decreases, or the reverse. After an
exclusion correctly effected, an affirmative form will remain as the
residuum, solid, true, and well defined, while all volatile opinions go
off in smoke. This is readily said; but we must arrive at it by a
circuitous route. We shall perhaps, however, omit nothing that can
facilitate our progress.</p></li>
<li><p>The first and almost perpetual precaution and warning which we
consider necessary is this; that none should suppose from the great part
assigned by us to forms, that we mean such forms as the meditations and
thoughts of men have hitherto been accustomed to. In the first place, we
do not at present mean the concrete forms, which (as we have observed)
are in the common course of things compounded of simple natures, as
those of a lion, an eagle, a rose, gold, or the like. The moment for
discussing these will arrive when we come to treat of the latent process
and latent conformation, and the discovery of them as they exist in what
are called substances, or concrete natures.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Nor again, would we be thought to mean (even when treating of simple
natures) any abstract forms or ideas, either undefined or badly defined
in matter. For when we speak of forms, we mean nothing else than those
laws and regulations of simple action which arrange and constitute any
simple nature, such as heat, light, weight, in every species of matter,
and in a susceptible subject. The form of heat or form of light,
therefore, means no more than the law of heat or the law of light. Nor
do we ever abstract or withdraw ourselves from things, and the operative
branch of philosophy. When, therefore, we say (for instance) in our
investigation of the form of heat, Reject rarity, or, Rarity is not of
the form of heat, it is the same as if we were to say, Man can
superinduce heat on a dense body, or the reverse, Man can abstract or
ward off heat from a rare body.</p>
<p>But if our forms appear to any one to be somewhat abstracted, from
their mingling and uniting heterogeneous objects (the heat, for
instance, of the heavenly bodies appears to be very different from that
of fire; the fixed red of the rose and the like, from that which is
apparent in the rainbow, or the radiation of opal or the diamond;101
death by drowning, from that by burning, the sword, apoplexy, or
consumption; and yet they all agree in the common natures of heat,
redness, and death), let him be assured that his understanding is
inthralled by habit, by general appearances and hypotheses. For it is
most certain that, however heterogeneous and distinct, they agree in the
form or law which regulates heat, redness, or death; and that human
power cannot be emancipated and freed from the common course of nature,
and expanded and exalted to new efficients and new modes of operation,
except by the revelation and invention of forms of this nature. But
after this102 union of nature, which is the principal point, we will
afterward, in its proper place, treat of the divisions and ramifications
of nature, whether ordinary or internal and more real.</p>
<ol start="18" type="I">
<li>We must now offer an example of the exclusion or rejection of
natures found by the tables of review, not to be of the form of heat;
first premising that not only each table is sufficient for the rejection
of any nature, but even each single instance contained in them. For it
is clear from what has been said that every contradictory instance
destroys a hypothesis as to the form. Still, however, for the sake of
clearness, and in order to show more plainly the use of the tables, we
redouble or repeat the exclusive.</li>
</ol>
<p>An Example of the Exclusive Table, or of the Rejection of Natures
from the Form of Heat</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On account of the sun’s rays, reject elementary (or terrestrial)
nature.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of common fire, and particularly subterranean fires
(which are the most remote and secluded from the rays of the heavenly
bodies), reject celestial nature.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of the heat acquired by every description of
substances (as minerals, vegetables, the external parts of animals,
water, oil, air, etc.) by mere approximation to the fire or any warm
body, reject all variety and delicate texture of bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of iron and ignited metals, which warm other bodies,
and yet neither lose their weight nor substance, reject the imparting or
mixing of the substance of the heating body.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of boiling water and air, and also those metals and
other solid bodies which are heated, but not to ignition, or red heat,
reject flame or light.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of the rays of the moon and other heavenly bodies
(except the sun), again reject flame or light.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of the comparison between red-hot iron and the flame
of spirits of wine (for the iron is more hot and less bright, while the
flame of spirits of wine is more bright and less hot), again reject
flame and light.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of gold and other ignited metals, which are of the
greatest specific density, reject rarity.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of air, which is generally found to be cold and yet
continues rare, reject rarity.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of ignited iron,103 which does not swell in bulk, but
retains the same apparent dimension, reject the absolute expansive
motion of the whole.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of the expansion of the air in thermometers and the
like, which is absolutely moved and expanded to the eye, and yet
acquires no manifest increase of heat, again reject absolute or
expansive motion of the whole.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of the ready application of heat to all substances
without any destruction or remarkable alteration of them, reject
destructive nature or the violent communication of any new
nature.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of the agreement and conformity of the effects
produced by cold and heat, reject both expansive and contracting motion
as regards the whole.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of the heat excited by friction, reject principal
nature, by which we mean that which exists positively, and is not caused
by a preceding nature.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are other natures to be rejected; but we are merely offering
examples, and not perfect tables.</p>
<p>None of the above natures are of the form of heat; and man is freed
from them all in his operation upon heat.</p>
<ol start="19" type="I">
<li><p>In the exclusive table are laid the foundations of true
induction, which is not, however, completed until the affirmative be
attained. Nor is the exclusive table perfect, nor can it be so at first.
For it is clearly a rejection of simple natures; but if we have not as
yet good and just notions of simple natures, how can the exclusive table
be made correct? Some of the above, as the notion of elementary and
celestial nature, and rarity, are vague and ill defined. We, therefore,
who are neither ignorant nor forgetful of the great work which we
attempt, in rendering the human understanding adequate to things and
nature, by no means rest satisfied with what we have hitherto enforced,
but push the matter further, and contrive and prepare more powerful aid
for the use of the understanding, which we will next subjoin. And,
indeed, in the interpretation of nature the mind is to be so prepared
and formed, as to rest itself on proper degrees of certainty, and yet to
remember (especially at first) that what is present depends much upon
what remains behind.</p></li>
<li><p>Since, however, truth emerges more readily from error than
confusion, we consider it useful to leave the understanding at liberty
to exert itself and attempt the interpretation of nature in the
affirmative, after having constructed and weighed the three tables of
preparation, such as we have laid them down, both from the instances
there collected, and others occurring elsewhere. Which attempt we are
wont to call the liberty of the understanding, or the commencement of
interpretation, or the first vintage.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The First Vintage of the Form of Heat</p>
<p>It must be observed that the form of anything is inherent (as appears
clearly from our premises) in each individual instance in which the
thing itself is inherent, or it would not be a form. No contradictory
instance, therefore, can be alleged. The form, however, is found to be
much more conspicuous and evident in some instances than in others; in
those (for example) where its nature is less restrained and embarrassed,
and reduced to rule by other natures. Such instances we are wont to term
coruscations, or conspicuous instances. We must proceed, then, to the
first vintage of the form of heat.</p>
<p>From the instances taken collectively, as well as singly, the nature
whose limit is heat appears to be motion. This is chiefly exhibited in
flame, which is in constant motion, and in warm or boiling liquids,
which are likewise in constant motion. It is also shown in the
excitement or increase of heat by motion, as by bellows and draughts:
for which see Inst. 29, Tab. 3, and by other species of motion, as in
Inst. 28 and 31, Tab. 3. It is also shown by the extinction of fire and
heat upon any strong pressure, which restrains and puts a stop to
motion; for which see Inst. 30 and 32, Tab. 3. It is further shown by
this circumstance, namely, that every substance is destroyed, or at
least materially changed, by strong and powerful fire and heat: whence
it is clear that tumult and confusion are occasioned by heat, together
with a violent motion in the internal parts of bodies; and this
gradually tends to their dissolution.</p>
<p>What we have said with regard to motion must be thus understood, when
taken as the genus of heat: it must not be thought that heat generates
motion, or motion heat (though in some respects this be true), but that
the very essence of heat, or the substantial self104 of heat, is motion
and nothing else, limited, however, by certain differences which we will
presently add, after giving some cautions for avoiding ambiguity.</p>
<p>Sensible heat is relative, and regards man, not universe; and is
rightly held to be merely the effect of heat on animal spirit. It is
even variable in itself, since the same body (in different states of
sensation) excites the feeling of heat and of cold; this is shown by
Inst. 41, Tab. 3.</p>
<p>Nor should we confound the communication of heat or its transitive
nature, by which a body grows warm at the approach of a heated body,
with the form of heat; for heat is one thing and heating another. Heat
can be excited by friction without any previous heating body, and,
therefore, heating is excluded from the form of heat. Even when heat is
excited by the approach of a hot body, this depends not on the form of
heat, but on another more profound and common nature; namely, that of
assimilation and multiplication, about which a separate inquiry must be
made.</p>
<p>The notion of fire is vulgar, and of no assistance; it is merely
compounded of the conjunction of heat and light in any body, as in
ordinary flame and red-hot substances.</p>
<p>Laying aside all ambiguity, therefore, we must lastly consider the
true differences which limit motion and render it the form of heat.</p>
<p>I. The first difference is, that heat is an expansive motion, by
which the body strives to dilate itself, and to occupy a greater space
than before. This difference is principally seen in flame, where the
smoke or thick vapor is clearly dilated and bursts into flame.</p>
<p>It is also shown in all boiling liquids, which swell, rise, and boil
up to the sight, and the process of expansion is urged forward till they
are converted into a much more extended and dilated body than the liquid
itself, such as steam, smoke, or air.</p>
<p>It is also shown in wood and combustibles where exudation sometimes
takes place, and evaporation always.</p>
<p>It is also shown in the melting of metals, which, being very compact,
do not easily swell and dilate, but yet their spirit, when dilated and
desirous of further expansion, forces and urges its thicker parts into
dissolution, and if the heat be pushed still further, reduces a
considerable part of them into a volatile state.</p>
<p>It is also shown in iron or stones, which though not melted or
dissolved, are however softened. The same circumstance takes place in
sticks of wood, which become flexible when a little heated in warm
ashes.</p>
<p>It is most readily observed in air, which instantly and manifestly
expands with a small degree of heat, as in Inst. 38, Tab. 3.</p>
<p>It is also shown in the contrary nature of cold; for cold contracts
and narrows every substance;105 so that in intense frosts nails fall out
of the wall and brass cracks, and heated glass exposed suddenly to the
cold cracks and breaks. So the air, by a slight degree of cold,
contracts itself, as in Inst. 38, Tab. 3. More will be said of this in
the inquiry into cold.</p>
<p>Nor is it to be wondered at if cold and heat exhibit many common
effects (for which see Inst. 32, Tab. 2), since two differences, of
which we shall presently speak, belong to each nature: although in the
present difference the effects be diametrically opposed to each other.
For heat occasions an expansive and dilating motion, but cold a
contracting and condensing motion.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>The second difference is a modification of the preceding, namely,
that heat is an expansive motion, tending toward the exterior, but at
the same time bearing the body upward. For there is no doubt that there
be many compound motions, as an arrow or dart, for instance, has both a
rotatory and progressive motion. In the same way the motion of heat is
both expansive and tending upward.</li>
</ol>
<p>This difference is shown by putting the tongs or poker into the fire.
If placed perpendicularly with the hand above, they soon burn it, but
much less speedily if the hand hold them sloping or from below.</p>
<p>It is also conspicuous in distillations per descensum, which men are
wont to employ with delicate flowers, whose scent easily evaporates.
Their industry has devised placing the fire above instead of below, that
it may scorch less; for not only flame but all heat has an upward
tendency.</p>
<p>Let an experiment be made on the contrary nature of cold, whether its
contraction be downward, as the expansion of heat is upward. Take,
therefore, two iron rods or two glass tubes, alike in other respects,
and warm them a little, and place a sponge, dipped in cold water, or
some snow, below the one and above the other. We are of opinion that the
extremities will grow cold in that rod first where it is placed beneath,
as the contrary takes place with regard to heat.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>The third difference is this; that heat is not a uniform expansive
motion of the whole, but of the small particles of the body; and this
motion being at the same time restrained, repulsed, and reflected,
becomes alternating, perpetually hurrying, striving, struggling, and
irritated by the repercussion, which is the source of the violence of
flame and heat.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this difference is chiefly shown in flame and boiling liquids,
which always hurry, swell, and subside again in detached parts.</p>
<p>It is also shown in bodies of such hard texture as not to swell or
dilate in bulk, such as red-hot iron, in which the heat is most
violent.</p>
<p>It is also shown by the fires burning most briskly in the coldest
weather.</p>
<p>It is also shown by this, that when the air is dilated in the
thermometer uniformly and equably, without any impediment or repulsion,
the heat is not perceptible. In confined draughts also, although they
break out very violently, no remarkable heat is perceived, because the
motion affects the whole, without any alternating motion in the
particles; for which reason try whether flame do not burn more at the
sides than in its centre.</p>
<p>It is also shown in this, that all burning proceeds by the minute
pores of bodies — undermining, penetrating, piercing, and pricking them
as if with an infinite number of needle-points. Hence all strong acids
(if adapted to the body on which they act) exhibit the effects of fire,
from their corroding and pungent nature.</p>
<p>The difference of which we now speak is common also to the nature of
cold, in which the contracting motion is restrained by the resistance of
expansion, as in heat the expansive motion is restrained by the
resistance of contraction.</p>
<p>Whether, therefore, the particles of matter penetrate inward or
outward, the reasoning is the same, though the power be very different,
because we have nothing on earth which is intensely cold.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>The fourth difference is a modification of the preceding, namely,
that this stimulating or penetrating motion should be rapid and never
sluggish, and should take place not in the very minutest particles, but
rather in those of some tolerable dimensions.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is shown by comparing the effects of fire with those of time. Time
dries, consumes, undermines, and reduces to ashes as well as fire, and
perhaps to a much finer degree; but as its motion is very slow, and
attacks very minute particles, no heat is perceived.</p>
<p>It is also shown in a comparison of the dissolution of iron and gold;
for gold is dissolved without the excitement of any heat, but iron with
a vehement excitement of it, although most in the same time, because in
the former the penetration of the separating acid is mild, and gently
insinuates itself, and the particles of gold yield easily, but the
penetration of iron is violent, and attended with some struggle, and its
particles are more obstinate.</p>
<p>It is partially shown, also, in some gangrenes and mortifications of
flesh, which do not excite great heat or pain, from the gentle nature of
the putrefaction.</p>
<p>Let this suffice for a first vintage, or the commencement of the
interpretation of the form of heat by the liberty of the
understanding.</p>
<p>From this first vintage the form or true definition of heat
(considered relatively to the universe and not to the sense) is briefly
thus — Heat is an expansive motion restrained, and striving to exert
itself in the smaller particles.106 The expansion is modified by its
tendency to rise, though expanding toward the exterior; and the effort
is modified by its not being sluggish, but active and somewhat
violent.</p>
<p>With regard to the operative definition, the matter is the same. If
you are able to excite a dilating or expansive motion in any natural
body, and so to repress that motion and force it on itself as not to
allow the expansion to proceed equally, but only to be partially exerted
and partially repressed, you will beyond all doubt produce heat, without
any consideration as to whether the body be of earth (or elementary, as
they term it), or imbued with celestial influence, luminous or opaque,
rare or dense, locally expanded or contained within the bounds of its
first dimensions, verging to dissolution or remaining fixed, animal,
vegetable, or mineral, water, or oil, or air, or any other substance
whatever susceptible of such motion. Sensible heat is the same, but
considered relatively to the senses. Let us now proceed to further
helps.</p>
<ol start="21" type="I">
<li>After our tables of first review, our rejection or exclusive table,
and the first vintage derived from them, we must advance to the
remaining helps of the understanding with regard to the interpretation
of nature, and a true and perfect induction, in offering which we will
take the examples of cold and heat where tables are necessary, but where
fewer instances are required we will go through a variety of others, so
as neither to confound investigation nor to narrow our doctrine.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first place, therefore, we will treat of prerogative
instances;107 2. Of the supports of induction; 3. Of the correction of
induction; 4. Of varying the investigation according to the nature of
the subject; 5. Of the prerogative natures with respect to
investigation, or of what should be the first or last objects of our
research; 6. Of the limits of investigation, or a synopsis of all
natures that exist in the universe; 7. Of the application to practical
purposes, or of what relates to man; 8. Of the preparations for
investigation; 9. And lastly, of the ascending and descending scale of
axioms.108</p>
<ol start="22" type="I">
<li>Among the prerogative instances we will first mention solitary
instances. Solitary instances are those which exhibit the required
nature in subjects that have nothing in common with any other subject
than the nature in question, or which do not exhibit the required nature
in subjects resembling others in every respect except that of the nature
in question; for these instances manifestly remove prolixity, and
accelerate and confirm exclusion, so that a few of them are of as much
avail as many.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, let the inquiry be the nature of color. Prisms,
crystalline gems, which yield colors not only internally but on the
wall, dews, etc., are solitary instances; for they have nothing in
common with the fixed colors in flowers and colored gems, metals, woods,
etc., except the color itself. Hence we easily deduce that color is
nothing but a modification of the image of the incident and absorbed
light, occasioned in the former case by the different degrees of
incidence, in the latter by the various textures and forms of bodies.109
These are solitary instances as regards similitude.</p>
<p>Again, in the same inquiry the distinct veins of white and black in
marble, and the variegated colors of flowers of the same species, are
solitary instances; for the black and white of marble, and the spots of
white and purple in the flowers of the stock, agree in every respect but
that of color. Thence we easily deduce that color has not much to do
with the intrinsic natures of any body, but depends only on the coarser
and as it were mechanical arrangement of the parts. These are solitary
instances as regards difference. We call them both solitary or wild, to
borrow a word from the astronomers.</p>
<ol start="23" type="I">
<li>In the second rank of prerogative instances we will consider
migrating instances. In these the required nature passes toward
generation, having no previous existence, or toward corruption, having
first existed. In each of these divisions, therefore, the instances are
always twofold, or rather it is one instance, first in motion or on its
passage, and then brought to the opposite conclusion. These instances
not only hasten and confirm exclusion, but also reduce affirmation, or
the form itself, to a narrow compass; for the form must be something
conferred by this migration, or, on the contrary, removed and destroyed
by it; and although all exclusion advances affirmation, yet this takes
place more directly in the same than in different subjects; but if the
form (as it is quite clear from what has been advanced) exhibit itself
in one subject, it leads to all. The more simple the migration is, the
more valuable is the instance. These migrating instances are, moreover,
very useful in practice, for since they manifest the form, coupled with
that which causes or destroys it, they point out the right practice in
some subjects, and thence there is an easy transition to those with
which they are most allied. There is, however, a degree of danger which
demands caution, namely, lest they should refer the form too much to its
efficient cause, and imbue, or at least tinge, the understanding with a
false notion of the form from the appearance of such cause, which is
never more than a vehicle or conveyance of the form. This may easily be
remedied by a proper application of exclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us then give an example of a migrating instance. Let whiteness be
the required nature. An instance which passes toward generation is glass
in its entire and in its powdered state, or water in its natural state,
and when agitated to froth; for glass when entire, and water in its
natural state, are transparent and not white, but powdered glass and the
froth of water are white and not transparent. We must inquire,
therefore, what has happened to the glass or water in the course of this
migration; for it is manifest that the form of whiteness is conveyed and
introduced by the bruising of the glass and the agitation of the water;
but nothing is found to have been introduced but a diminishing of the
parts of the glass and water and the insertion of air. Yet this is no
slight progress toward discovering the form of whiteness, namely, that
two bodies, in themselves more or less transparent (as air and water, or
air and glass), when brought into contact in minute portions, exhibit
whiteness from the unequal refraction of the rays of light.</p>
<p>But here we must also give an example of the danger and caution of
which we spoke; for instance, it will readily occur to an understanding
perverted by efficients, that air is always necessary for producing the
form of whiteness, or that whiteness is only generated by transparent
bodies, which suppositions are both false, and proved to be so by many
exclusions; nay, it will rather appear (without any particular regard to
air or the like), that all bodies which are even in such of their parts
as affect the sight exhibit transparency, those which are uneven and of
simple texture whiteness, those which are uneven and of compound but
regular texture all the other colors except black, but those which are
uneven and of a compound irregular and confused texture exhibit
blackness. An example has been given, therefore, of an instance
migrating toward generation in the required nature of whiteness. An
instance migrating toward corruption in the same nature is that of
dissolving froth or snow, for they lose their whiteness and assume the
transparency of water in its pure state without air.</p>
<p>Nor should we by any means omit to state, that under migrating
instances we must comprehend not only those which pass toward generation
and destruction, but also those which pass toward increase or decrease,
for they, too, assist in the discovery of the form, as is clear from our
definition of a form and the Table of Degrees. Hence paper, which is
white when dry, is less white when moistened (from the exclusion of air
and admission of water), and tends more to transparency. The reason is
the same as in the above instances.110</p>
<ol start="24" type="I">
<li>In the third rank of prerogative instances we will class conspicuous
instances, of which we spoke in our first vintage of the form of heat,
and which we are also wont to call coruscations, or free and predominant
instances. They are such as show the required nature in its bare
substantial shape, and at its height or greatest degree of power,
emancipated and free from all impediments, or at least overcoming,
suppressing, and restraining them by the strength of its qualities; for
since every body is susceptible of many united forms of natures in the
concrete, the consequence is that they mutually deaden, depress, break,
and confine each other, and the individual forms are obscured. But there
are some subjects in which the required nature exists in its full vigor
rather than in others, either from the absence of any impediment, or the
predominance of its quality. Such instances are eminently conspicuous.
But even in these care must be taken, and the hastiness of the
understanding checked, for whatever makes a show of the form, and forces
it forward, is to be suspected, and recourse must be had to severe and
diligent exclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, let heat be the required nature. The thermometer is a
conspicuous instance of the expansive motion, which (as has been
observed) constitutes the chief part of the form of heat; for although
flame clearly exhibits expansion, yet from its being extinguished every
moment, it does not exhibit the progress of expansion. Boiling water
again, from its rapid conversion into vapor, does not so well exhibit
the expansion of water in its own shape, while red-hot iron and the like
are so far from showing this progress, that, on the contrary, the
expansion itself is scarcely evident to the senses, on account of its
spirit being repressed and weakened by the compact and coarse particles
which subdue and restrain it. But the thermometer strikingly exhibits
the expansion of the air as being evident and progressive, durable and
not transitory.111</p>
<p>Take another example. Let the required nature be weight. Quicksilver
is a conspicuous instance of weight; for it is far heavier than any
other substance except gold, which is not much heavier, and it is a
better instance than gold for the purpose of indicating the form of
weight; for gold is solid and consistent, which qualities must be
referred to density, but quicksilver is liquid and teeming with spirit,
yet much heavier than the diamond and other substances considered to be
most solid; whence it is shown that the form of gravity or weight
predominates only in the quantity of matter, and not in the close
fitting of it.112</p>
<ol start="25" type="I">
<li>In the fourth rank of prerogative instances we will class
clandestine instances, which we are also wont to call twilight
instances; they are as it were opposed to the conspicuous instances, for
they show the required nature in its lowest state of efficacy, and as it
were its cradle and first rudiments, making an effort and a sort of
first attempt, but concealed and subdued by a contrary nature. Such
instances are, however, of great importance in discovering forms, for as
the conspicuous tend easily to differences, so do the clandestine best
lead to genera, that is, to those common natures of which the required
natures are only the limits.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, let consistency, or that which confines itself, be the
required nature, the opposite of which is a liquid or flowing state. The
clandestine instances are such as exhibit some weak and low degree of
consistency in fluids, as a water bubble, which is a sort of consistent
and bounded pellicle formed out of the substance of the water. So eaves’
droppings, if there be enough water to follow them, draw themselves out
into a thin thread, not to break the continuity of the water, but if
there be not enough to follow, the water forms itself into a round drop,
which is the best form to prevent a breach of continuity; and at the
moment the thread ceases, and the water begins to fall in drops, the
thread of water recoils upward to avoid such a breach. Nay, in metals,
which when melted are liquid but more tenacious, the melted drops often
recoil and are suspended. There is something similar in the instance of
the child’s looking-glass, which little boys will sometimes form of
spittle between rushes, and where the same pellicle of water is
observable; and still more in that other amusement of children, when
they take some water rendered a little more tenacious by soap, and
inflate it with a pipe, forming the water into a sort of castle of
bubbles, which assumes such consistency, by the interposition of the
air, as to admit of being thrown some little distance without bursting.
The best example is that of froth and snow, which assume such
consistency as almost to admit of being cut, although composed of air
and water, both liquids. All these circumstances clearly show that the
terms liquid and consistent are merely vulgar notions adapted to the
sense, and that in reality all bodies have a tendency to avoid a breach
of continuity, faint and weak in bodies composed of homogeneous parts
(as is the case with liquids), but more vivid and powerful in those
composed of heterogeneous parts, because the approach of heterogeneous
matter binds bodies together, while the insinuation of homogeneous
matter loosens and relaxes them.</p>
<p>Again, to take another example, let the required nature be attraction
or the cohesion of bodies. The most remarkable conspicuous instance with
regard to its form is the magnet. The contrary nature to attraction is
non-attraction, though in a similar substance. Thus iron does not
attract iron, lead lead, wood wood, nor water water. But the clandestine
instance is that of the magnet armed with iron, or rather that of iron
in the magnet so armed. For its nature is such that the magnet when
armed does not attract iron more powerfully at any given distance than
when unarmed; but if the iron be brought in contact with the armed
magnet, the latter will sustain a much greater weight than the simple
magnet, from the resemblance of substance in the two portions of iron, a
quality altogether clandestine and hidden in the iron until the magnet
was introduced. It is manifest, therefore, that the form of cohesion is
something which is vivid and robust in the magnet, and hidden and weak
in the iron. It is to be observed, also, that small wooden arrows
without an iron point, when discharged from large mortars, penetrate
further into wooden substances (such as the ribs of ships or the like),
than the same arrows pointed with iron,113 owing to the similarity of
substance, though this quality was previously latent in the wood. Again,
although in the mass air does not appear to attract air, nor water
water, yet when one bubble is brought near another, they are both more
readily dissolved, from the tendency to contact of the water with the
water, and the air with the air.114 These clandestine instances (which
are, as has been observed, of the most important service) are
principally to be observed in small portions of bodies, for the larger
masses observe more universal and general forms, as will be mentioned in
its proper place.115</p>
<ol start="26" type="I">
<li>In the fifth rank of prerogative instances we will class
constitutive instances, which we are wont also to call collective
instances. They constitute a species or lesser form, as it were, of the
required nature. For since the real forms (which are always convertible
with the given nature) lie at some depth, and are not easily discovered,
the necessity of the case and the infirmity of the human understanding
require that the particular forms, which collect certain groups of
instances (but by no means all) into some common notion, should not be
neglected, but most diligently observed. For whatever unites nature,
even imperfectly, opens the way to the discovery of the form. The
instances, therefore, which are serviceable in this respect are of no
mean power, but endowed with some degree of prerogative.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, nevertheless, great care must be taken that, after the
discovery of several of these particular forms, and the establishing of
certain partitions or divisions of the required nature derived from
them, the human understanding do not at once rest satisfied, without
preparing for the investigation of the great or leading form, and taking
it for granted that nature is compound and divided from its very root,
despise and reject any further union as a point of superfluous
refinement, and tending to mere abstraction.</p>
<p>For instance, let the required nature be memory, or that which
excites and assists memory. The constitutive instances are order or
distribution, which manifestly assists memory: topics or commonplaces in
artificial memory, which may be either places in their literal sense, as
a gate, a corner, a window, and the like, or familiar persons and marks,
or anything else (provided it be arranged in a determinate order), as
animals, plants, and words, letters, characters, historical persons, and
the like, of which, however, some are more convenient than others. All
these commonplaces materially assist memory, and raise it far above its
natural strength. Verse, too, is recollected and learned more easily
than prose. From this group of three instances — order, the commonplaces
of artificial memory, and verses — is constituted one species of aid for
the memory,116 which may be well termed a separation from infinity. For
when a man strives to recollect or recall anything to memory, without a
preconceived notion or perception of the object of his search, he
inquires about, and labors, and turns from point to point, as if
involved in infinity. But if he have any preconceived notion, this
infinity is separated off, and the range of his memory is brought within
closer limits. In the three instances given above, the preconceived
notion is clear and determined. In the first, it must be something that
agrees with order; in the second, an image which has some relation or
agreement with the fixed commonplaces; in the third, words which fall
into a verse: and thus infinity is divided off. Other instances will
offer another species, namely, that whatever brings the intellect into
contact with something that strikes the sense (the principal point of
artificial memory), assists the memory. Others again offer another
species, namely, whatever excites an impression by any powerful passion,
as fear, shame, wonder, delight, assists the memory. Other instances
will afford another species: thus those impressions remain most fixed in
the memory which are taken from the mind when clear and least occupied
by preceding or succeeding notions, such as the things we learn in
childhood, or imagine before sleep, and the first time of any
circumstance happening. Other instances afford the following species:
namely, that a multitude of circumstances or handles assist the memory,
such as writing in paragraphs, reading aloud, or recitation. Lastly,
other instances afford still another species: thus the things we
anticipate, and which rouse our attention, are more easily remembered
than transient events; as if you read any work twenty times over, you
will not learn it by heart so readily as if you were to read it but ten
times, trying each time to repeat it, and when your memory fails you
looking into the book. There are, therefore, six lesser forms, as it
were, of things which assist the memory: namely — 1, the separation of
infinity; 2, the connection of the mind with the senses; 3, the
impression in strong passion; 4, the impression on the mind when pure;
5, the multitude of handles; 6, anticipation.</p>
<p>Again, for example’s sake, let the required nature be taste or the
power of tasting. The following instances are constitutive: 1. Those who
do not smell, but are deprived by nature of that sense, do not perceive
or distinguish rancid or putrid food by their taste, nor garlic from
roses, and the like. 2. Again, those whose nostrils are obstructed by
accident (such as a cold) do not distinguish any putrid or rancid matter
from anything sprinkled with rose-water. 3. If those who suffer from a
cold blow their noses violently at the very moment in which they have
anything fetid or perfumed in their mouth, or on their palate, they
instantly have a clear perception of the fetor or perfume. These
instances afford and constitute this species or division of taste,
namely, that it is in part nothing else than an internal smelling,
passing and descending through the upper passages of the nostrils to the
mouth and palate. But, on the other hand, those whose power of smelling
is deficient or obstructed, perceive what is salt, sweet, pungent, acid,
rough, and bitter, and the like, as well as any one else: so that the
taste is clearly something compounded of the internal smelling, and an
exquisite species of touch which we will not here discuss.</p>
<p>Again, as another example, let the required nature be the
communication of quality, without intermixture of substance. The
instance of light will afford or constitute one species of
communication, heat and the magnet another. For the communication of
light is momentary and immediately arrested upon the removal of the
original light. But heat, and the magnetic force, when once transmitted
to or excited in another body, remain fixed for a considerable time
after the removal of the source.</p>
<p>In fine, the prerogative of constitutive instances is considerable,
for they materially assist the definitions (especially in detail) and
the divisions or partitions of natures, concerning which Plato has well
said, “He who can properly define and divide is to be considered a
god.”117</p>
<ol start="27" type="I">
<li>In the sixth rank of prerogative instances we will place similar or
proportionate instances, which we are also wont to call physical
parallels, or resemblances. They are such as exhibit the resemblances
and connection of things, not in minor forms (as the constitutive do),
but at once in the concrete. They are, therefore, as it were, the first
and lowest steps toward the union of nature; nor do they immediately
establish any axiom, but merely indicate and observe a certain relation
of bodies to each other. But although they be not of much assistance in
discovering forms, yet they are of great advantage in disclosing the
frame of parts of the universe, upon whose members they practice a
species of anatomy, and thence occasionally lead us gently on to sublime
and noble axioms, especially such as relate to the construction of the
world, rather than to simple natures and forms.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, take the following similar instances: a mirror and the
eye; the formation of the ear, and places which return an echo. From
such similarity, besides observing the resemblance (which is useful for
many purposes), it is easy to collect and form this axiom. That the
organs of the senses, and bodies which produce reflections to the
senses, are of a similar nature. Again, the understanding once informed
of this, rises easily to a higher and nobler axiom; namely, that the
only distinction between sensitive and inanimate bodies, in those points
in which they agree and sympathize, is this: in the former, animal
spirit is added to the arrangement of the body, in the latter it is
wanting. So that there might be as many senses in animals as there are
points of agreement with inanimate bodies, if the animated body were
perforated, so as to allow the spirit to have access to the limb
properly disposed for action, as a fit organ. And, on the other hand,
there are, without doubt, as many motions in an inanimate as there are
senses in the animated body, though the animal spirit be absent. There
must, however, be many more motions in inanimate bodies than senses in
the animated, from the small number of organs of sense. A very plain
example of this is afforded by pains. For, as animals are liable to many
kinds and various descriptions of pains (such as those of burning, of
intense cold, of pricking, squeezing, stretching, and the like), so is
it most certain, that the same circumstances, as far as motion is
concerned, happen to inanimate bodies, such as wood or stone when
burned, frozen, pricked, cut, bent, bruised, and the like; although
there be no sensation, owing to the absence of animal spirit.</p>
<p>Again, wonderful as it may appear, the roots and branches of trees
are similar instances. For every vegetable swells and throws out its
constituent parts toward the circumference, both upward and downward.
And there is no difference between the roots and branches, except that
the root is buried in the earth, and the branches are exposed to the air
and sun. For if one take a young and vigorous shoot, and bend it down to
a small portion of loose earth, although it be not fixed to the ground,
yet will it immediately produce a root, and not a branch. And, vice
versâ, if earth be placed above, and so forced down with a stone or any
hard substance, as to confine the plant and prevent its branching
upward, it will throw out branches into the air downward.</p>
<p>The gums of trees, and most rock gems, are similar instances; for
both of them are exudations and filtered juices, derived in the former
instance from trees, in the latter from stones; the brightness and
clearness of both arising from a delicate and accurate filtering. For
nearly the same reason, the hair of animals is less beautiful and vivid
in its color than the plumage of most birds, because the juices are less
delicately filtered through the skin than through the quills.</p>
<p>The scrotum of males and matrix of females are also similar
instances; so that the noble formation which constitutes the difference
of the sexes appears to differ only as to the one being internal and the
other external; a greater degree of heat causing the genitals to
protrude in the male, while the heat of the female being too weak to
effect this, they are retained internally.</p>
<p>The fins of fishes and the feet of quadrupeds, or the feet and wings
of birds, are similar instances; to which Aristotle adds the four folds
in the motion of serpents;118 so that in the formation of the universe,
the motion of animals appears to be chiefly effected by four joints or
bendings.</p>
<p>The teeth of land animals, and the beaks of birds, are similar
instances, whence it is clear, that in all perfect animals there is a
determination of some hard substance toward the mouth.</p>
<p>Again, the resemblance and conformity of man to an inverted plant is
not absurd. For the head is the root of the nerves and animal faculties,
and the seminal parts are the lowest, not including the extremities of
the legs and arms. But in the plant, the root (which resembles the head)
is regularly placed in the lowest, and the seeds in the highest
part.119</p>
<p>Lastly, we must particularly recommend and suggest, that man’s
present industry in the investigation and compilation of natural history
be entirely changed, and directed to the reverse of the present system.
For it has hitherto been active and curious in noting the variety of
things, and explaining the accurate differences of animals, vegetables,
and minerals, most of which are the mere sport of nature, rather than of
any real utility as concerns the sciences. Pursuits of this nature are
certainly agreeable, and sometimes of practical advantage, but
contribute little or nothing to the thorough investigation of nature.
Our labor must therefore be directed toward inquiring into and observing
resemblances and analogies, both in the whole and its parts, for they
unite nature, and lay the foundation of the sciences.</p>
<p>Here, however, a severe and rigorous caution must be observed, that
we only consider as similar and proportionate instances, those which (as
we first observed) point out physical resemblances; that is, real and
substantial resemblances, deeply founded in nature, and not casual and
superficial, much less superstitious or curious; such as those which are
constantly put forward by the writers on natural magic (the most idle of
men, and who are scarcely fit to be named in connection with such
serious matters as we now treat of), who, with much vanity and folly,
describe, and sometimes too, invent, unmeaning resemblances and
sympathies.</p>
<p>But leaving such to themselves, similar instances are not to be
neglected, in the greater portions of the world’s conformation; such as
Africa and the Peruvian continent, which reaches to the Straits of
Magellan; both of which possess a similar isthmus and similar capes, a
circumstance not to be attributed to mere accident.</p>
<p>Again, the New and Old World are both of them broad and expanded
toward the north, and narrow and pointed toward the south.</p>
<p>Again, we have very remarkable similar instances in the intense cold,
toward the middle regions (as it is termed) of the air, and the violent
fires which are often found to burst from subterraneous spots, the
similarity consisting in both being ends and extremes; the extreme of
the nature of cold, for instance, is toward the boundary of heaven, and
that of the nature of heat toward the centre of the earth, by a similar
species of opposition or rejection of the contrary nature.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the axioms of the sciences, there is a similarity of
instances worthy of observation. Thus the rhetorical trope which is
called surprise, is similar to that of music termed the declining of a
cadence. Again — the mathematical postulate, that things which are equal
to the same are equal to one another, is similar to the form of the
syllogism in logic, which unites things agreeing in the middle term.120
Lastly, a certain degree of sagacity in collecting and searching for
physical points of similarity, is very useful in many respects.121</p>
<ol start="28" type="I">
<li>In the seventh rank of prerogative instances, we will place singular
instances, which we are also wont to call irregular or heteroclite (to
borrow a term from the grammarians). They are such as exhibit bodies in
the concrete, of an apparently extravagant and separate nature, agreeing
but little with other things of the same species. For, while the similar
instances resemble each other, those we now speak of are only like
themselves. Their use is much the same with that of clandestine
instances: they bring out and unite nature, and discover genera or
common natures, which must afterward be limited by real differences. Nor
should we desist from inquiry, until the properties and qualities of
those things, which may be deemed miracles, as it were, of nature, be
reduced to, and comprehended in, some form or certain law; so that all
irregularity or singularity may be found to depend on some common form;
and the miracle only consists in accurate differences, degree, and rare
coincidence, not in the species itself. Man’s meditation proceeds no
further at present, than just to consider things of this kind as the
secrets and vast efforts of nature, without an assignable cause, and, as
it were, exceptions to general rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>As examples of singular instances, we have the sun and moon among the
heavenly bodies; the magnet among minerals; quicksilver among metals;
the elephant among quadrupeds; the venereal sensation among the
different kinds of touch; the scent of sporting dogs among those of
smell. The letter S, too, is considered by the grammarians as sui
generis, from its easily uniting with double or triple consonants, which
no other letter will. These instances are of great value, because they
excite and keep alive inquiry, and correct an understanding depraved by
habit and the common course of things.</p>
<ol start="29" type="I">
<li>In the eighth rank of prerogative instances, we will place deviating
instances, such as the errors of nature, or strange and monstrous
objects, in which nature deviates and turns from her ordinary course.
For the errors of nature differ from singular instances, inasmuch as the
latter are the miracles of species, the former of individuals. Their use
is much the same, for they rectify the understanding in opposition to
habit, and reveal common forms. For with regard to these, also, we must
not desist from inquiry, till we discern the cause of the deviation. The
cause does not, however, in such cases rise to a regular form, but only
to the latent process toward such a form. For he who is acquainted with
the paths of nature, will more readily observe her deviations; and, vice
versâ, he who has learned her deviations will be able more accurately to
describe her paths.</li>
</ol>
<p>They differ again from singular instances, by being much more apt for
practice and the operative branch. For it would be very difficult to
generate new species, but less so to vary known species, and thus
produce many rare and unusual results.122 The passage from the miracles
of nature to those of art is easy; for if nature be once seized in her
variations, and the cause be manifest, it will be easy to lead her by
art to such deviation as she was at first led to by chance; and not only
to that but others, since deviations on the one side lead and open the
way to others in every direction. Of this we do not require any
examples, since they are so abundant. For a compilation, or particular
natural history, must be made of all monsters and prodigious births of
nature; of everything, in short, which is new, rare and unusual in
nature. This should be done with a rigorous selection, so as to be
worthy of credit. Those are most to be suspected which depend upon
superstition, as the prodigies of Livy, and those perhaps, but little
less, which are found in the works of writers on natural magic, or even
alchemy, and the like; for such men, as it were, are the very suitors
and lovers of fables; but our instances should be derived from some
grave and credible history, and faithful narration.</p>
<ol start="30" type="I">
<li>In the ninth rank of prerogative instances, we will place bordering
instances, which we are also wont to term participants. They are such as
exhibit those species of bodies which appear to be composed of two
species, or to be the rudiments between the one and the other. They may
well be classed with the singular or heteroclite instances; for in the
whole system of things, they are rare and extraordinary. Yet from their
dignity, they must be treated of and classed separately, for they point
out admirably the order and constitution of things, and suggest the
causes of the number and quality of the more common species in the
universe, leading the understanding from that which is, to that which is
possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have examples of them in moss, which is something between
putrescence and a plant;123 in some comets, which hold a place between
stars and ignited meteors; in flying fishes, between fishes and birds;
and in bats, between birds and quadrupeds.124 Again,</p>
<p>Simia quam similis turpissima bestia nobis.</p>
<p>We have also biformed fœtus, mingled species and the like.</p>
<ol start="31" type="I">
<li>In the tenth rank of prerogative instances, we will place the
instances of power, or the fasces (to borrow a term from the insignia of
empire), which we are also wont to call the wit or hands of man. These
are such works as are most noble and perfect, and, as it were, the
masterpieces in every art. For since our principal object is to make
nature subservient to the state and wants of man, it becomes us well to
note and enumerate the works, which have long since been in the power of
man, especially those which are most polished and perfect: because the
passage from these to new and hitherto undiscovered works, is more easy
and feasible. For if any one, after an attentive contemplation of such
works as are extant, be willing to push forward in his design with
alacrity and vigor, he will undoubtedly either advance them, or turn
them to something within their immediate reach, or even apply and
transfer them to some more noble purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nor is this all: for as the understanding is elevated and raised by
rare and unusual works of nature, to investigate and discover the forms
which include them also, so is the same effect frequently produced by
the excellent and wonderful works of art; and even to a greater degree,
because the mode of effecting and constructing the miracles of art is
generally plain, while that of effecting the miracles of nature is more
obscure. Great care, however, must be taken, that they do not depress
the understanding, and fix it, as it were, to earth.</p>
<p>For there is some danger, lest the understanding should be astonished
and chained down, and as it were bewitched, by such works of art, as
appear to be the very summit and pinnacle of human industry, so as not
to become familiar with them, but rather to suppose that nothing of the
kind can be accomplished, unless the same means be employed, with
perhaps a little more diligence, and more accurate preparation.</p>
<p>Now, on the contrary, it may be stated as a fact, that the ways and
means hitherto discovered and observed, of effecting any matter or work,
are for the most part of little value, and that all really efficient
power depends, and is really to be deduced from the sources of forms,
none of which have yet been discovered.</p>
<p>Thus (as we have before observed), had any one meditated on ballistic
machines, and battering rams, as they were used by the ancients,
whatever application he might have exerted, and though he might have
consumed a whole life in the pursuit, yet would he never have hit upon
the invention of flaming engines, acting by means of gunpowder; nor
would any person, who had made woollen manufactories and cotton the
subject of his observation and reflection, have ever discovered thereby
the nature of the silkworm or of silk.</p>
<p>Hence all the most noble discoveries have (if you observe) come to
light, not by any gradual improvement and extension of the arts, but
merely by chance; while nothing imitates or anticipates chance (which is
wont to act at intervals of ages) but the invention of forms.</p>
<p>There is no necessity for adducing any particular examples of these
instances, since they are abundant. The plan to be pursued is this: all
the mechanical, and even the liberal arts (as far as they are
practical), should be visited and thoroughly examined, and thence there
should be formed a compilation or particular history of the great
masterpieces, or most finished works in each, as well as of the mode of
carrying them into effect.</p>
<p>Nor do we confine the diligence to be used in such a compilation to
the leading works and secrets only of every art, and such as excite
wonder; for wonder is engendered by rarity, since that which is rare,
although it be compounded of ordinary natures, always begets wonder.</p>
<p>On the contrary, that which is really wonderful, from some specific
difference distinguishing it from other species, is carelessly observed,
if it be but familiar. Yet the singular instances of art should be
observed no less than those of nature, which we have before spoken of:
and as in the latter we have classed the sun, the moon, the magnet, and
the like, all of them most familiar to us, but yet in their nature
singular, so should we proceed with the singular instances of art.</p>
<p>For example: paper, a very common substance, is a singular instance
of art; for if you consider the subject attentively, you will find that
artificial substances are either woven by straight and transverse lines,
as silk, woollen, or linen cloth, and the like; or coagulated from
concrete juices, such as brick, earthenware, glass, enamel, porcelain
and the like, which admit of a polish if they be compact, but if not,
become hard without being polished; all which latter substances are
brittle, and not adherent or tenacious. On the contrary, paper is a
tenacious substance, which can be cut and torn, so as to resemble and
almost rival the skin of any animal, or the leaf of vegetables, and the
like works of nature; being neither brittle like glass, nor woven like
cloth, but having fibres and not distinct threads, just as natural
substances, so that scarcely anything similar can be found among
artificial substances, and it is absolutely singular. And in artificial
works we should certainly prefer those which approach the nearest to an
imitation of nature, or, on the other hand, powerfully govern and change
her course.</p>
<p>Again, in these instances which we term the wit and hands of man,
charms and conjuring should not be altogether despised, for although
mere amusements, and of little use, yet they may afford considerable
information.</p>
<p>Lastly, superstition and magic (in its common acceptation) are not to
be entirely omitted; for although they be overwhelmed by a mass of lies
and fables, yet some investigation should be made, to see if there be
really any latent natural operation in them; as in fascination, and the
fortifying of the imagination, the sympathy of distant objects, the
transmission of impressions from spirit to spirit no less than from body
to body, and the like.</p>
<ol start="32" type="I">
<li>From the foregoing remarks, it is clear that the last five species
of instances (the similar, singular, deviating and bordering instances,
and those of power) should not be reserved for the investigation of any
given nature, as the preceding and many of the succeeding instances
must, but a collection of them should be made at once, in the style of a
particular history, so that they may arrange the matter which enters the
understanding, and correct its depraved habit, for it is necessarily
imbued, corrupted, perverted and distorted by daily and habitual
impressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>They are to be used, therefore, as a preparative, for the purpose of
rectifying and purifying the understanding; for whatever withdraws it
from habit, levels and planes down its surface for the reception of the
dry and pure light of true notions.</p>
<p>These instances, moreover, level and prepare the way for the
operative branch, as we will mention in its proper place when speaking
of the practical deductions.</p>
<ol start="33" type="I">
<li>In the eleventh rank of prerogative instances we will place
accompanying and hostile instances. These are such as exhibit any body
or concrete, where the required nature is constantly found, as an
inseparable companion, or, on the contrary, where the required nature is
constantly avoided, and excluded from attendance, as an enemy. From
these instances may be formed certain and universal propositions, either
affirmative or negative; the subject of which will be the concrete body,
and the predicate the required nature. For particular propositions are
by no means fixed, when the required nature is found to fluctuate and
change in the concrete, either approaching and acquired, or receding and
laid aside. Hence particular propositions have no great prerogative,
except in the case of migration, of which we have spoken above. Yet such
particular propositions are of great use, when compared with the
universal, as will be mentioned in its proper place. Nor do we require
absolute affirmation or negation, even in universal propositions, for if
the exceptions be singular or rare, it is sufficient for our
purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of accompanying instances is to narrow the affirmative of
form; for as it is narrowed by the migrating instances, where the form
must necessarily be something communicated or destroyed by the act of
migration, so it is narrowed by accompanying instances, where the form
must necessarily be something which enters into the concretion of the
body, or, on the contrary, is repugnant to it; and one who is well
acquainted with the constitution or formation of the body, will not be
far from bringing to light the form of the required nature.</p>
<p>For example: let the required nature be heat. Flame is an
accompanying instance; for in water, air, stone, metal, and many other
substances, heat is variable, and can approach or retire; but all flame
is hot, so that heat always accompanies the concretion of flame. We have
no hostile instance of heat; for the senses are unacquainted with the
interior of the earth, and there is no concretion of any known body
which is not susceptible of heat.</p>
<p>Again, let solidity be the required nature. Air is a hostile
instance; for metals may be liquid or solid, so may glass; even water
may become solid by congelation, but air cannot become solid or lose its
fluidity.</p>
<p>With regard to these instances of fixed propositions, there are two
points to be observed, which are of importance. First, that if there be
no universal affirmative or negative, it be carefully noted as not
existing. Thus, in heat, we have observed that there exists no universal
negative, in such substances, at least, as have come to our knowledge.
Again, if the required nature be eternity or incorruptibility, we have
no universal affirmative within our sphere, for these qualities cannot
be predicated of any bodies below the heavens, or above the interior of
the earth. Secondly, to our general propositions as to any concrete,
whether affirmative or negative, we should subjoin the concretes which
appear to approach nearest to the non-existing substances; such as the
most gentle or least-burning flames in heat, or gold in
incorruptibility, since it approaches nearest to it. For they all serve
to show the limit of existence and non-existence, and circumscribe
forms, so that they cannot wander beyond the conditions of matter.</p>
<ol start="34" type="I">
<li><p>In the twelfth rank of prerogative instances, we will class those
subjunctive instances, of which we spoke in the last aphorism, and which
we are also wont to call instances of extremity or limits; for they are
not only serviceable when subjoined to fixed propositions, but also of
themselves and from their own nature. They indicate with sufficient
precision the real divisions of nature, and measures of things, and the
“how far” nature effects or allows of anything, and her passage thence
to something else. Such are gold in weight, iron in hardness, the whale
in the size of animals, the dog in smell, the flame of gunpowder in
rapid expansion, and others of a like nature. Nor are we to pass over
the extremes in defect, as well as in abundance, as spirits of wine in
weight, the touchstone in softness, the worms upon the skin in the size
of animals, and the like.</p></li>
<li><p>In the thirteenth rank of prerogative instances we will place
those of alliance or union. They are such as mingle and unite natures
held to be heterogeneous, and observed and marked as such in received
classifications.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These instances show that the operation and effect, which is
considered peculiar to some one of such heterogeneous natures, may also
be attributed to another nature styled heterogeneous, so as to prove
that the difference of the natures is not real nor essential, but a mere
modification of a common nature. They are very serviceable, therefore,
in elevating and carrying on the mind, from differences to genera, and
in removing those phantoms and images of things, which meet it in
disguise in concrete substances.</p>
<p>For example: let the required nature be heat. The classification of
heat into three kinds, that of the celestial bodies, that of animals,
and that of fire, appears to be settled and admitted; and these kinds of
heat, especially one of them compared with the other two, are supposed
to be different, and clearly heterogeneous in their essence and species,
or specific nature, since the heat of the heavenly bodies and of animals
generates and cherishes, while that of fire corrupts and destroys. We
have an instance of alliance, then, in a very common experiment, that of
a vine branch admitted into a building where there is a constant fire,
by which the grapes ripen a whole month sooner than in the air; so that
fruit upon the tree can be ripened by fire, although this appear the
peculiar effect of the sun. From this beginning, therefore, the
understanding rejects all essential difference, and easily ascends to
the investigation of the real differences between the heat of the sun
and that of fire, by which their operation is rendered dissimilar,
although they partake of a common nature.</p>
<p>These differences will be found to be four in number. 1. The heat of
the sun is much milder and gentler in degree than that of fire. 2. It is
much more moist in quality, especially as it is transmitted to us
through the air. 3. Which is the chief point, it is very unequal,
advancing and increased at one time, retiring and diminished at another,
which mainly contributes to the generation of bodies. For Aristotle
rightly asserted, that the principal cause of generation and corruption
on the surface of the earth was the oblique path of the sun in the
zodiac, whence its heat becomes very unequal, partly from the
alternation of night and day, partly from the succession of summer and
winter. Yet must he immediately corrupt and pervert his discovery, by
dictating to nature according to his habit, and dogmatically assigning
the cause of generation to the approach of the sun, and that of
corruption to its retreat; while, in fact, each circumstance
indifferently and not respectively contributes both to generation and
corruption; for unequal heat tends to generate and corrupt, as equable
heat does to preserve. 4. The fourth difference between the heat of the
sun and fire is of great consequence; namely, that the sun, gradually,
and for a length of time, insinuates its effects, while those of fire
(urged by the impatience of man) are brought to a termination in a
shorter space of time. But if any one were to pay attention to the
tempering of fire, and reducing it to a more moderate and gentle degree
(which may be done in various ways), and then were to sprinkle and mix a
degree of humidity with it; and, above all, were to imitate the sun in
its inequality; and, lastly, were patiently to suffer some delay (not
such, however, as is proportioned to the effects of the sun, but more
than men usually admit of in those of fire), he would soon banish the
notion of any difference, and would attempt, or equal, or perhaps
sometimes surpass the effect of the sun, by the heat of fire. A like
instance of alliance is that of reviving butterflies, benumbed and
nearly dead from cold, by the gentle warmth of fire; so that fire is no
less able to revive animals than to ripen vegetables. We may also
mention the celebrated invention of Fracastorius, of applying a pan
considerably heated to the head in desperate cases of apoplexy, which
clearly expands the animal spirits, when compressed and almost
extinguished by the humors and obstructions of the brain, and excites
them to action, as the fire would operate on water or air, and in the
result produces life. Eggs are sometimes hatched by the heat of fire, an
exact imitation of animal heat; and there are many instances of the like
nature, so that no one can doubt that the heat of fire, in many cases,
can be modified till it resemble that of the heavenly bodies and of
animals.</p>
<p>Again, let the required natures be motion and rest. There appears to
be a settled classification, grounded on the deepest philosophy, that
natural bodies either revolve, move in a straight line, or stand still
and rest. For there is either motion without limit, or continuance
within a certain limit, or a translation toward a certain limit. The
eternal motion of revolution appears peculiar to the heavenly bodies,
rest to this our globe, and the other bodies (heavy and light, as they
are termed, that is to say, placed out of their natural position) are
borne in a straight line to masses or aggregates which resemble them,
the light toward the heaven, the heavy toward the earth; and all this is
very fine language.</p>
<p>But we have an instance of alliance in low comets, which revolve,
though far below the heavens; and the fiction of Aristotle, of the comet
being fixed to, or necessarily following some star, has been long since
exploded; not only because it is improbable in itself, but from the
evident fact of the discursive and irregular motion of comets through
various parts of the heavens.125</p>
<p>Another instance of alliance is that of the motion of air, which
appears to revolve from east to west within the tropics, where the
circles of revolution are the greatest.</p>
<p>The flow and ebb of the sea would perhaps be another instance, if the
water were once found to have a motion of revolution, though slow and
hardly perceptible, from east to west, subject, however, to a reaction
twice a day. If this be so, it is clear that the motion of revolution is
not confined to the celestial bodies, but is shared, also, by air and
water.</p>
<p>Again — the supposed peculiar disposition of light bodies to rise is
rather shaken; and here we may find an instance of alliance in a water
bubble. For if air be placed under water, it rises rapidly toward the
surface by that striking motion (as Democritus terms it) with which the
descending water strikes the air and raises it, not by any struggle or
effort of the air itself; and when it has reached the surface of the
water, it is prevented from ascending any further, by the slight
resistance it meets with in the water, which does not allow an immediate
separation of its parts, so that the tendency of the air to rise must be
very slight.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be weight. It is certainly a received
classification, that dense and solid bodies are borne toward the centre
of the earth, and rare and light bodies to the circumference of the
heavens, as their appropriate places. As far as relates to places
(though these things have much weight in the schools), the notion of
there being any determinate place is absurd and puerile. Philosophers
trifle, therefore, when they tell you, that if the earth were
perforated, heavy bodies would stop on their arrival at the centre. This
centre would indeed be an efficacious nothing, or mathematical point,
could it affect bodies or be sought by them, for a body is not acted
upon except by a body.126 In fact, this tendency to ascend and descend
is either in the conformation of the moving body, or in its harmony and
sympathy with another body. But if any dense and solid body be found,
which does not, however, tend toward the earth, the classification is at
an end. Now, if we allow of Gilbert’s opinion, that the magnetic power
of the earth, in attracting heavy bodies, is not extended beyond the
limit of its peculiar virtue (which operates always at a fixed distance
and no further),127 and this be proved by some instance, such an
instance will be one of alliance in our present subject. The nearest
approach to it is that of waterspouts, frequently seen by persons
navigating the Atlantic toward either of the Indies. For the force and
mass of the water suddenly effused by waterspouts, appears to be so
considerable, that the water must have been collected previously, and
have remained fixed where it was formed, until it was afterward forced
down by some violent cause, rather than made to fall by the natural
motion of gravity: so that it may be conjectured that a dense and
compact mass, at a great distance from the earth, may be suspended as
the earth itself is, and would not fall, unless forced down. We do not,
however, affirm this as certain. In the meanwhile, both in this respect
and many others, it will readily be seen how deficient we are in natural
history, since we are forced to have recourse to suppositions for
examples, instead of ascertained instances.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the discursive power of the mind.
The classification of human reason and animal instinct appears to be
perfectly correct. Yet there are some instances of the actions of brutes
which seem to show that they, too, can syllogize. Thus it is related,
that a crow, which had nearly perished from thirst in a great drought,
saw some water in the hollow trunk of a tree, but as it was too narrow
for him to get into it, he continued to throw in pebbles, which made the
water rise till he could drink; and it afterward became a proverb.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be vision. The classification appears
real and certain, which considers light as that which is originally
visible, and confers the power of seeing; and color, as being
secondarily visible, and not capable of being seen without light, so as
to appear a mere image or modification of light. Yet there are instances
of alliance in each respect; as in snow when in great quantities, and in
the flame of sulphur; the one being a color originally and in itself
light, the other a light verging toward color.128</p>
<ol start="36" type="I">
<li>In the fourteenth rank of prerogative instances, we will place the
instances of the cross, borrowing our metaphor from the crosses erected
where two roads meet, to point out the different directions. We are wont
also to call them decisive and judicial instances, and in some cases
instances of the oracle and of command. Their nature is as follows: When
in investigating any nature the understanding is, as it were, balanced,
and uncertain to which of two or more natures the cause of the required
nature should be assigned, on account of the frequent and usual
concurrence of several natures, the instances of the cross show that the
union of one nature with the required nature is firm and indissoluble,
while that of the other is unsteady and separable; by which means the
question is decided, and the first is received as the cause, while the
other is dismissed and rejected. Such instances, therefore, afford great
light, and are of great weight, so that the course of interpretation
sometimes terminates, and is completed in them. Sometimes, however, they
are found among the instances already observed, but they are generally
new, being expressly and purposely sought for and applied, and brought
to light only by attentive and active diligence.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example: let the required nature be the flow and ebb of the sea,
which is repeated twice a day, at intervals of six hours between each
advance and retreat, with some little difference, agreeing with the
motion of the moon. We have here the following crossways:</p>
<p>This motion must be occasioned either by the advancing and the
retiring of the sea, like water shaken in a basin, which leaves one side
while it washes the other; or by the rising of the sea from the bottom,
and its again subsiding, like boiling water. But a doubt arises, to
which of these causes we should assign the flow and ebb. If the first
assertion be admitted, it follows, that when there is a flood on one
side, there must at the same time be an ebb on another, and the question
therefore is reduced to this. Now Acosta, and some others, after a
diligent inquiry, have observed that the flood tide takes place on the
coast of Florida, and the opposite coasts of Spain and Africa, at the
same time, as does also the ebb; and that there is not, on the contrary,
a flood tide at Florida when there is an ebb on the coasts of Spain and
Africa. Yet if one consider the subject attentively, this does not prove
the necessity of a rising motion, nor refute the notion of a progressive
motion. For the motion may be progressive, and yet inundate the opposite
shores of a channel at the same time; as if the waters be forced and
driven together from some other quarter, for instance, which takes place
in rivers, for they flow and ebb toward each bank at the same time, yet
their motion is clearly progressive, being that of the waters from the
sea entering their mouths. So it may happen, that the waters coming in a
vast body from the eastern Indian Ocean are driven together, and forced
into the channel of the Atlantic, and therefore inundate both coasts at
once. We must inquire, therefore, if there be any other channel by which
the waters can at the same time sink and ebb; and the Southern Ocean at
once suggests itself, which is not less than the Atlantic, but rather
broader and more extensive than is requisite for this effect.</p>
<p>We at length arrive, then, at an instance of the cross, which is
this. If it be positively discovered, that when the flood sets in toward
the opposite coasts of Florida and Spain in the Atlantic, there is at
the same time a flood tide on the coasts of Peru and the back part of
China, in the Southern Ocean, then assuredly, from this decisive
instance, we must reject the assertion, that the flood and ebb of the
sea, about which we inquire, takes place by progressive motion; for no
other sea or place is left where there can be an ebb. But this may most
easily be learned, by inquiring of the inhabitants of Panama and Lima
(where the two oceans are separated by a narrow isthmus), whether the
flood and ebb takes place on the opposite sides of the isthmus at the
same time, or the reverse. This decision or rejection appears certain,
if it be granted that the earth is fixed; but if the earth revolves, it
may perhaps happen, that from the unequal revolution (as regards
velocity) of the earth and the waters of the sea, there may be a violent
forcing of the waters into a mass, forming the flood, and a subsequent
relaxation of them (when they can no longer bear the accumulation),
forming the ebb. A separate inquiry must be made into this. Even with
this hypothesis, however, it remains equally true, that there must be an
ebb somewhere, at the same time that there is a flood in another
quarter.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the latter of the two motions we
have supposed; namely, that of a rising and subsiding motion, if it
should happen that upon diligent examination the progressive motion be
rejected. We have, then, three ways before us, with regard to this
nature. The motion, by which the waters raise themselves, and again fall
back, in the floods and ebbs, without the addition of any other water
rolled toward them, must take place in one of the three following ways:
Either the supply of water emanates from the interior of the earth, and
returns back again; or there is really no greater quantity of water, but
the same water (without any augmentation of its quantity) is extended or
rarefied, so as to occupy a greater space and dimension, and again
contracts itself; or there is neither an additional supply nor any
extension, but the same waters (with regard to quantity, density, or
rarity) raise themselves and fall from sympathy, by some magnetic power
attracting and calling them up, as it were, from above. Let us then
(passing over the first two motions) reduce the investigation to the
last, and inquire if there be any such elevation of the water by
sympathy or a magnetic force; and it is evident, in the first place,
that the whole mass of water being placed in the trench or cavity of the
sea, cannot be raised at once, because there would not be enough to
cover the bottom, so that if there be any tendency of this kind in the
water to raise itself, yet it would be interrupted and checked by the
cohesion of things, or (as the common expression is) that there may be
no vacuum. The water, therefore, must rise on one side, and for that
reason be diminished and ebb on another. But it will again necessarily
follow that the magnetic power not being able to operate on the whole,
operates most intensely on the centre, so as to raise the waters there,
which, when thus raised successively, desert and abandon the
sides.129</p>
<p>We at length arrive, then, at an instance of the cross, which is
this: if it be found that during the ebb the surface of the waters at
sea is more curved and round, from the waters rising in the middle, and
sinking at the sides or coast, and if, during a flood, it be more even
and level, from the waters returning to their former position, then
assuredly, by this decisive instance, the raising of them by a magnetic
force can be admitted; if otherwise, it must be entirely rejected. It is
not difficult to make the experiment (by sounding in straits), whether
the sea be deeper toward the middle in ebbs, than in floods. But it must
be observed, if this be the case, that (contrary to common opinion) the
waters rise in ebbs, and only return to their former position in floods,
so as to bathe and inundate the coast.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the spontaneous motion of
revolution, and particularly, whether the diurnal motion, by which the
sun and stars appear to us to rise and set, be a real motion of
revolution in the heavenly bodies, or only apparent in them, and real in
the earth. There may be an instance of the cross of the following
nature. If there be discovered any motion in the ocean from east to
west, though very languid and weak, and if the same motion be discovered
rather more swift in the air (particularly within the tropics, where it
is more perceptible from the circles being greater). If it be discovered
also in the low comets, and be already quick and powerful in them; if it
be found also in the planets, but so tempered and regulated as to be
slower in those nearest the earth, and quicker in those at the greatest
distance, being quickest of all in the heavens, then the diurnal motion
should certainly be considered as real in the heavens, and that of the
earth must be rejected; for it will be evident that the motion from east
to west is part of the system of the world and universal; since it is
most rapid in the height of the heavens, and gradually grows weaker,
till it stops and is extinguished in rest at the earth.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be that other motion of revolution, so
celebrated among astronomers, which is contrary to the diurnal, namely,
from west to east — and which the ancient astronomers assign to the
planets, and even to the starry sphere, but Copernicus and his followers
to the earth also — and let it be examined whether any such motion be
found in nature, or it be rather a fiction and hypothesis for abridging
and facilitating calculation, and for promoting that fine notion of
effecting the heavenly motions by perfect circles; for there is nothing
which proves such a motion in heavenly objects to be true and real,
either in a planet’s not returning in its diurnal motion to the same
point of the starry sphere, or in the pole of the zodiac being different
from that of the world, which two circumstances have occasioned this
notion. For the first phenomenon is well accounted for by the spheres
overtaking or falling behind each other, and the second by spiral lines;
so that the inaccuracy of the return and declination to the tropics may
be rather modifications of the one diurnal motion than contrary motions,
or about different poles. And it is most certain, if we consider
ourselves for a moment as part of the vulgar (setting aside the fictions
of astronomers and the school, who are wont undeservedly to attack the
senses in many respects, and to affect obscurity), that the apparent
motion is such as we have said, a model of which we have sometimes
caused to be represented by wires in a sort of a machine.</p>
<p>We may take the following instances of the cross upon this subject.
If it be found in any history worthy of credit, that there has existed
any comet, high or low, which has not revolved in manifest harmony
(however irregularly) with the diurnal motion, then we may decide so far
as to allow such a motion to be possible in nature. But if nothing of
the sort be found, it must be suspected, and recourse must be had to
other instances of the cross.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be weight or gravity. Heavy and
ponderous bodies must, either of their own nature, tend toward the
centre of the earth by their peculiar formation, or must be attracted
and hurried by the corporeal mass of the earth itself, as being an
assemblage of similar bodies, and be drawn to it by sympathy. But if the
latter be the cause, it follows that the nearer bodies approach to the
earth, the more powerfully and rapidly they must be borne toward it, and
the further they are distant, the more faintly and slowly (as is the
case in magnetic attractions), and that this must happen within a given
distance; so that if they be separated at such a distance from the earth
that the power of the earth cannot act upon them, they will remain
suspended like the earth, and not fall at all.130</p>
<p>The following instance of the cross may be adopted. Take a clock
moved by leaden weights,131 and another by a spring, and let them be set
well together, so that one be neither quicker nor slower than the other;
then let the clock moved by weights be placed on the top of a very high
church, and the other be kept below, and let it be well observed, if the
former move slower than it did, from the diminished power of the
weights. Let the same experiment be made at the bottom of mines worked
to a considerable depth, in order to see whether the clock move more
quickly from the increased power of the weights. But if this power be
found to diminish at a height, and to increase in subterraneous places,
the attraction of the corporeal mass of the earth may be taken as the
cause of weight.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the polarity of the steel needle
when touched with the magnet. We have these two ways with regard to this
nature — Either the touch of the magnet must communicate polarity to the
steel toward the north and south, or else it may only excite and prepare
it, while the actual motion is occasioned by the presence of the earth,
which Gilbert considers to be the case, and endeavors to prove with so
much labor. The particulars he has inquired into with such ingenious
zeal amount to this — 1. An iron bolt placed for a long time toward the
north and south acquires polarity from this habit, without the touch of
the magnet, as if the earth itself operating but weakly from its
distance (for the surface or outer crust of the earth does not, in his
opinion, possess the magnetic power), yet, by long continued motion,
could supply the place of the magnet, excite the iron, and convert and
change it when excited. 2. Iron, at a red or white heat, when quenched
in a direction parallel to the north and south, also acquires polarity
without the touch of the magnet, as if the parts of iron being put in
motion by ignition, and afterward recovering themselves, were, at the
moment of being quenched, more susceptible and sensitive of the power
emanating from the earth, than at other times, and therefore as it were
excited. But these points, though well observed, do not completely prove
his assertion.</p>
<p>An instance of the cross on this point might be as follows: Let a
small magnetic globe be taken, and its poles marked, and placed toward
the east and west, not toward the north and south, and let it continue
thus. Then let an untouched needle be placed over it, and suffered to
remain so for six or seven days. Now, the needle (for this is not
disputed), while it remains over the magnet, will leave the poles of the
world and turn to those of the magnet, and therefore, as long as it
remains in the above position, will turn to the east and west. But if
the needle, when removed from the magnet and placed upon a pivot, be
found immediately to turn to the north and south, or even by degrees to
return thither, then the presence of the earth must be considered as the
cause, but if it remains turned as at first, toward the east and west,
or lose its polarity, then that cause must be suspected, and further
inquiry made.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the corporeal substance of the
moon, whether it be rare, fiery, and aërial (as most of the ancient
philosophers have thought), or solid and dense (as Gilbert and many of
the moderns, with some of the ancients, hold).132 The reasons for this
latter opinion are grounded chiefly upon this, that the moon reflects
the sun’s rays, and that light does not appear capable of being
reflected except by solids. The instances of the cross will therefore
(if any) be such as to exhibit reflection by a rare body, such as flame,
if it be but sufficiently dense. Now, certainly, one of the reasons of
twilight is the reflection133 of the rays of the sun by the upper part
of the atmosphere. We see the sun’s rays also reflected on fine evenings
by streaks of moist clouds, with a splendor not less, but perhaps more
bright and glorious than that reflected from the body of the moon, and
yet it is not clear that those clouds have formed into a dense body of
water. We see, also, that the dark air behind the windows at night
reflects the light of a candle in the same manner as a dense body would
do.134 The experiment should also be made of causing the sun’s rays to
fall through a hole upon some dark and bluish flame. The unconfined rays
of the sun, when falling on faint flames, do certainly appear to deaden
them, and render them more like white smoke than flames. These are the
only instances which occur at present of the nature of those of the
cross, and better perhaps can be found. But it must always be observed
that reflection is not to be expected from flame, unless it be of some
depth, for otherwise it becomes nearly transparent. This at least may be
considered certain, that light is always either received and transmitted
or reflected by an even surface.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the motion of projectiles (such as
darts, arrows, and balls) through the air. The school, in its usual
manner, treats this very carelessly, considering it enough to
distinguish it by the name of violent motion, from that which they term
natural, and as far as regards the first percussion or impulse,
satisfies itself by its axiom, that two bodies cannot exist in one
place, or there would be a penetration of dimensions. With regard to
this nature we have these two crossways — The motion must arise either
from the air carrying the projected body, and collecting behind it, like
a stream behind boats, or the wind behind straws; or from the parts of
the body itself not supporting the impression, but pushing themselves
forward in succession to ease it. Fracastorius, and nearly all those who
have entered into any refined inquiry upon the subject, adopt the first.
Nor can it be doubted that the air has some effect, yet the other motion
is without doubt real, as is clear from a vast number of experiments.
Among others we may take this instance of the cross, namely, that a thin
plate or wire of iron rather stiff, or even a reed or pen split in two,
when drawn up and bent between the finger and thumb, will leap forward;
for it is clear that this cannot be attributed to the air’s being
collected behind the body, because the source of motion is in the centre
of the plate or pen, and not in its extremities.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the rapid and powerful motion of
the explosion of gunpowder, by which such vast masses are upheaved, and
such weights discharged as we observe in large mines and mortars, there
are two crossways before us with regard to this nature. This motion is
excited either by the mere effort of the body expanding itself when
inflamed, or by the assisting effort of the crude spirit, which escapes
rapidly from fire, and bursts violently from the surrounding flame as
from a prison. The school, however, and common opinion only consider the
first effort; for men think that they are great philosophers when they
assert that flame, from the form of the element, is endowed with a kind
of necessity of occupying a greater space than the same body had
occupied when in the form of powder, and that thence proceeds the motion
in question. In the meantime they do not observe, that although this may
be true, on the supposition of flame being generated, yet the generation
may be impeded by a weight of sufficient force to compress and suffocate
it, so that no such necessity exists as they assert. They are right,
indeed, in imagining that the expansion and the consequent emission or
removal of the opposing body, is necessary if flame be once generated,
but such a necessity is avoided if the solid opposing mass suppress the
flame before it be generated; and we in fact see that flame, especially
at the moment of its generation, is mild and gentle, and requires a
hollow space where it can play and try its force. The great violence of
the effect, therefore, cannot be attributed to this cause; but the truth
is, that the generation of these exploding flames and fiery blasts
arises from the conflict of two bodies of a decidedly opposite nature —
the one very inflammable, as is the sulphur, the other having an
antipathy to flame, namely, the crude spirit of the nitre; so that an
extraordinary conflict takes place while the sulphur is becoming
inflamed as far as it can (for the third body, the willow charcoal,
merely incorporates and conveniently unites the two others), and the
spirit of nitre is escaping, as far also as it can, and at the same time
expanding itself (for air, and all crude substances, and water are
expanded by heat), fanning thus, in every direction, the flame of the
sulphur by its escape and violence, just as if by invisible bellows.</p>
<p>Two kinds of instances of the cross might here be used — the one of
very inflammable substances, such as sulphur and camphor, naphtha and
the like, and their compounds, which take fire more readily and easily
than gunpowder if left to themselves (and this shows that the effort to
catch fire does not of itself produce such a prodigious effect); the
other of substances which avoid and repel flame, such as all salts; for
we see that when they are cast into the fire, the aqueous spirit escapes
with a crackling noise before flame is produced, which also happens in a
less degree in stiff leaves, from the escape of the aqueous part before
the oily part has caught fire. This is more particularly observed in
quicksilver, which is not improperly called mineral water, and which,
without any inflammation, nearly equals the force of gunpowder by simple
explosion and expansion, and is said, when mixed with gunpowder, to
increase its force.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the transitory nature of flame and
its momentaneous extinction; for to us the nature of flame does not
appear to be fixed or settled, but to be generated from moment to
moment, and to be every instant extinguished; it being clear that those
flames which continue and last, do not owe their continuance to the same
mass of flame, but to a continued succession of new flame regularly
generated, and that the same identical flame does not continue. This is
easily shown by removing the food or source of the flame, when it at
once goes out. We have the two following crossways with regard to this
nature:</p>
<p>This momentary nature either arises from the cessation of the cause
which first produced it, as in light, sounds, and violent motions, as
they are termed, or flame may be capable, by its own nature, of
duration, but is subjected to some violence from the contrary natures
which surround it, and is destroyed.</p>
<p>We may therefore adopt the following instance of the cross. We see to
what a height the flames rise in great conflagrations; for as the base
of the flame becomes more extensive, its vertex is more lofty. It
appears, then, that the commencement of the extinction takes place at
the sides, where the flame is compressed by the air, and is ill at ease;
but the centre of the flame, which is untouched by the air and
surrounded by flame, continues the same, and is not extinguished until
compressed by degrees by the air attacking it from the sides. All flame,
therefore, is pyramidal, having its base near the source, and its vertex
pointed from its being resisted by the air, and not supplied from the
source. On the contrary, the smoke, which is narrow at the base, expands
in its ascent, and resembles an inverted pyramid, because the air admits
the smoke, but compresses the flame; for let no one dream that the
lighted flame is air, since they are clearly heterogeneous.</p>
<p>The instance of the cross will be more accurate, if the experiment
can be made by flames of different colors. Take, therefore, a small
metal sconce, and place a lighted taper in it, then put it in a basin,
and pour a small quantity of spirits of wine round the sconce, so as not
to reach its edge, and light the spirit. Now the flame of the spirit
will be blue, and that of the taper yellow; observe, therefore, whether
the latter (which can easily be distinguished from the former by its
color, for flames do not mix immediately, as liquids do) continue
pyramidal, or tend more to a globular figure, since there is nothing to
destroy or compress it. If the latter result be observed, it must be
considered as settled, that flame continues positively the same, while
inclosed within another flame, and not exposed to the resisting force of
the air.</p>
<p>Let this suffice for the instances of the cross. We have dwelt the
longer upon them in order gradually to teach and accustom mankind to
judge of nature by these instances, and enlightening experiments, and
not by probable reasons.135</p>
<ol start="37" type="I">
<li>We will treat of the instances of divorce as the fifteenth of our
prerogative instances. They indicate the separation of natures of the
most common occurrence. They differ, however, from those subjoined to
the accompanying instances; for the instances of divorce point out the
separation of a particular nature from some concrete substance with
which it is usually found in conjunction, while the hostile instances
point out the total separation of one nature from another. They differ,
also, from the instances of the cross, because they decide nothing, but
only inform us that the one nature is capable of being separated from
the other. They are of use in exposing false forms, and dissipating
hasty theories derived from obvious facts; so that they add ballast and
weight, as it were, to the understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, let the acquired natures be those four which Telesius
terms associates, and of the same family, namely, heat, light, rarity,
and mobility, or promptitude to motion; yet many instances of divorce
can be discovered between them. Air is rare and easily moved, but
neither hot nor light; the moon is light but not hot; boiling water is
warm but not light; the motion of the needle in the compass is swift and
active, and yet its substance is cold, dense, and opaque; and there are
many similar examples.</p>
<p>Again, let the required natures be corporeal nature and natural
action. The latter appears incapable of subsisting without some body,
yet may we, perhaps, even here find an instance of divorce, as in the
magnetic motion, which draws the iron to the magnet, and heavy bodies to
the globe of the earth; to which we may add other actions which operate
at a distance. For such action takes place in time, by distinct moments,
not in an instant; and in space, by regular degrees and distances. There
is, therefore, some one moment of time and some interval of space, in
which the power or action is suspended between the two bodies creating
the motion. Our consideration, then, is reduced to this, whether the
bodies which are the extremes of motion prepare or alter the
intermediate bodies, so that the power advances from one extreme to the
other by succession and actual contact, and in the meantime exists in
some intermediate body; or whether there exists in reality nothing but
the bodies, the power, and the space? In the case of the rays of light,
sounds, and heat, and some other objects which operate at a distance, it
is indeed probable that the intermediate bodies are prepared and
altered, the more so because a qualified medium is required for their
operation. But the magnetic or attractive power admits of an indifferent
medium, and it is not impeded in any. But if that power or action is
independent of the intermediate body, it follows that it is a natural
power or action existing in a certain time and space without any body,
since it exists neither in the extreme nor in the intermediate bodies.
Hence the magnetic action may be taken as an instance of divorce of
corporeal nature and natural action; to which we may add, as a corollary
and an advantage not to be neglected, that it may be taken as a proof of
essence and substance being separate and incorporeal, even by those who
philosophize according to the senses. For if natural power and action
emanating from a body can exist at any time and place entirely without
any body, it is nearly a proof that it can also emanate originally from
an incorporeal substance; for a corporeal nature appears to be no less
necessary for supporting and conveying, than for exciting or generating
natural action.</p>
<ol start="38" type="I">
<li>Next follow five classes of instances which we are wont to call by
the general term of instances of the lamp, or of immediate information.
They are such as assist the senses; for since every interpretation of
nature sets out from the senses, and leads, by a regular fixed and
well-established road, from the perceptions of the senses to those of
the understanding (which are true notions and axioms), it necessarily
follows, that in proportion as the representatives or ministerings of
the senses are more abundant and accurate, everything else must be more
easy and successful.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these five sets of instances of the lamp, strengthen,
enlarge, and correct the immediate operations of the senses; the second
reduce to the sphere of the senses such matters as are beyond it; the
third indicate the continued process or series of such things and
motions, as for the most part are only observed in their termination, or
in periods; the fourth supply the absolute wants of the senses; the
fifth excite their attention and observation, and at the same time limit
the subtilty of things. We will now proceed to speak of them singly.</p>
<ol start="39" type="I">
<li>In the sixteenth rank, then, of prerogative instances, we will place
the instances of the door or gate, by which name we designate such as
assist the immediate action of the senses. It is obvious, that sight
holds the first rank among the senses, with regard to information, for
which reason we must seek principally helps for that sense. These helps
appear to be threefold, either to enable it to perceive objects not
naturally seen, or to see them from a greater distance, or to see them
more accurately and distinctly.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have an example of the first (not to speak of spectacles and the
like, which only correct and remove the infirmity of a deficient sight,
and therefore give no further information) in the lately invented
microscopes, which exhibit the latent and invisible minutiæ of
substances, and their hidden formation and motion, by wonderfully
increasing their apparent magnitude. By their assistance we behold with
astonishment the accurate form and outline of a flea, moss, and
animalculæ, as well as their previously invisible color and motion. It
is said, also, that an apparently straight line, drawn with a pen or
pencil, is discovered by such a microscope to be very uneven and curved,
because neither the motion of the hand, when assisted by a ruler, nor
the impression of ink or color, are really regular, although the
irregularities are so minute as not to be perceptible without the
assistance of the microscope. Men have (as is usual in new and wonderful
discoveries) added a superstitious remark, that the microscope sheds a
lustre on the works of nature, and dishonor on those of art, which only
means that the tissue of nature is much more delicate than that of art.
For the microscope is only of use for minute objects, and Democritus,
perhaps, if he had seen it, would have exulted in the thought of a means
being discovered for seeing his atom, which he affirmed to be entirely
invisible. But the inadequacy of these microscopes, for the observation
of any but the most minute bodies, and even of those if parts of a
larger body, destroys their utility; for if the invention could be
extended to greater bodies, or the minute parts of greater bodies, so
that a piece of cloth would appear like a net, and the latent minutiæ
and irregularities of gems, liquids, urine, blood, wounds, and many
other things could be rendered visible, the greatest advantage would,
without doubt, be derived.</p>
<p>We have an instance of the second kind in the telescope, discovered
by the wonderful exertions of Galileo; by the assistance of which a
nearer intercourse may be opened (as by boats or vessels) between
ourselves and the heavenly objects. For by its aid we are assured that
the Milky Way is but a knot or constellation of small stars, clearly
defined and separate, which the ancients only conjectured to be the
case; whence it appears to be capable of demonstration, that the spaces
of the planetary orbits (as they are termed) are not quite destitute of
other stars, but that the heaven begins to glitter with stars before we
arrive at the starry sphere, although they may be too small to be
visible without the telescope. By the telescope, also, we can behold the
revolutions of smaller stars round Jupiter, whence it may be conjectured
that there are several centres of motion among the stars. By its
assistance, also, the irregularity of light and shade on the moon’s
surface is more clearly observed and determined, so as to allow of a
sort of selenography.136 By the telescope we see the spots in the sun,
and other similar phenomena; all of which are most noble discoveries, as
far as credit can be safely given to demonstrations of this nature,
which are on this account very suspicious, namely, that experiment stops
at these few, and nothing further has yet been discovered by the same
method, among objects equally worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>We have instances of the third kind in measuring-rods, astrolabes,
and the like, which do not enlarge, but correct and guide the sight. If
there be other instances which assist the other senses in their
immediate and individual action, yet if they add nothing further to
their information they are not apposite to our present purpose, and we
have therefore said nothing of them.</p>
<ol start="40" type="I">
<li>In the seventeenth rank of prerogative instances we will place
citing instances (to borrow a term from the tribunals), because they
cite those things to appear, which have not yet appeared. We are wont
also to call them invoking instances, and their property is that of
reducing to the sphere of the senses objects which do not immediately
fall within it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Objects escape the senses either from their distance, or the
intervention of other bodies, or because they are not calculated to make
an impression upon the senses, or because they are not in sufficient
quantity to strike the senses, or because there is not sufficient time
for their acting upon the senses, or because the impression is too
violent, or because the senses are previously filled and possessed by
the object, so as to leave no room for any new motion. These remarks
apply principally to sight, and next to touch, which two senses act
extensively in giving information, and that too upon general objects,
while the remaining three inform us only, as it were, by their immediate
action, and as to specific objects.</p>
<p>There can be no reduction to the sphere of the senses in the first
case, unless in the place of the object, which cannot be perceived on
account of the distance, there be added or substituted some other
object, which can excite and strike the sense from a greater distance,
as in the communication of intelligence by fires, bells, and the
like.</p>
<p>In the second case we effect this reduction by rendering those things
which are concealed by the interposition of other bodies, and which
cannot easily be laid open, evident to the senses by means of that which
lies at the surface, or proceeds from the interior; thus the state of
the body is judged of by the pulse, urine, etc.</p>
<p>The third and fourth cases apply to many subjects, and the reduction
to the sphere of the senses must be obtained from every quarter in the
investigation of things. There are many examples. It is obvious that
air, and spirit, and the like, whose whole substance is extremely rare
and delicate, can neither be seen nor touched — a reduction, therefore,
to the senses becomes necessary in every investigation relating to such
bodies.</p>
<p>Let the required nature, therefore, be the action and motion of the
spirit inclosed in tangible bodies; for every tangible body with which
we are acquainted contains an invisible and intangible spirit, over
which it is drawn, and which it seems to clothe. This spirit being
emitted from a tangible substance, leaves the body contracted and dry;
when retained, it softens and melts it; when neither wholly emitted nor
retained, it models it, endows it with limbs, assimilates, manifests,
organizes it, and the like. All these points are reduced to the sphere
of the senses by manifest effects.</p>
<p>For in every tangible and inanimate body the inclosed spirit at first
increases, and as it were feeds on the tangible parts which are most
open and prepared for it; and when it has digested and modified them,
and turned them into spirit, it escapes with them. This formation and
increase of spirit is rendered sensible by the diminution of weight; for
in every desiccation something is lost in quantity, not only of the
spirit previously existing in the body, but of the body itself, which
was previously tangible, and has been recently changed, for the spirit
itself has no weight. The departure or emission of spirit is rendered
sensible in the rust of metals, and other putrefactions of a like
nature, which stop before they arrive at the rudiments of life, which
belong to the third species of process.137 In compact bodies the spirit
does not find pores and passages for its escape, and is therefore
obliged to force out, and drive before it, the tangible parts also,
which consequently protrude, whence arises rust and the like. The
contraction of the tangible parts, occasioned by the emission of part of
the spirit (whence arises desiccation), is rendered sensible by the
increased hardness of the substance, and still more by the fissures,
contractions, shrivelling, and folds of the bodies thus produced. For
the parts of wood split and contract, skins become shrivelled, and not
only that, but, if the spirit be emitted suddenly by the heat of the
fire, become so hastily contracted as to twist and roll themselves
up.</p>
<p>On the contrary, when the spirit is retained, and yet expanded and
excited by heat or the like (which happens in solid and tenacious
bodies), then the bodies are softened, as in hot iron; or flow, as in
metals; or melt, as in gums, wax, and the like. The contrary effects of
heat, therefore (hardening some substances and melting others), are
easily reconciled,138 because the spirit is emitted in the former, and
agitated and retained in the latter; the latter action is that of heat
and the spirit, the former that of the tangible parts themselves, after
the spirit’s emission.</p>
<p>But when the spirit is neither entirely retained nor emitted, but
only strives and exercises itself, within its limits, and meets with
tangible parts, which obey and readily follow it wherever it leads them,
then follows the formation of an organic body, and of limbs, and the
other vital actions of vegetables and animals. These are rendered
sensible chiefly by diligent observation of the first beginnings, and
rudiments or effects of life in animalculæ sprung from putrefaction, as
in the eggs of ants, worms, mosses, frogs after rain, etc. Both a mild
heat and a pliant substance, however, are necessary for the production
of life, in order that the spirit may neither hastily escape, nor be
restrained by the obstinacy of the parts, so as not to be able to bend
and model them like wax.</p>
<p>Again, the difference of spirit which is important and of effect in
many points (as unconnected spirit, branching spirit, branching and
cellular spirit, the first of which is that of all inanimate substances,
the second of vegetables, and the third of animals), is placed, as it
were, before the eyes by many reducing instances.</p>
<p>Again, it is clear that the more refined tissue and conformation of
things (though forming the whole body of visible or tangible objects)
are neither visible nor tangible. Our information, therefore, must here
also be derived from reduction to the sphere of the senses. But the most
radical and primary difference of formation depends on the abundance or
scarcity of matter within the same space or dimensions. For the other
formations which regard the dissimilarity of the parts contained in the
same body, and their collocation and position, are secondary in
comparison with the former.</p>
<p>Let the required nature then be the expansion or coherence of matter
in different bodies, or the quantity of matter relative to the
dimensions of each. For there is nothing in nature more true than the
twofold proposition — that nothing proceeds from nothing and that
nothing is reduced to nothing, but that the quantum, or sum total of
matter, is constant, and is neither increased nor diminished. Nor is it
less true, that out of this given quantity of matter, there is a greater
or less quantity, contained within the same space or dimensions
according to the difference of bodies; as, for instance, water contains
more than air. So that if any one were to assert that a given content of
water can be changed into an equal content of air, it is the same as if
he were to assert that something can be reduced into nothing. On the
contrary, if any one were to assert that a given content of air can be
changed into an equal content of water, it is the same as if he were to
assert that something can proceed from nothing. From this abundance or
scarcity of matter are properly derived the notions of density and
rarity, which are taken in various and promiscuous senses.</p>
<p>This third assertion may be considered as being also sufficiently
certain; namely, that the greater or less quantity of matter in this or
that body, may, by comparison, be reduced to calculation, and exact, or
nearly exact, proportion. Thus, if one should say that there is such an
accumulation of matter in a given quantity of gold, that it would
require twenty-one times the quantity in dimension of spirits of wine,
to make up the same quantity of matter, it would not be far from the
truth.</p>
<p>The accumulation of matter, however, and its relative quantity, are
rendered sensible by weight; for weight is proportionate to the quantity
of matter, as regards the parts of a tangible substance, but spirit and
its quantity of matter are not to be computed by weight, which spirit
rather diminishes than augments.</p>
<p>We have made a tolerably accurate table of weight, in which we have
selected the weights and size of all the metals, the principal minerals,
stones, liquids, oils, and many other natural and artificial bodies: a
very useful proceeding both as regards theory and practice, and which is
capable of revealing many unexpected results. Nor is this of little
consequence, that it serves to demonstrate that the whole range of the
variety of tangible bodies with which we are acquainted (we mean
tolerably close, and not spongy, hollow bodies, which are for a
considerable part filled with air), does not exceed the ratio of one to
twenty-one. So limited is nature, or at least that part of it to which
we are most habituated.</p>
<p>We have also thought it deserving our industry, to try if we could
arrive at the ratio of intangible or pneumatic bodies to tangible
bodies, which we attempted by the following contrivance. We took a vial
capable of containing about an ounce, using a small vessel in order to
effect the subsequent evaporation with less heat. We filled this vial,
almost to the neck, with spirits of wine, selecting it as the tangible
body which, by our table, was the rarest, and contained a less quantity
of matter in a given space than all other tangible bodies which are
compact and not hollow. Then we noted exactly the weight of the liquid
and vial. We next took a bladder, containing about two pints, and
squeezed all the air out of it, as completely as possible, and until the
sides of the bladder met. We first, however, rubbed the bladder gently
with oil, so as to make it air-tight, by closing its pores with the oil.
We tied the bladder tightly round the mouth of the vial, which we had
inserted in it, and with a piece of waxed thread to make it fit better
and more tightly, and then placed the vial on some hot coals in a
brazier. The vapor or steam of the spirit, dilated and become aëriform
by the heat, gradually swelled out the bladder, and stretched it in
every direction like a sail. As soon as that was accomplished, we
removed the vial from the fire and placed it on a carpet, that it might
not be cracked by the cold; we also pricked the bladder immediately,
that the steam might not return to a liquid state by the cessation of
heat, and confound the proportions. We then removed the bladder, and
again took the weight of the spirit which remained; and so calculated
the quantity which had been converted into vapor, or an aëriform shape,
and then examined how much space had been occupied by the body in its
form of spirits of wine in the vial, and how much, on the other hand,
had been occupied by it in its aëriform shape in the bladder, and
subtracted the results; from which it was clear that the body, thus
converted and changed, acquired an expansion of one hundred times beyond
its former bulk.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be heat or cold, of such a degree as
not to be sensible from its weakness. They are rendered sensible by the
thermometer, as we described it above;139 for the cold and heat are not
actually perceived by the touch, but heat expands and cold contracts the
air. Nor, again, is that expansion or contraction of the air in itself
visible, but the air when expanded depresses the water, and when
contracted raises it, which is the first reduction to sight.</p>
<p>Again, let the required nature be the mixture of bodies; namely, how
much aqueous, oleaginous or spirituous, ashy or salt parts they contain;
or, as a particular example, how much butter, cheese, and whey there is
in milk, and the like. These things are rendered sensible by artificial
and skilful separations in tangible substances; and the nature of the
spirit in them, though not immediately perceptible, is nevertheless
discovered by the various motions and efforts of bodies. And, indeed, in
this branch men have labored hard in distillations and artificial
separations, but with little more success than in their other
experiments now in use; their methods being mere guesses and blind
attempts, and more industrious than intelligent; and what is worst of
all, without any imitation or rivalry of nature, but rather by violent
heats and too energetic agents, to the destruction of any delicate
conformation, in which principally consist the hidden virtues and
sympathies. Nor do men in these separations ever attend to or observe
what we have before pointed out; namely, that in attacking bodies by
fire, or other methods, many qualities are superinduced by the fire
itself, and the other bodies used to effect the separation, which were
not originally in the compound. Hence arise most extraordinary
fallacies; for the mass of vapor which is emitted from water by fire,
for instance, did not exist as vapor or air in the water, but is chiefly
created by the expansion of the water by the heat of the fire.</p>
<p>So, in general, all delicate experiments on natural or artificial
bodies, by which the genuine are distinguished from the adulterated, and
the better from the more common, should be referred to this division;
for they bring that which is not the object of the senses within their
sphere. They are therefore to be everywhere diligently sought after.</p>
<p>With regard to the fifth cause of objects escaping our senses, it is
clear that the action of the sense takes place by motion, and this
motion is time. If, therefore, the motion of any body be either so slow
or so swift as not to be proportioned to the necessary momentum which
operates on the senses, the object is not perceived at all; as in the
motion of the hour hand, and that, again, of a musket-ball. The motion
which is imperceptible by the senses from its slowness, is readily and
usually rendered sensible by the accumulation of motion; that which is
imperceptible from its velocity, has not as yet been well measured; it
is necessary, however, that this should be done in some cases, with a
view to a proper investigation of nature.</p>
<p>The sixth case, where the sense is impeded by the power of the
object, admits of a reduction to the sensible sphere, either by removing
the object to a greater distance, or by deadening its effects by the
interposition of a medium, which may weaken and not destroy the object;
or by the admission of its reflection where the direct impression is too
strong, as that of the sun in a basin of water.</p>
<p>The seventh case, where the senses are so overcharged with the object
as to leave no further room, scarcely occurs except in the smell or
taste, and is not of much consequence as regards our present subject.
Let what we have said, therefore, suffice with regard to the reduction
to the sensible sphere of objects not naturally within its compass.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, this reduction is not extended to the senses of
man, but to those of some other animal, whose senses, in some points,
exceed those of man; as (with regard to some scents) to that of the dog,
and with regard to light existing imperceptibly in the air, when not
illuminated from any extraneous source, to the sense of the cat, the
owl, and other animals which see by night. For Telesius has well
observed, that there appears to be an original portion of light even in
the air itself,140 although but slight and meagre, and of no use for the
most part to the eyes of men, and those of the generality of animals;
because those animals to whose senses this light is proportioned can see
by night, which does not, in all probability, proceed from their seeing
either without light or by any internal light.</p>
<p>Here, too, we would observe, that we at present discuss only the
wants of the senses, and their remedies; for their deceptions must be
referred to the inquiries appropriated to the senses, and sensible
objects; except that important deception, which makes them define
objects in their relation to man, and not in their relation to the
universe, and which is only corrected by universal reasoning and
philosophy.141</p>
<ol start="41" type="I">
<li>In the eighteenth rank of prerogative instances we will class the
instances of the road, which we are also wont to call itinerant and
jointed instances. They are such as indicate the gradually continued
motions of nature. This species of instances escapes rather our
observation than our senses; for men are wonderfully indolent upon this
subject, consulting nature in a desultory manner, and at periodic
intervals, when bodies have been regularly finished and completed, and
not during her work. But if any one were desirous of examining and
contemplating the talents and industry of an artificer, he would not
merely wish to see the rude materials of his art, and then his work when
finished, but rather to be present while he is at labor, and proceeding
with his work. Something of the same kind should be done with regard to
nature. For instance, if any one investigate the vegetation of plants,
he should observe from the first sowing of any seed (which can easily be
done, by pulling up every day seeds which have been two, three, or four
days in the ground, and examining them diligently), how and when the
seed begins to swell and break, and be filled, as it were, with spirit;
then how it begins to burst the bark and push out fibres, raising itself
a little at the same time, unless the ground be very stiff; then how it
pushes out these fibres, some downward for roots, others upward for the
stem, sometimes also creeping laterally, if it find the earth open and
more yielding on one side, and the like. The same should be done in
observing the hatching of eggs, where we may easily see the process of
animation and organization, and what parts are formed of the yolk, and
what of the white of the egg, and the like. The same may be said of the
inquiry into the formation of animals from putrefaction; for it would
not be so humane to inquire into perfect and terrestrial animals, by
cutting the fœtus from the womb; but opportunities may perhaps be
offered of abortions, animals killed in hunting, and the like. Nature,
therefore, must, as it were, be watched, as being more easily observed
by night than by day: for contemplations of this kind may be considered
as carried on by night, from the minuteness and perpetual burning of our
watch-light.</li>
</ol>
<p>The same must be attempted with inanimate objects, which we have
ourselves done by inquiring into the opening of liquids by fire. For the
mode in which water expands is different from that observed in wine,
vinegar, or verjuice, and very different, again, from that observed in
milk and oil, and the like; and this was easily seen by boiling them
with slow heat, in a glass vessel, through which the whole may be
clearly perceived. But we merely mention this, intending to treat of it
more at large and more closely when we come to the discovery of the
latent process; for it should always be remembered that we do not here
treat of things themselves, but merely propose examples.142</p>
<ol start="42" type="I">
<li>In the nineteenth rank of prerogative instances we will class
supplementary or substitutive instances, which we are also wont to call
instances of refuge. They are such as supply information, where the
senses are entirely deficient, and we therefore have recourse to them
when appropriate instances cannot be obtained. This substitution is
twofold, either by approximation or by analogy. For instance, there is
no known medium which entirely prevents the effect of the magnet in
attracting iron — neither gold, nor silver, nor stone, nor glass, wood,
water, oil, cloth, or fibrous bodies, air, flame, or the like. Yet by
accurate experiment, a medium may perhaps be found which would deaden
its effect, more than another comparatively and in degree; as, for
instance, the magnet would not perhaps attract iron through the same
thickness of gold as of air, or the same quantity of ignited as of cold
silver, and so on; for we have not ourselves made the experiment, but it
will suffice as an example. Again, there is no known body which is not
susceptible of heat, when brought near the fire; yet air becomes warm
much sooner than stone. These are examples of substitution by
approximation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Substitution by analogy is useful, but less sure, and therefore to be
adopted with some judgment. It serves to reduce that which is not the
object of the senses to their sphere, not by the perceptible operations
of the imperceptible body, but by the consideration of some similar
perceptible body. For instance, let the subject for inquiry be the
mixture of spirits, which are invisible bodies. There appears to be some
relation between bodies and their sources or support. Now, the source of
flame seems to be oil and fat; that of air, water, and watery
substances; for flame increases over the exhalation of oil, and air over
that of water. One must therefore consider the mixture of oil and water,
which is manifest to the senses, since that of air and flame in general
escapes the senses. But oil and water mix very imperfectly by
composition or stirring, while they are exactly and nicely mixed in
herbs, blood, and the parts of animals. Something similar, therefore,
may take place in the mixture of flame and air in spirituous substances,
not bearing mixture very well by simple collision, while they appear,
however, to be well mixed in the spirits of plants and animals.</p>
<p>Again, if the inquiry do not relate to perfect mixtures of spirits,
but merely to their composition, as whether they easily incorporate with
each other, or there be rather (as an example) certain winds and
exhalations, or other spiritual bodies, which do not mix with common
air, but only adhere to and float in it in globules and drops, and are
rather broken and pounded by the air, than received into, and
incorporated with it; this cannot be perceived in common air, and other
aëriform substances, on account of the rarity of the bodies, but an
image, as it were, of this process may be conceived in such liquids as
quicksilver, oil, water, and even air, when broken and dissipated it
ascends in small portions through water, and also in the thicker kinds
of smoke; lastly, in dust, raised and remaining in the air, in all of
which there is no incorporation: and the above representation in this
respect is not a bad one, if it be first diligently investigated,
whether there can be such a difference of nature between spirituous
substances, as between liquids, for then these images might conveniently
be substituted by analogy.</p>
<p>And although we have observed of these supplementary instances, that
information is to be derived from them, when appropriate instances are
wanting, by way of refuge, yet we would have it understood, that they
are also of great use, when the appropriate instances are at hand, in
order to confirm the information afforded by them; of which we will
speak more at length, when our subject leads us, in due course, to the
support of induction.</p>
<ol start="43" type="I">
<li>In the twentieth rank of prerogative instances we will place lancing
instances, which we are also wont (but for a different reason) to call
twitching instances. We adopt the latter name, because they twitch the
understanding, and the former because they pierce nature, whence we
style them occasionally the instances of Democritus.143 They are such as
warn the understanding of the admirable and exquisite subtilty of
nature, so that it becomes roused and awakened to attention,
observation, and proper inquiry; as, for instance, that a little drop of
ink should be drawn out into so many letters; that silver merely gilt on
its surface should be stretched to such a length of gilt wire; that a
little worm, such as you may find on the skin, should possess both a
spirit and a varied conformation of its parts; that a little saffron
should imbue a whole tub of water with its color; that a little musk or
aroma should imbue a much greater extent of air with its perfume; that a
cloud of smoke should be raised by a little incense; that such accurate
differences of sounds as articulate words should be conveyed in all
directions through the air, and even penetrate the pores of wood and
water (though they become much weakened), that they should be, moreover,
reflected, and that with such distinctness and velocity; that light and
color should for such an extent and so rapidly pass through solid
bodies, such as glass and water, with so great and so exquisite a
variety of images, and should be refracted and reflected; that the
magnet should attract through every description of body, even the most
compact; but (what is still more wonderful) that in all these cases the
action of one should not impede that of another in a common medium, such
as air; and that there should be borne through the air, at the same
time, so many images of visible objects, so many impulses of
articulation, so many different perfumes, as of the violet, rose, etc.,
besides cold and heat, and magnetic attractions; all of them, I say, at
once, without any impediment from each other, as if each had its paths
and peculiar passage set apart for it, without infringing against or
meeting each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>To these lancing instances, however, we are wont, not without some
advantage, to add those which we call the limits of such instances.
Thus, in the cases we have pointed out, one action does not disturb or
impede another of a different nature, yet those of a similar nature
subdue and extinguish each other; as the light of the sun does that of
the candle, the sound of a cannon that of the voice, a strong perfume a
more delicate one, a powerful heat a more gentle one, a plate of iron
between the magnet and other iron the effect of the magnet. But the
proper place for mentioning these will be also among the supports of
induction.</p>
<ol start="44" type="I">
<li>We have now spoken of the instances which assist the senses, and
which are principally of service as regards information; for information
begins from the senses. But our whole labor terminates in practice, and
as the former is the beginning, so is the latter the end of our subject.
The following instances, therefore, will be those which are chiefly
useful in practice. They are comprehended in two classes, and are seven
in number. We call them all by the general name of practical instances.
Now there are two defects in practice, and as many divisions of
important instances. Practice is either deceptive or too laborious. It
is generally deceptive (especially after a diligent examination of
natures), on account of the power and actions of bodies being ill
defined and determined. Now the powers and actions of bodies are defined
and determined either by space or by time, or by the quantity at a given
period, or by the predominance of energy; and if these four
circumstances be not well and diligently considered, the sciences may
indeed be beautiful in theory, but are of no effect in practice. We call
the four instances referred to this class, mathematical instances and
instances of measure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Practice is laborious either from the multitude of instruments, or
the bulk of matter and substances requisite for any given work. Those
instances, therefore, are valuable, which either direct practice to that
which is of most consequence to mankind, or lessen the number of
instruments or of matter to be worked upon. We assign to the three
instances relating to this class, the common name of propitious or
benevolent instances. We will now separately discuss these seven
instances, and conclude with them that part of our work which relates to
the prerogative or illustrious instances.</p>
<ol start="45" type="I">
<li>In the twenty-first rank of prerogative instances we will place the
instances of the rod or rule, which we are also wont to call the
instances of completion or non ultrà. For the powers and motions of
bodies do not act and take effect through indefinite and accidental, but
through limited and certain spaces; and it is of great importance to
practice that these should be understood and noted in every nature which
is investigated, not only to prevent deception, but to render practice
more extensive and efficient. For it is sometimes possible to extend
these powers, and bring the distance, as it were, nearer, as in the
example of telescopes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many powers act and take effect only by actual touch, as in the
percussion of bodies, where the one does not remove the other, unless
the impelling touch the impelled body. External applications in
medicine, as ointment and plasters, do not exercise their efficacy
except when in contact with the body. Lastly, the objects of touch and
taste only strike those senses when in contact with their organs.</p>
<p>Other powers act at a distance, though it be very small, of which but
few have as yet been noted, although there be more than men suspect;
this happens (to take everyday instances) when amber or jet attracts
straws, bubbles dissolve bubbles, some purgative medicines draw humors
from above, and the like. The magnetic power by which iron and the
magnet, or two magnets, are attracted together, acts within a definite
and narrow sphere, but if there be any magnetic power emanating from the
earth a little below its surface, and affecting the needle in its
polarity, it must act at a great distance.</p>
<p>Again, if there be any magnetic force which acts by sympathy between
the globe of the earth and heavy bodies, or between that of the moon and
the waters of the sea (as seems most probable from the particular floods
and ebbs which occur twice in the month), or between the starry sphere
and the planets, by which they are summoned and raised to their apogees,
these must all operate at very great distances.144</p>
<p>Again, some conflagrations and the kindling of flames take place at
very considerable distances with particular substances, as they report
of the naphtha of Babylon. Heat, too, insinuates itself at wide
distances, as does also cold, so that the masses of ice which are broken
off and float upon the Northern Ocean, and are borne through the
Atlantic to the coast of Canada, become perceptible by the inhabitants,
and strike them with cold from a distance. Perfumes also (though here
there appears to be always some corporeal emission) act at remarkable
distances, as is experienced by persons sailing by the coast of Florida,
or parts of Spain, where there are whole woods of lemons, oranges, and
other odoriferous plants, or rosemary and marjoram bushes, and the like.
Lastly, the rays of light and the impressions of sound act at extensive
distances.</p>
<p>Yet all these powers, whether acting at a small or great distance,
certainly act within definite distances, which are well ascertained by
nature, so that there is a limit depending either on the mass or
quantity of the bodies, the vigor or faintness of the powers, or the
favorable or impeding nature of the medium, all of which should be taken
into account and observed. We must also note the boundaries of violent
motions, such as missiles, projectiles, wheels and the like, since they
are also manifestly confined to certain limits.</p>
<p>Some motions and virtues are to be found of a directly contrary
nature to these, which act in contact but not at a distance; namely,
such as operate at a distance and not in contact, and again act with
less force at a less distance, and the reverse. Sight, for instance, is
not easily effective in contact, but requires a medium and distance;
although I remember having heard from a person deserving of credit, that
in being cured of a cataract (which was done by putting a small silver
needle within the first coat of the eye, to remove the thin pellicle of
the cataract, and force it into a corner of the eye), he had distinctly
seen the needle moving across the pupil. Still, though this may be true,
it is clear that large bodies cannot be seen well or distinctly, unless
at the vertex of a cone, where the rays from the object meet at some
distance from the eye. In old persons the eye sees better if the object
be moved a little further, and not nearer. Again, it is certain that in
projectiles the impact is not so violent at too short a distance as a
little afterward.145 Such are the observations to be made on the measure
of motions as regards distance.</p>
<p>There is another measure of motion in space which must not be passed
over, not relating to progressive but spherical motion — that is, the
expansion of bodies into a greater, or their contraction into a lesser
sphere. For in our measure of this motion we must inquire what degree of
compression or extension bodies easily and readily admit of, according
to their nature, and at what point they begin to resist it, so as at
last to bear it no further — as when an inflated bladder is compressed,
it allows a certain compression of the air, but if this be increased,
the air does not suffer it, and the bladder is burst.</p>
<p>We have proved this by a more delicate experiment. We took a metal
bell, of a light and thin sort, such as is used for salt-cellars, and
immersed it in a basin of water, so as to carry the air contained in its
interior down with it to the bottom of the basin. We had first, however,
placed a small globe at the bottom of the basin, over which we placed
the bell. The result was, that if the globe were small compared with the
interior of the bell, the air would contract itself, and be compressed
without being forced out, but if it were too large for the air readily
to yield to it, the latter became impatient of the pressure, raised the
bell partly up, and ascended in bubbles.</p>
<p>To prove, also, the extension (as well as the compression) which air
admits of, we adopted the following method: — We took a glass egg, with
a small hole at one end; we drew out the air by violent suction at this
hole, and then closed the hole with the finger, immersed the egg in
water, and then removed the finger. The air being constrained by the
effort made in suction, and dilated beyond its natural state, and
therefore striving to recover and contract itself (so that if the egg
had not been immersed in water, it would have drawn in the air with a
hissing sound), now drew in a sufficient quantity of water to allow the
air to recover its former dimensions.146</p>
<p>It is well ascertained that rare bodies (such as air) admit of
considerable contraction, as has been before observed; but tangible
bodies (such as water) admit of it much less readily, and to a less
extent. We investigated the latter point by the following
experiment:</p>
<p>We had a leaden globe made, capable of containing about two pints,
wine measure, and of tolerable thickness, so as to support considerable
pressure. We poured water into it through an aperture, which we
afterward closed with melted lead, as soon as the globe was filled with
water, so that the whole became perfectly solid. We next flattened the
two opposite sides with a heavy hammer, which necessarily caused the
water to occupy a less space, since the sphere is the solid of greatest
content; and when hammering failed from the resistance of the water, we
made use of a mill or press, till at last the water, refusing to submit
to a greater pressure, exuded like a fine dew through the solid lead. We
then computed the extent to which the original space had been reduced,
and concluded that water admitted such a degree of compression when
constrained by great violence.</p>
<p>The more solid, dry or compact bodies, such as stones, wood and
metals, admit of much less, and indeed scarcely any perceptible
compression or expansion, but escape by breaking, slipping forward, or
other efforts; as appears in bending wood, or steel for watch-springs,
in projectiles, hammering and many other motions, all of which, together
with their degrees, are to be observed and examined in the investigation
of nature, either to a certainty, or by estimation, or comparison, as
opportunity permits.</p>
<ol start="46" type="I">
<li>In the twenty-second rank of prerogative instances we will place the
instances of the course, which we are also wont to call water instances,
borrowing our expression from the water hour-glasses employed by the
ancients instead of those with sand. They are such as measure nature by
the moments of time, as the last instances do by the degrees of space.
For all motion or natural action takes place in time, more or less
rapidly, but still in determined moments well ascertained by nature.
Even those actions which appear to take effect suddenly, and in the
twinkling of an eye (as we express it), are found to admit of greater or
less rapidity.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first place, then, we see that the return of the heavenly
bodies to the same place takes place in regular times, as does the flood
and ebb of the sea. The descent of heavy bodies toward the earth, and
the ascent of light bodies toward the heavenly sphere, take place in
definite times,147 according to the nature of the body, and of the
medium through which it moves. The sailing of ships, the motions of
animals, the transmission of projectiles, all take place in times the
sums of which can be computed. With regard to heat, we see that boys in
winter bathe their hands in the flame without being burned; and
conjurers, by quick and regular movements, overturn vessels filled with
wine or water, and replace them without spilling the liquid, with
several similar instances. The compression, expansion and eruption of
several bodies, take place more or less rapidly, according to the nature
of the body and its motion, but still in definite moments.</p>
<p>In the explosion of several cannon at once (which are sometimes heard
at the distance of thirty miles), the sound of those nearest to the spot
is heard before that of the most distant. Even in sight (whose action is
most rapid), it is clear that a definite time is necessary for its
exertion, which is proved by certain objects being invisible from the
velocity of their motion, such as a musket-ball; for the flight of the
ball is too swift to allow an impression of its figure to be conveyed to
the sight.</p>
<p>This last instance, and others of a like nature, have sometimes
excited in us a most marvellous doubt, no less than whether the image of
the sky and stars is perceived as at the actual moment of its existence,
or rather a little after, and whether there is not (with regard to the
visible appearance of the heavenly bodies) a true and apparent time, as
well as a true and apparent place, which is observed by astronomers in
parallaxes. It appeared so incredible to us, that the images or
radiations of heavenly bodies could suddenly be conveyed through such
immense spaces to the sight, and it seemed that they ought rather to be
transmitted in a definite time.148 That doubt, however (as far as
regards any great difference between the true and apparent time), was
subsequently completely set at rest, when we considered the infinite
loss and diminution of size as regards the real and apparent magnitude
of a star, occasioned by its distance, and at the same time observed at
how great a distance (at least sixty miles) bodies which are merely
white can be suddenly seen by us. For there is no doubt, that the light
of the heavenly bodies not only far surpasses the vivid appearance of
white, but even the light of any flame (with which we are acquainted) in
the vigor of its radiation. The immense velocity of the bodies
themselves, which is perceived in their diurnal motion, and has so
astonished thinking men, that they have been more ready to believe in
the motion of the earth, renders the motion of radiation from them
(marvellous as it is in its rapidity) more worthy of belief. That which
has weighed most with us, however, is, that if there were any
considerable interval of time between the reality and the appearance,
the images would often be interrupted and confused by clouds formed in
the meantime, and similar disturbances of the medium. Let this suffice
with regard to the simple measures of time.</p>
<p>It is not merely the absolute, but still more the relative measure of
motions and actions which must be inquired into, for this latter is of
great use and application. We perceive that the flame of firearms is
seen sooner than the sound is heard, although the ball must have struck
the air before the flame, which was behind it, could escape: the reason
of which is, that light moves with greater velocity than sound. We
perceive, also, that visible images are received by the sight with
greater rapidity than they are dismissed, and for this reason, a violin
string touched with the finger appears double or triple, because the new
image is received before the former one is dismissed. Hence, also, rings
when spinning appear globular, and a lighted torch, borne rapidly along
at night, appears to have a tail. Upon the principle of the inequality
of motion, also, Galileo attempted an explanation of the flood and ebb
of the sea, supposing the earth to move rapidly, and the water slowly,
by which means the water, after accumulating, would at intervals fall
back, as is shown in a vessel of water made to move rapidly. He has,
however, imagined this on data which cannot be granted (namely, the
earth’s motion), and besides, does not satisfactorily account for the
tide taking place every six hours.</p>
<p>An example of our present point (the relative measure of motion),
and, at the same time, of its remarkable use of which we have spoken, is
conspicuous in mines filled with gunpowder, where immense weights of
earth, buildings, and the like, are overthrown and prostrated by a small
quantity of powder; the reason of which is decidedly this, that the
motion of the expansion of the gunpowder is much more rapid than that of
gravity,149 which would resist it, so that the former has terminated
before the latter has commenced. Hence, also, in missiles, a strong blow
will not carry them so far as a sharp and rapid one. Nor could a small
portion of animal spirit in animals, especially in such vast bodies as
those of the whale and elephant, have ever bent or directed such a mass
of body, were it not owing to the velocity of the former, and the
slowness of the latter in resisting its motion.</p>
<p>In short, this point is one of the principal foundations of the magic
experiments (of which we shall presently speak), where a small mass of
matter overcomes and regulates a much larger, if there but be an
anticipation of motion, by the velocity of one before the other is
prepared to act.</p>
<p>Finally, the point of the first and last should be observed in all
natural actions. Thus, in an infusion of rhubarb the purgative property
is first extracted, and then the astringent; we have experienced
something of the same kind in steeping violets in vinegar, which first
extracts the sweet and delicate odor of the flower, and then the more
earthy part, which disturbs the perfume; so that if the violets be
steeped a whole day, a much fainter perfume is extracted than if they
were steeped for a quarter of an hour only, and then taken out; and
since the odoriferous spirit in the violet is not abundant, let other
and fresh violets be steeped in the vinegar every quarter of an hour, as
many as six times, when the infusion becomes so strengthened, that
although the violets have not altogether remained there for more than
one hour and a half, there remains a most pleasing perfume, not inferior
to the flower itself, for a whole year. It must be observed, however,
that the perfume does not acquire its full strength till about a month
after the infusion. In the distillation of aromatic plants macerated in
spirits of wine, it is well known that an aqueous and useless phlegm
rises first, then water containing more of the spirit, and, lastly,
water containing more of the aroma; and many observations of the like
kind, well worthy of notice, are to be made in distillations. But let
these suffice as examples.150</p>
<ol start="47" type="I">
<li>In the twenty-third rank of prerogative instances we will place
instances of quantity, which we are also wont to call the doses of
nature (borrowing a word from medicine). They are such as measure the
powers by the quantity of bodies, and point out the effect of the
quantity in the degree of power. And in the first place, some powers
only subsist in the universal quantity, or such as bears a relation to
the confirmation and fabric of the universe. Thus the earth is fixed,
its parts fall. The waters in the sea flow and ebb, but not in the
rivers, except by the admission of the sea. Then, again, almost all
particular powers act according to the greater or less quantity of the
body. Large masses of water are not easily rendered foul, small are. New
wine and beer become ripe and drinkable in small skins much more readily
than in large casks. If a herb be placed in a considerable quantity of
liquid, infusion takes place rather than impregnation; if in less, the
reverse. A bath, therefore, and a light sprinkling, produce different
effects on the human body. Light dew, again, never falls, but is
dissipated and incorporated with the air; thus we see that in breathing
on gems, the slight quantity of moisture, like a small cloud in the air,
is immediately dissolved. Again, a piece of the same magnet does not
attract so much iron as the whole magnet did. There are some powers
where the smallness of the quantity is of more avail; as in boring, a
sharp point pierces more readily than a blunt one; the diamond, when
pointed, makes an impression on glass, and the like.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, too, we must not rest contented with a vague result, but
inquire into the exact proportion of quantity requisite for a particular
exertion of power; for one would be apt to suppose that the power bears
an exact proportion to the quantity; that if a leaden bullet of one
ounce, for instance, would fall in a given time, one of two ounces ought
to fall twice as rapidly, which is most erroneous. Nor does the same
ratio prevail in every kind of power, their difference being
considerable. The measure, therefore, must be determined by experiment,
and not by probability or conjecture.</p>
<p>Lastly, we must in all our investigations of nature observe what
quantity, or dose, of the body is requisite for a given effect, and must
at the same time be guarded against estimating it at too much or too
little.</p>
<ol start="48" type="I">
<li>In the twenty-fourth rank of prerogative instances we will place
wrestling instances, which we are also wont to call instances of
predominance. They are such as point out the predominance and submission
of powers compared with each other, and which of them is the more
energetic and superior, or more weak and inferior. For the motions and
effects of bodies are compounded, decomposed, and combined, no less than
the bodies themselves. We will exhibit, therefore, the principal kinds
of motions or active powers, in order that their comparative strength,
and thence a demonstration and definition of the instances in question,
may be rendered more clear.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let the first motion be that of the resistance of matter, which
exists in every particle, and completely prevents its annihilation; so
that no conflagration, weight, pressure, violence, or length of time can
reduce even the smallest portion of matter to nothing, or prevent it
from being something, and occupying some space, and delivering itself
(whatever straits it be put to), by changing its form or place, or, if
that be impossible, remaining as it is; nor can it ever happen that it
should either be nothing or nowhere. This motion is designated by the
schools (which generally name and define everything by its effects and
inconveniences rather than by its inherent cause) by the axiom, that two
bodies cannot exist in the same place, or they call it a motion to
prevent the penetration of dimensions. It is useless to give examples of
this motion, since it exists in every body.</p>
<p>Let the second motion be that which we term the motion of connection,
by which bodies do not allow themselves to be separated at any point
from the contact of another body, delighting, as it were, in the mutual
connection and contact. This is called by the schools a motion to
prevent a vacuum. It takes place when water is drawn up by suction or a
syringe, the flesh by cupping, or when the water remains without
escaping from perforated jars, unless the mouth be opened to admit the
air, and innumerable instances of a like nature.</p>
<p>Let the third be that which we term the motion of liberty, by which
bodies strive to deliver themselves from any unnatural pressure or
tension, and to restore themselves to the dimensions suited to their
mass; and of which, also, there are innumerable examples. Thus, we have
examples of their escaping from pressure, in the water in swimming, in
the air in flying, in the water again in rowing, and in the air in the
undulation of the winds, and in springs of watches. An exact instance of
the motion of compressed air is seen in children’s popguns, which they
make by scooping out elder-branches or some such matter, and forcing in
a piece of some pulpy root or the like, at each end; then they force the
root or other pellet with a ramrod to the opposite end, from which the
lower pellet is emitted and projected with a report, and that before it
is touched by the other piece of root or pellet, or by the ramrod. We
have examples of their escape from tension, in the motion of the air
that remains in glass eggs after suction, in strings, leather, and
cloth, which recoil after tension, unless it be long continued. The
schools define this by the term of motion from the form of the element;
injudiciously enough, since this motion is to be found not only in air,
water, or fire, but in every species of solid, as wood, iron, lead,
cloth, parchment, etc., each of which has its own proper size, and is
with difficulty stretched to any other. Since, however, this motion of
liberty is the most obvious of all, and to be seen in an infinite number
of cases, it will be as well to distinguish it correctly and clearly;
for some most carelessly confound this with the two others of resistance
and connection; namely, the freedom from pressure with the former, and
that from tension with the latter, as if bodies when compressed yielded
or expanded to prevent a penetration of dimensions, and when stretched
rebounded and contracted themselves to prevent a vacuum. But if the air,
when compressed, could be brought to the density of water, or wood to
that of stone, there would be no need of any penetration of dimensions,
and yet the compression would be much greater than they actually admit
of. So if water could be expanded till it became as rare as air, or
stone as rare as wood, there would be no need of a vacuum, and yet the
expansion would be much greater than they actually admit of.</p>
<p>We do not, therefore, arrive at a penetration of dimensions or a
vacuum before the extremes of condensation and rarefaction, while the
motion we speak of stops and exerts itself much within them, and is
nothing more than a desire of bodies to preserve their specific density
(or, if it be preferred, their form), and not to desert them suddenly,
but only to change by degrees, and of their own accord. It is, however,
much more necessary to intimate to mankind (because many other points
depend upon this), that the violent motion which we call mechanical, and
Democritus (who, in explaining his primary motions, is to be ranked even
below the middling class of philosophers) termed the motion of a blow,
is nothing else than this motion of liberty, namely, a tendency to
relaxation from compression. For in all simple impulsion or flight
through the air, the body is not displaced or moved in space, until its
parts are placed in an unnatural state, and compressed by the impelling
force. When that takes place, the different parts urging the other in
succession, the whole is moved, and that with a rotatory as well as
progressive motion, in order that the parts may, by this means also, set
themselves at liberty, or more readily submit. Let this suffice for the
motion in question.</p>
<p>Let the fourth be that which we term the motion of matter, and which
is opposed to the last; for in the motion of liberty, bodies abhor,
reject, and avoid, a new size or volume, or any new expansion or
contraction (for these different terms have the same meaning), and
strive, with all their power, to rebound and resume their former
density; on the contrary, in the motion of matter, they are anxious to
acquire a new volume or dimension, and attempt it willingly and rapidly,
and occasionally by a most vigorous effort, as in the example of
gunpowder. The most powerful, or at least most frequent, though not the
only instruments of this motion, are heat and cold. For instance, the
air, if expanded by tension (as by suction in the glass egg), struggles
anxiously to restore itself; but if heat be applied, it strives, on the
contrary, to dilate itself, and longs for a larger volume, regularly
passing and migrating into it, as into a new form (as it is termed); nor
after a certain degree of expansion is it anxious to return, unless it
be invited to do so by the application of cold, which is not indeed a
return, but a fresh change. So also water, when confined by compression,
resists, and wishes to become as it was before, namely, more expanded;
but if there happen an intense and continued cold, it changes itself
readily, and of its own accord, into the condensed state of ice; and if
the cold be long continued, without any intervening warmth (as in
grottoes and deep caves), it is changed into crystal or similar matter,
and never resumes its form.</p>
<p>Let the fifth be that which we term the motion of continuity. We do
not understand by this simple and primary continuity with any other body
(for that is the motion of connection), but the continuity of a
particular body in itself; for it is most certain that all bodies abhor
a solution of continuity, some more and some less, but all partially. In
hard bodies (such as steel and glass) the resistance to an interruption
of continuity is most powerful and efficacious, while although in
liquids it appears to be faint and languid, yet it is not altogether
null, but exists in the lowest degree, and shows itself in many
experiments, such as bubbles, the round form of drops, the thin threads
which drip from roofs, the cohesion of glutinous substances, and the
like. It is most conspicuous, however, if an attempt be made to push
this separation to still smaller particles. Thus, in mortars, the pestle
produces no effect after a certain degree of contusion, water does not
penetrate small fissures, and the air itself, notwithstanding its
subtilty, does not penetrate the pores of solid vessels at once, but
only by long-continued insinuation.</p>
<p>Let the sixth be that which we term the motion of acquisition, or the
motion of need.151 It is that by which bodies placed among others of a
heterogeneous and, as it were, hostile nature, if they meet with the
means or opportunity of avoiding them, and uniting themselves with
others of a more analogous nature, even when these latter are not
closely allied to them, immediately seize and, as it were, select them,
and appear to consider it as something acquired (whence we derive the
name), and to have need of these latter bodies. For instance, gold, or
any other metal in leaf, does not like the neighborhood of air; if,
therefore, they meet with any tangible and thick substance (such as the
finger, paper, or the like), they immediately adhere to it, and are not
easily torn from it. Paper, too, and cloth, and the like, do not agree
with the air, which is inherent and mixed in their pores. They readily,
therefore, imbibe water or other liquids, and get rid of the air. Sugar,
or a sponge, dipped in water or wine, and though part of it be out of
the water or wine, and at some height above it, will yet gradually
absorb them.152</p>
<p>Hence an excellent rule is derived for the opening and dissolution of
bodies; for (not to mention corrosive and strong waters, which force
their way) if a body can be found which is more adapted, suited, and
friendly to a given solid, than that with which it is by some necessity
united, the given solid immediately opens and dissolves itself to
receive the former, and excludes or removes the latter.153 Nor is the
effect or power of this motion confined to contact, for the electric
energy (of which Gilbert and others after him have told so many fables)
is only the energy excited in a body by gentle friction, and which does
not endure the air, but prefers some tangible substance if there be any
at hand.</p>
<p>Let the seventh be that which we term the motion of greater
congregation, by which bodies are borne toward masses of a similar
nature, for instance, heavy bodies toward the earth, light to the sphere
of heaven. The schools termed this natural motion, by a superficial
consideration of it, because produced by no external visible agent,
which made them consider it innate in the substances; or perhaps because
it does not cease, which is little to be wondered at, since heaven and
earth are always present, while the causes and sources of many other
motions are sometimes absent and sometimes present. They therefore
called this perpetual and proper, because it is never interrupted, but
instantly takes place when the others are interrupted, and they called
the others adscititious. The former, however, is in reality weak and
slow, since it yields, and is inferior to the others as long as they
act, unless the mass of the body be great; and although this motion have
so filled men’s minds, as almost to have obscured all others, yet they
know but little about it, and commit many errors in its estimate.</p>
<p>Let the eighth be that which we term the motion of lesser
congregation, by which the homogeneous parts in any body separate
themselves from the heterogeneous and unite together, and whole bodies
of a similar substance coalesce and tend toward each other, and are
sometimes congregated, attracted, and meet, from some distance; thus in
milk the cream rises after a certain time, and in wine the dregs and
tartar sink; which effects are not to be attributed to gravity and
levity only, so as to account for the rising of some parts and the
sinking of others, but much more to the desire of the homogeneous bodies
to meet and unite. This motion differs from that of need in two points:
1st, because the latter is the stimulus of a malignant and contrary
nature, while in this of which we treat (if there be no impediment or
restraint), the parts are united by their affinity, although there be no
foreign nature to create a struggle; 2dly, because the union is closer
and more select. For in the other motion, bodies which have no great
affinity unite, if they can but avoid the hostile body, while in this,
substances which are connected by a decided kindred resemblance come
together and are molded into one. It is a motion existing in all
compound bodies, and would be readily seen in each, if it were not
confined and checked by the other affections and necessities of bodies
which disturb the union.</p>
<p>This motion is usually confined in the three following manners: by
the torpor of the bodies; by the power of the predominating body; by
external motion. With regard to the first, it is certain that there is
more or less sluggishness in tangible bodies, and an abhorrence of
locomotion; so that unless excited they prefer remaining contented with
their actual state, to placing themselves in a better position. There
are three means of breaking through this sluggishness — heat; the active
power of a similar body; vivid and powerful motion. With regard to the
first, heat is, on this account, defined as that which separates
heterogeneous, and draws together homogeneous substances; a definition
of the Peripatetics which is justly ridiculed by Gilbert, who says it is
as if one were to define man to be that which sows wheat and plants
vineyards; being only a definition deduced from effects, and those but
partial. But it is still more to be blamed, because those effects, such
as they are, are not a peculiar property of heat, but a mere accident
(for cold, as we shall afterward show, does the same), arising from the
desire of the homogeneous parts to unite; the heat then assists them in
breaking through that sluggishness which before restrained their desire.
With regard to the assistance derived from the power of a similar body,
it is most conspicuous in the magnet when armed with steel, for it
excites in the steel a power of adhering to steel, as a homogeneous
substance, the power of the magnet breaking through the sluggishness of
the steel. With regard to the assistance of motion, it is seen in wooden
arrows or points, which penetrate more deeply into wood than if they
were tipped with iron, from the similarity of the substance, the
swiftness of the motion breaking through the sluggishness of the wood;
of which two last experiments we have spoken above in the aphorism on
clandestine instances.154</p>
<p>The confinement of the motion of lesser congregation, which arises
from the power of the predominant body, is shown in the decomposition of
blood and urine by cold. For as long as these substances are filled with
the active spirit, which regulates and restrains each of their component
parts, as the predominant ruler of the whole, the several different
parts do not collect themselves separately on account of the check; but
as soon as that spirit has evaporated, or has been choked by the cold,
then the decomposed parts unite, according to their natural desire.
Hence it happens, that all bodies which contain a sharp spirit (as salts
and the like), last without decomposition, owing to the permanent and
durable power of the predominating and imperious spirit.</p>
<p>The confinement of the motion of lesser congregation, which arises
from external motion, is very evident in that agitation of bodies which
preserves them from putrefaction. For all putrefaction depends on the
congregation of the homogeneous parts, whence, by degrees, there ensues
a corruption of the first form (as it is called), and the generation of
another. For the decomposition of the original form, which is itself the
union of the homogeneous parts, precedes the putrefaction, which
prepares the way for the generation of another. This decomposition, if
not interrupted, is simple; but if there be various obstacles,
putrefactions ensue, which are the rudiments of a new generation. But if
(to come to our present point) a frequent agitation be excited by
external motion, the motion toward union (which is delicate and gentle,
and requires to be free from all external influence) is disturbed, and
ceases; which we perceive to be the case in innumerable instances. Thus,
the daily agitation or flowing of water prevents putrefaction; winds
prevent the air from being pestilent; corn turned about and shaken in
granaries continues clean: in short, everything which is externally
agitated will with difficulty rot internally.</p>
<p>We must not omit that union of the parts of bodies which is the
principal cause of induration and desiccation. When the spirit or
moisture, which has evaporated into spirit, has escaped from a porous
body (such as wood, bone, parchment, and the like), the thicker parts
are drawn together, and united with a greater effort, and induration or
desiccation is the consequence; and this we attribute not so much to the
motion of connection (in order to prevent a vacuum), as to this motion
of friendship and union.</p>
<p>Union from a distance is rare, and yet is to be met with in more
instances than are generally observed. We perceive it when one bubble
dissolves another, when medicines attract humors from a similarity of
substance, when one string moves another in unison with it on different
instruments, and the like. We are of opinion that this motion is very
prevalent also in animal spirits, but are quite ignorant of the fact. It
is, however, conspicuous in the magnet, and magnetized iron. While
speaking of the motions of the magnet, we must plainly distinguish them,
for there are four distinct powers or effects of the magnet which should
not be confounded, although the wonder and astonishment of mankind has
classed them together. 1. The attraction of the magnet to the magnet, or
of iron to the magnet, or of magnetized iron to iron. 2. Its polarity
toward the north and south, and its variation. 3. Its penetration
through gold, glass, stone, and all other substances. 4. The
communication of power from the mineral to iron, and from iron to iron,
without any communication of the substances. Here, however, we only
speak of the first. There is also a singular motion of attraction
between quicksilver and gold, so that the gold attracts quicksilver even
when made use of in ointment; and those who work surrounded by the
vapors of quicksilver, are wont to hold a piece of gold in their mouths,
to collect the exhalations, which would otherwise attack their heads and
bones, and this piece soon grows white.155 Let this suffice for the
motion of lesser congregation.</p>
<p>Let the ninth be the magnetic motion, which, although of the nature
of that last mentioned, yet, when operating at great distances, and on
great masses, deserves a separate inquiry, especially if it neither
begin in contact, as most motions of congregation do, nor end by
bringing the substances into contact, as all do, but only raise them,
and make them swell without any further effect. For if the moon raise
the waters, or cause moist substances to swell, or if the starry sphere
attract the planets toward their apogees, or the sun confine the planets
Mercury and Venus to within a certain distance of his mass;156 these
motions do not appear capable of being classed under either of those of
congregation, but to be, as it were, intermediately and imperfectly
congregative, and thus to form a distinct species.</p>
<p>Let the tenth motion be that of avoidance, or that which is opposed
to the motion of lesser congregation, by which bodies, with a kind of
antipathy, avoid and disperse, and separate themselves from, or refuse
to unite themselves with others of a hostile nature. For although this
may sometimes appear to be an accidental motion, necessarily attendant
upon that of the lesser congregation, because the homogeneous parts
cannot unite, unless the heterogeneous be first removed and excluded,
yet it is still to be classed separately,157 and considered as a
distinct species, because, in many cases, the desire of avoidance
appears to be more marked than that of union.</p>
<p>It is very conspicuous in the excrements of animals, nor less,
perhaps, in objects odious to particular senses, especially the smell
and taste; for a fetid smell is rejected by the nose, so as to produce a
sympathetic motion of expulsion at the mouth of the stomach; a bitter
and rough taste is rejected by the palate or throat, so as to produce a
sympathetic concussion and shivering of the head. This motion is visible
also in other cases. Thus it is observed in some kinds of
antiperistasis, as in the middle region of the air, the cold of which
appears to be occasioned by the rejection of cold from the regions of
the heavenly bodies; and also in the heat and combustion observed in
subterranean spots, which appear to be owing to the rejection of heat
from the centre of the earth. For heat and cold, when in small
quantities, mutually destroy each other, while in larger quantities,
like armies equally matched, they remove and eject each other in open
conflict. It is said, also that cinnamon and other perfumes retain their
odor longer when placed near privies and foul places, because they will
not unite and mix with stinks. It is well known that quicksilver, which
would otherwise reunite into a complete mass, is prevented from so doing
by man’s spittle, pork lard, turpentine and the like, from the little
affinity of its parts with those substances, so that when surrounded by
them it draws itself back, and its avoidance of these intervening
obstacles is greater than its desire of reuniting itself to its
homogeneous parts; which is what they term the mortification of
quicksilver. Again, the difference in weight of oil and water is not the
only reason for their refusing to mix, but it is also owing to the
little affinity of the two; for spirits of wine, which are lighter than
oil, mix very well with water. A very remarkable instance of the motion
in question is seen in nitre, and crude bodies of a like nature, which
abhor flame, as may be observed in gunpowder, quicksilver and gold. The
avoidance of one pole of the magnet by iron is not (as Gilbert has well
observed), strictly speaking, an avoidance, but a conformity, or
attraction to a more convenient situation.</p>
<p>Let the eleventh motion be that of assimilation, or
self-multiplication, or simple generation, by which latter term we do
not mean the simple generation of integral bodies, such as plants or
animals, but of homogeneous bodies. By this motion homogeneous bodies
convert those which are allied to them, or at least well disposed and
prepared, into their own substance and nature. Thus flame multiplies
itself over vapors and oily substances and generates fresh flame; the
air over water and watery substances multiplies itself and generates
fresh air; the vegetable and animal spirit, over the thin particles of a
watery or oleaginous spirit contained in its food, multiplies itself and
generates fresh spirit; the solid parts of plants and animals, as the
leaf, flower, the flesh, bone and the like, each of them assimilate some
part of the juices contained in their food, and generate a successive
and daily substance. For let none rave with Paracelsus, who (blinded by
his distillations) would have it, that nutrition takes place by mere
separation, and that the eye, nose, brain and liver lie concealed in
bread and meat, the root, leaf and flower, in the juice of the earth;
asserting that just as the artist brings out a leaf, flower, eye, nose,
hand, foot and the like, from a rude mass of stone or wood by the
separation and rejection of what is superfluous; so the great artist
within us brings out our several limbs and parts by separation and
rejection. But to leave such trifling, it is most certain that all the
parts of vegetables and animals, as well the homogeneous as organic,
first of all attract those juices contained in their food, which are
nearly common, or at least not very different, and then assimilate and
convert them into their own nature. Nor does this assimilation, or
simple generation, take place in animated bodies only, but the inanimate
also participate in the same property (as we have observed of flame and
air), and that languid spirit, which is contained in every tangible
animated substance, is perpetually working upon the coarser parts, and
converting them into spirit, which afterward is exhaled, whence ensues a
diminution of weight, and a desiccation of which we have spoken
elsewhere.158</p>
<p>Nor should we, in speaking of assimilation, neglect to mention the
accretion which is usually distinguished from aliment, and which is
observed when mud grows into a mass between stones, and is converted
into a stony substance, and the scaly substance round the teeth is
converted into one no less hard than the teeth themselves; for we are of
opinion that there exists in all bodies a desire of assimilation, as
well as of uniting with homogeneous masses. Each of these powers,
however, is confined, although in different manners, and should be
diligently investigated, because they are connected with the revival of
old age. Lastly, it is worthy of observation, that in the nine preceding
motions, bodies appear to aim at the mere preservation of their nature,
while in this they attempt its propagation.</p>
<p>Let the twelfth motion be that of excitement, which appears to be a
species of the last, and is sometimes mentioned by us under that name.
It is, like that, a diffusive, communicative, transitive and multiplying
motion; and they agree remarkably in their effect, although they differ
in their mode of action, and in their subject matter. The former
proceeds imperiously and with authority; it orders and compels the
assimilated to be converted and changed into the assimilating body. The
latter proceeds by art, insinuation and stealth, inviting and disposing
the excited toward the nature of the exciting body. The former both
multiplies and transforms bodies and substances; thus a greater quantity
of flame, air, spirit and flesh is formed; but in the latter, the powers
only are multiplied and changed, and heat, the magnetic power, and
putrefaction, in the above instances, are increased. Heat does not
diffuse itself when heating other bodies by any communication of the
original heat, but only by exciting the parts of the heated body to that
motion which is the form of heat, and of which we spoke in the first
vintage of the nature of heat. Heat, therefore, is excited much less
rapidly and readily in stone or metal than in air, on account of the
inaptitude and sluggishness of those bodies in acquiring that motion, so
that it is probable, that there may be some substances, toward the
centre of the earth, quite incapable of being heated, on account of
their density, which may deprive them of the spirit by which the motion
of excitement is usually commenced. Thus also the magnet creates in the
iron a new disposition of its parts, and a conformable motion, without
losing any of its virtue. So the leaven of bread, yeast, rennet and some
poisons, excite and invite successive and continued motion in dough,
beer, cheese or the human body; not so much from the power of the
exciting, as the predisposition and yielding of the excited body.</p>
<p>Let the thirteenth motion be that of impression, which is also a
species of motion of assimilation, and the most subtile of diffusive
motions. We have thought it right, however, to consider it as a distinct
species, on account of its remarkable difference from the last two; for
the simple motion of assimilation transforms the bodies themselves, so
that if you remove the first agent, you diminish not the effect of those
which succeed; thus, neither the first lighting of flame, nor the first
conversion into air, are of any importance to the flame or air next
generated. So, also, the motion of excitement still continues for a
considerable time after the removal of the first agent, as in a heated
body on the removal of the original heat, in the excited iron on the
removal of the magnet, and in the dough on the removal of the leaven.
But the motion of impression, although diffusive and transitive,
appears, nevertheless, to depend on the first agent, so that upon the
removal of the latter the former immediately fails and perishes; for
which reason also it takes effect in a moment, or at least a very short
space of time. We are wont to call the two former motions the motions of
the generation of Jupiter, because when born they continue to exist; and
the latter, the motion of the generation of Saturn, because it is
immediately devoured and absorbed. It may be seen in three instances: 1,
in the rays of light; 2, in the percussions of sounds; 3, in magnetic
attractions as regards communication. For, on the removal of light,
colors and all its other images disappear, as on the cessation of the
first percussion and the vibration of the body, sound soon fails, and
although sounds are agitated by the wind, like waves, yet it is to be
observed, that the same sound does not last during the whole time of the
reverberation. Thus, when a bell is struck, the sound appears to be
continued for a considerable time, and one might easily be led into the
mistake of supposing it to float and remain in the air during the whole
time, which is most erroneous.159 For the reverberation is not one
identical sound, but the repetition of sounds, which is made manifest by
stopping and confining the sonorous body; thus, if a bell be stopped and
held tightly, so as to be immovable, the sound fails, and there is no
further reverberation, and if a musical string be touched after the
first vibration, either with the finger (as in the harp), or a quill (as
in the harpsichord), the sound immediately ceases. If the magnet be
removed the iron falls. The moon, however, cannot be removed from the
sea, nor the earth from a heavy falling body, and we can, therefore,
make no experiment upon them; but the case is the same.</p>
<p>Let the fourteenth motion be that configuration or position, by which
bodies appear to desire a peculiar situation, collocation, and
configuration with others, rather than union or separation. This is a
very abstruse notion, and has not been well investigated; and, in some
instances, appears to occur almost without any cause, although we be
mistaken in supposing this to be really the case. For if it be asked,
why the heavens revolve from east to west, rather than from west to
east, or why they turn on poles situate near the Bears, rather than
round Orion or any other part of the heaven, such a question appears to
be unreasonable, since these phenomena should be received as determinate
and the objects of our experience. There are, indeed, some ultimate and
self-existing phenomena in nature, but those which we have just
mentioned are not to be referred to that class: for we attribute them to
a certain harmony and consent of the universe, which has not yet been
properly observed. But if the motion of the earth from west to east be
allowed, the same question may be put, for it must also revolve round
certain poles, and why should they be placed where they are, rather than
elsewhere? The polarity and variation of the needle come under our
present head. There is also observed in both natural and artificial
bodies, especially solids rather than fluids, a particular collocation
and position of parts, resembling hairs or fibres, which should be
diligently investigated, since, without a discovery of them, bodies
cannot be conveniently controlled or wrought upon. The eddies observable
in liquids by which, when compressed, they successively raise different
parts of their mass before they can escape, so as to equalize the
pressure, is more correctly assigned to the motion of liberty.</p>
<p>Let the fifteenth motion be that of transmission or of passage, by
which the powers of bodies are more or less impeded or advanced by the
medium, according to the nature of the bodies and their effective
powers, and also according to that of the medium. For one medium is
adapted to light, another to sound, another to heat and cold, another to
magnetic action, and so on with regard to the other actions.</p>
<p>Let the sixteenth be that which we term the royal or political
motion, by which the predominant and governing parts of any body check,
subdue, reduce, and regulate the others, and force them to unite,
separate, stand still, move, or assume a certain position, not from any
inclination of their own, but according to a certain order, and as best
suits the convenience of the governing part, so that there is a sort of
dominion and civil government exercised by the ruling part over its
subjects. The motion is very conspicuous in the spirits of animals,
where, as long as it is in force, it tempers all the motions of the
other parts. It is found in a less degree in other bodies, as we have
observed in blood and urine, which are not decomposed until the spirit,
which mixed and retained their parts, has been emitted or extinguished.
Nor is this motion peculiar to spirits only, although in most bodies the
spirit predominates, owing to its rapid motion and penetration; for the
grosser parts predominate in denser bodies, which are not filled with a
quick and active spirit (such as exists in quicksilver or vitriol), so
that unless this check or yoke be thrown off by some contrivance, there
is no hope of any transformation of such bodies. And let not any one
suppose that we have forgotten our subject, because we speak of
predominance in this classification of motions, which is made entirely
with the view of assisting the investigation of wrestling instances, or
instances of predominance. For we do not now treat of the general
predominance of motions or powers, but of that of parts in whole bodies,
which constitutes the particular species here considered.</p>
<p>Let the seventeenth motion be the spontaneous motion of revolution,
by which bodies having a tendency to move, and placed in a favorable
situation, enjoy their peculiar nature, pursuing themselves and nothing
else, and seeking, as it were, to embrace themselves. For bodies seem
either to move without any limit, or to tend toward a limit, arrived at
which they either revolve according to their peculiar nature, or rest.
Those which are favorably situated, and have a tendency to motion, move
in a circle with an eternal and unlimited motion; those which are
favorably situated and abhor motion, rest. Those which are not favorably
situated move in a straight line (as their shortest path), in order to
unite with others of a congenial nature. This motion of revolution
admits of nine differences: 1, with regard to the centre about which the
bodies move; 2, the poles round which they move; 3, the circumference or
orbit relatively to its distance from the centre; 4, the velocity, or
greater or less speed with which they revolve; 5, the direction of the
motion as from east to west, or the reverse; 6, the deviation from a
perfect circle, by spiral lines at a greater or less distance from the
centre; 7, the deviation from the circle, by spiral lines at a greater
or less distance from the poles; 8, the greater or less distance of
these spirals from each other; 9, and lastly, the variation of the poles
if they be movable; which, however, only affects revolution when
circular. The motion in question is, according to common and
long-received opinion, considered to be that of the heavenly bodies.
There exists, however, with regard to this, a considerable dispute
between some of the ancients as well as moderns, who have attributed a
motion of revolution to the earth. A much more reasonable controversy,
perhaps, exists (if it be not a matter beyond dispute), whether the
motion in question (on the hypothesis of the earth’s being fixed) is
confined to the heavens, or rather descends and is communicated to the
air and water. The rotation of missiles, as in darts, musket-balls, and
the like, we refer entirely to the motion of liberty.</p>
<p>Let the eighteenth motion be that of trepidation,160 to which (in the
sense assigned to it by astronomers) we do not give much credit; but in
our serious and general search after the tendencies of natural bodies,
this motion occurs, and appears worthy of forming a distinct species. It
is the motion of an (as it were) eternal captivity; when bodies, for
instance, being placed not altogether according to their nature, and yet
not exactly ill, constantly tremble, and are restless, not contented
with their position, and yet not daring to advance. Such is the motion
of the heart and pulse of animals, and it must necessarily occur in all
bodies which are situated in a mean state, between conveniences and
inconveniences; so that being removed from their proper position, they
strive to escape, are repulsed, and again continue to make the
attempt.</p>
<p>Let the nineteenth and last motion be one which can scarcely be
termed a motion, and yet is one; and which we may call the motion of
repose, or of abhorrence of motion. It is by this motion that the earth
stands by its own weight, while its extremes move toward the middle, not
to an imaginary centre, but in order to unite. It is owing to the same
tendency, that all bodies of considerable density abhor motion, and
their only tendency is not to move, which nature they preserve, although
excited and urged in a variety of ways to motion. But if they be
compelled to move, yet do they always appear anxious to recover their
former state, and to cease from motion, in which respect they certainly
appear active, and attempt it with sufficient swiftness and rapidity, as
if fatigued, and impatient of delay. We can only have a partial
representation of this tendency, because with us every tangible
substance is not only not condensed to the utmost, but even some spirit
is added, owing to the action and concocting influence of the heavenly
bodies.</p>
<p>We have now, therefore, exhibited the species, or simple elements of
the motions, tendencies, and active powers, which are most universal in
nature; and no small portion of natural science has been thus sketched
out. We do not, however, deny that other instances can perhaps be added,
and our divisions changed according to some more natural order of
things, and also reduced to a less number; in which respect we do not
allude to any abstract classification, as if one were to say, that
bodies desire the preservation, exaltation, propagation, or fruition of
their nature; or, that motion tends to the preservation and benefit
either of the universe (as in the case of those of resistance and
connection), or of extensive wholes, as in the case of those of the
greater congregation, revolution, and abhorrence of motion, or of
particular forms, as in the case of the others. For although such
remarks be just, yet, unless they terminate in matter and construction,
according to true definitions, they are speculative, and of little use.
In the meantime, our classification will suffice, and be of much use in
the consideration of the predominance of powers, and examining the
wrestling instances which constitute our present subject.</p>
<p>For of the motions here laid down, some are quite invincible, some
more powerful than others, which they confine, check, and modify; others
extend to a greater distance, others are more immediate and swift,
others strengthen, increase, and accelerate the rest.</p>
<p>The motion of resistance is most adamantine and invincible. We are
yet in doubt whether such be the nature of that of connection; for we
cannot with certainty determine whether there be a vacuum, either
extensive or intermixed with matter. Of one thing, however, we are
satisfied, that the reason assigned by Leucippus and Democritus for the
introduction of a vacuum (namely, that the same bodies could not
otherwise comprehend, and fill greater and less spaces) is false. For
there is clearly a folding of matter, by which it wraps and unwraps
itself in space within certain limits, without the intervention of a
vacuum. Nor is there two thousand times more of vacuum in air than in
gold, as there should be on this hypothesis; a fact demonstrated by the
very powerful energies of fluids (which would otherwise float like fine
dust in vacuo), and many other proofs. The other motions direct, and are
directed by each other, according to their strength, quantity,
excitement, emission, or the assistance or impediments they meet
with.</p>
<p>For instance; some armed magnets hold and support iron of sixty times
their own weight; so far does the motion of lesser congregation
predominate over that of the greater; but if the weight be increased, it
yields. A lever of a certain strength will raise a given weight, and so
far the motion of liberty predominates over that of the greater
congregation, but if the weight be greater, the former motion yields. A
piece of leather stretched to a certain point does not break, and so far
the motion of continuity predominates over that of tension, but if the
tension be greater, the leather breaks, and the motion of continuity
yields. A certain quantity of water flows through a chink, and so far
the motion of greater congregation predominates over that of continuity,
but if the chink be smaller it yields. If a musket be charged with ball
and powdered sulphur alone, and fire be applied, the ball is not
discharged, in which case the motion of greater congregation overcomes
that of matter; but when gunpowder is used, the motion of matter in the
sulphur predominates, being assisted by that motion, and the motion of
avoidance in the nitre; and so of the rest. For wrestling instances
(which show the predominance of powers, and in what manner and
proportion they predominate and yield) must be searched for with active
and industrious diligence.</p>
<p>The methods and nature of this yielding must also be diligently
examined, as for instance, whether the motions completely cease, or
exert themselves, but are constrained. For in the bodies with which we
are acquainted, there is no real but an apparent rest, either in the
whole or in parts. This apparent rest is occasioned either by
equilibrium, or the absolute predominance of motions. By equilibrium, as
in the scales of the balance, which rest if the weights be equal. By
predominance, as in perforated jars, in which the water rests, and is
prevented from falling by the predominance of the motion of connection.
It is, however, to be observed (as we have said before), how far the
yielding motions exert themselves. For if a man be held stretched out on
the ground against his will, with arms and legs bound down, or otherwise
confined, and yet strive with all his power to get up, the struggle is
not the less, although ineffectual. The real state of the case (namely,
whether the yielding motion be, as it were, annihilated by the
predominance, or there be rather a continued, although an invisible
effort) will, perhaps, appear in the concurrence of motions, although it
escape our notice in their conflict. For instance: let an experiment be
made with muskets; whether a musket-ball, at its utmost range in a
straight line, or (as it is commonly called) point-blank, strike with
less force when projected upward, where the motion of the blow is
simple, than when projected downward, where the motion of gravity
concurs with the blow.</p>
<p>The rules of such instances of predominance as occur should be
collected: such as the following; the more general the desired advantage
is, the stronger will be the motion; the motion of connection, for
instance, which relates to the intercourse of the parts of the universe,
is more powerful than that of gravity, which relates to the intercourse
of dense bodies only. Again, the desire of a private good does not in
general prevail against that of a public one, except where the
quantities are small. Would that such were the case in civil
matters!</p>
<ol start="49" type="I">
<li>In the twenty-fifth rank of prerogative instances we will place
suggesting instances; such as suggest, or point out, that which is
advantageous to mankind; for bare power and knowledge in themselves
exalt rather than enrich human nature. We must, therefore, select from
the general store such things as are most useful to mankind. We shall
have a better opportunity of discussing these when we treat of the
application to practice; besides, in the work of interpretation, we
leave room, on every subject, for the human or optative chart; for it is
a part of science to make judicious inquiries and wishes.</li>
</ol>
<p>L. In the twenty-sixth rank of prerogative instances we will place
the generally useful instances. They are such as relate to various
points, and frequently occur, sparing by that means considerable labor
and new trials. The proper place for treating of instruments and
contrivances, will be that in which we speak of the application to
practice, and the methods of experiment. All that has hitherto been
ascertained, and made use of, will be described in the particular
history of each art. At present, we will subjoin a few general examples
of the instances in question.</p>
<p>Man acts, then, upon natural bodies (besides merely bringing them
together or removing them) by seven principal methods: 1, by the
exclusion of all that impedes and disturbs; 2, by compression,
extension, agitation, and the like; 3, by heat and cold; 4, by detention
in a suitable place; 5, by checking or directing motion; 6, by peculiar
harmonies; 7, by a seasonable and proper alternation, series, and
succession of all these, or, at least, of some of them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>With regard to the first — common air, which is always at hand, and
forces its admission, as also the rays of the heavenly bodies, create
much disturbance. Whatever, therefore, tends to exclude them may well be
considered as generally useful. The substance and thickness of vessels
in which bodies are placed when prepared for operations may be referred
to this head. So also may the accurate methods of closing vessels by
consolidation, or the lutum sapientiæ, as the chemists call it. The
exclusion of air by means of liquids at the extremity is also very
useful, as when they pour oil on wine, or the juices of herbs, which by
spreading itself upon the top like a cover, preserves them uninjured
from the air. Powders, also, are serviceable, for although they contain
air mixed up in them, yet they ward off the power of the mass of
circumambient air, which is seen in the preservation of grapes and other
fruits in sand or flour. Wax, honey, pitch, and other resinous bodies,
are well used in order to make the exclusion more perfect, and to remove
the air and celestial influence. We have sometimes made an experiment by
placing a vessel or other bodies in quicksilver, the most dense of all
substances capable of being poured round others. Grottoes and
subterraneous caves are of great use in keeping off the effects of the
sun, and the predatory action of air, and in the north of Germany are
used for granaries. The depositing of bodies at the bottom of water may
be also mentioned here; and I remember having heard of some bottles of
wine being let down into a deep well in order to cool them, but left
there by chance, carelessness, and forgetfulness for several years, and
then taken out; by which means the wine not only escaped becoming flat
or dead, but was much more excellent in flavor, arising (as it appears)
from a more complete mixture of its parts. But if the case require that
bodies should be sunk to the bottom of water, as in rivers or the sea,
and yet should not touch the water, nor be inclosed in sealed vessels,
but surrounded only by air, it would be right to use that vessel which
has been sometimes employed under water above ships that have sunk, in
order to enable the divers to remain below and breathe occasionally by
turns. It was of the following nature: A hollow tub of metal was formed,
and sunk so as to have its bottom parallel with the surface of the
water; it thus carried down with it to the bottom of the sea all the air
contained in the tub. It stood upon three feet (like a tripod), being of
rather less height than a man, so that, when the diver was in want of
breath, he could put his head into the hollow of the tub, breathe, and
then continue his work. We hear that some sort of boat or vessel has now
been invented, capable of carrying men some distance under water. Any
bodies, however, can easily be suspended under some such vessel as we
have mentioned, which has occasioned our remarks upon the
experiment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another advantage of the careful and hermetical closing of bodies is
this — not only the admission of external air is prevented (of which we
have treated), but the spirit of bodies also is prevented from making
its escape, which is an internal operation. For any one operating on
natural bodies must be certain as to their quantity, and that nothing
has evaporated or escaped, since profound alterations take place in
bodies, when art prevents the loss or escape of any portion, while
nature prevents their annihilation. With regard to this circumstance, a
false idea has prevailed (which if true would make us despair of
preserving quantity without diminution), namely, that the spirit of
bodies, and air when rarefied by a great degree of heat, cannot be so
kept in by being inclosed in any vessel as not to escape by the small
pores. Men are led into this idea by the common experiments of a cup
inverted over water, with a candle or piece of lighted paper in it, by
which the water is drawn up, and of those cups which, when heated, draw
up the flesh. For they think that in each experiment the rarefied air
escapes, and that its quantity is therefore diminished, by which means
the water or flesh rises by the motion of connection. This is, however,
most incorrect. For the air is not diminished in quantity, but
contracted in dimensions,161 nor does this motion of the rising of the
water begin till the flame is extinguished, or the air cooled, so that
physicians place cold sponges, moistened with water, on the cups, in
order to increase their attraction. There is, therefore, no reason why
men should fear much from the ready escape of air: for although it be
true that the most solid bodies have their pores, yet neither air, nor
spirit, readily suffers itself to be rarefied to such an extreme degree;
just as water will not escape by a small chink.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>With regard to the second of the seven above-mentioned methods,
we must especially observe, that compression and similar violence have a
most powerful effect either in producing locomotion, and other motions
of the same nature, as may be observed in engines and projectiles, or in
destroying the organic body, and those qualities, which consist entirely
in motion (for all life, and every description of flame and ignition are
destroyed by compression, which also injures and deranges every
machine); or in destroying those qualities which consist in position and
a coarse difference of parts, as in colors; for the color of a flower
when whole, differs from that it presents when bruised, and the same may
be observed of whole and powdered amber; or in tastes, for the taste of
a pear before it is ripe, and of the same pear when bruised and
softened, is different, since it becomes perceptibly more sweet. But
such violence is of little avail in the more noble transformations and
changes of homogeneous bodies, for they do not, by such means, acquire
any constantly and permanently new state, but one that is transitory,
and always struggling to return to its former habit and freedom. It
would not, however, be useless to make some more diligent experiments
with regard to this; whether, for instance, the condensation of a
perfectly homogeneous body (such as air, water, oil, and the like) or
their rarefaction, when effected by violence, can become permanent,
fixed, and, as it were, so changed, as to become a nature. This might at
first be tried by simple perseverance, and then by means of helps and
harmonies. It might readily have been attempted (if we had but thought
of it), when we condensed water (as was mentioned above), by hammering
and compression, until it burst out. For we ought to have left the
flattened globe untouched for some days, and then to have drawn off the
water, in order to try whether it would have immediately occupied the
same dimensions as it did before the condensation. If it had not done
so, either immediately, or soon afterward, the condensation would have
appeared to have been rendered constant; if not, it would have appeared
that a restitution took place, and that the condensation had been
transitory. Something of the same kind might have been tried with the
glass eggs; the egg should have been sealed up suddenly and firmly,
after a complete exhaustion of the air, and should have been allowed to
remain so for some days, and it might then have been tried whether, on
opening the aperture, the air would be drawn in with a hissing noise, or
whether as much water would be drawn into it when immersed, as would
have been drawn into it at first, if it had not continued sealed. For it
is probable (or, at least, worth making the experiment) that this might
have happened, or might happen, because perseverance has a similar
effect upon bodies which are a little less homogeneous. A stick bent
together for some time does not rebound, which is not owing to any loss
of quantity in the wood during the time, for the same would occur (after
a larger time) in a plate of steel, which does not evaporate. If the
experiment of simple perseverance should fail, the matter should not be
given up, but other means should be employed. For it would be no small
advantage, if bodies could be endued with fixed and constant natures by
violence. Air could then be converted into water by condensation, with
other similar effects; for man is more the master of violent motions
than of any other means.</p></li>
<li><p>The third of our seven methods is referred to that great
practical engine of nature, as well as of art, cold and heat. Here,
man’s power limps, as it were, with one leg. For we possess the heat of
fire, which is infinitely more powerful and intense than that of the sun
(as it reaches us), and that of animals. But we want cold,162 except
such as we can obtain in winter, in caverns, or by surrounding objects
with snow and ice, which, perhaps, may be compared in degree with the
noontide heat of the sun in tropical countries, increased by the
reflection of mountains and walls. For this degree of heat and cold can
be borne for a short period only by animals, yet it is nothing compared
with the heat of a burning furnace, or the corresponding degree of
cold.163 Everything with us has a tendency to become rarefied, dry and
wasted, and nothing to become condensed or soft, except by mixtures,
and, as it were, spurious methods. Instances of cold, therefore, should
be searched for most diligently, such as may be found by exposing bodies
upon buildings in a hard frost, in subterraneous caverns, by surrounding
bodies with snow and ice in deep places excavated for that purpose, by
letting bodies down into wells, by burying bodies in quicksilver and
metals, by immersing them in streams which petrify wood, by burying them
in the earth (which the Chinese are reported to do with their china,
masses of which, made for that purpose, are said to remain in the ground
for forty or fifty years, and to be transmitted to their heirs as a sort
of artificial mine) and the like. The condensations which take place in
nature, by means of cold, should also be investigated, that by learning
their causes, they may be introduced into the arts; such as are observed
in the exudation of marble and stones, in the dew upon the panes of
glass in a room toward morning after a frosty night, in the formation
and the gathering of vapors under the earth into water, whence spring
fountains and the like.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Besides the substances which are cold to the touch, there are others
which have also the effect of cold, and condense; they appear, however,
to act only upon the bodies of animals, and scarcely any further. Of
these we have many instances, in medicines and plasters. Some condense
the flesh and tangible parts, such as astringent and inspissating
medicines, others the spirits, such as soporifics. There are two modes
of condensing the spirits, by soporifics or provocatives to sleep; the
one by calming the motion, the other by expelling the spirit. The
violet, dried roses, lettuces, and other benign or mild remedies, by
their friendly and gently cooling vapors, invite the spirits to unite,
and restrain their violent and perturbed motion. Rose-water, for
instance, applied to the nostrils in fainting fits, causes the resolved
and relaxed spirits to recover themselves, and, as it were, cherishes
them. But opiates, and the like, banish the spirits by their malignant
and hostile quality. If they be applied, therefore, externally, the
spirits immediately quit the part and no longer readily flow into it;
but if they be taken internally, their vapor, mounting to the head,
expels, in all directions, the spirits contained in the ventricles of
the brain, and since these spirits retreat, but cannot escape, they
consequently meet and are condensed, and are sometimes completely
extinguished and suffocated; although the same opiates, when taken in
moderation, by a secondary accident (the condensation which succeeds
their union), strengthen the spirits, render them more robust, and check
their useless and inflammatory motion, by which means they contribute
not a little to the cure of diseases, and the prolongation of life.</p>
<p>The preparations of bodies, also, for the reception of cold should
not be omitted, such as that water a little warmed is more easily frozen
than that which is quite cold, and the like.</p>
<p>Moreover, since nature supplies cold so sparingly, we must act like
the apothecaries, who, when they cannot obtain any simple ingredient,
take a succedaneum, or quid pro quo, as they term it, such as aloes for
xylobalsamum, cassia for cinnamon. In the same manner we should look
diligently about us, to ascertain whether there may be any substitutes
for cold, that is to say, in what other manner condensation can be
effected, which is the peculiar operation of cold. Such condensations
appear hitherto to be of four kinds only. 1. By simple compression,
which is of little avail toward permanent condensation, on account of
the elasticity of substances, but may still, however, be of some
assistance. 2. By the contraction of the coarser, after the escape or
departure of the finer parts of a given body; as is exemplified in
induration by fire, and the repeated heating and extinguishing of
metals, and the like. 3. By the cohesion of the most solid homogeneous
parts of a given body, which were previously separated, and mixed with
others less solid, as in the return of sublimated mercury to its simple
state, in which it occupies much less space than it did in powder, and
the same may be observed of the cleansing of all metals from their
dross. 4. By harmony, or the application of substances which condense by
some latent power. These harmonies are as yet but rarely observed, at
which we cannot be surprised, since there is little to hope for from
their investigation, unless the discovery of forms and confirmation be
attained. With regard to animal bodies, it is not to be questioned that
there are many internal and external medicines which condense by
harmony, as we have before observed, but this action is rare in
inanimate bodies. Written accounts, as well as report, have certainly
spoken of a tree in one of the Tercera or Canary Islands (for I do not
exactly recollect which) that drips perpetually, so as to supply the
inhabitants, in some degree, with water; and Paracelsus says that the
herb called ros solis is filled with dew at noon, while the sun gives
out its greatest heat, and all other herbs around it are dry. We treat
both these accounts as fables; they would, however, if true, be of the
most important service, and most worthy of examination. As to the
honey-dew, resembling manna, which is found in May on the leaves of the
oak, we are of opinion that it is not condensed by any harmony or
peculiarity of the oak leaf, but that while it falls equally upon other
leaves it is retained and continues on those of the oak, because their
texture is closer, and not so porous as that of most of the other
leaves.164</p>
<p>With regard to heat, man possesses abundant means and power; but his
observation and inquiry are defective in some respects, and those of the
greatest importance, notwithstanding the boasting of quacks. For the
effects of intense heat are examined and observed, while those of a more
gentle degree of heat, being of the most frequent occurrence in the
paths of nature, are, on that very account, least known. We see,
therefore, the furnaces, which are most esteemed, employed in increasing
the spirits of bodies to a great extent, as in the strong acids, and
some chemical oils; while the tangible parts are hardened, and, when the
volatile part has escaped, become sometimes fixed; the homogeneous parts
are separated, and the heterogeneous incorporated and agglomerated in a
coarse lump; and (what is chiefly worthy of remark) the junction of
compound bodies, and the more delicate conformations are destroyed and
confounded. But the operation of a less violent heat should be tried and
investigated, by which more delicate mixtures and regular conformations
may be produced and elicited, according to the example of nature, and in
imitation of the effect of the sun, which we have alluded to in the
aphorism on the instances of alliance. For the works of nature are
carried on in much smaller portions, and in more delicate and varied
positions than those of fire, as we now employ it. But man will then
appear to have really augmented his power, when the works of nature can
be imitated in species, perfected in power, and varied in quantity; to
which should be added the acceleration in point of time. Rust, for
instance, is the result of a long process, but crocus martis is obtained
immediately; and the same may be observed of natural verdigris and
ceruse. Crystal is formed slowly, while glass is blown immediately:
stones increase slowly, while bricks are baked immediately, etc. In the
meantime (with regard to our present subject) every different species of
heat should, with its peculiar effects, be diligently collected and
inquired into; that of the heavenly bodies, whether their rays be
direct, reflected, or refracted, or condensed by a burning-glass; that
of lightning, flame, and ignited charcoal; that of fire of different
materials, either open or confined, straitened or overflowing, qualified
by the different forms of the furnaces, excited by the bellows, or
quiescent, removed to a greater or less distance, or passing through
different media; moist heats, such as the balneum Mariæ, and the
dunghill; the external and internal heat of animals; dry heats, such as
the heat of ashes, lime, warm sand; in short, the nature of every kind
of heat, and its degrees.</p>
<p>We should, however, particularly attend to the investigation and
discovery of the effects and operations of heat, when made to approach
and retire by degrees, regularly, periodically, and by proper intervals
of space and time. For this systematical inequality is in truth the
daughter of heaven and mother of generation, nor can any great result be
expected from a vehement, precipitate, or desultory heat. For this is
not only most evident in vegetables, but in the wombs of animals also
there arises a great inequality of heat, from the motion, sleep, food,
and passions of the female. The same inequality prevails in those
subterraneous beds where metals and fossils are perpetually forming,
which renders yet more remarkable the ignorance of some of the reformed
alchemists, who imagined they could attain their object by the equable
heat of lamps, or the like, burning uniformly. Let this suffice
concerning the operation and effects of heat; nor is it time for us to
investigate them thoroughly before the forms and conformations of bodies
have been further examined and brought to light. When we have determined
upon our models, we may seek, apply, and arrange our instruments.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>The fourth mode of action is by continuance, the very steward and
almoner, as it were, of nature. We apply the term continuance to the
abandonment of a body to itself for an observable time, guarded and
protected in the meanwhile from all external force. For the internal
motion then commences to betray and exert itself when the external and
adventitious is removed. The effects of time, however, are far more
delicate than those of fire. Wine, for instance, cannot be clarified by
fire as it is by continuance. Nor are the ashes produced by combustion
so fine as the particles dissolved or wasted by the lapse of ages. The
incorporations and mixtures, which are hurried by fire, are very
inferior to those obtained by continuance; and the various conformations
assumed by bodies left to themselves, such as mouldiness, etc., are put
a stop to by fire or a strong heat. It is not, in the meantime,
unimportant to remark that there is a certain degree of violence in the
motion of bodies entirely confined; for the confinement impedes the
proper motion of the body. Continuance in an open vessel, therefore, is
useful for separations, and in one hermetically sealed for mixtures,
that in a vessel partly closed, but admitting the air, for putrefaction.
But instances of the operation and effect of continuance must be
collected diligently from every quarter.</p></li>
<li><p>The direction of motion (which is the fifth method of action) is
of no small use. We adopt this term, when speaking of a body which,
meeting with another, either arrests, repels, allows, or directs its
original motion. This is the case principally in the figure and position
of vessels. An upright cone, for instance, promotes the condensation of
vapor in alembics, but when reversed, as in inverted vessels, it assists
the refining of sugar. Sometimes a curved form, or one alternately
contracted and dilated, is required. Strainers may be ranged under this
head, where the opposed body opens a way for one portion of another
substance and impedes the rest. Nor is this process or any other
direction of motion carried on externally only, but sometimes by one
body within another. Thus, pebbles are thrown into water to collect the
muddy particles, and syrups are refined by the white of an egg, which
glues the grosser particles together so as to facilitate their removal.
Telesius, indeed, rashly and ignorantly enough attributes the formation
of animals to this cause, by means of the channels and folds of the
womb. He ought to have observed a similar formation of the young in eggs
which have no wrinkles or inequalities. One may observe a real result of
this direction of motion in casting and modelling.</p></li>
<li><p>The effects produced by harmony and aversion (which is the sixth
method) are frequently buried in obscurity; for these occult and
specific properties (as they are termed), the sympathies and
antipathies, are for the most part but a corruption of philosophy. Nor
can we form any great expectation of the discovery of the harmony which
exists between natural objects, before that of their forms and simple
conformations, for it is nothing more than the symmetry between these
forms and conformations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The greater and more universal species of harmony are not, however,
so wholly obscure, and with them, therefore, we must commence. The first
and principal distinction between them is this; that some bodies differ
considerably in the abundance and rarity of their substance, but
correspond in their conformation; others, on the contrary, correspond in
the former and differ in the latter. Thus the chemists have well
observed, that in their trial of first principles sulphur and mercury,
as it were, pervade the universe; their reasoning about salt, however,
is absurd, and merely introduced to comprise earthy dry fixed bodies. In
the other two, indeed, one of the most universal species of natural
harmony manifests itself. Thus there is a correspondence between
sulphur, oil, greasy exhalations, flame, and, perhaps, the substance of
the stars. On the other hand, there is a like correspondence between
mercury, water, aqueous vapor, air, and, perhaps, pure inter-sidereal
ether. Yet do these two quaternions, or great natural tribes (each
within its own limits), differ immensely in quantity and density of
substance, while they generally agree in conformation, as is manifest in
many instances. On the other hand, the metals agree in such quantity and
density (especially when compared with vegetables, etc.), but differ in
many respects in conformation. Animals and vegetables, in like manner,
vary in their almost infinite modes of conformation, but range within
very limited degrees of quantity and density of substance.</p>
<p>The next most general correspondence is that between individual
bodies and those which supply them by way of menstruum or support.
Inquiry, therefore, must be made as to the climate, soil, and depth at
which each metal is generated, and the same of gems, whether produced in
rocks or mines, also as to the soil in which particular trees, shrubs,
and herbs, mostly grow and, as it were, delight; and as to the best
species of manure, whether dung, chalk, sea sand, or ashes, etc., and
their different propriety and advantage according to the variety of
soils. So also the grafting and setting of trees and plants (as regards
the readiness of grafting one particular species on another) depends
very much upon harmony, and it would be amusing to try an experiment I
have lately heard of, in grafting forest trees (garden trees alone
having hitherto been adopted), by which means the leaves and fruit are
enlarged, and the trees produce more shade. The specific food of animals
again should be observed, as well as that which cannot be used. Thus the
carnivorous cannot be fed on herbs, for which reason the order of
feuilletans, the experiment having been made, has nearly vanished; human
nature being incapable of supporting their regimen, although the human
will has more power over the bodily frame than that of other animals.
The different kinds of putrefaction from which animals are generated
should be noted.</p>
<p>The harmony of principal bodies with those subordinate to them (such
indeed may be deemed those we have alluded to above) are sufficiently
manifest, to which may be added those that exist between different
bodies and their objects, and, since these latter are more apparent,
they may throw great light when well observed and diligently examined
upon those which are more latent.</p>
<p>The more internal harmony and aversion, or friendship and enmity (for
superstition and folly have rendered the terms of sympathy and antipathy
almost disgusting), have been either falsely assigned, or mixed with
fable, or most rarely discovered from neglect. For if one were to allege
that there is an enmity between the vine and the cabbage, because they
will not come up well when sown together, there is a sufficient reason
for it in the succulent and absorbent nature of each plant, so that the
one defrauds the other. Again, if one were to say that there is a
harmony and friendship between the corn and the corn-flower, or the wild
poppy, because the latter seldom grow anywhere but in cultivated soils,
he ought rather to say, there is an enmity between them, for the poppy
and the corn-flower are produced and created by those juices which the
corn has left and rejected, so that the sowing of the corn prepares the
ground for their production. And there are a vast number of similar
false assertions. As for fables, they must be totally exterminated.
There remains, then, but a scanty supply of such species of harmony as
has borne the test of experiment, such as that between the magnet and
iron, gold and quicksilver, and the like. In chemical experiments on
metals, however, there are some others worthy of notice, but the
greatest abundance (where the whole are so few in numbers) is discovered
in certain medicines, which, from their occult and specific qualities
(as they are termed), affect particular limbs, humors, diseases, or
constitutions. Nor should we omit the harmony between the motion and
phenomena of the moon, and their effects on lower bodies, which may be
brought together by an accurate and honest selection from the
experiments of agriculture, navigation, and medicine, or of other
sciences. By as much as these general instances, however, of more latent
harmony, are rare, with so much the more diligence are they to be
inquired after, through tradition, and faithful and honest reports, but
without rashness and credulity, with an anxious and, as it were,
hesitating degree of reliance. There remains one species of harmony
which, though simple in its mode of action, is yet most valuable in its
use, and must by no means be omitted, but rather diligently
investigated. It is the ready or difficult coition or union of bodies in
composition, or simple juxtaposition. For some bodies readily and
willingly mix, and are incorporated, others tardily and perversely; thus
powders mix best with water, chalk and ashes with oils, and the like.
Nor are these instances of readiness and aversion to mixture to be alone
collected, but others, also, of the collocation, distribution, and
digestion of the parts when mingled, and the predominance after the
mixture is complete.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Lastly, there remains the seventh, and last of the seven, modes of
action; namely, that by the alternation and interchange of the other
six; but of this, it will not be the right time to offer any examples,
until some deeper investigation shall have taken place of each of the
others. The series, or chain of this alternation, in its mode of
application to separate effects, is no less powerful in its operation
than difficult to be traced. But men are possessed with the most extreme
impatience, both of such inquiries, and their practical application,
although it be the clew of the labyrinth in all greater works. Thus far
of the generally useful instances.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="51" type="I">
<li><p>The twenty-seventh and last place we will assign to the magical
instances, a term which we apply to those where the matter or efficient
agent is scanty or small, in comparison with the grandeur of the work or
effect produced; so that even when common they appear miraculous, some
at first sight, others even upon more attentive observation. Nature,
however, of herself, supplies these but sparingly. What she will do when
her whole store is thrown open, and after the discovery of forms,
processes, and conformation, will appear hereafter. As far as we can yet
conjecture, these magic effects are produced in three ways, either by
self-multiplication, as in fire, and the poisons termed specific, and
the motions transferred and multiplied from wheel to wheel; or by the
excitement, or, as it were, invitation of another substance, as in the
magnet, which excites innumerable needles without losing or diminishing
its power; and again in leaven, and the like; or by the excess of
rapidity of one species of motion over another, as has been observed in
the case of gunpowder, cannon, and mines. The two former require an
investigation of harmonies, the latter of a measure of motion. Whether
there be any mode of changing bodies per minima (as it is termed), and
transferring the delicate conformations of matter, which is of
importance in all transformations of bodies, so as to enable art to
effect, in a short time, that which nature works out by divers
expedients, is a point of which we have as yet no indication. But, as we
aspire to the extremest and highest results in that which is solid and
true, so do we ever detest, and, as far as in us lies, expel all that is
empty and vain.</p></li>
<li><p>Let this suffice as to the respective dignity of prerogatives of
instances. But it must be noted, that in this our organ, we treat of
logic, and not of philosophy. Seeing, however, that our logic instructs
and informs the understanding, in order that it may not, with the small
hooks, as it were, of the mind, catch at, and grasp mere abstractions,
but rather actually penetrate nature, and discover the properties and
effects of bodies, and the determinate laws of their substance (so that
this science of ours springs from the nature of things, as well as from
that of the mind); it is not to be wondered at, if it have been
continually interspersed and illustrated with natural observations and
experiments, as instances of our method. The prerogative instances are,
as appears from what has preceded, twenty-seven in number, and are
termed, solitary instances, migrating instances, conspicuous instances,
clandestine instances, constitutive instances, similar instances,
singular instances, deviating instances, bordering instances, instances
of power, accompanying and hostile instances, subjunctive instances,
instances of alliance, instances of the cross, instances of divorce,
instances of the gate, citing instances, instances of the road,
supplementary instances, lancing instances, instances of the rod,
instances of the course, doses of nature, wrestling instances,
suggesting instances, generally useful instances, and magical instances.
The advantage, by which these instances excel the more ordinary, regards
specifically either theory or practice, or both. With regard to theory,
they assist either the senses or the understanding; the senses, as in
the five instances of the lamp; the understanding, either by expediting
the exclusive mode of arriving at the form, as in solitary instances, or
by confining, and more immediately indicating the affirmative, as in the
migrating, conspicuous, accompanying, and subjunctive instances; or by
elevating the understanding, and leading it to general and common
natures, and that either immediately, as in the clandestine and singular
instances, and those of alliance; or very nearly so, as in the
constitutive; or still less so, as in the similar instances; or by
correcting the understanding of its habits, as in the deviating
instances; or by leading to the grand form or fabric of the universe, as
in the bordering instances; or by guarding it from false forms and
causes, as in those of the cross and of divorce. With regard to
practice, they either point it out, or measure, or elevate it. They
point it out, either by showing where we must commence in order not to
repeat the labors of others, as in the instances of power; or by
inducing us to aspire to that which may be possible, as in the
suggesting instances; the four mathematical instances measure it. The
generally useful and the magical elevate it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Again, out of these twenty-seven instances, some must be collected
immediately, without waiting for a particular investigation of
properties. Such are the similar, singular, deviating, and bordering
instances, those of power, and of the gate, and suggesting, generally
useful, and magical instances; for these either assist and cure the
understanding and senses, or furnish our general practice. The remainder
are to be collected when we finish our synoptical tables for the work of
the interpreter, upon any particular nature; for these instances,
honored and gifted with such prerogatives, are like the soul amid the
vulgar crowd of instances, and (as we from the first observed) a few of
them are worth a multitude of the others. When, therefore, we are
forming our tables they must be searched out with the greatest zeal, and
placed in the table. And, since mention must be made of them in what
follows, a treatise upon their nature has necessarily been prefixed. We
must next, however, proceed to the supports and corrections of
induction, and thence to concretes, the latent process, and latent
conformations, and the other matters, which we have enumerated in their
order in the twenty-first aphorism, in order that, like good and
faithful guardians, we may yield up their fortune to mankind upon the
emancipation and majority of their understanding; from which must
necessarily follow an improvement of their estate, and an increase of
their power over nature. For man, by the fall, lost at once his state of
innocence, and his empire over creation, both of which can be partially
recovered even in this life, the first by religion and faith, the second
by the arts and sciences. For creation did not become entirely and
utterly rebellious by the curse, but in consequence of the Divine
decree, “in the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,” she is

<p>END OF “NOVUM ORGANUM”</p>
<p>ENDNOTES.</p>
<p>71 Τὸ τὶ ἦν εἶναι, or ἦν οὐσία of Aristotle. — See lib. iii.
Metap.</p>
<p>72 These divisions are from Aristotle’s Metaphysics, where they are
termed, 1. ὓλη ἢ τὸ ὑποκείμενον. 2. τὸ τὶ ἦν εἶναι. 3. ὅθεν ἡ ἀρχὴ τῆς
κινήσεως. 4. τὸ οὗ ἕνεκεν — καὶ τὸ ἀγαθόν.</p>
<p>73 See Aphorism li. and second paragraph of Aphorism lxv. in the
first book.</p>
<p>74 Bacon means, that although there exist in nature only
individualities, yet a certain number of these may have common
properties, and be controlled by the same laws. Now, these homogeneous
qualities which distinguish them from other individuals, lead us to
class them under one expression, and sometimes under a single term. Yet
these classes are only pure conceptions in Bacon’s opinion, and cannot
be taken for distinct substances. He evidently here aims a blow at the
Realists, who concluded that the essence which united individualities in
a class was the only real and immutable existence in nature, inasmuch as
it entered into their ideas of individual substances as a distinct and
essential property, and continued in the mind as the mold, type or
pattern of the class, while its individual forms were undergoing
perpetual renovation and decay. — Ed.</p>
<p>75 Bacon’s definition is obscure. All the idea we have of a law of
nature consists in invariable sequence between certain classes of
phenomena; but this cannot be the complete sense attached by Bacon to
the term form, as he employs it in the fourth aphorism as convertible
with the nature of any object; and again, in the first aphorism, as the
natura naturans, or general law or condition in any substance or quality
— natura naturata — which is whatever its form is, or that particular
combination of forces which impresses a certain nature upon matter
subject to its influence. Thus, in the Newtonian sense, the form of
whiteness would be that combination of the seven primitive rays of light
which give rise to that color. In combination with this word, and
affording a still further insight into its meaning, we have the phrases,
latens processus ad formam, et latens schematismus corporum. Now, the
latens schematismus signifies the internal texture, structure, or
configuration of bodies, or the result of the respective situation of
all the parts of a body; while the latens processus ad formam points out
the gradation of movements which takes place among the molecula of
bodies when they either conserve or change their figure. Hence we may
consider the form of any quality in body as something convertible with
that quality, i.e., when it exists the quality is present, and vice
versâ. In this sense, the form of a thing differs only from its
efficient cause in being permanent, whereas we apply cause to that which
exists in order of time. The latens processus and latens schematismus
are subordinate to form, as concrete exemplifications of its essence.
The former is the secret and invisible process by which change is
effected, and involves the principle since called the law of continuity.
Thus, the succession of events between the application of the match to
the expulsion of the bullet is an instance of latent progress which we
can now trace with some degree of accuracy. It also more directly refers
to the operation by which one form or condition of being is induced upon
another. For example, when the surface of iron becomes rusty, or when
water is converted into steam, some change has taken place, or latent
process from one form to another. Mechanics afford many exemplifications
of the first latent process we have denoted, and chemistry of the
second. The latens schematismus is that visible structure of bodies on
which so many of their properties depend. When we inquire into the
constitution of crystals, and into the internal structure of plants, we
are examining into their latent schematism. — Ed.</p>
<p>76 By the recent discoveries in electric magnetism, copper wires, or,
indeed, wires of any metal, may be transformed into magnets; the
magnetic law, or form, having been to that extent discovered.</p>
<p>77 Haller has pursued this investigation in his “Physiology,” and has
left his successors little else to do than repeat his discoveries. —
Ed.</p>
<p>78 Bacon here first seems pregnant with the important development of
the higher calculus, which, in the hands of Newton and Descartes, was to
effect as great a revolution in philosophy as his method. — Ed.</p>
<p>79 By spirit, Bacon here plainly implies material fluid too fine to
be grasped by the unassisted sense, which rather operates than reasons.
We sometimes adopt the same mode of expression, as in the words spirits
of nitre, spirits of wine. Some such agency has been assumed by nearly
all the modern physicists, a few of whom, along with Bacon, would leave
us to gather from their expressions, that they believe such bodies
endowed with the sentient powers of perception. As another specimen of
his sentiment on this subject, we may refer to a paragraph on the
decomposition of compounds, in his essay on death, beginning— “The
spirit which exists in all living bodies, keeps all the parts in due
subjection; when it escapes, the body decomposes, or the similar parts
unite.” — Ed.</p>
<p>80 The theory of the Epicureans and others. The atoms are supposed to
be invisible, unalterable particles, endued with all the properties of
the given body, and forming that body by their union. They must be
separated, of course, which either takes a vacuum for granted, or
introduces a tertium quid into the composition of the body.</p>
<p>81 Compare the three following aphorisms with the last three chapters
of the third book of the “De Augmentis Scientiarum.”</p>
<p>82 Bacon gives this unfortunate term its proper signification; μετα,
in composition, with the Greeks signifying change or mutation. Most of
our readers, no doubt, are aware that the obtrusion of this word into
technical philosophy was purely capricious, and is of no older date than
the publication of Aristotle’s works by Andronicus of Rhodes, one of the
learned men into whose hands the manuscripts of that philosopher fell,
after they were brought by Sylla from Athens to Rome. To fourteen books
in these MSS. with no distinguishing title, Andronicus is said to have
prefixed the words τα μετα τα φυσικα, to denote the place which they
ought to hold either in the order of Aristotle’s arrangement, or in that
of study. These books treat first of those subjects which are common to
matter and mind; secondly, of things separate from matter, i.e. of God,
and of the subordinate spirits, which were supposed by the Peripatetics
to watch over particular portions of the universe. The followers of
Aristotle accepted the whimsical title of Andronicus, and in their usual
manner allowed a word to unite things into one science which were
plainly heterogeneous. Their error was adopted by the Peripatetics of
the Christian Church. The schoolmen added to the notion of ontology, the
science of the mind, or pneumatology, and as that genus of being has
since become extinct with the schools, metaphysics thus in modern
parlance comes to be synonymous with psychology. It were to be wished
that Bacon’s definition of the term had been accepted, and mental
science delivered from one of the greatest monstrosities in its
nomenclature, yet Bacon whimsically enough in his De Augmentis includes
mathematics in metaphysics. — Ed.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>“Ne tenues pluviæ, rapidive potentia solis Acrior, aut Boreæ
penetrabile frigus adurat.”</p>
<p>— Virg. Georg. i. 92, 93.</p>
<p>84 This notion, which he repeats again, and particularizes in the
18th aph. of this book, is borrowed from the ancients, and we need not
say is as wise as their other astronomical conjectures. The sun also
approaches stars quite as large in other quarters of the zodiac, when it
looks down upon the earth through the murky clouds of winter. When that
luminary is in Leo, the heat of the earth is certainly greater than at
any other period, but this arises from the accumulation of heat after
the solstice, for the same reason that the maximum heat of the day is at
two o’clock instead of noon. — Ed.</p>
<p>85 Bouguer, employed by Louis XIV. in philosophical researches,
ascended the Andes to discover the globular form of the earth, and
published an account of his passage, which verifies the statement of
Bacon.</p>
<p>86 Montanari asserts in his book against the astrologers that he had
satisfied himself by numerous and oft-repeated experiments, that the
lunar rays gathered to a focus produced a sensible degree of heat.
Muschenbröck, however, adopts the opposite opinion, and asserts that
himself, De la Hire, Villet, and Tschirnhausen had tried with that view
the strongest burning-glasses in vain. (Opera de Igne.) De la Lande
makes a similar confession in his Astronomy (vol. ii. vii. § 1413).
Bouguer, whom we have just quoted, demonstrated that the light of the
moon was 300,000 degrees less than that of the sun; it would
consequently be necessary to invent a glass with an absorbing power
300,000 degrees greater than those ordinarily in use, to try the
experiment Bacon speaks of. — Ed.</p>
<p>87 In this thermometer, mercury was not dilated by heat or contracted
by cold, as the one now in use, but a mass of air employed instead,
which filled the cavity of the bulb. This being placed in an inverted
position to ours, that is to say, with the bulb uppermost, pressed down
the liquor when the air became dilated by heat, as ours press it upward;
and when the heat diminished, the liquor rose to occupy the place
vacated by the air, as the one now in use descends. It consequently was
liable to be affected by a change in the temperature, as by the weight
of air, and could afford only a rude standard of accuracy in scientific
investigations. This thermometer was not Bacon’s own contrivance, as is
commonly supposed, but that of Drebbel. — Ed.</p>
<p>88 La Lande is indignant that the Chaldeans should have more correct
notions of the nature of comets than the modern physicists, and charges
Bacon with entertaining the idea that they were the mere effects of
vapor and heat. This passage, with two others more positive, in the “De
Aug.” (cap. xl.) and the “Descript. Globi Intellect.” (cap. vi.)
certainly afford ground for the assertion; but if Bacon erred, he erred
with Galileo, and with the foremost spirits of the times. It is true
that Pythagoras and Seneca had asserted their belief in the solidity of
these bodies, but the wide dominion which Aristotle subsequently
exercised, threw their opinions into the shade, and made the opposite
doctrine everywhere paramount. — Ed.</p>
<p>89 Was it a silk apron which exhibited electric sparks? Silk was then
scarce.</p>
<p>90 The Italian fire-fly.</p>
<p>91 This last is found to be the real reason, air not being a good
conductor, and therefore not allowing the escape of heat. The confined
air is disengaged when these substances are placed under an exhausted
receiver.</p>
<p>92 This is erroneous. Air, in fact, is one of the worst, and metals
are the best conductors of heat.</p>
<p>93 See No. 28 in the table of the degrees of heat.</p>
<p>94 Bacon here mistakes sensation confined to ourselves for an
internal property of distinct substances. Metals are denser than wood,
and our bodies consequently coming into contact with more particles of
matter when we touch them, lose a greater quantity of heat than in the
case of lighter substances. — Ed.</p>
<p>95 This was the ancient opinion, but the moderns incline to the
belief that these insects are produced by generation or fecundity from
seeds deposited by their tribes in bodies on the verge of putrefaction.
— Ed.</p>
<p>96 The correct measure of the activity of flame may be obtained by
multiplying its natural force into the square of its velocity. On this
account the flame of vivid lightning mentioned in No. 23 contains so
much vigor, its velocity being greater than that arising from other
heat. — Ed.</p>
<p>97 The fires supply fresh heat, the water has only a certain quantity
of heat, which being diffused over a fresh supply of cooler water, must
be on the whole lowered.</p>
<p>98 If condensation were the cause of the greater heat, Bacon
concludes the centre of the flame would be the hotter part, and vice
versâ. The fact is, neither of the causes assigned by Bacon is the true
one; for the fire burns more quickly only because the draught of air is
more rapid, the cold dense air pressing rapidly into the heated room and
toward the chimney. — Ed.</p>
<p>99 Bacon appears to have confounded combustibility and fusibility
with susceptibility of heat; for though the metals will certainly
neither dissolve as soon as ice or butter, nor be consumed as soon as
wood, that only shows that different degrees of heat are required to
produce similar effects on different bodies; but metals much more
readily acquire and transmit the same degree of heat than any of the
above substances. The rapid transmission renders them generally cold to
the touch. The convenience of fixing wooden handles to vessels
containing hot water illustrates these observations.</p>
<p>100 Another singular error, the truth being, that solid bodies are
the best conductors; but of course where heat is diffused over a large
mass, it is less in each part, than if that part alone absorbed the
whole quantum of heat. — Ed.</p>
<p>101 This general law or form has been well illustrated by Newton’s
discovery of the decomposition of colors.</p>
<p>102 I.e., the common link or form which connects the various kinds of
natures, such as the different hot or red natures enumerated above. —
See Aphorism iii. part 2.</p>
<p>103 This is erroneous — all metals expand considerably when
heated.</p>
<p>104 “Quid ipsum,” the τὸ τὶ ἦν εἶναι of Aristotle.</p>
<p>105 To show the error of the text, we need only mention the case of
water, which, when confined in corked vases, and exposed to the action
of a freezing atmosphere, is sure to swell out and break those vessels
which are not sufficiently large to contain its expanded volume.
Megalotti narrates a hundred other instances of a similar character. —
Ed.</p>
<p>106 Bacon’s inquisition into the nature of heat, as an example of the
mode of interpreting nature, cannot be looked upon otherwise than as a
complete failure. Though the exact nature of this phenomenon is still an
obscure and controverted matter, the science of thermotics now consists
of many important truths, and to none of these truths is there so much
as an approximation in Bacon’s process. The steps by which this science
really advanced were the discovery of a measure of a heat or
temperature, the establishment of the laws of conduction and radiation,
of the laws of specific heat, latent heat, and the like. Such advances
have led to Ampère’s hypothesis, that heat consists in the vibrations of
an imponderable fluid; and to Laplace’s theory, that temperature
consists in the internal radiation of a similar medium. These hypotheses
cannot yet be said to be even probable, but at least they are so
modified as to include some of the preceding laws which are firmly
established, whereas Bacon’s “form,” or true definition of heat, as
stated in the text, includes no laws of phenomena, explains no process,
and is indeed itself an example of illicit generalization.</p>
<p>In all the details of his example of heat he is unfortunate. He
includes in his collection of instances, the hot tastes of aromatic
plants, the caustic effects of acids, and many other facts which cannot
be ascribed to heat without a studious laxity in the use of the word. —
Ed.</p>
<p>107 By this term Bacon understands general phenomena, taken in order
from the great mass of indiscriminative facts, which, as they lie in
nature, are apt to generate confusion by their number, indistinctness
and complication. Such classes of phenomena, as being peculiarly
suggestive of causation, he quaintly classes under the title of
prerogative inquiries, either seduced by the fanciful analogy, which
such instances bore to the prerogativa centuria in the Roman Comitia, or
justly considering them as Herschel supposes to hold a kind of
prerogative dignity from being peculiarly suggestive of causation.</p>
<p>Two high authorities in physical science (v. Herschel, Nat. Phil.,
art. 192; Whewell’s Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, vol. ii.
p. 243) pronounce these instances of little service in the task of
induction, being for the most part classed not according to the ideas
which they involve, or to any obvious circumstance in the facts of which
they consist, but according to the extent and manner of their influence
upon the inquiry in which they are employed. Thus we have solitary
instances, migrating instances, ostensive instances, clandestine
instances, so termed according to the degree in which they exhibit, or
seem to exhibit, the property, whose nature we would examine. We have
guide-post instances, crucial instances, instances of the parted road,
of the doorway, of the lamp, according to the guidance they supply to
our advance. Whewell remarks that such a classification is much of the
same nature as if, having to teach the art of building, we were to
describe tools with reference to the amount and place of the work which
they must do, instead of pointing out their construction and use; as if
we were to inform the pupil that we must have tools for lifting a stone
up, tools for moving it sidewise, tools for laying it square, and tools
for cementing it firmly. The means are thus lost in the end, and we reap
the fruits of unmethodical arrangement in the confusion of cross
division. In addition, all the instances are leavened with the error of
confounding the laws with the causes of phenomena, and we are urged to
adopt the fundamental error of seeking therein the universal agents, or
general causes of phenomena, without ascending the gradual steps of
intermediate laws. — Ed.</p>
<p>108 Of these nine general heads no more than the first is prosecuted
by the author.</p>
<p>109 This very nearly approaches to Sir I. Newton’s discovery of the
decomposition of light by the prism.</p>
<p>110 The mineral kingdom, as displaying the same nature in all its
gradations, from the shells so perfect in structure in limestone to the
finer marbles in which their nature gradually disappears, is the great
theatre for instances of migration. — Ed.</p>
<p>111 Bacon was not aware of the fact since brought to light by Römer,
that down to fourteen fathoms from the earth’s mean level the
thermometer remains fixed at the tenth degree, but that as the
thermometer descends below that depth the heat increases in a ratio
proportionate to the descent, which happens with little variation in all
climates. Buffon considers this a proof of a central fire in our planet.
— Ed.</p>
<p>112 All the diversities of bodies depend upon two principles, i.e.,
the quantity and the position of the elements that enter into their
composition. The primary difference is not that which depends on the
greatest or least quantity of material elements, but that which depends
on their position. It was the quick perception of this truth that made
Leibnitz say that to complete mathematics it was necessary to join to
the analysis of quantity the analysis of position. — Ed.</p>
<p>113 Query?</p>
<p>114 The real cause of this phenomenon is the attraction of the
surface-water in the vessel by the sides of the bubbles. When the
bubbles approach, the sides nearest each other both tend to raise the
small space of water between them, and consequently less water is raised
by each of these nearer sides than by the exterior part of the bubble,
and the greater weight of the water raised on the exterior parts pushes
the bubbles together. In the same manner a bubble near the side of a
vessel is pushed toward it; the vessel and bubble both drawing the water
that is between them. The latter phenomenon cannot be explained on
Bacon’s hypothesis.</p>
<p>115 Modern discoveries appear to bear out the sagacity of Bacon’s
remark, and the experiments of Baron Cagnard may be regarded as a first
step toward its full demonstration. After the new facts elicited by that
philosopher, there can be little doubt that the solid, liquid and
aëriform state of bodies are merely stages in a progress of gradual
transition from one extreme to the other, and that however strongly
marked the distinctions between them may appear, they will ultimately
turn out to be separated by no sudden or violent line of demarcation,
but slide into each other by imperceptible gradations. Bacon’s
suggestion, however, is as old as Pythagoras, and perhaps simultaneous
with the first dawn of philosophic reason. The doctrine of the
reciprocal transmutation of the elements underlies all the physical
systems of the ancients, and was adopted by the Epicureans as well as
the Stoics. Ovid opens his last book of the Metamorphoses with the
poetry of the subject, where he expressly points to the hint of Bacon:
—</p>
<p>— — “Tenuatus in auras Aëraque humor abit, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Inde retro redeunt, idemque retexitur ordo.” — xv. 246–249.</p>
<p>and Seneca, in the third book of his Natural Philosophy, quest. iv.,
states the opinion in more precise language than either the ancient bard
or the modern philosopher. — Ed.</p>
<p>116 The author’s own system of Memoria Technica may be found in the
De Augmentis, chap. xv. We may add that, notwithstanding Bacon’s
assertion that he intended his method to apply to religion, politics,
and morals, this is the only lengthy illustration he has adduced of any
subject out of the domain of physical science. — Ed.</p>
<p>117 The collective instances here meant are no other than general
facts or laws of some degree of generality, and are themselves the
result of induction. For example, the system of Jupiter, or Saturn with
its satellites, is a collective instance, and materially assisted in
securing the admission of the Copernican system. We have here in
miniature, and displayed at one view, a system analogous to that of the
planets about the sun, of which, from the circumstance of our being
involved in it, and unfavorably situated for seeing it otherwise than in
detail, we are incapacitated from forming a general idea, but by slow
and progressive efforts of reason.</p>
<p>But there is a species of collective instance which Bacon does not
seem to have contemplated, in which particular phenomena are presented
in such numbers at once, as to make the induction of their law a matter
of ocular inspection. For example, the parabolic form assumed by a jet
of water spouted out of a hole is a collective instance of the
velocities and directions of the motions of all the particles which
compose it seen together, and which thus leads us without trouble to
recognize the law of the motion of a projectile. Again, the beautiful
figures exhibited by sand strewed on regular plates of glass or metal
set in vibration, are collective instances of an infinite number of
points which remain at rest while the remainder of the plate vibrates,
and in consequence afford us an insight into the law which regulates
their arrangement and sequence throughout the whole surface. The richly
colored lemniscates seen around the optic axis of crystals exposed to
polarized light afford a striking instance of the same kind, pointing at
once to the general mathematical expression of the law which regulates
their production. Such collective instances as these lead us to a
general law by an induction which offers itself spontaneously, and thus
furnish advanced posts in philosophical exploration. The laws of Kepler,
which Bacon ignored on account of his want of mathematical taste, may be
cited as a collective instance. The first is, that the planets move in
elliptical orbits, having the sun for their common focus. The second,
that about this focus the radius vector of each planet describes equal
areas in equal times. The third, that the squares of the periodic times
of the planets are as the cubes of their mean distance from the sun.
This collective instance “opened the way” to the discovery of the
Newtonian law of gravitation. — Ed.</p>
<p>118 Is not this very hasty generalization? Do serpents move with four
folds only? Observe also the motion of centipedes and other insects.</p>
<p>119 Shaw states another point of difference between the objects cited
in the text — animals having their roots within, while plants have
theirs without; for their lacteals nearly correspond with the fibres of
the roots in plants; so that animals seem nourished within themselves as
plants are without. — Ed.</p>
<p>120 Bacon falls into an error here in regarding the syllogism as
something distinct from the reasoning faculty, and only one of its
forms. It is not generally true that the syllogism is only a form of
reasoning by which we unite ideas which accord with the middle term.
This agreement is not even essential to accurate syllogisms; when the
relation of the two things compared to the third is one of equality or
similitude, it of course follows that the two things compared may be
pronounced equal, or like to each other. But if the relation between
these terms exist in a different form, then it is not true that the two
extremes stand in the same relation to each other as to the middle term.
For instance, if A is double of B, and B double of C, then A is
quadruple of C. But then the relation of A to C is different from that
of A to B and of B to C. — Ed.</p>
<p>121 Comparative anatomy is full of analogies of this kind. Those
between natural and artificial productions are well worthy of attention,
and sometimes lead to important discoveries. By observing an analogy of
this kind between the plan used in hydraulic engines for preventing the
counter-current of a fluid, and a similar contrivance in the blood
vessels, Harvey was led to the discovery of the circulation of the
blood. — Ed.</p>
<p>122 This is well illustrated in plants, for the gardener can produce
endless varieties of any known species, but can never produce a new
species itself.</p>
<p>123 The discoveries of Tournefort have placed moss in the class of
plants. The fish alluded to below are to be found only in the tropics. —
Ed.</p>
<p>124 There is, however, no real approximation to birds in either the
flying fish or bat, any more than a man approximates to a fish because
he can swim. The wings of the flying fish and bat are mere expansions of
skin, bearing no resemblance whatever to those of birds. — Ed.</p>
<p>125 Seneca was a sounder astronomer than Bacon. He ridiculed the idea
of the motion of any heavenly bodies being irregular, and predicted that
the day would come, when the laws which guided the revolution of these
bodies would be proved to be identical with those which controlled the
motions of the planets. The anticipation, was realized by Newton. —
Ed.</p>
<p>126 But see Bacon’s own corollary at the end of the Instances of
Divorce, Aphorism xxxvii. If Bacon’s remark be accepted, the censure
will fall upon Newton and the system so generally received at the
present day. It is, however, unjust, as the centre of which Newton so
often speaks is not a point with an active inherent force, but only the
result of all the particular and reciprocal attractions of the different
parts of the planet acting upon one spot. It is evident, that if all
these forces were united in this centre, that the sum would be equal to
all their partial effects. — Ed.</p>
<p>127 Since Newton’s discovery of the law of gravitation, we find that
the attractive force of the earth must extend to an infinite distance.
Bacon himself alludes to the operation of this attractive force at great
distances in the Instances of the Rod, Aphorism xlv.</p>
<p>128 Snow reflects light, but is not a source of light.</p>
<p>129 Bacon’s sagacity here foreshadows Newton’s theory of the
tides.</p>
<p>130 The error in the text arose from Bacon’s impression that the
earth was immovable. It is evident, since gravitation acts at an
infinite distance, that no such point could be found; and even supposing
the impossible point of equilibrium discovered, the body could not
maintain its position an instant, but would be hurried, at the first
movement of the heavenly bodies, in the direction of the dominant
gravitating power. — Ed.</p>
<p>131 Fly clocks are referred to in the text, not pendulum clocks,
which were not known in England till 1662. The former, though clumsy and
rude in their construction, still embodied sound mechanical principles.
The comparison of the effect of a spring with that of a weight in
producing certain motions in certain times on altitudes and in mines,
has recently been tried by Professors Airy and Whewell in Dalcoath mine,
by means of a pendulum, which is only a weight moved by gravity, and a
chronometer balance moved and regulated by a spring. In his
thirty-seventh Aphorism, Bacon also speaks of gravity as an incorporeal
power, acting at a distance, and requiring time for its transmission; a
consideration which occurred at a later period to Laplace in one of his
most delicate investigations.</p>
<p>Crucial instances, as Herschel remarks, afford the readiest and
securest means of eliminating extraneous causes, and deciding between
the claims of rival hypotheses; especially when these, running parallel
to each other, in the explanation of great classes of phenomena, at
length come to be placed at issue upon a single fact. A curious example
is given by M. Fresnel, as decisive in his mind of the question between
the two great theories on the nature of light, which, since the time of
Newton and Huyghens, have divided philosophers. When two very clean
glasses are laid one on the other, if they be not perfectly flat, but
one or both, in an almost imperceptible degree, convex or prominent,
beautiful and vivid colors will be seen between them; and if these be
viewed through a red glass, their appearance will be that of alternate
dark and bright stripes. These stripes are formed between the two
surfaces in apparent contact, and being applicable on both theories, are
appealed to by their respective supporters as strong confirmatory facts;
but there is a difference in one circumstance, according as one or other
theory is employed to explain them. In the case of the Huyghenian
theory, the intervals between the bright stripes ought to appear
absolutely black, when a prism is used for the upper glass, in the other
half bright. This curious case of difference was tried, as soon as the
opposing consequences of the two theories were noted by M. Fresnel, and
the result is stated by him to be decisive in favor of that theory which
makes light to consist in the vibrations of an elastic medium. — Ed.</p>
<p>132 Bacon plainly, from this passage, was inclined to believe that
the moon, like the comets, was nothing more than illuminated vapor. The
Newtonian law, however, has not only established its solidity, but its
density and weight. A sufficient proof of the former is afforded by the
attraction of the sea, and the moon’s motion round the earth. — Ed.</p>
<p>133 Rather the refraction; the sky or air, however, reflects the blue
rays of light.</p>
<p>134 The polished surface of the glass causes the reflection in this
case, and not the air; and a hat or other black surface put behind the
window in the daytime will enable the glass to reflect distinctly for
the same reason, namely, that the reflected rays are not mixed and
confused with those transmitted from the other side of the window.</p>
<p>135 These instances, which Bacon seems to consider as a great
discovery, are nothing more than disjunctive propositions combined with
dilemmas. In proposing to explain an effect, we commence with the
enumeration of the different causes which seem connected with its
production; then with the aid of one or more dilemmas, we eliminate each
of the phenomena accidental to its composition, and conclude with
attributing the effect to the residue. For instance, a certain
phenomenon (a) is produced either by phenomenon (B) or phenomenon (C);
but C cannot be the cause of a, for it is found in D, E, F, neither of
which are connected with a. Then the true cause of phenomenon (a) must
be phenomenon (B).</p>
<p>This species of reasoning is liable to several paralogisms, against
which Bacon has not guarded his readers, from the very fact that he
stumbled into them unwittingly himself. The two principal ones are false
exclusions and defective enumerations. Bacon, in his survey of the
causes which are able to concur in producing the phenomena of the tides,
takes no account of the periodic melting of the Polar ice, or the
expansion of water by the solar heat; nor does he fare better in his
exclusions. For the attraction of the planets and the progression and
retrograde motion communicated by the earth’s diurnal revolution, can
plainly affect the sea together, and have a simultaneous influence on
its surface.</p>
<p>Bacon is hardly just or consistent in his censure of Ramus; the end
of whose dichotomy was only to render reasoning by dilemma, and crucial
instances, more certain in their results, by reducing the divisions
which composed their parts to two sets of contradictory propositions.
The affirmative or negative of one would then necessarily have led to
the acceptance or rejection of the other. — Ed.</p>
<p>136 Père Shenier first pointed out the spots on the sun’s disk, and
by the marks which they afforded him, computed its revolution to be
performed in twenty-five days and some hours. — Ed.</p>
<p>137 Rust is now well known to be a chemical combination of oxygen
with the metal, and the metal when rusty acquires additional weight. His
theory as to the generation of animals, is deduced from the erroneous
notion of the possibility of spontaneous generation (as it was termed).

<p>140 Riccati, and all modern physicists, discover some portion of
light in every body, which seems to confirm the passage in Genesis that
assigns to this substance priority in creation. — Ed.</p>
<p>141 As instances of this kind, which the progress of science since
the time of Bacon affords, we may cite the air-pump and the barometer,
for manifesting the weight and elasticity of air: the measurement of the
velocity of light, by means of the occultation of Jupiter’s satellites
and the aberration of the fixed stars: the experiments in electricity
and galvanism, and in the greater part of pneumatic chemistry. In all
these cases scientific facts are elicited, which sense could never have
revealed to us. — Ed.</p>
<p>142 The itinerant instances, as well as frontier instances, are cases
in which we are enabled to trace the general law of continuity which
seems to pervade all nature, and which has been aptly embodied in the
sentence, “natura non agit per saltum.” The pursuit of this law into
phenomena where its application is not at first sight obvious, has
opened a mine of physical discovery, and led us to perceive an intimate
connection between facts which at first seemed hostile to each other.
For example, the transparency of gold-leaf, which permits a bluish-green
light to pass through it, is a frontier instance between transparent and
opaque bodies, by exhibiting a body of the glass generally regarded the
most opaque in nature, as still possessed of some slight degree of
transparency. It thus proves that the quality of opacity is not a
contrary or antagonistic quality to that of transparency, but only its
extreme lowest degree.</p>
<p>143 Alluding to his theory of atoms.</p>
<p>144 Observe the approximation to Newton’s theory. The same notion
repeated still more clearly in the ninth motion. Newton believed that
the planets might so conspire as to derange the earth’s annual
revolution, and to elongate the line of the apsides and ellipsis that
the earth describes in its annual revolution round the sun. In the
supposition that all the planets meet on the same straight line, Venus
and Mercury on one side of the sun, and the earth, moon, Mars, Jupiter
and Saturn on the side diametrically opposite; then Saturn would attract
Jupiter, Jupiter Mars, Mars the moon, which must in its turn attract the
earth in proportion to the force with which it was drawn out of its
orbit. The result of this combined action on our planet would elongate
its ecliptic orbit, and so far draw it from the source of heat, as to
produce an intensity of cold destructive to animal life. But this
movement would immediately cease with the planetary concurrence which
produced it, and the earth, like a compressed spring, bound almost as
near to the sun as she had been drawn from it, the reaction of the heat
on its surface being about as intense as the cold caused by the first
removal was severe. The earth, until it gained its regular track, would
thus alternately vibrate between each side of its orbit, with successive
changes in its atmosphere, proportional to the square of the variation
of its distance from the sun. In no place is Bacon’s genius more
conspicuous than in these repeated guesses at truth. He would have been
a strong Copernican, had not Gilbert defended the system. — Ed.</p>
<p>145 This is not true except when the projectile acquires greater
velocity at every successive instant of its course, which is never the
case except with falling bodies. Bacon appears to have been led into the
opinion from observing that gunshots pierce many objects at a distance
from which they rebound when brought within a certain proximity of
contact. This apparent inconsistency, however, arises from the
resistance of the parts of the object, which velocity combined with
force is necessary to overcome. — Ed.</p>
<p>146 This passage shows that the pressure of the external atmosphere,
which forces the water into the egg, was not in Bacon’s time understood.
— Ed.</p>
<p>147 We have already alluded, in a note prefixed to the same aphorism
of the first book, to Newton’s error of the absolute lightness of
bodies. In speaking again of the volatile or spiritual substances (Aph.
xl. b. ii.) which he supposed with the Platonists and some of the
schoolmen to enter into the composition of every body, he ascribes to
them a power of lessening the weight of the material coating in which he
supposes them inclosed. It would appear from these passages and the text
that Bacon had no idea of the relative density of bodies, and the
capability which some have to diminish the specific gravity of the
heavier substances by the dilation of their parts; or if he had, the
reveries in which Aristotle indulged in treating of the soul, about the
appetency of bodies to fly to kindred substances — flame and spirit to
the sky, and solid opaque substances to the earth, must have vitiated
his mind. — Ed.</p>
<p>148 Römer, a Danish astronomer, was the first to demonstrate, by
connecting the irregularities of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites
with their distances from the earth, the necessity of time for the
propagation of light. The idea occurred to Dominic Cassini as well as
Bacon, but both allowed the discovery to slip out of their hands. —
Ed.</p>
<p>149 The author in the text confounds inertness, which is a simple
indifference of bodies to action, with gravity, which is a force acting
always in proportion to their density. He falls into the same error
further on. — Ed.</p>
<p>150 The experiments of the last two classes of instances are
considered only in relation to practice, and Bacon does not so much as
mention their infinitely greater importance in the theoretical part of
induction. The important law of gravitation in physical astronomy could
never have been demonstrated but by such observations and experiments as
assigned accurate geometrical measures to the quantities compared. It
was necessary to determine with precision the demi-diameter of the
earth, the velocity of falling bodies at its surface, the distance of
the moon, and the speed with which she describes her orbit, before the
relation could be discovered between the force which draws a stone to
the ground and that which retains the moon in her sphere.</p>
<p>In many cases the result of a number of particular facts, or the
collective instances rising out of them, can only be discovered by
geometry, which so far becomes necessary to complete the work of
induction. For instance, in the case of optics, when light passes from
one transparent medium to another, it is refracted, and the angle which
the ray of incidence makes with the superficies which bounds the two
media determines that which the refracted ray makes with the same
superficies. Now, all experiment can do for us in this case is, to
determine for any particular angle of incidence the corresponding angle
of refraction. But with respect to the general rule which in every
possible case deduces one of these angles from the other, or expresses
the constant and invariable relation which subsists between them,
experiment gives no direct information. Geometry must, consequently, be
called in, which, when a constant though unknown relation subsists
between two angles, or two variable qualities of any kind, and when an
indefinite number of values of those quantities are assigned, furnishes
infallible means of discovering that unknown relation either accurately
or by approximation. In this way it has been found, when the two media
remain the same, the cosines of the above-mentioned angles have a
constant ratio to each other. Hence, when the relations of the simple
elements of phenomena are discovered to afford a general rule which will
apply to any concrete case, the deductive method must be applied, and
the elementary principles made through its agency to account for the
laws of their more complex combinations. The reflection and refraction
of light by the rain falling from a cloud opposite to the sun was
thought, even before Newton’s day, to contain the form of the rainbow.
This philosopher transformed a probable conjecture into a certain fact
when he deduced from the known laws of reflection and refraction the
breadth of the colored arch, the diameter of the circle of which it is a
part, and the relation of the latter to the place of the spectator and
the sun. Doubt was at once silenced when there came out of his calculus
a combination of the same laws of the simple elements of optics
answering to the phenomena in nature. — Ed.</p>
<p>151 As far as this motion results from attraction and repulsion, it
is only a simple consequence of the last two. — Ed.</p>
<p>152 These two cases are now resolved into the property of the
capillary tubes and present only another feature of the law of
attraction. — Ed.</p>
<p>153 This is one of the most useful practical methods in chemistry at
the present day.</p>
<p>154 See Aphorism xxv.</p>
<p>155 Query?</p>
<p>156 Observe this approximation to Newton’s theory.</p>
<p>157 Those differences which are generated by the masses and
respective distances of bodies are only differences of quantity, and not
specific; consequently those three classes are only one. — Ed.</p>
<p>158 See the citing instances, Aphorism xl.</p>
<p>159 Aristotle’s doctrine, that sound takes place when bodies strike
the air, which the modern science of acoustics has completely
established, was rejected by Bacon in a treatise upon the same subject:
“The collision or thrusting of air,” he says, “which they will have to
be the cause of sound, neither denotes the form nor the latent process
of sound, but is a term of ignorance and of superficial contemplation.”
To get out of the difficulty, he betook himself to his theory of
spirits, a species of phenomena which he constantly introduces to give
himself the air of explaining things he could not understand, or would
not admit upon the hypothesis of his opponents. — Ed.</p>
<p>160 The motion of trepidation, as Bacon calls it, was attributed by
the ancient astronomers to the eight spheres, relative to the precession
of the equinoxes. Galileo was the first to observe this kind of lunar
motion. — Ed.</p>
<p>161 Part of the air is expanded and escapes, and part is consumed by
the flame. When condensed, therefore, by the cold application, it cannot
offer sufficient resistance to the external atmosphere to prevent the
liquid or flesh from being forced into the glass.</p>
<p>162 Heat can now be abstracted by a very simple process, till the
degree of cold be of almost any required intensity. — Ed.</p>
<p>163 It is impossible to compare a degree of heat with a degree of
cold, without the assumption of some arbitrary test, to which the
degrees are to be referred. In the next sentence Bacon appears to have
taken the power of animal life to support heat or cold as the test, and
then the comparison can only be between the degree of heat or of cold
that will produce death.</p>
<p>The zero must be arbitrary which divides equally a certain degree of
heat from a certain degree of cold. — Ed.</p>
<p>164 It may often be observed on the leaves of the lime and other
trees.</p>

<p>Poterit fortasse Majestas tua me furti incusare, quod tantum temporis
quantum ad haec sufficiat negotiis tuis suffuratus sim. Non haveo quod
dicam. Temporis enim non fit restitutio; nisi forte quod detractum
fuerit temporis rebus tuis, id memoriae nominis tui et honori saeculi
tui reponi possit; si modo haec alicujus sint pretii. Sunt certe prorsus
nova; etiam toto genere: sed descripta ex veteri admodum exemplari,

Illud enim in eo solummodo mirabile est, initia rei et tantas de iis

<p>FRANCISCI DE VERULAMIO</p>
<p>Sic Cogitavit;</p>
<p>Talemque Apud Se</p>
<p>rationem instituit,quam Viventibus et</p>
<p>Posteris notum fieri, ipsorum</p>
<p>interesse putavit.</p>
<p>Cum illi pro comperto esset intellectum humanum sibi ipsi negotium
facessere, neque auxiliis veris (quae in hominis potestate sunt) uti
sobrie et commode; unde multiplex rerum ignoratio et ex ignoratione
rerum detrimenta innumera: omni ope connitendum existimavit, si quo modo
commercium istud Mentis et Rerum (cui vix aliquid in terris, aut saltem
in terrenis, se ostendit simile) restitui posset in integrum, aut saltem
in melius deduci. Ut vero errores qui invaluerunt, quique in aeternum
invalituri sunt, alii post alios (si mens sibi permittatur) ipsi se
corrigerent, vel ex vi intellectus propria vel ex auxiliis atque
adminiculis dialecticae, nulla prorsus suberat spes; propterea quod
notiones rerum primae, quas mens haustu facili et supino excipit
recondit atque accumulat (unde reliqua omnia fluunt), vitiosae sint et
confusae et temere a rebus abstractae; neque minor sit in secundis et
reliquis libido et inconstantia; ex quo fit, ut universa ista ratio
humana, qua utimur quoad inquisitionem naturae, non bene congesta et
aedificata sit, sed tanquam moles aliqua magnifica sine fundamento. Dum
enim falsas mentis vires mirantur homines et celebrant, veras ejusdem
quae esse possint (si debita ei adhibeantur auxilia, atque ipsa rebus
morigera sit, nec impotenter rebus insultet) praetereunt et perdunt.
Restabat illud unum ut res de integro tentetur melioribus praesidiis,
utque fiat scientiarum et artium atque omnis humanae doctrinae in
universum Instauratio, a debitis excitata fundamentis. Hoc vero licet
aggressu infinitum quiddam videri possit ac supra vires mortales, tamen
idem tractatu sanum invenietur ac sobrium, magis quam ea quae adhuc
facta sunt. Exitus enim hujus rei est nonnullus. In iis vero quae jam
fiunt circa scientias, est vertigo quaedam et agitatio perpetua et
circulus. Neque eum fugit quanta in solitudine versetur hoc
experimentum, et quam durum et incredibile sit ad faciendam fidem.
Nihilominus, nec rem nec seipsum deserendum putavit, quin viam quae una
humanae menti pervia est tentaret atque iniret. Praestat enim principium
dare rei quae exitum habere possit, quam in iis quae exitum nullum
habent perpetua contentione et studio implicari. Viae autem
contemplativae viis illis activis decantatis fere respondent; ut altera,
ab initio ardua et difficilis, desinat in apertum; altera, primo intuitu
expedita et proclivis, ducat in avia et praecipitia. Quum autem incertus
esset quando haec alicui posthac in mentem ventura sint; eo potissimum
usus argumento, quod neminem hactenus invenit qui ad similes cogitations
animum applicuerit; decrevit prima quaeque quae perficere licuit in
publicum edere. Neque haec festinatio ambitiosa fuit, sed sollicita; ut
si quid illi humanitus accideret, extaret tamen designatio quaedam ac
destinatio rei quam animo complexus est; utque extaret simul signum
aliquod honestae suae et propensae in generis humani commoda voluntatis.
Certe aliam quamcunque ambitionem inferiorem duxit re quam prae manibus
habuit. Aut enim hoc quod agitur nihil est, aut tantum, ut merito ipso
contentum esse debeat nec fructum extra quaerere.</p>
<p>PRAEFATIO.</p>
<p>De statu scientiarum, quod non sit foelix aut majorem in modum
auctus; quodque alia omnino quam prioribus cognita fuerit via aperienda
sit intellectui humano, et alia comparanda auxilia, ut mens suo jure in
rerum naturam uti possit.</p>
<p>Videntur nobis homines nec opes nec vires suas bene nosse; verum de
illis majora quam par est, de his minora credere. Ita fit, ut aut artes
receptas insanis pretiis aestimantes nil amplius quaerant, aut seipsos
plus aequo contemnentes vires suas in levioribus consumant, in iis quae
ad summum rei faciant non experiantur. Quare sunt et suae scientiis
columnae tanquam fatales; cum ad ulterius penetrandum homines nec
desiderio nec spe excitentur. Atque cum opinio copiae inter maximas
causas inopiae sit; quumque ex fiducia praesentium vera auxilia
negligantur in posterum; ex usu est, et plane ex necessitate, ut ab
illis quae adhuc inventa sunt in ipso operis nostri limine (idque
relictis ambagibus et non dissimulanter) honoris et admirationis
excessus tollatur; utili monito, ne homines eorum aut copia aut
utilitatem in majus accipiant aut celebrent. Nam si quis in omnem illam
librorum varietatem qua artes et scientiae exultant diligentius
introspiciat, ubique inveniet ejusdem rei repetitiones infinitas,
tractandi modis diversas, inventione praeoccupatas; ut omnia primo
intuitu numerosa, facto examine pauca reperiantur. Et de utilitate
aperte dicendum est, sapientiam istam quam a Graecis potissimum hausims
pueritiam quandam scientiae videri, atque habere quod proprium est
puerorum, ut ad garriendum prompta, ad generandum invalida et immatura
sit. Controversiarum enim ferax, operum effoeta est. Adeo ut fabula illa
de Scylla in literarum statum, qualis habetur, ad vivum quadrare
videatur; quae virginis os et vultum extulit, ad uterum vero monstra
latrantia succingebantur et adhaerebant. Ita habent et scientiae quibus
insuevimus generalia quaedam blandientia et speciosa, sed cum ad
particularia ventum sit, veluti ad partes generationis, ut fructum et
opera ex se edant, tum contentiones et oblatrantes disputationes
exoriuntur, in quas desinunt, et quae partus locum obtinent. Praeterea,
si hujusmodi scientiae plane res mortua non essent, id minime videtur
eventurum fuisse quod per multa jam saecula usu venit, ut illae suis
immotae fere haereant vestigiis, nec incrementa genere humano digna
sumant: eo usque, ut saepenumero non solum assertio maneat assertio sed
etiam quaestio maneat quaestio, et per disputationes non solvatur sed
figatur et alatur, omnisque traditio et successio disciplinarum
repraesentet et exhibeat personas magistri et auditoris, non inventoris
et ejus qui inventis aliquid eximium adjiciat. In artibus autem
mechanicis contrarium evenire videmus; quae, ac si aurae cujusdam
vitalis forent participes, quotidie crescunt et perficiuntur, et in
primis authoribus rudes plerunque et fere onerosae et informes apparent,
postea vero novas virtutes et commoditatem quandam adipiscuntur, eo
usque, ut citius studia hominum et cupiditates deficiant et mutentur,
quam illae ad culmen et perfectionem suam pervenerint. Philosophia
contra et scientiae intellectuales, statuarum more, adorantur et
celebrantur, sed non promoventur. Quin etiam in primo nonnunquam authore
maxime vigent, et deinceps degenerant. Nam postquam homines dedititii
facti sint et in unius sententiam (tanquam pedarii senatores) coierint,
scientiis ipsis amplitudinem non addunt, sed in certis authoribus
ornandis et stipandis servili officio funguntur. Neque illud afferat
quispiam, scientias paullatim succrescentes tandem ad statum quendam
pervenisse, et tum demum (quasi confectis spatiis legitimis) in operibus
paucorum sedes fixas posuisse; atque postquam nil melius inveniri
potuerit, restare scilicet ut quae inventa sint exornentur et colantur.
Atque optandum quidem esset haec ita se habuisse. Rectius illud et
verius, istas scientiarum mancipationes nil aliud esse quam rem ex
paucorum hominum confidentia et reliquorum socordia et inertia natam.
Postquam enim scientiae per partes diligenter fortasse excultae et
tractatae fuerint, tum forte exortus est aliquis, ingenio audax et
propter methodi compendia acceptus et celebratus, qui specie tenus artem
constituerit, revera veterum labores corruperit. Id tamen posteris
gratum esse solet, propter usum operis expeditum et inquisitionis novae
taedium et impatientiam. Quod si quis consensu jam inveterato tanquam
temporis judicio moveatur, sciat se ratione admodum fallaci et infirma
niti. Neque enim nobis magna ex parte notum est, quid in scientiis et
artibus, variis saeculis et locis, innotuerit et in publicum emanarit;
multo minus, quid a singulis tentatum sit et secreto agitatum. Itaque
nec temporis partus nec abortus extant in fastis. Neque ipse consensus
ejusque diuturnitas magni prorsus aestimandus est. Utcunque enim varia
sint genera politiarum, unicus est status scientiarum, isque semper fuit
et mansurus est popularis. Atque apud populum plurimum vigent doctrinae
aut contentiosae et pugnaces aut speciosae et inanes, quales videlicet
assensum aut illaqueant aut demulcent. Itaque maxima ingenia proculdubio
per singulas aetates vim passa sunt; dum viri captu et intellectu non
vulgares, nihilo secius existimationi suae consulentes, temporis et
multitudinis judicio se submiserint. Quamobrem altiores contemplationes
si forte usquam emicuerint, opinionum vulgarium ventis subinde agitatae
sunt et extinctae. Adeo ut Tempus, tanquam fluvius, levia et inflata ad
nos devexerit, gravia et solida demerserit. Quin et illi ipsi authores
qui dictaturam quandam in scientiis invaserunt et tanta confidentia de
rebus pronuntiant, cum tamen per intervalla ad se redeunt, ad
querimonias de subtilitate naturae, veritatis recessibus, rerum
obscuritate, causarum implicatione, ingenii humani infirmitate, se
convertunt; in hoc nihilo tamen modestiores, cum malint communem hominum
et rerum conditionem causari quam de seipsis confiteri. Quin illis hoc
fere solenne est, ut quicquid ars aliqua non attingat id ipsum ex eadem
arte impossibile esse statuant. Neque vero damnari potest ars, quum ipsa
disceptet et judicet. Itaque id agitur, ut ignorantia etiam ab ignominia
liberetur. Atque quae tradita et recepta sunt ad hunc fere modum se
habent: quoad opera sterilia, quaestionum plena; incrementis suis tard
et languida; perfectionem in tot simulantia, sed per partes male
impleta; delectu autem popularia et authoribus ipsis suspecta, ideoque
artificiis quibusdam munita et ostentata. Qui autem et ipsi experiri et
se scientiis addere earumque fines proferre statuerunt, nec illi a
receptis prorsus desciscere ausi sunt, nec fontes rerum petere. Verum se
magnum quiddam consequutos putant si aliquid ex proprio inserant et
adjiciant; prudenter secum reputantes, se in assentiendo modestiam, in
adjiciendo libertatem tueri posse. Verum dum opinionibus et moribus
consulitur, mediocritates istae laudatae in magnum scientiarum
detrimentum cedunt. Vix enim datur authores simul et admirari et
superare. Sed fit aquarum more, quae non altius ascendunt quam ex quo
descenderunt. Itaque hujusmodi homines emendant nonnulla sed parum
promovent, et proficiunt in melius non in majus. Neque tamen defuerunt,
qui ausu majore omnia integra sibi duxerunt, et ingenii impetu usi,
priora prosternendo et destruendo aditum sibi et placitis suis fecerunt;
quorum tumultu non magnopere profectum est: quum philosophiam et artes
non re ac opere amplificare, sed placita tantum permutare atque regnum
opinionum in se transferre contenderint; exiquo sane fructu, quum inter
errores oppositos errandi causae sint fere communes. Si qui autem nec
alienis nec propriis placitis obnoxii, sed libertati faventes, ita
animati fuere ut alios secum simul quaerere cuperent; illi sane affectu
honesti, sed conatu invalidi fuerunt. Probabiles enim tantum rationes
secuti videntur, et argumentorum vertigine circumaguntur, et promiscua
quaerendi licentia severitatem inquisitionis enervarunt. Nemo autem
reperitur, qui in rebus ipsis et experientia moram fecerit legitimam.
Atque nonnulli rursus qui experientiae undis se commisere et fere
mechanici facti sunt, tamen in ipsa experientia erraticam quandam
inquisitionem exercent, nec ei certa lege militant. Quin et plerique
pusilla quaedam pensa sibi proposuere, pro magno ducentes si unum
aliquod inventurm eruere possint; instituto non minus tenui, quam
imperito. Nemo enim rei alicujus naturam in ipsa re recte aut foeliciter
perscrutatur; verum post laboriosam experimentorum variationem non
acquiescit, sed invenit quod ulterius quaerat. Neque illud imprimis
omttendum est, quod omnis in experiendo industria statim ab initio opera
quaedam destinata praepropero et intempestivo studio captavit;
fructifera (inquam) experimenta, non lucifera, quaesivit; nec ordinem
divinum imitata est, qui primo die lucem tantum creavit, eique unum diem
integrum attribuit; neque illo die quicquam materiati operis produxit,
verum sequentibus diebus ad ea descendit. At qui summas dialecticae
partes tribuerunt ateque inde fidissima scientiis praesidia comparari
putarunt, verissime et optime viderunt intellectum humanum sibi
permissum merito suspectum esse debere. Verum infirmior omnino est malo
medicina; nec ipsa mali expers. Siquidem dialectica quae recepta est,
licet ad civilia et artes quae in sermone et opinione positae sunt
rectissime adhibeatur, naturae tamen subtilitatem longo intervallo non
attingit; et prensando quod non capit, ad errores potius stabiliendos et
quasi figendos quam ad viam veritati aperiendam valuit.</p>
<p>Quare, ut quae dicta sunt complectamur, non videtur hominibus aut
aliena fides aut industria propria circa scientias hactenus foeliciter
illuxisse; praesertim quum et in demonstrationibus et in experimentis
adhuc cognitis parum sit praesidii. Aedificium autem hujus universi,
structura sua, intellectui humano contemplanti, instar labyrinthi est;
ubi tot ambigua viarum, tam fallaces rerum et signorum similitudines,
tam obliquae et implexae naturarum spirae et nodi, undequaque se
ostendunt. Iter autem sub incerto sensus lumine, interdum affulgente,
interdum se condente, per experientiae et rerum particularium sylvas
perpetuo faciendum est. Quin etiam duces itineris (ut dictum est) qui se
offerunt, et ipsi implicantur, atque errorum et errantium numerum
augent. In rebus tam duris, de judicio hominum ex vi propria, aut etiam
de foelicitate fortuita, desperandum est. Neque enim ingeniorum
quantacunque excellentia, neque experiendi alea saepius repetita, ista
vincere queat. Vestigia filo regenda sunt: omnisque via, usque a primis
ipsis sensuum perceptionibus, certa ratione munienda. Neque haec ita
accipienda sunt, ac si nihil omnino tot saeculis, tantis laboribus,
actum sit. Neque enim eorum quae inventa sunt nos poenitet. Atque
antiqui certe, in iis quae in ingenio et meditatione abstracta posita
sunt, mirabiles se viros praestitere. Verum quemadmodum saeculis
prioribus, cum homines in navigando per stellarum tantum observationes
cursum dirigebant, veteris sane continentis oras legere potuerunt, aut
maria aliqua minora et mediterranea trajicere; priusquam autem oceanus
trajiceretur et novi orbis regiones detegerentur, necesse fuit usum acus
nauticae, ut ducem viae magis fidum et certum, innotuisse: simili
prorsus ratione, quae hucusque in artibus et scientiis inventa sunt, ea
hujusmodi sunt ut usu, meditatione, observando, argumentando, reperiri
potuerint; utpote quae sensibus propiora sint et communibus notionibus
fere subjaceant; antequam vero ad remotiora et occultiora naturae liceat
appellere, necessario requiritur ut melior et perfectior mentis et
intellectus humani usus et adoperatio introducatur.</p>
<p>Nos certe, aeterno veritatis amore devicti, viarum incertis et arduis
et solitudinibus nos commisimus; et divino auxilio freti et innixi,
mentem nostram et contra opinionum violentias et quasi instructas acies,
et contra proprias et internas haesitationes et scrupulos, et contra
rerum caligines et nubes et undequaque volantes phantasias, sustinuimus;
ut tandem magis fida et secura indicia viventibus et posteris comparare
possemus. Qua in re si quid profecerimus, non alia sane ratio nobis viam
aperuit quam vera et legitima spiritus humani humiliatio. Omnes enim
ante nos, qui ad artes inveniendas se applicuerunt, conjectis paulisper
in res et exempla et experientiam oculis, statim, quasi inventio nil
aliud esset quam quaedam excogitatio, spiritus proprios ut sibi oracula
exhiberent quodammodo invocarunt. Nos vero inter res caste et perpetuo
versantes, intellectum longius a rebus non abstrahimus quam ut rerum
imagines et radii (ut in sensu fit) coire possint; unde fit, ut ingenii
viribus et excellentiae non multum relinquatur. Atque quam in inveniendo
adhibemus humilitatem, eandem et in docendo sequuti sumus. Neque enim
aut confutationum triumphis, aut antiquitatis advocationibus, aut
authoritatis usurpatione quadam, aut etiam obscuritatis velo, aliquam
his nostris inventis majestatem imponere aut conciliare conamur; qualia
reperire non difficile esset ei, qui nomini suo non animis aliorum lumen
affundere conaretur. Non (inquam) ullum aut vim aut insidias hominum
judiciis fecimus aut paramus; verum eos ad res ipsas et rerum foedera
adducimus; ut ipsi videant quid habeant, quid arguant, quid addant atque
in commune conferant. Nos autem si qua in re vel male credidimus, vel
obdormivimus et minus attendimus, vel defecimus in via et inquisitionem
abrupimus, nihilominus iis modis res nudas et apertas exhibemus, ut
errores nostri, antequam scientiae massam altius inficiant, notari et
separari possint; atque etiam ut facilis et expedita sit laborum
nostrorum continuatio. Atque hoc modo inter empiricam et rationalem
facultatem (quarum morosa et inauspicata divortia et repudia omnia in
humana familia turbavere) conjugium verum et legitimum in perpetuum nos
firmasse existimamus.</p>
<p>Quamobrem, quum haec arbitrii nostri non sint, in principio operis,
ad Deum Patre, Deum Verbum, Deum Spiritum, presces fundimus humillimas
et ardentissimas, ut humani generis aerumnarum memores et
peregrinationis istius vitae in qua dies paucos et malos terimus, novis
suis eleemosynis, per manus nostras, familiam humanam dotare dignentur.
Atque illud insuper supplices rogamus, ne humana divinis officiant, neve
ex reseratione viarum sensus et accensione majore luminis naturalis
aliquid incredulitatis et noctis animis nostris erga divina mysteria
oboriatur: sed potius, ut ab intellectu puro, a phantasiis et vanitate
repurgato et divinis oraculis nihilominus subdito et prorsus dedititio,
fidei dentur quae fidei sunt. Postremo, ut scientiae veneno a serpente
infuso, quo animus humanus tumet et inflatur, deposito, nec altum
sapiamus nec ultra sobrium, sed veritatem in charitate colamus.</p>
<p>Peractis autem votis, ad homines conversi, quaedam et salutaria
monemus et aequa postulamus. Monemus primum (quod etiam precati sumus)
ut homines sensum in officio, quoad divina, contineant. Sensus enim
(instar solis) globi terrestris faciem aperit, coelestis claudit et
obsignat. Rursus, ne hujusce mali fuga in contrarium peccent; quod certe
fiet, si naturae inquisitionem ulla ex parte veluti interdicto separatam
putant. Neque enim pura illa et immaculata scientia naturalis, per quam
Adam nomina ex proprietate rebus imposuit, principium aut occasionem
lapsui dedit. Sed ambitiosa illa, et imperativa scientiae moralis, de
bono et malo dijudicantis, cupiditas, ad hoc ut Homo a Deo deficeret et
sibi ipsi leges daret, ea demum ratio atque modus tentationis fuit. De
scientiis autem quae naturam contemplantur sanctus ille philosophus
pronuntiat, Gloriam Dei esse celare rem; gloriam regis autem rem
invenire: non aliter ac si divina natura innocenti et benevolo purorum
ludo delectaretur, qui ideo se abscondunt ut inveniantur; atque animam
humanam sibi collusorem in hoc ludo pro sua in homines indulgentia et
bonitate cooptaverit. Postremo omnes in universum monitos volumus, ut
scientiae veros fines cogitent; nec eam aut animi causa petant, aut ad
contentionem, aut ut alios despiciant, aut ad commodum, aut ad famam,
aut ad potentiam, aut hujusmodi inferiora; sed ad meritum et usus vitae;
eamque in charitate perficiant et regant. Ex appetitu enim potentiae
angeli lapsi sunt; ex appetitu scientiae, homines; sed charitatis non
est excessus; neque angelus aut homo per eam unquam in periculum
venit.</p>
<p>Postulata autem nostra quae afferimus talis sunt. De nobis ipsis
silemus: de re autem quae agitur petimus, ut homines eam non opinionem
sed opus esse cogitent; ac pro certo habeant, non sectae nos alicujus
aut placiti, sed utilitatis et amplitudinis humanae fundamenta moliri.
Deinde ut suis commodis aequi, exutis opinionum zelis et praejudiciis,
in commune consulant; ac ab erroribus viarum atque impedimentis, nostris
praesidiis et auxiliis, liberati et muniti, laborum qui restant et ipsi
in partem veniant. Praeterea, ut bene sperent; neque Instaurationem
nostram, ut quiddam infinitum et ultra mortale, fingant et animo
concipiant; quum revera sit infiniti erroris finis et terminus
legitimus; mortalitatis autem et humanitatis non sit immemor; quum rem
non intra unius aetatis curriculum omnino perfici posse confidat, sed
successioni destinet; denique scientias, non per arrogantiam in humani
ingenii cellulis, sed submisse in mundo majore quaerat. Vasta vero ut
plurimum solent esse, quae inania: solida contrahuntur maxime, et in
parvo sita sunt. Postremo etiam petendum videtur (ne forte quis rei
ipsius periculo nobis iniquus esse velit) ut videant homines, quatenus
ex eo quod nobis asserere necesse sit (si modo nobis ipsi constare
velimus) de his nostris opinandi aut sententiam ferendi sibi jus
permissum putent: quum nos omnem istam rationem humanam praematuram,
anticipantem, et a rebus temere et citius quam oportuit abstractam,
(quatenus ad inquisitionem naturae) ut rem variam et perturbatam et male
extructam rejiciamus. Neque postulandum est ut ejus judicio stetur, quae
ipsa in judicium vocatur.</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTIO OPERIS</p>
<p>Ejus constituuntur Partes sex.</p>
<p>Prima; Partitiones Scientiarum.</p>
<p>Secunda; Novum Organum, sive Indicia de Interpretatione Naturae.</p>
<p>Tertia; Phaenomena Universi, sive Historia Naturalis et
Experimentalis ad condendam Philosophiam.</p>
<p>Quarta; Scala Intellectus.</p>
<p>Quinta; Prodromi, sive Anticipationes Philosophiae Secundae.</p>
<p>Sexta; Philosophia Secunda, sive Scientia Activa.</p>
<p>Singularum Argumenta.</p>
<p>Pars autem instituti nostri est, ut omnia, quantum fieri potest
aperte et perspicue proponantur. Nuditas enim animi, ut olim corporis,
innocentiae et simplicitatis comes est. Pateat itaque primo ordo operis
atque ratio ejus. Partes operis a nobis constituuntur sex.</p>
<p>Prima pars exhibet scientiae ejus sive doctrinae in cujus possessione
humanum genus hactenus versatur, Summam, sive descriptionem universalem.
Visum enim est nobis etiam in iis quae recepta sunt nonnullam facere
moram: eo nimirum consilio, ut facilius et veteribus perfectio et novis
aditus detur. Pari enim fere studio ferimur et ad vetera excolenda et ad
ulteriora assequenda. Pertinet etiam hoc ad faciendam fidem: juxta
illud, Non accipit indoctus verba scientiae, nisi prius ea dixeris quae
versantur in corde ejus. Itaque scientiarum atque artium receptarum oras
legere, necnon utilia quaedam in illas importare, tanquam in transitu,
non negligemus.</p>
<p>Partitiones tamen Scientiarum adhibemus eas, quae non tantum jam
inventa et nota, sed hactenus omissa et debita, complectantur. Etenim
inveniuntur in globo intellectuali, quemadmodum in terrestri, et culta
pariter et deserta. Itaque nil mirum videri debet, si a divisionibus
usitatis quandoque recedamus. Adjectio enim, dum totum variat, etiam
partes earumque sectiones necessario variat: receptae autem divisiones
receptae summae scientiarum, qualis nunc est, tantum competunt.</p>
<p>Circa ea vero quae ceu omissa notabimus, ita nos geremus, ut non
leves tantum titulos et argumenta concisa eorum quae desiderantur
proponamus. Nam siquid inter omissa retulerimus (modo sit dignioris
subjecti) cujus ratio paulo videatur obscurior adeo ut merito suspicari
possimus homines non facile intellecturos quid nobis velimus aut quale
sit illud opus quod animo et cogitatione complectimur, perpetuo nobis
curae erit aut praecepta hujusmodi operis conficiendi aut etiam partem
operis ipsius jam a nobis confectam ad exemplum totius subjungere; ut in
singulis aut opera aut consilio juvemus. Etenim etiam as nostram
existimationem, non solum aliorum utilitatem, pertinere putavimus, ne
quis arbitretur levem aliquam de istiusmodi rebus notionem mentem
nostram perstrinxisse, atque esse illa quae desideramus ac prensamus
tanquam votis similia. Ea vero talia sunt, quorum et penes homines (nisi
sibi ipsi desint) potestas plane sit, et nos apud nosmet rationem
quandam certam et explicatam habeamus. Neque enim regiones metiri animo,
ut augures, auspiciorum cause: sed intrare, ut duces, promerendi studio,
suscepimus.</p>
<p>Atque haec prima operis pars est.</p>
<p>Porro praetervecti artes veteres, intellectum humanum ad trajiciendum
instruemus. Destinatur itaque parti secundae, doctrina de meliore et
perfectiore usu rationis in rerum inquisitione, et de auxiliis veris
intellectus: ut per hoc (quantum conditio humanitatis ac mortalitatis
patitur) exaltetur intellectus, et facultate amplificetur ad naturae
ardua et obscura superanda. Atque est ea quam adducimus ars (quam
Interpretationem Naturae appellare consuevimus) ex genere logicae; licet
plurimum, atque adeo immensum quiddam, intersit. Nam et ipsa illa logica
vulgaris auxilia et praesidia intellectui moliri ac parare profitetur:
et in hoc uno consentiunt. Differt autem plane a vulgari rebus praecipue
tribus: viz. ipso fine, ordine demonstrandi, et inquirendi initiis.</p>
<p>Nam huic nostrae scientiae finis proponitur, ut inveniantur non
argumenta sed artes, nec principiis consentanea sed ipsa principia, nec
rationes probabiles sed designationes et indicationes Operum. Itaque ex
intentione diversa diversus sequitur effectus. Illic enim adversarius
disputatione vincitur et constringitur; hic natura, opere.</p>
<p>Atque cum hujusmodi fine conveniunt demonstrationum ipsarum natura et
ordo. In logica enim vulgari opera fere universa circa Syllogismum
consumitur. De Inductione vero Dialectici vix serio cogitasse videntur;
levi mentione eam transmittentes, et ad disputandi formulas properantes.
At nos demonstrationem per syllogismum rejicimus, quod confusius agat,
et naturam emittat e manibus. Tametsi enim nemini dubium esse possit
quin, quae in medio termino conveniunt, ea et inter se conveniant (quod
est mathematicae cujusdam certitudinis): nihilominus hoc subest fraudis,
quod syllogismus ex propositionibus constet, propistiones ex verbis,
verba autem notionum tesserae et signa sint. Itaque si notiones ipsae
mentis (quae verborum quasi anima sunt, et totius hujusmodi structurae
ac fabricae basis) male ac temere a rebus abstractae, et vagae, nec
satis definitae et circumscriptae, denique multis modis vitiosae
fuerint, omnia ruunt. Rejicimus igitur syllogismum; neque id solum quoad
principia (ad quae nec illi eam adhibent) sed etiam quoad propositiones
medias, quas educit sane atque parturit utcunque syllogismus, sed operum
steriles et a practica remotas et plane quoad partem activam scientiarum
incompetentes. Quamvis igitur relinquamus syllogismo et hujusmodi
demonstrationibus famosis ac jactatis jurisdictionem in artes populares
et opinabiles (nil enim in hac parte movemus), tamen ad naturam rerum
Inductione per omnia, et tam ad minores propositiones quam ad majores,
utimur. Inductionem enim censemus eam esse demonstrandi formam, quae
sensum tuetur et naturam premit et operibus imminet ac fere
immiscetur.</p>
<p>Itaque ordo quoque demonstrandi plane invertitur. Adhuc enim res ita
geri consuevit; ut a sensu et particularibus primo loco ad maxime
generalia advoletur, tanquam ad polos fixos circa quos disputationes
vertantur; ab illis caetera per media deriventur: via certe
compendiaria, sed praecipiti, et ad naturam impervia, ad disputationes
vero proclivi et accommodata. At secundum nos, axiomata continenter et
gradatim excitantur, ut nonnisi postremo loco ad generalissima veniatur:
ea vero generalissima evadunt non notionalia, sed bene terminata, et
talia quae natura ut revera sibi notiora agnoscat, quaeque rebus
haereant in medullis.</p>
<p>At in forma ipsa quoque inductionis, et judicio quod per eam fit,
opus longe maximum movemus. Ea enim de qua dialectici loquuntur, quae
procedit per enumerationem simplicem, puerile quiddam est, et precario
concludit, et periculo ab instantia contradictoria exponitur, et
consueta tantum intuetur, nec exitum reperit.</p>
<p>Atqui opus est ad scientias inductionis forma tali, quae experientiam
solvat et separet, et per exclusiones ac rejectiones debitas necessario
concludat. Quod si judicium illud vulgatum dialecticorum tam operosum
fuerit, et tanta ingenia exercuerit; quanto magis laborandum est in hoc
altero, quod non tantum ex mentis penetralibus, sed etiam ex naturae
visceribus extrahitur?</p>
<p>Neque tamen hic finis. Nam fundamenta quoque scientiarum fortius
deprimimus et solidamus, atque initia inquirendi altius sumimus, quam
adhuc homines fecerunt: ea subjiciendo examini, quae logica vulgaris
tanquam fide aliena recipit. Etenim dialectici principia scientiarum a
scientiis singulis tanquam mutuo sumunt: rursus, notiones mentis primas
venerantur: postremo, informationibus immediatis sensus bene dispositi
acquiescunt. At nos logicam veram singulas scientiarum provincias majore
cum imperio quam penes ipsarum principia sit debere ingredi decrevimus,
atque illa ipsa principia putativa ad rationes reddendas compellere
quousque plane constent. Quod vero attinet ad notiones primas
intellectus; nihil est eoroum quae intellectus sibi permissus congessit,
quin nobis pro suspecto sit, nec ullo modo ratum, nisi novo judicio se
stiterit et secundum illud pronuntiatum fuerit. Quinetiam sensus ipsius
informationes multis modis excutimus. Sensus enim fallunt utique, sed et
errores suos indicant: verum errores praesto, indicia eorum longe petita
sunt.</p>
<p>Duplex autem est sensus culpa: aut enim destituit nos aut decipit.
Nam primo, plurimae sunt res quae sensum etiam recte dispositum nec ullo
modo impeditum effugiunt; aut subtilitate totius corporis, aut partium
minutiis, aut loci distantia, aut tarditate atque etiam velocitate
motus, aut familiaritate objecti, aut alias ob causas. Neque rursus, ubi
sensus rem tenet, prehensiones ejus admodum firmae sunt. Nam testimonium
et informatio sensus semper est ex analogia hominis, non ex analogia
universi: atque magno prorsus errore asseritur, sensum esse mensuram
rerum.</p>
<p>Itaque ut his occurratur, nos multo et fido ministerio auxilia sensui
undique conquisivimus et contraximus, ut destitutionibus substitutiones,
variationibus rectificationes suppeditentur. Neque id molimur tam
instrumentis quam experimentis. Etenim experimentorum longe major est
subtilitas quam sensus ipsius, licet instrumentis exquisitis adjuti; (de
iis loquimur experimentis, quae ad intentionem ejus quod quaeritur
perite et secundum artem excogitata et apposita sunt). Itaque
perceptioni sensus immediatae ac propriae non multum tribuimus: sed eo
rem deducimus, ut sensus tantum de experimento, experimentum de re
judicet. Quare existimamus nos sensus (a quo omnia in naturalibus
petenda sunt, nisi forte libeat insanire) antistites religiosos, et
oraculorum ejus non imperitos interpretes, nos praestitisse: ut alii
professione quadam, nos re ipsa, sensum tueri ac colere videamus. Atque
hujusmodi sunt ea quae ad lumen ipsum naturae ejusque accensionem et
immissionem paramus: quae per se sufficere possent, si intellectus
humanus aequus et instar tabulae abrasae esset. Sed cum mentes hominum
miris modis adeo obsessae sint ut ad veros rerum radios excipiendos
sincera et polita area prorsus desit, necessitas quaedam incumbit ut
etiam huic rei remedium quaerendum esse putemus.</p>
<p>Idola autem a quibus occupatur mens, vel Adscititia sunt vel Innata.
Adscititia vero immigrarunt in mentes hominum, vel ex philosophorum
placitis et sectis vel ex perversis legibus demonstrationum. At Innata
inhaerent naturae ipsius intellectus, qui ad errorem longe proclivior
esse deprehenditur quam sensus. Utcunque enim homines sibi placeant et
in admirationem mentis humanae ac fere adorationem ruant, illud
certissimum est: sicut speculum inaequale rerum radios ex figura et
sectione propria immutat, ita et mentem, cum a rebus per sensum patitur,
in notionibus suis expediendis et comminiscendis haud optima fide rerum
naturae suam naturam inserere et immiscere.</p>
<p>Atque priora illa duo Idolorum genera aegre, postrema vero haec nullo
modo, evelli possunt. Id tantum relinquitur, ut indicentur, atque ut vis
ista mentis insidiatrix notetur et convincatur; ne forte a destructione
veterum novi subinde errorum surculi ex ipsa mala complexione mentis
pullulent, eoque res recidat, ut errores non extinguantur se
permutentur; verum e contra ut illud tandem in aeternum ratum et fixum
sit, intellectum nisi per inductionem ejusque formam legitimam judicare
non posse. Itaque doctrina ista de expurgatione intellectus ut ipse ad
veritatem habilis sit, tribus redargutionibus absolvitur: redargutione
philosophiarum, redargutione demonstrationum, et redargutione rationis
humanae nativae. His vero explicatis, ac postquam demum patuerit quid
rerum natura, quid mentis natura ferat, existimamus nos thalamum Mentis
et Universi, pronuba divina bonitate, stravisse et ornasse. Epithalamii
autem votum sit, ut ex eo connubio auxilia humana et stirps inventorum
quae necessitates ac miserias hominum aliqua ex parte doment et
subigant, suscipiatur. Haec vero est operis pars secunda.</p>
<p>At vias non solum monstrare et munire, sed inire quoque consilium
est. Itaque tertia pars operis complectitur Phaenomena Universi; hoc
est, omnigenam experientiam, atque historiam naturalem ejus generis quae
possit esse ad condendam philosophiam fundamentalis. Neque enim
excellens aliqua demonstrandi via sive naturam interpretandi forma, ut
mentem ab errore et lapsu defendere ac sustinere, ita ei materiam ad
sciendum praebere et subministrare possit. Verum iis quibus non
conjicere et hariolari, sed invenire et scire propositum est, quique non
simiolas et fabulas mundorum comminisci, sed hujus ipsius veri mundi
naturam introspicere et velut dissecare in animo habent, omnia a rebus
ipsis petenda sunt. Neque huic labori et inquisitioni ac mundanae
perambulationi, ulla ingenii aut meditationis aut argumentationis
substitutio aut compensatio sufficere potest; non si omnia omnium
ingenia coierint. Itaque aut hoc prorsus habendum, aut negotium in
perpetuum deserendum. Ad hunc vero usque diem ita cum hominibus actum
est, ut minime mirum sit si natura sui copiam non faciat.</p>
<p>Nam primo, sensus ipsius informatio, et deserens et fallens:
observatio, indiligens et inaequalis et tanquam fortuita; traditio, vana
et ex rumore; practica, operi intenta et servilis; vis experimentalis,
caeca, stupida, vaga, et praerupta; denique historia naturalis, levis et
inops, vitiosissimam materiam intellectui ad philosophiam et scientias
congesserunt.</p>
<p>Deinde, praepostera argumentandi subtilitas et ventilatio serum rebus
plane desperatis tentatur remedium, nec negotium ullo modo restituit aut
errores separat. Itaque nulla spes majoris augmenti ac progressus sita
est, nisi in restauratione quadam scientiarum.</p>
<p>Hujus autem exordia omnino a naturali historia sumenda sunt, eaque
ipsa novi cujusdam generis et apparatus. Frustra enim fuerit speculum
expolire, si desint imagines; et plane materia idonea praeparanda est
intellectui, non solum praesidia fida comparanda. Differt vero rursus
historia nostra (quemadmodum logica nostra) ab ea quae habetur, multis
rebus: fine sive officio, ipsa mole et congerie, dein subtilitate, etiam
delectu et constitutione in ordine ad ea quae sequuntur.</p>
<p>Primo enim eam proponimus historiam naturalem, quae non tam aut rerum
varietate delectet aut praesenti experimentorum fructu juvet, quam lucem
inventioni causarum affundat, et philosophiae enutricandae primam mammam
praebeat. Licet enim opera atque activam scientiarum partem praecipue
sequamur, tamen messis tempus expectamus, nec muscum et segetem herbidam
demetere conamur. Satis enim scimus, axiomata recte inventa tota agmina
operum secum trahere, atque opera non sparsim sed confertim exhibere.
Intempestivum autem illum et puerilem affectum, ut pignora aliqua
novorum operum propere captentur, prorsus damnamus et amovemus, ceu
pomum Atalantae quod cursum retardat. Atque Historiae nostrae Naturalis
officium tale est.</p>
<p>Quoad congeriem vero, conficimus historiam non solum naturae liberae
ac solutae (cum scilicet illa sponte fluit et opus suum peragit), qualis
est historia coelestium, meteororum, terrae et maris, mineralium,
plantarum, animalium; sed multo magnis naturae constrictae et vexatae;
nempe, cum per artem et ministerium humanum de statu suo detruditur,
atque premitur et fingitur. Itaque omnia artium mechanicarum, omnia
operativae partis liberalium, omnia practicarum complurium quae in artem
propriam non coaluerunt, experimenta (quantum inquirere licuit et
quantum ad finem nostrum faciunt) perscribimus. Quin etiam (ut quod res
est eloquamur) fastum hominum et speciosa nil morati, multo plus et
operae et praesidii in hac parte quam in illa altera ponimus;
quandoquidem natura rerum magis se prodit per vexationes artis quam in
libertate propria.</p>
<p>Neque Corporum tantum historiam exhibemus; sed diligentiae insuper
nostrae esse putavimus, etiam Virtutum ipsarum (illarum dicimus quae
tanquam cardinales in natura censeri possint, et in quibus naturae
primordia plane constituuntur, utpote materiae primis passionibus ac
desideriis, viz. Denso, Raro, Calido, Frigido, Consistenti, Fluido,
Gravi, Levi, aliisque haud paucis) historiam seorsum comparare.</p>
<p>Enimvero ut de subtilitate dicamus, plane conquirimus genus
experimentorum longe subtilius et simplicius quam sunt ea quae
occurrunt. Complura enim a tenebris educimus et eruimus, quae nulli in
mentem venisset investigare, nisi qui certo et constanti tramite ad
inventionem causarum pergeret; cum in se nullius magnopere sint usus; ut
liquido appareat, ea non propter se quaesita esse; sed ita prorsus se
habeant illa ad res et opera quemadmodum literae alphabeti se habeant ad
orationem et verba; quae licet per se inutiles eaedem tamen omnis
sermonis elementa sunt.</p>
<p>In delectu autem narrationum et experimentorum melius hominibus
cavisse nos arbitramur, quam qui adhuc in historia naturali versati
sunt. Nam omnia fide oculata aut saltem perspecta, et summa quadam cum
severitate, recipimus; ita ut nil referatur auctum miraculi causa, sed
quae narramus a fabulis et vanitate casta et intemerata sint. Quinetiam
et recepta quaeque ac jactata mendacia (quae mirabili quodam neglectu
per saecula multa obtinuerunt et inveterata sunt) nominatim proscribimus
et notamus; ne scientiis amplius molesta sint. Quod enim prudenter
animadvertit quidam, fabulas et superstitiones et nugas quas nutriculae
pueris instillant, mentes eorum etiam serio depravare: ita eadem nos
movit ratio ut solliciti atque etiam anxii simus ne ab initio, cum
veluti infantiam philosophiae sub historia naturali tractemus et
curemus, illa alicui vanitati assuescat. At in omni experimento novo et
paulo subtiliore, licet (ut nobis videtur) certo ac probato, modum tamen
experimenti quo usi sumus aperte subjungimus; ut, postquam patefactum
sit quomodo singula nobis constiterint, videant homines quid erroris
subesse et adhaerere possit, atque ad probationes magis fidas et magis
exquistas (si quae sint) expergiscantur: denique ubique monita et
scrupulos et cautiones aspergimus, religione quadam et tanquam exorcismo
omnia phantasmata ejicientes ac cohibentes.</p>
<p>Postremo, cum nobis exploratum sit quantopere experientia et historia
aciem mentis humanae disgreget, et quam difficile sit (praesertim animis
vel teneris vel praeoccupatis) a principio cum natura consuescere,
adjungimus saepius observationes nostras, tanquam primas quasdam
conversiones et inclinationes ac veluti aspectus historiae ad
philosophiam; ut et pignoris loco hominibus sint eos in historiae
fluctibus perpetuo non detentos iri, utque cum ad opus intellectus
deveniatur omnia sint magis in procinctu. Atque per hujusmodi (qualem
describimus) Historiam Naturalem, aditum quendam fieri posse ad naturam
tutum et commodum, atque materiam intellectui praeberi probam et
praeparatam, censemus.</p>
<p>Postquam vero et intellectum fidissimis auxiliis se praesidiis
stipavimus, et justum divinorum operum exercitum severissimo delectu
comparavimus; nil amplius superesse videtur, nisi ut philosophiam ipsam
aggrediamur. Attamen in re tam ardua et suspensa, sunt quaedam quae
necessario videntur interponenda; partim docendi gratia, partim in usum
praesentem.</p>
<p>Horum primum est, ut exempla proponantur inquirendi et inveniendi
secundum nostram rationem ac viam, in aliquibus subjectis repraesentata:
sumendo ea potissimum subjecta quae et inter ea quae quaeruntur sunt
nobilissima et inter se maxime diversa; ut in unoquoque genere exemplum
non desit. Neque de iis exemplis loquimur quae singulis praeceptis ac
regulis illustrandi gratia adjiciuntur (hoc enim in secunda parte operis
abunde praestitimus); sed plane typos intelligimus et plasmata, quae
universum mentis processum atque inveniendi continuatam fabricam et
ordinem, in certis subjectis, iisque variis et insignibus, tanquam sub
oculos ponant. Etenim nobis in mentem venit, in mathematicis, astante
machina, sequi demonstrationem facilem et perspicuam; contra absque hac
commoditate, omnia videri involuta et, quam revera sunt, subtiliora.
Itaque hujusmodi exemplis quartam partem nostri operis attribuimus: quae
revera nil aliud est, quam secundae partis applicatio particularis et
explicata.</p>
<p>At quinta pars ad tempus tantum, donec reliqua perficiantur,
adhibetur; et tanquam foenus redditur, usque dum sors haberi possit.
Neque enim finem nostrum ita petimus occaecati, ut quae occurrunt in via
utilia negligamus. Quamobrem quintam partem operis ex iis conficimus
quae a nobis aut inventa aut probata aut addita sunt; neque id tamen ex
rationibus atque praescriptis interpretandi, sed ex eodem intellectus
usu quem alii in inquirendo et inveniendo adhibere consueverunt. Etenim
cum, ex perpetua nostra cum natura consuetudine, majora de
meditationibus nostris quam pro ingenii viribus speramus; tum poterunt
ista veluti tabernaculorum in via positorum vice fungi, ut mens ad
certiora contendens in iis paulisper acquiescat. Attamen testamur
interim, nos illis ipsis, quod ex vera interpretandi forma non sint
inventa aut probata, teneri minime velle. Istam vero judicii
suspensionem non est quod exhorreat quispiam, in doctrina quae non
simpliciter nil sciri posse, sed nil nisi certo ordine et certa via
sciri posse, asserit; atque interea tamen certos certitudinis gradus ad
usum et levamen constituit, donec mens in causarum explicatione
consistat. Neque enim illae ipsae scholae philosophorum qui Acatalepsiam
simpliciter tenuerunt inferiores fuere istis quae pronuntiandi licentiam
usurparunt. Illae tamen sensui et intellectui auxilia non paraverunt,
quod nos fecimus, sed fidem et authoritatem plane sustulerunt; quod
longe alia res est, et fere opposita.</p>
<p>Sexta tandem pars operis nostri (cui reliquae inserviunt ac
ministrant) eam demum recludit et proponit philosophiam, quae ex
hujusmodi (qualem ante docuimus et paravimus) inquisitione legitima et
casta et severa educitur et constituitur. Hanc vero postremam partem
perficere et ad exitum perducere, res est et supra vires et ultra spes
nostras collocata. Nos ei initia (ut speramus) non contemnenda, exitum
generis humani fortuna dabit, qualem forte homines in hoc rerum et
animorum statu haud facile animo capere aut metiri queant. Neque enim
agitur solum foelicitas contemplativa, sed vere res humanae et fortunae,
atque omnis operum potentia. Homo enim naturae minister et interpres
tantum facit et intelligit, quantum de naturae ordine, opere vel mente,
observaverit: nec amplius scit, aut potest. Neque enim ullae vires
causarum catenam solvere aut perfringere possint; neque natura aliter
quam parendo vincitur. Itaque intentiones geminae illae, humanae
scilicet Scientiae et Potentiae, vere in idem coincidunt; et frustratio
operum maxime fit ex ignoratione causarum.</p>
<p>Atque in eo sunt omnia, siquis oculos mentis a rebus ipsis nunquam
dejiciens, earum imagines plane ut sunt excipiat. Neque enim hoc siverit
Deus, ut phantasiae nostrae somnium pro exemplari mundi edamus: sed
potius benigne faveat, ut apocalypsim ac veram visionem vestigiorum et
sigillorum creatoris super creaturas scribamus.</p>
<p>Itaque Tu Pater, qui lucem visibilem primitias creaturae dedisti, et
lucem intellectualem ad fastigium operum tuorum in faciem hominis
inspirasti; opus hoc, quod a tua bonitate profectum tuam gloriam
repetit, tuere et rege. Tu postquam conversus es ad spectandum opera
quae fecerunt manus tuae, vidisti quod omnia essent bona valde; et
requievisti. At homo conversus ad opera quae fecerunt manus suae, vidit
quod omnia essent vanitas et vexatio spiritus; nec ullo modo requievit.
Quare si in operibus tuis sudabimus, facies nos visionis tuae et sabbati
tui participes. Supplices petimus, ut haec mens nobis constet; utque
novis eleemosynis, per manus nostras et aliorum quibus eandem mentem
largieris, familiam humanam dotatam velis.</p>
<p>PARS SECUNDA OPERIS,</p>
<p>QUAE DICITUR</p>
<p>NOVUM ORGANUM,</p>
<p>SIVE</p>
<p>INDICIA VERA</p>
<p>DE INTERPRETATIONE</p>
<p>NATURAE.</p>
<p>PRAEFATIO.</p>
<p>Qui de natura, tanquam de re explorata, pronuntiare ausi sunt, sive
hoc ex animi fiducia fecerint sive ambitiose et more professorio,
maximis illi philosophiam et scientias detrimentis affecere. Ut enim ad
fidem faciendam validi, ita etiam ad inquisitionem extinguendam et
abrumpendam efficaces fuerunt. Neque virtute propria tantum profuerunt,
quantum in hoc nocuerunt, quod aliorum virtutem corruperint et
perdiderint. Qui autem contrariam huic viam ingressi sunt atque nihil
prorsus sciri posse asseruerunt, sive ex sophistarum veterum odio sive
ex animi fluctuatione aut etiam ex quadam doctrinae copia in hanc
opinionem delapsi sint, certe non contemnendas ejus rationes adduxerunt;
veruntamen nec a veris initiis sententiam suam derivarunt, et, studio
quodam atque affectatione provecti, prorsus modum excesserunt. At
antiquiores ex Graecis (quorum scripta perierunt) inter pronuntiandi
jactantiam et Acatalepsiae desperationem prudentius se sustinuerunt:
atque de inquisitionis difficultate et rerum obscuritate saepius
querimonias et indignationes miscentes, et veluti fraenum mordentes,
tamen propositum urgere atque naturae se immiscere non destiterunt;
consentaneum (ut videtur) existimantes, hoc ipsum (videlicet utrum
aliquid sciri possit) non disputare, sed experiri. Et tamen illi ipsi,
impetu tantum intellectus usi, regulam non adhibuerunt, sed omnia in
acri meditatione et mentis volutatione et agitatione perpetua
posuerunt.</p>
<p>Nostra autem ratio, ut opere ardua, ita dictu facilis est. Ea enim
est, ut certitudinis gradus constituamus, sensum per reductionem quandam
tueamur, sed mentis opus quod sensum subsequitur plerunque rejiciamus;
novam autem et certam viam, ab ipsis sensuum perceptionibus, menti
aperiamus et muniamus. Atque hoc proculdubio viderunt et illi qui tantas
dialecticae partes tribuerunt. Ex quo liquet, illos intellectui
adminicula quaesivisse, mentis autem processum nativum et sponte
moventem, suspectum habuisse. Sed serum plane rebus perditis hoc
adhibetur remedium; postquam mens ex quotidiana vitae consuetudine, et
auditionibus et doctrinis inquinatis occupata, et vanissimis idolis
obsessa fuerit. Itaque ars illa dialecticae, sero (ut diximus) cavens,
neque rem ullo modo restituens, ad errores potius figendos quam ad
veritatem aperiendam valuit. Restat unica salus ac sanitas, ut opus
mentis universum de integro resumatur; ac mens, jam ab ipso principio,
nullo modo sibi permittatur, sed perpetuo regatur; ac res veluti per
machinas conficiatur. Sane si homines opera mechanica nudis manibus,
absque instrumentorum vi et ope, aggressi essent, quemadmodum opera
intellectualia nudis fere mentis viribus tractare non dubitarunt, parvae
admodum fuissent res quas movere et vincere potuissent, licet operas
enixas atque etiam conjunctas praestitissent. Atque si paulisper morari,
atque in hoc ipsum exemplum, veluti in speculum, intueri velimus;
exquiramus (si placet) si forte obeliscus aliquis magnitudine insignis
ad triumphi vel hujusmodi magnificentiae decus transferendus esset,
atque id homines nudis manibus aggrederentur, annon hoc magnae cujusdam
esse dementiae spectator quispiam rei sobrius fateretur? Quod si numerum
augerent operariorum, atque hoc modo se valere posse confiderent, annon
tanto magis? Sin autem delectum quendam adhibere vellent, atque
imbecilliores separare, et robustis tantum et vigentibus uti, atque hinc
saltem se voti compotes fore sperarent, annon adhuc eos impensius
delirare diceret? Quin etiam si hoc ipso non contenti, artem tandem
athleticam consulere statuerent, ac omnes deinceps manibus et lacertis
et nervis ex arte bene unctis et medicatis adesse juberent, annon
prorsus eos dare operam ut cum ratione quadam et prudentia insanirent,
clamaret? Atque homines tamen simili malesano impetu et conspiratione
inutili feruntur in intellectualibus; dum ab ingeniorum vel multitudine
et consensu vel excellentia et acumine magna sperant, aut etiam
dialectica (quae quaedam athletica censeri possit) mentis nervos
roborant; sed interim, licet tanto studio et conatu, (si quis vere
judicaverit) intellectum nudum applicare non desinunt. Manifestissimum
autem est, in omni opere magno, quod manus hominis praestat, sine
instrumentis et machinis, vires nec singulorum intendi nec omnium coire
posse.</p>
<p>Itaque ex his quae diximus praemissis, statuimus duas esse res de
quibus homines plane monitos volumus, ne forte illae eos fugiant aut
praetereant. Quarum prima hujusmodi est; fieri fato quodam (ut
existimamus) bono, ad extinguendas et depellendas contradictiones et
tumores animorum, ut et veteribus honor et reverentia intacta et
imminuta maneant, et nos destinata perficere et tamen modestiae nostrae
fructum percipere possimus. Nam nos, si profiteamur nos meliora afferre
quam antiqui, eandem quam illi viam ingressi, nulla verborum arte
efficere possimus, quin inducatur quaedam ingenii vel excellentiae vel
facultatis comparatio sive contentio; non ea quidem illicita aut nova; —
quidni enim possimus pro jure nostro (neque eo ipso alio, quam omnium)
si quid apud eos non recte inventum aut positum sit, reprehendere aut
notare? — sed tamen utcunque justa aut permissa, nihilominus impar
fortasse fuisset ea ipsa contentio, ob virium nostrarum modum. Verum
quum per nos illud agatur, ut alia omnino via intellectui aperiatur
illis intentata et incognita, commutata jam ratio est; cessant studium
et partes; nosque indicis tantummodo personam sustinemus, quod mediocris
certe est authoritatis, et fortunae cujusdam potius quam facultatis et
excellentiae. Atque haec moniti species ad personas pertinet; altera ad
res ipsas.</p>
<p>Nos siquidem de deturbanda ea quae nunc floret philosophia, aut si
quae alia sit aut erit hac emendatior aut auctior, minime laboramus.
Neque enim officimus, quin philosophia ista recepta, et aliae id genus,
disputationes alant, sermones ornent, ad professoria munera et vitae
civilis compendia adhibeantur et valeant. Quin etiam aperte significamus
et declaramus, eam quam nos adducimus philosophiam ad istas res admodum
utilem non futuram. Non praesto est, neque in transitu capitur, neque ex
praenotionibus intellectui blanditur, neque ad vulgi captum nisi per
utilitatem et effecta descendet.</p>
<p>Sint itaque (quod foelix faustumque sit utrique parti) duae
doctrinarum emanationes, ac duae dispensationes; duae similiter
contemplantium sive philosophantium tribus ac veluti cognationes; atque
illae neutiquam inter se inimicae aut alienae, sed foederatae et mutuis
auxiliis devinctae: sit denique alia scientias colendi, alia inveniendi
ratio. Atque quibus prima potior et acceptior est, ob festinationem, vel
vitae civilis rationes, vel quod illam alteram ob mentis infirmitatem
capere et complecti non possint (id quod longe plurimis accidere necesse
est), optamus ut iis foeliciter et ex voto succedat quod agunt, atque ut
quod sequuntur teneant. Quod si cui mortalium cordi et curae sit, non
tantum inventis haerere atque iis uti, sed ad ulteriora penetrate; atque
non disputando adversarium, sed opere naturam vincere; denique, non
belle et probabiliter opinari, sed certo et ostensive scire; tales,
tanquam veri scientiarum filii, nobis (si videbitur) se adjungant; ut
omissis naturae atriis, quae infiniti contriverunt, aditus aliquando ad
interiora patefiat. Atque ut melius intelligamur, utque illud ipsum quod
volumus ex nominibus impositis magis familiariter occurrat, altera ratio
sive via Anticipatio Mentis, altera Interpretatio Naturae, a nobis
appellari consuevit.</p>
<p>Est etiam quod petendum videtur. Nos certe cogitationem suscepimus et
curam adhibuimus, ut quae a nobis proponentur non tantum vera essent,
sed etiam ad animos hominum (licet miris modis occupatos et interclusos)
non incommode aut aspere accederent. Veruntamen aequum est, ut ab
hominibus impetremus (in tanta praesertim doctrinarum et scientiarum
restauratione) ut qui de hisce nostris aliquid, sive ex sensu proprio,
sive ex authoritatum turba, sive ex demonstrationum formis (quae nunc
tanquam leges quaedam judicialis invaluerunt), statuere aut existimare
velit, ne id in transitu et velut aliud agendo facere se posse speret;
sed ut rem pernoscat; nostram, quam describimus et munimus, viam ipse
paullatim tentet; subtilitati rerum quae in experientia signata est
assuescat; pravos denique atque alte haerentes mentis habitus tempestiva
et quasi legitima mora corrigat; atque tum demum (si placuerit) postquam
in potestate sua esse coeperit, judicio suo utatur.</p>

<p>Generationes mentis et manus numerosae admodum videntur in libris et

<p>Etiam opera, quae jam inventa sunt, casui debentur et experientiae,

<p>Sicut scientiae, quae nunc habentur, inutiles sunt ad inventionem

</ol>
<p>Logica, quae in usu est, ad errores (qui in notionibus vulgaribus

<ol start="13" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Syllogismus ad principia scientiarum non adhibetur, ad media axiomata
frustra adhibetur, cum sit subtilitati naturae longe impar. Assensum
itaque constringit, non res.</p>
<ol start="14" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Syllogismus ex propositionibus constat, propositiones ex verbis,
verba notionum tesserae sunt. Itaque si notiones ipsae (id quod basis
rei est) confusae sint, et temere a rebus abstractae; nihil in iis, quae
superstruuntur, est firmitudinis. Itaque spes est una in inductione
vera.</p>
<ol start="15" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In notionibus nil sani est, nec in logicis, nec in physicis: non
substantia, non qualitas, agere, pati, ipsum esse, bonae notiones sunt;
multo minus grave, leve, densum, tenue, humidum, siccum , generatio,
corruptio, attrahere, fugare, elementum, materia, forma, et id genus;
sed omnes phantasticae et male terminatae.</p>
<ol start="16" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Notiones infimarum specierum, hominis, canis, columbae, et
prehensionum immediatarum sensus, calidi, frigidi, albi, nigri, non
fallunt magnopere; quae tamen ipsae a fluxu materiae et commissione
rerum quandoque confunduntur; reliquae omnes (quibus homines hactenus
usi sunt) aberrationes sunt, nec debitis modis a rebus abstractae et
excitatae.</p>
<ol start="17" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Nec minor est libido et aberratio in constituendis axiomatibus, quam
in notionibus abstrahendis; idque in ipsis principiis, quae ab

propositionibus inferioribus, quae educit syllogismus.</p>
<ol start="18" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Quae adhuc inventa sunt in scientiis, ea hujusmodi sunt, ut
notionibus vulgaribus fere subjaceant: ut vero ad interiora et remotiora
naturae penetretur, necesse est ut tam notiones quam axiomata magis
certa et munita via a rebus abstrahantur, atque omnino melior et certior
intellectus adoperatio in usum veniat.</p>
<ol start="19" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Duae viae sunt, atque esse possunt, ad inquirendam et inveniendam
veritatem. Altera a sensu et particularibus advolat ad axiomata maxime
generalia, atque ex iis principiis eorumque immota veritate judicat et
invenit axiomata media; atque haec via in usu est. Altera a sensu et
particularibus excitat axiomata, ascendendo continenter et gradatim, ut
ultimo loco perveniatur ad maxime generalia; quae via vera est, sed
intentata.</p>
<ol start="20" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Eandem ingreditur viam (priorem scilicet) intellectus sibi permissus,
quam facit ex ordine dialecticae. Gestit enim mens exsilire ad magis
generalia, ut acquiescat; et post parvam moram fastidit experientiam:
sed haec mala demum aucta sunt a dialectica ob pompas disputationum.</p>
<ol start="21" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectus sibi permissus, in ingenio sobrio et patiente et gravi
(praesertim si a doctrinis receptis non impediatur), tentat nonnihil
illam alteram viam, quae recta est, send exiguo profectu; cum
intellectus, nisi regatur et juvetur, res inaequalis sit, et omnino
inhabilis ad superandam rerum obscuritatem.</p>
<ol start="22" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Utraque via orditur a sensu et particularibus, et acquiescit in
maxime generalibus: sed immensum quiddam discrepant; cum altera
perstringat tantum experientiam et particularia cursim; altera in iis
rite et ordine versetur; altera rursus jam a principio constituat
generalia quaedam abstracta et inutilia; altera gradatim exsurgat ad ea
quae revera naturae sunt notiora.</p>
<ol start="23" type="I">

<p>Non leve quiddam interest inter humanae mentis idola, et divinae
mentis ideas; hoc est, inter placita quaedam inania, et veras signaturas
atque impressiones factas in creaturis, prout inveniuntur.</p>
<ol start="24" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Nullo modo fieri potest, ut axiomata per argumentationem constituta
ad inventionem novorum operum valeant; quia subtilitas naturae
subtilitatem argumentandi multis partibus superat. Sed axiomata, a
particularibus rite et ordine abstrata, nova particularia rursus facile
indicant et designant; itaque scientias reddunt activas. XXV.</p>
<p>Axiomata, quae in usu sunt, ex tenui et manipulari experientia, et
paucis particularibus, quae ut plurimum occurrunt, fluxere; et sunt fere
ad mensuram eorum facta et extensa: ut nil mirum sit, si ad nova
particularia non ducant. Quod si forte instantia aliqua, non prius
animadversa aut cognita, se offerat, axioma distinctione aliqua frivola
salvatur, ubi emendari ipsum verius foret.</p>

<p>Rationem humanam, qua utimur ad naturam, anticipationes naturae (quia
res temeraria est et praematura), at illam rationem quae debitis modis
elicitur a rebus, interpretationem naturae, docendi gratia, vocare
consuevimus.</p>
<ol start="27" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Anticipationes satis firmae sunt ad consensum; quandoquidem, si
homines etiam insanirent ad unum modum et conformiter, illi satis bene
inter se congruere possent.</p>
<ol start="28" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Quin longe validiores sunt ad subeundum assensum anticipationes, quam
interpretationes; quia ex paucis collectae, iisque maxime quae
familiariter occurrunt, intellectum statim perstringunt, et phantasiam
implent; ubi contra, interpretationes, ex rebus admodum variis et multum
distantibus sparsim collectae, intellectum subito percutere non possunt;
ut necesse sit eas, quoad opiniones, duras et absonas, fere instar
mysteriorum fidei videri.</p>
<ol start="29" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In scientiis, quae in opinionibus et placitis fundatae sunt, bonus
est usus anticipationum et dialecticae; quando opus est assensum
subjugare, non res.</p>
<ol start="30" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Non, si omnia omnium aetatum ingenia coierint, et labores contulerint
et transmiserint, progressus magnus fieri poterit in scientiis per
anticipationes: quia errores radicales, et in prima digestione mentis,
ab excellentia functionum et remediorum sequentium non curantur.</p>
<ol start="31" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Frustra magnum expectatur augmentum in scientiis ex superinductione
et insitione novorum super vetera; sed instauratio facienda est ab imis
fundamentis, nisi libeat perpetuo circumvolvi in orbem, cum exili et
quasi contemnendo progressu.</p>
<ol start="32" type="I">

<p>Antiquis auctoribus suus constat honos, atque adeo omnibus; quia non
ingeniorum aut facultatum inducitur comparatio, sed viae; nosque non

<ol start="33" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Nullum (dicendum enim est aperte) recte fieri potest judicium nec de
via nostra, nec de iis quae secundum eam inventa sunt, per
anticipationes (rationem scilicet quae in usu est), quia non postulandum
est ut ejus rei judicio stetur, quae ipsa in judicium vocatur.</p>

(docendi gratia) nomina imposuimus; ut primum genus, idola tribus;
secundum, idola specus; tertium, idola fori; quartum, idola theatri,
vocentur.</p>
<ol start="40" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Excitatio notionum et axiomatum per inductionem veram est certe
proprium remedium ad idola arcenda et summovenda; sed tamen indicatio
idolorum magni est usus. Doctrina enim de idolis similiter se habet ad
interpretationem naturae, sicut doctrina de sophisticis elenchis ad
dialecticam vulgarem.</p>
<ol start="41" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Idola tribus sunt fundata in ipsa natura humana, atque in ipsa tribu
seu gente hominum. Falso enim asseritur, sensum humanum esse mensuram
rerum; quin contra, omnes perceptiones, tam sensus quam mentis, sunt ex
analogia hominis, non ex analogia universi. Estque intellectus humanus
instar speculi inaequalis ad radios rerum, qui suam naturam naturae
rerum immiscet, eamque distorquet et inficit.</p>
<ol start="42" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Idola specus sunt idola hominis individui. Habet enim unusquisque
(praeter aberrationes naturae humanae in genere) specum sive cavernam
quandam individuam, quae lumen naturae frangit et corrumpit: vel propter
naturam cujusque propriam et singularem; vel propter educationem et
conversationem cum aliis; vel propter lectionem librorum, et
authoritates eorum quos quisque colit et miratur; vel propter
differentias impressionum, prout occurrunt in animo praeoccupato et
praedisposito, aut in animo aequo et sedato, vel ejusmodi: ut plane
spiritus humanus (prout disponitur in hominibus singulis) sit res varia,
et omnino perturbata, et quasi fortuita. Unde bene Heraclitus, homines
scientias quaerere in minoribus mundis, et non in majore sive
communi.</p>
<ol start="43" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sunt etiam idola tanquam ex contractu et societate humani generis ad
invicem, quae idola fori, propter hominum commercium et consortium,
appellamus. Homines enim per sermones sociantur; at verba ex captu vulgi
imponuntur. Itaque mala et inepta verborum impositio miris modis
intellectum obsidet. Neque definitiones aut explicationes, quibus
homines docti se munire et vindicare in nonnullis consueverunt, rem ullo
modo restituunt. Sed verba plane vim faciunt intellectui, et omnia
turbant; et homines ad inanes et innumeras controversias et commenta
deducunt.</p>
<ol start="44" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sunt denique idola, quae immigrarunt in animos hominum ex diversis
dogmatibus philosophiarum, ac etiam ex perversis legibus
demonstrationum; quae idola theatri nominamus; quia quot philosophiae
receptae aut inventae sunt, tot fabulas productas et actas censemus,
quae mundos effecerunt fictitios et scenicos. Neque de his quae jam
habentur, aut etiam de veteribus philosophiis et sectis tantum loquimur,
cum complures aliae ejusmodi fabulae componi et concinnari possint;
quandoquidem errorum prorsus diversorum causae sint nihilominus fere
communes. Neque rursus de philosophiis universalibus tantum hoc
intelligimus, sed etiam de principiis et axiomatibus compluribus
scientiarum, quae ex traditione et fide et neglectu invaluerunt. Verum
de singulis istis generibus idolorum, fusius et distinctius dicendum
est, ut intellectui humano cautum sit.</p>
<ol start="45" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectus humanus ex proprietate sua facile supponit majorem
ordinem et aequalitatem in rebus, quam invenit: et cum multa sint in
natura monodica, et plena imparitatis, tamen affingit parallela, et
correspondentia, et relativa, quae non sunt. Hinc commenta illa, in
coelestibus omnia moveri per circulos perfectos, lineis spiralibus et
draconibus (nisi nomine tenus) prorsus rejectis. Hinc elementum ignis
cum orbe suo introductum est ad constituendum quaternionem cum reliquis
tribus, quae subjiciuntur sensui. Etiam elementis (quae vocant)
imponitur ad placitum decupla proportio excessus in raritate ad invicem;
et hujusmodi somnia. Neque vanitas ista tantum valet in dogmatibus,
verum etiam in notionibus simplicibus.</p>
<ol start="46" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectus humanus in iis quae semel placuerunt (aut quia recepta
sunt et credita, aut quia delectant), alia etiam omnia trahit ad
suffragationem et consensum cum illis: et licet major sit instantiarum
vis et copia, quae occurrunt in contrarium; tamen eas aut non observat,
aut contemnit, aut distinguendo summovet et rejicit, non sine magno et
pernicioso praejudicio, quo prioribus illis syllepsibus authoritas
maneat inviolata. Itaque recte respondit ille, qui, cum suspensa tabula
in templo ei monstraretur eorum qui vota solverant, quod naufragii
periculo elapsi sint, atque interrogando premeretur, anne tum quidem
Deorum numen agnosceret, quaesivit denuo, At ubi sunt illi depicti qui
post vota nuncupata perierint? Eadem ratio est fere omnis
superstitionis, ut in astrologicis, in somniis, ominibus, nemesibus, et
hujusmodi; in quibus homines delectati hujusmodi vanitatibus advertunt
eventus, ubi emplentur; ast ubi fallunt, licet multo frequentius, tamen
negligunt et praetereunt. At longe subtilius serpit hoc malum in
philosophiis et scientiis; in quibus quod semel placuit, reliqua (licet
multo firmiora et potiora) inficit, et in ordinem redigit. Quinetiam
licet abfuerit ea, quam diximus, delectatio et vanitas, is tamen humano
intellectui error est proprius et perpetuus, ut magis moveatur et
excitetur affirmativis, quam negativis; cum rite et ordine aequum se
utrique praebere debeat; quin contra, in omni axiomate vero
constituendo, major est vis instantiae negativae.</p>
<ol start="47" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectus humanus illis, quae simul et subito mentem ferire et
subire possunt, maxime movetur; a quibus phantasia impleri et inflari
consuevit: reliqua vero modo quodam, licet imperceptibili, ita se habere
fingit et supponit, quomodo se habent pauca illa quibus mens obsidetur;
ad illum vero transcursum ad instantias remotas et heterogeneas, per
quas axiomata tanquam igne probantur, tardus omnino intellectus est, et
inhabilis, nisi hoc illi per duras leges et violentum imperium
imponatur.</p>
<ol start="48" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Gliscit intellectus humanus, neque consistere aut acquiescere potis
est, sed ulterius petit; at frustra. Itaque incogitabile est ut sit
aliquid extremum aut extimum mundi, sed semper quasi necessario occurrit
ut sit aliquid ulterius. Neque rursus cogitari potest quomodo aeternitas
defluxerit ad hunc diem; cum distinctio illa, quae recipi consuevit,
quod sit infinitum a parte ante, et a parte post, nullo modo constare
possit; quia inde sequeretur, quod sit unum infinitum alio infinito
majus, atque ut consumatur infinitum, et vergat ad finitum. Similis est
subtilitas de lineis semper divisibilibus, ex impotentia cogitationis.
At majore cum pernicie intervenit haec impotentia mentis in inventione
causarum: nam cum maxime universalia in natura positiva esse debeant,
quemadmodum inveniuntur, neque sunt revera causabilia; tamen intellectus
humanus, nescius acquiescere, adhuc appetit notiora. Tum vero, ad
ulteriora tendens, ad proximiora recidit, videlicet ad causas finales,
quae sunt plane ex natura hominis, potius quam universi: atque ex hoc
fonte philosophiam miris modis corruperunt. Est autem aeque imperiti et
leviter philosophantis, in maxime universalibus causam requirere, ac in
subordinatis et subalternis causam non desiderare.</p>
<ol start="49" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectus humanus luminis sicci non est; sed recipit infusionem a
voluntate et affectibus, id quod generat ad quod vult scientias: quod
enim mavult homo verum esse, id potius credit. Rejicit itaque
difficilia, ob inquirendi impatientiam; sobria, quia coarctant spem;
altiora naturae, propter superstitionem; lumen experientiae, propter
arrogantiam et fastum, ne videatur mens versari in vilibus et fluxis;
paradoxa, propter opinionem vulgi; denique innumeris modis, iisque
interdum imperceptibilibus, affectus intellectum imbuit et inficit.</p>
<ol start="12" type="A">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At longe maximum impedimentum et aberratio intellectus humani
provenit a stupore et incompetentia et fallaciis sensuum; ut ea, quae
sensum feriunt, illis, quae sensum immediate non feriunt, licet
potioribus, praeponderent. Itaque contemplatio fere desinit cum aspectu;
adeo ut rerum invisibilium exigua aut nulla sit observatio. Itaque omnis
operatio spirituum in corporibus tangibilibus inclusorum latet, et
homines fugit. Omnis etiam subtilior meta schematismus in partibus rerum
crassiorum (quem vulgo alterationem vocant, cum sit revera latio per
minima) latet similiter: et tamen nisi duo ista, quae diximus, explorata
fuerint et in lucem producta, nihil magni fieri potest in natura quoad
opera. Rursus ipsa natura aeris communis et corporum omnium, quae aerem
tenuitate superant (quae plurima sunt), fere incognita est. Sensus enim
per se res infirma est, et aberrans: neque organa ad amplificandos
sensus aut acuendos multum valent; sed omnis verior interpretatio
naturae conficitur per instantias, et experimenta idonea et apposita;
ubi sensus de experimento tantum, experimentum de natura et re ipsa
judicat.</p>
<ol start="51" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectus humanus fertur ad abstracta propter naturam propriam;
atque ea, quae fluxa sunt, fingit esse constantia. Melius autem est
naturam secare, quam abstrahere; id quod Democriti schola fecit, quae
magis penetravit in naturam, quam reliquae. Materia potius considerari
debet, et ejus schematismi, et meta-schematismi, atque actus purus, et
lex actus sive motus; formae enim commenta animi humani sunt, nisi
libeat leges illas actus formas appellare.</p>
<ol start="52" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Hujusmodi itaque sunt idola, quae vocamus idola tribus; quae ortum
habent aut ex aequalitate substantiae spiritus humani; aut ex
praeoccupatione ejus; aut ab angustiis ejus; aut ab inquieto motu ejus;
aut ab infusione affectuum; aut ab incompetentia sensuum; aut ab
impressionis modo.</p>
<ol start="53" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Idola specus ortum habent ex propria cujusque natura et animi et
corporis; atque etiam ex educatione, et consuetudine, et fortuitis. Quod
genus, licet sit varium et mulitplex, tamen ea proponemus, in quibus
maxima cautio est, quaeque plurimum valent ad polluendum intellectum, ne
sit purus.</p>
<ol start="54" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Adamant homines scientias et contemplationes particulares; aut quia
authores et inventores se earum credunt; aut quia plurimum in illis
operae posuerunt, iisque maxime assueverunt. Hujusmodi vero homines, si
ad philosophiam et contemplationes universales se contulerint, illas ex
prioribus phantasiis detorquent, et corrumpunt; id quod maxime
conspicuum cernitur in Aristotele, qui naturalem suam philosophiam
logicae suae prorsus mancipavit, ut eam fere inutilem et contentiosam
reddiderit. Chemicorum autem genus, ex paucis experimentis fornacis,
philosophiam constituerunt phantasticam, et ad pauca spectantem:
quinetiam Gilbertus, postquam in contemplationibus magnetis se
laboriosissime exercuisset, confinxit statim philosophiam consentaneam
rei apud ipsum praepollenti.</p>
<ol start="55" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Maximum et velut radicale discrimen ingeniorum, quoad philosophiam et
scientias, illud est; quod alia ingenia sint fortiora et aptiora ad
notandas rerum differentias; alia, ad notandas rerum similitudines.
Ingenia enim constantia et acuta figere contemplationes, et morari, et
haerere in omni subtilitate differentiarum possunt: ingenia autem
sublimia et discursiva etiam tenuissimas et catholicas rerum
similitudines et agnoscunt et componunt: utrumque autem ingenium facile
labitur in excessum, prensando aut gradus rerum, aut umbras.</p>
<ol start="56" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Reperiuntur ingenia alia in admirationem antiquitatis, alia in amorem
et amplexum novitatis effusa; pauca vero ejus temperamenti sunt, ut
modum tenere possint, quin aut quae recte posita sunt ab antiquis
convellant, aut ea contemnant quae recte afferuntur a novis. Hoc vero
magno scientiarum et philosophiae detrimento fit, quum studia potius
sint antiquitatis et novitatis, quam judicia: veritas autem non a
felicitate temporis alicujus, quae res varia est; sed a lumine naturae
et experientiae, quod aeternum est, petenda est. Itaque abneganda sunt
ista studia; et videndum, ne intellectus ab illis ad consensum
abripiatur.</p>
<ol start="57" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Contemplationes naturae et corporum in simplicitate sua intellectum
frangunt et comminuunt; contemplationes vero naturae et corporum in
compositione et configuratione sua intellectum stupefaciunt et solvunt.
Id optime cernitur in schola Leucippi et Democriti, collata cum reliquis
philosophiis. Illa enim ita versatur in particulis rerum, ut fabricas
fere negligat; reliquae autem ita fabricas intuentur attonitae, ut ad
simplicitatem naturae non penetrent: itaque alternandae sunt
contemplationes istae, et vicissim sumendae; ut intellectus reddatur
simul penetrans et capax; et evitentur ea, quae diximus, incommoda,
atque idola ex iis provenientia.</p>
<ol start="58" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Talis itaque esto prudentia contemplativa in arcendis et summovendis
idolis specus; quae aut ex praedominantia, aut ex excessu compositionis
et divisionis, aut ex studiis erga tempora, aut ex objectis largis et
minutis, maxime ortum habent. Generaliter autem pro suspecto habendum
unicuique rerum naturam contemplanti quicquid intellectum suum
potissimum capit et detinet; tantoque major adhibenda in hujusmodi
placitis est cautio, ut intellectus servetur aequus et purus.</p>
<ol start="59" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At idola fori omnium molestissima sunt; quae ex foedere verborum et
nominum se insinuarunt in intellectum. Credunt enim homines, rationem
suam verbis imperare. Sed fit etiam ut verba vim suam super intellectum
retorqueant et reflectant; quod philosophiam et scientias reddidit
sophisticas et inactivas. Verba autem plerunque ex captu vulgi induntur,
atque per lineas vulgari intellectui maxime conspicuas res secant. Quum
autem intellectus acutior, aut observatio diligentior, eas lineas
transferre velit, ut illae sint magis secundum naturam; verba
obstrepunt. Unde fit, ut magnae et solennes disputationes hominum
doctorum saepe in controversias circa verba et nomina desinant; a quibus
(ex more et prudentia mathematicorum) incipere consultius foret, easque
per definitiones in ordinem redigere. Quae tamen definitiones, in
naturalibus et materiatis, huic malo mederi non possunt; quoniam et
ipsae definitiones ex verbis constant, et verba gignunt verba: adeo ut
necesse sit ad instantias particulares, earumque series et ordines
recurrere; ut mox dicemus, quum ad modum et rationem constituendi
notiones et axiomata deventum fuerit.</p>
<ol start="60" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Idola, quae per verba intellectui imponuntur, duorum generum sunt;
aut enim sunt rerum nomina, quae non sunt (quemadmodum enim sunt res,
quae nomine carent per inobservationem; ita sunt et nomina, quae carent
rebus, per suppositionem phantasticam), aut sunt nomina rerum, quae
sunt, sed confusa et male terminata, et temere et inaequaliter a rebus
abstracta. Prioris generis sunt, fortuna, primum mobile, planetarum
orbes, elementum ignis, et hujusmodi commenta, quae a vanis et falsis
theoriis ortum habent. Atque hoc genus idolorum facilius ejicitur, quia
per constantem abnegationem et antiquationem theoriarum exterminari
possunt.</p>
<p>At alterum genus perplexum est, et alte haerens; quod ex mala et
imperita abstractione excitatur. Exempli gratia, accipiatur aliquod
verbum (humidum, si placet), et videamus quomodo sibi constent quae per
hoc verbum significantur: et invenietur verbum istud, humidum, nihil
aliud quam nota confusa diversarum actionum, quae nullam constantiam aut
reductionem patiuntur. Significat enim et quod circa aliud corpus facile
se circumfundit; et quod in se est indeterminabile, nec consistere
potest; et quod facile cedit undique; et quod facile se dividit et
dispergit; et quod facile se unit et colligit; et quod facile fluit et
in motu ponitur; et quod alteri corpori facile adhaeret, idque
madefacit; et quod facile reducitur in liquidum, sive colliquatur, cum
antea consisteret. Itaque quum ad hujus nominis praedicationem et
impositionem ventum sit; si alia accipias, flamma humida est; si alia
accipias, aer humidus non est; si alia, pulvis minutus humidus est; si
alia, vitrum humidum est: ut facile appareat istam notionem ex aqua
tantum et communibus et vulgaribus liquoribus, absque ulla debita
verificatione, temere abstractam esse.</p>
<p>In verbis autem gradus sunt quidam pravitatis et erroris. Minus
vitiosum genus est nominum substantiae alicujus, praesertim specierum
infirmarum, et bene deductarum (nam notio cretae, luti, bona; terrae,
mala): vitiosius genus est actionum, ut generare, corrumpere, alterare:
vitiosissimum qualitatum (exceptis objectis sensus immediatis), ut
gravis, levis, tenuis, densi, etc.; et tamen in omnibus istis fieri non
potest, quin sint aliae notiones aliis paulo meliores, prout in sensum
humanum incidit rerum copia.</p>
<ol start="61" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At idola theatri innata non sunt, nec occulto insinuata in
intellectum; sed ex fabulis theoriarum, et perversis legibus
demonstrationum, plane indita et recepta. In his autem confutationes
tentare et suscipere consentaneum prorsus non est illis, quae a nobis
dicta sunt. Quum enim nec de principiis consentiamus, nec de
demonstrationibus, tollitur omnis argumentatio. Id vero bono fit fato,
ut antiquis suus constet honos. Nihil enim illis detrahitur, quum de via
omnino quaestio sit. Claudus enim (ut dicitur) in via antevertit
cursorem extra viam. Etiam illud manifesto liquet, currenti extra viam,
quo habilior sit et velocior, eo majorem contingere aberrationem.</p>
<p>Nostra vero inveniendi scientias ea est ratio, ut non multum
ingeniorum acumini et robori relinquatur; sed quae ingenia et
intellectus fere exaequet. Quemadmodum enim ad hoc ut linea recta fiat,
aut circulus perfectus describatur, multum est in constantia et
exercitatione manus, si fiat ex vi manus propria, sin autem adhibeatur
regula, aut circinus, parum aut nihil; omnino similis est nostra ratio.
Licet autem confutationum particularium nullus sit usus; de sectis tamen
et generibus hujusmodi theoriarum nonnihil dicendum est; atque etiam
paulo post de signis exterioribus, quod se male habeant; et postremo de
causis tantae infelicitatis et tam diuturni et generalis in errore
consensus; ut ad vera minus difficilis sit aditus, et intellectus
humanus volentius expurgetur et idola dimittat.</p>
<ol start="62" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Idola theatri, sive theoriarum, multa sunt, et multo plura esse
possunt, et aliquando fortasse erunt. Nisi enim per multa jam saecula
hominum ingenia circa religionem et theologiam occupata fuissent; atque
etiam politiae civiles (praesertim monarchiae) ab istiusmodi
novitatibus, etiam in contemplationibus, essent aversae; ut cum periculo
et detrimento fortunarum suarum in illas homines incumbant, non solum
praemio destituti, sed etiam contemptui et invidiae expositi; complures
aliae proculdubio philosophiarum et theoriarum sectae, similes illis,
quae magna varietate olim apud Graecos floruerunt introductae fuissent.
Quemadmodum enim super phaenomena aetheris plura themata coeli confingi
possunt; similiter, et multo magis, super phaenomena philosophiae
fundari possunt et constitui varia dogmata. Atque hujusmodi theatri
fabulae habent etiam illud, quod in theatro poetarum usu venit; ut
narrationes fictae ad scenam narrationibus ex historia veris
concinniores sint et elegantiores, et quales quis magis vellet.</p>
<p>In genere autem, in materiam philosophiae sumitur aut multum ex
paucis, aut parum ex multis; ut utrinque philosophia super experientiae
et naturalis historiae nimis angustam basin fundata sit, atque ex
paucioribus, quam par est, pronunciet. Rationale enim genus
philosophantium ex experientia arripiunt varia et vulgaria, eaque neque
certo comperta, nec diligenter examinata et pensitata; reliqua in
meditatione atque ingenii agitatione ponunt.</p>
<p>Est et aliud genus philosophantium, qui in paucis experimentis sedulo
et accurate elaborarunt, atque inde philosophias educere et confingere
ausi sunt; reliqua miris modis ad ea detorquentes.</p>
<p>Est et tertium genus eorum, qui theologiam et traditiones ex fide et
veneratione immiscent; inter quos vanitas nonnullorum ad petendas et
derivandas scientias a spiritibus scilicet et geniis deflexit; ita ut
stirps errorum et philosophia falsa genere triplex sit: sophistica,
empirica, et superstitiosa.</p>
<ol start="63" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Primi generis exemplum in Aristotele maxime conspicuum est, qui
philosophiam naturalem dialectica sua corrupit: quum mundum ex
categoriis effecerit; animae humanae, nobilissimae substantiae, genus ex
vocibus secundae intentionis tribuerit; negotium densi et rari, per quod
corpora subeunt majores et minores dimensiones sive spatia, per frigidam
distinctionem actus et potentiae transegerit; motum singulis corporibus
unicum et proprium, et, si participent ex alio motu, id aliunde moveri,
asseruerit: et innumera alia, pro arbitrio suo, naturae rerum
imposuerit: magis ubique sollicitus quomodo quis respondendo se
explicet, et aliquid reddatur in verbis positivum, quam de interna rerum
veritate; quod etiam optime se ostendit in comparatione philosophiae
ejus ad alias philosophias quae apud Graecos celebrabantur. Habent enim
homoiomera Anaxagorae, atomi Leucippi et Democriti, coelum et terra
Parmenidis, lis et amicitia Empedoclis, resolutio corporum in adiaphoram
naturam ignis et replicatio eorundem ad densum Heracliti, aliquid ex
philosopho naturali; et rerum naturam, et experientiam, et corpora
sapiunt; ubi Aristotelis physica nihil aliud quam dialecticae voces
plerunque sonet: quam etiam in metaphysicis sub solenniore nomine, et ut
magis scilicet realis, non nominalis, retractavit. Neque illud quenquam
moveat, quod in libris ejus De animalibus, et in Problematibus, et in
aliis suis tractatibus, versatio frequens sit in experimentis. Ille enim
prius decreverat, neque experientiam ad constituenda decreta et axiomata
rite consuluit; sed postquam pro arbitrio suo decrevisset, experientiam
ad sua placita tortam circumducit et captivam; ut hoc etiam nomine magis
accusandus sit, quam sectatores ejus moderni (scholasticorum
philosophorum genus) qui experientiam omnino deseruerunt.</p>
<ol start="64" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At philosophiae genus empiricum placita magis deformia et monstrosa
educit, quam sophisticum aut rationale genus; quia non in luce notionum
vulgarium (quae licet tenuis sit et superficialis, tamen est quodammodo
universalis, et ad multa pertinens) sed in paucorum experimentorum
angustiis et obscuritate fundatum est. Itaque talis philosophia illis,
qui in hujusmodi experimentis quotidie versantur atque ex ipsis
phantasiam contaminarunt, probabilis videtur et quasi certa; caeteris,
incredibilis et vana. Cujus exemplum notabile est in chemicis, eorumque
dogmatibus; alibi autem vix hoc tempore invenitur, nisi forte in
philosophia Gilberti. Sed tamen circa hujusmodi philosophias cautio
nullo modo praetermittenda erat; quia mente jam praevidemus et
auguramur, si quando homines, nostris monitis excitati, ad experientiam
se serio contulerint (valere jussis doctrinis sophisticis), tum demum,
propter praematuram et praeproperam intellectus festinationem, et saltum
sive volatum ad generalia et rerum principia, fore ut magnum ab
hujusmodi philosophiis periculum immineat; cui malo etiam nunc obviam
ire debemus.</p>
<ol start="65" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At corruptio philosophiae ex superstitione, et theologia admista,
latius omnino patet, et plurimum mali infert, aut in philosophias
integras, aut in earum partes. Humanus enim intellectus non minus
impressionibus phantasiae est obnoxius, quam impressionibus vulgarium
notionum. Pugnax enim genus philosophiae et sophisticum illaqueat
intellectum: at illud alterum phantasticum, et tumidum, et quasi
poeticum, magis blanditur intellectui. Inest enim homini quaedam
intellectus ambitio, non minor quam voluntatis; praesertim in ingeniis
altis et elevatis.</p>
<p>Hujus autem generis exemplum inter Graecos illucescit, praecipue in
Pythagora, sed cum superstitione magis crassa et onerosa conjunctum; at
periculosius et subtilius in Platone atque ejus schola. Invenitur etiam
hoc genus mali in partibus philosophiarum reliquarum, introducendo
formas abstractas, et causas finales, et causas primas; omittendo
saepissime medias, et hujusmodi. Huic autem rei summa adhibenda est
cautio. Pessima enim res est errorum apotheosis, et pro peste
intellectus habenda est, si vanis accedat veneratio. Huic autem vanitati
nonnulli ex modernis summa levitate ita indulserunt, ut in primo
capitulo Geneseos, et in libro Job, et aliis Scripturis sacris,
philosophiam naturalem fundare conati sint; inter viva quaerentes
mortua. Tantoque magis haec vanitas inhibenda venit, et coercenda, quia
ex divinorum et humanorum malesana admistione non solum educitur
philosophia phantasica, sed etiam religio haeretica. Itaque salutare
admodum est, si mente sobria fidei tantum dentur quae fidei sunt.</p>
<ol start="66" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Et de malis authoritatibus philosophiarum, quae aut in vulgaribus
notionibus, aut in paucis experimentis, aut in superstitione fundatae
sunt, jam dictum est. Dicendum porro est et de vitiosa materia
contemplationum, praesertim in philosophia naturali. Inficitur autem
intellectus humanus ex intuitu eorum quae in artibus mechanicis fiunt,
in quibus corpora per compositiones aut separationes ut plurimum
alterantur; ut cogitet simile quiddam etiam in natura rerum universali
fieri. Unde fluxit commentum illud elementorum, atque illorum concursu,
ad constituenda corpora naturalia Rursus, quum homo naturae libertatem
contemplatur, incidit in species rerum, animalium, plantarum,
mineralium; unde facile in eam labitur cogitationem, ut existimet esse
in natura quasdam formas rerum primarias, quas natura educere molitur:
atque reliquam varietatem ex impedimentis et aberrationibus naturae in
opere suo conficiendo, aut ex diversarum specierum conflictu, et
transplantatione alterius in alteram, provenire. Atque prima cogitatio
qualitates primas elementares, secunda proprietates occultas et virtutes
specificas nobis peperit; quarum utraque pertinet ad inania
contemplationum compendia, in quibus acquiescit animus et a solidioribus
avertitur. At medici in secundis rerum qualitatibus et operationibus,
attrahendi, repellendi, attenuandi, inspissandi, dilatandi, astringendi,
discutiendi, maturandi, et hujusmodi, operam praestant meliorem; atque,
nixi ex illis duobus (quae dixi) compendiis (qualitatibus scilicet
elementaribus, et virtutibus specificis) illa altera (quae recte notata
sunt) corrumperent, reducendo illa ad primas qualitates earumque
mixturas subtiles et incommensurabiles, aut ea non producendo cum majore
et diligentiore observatione ad qualitates tertias et quartas, sed
contemplationem intempestive abrumpendo, illi multo melius profecissent.
Neque hujusmodi virtutes (non dico eaedem, sed similes) in humani
corporis medicinis tantum exquirendae sunt; sed etiam in caeterorum
corporum naturalium mutationibus.</p>
<p>Sed multo adhuc majore cum malo fit, quod quiescentia rerum
principia, ex quibus; et non moventia, per quae res fiunt, contemplentur
et inquirant. Illa enim ad sermones, ista ad opera spectant. Neque enim
vulgars illae differentiae motus, quae in naturali philosophia recepta
notantur, generationis, corruptionis, augmentationis, diminutionis,
alterationis, et lationis, ullius sunt pretii. Quippe hoc sibi volunt;
si corpus, alias non mutatum, loco tamen moveatur, hoc lationem esse;
si, manente et loco et specie, qualitate mutetur, hoc alterationem esse;
si vero ex illa mutatione moles ipsa et quantitas corporis non eadem
maneat, hoc augmentationis et diminutionis motum esse; si eatenus
mutentur, ut speciem ipsam et substantiam mutent, et in alia migrent,
hoc generationem et corruptionem esse. At ista mere popularia sunt, et
nullo modo in naturam penetrant; suntque mensurae et periodi tantum, non
species motus. Innuunt enim illud, hucusque, et non quomodo, vel ex quo
fonte. Neque enim de corporum appetitu, aut de partium eorum processu,
aliquid significant; sed tantum quum motus ille rem aliter ac prius,
crasso modo, sensui exhibeat, inde divisionem suam auspicantur. Etiam
quum de causis motuum aliquid significare volunt, atque divisionem ex
illis instituere, differentiam motus naturalis et violenti, maxima cum
socordia, introducunt; quae et ipsa omnino ex notione vulgari est; cum
omnis motus violentus etiam naturalis revera sit, scilicet cum externum
efficiens naturam alio modo in opere ponet quam quo prius.</p>
<p>At hisce omissis; si quis (exempli gratia) observaverit, inesse
corporibus appetitum contactus ad invicem, ut non patiantur unitatem
naturae prorsus dirimi aut abscindi, ut vacuum detur: aut si quis dicat,
inesse corporibus appetitum se recipiendi in naturalem suam dimensionem
vel tensuram, ut, si ultra eam aut citra eam comprimantur aut
distrahantur, statim in veterem sphaeram et exporrectionem suam se
recuperare et remittere moliantur: aut si quis dicat, inesse corporibus
appetitum congregationis ad massas connaturalium suorum, densorum
videlicet versus orbem terrae, tenuiorum et rariorum versus ambitum
coeli: haec et hujusmodi vere physica sunt genera motuum. At illa altera
plane logica sunt et scholastica, ut ex hac collatione eorum manifesto
liquet.</p>
<p>Neque minus etiam malum est, quod in philosophiis et
contemplationibus suis, in principiis rerum atque ultimatibus naturae
investigandis et tractandis, opera insumatur; cum omnis utilitas et
facultas operandi in mediis consistat. Hinc fit, ut abstrahere naturam
homines non desinant, donec ad materiam potentialem et informem ventum
fuerit; nec rursus secare naturam desinant, donec perventum fuerit ad
atomum; quae, etiamsi vera essent, tamen ad juvandas hominum fortunas
parum possunt.</p>
<ol start="67" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Danda est etiam cautio intellectui de intemperantiis philosophiarum,
quoad assensum praebendum aut cohibendum; quia hujusmodi intemperantiae
videntur idola figere, et quodammodo perpetuare, ne detur aditus ad ea
summovenda.</p>
<p>Duplex autem est excessus: alter eorum, qui facile pronunciant, et
scientias reddunt positivas et magistrales; alter eorum, qui
acatalepsiam introduxerunt, et inquisitionem vagam sine termino; quorum
primus intellectum deprimit, alter enervat. Nam Aristotelis philosophia,
postquam caeteras philosophias (more Ottomanorum erga fratres suos)
pugnacibus confutationibus contrucidasset, de singulis pronunciavit; et
ipse rursus quaestiones ex arbitrio suo subornat, deinde conficit; ut
omnia certa sint et decreta: quod etiam apud successiones suas valet et
in usu est.</p>
<p>At Platonis schola acatalepsiam introduxit, primo tanquam per jocum
et ironiam, in odium veterum sophistarum, Protagorae, Hippiae, et
reliquorum, qui nihil tam verebantur, quam ne dubitare de re aliqua
viderentur. At nova academia acatalepsiam dogmatizavit, et ex professo
tenuit: quae licet honestior ratio sit, quam pronunciandi licentia, quum
ipsi pro se dicant se minime confundere inquisitionem, ut Pyrrho fecit
et Ephectici, sed habere quod sequantur ut probabile, licet non habeant
quod teneant ut verum; tamen postquam animus humanus de veritate
invenienda semel desperaverit, omnino omnia fiunt languidiora: ex quo
fit, ut deflectant homines potius ad amoenas disputationes et discursus,
et rerum quasdam peragrationes, quam in severitate inquisitionis se
sustineant. Verum, quod a principio diximus et perpetuo agimus, sensui
et intellectui humano eorumque infirmitati authoritas non est deroganda,
sed auxilia praebenda.</p>
<ol start="68" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque de idolorum singulis generibus, eorumque apparatu jam diximus;
quae onmia constanti et solenni decreto sunt abneganda et renuncianda,
et intellectus ab iis omnino liberandus est et expurgandus; ut non alius
fere sit aditus ad regnum hominis, quod fundatur in scientiis, quam ad
regnum coelorum, in quod, nisi sub persona infantis, intrare non
datur.</p>
<ol start="69" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At pravae demonstrationes, idolorum veluti munitiones quaedam sunt et
praesidia; eaeque, quas in dialecticis habemus, id fere agunt, ut mundum
plane cogitationibus humanis, cogitationes autem verbis addicant et
mancipent. Demonstrationes vero potentia quadam philosophiae ipsae sunt
et scientiae. Quales enim eae sunt, ac prout rite aut male institutae,
tales sequuntur philosophiae et contemplationes. Fallunt autem et
incompetentes sunt eae quibus utimur in universo illo processu, qui a
sensu et rebus ducit ad axiomata et conclusiones. Qui quidem processus
quadruplex est, et vitia ejus totidem. Primo, impressiones sensus ipsius
vitiosae sunt; sensus enim et destituit et fallit. At destitutionibus
substitutiones, fallaciis rectificationes debentur. Secundo, notiones ab
impressionibus sensuum male abstrahuntur, et interminatae et confusae
sunt, quas terminatas et bene finitas esse oportuit. Tertio, inductio
mala est, quae per enumerationem simplicem principia concludit
scientiarum, non adhibitis exclusionibus et solutionibus, sive
separationibus naturae debitis. Postremo, modus ille inveniendi et
probandi, ut primo principia maxime generalia constituantur, deinde
media axiomata ad ea applicentur et probentur, errorum mater est, et
scientiarum omnium calamitas. Verum de istis, quae jam obiter
perstringimus, fusius dicemus, quum veram interpretandae naturae viam,
absolutis istis expiationibus et expurgationibus mentis, proponemus.</p>
<ol start="70" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sed demonstratio longe optima est experientia; modo haereat in ipso
experimento. Nam si traducatur ad alia quae similia existimantur, nisi
rite et ordine fiat illa traductio, res fallax est. At modus experiendi,
quo homines nunc utuntur, caecus est et stupidus. Itaque cum errant et
vagantur nulla via certa, sed ex occursu rerum tantum consilium capiunt,
circumferuntur ad multa, sed parum promovent; et quandoque gestiunt,
quandoque distrahuntur; et semper inveniunt quod ulterius quaerant. Fere
autem ita fit, ut homines leviter et tanquam per ludum experiantur,
variando paululum experimenta jam cognita; et, si res non succedat,
fastidiendo et conatum deserendo. Quod si magis serio et constanter ac
laboriose ad experimenta se accingant, tamen in uno aliquo experimento
eruendo operam collocant; quemadmodum Gilbertus in magnete, Chymici in
auro. Hoc autem faciunt homines instituto non minus imperito quam tenui.
Nemo enim alicujus rei naturam in ipsa re feliciter perscrutatur; sed
amplianda est inquisitio ad magis communia.</p>
<p>Quod si etiam scientiam quandam et dogmata ex experimentis moliantur;
tamen semper fere studio praepropero et intempestivo deflectunt ad
praxin: non tantum propter usum et fructum ejusmodi praxeos, sed ut in
opere aliquo novo veluti pignus sibi arripiant, se non inutiliter in
reliquis versaturos: atque etiam aliis se venditent, ad existimationem
meliorem comparandam de iis in quibus occupati sunt. Ita fit ut, more
Atalantae, de via decedant ad tollendum aureum pomum; interim vero
cursum interrumpant, et victoriam emittant e manibus. Verum in
experientiae vero curriculo eoque ad nova opera producendo, Divina
Sapientia omnino et ordo pro exemplari sumenda sunt. Deus autem primo
die creationis lucem tantum creavit, eique operi diem integrum
attribuit; nec aliquid materiati operis eo die creavit. Similiter et ex
omnimoda experientia, primum inventio causarum et axiomatum verorum
elicienda est: et lucifera experimenta, non fructifera quaerenda.
Axiomata autem recte inventa et constituta praxin non strictim sed
confertim instruunt; et operum agmina ac turmas post se trahunt. Verum
de experiendi viis, quae non minus quam viae judicandi obsessae sunt et
interclusae, postea dicemus; impraesentiarum de experientia vulgari,
tanquam de mala demonstratione, tantum loquuti. Jam vero postulat ordo
rerum, ut de iis quorum paulo ante mentionem fecimus, signis, quod
philosophiae et contemplationes in usu male se habeant, et de causis rei
primo intuitu tam mirabilis et incredibilis, quaedam subjungamus.
Signorum enim notio praeparat assensum: causarum vero explicatio tollit
miraculum. Quae duo ad extirpationem idolorum ex intellectu faciliorem
et clementiorem multum juvant.</p>
<ol start="71" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Scientiae, quas habemus, fere a Graecis fluxerunt. Quae enim
scriptores Romani, aut Arabes, aut recentiores addiderunt, non multa aut
magni momenti sunt: et qualiacunque sint, fundata sunt super basin eorum
quae inventa sunt a Graecis. Erat autem sapientia Graecorum professoria,
et in disputationes effusa: quod genus inquisitioni veritatis
adversissimum est. Itaque nomen illud sophistarum, quod per contemptum
ab iis, qui se philosophos haberi voluerunt, in antiquos rhetores
rejectum et traductum est, Gorgiam, Protagoram, Hippiam, Polum, etiam
universo generi competit, Platoni, Aristoteli, Zenoni, Epicuro,
Theophrasto, et eorum successoribus, Chrysippo, Carneadi, reliquis. Hoc
tantum intererat: quod prius genus vagum fuerit et mercenarium,
civitates circumcursando, et sapientiam suam ostentando, et mercedem
exigendo; alterum vero solennius et generosius, quippe eorum qui sedes
fixas habuerunt, et scholas aperuerunt, et gratis philosophati sunt. Sed
tamen utrumque genus (licet caetera dispar) professorium erat, et ad
disputationes rem deducebat, et sectas quasdam atque haereses
philosophiae instituebat et propugnabat: ut essent fere doctrinae eorum
(quod non male cavillatus est Dionysius in Platonem) Verba otiosorum
senum ad imperitos juvenes. At antiquiores illi ex Graecis, Empedocles,
Anaxagoras, Leucippus, Democritus, Parmenides, Heraclitus, Xenophanes,
Philolaus, reliqui (nam Pythagoram, ut superstitiosum, omittimus),
scholas (quod novimus) non aperuerunt: sed majore silentio, et severius,
et simplicius, id est, minore cum affectatione et ostentatione, ad
inquisitionem veritatis se contulerunt. Itaque et melius, ut arbitramur,
se gesserunt; nisi quod opera eorum a levioribus istis, qui vulgari
captui et affectui magis respondent ac placent, tractu temporis extincta
sint: tempore (ut fluvio) leviora et magis inflata ad nos devehente,
graviora et solida mergente. Neque tamen isti a nationis vitio prorsus
immunes erant: sed in ambitionem et vanitatem sectae condendae et aurae
popularis captandae nimium propendebant. Pro desperata autem habenda est
veritatis inquisitio, cum ad hujusmodi inania deflectat. Etiam non
omittendum videtur judicium illud, sive vaticinium potius, sacerdotis
Aegyptii de Graecis: Quod semper pueri essent; neque haberent
antiquitatem scientiae, aut scientiam antiquitatis. Et certe habent id
quod puerorum est; ut ad garriendum prompti sint, generare autem non
possint: nam verbosa videtur sapientia eorum, et operum sterilis. Itaque
ex ortu et gente philosophiae quae in usu est, quae capiuntur signa bona
non sunt.</p>
<ol start="72" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque multo meliora sunt signa quae ex natura temporis et aetatis
capi possunt, quam quae ex natura loci et nationis. Angusta enim erat et
tenuis notitia per illam aetatem vel temporis vel orbis: quod longe
pessimum est, praesertim iis qui mnia in experientia ponunt. Neque enim
mille annorum historiam, quae digna erat nomine historiae, habebant; sed
fabulas et rumores antiquitatis. Regionum vero tractuumque mundi exiguam
partem noverant: cum omnes hyperboreos, Scythas, omnes occidentales,
Celtas indistincte appellarent; nil in Africa ultra citimam Aethiopiae
partem, nil in Asia ultra Gangem, multo minus novi orbis provincias, ne
per auditum sane aut famam aliquam certam et constantem, nossent; imo et
plurima climata et zonae, in quibus populi infiniti spirant et degunt,
tanquam inhabitabiles ab illis pronuntiata sint; quinetiam
peregrinationes Democriti, Platonis, Pythagorae, non longinquae
profecto, sed potius suburbanae, ut magnum aliquid celebrarentur.
Nostris autem temporibus, et novi orbis partes complures et veteris
orbis extrema undique innotescunt; et in infinitum experimentorum
cumulus excrevit. Quare si ex nativitatis aut geniturae tempore
(astrologorum more) signa capienda sint, nil magni de istis philosophiis
significari videtur.</p>
<ol start="73" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter signa, nullum magis certum aut nobile est, quam quod ex
fructibus. Fructus enim et opera inventa pro veritate philosophiarum
velut sponsores et fidejussores sunt. Atque ex philosophiis istis
Graecorum, et derivationibus earum per particulares scientias, jam per
tot annorum spatia, vix unum experimentum adduci potest, quod ad hominum
statum levandum et juvandum spectet, et philosophiae speculationibus ac
dogmatibus vere acceptum referri possit. Idque Celsus ingenue ac
prudenter fatetur; nimirum, experimenta medicinae primo inventa fuisse,
ac postea homines circa ea philosophatos esse et causas indagasse et
assignasse; non ordine inverso evenisse, ut ex philosophia et causarum
cognitione ipsa experimenta inventa aut deprompta essent. Itaque mirum
non erat, apud Aegyptios (qui rerum inventoribus divinitatem et
consecrationem attribuerunt) plures fuisse brutorum animalium imagines
quam hominum: quia bruta animalia, per instinctus naturales, multa
inventa perpererunt; ubi homines, ex sermonibus et conclusionibus
rationalibus, pauca aut nulla exhibuerint.</p>
<p>At Chymicorum industria nonnulla peperit; sed tanquam fortuito et
obiter, aut per experimentorum quandam variationem (ut mechanici
solent), non ex arte aut theoria aliqua; nam ea, quam confinxerunt,
experimenta magis perturbat, quam juvat. Eorum etiam, qui in magia (quam
vocant) naturali versati sunt, pauca reperiuntur inventa; eaque levia,
et imposturae propiora. Quocirca, quemadmodum in religione cavetur, ut
fides ex operibus monstretur; idem etiam ad philosophiam optime
traducitur, ut ex fructibus judicetur et vana habeatur quae sterilis
sit: atque eo magis si, loco fructuum uvae et olivae, producat
disputationum et contentionum carduos et spinas.</p>
<ol start="74" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Capienda etiam sunt signa ex incrementis et progressibus
philosophiarum et scientiarum. Quae enim in natura fundata sunt,
crescunt et augentur: quae autem in opinione, variantur, non augentur.
Itaque si istae doctrinae plane instar plantae a stirpibus suis revulsae
non essent, sed utero naturae adhaererent atque ab eadem alerentur, id
minime eventurum fuisset, quod per annos bis mille jam fieri videmus:
nempe, ut scientiae suis haereant vestigiis, et in eodem fere statu
maneant, neque augmentum aliquod memorabile sumpserint; quin potius in
primo authore maxime floruerint, et deinceps declinaverint. In artibus
autem mechanicis, quae in natura et experientiae luce fundatae sunt,
contra evenire videmus: quae (quamdiu placent) veluti spiritu quodam
repletae continuo vegetant et crescunt; primo rudes, deinde commodae,
postea excultae, et perpetuo auctae.</p>
<ol start="75" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Etiam aliud signum capiendum est (si modo signi appellatio huic
competat; cum potius testimonium sit, atque adeo testimoniorum omnium
validissimum); hoc est, propria confessio authorum, quos homines nunc
sequuntur. Nam et illi qui tanta fiducia de rebus pronuntiant, tamen per
intervalla cum ad se redeunt, ad querimonias de naturae subtilitate,
rerum obscuritate, humani ingenii infirmitate, se convertunt. Hoc vero
si simpliciter fieret, alios fortasse, qui sunt timidiores, ab ulteriori
inquisitione deterrere, alios vero, qui sunt ingenio alacriori et magis
fidenti, ad ulteriorem progressum acuere et incitare possit. Verum non
satis illis est de se confiteri, sed quicquid sibi ipsis aut magistris
suis incognitum aut intactum fuerit id extra terminos possibilis ponunt,
et tanquam ex arte cognitu aut factu impossiblile pronuntiant: summa
superbia et invidia suorum inventorum infirmitatem in naturae ipsius
calumniam et aliorum omnium desperationem vertentes. Hinc schola
Academiae novae, quae acatalepsiam ex professo tenuit, et homines ad
sempiternas tenebras damnavit. Hinc opinio, quod formae sive verae rerum
differentiae (quae revera sunt leges actus puri) inventu impossibiles
sint, et ultra hominem. Hinc opiniones illae in activa et operativa
parte: calorem solis et ignis toto genere differre; ne scilicet homines
putent se per opera ignis aliquid simile iis quae in natura fiunt
educere et formare posse. Hinc illud: compositionem tantum opus hominis,
mistionem vero opus solius naturae esse; ne scilicet homines sperent
aliquam ex arte corporum naturalium generationem aut transformationem.
Itaque ex hoc signo homines sibi persuaderi facile patientur, ne cum
dogmatibus non solum desperatis, sed etiam desperationi devotis,
fortunas suas et labores misceant.</p>
<ol start="76" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque illud signum praetermittendum est, quod tanta fuerit inter
philosophos olim dissensio et scholarum ipsarum varietas: quod satis
ostendit, viam a sensu ad intellectum non bene munitam fuisse, cum eadem
materia philosophiae (natura scilicet rerum) in tam vagos et multiplices
errores abrepta fuerit et distracta. Atque licet hisce temporibus
dissensiones et dogmatum diversitates circa principia ipsa, et
philosophias integras, ut plurimum extinctae sint; tamen circa partes
philosophiae innumerae manent quaestiones et controversiae; ut plane
appareat, neque in philosophiis ipsis, neque in modis demonstrationum
aliquid certi aut sani esse.</p>
<ol start="77" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Quod vero putant homines, in philosophia Aristotelis magnum utique
consensum esse; cum post illam editam antiquorum philosophiae
cessaverint et exoleverint; ast apud tempora, quae sequuta sunt, nil
melius inventum fuerit; adeo ut illa tam bene posita et fundata
videatur, ut utrumque tempus ad se traxerit: primo, quod de cessatione
antiquarum philosophiarum post Aristotelis opera edita homines cogitant,
id falsum est; diu enim postea, usque ad tempora Ciceronis et secula
sequentia, manserunt opera veterum philosophorum. Sed temporibus
insequentibus, ex inundatione Barbarorum in imperium Romanum, postquam
doctrina humana velut naufragium perpessa esset; tum demum philosophiae
Aristotelis et Platonis, tanquam tabulae ex materia leviore et minus
solida, per fluctus temporum servatae sunt. Illud etiam de consensu
fallit homines, si acutius rem introspiciant. Verus enim consensus is
est, qui ex libertate judicii (re prius explorata) in idem conveniete
consistit. At numerus longe maximus eorum, qui in Aristotelis
philosophiam consenserunt, ex praejudicio et authoritate aliorum se illi
mancipavit: ut sequacitas sit potius et coitio, quam consensus. Quod si
fuisset ille verus consensus et late patens, tantum abest ut consensus
pro vera et solida authoritate haberi debeat, ut etiam violentam
praesumptionem inducat in contrarium. Pessimum enim omnium est augurium,
quod ex consensu capitur in rebus intellectualibus: exceptis divinis et
politicis, in quibus suffragiorum jus est. Nihil enim multis placet,
nisi imaginationem feriat, aut intellectum vulgarium notionum nodis
astringat, ut supra dictum est. Itaque optime traducitur illud Phocionis
a moribus ad intellectualia: Ut statim se examinare debeant homines,
quid erraverint aut peccaverint, si multitudo consentiat et complaudat.
Hoc signum igitur ex aversissimis est. Itaque quod signa veritatis et
sanitatis philosophiarum et scientiarum, quae in usu sunt, male se
habeant; sive capiantur ex originibus ipsarum, sive ex fructibus, sive
ex progressibus, sive ex confessionibus authorum, sive ex consensu; jam
dictum est.</p>
<ol start="78" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Jam vero veniendum ad causas errorum, et tam diuturnae in illis per
tot secula morae; quae plurimae sunt et potentissimae: ut tollatur omnis
admiratio, haec quae adducimus homines hucusque latuisse et fugisse; et
maneat tantum admiratio, illa nunc tandem alicui mortalium in mentem
venire potuisse, aut cogitationem cujuspiam subiisse: quod etiam (ut nos
existimamus) foelicitatis magis est cujusdam, quam excellentis alicujus
facultatis; ut potius pro temporis partu haberi debeat, quam pro partu
ingenii.</p>
<p>Primo autem tot seculorum numerus, vere rem reputanti, ad magnas
angustias recidit. Nam ex viginti quinque annorum centuriis, in quibus
memoria et doctrina hominum fere versatur, vix sex centuriae seponi et
excerpi possunt, quae scientiarum feraces earumve proventui utiles
fuerunt. Sunt enim non minus temporum quam regionum eremi et vastitates.
Tres enim tantum doctrinarum revolutiones et periodi recte numerari
possunt: una, apud Graecos; altera, apud Romanos; ultima, apud nos,
occidentales scilicet Europae nationes: quibus singulis vix duae
centuriae annorum merito attribui possunt. Media mundi tempora, quoad
scientiarum segetem uberem aut laetam, infelicia fuerunt. Neque enim
causa est ut vel Arabum vel scholasticorum mentio fiat: qui per
intermedia tempora scientias potius contriverunt numerosis tractatibus,
quam pondus earum auxerunt. Itaque prima causa tam pusilli in scientiis
profectus ad angustias temporis erga illas propitii rite et ordine
refertur.</p>
<ol start="79" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At secundo loco se offert causa illa magni certe per omnia momenti:
ea videlicet, quod per illas ipsas aetates, quibus hominum ingenia et
literae maxime vel etiam mediocriter floruerint, naturalis philosophia
minimam partem humanae operae sortita sit. Atque haec ipsa nihilominus
pro magna scientiarum matre haberi debet. Omnes enim artes et scientiae,
ab hac stirpe revulsae, poliuntur fortasse et in usum effinguntur; sed
nil admodum crescunt. At manifestum est, postquam Christiana fides
recepta fuisset et adolevisset, longe maximam ingeniorum
praestantissimorum praestantissimorum partem ad theologiam se
contulisse; atque huic rei et amplissima praemia proposita, et omnis
generis adjumenta copiosissime subministrata fuisse: atque hoc
theologiae studium praecipue occupasse tertiam illam partem sive
periodum temporis apud nos Europaeos occidentales; eo magis, quod sub
idem fere tempus et literae florere, et controversiae circa religionem
pullulare coeperint. At aevo superiori, durante periodo illa secunda
apud Romanos, potissimae philosophorum meditationes et industriae in
morali philosophia (quae ethnicis vice theologiae erat) occupatae et
consumptae fuerunt: etiam summa ingenia illis temporibus ut plurimum ad
res civiles se applicuerunt, propter magnitudinem imperii Romani, quod
plurimorum hominum opera indigebat. At illa aetas, qua naturalis
philosophia apud Graecos maxime florere visa est, particula fuit
temporis minime diuturna; cum et antiquioribus temporibus septem illi,
qui sapientes nominabantur, omnes (praeter Thaletem) ad moralem
philosophiam et civilia se applicuerint; et posterioribus temporibus
postquam Socrates philosophiam de coelo in terras deduxisset, adhuc
magis invaluerit moralis philosophia, et ingenia hominum a naturali
averterit.</p>
<p>At ipsissima illa periodus temporis, in qua inquisitiones de natura
viguerunt, contradictionibus et novorum placitorum ambitione corrupta
est, et inutilis reddita. Itaque quandoquidem per tres istas periodos
naturalis philosophia majorem in modum neglecta aut impedita fuerit, nil
mirum si homines parum in ea re profecerint, cum omnino aliud
egerint.</p>
<ol start="80" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Accedit et illud, quod naturalis philosophia in iis ipsis viris, qui
ei incubuerint, vacantem et integrum hominem, praesertim his
recentioribus temporibus, vix nacta sit; nisi forte quis monachi
alicujus in cellula, aut nobilis in villula lucubrantis, exemplum
adduxerit: sed facta est demum naturalis philosophia instar transitus
cujusdam et pontisternii ad alia.</p>
<p>Atque magna ista scientiarum mater mira indignitate ad officia
ancillae detrusa est; quae medicinae aut mathematices operibus
ministret, et rursus quae adolescentium immatura ingenia lavet et imbuat
velut tinctura quadam prima, ut aliam postea foelicius et commodius
excipiant. Interim nemo expectet magnum progressum in scientiis
(praesertim in parte earum operativa), nisi philosophia naturalis ad
scientias particulares producta fuerit, et scientiae particulares rursus
ad naturalem philosophiam reductae. Hinc enim fit, ut astronomia,
optica, musica, plurimae artes mechanicae, atque ipsa medicina, atque
(quod quis magis miretur) philosophia moralis et civilis, et scientiae
logicae, nil fere habeant altitudinis in profundo: sed per superficiem
et varietatem rerum tantum labantur: quia, postquam particulares istae
scientiae dispertitae et constitutae fuerint, a philosophia naturali non
amplius aluntur; quae ex fontibus et veris contemplationibus motuum,
radiorum, sonorum, texturae, et schematismi corporum, affectuum, et
prehensionum intellectualium, novas vires et augmenta illis impertiri
potuerit. Itaque minime mirum est si scientiae non crescant, cum a
radicibus suis sint separatae.</p>

<p>Rursus se ostendit alia causa potens et magna, cur scientiae parum
promoverint. Ea vero haec est; quod fieri non possit, ut recte
procedatur in curriculo, ubi ipsa meta non recte posita sit et defixa.
Meta autem scientiarum vera et legitima non alia est quam ut dotetur
vita humana novis inventis et copiis. At turba longe maxima nihil ex hoc
sapit, sed meritoria plane est et professoria; nisi forte quandoque
eveniat, ut artifex aliquis acrioris ingenii, et gloriae cupidus, novo
alicui invento det operam; quod fere fit cum facultatum dispendio. At
apud plerosque tantum abest ut homines id sibi proponant, ut scientiarum
et artium massa augmentum obtineat, ut ex ea, quae praesto est, massa
nil amplius sumant aut quaerant, quam quantum ad usum professorium aut
lucrum aut existimationem aut hujusmodi compendia convertere possint.
Quod si quis ex tanta multitudine scientiam affectu ingenuo et propter
se expetat; invenietur tamen ille ipse potius contemplationum et
doctrinarum varietatem, quam veritatis severam et rigidam inquisitionem
sequi. Rursus, si alius quispiam fortasse veritatis inquisitor sit
severior; tamen et ille ipse talem sibi proponet veritatis conditionem,
quae menti et intellectui satisfaciat in redditione causarum rerum quae
jampridem sunt cognitae; non eam, quae nova operum pignora, et novam
axiomatum lucem assequatur. Itaque, si finis scientiarum a nemine adhuc
bene positus sit, non mirum est si in iis, quae sunt subordinata ad
finem, sequatur aberatio.</p>
<ol start="82" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Quemadmodum autem finis et meta scientiarum male posita sunt apud
homines; ita rursus etiamsi illa recte posita fuissent, viam tamen sibi
delegerunt omnino erroneam et imperviam. Quod stupore quodam animum rite
rem reputanti perculserit; non ulli mortalium curae aut cordi fuisse, ut
intellectui humano ab ipso sensu et experientia ordinata et bene condita
via aperiretur et muniretur; sed omnia vel traditionum caligini, vel
argumentorum vertigini et turbini, vel casus et experientiae vagae et
inconditae undis et ambagibus permissa esse. Atque cogitet quis sobrie
et diligenter, qualis sit ea via, quam in inquisitione et inventione
alicujus rei homines adhibere consueverunt. Et primo notabit proculdubio
inveniendi modum simplicem et inartificiosum, qui hominibus maxime est
familiaris. Hic autem non alius est, quam ut is, qui se ad inveniendum
aliquid comparat et accingit, primo quae ab aliis circa illa dicta sint
inquirat et evolvat; deinde propriam meditationem addat, atque per
mentis multam agitationem spiritum suum proprium sollicitet, et quasi
invocet, ut sibi oracula pandat: quae res omnino sine fundamento est, et
in opinionibus tantum volvitur.</p>
<p>At alius quispiam dialecticam ad inveniendum advocet, quae nomine
tenus tantum ad id quod agitur pertinet. Inventio enim dialecticae non
est principiorum et axiomatum praecipuorum, ex quibus artes constant,
sed eorum tantum quae illis consentanea videntur. Dialectica enim magis
curiosos et importunos, et sibi negotium facessentes, eamque
interpellantes de probationibus et inventionibus principiorum, sive
axiomatum primorum, ad fidem, et veluti sacramentum cuilibet arti
praestandum, notissimo responso rejicit.</p>
<p>Restat experientia mera: quae, si occurrat, casus; si quaesita sit,
experimentum nominatur. Hoc autem experientiae genus nihil aliud est,
quam (quod aiunt) scopae dissolutae, et mera palpatio, quali homines
noctu utuntur, omnia pertentando, si forte in rectam viam incidere
detur; quibus multo satius et consultius foret diem praestolari, aut
lumen accendere, et deinceps viam inire. At contra, verus experientiae
ordo primo lumen accendit, deinde per lumen iter demonstrat, incipiendo
ab experientia ordinata et digesta, et minime praepostera aut erratica,
atque ex ea educendo axiomata, atque ex axiomatibus constitutis rursus
experimenta nova; quum nec verbum divinum in rerum massam absque ordine
operatum sit.</p>
<p>Itaque desinant homines mirari si spatium scientiarum non confectum
sit, cum a via omnino aberraverint; relicta prorsus et deserta
experientia, aut in ipsa (tanquam in labyrintho) se intricando, et
circumcursando; cum rite institutus ordo per experientiae sylvas ad
aperta axiomatum tramite constanti ducat.</p>
<ol start="83" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Excrevit autem mirum in modum istud malum ex opinione quadam, sive
aestimatione inveterata, verum tumida et damnosa; minui nempe mentis
humanae majestatem, si experimentis, et rebus particularibus sensui
subjectis et in materia detriminatis, diu ac multum versetur: praesertim
quum hujusmodi res ad inquirendum laboriosae, ad meditandum ignobiles,
ad dicendum asperae, ad practicam illiberales, numero infinitae, et
subtilitate tenues esse soleant. Itaque jam tandem huc res rediit, ut
via vera non tantum deserta, sed etiam interclusa et obstructa sit;
fastidita experientia, nedum relicta, aut male administrata.</p>
<ol start="84" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Rursus vero homines a progressu in scientiis detinuit et fere
incantavit reverentia antiquitatis, et virorum, qui in philosophia magni
habiti sunt, authoritas, atque deinde consensus. Atque de consensu
superius dictum est.</p>
<p>De antiquitate autem opinio, quam homines de ipsa fovent, negligens
omnino est, etvix verbo ipsi congrua. Mundi enim senium et gradaevitas
pro antiquitate vere habenda sunt; quae temporibus nostris tribui
debent, non juniori aetati mundi, qualis apud antiquos fuit. Illa enim
aetas, respectu nostri, antiqua et major; respectu mundi ipsius, nova et
minor fuit. Atque revera quemadmodum majorem rerum humanarum notitiam et
maturius judicium ab homine sene expectamus quam a juvene, propter
experientiam et rerum, quas vidit, et audivit, et cogitavit, varietatem
et copiam; eodem modo et a nostra aetate (si vires suas nosset, et
experiri et intendere vellet) majora multo quam a priscis temporibus
expectari par est; utpote aetate mundi grandiore, et infinitis
experimentis et observationibus aucta et cumulata.</p>
<p>Neque pro nihilo aestimandum, quod per longinquas navigationes et
peregrinationes (quae seculis nostris increbuerunt) plurima in natura
patuerint, et reperta sint, quae novam philosophiae lucem immittere
possint. Quin et turpe hominibus foret, si globi materialis tractus,
terrarum videlicet, marium, astrorum, nostris temporibus immensum aperti
et illustrati sint; globi autem intellectualis finis inter veterum
inventa et angustias cohibeantur.</p>
<p>Authores vero quod attinet, summae pusillanimitatis est authoribus
infinita tribuere, authori autem authorum, atque adeo omnis
authoritatis, Tempori, jus suum denegare. Recte enim Veritas Temporis
filia dicitur, non Authoritatis. Itaque mirum non est, si fascina ista
antiquitatis et authorum et consensus, hominum virtutem ita ligaverint,
ut cum rebus ipsis consuescere (tanquam maleficiati) non potuerint.</p>
<ol start="85" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque solum admiratio antiquitatis, authoritatis, et consensus,
hominum industriam in iis, quae jam inventa sunt, acquiescere compulit;
verum etiam operum ipsorum admiratio, quorum copia jampridem facta est
humano generi. Etenim quum quis rerum varietatem, et pulcherrimum
apparatum qui per artes mechanicas ad cultum humanum congestus et
introductus est, oculis subjecerit, eo certe inclinabit, ut potius ad
opulentiae humanae admirationem, quam ad inopiae sensum accedat; minime
advertens primitivas hominis observationes atque naturae operationes
(quae ad omnem illam varietatem instar animae sunt, et primi motus) nec
multas, nec alte petitas esse; caetera ad patientiam hominum tantum, et
subtilem et ordinatum manus vel intrumentorum motum, pertinere. Res enim
(exempli gratia) subtilis est certe et accurata confectio horologiorum,
talis scilicet, quae coelestia in rotis, pulsum animalium in motu
successivo et ordinato, videatur imitari; quae tamen res ex uno aut
altero naturae axiomate pendet.</p>
<p>Quod si quis rursus subtilitatem illam intueatur quae ad artes
liberales pertinet; aut etiam eam quae ad corporum naturalium
praeparationem per artes mechanicas spectat, et hujusmodi res suspiciat;
veluti inventionem motuum coelestium in astronomia, concentuum in
musica, literarum alphabeti (quae etiam adhuc in regno Sinarum in usu
non sunt) in grammatica; aut rursus in mechanicis, factorum Bacchi et
Cereris, hoc est, praeparationum vini et cervisiae, panificiorum, aut
etiam mensae delitiarum, et distillationum, et similium: ille quoque, si
secum cogitet, et animum advertat, per quantos temporum circuitus (cum
haec omnia, praeter distillationes, antiqua fuerint) haec ad eam, quam
nunc habemus, culturam perducta sint, et (ut jam de horologiis dictum
est) quam parum habeant ex observationibus et axiomatibus naturae, atque
quam facile, et tanquam per occasiones obvias et contemplationes
incurrentes, ista inveniri potuerint: ille (inquam) ab omni admiratione
se facile liberabit, et potius humanae conditionis miserebitur, quod per
tot secula tanta fuerit rerum et inventorum penuria et sterilitas. Atque
haec ipsa tamen, quorum nunc mentionem fecimus, inventa, philosophia et
artibus intellectus antiquiora fuerunt: adeo ut(si verum dicendum sit)
cum hujusmodi scientiae rationales et dogmaticae inceperint, inventio
operum utilium desierit.</p>
<p>Quod si quis ab officinis ad bibliothecas se converterit, et
immensam, quam videmus, librorum varietatem in admiratione habuerit, is,
examinatis et diligentius introspectis ipsorum librorum materiis et
contentis, obstupescet certe in contrarium; et postquam nullum dari
finem repetitionibus observaverit, quamque homines eadem agant et
loquantur, ab admiratione varietatis transibit ad miraculum indigentiae
et paucitatis earum rerum quae hominum mentes adhuc tenuerunt et
occuparunt.</p>
<p>Quod si quis ad intuendum ea, quae magis curiosa habentur quam sana,
animum submiserit, et alchymistarum aut magorum opera penitius
introspexerit, is dubitabit forsitan utrum risu an lachrymis potius illa
digna sint. Alchymista enim spem alit aeternam, atque ubi res non
succedit errores proprios reos substituit; secum accusatorie reputando,
se aut artis aut authorum vocabula non satis intellexisse, unde ad
traditiones et auriculares susurros animum applicat; aut in practicae
suae scrupulis et momentis aliquid titubatum esse, unde experimenta in
infinitum repetit: ac interim quum inter experimentorum sortes in
quaedam incidit aut ipsa facie nova aut utilitate non contemnenda;
hujusmodi pignoribus animum pascit, eaque in majus ostentat et celebrat:
reliqua spe sustentat. Neque tamen negandum est, alchymistas non pauca
invenisse, et inventis utilibus homines donasse. Verum fabula illa non
male in illos quadrat de sene, qui filiis aurum in vinea defossum (sed
locum se nescire simulans) legaverit; unde illi vineae fodiendae
diligenter incubuerunt, et aurum quidem nullum repertum, sed vindemia ex
ea cultura facta est uberior.</p>
<p>At naturalis magiae cultores, qui per rerum sympathias et antipathias
omnia expediunt, ex conjecturis otiosis et supinissimis, rebus virtutes
et operationes admirabiles affinxerunt; atque si quando opera
exhibuerint, ea illius sunt generis, ut ad admirationem et novitatem,
non ad fructum et utilitatem, accommodata sint.</p>
<p>In superstitiosa autem magia (si et de hac dicendum sit) illud
inprimis animadvertendum est, esse tantummodo certi cujusdam et definiti
generis subjecta, in quibus artes curiosae et superstitiosae, per omnes
nationes atque aetates atque etiam religiones, aliquid potuerint aut
luserint. Itaque ista missa faciamus. Interim nil mirum est, si opinio
copiae causam inopiae dederit.</p>
<ol start="86" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque hominum admirationi, quoad doctrinas et artes, per se satis
simplici et prope puerili, incrementum accessit ab eorum astu et
artificio qui scientias tractaverunt et tradiderunt. Illi enim ea
ambitione et affectatione eas proponunt, atque in eum modum efformatas
ac veluti personatas in hominum conspectum producunt, ac si illae omni
ex parte perfectae essent et ad exitum perductae. Si enim methodum
aspicias et partitiones, illae prorsus omnia complecti et concludere
videntur, quae in illud subjectum cadere possunt. Atque licet membra
illa male impleta et veluti capsulae inanes sint; tamen apud intellectum
vulgarem scientiae formam et rationem integrae prae se ferunt.</p>
<p>At primi et antiquissimi veritatis inquisitores, meliore fide et
fato, cognitionem illam, quam ex rerum contemplatione decerpere, et in
usum recondere statuebant, in aphorismos, sive breves easdemque sparsas
nec methodo revinctas sententias, conjicere solebant; neque se artem
universam complecti simulabant aut profitebantur. At eo quo nunc res
agitur modo, minime mirum est, si homines in iis ulteriora non quaerant,
quae pro perfectis et numeris suis jampridem absolutis traduntur.</p>
<ol start="87" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Etaim antiqua magnum existimationis et fidei incrementum acceperunt
ex eorum vanitate et levitate, qui nova proposuerunt; praesertim in
philosophiae naturalis parte activa et operativa. Neque enim defuerunt
homines vaniloqui et phantastici, qui partim ex credulitate, partim ex
impostura, genus humanum promissis onerarunt: vitae prolongationem,
senectutis retardationem, dolorum levationem, naturalium defectuum
reparationem, sensuum deceptiones, affectuum ligationes et incitationes,
intellectualium facultatum illuminationes et exaltationes, substantiarum
transmutationes, et motuum ad libitum roborationes et multiplicationes,
aeris impressiones et alterationes, coelestium influentiarum deductiones
et procurationes, rerum futurarum divinationes, remotarum
repraesentationes, occultarum revelationes, et alia complura
pollicitando et ostentando. Verum de istis largitoribus non multum
aberraverit, qui istiusmodi judicium fecerit, tantum nimirum in
doctrinis philosophiae inter horum vanitates et veras artes interesse,
quantum inter res gestas Julii Caesaris, aut Alexandri Magni, et res
gestas Amadicii ex Gallia, aut Arthuri ex Britannia, in historiae
narrationibus intersit. Inveniuntur enim clarissimi illi imperatores
revera majora gessisse, quam umbratiles isti heroes etiam fecisse
fingantur; sed modis et viis scilicet actionum minime fabulosis et
prodigiosis. Neque propterea aequum est verae memoriae fidem derogari,
quod a fabulis illa quandoque laesa sit et violata. Sed interim minime
mirum est, si propositionibus novis (praesertim cum mentione operum)
magnum sit factum praejudicium per istos impostores, qui similia
tentaverunt; cum vanitatis excessus et fastidium etiam nunc omnem in
ejusmodi conatibus magnanimitatem destruxerit.</p>
<ol start="88" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At longe majora a pusillanimitate, et pensorum, quae humana industria
sibi proposuit, parvitate et tenuitate, detrimenta in scientias invecta
sunt. Et tamen (quod pessimum est) pusillanimitas ista non sine
arrogantia et fastidio se offert.</p>
<p>Primum enim, omnium artium illa reperitur cautela jam facta
familiaris, ut in qualibet arte authores artis suae infirmitatem in
naturae calumniam vertant; et quod ars ipsorum non assequitur, id ex
eadem arte impossibile in natura pronunciant. Neque certe damnari potest
ars, si ipsa judicet. Etiam philosophia, quae nunc in manibus est, in
sinu suo posita quaedam fovet, aut placita, quibus (si diligentius
inquiratur) hoc hominibus omnino persuaderi volunt; nil ab arte, vel
hominis opere, arduum, aut in naturam imperiosum et validum, expectari
debere; ut de heterogenia caloris astri et ignis, et mistione, superius
dictum est. Quae si notentur accuratius, omnino pertinent ad humanae
potestatis circumscriptionem malitiosam, et ad quaesitam et artificiosam
desperationem, quae non solum spei auguria turbet, sed etiam omnes
industriae stimulos et nervos incidat, atque ipsius experientiae aleas
abjiciat; dum de hoc tantum solliciti sint, ut ars eorum perfecta
censeatur; gloriae vanissimae et perditissimae dantes operam, scilicet
ut quicquid adhuc inventum et comprehensum non sit, id omnino nec
inveniri, nec comprehendi posse in futurum credatur. At si quis rebus
addere se et novum aliquid reperire conetur, ille tamen omnino sibi
proponet et destinabit unum aliquod inventum (nec ultra) perscrutari et
eruere; ut magnetis naturam, maris fluxum et refluxum, thema coeli, et
hujusmodi, quae secreti aliquid habere videntur, et hactenus parum
feliciter tractata sint: quum summae sit imperitiae, rei alicujus
naturam in se ipsa perscrutari; quandoquidem eadem natura, quae in aliis
videtur latens et occulta, in aliis manifesta sit et quasi palpabilis,
atque in illis admirationem, in his ne attentionem quidem moveat; ut fit
in natura consistentiae, quae in ligno vel lapide non notatur, sed
solidi appellatione transmittitur, neque amplius de fuga separationis
aut solutionis continuitatis inquiritur; at in aquarum bullis eadem res
videtur subtilis et ingeniosa; quae bullae se conjiciunt in pelliculas
quasdam, in hemisphaerii formam curiose effictas, ut ad momentum
temporis evitetur solutio continuitatis.</p>
<p>Atque prorsus illa ipsa, quae habentur pro secretis, in aliis habent
naturam manifestam et communem; quae nunquam se dabit conspiciendam, si
hominum experimenta aut contemplationes in illis ipsis tantum versentur.
Generaliter autem et vulgo, in operibus mechanicis habentur pro novis
inventis, si quis jampridem inventa subtilius poliat, vel ornet
elegantius, vel simul uniat et componat, vel cum usu commodius copulet,
aut opus majore, aut etiam minore, quam fieri consuevit, mole vel
volumine exhibeat, et similia.</p>
<p>Itaque minime mirum est, si nobila et genere humano digna inventa in
lucem extracta non sint, quum homines hujusmodi exiguis pensis et
puerilibus contenti et delectati fuerint; quinetiam in iisdem se magnum
aliquod sequutos, aut assequutos putaverint.</p>
<ol start="89" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque illud praetermittendum est, quod nacta sit philosophia
naturalis per omnes aetates adversarium molestum et difficilem;
superstitionem nimirum, et zelum religionis caecum et immoderatum.
Etenim videre est apud Graecos, eos, qui primum causas naturales
fulminis et tempestatum insuetis adhuc hominum auribus proposuerunt,
impietatis in deos eo nomine damnatos: nec multo melius a nonnullis
antiquorum patrum religionis Christianae exceptos fuisse eos, qui ex
certissimis demonstrationibus (quibus nemo hodie sanus contradixerit)
terram rotundam esse posuerunt, atque ex consequenti antipodas esse
asseruerunt.</p>
<p>Quinetiam, ut nunc sunt res, conditio sermonum de natura facta est
durior et magis cum periculo, propter theologorum scholasticorum summas
et methodos; qui cum theologiam (satis pro potestate) in ordinem
redegerint, et in artis formam effinxerint, hoc insuper effecerunt, ut
pugnax et spinosa Aristotelis philosophia corpori religionis, plus quam
par erat, immisceretur.</p>
<p>Eodem etiam spectant (licet diverso modo) eorum commentationes, qui
veritatem Christianae religionis ex principiis ex authoritatibus
philosophorum deducere et confirmare haud veriti sunt; fidei et sensus
conjugium tanquam legitimum multa pompa et solennitate celebrates, et
grata rerum varietate animos hominum permulcentes; sed interim divina
humanis, impari conditione, permiscentes. At in hujusmodi misturis
theologiae cum philosophia, ea tantum, quae nunc in philosophia recepta
sunt, comprehenduntur; sed nova, licet in melius mutata, tantum non
summoventur et exterminantur.</p>
<p>Denique invenias, ex quorundam theologorum imperitia, aditum alicui
philosophiae, quamvis emendatae, pene interclusum esse. Alii siquidem
simplicius subverentur, ne forte altior in naturam inquisitio ultra
concessum sobrietatis terminum penetret; traducentes et perperam
torquentes ea, quae de divinis mysteriis in Scripturis sacris adversus
rimantes secreta divina dicuntur, ad occulta naturae, quae nullo
interdicto prohibentur. Alii callidus conjiciunt et animo versant, si
media ignorentur, singula ad manum et virgulam divinam (quod religionis,
ut putant, maxime intersit) facilius posse referri: quod nihil aliud
est, quam Deo per mendacium gratificari velle. Alii ab exemplo metuunt,
ne motus et mutationes circa philosophiam in religionem incurrant ac
desinant. Alii denique solliciti videntur, ne in naturae inquisitione
aliquid inveniri possit, quod religionem (praesertim apud indoctos)
subvertat, aut saltem labefactet. At isti duo posteriores metus nobis
videntur omnino sapientiam animalem sapere; ac si homines, in mentis
suae recessibus et secretis cogitationibus de firmitudine religionis, et
fidei in sensum imperio diffiderent ac dubitarent; et propterea ab
inquisitione veritatis in naturalibus periculum illis impendere
metuerent. At vere rem reputanti, philosophia naturalis, post verbum
Dei, certissima superstitionis medicina est; eademque probatissimum
fidei alimentum. Itaque merito religioni donatur tanquam fidissima
ancilla: cum altera voluntatem Dei, altera potestatem manifestet. Neque
enim erravit Ille, quit dixit; erratis, nescientes Scripturas et
potestatem Dei: informationem de voluntate et meditationem de potestate
nexu individuo commiscens et copulans. Interim minus mirum est, si
naturalis philosophiae incrementa cohibita sint; cum religio, quae
plurimum apud animos hominum pollet, per quorundam imperitiam et zelum
incautum in partem contrariam transierit et abrepta fuerit.</p>
<ol start="90" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Rursus in moribus et institutis scholarum, academiarum, collegiorum,
et similium conventuum, quae doctorum hominum sedibus et eruditionis
culturae destinata sunt, omnia progressui scientiarum adversa
inveniuntur. Lectiones enim et exercitia ita sunt disposita, ut aliud a
consuetis haud facile cuiquam in mentem veniat cogitare aut contemplari.
Si vero unus aut alter fortasse judicii libertate uti sustinuerit, is
sibi soli hanc operam imponere possit; ab aliorum autem consortio nihil
capiet utilitatis. Sin et hoc toleraverit, tamen in capessenda fortuna
industriam hanc et magnanimitatem sibi non levi impedimento fore
experietur. Studia enim hominum in ejusmodi locis in quorundam authorum
scripta, veluti in carceres, conclusa sunt; a quibus si quis dissentiat,
continuo ut homo turbidus et rerum novarum cupidus corripitur. At magnum
certe discrimen inter res civiles et artes: non enim idem periculum a
novo motu et a nova luce. Verum in rebus civilibus mutatio etiam in
melius suspecta est ob perturbationem; cum civilia authoritate,
consensu, fama, et opinione, non demonstratione, nitantur. In artibus
autem et scientiis, tanquam in metalli fodinis, omnia novis operibus et
ulterioribus progressibus circumstrepere debent. Atque secundum rectam
rationem res ita se habet, sed interim non ita vivtur: sed ista, quam
diximus, doctrinarum administratio et politia scientiarum augmenta
durius premere consuevit.</p>
<ol start="91" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque insuper licet ista invidia cessaverit; tamen satis est ad
cohibendum augmentum scientiarum, quod hujusmodi conatus et industriae
praemiis careant. Non enim penes eosdem est cultura scientiarum et
praemium. Scientiarum enim augmenta a magnis utique ingeniis proveniunt;
at pretia et praemia scientiarum sunt penes vulgus aut principes viros,
qui (nisi raro admodum) vix mediocriter docti sunt. Quinetiam hujusmodi
progressus non solum praemiis et beneficentia hominum, verum etiam ipsa
populari laude destituti sunt. Sunt enim illi supra captum maximae
partis hominum, et ab opinionum vulgarium ventis facile obruuntur et
extinguuntur. Itaque nil mirum, si res illa non foeliciter successerit,
quae in honore non fuit.</p>
<ol start="92" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sed longe maximum progressibus scientiarum, et novis pensis ac
provinciis in iisdem suscipiendis, obstaculum deprehenditur in
desperatione hominum, et suppositione impossibilis. Solent enim viri
prudentes et severi in hujusmodi rebus plane diffidere: naturae
obscuritatem, vitae brevitatem, sensuum fallacias, judicii infirmitatem,
experimentorum difficultates, et similia secum reputantes. Itaque
existimant, esse quosdam scientiarum, per temporum et aetatum mundi
revolutiones, fluxus et refluxus; cum aliis temporibus crescant et
floreant, aliis declinent et jaceant: ita tamen, ut cum ad certum
quendam gradum et statum pervenerint, nil ulterius possint.</p>
<p>Itaque si quis majora credat aut spondeat, id putant esse cujusdam
impotentis et immaturi animi; atque hujusmodi conatus initia scilicet
laeta, media ardua, extrema confusa habere. Atque cum hujusmodi
cogitationes eae sint, quae in viros graves et judicio praestantes
facile cadant, currandum revera est, ne rei optimae et pulcherrimae
amore capti severitatem judicii relaxemus, aut minuamus; et sedulo
videndum, quid spei affulgeat, et ex qua parte se ostendat; atque auris
levioribus spei rejectis, eae, quae plus firmitudinis habere videntur,
omnino discutiendae sunt et pensitandae. Quinetiam prudentia civilis ad
consilium vocanda est et adhibenda, quae ex praescripto diffidit, et de
rebus humanis in deterius conjicit. Itaque jam et de spe dicendum est;
praesertim cum nos promissores non simus, nec vim aut insidias hominum
judiciis faciamus aut struamus, sed homines manu et sponte ducamus.
Atque licet longe potentissimum futurum sit remedium ad spem
imprimendam, quando homines ad particularia, praesertim in tabulis
nostris inveniendi digesta et disposita (quae partim ad secundam, sed
multo magis ad quartam Instaurationis nostrae partem pertinent),
adducemus; cum hoc ipsum sit non spes tantum, sed tanquam res ipsa:
tamen ut omnia clementius fiant, pergendum est in instituto nostro de
praeparandis hominum mentibus; cujus praeparationis ista ostensio spei
pars est non exigua. Nam absque ea, reliqua faciunt magis ad
contristationem hominum (scilicet, ut deteriorem et viliorem habeant de
iis, quae jam in usu sunt, opinionem, quam nunc habent, et suae
conditionis infortunium plus sentiant et pernoscant), quam ad
alacritatem aliquam inducendam, aut industriam experiendi acuendam.
Itaque conjecturae nostrae, quae spem in hac re faciunt probabilem,
aperiendae sunt et proponendae: sicut Columbus fecit, ante navigationem
illam suam mirabilem maris Atlantici: cum rationes adduxerit, cur ipse
novas terras et continentes praeter eas, quae ante cognitae fuerunt,
inveniri posse confideret: quae rationes, licet primo rejectae, postea
tamen experimento probatae sunt, et rerum maximarum causae et initia
fuerunt.</p>
<ol start="93" type="I">

<p>Principium autem sumendum a Deo: hoc nimirum quod agitur, propter
excellentem in ipso boni naturam, manifeste a Deo esse, qui author boni,
et pater luminum est. In operationibus autem divinis, initia quaeque
tenuissima exitum certo trahunt. Atque quod de spiritualibus dictum est,
Regnum Dei non venit cum observatione, id etiam in omni majore opere
Providentiae evenire reperitur; ut omnia sine strepitu et sonitu placide
labantur, atque res plane agatur priusquam homines eam agi putent aut
advertant. Neque omittenda est prophetia Danielis de ultimis mundi
temporibus; Multi pertransibunt, et multiplex erit scientia: manifeste
innuens et significans, esse in fatis, id est, in Providentia, ut
pertransitus mundi (qui per tot longinquas navigationes impletus plane
aut jam in opere esse videtur) et augmenta scientiarum in eandem aetatem
incidant.</p>
<ol start="94" type="I">

<p>Sequitur ratio omnium maxima ad faciendam spem; nempe ex erroribus
temporis praeteriti et viarum adhuc tentatarum. Optima enim est ea
reprehensio, quam de statu civili haud prudenter administrato quispiam
his verbis complexus est: Quod ad praeterita pessimum est, id ad futura
optimum videri debet. Si enim vos omnia, quae ad officium vestrum
spectant, praestitissetis, neque tamen res vestrae in meliore loco
essent; ne spes quidem ulla reliqua foret, eas in melius provehi posse.
Sed cum rerum vestrarum status, non a vi ipsa rerum, sed ab erroribus
vestris male se habeat; sperandum est, illis erroribus missis aut
correctis, magnam rerum in melius mutationem fieri posse. Simili modo,
si homines per tanta annorum spatia viam veram inveniendi et colendi
scientias tenuissent, nec tamen ulterius progredi potuissent; audax
proculdubio et temeraria foret opinio, posse rem in ulterius provehi.
Quod si in via ipsa erratum sit, atque hominum opera in iis consumpta,
in quibus minime oportebat; sequitur ex eo, non in rebus ipsis
difficultatem oriri, quae potestatis nostrae non sunt, sed in intellectu
humano ejusque usu et applicatione; quae res remedium et medicinam
suscipit. Itaque optimum fuerit illos ipsos errores proponere: quot enim
fuerint errorum impedimenta in praeterito, tot sunt spei argumenta in
futurum. Ea vero licet in his, quae superius dicta sunt, non intacta
omnino fuerint; tamen ea etiam nunc breviter, verbis nudis ac
simplicibus, repraesentare visum est.</p>
<ol start="95" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Qui tractaverunt scientias aut empirici aut dogmatici fuerunt.
Empirici, formicae more, congerunt tantum, et utuntur: rationales,
aranearum more, telas ex se conficiunt: apis vero ratio media est, quae
materiam ex floribus horti et agri elicit; sed tamen eam propria
facultate vertit et digerit. Neque absimile philosophiae verum opificium
est; quod nec mentis viribus tantum aut praecipue nititur, neque ex
historia naturali et mechanicis experimentis praebitam materiam, in
memoria integram, sed in intellectu mutatam et subactam, reponit. Itaque
ex harum facultatum (experimentalis scilicet et rationalis) arctiore et
sanctiore foedere (quod adhuc factum non est) bene sperandum est.</p>
<ol start="96" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Naturalis philosophia adhuc sincera non invenitur, sed infecta et
corrupta: in Aristotelis schola, per logicam, in Platonis schola, per
theologiam naturalem; in secunda schola Platonis, Procli, et aliorum,
per mathematicam; quae philosophiam naturalem terminare, non generare
aut procreare debet. At ex philosophia naturali pura et impermista
meliora speranda sunt.</p>
<ol start="97" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Nemo adhuc tanta mentis constantia et rigore inventus est, ut
decreverit et sibi imposuerit theorias et notiones communes penitus
abolere, et intellectum abrasum et aequum ad particularia de integro
applicare. Itaque ratio illa humana, quam habemus, ex multa fide, et
multo etiam casu, nec non ex puerilibus, quas primo hausimus,
notionibus, farrago quaedam est et congeries.</p>
<p>Quod si quis aetate matura, et sensibus integris, et mente repurgata,
se ad experientiam et ad particularia de integro applicet, de eo melius
sperandum est. Atque hac in parte nobis spondemus fortunam Alexandri
Magni: neque quis nos vanitatis arguat, antequam exitum rei audiat, quae
ad exuendam omnem vanitatem spectat.</p>
<p>Etenim de Alexandro et ejus rebus gestis Aeschines ita loquutus est:
Nos certe vitam mortalem non vivimus; sed in hoc nati sumus, ut
posteritas de nobis portenta narret et praedicet: perinde ac si
Alexandri res gestas pro miraculo habuisset.</p>
<p>At aevis sequentibus Titus Livius melius rem advertit et introspexit,
atque de Alexandro hujusmodi quippiam dixit: Eum non aliud quam bene
ausum vana contemnere. Atque simile etiam de nobis judicium futuris
temporibus factum iri existimamus: Nos nil magni fecisse; sed tantum ea,
quae pro magnis habentur, minoris fecisse. Sed interim (quod jam
diximus) non est spes nisi in regeneratione scientiarum; ut eae scilicet
ab experientia certo ordine excitentur et rursus condantur: quod adhuc
factum esse aut cogitatum nemo (ut arbitramur) affirmaverit.</p>
<ol start="98" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque experientiae fundamenta (quando ad hanc omnino deveniendum est)
aut nulla, aut admodum infirma adhuc fuerunt; nec particularium sylva et
materies, vel numero, vel genere, vel certitudine, informando
intellectui competens, aut ullo modo sufficiens, adhuc quaesita est et
congesta. Sed contra homines docti (supini sane et faciles) rumores
quosdam experientiae, et quasi famas et auras ejus, ad philosophiam suam
vel constituendam vel confirmandam exceperunt, atque illis nihilominus
pondus legitimi testimonii attribuerunt. Ac veluti si regnum aliquod aut
status non ex literis et relationibus a legatis et nuntiis fide dignis
missis, sed ex urbanorum sermunculis et ex triviis consilia sua et
negotia gubernaret; omnino talis in philosphiam administratio, quatenus
ad experientiam, introducta est. Nil debitis modis exquisitum, nil
verificatum, nil numeratum, nil appensum, nil dimensum in naturali
historia reperitur. At quod in observatione indefinitum et vagum, id in
informatione fallax et infidum est. Quod si cui haec mira dictu
videantur, et querelae minus justae propiora, cum Aristoteles tantus
ipse vir, et tanti regis opibus subnixus, tam accuratam de animalibus
historiam confecerit, atque alii nonnulli majore diligentia (licet
strepitu minore) multe adjecerint, et rursus alii de plantis, de
metallis, et fossilibus, historias et narrationes copiosas
conscripserint; is sane non satis attendere et perspicere videtur, quid
agatur in praesentia. Alia enim est ratio naturalis historiae, quae
propter se confecta est; alia ejus, quae collecta est ad informandum
intellectum in ordine ad condendam philosophiam. Atque hae duae
historiae tum aliis rebus, tum praecipue in hoc differunt; quod prima ex
illis specierum naturalium varietatem, non artium mechanicarum
experimenta contineat. Quemadmodum enim in civilibus ingenium cujusque,
et occultus animi affectuumque sensus, melius elicitur, cum quis in
perturbatione ponitur, quam alias: simili modo, et occulta naturae magis
se produnt per vexationes artium, quam cum cursu suo meant. Itaque tum
demum bene sperandum est de naturali philosophia, postquam historia
naturalis (quae ejus basis est et fundamentum) melius instructa fuerit;
antea vero minime.</p>
<ol start="99" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque rursus in ipsa experimentorum mechanicorum copia, summa eorum,
quae ad intellectus informationem maxime faciunt et juvant, detegitur
inopia. Mechanicus enim, de veritatis inquisitione nullo modo
sollicitus, non ad alia quam quae operi suo subserviunt aut animum
erigit aut manum porrigit. Tum vero de scientiarum ulteriore progressu
spes bene fundabitur, quum in Historiam Naturalem recipientur et
aggregabuntur complura experimenta, quae in se nullius sunt usus, se ad
inventionem causarum et axiomatum tantum faciunt; quae nos lucifera
experimenta, ad differentiam fructiferorum, appellare consuevimus. Illa
autem miram habent in se virtutem et conditionem; hanc videlicet, quod
nunquam fallant aut frustrentur. Cum enim ad hoc adhibeantur, non ut
opus aliquod efficiant sed ut causam naturalem in aliquo revelent,
quaquaversum cadunt, intentioni aeque satisfaciunt; cum quaestionem
terminent.</p>
<ol start="3" type="A">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At non solum copia major experimentorum quaerenda est et procuranda,
atque etiam alterius generis, quam adhuc factum est; sed etiam methodus
plane alia et ordo et processus continuande et provehendae Experientiae
introducenda. Vaga enim Experientia et se tantum sequens (ut superius
dictum est) mera palpatio est, et homines potius stupefacit quam
informat. At cum Experientia lege certa procedet, seriatim et
continenter, de scientiis aliquid melius sperari poterit.</p>
<ol start="101" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Postquam vero copia et materies Historiae Naturalis et Experientiae,
talis qualis ad opus intellectus sive ad opus philosophicum requiritur,
praesto jam sit et parata; tamen nullo modo sufficit intellectus, ut in
illam materiem agat sponte et memoriter; non magis, quam si quis
computationem alicujus ephemeridis memoriter se tenere et superare posse
speret. Atque hactenus tamen potiores meditationis partes quam
scriptionis in inveniendo fuerunt; neque adhuc Experientia literata
facta est: atqui nulla nisi de scripto inventio probanda est. Illa vero
in usum inveniente, ab Experientia facta demum literata melius
sperandum.</p>
<ol start="102" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque insuper cum tantus sit particularium numerus et quasi
exercitus, isque ita sparsus et diffusus, ut intellectum disgreget et
confundat, de velitationibus et levibus motibus et transcursibus
intellectus non bene sperandum est; nisi fiat instructio et coordinatio,
per tabulas inveniendi idoneas et bene dispositas et tanquam vivas,
eorum quae pertinent ad subjectum in quo versatur inquisitio, atque ad
harum tabularum auxilia praeparata et digesta mens applicetur.</p>
<ol start="103" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Verum post copiam particularium rite et ordine veluti sub oculos
positorum, non statim transeundum est ad inquisitionem et inventionem
novorum particularium aut operum; aut saltem, si hoc fiat, in eo non
acquiescendum. Neque enim negamus, postquam omnia omnium artium
experimenta collecta et digesta fuerint atque ad unius hominis notitam
et judicium pervenerint, quin ex ipsa traductione experimentorum unius
artis in alias multa nova inveniri possint ad humanam vitam et statum
utilia, per istam Experientiam quam vocamus Literatam: sed tamen minora
de ea speranda sunt; majora vero a nova luce Axiomatum ex particularibus
illis certa via et regula eductorum, quae rursus nova particularia
indicent et designent. Neque enim in plano via sita est, sed ascendendo
et descendendo; ascendendo primo ad Axiomata, descendendo ad Opera.</p>
<ol start="104" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque tamen permittendum est, ut intellectus a particularibus ad
axiomata remota et quasi generalissima (qualia sunt principia, quae
vocant, artium et rerum) saliat et volet; et ad eorum immotam veritatem
axiomata media probet et expediat: quod adhuc factum est, prono ad hoc
impetu naturali intellectus, atque etiam ad hoc ipsum, per
demonstrationes quae fiunt per syllogismum, jampridem edocto et
assuefacto. Sed de scientiis tum demum bene sperandum est, quando per
scalam veram, et per gradus continuos et non intermissos aut hiulcos, a
particularibus ascendetur ad axiomata minora, et deinde ad media, alia
aliis superiora, et postremo demum ad generalissima. Etenim axiomata
infirma non multum ab experientia nuda discrepant. Suprema vero illa et
generalissima (quae habentur) notionalia sunt et abstracta, et nil
habent solidi. At media sunt axiomata illa vera et solida et viva, in
quibus humanae res et fortunae sitae sunt; et supra haec quoque, tandem
ipsa illa generalissima; talia scilicet quae non abstracta sint, sed per
haec media vere limitantur.</p>
<p>Itaque hominum intellectui non plumae addendae, sed plumbum potius et
pondera; ut cohibeant omnem saltum et volatum. Atque hoc adhuc factum
non est; quum vero factum fuerit, melius de scientiis sperare
licebit.</p>
<ol start="105" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In constituendo autem axiomate, forma inductionis alia quam adhuc in
usu fuit excogitanda est; eaque non ad principia tantum (quae vocant)
probanda et invenienda, sed etiam ad axiomata minora et media, denique
omnia. Inductio enim quae procedit per enumerationem simplicem res
puerilis est, et precario concludit, et periculo exponitur ab instantia
contradictoria, et plerumque secundum pauciora quam par est, et ex his
tantummodo quae praesto sunt, pronunciat. At inductio, quae ad
inventionem et demonstrationem scientiarum et artium erit utilis,
naturam separare debet, per rejectiones et exclusiones debitas; ac
deinde, post negativas tot quot sufficiunt, super affirmativas
concludere; quod adhuc factum non est, nec tentatum certe, nisi
tantummodo a Platone, qui ad excutiendas definitiones et ideas hac certe
forma inductionis aliquatenus utitur. Verum ad hujus inductionis, sive
demonstrationis, instructionem bonam et legitimam quamplurima adhibenda
sunt, quae adhuc nullius mortalium cogitationem subiere; adeo ut in ea
major sit consumenda opera, quam adhuc consumpta est in syllogismo.
Atque hujus inductionis auxilio, non solum ad axiomata invenienda, verum
etiam ad notiones terminandas, utendum est. Atque in hac certe
inductione spes maxima sita est.</p>
<ol start="106" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At in axiomatibus constituendis per hanc inductionem, examinatio et
probatio etiam facienda est, utrum quod constituitur axioma aptatum sit
tantum et ad mensuram factum eorum particularium ex quibus extrahitur;
an vero sit amplius et latius. Quod si sit amplius aut latius, videndum
an eam suam amplitudinem et latitudinem per novorum particularium
designationem, quasi fide-jussione quadam, firmet; ne vel in jam notis
tantum haereamus, vel laxiore fortasse complexu umbras et formas
abstractas, non solida et determinata in materia, prensemus. Haec vero
cum in usum venerint, solida tum demum spes merito affulserit.</p>
<ol start="107" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque hic etiam resumendum est, quod superius dictum est de Naturali
Philosophia producta et scientiis particularibus ad eam reductis, ut non
fiat scissio et truncatio scientiarum; nam etiam absque hoc minus de
progressu sperandum est.</p>
<ol start="108" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque de desperatione tollenda et spe facienda, ex praeteriti
temporis erroribus valere jussis aut rectificatis, jam dictum est.
Videndum autem et si quae alia sint quae spem faciant. Illud vero
occurrit; si hominibus non quaerentibus, et aliud agentibus, multa
utilia, tanquam casu quodam aut per occasionem, inventa sint; nemini
dubium esse posse, quin iisdem quaerentibus et hoc agentibus, idque via
et ordine, non impetu et desultorie, longe plura detegi necesse sit.
Licet enim semel aut iterum accidere possit, ut quispiam in id forte
fortuna incidat, quod magno conatu et de industria scrutantem antea
fugit; tamen in summa rerum proculdubio contrarium invenitur. Itaque
longe plura et meliora, atque per minora intervalla, a ratione et
industria et directione et intentione hominum speranda sunt, quam a casu
et instinctu animalium et hujusmodi, quae hactenus principium inventis
dederunt.</p>
<ol start="109" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Etiam illud ad spem trahi possit, quod nonnulla ex his quae jam
inventa sunt ejus sint generis ut antequam invenirentur haud facile
cuiquam in mentem venisset de iis aliquid suspicari; sed plane quis illa
ut impossibilia contempsisset. Solent enim homines de rebus novis ad
exemplum veterum, et secundum phantasiam ex iis praeceptam et
inquinatam, hariolari; quod genus opinandi fallacissimum est,
quandoquidem multa ex his quae ex fontibus rerum petuntur per rivulos
consuetos non fluant.</p>
<p>Veluti si quis, ante tormentorum igneorum inventionem, rem per
effectus descripsisset, atque in hunc modum dixisset: inventum quoddam
detectum esse, per quod muri et munitiones quaeque maximae ex longo
intervallo concuti et dejici possint; homines sane de viribus
tormentorum et machinarum per pondera et rotas et hujusmodi arietationes
et impulsus multiplicandis, multa et varia secum cogitaturi fuissent; de
vento autem igneo, tam subito et violenter se expandente et exsufflante,
vix unquam aliquid alicujus imaginationi aut phantasiae occursurum
fuisset; utpote cujus exemplum in proximo non vidisset, nisi forte in
terrae motu aut fulmine, quae, ut magnalia naturae et non imitabilia ab
homine, homines statim rejecturi fuissent.</p>
<p>Eodem modo si, ante fili bombycini inventionem, quispiam hujusmodi
sermonem injecisset: esse quoddam fili genus inventum ad vestium et
supellectilis usum, quod filum linteum aut laneum tenuitate, et
nihilominus tenacitate, ac etiam splendore et mollitie, longe superaret;
homines statim aut de serico aliquo vegetabili, aut de animalis alicujus
pilis delicatioribus, aut de avium plumis et lanugine, aliquid opinaturi
fuissent; verum de vermis pusilli textura, eaque tam copiosa et se
renovante et anniversaria, nil fuissent certe commenturi. Quod si quis
etiam de vermi verbum aliquod injecisset, ludibrio certe futurus
fuisset, ut qui novas aranearum operas somniaret.</p>
<p>Similiter, si ante inventionem acus nauticae quispiam hujusmodi
sermonem intulisset: inventum esse quoddam instrumentum, per quod
cardines et puncta coeli exacte capi et dignosci possint; homines statim
de magis exquisita fabricatione instrumentorum astronomicorum ad multa
et varia, per agitationem phantasiae, discursuri fuissent; quod vero
aliquid inveniri possit, cujus motus cum coelestibus tam bene
conveniret, atque ipsum tamen ex coelestibus non esset, sed tantum
substantia lapidea aut metallica, omnino incredibile visum fuisset.
Atque haec tamen et similia per tot mundi aetates homines latuerunt, nec
per philosophiam aut artes rationales inventa sunt, sed casu et per
occasionem; suntque illius (ut diximus) generis, ut ab iis quae antea
cognita fuerunt plane heterogenea et remotissima sint, ut praenotio
aliqua nihil prorsus ad illa conducere potuisset.</p>
<p>Itaque sperandum omnino est, esse adhuc in naturae sinu multa
excellentis usus recondita, quae nullam cum jam inventis cognationem
habent aut parallelismum, sed omnino sita sunt extra vias phantasiae;
quae tamen adhuc inventa non sunt; quae proculdubio per multos
saeculorum circuitus et ambages et ipsa quandoque prodibunt, sicut illa
superiora prodierunt; sed per viam, quam nunc tractamus, propere et
subito et simul repraesentari et anticipari possunt.</p>
<ol start="110" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Attamen conspiciuntur et alia inventa ejus generis, quae fidem
faciant, posse genus humanum nobilia inventa, etiam ante pedes posita,
praeterire et transilire. Utcunque enim pulveris tormentarii vel fili
bombycini vel acus nauticae vel sacchari vel papyri vel similium inventa
quibusdam rerum et naturae proprietatibus niti videantur, at certe
imprimendi artificium nil habet quod non sit apertum et fere obvium. Et
nihilominus homines, non advertentes literarum modulos difficilius
scilicet collocari quam literae per motum manus scribantur, sed hoc
interesse, quod literarum moduli semel collocati infinitis
impressionibus, literae autem per manum exaratae unicae tantum
scriptioni, sufficiant; aut fortasse iterum non advertentes atramentum
ita inspissari posse, ut tingat, non fluat; praesertim literis
resupinatis et impressione facta desuper; hoc pulcherrimo invento (quod
ad doctrinarum propagationem tantum facit) per tot saecula
caruerunt.</p>
<p>Solet autem mens humana, in hoc inventionis curriculo, tam laeva
saepenumero et male composita esse, ut primo diffidat, et paulo post se
contemnat; atque primo incredibile ei videatur aliquid tale inveniri
posse, postquam autem inventum sit, incredibile rursus videatur id
homines tamdiu fugere potuisse. Atque hoc ipsum ad spem rite trahitur;
superesse nimirum adhuc magnum inventorum cumulum, qui non solum ex
operationibus incognitis eruendis, sed et ex jam cognitis transferendis
et componendis et applicandis, per eam quam diximus Experientiam
Literatam, deduci possit.</p>
<ol start="111" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque illud omittendum ad faciendam spem: reputent (si placet)
homines infinitas ingenii, temporis, facultatum expensas, quas homines
in rebus et studiis longe minoris usus et pretii collocant; quorum pars
quota si ad sana et solida verteretur, nulla non difficultas superari
possit. Quod idcirco adjungere visum est, quia plane fatemur Historiae
Naturalis et Experimentalis collectionem, qualem animo metimur et qualis
esse debet, opus esse magnum, et quasi regium, et multae operae atque
impensae.</p>
<ol start="112" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Interim particularium multitudinem nemo reformidet, quin potius hoc
ipsum ad spem revocet. Sunt enim artium et naturae particularia
Phaenomena manipuli instar ad ingenii commenta, postquam ab evidentia
rerum disjuncta et abstracta fuerint. Atque hujus viae exitus in aperto
est, et fere in propinquo; alterius exitus nullus, sed implicatio
infinita. Homines enim adhuc parvam in Experientia moram fecerunt, et
eam leviter perstrinxerunt, sed in meditationibus et commentationibus
ingenii infinitum tempus contriverunt. Apud nos vero si esset praesto
quispiam qui de facto naturae ad interrogata responderet, paucorum
annorum esset inventio causarum et scientiarum omnium.</p>
<ol start="113" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Etiam nonnihil hominibus spei fieri posse putamus ab exemplo nostro
proprio; neque jactantiae causa hoc dicimus sed quod utile dictu sit. Si
qui diffidant, me videant, hominem inter homines aetatis meae civilibus
negotiis occupatissimum, nec firma admodum valetudine (quod magnum habet
temporis dispendium), atque in hac re plane protopirum, et vestigia
nullius sequutum, neque haec ipsa cum ullo mortalium communicantem, et
tamen veram viam constanter ingressum et ingenium rebus submittentem,
haec ipsa aliquatenus (ut existimamus) provexisse: et deinceps videant,
quid ab hominibus otio abundantibus, atque a laboribus consociatis,
atque a temporum successione, post haec indicia nostra expectandum sit;
praesertim in via quae non singulis solummodo pervia est (ut fit in via
illa rationali), sed ubi hominum labores et operae (praesertim quantum
ad experientiae collectam) optime distribui et deinde componi possint.
Tum enim homines vires suas nosse incipient, cum non eadem infiniti, sed
alia alii praestabunt.</p>
<ol start="114" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Postremo, etiamsi multo infirmior et obscurior aura spei ab ista Nova
Continente spiraverit, tamen omnino experiendum esse (nisi velimus animi
esse plane abjecti) statuimus. Non enim res pari periculo non tentatur,
et non succedit; cum in illo ingentis boni, in hoc exiguae humanae
operae, jactura vertatur. Verum ex dictis, atque etiam ex non dictis,
visum est nobis spei abunde subesse, non tantum homini strenuo ad
experiendum, sed etiam prudenti et sobrio ad credendum.</p>
<ol start="115" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque de desperatione tollenda, quae inter causas potentissimas ad
progressum scientiarum remorandum et inhibendum fuit, jam dictum est.
Atque simul sermo de signis et causis errorum, et inertiae et
ignorantiae quae invaluit, absolutus est; praesertim cum subtiliores
causae, et quae in judicium populare aut observationem non incurrunt, ad
ea quae de Idolis animi humani dicta sunt referri debeant.</p>
<p>Atque hic simul pars destruens Instaurationis nostrae claudi debet,
quae perficitur tribus redargutionibus: redargutione nimirum Humanae
Rationis Nativae et sibi permissae; redargutione Demonstrationum; et
redargutione Theoriarum, sive philosophiarum et doctrinarum quae
receptae sunt. Redargutio vero earum talis fuit qualis esse potuit;
videlicet per signa, et evidentiam causarum; cum confutatio alia nulla a
nobis (qui et de principiis et de demonstrationibus ab aliis
dissentimus) adhiberi potuerit.</p>
<p>Quocirca tempus est, ut ad ipsam artem et normam Interpretandi
Naturam veniamus; et tamen nonnihil restat quod praevertendum est. Quum
enim in hoc primo Aphorismorum libro illud nobis propositum sit, ut tam
ad intelligendum quam ad recipiendum ea quae sequuntur mentes hominum
praeparentur; expurgata jam et abrasa et aequata mentis area, sequitur
ut mens sistatur in positione bona, et tanquam aspectu benevolo, ad ea
quae proponemus. Valet enim in re nova ad praejudicium, non solum
praeoccupatio fortis opinionis veteris, sed et praeceptio sive
praefiguratio falsa rei quae affertur. Itaque conabimur efficere ut
habeantur bonae et verae de iis quae adducimus opiniones, licet ad
tempus tantummodo, et tanquam usurariae, donec res ipsa pernoscatur.</p>
<ol start="116" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Primo itaque postulandum videtur, ne existiment homines nos, more
antiquorum Graecorum, aut quorundam novorum hominum, Telesii, Patricii,
Severini, sectam aliquam in philosophia condere velle. Neque enim hoc
agimus; neque etiam multum interesse putamus ad hominum fortunas quales
quis opiniones abstractas de natura et rerum principiis habeat; neque
dubium est, quin multa hujusmodi et vetera revocari et nova introduci
possint; quemadmodum et complura themata coeli supponi possunt, quae cum
phaenomenis sat bene conveniunt, inter se tamen dissentiunt.</p>
<p>At nos de hujusmodi rebus opinabilibus, et simul inutilibus, non
laboramus. At contra nobis constitutum est experiri, an revera potentiae
et amplitudinis humanae firmiora fundamenta jacere ac fines in latius
proferre possimus. Atque licet sparsim, et in aliquibus subjectis
specialibus, longe veriora habeamus et certiora (ut arbitramur) atque
etiam magis fructuosa quam quibus homines adhuc utuntur (quae in quintam
Instaurationis nostrae partem congessimus), tamen theoriam nullam
universalem aut integram proponimus. Neque enim huic rei tempus adhuc
adesse videtur. Quin nec spem habemus vitae producendae ad sextam.
Instaurationis partem (quae philosophiae per legitimam Naturae
Interpretationem inventae destinata est) absolvendam; sed satis habemus
si in mediis sobrie et utiliter nos geramus, atque interim semina
veritatis sincerioris in poteros spargamus, atque initiis rerum magnarum
non desimus.</p>
<ol start="117" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque quemadmodum sectae conditores non sumus, ita nec operum
particularium largitores aut promissores. Attamen possit aliquis hoc
modo occurrere; quod nos, qui tam saepe operum mentionem faciamus et
omnia eo trahamus, etiam operum, etiam operum aliquorum pignora
exhibeamus. Verum via nostra et ratio (ut saepe perspicue diximus et
adhuc dicere juvat) ea est; ut non opera ex operibus sive experimenta ex
experimentis (ut empirici), sed ex operibus et experimentis causas et
axiomata, atque ex causis et axiomatibus rursus nova opera et
experimenta (ut legitimi Naturae Interpretes), extrahamus.</p>
<p>Atque licet in tabulis nostris inveniendi (ex quibus quarta pars
Instaurationis consistit), atque etiam exemplis particularium (quae in
secunda parte adduximus), atque insuper in observationibus nostris super
historiam (quae in tertia parte operis descripta est), quivis vel
mediocris perspicaciae et solertiae complurium operum nobilium
indicationes et designationes ubique notabit; ingenue tamen fatemur,
historiam naturalem quam adhuc habemus, aut ex libris aut ex
inquisitione propria, non tam copiosam esse et verificatam, ut legitimae
Interpretationi satisfacere aut ministrare possit.</p>
<p>Itaque si quis ad mechanica sit magis aptus et paratus, atque sagax
ad venanda opera ex conversatione sola cum experimentis, ei permittimus
et relinquimus illam industriam, ut ex historia nostra et tabulis multa
tanquam in via decerpat et applicet ad opera, ac veluti foenus recipiat
ad tempus, donec sors haberi possit. Nos vero, cum ad majora
contendamus, moram omnem praeproperam et praematuram in istiusmodi rebus
tanquam Atalantae pilas (ut saepius solemus dicere) damnamus. Neque enim
aurea poma pueriliter affectamus, sed omnia in victoria cursus artis
super naturam ponimus; neque muscum aut segetem herbidam demetere
festinamus, sed messem tempestivam expectamus.</p>
<ol start="118" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Occurret etiam alicui proculdubio, postquam ipsam historiam nostram
et inventionis tabulas perlegerit, aliquid in ipsis experimentis minus
certum, vel omnino falsum; atque propterea secum fortasse reputabit,
fundamentis et principiis falsis et dubiis inventa nostra niti. Verum
hoc nihil est; necesse enim est talia sub initiis evenire. Simile enim
est ac si in scriptione aut impressione una forte litera aut altera
perperam posita aut collocata sit; id enim legentem non multum impedire
solet, quandoquidem errata ab ipso sensu facile corriguntur. Ita etiam
cogitent homines, multa in historia naturali experimenta falso credi et
recipi posse, quae paulo post a causis et axiomatibus inventis facile
expunguntur et rejiciuntur. Sed tamen verum est, si in historia naturali
et experimentis magna et crebra et continua fuerint errata, illa nulla
ingenii aut artis foelicitate corrigi aut emendari posse. Itaque si in
historia nostra naturali, quae tanta diligentia et severitate et fere
religione probata et collecta est, aliquid in particularibus quandoque
subsit falsitatis aut erroris, quid tandem de naturali historia vulgari,
quae prae nostra tam negligens est et facilis, dicendum erit? aut de
philosophia et scientiis super hujusmodi arenas (vel syrtes potius)
aedificatis? Itaque hoc quod diximus neminem moveat.</p>
<ol start="119" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Occurrent etiam in historia nostra et experimentis plurimae res,
primo leves et vulgatae, deinde viles et illiberales, postremo nimis
subtiles ac mere speculativae, et quasi nullius usus: quod genus rerum
hominum studia avertere et alienare possit.</p>
<p>Atque de istis rebus, quae videntur vulgatae, illud homines cogitent;
solere sane eos adhuc nihil aliud agere, quam ut eorum quae rara sunt
causas ad ea quae frequenter fiunt referant et accommodent, at ipsorum
quae frequenter eveniunt nullas causas inquirant, sed ea ipsa recipiant
tanquam concessa et admissa.</p>
<p>Itaque non ponderis, non rotationis coelestium, non caloris, non
frigoris, non luminis, non duri, non mollis, non tenuis, non densi, non
liquidi, non consistentis, non animati, non inanimati, non similaris,
non dissimilaris, nec demum organici, causas quaerunt; sed illis,
tanquam pro evidentibus et manifestis, receptis, de ceteris rebus, quae
non tam frequenter et familiariter occurrunt, disputant et judicant.</p>
<p>Nos vero, qui satis scimus nullum de rebus raris aut notabilibus
judicium fieri posse, multo minus res novas in lucem protrahi, absque
vulgarium rerum causis et causarum causis rite examinatis et repertis,
necessario ad res vulgarissimas in historiam nostram recipiendas
compellimur. Quinetiam nil magis philosophiae offecisse deprehendimus
quam quod res, quae familiares sunt et frequenter occurrunt,
contemplationem hominum non morentur et detineant, sed recipiantur
obiter, neque earum causae quaeri soleant: ut non saepius requiratur
informatio de rebus ignotis, quam attentio in notis.</p>
<ol start="120" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Quod vero ad rerum vilitatem attinet, vel etiam turpitudinem, quibus
(ut ait Plinius) honos praefandus est; eae res, non minus quam
lautissimae et pretiosissimae, in historiam naturalem recipiendae sunt.
Neque propterea polluitur naturalis historia: sol enim aeque palatia et
cloacas ingreditur, neque tamen polluitur. Nos autem non Capitolium
aliquod aut Pyramidem hominum superbiae dedicamus aut condimus, sed
templum sanctum ad exemplar mundi in intellectu humano fundamus. Itaque
exemplar sequimur. Nam quicquid essentia dignum est, id etiam scientia
dignum, quae est essentiae imago. At vilia aeque subsistunt ac lauta.
Quinetiam, ut e quibusdam putridis materiis, veluti musco et zibetho,
aliquando optimi odores generantur; ita et ab instantiis vilibus et
sordidis quandoque eximia lux et informatio emanat. Verum de hoc nimis
multa; cum hoc genus fastidii sit plane puerile et effoeminatum.</p>
<ol start="121" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At de illo omnino magis accurate dispiciendum; quod plurima in
historia nostra captui vulgari, aut etiam cuivis intellectui (rebus
praesentibus assuefacto), videbuntur curiosae cujusdam et inutilis
subtilitatis. Itaque de hoc ante omnia et dictum et dicendum est: hoc
scilicet; nos jam sub initiis et ad tempus, tantum lucifera experimenta,
non fructifera quaerere; ad exemplum creationis divinae, quod saepius
diximus, quae primo die lucem tantum produxit, eique soli unum integrum
diem attribuit, neque illo die quicquam materiati operis immiscuit.</p>
<p>Itaque si quis istiusmodi res nullius esse usus putet, idem cogitat
ac si nullum etiam lucis esse usum censeat, quia res scilicet solida aut
materiata non sit. Atque revera dicendum est, simplicum naturarum
cognitionem bene examinatam et definitam instar lucis esse; quae ad
universa operum penetralia aditum praebet, atque tota agmina operum et
turmas, et axiomatum nobilissimorum fontes, potestate quadam
complectitur et post se trahit; in se tamen non ita magni usus est. Quin
et literarum elementa per se et separatim nihil significant nec alicujus
usus sunt, sed tamen ad omnis sermonis compositionem et apparatum instar
materiae primae sunt. Etiam semina rerum potestate valida, usu (nisi in
processu suo) nihili sunt. Atque lucis ipsius radii dispersi, nisi
coeant, beneficium suum non impertiuntur.</p>
<p>Quod si quis subtilitatibus speculativis offendatur, quid de
scholasticis viris dicendum erit, qui subtilitatibus immensum
indulserunt? quae tamen subtilitates in verbis, aut saltem vulgaribus
notionibus (quod tantundem valet), non in rebus aut natura consumptae
fuerunt, atque utilitatis expertes erant, non tantum in origine, sed
etiam in consequentiis; tales autem non fuerunt, ut haberent in praesens
utilitatem nullam, sed per consequens infinitam; quales sunt eae de
quibus loquimur. Hoc vero sciant homines pro certo, omnem subtilitatem
disputationum et discursuum mentis, si adhibeatur tantum post axiomata
inventa, seram esse et praeposteram; et subtilitatis tempus verum ac
proprium, aut saltem praecipuum, versari in pensitanda experientia et
inde constituendis axiomatibus: nam illa altera subtilitas naturam
prensat et captat, sed nunquam apprehendit aut capit. Et verissimum
certe est quod de occasione sive fortuna dici solet, si transferatur ad
naturam: videlicet, eam a fronte comatam, ab occipitio calvam esse.</p>
<p>Denique de contemptu in naturali historia rerum aut vulgarium, aut
vilium, aut nimis subtilium et in originibus suis inutilium, illa vox
mulierculae ad tumidum principem, qui petitionem ejus ut rem indignam et
majestate sua inferiorem abjecisset, pro oraculo sit; Disne ergo rex
esse: quia certissimum est, imperium in naturam, si quis hujusmodi rebus
ut nimis exilibus et minutis vacare nolit, nec obtineri nec geri
posse.</p>
<ol start="122" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Occurrit etiam et illud; mirabile quiddam esse et durum, quod nos
omnes scientias atque omnes authores simul ac veluti uno ictu et impetu
summoveamus: idque non assumpto aliquo ex antiquis in auxilium et
praesidium nostrum, sed quasi viribus propriis.</p>
<p>Nos autem scimus, si minus sincera fide agere voluissemus, non
difficile fuisse nobis, ista quae afferuntur vel ad antiqua saecula ante
Graecorum tempora (cum scientiae de natura magis fortasse sed tamen
majore cum silentio floruerint, neque in Graecorum tubas et fistulas
adhuc incidissent), vel etiam (per partes certe) ad aliquos ex Graecis
ipsis referre, atque astipulationem et honorem inde petere: more novorum
hominum, qui nobilitatem sibi ex antiqua aliqua prosapia, per
genealogiarum favores, astruunt et affingunt. Nos vero rerum evidentia
freti, omnem commenti et imposturae conditionem rejicimus; neque ad id
quod agitur plus interesse putamus, utrum quae jam invenientur antiquis
olim cognita, et per rerum vicissitudines et saecula occidentia et
orientia sint, quam hominibus curae esse debere, utrum Novus Orbis
fuerit insula illa Atlantis et veteri mundo cognita, an nunc primum
reperta. Rerum enim inventio a naturae luce petenda, non ab antiquitatis
tenebris repetenda est.</p>
<p>Quod vero ad universalem istam reprehensionem attinet, certissimum
est vere rem reputanti, eam et magis probabilem esse et magis modestam,
quam si facta fuisset ex parte. Si enim in primis notionibus errores
radicati non fuissent, fieri non potuisset quin nonnulla recte inventa
alia perperam inventa correxissent. Sed cum errores fundamentales
fuerint, atque ejusmodi, ut homines potius res neglexerint ac
praeterierint, quam de illis pravum aut falsum judicium fecerint; minime
mirum est, si homines id non obtinuerint quod non egerint, nec ad metam
pervenerint quam non posuerint aut collocarint, neque viam emensi sint
quam non ingressi sint aut tenuerint.</p>
<p>Atque insolentiam rei quod attinet; certe si quis manus constantia
atque oculi vigore lineam magis rectam aut circulum magis perfectum se
describere posse quam alium quempiam sibi assumat, inducitur scilicet
facultatis comparatio: quod si quis asserat se adhibita regula aut
circumducto circino lineam magis rectam aut circulum magis perfectum
posse describere, quam aliquem alium vi sola oculi et manus, is certe
non admodum jactator fuerit. Quin hoc, quod dicimus, non solum in hoc
nostro conatu primo et incoeptivo locum habet; sed etiam pertinet ad eos
qui huic rei posthac incumbent. Nostra enim via inveniendi scientias
exaequat fere ingenia, et non multum excellentiae eorum relinquit: cum
omnia per certissimas regulas et demonstrationes transigat. Itaque haec
nostra (ut saepe diximus) foelicitatis cujusdam sunt potius quam
facultatis, et potius temporis partus quam ingenii. Est enim certe casus
aliquis non minus in cogitationibus humanis, quam in operibus et
factis.</p>
<ol start="123" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Itaque dicendum de nobis ipsis quod ille per jocum dixit, praesertim
cum tam bene rem secet: fieri non potest ut idem sentiant, qui aquam et
qui vinum bibant. At caeteri homines, tam veteres quam novi, liquorem
biberunt crudum in scientiis, tanquam aquam vel sponte ex intellectu
manantem, vel per dialecticam, tanquam per rotas ex puteo, haustam. At
nos liquorem bibimus et propinamus ex infinitis confectam uvis, iisque
maturis et tempestivis, et per racemos quosdam collectis ac decerptis,
et subinde in torculari pressis, ac postremo in vase repurgatis et
clarificatis. Itaque nil mirum si nobis cum aliis non conveniat.</p>
<ol start="124" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Occurret proculdubio et illud: nec metam aut scopum scientiarum a
nobis ipsis (id quod in aliis reprehendimus) verum et optimum praefixum
esse. Esse enim contemplationem veritatis omni operum utilitate et
magnitudine digniorem et celsiorem: longam vero istam et sollicitam
moram in experientia et materia et rerum particularium fluctibus mentem
veluti humo affigere, vel potius in Tartarum quoddam confusionis et
perturbationis dejicere; atque ab abstractae sapientiae serenitate et
tranquillitate (tanquam a statu multo diviniore) arcere et summovere.
Nos vero huic rationi libenter assentimur; et hoc ipsum, quod innuunt ac
praeoptant, praecipue atque ante omnia agimus. Etenim verum exemplar
mundi in intellectu humano fundamus; quale invenitur, non quale cuipiam
sua propria ratio dictaverit. Hoc autem perfici non potest, nisi facta
mundi dissectione atque anatomia diligentissima. Modulos vero ineptos
mundorum et tanquam simiolas, quas in philosophiis phantasiae hominum
extruxerunt, omnino dissipandas edicimus. Sciant itaque homines (id quod
superius diximus) quantum intersit inter humanae mentis idola et divinae
mentis ideas. Illa enim nihil aliud sunt quam abstractiones ad placitum:
hae autem sunt vera signacula Creatoris super creaturas, prout in
materia per lineas veras et exquisitas imprimuntur et terminantur.
Itaque ipsissimae res sunt (in hoc genere) veritas et utilitas: atque
opera ipsa pluris facienda sunt, quatenus sunt veritatis pignora, quam
propter vitae commoda.</p>
<ol start="125" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Occurret fortasse et illud: nos tanquam actum agere, atque antiquos
ipsos eandem quam nos viam tenuisse. Itaque verisimile putabit quispiam
etiam nos, post tantum motum et molitionem, deventuros tandem ad aliquam
ex illis philosophiis quae apud antiquos valuerunt. Nam et illos in
meditationum suarum principiis vim et copiam magnam exemplorum et
particularium paravisse, atque in commentarios per locos et titulos
digessisse, atque inde philosophias suas et artes confecisse, et postea,
re comperta, pronuntiasse, et exempla ad fidem et docendi lumen sparsim
addidisse; sed particularium notas et codicillos ac commentarios suos in
lucem edere supervacuum et molestum putasse: ideoque fecisse quod in
aedificando fieri solet, nempe post aedificii structuram machinas et
scalas a conspectu amovisse. Neque aliter factum esse credere certe
oportet. Verum nisi quis omnino oblitus fuerit eorum quae superius dicta
sunt, huic objectioni (aut scrupulo potius) facile respondebit. Formam
enim inquirendi et inveniendi apud antiquos et ipsi profitemur, et
scripta eorum prae se ferunt. Ea autem non alia fuit, quam ut ab
exemplis quibusdam et particularibus (additis notionibus communibus, et
fortasse portione nonnulla ex opinionibus receptis, quae maxime
placuerunt) ad conclusiones maxime generales sive principia scientiarum
advolarent, ad quorum veritatem immotam et fixam conclusiones inferiores
per media educerent ac probarent; ex quibus artem constituebant. Tum
demum si nova particularia et exempla mota essent et adducta quae
placitis suis refragarentur, illa aut per distinctiones aut per
regularum suarum explanationes in ordinem subtiliter redigebant, aut
demum per exceptiones grosso modo summovebant: at rerum particularium
non refragantium causas ad illa principia sua laboriose et pertinaciter
accommodabant. Verum nec historia naturalis et experientia illa erat,
quam fuisse oportebat (longe certe abest), et ista advolatio ad
generalissima omnia perdidit.</p>
<ol start="126" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Occurret et illud: nos, propter inhibitionem quandam pronuntiandi et
principia certa ponendi donec per medios gradus ad generalissima rite
perventum sit, suspensionem quandam judicii tueri, atque ad Acatalepsiam
rem deducere. Nos vero non Acatalepsiam, sed Eucatalepsiam meditamur et
proponimus: sensui enim non derogamus, sed ministramus; et intellectum
non contemnimus, sed regimus. Atque melius est scire quantum opus sit,
et tamen nos non penitus scire putare, quam penitus scire nos putare, et
tamen nil eorum quae opus est scire.</p>
<ol start="127" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Etiam dubitabit quispiam potius quam objiciet, utrum nos de Naturali
tantum Philosophia, an etiam de scientiis reliquis, Logicis, Ethicis,
Politicis, secundum viam nostram perficiendis loquamur. At nos certe de
universis haec quae dicta sunt intelligimus: atque quemadmodum vulgaris
logica, quae regit res per syllogismum, non tantum ad naturales, sed ad
omnes scientias pertinet; ita et nostra, quae procedit per inductionem,
omnia complectitur. Tam enim historiam et tabulas inveniendi conficimus
de ira, metu, et verecundia, et similibus; ac etiam de exemplis rerum
civilium: nec minus de motibus mentalibus memoriae, compositionis et
divisionis, judicii, et reliquorum, quam de calido et frigido, aut luce,
aut vegetatione, aut similibus. Sed tamen cum nostra ratio
interpretandi, post historiam praeparatam et ordinatam, non mentis
tantum motus et discursus (ut logica vulgaris), sed et rerum naturam
intueatur; ita mentem regimus, ut ad rerum naturam se, aptis per omnia
modis, applicare possit. Atque propterea multa et diversa in doctrina
interpretationis praecipimus, quae ad subjecti, de quo inquirimus,
qualitatem et conditionem, modum inveniendi nonnulla ex parte
applicent.</p>
<ol start="128" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At illud de nobis ne dubitare quidem fas sit; utrum nos philosophiam
et artes et scientias quibus utimur destruere et demoliri cupiamus:
contra enim, earum et usum et cultum et honores libenter amplectimur.
Neque enim ullo modo officimus, quin istae, quae invaluerunt, et
disputationes alant, et sermones ornent, et ad professoria munera ac
vitae civilis compendia adhibeantur et valeant; denique, tanquam
numismata quaedam, consensu inter homines recipiantur. Quinetiam
significamus aperte, ea quae nos adducimus ad istas res non multum
idonea futura; cum ad vulgi captum deduci omnino non possint, nisi per
effecta et opera tantum. At hoc ipsum, quod de affectu nostro et bona
voluntate erga scientias receptas dicimus, quam vere profiteamur,
scripta nostra in publicum edita (praesertim libri De Progressu
Scientiarum) fidem faciant. Itaque id verbis amplius vincere non
conabimur. Illud interim constanter et diserte monemus; his modis, qui
in usu sunt, nec magnos in scientiarum doctrinis et contemplatione
progressus fieri, nec illas ad amplitudinem operum deduci posse.</p>
<ol start="129" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Superest ut de Finis excellentia pauca dicamus. Ea si prius dicta
fuissent, votis similia videri potuissent: sed spe jam facta, et iniquis
praejudiciis sublatis, plus fortasse ponderis habebunt. Quod si nos
omnia perfecissemus et plane absolvissemus, nec alios in partem et
consortium laborum subinde vocaremus, etiam ab hujusmodi verbis
abstinuissemus, ne acciperentur in praedicationem meriti nostri. Cum
vero aliorum industria acuenda sit et animi excitandi atque accendendi,
consentaneum est ut quaedam hominibus in mentem redigamus.</p>
<p>Primo itaque, videtur inventorum nobilium introductio inter actiones
humanas longe primas partes tenere: id quod antiqua saecula
judicaverunt. Ea enim rerum inventoribus divinos honores tribuerunt; iis
autem qui in rebus civilibus merebantur (quales erant urbium et
imperiorum conditores, legislatores, patriarum a diuturnis malis
liberatores, tyrannidum debellatores, et his similes), heroum tantum
honores decreverunt. Atque certe si quis ea recte conferat, justum hoc
prisci saeculi judicium reperiet. Etenim inventorum beneficia ad
universum genus humanum pertinere possunt, civilia ad certas tantummodo
hominum sedes: haec etiam non ultra paucas aetates durant, illa quasi
perpetuis temporibus. Atque status emendatio in civilibus non sine vi et
perturbatione plerumque procedit: at inventa beant, et beneficium
deferunt absque alicujus injuria aut tristitia.</p>
<p>Etiam inventa quasi novae creationes sunt, et divinorum operum
imitamenta; ut bene cecinit ille:</p>
<p>’Primum frugiferos foetus mortalibus aegris</p>
<p>Dididerant quondam praestanti nomine Athenae;</p>
<p>Et RECREAVERUNT vitam, legesque rogarunt.’</p>
<p>Atque videtur notatu dignum in Solomone; quod cum imperio, auro,
magnificentia operum, satellitio, famulitio, classe insuper, et nominis
claritate, ac summa hominum admiratione floreret, tamen nihil horum
delegerit sibi ad gloriam sed ita pronuntiaverit: Gloriam Dei esse,
celare rem; gloriam regis, investigare rem.</p>
<p>Rursus (si placet) reputet quipiam, quantum intersit inter hominum
vitam in excultissima quapiam Europae provincia, et in regione aliqua
Novae Indiae maxime fera et barbara: ea tantum differre existimabit, ut
merito hominem homini Deum esse, non solum propter auxilium et
beneficium, sed etiam per status comparationem, recte dici possit. Atque
hoc non solum, non coelum, non corpora, sed artes praestant.</p>
<p>Rursus, vim et virtutem et consequentias rerum inventarum notare
juvat; quae non in aliis manifestius occurrunt, quam in illis tribus
quae antiquis incognitae, et quarum primordia, licet recentia, obscura
et ingloria sunt: Artis nimirum Imprimendi, Pulveris Tormentarii, et
Acus Nauticae. Haec enim tria rerum faciem et statum in orbe terrarum
mutaverunt: primum, in re literaria; secundum, in re bellica; tertium,
in navigationibus: unde innumerae rerum mutationes sequutae sunt; ut non
imperium aliquod, non secta, non stella, majorem efficaciam et quasi
influxum super res humanas exercuisse videatur, quam ista mechanica
exercuerunt.</p>
<p>Praeterea non abs re fuerit, tria hominum ambitionis genera et quasi
gradus distinguere. Primum eorum, qui propriam potentiam in patria sua
amplificare cupiunt; quod genus vulgare est et degener. Secundum eorum,
qui patriae potentiam et imperium inter humanum genus amplificare
nituntur; illud plus certe habet dignitatis, cupiditatis haud minus.
Quod si quis humani generis ipsius potentiam et imperium in rerum
universitatem instaurare et amplificare conetur, ea proculdubio ambitio
(si modo ita vocanda sit) reliquis et sanior est et augustior. Hominis
autem imperium in res, in solis artibus et scientiis ponitur. Naturae
enim non imperatur, nisi parendo.</p>
<p>Praeterea, si unius alicujus particularis inventi utilitas ita
homines affecerit, ut eum qui genus humanum universum beneficio aliquo
devincire potuerit homine majorem putaverint; quanto celsius videbitur
tale aliquid invenire, per quod alia omnia expedite inveniri possint? Et
tamen (ut verum omnino dicamus) quemadmodum luci magnam habemus gratiam,
quod per eam vias inire, artes exercere, legere, nos invicem dignoscere
possimus; et nihilominus ipsa visio lucis res praestantior est et
pulchrior, quam multiplex ejus usus: ita certe ipsa contemplatio rerum
prout sunt, sine superstitione aut impostura, errore aut confusione, in
seipsa magis digna est, quam universus inventorum fructus.</p>
<p>Postremo, siquis depravationem scientiarum et artium ad malitiam et
luxuriam et similia objecerit; id neminem moveat. Illud enim de omnibus
mundanis bonis dici potest, ingenio, fortitudine, viribus, forma,
divitiis, luce ipsa, et reliquis. Recuperet modo genus humanum jus suum
in naturam quod ei ex dotatione divina competit, et detur ei copia: usum
vero recta ratio et sana religio gubernabit.</p>
<ol start="130" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Jam vero tempus est ut artem ipsam Interpretandi Naturam proponamus:
in qua licet nos utilissima et verissima praecepisse arbitremur, tamen
necessitatem ei absolutam (ac si absque ea nil agi possit) aut etiam
perfectionem non attribuimus. Etenim in ea opinione sumus: si justam
Naturae et Experientiae Historiam praesto haberent homines, atque in ea
sedulo versarentur, sibique duas res imperare possent; unam, ut receptas
opiniones et notiones deponerent; alteram, ut mentem a generalissimis et
proximis ab illis ad tempus cohiberent; fore ut etiam vi propria et
genuina mentis, absque alia arte, in formam nostram Interpretandi
incidere possent. Est enim Interpretatio verum et naturale opus mentis,
demptis iis quae obstant: sed tamen omnia certe per nostra praecepta
erunt magis in procinctu, et multo firmiora.</p>
<p>Neque tamen illis nihil addi posse affirmamus: sed contra, nos, qui
mentem respicimus non tantum in facultate propria, sed quatenus
copulatur cum rebus, Artem inveniendi cum Inventis adolescere posse,
statuere debemus.</p>

<p>Super datum corpus novam naturam sive novas naturas generare et
superinducere, opus et intentio est humanae potentiae. Datae autem
naturae Formam, sive differentiam veram, sive naturam naturantem, sive
fontem emanationis (ista enim vocabula habemus, quae ad indicationem rei
proxime accedunt) invenire, opus et intentio est humanae scientiae.
Atque his operibus primariis subordinantur alia opera duo secundaria et

aliud, intra terminos Possibilis; posteriori, inventio in omni

<p>Quam infeliciter se habeat scientia humana, quae in usu est, etiam ex
illis liquet quae vulgo asseruntur. Recte ponitur; Vere scire, esse per
causas scire. Etiam non male constituuntur causae quatuor; Materia,
Forma, Efficiens, et Finis. At ex his causa finalis tantum abest ut
prosit, ut etiam scientias corrumpat, nisi in hominis actionibus. Formae
inventio habetur pro desperata. Efficiens vero, et materia (quales
quaeruntur et recipiuntur, remotae scilicet, absque latenti processu ad
formam) res perfunctoriae sunt, et superficiales, et nihili fere ad
scientiam veram et activam. Neque tamen obliti sumus nos superius
notasse et correxisse errorem mentis humanae, in deferendo formis primas
essentiae. Licet enim in natura nihil vere existat praeter corpora
individua, edentia actus puros individuos ex lege; in doctrinis tamen,
illa ipsa lex, ejusque inquisitio et inventio atque explicatio, pro
fundamento est tam ad sciendum, quam ad operandum. Eam autem legem,
ejusque paragraphos, formarum nomine intelligimus; praesertim cum hoc
vocabulum invaluerit, et familiariter occurrat.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Qui causam alicujus naturae (veluti albedinis aut caloris) in certis
tantum subjectis novit; ejus scientia imperfecta est: et qui effectum
super certas tantum materias (inter eas, quae sunt susceptibiles)
inducere potest; ejus potentia pariter imperfecta est. At qui
efficientem et materialem causam tantummodo novit (quae causae fluxae
sunt, et nihil aliud quam vehicula et causae formam deferentes in
aliquibus), is ad nova inventa, in materia aliquatenus simili et
praeparata, pervenire potest; sed rerum terminos altius fixos non movet.
At qui formas novit, is naturae unitatem in materiis dissimillimis
complectitur; itaque quae adhuc facta non sunt, qualia nec naturae
vicissitudines, neque experimentales industriae, neque casus ipse, in
actum unquam perduxissent, neque cogitationem humanam subitura fuissent,
detegere et producere potest. Quare ex formarum inventione sequitur
contemplatio vera, et operatio libera.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Licet viae ad potentiam atque ad scientiam humanam conjunctissimae
sint et fere eaedem, tamen propter perniciosam et inveteratam
consuetudinem versandi in abstractis, tutius omnino est ordiri et
excitare scientias ab iis fundamentis quae in ordine sunt ad partem
activam, atque ut illa ipsa partem contemplativam signet et determinet.
Videndum itaque est, ad aliquam naturam super corpus datum generandam et
superinducendam, quale quis praeceptum aut qualem quis directionem aut
deductionem maxime optaret; idque sermone simplici et minime
abstruso.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; si quis argento cupiat superinducere flavum colorem
auri aut augmentum ponderis (servatis legibus materiae), aut lapidi
alicui non diaphano diaphaneitatem, aut vitro tenacitatem, aut corpori
alicui non vegetabili vegetationem; videndum (inquam) est, quale quis
praeceptum aut deductionem potissimum sibi dari exoptet. Atque primo,
exoptabit aliquis proculdubio sibi monstrari aliquid hujusmodi, quod
opere non frustret neque experimento fallat. Secundo, exoptabit quis
aliquid sibi praescribi, quod ipsum non astringat et coerceat ad media
quaedam et modos quosdam operandi particulares. Fortasse enim
destituetur, nec habebit facultatem et commoditatem talia media
comparandi et procurandi. Quod si sint et alia media et alii modi
(praeter illud praeceptum) progignendae talis naturae, ea fortasse ex
iis erunt quae sunt in operantis potestate; a quibus nihilominus per
angustias praecepti excludetur, nec fructum capiet. Tertio, optabit
aliquid sibi monstrari, quod non sit aeque difficile ac illa ipsa
operatio de qua inquiritur, sed propius accedat ad praxin.</p>
<p>Itaque de praecepto vero et perfecto operandi, pronuntiatum erit
tale; ut sit certum, liberum, et disponens sive in ordine ad actionem.
Atque hoc ipsum idem est cum inventione formae verae. Etenim forma
naturae alicujus talis est ut, ea posita, natura data infallibiliter
sequatur. Itaque adest perpetuo, quando natura illa adest, atque eam
universaliter affirmat, atque inest omni. Eadem forma talis est ut, ea
amota, natura data infallibiliter fugiat. Itaque abest perpetuo, quando
natura illa abest, eamque perpetuo abnegat, atque inest soli. Postremo,
forma vera talis est, ut naturam datam ex fonte aliquo essentiae deducat
quae inest pluribus, et notior est naturae (ut loquuntur) quam ipsa
forma. Itaque de axiomate vero et perfecto sciendi pronuntiatum et
praeceptum tale est; ut inveniatur natura alia, quae sit cum natura data
convertibilis, et tamen sit limitatio naturae notioris, instar generis
veri. Ista autem duo pronuntiata, activum et contemplativum, res eadem
sunt; et quod in operando utilissimum, id in sciendo verissimum.</p>
<ol start="22" type="A">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At praeceptum sive axioma de transformatione corporum duplicis est
generis. Primum intuetur corpus, ut turmam sive conjugationem naturarum
simplicium: ut in auro haec conveniunt; quod sit flavum; quod sit
ponderosum, ad pondus tale; quod sit malleabile aut ductile, ad
extensionem talem; quod non fiat volatile, nec deperdat de quanto suo
per ignem; quod fluat fluore tali; quod separetur et solvatur modis
talibus; et similiter de caeteris naturis, quae in auro concurrunt.
Itaque hujusmodi axioma rem deducit ex formis naturarum simplicium. Nam
qui formas et modos novit superinducendi flavi, ponderis, ductilis,
fixi, fluoris, solutionum, et sic de reliquis, et eorum graduationes et
modos, videbit et curabit ut ista conjungi possint in aliquo corpore,
unde sequatur transformatio in aurum. Atque hoc genus operandi pertinet
ad actionem primariam. Eadem enim est ratio generandi naturam unam
aliquam simplicem, et plures; nisi quod arctetur magis restringatur homo
in operando, si plures requirantur, propter difficultatem tot naturas
coadunandi; quae non facile conveniunt, nisi per vias naturae tritas et
ordinarias. Utcunque tamen dicendum est, quod iste modus operandi (qui
naturas intuetur simplices, licet in corpore concreto) procedat ex iis,
quae in natura sunt constantia et aeterna et catholica, et latas
praebeat potentiae humanae vias, quales (ut nunc sunt res) cogitatio
humana vix capere aut repraesentare possit.</p>
<p>At secundum genus axiomatis (quod a latentis processus inventione
pendet) non per naturas simplices procedit, sed per concreta corpora,
quemadmodum in natura inveniuntur, cursu ordinario. Exempli gratia; in
casu ubi fit inquisitio, ex quibus initiis, et quo modo, et quo
processu, aurum aut aliud quodvis metallum aut lapis generetur, a primis
menstruis aut rudimentis suis usque ad mineram perfectam; aut similiter,
quo processu herbae generentur, a primis concretionibus succorum in
terra, aut a seminibus, usque ad plantam formatam, cum universa illa
successione motus, et diversis et continuatis naturae nixibus;
similiter, de generatione ordinatim explicata animalium, ab initu ad
partum; et similiter de corporibus aliis.</p>
<p>Enimvero neque ad generationes corporum tantum spectat haec
inquisitio, sed etiam ad alios motus et opificia naturae. Exempli
gratia; in casu ubi fit inquisitio de universa serie et continuatis
actionibus alimentandi, a prima receptione alimenti ad assimilationem
perfectam; aut similiter de motu voluntario in animalibus, a prima
impressione imaginationis et continuatis nixibus spiritus usque ad
flexiones et motus artuum; aut de explicato motu linguae et labiorum et
instrumentorum reliquorum usque ad editionem vocum articulatarum. Nam
haec quoque spectant ad naturas concretas, sive collegiatas et in
fabrica; et intuentur veluti consuetudines naturae particulares et
speciales, non leges fundamentales et communes, quae constituunt formas.
Veruntamen omnino fatendum est, rationem istam videri expeditiorem et
magis sitam in propinquo, et spem injicere magis, quam illam
primariam.</p>
<p>At pars Operativa similiter, quae huic parti Contemplativae
respondet, operationem extendit et promovet ab iis quae ordinario in
natura inveniuntur ad quaedam proxima, aut a proximis non admodum
remota; sed altiores et radicales operationes super naturam pendent
utique ab axiomatibus primariis. Quinetiam ubi non datur homini facultas
operandi, sed tantum sciendi, ut in coelestibus (neque enim ceditur
homini operari in coelestia, aut ea immutare aut transformare), tamen
inquisitio facti ipsius sive veritatis rei, non minus quam cognitio
causarum et consensuum, ad primaria illa et catholica axiomata de
naturis simplicibus (veluti de natura rotationis spontaneae,
attractionis sive virtutis magneticae, et aliorum complurium quae magis
communia sunt quam ipsa coelestia) refertur. Neque enim speret aliquis
terminare quaestionem, utrum in motu diurno revera terra aut coelum
rotet, nisi naturam rotationis spontaneae prius comprehenderit.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Latens autem Processus, de quo loquimur, longe alia res est quam
animis hominum (qualiter nunc obsidentur) facile possit occurrere. Neque
enim intelligimus mensuras quasdam, aut signa, aut scalas processus in
corporibus spectabiles; sed plane processum continuatum, qui maxima ex
parte sensum fugit.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; in omni generatione et transformatione corporum,
inquirendum quid deperdatur et evolet, quid maneat, quid accedat; quid
dilatetur, quid contrahatur; quid uniatur, quid separetur; quid
continuetur, quid abscindatur; quid impellat, quid impediat; quid
dominetur, quid succumbat; et alia complura.</p>
<p>Neque hic rursus, haec tantum in generatione aut transformatione
corporum quaerenda sunt; sed et in omnibus aliis alterationibus et
motibus similiter inquirendum quid antecedat, quid succedat; quid sit
incitatius, quid remissius; quid motum praebeat, quid regat; et
hujusmodi. Ista vero omnia scientiis (quae nunc pinguissima Minerva et
prorsus inhabili contexuntur) incognita sunt et intacta. Cum enim omnis
actio naturalis per minima transigatur, aut saltem per illa quae sunt
minora quam ut sensum feriant, nemo se naturam regere aut vertere posse
speret, nisi illa debito modo comprehenderit et notaverit.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Similiter, inquisitio et inventio latentis schematismi in corporibus
res nova est, non minus quam inventio latentis processus et formae.
Versamur enim plane adhuc in atriis naturae, neque ad interiora paramus
aditum. At nemo corpus datum nova natura dotare vel in novum corpus
foeliciter et apposite transmutare potest, nisi corporis alterandi aut
transformandi bonam habuerit notitiam. In modos enim vanos incurret, aut
saltem difficiles et perversos, nec pro corporis natura in quod
operatur. Itaque ad hoc etiam via plane est aperienda et munienda.</p>
<p>Atque in anatomia corporum organicorum (qualia sunt hominis et
animalium) opera sane recte et utiliter insumitur, et videtur res
subtilis et scrutinium naturae bonum. At hoc genus anatomiae spectabile
est, et sensui subjectum, et in corporibus tantum organicis locum habet.
Verum hoc ipsum obvium quiddam est, et in promptu situm, prae anatomia
vera schematismi latentis in corporibus quae habentur pro similaribus:
praesertim in rebus specificatis et earum partibus, ut ferri, lapidis;
et partibus similaribus plantae, animalis, veluti radicis, folii,
floris, carnis, sanguinis, ossis, etc. At etiam in hoc genere non
prorsus cessavit industria humana; hoc ipsum enim innuit separatio
corporum similarium per distillationes et alios solutionum modos, ut
dissimilaritas compositi per congregationem partium homogenearum
appareat. Quod etiam ex usu est, et facit ad id quod quaerimus; licet
saepius res fallax sit; quia complures naturae separationi imputantur et
attribuuntur, ac si prius substitissent in composito, quas revera ignis
et calor et alii modi apertionum de novo indunt et superinducunt. Sed et
haec quoque parva pars est operis, ad inveniendum schematismum verum in
composito; qui schematismus res est longe subtilior et accuratior, et ab
operibus ignis potius confunditur quam eruitur et elucescit.</p>
<p>Itaque facienda est corporum separatio et solutio; non per ignem
certe, sed per rationem et inductionem veram, cum experimentis
auxiliaribus; et per comparationem ad alia corpora, et reductionem ad
naturas simplices et earum formas, quae in composito conveniunt et
complicantur; et transeundum plane a Vulcano ad Minervam, si in animo
sit veras corporum texturas et schematismos (unde omnis occulta atque,
ut vocant, specifica proprietas et virtus in rebus pendet; unde etiam
omnis potentis alterationis et transformationis norma educitur) in lucem
protrahere.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; inquirendum, quid sit in omni corpore spiritus, quid
essentiae tangibilis; atque ille ipse spiritus, utrum sit copiosus et
turgeat, an jejunus et paucus; tenuis, aut crassior; magis aereus, aut
igneus; acris, aut deses; exilis, aut robustus; in progressu, aut in
regressu; abscissus, aut continuatus; consentiens cum externis et
ambientibus, aut dissentiens; etc. Et similiter, essentia tangibilis
(quae non pauciores recipit differentias, quam spiritus) atque ejus
villi, et fibrae, et omnimoda textura; rursus autem collocatio spiritus
per corpoream molem, ejusque pori, meatus, venae, et cellulae, et
rudimenta, sive tentamenta corporis organici, sub eandem inquisitionem
cadunt. Sed et in his quoque, atque adeo in omni latentis schematismi
inventione, lux vera et clara ab axiomatibus primariis immittitur, quae
certe caliginem omnem et subtilitatem discutit.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque propterea res deducetur ad atomum, quae praesupponit vacuum et
materiam non fluxam (quorum utrumque falsum est) sed ad particulas
veras, quales inveniuntur. Neque rursus est, quod exhorreat quispiam
istam subtilitatem, ut inexplicabilem; sed contra, quo magis vergit
inquisitio ad naturas simplices, eo magis omnia erunt sita in plano et
perspicuo; translato negotio a multiplici in simplex, et ab
incommensurabili ad commensurabile, et a surdo ad computabile, et ab
infinito et vago ad definitum et certum; ut fit in elementis literarum,
et tonis concentuum. Optime autem cedit inquisitio naturalis, quando
physicum terminatur in mathematico. At rursus multitudinem aut
fractiones nemo reformidet. In rebus enim, quae per numeros
transiguntur, tam facile quis posuerit aut cogitaverit millenarium, quam
unum; aut millesimam partem unius, quam unum integrum.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Ex duobus generibus axiomatum, quae superius posita sunt, oritur vera
divisio philosophiae et scientiarum; translatis vocabulis receptis (quae
ad indicationem rei proxime accedunt) ad sensum nostrum. Videlicet, ut
inquisitio formarum, quae sunt (ratione certe, et sua lege) aeternae et
immobiles, constituat metaphysicam; inquisitio vero efficientis, et
materiae, et latentis processus, et latentis schematismi (quae omnia
cursum naturae communem et ordinarium, non leges fundamentales et
aeternas respiciunt) constituat physicam: atque his subordinentur
similiter practicae duae; physicae mechanica; metaphysicae (perpurgato
nomine) magia, propter latas ejus vias et majus imperium in naturam.</p>
<ol start="24" type="A">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Posito itaque doctrinae scopo, pergendum ad praecepta; idque ordine
minime perverso aut perturbato. Atque indicia de interpretatione naturae
complectuntur partes in genere duas; primam, de educendis aut excitandis
axiomatibus ab experientia; secundam, de deducendis aut derivandis
experimentis novis ab axiomatibus. Prior autem trifariam dividitur: in
tres nempe ministrationes; ministrationem ad sensum, ministrationem ad
memoriam, et ministrationem ad mentem sive rationem.</p>
<p>Primo enim paranda est historia naturalis et experimentalis,
sufficiens et bona; quod fundamentum rei est: neque enim fingendum, aut
excogitandum, sed inveniendum, quid natura faciat aut ferat.</p>
<p>Historia vero naturalis et experimentalis tam varia est et sparsa, ut
intellectum confundat et disgreget, nisi sistatur et compareat ordine
idoneo. Itaque formandae sunt tabulae et coordinationes instantiarum,
tali modo et instructione ut in eas agere possit intellectus.</p>
<p>Id quoque licet fiat, tamen intellectus sibi permissus, et sponte
movens, incompetens est et inhabilis ad opificium axiomatum, nisi
regatur et muniatur. Itaque tertio, adhibenda est inductio legitima et
vera, quae ipsa clavis est interpretationis. Incipiendum autem est a
fine, et retro pergendum ad reliqua.</p>
<ol start="11" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inquisitio formarum sic procedit; super naturam datam primo facienda
est comparentia ad intellectum omnium instantiarum notarum, quae in
eadem natura conveniunt, per materias licet dissimillimas. Atque
hujusmodi collectio facienda est historice, absque contemplatione
praefestina, aut subtilitate aliqua majore. Exempli gratia; in

<p>Ad 2am 2a.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Radii solis in media (quam vocant) regione aeris non calefaciunt;
cujus ratio vulgo non male redditur; quia regio illa nec satis
appropinquat ad corpus solis, unde radii emanant, nec etiam ad terram,
unde reflectuntur. Atque hoc liquet ex fastigiis montium (nisi sint
praealti), ubi nives perpetuo durant. Sed contra notatum est a
nonnullis, quod in cacumine Picus de Tenariph, atque etiam in Andis
Peruviae, ipsa fastigia montium nive destituta sint; nivibus jacentibus
tantum inferius in ascensu. Atque insuper aer illis ipsis verticibus
montium deprehenditur minime frigidus, sed tenuis tantum et acer; adeo
ut in Andis pungat et vulneret oculos per nimiam acrimoniam, atque etiam
pungat os ventriculi, et inducat vomitum. Atque ab antiquis notatum est,
in vertice Olympi tantam fuisse aeris tenuitatem, ut necesse fuerit
illis qui eo ascenderant secum deferre spongias aceto et aqua
madefactas, easque ad os et nares subinde apponere, quia aer ob
tenuitatem non sufficiebat respirationi: in quo vertice etiam relatum
est, tantam fuisse serenitatem et tranquillitatem a pluviis et nivibus
et ventis, ut sacrificantibus literae descriptae digito in cineribus
sacrificiorum super aram Jovis, manerent in annum proximum absque ulla
perturbatione. Atque etiam hodie ascendentes ad verticem Picus de
Tenariph eo vadunt noctu et non interdiu; et paulo post ortum solis
monentur et excitantur a ducibus suis ut festinent descendere, propter
periculum (ut videtur) a tenuitate aeris, ne solvat spiritus et
suffocet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ad 2am 3a.</p>
<p>Reflexio radiorum solis, in regionibus prope circulos polares,
admodum debilis et inefficax invenitur in calore: adeo ut Belgae, qui
hybernarunt in Nova Zembla, cum expectarent navis suae liberationem et
deobstructionem a glaciali mole (quae eam obsederat) per initia mensis
Julii spe sua frustrati sint, et coacti scaphae se committere. Itaque
radii solis directi videntur parum posse, etiam super terram planam; nec
reflexi etiam, nisi multiplicentur et uniantur, quod fit cum sol magis
vergit ad perpendiculum, quia tum incidentia radiorum facit angulos
acutiores, ut lineae radiorum sint magis in propinquo: ubi contra in
magnis obliquitatibus solis anguli sint valde obtusi, et proinde lineae
radiorum magis distantes. Sed interim notandum est, multas esse posse
operationes radiorum solis, atque etiam ex natura calidi, quae non sunt
proportionatae ad tactum nostrum: adeo ut respectu nostri non operentur
usque ad calefactionem, sed respectu aliorum nonnullorum corporum
exequantur opera calidi.</p>
<p>Ad 2am 4a.</p>
<p>Fiat hujusmodi experimentum. Accipiatur speculum fabricatum contra ac
fit in speculis comburentibus, et interponatur inter manum et radios
solis; et fiat observatio, utrum minuat calorem solis, quemadmodum
speculum comburens eundem auget et intendit. Manifestum est enim, quoad
radios opticos, prout fabricatur speculum in densitate inaequali
respectu medii et laterum, ita apparere simulachra magis diffusa aut
magis contracta. Itaque idem videndum in calore.</p>
<p>Ad 2am 5a.</p>
<p>Fiat experimentum diligenter, utrum per specula comburentia
fortissima et optime fabricata radii lunae possint excipi et colligi in
aliquem vel minimum gradum teporis. Is vero gradus teporis si fortasse
nimis subtilis et debilis fuerit, ut ad tactum percipi et deprehendi non
possit, confugiendum erit ad vitra illa quae indicant constitutionem
aeris calidam aut frigidam; ita ut radii lunae per speculum comburens
incidant et jaciantur in summitatem vitri hujusmodi; atque tum notetur,
si fiat depressio aquae per teporem.</p>
<p>Ad 2am 6a.</p>
<p>Practicetur etiam vitrum comburens super calidum, quod non sit
radiosum aut luminosum; ut ferri et lapidis calefacti sed non igniti,
aut aquae ferventis, aut similium; et notetur utrum fiat augmentum et

<p>Cometarum (si et illos numerare inter meteora libuerit) non
deprehenditur constans aut manifestus effectus in augendis ardoribus
anni, licet siccitates saepius inde sequi notatae sint. Quinetiam trabes
et columnae lucidae et chasmata et similia apparent saepius temporibus
hybernis quam aestivis; et maxime per intensissima frigora, sed
conjuncta cum siccitatibus. Fulmina tamen et coruscationes et tonitrua
raro eveniunt hyeme, sed sub tempus magnorum fervorum. At stellae (quas
vocant) cadentes existimantur vulgo magis constare ex viscosa aliqua
materia splendida et accensa, quam esse naturae igneae fortioris. Sed de
hoc inquiratur ulterius.</p>
<p>Ad 4am 9a.</p>
<p>Sunt quaedam coruscationes quae praebent lumen sed non urunt; eae
vero semper fiunt sine tonitru.</p>
<p>Ad 5am 10a.</p>
<p>Eructationes et eruptiones flammarum inveniuntur non minus in
regionibus frigidis quam calidis; ut in Islandia et Groenlandia:
quemadmodum et arbores per regiones frigidas magis sunt quandoque
inflammabiles et magis piceae ac resinosae quam per regiones calidas; ut
fit in abiete, pinu, et reliquis: verum in quali situ et natura soli
hujusmodi eruptiones fieri soleant, ut possimus affirmativae subjungere
negativam, non satis quaesitum est.</p>
<p>Ad 6am 11a.</p>
<p>Omnis flamma perpetuo est calida magis aut minus, neque omnino
subjungitur negativa: et tamen referunt ignem fatuum (quem vocant), qui
etiam aliquando impingitur in parietem, non multum habere caloris;
fortasse instar flammae spiritus vini, quae clemens et lenis est. Sed
adhuc lenior videtur ea flamma quae in nonnullis historiis fidis et
gravibus invenitur apparuisse circa capita et comas puerorum et
virginum; quae nullo modo comas adurebat, sed molliter circum eas
trepidabat. Atque certissimum est, circa equum in itinere sudantem noctu
et suda tempestate apparuisse quandoque coruscationem quandam absque
manifesto calore. Atque paucis abhinc annis, notissimum est et pro
miraculo quasi habitum gremiale cujusdam puellae paulo motum aut
fricatum coruscasse; quod fortasse factum est ob alumen aut sales quibus
gremiale tinctum erat paulo crassius haerentia et incrustata, et ex
fricatione fracta. Atque certissimum est saccharum omne, sive conditum
(ut vocant) sive simplex, modo sit durius, in tenebris fractum aut
cultello scalptum coruscare. Similiter aqua marina et salsa noctu
interdum invenitur, remis fortiter percussa, coruscare. Atque etiam in
tempestatibus spuma maris fortiter agitata noctu coruscat; quam
coruscationem Hispani pulmonem marinum vocant. De illa flamma autem quam
antiqui nautae vocabant Castorem et Pollucem, et moderni Focum Sancti
Ermi, qualem calorem habeat non satis quaesitum est.</p>
<p>Ad 7am 12a.</p>
<p>Omne ignitum ita ut vertatur in ruborem igneum etiam sine flamma
perpetuo calidum est, neque huic affirmativae subjungitur negativa; sed
quod in proximo est videtur esse lignum putre, quod splendet noctu neque
tamen deprehenditur calidum; et squamae piscium putrescentes, quae etiam
splendent noctu, nec inveniuntur ad tactum calidae; neque etiam corpus
cicindelae aut muscae (quam vocant luciolam) calidum ad tactum
deprehenditur.</p>
<p>Ad 8am 13a.</p>
<p>De balneis calidis, in quo situ et natura soli emanare soleant, non
satis quaesitum est; itaque non subjungitur negativa.</p>
<p>Ad 9am 14a</p>
<p>Liquidis ferventibus subjungitur negativa ipsius liquidi in natura
sua. Nullum enim invenitur liquidum tangibile quod sit in natura sua et
maneat constanter calidum, sed superinducitur ad tempus tantum calor, ut
natura ascititia: adeo ut quae potestate et operatione sunt maxime
calida, ut spiritus vini, olea aromatum chymica, etiam olea vitrioli et
sulphuris, et similia, quae paulo post adurunt, ad primum tactum sint
frigida. Aqua autem balneorum naturalium excepta in vas aliquod et
separata a fontibus suis defervescit perinde ac aqua igne calefacta. At
verum est corpora oleosa ad tactum paulo minus esse frigida quam aquea;
ut oleum minus quam aqua, sericum minus quam linteum. Verum hoc pertinet
ad Tabulam Graduum de Frigido.</p>
<p>Ad 10am 15a.</p>
<p>Similiter vapori fervido subjungitur negativa naturae ipsius vaporis,
qualis apud nos invenitur. Etenim exhalationes ex oleosis, licet facile
inflammabiles, tamen non inveniuntur calidae, nisi a corpore calido
recenter exhalaverint.</p>
<p>Ad 10am 16a.</p>
<p>Similiter aeri ipsi ferventi subjungitur negativa naturae aeris
ipsius. Neque enim invenitur apud nos aer calidus; nisi fuerit aut
conclusus, aut attritus, aut manifeste calefactus a sole, igne, aut
aliquo alio corpore calido.</p>
<p>Ad 11am 17a.</p>
<p>Subjungitur negativa tempestatum frigidarum magis quam pro ratione
temporis anni, quae eveniunt apud nos flante Euro et Borea; quemadmodum
et contrariae tempestates eveniunt flante Austro et Zephyro. Etaim
inclinatio ad pluviam (praesertim temporibus hyemalibus) comitatur
tempestatem tepidam; at gelu contra frigidam.</p>
<p>Ad 12am 18a.</p>
<p>Subjungitur negativa aeris conclusi in cavernis tempore aestivo. At
de aere concluso omnino diligentius inquirendum. Primo enim non absque
causa in dubitationem venit, qualis sit natura aeris quatenus ad calidum
et frigidum in natura sua propria. Recipit enim aer calidum manifesto ex
impressione coelestium; frigidum autem fortasse ab expiratione terrae;
et rursus in media (quam vocant) regione aeris a vaporibus frigidis et
nivibus: ut nullum judicium fieri possit de aeris natura per aerem qui
foras est et sub dio, sed verius foret judicium per aerem conclusum.
Atqui opus est etiam ut aer concludatur in tali vasi et materia quae nec
ipsa imbuat aerem calido vel frigido ex vi propria, nec facile admittat
vim aeris extranei. Fiat itaque experimentum per ollam figularem
multiplici corio obductam ad muniendam ipsam ab aere extraneo, facta
mora per tres aut quatuor dies in vase bene occluso; deprehensio autem
fit post apertionem vasis vel per manum vel per vitrum graduum ordine
applicatum.</p>
<p>Ad 13am 19a.</p>
<p>Subest similiter dubitatio, utrum tepor in lana et pellibus et plumis
et hujusmodi fiat ex quodam exili calore inhaerente, quatenus
excernuntur ab animalibus; aut etiam ob pinguedinem quandam et
oleositatem, quae sit naturae congruae cum tepore; vel plane ob
conclusionem et fractionem aeris, ut in articulo praecedente dictum est.
Videtur enim omnis aer abscissus a continuitate aeris forinseci habere
nonnihil teporis. Itaque fiat experimentum in fibrosis quae fiunt ex
lino; non ex lana aut plumis aut serico, quae excernuntur ab animatis.
Notandum est etiam, omnes pulveres (ubi manifesto includitur aer) minus
esse frigidos quam corpora integra ipsorum; quemadmodum etiam
existimamus omnem spumam (utpote quae aerem contineat) minus esse
frigidam quam liquorem ipsum.</p>
<p>Ad 14am 20a.</p>
<p>Huic non subjungitur negativa. Nihil enim reperitur apud nos sive
tangibile sive spiritale, quod admotum igni non excipiat calorem. In eo
tamen differunt, quod alia excipiant calorem citius, ut aer, oleum, et
aqua; alia tardius, ut lapis et metalla. Verum hoc pertinet ad Tabulam
Graduum.</p>
<p>Ad 15am 21a.</p>
<p>Huic Instantiae non subjungitur negativa alia, quam ut bene notetur
non excitari scintillas ex silice et chalybe aut alia aliqua substantia
dura nisi ubi excutiuntur minutiae aliquae ex ipsa substantia lapidis
vel metalli, neque aerem attritum unquam per se generare scintillas, ut
vulgo putant; quin et ipsae illae scintillae ex pondere corporis igniti
magis vergunt deorsum quam sursum, et in extinctione redeunt in quandam
fuliginem corpoream.</p>
<p>Ad 16am 22a.</p>
<p>Existimamus huic instantiae non subjungi negativam. Nullum enim
invenitur apud nos corpus tangibile, quod non ex attritione manifesto
calescat; adeo ut veteres somniarent non inesse coelestibus aliam viam
aut virtutem calefaciendi nisi ex attritione aeris per rotationem
rapidam et incitatam. Verum in hoc genere ulterius inquirendum est,
utrum corpora quae emittuntur ex machinis (qualia sunt pilae ex
tormentis) non ex ipsa percussione contrahant aliquem gradum caloris;
adeo ut postquam deciderint inveniantur nonnihil calida. At aer motus
magis infrigidat quam calefacit; ut in ventis et follibus et flatu oris
contracti. Verum hujusmodi motus non est tam rapidus ut excitet calorem,
et fit secundum totum, non per particulas; ut mirum non sit, si non
generet calorem.</p>
<p>Ad 17am 23a.</p>
<p>Circa hanc instantiam facienda est inquisitio diligentior. Videntur
enim herbae et vegetabilia viridia et humida aliquid habere in se
occulti caloris. Ille vero calor tam tenuis est ut in singulis non
percipiatur ad tactum; verum postquam illa adunata sint et conclusa, ut
spiritus ipsorum non expiret in aerem sed se invicem foveat, tum vero
oritur calor manifestus, et nonnunquam flamma in materia congrua.</p>
<p>Ad 18am 24a.</p>
<p>Etiam circa hanc instantiam diligentior facienda est inquisitio.
Videtur enim calx viva aqua aspersa concipere calorem vel propter
unionem caloris qui antea distrahebatur (ut ante dictum est de herbis
conclusis), vel ob irritationem ex exasperationem spiritus ignei ab
aqua, ut fiat quidam conflictus et antiperistasis. Utra vero res sit in
causa facilius apparebit, si loco aquae immittatur oleum; oleum enim
aeque ac aqua valebit ad unionem spiritus inclusi, sed non ad
irritationem. Etiam faciendum est experimentum latius tam in cineribus
et calcibus diversorum corporum, quam per immissionem diversorum
liquorum.</p>
<p>Ad 19am 25a.</p>
<p>Huic instantiae subjungitur negativa aliorum metallorum, quae sunt
magis mollia et fluxa. Etenim bracteolae auri, solutae in liquorem per
aquam regis, nullum dant calorem ad tactum in dissolutione; neque
similiter plumbum in aqua forti; neque etiam argentum vivum (ut memini);
sed argentum ipsum parum excitat caloris, atque etiam cuprum (ut
memini), sed magis manifesto stannum, atque omnium maxime ferrum et
chalybs, quae non solum fortem excitant calorem in dissolutione, sed
etiam violentam ebullitionem. Itaque videtur calor fieri per conflictum,
cum aquae fortes penetrant et fodiunt et divellunt partes corporis, et
corpora ipsa resistunt. Ubi vero corpora facilius cedunt, vix excitatur
calor.</p>
<p>Ad 20am 26a.</p>
<p>Calori animalium nulla subjungitur negativa, nisi insectorum (ut
dictum est) ob parvitatem corporis. Etenim in piscibus collatis ad
animalia terrestria magis notatur gradus caloris quam privatio. In
vegetabilibus autem et plantis nullus percipitur gradus caloris ad
tactum, neque in lachrymis ipsorum, neque in medullis recenter apertis.
At in animalibus magna reperitur diversitas caloris, tum in partibus
ipsorum (alius est enim calor circa cor, alius in cerebro, alius circa
externa), tum in accidentibus eorum, ut in exercitatione vehementi et
febribus.</p>
<p>Ad 21am 27a.</p>
<p>Huic instantiae vix subjungitur negativa. Quinetiam excrementa
animalium non recentia manifeste habent calorem potentialem, ut cernitur
in impinguatione soli.</p>
<p>Ad 22am et 23am 28a.</p>
<p>Liquores (sive aquae vocentur sive olea) qui habent magnam et
intensam acrimoniam exequuntur opera caloris in divulsione corporum,
atque adustione post aliquam moram; sed tamen ad ipsum tactum manus non
sunt calidi ab initio. Operantur autem secundum analogiam et poros
corporis cui adjunguntur. Aqua enim regis aurum solvit, argentum minime;
at contra aqua fortis argentum solvit, aurum minime; neutrum autem
solvit vitrum. Et sic de caeteris.</p>
<p>Ad 24am 29a.</p>
<p>Fiat experimentum spiritus vini in lignis, ac etiam in butyro aut
cera aut pice; si forte per calorem suum ea aliquatenus liquefaciat.
Etenim instantia 24a ostendit potestatem ejus imitativam caloris in
incrustationibus. Itaque fiat similiter experimentum in
liquefactionibus. Fiat etiam experimentum per vitrum graduum sive
calendare quod concavum sit in summitate sua per exterius; et immittatur
in illud concavum exterius spiritus vini bene rectificatus, cum
operculo, ut melius contineat calorem suum; et notetur utrum per calorem
suum faciat aquam descendere.</p>
<p>Ad 25am 30a.</p>
<p>Aromata, et herbae acres ad palatum, multo magis sumptae interius,
percipiuntur calida. Videndum itaque in quibus aliis materiis exequantur
opera caloris. Atque referunt nautae, cum cumuli et massae aromatum diu
conclusae subito aperiuntur, periculum instare illis, qui eas primo
agitant et extrahunt, a febribus et inflammationibus spiritus. Similiter
fieri poterit experimentum, utrum pulveres hujusmodi aromatum aut
herbarum non arefaciant laridum et carnem suspensam super ipsos, veluti
fumus ignis.</p>
<p>Ad 26am 31a.</p>
<p>Acrimonia sive penetratio inest tam frigidis, qualia sunt acetum et
oleum vitrioli, quam calidis, qualia sunt oleum origani et similia.
Itaque similiter et in animatis cient dolorem et in non animatis
divellunt partes et consumunt. Neque huic instantiae subjungitur
negativa. Atque in animatis nullus reperitur dolor, nisi cum quodam
sensu caloris.</p>
<p>Ad 27am 32a.</p>
<p>Communes sunt complures actiones et calidi et frigidi, licet diversa
admodum ratione. Nam et nives puerorum manus videntur paulo post urere;
et frigora tuentur carnes a putrefactione, non minus quam ignis; et
calores contrahunt corpora in minus, quod faciunt et frigida. Verum haec
et similia opportunius est referre ad Inquisitionem de Frigido.</p>
<ol start="13" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Tertio facienda est comparentia ad intellectum instantiarum in quibus
natura, de qua fit inquisitio, inest secundum magis et minus; sive facta
comparatione incrementi et decrementi in eodem subjecto, sive facta
comparatione ad invicem in subjectis diversis. Cum enim forma rei sit
ipsissima res; neque differat res a forma, aliter quam differunt
apparens et existens, aut exterius et interius, aut in ordine ad hominem
et in ordine ad universum; omnino sequitur ut non recipiatur aliqua
natura pro vera forma, nisi perpetuo decrescat quando natura ipsa
decrescit, et similiter perpetuo augeatur quando natura ipsa augetur.
Hanc itaque tabulam Tabulam Graduum sive Tabulam Comparativae appellare
consuevimus.</p>
<p>Tabula Graduum sive Comparativae in Calido.</p>
<p>Primo itaque dicemus de iis quae nullum prorsus gradum caloris habent
ad tactum, sed videntur habere potentialem tantum quendam calorem, sive
dispositionem et praeparationem ad calidum. Postea demum descendemus ad
ea quae sunt actu sive ad tactum calida, eorumque fortitudines et
gradus.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In corporibus solidis et tangibilibus non invenitur aliquid quod
in natura sua calidum sit originaliter. Non enim lapis aliquis, non
metallum, non suphur, non fossile aliquod, non lignum, non aqua, non
cadaver animalis, inveniuntur calida. Aquae autem calidae in balneis
videntur calefieri per accidens, sive per flammam aut ignem
subterraneum, qualis ex Aetna et montibus aliis compluribus evomitur,
sive ex conflictu corporum, quemadmodum calor fit in ferri et stanni
dissolutionibus. Itaque gradus caloris in inanimatis, quatenus ad tactum
humanum, nullus est; veruntamen illa gradu frigoris differunt; non enim
aeque frigidum est lignum ac metallum. Sed hoc pertinet ad Tabulam
Graduum in Frigido.</p></li>
<li><p>Attamen quoad potentiales calores et praeparationes ad flammam,
complura inveniuntur inanimata admodum disposita, ut sulphur, naphtha,
petrelaeum.</p></li>
<li><p>Quae antea incaluerunt, ut fimus equinus ex animali, aut calx,
aut fortasse cinis aut fuligo ex igne, reliquias latentes quasdam
caloris prioris retinent. Itaque fiunt quaedam distillationes et
separationes corporum per sepulturam in fimo equino; atque excitatur
calor in calce per aspersionem aquae; ut jam dictum est.</p></li>
<li><p>Inter vegetabilia non invenitur aliqua planta sive pars plantae
(veluti lachryma aut medulla) quae sit ad tactum humanum calida. Sed
tamen (ut superius dictum est) herbae virides conclusae calescunt; atque
ad interiorem tactum, veluti ad palatum aut ad stomachum aut etiam ad
exteriores partes, post aliquam moram (ut in emplastris et unguentis)
alia vegetabilia inveniuntur calida, alia frigida.</p></li>
<li><p>Non invenitur in partibus animalium, postquam fuerint mortuae aut
separatae, aliquid calidum ad tactum humanum. Nam neque fimus equinus
ipse, nisi fuerit conclusus et sepultus, calorem retinet. Sed tamen
omnis fimus habere videtur calorem potentialem, ut in agrorum
impinguatione. Et similiter, cadavera animalium hujusmodi habent
latentem et potentialem calorem; adeo ut in coemeteriis, ubi quotidie
fiunt sepulturae, terra calorem quendam occultum colligat, qui cadaver
aliquod recenter impositum consumit longe citius quam terra pura. Atque
apud orientales traditur inveniri textile quoddam tenue et molle, factum
ex avium plumagine, quod vi innata butyrum solvat et liquefaciat in ipso
leviter involutum.</p></li>
<li><p>Quae impinguant agros, ut fimi omnis generis, creta, arena maris,
sal, et similia, dispositionem nonnullam habent ad calidum.</p></li>
<li><p>Omnis putrefactio in se rudimenta quaedam exilis caloris habet,
licet non hucusque ut ad tactum percipiatur. Nam nec ea ipsa quae
putrefacta solvuntur in animalcula, ut caro, caseus, ad tactum
percipiuntur calida; neque lignum putre, quod noctu splendet,
deprehenditur ad tactum calidum. Calor autem in putridis quandoque se
prodit per odores tetros et fortes.</p></li>
<li><p>Primus itaque caloris gradus, ex iis quae ad tactum humanum
percipiuntur calida, videtur esse calor animalium, qui bene magnam habet
graduum latitudinem. Nam infimus gradus (ut in insectis) vix ad tactum
deprenditur; summus autem gradus vix attingit ad gradum caloris radiorum
solis in regionibus et temporibus maxime ferventibus, neque ita acris
est quin tolerari possit a manu. Et tamen referunt de Constantio,
aliisque nonnullis qui constitutionis et habitus corporis admodum sicci
fuerunt, quod acutissimis febribus correpti ita incaluerint ut manum
admotam aliquantulum urere visi sint.</p></li>
<li><p>Animalia, ex motu et exercitatione, ex vino et epulis, ex venere,
ex febribus ardentibus, et ex dolore, augentur calore.</p></li>
<li><p>Animalia, in accessibus febrium intermittentium, a principio
frigore et horrore corripiuntur, sed paulo post majorem in modum
incalescunt; quod etiam faciunt a principio in causonibus et febribus
pestilentialibus.</p></li>
<li><p>Inquiratur ulterius de calore comparato in diversis animalibus,
veluti piscibus, quadrupedibus, serpentibus, avibus; atque etiam
secundum species ipsorum, ut in leone, milvio, homine; nam ex vulgari
opinione, pisces per interiora minus calidi sunt, aves autem maxime
calidae; praesertim columbae, accipitres, struthiones.</p></li>
<li><p>Inquiratur ulterius de calore comparato in eodem animali,
secundum partes et membra ejus diversa. Nam lac, sanguis, sperma, ova,
inveniuntur gradu modico tepida, et minus calida quam ipsa caro exterior
in animali quando movetur aut agitatur. Qualis vero gradus sit caloris
in cerebro, stomacho, corde, et reliquis, similiter adhuc non est
quaesitum.</p></li>
<li><p>Animalia omnia, per hyemem et tempestates frigidas, secundum
exterius frigent; sed per interiora etiam magis esse calida
existimantur.</p></li>
<li><p>Calor coelestium, etiam in regione calidissima atque temporibus
anni et diei calidissimis, non eum gradum caloris obtinet, qui vel
lignum aridissimum vel stramen vel etiam linteum ustum incendat aut
adurat, nisi per specula comburentia roboretur; sed tamen e rebus
humidis vaporem excitare potest.</p></li>
<li><p>Ex traditione astronomorum ponuntur stellae aliae magis, aliae
minus calidae. Inter planetas enim post solem ponitur Mars calidissimus,
deinde Jupiter, deinde Venus; ponuntur autem tanquam frigidi Luna et
deinde omnium maxime Saturnus. Inter fixas autem ponitur calidissimus
Sirius, deinde Cor Leonis, sive Regulus, deinde Canicula, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Sol magis calefacit, quo magis vergit ad perpendiculum sive
Zenith, quod etiam credendum est de aliis planetis, pro modulo suo
caloris; exempli gratia, Jovem magis apud nos calefacere, cum positus
sit sub Cancro aut Leone quam sub Capricorno aut Aquario.</p></li>
<li><p>Credendum est solem ipsum et planetas reliquos magis calefacere
in perigaeis suis, propter propinquitatem ad terram, quam in apogaeis.
Quod si eveniat ut in aliqua regione sol sit simul in perigaeo et
propius ad perpendiculum, necesse est ut magis calefaciat quam in
regione ubi sol sit similiter in perigaeo sed magis ad obliquum. Adeo ut
comparatio exaltationis planetarum notari debeat, prout ex perpendiculo
aut obliquitate participet, secundum regionum varietatem.</p></li>
<li><p>Sol etiam, et similiter reliqui planetae calefacere magis
existimantur cum sint in proximo ad stellas fixas majores; veluti cum
sol ponitur in Leone, magis vicinus fit Cordi Leonis, Caudae Leonis, et
Spicae Virginis, et Sirio, et Caniculae, quam cum ponitur in Cancro, ubi
tamen magis sistitur ad perpendiculum. Atque credendum est partes coeli
majorem infundere calorem (licet ad tactum minime perceptibilem) quo
magis ornatae sint stellis, praesertim majoribus.</p></li>
<li><p>Omnino calor coelestium augetur tribus modis; videlicet ex
perpendiculo, ex propinquitate sive perigaeo, et ex conjunctione sive
consortio stellarum.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnum omnino invenitur intervallum inter calorem animalium ac
etiam radiorum coelestium (prout ad nos deferuntur), atque flammam,
licet lenissimam, atque etiam ignita omnia, atque insuper liquores, aut
aerem ipsum majorem in modum ab igne calefactum. Etenim flamma spiritus
vini, praesertim rara nec constipata, tamen potis est stramen aut
linteum aut papyrum incendere; quod nunquam faciet calor animalis vel
solis, absque speculis comburentibus.</p></li>
<li><p>Flammae autem et ignitorum plurimi sunt gradus in fortitudine et
debilitate caloris. Verum de his nulla est facta diligens inquisitio; ut
necesse sit ista leviter transmittere. Videtur autem ex flammis illa ex
spiritu vini esse mollissima; nisi forte ignis fatuus, aut flammae seu
coruscationes ex sudoribus animalium, sint molliores. Hanc sequi
opinamur flammam ex vegetabilibus levibus et porosis, ut stramine,
scirpis, et foliis arefactis, a quibus non multum differre flammam ex
pilis aut plumis. Hanc sequitur fortasse flamma ex lignis, praesertim
iis quae non multum habent ex resina aut pice; ita tamen ut flamma ex
lignis quae parva sunt mole (quae vulgo colligantur in fasciculos)
lenior sit quam quae fit ex truncis arborum et radicibus. Id quod vulgo
experiri licet in fornacibus quae ferrum excoquunt, in quibus ignis ex
fasciculis et ramis arborum non est admodum utilis. Hanc sequitur (ut
arbitramur) flamma ex oleo et sevo et cera, et hujusmodi oleosis et
pinguibus, quae sunt sine magna acrimonia. Fortissimus autem calor
reperitur in pice et resina; atque adhuc magis in sulphure et caphura,
et naphtha et petrelaeo et salibus (postquam materia cruda eruperit), et
in horum compositionibus, veluti pulvere tormentario, igne Graeco (quem
vulgo ignem ferum vocant), et diversis ejus generibus, quae tam
obstinatum habent calorem ut ab aquis non facile exstinguantur.</p></li>
<li><p>Existimamus etiam flammam, quae resultat ex nonnullis metallis
imperfectis, esse valde robustam et acrem. Verum de istis omnibus
inquiratur ulterius.</p></li>
<li><p>Videtur autem flamma fulminum potentiorum has omnes flammas
superare; adeo ut ferrum ipsum perfectum aliquando colliquaverit in
guttas, quod flammae illae alterae facere non possunt.</p></li>
<li><p>In ignitis autem diversi sunt etiam gradus caloris, de quibus
etiam non facta est diligens inquisitio. Calorem maxime debilem
existimamus esse ex linteo usto, quali ad flammae excitationem uti
solemus; et similiter ex ligno illo spongioso aut funiculis arefactis
qui ad tormentorum accensionem adhibentur. Post hunc sequitur carbo
ignitus ex lignis et anthracibus, atque etiam ex lateribus ignitis, et
similibus. Ignitorum autem vehementissime calida existimamus esse
metalla ignita, ut ferrum et cuprum et caetera. Verum de his etiam
facienda est ulterior inquisitio.</p></li>
<li><p>Inveniuntur ex ignitis nonnulla longe calidiora quam nonnullae ex
flammis. Multo enim calidius est et magis adurens ferrum ignitum quam
flamma spiritus vini.</p></li>
<li><p>Inveniuntur etiam ex illis quae ignita non sunt sed tantum ab
igne calefacta, sicut aquae ferventes et aer conclusus in
reverberatoriis, nonnulla quae superant calore multa ex flammis ipsis et
ignitis.</p></li>
<li><p>Motus auget calorem; ut videre est in follibus et flatu; adeo ut
duriora ex metallis non solvantur aut liquefiant per ignem mortuum aut
quietum, nisi flatu excitetur.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiat experimentum per specula comburentia, in quibus (ut memini)
hoc fit; ut si speculum ponatur (exempli gratia) ad distantiam spithamae
ab objecto combustibili, non tantopere incendat aut adurat quam si
positum fuerit speculum (exempli gratia) ad distantiam semi spithamae,
et gradatim et lente trahatur ad distantiam spithamae. Conus tamen et
unio radiorum eadem sunt, sed ipse motus auget operationem
caloris.</p></li>
<li><p>Existimantur incendia illa, quae fiunt flante vento forti,
majores progressus facere adversus ventum quam secundum ventum; quia
scilicet flamma resilit motu perniciore, vento remittente, quam
procedit, vento impellente.</p></li>
<li><p>Flamma non emicat aut generatur, nisi detur aliquid concavi in
quo flamma movere possit et ludere; praeterquam in flammis flatuosis
pulveris tormentarii, et similibus, ubi compressio et incarceratio
flammae auget ejus furorem.</p></li>
<li><p>Incus per malleum calefit admodum; adeo ut si incus fuerit
laminae tenuioris, existimemus illam per fortes et continuos ictus
mallei posse rubescere, ut ferum ignitum; sed de hoc fiat
experimentum.</p></li>
<li><p>At in ignitis quae sunt porosa, ita ut detur spatium ad
exercendum motum ignis, si cohibeatur hujusmodi motus per compressionem
fortem, statim extinguitur ignis; veluti cum linteum ustum aut filum
ardens candelae aut lampadis aut etiam carbo aut pruna ardens
comprimitur per pressorium aut pedis conculcationem aut hujusmodi,
statim cessant operationes ignis.</p></li>
<li><p>Approximatio ad corpus calidum auget calorem, pro gradu
approximationis; quod etiam fit in lumine: nam quo proprius collocatur
objectum ad lumen eo magis est visibile.</p></li>
<li><p>Unio calorum diversorum auget calorem, nisi facta sit commistio
corporum. Nam focus magnus et focus parvus in eodem loco nonnihil
invicem augent calorem; at aqua tepida immissa in aquam ferventem
refrigerat.</p></li>
<li><p>Mora corporis calidi auget calorem. Etenim calor perpetuo
transiens et emanans commiscetur cum calore praeinexistente, adeo ut
multiplicet calorem. Nam focus non aeque calefacit cubiculum per moram
semihorae ac si idem focus duret per horam integram. At hoc non facit
lumen; etenim lampas aut candela in aliquo loco posita non magis
illuminat per moram diuturnam quam statim ab initio.</p></li>
<li><p>Irritatio per frigidum ambiens auget calorem; ut in focis videre
est per gelu acre. Quod existimamus fieri non tantum per conclusionem et
contractionem caloris, quae est species unionis, sed per exasperationem;
veluti cum aer aut baculum violenter comprimitur aut flectitur, non ad
punctum loci prioris resilit, sed ulterius in contrarium. Itaque fiat
diligens experimentum per baculum vel simile aliquid immissum in
flammam, utrum ad latera flammae non uratur citius quam in medio
flammae.</p></li>
<li><p>Gradus autem in susceptione caloris sunt complures. Atque primo
omnium notandum est, quam parvus et exilis calor etiam ea corpora, quae
caloris minime omnium sunt susceptiva, immutet tamen et nonnihil
calefaciat. Nam ipse calor manus globulum plumbi aut alicujus metalli
paulisper detentum nonnihil calefacit. Adeo facile et in omnibus
transmittitur et excitatur calor, corpore nullo modo ad apparentiam
immutato.</p></li>
<li><p>Facillime omnium corporum apud nos et excipit et remittit calorem
aer; quod optime cernitur in vitris calendaribus. Eorum confectio est
talis: accipiatur vitrum ventre concavo, collo tenui et oblongo;
resupinetur et demittatur hujusmodi vitrum, ore deorsum verso, ventre
sursum, in aliud vasculum vitreum ubi sit aqua, tangendo fundum vasculi
illius recipientis extremo ore vitri immissi, et incumbat paullulum
vitri immissi collum ad os vitri recipientis, ita ut stare possit; quod
ut commodius fiat, apponatur parum cerae ad os vitri recipientis; ita
tamen ut non penitus obturetur os ejus, ne ob defectum aeris succedentis
impediatur motus de quo jam dicetur, qui est admodum facilis et
delicatus.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Oportet autem ut vitrum demissum, antequam inseratur in alterum,
calefiat ad ignem a parte superiori, ventre scilicet. Postquam autem
fuerit vitrum illud collocatum, ut diximus, recipiet et contrahet se aer
(qui dilatatus erat per calefactionem), post moram sufficientem pro
extinctione illius ascititii caloris, ad talem extensionem sive
dimensionem qualis erit aeris ambientis aut communis tunc temporis
quando immittitur vitrum, atque attrahet aquam in sursum ad hujusmodi
mensuram. Debet autem appendi charta angusta et oblonga, et gradibus
(quot libuerit) interstincta. Videbis autem, prout tempestas diei
incalescit aut frigescit, aerem se contrahere in angustius per frigidum
et extendere se in latius per calidum; id quod conspicietur per aquam
ascendentem quando contrahitur aer, et descendentem sive depressum
quando dilatatur aer. Sensus autem aeris, quatenus ad calidum et
frigidum, tam subtilis est et exquisitus ut facultatem tactus humani
multum superet; adeo ut solis radius aliquis, aut calor anhelitus, multo
magis calor manus, super vitri summitatem positus, statim deprimat aquam
manifesto. Attamen existimamus spiritum animalium magis adhuc exquisitum
sensum habere calidi et frigidi, nisi quod a mole corporea impediatur et
hebetetur.</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><p>Post aerem, existimamus corpora esse maxime sensitiva caloris ea
quae a frigore recenter immutata sint et compressa, qualia sunt nix et
glacies; ea enim leni aliquo tepore solvi incipiunt et colliquari. Post
illa sequitur fortasse argentum vivum. Post illud sequuntur corpora
pinguia, ut oleum butyrum, et similia; deinde lignum; deinde aqua;
postremo lapides et metalla, quae non facile calefiunt, praesertim
interius. Illa tamen calorem semel susceptum diutissime retinent; ita ut
later aut lapis aut ferrum ignitum in pelvim aquae frigidae immissum et
demersum, per quartam partem horae (plus minus) retineat calorem, ita ut
tangi non possit.</p></li>
<li><p>Quo minor est corporis moles, eo citius per corpus calidum
approximatum incalescit; id quod demonstrat omnem calorem apud nos esse
corpori tangibili quodammodo adversum.</p></li>
<li><p>Calidum, quatenus ad sensum et tactum humanum, res varia est et
respectiva: adeo ut aqua tepida, si manus frigore occupetur, sentiatur
esse calida; sin manus incaluerit, frigida.</p></li>

<p>Quam inopes simus historiae quivis facile advertet, cum in tabulis
superioribus, praeterquam quod loco historiae probatae et instantiarum
certarum nonnunquam traditiones et relationes inseramus (semper tamen
adjecta dubiae fidei et auctoritatis nota), saepenumero etiam hisce
verbis, fiat experimentum, vel inquiratur ulterius, uti cogamur.</p>
<ol start="15" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque opus et officium harum trium tabularum Comparentiam
instantiarum ad intellectum vocare consuevimus. Facta autem comparentia,
in opere ponenda est ipsa inductio. Invenienda est enim, super
comparentiam omnium et singularum instantiarum, natura talis, quae cum
natura data perpetuo adsit, absit, atque crescat, et decrescat; sitque
(ut superius dictum est) limitatio naturae magis communis. Hoc si mens
jam ab initio facere tentet affirmative (quod sibi permissa semper
facere solet), occurrent phantasmata et opinabilia et notionalia male
terminata et axiomata quotidie emendanda; nisi libeat (scholarum more)
pugnare pro falsis. Ea tamen proculdubio erunt meliora aut praviora pro
facultate et robore intellectus qui operatur. At omnino Deo (formarum
inditori et opifici) aut fortasse angelis et intelligentiis competit
formas per affirmationem immediate nosse, atque ab initio
contemplationis. Sed certe supra hominem est; cui tantum conceditur,
procedere primo per negativas, et postremo loco desinere in
affirmativas, post omnimodam exclusionem.</p>
<ol start="16" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Itaque naturae facienda est prorsus solutio et separatio; non per
ignem certe, sed per mentem, tanquam ignem divinum. Est itaque
inductionis verae opus primum (quatenus ad inveniendas formas) rejectio
sive exclusiva naturarum singularum, quae non inveniuntur in aliqua
instantia, ubi natura data adest; aut inveniuntur in aliqua instantia,
ubi natura data abest; aut inveniuntur in aliqua instantia crescere, cum
natura data decrescat; aut decrescere, cum natura data crescat. Tum vero
post rejectionem et exclusivam debitis modis factam, secundo loco
(tanquam in fundo) manebit (abeuntibus in fumum opinionibus volatilibus)
forma affirmativa, solida, et vera, et bene terminata. Atque hoc breve
dictu est, sed per multas ambages ad hoc pervenitur. Nos autem nihil
fortasse ex iis, quae ad hoc faciunt, praetermittemus.</p>
<ol start="17" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Cavendum autem est, et monendum quasi perpetuo, ne, cum tantae partes
formis videantur a nobis tribui, trahantur ea, quae dicimus, ad formas
eas, quibus hominum contemplationes et cogitationes hactenus
assueverunt.</p>
<p>Primo enim, de formis copulatis, quae sunt (ut diximus) naturarum
simplicium conjugia ex cursu communi universi, ut leonis, aquilae,
rosae, auri, et hujusmodi, impraesentiarum non loquimur. Tempus enim
erit de iis tractandi, cum ventum fuerit ad latentes processus, et
latentes schematismos, eorumque inventionem, prout reperiuntur in
substantiis (quas vocant) seu naturis concretis.</p>
<p>Rursus vero, non intelligantur ea quae dicimus (etiam quatenus ad
naturas simplices) de formis et ideis abstractis, aut in materia non
determinatis, aut male determinatis. Nos enim, quum de formis loquimur,
nil aliud intelligimus quam leges illas et determinationes actus puri,
quae naturam aliquam simplicem ordinant et constituunt, ut calorem,
lumen, pondus, in omnimoda materia et subjecto susceptibili. Itaque
eadem res est forma calidi aut forma luminis, et lex calidi sive lex
luminis; neque vero a rebus ipsis et parte operativa unquam nos
abstrahimus aut recedimus. Quare cum dicimus (exempli gratia) in
inquisitione formae caloris, Rejice tenuitatem, aut Tenuitas non est ex
forma caloris; idem est ac si dicamus, Potest homo superinducere calorem
in corpus densum, aut contra, Potest homo auferre aut arcere calorem a
corpore tenui.</p>
<p>Quod si cuiquam videantur etiam formae nostrae habere nonnihil
abstracti, quod misceant et conjungant heterogenea (videntur enim valde
esse heterogenea calor coelestium, et ignis; rubor fixus in rosa aut
similibus, et apparens in iride aut radiis opalii aut adamantis; mors ex
summersione, ex crematione, ex punctura gladii, ex apoplexia, ex
atrophia; et tamen conveniunt ista in natura calidi, ruboris, mortis),
is se habere intellectum norit consuetudine et integralitate rerum et
opinionibus captum et detentum. Certissimum enim est ista, utcunque
heterogenea et aliena, coire in formam sive legem eam, quae ordinat
calorem, aut ruborem, aut mortem; nec emancipari posse potentiam humanam
et liberari a naturae cursu communi, et expandi et exaltari ad
efficientia nova et modos operandi novos, nisi per revelationem et
inventionem hujusmodi formarum; et tamen post istam unionem naturae,
quae est res maxime principalis, de naturae divisionibus et venis, tam
ordinariis quam interioribus et verioribus, suo loco postea dicetur.</p>
<ol start="18" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Jam vero proponendum est exemplum exclusionis sive rejectionis
naturarum, quae per tabulas comparentiae reperiuntur non esse ex forma
calidi; illud interim monendo, non solum sufficere singulas tabulas ad
rejectionem alicujus naturae, sed etiam unamquamque ex instantiis
singularibus in illis contentis. Manifestum enim est ex iis, quae dicta
sunt, omnem instantiam contradictoriam destruere opinabile de forma. Sed
nihilominus quandoque perspicuitatis causa, et ut usus tabularum clarius
demonstretur, exclusivam duplicamus aut repetimus.</p>
<p>Exemplum exclusivae, sive rejectionis naturarum a forma calidi.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Per radios solis, rejice naturam elementarem.</p></li>
<li><p>Per ignem communem, et maxime per ignes subterraneos (qui
remotissimi sunt, et plurimum intercluduntur a radiis coelestibus),
rejice naturam coelestem.</p></li>
<li><p>Per calefactionem omnigenum corporum (hoc est, mineralium,
vegetabilium, partium exteriorum animalium, aquae, olei, aeris, et
reliquorum) ex approximatione sola ad ignem aut aliud corpus calidum,
rejice omnem varietatem sive subtiliorem texturam corporum.</p></li>
<li><p>Per ferrum et metalla ignita, quae calefaciunt alia corpora, nec

<li><p>Per aquam ferventem atque aerem, atque etiam per metalla et alia

et lumen.</p></li>
<li><p>Per radios lunae et aliarum stellarum (excepto sole), rejice
etiam lucem et lumen.</p></li>
<li><p>Per comparativam ferri igniti et flammae spiritus vini (ex quibus
ferrum ignitum plus habet calidi et minus lucidi, flamma autem spiritus
vini plus lucidi et minus calidi), rejice etiam lucem et lumen.</p></li>
<li><p>Per aurum et alia metalla ignita, quae densissimi sunt corporis

<li><p>Per aerem, qui invenitur ut plurimum frigidus, et tamen manet

<li><p>Per dilatationem aeris in vitris calendariis et similibus, qui

<li><p>Per facilem tepefactionem omnium corporum, absque aliqua

<li><p>Per accensionem caloris ex attritione corporum, rejice naturam

in natura, nec causatur a natura praecedente.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sunt et aliae naturae: neque enim tabulas conficimus perfectas, sed
exempla tantum.</p>
<p>Omnes et singulae naturae praedictae non sunt ex forma calidi. Atque
ab omnibus naturis praedictis liberatur homo in operatione super
calidum.</p>
<ol start="19" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Atque in exclusiva jacta sunt fundamenta inductionis verae, quae
tamen non perficitur donec sistatur in affirmativa. Neque vero ipsa
exclusiva ullo modo perfecta est, neque adeo esse potest sub initiis.
Est enim exclusiva (ut plane liquet) rejectio naturarum simplicium. Quod
si non habeamus adhuc bonas et veras notiones naturarum simplicium,
quomodo rectificari potest exclusiva? At nonnullae ex supradictis
(veluti notio naturae elementaris, notio naturae coelestis, notio
tenuitatis) sunt notiones vagae, nec bene terminatae. Itaque nos, qui
nec ignari sumus nec obliti quantum opus aggrediamur (viz. ut faciamus
intellectum humanum rebus et naturae parem), nullo modo acquiescimus in
his, quae adhuc praecepimus: sed et rem in ulterius provehimus, et
fortiora auxilia in usum intellectus machinamur et ministramus; quae
nunc subjungemus. Et certe in interpretatione naturae animus omnino
taliter est praeparandus et formandus, ut et sustineat se in gradibus
debitis certitudinis, et tamen cogitet (praesertim sub initiis) ea quae
adsunt multum pendere ex iis quae supersunt.</p>
<ol start="20" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Attamen quia citius emergit veritas ex errore quam ex confusione,
utile putamus, ut fiat permissio intellectui, post tres tabulas
comparentiae primae (quales posuimus) factas et pensitatas, accingendi
se et tentandi opus interpretationis naturae in affirmativa; tam ex
instantiis tabularum, quam ex iis quae alias occurrent. Quod genus
tentamenti, permissionem intellectus, sive interpretationem inchoatam,
sive vindemiationem primam appellare consuevimus.</p>
<p>Vindemiatio prima de forma calidi.</p>
<p>Animadvertendum autem est, formam rei inesse (ut ex iis quae dicta
sunt plane liquet) instantiis universis et singulis, in quibus res ipsa
inest; aliter enim forma non esset: itaque nulla plane dari potest
instantia contradictoria. Attamen longe magis conspicua invenitur forma
et evidens in aliquibus instantiis, quam in aliis; in iis videlicet, ubi
minus cohibita est natura formae et impedita et redacta in ordinem per
naturas alias. Hujusmodi autem instantias, elucescentias vel instantias
ostensivas appellare consuevimus. Pergendum itaque est ad vindemiationem
ipsam primam de forma calidi.</p>
<p>Per universas et singulas instantias, natura cujus limitatio est
calor videtur esse motus. Hoc autem maxime ostenditur in flamma, quae
perpetuo movetur; et in liquoribus ferventibus aut bullientibus, qui
etiam perpetuo moventur. Atque ostenditur etiam in incitatione sive
incremento caloris facto per motum; ut in follibus, et ventis; de quo
vide Instant. 29. Tab. 3. Atque similiter in aliis modis motus, de
quibus vide Instant. 28. et 31. Tab. 3. Rursus ostenditur in extinctione
ignis et caloris per omnem fortem compressionem, quae fraenat et cessare
facit motum; de qua vide Instant. 30. et 32. Tab. 3. Ostenditur etiam in
hoc, quod omne corpus destruitur aut saltem insigniter alteratur ab omni
igne et calore forti ac vehementi; unde liquido constat, fieri a calore
tumultum et perturbationem et motum acrem in partibus internis corporis,
qui sensim vergit ad dissolutionem.</p>
<p>Intelligatur hoc quod diximus de motu (nempe, ut sit instar generis
ad calorem), non quod calor generet motum, aut quod motus generet
calorem (licet et haec in aliquibus vera sint), sed quod ipsissimus
calor, sive quid ipsum caloris, sit motus et nihil aliud; limitatus
tamen per differentias quas mox subjungemus, postquam nonnullas
cautiones adjecerimus ad evitandum aequivocum.</p>
<p>Calidum ad sensum res respectiva est, et in ordine ad hominem non ad
universum; et ponitur recte ut effectus caloris tantum in spiritum
animalem. Quin etiam in seipso res varia est, cum idem corpus (prout
sensus praedisponitur) inducat perceptionem tam calidi quam frigidi; ut
patet per Instant. 41. Tab. 3.</p>
<p>Neque vero communicatio caloris, sive natura ejus transitiva per quam
corpus admotum corpori calido incalescit, confundi debet cum forma
calidi. Aliud enim est calidum, aliud calefactivum. Nam per motum
attritionis inducitur calor absque aliquo calido praecedente, unde
excluditur calefactivum a forma calidi. Atque etiam ubi calidum
efficitur per approximationem calidi, hoc ipsum non fit ex forma calidi,
sed omnino pendet a natura altiore et magis communi; viz. ex natura
assimilationis sive multiplicationis sui; de qua facienda est separatim
inquisitio.</p>
<p>At notio ignis plebeia est, et nihil valet: composita enim est ex
concursu qui fit calidi et lucidi in aliquo corpore; ut in flamma
communi, et corporibus accensis usque ad ruborem.</p>
<p>Remoto itaque omni aequivoco, veniendum jam tandem est ad
differentias veras, quae limitant motum et constituunt eum in formam
calidi.</p>
<p>Prima igitur differentia ea est, quod calor sit motus expansivus, per
quem corpus nititur ad dilatationem sui, et recipiendi se in majorem
sphaeram sive dimensionem quam prius occupaverat. Haec autem differentia
maxime ostenditur in flamma; ubi fumus sive halitus pinguis manifesto
dilatatur et aperit se in flammam.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in omni liquore fervente, qui manifesto intumescit,
insurgit, et emittit bullas; atque urget processum expandendi se, donec
vertatur in corpus longe magis extensum et dilatatum quam sit ipse
liquor; viz. in vaporem aut fumum aut aerem.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in omni ligno et combustibili; ubi fit aliquando
exudatio, at semper evaporatio.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in colliquatione metallorum, quae (cum sint corporis
compactissimi) non facile intumescunt et se dilatant; sed tamen spiritus
eorum, postquam fuerit in se dilatatus, et majorem adeo dilatationem
concupierit, trudit plane et agit partes crassiores in liquidum. Quod si
etiam calor fortius intendatur, solvit et vertit multum ex iis in
volatile.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in ferro aut lapidibus; quae licet non liquefiant
aut fundantur, tamen emolliuntur. Quod etiam fit in baculis ligni; quae
calefacta paululum in cineribus calidis fiunt flexibilia.</p>
<p>Optime autem cernitur iste motus in aere, qui per exiguum calorem se
dilatat continuo et manifesto; ut per Instant. 38. Tab. 3.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in natura contraria frigidi. Frigus enim omne corpus
contrahit et cogit in angustius; adeo ut per intensa frigora clavi
excidant ex parietibus, aera dissiliant, vitrum etiam calefactum et
subito positum in frigido dissiliat et frangatur. Similiter aer per
levem infrigidationem recipit se in angustius; ut per Instant. 38. Tab.
3. Verum de his fusius dicetur in inquisitione de Frigido.</p>
<p>Neque mirum est si calidum et frigidum edant complures actiones
communes (de quo vide Instant. 32. Tab. 2), cum inveniantur duae ex
sequentibus differentiis (de quibus mox dicemus) quae competunt utrique
naturae; licet in hac differentia (de qua nunc loquimur) actiones sint
ex diametro oppositae. Calidum enim dat motum expansivum et dilatantem,
Frigidum autem dat motum contractivum et coeuntem.</p>
<p>Secunda differentia est modificatio prioris; haec videlicet, quod
calor sit motus expansivus sive versus circumferentiam; hac lege tamen,
ut una feratur corpus sursum. Dubium enim non est quin sint motus
complures mixti. Exempli gratia; sagitta aut spiculum simul et
progrediendo rotat, et rotando progreditur. Similiter et motus caloris
simul est et expansivus et latio in sursum.</p>
<p>Haec vero differentia ostenditur in forcipe, aut bacillo ferreo
immisso in ignem: quia si immittatur perpendiculariter tenendo manum
superius, cito manum adurit; sin ex latere aut inferius, omnino
tardius.</p>
<p>Conspicua etiam est in distillationibus per descensorium; quibus
utuntur homines ad flores delicatiores, quorum odores facile evanescunt.
Nam hoc reperit industria, ut collocent ignem non subter sed supra, ut
adurat minus. Neque enim flamma tantum vergit sursum, sed etiam omne
calidum.</p>
<p>Fiat autem experimentum hujus rei in contraria natura frigidi:
viz. utrum frigus non contrahat corpus descendendo deorsum, quemadmodum
calidum dilatat corpus ascendendo sursum. Itaque adhibeantur duo bacilla
ferrea, vel duo tubi vitrei, quoad caetera pares, et calefiant nonnihil;
et ponatur spongia cum aqua frigida, vel nix, subter unam, et similiter
super alteram. Existimamus enim celeriorem fore refrigerationem ad
extremitates in eo bacillo ubi nix ponitur supra quam in eo ubi nix
ponitur subter: contra ac fit in calido.</p>
<p>Tertia differentia ea est; ut calor sit motus, non expansivus
uniformiter secundum totum, sed expansivus per particulas minores
corporis; et simul cohibitus et repulsus et reverberatus, adeo ut induat
motum alternativum et perpetuo trepidantem et tentantem et nitentem et
ex repercussione irritatum; unde furor ille ignis et caloris ortum
habet.</p>
<p>Ista vero differentia ostenditur maxime in flamma et liquoribus
bullientibus; quae perpetuo trepidant, et in parvis portionibus tument,
et rursus subsidunt.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in iis corporibus, quae sunt tam durae compagis ut
calefacta ut ignita non intumescant aut dilatentur mole; ut ferrum
ignitum, in quo calor est acerrimus.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in hoc, quod per frigidissimas tempestates focus
ardeat acerrime.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in hoc, quod cum extenditur aer in vitro calendari
absque impedimento aut repulsione, uniformiter scilicet et aequaliter,
non percipiatur calor. Etiam in ventis conclusis, licet erumpant vi
maxima, tamen non percipitur calor insignis; quia scilicet motus fit
secundum totum, absque motu alternante in particulis. Atque ad hoc fiat
experimentum, utrum flamma non urat acrius versus latera quam in medio
flammae.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in hoc, quod omnis ustio transigatur per minutos
poros corporis quod uritur; adeo ut ustio subruat et penetret et fodicet
et stimulet, perinde ac si essent infinitae cuspides acus. Itaque ex hoc
illud etiam fit, quod omnes aquae fortes (si proportionatae sint ad
corpus in quod agunt) edant opera ignis, ex natura sua corrodente et
pungente.</p>
<p>Atque ista differentia (de qua nunc dicimus) communis est cum natura
frigidi; in quo cohibetur motus contractivus per renitentiam expandendi;
quemadmodum in calido cohibetur motus expansivus per renitentiam
contrahendi.</p>
<p>Itaque sive partes corporis penetrent versus interius sive penetrent
versus exterius, similis est ratio; licet impar admodum sit fortitudo;
quia non habemus hic apud nos in superficie terrae aliquid quod sit
impense frigidum. Vide Instant. 27. Tab. 9.</p>
<p>Quarta differentia est modificatio prioris: haec scilicet, quod motus
ille stimulationis aut penetrationis debeat esse nonnihil rapidus et
minime lentus; atque fiat etiam per particulas, licet minutas; tamen non
ad extremam subtilitatem, sed quasi majusculas.</p>
<p>Ostenditur haec differentia in comparatione operum quae edit ignis
cum iis quae edit tempus sive aetas. Aetas enim sive tempus arefacit,
consumit, subruit, et incinerat, non minus quam ignis; vel potius longe
subtilius: sed quia motus ejusmodi est lentus admodum et per particulas
valde exiles, non percipitur calor.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam in comparatione dissolutionum ferri et auri. Aurum
enim dissolvitur absque calore excitato; ferrum autem cum vehementi
excitatione caloris, licet simili fere intervallo quoad tempus. Quia
scilicet in auro, ingressus aquae separationis est clemens et subtiliter
insinuans, et cessio partium auri facilis; at in ferro, ingressus est
asper et cum conflictu, et partes ferri habent obstinationem
majorem.</p>
<p>Ostenditur etiam aliquatenus in gangraenis nonnullis et
mortificationibus carnium; quae non excitant magnum calorem aut dolorem,
ob subtilitatem putrefactionis.</p>
<p>Atque haec sit Prima Vindemiatio, sive Interpretatio inchoata de
Forma Calidi, facta per Permissionem Intellectus.</p>
<p>Ex Vindemiatione autem ista Prima, forma sive definitio vera caloris
(ejus qui est in ordine ad universum, non relativus tantummodo ad
sensum) talis est, brevi verborum complexu: Calor est motus expansivus,
cohibitus, et nitens per partes minores. Modificatur autem expansio: ut
expandendo in ambitum, nonnihil tamen inclinet versus superiora.
Modificatur autem et nixus ille per partes; ut non sit omnino segnis,
sed incitatus et cum impetu nonnullo.</p>
<p>Quod vero ad Operativam attinet, eadem res est. Nam designatio est
talis: Si in aliquo corpore naturali poteris excitare motum ad se
dilatandum aut expandendum; eumque motum ita reprimere et in se vertere,
ut dilatatio illa non procedat aequaliter, sed partim obtineat, partim
retrudatur; proculdubio generabis calidum: non habita ratione, sive
corpus illud sit elementare (ut loquuntur), sive imbutum a coelestibus;
sive luminosum, sive opacum; sive tenue, sive densum; sive localiter
expansum, sive intra claustra dimensionis primae contentum; sive vergens
ad dissolutionem, sive manens in statu; sive animal, sive vegetabile,
sive minerale, sive aqua, sive oleum, sive aer, aut aliqua alia
substantia quaecunque susceptiva motus praedicti. Calidum autem ad
sensum res eadem est; sed cum analogia, qualis competit sensui. Nunc
vero ad ulteriora auxilia procedendum est.</p>

<p>Inter Praerogativas Instantiarum, primo proponemus Instantias
Solitarias. Eae autem sunt solitariae, quae exhibent naturam de qua fit
inquisitio in talibus subjectis, quae nil habent commune cum aliis
subjectis, praeter illam ipsam naturam; aut rursus quae non exhibent
naturam de qua fit inquisitio in talibus subjectis, quae sunt similia
per omnia cum aliis subjectis, praeterquam in illa ipsa natura.
Manifestum enim est quod hujusmodi instantiae tollant ambages, atque
accelerent et roborent exclusivam; adeo ut paucae ex illis sint instar
multarum.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia: si fiat inquisitio de natura Coloris, Instantiae
Solitariae sunt prismata, gemmae chrystallinae, quae reddunt colores non
solum in se sed exterius supra parietam, item rores, etc. Istae enim nil
habent commune cum coloribus fixis in floribus, gemmis coloratis,
metallis, lignis, etc., praeter ipsum colorem. Unde facile colligitur,
quod color nil aliud sit quam modificatio imaginis lucis immissae et
receptae: in priore genere, per gradus diversos incidentiae; in
posteriore, per texturas et schematismos varios corporis. Istae autem
Instantiae sunt Solitariae quatenus ad similitudinem.</p>
<p>Rursus in eadem inquisitione, venae distinctae albi et nigri in
marmoribus, et variegationes colorum in floribus ejusdem speciei, sunt
Instantiae Solitariae. Album enim et nigrum marmoris, et maculae albi et
purpurei in floribus garyophylli, conveniunt fere in omnibus praeter
ipsum colorem. Unde facile colligitur, colorem non multum rei habere cum
naturis alicujus corporis intrinsecis, sed tantum situm esse in positura
partium crassiori et quasi mechanica. Istae autem Instantiae sunt
Solitariae, quatenus ad discrepantiam. Utrunque autem genus Instantias
Solitarias appellare consuevimus; aut Ferinas, sumpto vocabulo ab
astronomis.</p>

<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus secundo loco Instantias
Migrantes. Eae sunt, in quibus natura inquisita migrat ad generationem,
cum prius non existeret; aut contra migrat ad corruptionem, cum prius
existeret. Itaque in utraque antistrophe, instantiae tales sunt semper
geminae; vel potius una instantia in motu sive transitu, producta ad
periodum adversam. At hujusmodi instantiae non solum accelerant et
roborant exclusivam, sed etiam compellunt affirmativam sive formam ipsam
in angustum. Necesse est enim ut forma rei sit quippiam, quod per
hujusmodi migrationem indatur, aut contra per hujusmodi migrationem
tollatur et destruatur. Atque licet omnis exclusio promoveat
affirmativam, tamen hoc magis directe fit in subjecto eodem quam in
diversis. Forma autem (ut ex omnibus quae dicta sunt manifesto liquet)
prodens se in uno ducit ad omnia. Quo autem simplicior fuerit migratio,
eo magis habenda est instantia in pretio. Praeterea Instantiae Migrantes
magni sunt usus ad partem operativam; quia cum proponant formam
copulatam cum efficiente aut privante, perspicue designant praxin in
aliquibus; unde facilis etiam est transitus ad proxima. Subest tamen in
illis nonnihil periculi, quod indiget cautione; hoc videlicet, ne formam
nimis retrahant ad efficientem, et intellectum perfundant vel saltem
perstringant falsa opinione de forma ex intuitu efficientis. Efficiens
vero semper ponitur nil aliud esse quam vehiculum sive deferens formae.
Verum huic rei, per exclusivam legitime factam, facile adhibetur
remedium.</p>
<p>Proponendum itaque est jam exemplum instantiae migrantis. Sit natura
inquisita Candor sive Albedo: instantia migrans ad generationem est
vitrum integrum et vitrum pulverizatum. Similiter, aqua simplex et aqua
agitata in spumam. Vitrum enim integrum et aqua simplex diaphana sunt,
non alba; at vitrum pulverizatum et aqua in spuma, alba, non diaphana.
Itaque quaerendum quid acciderit ex ista migratione vitro aut aquae.
Manifestum enim est formam albedinis deferri et invehi per istam
contusionem vitri et agitationem aquae. Nihil autem reperitur
accessisse, praeter comminutionem partium vitri et aquae, et aeris
insertionem. Neque vero parum profectum est ad inveniendam formam
albedinis, quod corpora duo per se diaphana, sed secundum magis et minus
(aer scilicet et aqua, aut aer et vitrum), simul posita per minutas
portiones exhibeant albedinem, per refractionem inaequalem radiorum
lucis.</p>
<p>Verum hac in re proponendum est etiam exemplum periculi et cautionis,
de quibus diximus. Nimirum facile hic occurret intellectui ab hujusmodi
efficientibus depravato, quod ad formam albedinis aer semper requiratur,
aut quod albedo generetur tantum per corpora diaphana; quae omnino falsa
sunt, et per multas exclusiones convicta. Quin potius apparebit (misso
aere et hujusmodi) corpora omnino aequalia (secundum portiones opticas)
dare diaphanum; corpora vero inaequalia per texturam simplicem, dare
album; corpora inaequalia secundum texturam compositam, sed ordinatam,
dare reliquos colores, praeter nigrum; corpora vero inaequalia per
texturam compositam, sed omnino inordinatam et confusam, dare nigrum.
Itaque de instantia migrante ad generationem in natura inquisita
albedinis, propositum est jam exemplum. Instantia autem migrans ad
corruptionem in eadem natura albedinis, est spuma dissoluta, aut nix
dissoluta. Exuit enim albedinem et induit diaphanum aqua, postquam fit
integrale sine aere.</p>
<p>Neque vero illud ullo modo praetermittendum est, quod sub Instantiis
Migrantibus comprehendi debeant non tantum illae quae migrant ad
generationem et privationem, sed etiam illae quae migrant ad
majorationem et minorationem; cum illae etiam tendant ad inveniendam
formam, ut per definitionem formae superius factam et tabulam graduum
manifesto liquet. Itaque papyrus, quae sicca cum fuerit alba est, at
madefacta (excluso aere et recepta aqua) minus alba est et magis vergit
ad diaphanum, similem habet rationem cum instantiis supradictis.</p>
<ol start="24" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, tertio loco ponemus Instantias
Ostensivas, de quibus in vindemiatione prima de Calido mentionem
fecimus; quas etiam Elucescentias, sive Instantias Liberatas et
Praedominantes, appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt, quae ostendunt naturam
inquisitam nudam et substantivam, atque etiam in exaltatione sua aut
summo gradu potentiae suae; emancipatam scilicet, et liberatam ab
impedimentis, vel saltem per fortitudinem suae virtutis dominantem super
ipsa, eaque supprimentem et coercentem. Cum enim omne corpus suscipiat
multas naturarum formas copulatas et in concreto, fit ut alia aliam
retundat, deprimat, frangat, et liget; unde obscurantur formae singulae.
Inveniuntur autem subjecta nonnulla in quibus natura inquisita prae
aliis est in suo vigore, vel per absentiam impedimenti vel per
praedominantiam virtutis. Hujusmodi autem instantiae sunt maxime
ostensivae formae. Verum et in his ipsis instantiis adhibenda est
cautio, et cohibedus impetus intellectus. Quicquid enim ostentat formam,
eamque trudit, ut videatur occurrere intellectui, pro suspecto habendum
est, et recurrendum ad exclusivam severam et diligentem.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Calidum. Instantia Ostensiva
motus expansionis, quae (ut superius dictum est) portio est praecipua
formae calidi, est vitrum calendare aeris. Etenim flamma, licet
manifesto exhibeat expansionem, tamen propter momentaneam extinctionem
non ostendit progressum expansionis. Aqua autem fervens, propter facilem
transitionem aquae in vaporem et aerem, non tam bene ostendit
expansionem aquae in corpore suo. Rursus ferrum ignitum, et similia,
tantum abest ut progressum ostendant, ut contra per retusionem et
fractionem spiritus per partes compactas et crassas (quae domant et
fraenant expansionem) ipsa expansio non sit omnino conspicua ad sensum.
At vitrum calendare clare ostendit expansionem in aere, et conspicuam et
progredientem et durantem, neque transeuntem.</p>
<p>Rursus, exempli gratia, sit natura inquisita Pondus. Instantia
Ostensiva ponderis est argentum vivum. Omnia enim superat pondere magno
intervallo, praeter aurum; quod non multo gravius est. At praestantior
instantia est ad indicandam formam ponderis argentum vivum quam aurum;
quia aurum solidum est et consistens, quod genus referri videtur ad
densum; at argentum vivum liquidum est et turgens spiritu, et tamen
multis partibus exuperat gravitate diamantem, et ea quae putantur
solidissima. Ex quo ostenditur formam gravis sive ponderosi dominari
simpliciter in copia materiae, et non in arcta compage.</p>
<ol start="25" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus quarto loco Instantias
Clandestinas, quas etiam Instantias Crepusculi appellare consuevimus.
Eae sunt veluti oppositae instantiis ostensivis. Exhibent enim naturam
inquisitam in infirma virtute, et tanquam in incunabulis et rudimentis
suis; tentantem et tanquam primo experientem, sed sub contraria natura
latentem et subactam. Sunt autem hujusmodi instantiae magni omnino
momenti ad inveniendas formas; quia sicut ostensivae ducunt facile ad
differentias, ita clandestinae ducunt optime ad genera; id est, ad
naturas illas communes, quarum naturae inquisitae nihil aliud sunt quam
limitationes.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Consistens, sive se determinans;
cujus contrarium est Liquidum, sive fluens. Instantiae clandestinae sunt
illae quae exhibent gradum nonnullum debilem et infimum consistentis in
fluido; veluti bulla aquae, quae est tanquam pellicula quaedam
consistens et determinata, facta ex corpore aquae. Similiter
stillicidia, quae, si adfuerit aqua quae succedat, producunt se in filum
admodum tenue, ne discontinuetur aqua; at si non detur talis copia aquae
quae succedere possit, cadit aqua in guttis rotundis, quae est figura
quae optime aquam sustinet contra discontinuationem. At in ipso temporis
articulo, cum desinit filum aquae et incipit descensus in guttis,
resilit ipsa aqua sursum ad evitandam discontinuationem. Quin in
metallis, quae cum funduntur sunt liquida sed magis tenacia, recipiunt
se saepe guttae liquefactae sursum, atque ita haerent. Simile quoddam
est instantia speculorum puerilium, quae solent facere pueruli in
scirpis ex saliva, ubi cernitur etiam pellicula consistens aquae. At
multo melius se ostendit hoc ipsum in altero illo ludicro puerili,
quando capiunt aquam, per saponem factam paulo tenaciorem, atque inflant
eam per calamum cavum, atque inde formant aquam tanquam in castellum
bullarum; quae per interpositionem aeris inducit consistentiam eo usque
ut se projici nonnihil patiatur absque discontinuatione. Optime autem
cernitur hoc in spuma et nive, quae talem induunt consistentiam ut fere
secari possint; cum tamen sint corpora formata ex aere et aqua, quae
utraque sunt liquida. Quae omnia non obscure innuunt Liquidum et
Consistens esse notiones tantum plebeias, et ad sensum; inesse autem
revera omnibus corporibus fugam et evitationem se discontinuandi; eam
vero in corporibus homogeneis (qualia sunt liquida) esse debilem et
infirmam, in corporibus vero, quae sunt composita ex heterogeneis, magis
esse vividam et fortem; propterea quod admotio heterogenei constringit
corpora, at subintratio homogenei solvit et relaxat.</p>
<p>Similiter, exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Attractio, sive
Coitio Corporum. Instantia circa formam ejus ostensiva maxime insignis
est magnes. Contraria autem natura attrahenti est non attrahens, licet
in substantia simili. Veluti ferrum, quod non attrahit ferrum,
quemadmodum nec plumbum plumbum, nec lignum lignum, nec aquam aqua.
Instantia autem clandestina est magnes ferro armatus, vel potius ferrum
in magnete armato. Nam ita fert natura, ut magnes armatus in distantia
aliqua non trahat ferrum fortius quam magnes non armatus. Verum si
admoveatur ferrum, ita ut tangat ferrum in magnete armato, tunc magnes
armatus longe majus pondus ferri sustinet quam magnes simplex et
inermis, propter similitudinem substantiae ferri versus ferrum; quae
operatio erat omnino clandestina et latens in ferro, antequam magnes
accessisset. Itaque manifestum est formam coitionis esse quippiam quod
in magnete sit vividum et robustum, in ferro debile et latens. Itidem
notatum est sagittas parvas ligneas absque cuspide ferrea, emissas ex
sclopetis grandibus, altius penetrare in materiam ligneam (puta latera
navium, ut similia), quam easdem sagittas ferro acuminatas, propter
similitudinem substantiae ligni ad lignum, licet hoc ante in ligno
latuerit. Itidem, licet aer aerem aut aqua aquam manifesto non trahat in
corporibus integris, tamen bulla approximata bullae facilius dissolvit
bullam quam si bulla illa altera abesset, ob appetitum coitionis aquae
cum aqua et aeris cum aere Atque hujusmodi Instantiae Clandestinae (quae
sunt usus nobilissimi, ut dictum est) in portionibus corporum parvis et
subtilibus maxime se dant conspiciendas. Quia massae rerum majores
sequuntur formas magis catholicas et generales; ut suo loco dicetur.</p>
<ol start="26" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus quinto loco Instantias
Constitutivas, quas etiam Manipulares appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt
quae constituunt unam speciem naturae inquisitae tanquam Formam Minorem.
Cum enim formae legitimae (quae sunt semper convertibiles cum naturis
inquisitis) lateant in profundo nec facile inveniantur, postulat res et
infirmitas humani intellectus ut formae particulares, quae sunt
congregativae Manipulorum quorundam instantiarum (neutiquam vero omnium)
in notionem aliquam communem, non negligantur, verum diligentius
notentur. Quicquid enim unit naturam, licet modis imperfectis, ad
inventionem formarum viam sternit. Itaque instantiae, quae ad hoc utiles
sunt non sunt contemnendae potestatis, sed habent nonnullam
praerogativam.</p>
<p>Verum in his diligens est adhibenda cautio, ne intellectus humanus,
postquam complures ex istis formis particularibus adinvenerit atque inde
partitiones sive divisiones naturae inquisitae confecerit, in illis
omnino acquiescat, atque ad inventionem legitimam Formae Magnae se non
accingat, sed praesupponat naturam velut a radicibus esse multiplicem et
divisam, atque ulteriorem naturae unionem, tanquam rem supervacuae
subtilitatis et vergentem ad merum abstractum, fastidiat et
rejiciat.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Memoria, sive Excitans et
Adjuvans memoriam. Instantiae constitutivae sunt, ordo sive distributio,
quae manifesto juvat memoriam; item Loci in memoria artificiali, qui aut
possunt esse loci secundum proprium sensum, veluti janua, angulus,
fenestra, et similia, aut possunt esse personae familiares et notae, aut
possunt esse quidvis ad placitum (modo in ordine certo ponantur), veluti
animalia, herbae; etiam verba, literae, characteres, personae
historicae, et caetera; licet nonnulla ex his magis apta sint et
commoda, alia minus. Hujusmodi autem Loci memoriam insigniter juvant,
eamque longe supra vires naturales exaltant. Item carmina facilius
haerent et discuntur memoriter quam prosa. Atque ex isto manipulo trium
instantiarum, videlicet ordinis, locorum artificialis memoriae, et
versuum, constituitur species una auxilii ad Memoriam. Species autem
illa Abscissio Infiniti recte vocari possit. Cum enim quis aliquid
reminisci aut revocare in memoriam nititur, si nullam praenotionem
habeat aut perceptionem ejus quod quaerit, quaerit certe et molitur et
hac illac discurrit, tanquam in infinito. Quod si certam aliquam
praenotionem habeat, statim abscinditur infinitum, et fit discursus
memoriae magis in vicino. In tribus autem illis instantiis quae superius
dictae sunt, praenotio perspicua est et certa. In prima videlicet, debet
esse aliquid quod congruat cum ordine; in secunda debet esse imago quae
relationem aliquam habeat sive convenientiam ad illa loca certa; in
tertia, debent esse verba quae cadant in versum. Atque ita abscinditur
infinitum. Aliae autem instantiae dabunt hanc alteram speciem; ut
quicquid deducat intellectuale ad feriendum sensum (quae ratio etiam
praecipue viget in artificiali memoria) juvet memoriam. Aliae instantiae
dabunt hanc alteram speciem; ut quae faciunt impressionem in affectu
forti, incutientia scilicet metum, admirationem, pudorem, delectationem,
juvent memoriam. Aliae instantiae dabunt hanc alteram speciem; ut quae
maxime imprimuntur a mente pura et minus praeoccupata ante vel post,
veluti quae discuntur in pueritia aut quae commentamur ante somnum,
etiam primae quaeque rerum vices, magis haereant in memoria. Aliae
instantiae dabunt hanc alteram speciem; ut multitudo circumstantiarum
sive ansarum juvet memoriam, veluti scriptio per partes non continuatas,
lectio, sive recitatio voce alta. Aliae denique instantiae dabunt hanc
alteram speciem; ut quae expectantur et attentionem excitant melius
haereant, quam quae praetervolant. Itaque si scriptum aliquod vicies
perlegeris, non tam facile illud memoriter disces quam si illud legas
decies, tentando interim illud recitare, et ubi deficit memoria
inspiciendo librum. Ita ut sint veluti sex Formae Minores eorum quae
juvant Memoriam; videlicet abscissio infiniti; deductio intellectualis
ad sensibile; impressio in affectu forti; impressio in mente pura;
multitudo ansarum; praeexpectatio.</p>
<p>Similiter, exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Gustus, sive
Gustatio. Instantiae quae sequuntur sunt Constitutivae: videlicet, quod
qui non olfaciunt, sed sensu eo a natura destituti sunt, non percipiant
aut gustu distinguant cibum rancidum aut putridum, neque similiter
alliatum aut rosatum, aut hujusmodi. Rursus, illi, qui per accidens
nares habent per descensum rheumatis obstructas, non discernunt aut
percipiunt aliquid putridum aut rancidum aut aqua rosacea inspersum.
Rursus, qui afficiuntur hujusmodi rheumate, si in ipso momento, cum
aliquid foetidum aut odoratum habent in ore sive palato, emungant
fortiter, in ipso instanti manifestam perceptionem habent rancidi vel
odorati. Quae instantiae dabunt et constituent hanc speciem, vel partem
potius gustus; ut sensus gustationis ex parte nihil aliud sit quam
olfactus interior, transiens et descendens a narium meatibus
superioribus in os et palatum. At contra, salsum et dulce et acre et
acidum et austerum et amarum, et similia, haec (inquam) omnia aeque
sentiunt illi in quibus olfactus deest aut obturatur, ac quisquam alius;
ut manifestum sit sensum gustus esse compositum quiddam ex olfactu
interiori et tactu quodam exquisito; de quo nunc non est dicendi
locus.</p>
<p>Similiter, exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Communicatio
Qualitatis absque Commistione Substantiae. Instantia Lucis dabit vel
constituet unam speciem communicationis; Calor vero et Magnes alteram.
Communicatio enim lucis est tanquam momentanea, et statim perit, amota
luce originali. At calidum et virtus magnetica, postquam tramissa
fuerint vel potius excitata in alio corpore, haerent et manent ad tempus
non parvum, amoto primo movente.</p>
<p>Denique magna est omnino praerogativa instantiarum constitutivarum,
ut quae plurimum faciant et ad definitiones (praesertim particulares) et
ad divisiones sive partitiones naturarum; de quo non male dixit Plato,
Quod habendus sit tanquam pro Deo, qui definire et dividere bene
sciat.</p>
<ol start="27" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus sexto loco Instantias
Conformes, sive Proportionatas; quas etiam Parallelas, sive
Similitudines Physicas, appellare consuevimus. Eae vero sunt, quae
ostendunt similitudines et conjugationes rerum, non in formis minoribus
(quod faciunt instantiae constitutivae) sed plane in concreto. Itaque
sunt tanquam primi et infimi gradus ad unionem naturae. Neque
constituunt aliquod axioma statim ab initio, sed indicant et observant
tantum quendam consensum corporum. Attamen licet non multum promoveant
ad inveniendas formas, nihilominus magna cum utilitate revelant partium
universi fabricam, et in membris ejus exercent veluti anatomiam quandam;
atque proinde veluti manu ducunt interdum ad axiomata sublimia et
nobilia, praesertim illa quae ad mundi configurationem pertinent, potius
quam ad naturas et formas simplices.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; Instantiae Conformes sunt quae sequuntur: speculum,
et oculus; et similiter fabrica auris, et loca reddentia echo. Ex qua
conformitate, praeter ipsam observationem similitudinis, quae ad multa
utilis est, proclive est insuper colligere et formare illud axioma;
videlicet, organa sensuum et corpora quae pariunt reflexiones ad sensus
esse similis naturae. Rursus ex hoc ipso admonitus intellectus non aegre
insurgit ad axioma quoddam altius et nobilius. Hoc nimirum; nihil
interesse inter consensus sive sympathias corporum sensu praeditorum, et
inanimatorum sine sensu, nisi quod in illis accedat spiritus animalis ad
corpus ita dispositum, in his autem absit. Adeo ut quot sint consensus
in corporibus inanimatis, tot possint esse sensus in animalibus, si
essent perforationes in corpore animato ad discursum spiritus animalis
in membrum rite dispositum, tanquam in organum idoneum. Et rursus, quot
sint sensus in animalibus, tot sint proculdubio motus in corpore
inanimato ubi spiritus animalis abfuerit; licet necesse sit multo plures
esse motus in corporibus inanimatis quam sensus in animatis, propter
paucitatem organorum sensus. Atque hujus rei ostendit se exemplum valde
manifestum in doloribus. Etenim quum sint plura genera doloris in
animalibus, et tanquam varii illius characteres (veluti alius est dolor
ustionis, alius frigoris intensi, alius puncturae, alius compressionis,
alius extensionis, et similium), certissimum est omnia illa, quoad
motum, inesse corporibus inanimatis; veluti ligno aut lapidi, cum
uritur, aut per gelu constringitur, aut pungitur, aut scinditur, aut
flectitur, aut tunditur, et sic de aliis; licet non subintrent sensus,
propter absentiam spiritus animalis.</p>
<p>Item instantiae conformes (quod mirum fortasse dictu) sunt radices et
rami plantarum. Omne enim vegetabile intumescit, et extrudit partes in
circumferentiam, tam sursum quam deorsum. Neque alia est differentia
radicum et ramorum, quam quod radix includatur in terra, et rami
exponantur aeri et soli. Si quis enim accipiat ramum tenerum et vegetum
arboris, atque illum reflectat in aliquam terrae particulam, licet non
cohaereat ipsi solo, gignit statim non ramum, sed radicem. Atque vice
versa, si terra ponatur superius, atque ita obstruatur lapide aut aliqua
dura substantia, ut planta cohibeatur nec possit frondescere sursum,
edet ramos in aerem deorsum.</p>
<p>Item instantiae conformes sunt gummi arborum, et pleraeque gemmae
rupium. Utraque enim nil aliud sunt quam exudationes et percolationes
succorum: in primo genere scilicet, succorum ex arboribus; in secundo,
ex saxis; unde gignitur claritudo et splendor in utrisque, per
percolationem nimirum tenuem et accuratam. Nam inde fit etiam, quod pili
animalium non sint tam pulchri et tam vividi coloris quam avium plumae
complures: quia succi non tam delicate percolantur per cutem quam per
calamum.</p>
<p>Item instantiae conformes sunt scrotum in animalibus masculis, et
matrix in femellis. Adeo ut nobilis illa fabrica per quam sexus
differunt (quatenus ad animalia terrestria), nil aliud videatur esse,
quam secundum exterius et interius; vi scilicet majore caloris genitalia
in sexu masculo protrudente in exterius, ubi in femellis nimis debilis
est calor quam ut hoc facere possit; unde accidit quod contineantur
interius.</p>
<p>Item instantiae conformes sunt pinnae piscium, et pedes quadrupedum,
aut pedes et alae volucrum; quibus addidit Aristoteles quatuor volumina
in motu serpentum. Adeo ut in fabrica universi motus viventium plerunque
videatur expediri per quaterniones artuum sive flexionum.</p>
<p>Item dentes in animalibus terrestribus, et rostra in avibus, sunt
instantiae conformes; unde manifestum est, in omnibus animalibus
perfectis fluere duram quandam substantiam versus os.</p>
<p>Item non absurda est similitudo et conformitas illa, ut homo sit
tanquam planta inversa. Nam radix nervorum et facultatum animalium est
caput; partes autem seminales sunt infirmae, non computatis
extremitatibus tibiarum et brachiorum. At in planta, radix (quae instar
capitis est) regulariter infimo loco collocatur; semina autem
supremo.</p>
<p>Denique illud omnino praecipiendum est et saepius monendum; ut
diligentia hominum in inquisitione et congerie Naturalis Historiae
deinceps mutetur plane, et vertatur in contrarium ejus quod nunc in usu
est. Magna enim hucusque atque adeo curiosa fuit hominum industria in
notanda rerum varietate atque explicandis accuratis animalium, herbarum,
et fossilium differentiis; quarum pleraeque magis sunt lusus naturae
quam seriae alicujus utilitatis versus scientias. Faciunt certe
hujusmodi res ad delectationem, atque etiam quandoque ad praxin; verum
ad introspiciendam naturam parum aut nihil. Itaque convertenda plane est
opera ad inquirendas et notandas rerum similitudines et analoga, tam in
integralibus quam partibus. Illae enim sunt quae naturam uniunt, et
constituere scientias incipiunt.</p>
<p>Verum in his omnino est adhibenda cautio gravis et severa; ut
accipiantur pro instantiis conformibus et proportionatis illae, quae
denotant similitudines (ut ab initio diximus) physicas; id est, reales
et substantiales et immersas in natura, non fortuitas et ad speciem;
multo minus superstitiosas aut curiosas, quales naturalis magiae
scriptores (homines levissimi, et in rebus tam seriis quales nunc agimus
vix nominandi) ubique ostentant; magna cum vanitate et desipientia,
inanes similitudines et sympathias rerum describentes atque etiam
quandoque affingentes.</p>
<p>Verum his missis, etiam in ipsa configuratione mundi in majoribus non
sunt negligendae instantiae conformes; veluti Africa, et regio Peruviana
cum continente se porrigente usque ad Fretum Magellanicum. Utraque enim
regio habet similes isthmos et similia promontoria, quod non temere
accidit.</p>
<p>Item Novus et Vetus Orbis; in eo quod utrique orbes versus
septentriones lati sunt et exporrecti, versus austrum autem angusti et
acuminati.</p>
<p>Item instantiae conformes nobilissimae sunt frigora intensa in media
(quam vocant) aeris regione, et ignes acerrimi qui saepe reperiuntur
erumpentes ex locis subterraneis; quae duae res sunt ultimitates et
extrema; naturae scilicet frigidi versus ambitum coeli, et naturae
calidi versus viscera terrae; per antiperistasin, sive rejectionem
naturae contrariae.</p>
<p>Postremo autem in axiomatibus scientiarum notatu digna est
conformitas instantiarum. Veluti tropus rhetoricae, qui dicitur Praeter
Expectatum, conformis est tropo musicae, qui vocatur Declinatio
Cadentiae. Similiter, postulatum mathematicum, ut quae eidem tertio
aequalia sunt etiam inter se sint aequalia, conforme est cum fabrica
syllogismi in logica, qui unit ea quae conveniunt in medio. Denique
multum utilis est in quamplurimis sagacitas quaedam in conquirendis et
indagandis conformitatibus et similitudinibus physicis.</p>
<ol start="28" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus septimo loco Instantias
Monodicas; quas etiam Irregulares sive Heteroclitas (sumpto vocabulo a
grammaticis) appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt, quae ostendunt corpora in
concreto, quae videntur esse extravagantia et quasi abrupta in natura,
et minime convenire cum aliis rebus ejusdem generis. Etenim instantiae
conformes sunt similes alterius, at instantiae monodicae sunt sui
similes. Usus vero instantiarum monodicarum est talis qualis est
instantiarum clandestinarum: viz. ad evehendam et uniendam naturam ad
invenienda genera sive communes naturas, limitandas postea per
differentias veras. Neque enim desistendum ab inquisitione donec
proprietates et qualitates, quae inveniuntur in hujusmodi rebus quae
possunt censeri pro miraculis naturae, reducantur et comprehendantur sub
aliqua forma sive lege certa: ut irregularitas sive singularitas omnis
reperiatur pendere ab aliqua forma communi; miraculum vero illud sit
tandem solummodo in differentiis accuratis et gradu et concursu raro, et
non in ipsa specie: ubi nunc contemplationes hominum non procedant ultra
quam ut ponant hujusmodi res pro secretis et magnalibus naturae, et
tanquam incausabilibus, et pro exceptionibus regularum generalium.</p>
<p>Exempla instantiarum monodicarum sunt, sol et luna, inter astra;
magnes, inter lapides; argentum vivum, inter metalla; elephas, inter
quadrupedes; sensus veneris, inter genera tactus; odor venaticus in
canibus, inter genera olfactus. Etiam S litera apud grammaticos, habetur
pro monodica; ob facilem compositionem quam sustinet cum consonantibus,
aliquando duplicibus, aliquando triplicibus; quod nulla alia litera
facit. Plurimi autem faciendae sunt hujusmodi instantiae; quia acuunt et
vivificant inquisitionem, et medentur intellectui depravato a
consuetudine et ab iis quae fiunt plerunque.</p>
<ol start="29" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco octavo Instantias
Deviantes; errores scilicet naturae, et vaga, ac monstra: ubi natura
declinat et deflectit a cursu ordinario. Differunt enim errores naturae
ab instantiis monodicis in hoc; quod monodicae sint miracula specierum,
at errores sint miracula individuorum. Similis autem fere sunt usus;
quia rectificant intellectum adversus consueta, et revelant formas
communes. Neque enim in his etiam desistendum ab inquisitione donec
inveniatur causa hujusmodi declinationis. Veruntamen causa illa non
exurgit ad formam aliquam proprie, sed tantum ad latentem processum ad
formam. Qui enim vias naturae noverit, is deviationes etiam facilius
observabit. At rursus, qui deviationes noverit, is accuratius vias
describet.</p>
<p>Atque in illo differunt etiam ab instantiis monodicis, quod multo
magis instruant praxin et operativam. Nam novas species generare arduum
admodum foret; at species notas variare, et inde rara multa ac inusitata
producere, minus arduum. Facilis autem transitus est a miraculis naturae
ad miracula artis. Si enim deprehendatur semel natura in variatione sua,
ejusque ratio manifesta fuerit, expeditum erit eo deducere naturam per
artem quo per casum aberraverit. Neque solum eo, sed et aliorsum; cum
errores ex una parte monstrent et aperiant viam ad errores et
deflexiones undequaque. Hic vero exemplis non est opus, propter eorundem
copiam. Facienda enim est congeries sive historia naturalis particularis
omnium monstrorum et partuum naturae prodigiosorum; omnis denique
novitatis et raritatis et inconsueti in natura. Hoc vero faciendum est
cum severissimo delectu, ut constet fides. Maxime autem habenda sunt pro
suspectis quae pendent quomodocunque a religione, ut prodigia Livii: nec
minus, quae inveniuntur in scriptoribus magiae naturalis, aut etiam
alchymiae, et hujusmodi hominibus; qui tanquam proci sunt et amatores
fabularum. Sed depromenda sunt illa ex gravi et fida historia, et
auditionibus certis.</p>
<ol start="30" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco nono Instantias
Limitaneas; quas etiam Participia vocare consuevimus. Eae vero sunt,
quae exhibent species corporum tales, quae videntur esse compositae ex
speciebus duabus, vel rudimenta inter speciem unam et alteram. Hae vero
instantiae inter instantias monodicas sive heteroclitas recte numerari
possunt: sunt enim in universitate rerum rarae et extraordinariae. Sed
tamen ob dignitatem seorsim tractandae et ponendae sunt; optime enim
indicant compositionem et fabricam rerum, et innuunt causas numeri et
qualitatis specierum ordinariarum in universo, et deducunt intellectum
ab eo quod est, ad id quod esse potest.</p>
<p>Harum exempla sunt: muscus, inter putredinem et plantam; cometae
nonnulli, inter stellas et meteora ignita; pisces volantes, inter aves
et pisces; vespertiliones, inter aves et quadrupedes; etiam</p>
<p>‘Simia quam similis turpissima bestia nobis;’</p>
<p>et partus animalium biformes et commisti ex speciebus diversis; et
similia.</p>

</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus decimo loco Instantias
Potestatis, sive Fascium (sumpto vocabulo ab insignibus imperii), quas
etiam Ingenia, sive Manus Hominis appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt opera
maxime nobilia et perfecta, et tanquam ultima in unaquaque arte. Cum
enim hoc agatur praecipue ut natura pareat rebus et commodis humanis;
consentaneum est prorsus, ut opera, quae jampridem in potestate hominis
fuerunt (quasi provinciae antea occupatae et subactae), notentur et
numerentur; praesertim ea quae sunt maxime enucleata et perfecta:
propterea quod ab istis proclivior et magis in propinquo sit transitus
ad nova et hactenus non inventa. Si quis enim ab horum contemplatione
attenta propositum acriter et strenue urgere velit, fiet certe ut aut
producat illa paulo longius, aut deflectat illa ad aliquid quod
finitimum est, aut etiam applicet et transferat illa ad usum aliquem
nobiliorem.</p>
<p>Neque hic finis. Verum quemadmodum ab operibus naturae raris et
inconsuetis erigitur intellectus et elevatur ad inquirendas et
inveniendas formas, quae etiam illorum sunt capaces, ita etiam in
operibus artis egregiis et admirandis hoc usu-venit; idque multo magis;
quia modus efficiendi et operandi hujusmodi miracula artis manifestus ut
plurimum est, cum plerunque in miraculis naturae sit magis obscurus.
Attamen in his ipsis cautio est adhibenda vel maxime, ne deprimant
scilicet intellectum et eum quasi humo affigant.</p>
<p>Periculum enim est, ne per hujusmodi opera artis, quae videntur velut
summitates quaedam et fastigia industriae humanae, reddatur intellectus
attonitus et ligatus et quasi maleficiatus quoad illa, ita ut cum aliis
consuescere non possit, sed cogitet nihil ejus generis fieri posse nisi
eadem via qua illa effecta sunt, accedente tantummode diligentia majore
et praeparatione magis accurata.</p>
<p>Contra, illud ponendum est pro certo: vias et modos efficiendi res et
opera, quae adhuc reperta sunt et notata, res esse plerunque
pauperculas; atque omnem potentiam majorem pendere et ordine derivari a
fontibus formarum, quarum nulla adhuc inventa est.</p>
<p>Itaque (ut alibi diximus) qui de machinis et arietibus, quales erant
apud veteres, cogitasset, licet hoc fecisset obnixe atque aetatem in eo
consumpsisset, nunquam tamen incidisset in inventum tormentorum igneorum
operantium per pulverem pyrium. Neque rursus, qui in lanificiis et
serico vegetabili observationem suam et meditationem collocasset, unquam
per ea reperisset naturam vermis aut serici bombycini.</p>
<p>Quocirca omnia inventa, quae censeri possunt magis nobilia (si animum
advertas), in lucem prodiere, nullo modo per pusillas enucleationes et
extensiones artium, sed omnino per casum. Nihil autem repraesentat aut
anticipat casum (cujus mos est ut tantum per longa saecula operetur),
praeter inventionem formarum.</p>
<p>Exempla autem hujusmodi instantiarum particularia nihil opus est
adducere, propter copiam eorundem. Nam hoc omnino agendum; ut visitentur
et penitus introspiciantur omnes artes mechanicae, atque liberales etiam
(quatenus ad opera), atque inde facienda est congeries sive historia
particularis, tanquam magnalium et operum magistralium et maxime
perfectorum in unaquaque ipsarum, una cum modis effectionis sive
operationis.</p>
<p>Neque tamen astringimus diligentiam, quae adhibenda est in hujusmodi
collecta, ad ea quae censentur pro magisteriis et arcanis alicujus artis
tantum, atque movent admirationem. Admiratio enim proles est raritatis;
siquidem rara, licet in genere sint ex vulgatis naturis, tamen
admirationem pariunt.</p>
<p>At contra, quae revera admirationi esse debent propter discrepantiam
quae inest illis in specie collatis ad alias species, tamen si in usu
familiari praesto sint leviter notantur. Debent autem notari monodica
artis, non minus quam monodica naturae; de quibus antea diximus. Atque
quemadmodum in monodicis naturae posuimus solem, lunam, magnetem, et
similia, quae re vulgatissima sunt sed natura tamen fere singulari: idem
et de monodicis artis faciendum est.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; instantia monodica artis est papyrus; res admodum
vulgata. At si diligenter animum advertas, materiae artificiales aut
plane textiles sunt per fila directa et transversa; qualia sunt pannus
sericus, aut laneus, et linteus, et hujusmodi: aut coagmentantur ex
succis concretis; qualia sunt later, aut argilla figularis, aut vitrum,
aut esmalta, aut porcellana, et similia; quae si bene uniantur
splendent, sin minus, indurantur certe, sed non splendent. Attamen omnia
talia, quae fiunt ex succis concretis, sunt fragilia, nec ullo modo
haerentia et tenacia. At contra, papyrus est corpus tenax, quod scindi
et lacerari possit; ita ut imitetur et fere aemuletur pellem sive
membranam alicujus animalis, aut folium alicujus vegetabilis, et
hujusmodi opificia naturae. Nam neque fragilis est, ut vitrum; neque
textilis, ut pannus; sed habet fibras certe, non fila distincta, omnino
ad modum materiarum naturalium: ut inter artificiales materias vix
inveniatur simile aliquod, sed sit plane monodicum. Atque praeferenda
sane sunt in artificialibus ea quae maxime accedunt ad imitationem
naturae, aut e contrario eam potenter regunt et invertunt.</p>
<p>Rursus, inter ingenia et manus hominis, non prorsus contemnenda sunt
praestigiae et jocularia. Nonnulla enim ex istis, licet sint usu levia
et ludicra, tamen informatione valida esse possunt.</p>
<p>Postremo, neque omnino omittenda sunt superstitiosa, et (prout
vocabulum sensu vulgari accipitur) magica. Licet enim hujusmodi res sint
in immensum obrutae grandi mole mendaciorum et fabularum, tamen
inspiciendum paulisper si forte subsit et lateat in aliquibus earum
aliqua operatio naturalis; ut in fascino, et fortificatione
imaginationis, et consensu rerum ad distans, et transmissione
impressionum a spiritu ad spiritum non minus quam a corpore ad corpus,
et similibus.</p>
<ol start="32" type="I">

<p>Ex iis, quae ante dicta sunt, patet quod quinque illa instantiarum
genera de quibus diximus (viz. instantiarum conformium, instantiarum
monodicarum, instantiarum deviantium, instantiarum limitanearum,
instantiarum potestatis) non debeant reservari, donec inquiratur natura
aliqua certa (quemadmodum instantiae reliquae, quas primo loco
proposuimus, nec non plurimae ex iis quae sequentur, reservari debent);
sed statim jam ab initio facienda est earum collectio, tanquam historia
quaedam particularis; eo quod digerant ea quae ingrediuntur intellectum,
et corrigant pravam complexionem intellectus ipsius, quem omnino necesse
est imbui et infici et demum perverti ac distorqueri ab incursibus
quotidianis et consuetis.</p>
<p>Itaque adhibendae sunt eae instantiae tanquam praeparativum aliquod,
ad rectificandum et expurgandum intellectum. Quicquid enim abducit
intellectum a consuetis, aequat et complanat aream ejus ad recipiendum
lumen siccum et purum notionum verarum.</p>
<p>Quin etiam hujusmodi instantiae sternunt et praestruunt viam ad
operativam; ut suo loco dicemus, quando de Deductionibus ad Praxin sermo
erit.</p>
<ol start="33" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco undecimo Instantias
Comitatus, atque Hostiles; quas etiam Instantias Propositionum Fixarum
appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt instantiae, quae exhibent aliquod corpus
sive concretum tale, in quo natura inquisita perpetuo sequatur tanquam
comes quidam individuus: aut contra, in quo natura inquisita perpetuo
fugiat atque ex comitatu excludatur, ut hostis et inimicus. Nam ex
hujusmodi instantiis formantur propositiones certae et universales, aut
affirmativae aut negativae; in quibus subjectum erit tale corpus in
concreto, praedicatum vero natura ipsa inquisita. Etenim propositiones
particulares omnino fixae non sunt, ubi scilicet natura inquisita
reperitur in aliquo concreto fluxa et mobilis, viz. accedens sive
acquisita, aut rursus recedens sive deposita. Quocirca particulares
propositiones non habent praerogativam aliquam majorem, nisi tantum in
casu migrationis; de quo antea dictum est. Et nihilominus, etiam
particulares illae propositiones comparatae et collatae cum
universalibus multum juvant; ut suo loco dicetur. Neque tamen, etiam in
universalibus istis propositionibus exactam aut absolutam affirmationem
vel abnegationem requirimus. Sufficit enim ad id quod agitur, etiamsi
exceptionem nonnullam singularem aut raram patiantur.</p>
<p>Usus autem instantiarum comitatus est ad angustiandam affirmativam
formae. Quemadmodum enim in instantiis migrantibus angustiatur
affirmativa formae; viz. ut necessario poni debeat forma rei esse
aliquid quod per actum illum migrationis inditur aut destruitur; ita
etiam in instantiis comitatus angustiatur affirmativa formae; ut
necessario poni debeat forma rei esse aliquid quod talem concretionem
corporis subingrediatur, aut contra ab eadem abhorreat; ut qui bene
norit constitutionem aut schematismum hujusmodi corporis non longe
abfuerit ab extrahenda in lucem forma naturae inquisitae.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Calidum. Instantia comitatus est
flamma. Etenim in aqua, aere, lapide, metallo, et aliis quamplurimis,
calor est mobilis, et accedere potest et recedere: at omnis flamma est
calida, ita ut calor in concretione flammae perpetuo sequatur. At
instantia hostilis calidi nulla reperitur apud nos. Nam de visceribus
terrae nihil constat ad sensum; sed eorum corporum quae nobis nota sunt
nulla prorsus est concretio quae non est susceptibilis caloris.</p>
<p>At rursus, sit natura inquisita Consistens. Instantia hostilis est
aer. Etenim metallum potest fluere, potest consistere; similiter vitrum;
etiam aqua potest consistere, cum conglaciatur: at impossibile est ut
aer unquam consistat, aut exuat fluorem.</p>
<p>Verum de instantiis hujusmodi propositionum fixarum supersunt duo
monita, quae utilia sunt ad id quod agitur. Primum, ut si defuerit plane
universalis affirmativa aut negativa, illud ipsum diligenter notetur
tanquam non-ens; sicut fecimus de calido, ubi universalis negativa
(quatenus ad entia quae ad nostram notitiam pervenerint) in rerum natura
deest. Similiter, si natura inquisita sit aeternum aut incorruptibile,
deest affirmativa universalis hic apud nos. Neque enim praedicari potest
Aeternum aut Incorruptibile de aliquo corpore eorum quae infra coelestia
sunt, aut supra interiora terrae. Alterum monitum est, ut
propositionibus universalibus, tam affirmativis quam negativis, de
aliquo concreto, subjungantur simul ea concreta quae proxime videntur
accedere ad id quod est ex non-entibus: ut in calore, flammae
mollissimae et minimum adurentes; in incorruptibili, aurum, quod proxime
accedit. Omnia enim ista indicant terminos naturae inter ens et non-ens;
et faciunt ad circumscriptiones formarum, ne gliscant et vagentur extra
conditiones materiae.</p>
<ol start="34" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco duodecimo ipsas illas
Instantias Subjunctivas, de quibus in superiori aphorismo diximus: quas
etiam Instantias Ultimitatis sive Termini appellare consuevimus. Neque
enim hujusmodi instantiae utiles sunt tantum, quatenus subjunguntur
propositionibus fixis; verum etiam per se, et in proprietate sua.
Indicant enim non obscure veras sectiones naturae, et mensuras rerum, et
illud Quousque natura quid faciat et ferat, et deinde transitus naturae
ad aliud. Talia sunt, aurum, in pondere; ferrum, in duritie; cete, in
quantitate animalium; canis, in odore; inflammatio pulveris pyrii, in
expansione celeri; et alia id genus. Nec minus exhibenda sunt ea quae
sunt ultima gradu infimo, quam quae supremo; ut spiritus vini, in
pondere; sericum, in mollitie; vermiculi cutis, in quantitate animalium;
et caetera.</p>
<ol start="35" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco decimo tertio
Instantias Foederis sive Unionis. Eae sunt, quae confundunt et adunant
naturas, quae existimantur esse heterogeneae, et pro talibus notantur et
signantur per divisiones receptas.</p>
<p>At instantiae foederis ostendunt operationes et effectus, quae
deputantur alicui ex illis heterogeneis ut propria, competere etiam
aliis ex heterogeneis; ut convincatur ista heterogenia (quae in opinione
est) vera non esse aut essentialis, sed nil aliud esse quam modificatio
naturae communis. Optimi itaque sunt usus ad elevandum et evehendum
intellectum a differentiis ad genera; et ad tollendum larvas et
simulachra rerum, prout occurrunt et prodeunt personatae in substantiis
concretis.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia: sit natura inquisita Calidum. Omnino videtur esse
divisio solennis et authentica, quod sint tria genera caloris;
viz. calor coelestium, calor animalium, et calor ignis; quodque isti
calores (praesertim unus ex illis comparatus ad reliquos duos) sint ipsa
essentia et specie, sive natura specifica, differentes et plane
heterogenei: quandoquidem calor coelestium et animalium generet et
foveat, at calor ignis contra corrumpat et destruat. Est itaque
instantia foederis experimentum illud satis vulgatum, cum recipitur
ramus aliquis vitis intra domum ubi sit focus assiduus, ex quo
maturescunt uvae etiam mense integro citius quam foras; ita ut maturatio
fructus etiam pendentis super arborem fieri possit, scilicet ab igne,
cum hoc ipsum videatur esse opus proprium solis. Itaque ab hoc initio
facile insurgit intellectus, repudiata heterogenia essentiali, ad
inquirendum quae sint differentiae illae quae revera reperiuntur inter
calorem solis et ignis, ex quibus fit ut eorum operationes sint tam
dissimiles, utcunque illi ipsi participent ex natura communi.</p>
<p>Quae differentiae reperientur quatuor: viz. primo, quod calor solis
respectu caloris ignis sit gradu longe clementior et lenior; secundo,
quod sit (praesertim ut defertur ad nos per aerem) qualitate multo
humidior; tertio (quod caput rei est), quod sit summe inaequalis, atque
accedens et auctus, et deinceps recedens et diminutus; id quod maxime
confert ad generationem corporum. Recte enim asseruit Aristoteles causam
principalem generationum et corruptionum, quae fiunt hic apud nos in
superficie terrae, esse viam obliquam solis per zodiacum; unde calor
solis, partim per vicissitudines diei et noctis, partim per successiones
aestatis et hyemis, evadit miris modis inaequalis. Neque tamen desinit
ille vir id quod ab eo recte inventum fuit statim corrumpere et
depravare. Nam ut arbiter scilicet naturae (quod illi in more est) valde
magistraliter assignat causam generationis accessui solis, causam autem
corruptionis recessui; cum utraque res (accessus videlicet solis et
recessus) non respective, sed quasi indifferenter, praebeat causam tam
generationi quam corruptioni; quandoquidem inaequalitas caloris
generationi et corruptioni rerum, aequalitas conservationi tantum
ministret. Est et quarta differentia inter calorem solis et ignis, magni
prorsus momenti: viz. quod sol operationes suas insinuet per longa
temporis spatia, ubi operationes ignis (urgente hominum impatientia) per
breviora intervalla ad exitum perducantur. Quod si quis id sedulo agat,
ut calorem ignis attemperet et reducat ad gradum moderatiorem et
leniorem (quod multis modis facile fit), deinde etiam inspergat et
admisceat nonnullam humiditatem, maxime autem si imitetur calorem solis
in inaequalitate, postremo si moram patienter toleret (non certe eam
quae sit proportionata operibus solis, sed largiorem quam homines
adhibere solent in operibus ignis), is facile missam faciet heterogeniam
illam caloris, et vel tentabit vel exaequabit vel in aliquibus vincet
opera solis, per calorem ignis. Similis instantia foederis est
resuscitatio papilionum ex frigore stupentium et tanquam emortuarum, per
exiguum teporem ignis; ut facile cernas non magis negatum esse igni
vivificare animantia quam maturare vegetabilia. Etiam inventum illud
celebre Fracastorii de sartagine acriter calefacta, qua circundant
medici capita apoplecticorum desperatorum, expandit manifeste spiritus
animales ab humoribus et obstructionibus cerebri compressos et quasi
extinctos, illosque ad motum excitat, non aliter quam ignis operatur in
aquam aut aerem, et tamen per consequens vivificat. Etiam ova aliquando
excluduntur per calorem ignis, id quod prorsus imitatur calorem
animalem; et complura ejusmodi; ut nemo dubitare possit quin calor ignis
in multis subjectis modificari possit ad imaginem caloris coelestium et
animalium.</p>
<p>Similiter sint naturae inquisitae Motus et Quies. Videtur esse
divisio solennis atque ex intima philosophia, quod corpora naturalia vel
rotent, vel ferantur recta, vel stent sive quiescant. Aut enim est motus
sine termino, aut statio in termino, aut latio ad terminum. At motus
ille perennis rotationis videtur esse coelestium proprius; statio sive
quies videtur competere globo ipsi terrae; at corpora caetera (gravia
quae vocant et levia, extra loca scilicet connaturalitatis suae sita)
feruntur recta ad massas sive congregationes similium; levia sursum,
versus ambitum coeli; gravia deorsum, versus terram. Atque ista pulchra
dictu sunt.</p>
<p>At instantia foederis est cometa aliquis humilior; qui cum sit longe
infra coelum, tamen rotat. Atque commentum Aristotelis de alligatione
sive sequacitate cometae ad astrum aliquod jampridem explosum est; non
tantum quia ratio ejus non est probabilis, sed propter experientiam
manifestam discursus et irregularis motus cometarum per varia loca
coeli.</p>
<p>At rursus alia instantia foederis circa hoc subjectum est motus
aeris; qui intra tropicos (ubi circuli rotationis sunt majores) videtur
et ipse rotare ab oriente in occidentem.</p>
<p>Et alia rursus instantia foret fluxus et refluxus maris, si modo
aquae ipsae deprehendantur ferri motu rotationis (licet tardo et
evanido) ab oriente in occidentem; ita tamen ut bis in die
repercutiantur. Itaque, si haec ita se habeant, manifestum est motum
istum rotationis non terminari in coelestibus, sed communicari aeri et
aquae.</p>
<p>Etiam ista proprietas levium, nimirum ut ferantur sursum, vacillat
nonnihil. Atque in hoc sumi potest pro instantia foederis bulla aquae.
Si enim aer fuerit subter aquam, ascendit rapide versus superficiem
aquae, per motum illum plagae (quam vocat Democritus), per quam aqua
descendens percutit et attollit aerem sursum; non autem per contentionem
aut nixum aeris ipsius. Atqui ubi ad superficiem ipsam aquae ventum
fuerit, tum cohibetur aer ab ulteriore ascensu, per levem resistentiam
quam reperit in aqua non statim tolerante se discontinuari: ita ut
exilis admodum sit appetitus aeris ad superiora.</p>
<p>Similiter sit natura inquisita Pondus. Est plane divisio recepta, ut
densa et solida ferantur versus centrum terrae, rara autem et tenuia
versus ambitum coeli; tanquam ad loca sua propria. Atque loca quod
attinet, (licet in scholis hujusmodi res valeant) plane inepta et
puerilis cogitatio est, locum aliquid posse. Itaque nugantur philosophi
cum dicant quod, si perforata esset terra, corpora gravia se sisterent
quando ventum esset ad centrum. Esset enim certe virtuosum plane et
efficax genus nihili, aut puncti mathematici, quod aut alia afficeret,
aut rursus quod alia appeterent: corpus enim non nisi a corpore patitur.
Verum iste appetitus ascendendi et descendendi aut est in schematismo
corporis quod movetur, aut in sympathia sive consensu cum alio corpore.
Quod si inveniatur aliquod corpus densum et solidum, quod nihilominus
non feratur ad terram, confunditur hujusmodi divisio. At si recipiatur
opinio Gilberti, quod magnetica vis terrae ad alliciendum gravia non
extendatur ultra orbem virtutis suae (quae operatur semper ad distantiam
certam, et non ultra), hocque per aliquam instantiam verificetur; ea
demum erit instantia foederis circa hoc subjectum. Neque tamen occurrit
impraesentiarum aliqua instantia super hoc certa et manifesta. Proxime
videntur accedere cataractae coeli, quae in navigationibus per Oceanum
Atlanticum versus Indias utrasque saepe conspiciuntur. Tanta enim
videtur esse vis et moles aquarum quae per hujusmodi cataractas subito
effunditur, ut videatur collectio aquarum fuisse ante facta, atque in
his locis haesisse et mansisse; et postea potius per causam violentam
dejecta et detrusa esse, quam naturali motu gravitatis cecidisse; adeo
ut conjici possit, corpoream molem densam atque compactam in magna
distantia a terra fore pensilem tanquam terram ipsam, nec casuram nisi
dejiciatur. Verum de hoc nil certi affirmamus. Interim in hoc et in
multis aliis facile apparebit, quam inopes simus historiae naturalis;
cum loco instantiarum certarum nonnunquam suppositiones afferre pro
exemplis cogamur.</p>
<p>Similiter sit natura inquisita Discursus Ingenii. Videtur omnino
divisio vera, rationis humanae et solertiae brutorum. Attamen sunt
nonnullae instantiae actionum quae eduntur a brutis, per quas videntur
etiam bruta quasi syllogizare: ut memoriae proditum est de corvo, qui
per magnas siccitates fere enectus siti conspexit aquam in trunco cavo
arboris; atque cum non daretur ei intrare propter angustias, non
cessavit jacere multos lapillos, per quos surgeret et ascenderet aqua ut
bibere posset; quod postea cessit in proverbium.</p>
<p>Similiter sit natura inquisita Visibile. Videtur omnino esse divisio
vera et certa, lucis, quae est visibile originale et primam copiam facit
visui, et coloris, qui est visibile secundarium et sine luce non
cernitur, ita ut videatur nil aliud esse quam imago aut modificatio
lucis. Attamen ex utraque parte circa hoc videntur esse instantiae
foederis; scilicet, nix in magna quantitate, et flamma sulphuris; in
quarum altera videtur esse color primulum lucens, in altera lux vergens
ad colorem.</p>

<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco decimo quarto
Instantias Crucis; translato vocabulo a Crucibus, quae erectae in biviis
indicant et signant viarum separationes. Has etiam Instantias Decisorias
et Judiciales, et in casibus nonnullis Instantias Oraculi et Mandati,
appellare consuevimus. Earum ratio talis est. Cum in inquisitione
naturae alicujus intellectus ponitur tanquam in aequilibrio, ut incertus
sit utri naturarum e duabus, vel quandoque pluribus, causa naturae
inquisitae attribui aut assignari debeat, propter complurium naturarum
concursum frequentem et ordinarium, instantiae crucis ostendunt
consortium unius ex naturis (quoad naturam inquisitam) fidum et
indissolubile, alterius autem varium et separabile; unde terminatur
quaestio, et recipitur natura illa prior pro causa, missa altera et
repudiata. Itaque hujusmodi instantiae sunt maximae lucis, et quasi
magnae authoritatis; ita ut curriculum interpretationis quandoque in
illas desinat, et per illas perficiatur. Interdum autem Instantiae
Crucis illae occurrunt et inveniuntur inter jampridem notatas; at ut
plurimum novae sunt, et de industria atque ex composito quaesitae et
applicatae, et diligentia sedula et acri tandem erutae.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Fluxus et Refluxus Maris, ille
bis repetitus in die atque sexhorarius in accessibus et recessibus
singulis, cum differentia nonnulla quae coincidit in motum lunae. Bivium
circa hanc naturam tale est.</li>
</ol>
<p>Necesse prorsus est ut iste motus efficiatur, vel ab aquarum
progressu et regressu, in modum aquae in pelvi agitatae, quae quando
latus unum pelvis alluit, deserit alterum; vel a sublatione et
subsidentia aquarum e profundo, in modum aquae ebullientis et rursus
subsidentis. Utri vero causae fluxus et refluxus ille assignari debeat,
oritur dubitatio. Quod si recipiatur prior assertio, necesse est ut cum
sit fluxus in mari ex una parte, fiat sub idem tempus alicubi in mari
refluxus ex alia. Itaque ad hoc reducitur inquisitio. Atqui observavit
Acosta, cum aliis nonnullis (diligenti facta inquisitione), quod ad
litora Floridae et ad litora adversa Hispaniae et Africae, fiant fluxus
maris ad eadem tempora, et refluxus itidem ad eadem tempora; non contra,
quod cum fluxus fit ad littora Floridae, fiat refluxus ad littora
Hispaniae et Africae. Attamen adhuc diligentius attendenti, non per hoc
evincitur motus attolens, et abnegatur motus in progressu. Fieri enim
potest, quod sit motus aquarum in progressu, et nihilominus inundet
adversa littora ejusdem alvei simul; si aquae scilicet illae
contrudantur et compellantur aliunde, quemadmodum fit in fluviis, qui
fluunt et refluunt ad utrumque littus horis iisdem, cum tamen iste motus
liquido sit motus in progressu, nempe aquarum ingredientium ostia
fluminum ex mari. Itaque simili modo fieri potest, ut aquae venientes
magna mole ab Oceano Orientali Indico compellantur et trudantur in
alveum Maris Atlantici, et propterea inundent utrumque latus simul.
Quaerendum itaque est, an sit alius alveus per quem aquae possint iisdem
temporibus minui et refluere. Atque praesto est Mare Australe, Mari
Atlantico neutiquam minus, sed potius magis latum et extensum, quod ad
hoc sufficere possit.</p>
<p>Itaque jam tandem perventum est ad instantiam crucis circa hoc
subjectum. Ea talis est: si pro certo inveniatur, quod cum fit fluxus ad
littora adversa tam Floridae quam Hispaniae in Mari Atlantico, fiat
simul fluxus ad littora Peruviae et juxta dorsum Chinae in Mari
Australi; tum certe per hanc instantiam decisoriam abjudicanda est
assertio quod fluxus et refluxus maris, de quo inquiritur, fiat per
motum progressivum: neque enim relinquitur aliud mare aut locus, ubi
possit ad eadem tempora fieri regressus aut refluxus. Commodissime autem
hoc sciri possit, si inquiratur ab incolis Panamae et Limae (ubi uterque
Oceanus, Atlanticus et Australis, per parvum Isthmum separantur), utrum
ad contrarias Isthmi partes fiat simul fluxus et refluxus maris, an e
contra. Verum haec decisio sive abjudicatio certa videtur, posito quod
terra stet immobilis. Quod si terra rotet, fieri fortasse potest ut ex
inaequali rotatione (quatenus ad celeritatem sive incitationem) terrae
et aquarum maris, sequatur compulsio violenta aquarum in cumulum sursum,
quae sit fluxus: et relaxatio earundem (postquam amplius cumulari non
sustinuerint) in deorsum, quae sit refluxus. Verum de hoc facienda est
inquisitio separatim. Attamen etiam hoc supposito, illud aeque manet
fixum, quod necesse sit fieri alicubi refluxum maris ad eadem tempora
quibus fiunt fluxus in aliis partibus.</p>
<p>Similiter, sit natura inquisita posterior ille motus ex duobus quos
supposuimus, videlicet motus maris se attollens et rursus subsidens; si
forte ita acciderit ut (diligenti facto examine) rejiciatur motus alter,
de quo diximus, progressivus. Tum vero erit trivium circa hanc naturam
tale. Necesse est ut motus iste, per quem aquae in fluxibus et
refluxibus se attollunt et rursus relabuntur, absque aliqua accessione
aquarum aliarum quae advolvuntur, fiat per unum ex his tribus modis; vel
quod ista aquarum copia emanet ex interioribus terrae et rursus in illa
se recipiat; vel quod non sit aliqua amplior moles aquarum, sed quod
eaedem aquae (non aucto quanto suo) extendantur sive rarefiant, ita ut
majorem locum et dimensionem occupent, et rursus se contrahant; vel quod
nec copia accedat major nec extensio amplior, sed eaedem aquae (prout
sunt tam copia quam densitate aut raritate) per vim aliquam magneticam
desuper eas attrahentem et evocantem, et per consensum, se attollant et
deinde se remittant. Itaque reducatur (si placet) jam inquisitio (missis
duobus illis motibus prioribus) ad hunc ultimum; et inquiratur si fiat
aliqua talis sublatio per consensum sive vim magneticam. Atqui primo
manifestum est universas aquas, prout ponuntur in fossa sive cavo maris,
non posse simul attolli, quia defuerit quod succedat in fundo; adeo ut
si foret in aquis aliquis hujusmodi appetitus se attollendi, ille ipse
tamen a nexu rerum, sive (ut vulgo loquuntur) ne detur vacuum, fractus
foret et cohibitus. Relinquitur, ut attollantur aquae ex aliqua parte,
et per hoc minuantur et cedant ex alia. Enimvero rursus necessario
sequetur ut vis illa magnetica, cum super totum operari non possit,
circa medium operetur intensissime; ita ut aquas in medio attollat,
illae vero sublatae latera per successionem deserant et destituant.</p>
<p>Itaque jam tandem perventum est ad instantiam crucis circa hoc
subjectum. Ea talis est: si inveniatur quod in refluxibus maris aquarum
superficies in mari sit arcuata magis et rotunda, attollentibus se
scilicet aquis in medio maris et deficientibus circa latera, quae sunt
litora; et in fluxibus eadem superficies sit magis plana et aequa,
redeuntibus scilicet aquis ad priorem suam positionem; tum certe per
hanc instantiam decisoriam potest recipi sublatio per vim magneticam,
aliter prorsus abjudicanda est. Hoc vero in fretis per lineas nauticas
non difficile est experiri; videlicet utrum in refluxibus versus medium
maris, mare non sit magis altum sive profundum quam in fluxibus.
Notandum autem est, si hoc ita sit, fieri (contra ac creditur) ut
attollant se aquae in refluxibus, demittant se tantum in fluxibus, ita
ut littora vestiant et inundent.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Similiter, sit natura inquisita Motus Rotationis spontaneus; et
speciatim, utrum Motus Diurnus, per quem sol et stellae ad conspectum
nostrum oriuntur et occidunt, sit motus rotationis verus in coelestibus,
aut motus apparens in coelestibus, verus in terra. Poterit esse
instantia crucis super hoc subjectum talis. Si inveniatur motus aliquis
in oceano ab oriente in occidentem, licet admodum languidus et
enervatus; si idem motus reperiatur paulo incitatior in aere, praesertim
intra tropicos, ubi propter majores circulos est magis perceptibilis; si
idem motus reperiatur in humilioribus cometis, jam factus vivus et
validus; si idem motus reperiatur in planetis, ita tamen dispensatus et
graduatus ut quo proprius absit a terra sit tardior, quo longius
celerior, atque in coelo demum stellato sit velocissimus: tum certe
recipi debet motus diurnus pro vero in coelis, et abnegandus est motus
terrae; quia manifestum erit, motum ab oriente in occidentem esse plane
cosmicum et ex consensu universi, qui in summitatibus coeli maxime
rapidus gradatim labascat, et tandem desinat et extinguatur in immobili,
videlicet terra.</li>
</ol>
<p>Similiter, sit natura inquisita Motus Rotationis ille alter apud
astronomos decantatus, renitens et contrarius Motui Diurno, videlicet ab
occidente in orientem; quem veteres astronomi attribuunt planetis, etiam
coelo stellato, at Copernicus et ejus sectatores terrae quoque; et
quaeratur utrum inveniatur in rerum natura aliquis talis motus, an
potius res conficta sit et supposita, ad compendia et commoditates
calculationum, et ad pulchrum illud, scilicet de expediendis motibus
coelestibus per circulos perfectos. Neutiquam enim evincitur iste motus
esse in supernis verus et realis, nec per defectum restitutionis
planetae in motu diurno ad idem punctum coeli stellati, nec per diversam
politatem zodiaci, habito respectu ad polos mundi; quae duo nobis hunc
motum pepererunt. Primum enim phaenomenon per anteversionem et
derelictionem optime salvatur; secundum per lineas spirales; adeo ut
inaequalitas restitutionis et declinatio ad tropicos possint esse potius
modificationes motus unici illius diurni, quam motus renitentes aut
circa diversos polos. Et certissimum est, si paulisper pro plebeiis nos
geramus (missis astronomorum et scholae commentis, quibus illud in more
est ut sensui in multis immerito vim faciant, et obscuriora malint),
talem esse motum istum ad sensum, qualem diximus; cujus imaginem per
fila ferrea (veluti in machina) aliquando repraesentari fecimus.</p>
<p>Verum instantia crucis super hoc subjectum poterit esse talis. Si
inveniatur in aliqua historia fide digna, fuisse cometam aliquem vel
sublimiorem vel humiliorem qui non rotaverit cum consensu manifesto
(licet admodum irregulariter) motus diurni, sed potius rotaverit in
contrarium coeli; tum certe hucusque judicandum est posse esse in natura
aliquem talem motum. Sin nihil hujusmodi inveniatur, habendus est pro
suspecto, et ad alias instantias crucis circa hoc confugiendum.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Similiter, sit natura inquisita Pondus sive Grave. Bivium circa hanc
naturam tale est. Necesse est ut gravia et ponderosa vel tendant ex
natura sua ad centrum terrae, per proprium schematismum; vel ut a massa
corporea ipsius terrae, tanquam a congregatione corporum connaturalium,
attrahantur et rapiantur, et ad eam per consensum ferantur. At posterius
hoc si in causa sit, sequitur ut quo propius gravia appropinquant ad
terram, eo fortius et majore cum impetu ferantur ad eam; quo longius ab
ea absint, debilius et tardius (ut fit in attractionibus magneticis);
idque fieri intra spatium certum; adeo ut si elongata fuerint a terra
tali distantia ut virtus terrae in ea agere non possit, pensilia mansura
sint, ut et ipsa terra, nec omnino decasura.</li>
</ol>
<p>Itaque talis circa hanc rem poterit esse instantia crucis. Sumatur
horologium ex iis quae moventur per pondera plumbea, et aliud ex iis
quae moventur per compressionem laminae ferreae; atque vere probentur,
ne alterum altero velocius sit aut tardius; deinde ponatur horologium
illud movens per pondera super fastigium alicujus templi altissimi,
altero illo infra detento; et notetur diligenter si horologium in alto
situm tardius moveatur quam solebat, propter diminutam virtutem
ponderum. Idem fiat experimentum in profundis minerarum alte sub terra
depressarum, utrum horologium hujusmodi non moveatur velocius quam
solebat, propter auctam virtutem ponderum. Quod si inveniatur virtus
ponderum minui in sublimi, aggravari in subterraneis, recipiatur pro
causa ponderis attractio a massa corporea terrae.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Similiter, sit natura inquisita Verticitas Acus Ferreae, tactae
magnete. Circa hanc naturam tale erit bivium. Necesse est ut tactus
magnetis vel ex se indat ferro verticitatem ad septentriones et austrum;
vel ut excitet ferrum tantummodo et habilitet, motus autem ipse indatur
ex praesentia terrae; ut Gilbertus opinatur, et tanto conatu probare
nititur. Itaque huc spectant ea, quae ille perspicaci industria
conquisivit. Nimirum quod clavus ferreus, qui diu duravit in situ versus
septentriones et austrum, colligat mora diutina verticitatem, absque
tactu magnetis: ac si terra ipsa, quae ob distantiam debiliter operatur
(namque superficies aut extima incrustatio terrae virtutis magneticae,
ut ille vult, expers est), per moram tamen longam magnetis tactum
suppleret, et ferrum exciret, deinde excitum conformaret et verteret.
Rursus, quod ferrum ignitum et cadens, si in extinctione sua
exporrigatur inter septentriones et austrum, colligat quoque
verticitatem absque tactu magnetis: ac si partes ferri in motu positae
per ignitionem, et postea se recipientes, in ipso articulo extinctionis
suae magis essent susceptivae et quasi sensitivae virtutis manantis a
terra quam alias, et inde fierent tanquam excitae. Verum haec, licet
bene observata, tamen non evincunt prorsus quod ille asserit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instantia crucis autem circa hoc subjectum poterit esse talis.
Capiatur terrella ex magnete, et notentur poli ejus; et ponantur poli
terrellae versus orientem et occasum, non versus septentriones et
austrum, atque ita jaceant; deinde superponatur acus ferrea intacta, et
permittatur ita manere ad dies sex aut septem. Acus vero (nam de hoc non
dubitatur) dum manet super magnetem, relictis polis mundi, se vertet ad
polos magnetis; itaque quamdiu ita manet, vertitur scilicet ad orientem
et occidentem mundi. Quod si inveniatur acus illa, remota a magnete et
posita super versorium, statim se applicare ad septentriones et austrum,
vel etiam paulatim se eo recipere, tum recipienda est pro causa,
praesentia terrae; sin aut vertatur (ut prius) in orientem et
occidentem, aut perdat verticitatem, habenda est illa causa pro
suspecta, et ulterius inquirendum est.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Similiter, sit natura inquisita Corporea Substantia Lunae: an sit
tenuis, flammea, sive aerea, ut plurimi ex priscis philosophis opinati
sunt; an solida et densa, ut Gilbertus et multi moderni, cum nonnullis
ex antiquis, tenent. Rationes posterioris istius opinionis fundantur in
hoc maxime, quod luna radios solis reflectat; neque videtur fieri
reflexio lucis nisi a solidis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Itaque instantiae crucis circa hoc subjectum eae esse poterint (si
modo aliquae sint) quae demonstrent reflexionem a corpore tenui, qualis
est flamma, modo sit crassitiei sufficientis. Certe causa crepusculi,
inter alias, est reflexio radiorum solis a superiore parte aeris. Etiam
quandoque reflecti videmus radios solis temporibus vespertinis serenis a
fimbriis nubium roscidarum, non minori splendore, sed potius illustriori
et magis glorioso, quam qui redditur a corpore lunae; neque tamen
constat eas nubes coaluisse in corpus densum aquae. Etiam videmus aerem
tenebrosum pone fenestras noctu reflectere lucem candelae, non minus
quam corpus densum. Tentandum etiam foret experimentum immissionis
radiorum solis per foramen super flammam aliquam subfuscam et caeruleam.
Sane radii aperti solis, incidentes in flammas obscuriores, videntur eas
quasi mortificare, ut conspiciantur magis instar fumi albi quam flammae.
Atque haec impraesentiarum occurrunt, quae sint ex natura instantiarum
crucis circa hanc rem; et meliora fortasse reperiri possunt. Sed
notandum semper est, reflexionem a flamma non esse expectandam, nisi a
flamma alicujus profunditatis; nam aliter vergit ad diaphanum. Hoc autem
pro certo ponendum, lucem semper in corpore aequali aut excipi et
transmitti, aut resilire.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Similiter, sit natura inquisita Motus Missilium, veluti
spiculorum, sagittarum, globulorum, per aerem. Hunc motum Schola (more
suo) valde negligenter expedit; satis habens, si eum nomine motus
violenti a naturali (quem vocant) distinguat; et quod ad primam
percussionem sive impulsionem attinet, per illud, (quod duo corpora non
possint esse in uno loco, ne fiat penetratio dimensionum,) sibi
satisfaciat; et de processu continuato istius motus nihil curet. At
circa hanc naturam bivium est tale: aut iste motus fit ab aere vehente
et pone corpus emissum se colligente, instar fluvii erga scapham aut
venti erga paleas; aut a partibus ipsius corporis non sustinentibus
impressionem, sed ad eandem laxandam per successionem se promoventibus.
Atque priorem illum recipit Fracastorius, et fere omnes qui de hoc motu
paulo subtilius inquisiverunt: neque dubium est, quin sint aeris partes
in hac re nonnullae; sed alter motus proculdubio verus est, ut ex
infinitis constat experimentis. Sed inter caeteras, poterit esse circa
hoc subjectum instantia crucis talis; quod lamina, aut filum ferri paulo
contumacius, vel etiam calamus sive penna in medio divisa, adducta et
curvata inter pollicem et digitum exiliant. Manifestum enim est, hoc non
posse imputari aeri se pone corpus colligenti, quia fons motus est in
medio laminae vel calami, non in extremis.</p></li>
<li><p>Similiter sit natura inquisita motus ille rapidus et potens
Expansionis Pulveris Pyrii in flammam; unde tantae moles subvertuntur,
tanta pondera emittuntur, quanta in cuniculis majoribus et bombardis
videmus. Bivium circa hanc naturam tale est. Aut excitatur iste motus a
mero corporis appetitu se dilatandi, postquam fuerit inflammatum; aut ab
appetitu mixto spiritus crudi, qui rapide fugit ignem, et ex eo
circumfuso, tanquam ex carcere, violenter erumpit. Schola autem et
vulgaris opinio tantum versatur circa priorem illum appetitum. Putant
enim homines se pulchre philosophari, si asserant flammam ex forma
elementi necessitate quadam donari locum ampliorem occupandi quam idem
corpus expleverat cum subiret formam pulveris, atque inde sequi motum
istum. Interim minime advertunt, licet hoc verum sit, posito quod flamma
generetur, tamen posse impediri flammae generationem a tanta mole, quae
illam comprimere et suffocare queat; ut non deducatur res ad istam
necessitatem de qua loquuntur. Nam quod necesse sit fieri expansionem,
atque inde sequi emissionem aut remotionem corporis quod obstat, si
generetur flamma, recte putant. Sed ista necessitas plane evitatur, si
moles illa solida flammam supprimat antequam generetur. Atque videmus
flammam, praesertim in prima generatione, mollem esse et lenem, et
requirere cavum in quo experiri et ludere possit. Itaque tanta violentia
huic rei per se assignari non potest. Sed illud verum; generationem
hujusmodi flammarum flatulentarum, et veluti ventorum igneorum, fieri ex
conflictu duorum corporum, eorumque naturae inter se plane contrariae;
alterius admodum inflammabilis, quae natura viget in sulphure; alterius
flammam exhorrentis, qualis est spiritus crudus qui est in nitro; adeo
ut fiat conflictus mirabilis, inflammante se sulphure quantum potest
(nam tertium corpus, nimirum carbo salicis, nil aliud fere praestat,
quam ut illa duo corpora incorporet et commode uniat), et erumpente
spiritu nitri quantum potest, et una se dilatante (nam hoc faciunt et
aer, et omnia cruda, et aqua, ut a calore dilatentur), et per istam
fugam et eruptionem interim flammam sulphuris, tanquam follibus
occultis, undequaque exufflante.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Poterant autem esse instantiae crucis circa hoc subjectum duorum
generum. Alterum eorum corporum quae maxime sunt inflammabilia, qualia
sunt sulphur, caphura, naphtha, et hujusmodi, cum eorum misturis; quae
citius et facilius concipiunt flammam quam pulvis pyrius, si non
impediantur: ex quo liquet appetitum inflammandi per se effectum illum
stupendum non operari. Alterum eorum quae flammam fugiunt et exhorrent,
qualia sunt sales omnes. Videmus enim, si jaciantur in ignem, spiritum
aqueum erumpere cum fragore antequam flamma concipiatur; quod etiam
leniter fit in foliis paulo contumacioribus, parte aquea erumpente
antequam oleosa concipiat flammam. Sed maxime cernitur hoc in argento
vivo, quod non male dicitur aqua mineralis. Hoc enim, absque
inflammatione, per eruptionem et expansionem simplicem vires pulveris
pyrii fere adaequat; quod etiam admixtum pulveri pyrio ejus vires
multiplicare dicitur.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Similiter sit natura inquisita, Transitoria Natura Flammae, et
Extinctio ejus Momentanea. Non enim videtur natura flammea hic apud nos
figi et consistere, sed singulis quasi momentis generari, et statim
extingui. Manifestum enim est in flammis, quae hic continuantur et
durant, istam durationem non esse ejusdem flammae in individuo, sed
fieri per successionem novae flammae seriatim generatae, minime autem
manere eandem flammam numero; id quod facile perspicitur ex hoc, quod,
subtracto alimento sive fomite flammae, flamma statim pereat. Bivium
autem circa hanc naturam tale est. Momentanea ista natura aut fit
remittente se causa quae eam primo genuit, ut in lumine, sonis, et
motibus (quos vocant) violentis; aut quod flamma in natura sua possit
hic apud nos manere, sed a contrariis naturis circumfusis vim patiatur
et destruatur.</li>
</ol>
<p>Itaque poterit esse circa hoc subjectum instantia crucis talis.
Videmus flammas in incendiis majoribus, quam alte in sursum ascendant.
Quanto enim basis flammae est latior, tanto vertex sublimior. Itaque
videtur principium extinctionis fieri circa latera, ubi ab aere flamma
comprimitur et male habetur. At meditullia flammae, quae aer non
contingit sed alia flamma undique circumdat, eadem numero manent, neque
extinguuntur donec paulatim angustientur ab aere per latera circumfuso.
Itaque omnis flamma pyramidalis est basi circa fomitem largior, vertice
autem (inimicante aere, nec suppeditante fomite) acutior. At fumus
angustior circa basin ascendendo dilatatur, et fit tanquam pyramis
inversa; quia scilicet aer fumum recipit, flammam (neque enim quispiam
somniet aerem esse flammam accensam, cum sint corpora plane heterogenea)
comprimit.</p>
<p>Accuratior autem poterit esse instantia crucis ad hanc rem
accommodata, si res forte manifestari possit per flammas bicolores.
Capiatur igitur situla parva ex metallo, et in ea figatur parva candela
cerea accensa; ponatur situla in patera, et circumfundatur spiritus vini
in modica quantitate, quae ad labra situlae non attingat; tum accende
spiritum vini. At spiritus ille vini exhibebit flammam magis scilicet
caeruleam, lychnus candelae autem magis flavam. Notetur itaque utrum
flamma lychni (quam facile est per colorem a flamma spiritus vini
distinguere; neque enim flammae, ut liquores, statim commiscentur)
maneat pyramidalis, an potius magis tendat ad formam globosam, cum nihil
inveniatur quod eam destruat aut comprimat. At hoc posterius si fiat,
manere flammam eandem numero, quamdiu intra aliam flammam concludatur
nec vim inimicam aeris experiatur, pro certo ponendum est.</p>
<p>Atque de instantiis crucis haec dicta sint. Longiores autem in iis
tractandis ad hunc finem fuimus, ut homines paulatim discant et
assuefiant de natura judicare per instantias crucis et experimenta
lucifera, et non per rationes probabiles.</p>
<ol start="37" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo quinto
Instantias Divortii; quae indicant separationes naturarum earum quae ut
plurimum occurrunt. Differunt autem ab instantiis quae subjunguntur
instantiis comitatus; quia illae indicant separationes naturae alicujus
ab aliquo concreto cum quo illa familiariter consuescit, hae vero
separationes naturae alicujus ab altera natura. Differunt etiam ab
instantiis crucis; quia nihil determinant, sed monent tantum de
separabilitate unius naturae ab altera. Usus autem earum est ad
prodendas falsas formas, et dissipandas leves contemplationes ex rebus
obviis orientes; adeo ut veluti plumbum et pondera intellectui
addant.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia: sint naturae inquisitae quatuor naturae illae, quas
Contubernales vult esse Telesius, et tanquam ex eadem camera;
viz. calidum, lucidum, tenue, mobile sive promptum ad motum. At plurimae
inveniuntur instantiae divortii inter ipsas. Aer enim tenuis est et
habilis ad motum, non calidus aut lucidus; luna lucida, absque calore;
aqua fervens calida, absque lumine; motus acus ferreae super versorium
pernix et agilis, et tamen in corpore frigido, denso, opaco; et complura
id genus.</p>
<p>Similiter sint naturae inquisitae Natura Corporea et Actio Naturalis.
Videtur enim non inveniri actio naturalis, nisi subsistens in aliquo
corpore. Attamen possit fortasse esse circa hanc rem instantia nonnulla
divortii. Ea est actio magnetica, per quam ferrum fertur ad magnetem,
gravia ad globum terrae. Addi etiam possint aliae nonnullae operationes
ad distans. Actio siquidem hujusmodi et in tempore fit, per momenta non
in puncto temporis, et in loco, per gradus et spatia. Est itaque aliquod
momentum temporis, et aliquod intervallum loci, in quibus ista virtus
sive actio haeret in medio inter duo illa corpora quae motum cient.
Reducitur itaque contemplatio ad hoc; utrum illa corpora quae sunt
termini motus disponant vel alterent corpora media, ut per successionem
et tactum verum labatur virtus a termino ad terminum, et interim
subsistat in corpore medio; an horum nihil sit, praeter corpora et
virtutem et spatia? Atque in radiis opticis et sonis et calore et aliis
nonnullis operantibus ad distans, probabile est media corpora disponi et
alterari: eo magis, quod requiratur medium qualificatum ad deferendam
operationem talem. At magnetica illa sive coitiva virtus admittit media
tanquam adiaphora, nec impeditur virtus in omnigeno medio. Quod si nil
rei habeat virtus illa aut actio cum corpore medio, sequitur quod sit
virtus aut actio naturalis ad tempus nonnullum et in loco nonnullo
subsistens sine corpore; cum neque subsistat in corporibus
terminantibus, nec in mediis. Quare actio magnetica poterit esse
instantia divortii circa naturam corpoream et actionem naturalem. Cui
hoc adjici potest tanquam corollarium aut lucrum non praetermittendum:
viz. quod etiam secundum sensum philosophanti sumi possit probatio quod
sint entia et substantiae separatae et incorporeae. Si enim virtus et
actio naturalis, emanans a corpore, subsistere possit aliquo tempore et
aliquo loco omnino sine corpore; prope est ut possit etiam emanare in
origine sua a substantia incorporea. Videtur enim non minus requiri
natura corporea ad actionem naturalem sustentandam et devehendam, quam
ad excitandam aut generandum.</p>
<ol start="38" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sequuntur quinque ordines instantiarum, quas uno vocabulo generali
Instantias Lampadis sive Informationis Primae appellare consuevimus. Eae
sunt quae auxiliantur sensui. Cum enim omnis interpretatio naturae
incipiat a sensu, atque a sensuum perceptionibus recta, constanti, et
munita via ducat ad perceptiones intellectus, quae sunt notiones verae
et axiomata; necesse est ut, quanto magis copiosae et exactae fuerint
repraesentationes sive praebitiones ipsius sensus, tanto omnia cedant
facilius et foelicius.</p>
<p>Harum autem quinque instantiarum lampadis, primae roborant, ampliant,
et rectificant actiones sensus immediatas; secundae deducunt
non-sensibile ad sensibile; tertiae indicant processus continuatos sive
series earum rerum et motuum quae (ut plurimum) non notantur nisi in
exitu aut periodis; quartae aliquid substituunt sensui in meris
destitutionibus; quintae excitant attentionem sensus et advertentiam,
atque una limitant subtilitatem rerum. De his autem singulis jam
dicendum est.</p>

<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo sexto Instantias
Januae sive Portae: eo enim nomine eas appellamus quae juvant actiones
sensus immediatas. Inter sensus autem manifestum est partes primas
tenere Visum, quoad informationem; quare huic sensui praecipue auxilia
conquirenda. Auxilia autem triplicia esse posse videntur: vel ut
percipiat non visa; vel ut majore intervallo; vel ut exactius et
distinctius.</p>
<p>Primi generis sunt (missis bis-oculis et hujusmodi, quae valent
tantum ad corrigendam et levandam infirmitatem visus non bene dispositi,
atque ideo nihil amplius informant) ea quae nuper inventa sunt
perspicilla; quae latentes et invisibiles corporum minutias, et occultos
schematismos et motus (aucta insigniter specierum magnitudine)
demonstrant; quorum vi, in pulice, musca, vermiculis, accurata corporis
figura et lineamenta, necnon colores et motus prius non conspicui, non
sine admiratione cernuntur. Quinetiam aiunt lineam rectam calamo vel
penecillo descriptam, per hujusmodi perspicilla inaequalem admodum et
tortuosam cerni: quia scilicet nec motus manus, licet per regulam
adjutae, nec impressio atramenti aut coloris revera aequalia existant;
licet illae inaequalitates tam minutae sint ut sine adjumento hujusmodi
perspicillorum conspici nequeant. Etiam superstitiosam quandam
observationem in hac re (ut fit in rebus novis et miris) addiderunt
homines: viz. quod hujusmodi perspicilla opera naturae illustrent, artis
dehonestent. Illud vero nihil aliud est quam quod texturae naturales
multo subtiliores sint quam artificiosae. Perspicillum enim illud ad
minuta tantum valet: quale perspicillum si vidisset Democritus,
exiluisset forte, et modum videndi atomum (quem ille invisibilem omnino
affirmavit) inventum fuisse putasset. Verum incompetentia hujusmodi
perspicillorum, praeterquam ad minutias tantum (neque ad ipsas quoque,
si fuerint in corpore majusculo), usum rei destruit. Si enim inventum
extendi posset ad corpora majora, aut corporum majorum minutias, adeo ut
textura panni lintei conspici posset tanquam rete, atque hoc modo
minutiae latentes et inaequalitates gemmarum, liquorum, urinarum,
sanguinis, vulnerum, et multarum aliarum rerum, cerni possent, magnae
proculdubio ex eo invento commoditates capi possent.</p>
<p>Secundi generis sunt illa altera perspicilla quae memorabili conatu
adinvenit Galilaeus; quorum ope, tanquam per scaphas aut naviculas,
aperiri et exerceri possint propiora cum coelestibus commercia. Hinc
enim constat, galaxiam esse nodum sive coacervationem stellarum
parvarum, plane numeratarum et distinctarum; de qua re apud antiquos
tantum suspicio fuit. Hinc demonstrari videtur, quod spatia orbium (quos
vocant) planetarum non sint plane vacua aliis stellis, sed quod coelum
incipiat stellescere antequam ad coelum ipsum stellatum ventum sit;
licet stellis minoribus quam ut sine perspicillis istis conspici
possint. Hinc choreas illas stellarum parvarum circa planetam Jovis
(unde conjici possit esse in motibus stellarum plura centra) intueri
licet. Hinc inaequalitates luminosi et opaci in luna distinctius
cernuntur et locantur; adeo ut fieri possit quaedam seleno-graphia. Hinc
maculae in sole, et id genus: omnia certe inventa nobilia, quatenus
fides hujusmodi demonstrationibus tuto adhiberi possit. Quae nobis ob
hoc maxime suspectae sunt, quod in istis paucis sistatur experimentum,
neque alia complura investigatu aeque digna eadem ratione inventa
sint.</p>
<p>Tertii generis sunt bacilla illa ad terras mensurandas, astrolabia,
et similia; quae sensum videndi non ampliant, sed rectificant et
dirigunt. Quod si sint aliae instantiae quae reliquos sensus juvent in
ipsorum actionibus immediatis et individuis, tamen si ejusmodi sint quae
informationi ipsi nihil addant plus quam jam habetur, ad id quod nunc
agitur non faciunt. Itaque earum mentionem non fecimus.</p>
<ol start="40" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo septimo
Instantias Citantes, sumpto vocabulo a foris civilibus, quia citant ea
ut compareant quae prius non comparuerunt; quas etiam Instantias
Evocantes appellare consuevimus. Eae deducunt non-sensibile ad
sensibile.</p>
<p>Sensum autem fugiunt res, vel propter distantiam objecti locati; vel
propter interceptionem sensus per corpora media; vel quia objectum non
est habile ad impressionem in sensu faciendam; vel quia deficit quantum
in objecto pro feriendo sensu; vel quia tempus non est proportionatum ad
actuandum sensum; vel quia objecti percussio non toleratur a sensu; vel
quia objectum ante implevit et possedit sensum, ut novo motui non sit
locus. Atque haec praecipue ad visum pertinent, et deinde ad tactum. Nam
hi duo sensus sunt informativi ad largum, atque de communibus objectis;
ubi reliqui tres non informent fere, nisi immediate et de propriis
objectis.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In primo genere non fit deductio ad sensibile, nisi rei, quae
cerni non possit propter distantiam, adjiciatur aut substituatur alia
res quae sensum magis e longinquo provocare et ferire possit: veluti in
significatione rerum per ignes, campanas, et similia.</p></li>
<li><p>In secundo genere fit deductio, cum ea quae interius propter
interpositionem corporum latent, nec commode aperiri possunt, per ea
quae sunt in superficie, aut ab interioribus effluunt, perducuntur ad
sensum: ut status humanorum corporum per pulsus, et urinas, et
similia.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3 and 4. At tertii et quarti generis deductiones ad plurima spectant,
atque undique in rerum inquisitione sunt conquirendae. Hujus rei exempla
sunt. Patet quod aer, et spiritus, et hujusmodi res quae sunt toto
corpore tenues et subtiles, nec cerni nec tangi possint. Quare in
inquisitione circa hujusmodi corpora deductionibus omnino est opus.</p>
<p>Sit itaque natura inquisita Actio et Motus Spiritus qui includitur in
corporibus tangibilibus. Omne enim tangibile apud nos continet spiritum
invisibilem et intactilem, eique obducitur atque eum quasi vestit. Hinc
fons triplex potens ille et mirabilis processus spiritus in corpore
tangibili. Spiritus enim in re tangibili, emissus, corpora contrahit et
desiccat; detentus, corpora intenerat et colliquat; nec prorsus emissus
nec prorsus detentus, informat, membrificat, assimilat, egerit,
organizat, et similia. Atque haec omnia deducuntur ad sensibile per
effectus conspicuos.</p>
<p>Etenim in omni corpore tangibili inanimato, spiritus inclusus primo
multiplicat se, et tanquam depascit partes tangibiles eas quae sunt
maxime ad hoc faciles et praeparatae, easque digerit et conficit et
vertit in spiritum, et deinde una evolant. Atque haec confectio et
multiplicatio spiritus deducitur ad sensum per diminutionem ponderis. In
omni enim desiccatione, aliquid defluit de quanto; neque id ipsum ex
spiritu tantum praeinexistente, sed ex corpore quod prius fuit tangibile
et noviter versum est: spiritus enim non ponderat. Egressus autem sive
emissio spiritus deducitur ad sensibile in rubigine metallorum, et aliis
putrefactionibus ejus generis quae sistunt se antequam pervenerint ad
rudimenta vitae; nam illae ad tertium genus processus pertinent. Etenim
in corporibus magis compactis spiritus non invenit poros et meatus per
quos evolet: itaque cogitur partes ipsas tangibiles protrudere et ante
se agere, ita ut illae simul exeant; atque inde fit rubigo, et similia.
At contractio partium tangibilium, postquam aliquid de spiritu fuerit
emissum (unde sequitur illa desiccatio), deducitur ad sensibile tum per
ipsam duritiem rei auctam, tum multo magis per scissuras,
angustiationes, corrugationes, et complicationes corporum, quae inde
sequuntur. Etenim partes ligni desiliunt et angustiantur; pelles
currugantur; neque id solum, sed (si subita fuerit emissio spiritus per
calorem ignis) tantum properant ad contractionem ut se complicent et
convolvant.</p>
<p>At contra, ubi spiritus detinetur, et tamen dilatatur et excitatur
per calorem aut ejus analoga (id quod fit in corporibus magis solidis
aut tenacibus), tum vero corpora emolliuntur, ut ferrum candens; fluunt,
ut metalla; liquefiunt, ut gummi, cera, et similia. Itaque contrariae
illae operationes caloris (ut ex eo alia durescant, alia liquescant)
facile conciliantur; quia in illis spiritus emittitur, in his agitatur
et detinetur: quorum posterius est actio propria caloris et spiritus;
prius, actio partium tangibilium tantum per occasionem spiritus
emissi.</p>
<p>Ast ubi spiritus nec detinetur prorsus nec prorsus emittitur, sed
tantum inter claustra sua tentat et experitur, atque nacta est partes
tangibiles obedientes et sequaces in promptu, ita ut quo spiritus agit
eae simul sequantur; tum vero sequitur efformatio in corpus organicum,
et membrificatio, et reliquae actiones vitales, tam in vegetabilibus
quam in animalibus. Atque haec maxime deducuntur ad sensum per
notationes diligentes primorum incoeptuum et rudimentorum sive
tentamentorum vitae in animalculis ex putrefactione natis: ut in ovis
formicarum, vermibus, muscis, ranis post imbrem, etc. Requiritur autem
ad vivificationem et lenitas caloris et lentor corporis; ut spiritus nec
per festinationem erumpat, nec per contumaciam partium coerceatur, quin
potius ad cerae modum illas plicare et effingere possit.</p>
<p>Rursus, differentia illa spiritus, maxime nobilis et ad plurima
pertinens (viz. spiritus abscissi, ramosi simpliciter, ramosi simul et
cellulati; ex quibus prior est spiritus omnium corporum inanimatorum,
secundus vegetabilium, tertius animalium), per plurimas instantias
deductorias tanquam sub oculos ponitur.</p>
<p>Similiter patet, quod subtiliores texturae et schematismi rerum
(licet toto corpore visibilium aut tangibilium) nec cernantur nec
tangantur. Quare in his quoque per deductionem procedit informatio. At
differentia schematismorum maxime radicalis et primaria sumitur ex copia
vel paucitate materiae quae subit idem spatium sive dimensum. Reliqui
enim schematismi (qui referuntur ad dissimilaritates partium, quae in
eodem corpore continentur, et collocationes ac posituras earundem) prae
illo altero sunt secundarii.</p>
<p>Sit itaque natura inquisita Expansio sive Coitio Materiae in
corporibus respective: viz. quantum materiae impleat quantum dimensum in
singulis. Etenim nil verius in natura quam propositio illa gemella, ex
nihilo nihil fieri, neque quicquam in nihilum redigi: verum quantum
ipsum materiae sive summam totalem constare, nec augeri aut minui. Nec
illud minus verum, ex quanto illo materiae sub iisdem spatiis sive
dimensionibus, pro diversitate corporum, plus et minus contineri: ut in
aqua plus, in aere minus; adeo ut si quis asserat aliquod contentum
aquae in par contentum aeris verti posse, idem sit ac si dicat aliquid
posse redigi in nihilum; contra, si quis asserat aliquod contentum aeris
in par contentum aquae verti posse, idem sit ac si dicat aliquid posse
fieri ex nihilo. Atque ex copia ista et paucitate materiae notiones
illae densi et rari, quae varie et promiscue accipiuntur, proprie
abstrahuntur. Assumenda est et assertio illa tertia, etiam satis certa:
quod hoc de quo loquimur plus et minus materiae in corpore hoc vel illo
ad calculos (facta collatione) et proportiones exactas aut exactis
propinquas reduci possit. Veluti si quis dicat inesse in dato contento
auri talem coacervationem materiae, ut opus habeat spiritus vini, ad
tale quantum materiae aequandum, spatio vicies et semel majore quam
implet aurum, non erraverit.</p>
<p>Coacervatio autem materiae et rationes ejus deducuntur ad sensibile
per pondus. Pondus enim respondet copiae materiae, quoad partes rei
tangibilis; spiritus autem, et ejus quantum ex materia, non venit in
computationem per pondus; levat enim pondus potius quam gravat. At nos
hujus rei tabulam fecimus satis accuratam; in qua pondera et spatia
singulorum metallorum, lapidum praecipuorum, lignorum, liquorum,
oleorum, et plurimorum aliorum corporum tam naturalium quam
artificialium, excepimus: rem polychrestam, tam ad lucem informationis
quam ad normam operationis; et quae multas res revelet omnino praeter
expectatum. Neque illud pro minimo habendum est, quod demonstret omnem
varietatem quae in corporibus tangibilibus nobis notis versatur
(intelligimus autem corpora bene unita, nec plane spongiosa et cava et
magna ex parte aere impleta) non ultra rationes partium 21 excedere: tam
finita scilicet est natura, aut saltem illa pars ejus cujus usus ad nos
maxime pertinet.</p>
<p>Etiam diligentiae nostrae esse putavimus, experiri si forte capi
possint rationes corporum non tangibilium sive pneumaticorum, respectu
corporum tangibilium. Id quod tali molitione aggressi sumus. Phialam
vitream accepimus, quae unciam fortasse unam capere possit; parvitate
vasis usi, ut minori cum calore posset fieri evaporatio sequens. Hanc
phialam spiritu vini implevimus fere ad collum; eligentes spiritum vini,
quod per tabulam priorem eum esse ex corporibus tangibilibus (quae bene
unita, nec cava sunt) rarissimum, et minimum continens materiae sub suo
dimenso, observavimus. Deinde pondus aquae cum phiala ipsa exacte
notavimus. Postea vesicam accepimus, quae circa duas pintas contineret.
Ex ea aerem omnem, quoad fieri potuit, expressimus eo usque ut vesicae
ambo latera essent contigua: etiam prius vesicam oleo oblevimus cum
fricatione leni, quo vesica esset clausior: ejus, si qua erat,
porositate oleo obturata. Hanc vesicam circa os phialae, ore phialae
intra os vesicae recepto, fortiter ligavimus; filo parum cerato, ut
melius adhaeresceret arctius ligaret. Tum demum phialam supra carbones
ardentes in foculo collocavimus. At paulo post vapor sive aura spiritus
vini, per calorem dilatati et in pneumaticum versi, vesicam paulatim
sufflavit, eamque universam veli instar undequaque extendit. Id postquam
factum fuit, continuo vitrum ab igne removimus, et super tapetem
posuimus ne frigore disrumperetur; statim quoque in summitate vesicae
foramen fecimus, ne vapor, cessante calore, in liquorem restitutus
resideret, et rationes confunderet. Tum vero vesicam ipsam sustulimus,
et rursus pondus excepimus spiritus vini qui remanebat. Inde quantum
consumptum fuisset in vaporem seu pneumaticum computavimus: et facta
collatione quantum locum sive spatium illud corpus implesset quando
esset spiritus vini in phiala, et rursus quantum spatium impleverit
postquam factum fuisset pneumaticum in vesica, rationes subduximus: ex
quibus manifeste liquebat, corpus istud ita versum et mutatum
expansionem centuplo majorem quam antea habuisset acquisivisse.</p>
<p>Similiter sit natura inquisita Calor aut Frigus; ejus nempe gradus,
ut a sensu non percipiantur ob debilitatem. Haec deducuntur ad sensum
per vitrum calendare, quale superius descripsimus. Calor enim et frigus,
ipsa non percipiuntur ad tactum; at calor aerem expandit, frigus
contrahit. Neque rursus illa expansio et contractio aeris percipitur ad
visum; at aer ille expansus aquam deprimit, contractus attollit; ac tum
demum fit deductio ad visum, non ante, aut alias.</p>
<p>Similiter sit natura inquisita Mistura Corporum: viz. quid habeant ex
aqueo, quid ex oleoso, quid ex spiritu, quid ex cinere et salibus, et
hujusmodi; vel etiam (in particulari) quid habeat lac butyri, quid
coaguli, quid seri, et hujusmodi. Haec deducuntur ad sensum per
artificiosas et peritas separationes, quatenus ad tangibilia. At natura
spiritus in ipsis, licet immediate non percipiatur, tamen deprehenditur
per varios motus et nixus corporum tangibilium in ipso actu et processu
separationis suae; atque etiam per acrimonias, corrosiones, et diversos
colores, odores, et sapores eorundem corporum post separationem. Atque
in hac parte, per distillationes atque artificiosas separationes,
strenue sane ab hominibus elaboratum est; sed non multo foelicius quam
in caeteris experimentis, quae adhuc in usu sunt: modis nimirum prorsus
palpatoriis, et viis caecis, et magis operose quam intelligenter; et
(quod pessimum est) nulla cum imitatione aut aut aemulatione naturae,
sed cum destructione (per calores vehementes aut virtutes nimis validas)
omnis subtilioris schematismi, in quo occultae rerum virtutes et
consensus praecipue sitae sunt. Neque illud etiam, quod alias monuimus,
hominibus in mentem aut observationem venire solet in hujusmodi
separationibus: hoc est, plurimas qualitates, in corporum vexationibus
tam per ignem quam alios modos, indi ab ipso igne iisque corporibus quae
ad separationem adhibentur, quae in composito prius non fuerunt; unde
mirae fallaciae. Neque enim scilicet vapor universus, qui ex aqua
emittitur per ignem, vapor aut aer antea fuit in corpore aquae; sed
factus est maxima ex parte per dilatationem aquae ex calore ignis.</p>
<p>Similiter in genere omnes exquisitae probationes corporum sive
naturalium sive artificialium, per quas vera dignoscuntur ab
adulterinis, meliora a vilioribus, huc referri debent: deducunt enim
non-sensibile ad sensibile. Sunt itaque diligenti cura undique
conquirendae.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Quintum vero genus latitantiae quod attinet, manifestum est
actionem sensus transigi in motu, motum in tempore. Si igitur motus
alicujus corporis sit vel tam tardus, vel tam velox, ut non sit
proportionatus ad momenta in quibus transigitur actio sensus, objectum
omnino non percipitur; ut in motu indicis horologii, et rursus in motu
pilae sclopeti. Atque motus qui ob tarditatem non percipitur, facile et
ordinario deducitur ad sensum per summas motus; qui vero ob velocitatem,
adhuc non bene mensurari consuevit; sed tamen postulat inquisitio
naturae ut hoc fiat in aliquibus.</p></li>
<li><p>Sextum autem genus, ubi impeditur sensus propter nobilitatem
objecti, recipit deductionem, vel per elongationem majorem objecti a
sensu; vel per hebetationem objecti per interpositionem medii talis,
quod objectum debilitet, non annihilet; vel per admissionem et
exceptionem objecti reflexi, ubi percussio directa sit nimis fortis, ut
solis in pelvi aquae.</p></li>
<li><p>Septimum autem genus latitantiae, ubi sensus ita oneratur objecto
ut novae admissioni non sit locus, non habet fere locum nisi in olfactu
et odoribus; nec ad id quod agitur multum pertinet. Quare de
deductionibus non-sensibilis ad sensibile, haec dicta sint.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Quandoque tamen deductio fit non ad sensum hominis, sed ad sensum
alicujus alterius animalis cujus sensus in aliquibus humanum excellet:
ut nonnullorum odorum, ad sensum canis; lucis, quae in aere non
extrinsecus illuminato latenter existit, ad sensum felis, noctuae, et
hujusmodi animalium quae cernunt noctu. Recte enim notavit Telesius,
etiam in aere ipso inesse lucem quandam originalem, licet exilem et
tenuem, et maxima ex parte oculis hominum aut plurimorum animalium non
inservientem; qui illa animalia, ad quorum sensum hujusmodi lux est
proportionata, cernant noctu; id quod vel sine luce fieri, vel per lucem
internam, minus credibile est.</p>
<p>Atque illud utique notandum est, de destitutionibus sensuum eorumque
remediis hic nos tractare. Nam fallaciae sensuum ad proprias
inquisitiones de sensu et sensibili remittendae sunt: excepta illa magna
fallacia sensuum nimirum quod constituant lineas rerum ex analogia
hominis, et non ex analogia universi; quae non corrigitur nisi per
rationem et philosophiam universalem.</p>

<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo octavo
Instantias Viae, quas etiam Instantias Itinerantes et Instantias
Articulatas appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt quae indicant naturae motus
gradatim continuatos. Hoc autem genus instantiarum potius fugit
observationem quam sensum. Mira enim est hominum circa hanc rem
indiligentia. Contemplantur siquidem naturam tantummodo desultorie et
per periodos, et postquam corpora fuerint absoluta ac completa, et non
in operatione sua. Quod si artificis alicujus ingenia et industriam
explorare et contemplari quis cuperet, is non tantum materias rudes
artis atque deinde opera perfecta conspicere desideraret, sed potius
praesens esse cum artifex operatur et opus suum promovet. Atque simile
quiddam circa naturam faciendum est. Exempli gratia; si quis de
vegetatione plantarum inquirat, ei inspiciendum est ab ipsa satione
seminis alicujus (id quod per extractionem, quasi singulis diebus,
seminum quae per biduum, triduum, quatriduum, et sic deinceps, in terra
manserunt, eorumque diligentem intuitum, facile fieri potest), quomodo
et quando semen intumescere et turgere incipiat et veluti spiritu
impleri; deinde quomodo corticulam rumpere et emittere fibras, cum
latione nonnulla sui interim sursum, nisi terra fuerit admodum contumax;
quomodo etiam emittat fibras, partim radicales deorsum, partim
cauliculares sursum, aliquando serpendo per latera, si ex ea parte
inveniat terram apertam et magis facilem; et complura id genus.
Similiter facere oportet circa exclusionem ovorum; ubi facile conspici
dabitur processus vivificandi et organizandi, et quid et quae partes
fiant ex vitello, quid ex albumine ovi, et alia. Similis est ratio circa
animalia ex putrefactione. Nam circa animalia perfecta et terrestria,
per exectiones foetuum ex utero, minus humanum esset ista inquirere;
nisi forte per occasiones abortuum, et venationum, et similium. Omnino
igitur vigilia quaedam servanda est circa naturam, ut quae melius se
conspiciendam praebeat noctu quam interdiu. Istae enim contemplationes
tanquam nocturnae censeri possint, ob lucernae parvitatem et
perpetuationem.</p>
<p>Quin et in inanimatis idem tentandum est; id quod nos fecimus in
inquirendis aperturis liquorum per ignem. Alius enim est modus aperturae
in aqua, alius in vino, alius in aceto, alius in omphacio; longe alius
in lacte, et oleo, et caeteris. Id quod facile cernere erat per
ebullitionem super ignem lenem, et in vase vitreo, ubi omnia cerni
perspicue possint. Verum haec brevius perstringimus; fusius et exactius
de iis sermones habituri, cum ad inventionem latentis rerum processus
ventum erit. Semper enim memoria tenendum est, nos hoc loco non res
ipsas tractare, sed exempla tantum adducere.</p>
<ol start="42" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo nono Instantias
Supplementi, sive Substitutionis; quas etiam Instantias Perfugii
appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt, quae supplent informationem ubi sensus
plane destituitur; atque idcirco ad eas confugimus cum instantiae
propriae haberi non possint. Dupliciter autem fit substitutio; aut per
Graduationem, aut per Analoga. Exempli gratia: non invenitur medium quod
inhibeat prorsus operationem magnetis in movendo ferrum; non aurum
interpositum, non argentum, non lapis, non vitrum, lignum, aqua, oleum,
pannus aut corpora fibrosa, aer, flamma, et caetera. Attamen per
probationem exactam fortasse inveniri possit aliquod medium, quod
hebetet virtutem ipsius plus quam aliquod aliud, comparative et in
aliquo gradu: veluti quod non trahat magnes ferrum per tantam crassitiem
auri quam per par spatium aeris; aut per tantum argentum ignitum quam
per frigidum; et sic de similibus. Nam de his nos experimentum non
fecimus; sed sufficit tamen ut proponantur loco exempli. Similiter non
invenitur hic apud nos corpus quod non suscipiat calidum igni
approximatum. Attamen longe citius suscipit calorem aer quam lapis.
Atque talis est substitutio quae fit per Gradus.</p>
<p>Substitutio autem per Analoga, utilis sane, sed minus certa est;
atque idcirco cum judicio quodam adhibenda. Ea fit, cum deducitur
non-sensibile ad sensum, non per operationes sensibiles ipsius corporis
insensibilis, sed per contemplationem corporis alicujus cognati
sensibilis. Exempli gratia: si inquiratur de Mistura Spirituum, qui sunt
corpora non-visibilia, videtur esse cognatio quaedam inter corpora et
fomites sive alimenta sua. Fomes autem flammae videtur esse oleum et
pinguia; aeris, aqua et aquea: flammae enim multiplicant se super
halitus olei, aer super vapores aquae. Videndum itaque de mistura aquae
et olei, quae se manifestat ad sensum; quandoquidem mistura aeris et
flammei generis fugiat sensum. At oleum et aqua inter se per
compositionem aut agitationem imperfecte admodum miscentur: eadem in
herbis, et sanguine, et partibus animalium, accurate et delicate
miscentur. Itaque simile quiddam fieri possit circa misturam flammei et
aerei generis in spiritalibus: quae per confusionem simplicem non bene
sustinent misturam, eadem tamen in spiritibus plantarum et animalium
misceri videntur; praesertim cum omnis spiritus animatus depascat humida
utraque, aquea et pinguia, tanquam fomites suos.</p>
<p>Similiter si non de perfectioribus misturis spiritalium, sed de
compositione tantum inquiratur; nempe, utrum facile inter se
incorporentur, an potius (exempli gratia) sint aliqui venti et
exhalationes, aut alia corpora spiritalia, quae non miscentur cum aere
communi, sed tantum haerent et natant in eo, in globulis et guttis, et
potius franguntur ac comminuuntur ab aere quam in ipsum recipiuntur et
incorporantur: hoc in aere communi et aliis spiritalibus, ob
subtilitatem corporum, percipi ad sensum non potest; attamen imago
quaedam hujus rei, quatenus fiat, concipi possit in liquoribus argenti
vivi, olei, aquae; atque etiam in aere, et fractione ejus, quando
dissipatur et ascendit in parvis portiunculis per aquam; atque etiam in
fumis crassioribus; denique in pulvere excitato et haerente in aere; in
quibus omnibus non fit incorporatio. Atque repraesentatio praedicta in
hoc subjecto non mala est, si illud primo diligenter inquisitum fuerit,
utrum possit esse talis heterogenia inter spiritalia qualis invenitur
inter liquida; nam tum demum haec simulacra per Analogiam non incommode
substituentur.</p>
<p>Atque de instantiis istis supplementi, quod diximus informationem ab
iis hauriendam esse, quando desint instantiae propriae, loco perfugii;
nihilominus intelligi volumus, quod illae etiam magni sint usus etiam
cum propriae instantiae adsint; ad roborandam scilicet informationem una
cum propriis. Verum de his exactius dicemus quando ad Adminicula
Inductionis tractanda sermo ordine dilabetur.</p>

<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco vicesimo Instantias
Persecantes; quas etiam Instantias Vellicantes appellare consuevimus,
sed diversa ratione. Vellicantes enim eas appellamus, quia vellicant
intellectum, persecantes, quia persecant naturam: unde etiam illas
quandoque Instantias Democriti nominamus. Eae sunt, quae de admirabili
et exquisita subtilitate naturae intellectum submonent, ut excitetur et
expergiscatur ad attentionem et observationem et inquisitionem debitam.
Exempli gratia: quod parum guttulae atramenti ad tot literas vel lineas
extendatur; quod argentum, exterius tantum inauratum, ad tantam
longitudinem fili inaurati continuetur; quod pusillus vermiculus, qualis
in cute invenitur, habeat in se spiritum simul et figuram dissimilarem

admodum extenuatae) penetrent, quin etiam repercutiantur, idque tam
distincte et velociter; quod lux et color, etiam tanto ambitu et tam
perniciter, per corpora solida vitri, aquae, et cum tanta et tam
exquisita varietate imaginum permeent, etiam refringantur et
reflectantur; quod magnes per corpora omnigena, etiam maxime compacta,
operetur: sed (quod magis mirum est) quod in his omnibus, in medio
adiaphoro (quale est aer) unius actio aliam non magnopere impediat;
nempe quod eodem tempore per spatia aeris devehantur et visibilium tot
imagines, et vocis articulatae tot percussiones, et tot odores
specificati, ut violae, rosae; etiam calor et frigus et virtutes
magneticae; omnia (inquam) simul, uno alterum non impediente, ac si
singula haberent vias et meatus suos proprios separatos, neque unum in
alterum impingeret aut incurreret.</p>
<p>Solemus tamen utiliter hujusmodi instantiis persecantibus subjungere
instantias, quas Metas Persecationis appellare consuevimus; veluti quod
in iis, quae diximus, una actio in diverso genere aliam non perturbet
aut impediat, cum tamen in eodem genere una aliam domet et extinguat:
veluti, lux solis, lucem cicindelae; sonitus bombardae, vocem; fortior
odor, delicatiorem; intensior calor, remissiorem; lamina ferri
interposita inter magnetem et aliud ferrum, operationem magnetis. Verum
de his quoque inter Adminicula Inductionis erit proprius dicendi
locus.</p>

<p>Atque de instantiis quae juvant sensum, jam dictum est; quae
praecipui usus sunt ad Partem Informativam. Informatio enim incipit a
sensu. At universum negotium desinit in Opera; atque quemadmodum illud
principium, ita hoc finis rei est. Sequentur itaque instantiae praecipui
usus ad partem operativam. Eae genere duae sunt, numero septem; quas
universas, generali nomine, Instantias Practicas appellare consuevimus.
Operativae autem partis, vitia duo; totidemque dignitates instantiarum
in genere. Aut enim fallit operatio, aut onerat nimis. Fallit operatio
maxime (praesertim post diligentem naturarum inquisitionem) propter male
determinatas et mensuratas corporum vires et actiones. Vires autem et
actiones corporum circumscribuntur et mensurantur, aut per spatia loci,
aut per momenta temporis, aut per unionem quanti, aut per
praedominantiam virtutis; quae quatuor nisi fuerint probe et diligenter
pensitata, erunt fortasse scientiae speculatione quidem pulchrae, sed
opere inactivae. Instantias vero quatuor itidem, quae huc referuntur,
uno nomine Instantias Mathematicas vocamus, et Instantias Mensurae.</p>
<p>Onerosa autem fit praxis, vel propter misturam rerum inutilium, vel
propter multiplicationem instrumentorum, vel propter molem materiae et
corporum quae ad aliquod opus requiri contigerint. Itaque eae instantiae
in pretio esse debent, quae aut dirigunt operativam ad ea quae maxime
hominum intersunt; aut quae parcunt instrumentis; aut quae parcunt
materiae sive supellectili. Eas autem tres instantias quae huc
pertinent, uno nomine Instantias Propitias sive Benevolas vocamus.
Itaque de his septem instantiis jam sigillatim dicemus; atque cum iis
partem illam de Praerogativis sive Dignitatibus Instantiarum
claudemus.</p>
<ol start="45" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco vicesimo primo
Instantias Virgae, sive Radii; quas etiam Instantias Perlationis, vel de
Non Ultra appellare consuevimus. Virtutes enim rerum et motus operantur
et expediuntur per spatia non indefinita aut fortuita, sed finita et
certa; quae ut in singulis naturis inquisitis teneantur et notentur
plurimum interest practicae, non solum ad hoc, ut non fallat, sed etiam
ut magis sit aucta et potens. Etenim interdum datur virtutes producere,
et distantias tanquam retrahere in propius; ut in perspecillis.</p>
<p>Atque plurimae virtutes operantur et afficiunt tantum per tactum
manifestum; ut fit in percussione corporum, ubi alterum non summovet
alterum, nisi impellens impulsum tangat. Etiam medicinae quae exterius
applicantur, ut unguenta, emplastra, non exercent vires suas nisi per
tactum corporis. Denique objecta sensuum tactus et gustus non feriunt
nisi contigua organis.</p>
<p>Sunt et aliae virtutes quae operantur ad distantiam, verum valde
exiguam, quarum paucae adhuc notatae sunt, cum tamen plures sint quam
homines suspicentur: ut (capiendo exempla ex vulgatis) cum succinum aut
gagates trahunt paleas; bullae approximatae solvunt bullas; medicinae
nonnullae purgativae eliciunt humores ex alto, et hujusmodi. At virtus
illa magnetica per quam ferrum et magnes, vel magnetes invicem, coeunt,
operatur intra orbem virtutis certum, sed parvum; ubi contra, si sit
aliqua virtus magnetica emanans ab ipsa terra (paulo nimirum interiore)
super acum ferream, quatenus ad verticitatem, operatio fiat ad
distantiam magnam.</p>
<p>Rursus, si sit aliqua vis magnetica quae operetur per consensum inter
globum terrae et ponderosa, aut inter globum lunae et aquas maris (quae
maxime credibilis videtur in fluxibus et refluxibus semi-menstruis), aut
inter coelum stellatum et planetas, per quam evocentur et attollantur ad
sua apogaea; haec omnia operantur ad distantias admodum longinquas.
Inveniuntur et quaedam inflammationes sive conceptiones flammae, quae
fiunt ad distantias bene magnas, in aliquibus materiis; ut referunt de
naphtha Babylonica. Calores etiam insinuant se per distantias amplas,
quod etiam faciunt frigora; adeo ut habitantibus circa Canadam moles
sive massae glaciales, quae abrumpuntur et natant per oceanum
septentrionalem et deferuntur per Atlanticum versus illas oras,
percipiantur et incutiant frigora e longinquo. Odores quoque (licet in
his videatur semper esse quaedam emissio corporea) operantur ad
distantias notabiles; ut evenire solet navigantibus juxta litora
Floridae, aut etiam nonnulla Hispaniae, ubi sunt sylvae totae ex
arboribus limonum, arantiorum, et hujusmodi plantarum odoratarum, aut
frutices rorismarini, majoranae, et similium. Postremo radiationes lucis
et impressiones sonorum operantur scilicet ad distantias spatiosas.</p>
<p>Verum haec omnia, utcunque operentur ad distantias parvas sive
magnas, operantur certe ad finitas et naturae notas, ut sit quiddam Non
Ultra: idque pro rationibus, aut molis seu quanti corporum; aut vigoris
et debilitatis virtutum; aut favoribus et impedimentis mediorum; quae
omnia in computationem venire et notari debent. Quinetiam mensurae
motuum violentorum (quos vocant), ut missilium, tormentorum, rotarum, et
similium, cum hae quoque manifesto suos habeant limites certos, notandae
sunt.</p>
<p>Inveniuntur etiam quidam motus et virtutes contrariae illis, quae
operantur per tactum et non ad distans; quae operantur scilicet ad
distans et non ad tactum; et rursus, quae operantur remissius ad
distantiam minorem et fortius ad distantiam majorem. Etenim visio non
bene transigitur ad tactum, sed indiget medio et distantia. Licet
meminerim me audisse ex relatione cujusdam fide digni, quod ipse in
curandis oculorum suorum cataractis (erat autem cura talis, ut
immitteretur festuca quaedam parva argentea intra primam oculi tunicam,
quae pelliculam illam cataractae removeret et truderet in angulum oculi)
clarissime vidisset festucam illam supra ipsam pupillam moventem. Quod
utcunque verum esse possit, manifestum est majora corpora non bene aut
distincte cerni nisi in cuspide coni, coeuntibus radiis objecti ad
nonnullam distantiam. Quin etiam in senibus oculus melius cernit remoto
objecto paulo longius, quam propius. In missilibus autem certum est
percussionem non fieri tam fortem ad distantiam nimis parvam, quam paulo
post. Haec itaque et similia in mensuris motuum quoad distantias notanda
sunt.</p>
<p>Est et aliud genus mensurae localis motuum, quod non praetermittendum
est. Illud vero pertinet ad motus non progressivos, sed sphaericos; hoc
est, ad expansionem corporum in majorem sphaeram, aut contractionem in
minorem. Inquirendum enim est inter mensuras istas motuum, quantam
compressionem aut extensionem corpora (pro natura ipsorum) facile et
libenter patiantur, et ad quem terminum reluctari incipiant, adeo ut ad
extremum Non Ultra ferant; ut cum vesica inflata comprimitur, sustinet
illa compressionem nonnullam aeris, sed si major fuerit, non patitur
aer, sed rumpitur vesica.</p>
<p>At nos hoc ipsum subtiliore experimento magis exacte probavimus.
Accepimus enim campanulam ex metallo, leviorem scilicet et tenuiorem,
quali ad excipiendum salem utimur; eamque in pelvim aquae immisimus, ita
ut deportaret secum aerem qui continebatur in concavo usque ad fundum
pelvis. Locaveramus autem prius globulum in fundo pelvis, super quem
campanula imponenda esset. Quare illud eveniebat, ut si globulus ille
esset minusculus (pro ratione concavi), reciperet se aer in locum
minorem, et contruderetur solum, non extruderetur. Quod si grandioris
esset magnitudinis quam ut aer libenter cederet, tum aer majoris
pressurae impatiens campanulam ex aliqua parte elevabat, et in bullis
ascendebat.</p>
<p>Etiam ad probandum qualem extensionem (non minus quam compressionem)
pateretur aer, tale quippiam practicavimus. Ovum vitreum accepimus, cum
parvo foramine in uno extremo ovi. Aerem per foramen exuctione forti
attraximus, et statim digito foramen illud obturavimus, et ovum in aquam
immersimus, et dein digitum removimus. Aer vero tensura illa per
exuctionem facta tortus et magis quam pro natura sua dilatatus, ideoque
se recipere et contrahere nitens (ita ut si ovum illud in aquam non
fuisset immersum, aerem ipsum traxisset cum sibilo), aquam traxit ad
tale quantum quale sufficere posset ad hoc, ut aer antiquam recuperaret
sphaeram sive dimensionem.</p>
<p>Atque certum est corpora tenuiora (quale est aer) pati contractionem
nonnullam notabilem, ut dictum est; at corpora tangibilia (quale est
aqua) multo aegrius et ad minus spatium patiuntur compressionem. Qualem
autem patiatur, tali experimento inquisivimus.</p>
<p>Fieri fecimus globum ex plumbo cavum, qui duas circiter pintas
vinarias contineret; eumque satis per latera crassum, ut majorem vim
sustineret. In illum aquam immisimus, per foramen alicubi factum; atque
foramen illud, postquam globus aqua impletus fuisset, plumbo liquefacto
obturavimus, ut globus deveniret plane consolidatus. Dein globum forti
malleo ad duo latera adversa complanavimus; ex quo necesse fuit aquam in
minus contrahi, cum sphaera figurarum sit capacissima. Deinde, cum
malleatio non amplius sufficeret, aegrius se recipiente aqua, molendino
seu torculari usi sumus; ut tandem aqua, impatiens pressurae ulterioris,
per solida plumbi (instar roris delicati) exstillaret. Postea, quantum
spatii per eam compressionem imminutum foret computavimus; atque tantam
compressionem passam esse aquam (sed violentia magna subactam)
intelleximus.</p>
<p>At solidiora, sicca, aut magis compacta, qualia sunt lapides et
ligna, necnon metalla, multo adhuc minorem compressionem aut
extensionem, et fere imperceptibilem ferunt; sed vel fractione, vel
progressione, vel aliis pertentationibus se liberant: ut in
curvationibus ligni aut metalli, horologiis moventibus per
complicationem laminae, missilibus, malleationibus, et innumeris aliis
motibus apparet. Atque haec omnia cum mensuris suis in indagatione
naturae notanda et exploranda sunt, aut in certitudine sua, aut per
aestimativas, aut per comparativas, prout dabitur copia.</p>
<ol start="46" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco vicesimo secundo
Instantias Curriculi, quas etiam Instantias ad Aquam appellare
consuevimus; sumpto vocabulo a clepsydris apud antiquos, in quas
infundebatur aqua, loco arenae. Eae mensurant naturam per momenta
temporis, quemadmodum Instantiae Virgae per gradus spatii. Omnis enim
motus sive actio naturalis transigitur in tempore; alius velocius, alius
tardius, sed utcunque momentis certis et naturae notis. Etiam illae
actiones quae subito videntur operari, et in ictu oculi (ut loquimur),
deprehenduntur recipere majus et minus quoad tempus.</p>
<p>Primo itaque videmus restitutiones corporum coelestium fieri per
tempora numerata; etiam fluxus et refluxus maris. Latio autem gravium
versus terram et levium versus ambitum coeli fit per certa momenta, pro
ratione corporis quod fertur, et medii. At velificationes navium, motus
animalium, perlationes missilium, omnes fiunt itidem per tempora
(quantum ad summas) numerabilia. Calorem vero quod attinet, videmus
pueros per hyemem manus in flamma lavare, nec tamen uri; et joculatores
vasa plena vino vel aqua, per motus agiles et aequales, vertere deorsum
et sursum recuperare, non effuso liquore; et multa hujusmodi. Nec minus
ipsae compressiones et dilatationes et eruptiones corporum fiunt, aliae
velocius, aliae tardius, pro natura corporis et motus, sed per momenta
certa. Quinetiam in explosione plurium bombardarum simul, quae
exaudiuntur quandoque ad distantiam triginta milliarium, percipitur
sonus prius ab iis qui prope absunt a loco ubi fit sonitus, quam ab iis
qui longe. At in visu (cujus actio est pernicissima) liquet etiam
requiri ad eum actuandum momenta certa temporis: idque probatur ex iis
quae propter motus velocitatem non cernuntur; ut ex latione pilae ex
sclopeto. Velocior enim est praetervolatio pilae quam impressio speciei
ejus quae deferri poterat ad visum.</p>
<p>Atque hoc, cum similibus, nobis quandoque dubitationem peperit plane
monstrosam: videlicet, utrum coeli sereni et stellati facies ad idem
tempus cernatur quando vere existit, an potius aliquanto post; et utrum
non sit (quatenus ad visum coelestium) non minus tempus verum et tempus
visum, quam locus verus et locus visus, qui notatur ab astronomis in
parallaxibus. Adeo incredibile nobis videbatur, species sive radios
corporum coelestium per tam immensa spatia milliarium subito deferri
posse ad visum; sed potius debere eas in tempore aliquo notabili delabi.
Verum illa dubitatio (quoad majus aliquod intervallum temporis inter
tempus verum et visum) postea plane evanuit: reputantibus nobis jacturam
illam infinitam et diminutionem quanti, quatenus ad apparentiam, inter
corpus stellae verum et speciem visam, quae causatur a distantia; atque
simul notantibus ad quantam distantiam (sexaginta scilicet ad minimum
milliariorum) corpora, eaque tantum albicantia, subito hic apud nos
cernantur; cum dubium non sit lucem coelestium, non tantum albedinis
vividum colorem, verum etiam omnis flammae (quae apud nos nota est)
lucem, quoad vigorem radiationis, multis partibus excedere. Etiam
immensa illa velocitas in ipso corpore, quae cernitur in motu diurno
(quae etiam viros graves ita obstupefecit ut mallent credere motum
terrae), facit motum illum ejaculationis radiorum ab ipsis (licet
celeritate, ut diximus, mirabilem) magis credibilem. Maxime vero omnium
nos movit, quod si interponeretur intervallum temporis aliquod notabile
inter veritatem et visum, foret ut species per nubes interim orientes et
similes medii perturbationes interciperentur saepenumero, et
confunderentur. Atque de mensuris temporum simplicibus haec dicta
sint.</p>
<p>Verum non solum quaerenda est mensura motuum et actionum simpliciter,
sed multo magis comparative: id enim eximii est usus, et ad plurima
spectat. Atque videmus flammam alicujus tormenti ignei citius cerni,
quam sonitus audiatur; licet necesse sit pilam prius aerem percutere,
quam flamma quae pone erat exire potuerit; fieri hoc autem propter
velociorem transactionem motus lucis, quam soni. Videmus etiam species
visibiles a visu citius excipi quam dimitti; unde fit quod nervi fidium,
digito impulsi, duplicentur aut triplicentur quoad speciem, quia species
nova recipitur, antequam prior demittatur; ex quo etiam fit, ut annuli
rotati videantur globosi, et fax ardens, noctu velociter portata,
conspiciatur caudata. Etiam ex hoc fundamento inaequalitatis motuum
quoad velocitatem, excogitavit Galilaeus causam fluxus et refluxus
maris; rotante terra velocius, aquis tardius; ideoque accumulantibus se
aquis in sursum, et deinde per vices se remittentibus in deorsum, ut
demonstratur in vase aquae incitatius movente. Sed hoc commentus est
concesso non concessibili (quod terra nempe moveatur), ac etiam non bene
informatus de oceani motu sexhorario.</p>
<p>At exemplum hujus rei de qua agitur, videlicet, de comparativis
mensuris motuum, neque solum rei ipsius, sed et usus insignis ejus (de
quo paulo ante loquuti sumus), eminet in cuniculis subterraneis, in
quibus collocatur pulvis pyrius; ubi immensae moles terrae,
aedificiorum, et similium, subvertuntur, et in altum jaciuntur, a
pusilla quantitate pulveris pyrii. Cujus causa pro certo illa est, quod
motus dilatationis pulveris, qui impellit, multis partibus sit
pernicior, quam motus gravitatis per quem fieri possit aliqua
resistentia; adeo ut primus motus perfunctus sit, antequam motus
adversus inceperit; ut in principiis nullitas quaedam sit resistentiae.
Hinc etiam fit, quod in omni missili, ictus, non tam robustus quam
acutus et celer, ad perlationem potissimum valeat. Neque etiam fieri
potuisset, ut parva quantitas spiritus animalis in animalibus,
praesertim in tam vastis corporibus qualia sunt balaenae aut elephanti,
tantam molem corpoream flecteret et regeret, nisi propter velocitatem
motus spiritus, et hebetudinem corporeae molis, quatenus ad expediendam
suam resistentiam.</p>
<p>Denique, hoc unum ex praecipuis fundamentis est experimentorum
magicorum, de quibus mox dicemus; ubi scilicet parva moles materiae
longe majorem superat et in ordinem redigit: hoc, inquam, si fieri
possit anteversio motuum per velocitatem unius, antequam alter se
expediat.</p>
<p>Postremo, hoc ipsum Prius et Posterius in omni actione naturali
notari debet; veluti quod in infusione rhabarbari eliciatur purgativa
vis prius, astrictiva post; simile quiddam etiam in infusione violarum
in acetum experti sumus; ubi primo excipitur suavis et delicatus floris
odor; post, pars floris magis terrea, quae odorem confundit. Itaque si
infundantur violae per diem integrum, odor multo languidius excipitur:
quod si infundantur per partem quartam horae tantum, et extrahantur; et
(quia paucus est spiritus odoratus qui subsistit in viola) infundantur
post singulas quartas horae violae novae et recentes ad sexies; tum
demum nobilitatur infusio, ita ut licet non manserint violae, utcunque
renovatae, plus quam ad sesquihoram, tamen permanserit odor gratissimus,
et viola ipsa non inferior, ad annum integrum. Notandum tamen est, quod
non se colligat odor ad vires suas plenas, nisi post mensem ab
infusione. In distillationibus vero aromatum maceratorum in spiritu vini
patet quod surgat primo phlegma aqueum et inutile, deinde aqua plus
habens ex spiritu vini, deinde post aqua plus habens ex aromate. Atque
hujus generis quamplurima inveniuntur in distillationibus notatu digna.
Verum haec sufficiant ad exempla.</p>

</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco vicesimo tertio
Instantias Quanti, quas etiam Doses Naturae (sumpto vocabulo a
Medicinis) vocare consuevimus. Eae sunt quae mensurant virtutes per
Quanta corporum, et indicant quid Quantum Corporis faciat ad Modum
Virtutis. Ac primo sunt quaedam virtutes quae non subsistunt nisi in
quanto cosmico, hoc est, tali quanto quod habeat consensum cum
configuratione et fabrica universi. Terra enim stat; partes ejus cadunt.
Aquae in maribus fluunt et refluunt; in fluviis minime, nisi per
ingressum maris. Deinde etiam omnes fere virtutes particulares secundum
multum aut parvum corporis operantur. Aquae largae non facile
corrumpuntur; exiguae cito. Mustum et cervisia maturescunt longe citius,
et fiunt potabilia, in utribus parvis, quam in doliis magnis. Si herba
ponatur in majore portione liquoris, fit infusio, magis quam imbibitio;
si in minore, fit imbibitio, magis quam infusio. Aliud igitur erga
corpus humanum est balneum, aliud levis irroratio. Etiam parvi rores in
aere nunquam cadunt, sed dissipantur et cum aere incorporantur. Et
videre est in anhelitu super gemmas, parum illud humoris, quasi
nubeculam vento dissipatam, continuo solvi. Etiam frustum ejusdem
magnetis non trahit tantum ferri, quantum magnes integer. Sunt etiam
virtutes in quibus parvitas quanti magis potest; ut in penetrationibus,
stylus acutus citius penetrat, quam obtusus; adamas punctuatus sculpit
in vitro; et similia.</p>
<p>Verum non hic morandum est in indefinitis, sed etiam de rationibus
quanti corporis erga modum virtutis inquirendum. Proclive enim foret
credere, quod rationes quanti rationes virtutis adaequarent; ut si pila
plumbea unius unciae caderet in tali tempore, pila unciarum duarum
deberet cadere duplo celerius, quod falsissimum est. Nec eaedem rationes
in omni genere virtutum valent, sed longe diversae. Itaque hae mensurae
ex rebus ipsis petendae sunt, et non ex verisimilitudine aut
conjecturis.</p>
<p>Denique in omni inquisitione naturae Quantum corporis requiratur ad
aliquod effectum, tanquam dosis, notandum; et cautiones de Nimis et
Parum aspergendae.</p>
<ol start="48" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco vicesimo quarto
Instantias Luctae; quas etiam Instantias Praedominantiae appellare
consuevimus. Eae indicant praedominantiam et cessionem virtutum ad
invicem; et quae ex illis sit fortior et vincat, quae infirmior et
succumbat. Sunt enim motus et nixus corporum compositi, decompositi, et
complicati, non minus quam corpora ipsa. Proponemus igitur primum
species praecipuas motuum sive virtutum activarum; ut magis perspicua
sit ipsarum comparatio in robore, et exinde demonstratio atque
designatio instantiarum luctae et praedominantiae.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Motus Primus sit Motus Antitypiae materiae, quae inest in
singulis portionibus ejus; per quem plane annihilari non vult: ita ut
nullum incendium, nullum pondus aut depressio, nulla violentia, nulla
denique aetas aut diuturnitas temporis possit redigere aliquam vel
minimam portionem materiae in nihilum; quin illa et sit aliquid, et loci
aliquid occupet, et se (in qualicunque necessitate ponatur), vel formam
mutando vel locum, liberet, vel (si non detur copia) ut est subsistat;
neque unquam res eo deveniat, ut aut nihil sit, aut nullibi. Quem motum
Schola (quae semper fere et denominat et definit res potius per effectus
et incommoda quam per causas interiores) vel denotat per illud axioma,
quod Duo corpora non possint esse in uno loco; vel vocat motum Ne fiat
penetratio dimensionum. Neque hujus motus exempla proponi consentaneum
est: inest enim omni corpori.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Secundus, Motus (quem appellamus) Nexus; per quem
corpora non patiuntur se ulla ex parte sui dirimi a contactu alterius
corporis, ut quae mutuo nexu et contactu gaudeant. Quem motum Schola
vocat Motum Ne detur vacuum: veluti cum aqua attrahitur sursum
exuctione, aut per fistulas; caro per ventosas; aut cum aqua sistitur
nec effluit in hydriis perforatis, nisi os hydriae ad immittendum aerem
aperiatur; et innumera id genus.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Tertius, Motus (quem appellamus) Libertatis; per quem
corpora se liberare nituntur a pressura aut tensura praeter-naturali, et
restituere se in dimensum corpori suo conveniens. Cujus motus etiam
innumera sunt exempla: veluti (quatenus ad liberationem a pressura)
aquae in natando, aeris in volando; aquae in remigando, aeris in
undulationibus ventorum; laminae in horologiis. Nec ineleganter se
ostendit motus aeris compressi in sclopettis ludicris puerorum, cum
alnum aut simile quiddam excavant, et infarciunt frusto alicujus radicis
succulentae, vel similium, ad utrosque fines; deinde per embolum trudunt
radicem vel hujusmodi farcimentum in foramen alterum; unde emittitur et
ejicitur radix cum sonitu ad foramen alterum, idque antequam tangatur a
radice aut farcimento citimo, aut embolo. Quatenus vero ad liberationem
a tensura, ostendit se hic motus in aere post exuctionem in ovis vitreis
remanente, in chordis, in corio, et panno, resilientibus post tensuras
suas, nisi tensurae illae per moram invaluerint, etc. Atque hunc motum
Schola sub nomine Motus ex Forma Elementi innuit: satis quidem inscite,
cum hic motus non tantum ad aerem, aquam, aut flammam pertineat, sed ad
omnem diversitatem consistentiae; ut ligni, ferri, plumbi, panni,
membranae, etc., in quibus singula corpora suae habent dimensionis
modulum, et ab eo aegre ad spatium aliquod notabile abripiuntur. Verum
quia motus iste libertatis omnium est maxime obvius, et ad infinita
spectans, consultum fuerit eum bene et perspicue distinguere. Quidam
enim valde negligenter confundunt hunc motum cum gemino illo motu
antitypiae et nexus; liberationem scilicet a pressura, cum motu
antitypiae; a tensura, cum motu nexus; ac si ideo cederent aut se
dilatarent corpora compressa, ne sequeretur penetratio dimensionum; ideo
resilirent et contraherent se corpora tensa, ne sequeretur vacuum. Atqui
si aer compressus se vellet recipere in densitatem aquae, aut lignum in
densitatem lapidis, nil opus foret penetratione dimensionum; et
nihilominus longe major posset esse compressio illorum, quam illa ullo
modo patiuntur. Eodem modo si aqua se dilatare vellet in raritatem
aeris, aut lapis in raritatem ligni, non opus foret vacuo; et tamen
longe major posset fieri extensio eorum, quam illa ullo modo patiuntur.
Itaque non reducitur res ad penetrationem dimensionum et vacuum, nisi in
ultimitatibus condensationis et rarefactionis; cum tamen isti motus
longe citra eas sistant et versentur, neque aliud sint quam desideria
corporum conservandi se in consistentiis suis (sive, si malint, in
formis suis), nec ab iis recedendi subito, nisi per modos suaves ac per
consensum alterentur. At longe magis necessarium est (quia multa secum
trahit), ut intimetur hominibus, motum violentum (quem nos mechanicum,
Democritus, qui in motibus suis primis expediendis etiam infra mediocres
philosophos ponendus est, motum plagae vocavit) nil aliud esse quam
Motum Libertatis, scilicet a compressione ad relaxationem. Etenim in
omni sive simplici protrusione sive volatu per aerem, non fit summotio
aut latio localis, antequam partes corporis praeter-naturaliter
patiantur et comprimantur ab impellente. Tum vero partibus aliis alias
per successionem trudentibus, fertur totum; nec solum progrediendo, sed
etiam rotando simul; ut etiam hoc modo partes se liberare, aut magis ex
aequo tolerare possint. Atque de hoc motu hactenus.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Quartus, motus cui nomen dedimus Motus Hyles: qui motus
antistrophus est quodammodo Motui, de quo diximus, Libertatis. Etenim in
Motu Libertatis, corpora novum dimensum sive novam sphaeram sive novam
dilatationem aut contractionem (haec enim verborum varietas idem innuit)
exhorrent, respuunt, fugiunt, et resilire ac veterem consistentiam
recuperare totis viribus contendunt. At contra in hoc Motu Hyles,
corpora novam sphaeram sive dimensum appetunt; atque ad illud libenter
et propere, et quandoque valentissimo nixu (ut in pulvere pyrio)
aspirant. Instrumenta autem hujus motus, non sola certe, sed
potentissima, aut saltem frequentissima, sunt calor et frigus. Exempli
gratia: aer, si per tensuram (velut per exuctionem in ovis vitreis)
dilatetur, magno laboret desiderio seipsum restituendi. At admoto
calore, e contra appetit dilatari, et concupiscet novam sphaeram, et
transit et migrat in illam libenter, tanquam in novam formam (ut
loquuntur); nec post dilatationem nonnullam de reditu curat, nisi per
admotionem frigidi ad eam invitetur; quae non reditus est, sed
transmutatio repetita. Eodem modo et aqua, si per compressionem
arctetur, recalcitrat; et vult fieri qualis fuit, scilicet latior. At si
interveniat frigus intensum et continuatum, mutat se sponte sua et
libenter in condensationem glaciei; atque si plane continuetur frigus,
nec a teporibus interrumpatur (ut fit in speluncis et cavernis paulo
profundioribus), vertitur in crystallum aut materiam similem, nec unquam
restituitur.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Quintus, Motus Continuationis. Intelligimus autem non
continuationis simplicis et primariae, cum corpore aliquo altero (nam
ille est Motus Nexus); sed continuationis sui, in corpore certo.
Certissimum enim est, quod corpora omnia solutionem continuitatis
exhorreant; alia magis, alia minus, sed omnia aliquatenus. Nam ut in
corporibus duris (veluti chalybis, vitri) reluctatio contra
discontinuationem est maxime robusta et valida, ita etiam in liquoribus,
ubi cessare aut languere saltem videtur motus ejusmodi, tamen non
prorsus reperitur privatio ejus; sed plane inest ipsis in gradu tanquam
infimo, et prodit se in experimentis plurimis; sicut in bullis, in
rotunditate guttarum, in filis tenuioribus stillicidiorum, et in
sequacitate corporum glutinosorum, et ejusmodi. Sed maxime omnium se
ostendit appetitus iste, si discontinuatio tentetur usque ad fractiones
minores. Nam in mortariis, post contusionem ad certum gradum, non
amplius operatur pistillum; aqua non subintrat rimas minores; quin et
ipse aer, non obstante subtilitate corporis ipsius, poros vasorum paulo
solidiorum non pertransit subito, nec nisi per diuturnam
insinuationem.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Sextus, motus quem nominamus Motum ad Lucrum, sive
Motum Indigentiae. Is est, per quem corpora, quando versantur inter
plane heterogenea et quasi inimica, si forte nanciscantur copiam aut
commoditatem evitandi illa heterogenea et se applicandi ad magis
cognata, (licet illa ipsa cognata talia fuerint quae non habeant arctum
consensum cum ipsis) tamen statim ea amplectuntur, et tanquam potiora
malunt: et lucri loco (unde vocabulum sumpsimus) hoc ponere videntur,
tanquam talium corporum indiga. Exempli gratia: aurum, aut aliud
metallum foliatum non delectatur aere circumfuso. Itaque si corpus
aliquod tangibile et crassum nanciscatur (ut digitum, papyrum, quidvis
aliud), adhaeret statim, nec facile divellitur. Etiam papyrus, aut
pannus, et hujusmodi, non bene se habent cum aere qui inseritur et
commistus est in ipsorum poris. Itaque aquam aut liquorem libenter
imbibunt, et aerem exterminant. Etiam saccharum, aut spongia infusa in
aquam aut vinum, licet pars ipsorum emineat et longe attollatur supra
vinum aut aquam, tamen aquam aut vinum paulatim et per gradus attrahunt
in sursum.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Unde optimus canon sumitur aperturae et solutionum corporum. Missis
enim corrosivis et aquis fortibus, quae viam sibi aperiunt, si possit
inveniri corpus proportionatum et magis consentiens et amicum corpori
alicui solido quam illud cum quo tanquam per necessitatem commiscetur,
statim se aperit et relaxat corpus, et illud alterum intro recipit,
priore excluso aut summoto. Neque operatur aut potest iste motus ad
lucrum solummodo ad tactum. Nam electrica operatio (de qua Gilbertus et
alii post eum tantas excitarunt fabulas) non alia est quam corporis per
fricationem levem excitati appetitus; qui aerem non bene tolerat, sed
aliud tangibile mavult, si reperiatur in propinquo.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Sit motus Septimus, Motus (quem appellamus) Congregationis
Majoris; per quem corpora feruntur ad massas connaturalium suorum:
gravia, ad globum terrae; levia, ad ambitum coeli. Hunc Schola nomine
Motus Naturalis insignivit: levi contemplatione, quia scilicet nil
spectabile erat ab extra quod eum motum cieret (itaque rebus ipsis
innatum atque insitum putavit); aut forte quia non cessat. Nec mirum:
semper enim praesto sunt coelum et terra; cum e contra causae et
origines plurimorum ex reliquis motibus interdum absint, interdum
adsint. Itaque hunc, quia non intermittit sed caeteris intermittentibus
statim occurrit, perpetuum et proprium; reliquos ascititios posuit. Est
autem iste motus revera satis infirmus et hebes, tanquam is qui (nisi
sit moles corporis major) caeteris motibus, quamdiu operantur, cedat et
succumbat. Atque cum hic motus hominum cogitationes ita impleverit ut
fere reliquos motus occultaverit, tamen parum est quod homines de eo
sciunt, sed in multis circa illum erroribus versantur.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Octavus, Motus Congregationis Minoris; per quem partes
homogeneae in corpore aliquo separant se ab heterogeneis, et coeunt
inter sese; per quem etiam corpora integra ex similitudine substantiae
se amplectuntur et fovent, et quandoque ad distantiam aliquam
congregantur, attrahuntur, et conveniunt: veluti cum in lacte flos
lactis post moram aliquam supernatat; in vino faeces et tartarum
subsidunt. Neque enim haec fiunt per motum gravitatis et levitatis
tantum, ut aliae partes summitatem petant, aliae ad imum vergant; sed
multo magis per desiderium homogeneorum inter se coeundi et se uniendi.
Differt autem iste motus a motu indigentiae, in duobus. Uno, quod in
motu indigentiae sit stimulus major naturae malignae et contrariae; at
in hoc motu (si modo impedimenta et vincula absint) uniuntur partes per
amicitiam, licet absit natura aliena quae litem moveat: altero, quod
arctior sit unio, et tanquam majore cum delectu. In illo enim, modo
evitetur corpus inimicum, corpora etiam non admodum cognata concurrunt;
at in hoc coeunt substantiae, germana plane similitudine devinctae, et
conflantur tanquam in unum. Atque hic motus omnibus corporibus
compositis inest; et se facile conspiciendum in singulis daret, nisi
ligaretur et fraenaretur per alios corporum appetitus et necessitates,
quae istam coitionem disturbant.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ligatur autem motus iste plerumque tribus modis: torpore corporum;
fraeno corporis dominantis; et motu externo. Ad torporem corporum quod
attinet; certum est inesse corporibus tangibilibus pigritiam quandam
secundum magis et minus, et exhorrentiam motus localis; ut, nisi
excitentur, malint statu suo (prout sunt) esse contenta quam in melius
se expedire. Discutitur autem iste torpor triplici auxilio: aut per
calorem, aut per virtutem alicujus cognati corporis eminentem, aut per
motum vividum et potentem. Atque primo quoad auxilium caloris; hinc fit,
quod calor pronuntietur esse illud quod separet heterogenea, congreget
homogenea. Quam definitionem Peripateticorum merito derisit Gilbertus;
dicens eam esse perinde ac si quis diceret ac definiret hominem illud
esse quod serat triticum et plantet vineas: esse enim definitionem
tantum per effectus, eosque particulares. Sed adhuc magis culpanda est
illa definitio; quia etiam effectus illi (quales quales sunt) non sunt
ex proprietate caloris, sed tantum per accidens (idem enim facit frigus,
ut postea dicemus), nempe ex desiderio partium homogenearum coeundi,
adjuvante tantum calore ad discutiendum torporem, qui torpor desiderium
illud antea ligaverat. Quoad vero auxilium virtutis inditae a corpore
cognato; illud mirabiliter elucescit in magnete armato, qui excitat in
ferro virtutem detinendi ferrum per similitudinem substantiae, discusso
torpore ferri per virtutem magnetis. Quoad vero auxilium motus;
conspicitur illud in sagittis ligneis, cuspide etiam lignea, quae altius
penetrant in alia ligna quam si fuissent armatae ferro, per
similitudinem substantiae, discusso torpore ligni per motum celerem: de
quibus duobus experimentis etiam in aphorismo de instantiis clandestinis
diximus.</p>
<p>Ligatio vero motus congregationis minoris, quae fit per fraenum
corporis dominantis, conspicitur in solutione sanguinis et urinarum per
frigus. Quamdiu enim repleta fuerint corpora illa spiritu agili, qui
singulas eorum partes cujuscunque generis ipse ut dominus totius ordinat
et cohibet, tamdiu non coeunt heterogenea propter fraenum; sed postquam
ille spiritus evaporaverit, aut suffocatus fuerit per frigus, tum
solutae partes a fraeno coeunt secundum desiderium suum naturale. Atque
ideo fit, ut omnia corpora quae continent spiritum acrem (ut sales, et
hujusmodi) durent et non solvantur, ob fraenum permanens et durabile
spiritus dominantis et imperiosi.</p>
<p>Ligatio vero motus congregationis minoris, quae fit per motum
externum, maxime conspicitur in agitationibus corporum per quas arcetur
putrefactio. Omnis enim putrefactio fundatur in congregatione
homogeneorum; unde paulatim fit corruptio prioris (quam vocant) formae,
et generatio novae. Nam putrefactionem, quae sternit viam ad
generationem novae formae, praecedit solutio veteris; quae est ipsa
coitio ad homogeniam. Ea vero, si non impedita fuerit, fit solutio
simplex: sin occurrant varia quae obstant, sequuntur putrefactiones quae
sunt rudimenta generationis novae. Quod si (id quod nunc agitur) fiat
agitatio frequens per motum externum, tum vero motus iste coitionis (qui
est delicatus et mollis et indiget quiete ab externis) disturbatur et
cessat; ut fieri videmus in innumeris: veluti cum quotidiana agitatio
aut profluentia aquae arceat putrefactionem; venti arceant pestilentiam
aeris; grana in granariis versa et agitata maneant pura; omnia denique
agitata exterius non facile putrefiant interius.</p>
<p>Superest ut non omittatur coitio illa partium corporum, unde fit
praecipue induratio et desiccatio. Postquam enim spiritus, aut humidum
in spiritum versum, evolaverit in aliquo corpore porosiore (ut in ligno,
osse, membrana, et hujusmodi), tum partes crassiores majore nixu
contrahuntur et coeunt, unde sequitur induratio aut desiccatio: quod
existimamus fieri, non tam ob motum nexus, ne detur vacuum, quam per
motum istum amicitiae et unionis.</p>
<p>Ad coitionem vero ad distans quod attinet, ea infrequens est et rara;
et tamen in pluribus inest quam quibus observatur. Hujus simulacra sunt,
cum bulla solvat bullam; medicamenta ex similitudine substantiae trahant
humores; chorda in diversis fidibus ad unisonum moveat chordam; et
hujusmodi. Etiam in spiritibus animalium hunc motum vigere existimamus,
sed plane incognitum. At eminet certe in magnete, et ferro excito. Cum
autem de motibus magnetis loquimur, distinguendi plane sunt. Quatuor
enim virtutes sive operationes sunt in magnete, quae non confundi, sed
separari debent; licet admiratio hominum et stupor eas commiscuerit.
Una, coitionis magnetis ad magnetem, vel ferri ad magnetem, vel ferri
exciti ad ferrum. Secunda, verticitatis ejus ad septentriones et
austrum, atque simul declinationis ejus. Tertia, penetrationis ejus per
aurum, vitrum, lapidem, omnia. Quarta, communicationis virtutis ejus de
lapide in ferrum, et de ferro in ferrum, absque communicatione
substantiae. Verum hoc loco de prima virtute ejus tantum loquimur,
videlicet coitionis. Insignis etiam est motus coitionis argenti vivi et
auri: adeo ut aurum alliciat argentum vivum, licet confectum in
unguenta; atque operarii inter vapores argenti vivi soleant tenere in
ore frustum auri, ad colligendas emissiones argenti vivi, alias crania
et ossa eorum invasuras; unde etiam frustum illud paulo post albescit.
Atque de motu congregationis minoris haec dicta sint.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>Sit Motus Nonus, Motus Magneticus; qui licet sit ex genere motus
congregationis minoris, tamen si operetur ad distantias magnas et super
massas rerum magnas, inquisitionem meretur separatam; praesertim si nec
incipiat a tactu, quemadmodum plurimi, nec perducat actionem ad tactum,
quemadmodum omnes motus congregativi; sed corpora tantum elevet, aut ea
intumescere faciat, nec quicquam ultra. Nam si luna attollat aquas, aut
turgescere aut intumescere faciat humida; aut coelum stellatum attrahat
planetas versus sua apogaea; aut sol alliget astra Veneris et Mercurii,
ne longius absint a corpore ejus quam ad distantiam certam; videntur hi
motus nec sub congregatione majore nec sub congregatione minore bene
collocari, sed esse tanquam congregativa media et imperfecta, ideoque
speciem debere constituere propriam.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus, Motus Fugae; motus scilicet motui
congregationis minoris contrarius; per quem corpora ex antipathia
fugiunt et fugant inimica, seque ab illis separant, aut cum illis
miscere se recusant. Quamvis enim videri possit in aliquibus hic motus
esse motus tantum per accidens aut per consequens, respectu motus
congregationis minoris, quia nequeunt coire homogenea, nisi heterogeneis
exclusis et remotis; tamen ponendus est motus iste per se, et in speciem
constituendus, quia in multis appetitus fugae cernitur magis principalis
quam appetitus coitionis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Eminet autem hic motus insigniter in excretionibus animalium; nec
minus etiam in sensuum nonnullorum odiosis objectis, praecipue in
olfactu et gustu. Odor enim foetidus ita rejicitur ab olfactu, ut etiam
inducat in os stomachi motum expulsionis per consensum; sapor amarus et
horridus ita rejicitur a palato aut gutture, ut inducat per consensum
capitis conquassationem et horrorem. Veruntamen etiam in aliis locum
habet iste motus. Conspicitur enim in antiperistasibus nonnullis; ut in
aeris media regione, cujus frigora videntur esse rejectiones naturae
frigidae ex confiniis coelestium; quemadmodum etiam videntur magni illi
fervores et inflammationes, quae inveniuntur in locis subterraneis, esse
rejectiones naturae calidae ab interioribus terrae. Calor enim et
frigus, si fuerint in quanto minore, se invicem perimunt; sin fuerint in
massis majoribus et tanquam justis exercitibus, tum vero per conflictum
se locis invicem summovent et ejiciunt. Etiam tradunt cinamomum et
odorifera, sita juxta latrinas et loca foetida, diutius odorem retinere;
quia recusant exire et commisceri cum foetidis. Certe argentum vivum,
quod alias se reuniret in corpus integrum, prohibetur per salivam
hominis, aut axungiam porci, aut terebinthinam, et hujusmodi, ne partes
ejus coeant; propter malum consensum quem habent cum hujusmodi
corporibus; a quibus undique circumfusis se retrahunt; adeo ut fortior
sit earum fuga ab istis interjacentibus quam desiderium uniendi se cum
partibus sui similibus; id quod vocant mortificationem argenti vivi.
Etiam quod oleum cum aqua non misceatur, non tantum in causa est
differentia levitatis, sed malus ipsorum consensus: ut videre est in
spiritu vini, qui cum levior sit oleo, tamen se bene miscet cum aqua. At
maxime omnium insignis est motus fugae in nitro, et hujusmodi corporibus
crudis, quae flammam exhorrent; ut in pulvere pyrio, argento vivo,
necnon in auro. Fuga vero ferri ab altero polo magnetis a Gilberto bene
notatur non esse fuga propria, sed conformitas, et coitio ad situm magis
accommodatum.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>Sit Motus Undecimus, Motus Assimilationis, sive Multiplicationis
sui, sive etiam Generationis Simplicis. Generationem autem simplicem
dicimus non corporum integralium, ut in plantis, aut animalibus; sed
corporum similarium. Nempe per hunc motum corpora similaria vertunt
corpora alia affinia, aut saltem bene disposita et praeparata, in
substantiam et naturam suam: ut flamma, quae super halitus et oleosa
multiplicat se, et generat novam flammam; aer, qui super aquam et aquea
multiplicat se, et generat novum aerum; spiritus vegetabilis et
animalis, qui super tenuiores partes tam aquei quam oleosi in alimentis
suis multiplicat se, et generat novum spiritum; partes solidae plantarum
et animalium, veluti folium, flos, caro, os, et sic de caeteris, quae
singulae ex succis alimentorum assimilant et generant substantiam
successivam et epiusiam. Neque enim quenquam cum Paracelso delirare
juvet, qui (distillationibus suis scilicet occaecatus) nutritionem per
separationem tantum fieri voluit; quodque in pane vel cibo lateat
oculus, nasus cerebrum, jecur; in succo terrae radix, folium, flos.
Etenim sicut faber ex rudi massa lapidis vel ligni, per separationem et
rejectionem superflui, educit folium, florem, oculum, nasum, manum,
pedem, et similia; ita Archaeum illum Fabrum internum ex alimento per
separationem et rejectionem educere singula membra et partes asserit
ille. Verum missis nugis, certissimum est partes singulas, tam similares
quam organicas, in vegetabilibus et animalibus, succos alimentorum
suorum fere communes, aut non multum diversos, primo attrahere cum
nonnullo delectu, deinde assimilare, et vertere in naturam suam. Neque
assimilatio ista, aut generatio simplex, fit solum in corporibus
animatis, verum et inanimata ex hac re participant; veluti de flamma et
aere dictum est. Quinetiam spiritus emortuus, qui in omni tangibili
animato continetur, id perpetuo agit, ut partes crassiores digerat et
vertat in spiritum, qui deinde exeat; unde fit diminutio ponderis et
exsiccatio, ut alibi diximus. Neque etiam respuenda est in assimilatione
accretio illa, quam vulgo ab alimentatione distinguunt; veluti cum lutum
inter lapillos concrescit, et vertitur in materiam lapideam; squammae
circa dentes vertuntur in substantiam non minus duram quam sunt dentes
ipsi, etc. Sumus enim in ea opinione, inesse corporibus omnibus
desiderium assimilandi, non minus quam coeundi ad homogenea; verum
ligatur ista virtus, sicut et illa, licet non iisdem modis. Sed modos
illos, necnon solutionem ab iisdem, omni diligentia inquirere oportet,
quia pertinent ad senectutis refocillationem. Postremo videtur notatu
dignum, quod in novem illis motibus, de quibus diximus, corpora tantum
naturae suae conservationem appetere videntur; in hoc decimo autem
propagationem.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Duodecimus, Motus Excitationis; qui motus videtur esse
ex genere assimilationis, atque eo nomine quandoque a nobis promiscue
vocatur. Est enim motus diffusivus, et communicativus, et transitivus,
et multiplicativus, sicut et ille; atque effectu (ut plurimum)
consentiunt, licet efficiendi modo et subjecto differant. Motus enim
assimilationis procedit tanquam cum imperio et potestate; jubet enim et
cogit assimilatum in assimilantem verti et mutari. At motus excitationis
procedit tanquam arte et insinuatione et furtim; et invitat tantum, et
disponit excitatum ad naturam excitantis. Etiam motus assimilationis
multiplicat et transformat corpora et substantias; veluti, plus fit
flammae, plus aeris, plus spiritus, plus carnis. At in motu
excitationis, multiplicantur et transeunt virtutes tantum; et plus fit
calidi, plus magnetici, plus putridi. Eminet autem iste motus praecipue
in calido et frigido. Neque enim calor diffundit se in calefaciendo per
communicationem primi caloris; sed tantum per excitationem partium
corporis ad motum illum qui est Forma Calidi; de quo in vindemiatione
prima de natura calidi diximus. Itaque longe tardius et difficilius
excitatur calor in lapide aut metallo quam in aere, ob inhabilitatem et
impromptitudinem corporum illorum ad motum illum; ita ut verisimile sit
posse esse interius versus viscera terrae materias quae calefieri
prorsus respuant; quia ob condensationem majorem spiritu illo
destituuntur a quo motus iste excitationis plerunque incipit. Similiter
magnes induit ferrum nova partium dispositione et motu conformi; ipse
autem nihil ex virtute perdit. Similiter fermentum panis, et flos
cervisiae, et coagulum lactis, et nonnulla ex venenis, excitant et
invitant motum in massa farinaria, aut cervisia, aut caseo, aut corpore
humano, successivum et continuatum; non tam ex vi excitantis quam ex
praedispositione et facili cessione excitati.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus Tertius, Motus Impressionis; qui motus est
etiam ex genere motus assimilationis, estque ex diffusivis motibus
subtilissimus. Nobis autem visum est eum in speciem propriam
constituere, propter differentiam insignem quam habet erga priores duos.
Motus enim assimilationis simplex corpora ipsa transformat; ita ut si
tollas primum movens nihil intersit ad ea quae sequuntur. Neque enim
prima accensio in flammam, aut prima versio in aerem, aliquid facit ad
flammam aut aerem in generatione succedentem. Similiter, motus
excitationis omnino manet, remoto primo movente, ad tempora bene
diuturna; ut in corpore calefacto, remoto primo calore; in ferro excito,
remoto magnete; in massa farinaria, remoto fermento. At Motus
Impressionis, licet sit diffusivus, et transitivus, tamen perpetuo
pendere videtur ex primo movente; adeo ut, sublato aut cessante illo,
statim deficiat et pereat; itaque etiam momento, aut saltem exiguo
tempore, transigitur. Quare motus illos assimilationis et excitationis,
motus generationis Jovis, quia generatio manet; hunc autem motum Motum
Generationis Saturni, quia natus statim devoratur et absorbetur,
appellare consuevimus. Manifestat se vero hic motus in tribus; in lucis
radiis; sonorum percussionibus; et magneticis, quatenus ad
communicationem. Etenim amota luce, statim pereunt colores et reliquae
imagines ejus; amota percussione prima et quassatione corporis inde
facta, paulo post perit sonus. Licet enim soni etiam in medio per ventos
tanquam per undas agitentur; tamen diligentius notandum est, quod sonus
non tam diu durat quam fit resonatio. Etenim impulsa campana, sonus ad
bene magnum tempus continuari videtur; unde quis facile in errorem
labatur, si existimet toto illo tempore sonum tanquam natare et haerere
in aere; quod falsissimum est. Etenim illa resonatio non est idem sonus
numero, sed renovatur. Hoc autem manifestatur ex sedatione sive
cohibitione corporis percussi. Si enim sistatur et detineatur campana
fortiter et fiat immobilis, statim perit sonus nec resonat amplius; ut
in chordis, si post primam percussionem tangatur chorda, vel digito ut
in lyra, vel calamo ut in espinetis, statim desinit resonatio. Magnete
autem remoto, statim ferrum decidit. Luna autem a mari non potest
removeri; nec terra a ponderoso dum cadit. Itaque de illis nullum fieri
potest experimentum; sed ratio eadem est.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus Quartus, Motus Configurationis, aut Situs; per
quem corpora appetere videntur, non coitionem aut separationem aliquam,
sed situm, et collocationem, et configurationem cum aliis. Est autem
iste motus valde abstrusus, nec bene inquisitus. Atque in quibusdam
videtur quasi incausabilis; licet revera (ut existimamus) non ita sit.
Etenim si quaeratur cur potius coelum volvatur ab oriente in occidentem
quam ab occidente in orientem; aut cur vertatur circa polos positos
juxta Ursas potius quam circa Orionem, aut ex alia aliqua parte coeli:
videtur ista quaestio tanquam quaedam extasis, cum ista potius ab
experientia, et ut positiva recipi debeant. At in natura profecto sunt
quaedam ultima et incausabilia; verum hoc ex illis non esse videtur.
Etenim hoc fieri existimamus ex quadam harmonia et consensu mundi, qui
adhuc non venit in observationem. Quod si recipiatur motus terrae ab
occidente in orientem, eaedem manent quaestiones. Nam et ipsa super
aliquos polos movetur. Atque cur tandem debeant isti poli collocari
magis ubi sunt quam alibi? Item verticitas, et directio, et declinatio
magnetis ad hunc motum referuntur. Etiam inveniuntur in corporibus tam
naturalibus quam artificialibus, praesertim consistentibus et non
fluidis, collatio quaedam et positura partium, et tanquam villi et
fibrae, quae diligenter investigandae sunt; utpote sine quarum
inventione corpora illa commode tractari aut regi non possunt. At
circulationes illas in liquidis, per quas illa dum pressa sint, antequam
se liberare possunt, se invicem relevant, ut compressionem illam ex
aequo tolerent, motui libertatis verius assignamus.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus Quintus, Motus Pertransitionis, sive Motus
secundum Meatus; per quem virtutes corporum magis aut minus impediuntur
aut provehuntur a mediis ipsorum, pro natura corporum et virtutum
operantium, atque etiam medii. Aliud enim medium luci convenit, aliud
sono, aliud calori et frigori, aliud virtutibus magneticis, necnon aliis
nonnullis respective.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus Sextus, Motus Regius (ita enim eum appellamus)
sive Politicus; per quem partes in corpore aliquo praedominantes et
imperantes reliquas partes fraenant, domant, subigunt, ordinant, et
cogunt eas adunari, separari, consistere, moveri, collocari, non ex
desideriis suis, sed prout in ordine sit et conducat ad bene esse partis
illius imperantis; adeo ut sit quasi Regimen et Politia quaedam, quam
exercet pars regens in partes subditas. Eminet autem hic motus praecipue
in spiritibus animalium, qui motus omnes partium reliquarum, quamdiu
ipse in vigore est, contemperat. Invenitur autem in aliis corporibus in
gradu quodam inferiore; quemadmodum dictum est de sanguine et urinis,
quae non solvuntur donec spiritus, qui partes earum commiscebat et
cohibebat, emissus fuerit aut suffocatus. Neque iste motus omnino
spiritibus proprius est, licet in plerisque corporibus spiritus
dominentur ob motum celerem et penetrationem. Veruntamen in corporibus
magis condensatis, nec spiritu vivido et vigente (qualis inest argento
vivo et vitriolo) repletis, dominantur potius partes crassiores; adeo ut
nisi fraenum et jugum hoc arte aliqua excutiatur, de nova aliqua
hujusmodi corporum transformatione minime sperandum sit. Neque vero
quispiam nos oblitos esse existimet ejus quod nunc agitur; quia cum ista
series et distributio motuum ad nil aliud spectet, quam ut illorum
praedominantia per instantias luctae melius inquiratur, jam inter motus
ipsos praedominantiae mentionem faciamus. Non enim in descriptione motus
istius regii, de praedominantia motuum aut virtutum tractamus, sed
praedominantia partium in corporibus. Haec enim ea est praedominantia,
quae speciem istam motus peculiarem constituit.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus Septimus, Motus Rotationis Spontaneus; per quem
corpora motu gaudentia, et bene collocata, natura sua fruuntur, atque
seipsa sequuntur, non aliud, et tanquam proprios petunt amplexus. Etenim
videntur corpora aut movere sine termino; aut plane quiescere; aut ferri
ad terminum, ubi pro natura sua aut rotent aut quiescant. Atque quae
bene collocata sunt, si motu gaudeant, movent per circulum: motu
scilicet aeterno et infinito. Quae bene collocata sunt, et motum
exhorrent, prorsus quiescunt. Quae non bene collocata sunt, movent in
linea recta (tanquam tramite brevissimo) ad consortia suorum
connaturalium. Recipit autem motus iste rotationis differentias novem.
Primam, centri sui, circa quod corpora movent: secundam, polorum suorum,
supra quos movent: tertiam, circumferentiae sive ambitus sui, prout
distant a centro: quartam, incitationis suae, prout celerius aut tardius
rotant: quintam, consequutionis motus sui, veluti ab oriente in
occidentem, aut ab occidente in orientem: sextam, declinationis a
circulo perfecto per spiras longius aut propius distantes a centro suo:
septimam, declinationis a circulo perfecto per spiras longius aut
propius distantes a polis suis: octavam, distantiae proprioris aut
longioris spirarum suarum ad invicem: nonam et ultimam, variationis
ipsorum polorum, si sint mobiles: quae ipsa ad rotationem non pertinet,
nisi fiat circulariter. Atque iste motus communi et inveterata opinione
habetur pro proprio coelestium. Attamen gravis de illo motu lis est
inter nonnullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt. At multo fortasse justior movetur controversia (si modo
res non sit omnino extra controversiam), an motus videlicet iste
(concesso quod terra stet) coeli finibus contineatur, an potius
descendat, et communicetur aeri et aquis. Motum autem rotationis in
missilibus, ut in spiculis, sagittis, pilis sclopetorum, et similibus,
omnino ad motum libertatis rejicimus.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus Octavus, Motus Trepidationis, cui (ut ab
astronomis intelligitur) non multum fidei adhibemus. Nobis autem
corporum naturalium appetitus ubique serio perscrutantibus occurrit iste
motus; et constitui debere videtur in speciem. Est autem hic motus
veluti aeternae cujusdam captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino
pro natura sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,
perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant, nec statu suo contenta, nec
ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus in corde et pulsibus
animalium; et necesse est ut sit in omnibus corporibus, quae statu
ancipiti ita degunt inter commoda et incommoda, ut distracta liberare se
tentent, et denuo repulsam patiantur, et tamen perpetuo
experiantur.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus, motus ille cui vix nomen
motus competit, et tamen est plane motus. Quem motum, Motum Decubitus,
sive Motum Exhorrentiae Motus, vocare licet. Per hunc motum terra stat
mole sua, moventibus se extremis suis in medium; non ad centrum
imaginativum, sed ad unionem. Per hunc etiam appetitum omnia majorem in
modum condensata motum exhorrent, atque illis pro omni appetitu est non
moveri; et licet infinitis modis vellicentur et provocentur ad motum,
tamen naturam suam (quoad possunt) tuentur. Quod si ad motum
compellantur, tamen hoc agere semper videntur ut quietem et statum suum
recuperent, neque amplius moveant. Atque circa hoc certe se agilia
praebent, et satis perniciter et rapide (ut pertaesa et impatientia
omnis morae) contendunt. Hujus autem appetitus imago ex parte tantum
cerni potest; quia hic apud nos, ex subactione et concoctione
coelestium, omne tangibile non tantum non condensatum est ad
ultimitatem, sed etiam cum spiritu nonnullo miscetur.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Proposuimus itaque jam species sive elementa simplicia motuum,
appetituum, et virtutum activarum, quae sunt in natura maxime catholica.
Neque parum scientiae naturalis sub illis adumbratum est. Non negamus
tamen et alias species fortasse addi posse, atque istas ipsas divisiones
secundum veriores rerum venas transferri, denique in minorem numerum
posse redigi. Neque tamen hoc de divisionibus aliquibus abstractis
intelligimus: veluti si quis dicat corpora appetere vel conservationem,
vel exaltationem, vel propagationem, vel fruitionem naturae suae; aut si
quis dicat motus rerum tendere ad conservationem et bonum, vel universi,
ut antitypiam et nexum; vel universitatum magnarum, ut motus
congregationis majoris, rotationis, et exhorrentiae motus; vel formarum
specialium, ut reliquos. Licet enim haec vera sint, tamen nisi
terminentur in materia et fabrica secundum veras lineas, speculativa
sunt, et minus utilia. Interim sufficient et boni erunt usus ad
pensitandas praedominantias virtutum et exquirendas instantias luctae;
id quod nunc agitur.</p>
<p>Etenim ex his quos proposuimus motibus alii prorsus sunt
invincibiles; alii aliis sunt fortiores, et illos ligant, fraenant,
disponunt; alii aliis longius jaculantur; alii alios tempore et
celeritate praevertunt; alii alios fovent, roborant, ampliant,
accelerant.</p>
<p>Motus antitypiae omnino est adamantinus et invincibilis. Utrum vero
Motus nexus sit invincibilis adhuc haeremus. Neque enim pro certo
affirmaverimus utrum detur Vacuum, sive coacervatum sive permistum. At
de illo nobis constat, rationem illam, propter quam introductum est
Vacuum a Leucippo et Democrito (videlicet quod absque eo non possent
eadem corpora complecti et implere majora et minora spatia), falsam
esse. Est enim plane plica materiae complicantis et replicantis se per
spatia, inter certos fines, absque interpositione vacui; neque est in
aere ex vacuo bis millies (tantum enim esse oportet) plus quam in auro.
Id quod ex potentissimis corporum pneumaticorum virtutibus (quae aliter
tanquam pulveris minuti natarent in vacuo), et multis aliis
demonstrationibus, nobis satis liquet. Reliqui vero Motus regunt et
reguntur invicem, pro rationibus vigoris, quanti, incitationis,
ejaculationis, necnon tum auxiliorum tum impedimentorum quae
occurrunt.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia: magnes armatus nonnullus detinet et suspendit ferrum,
ad sexagecuplum pondus ipsius; eo usque dominatur motus congregationis
minoris super motum congregationis majoris; quod si majus fuerit pondus,
succumbit. Vectis tanti roboris sublevabit tantum pondus; eo usque
dominatur motus libertatis super motum congregationis majoris; sin majus
fuerit pondus, succumbit. Corium tensum ad tensuram talem non rumpitur;
eo usque dominatur motus continuationis super motum tensurae; quod si
ulterior fuerit tensura, rumpitur corium, et succumbit motus
continuationis. Aqua per rimam perforationis talis effluit; eo usque
dominatur motus congregationis majoris super motum continuationis; quod
si minor fuerit rima, succumbit, et vincit motus continuationis. In
pulvere sulphuris solius immissi in sclopetum cum pila, et admoto igne,
non emittitur pila; in eo motus congregationis majoris vincit motum
hyles. At in pulvere pyrio immisso vincit motus hyles in sulphure,
adjutus motibus hyles et fugae in nitro. Et sic de caeteris. Etenim
instantiae luctae (quae indicant praedominantiam virtutum, et secundum
quas rationes et calculos praedominentur et succumbant) acri et sedula
diligentia undique sunt conquirendae.</p>
<p>Etiam modi et rationes ipsius succumbentiae motuum diligenter sunt
introspiciendae. Nempe, an omnino cessent, vel potius usque nitantur,
sed ligentur. Etenim in corporibus hic apud nos, nulla vera est quies,
nec in integris nec in partibus; sed tantum secundum apparentiam. Quies
autem ista apparens causatur aut per aequilibrium, aut per absolutam
praedominantiam motuum. Per aequilibrium, ut in bilancibus, quae stant
si aequa sint pondera. Per praedominantiam, ut in hydriis perforatis,
ubi quiescit aqua et detinetur a decasu, per praedominantiam motus
nexus. Notandum tamen est (ut diximus) quatenus nitantur motus illi
succumbentes. Etenim si quis per luctam detineatur extensus in terra,
brachiis et tibiis vinctis, aut aliter detentis; atque ille tamen totis
viribus resurgere nitatur; non est minor nixus, licet non proficiat.
Hujus autem rei conditio (scilicet utrum per praedominantiam motus
succumbens quasi annihiletur, an potius continuetur nixus, licet non
conspiciatur), quae latet in conflictibus, apparebit fortasse in
concurrentiis. Exempli gratia; fiat experimentum in sclopetis, utrum
sclopetus, pro tanto spatio quo emittat pilam in linea directa, sive (ut
vulgo loquuntur) in puncto blanco, debiliorem edat percussionem
ejaculando in supra, ubi Motus Ictus est simplex, quam desuper, ubi
Motus Gravitatis concurrit cum Ictu.</p>
<p>Etiam canones praedominantiarum qui occurrunt colligendi sunt.
Veluti, quod quo communius est bonum quod appetitur, eo motus est
fortior ut motus nexus, qui respicit communionem universi, fortior est
motu gravitatis, qui respicit communionem densorum. Etiam quod appetitus
qui sunt boni privati, non praevalent plerunque contra appetitus boni
magis publici, nisi in parvis quantis. Quae utinam obtinerent in
civilibus.</p>

Atque de instrumentis ipsis atque ingeniationibus proprius erit dicendi

Quinetiam quae adhuc cognita sunt et in usum venerunt, in Historiis
Particularibus singularum artium describentur. In praesenti autem
subjungemus quaedam catholica circa ea pro exemplis tantum
polychresti.</p>
<p>Operatur igitur homo super corpora naturalia (praeter ipsam
admotionem et amotionem corporum simplicem) septem praecipue modis:
nempe, vel per exclusionem eorum quae impediunt et disturbant; vel per
compressiones, extensiones, agitationes, et hujusmodi; vel per calorem
et frigus; vel per moram in loco convenienti; vel per fraenum et regimen
motus; vel per consensus speciales; vel per alternationem tempestivam et
debitam, atque seriem et successionem horum omnium; aut saltem
nonnullorum ex illis.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ad primum igitur quod attinet; aer communis qui undique praesto est
et se ingerit, atque radii coelestium, multum turbant. Quae itaque ad
illorum exclusionem faciunt, merito haberi possint pro polychrestis. Huc
igitur pertinent materies et crassities vasorum, in quibus corpora ad
operationem praeparata reponuntur. Similiter, modi accurati obturationis
vasorum, per consolidationem et lutum sapientiae, ut loquuntur chymici.
Etiam clausura per liquores in extimis, utilissima res est; ut cum
infundunt oleum super vinum aut succos herbarum, quod expandendo se in
summitate instar operculi, optime ea conservat illaesa ab aere. Neque
pulveres res malae sunt; qui, licet contineant aerem permistum, tamen
vim aeris coacervati et circumfusi arcent: ut fit in conservatione
uvarum et fructuum intra arenam, et farinam. Etiam cera, mel, pix, et
hujusmodi tenacia, recte obducuntur ad clausuram perfectiorem, et ad
summovendum aerem et coelestia. Etiam nos experimentum quandoque
fecimus, ponendo vas, necnon aliqua alia corpora, intra argentum vivum,
quod omnium longe densissimum est ex iis quae circumfundi possunt.
Quinetiam specus et cavernae subterraneae magni usus sunt ad prohibendum
insolationem et aerem istum apertum praedatorium; qualibus utuntur
Germani Septentrionales pro granariis. Necnon repositio corporum in
fundo aquarum ad hoc spectat: ut memini me quippiam audisse de utribus
vini demissis in profundum puteum, ad infrigidationem scilicet, sed casu
et per neglectum ac oblivionem ibidem remanentibus per multos annos, et
deinde extractis; unde vinum factum est non solum non vapidum aut
emortuum, sed multo magis nobile ad gustum, per commixtionem partium
suarum (ut videtur) magis exquisitam. Quod si postulet res ut corpora
demittantur ad fundum aquarum, veluti intra fluvios aut mare, neque
tamen aquas tangant, nec in vasibus obturatis concludantur, sed aere
tantum circumdentur; bonus est usus vasis illius quod adhibitum est
nonnunquam ad operandum subter aquis super navigia demersa, ut
urinatores diutius manere possint sub aquis, et per vices ad tempus
respirare. Illud hujusmodi erat. Conficiebatur dolium ex metallo
concavum, quod demittebatur aequabiliter ad superficiem aquae, atque sic
deportabat totum aerem qui continebatur in dolio secum in fundum maris.
Stabat autem super pedes tres (instar tripodis), qui longitudinis erant
aliquanto minoris statura hominis; ita ut urinator posset cum anhelitus
deficeret, immittere caput in cavum dolii, et respirare, et deinde opus
continuare. Atque audivimus inventam esse jam machinam aliquam naviculae
aut scaphae, quae homines subter aquis vehere possit ad spatia
nonnnulla. Verum sub tali vase, quale modo diximus, corpora quaevis
facile suspendi possint; cujus causa hoc experimentum adduximus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Est et alius usus diligentis et perfectae clausurae corporum: nempe,
non solum ut prohibeatur aditus aeris per exterius (de quo jam dictum
est), verum etiam ut cohibeatur exitus spiritus corporis, super quod fit
operatio per interius. Necesse est enim ut operanti circa corpora
naturalia constet de summis suis: viz. quod nihil expirarit aut
effluxerit. Fiunt enim profundae alterationes in corporibus, quando,
natura prohibente annihilationem, ars prohibeat etiam deperditionem aut
evolationem alicujus partis. Atque hac de re invaluit opinio falsa (quae
si vera esset, de ista conservatione summae certae absque diminutione
esset fere desperandum): viz. spiritus corporum, et aerem majori gradu
caloris attenuatum, nullis vasorum claustris posse contineri, quin per
poros vasorum subtiliores evolent. Atque in hanc opinionem adducti sunt
homines per vulgata illa experimenta, poculi inversi super aquam cum
candela aut charta inflammata, ex quo fit ut aqua sursum attrahatur;
atque similiter ventosarum, quae super flammam calefactae trahunt
carnes. Existimant enim in utroque experimento aerem attenuatum emitti,
et inde quantum ipsius minui, ideoque aquam aut carnes per nexum
succedere. Quod falsissimum est. Aer enim non quanto diminuitur, sed
spatio contrahitur; neque incipit motus iste successionis aquae,
antequam fiat extinctio flammae aut refrigeratio aeris: adeo ut medici,
quo fortius attrahant ventosae, ponant spongias frigidas aqua madefactas
super ventosas. Itaque non est cur homines multum sibi metuant de facili
exitu aeris aut spirituum. Licet enim verum sit etiam solidissima
corpora habere suos poros, tamen aegre patitur aer aut spiritus
comminutionem sui ad tantam subtilitatem; quemadmodum et aqua exire
recusat per rimam minusculam.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>De secundo vero modo ex septem praedictis illud imprimis notandum
est, valere certe compressiones et hujusmodi violentias ad motum
localem, atque alia id genus, potentissime; ut in machinis et
missilibus: etiam ad destructionem corporis organici, atque earum
virtutum quae consistunt plane in motu. Omnis enim vita, immo etiam
omnis flamma et ignitio destruitur per compressiones; ut et omnis
machina corrumpitur et confunditur per easdem. Etiam ad destructionem
virtutum quae consistunt in posituris, et dissimilaritate partium paulo
crassiore; ut in coloribus (neque enim idem color floris integri et
contusi, neque succini integri et pulverizati); etiam in saporibus
(neque enim idem sapor pyri immaturi, et ejusdem compressi ac subacti;
nam manifesto dulcedinem majorem concipit). Verum ad transformationes et
alterationes nobiliores corporum similarium non multum valent istae
violentiae; quia corpora per eas non acquirunt consistentiam aliquam
novam constantem et quiescentem, sed transitoriam, et nitentem semper ad
restitutionem et liberationem sui. Attamen non abs re foret hujus rei
facere experimenta aliqua diligentiora; ad hoc scilicet, utrum
condensatio corporis bene similaris (qualia sunt aer, aqua, oleum, et
hujusmodi), aut rarefactio similiter per violentiam indita, possint
fieri constantes et fixae et quasi mutatae in naturam. Id quod primo
experiendum per moram simplicem; deinde per auxilia et consensus. Atque
illud nobis in promptu fuisset (si modo in mentem venisset), cum aquam
(de qua alibi) per malleationes et pressoria condensavimus, antequam
erumperet. Debueramus enim sphaeram complanatam per aliquot dies sibi
permisisse, et tum demum aquam extraxisse; ut fieret experimentum, utrum
statim impletura fuisset talem dimensionem, qualem habebat ante
condensationem. Quod si non fecisset aut statim, aut certe paulo post,
constans videlicet facta videri potuisset ista condensatio; sin minus,
apparuisset factam fuisse restitutionem, et compressionem fuisse
transitoriam. Etiam simile quiddam faciendum erat circa extensionem
aeris in ovis vitreis. Etenim debuerat fieri, post exuctionem fortem,
subita et firma obturatio; deinde debuerant ova illa manere ita obturata
per nonnullos dies; et tum demum experiendum fuisset, utrum aperto
foramine attractus fuisset aer cum sibilo, aut etiam attracta fuisset
tanta quantitas aquae post immersionem, quanta fuisset ab initio, si
nulla adhibita fuisset mora. Probabile enim, aut saltem dignum
probatione est, haec fieri potuisse et posse; propterea quod in
corporibus paulo magis dissimilaribus similia efficiat mora temporis.
Etenim baculum per compressionem curvatum post aliquod tempus non
resilit; neque id imputandum est alicui deperditioni ex quanto ligni per
moram; nam idem fiet in lamina ferri (si augeatur mora), quae non est
expirabilis. Quod si non succedat experimentum per moram simplicem,
tamen non deserendum est negotium, sed auxilia alia adhibenda. Non enim
parum lucri fit, si per violentias indi possint corporibus naturae fixae
et constantes. Hac enim ratione aer possit verti in aquam per
condensationes, et complura alia id genus. Dominus enim est homo motuum
violentorum, magis quam caeterorum.</p></li>
<li><p>At tertius ex septem modis refertur ad magnum illud organum, tam
naturae quam artis, quoad operandum; videlicet calidum et frigidum.
Atque in hac parte claudicat plane potentia humana, tanquam ex uno pede.
Habemus enim calorem ignis, qui caloribus solis (prout ad nos
deferuntur) et caloribus animalium quasi infinitis partibus potentior
est et intensior. At deest frigus, nisi quale per tempestates hyemales,
aut per cavernas, aut per circundationes nivis et glaciei, haberi
potest: quod in comparatione aequari potest cum calore fortasse solis
meridiano in regione aliqua ex torridis, aucto insuper per
reverberationes montium et parietum; nam hujusmodi utique tam calores
quam frigora ab animalibus ad tempus exiguum tolerari possunt. Nihili
autem sunt fere prae calore fornacis ardentis, aut alicujus frigoris
quod huic gradui respondeat. Itaque omnia hic apud nos vergunt ad
rarefactionem, et desiccationem, et consumptionem: nihil fere ad
condensationem et intenerationem, nisi per misturas et modos quasi
spurios. Quare Instantiae Frigoris omni diligentia sunt conquirendae:
quales videntur inveniri in expositione corporum super turres quando
gelat acriter; in cavernis subterraneis; circundationibus nivis et
glaciei in locis profundioribus, et ad hoc excavatis; demissione
corporum in puteos; sepulturis corporum in argento vivo et metallis;
immersione corporum in aquis, quae vertunt ligna in lapides; defossione
corporum in terra (qualis fertur apud Chinenses esse confectio
porcellanae, ubi massae ad hoc factae dicuntur manere intra terram per
quadraginta aut quinquaginta annos, et transmitti ad haeredes, tanquam
minerae quaedam artificiales); et hujusmodi. Quinetiam quae interveniunt
in natura condensationes, factae per frigora, similiter sunt
investigandae; ut, causis eorum cognitis, transferri possint in artes.
Quales cernuntur in exudatione marmoris et lapidum; in rorationibus
super vitra per interius fenestrarum, sub auroram, post gelu noctis; in
originibus et collectionibus vaporum in aquas sub terra, unde saepe
scaturiunt fontes; et quaecunque sunt hujus generis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Inveniuntur autem, praeter illa quae sunt frigida ad tactum, quaedam
alia potestate frigida, quae etiam condensant; veruntamen operari
videntur super corpora animalium tantum, et vix ultra. Hujus generis se
ostendunt multa in medicinis et emplastris. Alia autem condensant carnes
et partes tangibiles; qualia sunt medicamenta astringentia, atque etiam
inspissantiae: alia condensant spiritus; id quod maxime cernitur in
soporiferis. Duplex autem est modus condensationis spirituum, per
medicamenta soporifera, sive provocantia somnum: alter per sedationem
motus; alter per fugam spirituum. Etenim viola, rosa sicca, lactuca, et
hujusmodi benedicta sive benigna, per vapores suos amicos et moderate
refrigerantes, invitant spiritus ut se uniant, et ipsorum acrem et
inquietum motum compescunt. Etiam aqua rosacea, apposita ad nares in
deliquiis animae, spiritus resolutos et nimium relaxatos se recipere
facit, et tanquam alit. At opiata et eorum affinia spiritus plane
fugant, ex qualitate sua maligna et inimica. Itaque si applicentur parti
exteriori, statim aufugiunt spiritus ab illa parte, nec amplius libenter
influunt: sin sumantur interius, vapores eorum, ascendentes ad caput,
spiritus in ventriculis cerebri contentos undequaque fugant; cumque se
retrahant spiritus neque in aliam partem effugere possint, per
consequens coeunt et condensantur; et quandoque plane extinguuntur et
suffocantur; licet rursus eadem opiata moderate sumpta, per accidens
secundarium (videlicet condensationem illam quae a coitione succedit),
confortent spiritus, eosque reddant magis robustos, et retundant eorum
inutiles et incensivos motus, ex quo ad curas morborum, et vitae
prolongationem haud parum conferant.</p>
<p>Etiam praeparationes corporum ad excipiendum frigus non sunt
omittendae; veluti quod aqua parum tepida facilius conglacietur quam
omnino frigida, et hujusmodi.</p>
<p>Praeterea, quia natura frigus tam parce suppeditat, faciendum est
quemadmodum pharmacopolae solent; qui, quando simplex aliquod haberi non
possit, capiunt succedaneum ejus, et quid pro quo, ut vocant: veluti
lignum aloes pro xylobalsamo, cassiam pro cinamomo. Simili modo
diligenter circumspiciendum est, si quae sint succedanea frigoris;
videlicet quibus modis fieri possint condensationes in corporibus,
aliter quam per frigus, quod illas efficit ut opus suum proprium. Illae
autem condensationes videntur intra quaternum numerum (quantum adhuc
liquet) contineri. Quarum prima videtur fieri per contrusionem
simplicem; quae parum potest ad densitatem constantem (resiliunt enim
corpora) sed nihilominus forte res auxiliaris esse queat. Secunda fit
per contractionem partium crassiorum in corpore aliquo, post evolationem
aut exitum partium tenuiorum, ut fit in indurationibus per ignem, et
repetitis extinctionibus metallorum, et similibus. Tertia fit per
coitionem partium homogenearum, quae sunt maxime solidae in corpore
aliquo, atque antea fuerant distractae, et cum minus solidis commistae:
veluti in restitutione mercurii sublimati, qui in pulvere longe majus
occupat spatium quam mercurius simplex, et similiter in omni
repurgatione metallorum a scoriis suis. Quarta fit per consensus,
admovendo quae ex vi corporum occulta condensant; qui consensus adhuc
raro se ostendunt; quod mirum minime est, quoniam antequam inventio
succedat formarum et schematismorum, de inquisitione consensuum non
multum sperandum est. Certe quoad corpora animalium, dubium non est quin
sint complures medicinae, tam interius quam exterius sumptae, quae
condensant tanquam per consensum, ut paulo ante diximus. Sed inanimatis
rara est hujusmodi operatio. Percrebuit sane, tam scriptis quam fama,
narratio de arbore in una ex insulis sive Terceris sive Canariis (neque
enim bene memini), quae perpetuo stillat; adeo ut inhabitantibus
nonnullam commoditatem aquae praebeat. Paracelsus autem ait, herbam
vocatam Rorem Solis meridie et fervente sole rore impleri, cum aliae
herbae undique sint siccae. At nos utramque narrationem fabulosam esse
existimamus. Omnino autem illae instantiae nobilissimi forent usus, et
introspectione dignissimae, si essent verae. Etiam rores illos mellitos,
et instar mannae, qui super foliis quercus inveniuntur mense Maio, non
existimamus fieri et densari a consensu aliquo, sive a proprietate folii
quercus; sed cum super aliis foliis pariter cadant, contineri scilicet
et durare in foliis quercus, quia sunt bene unita, nec spongiosa, ut
plurima ex aliis.</p>
<p>Calorem vero quod attinet, copia et potestas nimirum homini abunde
adest; observatio autem et inquisitio deficit in nonnullis, iisque
maxime necessariis, utcunque spagyrici se venditent. Etenim caloris
intensioris opificia exquiruntur et conspiciuntur; remissioris vero,
quae maxime in vias naturae incidunt, non tentantur, ideoque latent.
Itaque videmus per vulcanos istos qui in pretio sunt, spiritus corporum
magnopere exaltari, ut in aquis fortibus, et nonnullis aliis oleis
chymicis; partes tangibiles indurari, et, emisso volatili, aliquando
figi; partes homogeneas separari; etiam corpora heterogenea grosso modo
incorporari et commisceri; maxime autem compages corporum compositorum
et subtiliores schematismos destrui et confundi. Debuerant autem
opificia caloris lenioris tentari et exquiri; unde subtiliores misturae
et schematismi ordinati gigni possint et educi, ad exemplum naturae et
imitationem operum solis; quemadmodum in aphorismo de instantiis
foederis quaedam adumbravimus. Opificia enim naturae transiguntur per
longe minores portiones, et posituras magis exquisitas et varias, quam
opificia ignis, prout nunc adhibetur. Tum vero videatur homo revera
auctus potestate, si per calores et potentias artificiales opera naturae
possint specie repraesentari, virtute perfici, copia variari; quibus
addere oportet accelerationem temporis. Nam rubigo ferri longo tempore
procedit, at versio in crocum Martis subito; et similiter de aerugine et
cerussa. Christallum longo tempore conficitur, vitrum subito conflatur.
Lapides longo tempore concrescunt, lateres subito coquuntur, etc.
Interim (quod nunc agitur) omnes diversitates caloris cum effectibus
suis respective diligenter et industrie undique sunt colligendae et
exquirendae: coelestium, per radios suos directos, reflexos, refractos,
et unitos in speculis comburentibus; fulguris, flammae, ignis carbonum;
ignis ex diversis materiis; ignis aperti, conclusi, angustiati, et
inundantis, denique per diversas fabricas fornacium qualificati; ignis
flatu exciti, quieti et non exciti; ignis ad majorem aut minorem
distantiam remoti; ignis per varia media permeantis; calorum humidorum,
ut balnei Mariae, fimi, caloris animalium per exterius, caloris
animalium per interius, foeni conclusi; calorum aridorum, cineris,
calcis, arenae tepidae; denique calorum cujusvis generis cum gradibus
eorum.</p>
<p>Praecipue vero tentanda est inquisitio et inventio effectuum et
opificiorum caloris accedentis et recedentis graduatim, et ordinatim, et
periodice, et per debita spatia et moras. Ista enim inaequalitas
ordinata revera filia coeli est, et generationis mater; neque a calore
aut vehementi, aut praecipiti, aut subsultorio, aliquid magni
expectandum est. Etenim et in vegetabilibus hoc manifestissimum est;
atque etiam in uteris animalium magna est caloris inaequalitas, ex motu,
somno, alimentationibus et passionibus foemellarum quae uterum gestant;
denique in ipsis matricibus terrae, iis nimirum in quibus metalla et
fossilia efformantur, locum habet et viget ista inaequalitas. Quo magis
notanda est inscitia aliquorum alchymistarum ex reformatis, qui per
calores aequabiles lampadum et hujusmodi, perpetuo uno tenore ardentium,
se voti compotes fore existimarunt. Atque de opificiis et effectibus
caloris haec dicta sint. Neque vero tempestivum est illa penitus
scrutari, antequam rerum formae et corporum schematismi ulterius
investigati fuerint, et in lucem prodierint. Tum enim quaerenda et
adoperanda et aptanda sunt instrumenta, quando de exemplaribus
constiterit.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Quartus modus operandi est per moram, quae certe et promus et
condus naturae est, et quaedam dispensatrix. Moram appellamus, cum
corpus aliquod sibi permittitur ad tempus notabile, munitum interim et
defensum ab aliqua vi externa. Tum enim motus intestini se produnt et
perficiunt, cum motus extranei et adventitii cessant. Opera autem
aetatis sunt longe subtiliora quam ignis. Neque enim possit fieri talis
clarificatio vini per ignem, qualis fit per moram; neque etiam
incinerationes per ignem tam sunt exquisitae, quam resolutiones et
consumptiones per saecula. Incorporationes etiam, et mistiones subitae
et praecipitatae per ignem, longe inferiores sunt illis, quae fiunt per
moram. At dissimilares et varii schematismi, quos corpora per moras
tentant (quales sunt putredines), per ignem aut calorem vehementiorem
destruuntur. Illud interim non abs re fuerit notare; motus corporum
penitus conclusorum habere nonnihil ex violento. Incarceratio enim illa
impedit motus spontaneos corporis. Itaque mora in vase aperto plus facit
ad separationes; in vase penitus clauso ad commistiones; in vase
nonnihil clauso, sed subintrante aere, ad putrefactiones. Utcunque de
opificiis et effectibus morae undique sunt diligenter conquirendae
instantiae.</p></li>
<li><p>At regimen motus (quod est quintus ex modis operandi) non parum
valet. Regimen autem motus vocamus, cum corpus aliud occurrens corporis
alterius motum spontaneum impedit, repellit, admittit, dirigit. Hoc vero
plerunque in figuris et situ vasorum consistit. Etenim conus erectus
juvat ad condensationem vaporum in alembicis; at conus inversus juvat
defaecationem sacchari in vasis resupinatis. Aliquando autem sinuatio
requiritur, et angustiatio, et dilatatio per vices, et hujusmodi. Etiam
omnis percolatio huc spectat; scilicet cum corpus occurrens uni parti
corporis alterius viam aperit, alteri obstruit. Neque semper percolatio
aut aliud regimen motus fit per extra; sed etiam per corpus in corpore:
ut cum lapilli immittuntur in aquas ad colligendam limositatem ipsarum;
syrupi clarificantur cum albuminibus ovorum, ut crassiores partes
adhaerescant, et postea separari possint. Etiam huic regimini motus
satis leviter et inscite attribuit Telesius figuras animalium, ob
rivulos scilicet et loculos matricis. Debuerat autem notare similem
efformationem in testis ovorum, ubi non sunt rugae aut inaequalitas. At
verum est regimen motus efformationes perficere in modulis et
proplasticis.</p></li>
<li><p>Operationes vero per consensus aut fugas (qui sextus modus est)
latent saepenumero in profundo. Istae enim (quas vocant) proprietates
occultae, et specificae, et sympathiae, et antipathiae, sunt magna ex
parte corruptelae philosophiae. Neque de consensibus rerum inveniendis
multum sperandum est, ante inventionem formarum et schematismorum
simplicium. Consensus enim nil aliud est quam symmetria formarum et
schematismorum ad invicem.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Atqui majores et magis catholici rerum consensus non prorsus obscuri
sunt. Itaque ab iis ordiendum. Eorum prima et summa diversitas ea est;
ut quaedam corpora copia et raritate materiae admodum discrepent,
schematismis consentiant: alia contra copia et raritate materiae
consentiant, schematismis discrepent. Nam non male notatum est a
chymicis, in principiorum suorum triade, sulphur et mercurium quasi per
universitatem rerum permeare. (Nam de sale inepta ratio est, sed
introducta ut possit comprehendere corpora terrea, sicca, et fixa.) At
certe in illis duobus videtur consensus quidam naturae ex maxime
catholicis conspici. Etenim consentiunt sulphur; oleum, et exhalatio
pinguis; flamma; et fortasse corpus stellae. Ex altera parte consentiunt
mercurius; aqua et vapores aquei; aer; et fortasse aether purus et
interstellaris. Attamen istae quaterniones geminae, sive magnae rerum
tribus (utraque intra ordines suos), copia materiae atque densitate
immensum differunt, sed schematismo valde conveniunt; ut in plurimis se
produnt. At contra metalla diversa copia et densitate multum conveniunt
(praesertim respectu vegetabilium, etc.), sed schematismo multifariam
differunt; et similiter vegetabilia et animalia diversa schematismis
quasi infinitis variantur, sed intra copiam materiae sive densitatem
paucorum graduum continentur.</p>
<p>Sequitur consensus maxime post priorem catholicus, videlicet corporum
principalium et fomitum suorum; videlicet menstruorum, et alimentorum.
Itaque exquirendum, sub quibus climatibus, et in qua tellure, et ad quam
profunditatem metalla singula generentur; et similiter de gemmis, sive
ex rupibus, sive inter mineras natis; in qua gleba terrae, arbores
singulae, et frutices, et herbae potissimum proveniant, et tanquam
gaudeant; et insimul quae impinguationes, sive per stercorationes
cujuscunque generis, sive per cretam, arenam maris, cineres, etc.,
maxime juvent; et quae sint ex his pro varietate glebarum magis aptae et
auxiliares. Etiam insitio et inoculatio arborum et plantarum, earumque
ratio, quae scilicet plantae super quas foelicius inserantur, etc.,
multum pendet de consensu. In qua parte non injucundum foret
experimentum, quod noviter audivimus esse tentatum, de insitione arborum
sylvestrium (quae hucusque in arboribus hortensibus fieri consuevit),
unde folia et glandes majorem in modum amplificantur, et arbores fiunt
magis umbrosae. Similiter, alimenta animalium respective notanda sunt in
genere, et cum negativis. Neque enim carnivora sustinent herbis nutriri;
unde etiam Ordo Folitanorum (licet voluntas humana plus possit quam
animantium caeterorum super corpus suum), post experientiam factam (ut
aiunt), tanquam ab humana natura non tolerabilis, fere evanuit. Etiam
materiae diversae putrefactionum, unde animalcula generantur, notandae
sunt.</p>
<p>Atque consensus corporum principalium erga subordinata sua (tales
enim ii possint censeri quos notavimus) satis in aperto sunt. Quibus
addi possunt sensuum consensus erga objecta sua. Qui consensus, cum
manifestissimi sint, bene notati, et acriter excussi, etiam aliis
consensibus qui latent magnam praebere possint lucem.</p>
<p>At interiores corporum consensus et fugae, sive amicitiae et lites
(taedet enim nos fere vocabulorum sympathiae et antipathiae, propter
superstitiones et inania), aut falso ascriptae, aut fabulis conspersae,
aut per neglectum rarae admodum sunt. Etenim si quis asserat inter
vineam et brassicam esse dissidium, quia juxta sata minus laete
proveniunt, praesto ratio est: quod utraque planta succulenta sit et
depraedatrix, unde altera alteram defraudat. Si quis asserat esse
consensum et amicitiam inter segetes et cyaneum, aut papaver sylvestre,
quia herbae illae fere non proveniunt nisi in arvis cultis: debuit is
potius asserere dissidium esse inter ea, quia papaver et cyaneus
emittuntur et creantur ex tali succo terrae qualem segetes reliquerint
et repudiaverint; adeo ut satio segetum terram praeparet ad eorum
proventum. Atque hujusmodi falsarum ascriptionum magnus est numerus.
Quoad fabulas vero, illae omnino sunt exterminandae. Restat tenuis certe
copia eorum consensuum, qui certo probati sunt experimento; quales sunt
magnetis et ferri, atque auri et argenti vivi, et similium. At in
experimentis chymicis circa metalla inveniuntur et alii nonnulli
observatione digni. Maxima vero frequentia eorum (ut in tanta paucitate)
invenitur in medicinis nonnullis, quae, ex proprietatibus suis occultis
(quas vocant) et specificis, respiciunt aut membra, aut humores, aut
morbos, aut quandoque naturas individuas. Neque omittendi sunt consensus
inter motus et affectus lunae et passiones corporum inferiorum, prout ex
experimentis agriculturae, nauticae, et medicinae, aut alias cum delectu
severo et sincero colligi et recipi possint. Verum instantiae universae
consensuum secretiorum, quo magis sunt infrequentes, eo majori cum
diligentia sunt inquirendae, per traditiones, et narrationes fidas et
probas; modo hoc fiat absque ulla levitate, aut credulitate, sed fide
anxia et quasi dubitabunda. Restat consensus corporum modo operandi
tanquam inartificialis, sed usu polychrestus, qui nullo modo omittendus
est, sed sedula observatione investigandus. Is est coitio sive unio
corporum, proclivis aut difficilis, per compositionem, sive appositionem
simplicem. Etenim corpora nonnulla facile et libenter commiscentur et
incorporantur, alia autem aegre et perverse: veluti pulveres melius
incorporantur cum aquis; calces et cineres, cum oleis; et sic de
similibus. Neque tantum sunt colligendae instantiae propensionis aut
aversionis corporum erga misturam, sed etiam collocationis partium, et
distributionis, et digestionis, postquam commista sint; denique et
praedominantiae post misturam transactam.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Superest ultimo loco ex modis septem operandi septimus et postremus:
operatio scilicet per alternationem et vicissitudines priorum sex; de
quo antequam in singulos illos paulo altius fuerit inquisitum,
tempestivum non foret exempla proponere. Series autem sive catena
hujusmodi alternationis, prout ad singula effecta accommodari possit,
res est et cognitu maxime difficilis, et ad opera maxime valida. Summa

<p>Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco vicesimo septimo atque
ultimo Instantias Magicas. Hoc nomine illas appellamus, in quibus
materia aut efficiens tenuis aut parva est, pro magnitudine operis et
effectus qui sequitur; adeo ut etiamsi fuerint vulgares, tamen sint
instar miraculi; aliae primo intuitu, aliae etiam attentius
contemplanti. Has vero natura ex sese subministrat parce; quid vero
factura sit sinu excusso, et post inventionem formarum, et processuum,
et schematismorum, futuris temporibus apparebit. At ista effecta magica
(quantum adhuc conjicimus) fiunt tribus modis: aut per multiplicationem
sui, ut in igne, et venenis, quae vocant specifica; necnon in motibus,
qui transeunt et fortificantur de rota in rotam: aut per excitationem
sive invitationem in altero, ut in magnete, qui excit acus innumeras,
virtute nullatenus deperdita aut diminuta; aut in fermento, et
hujusmodi: aut per anteversionem motus, ut dictum est de pulvere pyrio,
et bombardis, et cuniculis: quorum priores duo modi indagationem
consensuum requirunt; tertius, mensurae motuum. Utrum vero sit aliquis
modus mutandi corpora per minima (ut vocant), et transponendi
subtiliores materiae schematismos (id quod ad omnimodas corporum
transformationes pertinet, ut ars brevi tempore illud facere possit,
quod natura per multas ambages molitur), de eo nulla hactenus nobis

<p>Atque de Dignitatibus sive Praerogativis Instantiarum haec dicta
sint. Illud vero monendum, nos in hoc nostro Organo tractare logicam,
non philosophiam. Sed cum logica nostra doceat intellectum et erudiat ad
hoc, ut non tenuibus mentis quasi claviculis rerum abstracta captet et
prenset (ut logica vulgaris), sed naturam revera persecet, et corporum
virtutes et actus eorumque leges in materia determinatas inveniat; ita
ut non solum ex natura mentis, sed ex natura rerum quoque haec scientia
emanet: mirum non est, si ubique naturalibus contemplationibus et

<h2 id="history-of-the-reign-of-king-henry-vii">History of the Reign of
King Henry VII</h2>
<p>AFTER that Richard the Third of that Name, King in Fact only, but
Tyrant both in Title and Regiment, and so commonly termed and reputed in
all times since, was by the Divine Revenge, favouring the Design of an
Exil’d man, overthrown and slain at Bosworth-field: There succeeded in
the Kingdom the Earl of Richmond, thence-forth stiled Henry the Seventh.
The King immediately after the Victory, as one that had been bred under
a devout Mother, and was in his nature, a great observer of Religious
Forms, caused Te Deum Laudamus to be solemnly sung in the presence of
the whole Army upon the place, and was himself with general Applause,
and great Cries of Joy, in a kind of Militar Election, or Recognition,
saluted King. Mean-while the Body of Richard, after many Indignities and
Reproaches (the Dirigies and Obsequies of the common People towards
Tyrants) was obscurely Buried. For though the King of his Nobleness gave
charge unto the Fryers of Leicester to see an Honourable Interrment to
be given to it, yet the Religious people themselves (being not free from
the Humours of the Vulgar) neglected it; wherein nevertheless they did
not then incurr any mans blame or Censure. No man thinking any Ignominy
or Contumely unworthy of him, that had been the Executioner of King
Henry the Sixth (that innocent Prince) with his own hands; the Contriver
of the death of the Duke of Clarence, his Brother; the Murderer of his
two Nephews (one of them his Lawfull King in the Present, and the other
in the Future failing of him) and vehemently suspected to have been the
Impoisoner of his Wife, thereby to make vacant his Bed, for a Marriage
within the Degrees forbidden. And although he were a Prince in Militar
Virtue approved, jealous of the Honour of the English Nation, and
likewise a good Law-maker, for the ease and solace of the common People:
yet his Cruelties and Parricides, in the Opinion of all men, weighed
down his Virtues and Merits; and in the opinion of Wise men, even those
Virtues themselves were conceived to be rather feigned, and affected
things to serve his Ambition, than Qualities ingenrate in his Judgement
or Nature. And therefore it was noted by men of great Understanding,
(who seeing his after Acts, looked back upon his former Proceedings)
that even in the time of King Edward his Brother, he was not without
secret Trains and Mines to turn Envy and Hatred upon his Brother’s
Government; as having an Expectation and a kind of Divination, that the
King, by reason of his many Disorders, could not be of long Life, but
was like to leave his Sonnes of tender years; and then he knew well, how
easie a step it was, from the place of a Protector, and first Prince of
the Blood, to the Crown. And that out of this deep root of Ambition it
sprang, that as well at the Treaty of Peace that passed between Edward
the Fourth, and Lewis the Eleventh of France, concluded by Enterview of
both Kings at Piqueny, as upon all other Occasions, Richard then Duke of
Glocester, stood ever upon the side of Honour, raising his own
Reputation to the disadvantage of the King his Brother, and drawing the
eyes of all (specially of the Nobles and Soldiers) upon himself; as if
the King by his voluptuous Life and mean Marriage, were become
Effeminate, and less sensible of Honour, and Reason of State, than was
fit for a King. And as for the Politique and wholesom Laws which were
Enacted in his Time, they were interpreted to be but the Brocage of an
Usurper, thereby to wooe, and winne the Hearts of the People; as being
conscious to himself that the true Obligations of Soveraignty in him
failed, and were wanting. But King Henry in the very entrance of his
Reign, and the instant of time, when the Kingdom was cast into his Arms,
met with a Point of great difficulty, and knotty to solve, able to
trouble and confound the Wisest King in the newness of his Estate; and
so much the more, because it could not endure a Deliberation, but must
be at once deliberated and determined. There were fallen to his Lot, and
concurrent to his Person, three several Titles to the Imperial Crown:
The first, the Title of the Lady Elizabeth, with whom, by precedent Pact
with the Party that brought him in, he was to Marry. The second, the
Antient and long disputed Title (both by Plea and Arms) of the House of
Lancaster, to which he was Inheritour in his own Person. The third, the
Title of the Sword or Conquest, for that he came in by Victory of
Battel, and that the King in possession was slain in the field. The
first of these was fairest, and most like to give contentment to the
People, who by Two and twenty Years Reign of King Edward the Fourth, had
been fully made capable of the clearness of the Title of the White-Rose
or House of York; and by the milde and plausible Reign of the same King
toward his latter time, were become affectionate to that Line. But then
it lay plain before his Eyes, that if he relyed upon that Title, he
could be but a King at Curtesie, and have rather a Matrimonial than a
Regal Power: the Right remaining in his Queen, upon whose decease,
either with Issue, or without Issue, he was to give place, and be
removed. And though he should obtain by Parliament to be continued, yet
he knew there was a very great difference between a King that holdeth
his Crown by a civil Act of Estates, and one that holdeth it Originally
by the Law of Nature, and Descent of Blood. Neither wanted there even at
that time secret Rumors and whisperings (which afterwards gathered
strength, and turned to great Troubles) that the two young Sons of King
Edward the Fourth, or one of them (which were said to be destroyed in
the Tower) were not indeed Murthered, but conveyed secretly away, and
were yet living: which if it had been true, had prevented the Title of
the Lady Elizabeth. On the other side, if he stood upon his own Title of
the House of Lancaster, inherent in his Person; he knew it was a Title
condemned by Parliament, and generally prejudged in the common Opinion
of the Realm, and that it tended directly to the Dis-inherison of the
Line of York, held then the indubiate Heirs of the Crown. So that if he
should have no Issue by the Lady Elibabeth, which should be Descendents
of the Double-Line, then the Ancient flames of Discord and Intestine
Wars, upon the Competition of both Houses, would again return and
revive.</p>
<p>As for Conquest notwithstanding, Sir William Stanly, after some
Acclamations of the Soldiers in the Field, had put a Crown of Ornament
(which Richard wore in the Battel, and was found amongst the Spoils)
upon King Henry’s Head, as if there were his chief Title; yet he
remembred well upon what Conditions and Agreements he was brought in,
and that to claim as Conqueror, was to put as well his own Party, as the
rest, into Terrour and Fear; as that which gave him Power of
Disannulling of Laws, and disposing of Mens Fortunes and Estates, and
the like points of Absolute Power, being in themselves so harsh and
odious, as that William himself, commonly called the Conqueror, however
he used and exercised the Power of a Conqueror, to reward his Normans,
yet he forbare to use that Claim in the beginning, but mixed it with a
Titulary pretence grounded upon the Will and Designation of Edward the
Confessor. But the King out of the greatness of his own mind, presently
cast the Die, and the Inconveniences appearing unto him on all parts;
and knowing there could not be any Interreign or suspension of Title;
and preferring his Affection to his own Line and Blood, and liking that
Title best which made him independent; and being in his Nature and
constitution of Mind not very apprehensive or forecasting of future
Events a-far off, but an Entertainer of Fortune by the Day; resolved to
rest upon the Title of Lancaster as the Main, and to use the other two,
that of Marriage, and that of Battel, but as Supporters, the one to
appease secret Discontents, and the other to beat down open murmur and
dispute: Not forgetting that the same Title of Lancaster had formerly
maintained a possession of three Descents in the Crown, and might have
proved a Perpetuity, had it not ended in the weakness and inability of
the last Prince. Whereupon the King presently that very day, being the
Two and Twentieth of August, assumed the Stile of King in his own name,
without mentioning of the Lady Elizabeth at all, or any relation
thereunto. In which course he ever after persisted, which did spin him a
Thread of many Seditions and Troubles. The King full of these thoughts,
before his departure from Leicester, dispatched Sir Robert Willoughby to
the Castle of Sheriff-Hutton in Torkshire, where were kept in safe
Custody by King Richard’s commandment, both the Lady Elizabeth Daughter
of King Edward, and Edward Plantagenet, Son and Heir to George Duke of
Clarence. This Edward was by the King’s Warrant delivered from the
Constable of the Castle to the hand of Sir Robert Willoughby; and by him
with all safety and diligence conveyed to the Tower of London, where he
was shut up Close-prisoner. Which Act of the King’s (being an Act meerly
of Policy and Power) proceeded not so much from any apprehension he had
of Doctor Shaw’s Tale at Paul’s Cross, for the Bastarding of Edward the
Fourth’s Issues, in which case this young Gentleman was to succeed, (for
that Fable was ever exploded) but upon a setled disposition to depress
all Eminent Persons of the Line of Tork. Wherein still the King out of
strength of Will, or weakness of Judgement, did use to shew a little
more of the Party, than of the King.</p>
<p>For the Lady Elizabeth she received also a direction to repait with
all convenient speed to London, and there to remain with the Queen
Dowager her Mother; which accordingly she soon after did, accompanied
with many. Noble-men and Ladies of Honour. In the mean season the King
set forwards by easie Journeys to the City of London, receiving the
Acclamations and Applauses of the People as he went, which indeed were
true and unfeigned, as might well appear in the very Demonstrations and
fulness of the Cry. For they thought generally that he was a Prince as
ordained and sent down from Heaven, to unite and put to an end to the
long Dissentions of the two Houses, which although they had had in the
times of Henry the Fourth, Henry the Fifth, and a part of Henry the
Sixth on the one side, and the times of Edward the Fourth on the other,
Lucid-Intervalls and happy Pauses; yet they did ever hang over the
Kingdom, ready to break forth into new Perturbations and Calamities. And
as his Victory gave him the Knee, so his purpose of Marriage with the
Lady Elizabeth gave him the Heart; so that both Knee and Heart did truly
bow before him.</p>
<p>He on the other side, with great Wisdom, (not ignorant of the
Affections and Fears of the People) to disperse the conceit and terrour
of a Conquest, had given Order that there should be nothing in his
Journey like unto a Warlike March, or manner: but rather like unto the
Progress of a King in full Peace and Assurance.</p>
<p>He entred the City upon a Saturday, as he had also obtained the
Victory upon a Saturday, which Day of the Week first upon an
Observation, and after upon Memory and Fancy, he accounted and chose as
a Day prosperous unto him.</p>
<p>The Mayor and Companies of the City received him at Shoreditch:
whence, with great and Honorable attendance and troops of Noble-men, and
Persons of Quality he entred the City; himself not being on Horse-back,
or in any open Chair, or Throne, but in a close Chariot, as one that
having been sometimes an Enemy to the whole State, and a Proscribed
person, chose rather to keep State, and strike a Reverence into the
People, than to fawn upon them.</p>
<p>He went first into Saint Paul’s Church, where not meaning that the
People should forget too soon that he came in by Battel, he made an
Offertory of his Standards, and had Orizon and Te Deum again sung, and
went to his Lodging prepared in the Bishop of London’s Palace, where he
stayed for a time.</p>
<p>During his abode there, he Assembled his Council, and other principal
Persons, in presence of whom, he did renew again his promise to marry
with the Lady Elizabeth. This he did the rather, because having at his
coming out of Britain given artificially, for serving of his own turn,
some hopes, in case he obtained the Kingdome, to Marry Anne Inheritress
to the Dutchy of Britain, whom Charles the Eighth of France soon after
Married. It bred some doubt and suspition amongst divers, that he was
not sincere, or at least not fixed in going on with the Match of England
so much desired: which Conceit also, though it were but Talk and
Discourse, did much afflict the poor Lady Elizabeth her self. But
howsoever he both truly intended it, and desired also it should be so
believed, (the better to extinguish Envy and Contradiction to his other
purposes) yet was he resolved in himself not to proceed to the
Consummation thereof, till his Coronation and a Parliament were past.
The one, lest a joynt-Coronation of himself and his Queen might give any
countenance of Participation of Title: The other, lest in the Intayling
of the Crown to himself, which he hoped to obtain by Parliament, the
Votes of the Parliament might any ways reflect upon her.</p>
<p>About this time in Autumn, towards the end of September, there began
and reigned in the City and other parts of the Kingdom a Disease then
new; which of the Accidents, and manner thereof, they called the
Sweating-Sickness. This Disease had a swift course both in the Sick-Body
and in the Time and Period of the lasting thereof: for they that were
taken with it, upon Four and twenty Hours escaping were thought almost
assured. And as to the Time of the malice and reign of the Disease e’re
it ceased; It began about the One and twentieth of September, and
cleared up before the end of October, insomuch that it was no hinderance
to the King’s Coronation, which was the last of October: nor (which was
more) to the holding of the Parliament, which began but seven days
after. It was a Pestilent-Feaver, but, as it seemeth, not seated in the
Veins or Humors, for that there followed no Carbuncle, no purple or
livid Spots, or the like, the Mass of the Body being not tainted: only a
malign Vapour flew to the Heart, and seised the Vital Spirits; which
stirred Nature to strive to send it forth by an extreme Sweat. And it
appeared by Experience that this Disease was rather a Surprize of
Nature, than obstinate to Remedies, if it were in time looked unto. For
if the Patient were kept in an equal temper, both for Clothes, Fire, and
Drink, moderately warm, with temperate Cordials, whereby Natures work
were neither irritated by Heat, nor turned back by Cold, he commonly
Recovered. But infinite Persons dyed suddenly of it, before the manner
of the Cure and attendance was known. It was conceived not to be an
Epidemick Disease, but to proceed from a Malignity in the Constitution
of the Air, gathered by the predispositions of Seasons: and the speedy
Cessation declared as much.</p>
<p>On Simon and Jude’s Even the King dined with Thomas Bourcchier,
Arch-Bishop of Canterbury and Cardinal: and from Lambeth went by Land
over the Bridge to the Tower, where the morrow after he made Twelve
Knights-Bannerets. But for Creations he dispensed them with a sparing
Hand. For notwithstanding a Field so lately fought, and a Coronation so
near at hand, he only created Three: James Earl of Pembrook (the King’s
Uncle) was created Duke of Bedford; Thomas the Lord Stanley (the King’s
Father-in-Law) Earl of Derby; and Edward Courtney Earl of Devon; though
the King had then nevertheless a purpose in himself to make more in time
of Parliament; bearing a wise and decent respect to Distribute his
Creations, some to honour his Coronation, and some his Parliament.</p>
<p>The Coronation followed two days after upon the Thirtyeth day of
October in the year of our Lord 1485. At which time Innocent the Eighth
was Pope of Rome, Frederick the Third, Emperour of Almaine; and
Maximilian his Son newly chosen King of the Romans; Charles the Eighth,
King of France; Ferdinando and Isabella, Kings of Spain; and James the
Third, King of Scotland: with all which Kings and States, the King was
at that time in good Peace and Amity. At which Day also (as if the Crown
upon his Head, had put Perils into his Thoughts) he did institute sor
the better Security of his Person a Band of Fifty Archers under a
Captain to attend him, by the name of Yeomen of his Guard: and yet that
it might be thought to be rather a matter of Dignity, after the
imitation of that he had known abroad, than any matter of Diffidence
appropriate to his own Case, he made it to be understood for an
Ordinance not Temporary, but to hold in Succession for ever after.</p>
<p>The Seventh of November the King held his Parliament at Westmister,
which he had Summoned immediately after his coming to London. His Ends
in calling a Parliament (and that so speedily) were chiefly three;
First, to procure the Crown to be entayled upon himself. Next, to have
the Attaindors of all of his Party (which were in no small Number)
reversed, and all Acts of Hostility by them done in his Quarrel,
remitted and discharged: and on the other side, to attaint by
Parliament, the Heads and Principals of his Enemies. The Third, to calm
and quiet the fears of the rest of that Party by a General Pardon: not
being ignorant in how great danger a King stands from his Subjects, when
most of his Subjects are conscious in themselves, that they stand in his
danger. Unto these three special Motives of a Parliament was added, that
he as a prudent and moderate Prince, made this Judgement; That it was
fit for him to hasten to let his People see, that he meant to govern by
Law, howsoever he came in by the Sword: and fit also to reclaim them to
know him for their King, whom they had so lately talked of as an Enemy
or Banished man. For that which concerned the Entayling of the Crown;
(more than that he was true in his own Will, that he would not endure
any mention of the Lady Elizabeth: no not in the nature of
Special-Intail,) he carried it otherwise with great Wisdom and measure.
For he did not press to have the Act penned by way of Declaration or
Recognition of Right: as on the other side, he avoided to have it by new
Law or Ordinance; but chose rather a kind of middle-way, by way of
Establishment, and that under covert and indifferent words; That the
inheritance of the Crown should rest, remain, and abide in the King,
andandandandc. which words might equally be applied; That the Crown
should continue to him: but whether as having former Right to it, (which
was doubtful,) or having it then in Fact and Possession, (which no man
denyed,) was left fair to Interpretation either way. And again for the
limitation of the Entail, he did not press it to go further than to
himself and to the Heirs of his Body, not speaking of his right Heirs;
but leaving that to the Law to decide: so as the Entail might seem
rather a personal Favour to him and his Children, than a total
Dis-inherison to the House of York. And in this form was the Law drawn
and passed. Which Statute he procured to be confirmed by the Pope’s Bull
the year following, with mention nevertheless (by way of Recital) of his
other Titles; both of Descent and Conquest. So as now the wreath of
Three was made a wreath of Five, for to the three first Titles of the
two Houses, or Lines, and Conquest, were added two more; the Authorities
Parliamentary and Papal.</p>
<p>The King likewise in the Reversal of the Attaindors of his Partakers,
and discharging them of all Offences incident to his service and
succour, had his Will: and Acts did pass accordingly. In the passage
whereof, exception was taken to divers Persons in the House of Commons,
for that they were Attainted, and thereby not legal, nor habilitate to
serve in Parliament, being disabled in the highest degree; And that it
should be a great incongruity to have them to make Laws, who themselves
were not Inlawed. The truth was, that divers of those which had in the
time of King Richard been strongest and most declared for the King’s
Party, were returned Knights and Burgesses for the Parliament, whether
by care or recommendation from the State, or the voluntary inclination
of the People: many of which had been by Richard the Third attainted by
Outlawries, or otherwise. The King was somewhat troubled with this. For
though it had a grave and specious Shew, yet it reflected upon his
Party. But wisely not shewing himself at all moved therewith, he would
not understand it but as a Case of Law; and wished the Judges to be
advised thereupon: who for that purpose were forthwith Assembled in the
Exchequer-Chamber, (which is the Council-Chamber of the Judges,) and
upon deliberation they gave a grave and safe Opinion and Advice, mixed
with Law and Convenience; which was, That the Knights and Burgesses
attainted by the course of Law, should forbear to come into the House,
’till a Law were passed for the Reversal of their Attaindors.</p>
<p>It was at that time incidently moved amongst the Judges in their
Consultation, what should be done for the King himself, who likewise was
attainted; But it was with unanimous consent Resolved; That the Crown
takes away all defects and stops in Blood: and that from the time the
King did assume the Crown, the Fountain was cleared, and all Attaindors
and Corruption of Blood discharged. But nevertheless for Honours sake it
was Ordained by Parliament, that all Records wherein there was any
memory, or mention of the King’s Attaindor, should be defaced,
cancelled, and taken off the File.</p>
<p>But on the part of the King’s Enemies there were by Parliament
attainted; the late Duke of Glocester, calling himself Richard the
Third, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Surrey, Viscount Lovel, the Lord
Ferrers, the Lord Zouch, Richard Ratcliff, William Catesby, and many
others of degree and quality. In which Bills of Attaindors, nevertheless
there were contained many just and temperate Clauses, Savings and
Proviso’s, well shewing and foretokening the Wisdom, Stay, and
Moderation of the King’s Spirit of Government. And for the Pardon of the
rest, that had stood against the King; the King, upon a second advice,
thought it not fit it should pass by Parliament, the better (being
matter of Grace) to impropriate the Thanks to himself: using only the
Opportunity of a Parliament time, the better to disperse it into the
Veins of the Kingdom. Therefore during the Parliament, he Published his
Royal Proclamation, offering Pardon and Grace of Restitution, to all
such as had taken Arms, or been participant of any Attempts against him;
so as they submitted themselves to his Mercy by a Day, and took the Oath
of Allegiance and Fidelity to him. Whereupon many came out of Sanctuary,
and many more came out of Fear, no less guilty than those that had taken
Sanctuary.</p>
<p>As for Money or Treasure; the King thought it not seasonable, or fit
to demand any of his Subjects at this Parliament: both because he had
received satisfaction from them in matters of so great Importance, and
because he could not remunerate them with any General Pardon, being
prevented therein by the CoronationPardon, passed immediately before:
but chiefly, for that it was in every mans Eye, what great Forfeitures
and Confiscations he had at that present to help himself: Whereby those
Casualties of the Crown might in reason spare the Purses of his
Subjects; especially in a time when he was in Peace with all his
Neighbours. Some few Laws passed at that Parliament, almost for form
sake: amongst which there was One, to reduce Aliens, being made
Denizens, to pay Strangers Customs; and another, to draw to himself the
Seisures and Compositions of Italian Goods, for not employment, being
Points of Profit to his Coffers, whereof from the very Beginning he was
not forgetful; and had been more happy at the Latter End, if his early
Providence (which kept him from all necessity of Exacting upon his
People) could likewise have attemp’red his nature therein. He added
during Parliament, to his former Creations, the Innoblement or
Advancement in Nobility of a few others: The Lord Chandos of Britain,
was made Earl of Bath; and Sir Giles Dawbeny was made Lord Dawbeny; and
Sir Robert Willoughby Lord Brook.</p>
<p>The King did also with great Nobleness and Bounty (which Virtues at
that time had their turns in his Nature) restore Edward Stafford (eldest
Son to Henry, Duke of Buckingham, attainted in the time of King
Richard,) not only to his Dignities, but to his Fortunes and
Possessions, which were great; to which he was moved also by a kind of
Gratitude, for that the Duke was the man that moved the first Stone
against the Tyranny of King Richard, and indeed made the King a Bridge
to the Crown upon his own Ruins. Thus the Parliament brake up.</p>
<p>The Parliament being dissolved, the King sent forthwith Money to
redeem the Marquess Dorset, and Sir John Bourchier, whom he had left as
his Pledges at Paris, for Money which he had borrowed, when he made his
Expedition for England. And thereupon he took a fit occasion to send the
Lord Treasurer and Master Bray (whom he used as Counsellor) to the Lord
Mayor of London, requiring of the City a Prest of six thousand Marks:
But after many Parlees, he could obtain but two thousand Pounds. Which
nevertheless the King took in good part; as men use to do, that practise
to borrow Money when they have no need. About this time, the King called
unto his PrivyCouncil, John Morton, and Richard Fox, the one Bishop of
Ely, the other Bishop of Exceter, vigilant men, and secret, and such as
kept watch with him almost upon all men else. They had been both versed
in his Affairs before he came to the Crown, and were partakers of his
adverse Fortune. This Morton soon after upon the death of Bourchier’, he
made Archbishop of Canterbury. And for Fox, he made him Lord Keeper of
his Privy-Seal, and afterwards advanced him by Degrees, from Exceter to
Bath and Wells, thence to Durham, and last to Winchester. For although
the King loved to employ and advance Bishops, because having rich
Bishopricks they carried their Reward upon themselves: yet he did use to
raise them by steps; that he might not lose the profit of the
First-fruits, which by that course of Gradation was multiplied.</p>
<p>At last, upon the Eighteenth of January was Solemnized the so long
expected and so much desired Marriage, between the King and the Lady
Elizabeth: which Day of Marriage was celebrated with greater Triumph,
and Demonstrations (especially on the Peoples part) of Joy and Gladness,
than the days either of his Entry, or Coronation; which the King rather
noted, than liked. And it is true, that all his life time, while the
Lady Elizabeth lived with him, (for she dyed before him) he shewed
himself no very indulgent Husband towards her, though she was beautiful,
gentle, and fruitful. But his aversion towards the House of York was so
predominant in him, as it found place, not only in his Wars and
Councils, but in his Chamber and Bed.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the Spring, the King, full of confidence and
assurance, as a Prince that had been Victorious in Battel, and had
prevailed with his Parliament in all that he desired, and had the Ring
of Acclamations fresh in his Ears, thought the rest of his Reign should
be but Play, and the enjoying of a Kingdom. Yet as a wise and watchful
King, he would not neglect any thing for his Safety; thinking
nevertheless to perform all things now, rather as an Exercise, than as a
Labour. So he being truly informed, that the Northern parts were not
only Affectionate to the House of York, but particularly had been
Devoted to King Richard the Third, thought it would be a Summer well
spent to visit those Parts, and by his presence and application of
himself, to reclaim and rectifie those Humours. But the King, in his
accompt of Peace, and Calms, did much overcast his Fortunes, which
proved for many Years together full of Broken Seas, Tides, and Tempests.
For he was no sooner come to Lincoln, where he kept his Easter, but he
received news, that the Lord Lovel, Humphrey Stafford, and Thomas
Stafford (who had formerly taken Sanctuary at Colchester) were departed
out of Sanctuary, but to what place, no man could tell. Which
advertisement, the King despised, and continued his Journey to York. At
York there came fresh. and more certain advertisement, that the Lord
Lovel was at hand with a great power of men, and that the Staffords were
in Arms in Worcestershire, and had made their approaches to the City of
Worcester, to assail it. The King, as a Prince of great and profound
Judgement, was not much moved with it; for that he thought it was but a
Ragg or Remnant of Bosworth-Field, and had nothing in it of the main
Party of the House of York. But he was more doubtful of the raising of
Forces to resist the Rebels, than of the Resistance it self; for that he
was in a Core of People, whose affections he suspected. But the Action
enduring no delay, he did speedily levy and sent against the Lord Lovel
to the number of three thousand men, ill armed, but well assured, (being
taken some few out of his own Train, and the rest out of the Tenants and
Followers of such as were safe to be trusted,) under the Conduct of the
Duke of Bedford. And as his manner was to send his Pardons rather before
the Sword than after, he gave Commission to the Duke, to proclaim Pardon
to all that would come in: Which the Duke, upon his approach to the Lord
Lovel’s Camp, did perform. And it fell out as the King expected; the
Heralds were the GreatOrdnance. For the Lord Lovel, upon Proclamation of
Pardon, mistrusting his men, fled into Lancashire, and lurking for a
time with Sir Thomas Broughton, after sailed over into Flanders, to the
Lady Margaret. And his men, forsaken of their Captain, did presently
submit themselves to the Duke. The Staffords likewise, and their Forces,
hearing what had happened to the Lord Lovel (in whose Success their
chief Trust was) despaired, and dispersed. The two Brothers, taking
Sanctuary at Colnham, a Village near Abington; which Place, upon view of
their Priviledge in the King’s Bench, being judged no sufficient
Sanctuary for Traytors, Humphrey was Executed at Tyburn; and Thomas, as
being led by his elder Brother, was Pardoned. So this Rebellion proved
but a Blast; and the King having by this Journey purged a little the
Dregs and Leaven of the Northern People, that were before in no good
affection towards him, returned to London.</p>
<p>In September following, the Queen was delivered of her first Son,
whom the King (in Honour of the British-Race, of which himself was)
named Arthur, according to the Name of that ancient worthy King of the
Britains; in whose Acts there is truth enough to make him Famous,
besides that which is Fabulous. The Child was strong and able, though he
was Born in the eighth Month, which Physicians do prejudge.</p>
<p>THere followed this Year, being the Second of the King’s Reign, a
strange Accident of State, whereof the Relations which we have, are so
naked, as they leave it scarce credible; not for the nature of it, (for
it hath fallen out oft,) but for the manner and circumstance of it,
especially in the beginnings. Therefore we shall make our Judgement upon
the things themselves, as they give light one to another, and (as we
can) dig Truth out of the Mine. The King was green in his Estate; and
contrary to his own Opinion, and Desert both, was not without much
Hatred throughout the Realm. The root of all, was the discountenancing
of the House of York, which the general Body of the Realm still
affected. This did alienate the Hearts of the Subjects from him dayly
more and more, especially when they saw, that after his Marriage, and
after a Son born, the King did nevertheless not so much as proceed to
the Coronation of the Queen, not vouchsafing her the Honour of a
Matrimonial Crown; for the Coronation of Her was not ’till almost two
Years after, when Danger had taught him what to do. But much more, when
it was spread abroad (whether by Errour, or the cunning of
Male-contents) that the King had a purpose to put to death Edward
Plantagenet closely in the Tower: Whose case was so neerly parallel’d
with that of Edward the Fourth’s Children, in respect of the blood, like
age, and the very place of the Tower, as it did refresh and reflect upon
the King a most odious resemblance, as if he would be another King
Richard. And all this time it was still whispered every where, that at
least one of the Children of Edward the Fourth was living. Which Bruit
was cunningly fomented by such as desired Innovation. Neither was the
King’s nature and customs greatly fit to disperse these Mists; but
contrary-wise he had a fashion rather to create Doubts, than Assurance.
Thus was Fuel prepared for the Spark: the Spark that afterwards kindled
such a Fire, and Combustion, was at the first contemptible.</p>
<p>There was a subtil Priest called Richard Simon, that lived in Oxford,
and had to his Pupil a Baker’s Son named Lambert Simnel, of the age of
some Fifteen years; a comely Youth, and wellfavoured, not without some
extraordinary dignity and grace of Aspect. It came into this Priest’s
fancy (hearing what men talked, and in hope to raise himself to some
great Bishoprick,) to cause this Lad to counterfeit and Personate the
second Son of Edward the Fourth, supposed to be murthered; and afterward
(for he changed his intention in the manage) the Lord Edward Plantagenet
then Prisoner in the Tower, and accordingly to frame him and instruct
him in the Part he was to play. This is that which (as was touched
before) seemeth scarcely credible: Not that a false Person should be
assumed to gain a Kingdom, for it hath been seen in antient and late
times; nor that it should come into the mind of such an abject Fellow,
to enterprise so great a matter for high Conceits do sometime come
streaming into the Imaginations of base persons, especially when they
are drunk with News and Talk of the People. But here is that which hath
no apparance; That this Priest being utterly unacquainted with the true
Person, according to whose pattern he should shape his Counterfeit,
should think it possible for him to instruct his Player, either in
gesture and fashions, or in recounting past matters of his Life and
Education; or to fit Answers to Questions, or the like, any ways to come
near the Resemblance of him whom he was to represent. For this Lad was
not to personate one, that had been long before taken out of his Cradle,
or conveyed away in his Infancy, known to few; but a Youth that ’till
the age almost of Ten years had been brought up in a Court where
infinite Eyes had been upon him. For King Edward touched with remorse of
his Brother the Duke of Clarence’s Death, would not indeed restore his
Son, (of whom we speak) to be Duke of Clarence, but yet created him Earl
of Warwick, reviving his Honour on the Mothers side, and used him
honorably during his time, though Richard the Third afterwards confined
him. So that it cannot be, but that some great Person, that knew
particularly, and familiarly Edward Plantagenet, had a hand in the
business, from whom the Priest might take his aim. That which is most
probable, out of the precedent and subsequent Acts, is, that it was the
Queen Dowager, from whom this Action had the principal source and
motion. For certain it is, she was a busie negotiating Woman, and in her
withdrawing-Chamber had the fortunate Conspiracy for the King against
King Richard the Third, been hatched; which the King knew, and remembred
perhaps but too well; and was at this time extremely discontent with the
King, thinking her Daughter (as the King handled the matter) not
advanced, but depressed: and none could hold the Book so well to prompt
and instruct this Stage-play, as she could. Nevertheless it was not her
meaning; nor no more was it the meaning of any of the better and sager
sort that favoured the Enterprize and knew the Secret, that this
disguised Idol should possess the Crown; but at his peril to make way to
the Overthrow of the King: and that done, they had their several Hopes
and Ways. That which doth chiefly fortifie this Conjecture, is, that as
soon as the matter brake forth in any strength, it was one of the King’s
first Acts to cloister the Queen Dowager in the Nunnery of Bermonsey,
and to take away all her Lands and Estate; and this by close Council
without any Legal proceeding, upon far-fetcht Pretences; That she had
delivered her two Daughters out of Sanctuary to King Richard, contrary
to promise. Which Proceeding being even at that time taxed for rigorous
and undue, both in-matter and manner, makes it very probable there was
some greater matter against her, which the King upon reason of Policy,
and to avoid Envy would not publish. It is likewise no small Argument
that there was some Secret in it, and some suppressing of Examinations;
for that the Priest Simon himself, after he was taken, was never brought
to Execution, no not so much as to publick Tryal, (as many Clergy-men
were upon less Treasons,) but was only shut up close in a Dungeon. Add
to this, that after the Earl of Lincoln (a principal Person of the House
of York) was slain in Stoke-field, the King opened himself to some of
his Council, that he was sorry for the Earl’s Death, because by him (he
said) he might have known the bottom of his Danger.</p>
<p>But to return to the Narration it self; Simon did first instruct his
Scholar for the part of Richard Duke of York, second Son to King Edward
the Fourth, and this was at such time as it was voyced that the King
purposed to put to Death Edward Plantagenet Prisoner in the Tower,
whereat there was great murmur. But hearing soon after a general bruit
that Plantagenet had escaped out of the Tower, and thereby finding him
so much beloved amongst the People, and such rejoycing at his Escape,
the cunning Priest changed his Copy, and chose now Plantagenet to be the
Subject his Pupil should personate, because he was more in the present
speech, and Votes of the People; and it pieced better, and followed more
close and handsomly upon the bruit of Plantagenet’s Escape. But yet
doubting that there would be too near looking and too much Perspective
into his Disguise; if he should shew it here in England; he thought good
(after the manner of Scenes in Stage-Plays and Masques) to shew it
a-far-off; and therefore sailed with his Scholar into Ireland, where the
Affection to the House of York was most in height. The King had been a
little Improvident in matters of Ireland, and had not removed Officers
and Chancellors, and put in their places, or at least intermingled
persons, of whom he stood assured, as he should have done, since he knew
the strong Bent of that Countrey towards the House of York; and that it
was a ticklish and unsetled State, more easie to receive distempers and
mutations, than England was. But trusting to the reputation of his
Victories and Successes in England, he thought he should have time
enough to extend his Cares afterwards to that second Kingdom.</p>
<p>Wherefore through this neglect, upon the coming of Simon with his
pretended Plantagenet into Ireland, all things were prepared for Revolt
and Sedition, almost as if they had been set and plotted before-hand.
Simon’s first Address was to the Lord Thomas Fitz-Gerard, Earl of
Kildare, and Deputy of Ireland: before whose Eyes he did cast such a
Mist, (by his own insinuation, and by the carriage of his Youth, that
expressed a natural Princely Behaviour;) as joyned perhaps with some
inward Vapours of Ambition and Affection in the Earl’s own mind, left
him fully possessed, that it was the true Plantagenet. The Earl
presently communicated the matter with some of the Nobles and others
there, at the first secretly. But finding them of like Affection to
himself, he suffered it of purpose to vent and pass abroad; because they
thought it not safe to resolve, till they had a tast of the Peoples
Inclination. But if the Great ones were in forwardness, the People were
in fury, entertaining this Airy Body or Phantasm with incredible
affection; partly out of their great devotion to the House of York;
partly out of a proud humour in the Nation, to give a King to the Realm
of England. Neither did the Party in this heat of affection much trouble
themselves with the Attaindor of George Duke of Clarence; having newly
learned by the King’s example, that Attaindors do not interrupt the
conveying of Title to the Crown. And as for the Daughters of King Edward
the Fourth, they thought King Richard had said enough for them: and took
them to be but as of the King’s Party, because they were in his power,
and at his disposing. So that with marvellous consent and applause, this
Counterfeit Plantagenet was brought with great Solemnity to the Castle
of Dublin, and there saluted, served and honoured as King; the Boy
becoming it well, and doing nothing that did bewray the baseness of his
condition. And within few days after he was proclaimed King in Dublin,
by the Name of King Edward the Sixth; there being not a Sword drawn in
King Henry his Quarrel.</p>
<p>The King was much moved with this unexpected Accident, when it came
to his Ears, both because it strook upon that String which ever he most
, as also because it was stirred in such a Place, where he could not
with safety transfer his own Person, to suppress it. For partly through
natural Valour, and partly through an universal Suspition (not knowing
whom to trust) he was ever ready to wait upon all his Atchievements in
person. The King therefore first called his Council together at the
Charterhouse at Shine. Which Council was held with great secresie, but
the open Decrees thereof, which presently came abroad, were three.</p>
<p>The first was, That the Queen Dowager, for that she contrary to her
Pact and Agreement with those that had concluded with her concerning the
Marriage of her Daughter Elizabeth with King Henry, had nevertheless
delivered her Daughters out of Sanctuary into King Richard’s hands;
should be Cloystered in the Nunnery of Bermonsey, and forfeit all her
Lands and Goods.</p>
<p>The next was, That Edward Plantagenet then Close-prisoner in the
Tower, should be in the most publick and notorious manner, that could be
devised, shewed unto the People: In part to discharge the King of the
Envy of that opinion and bruit, how he had been put to death privily in
the Tower; But chiefly to make the People see the levity and imposture
of the Proceedings of Ireland, and that their Plantagenet was indeed but
a Puppet, or a Counterfeit.</p>
<p>The third was, That there should be again Proclaimed a General-Pardon
to all that would reveal their Offences, and submit themselves by a Day.
And that this Pardon should be conceived in so ample and liberal a
manner, as no High-Treason (no not against the King’s own Person) should
be excepted. Which though it might seem strange, yet was it not so to a
wise King, that knew his greatest dangers were not from the least
Treasons, but from the greatest. These Resolutions of the King and his
Council were immediately put in execution. And first, the Queen Dowager
was put into the Monastery of Bermonsey, and all her Estate seized into
the King’s hands, whereat there was much wondering; That a weak Woman,
for the yielding to the menaces and promises of a Tyrant, after such a
distance of time, (wherein the King had shewed no displeasure, nor
alteration,) but much more after so happy a Marriage, between the King
and her Daughter, blessed with Issue-male, should upon a sudden
mutability or disclosure of the King’s mind be so severely handled.</p>
<p>This Lady was amongst the Examples of great variety of Fortune. She
had first from a distressed Suitor, and desolate Widow, been taken to
the Marriage-Bed of a Batchelor-King, the goodliest Personage of his
time; and even in his Reign she had endured a strange Eclipse by the
King’s flight, and temporary depriving from the Crown. She was also very
happy, in that she had by him fair Issue, and continued his Nuptial Love
(helping her self by some obsequious bearing and dissembling of his
Pleasures) to the very end. She was much affectionate to her own
Kindred, even unto Faction; which did stir great Envy in the Lords of
the King’s side, who counted her Blood a disparagement to be mingled
with the King’s. With which Lords of the King’s Blood, joyned also the
King’s Favorite the Lord Hastings; who, notwithstanding the King’s great
affection to him, was thought at times through her malice and spleen,
not to be out of danger of falling. After her Husband’s death, she was
matter of Tragedy, having lived to see her Brother beheaded, and her two
Sons deposed from the Crown, bastarded in their Blood, and cruelly
murthered. All this while nevertheless she enjoyed her Liberty, State,
and Fortunes. But afterwards again, upon the Rise of the wheel, when she
had a King to her Son-in-Law, and was made Grand-mother to a Grand-child
of the best Sex; yet was she (upon dark and unknown Reasons, and no less
strange Pretences) precipitated, and banished the World, into a Nunnery;
where it was almost thought dangerous to visit her, or see her; and
where not long after she ended her Life: but was by the King’s
commandment Buried with the King her Husband at Windsor. She was
Foundress of Queens-College in Cambridge. For this Act the King
sustained great Obloquy, which nevertheless (besides the reason of
State) was somewhat sweetned to him by a great Confiscation.</p>
<p>About this time also Edward Plantagenet was upon a Sunday brought
throughout all the principal Streets of London, to be seen of the
people. And having passed the view of the Streets, was conducted to
St. Paul’s Church, in solemn Procession, where great store of people
were assembled. And it was provided also in good fashion, that divers of
the Nobility, and others of Quality (especially of those that the King
most suspected, and knew the person of Plantagenet best) had
communication with the young Gentleman by the way, and entertained him
with speech and discourse; which did in effect marr the Pageant in
Ireland with the Subjects here, at least with so many, as out of Errour,
and not out of Malice, might be mis-led. Nevertheless, in Ireland (where
it was too late to go back) it wrought little or no effect. But
contrariwise, they turned the Imposture upon the King, and gave out,
That the King, to defeat the true Inheritor, and to mock the World, and
blind the Eyes of simple men, had tricked up a in the likeness of Edward
Plantagenet, and shewed him to the People, not sparing to prophane the
Ceremony of a Procession, the more to countenance the Fable.</p>
<p>The General-Pardon likewise near the same time came forth; and the
King therewithal omitted no diligence, in giving straight Order, for the
keeping the Ports; that Fugitives, Male-contents, or suspected Persons
might not pass over into Ireland, and Flanders,</p>
<p>Mean while the Rebels in Ireland had sent privy Messengers both into
England, and into Flanders, who in both places had wrought effects of no
small Importance. For in England they won to their Party John, Earl of
Lincoln, Son of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, King
Edward the Fourth’s eldest Sister. This Earl was a man of great Wit and
Courage, and had his thoughts highly raised by Hopes and Expectations
for a time. For Richard the Third had a Resolution, out of his hatred to
both his Brethren, King Edward, and the Duke of Clarence, and their
Lines, (having had his hand in both their Bloods,) to disable their
Issues upon false and incompetent pretexts; the one, of Attaindor; the
other, of Illegitimation: and to design this Gentleman (in case himself
should dye without Children) for Inheritor of the Crown. Neither was
this unknown to the King, who had secretly an Eye upon him. But the King
having tasted of the Envy of the People, for his Imprisonment of Edward
Plantagenet, was doubtful to heap up any more distasts of that kind, by
the Imprisonment of De la Pole also; the rather thinking it Policy to
conserve him as a Corrival unto the other. The Earl of Lincoln was
induced to participate with the Action of Ireland, not lightly upon the
strength of the Proceedings there, which was but a Bubble, but upon
Letters from the Lady Margaret of Burgundy, in whose succours and
declaration for the Enterprize, there seemed to be a more solid
Foundation, both for Reputation and Forces. Neither did the Earl refrain
the Business, for that he knew the pretended Plantagenet to be but an
Idol. But contrariwise, he was more glad it should be the false
Plantagenet than the true: because the false being sure to fall away of
himself, and the true to be made sure of by the King; it might open and
pave a fair and prepared way to his own Title. With this Resolution he
sayled secretly into Flanders; where was a little before arrived the
Lord Lovel, leaving a correspondence here in England with Sir Thomas
Broughton, a man of great Power and Dependencies in Lancashire. For
before this time, when the pretended Plantagenet was first received in
Ireland, secret Messengers had been also sent to the Lady Margaret,
advertising her what was passed in Ireland, imploring Succours in an
Enterprize (as they said) so pious and just, and that God had so
miraculously prospered the beginning thereof; and making offer, that all
things should be guided by her will and direction, as the Sovereign
Patroness and Protectress of the Enterprize. Margaret was second Sister
to King Edward the Fourth, and had been second Wife to Charles, sirnamed
the Hardy, Duke of Burgundy; by whom, having no Children of her own, she
did with singular care and tenderness intend the Education of Philip and
Margaret, Grand-children to her former Husband; which won her great Love
and Authority among the Dutch. This Princess (having the Spirit of a
Man, and Malice of a Woman) abounding in Treasure, by the greatness of
her Dower, and her provident Government, and being childless, and
without any nearer Care, made it her Design and Enterprize, to see the
Majesty Royal of England once again re-placed in her House, and had set
up King Henry as a Mark, at whose Overthrow all her Actions should aim
and shoot; in-so-much as all the Counsels of his succeeding Troubles
came chiefly out of that Quiver. And she bare such a mortal Hatred to
the House of Lancaster, and personally to the King, as she was no ways
mollified by the Conjunction of the Houses in her Neeces Marriage, but
rather hated her Neece, as the means of the King’s ascent to the Crown,
and assurance therein. Wherefore with great violence of affection she
embraced this Overture: And upon Counsel taken with the Earl of Lincoln,
and the Lord Lovel, and some other of the Party, it was resolved with
all speed, the two Lords assisted with a Regiment of two thousand
Almains, being choice and veterane Bands under the Command of Martin
Swart (a valiant and experimented Captain) should pass over into Ireland
to the new King. Hoping, that when the Action should have the face of a
received and setled Regality, (with such a second Person, as the Earl of
Lincoln, and the Conjunction and Reputation of Forein Succors,) the Fame
of it would embolden and prepare all the Party of the Confederates and
Male-contents within the Realm of England, to give them Assistance, when
they should come over there. And for the Person of the Counterfeit, it
was agreed, that if all things succeeded well, he should be put down,
and the true Plantagenet received: Wherein nevertheless the Earl of
Lincoln had his particular hopes. After they were come into Ireland, and
that the Party took courage, by seeing themselves together in a Body,
they grew very confident of success, conceiving and discoursing amongst
themselves, that they went in upon far better Cards to overthrow King
Henry, than King Henry had to overthrow King Richard. And that if there
were not a Sword drawn against them in Ireland, it was a sign the Swords
in England would be soon sheathed, or beaten down. And first, for a
Bravery upon this accession of Power, they Crowned their new King in the
in the Cathedral Church of Dublin; who formerly had been but Proclaimed
only; and then sate in Council what should further be done. At which
Council, though it were propounded by some, that it were the best way to
Establish themselves first in Ireland, and to make that the Seat of the
War, and to draw King Henry thither in Person, by whose absence, they
thought there would be great Alterations and Commotions in England, yet
because the Kingdom there was poor, and they should not be able to keep
their Army together, nor pay their German Soldiers, and for that also
the sway of the Irish-men, and generally of the Men-ofWar, which (as in
such cases of popular Tumults is usual) did in effect govern their
Leaders, was eager, and in affection to make their Fortunes upon
England: It was concluded with all possible speed to transport their
Forces into England. The King in the mean time, who at the first when he
heard what was done in Ireland, though it troubled him, yet thought he
should be well enough able to scatter the Irish as a Flight of Birds,
and rattle away this Swarm of Bees, with their King; when he heard
afterwards that the Earl of Lincoln was embarqued in the Action, and
that the Lady Margaret was declared for it, he apprehended the danger in
a true Degree as it was, and saw plainly that his Kingdom must again be
put to the Stake, and that he must fight for it. And first, he did
conceive, before he understood of the Earl of Lincoln’s sayling into
Ireland out of Flanders, that he should be assailed both upon the
East-parts of the Kingdom of England by some impression from Flanders,
and upon the Northwest out of Ireland. And therefore having ordered
Musters to be made in both Parts, and having provisionally designed two
Generals, Jasper Earl of Bedford, and John Earl of Oxford, (meaning
himself also to go in person, where the Affairs should most require it,)
and nevertheless not expecting any actual Invasion at that time (the
Winter being far on) he took his journey himself towards Suffolk and
Norfolk, for the confirming of those parts. And being come to
St. Edmonds-bury, he understood, that Thomas, Marquess Dorset (who had
been one of the Pledges in France) was hastning towards him, to purge
himself of some Accusations which had been made against him. But the
King, though he kept an Ear for him, yet was the time so doubtful, that
he sent the Earl of Oxford to meet him, and forthwith to carry him to
the Tower; with a fair Message nevertheless, that he should bear that
disgrace with patience, for that the King meant not his hurt, but only
to preserve him from doing hurt, either to the King’s service, or to
himself; and that the King should always be able (when he had cleared
himself) to make him reparation.</p>
<p>From St. Edmonds-bury he went to Norwich, where he kept his
Christmas. And from thence he went (in a manner of Pilgrimage) to
Walsingham, where he visited our Ladies Church, famous for Miracles, and
made his Prayers and Vows for help and deliverance. And from thence he
returned by Cambridge to London. Not long after, the Rebels with their
King (under the Leading of the Earl of Lincoln, the Earl of Kildare, the
Lord Lovel, and Colonel Swart) landed at Fouldrey in Lancashire, whither
there repaired to them, Sir Thomas Broughton, with some small company of
English. The King by that time (knowing now the Storm would not divide,
but fall in one place) had levied Forces in good number; and in person
(taking with him his two designed Generals, the Duke of Bedford, and the
Earl of Oxford) was come on his way towards them as far as Coventry,
whence he sent forth a Troop of Light-horsmen for discovery, and to
intercept some straglers of the Enemies, by whom he might the better
understand the particulars of their Progress and purposes, which was
accordingly done; though the King otherwise was not without Intelligence
from Espials in the Camp.</p>
<p>The Rebels took their way towards York, without spoiling the
Countrey, or any act of Hostility, the better to put themselves into
favour of the People, and to personate their King: who (no doubt, out of
a Princely feeling) was sparing, and compassionate towards his Subjects.
But their Snow-ball did not gather as it went. For the People came not
in to them: Neither did any rise or declare themselves in other parts of
the Kingdom for them, which was caused partly by the good tast that the
King had given his People of his Government, joyned with the reputation
of his Felicity, and partly for that it was an odious thing to the
People of England, to have a King brought in to them upon the shoulders
of Irish and Dutch, of which their Army was in substance compounded.
Neither was it a thing done with any great Judgement on the Party of the
Rebels, for them to take their way towards York: Considering that
howsoever those parts had formerly been a Nursery of their Friends; yet
it was there, where the Lord Lovel had so lately disbanded, and where
the King’s presence had a little before qualified discontents. The Earl
of Lincoln, deceived of his hopes of the Countries concourse unto him,
(in which case he would have temporized,) and seeing the business past
Retract, resolved to make on where the King was, and to give him Battel;
and thereupon, marched towards Newark, thinking to have surprised the
Town. But the King was somewhat before this time come to Nottingham,
where he called a Council of War, at which was consulted, whether it
were best to protract time, or speedily to set upon the Rebels. In which
Council the King himself (whose continual vigilancy did suck in
sometimes causeless Suspitions, which few else knew) inclined to the
accelerating a Battel. But this was presently put out of doubt, by the
great Aids that came in to him in the instant of this Consultation,
partly upon Missives, and partly Voluntaries from many parts of the
Kingdom.</p>
<p>The principal persons that came then to the King’s aid, were the Earl
of Shrewsbury, and the Lord Strange, of the Nobility; and of Knights and
Gentlemen to the number of at least Threescore and ten persons, with
their Companies, making in the whole, at the least Six Thousand fighting
men, besides the Forces that were with the King before. Whereupon the
King, finding his Army so bravely re-enforced, and a great alacrity in
all his men to fight, was confirmed in his former Resolution, and
marched speedily, so as he put himself between the Enemies Camp and
Newark; being loth their Army should get the commodity of that Town. The
Earl nothing dismayed, came forwards that day unto a little Village
called Stoke, and there camped that night, upon the brow or hanging of a
Hill. The King the next day presented him Battel upon the Plain, the
fields there being open and champion. The Earl couragiously came down
and joyned Battel with him. Concerning which Battel, the Relations that
are left unto us are so naked and negligent, (though it be an Action of
so recent memory) as they rather declared the Success of the day, than
the Manner of the Fight. They say, that the King divided his Army into
three Battels, whereof the Vaunt-guard only well strengthned with Wings,
came to fight. That the Fight was fierce and obstinate, and lasted three
hours, before the Victory inclined either way; save that Judgement might
be made, by that the King’s Vaunt-guard of it self maintained fight
against the whole Power of the Enemies, (the other two Battels remaining
out of action,) what the success was like to be in the end: That Martin
Swart with his Germans performed bravely; and so did those few English
that were on that side, neither did the Irish fail in courage or
fierceness, but being almost naked men, only armed with Darts and
Skeins, it was rather an Execution, than a Fight upon them; insomuch as
the furious slaughter of them was a great discouragement and appalement
to the rest: That there dyed upon the place all the Chieftains; that is,
the Earl of Lincoln, the Earl of Kildare, Francis Lord Lovel, Martin
Swart, and Sir Thomas Broughton; all making good the fight, without any
ground given. Only of the Lord Lovel there went a report, that he fled
and swam over Trent on horseback, but could not recover the further
side, by reason of the steepness of the Bank, and so was drowned in the
River. But another report leaves him not there, but that he lived long
after in a Cave or Vault. The number that was slain in the field, was of
the Enemies part, Four thousand at the least; and of the King’s part,
one half of his Vaunt-guard, besides many hurt, but none of name. There
were taken Prisoners, amongst others, the Counterfeit Plantagenet (now
Lambert Simnel again) and the crafty Priest his Tutor. For Lambert, the
King would not take his Life, both out of Magnanimity, taking him but as
an Image of Wax, that others had tempered and molded; and likewise out
of Wisdom, thinking that if he suffered death, he would be forgotten too
soon; but being kept alive, he would be a continual Spectacle, and a
kind of remedy against the like Inchantments of People, in time to come.
For which cause he was taken into service in his Court, to a base office
in his Kitchin; so that (in a kind of Mattacina of humane fortune) he
turned a Broach, that had worn a Crown: Whereas Fortune commonly doth
not bring in a Comedy or Farce after a Tragedy. And afterwards he was
preferred to be one of the King’s Falconers. As to the Priest, he was
committed Closeprisoner, and heard of no more, the King loving to seal
up his own dangers.</p>
<p>After the Battel, the King went to Lincoln, where he caused
Supplications and Thanksgivings to be made for his Deliverance and
Victory. And that his Devotions might go round in Circle, he sent his
Banner to be Offered to our Lady of Walsingham, where before he made his
Vows. And thus delivered of this so strange an Engin and new Invention
of Fortune, he returned to his former confidence of mind, thinking now,
that all his misfortunes had come at once. But it fell out unto him
according to the Speech of the common People in the beginning of his
Reign, that said; It was a token he should reign in Labour, because his
Reign began with a sickness of Sweat. But howsoever the King thought
himself now in a Haven, yet such was his Wisdom, as his Confidence did
seldom darken his Fore-sight, especially in things near hand. And
therefore awakened by so fresh, and unexpected dangers, he entred into
due consideration, as well how to weed out the Partakers of the former
Rebellion, as to kill the Seeds of the like in time to come: and withal
to take away all shelters and harbours for discontented Persons, where
they might hatch and foster Rebellions, which afterwards might gather
strength and motion. And first, he did yet again make a Progress from
Lincoln to the Northern parts, though it were indeed rather an Itinerary
Circuit of Justice, than a Progress. For all along as he went, with much
severity and strict inquisition, partly by Martial Law, and partly by
Commission, were punished, the Adherents and Ayders of the late Rebels:
not all by Death, (for the Field had drawn much blood,) but by Fines and
Ransoms, which spared Life, and raised Treasure. Amongst other Crimes of
this nature, there was diligent inquiry made of such as had raised and
dispersed a bruit and rumour, a little before the Field fought, That the
Rebels had the day; and that the King’s Army was overthrown, and the
King fled. Whereby it was supposed that many Succours, which otherwise
would have come unto the King, were cunningly put off, and kept back.
Which Charge and Accusation, though it had some ground, yet it was
industriously embraced and put on by divers, who having been in
themselves not the best affected to the King’s part, nor forward to come
to his ayd, were glad to apprehend this colour, to cover their neglect
and coldness, under the pretence of such discouragements. Which cunning
nevertheless, the King would not understand, though he lodged it, and
noted it in some particulars, as his manner was.</p>
<p>But for the extirpating of the roots and causes of the like
Commotions in time to come, the King began to find where his shooe did
wring him, and that it was his depressing of the House of York, that did
rancle and fester the Affections of his People. And therefore being now
too wise to disdain perils any longer, and willing to give some
contentment in that kind (at least in Ceremony) he resolved at last to
proceed to the Coronation of his Queen. And therefore at his coming to
London, where he entred in State, and in a kind of Triumph, and
celebrated his Victory, with two days of Devotion, (for the first day he
repaired to St. Pauls, and had the Hymn of Te Deum sung, and the morrow
after he went in Procession, and heard the Sermon at the Cross,) the
Queen was with great solemnity Crowned at Westminster, the five and
twentyeth of November, in the third year of his Reign, which was about
two years after the Marriage; Like an old Christning, that had staid
long for Godfathers. Which strange and unusual distance of time, made it
subject to every man’s note, that it was an Act against his stomach, and
put upon him by necessity and reason of State. Soon after, to shew that
it was now fair weather again, and that the Imprisonment of Thomas
Marquess Dorset, was rather upon suspition of the Time, than of the Man,
he the said Marquess was set at liberty without Examination, or other
circumstance. At that time also the King sent an Ambassador unto Pope
Innocent, signifying unto him this his Marriage, and that now (like
another Aeneas) he had passed through the floods of his former Troubles
and Travels, and was arrived unto a safe Haven: and thanking His
Holiness, that he had honoured the Celebration of his Marriage with the
presence of his Ambassador, and offering both his Person and the Forces
of his Kingdom upon all occasions to do him service.</p>
<p>The Ambassador, making his Oration to the Pope, in the presence of
the Cardinals, did so magnifie the King and Queen, as was enough to glut
the Hearers. But then he did again so extol and deifie the Pope, as made
all that he had said in praise of his Master and Mistress seem temperate
and passable. But he was very honorably entertained, and extremely much
made on by the Pope; who knowing himself to be lazy and unprofitable to
the Christian World, was wonderfully glad to hear that there were such
Eccho’s of him sounding in remote parts. He obtained also of the Pope a
very just and honorable Bull, qualifying the Priviledges of Sanctuary,
(wherewith the King had been extremely galled) in three Points.</p>
<p>The first, that if any Sanctuary-man did by night, or otherwise, get
out of Sanctuary privily, and commit mischief and trespass, and then
come in again, he should lose the benefit of Sanctuary for ever after.
The second, that howsoever the Person of the Sanctuary-man was protected
from his Creditors, yet his Goods out of Sanctuary should not. The
third, that if any took Sanctuary for case of Treason, the King might
appoint him Keepers to look to him in Sanctuary.</p>
<p>The King also for the better securing of his Estate, against mutinous
and male-contented Subjects (whereof he saw the Realm was full) who
might have their refuge into Scotland, which was not under Key, as the
Ports were: For that cause, rather than for any doubt of Hostility from
those parts, before his coming to London (when he was at Newcastle) had
sent a solemn Ambassage unto James the Third, King of Scotland, to treat
and conclude a Peace with him. The Ambassadors were Richard Fox Bishop
of Exceter, and Sir Richard Edgcomb Comptroller of the King’s House, who
were honourably received and entertained there. But the King of Scotland
labouring of the same disease that King Henry did, (though more mortal,
as afterwards appeared) that is, Discontented Subjects, apt to rise, and
raise Tumult, although in his own affection he did much desire to make a
Peace with the King: Yet finding his Nobles averse, and not daring to
displease them, concluded only a Truce for seven years; giving
nevertheless promise in private, that it should be renewed from time to
time, during the two Kings lives.</p>
<p>HItherto the King had been exercised in setling his Affairs at home.
But about this time brake forth an occasion that drew him to look
abroad, and to hearken to forein business. Charles the Eighth the French
King, by the virtue and good fortune of his two immediate Predecessors,
Charles the Seventh his Grand-father, and Lewis the Eleventh his Father,
received the Kingdom of France in more flourishing and spread Estate,
than it had been of many years before; being redintegrate in those
principal Members, which antiently had been portions of the Crown of
France, and were after dissevered, so as they remained only in Homage,
and not in Sovereignty, (being governed by absolute Princes of their
own) Anjou, Normandy, and Burgundy; there remained only Britain to be
re-united, and so the Monarchy of France to be reduced to the antient
Terms and Bounds.</p>
<p>King Charles was not a little inflamed with an ambition to
re-purchase, and re-annex that Dutchy. Which his ambition was a wise and
well-weighed Ambition; not like unto the ambitions of his succeeding
Enterprizes of Italy. For at that time being newly come to the Crown, he
was somewhat guided by his Father’s Counsels, (Counsels, not
Counsellors) for his Father was his own Counsel, and had few able men
about him. And that King (he knew well) had ever distasted the Designs
of Italy, and in particular had an Eye upon Britain. There were many
circumstances that did feed the Ambition of Charles, with pregnant and
apparent hopes of Success. The Duke of Britain old, and entred into a
Lethargy, and served with Mercenary Counsellors, Father of two only
Daughters, the one sick and not likely to continue. King Charles himself
in the flower of his age, and the Subjects of France at that time well
trained for War, both for Leaders and Soldiers; men of service being not
yet worn out, since the Wars of Lewis against Burgundy. He found himself
also in Peace with all his Neighbour-Princes. As for those that might
oppose to his Enterprize; Maximilian King of the Romans, his Rival in
the same desires, (as well for the Dutchy, as the Daughter) feeble in
means; and King Henry of England as well somewhat obnoxious to him for
his favours and benefits, as busied in his particular troubles at home.
There was also a fair and specious occasion offered him to hide his
Ambition, and to justifie his Warring upon Britain, for that the Duke
had received and succoured Lewis Duke of Orleance, and other of the
French Nobility; which had taken Arms against their King. Wherefore King
Charles being resolved upon that War, knew well he could not receive any
opposition so potent, as if King Henry should either upon Policy of
State, in preventing the growing Greatness of France; or upon gratitude
unto the Duke of Britain, for his former favours, in the time of his
distress, espouse that Quarrel, and declare himself in ayd of the Duke.
Therefore he no sooner heard that King Henry was setled by his Victory,
but forth with he sent Ambassadors unto him, to pray his assistance, or
at the least that he would stand neutral. Which Ambassadors found the
King at Leicester, and delivered their Embassy to this effect: They
first imparted unto the King the success that their Master had had a
little before against Maximilian, in recovery of certain Towns from him:
which was done in a kind of privacy, and inwardness towards the King;
and if the French King did not esteem him for an outward or formal
Confederate, but as one that had part in his Affections and Fortunes,
and with whom he took pleasure to communicate his Business. After this
Compliment, and some gratulation for the King’s Victory, they fell to
their Errand; declaring to the King, that their Master was enforced to
enter into a just and necessary War with the Duke of Britain, for that
he had received and succoured those that were Traytors, and declared
Enemies unto his Person and State. That they were no mean, distressed,
and calamitous persons that fled to him for refuge, but of so great
quality, as it was apparent that they came not thither to protect their
own fortune, but to infest and invade his; the Head of them being the
Duke of Orleance, the first Prince of the Blood, and the second Person
of France. That therefore, rightly to understand it, it was rather on
their Master’s part a Defensive War, than an Offensive; as that, that
could not be omitted or forborn, if he tendred the conservation of his
own Estate; and that it was not the first Blow that made the War
Invasive, (for that no wise Prince would stay for) but the first
Provocation, or at least the first Preparation. Nay that this War was
rather a suppression of Rebels, than a War with a just Enemy, where the
Case is; That his Subjects, Traytors, are received by the Duke of
Britain his Homager. That King Henry knew well what went upon it in
example, if Neighbour Princes should patronize and comfort Rebels,
against the Law of Nations and of Leagues. Nevertheless that their
Master was not ignorant, that the King had been beholding to the Duke of
Britain in his adversity; as on the other side, they knew he would not
forget also the readiness of their King, in ayding him when the Duke of
Britain, or his mercenary Counsellors failed him, and would have
betrayed him; And that there was a great difference between the
courtesies received from their Master, and the Duke of Britain; for that
the Dukes might have ends of Utility and Bargain, whereas their Masters
could not have proceeded but out of entire Affection. For that, if it
had been measured by a politick line, it had been better for his
affairs, that a Tyrant should have reigned in England, troubled and
hated, than such a Prince, whose virtues could not fail to make him
great and potent, whensoever he was come to be Master of his affairs.
But howsoever it stood for the point of Obligation, which the King might
owe to the Duke of Britain, yet their Master was well assured, it would
not divert King Henry of England from doing that, that was just, nor
ever embarque him in so ill-grounded a Quarrel. Therefore, since this
War which their Master was now to make, was but to deliver himself from
imminent dangers, their King hoped the King would shew the like
affection to the conservation of their Master’s Estate, as their Master
had (when time was) shewed to the King’s acquisition of his Kingdom. At
the least, that according to the inclination which the King had ever
professed of Peace, he would look on, and stand Neutral; for that their
Master could not with reason press him to undertake part in the War,
being so newly setled and recovered from intestine Seditions. But
touching the Mystery of re-annexing of the Dutchy of Britain to the
Crown of France, either by War, or by Marriage with the Daughter of
Britain; the Ambassadors bare aloof from it, as from a Rock, knowing
that it made most against them. And therefore by all means declined any
mention thereof, but contrariwise interlaced in their conference with
the King, the assured purpose of their Master, to match with the
Daughter of Maximilian; And entertained the King also with some wandring
Discourses of their King’s purpose, to recover by Arms his right to the
Kingdom of Naples, by an expedition in Person; All to remove the King
from all-jealousie of any Design, in these hither Parts upon Britain,
otherwise than for quenching of the Fire, which he feared might be
kindled in his own Estate.</p>
<p>The King after advice taken with his Council, made answer to the
Ambassadors. And first returned their Compliment, shewing he was right
glad of the French King’s reception of those Towns from Maximilian. Then
he familiarly related some particular passages of his own Adventures and
Victory passed. As to the business of Britain, the King answered in few
words; That the French King and the Duke of Britain, were the two
persons to whom he was most obliged of all men; and that he should think
himself very happy, if things should go so between them, as he should
not be able to acquit himself in gratitude towards them both; and that
there was no means for him as a Christian King and a common Friend to
them, to satisfie all Obligations both to God and man, but to offer
himself for a Mediator of an Accord and Peace between them; by which
course he doubted not but their King’s Estate, and Honour both, would be
preserved with more Safety and less Envy than by a War, and that he
would spare no cost or pains, no if it were To go on Pilgrimage, for so
good an effect; And concluded, that in this great Affair, which he took
so much to heart, he would express himself more fully by an Ambassage,
which he would speedily dispatch unto the French King for that purpose.
And in this sort the French Ambassadors were dismissed; the King
avoiding to understand any thing touching the re-annexing of Britain, as
the Ambassadors had avoided to mention it; save that he gave a little
touch of it in the word, Envy. And so it was, that the King was neither
so shallow, nor so ill advertised, as not to perceive the intention of
the French, for the investing himself of Britain. But first he was
utterly unwilling (howsoever he gave out) to enter into War with France.
A Fame of a War he liked well, but not an Atchievement; for the one he
thought would make him Richer, and the other Poorer: and he was
possessed with many secret fears, touching his own People, which he was
therefore loth to arm, and put Weapons into their hands. Yet
notwithstanding (as a prudent and couragious Prince) he was not so
averse from a War, but that he was resolved to choose it, rather than to
have Britain carried by France, being so great and opulent a Dutchy, and
situate opportunely to annoy England, either for Coast, or Trade. But
the King’s hopes were, that partly by negligence, commonly imputed to
the French, (especially in the Court of a young King) and partly by the
native, power of Britain it self, which was not small; but chiefly in
respect of the great Party, that the Duke of Orleance had in the Kingdom
of France, and thereby means to stir up Civil troubles, to divert the
French King from the Enterprize of Britain: And lastly, in regard of the
Power of Maximilian, who was Cotrival to the French King in that
pursuit, the Enterprize would either bow to a Peace, or break in it
self. In all which, the King measured and valued things amiss, as
afterwards appeared. He sent therefore forth with to the French King,
Christopher Urswick, his Chaplain, a person by him much trusted and
employed; choosing him the rather, because he was a Church-man, as best
sorting with an Embassy of Pacification: and giving him also a
Commission, That if the French King consented to Treat, he should thence
repair to the Duke of Britain, and ripen the Treaty on both parts.
Urswick made declaration to the French King, much to the purpose of the
King’s answer to the French Ambassadors here; instilling also tenderly
some overture of receiving to grace the Duke of Orleance, and some
tasted of Conditions of Accord. But the French King on the other side
proceeded not sincerely, but with a great deal of art and dissimulation,
in this Treaty; having for his end to gain time, and so put off the
English Succours, under hope of Peace, till he had got good footing in
Britain, by force of Arms. Wherefore he answered the Ambassador, That he
would put himself into the King’s hands, and make him Arbiter of the
Peace: and willingly consent, that the Ambassador should straightways
pass into Britain, to signifie this his , and to know the Duke’s mind
likewise; well fore-seeing, that the Duke of , by whom the Duke of
Britain was wholly led, taking himself to be upon terms irreconcilable
with him, would admit of no Treaty of Peace. Whereby he should in one,
both generally abroad veil over his Ambition, and win the reputation of
just and moderate proceedings; and should withal endear himself in the
of the King of England, as one, that had committed all to his Will: Nay,
and (which was yet more fine) make faith in him, That although he went
on with the War, yet it should be but with his Sword in his hand, to
bend the stiffness of the other party to accept of Peace: and so the
King should take no umbrage of his arming and prosecution; but the
Treaty to be kept on foot, to the very last instant, till he were Master
of the Field.</p>
<p>Which grounds being by the French King wisely laid, all things fell
out as he expected. For when the English Ambassador came to the Court of
Britain, the Duke was then scarcely perfect his memory, and all things
were directed by the Duke of Orleance; who gave audience to the Chaplain
Urswick, and upon his Ambassage delivered, made answer in somewhat high
terms, That the Duke of Britain having been an Host, and a kind of
Parent or Foster-father to the King, in his tenderness of age, and
weakness of fortune, did look for at this time from King Henry (the
renowned King of England) rather brave Troops for for his Succours, than
a vain Treaty of Peace. And if the King could forget the good Offices of
the Duke done unto him ; yet he knew well, he would in his Wisdom
consider of the future, how much it imported his own Safety and
Reputation, both in Foreign parts, and with his own People, not to
suffer Britain (the old Confederates of England) to be swallowed up by
France, and so many good Ports, and strong Towns upon the Coast, be in
the command of so potent a Neighbour-King, and so ancient an Enemy. And
therefore humbly desired the King to think of this business as his own;
and therewith brake off, and denyed any further Conference for
Treaty.</p>
<p>Urswick returned first to the French King, and related to him what
had passed. Who finding things to sort to his desire, took hold of them,
and said; That the Ambassador might perceive now, that which he for his
part, partly, imagined before; That considering in what hands the Duke
of Britain was, there would be no Peace, but by a mixt Treaty of force
and perswasion. And therefore he would go on with the one, and desired
the King not to desist from the other. But for his own part, he did
faithfully promise, to be still in the King’s power, to rule him in the
matter of Peace. This was accordingly represented unto the King-by
Urswick at his return, and in such a fashion, as if the Treaty were in
no sort desperate, but rather stayd for a better hour, till the Hammer
had wrought, and beat the Party of Britain more pliant. Whereupon there
passed continually Pacquets and Dispatches between the two Kings, from
the one out of desire, and from the other out of dissimulation, about
the negotiation of Peace. The French King mean-while invaded Britain
with great Forces, and distressed the City of Nantes with a strait
Siege, and (as one, who though he had no great Judgement, yet had that,
that he could Dissemble home) the more he did urge the prosecution of
the War, the more he did at the same time, urge the solicitation of the
Peace. Insomuch as during the Siege of Nantes, after many Letters and
particular Messages, the better to maintain his dissimulation, and to
refresh the Treaty, he sent Bernard Daubigney (a person of good quality)
to the King, earnestly to desire him, to make an end of the business
howsoever.</p>
<p>The King was no less ready to revive and quicken the Treaty; and
thereupon sent three Commissioners, the Abbot of Abbington, Sir Richard
Tunstal, and Chaplain Urswick formerly employed, to do their utmost
endeavours, to manage the Treaty roundly and strongly.</p>
<p>About this time the Lord Woodvile, (Uncle to the Queen) a valiant
Gentleman, and desirous of Honour, sued to the King, that he might raise
some Power of Voluntaries under-hand, and without licence or pasport
(wherein the King might any ways appear) go to the ayd of the Duke of
Britain. The King denyed his request, (or at least seemed so to do) and
strait Commandment upon him, that he should not stir, for that the King
thought his Honour would suffer therein, during a Treaty, to better a
Party. Nevertheless this Lord (either being unruly, or out of conceit
that the King would not inwardly dislike that, which he would not openly
avow) sailed secretly over into the Isle of , whereof he was Governour,
and levied a fair Troop of four hundred men, and with them passed over
into Britain, and joyned himself with the Duke’s forces. The news
whereof when it came to the French Court, put divers Young bloods into
such a fury, as the English Ambassadors were not without peril to be
outraged. But the French King, both to preserve the Priviledge of
Ambassadors, and being conscious to himself, that in the business of
Peace, he himself was the greater dissembler of the two, forbad all
injuries of fact or word, against their Persons; or Followers. And
presently came an Agent from the King, to purge himself touching the
Lord Woodvile’s going over, using for a principal argument, to
demonstrate that it was without his privity, for that the Troops were so
small, as neither had the face of a Succour by Authority, nor could much
advance the Britains Affairs. To which Message, although the French King
gave no full credit, yet he made fair weather with the King, and seemed
satisfied. Soon after the English Ambassadors returned, having two of
them been likewise with the Duke of Britain, and found things in no
other terms, than they were before. Upon their return, they informed the
King of the state of the Affairs, and how far the French King was from
any true meaning of Peace; and therefore he was now to advise of some
other course. Neither was the King himself all this while with credulity
meerly, as was generally supposed; but his Errour was not so much
facility of belief, as an ill-measuring of the Forces of the other
Party.</p>
<p>For (as was partly touched before) the King had cast the business
thus with himself. He took it for granted in his own judgement, that the
War of Britain, in respect of the strength of the Towns, and of the
Party, could not speedily come to a period. For he conceived that the
Counsels of a War, that was undertaken by the French King, then
Childless, against an Heir-apparent of France, would be very faint and
slow. And besides, that it was not possible, but that the state of
France should be embroyled with some troubles and in favour of the Duke
of Orleance. He conceived likewise, that Maximilian, King of the Romans,
was a Prince warlike and potent, who (he made account) would give
succours to the Britains roundly. So then judging it would be a work of
Time, he laid his Plot, how he might best make use of that Time, for his
own affairs. Wherein first he thought to make his vantage upon his
Parliament; knowing that they being affectionate unto the Quarrel of
Britain, would give Treasure largely. Which Treasure, as a noise of War
might draw forth, so a Peace succeeding might coffer up. And because he
knew his People were upon the business, he chose rather to seem to be
deceived, and asleep by the French, than to be backward in himself;
considering his Subjects were not so fully capable of the reasons of
State, which made him hold back. Wherefore to all these purposes he saw
no other expedient, than to set and keep on foot a continual Treaty of
Peace; laying it down, and taking it up again, as the occurrence
required. Besides, he had in consideration the point of Honour in
bearing the blessed person of a Pacificator. He thought likewise to make
use of the Envy, that the French King met with, by occasion of this War
of Britain, in strengthning himself with new Alliances; as namely that
of Ferdinando of Spain, with whom he had ever a consent even in Nature
and Customs, and likewise with Maximilian, who was particularly
interessed. So that in substance he promised himself Money, Honour,
Friends, and Peace in the end. But those things were too fine to be
fortunate, and succeed in all parts; for that great affairs are commonly
too rough and stubborn to be wrought upon by the finer edges, or points
of Wit. The King was likewise deceived in his two main grounds. For
although he had reason to conceive, that the Council of France would be
wary to put the King into a War against the Heir-apparent of France; yet
he did not consider, that Charles was not guided by any of the principal
of the Blood or Nobility, but by mean men, who would make it their
Master-piece, of Credit and Favour, to give venturous Counsols, which no
great or wise man durst or would. And for Maximilian, he was thought
then a Greater-matter than he was; his unstable and necessitous Courses
being not then known.</p>
<p>After Consultation with the Ambassadors, who brought him no other
news, than he expected before, (though he would not seem to know it till
then) he presently summoned his Parliament, and in open Parliament
propounded the Cause of Britain to both Houses, by his Chancellor Morton
Archbishop of Canterbury, who spake to this effect:</p>
<p>MY Lords and Masters; The King’s Grace our Sovereign Lord, hath
commanded me to declare unto you the Causes that have moved him at this
time to summon this his Parliament; which I shall do in few words,
craving Pardon of his Grace, and you all, if I perform it not as I
would.</p>
<p>His Grace doth first of all let you know, that he retaineth in
thankful memory the Love and Loyalty shewed to him by you, at your last
Meeting, in Establishment of his Royalty; freeing and discharging of his
Partakers, and confiscation of his Traytors and Rebels: more than which
could not come from Subjects to their Sovereign, in one action. This he
taketh so well at your hands, as he hath made it a Resolution to himself
to communicate with so loving and well-approved Subjects, in all Affairs
that are of publick nature, at home or abroad.</p>
<p>Two therefore are the causes of your present Assembling: the one, a
Forein business; the other, matter of Government at home.</p>
<p>The French King (as no doubt ye have heard) maketh at this present
hot War upon the Duke of Britain. His Army is now before Nantes, and
holdeth it straitly Besieged, being the principal City (if not in
Creremony and Preheminence, yet in Strength and Wealth) of that Duchy.
Ye may guess at his Hopes, by his attempting of the hardest part of the
War first. The cause of this War he knoweth best. He alledgeth the
entertaining and succouring of the Duke of Orleance, and some other
French Lords, whom the King taketh for his Enemies. Others divine of
other Matters. Both parts have by their Ambassadors divers times prayed
the King’s Ayds: The French King, Ayds or Neutrality; the Britons, Ayds
simply; for so their case requireth. The King, as a Christian Prince,
and blessed Son of the Holy Church, hath offered himself as a Mediator,
to treat a Peace between them. The French King yieldeth to Treat, but
will not stay the prosecution of the War. The Britons, that desire Peace
most, hearken to it least; not upon considence or stiffness, but upon
distrust of true meaning, seeing the War goes on. So as the King, after
as much pains and care to effect a Peace, as ever he took in any
business, not being able to remove the Prosecution on the one side, nor
the Distrust on the other, caused by that Prosecution, hath let fall the
Treaty; not repenting of it, but despairing of it now, as not likely to
succeed. Therefore by this Narrative you now understand the state of the
Question, whereupon the King prayeth your Advice; which is no other, but
whether he shall enter into an auxiliary and defensive War for the
Britons, against France.</p>
<p>And the better to open your understandings in this Affair, the King
bath commanded me to say somewhat to you from him, of the Persons that
do intervene in this Business; and somewhat of the Consequence thereof,
as it hath relation to this Kingdom; and somewhat of the Example of it
in general: making nevertherless no Conclusion or Judgement of any
Point, until his Grace hath received your faithful and politique
Advices.</p>
<p>First, for the King our Sovereign himself, who is the principal
Person you are to eye in this business; his Grace doth profess, that he
truly and constantly desireth to reign in Peace. But his Grace saith, he
will neither buy Peace with Dishonour, nor take it up at interest of
Danger to ensue; but shall think it a good Change, if it pleased God to
change the inward Troubles and Seditions, wherewith he hath been
hitherto exercised, into an honourable Forein War. And for the other two
Persons in this Action, the French King, and the Duke of Britain, his
Grace doth declare unto you, that they be the men, unto whom he is of
all other Friends and Allies most bounden: the one having held over him
his hand of Protection from the Tyrant; the other having reacht forth
unto him his hand of help, for the Recovery of his Kingdom. So that his
affection toward them in his natural Person, is upon equal terms. And
whereas you may have heard, that his Grace was enforced to fly out of
Britain into France, for doubts of being betrayed; his Grace would not
in any sort have that reflect upon the Duke of Britain, in defacement of
his former benefits: for that he is throughly informed, that it was but
the practice of some corrupt persons about him, during the time of his
Sickness, altogether without his consent or privity.</p>
<p>But howsoever these things do interess his Grace in his particular,
yet he knoweth well that the higher Bond that tyeth him to procure by
all means the safety and welfare of his loving Subjects, doth
dis-interess him of these Obligations of Gratitude, otherwise than thus;
that if his Grace be forced to make a War, he do it without Passion, or
Ambition.</p>
<p>For the consequence of this Action towards this Kingdom, it is much
as the French King’s intention is. For if it be no more, but to range
his Subjects to reason, who bear themselves stout upon the strength of
the Duke of Britain, it is nothing to us. But if it be in the French
King’s purpose, or if it should not be in his purpose, yet if it shall
follow all one, as if it were sought, that the French King shall make a
Province of Britain, and joyn it to the Crown of France: then it is
worthy the consideration, how this may import England, as well in the
increasement of the greatness of France, by the addition of such a
Countrey, that stretcheth his Boughs unto our Seas, as in depriving this
Nation, and leaving it so naked of so firm and assured Confederates, as
the Britons have always been. For then it will come to pass, that
whereas not long since, this Realm was mighty upon the Continent, first
in Territory, and after in Alliance, in respect of Burgundy and Britain,
which were Confederates indeed, but dependant Confederates; now the one
being already cast, partly into the greatness of France, and partly into
that of Austria, the other is like wholly to be cast into the greatness
of France, and this Island shall remain confined in effect within the
Salt-Waters, and girt about with the Coast-Countries of two mighty
Monarchs.</p>
<p>For the Example, it resteth likewise upon the same Question, upon the
French King’s intent. For if Britain be carried and swallowed up by
France, as the World abroad (apt to impute and construe the Actions of
Princes to Ambition) conceive it will; then it is an Example very
dangerous and universal, that the lesser Neighbour-Estate should be
devoured of the greater. For this may be the case of Scotland, towards
England; of Portugal, towards Spain; of the smaller Estates of Italy,
towards the greater; and so of Germany; or as if some of you of the
Commons might not live and dwell safely, besides some of these great
Lords. And the bringing in of this Example, will be chiefly laid to the
King’s charge, as to him that was most interessed and most able to
forbid it. But then on the other side, there is so fair a Pretext on the
French King’s part, (and yet pretext is never wanting to power) in
regard the danger imminent to his own Estate is such; as may make this
Enterprize seem rather a work of Necessity, than of Ambition, as doth in
reason correct the Danger of the Example. For that the Example of that
which is done in a man’s own defence, cannot be dangerous; because it is
in another’s power to avoid it. But in all this business, the King
remits himself to your grave and mature Advice, whereupon he purposeth
to rely.</p>
<p>This was the effect of the Lord Chancellor’s Speech touching the
Cause of Britain: For the King had commanded him to carry it so, as to
affect the Parliament towards the Business; but without engaging the
King in any express Declaration.</p>
<p>The Chancellor went on:</p>
<p>FOR that which may concern the Government at home, the King hath
commanded me to say unto you; That he thinketh there was never any King
(for the small time that he hath reigned) had greater and juster cause
of the two contrary Passions of Joy and Sorrow, than his Grace hath.
Joy, in respect of the rare and visible Favours of Almighty GOD in
girting the Imperial Sword upon his side; and assisting the same his
Sword against all his Enemies: and likewise in blessing him with so many
good and loving Servants and Subjects, which have never failed to give
him faithful Counsel, ready Obedience, and couragious Defence. Sorrow
for that it both not pleased God to suffer him to sheath his Sword, (as
he greatly desired, otherwise than for Administration of Justice) but
that he hath been forced to draw it so oft, to cut off Trayterous and
disloyal Subjects, whom (it seems) God hath left (a few amongst many
good) as the Canaanites among the People of Israel to be thorns in their
sides, to tempt and try them though the end hath been always (God’s Name
be blessed therefore) that the Destruction hath faln upon their own
Heads.</p>
<p>Wherefore his Grace saith; That he seeth that it is not the Blood
spelt in the Field, that will save the Blood in the City not the
Marshal’s Sword, that will set this Kingdom in perfect Peace: But that
the true way is, to stop the Seeds of Sedition and Rebellion in their
beginnings; and for that purpose to devise, confirm, and quicken good
and wholsom Laws, against Riots and unlawful Assemblies of People and
all Combinations and Confederacies of them; by Liveries, Tokens, and
other Badges of Factious dependance; that the Peace of the Land may by
these Ordinances, as by Bars of Iron, be soundly bound in and
strengthned, and all Force, both in Court, Countrey, and private Houses,
be supprest. The care hereof, which so much concern eth your selves, and
which the nature of the Times doth instantly calls for his Grace
commends to your Wisdoms.</p>
<p>And because it is the King’s desire, that this Peace, wherein he
hopeth to govern and maintain you, do not bear only’unto you. Leaves for
you to sit under the shade of them in Safety; but also should bear you
fruit of Riches, Wealth and Plenty: Therefore his Grace prays you to
take into consideration matter of Trade, as also the Manufactures of the
Kingdom, and to repress the bastard and barren Employment of Moneys, to
Usury and unlawful Exchanges, that they may be (as their natural use is)
turned upon Commerce, and lawful and Royal Trading. And likewise, that
Our People be set on work in Arts and Handycrafts; that the Realm may
subsist more of it self; that Idleness be avoided, and the draining out
of our Treasure, for Foreign Manufactures, stopped. But you are not to
rest here only, but to provide further, that whatsoever Merchandize
shall be brought in from beyond the Seas, may be employed upon the
Commodities of this Land; whereby the Kingdoms stock of Treasure may be
sure to be kept from being diminished, by any over-trading of the
Foreiner.</p>
<p>And lastly, because the King is well assured, that you would not have
him poor, that wishes you rich; he doubteth not, but that you will have
care, as well to maintain his Revenues, of Customs, and all other
Natures, as also to supply him with your loving Ayds, if the case shall
so require. The rather, for that you know the King is a good Husband,
and but a Steward in effect for the Publick; and that what comes from
you is but as Moisture drawn from the Earth, which gathers into a Cloud,
and falls back upon the Earth again. And you know well, how the Kingdoms
about you grow more and more in Greatness, and the Times are stirring;
and therefore not fit to find the King with an empty Purse. More I have
not to say to you; and wish, that what hath been said, had been better
exprest: But that your Wisdoms and good Affections will supply. GOD
bless your Doings.</p>
<p>IT was no hard matter to dispose and affect the Parliament in this
Business, as well in respect of the Emulation between the Nations, and
the Envy at the late growth of the French Monarchy; as in regard of the
Danger, to suffer the French to make their approaches upon England, by
obtaining so goodly a Maritim Province, full of Sea-Towns, and Havens,
that might do mischief to the English, either by Invasion, or by
interruption of Traffick. The Parliament was also moved with the point
of Oppression; for although the French seemed to speak Reason, yet
Arguments are ever with multitudes too weak for Suspitions. Wherefore
they did advise the King roundly to embrace the Britons Quarrel, and to
send them speedy Ayds, and with much alacrity and forwardness granted to
the King a great rate of Subsidy, in contemplation of these Ayds. But
the King both to keep a decency towards the French King, to whom he
himself to be obliged, and indeed desirous rather to shew War, than to
make it; sent new solemn Ambassadors to intimate unto him, the Decree of
his Estates, and to iterate his motion, that the French would desist
from Hostilitiy; or if War must follow, to desire him to take it in good
part, if at the motion of his People, who were sensible of the cause of
the Britons as the ancient Friends, and Confederates, he did send them
Succours; with protestation nevertheless, that to save all Treaties and
Laws of Friendship, he had limited his Force, to proceed in ayd of the
Britons, but in no wise to war upon the French, otherwise than as they
maintained the possession of Britain. But before this formal Ambassage
arrived, the Party of the Duke had received a great blow, and grew to
manifest declination. For near the Town of Saint Alban in Britain, a
Battel had been given, where the Britons were overthrown, and the Duke
of Orleance, and the Prince of Orange taken Prisoners; there being slain
on the Britons part six thousand men, and amongst them the Lord
Woodvile, and almost all his Souldiers, valiantly fighting. And of the
French part one thousand two hundred, with their Leader, James Galeot, a
great Commander.</p>
<p>When the news of this Battel came over into England, it was time for
the King (who now had no subterfuge to continue further Treaty, and saw
before his Eyes, that Britain went so speedily for lost, contrary to his
hopes, knowing also that with his People and Foreiners both, he
sustained no small Envy and disreputation for his former delays) to
dispatch with all possible speed his Succour into Britain; which he did
under the Conduct of Robert Lord Brook, to the number of eight thousand
choise men, and well armed; who having a fair wind, in few hours landed
in Britain, and joyned themselves forthwith to those Briton Forces, that
remained after the Defeat, and marched straight on to find the Enemy,
and encamped fast by them. The French wisely husbanding the possession
of a Victory, and well acquainted with the Courage of the English,
especially when they are fresh, kept themselves within their Trenches,
being strongly lodged, and resolved not to give Battel. But meanwhile,
to harrass and weary the English, they did upon all advantages set upon
them with their Light-horse; wherein nevertheless they received commonly
loss, especially by means of the English Archers.</p>
<p>But upon these Atchievements Francis Duke of Britain deceased; an
accident that the King might easily have foreseen, and ought to have
reckoned upon, and provided for, but that the Point of Reputation, when
news first came of the Battel lost, (that somewhat must be done) did
over-bear the Reason of War.</p>
<p>After the Duke’s decease, the principal persons of Britain, partly
bought, partly through faction, put all things into confusion; so as the
English not finding Head or Body with whom to joyn their Forces, and
being in jealousie of Friends, as well as in danger of Enemies, and the
Winter begun, returned home five Months after their landing. So the
Battel of Saint Alban, the death of the Duke, and the retire of the
English Succours were (after some time) the causes of the loss of that
Duchy; which action some accounted as a blemish of the King’s Judgement;
but most, but as the misfortune of his times.</p>
<p>But howsoever the temporary Fruit of the Parliament in their Ayd and
Advice given for Britain, took not, nor prospered not; yet the lasting
Fruit of Parliament, which is good and wholesom Laws, did prosper, and
doth yet continue to this day. For according to the Lord Chancellor’s
admonition, there were that Parliament divers excellent Laws ordained,
concerning the Points which the King recommended.</p>
<p>First, the Authority of the Star-Chamber, which before subsisted by
the ancient Common-Laws of the Realm, was confirmed in certain Cases by
Act of Parliament. This Court is one of the sagest and noblest
Institutions of this Kingdom. For in the distribution of Courts of
Ordinary Justice (besides the High Court of Parliament) in which
distribution the King’s-Bench holdeth the Pleas of the Crown, the
Common-Place, Pleas-Civil, the Exchequer-Pleas concerning the King’s
Revenue, and the Chancery the Pretorian power for mitigating the rigour
of Law, in case of extremity, by the conscience of a good man; there was
nevertheless always reserved a high and preheminent power to the King’s
Council, in Causes that might in example, or consequence, concern the
state of the Common-wealth, which if they were Criminal, the Council
used to sit in the Chamber, called the StarChamber; if Civil, in the
White-Chamber, or White-Hall. And as the Chancery had the Pretorian
power for Equity, so the StarChamber had the Censorian power for
Offences, under the degree of Capital. This Court of Star-Chamber is
compounded of good Elements: for it consisteth of four kinds of Persons,
Counsellors, Peers, Prelates, and chief Judges. It discerneth also
principally of four kinds of Causes; Forces, Frauds, Crimes various of
Stellionate, and the Inchoations or middle, acts towards Crimes capital;
or heinous, not actually committed or perpetrated. But that which was
principally aimed at by this act was Force, and the two chief Supports
of Force, Combination of Multitudes, and Maintenance or Headship of
Great persons.</p>
<p>From the general peace of the Countrey, the King’s care went on to
the peace of the King’s House, and the security of his great Officers
and Counsellors. But this Law was somewhat of a strange composition and
temper; That if any of the King’s Servants under the degree of a Lord,
do conspire the death of any of the King’s Council; or Lord of the
Realm, it is made Capital. This Law was thought to be procured by the
Lord Chancellor, who being a stern and haughty man, and finding he had
some mortal Enemies in Court, provided for his own safety; drowning the
envy of it in a general Law, by communicating the priviledge with all
other Counsellors and Peers, and yet not daring to extend it further,
than to the King’s Servants in Check-roll, lest it should have been too
harsh to the Gentlemen, and other Commons of the Kingdom; who might have
thought their ancient Liberty, and the clemency of the Laws of England
invaded, If the will in any case of Felony should be made the deed. And
yet the reason which the Act yieldeth (that is to say, That he that
conspireth the death of Counsellors may be thought indirectly, and by a
mean conspire the death of the King himself,) is indifferent to all
Subjects, as well as to Servants in Court. But it seemeth this sufficed
to serve the Lord Chancellor’s turn at this time. But yet he lived to
need a General Law, for that he grew afterwards as odious to the
Countrey, as he was then to the Court.</p>
<p>From the peace of the King’s House, the King’s care extended to the
peace of Private Houses and Families. For there was an excellent Moral
Law molded thus; The taking and carrying away of Women forcibly, and
against their will (except FemaleWards and Bond-Women) was made Capital.
The Parliament wisely and justly conceiving, that the obtaining of Women
by force into Possession (howsoever afterwards Assent might follow by
Allurements) was but a Rape drawn forth in length, because the first
Force drew on all the rest.</p>
<p>There was made also another Law for Peace in general, and repressing
of Murthers and Man-slaughters, and was in amendment of the Common Laws
of the Realm, being this: That whereas by the Common Law, the King’s
Suit in case of Homicide, did expect the Year and the Day, allowed to
the Parties Suit by way of Appeal; and that it was found by experience,
that the Party was many times compounded with, and many times wearied
with the Suit, so that in the end such Suit was let fall, and by that
time the matter was in a manner forgotten, and thereby Prosecution at
the King’s Suit by Indictment (which is ever best, Flagrante crimine)
neglected; it was Ordained, That the Suit by Indictment might be taken
as well at any time within the Year and the Day, as after, not
prejudicing nevertheless the Parties Suit.</p>
<p>The King began also then, as well in Wisdom as in Justice to pare a
little the Priviledge of Clergy, ordaining, That Clerks convict should
be burned in the hand; both because they might taste of some corporal
Punishment, and that they might carry a Brand of Infamy. But for this
good Acts sake, the King himself was after branded by Perkin’s
Proclamation, for an execrable breaker of the Rites of Holy Church.</p>
<p>Another Law was made for the better Peace of the Countrey; by which
Law the King’s Officers and Farmors were to forfeit their Places and
Holds, in case of unlawful Retainer, or partaking in Routs and unlawful
Assemblies.</p>
<p>These were the Laws that were made for repressing of Force, which
those times did chiefly require; and were so prudently framed, as they
are found fit for all succeeding times, and so continue to this day.</p>
<p>There were also made good and politick Laws that Parliament against
Usury, which is the Bastard-use of Money; And against unlawful
Chievances and Exchanges, which is Bastard-Usury; And also for the
Security of the King’s Customs; And for the Employment of the Procedures
of Forein Commodities, brought in by Merchant-strangers, upon the
Native-Commodities of the Realm; together with some other Laws of less
importance.</p>
<p>But howsoever the Laws made in that Parliament did bear good and
wholesom Fruit; yet the Subsidy granted at the same time, bare a Fruit,
that proved harsh and bitter. All was inned at last into the King’s
Barn; but it was after a Storm. For when the Commissioners entred into
the Taxation of the Subsidy in Yorkshire, and the Bishoprick of Duresm;
the People upon a sudden grew into great mutiny, and said openly, that
they had endured of late years a thousand miseries, and neither could
nor would pay the Subsidy. This (no doubt) proceeded not simply of any
present necessity, but much by reason of the old humour of those
Countries, where the memory of King Richard was so strong, that it lyes
like Lees in the bottom of mens hearts; and if the Vessel was but
stirred, it would come up. And (no doubt) it was partly also by the
instigation of some factious Malecontents, that bare principal stroke
amongst them. Hereupon the Commissioners being somewhat astonished,
deferred the matter unto the Earl of Northumberland, who was the
principal man of Authority in those Parts. The Earl forthwith wrote unto
the Court, signifying to the King plainly enough in what flame he found
the people of those Countries, and praying the King’s direction. The
King wrote back peremptorily, That he would not have one penny abated,
of that which had been granted to him by Parliament, both because it
might encourage other Countries to pray the like Release or Mitigation,
and chiefly, because he would never endure, that the base Multitude
should frustrate the Authority of the Parliament, wherein their Votes
and Consents were concluded. Upon this dispatch from Court, the Earl
assembled the principal Justices and Free-holders of the Countrey; and
speaking to them in that imperious Language wherein the King had written
to him, which needed not, (save that an harsh business was unfortunately
fallen into the hands of a harsh man,) did not only irritate the People,
but make them conceive, by the stoutness and haughtiness of delivery of
the King’s Errand; that himself was the Author or principal Perswader of
that Counsel. Whereupon the meaner sort routed together, and suddenly
assailing the Earl in his house, slew him, and divers of his servants.
And rested not there, but creating for their Leader Sir John Egremond, a
factious person, and one that had of a long time born an ill Talent
towards the King; and being animated also by a base Fellow, called John
A Chamber, a very Boutefeu, who bare much sway amongst the vulgar and
popular, entred into open Rebellion, and gave out in flat terms that
they would go against King Henry, and fight with him for the maintenance
of their Liberties.</p>
<p>When the King was advertised of this new Insurrection (being almost a
Fever that took him every year) after his manner little troubled
therewith, he sent Thomas Earl of Surrey (whom he had a little before
not only released out of the Tower, and pardoned, but also received to
special favour) with a competent Power against the Rebels; who fought
with the principal Band of them, and defeated them, and took alive John
A Chamber, their firebrand. As for Sir John Egremond, he fled into
Flanders, to the Lady Margaret of Burgundy; whose Palace was the
Sanctuary and Receptacle of all Traytors against the King. John A
Chamber was Executed at York, in great state; for he was hanged upon a
Gibbet raised a Stage higher in the midst of a square Gallows, as a
Traytor paramount; and a number of his men that were his chief
Complices, were hanged upon the lower Story round about him; and the
rest were generally pardoned. Neither did the King himself omit his
custom, to be first or second in all his Warlike Exploits; making good
his Word, which was usual with him when he heard of Rebels; that He
desired but to see them. For immediately after he had sent down the Earl
of Surrey, he marched towards them himself in person. And although in
his journey he heard news of the Victory, yet he went on as far as York,
to pacifie and settle those Countries. And that done returned to London,
leaving the Earl of Surrey for his Lieutenant in the Northern parts, and
Sir Richard Tunstal for his principal Commissioner, to levy the Subsidy,
whereof he did not remit a Denier.</p>
<p>About the same time that the King lost so good a Servant, as the Earl
of Northumberland, he lost likewise a faithful Friend and Allie of James
the Third, King of Scotland, by a miserable disaster. For this
unfortunate Prince, after a long smother of discontent, and hatred of
many of his Nobility and People, breaking forth at times into seditions
and alterations of Court, was at last distressed by them, having taken
Arms, and surprised the person of Prince James his Son, partly by force,
partly by threats that they would otherwise deliver up the Kingdom to
the King of England, to shadow their Rebellion, and to be the titular
and painted Head of those Arms. Whereupon the King (finding himself too
weak) sought unto King Henry, as also unto the Pope, and the King of
France, to compose those troubles, between him and his Subjects. The
King accordingly interposed their Mediation in a round and Princely
manner: Not only by way of request and perswasion, but also by way of
protestation of menace; declaring, that they thought it to be the common
Cause of all Kings, If Subjects should be suffered to give Laws unto
their Sovereign; and that they would accordingly resent it, and revenge
it. But the Rebels that had shaken off the greater Yoak of Obedience,
had likewise cast away the lesser Tye of Respect. And Fury prevailing
above Fear, made answer, That there was no talking of Peace, except the
King would resign his Crown. Whereupon (Treaty of Accord taking no
place) it came to a Battel, at Bannocks-bourn by Strivelin. In which
Battel, the King transported with wrath and just indignation,
inconsiderately fighting and precipitating the charge, before his whole
numbers came up to him, was (notwithstanding the contrary express and
straight commandment of the Prince his Son) slain in the Pursuit, being
fled to a Mill, situate in the field, where the Battel was fought.</p>
<p>As for the Pope’s Embassy, which was sent by Adrian de Castello an
Italian Legate, (and perhaps, as those times were, might have prevailed
more) it came too late for the Embassy, but not for the Ambassador. For
passing through England, and being honourably entertained, and received
of King Henry; (who ever applied himself with much respect to the See of
Rome) he fell into great grace with the King, and great familiarity and
friendship with Morton the Chancellor. In so much as the King taking a
liking to him, and finding him to his mind, preferred him to the
Bishoprick of Hereford, and afterwards to that of Bath and Wells, and
employed him in many of his affairs of State, that had relation to Rome.
He was a man of great learning, wisdom, and dexterity in business of
State; and having not long after ascended to the degree of Cardinal,
payd the King large tribute of his gratitude, in diligent and judicious
advertisement of the occurrents of Italy. Nevertheless in the end of his
time, he was partaker of the conspiracy, which Cardinal Alphonso
Petrucci, and some other Cardinals had plotted against the life of Pope
Leo. And this offence in it self so heinous, was yet in him aggravated
by the motive thereof, which was not malice or discontent, but an
aspiring mind to the Papacy. And in this height of impiety there wanted
not an intermixture of levity and folly; for that (as was generally
believed) he was animated to expect the Papacy, by a fatal mockery, the
Prediction of a Soothsayer; which was, That one should succeed Pope Leo,
whose name should be Adrian, an aged man of mean birth, and of great
learning and wisdom. By which character, and figure, he took himself to
be described, though it were fulfilled of Adrian the Fleming, Son of a
Dutch Brewer, Cardinal of Tortosa, and Preceptor unto Charles the Fifth,
the same that not changing his Christen-name, was afterward called
Adrian the Sixth.</p>
<p>But these things happened in the year following, which was the fifth
of this King. But in the end of the fourth year the King had called
again his Parliament, not as it seemeth for any particular occasion of
State. But the former Parliament being ended somewhat suddenly, in
regard of the preparation for Britain, the King thought he had not
remunerated his People sufficiently with good Laws, which evermore was
his Retribution for Treasure. And finding by the Insurrection in the
North, there was discontentment abroad, in respect of the Subsidy, he
thought it good to give his Subjects yet further contentment, and
comfort in that kind. Certainly his times for good Commonwealths Laws
did . So as he may justly be celebrated for the best Lawgiver to this
Nation, after King Edward the First. For his Laws (who so marks them
well) are deep, and not vulgar: not made upon the spur of a particular
Occasion for the present, but out of Providence of the future, to make
the Estate of his People still more and more happy; after the manner of
the Legislators in ancient and Heroical times.</p>
<p>First therefore he made a Law, suitable to his own Acts and Times.
For as himself had in his Person and Marriage made a final Concord, in
the great Suit and Title for the Crown; so by this Law he setled the
like Peace and Quiet in the private Possessions of the Subjects.
Ordaining, That Fines thence-forth should be final, to conclude all
Strangers Rights; and that upon Fines levied, and solemnly proclaimed,
the Subject should have his time of Watch for five years after his Title
accrued; which if he forepassed, his Right should be bound for ever
after; with some exception nevertheless, of Minors, Married-women, and
such incompetent Persons.</p>
<p>This Statute did in effect but restore an ancient Statute of the
Realm, which was it self also made but in affirmance of the Common-Law.
The alteration had been by a Statute, commonly called the Statute of
Non-claim, made in the time of Edward the Third. And surely this Law was
a kind of Prognostick of the good Peace, which since his time hath (for
the most part) continued in this Kingdom, until this day. For Statutes
of Nonclaim are fit for times of War, when mens heads are troubled, that
they cannot intend their Estate; but Statutes, that quiet Possessions,
are fittest for times of Peace, to extinguish Suits and Contentions,
which is one of the Banes, of Peace.</p>
<p>Another Statute was made of singular Policy, for the Population
apparently, and (if it be throughly considered) for the Soldiery, and
Militar Forces of the Realm.</p>
<p>Inclosures at that time began to be more frequent, whereby Arable
Land (which could not be manured without People and Families) was turned
into Pasture, which was easily rid by a few Herds-men; and Tenancies for
Years, Lives, and At Will (whereupon much of the Yeomandry lived) were
turned into Demesnes. This bred a decay of People, and (by consequence)
a decay of Towns, Churches, Tythes, and the like. The King likewise knew
full well, and in no wise forgot, that there ensued withal upon this a
decay and diminution of Subsidy and Taxes; for the more Gentlemen, ever
the lower Books of Subsidies. In remedying of this inconvenience, the
King’s Wisdom was admirable, and the Parliaments at that time.
Inclosures they would not forbid, for that had been to forbid the
improvement of the Patrimony of the Kingdom; nor Tillage they would not
compel, for that was to strive with Nature and Utility. But they took a
course to take away depopulating Inclosures, and depopulating Pasturage,
and yet not by that name, or by any Imperious express Prohibition, but
by consequence. The Ordinance was, That all Houses of Husbandry, that
were used with twenty Acres of Ground, and upwards, should be maintained
and kept up for ever; together with a competent proportion of Land to be
used and occupied with them; and in no wise to be severed from them, as
by another Statute, made afterwards in his Successors time, was more
fully declared. This upon Forfeiture to be taken; not by way of Popular
Action, but by seisure of the Land it self, by the King and Lords of the
Fee, as to half the Profits, till the Houses and Lands were restored. By
this means the Houses being kept up, did of necessity enforce a Dweller;
and the proportion of Land for Occupation being kept up, did of
necessity enforce that Dweller, not to be a Beggar or Cottager, but a
man of some substance, that might keep Hinds and Servants, and set the
Plough on goingThis did wonderfully concern the Might and Manner-hood of
the Kingdom, to have Ferms, as it were of a Standard sufficient to
maintain an able Body out of Penury, and did in effect amortize a great
part of the Lands of the Kingdom unto the Hold and Occupation of the
Teomanry or Middle people, of a condition between Gentlemen and
Cottagers or Pesants. Now, how much this did advance the Militar power
of the Kingdom, is apparent by the true Principles of War, and the
examples of other Kingdoms. For it hath been held by the general Opinion
of men of best Judgement in the Wars (howsoever some few have varied,
and that it may receive some distinction of Case) that the principal
strength of an Army consisteth in the Infantry or Foot. And to make good
Infantry, it requireth men bred, not in a servile or indigent fashion,
but in some free and plentiful manner. Therefore if a State run most to
Noble-men and Gentlemen, and that the Husband-men and Plough-men be but
as their Work-folks and Labourers, or else meer Cottagers, (which are
but Housed-Beggars) you may have a good Cavalry, but never good stable
Bands of Foot; like to Coppice-Woods, that if you leave in them Staddles
too thick, they will run to Bushes and Bryars, and have little clean
Underwood. And this is to be seen in France, and Italy, and some other
parts abroad, where in effect all is Nobless, or Pesantry, I speak of
people out of Towns, and no middle people; and therefore no good Forces
of Foot: In so much, as they are enforced to employ Mercenary Bands, of
Switzers and the like, for their Battuilions of Foot; Whereby also it
comes to pass, that those Nations have much People, and few Soldiers.
Whereas the King saw, that contrariwise it would follow, that England,
though much less in Territory, yet should have infinitely more Soldiers
of their native Forces, than those other Nations have. Thus did the King
secretly sow Hidra’s teeth, whereupon (according to the Poets fiction)
should rise up Armed men for the service of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The King also (having care to make his Realm potent, as well by Sea
as by Land) for the better maintenance of the Navy, Ordained, That Wines
and Woads from the parts of Gascoign and Languedock; should not be
brought but in English Bottoms; Bowing the ancient Policy of this
Estate, from consideration of Plenty, to consideration of Power. For
that almost all the ancient Statutes incite by all means
Merchant-strangers, to bring in all sorts of Commodities; having for end
cheapness, and not looking to the point of State concerning the
Naval-power.</p>
<p>The King also made a Statute in that Parliament Monitory and
Minatory, towards Justices of Peace, that they should duly execute their
Office, inviting complaints against them, first to their Fellow
Justices, then to the Justices of Assize, then to the King or
Chancellor; and that a Proclamation, which he had published of that
Tenor, should be read in open Sessions four times a year, to keep them
awake. Meaning also to have his Laws executed, and thereby to reap
either Obedience or Forfeitures; (wherein towards his latter times he
did decline too much to the left hand) he did ordain remedy against the
practice that was grown in use, to stop and damp Informations upon Penal
Laws, by procuring Informations by collusion to be put in by the
Confederates of the Delinquents, to be faintly prosecuted, and let fall
at pleasure, and pleading them in Bar of the Informations, which were
prosecuted with effect.</p>
<p>He made also Laws for the correction of the Mint, and counterfeiting
of Forein Coyn currant. And that no payment in Gold should be made to
any Merchant-stranger, the better to keep Treasure within the Realm, for
that Gold was the metal that lay in least room.</p>
<p>He made also Statutes for the maintenance of Drapery, and the keeping
of Wools within the Realm; and not only so, but for stinting, and
limiting the prices of Cloth, one for the finer, and another for the
courser sort. Which I note, both because it was a rare thing to set
prices by Statute, especially upon our HomeCommodities; and because of
the wise Model of the Act, not prescribing Prices, but stinting them not
to exceed a rate, that the Clothier might drape accordingly as he might
afford.</p>
<p>Divers other good Statutes were made that Parliament, but these were
the principal. And here I do desire those, into whose hands this Work
shall fall, that they do take in good part my long insisting upon the
Laws that were made in this King’s Reign; whereof I have these reasons:
Both because it was the preheminent virtue and merit of this King, to
whose memory I do honour, and because it hath some correspondence to my
Person; but chiefly, because (in my judgement) it is some defect even in
the best Writers of History that they do not often enough summarily
deliver and set down the most memorable Laws, that passed in the times
whereof they write, being indeed the principal Acts of Peace. For
although they may be had in Original Books of Law themselves; yet that
informeth not the judgement of Kings and Counsellors, and Persons of
Estate, so well as to see them described, and entred in the Table and
Pourtrait of the Times.</p>
<p>About the same time, the King had a Loan from the City of Four
thousand pounds; which was double to that they lent before, and was
duely and orderly payd back at the day, as the former likewise had been;
the King ever choosing rather to borrow too soon, than to pay too late,
and so keeping up his Credit.</p>
<p>Neither had the King yet cast off his cares and hopes touching
Britain, but thought to master the occasion by Policy, though his Arms
had been unfortunate, and to bereave the French King of the fruit of his
Victory. The summ of his design was, to encourage Maximilian to go on
with his suit, for the Marriage of Ann, the Heir of Britain, and to ayd
him to the consummation thereof. But the affairs of Maximilian were at
that time in great trouble and combustion, by a Rebellion of his
Subjects in Flanders; especially those of Bruges and Gaunt, whereof the
Town of Bruges (at such time as Maximilian was there in person) had
suddenly armed in tumult, and slain some of his principal Officers, and
taken himself prisoner, and held him in durance, till they had enforced
him, and some of his Counsellors, to take a solemn Oath to pardon all
their offences, and never to question and revenge the same in time to
come. Nevertheless Frederick the Emperor would not suffer this reproach
and indignity offered to his Son to pass, but made sharp Wars upon
Flanders, to reclaim and chastise the Rebels. But the Lord Ravenstein, a
principal person about Maximilian, and one that had taken the Oath of
Abolition with his Master, pretending the Religion thereof, but indeed
upon private ambition, and (as it was thought) instigated and corrupted
from France, forsook the Emperor and Maximilian his Lord, and made
himself an Head of the popular Party, and seized upon the Towns of Ipre
and Sluce, with both the Castles; and forthwith sent to the Lord Cordes,
Governour of Picardy under the French King, to desire ayd, and to move
him, that he on the behalf of the French King would be Protector of the
united Towns, and by force of Arms reduce the rest. The Lord Cordes was
ready to embrace the occasion, which was partly of his own setting, and
sent forthwith greater Forces, than it had been possible for him to
raise on the sudden, if he had not looked for such a summons before, in
ayd of the Lord Ravenstein, and the Flemmings, with instructions to
invest the Towns between France and Bruges. The French Forces besieged a
little Town called Dixmue, where part of the Flemish Forces joyned with
them. While they lay at this siege, the King of England, upon pretence
of the safety of the English Pale about Calice, but in truth being loth
that Maximilian should become contemptible, and thereby be shaken off by
the States of Britain about this Marriage, sent over the Lord Morley
with a thousand men unto the Lord Daubigny, then Deputy of Calice, with
secret instructions to ayd Maximilian, and to raise the siege of Dixmue.
The Lord Daubigny (giving it out that all was for the strengthning of
the English Marches) drew out of the Garrisons, of Calice, Hammes, and
Guines, to the number of a thousand men more. So that with the fresh
Succours that came under the Conduct of the Lord Morley, they made up to
the number of two thousand, or better. Which Forces joyning with some
Companies of Almains, put themselves into Dixmue, not perceived by the
Enemies; and passing through the Town with some re-enforcement, (from
the Forces that were in the Town) assailed the Enemies Camp, negligently
guarded, as being out of fear; where there was a bloody Fight, in which
the English and their Partakers obtained the Victory, and slew to the
number of eight thousand men, with the loss on the English part of a
hundred or thereabouts; amongst whom was the Lord Morley. They took also
their great Ordnance, with much rich spoils, which they carried to
Newport, whence the Lord Daubigny returned to Calice, leaving the hurt
men, and some other Voluntaries in Newport. But the Lord Cordes being at
Ipre with a great power of men, thinking to recover the loss and
disgrace of the Fight at Dixmue, came presently on, and sate down before
Newport and besieged it; and after some days siege, he resolved to try
the fortune of an Assault: Which he did one day, and succeeded therein
so far, that he had taken the principal Tower and Fort in that City, and
planted upon it the French Banner. Whence nevertheless they were
presently beaten forth by the English, by the help of some fresh
Succours of Archers arriving by good fortune (at the instant) in the
Haven of Newport; Whereupon the Lord Cordes discouraged, and measuring
the new Succours (which were small) by the Success, (which was great,)
levied his Siege. By this means, matters grew more exasperate between
the two Kings of England and France, for that in the War of Flanders,
the auxiliary Forces of French and English were much blooded one against
another. Which Blood rankled the more, by the vain words of the Lord
Cordes, that declared himself an open Enemy of the English, beyond that
that appertained to the present Service; making it a common by-word of
his, That he could be content to lye in Hell seven years, so he might
win Calice from the English.</p>
<p>The King having thus upheld the Reputation of Maximilian, advised him
now to press on his Marriage with Britain to a conclusion. Which
Maximilian accordingly did, and so far forth prevailed both with the
young Lady, and with the principal persons about her, as the Marriage
was consummate by Proxy, with a Ceremony at that time in these parts
new. For she was not only publickly contracted, but stated as a Bride,
and solemnly Bedded; and after she was laid, there came in Maximilian’s
Ambassador with Letters of Procuration, and in the presence of sundry
Noble Personages, Men and Women, put his Leg (stript naked to the Knee)
between the Espousal-Sheets; to the end, that that Ceremony might be
thought to amount to a Consummation, and actual Knowledge. This done,
Maximilian (whose property was to leave things then, when they were
almost come to perfection, and to end them by imagination; like ill
Archers, that draw not their Arrows up to the Head: and who might as
easily have Bedded the Lady himself, as to have made a Play and Disguise
of it) thinking now all assured, neglected for a time his further
proceeding, and intended his Wars. Mean-while, the French King
(consulting with his Divines, and finding that this pretended
Consummation was rather an Invention of Court, than any ways valid by
the Laws of the Church) went more really to work, and by secret
Instruments and cunning Agents, as well Matrans about the young Lady, as
Counsellors, first sought to remove the point of Religion and Honour out
of the mind of the Lady her self, wherein there was a double labour. For
Maximilian was not only contracted unto the Lady, but Maximilian’s
Daughter was likewise contracted to King Charles. So as the Marriage
halted upon both feet, and was not clear on either side: But for the
Contract with King Charles, the Exception lay plain and fair, for that
Maximilian’s Daughter was under years of Consent, and so not bound by
Law, but a power of Disagreement left to either part. But for the
Contract made by Maximilian with the Lady her self, they were harder
driven; having nothing to alledge, but that it was done without the
consent of her Sovereign Lord, King Charles, whose Ward and Client she
was, and he to her in place of a Father; and therefore it was void, and
of no force, for want of such Consent. Which defect (they said) though
it would not evacuate a Marriage, after Cohabitation, and Actual
Consummation, yet it was enough to make void a Contract. For as for a
pretended Consummation, they made sport with it, and said; That it was
an argument, that Maximilian was a Widdower, and a cold Wooer, that
could content himself to be a Bridegroom by Deputy, and would not make a
little Journey, to put all out of question. So that the young Lady;
wrought upon by these Reasons, finely instilled by such as the French
King, (who spared for no Rewards or Promises) had made on his side; and
allured likewise by the present Glory and Greatness of King Charles,
(being also a young King, and a Batchelor) and loth to make her Countrey
the Seat of a long and miserable War; secretly yielded to accept of King
Charles: But during this secret Treaty with the Lady, the better to save
it from Blasts of Opposition and Interruption, King Charles resorting to
his wonted Arts, and thinking to carry the Marriage, as he had carried
the Wars, by entertaining the King of England in vain belief, sent a
solemn Ambassage by Francis Lord of Luxemberg, Charles Marignian and
Robert Gaguein, General of the Order of the Bonnes Hommes of the
Trinity, to treat Peace and League with the King; accoupling it with an
Article in nature of a Request, that the French King might with the
King’s good will (according unto his right of Seigniory and Tutelage)
dispose of the Marriage of the young Duchess of Britain, as he should
think good; offering by a Judicial proceeding to make void the Marriage
of Maximilian by Proxy. Also all this while the better to amuse the
World, he did continue in his Court and custody the Daughter of
Maximilian, who formerly had been sent unto him, to be bred and educated
in France; not dismissing or renvoying her, but contrariwise professing
and giving out strongly, that he meant to proceed with that Match. And
that for the Duchess of Britain, he desired only to preserve his right
of Seigniory, and to give her in Marriage to some such Allie, as might
depend upon him.</p>
<p>When the three Commissioners came to the Court of England, they
delivered their Ambassage unto the King, who remitted them to his
Council; where some days after they had Audience, and made their
Proposition by the Prior of the Trinity, (who though he were third in
place, yet was held the best Speaker of them) to this effect:</p>
<p>MY Lords, the King our Master, the greatest and mightiest King that
reigned in France since Charles the Great, (whose Name he beareth) hath
nevertheless thought it no disparagement to his Greatness, at this time
to propound a Peace, yea, and to pray a Peace with the King of England.
For which purpose he hath sent us his Commissioners instructed and
enabled with full and ample power, to treat and conclude; giving us
further in charge, to open in some other business the secrets of his own
intentions. These be indeed the pretious Love-tokens between great
Kings, to communicate one with another the true state of their Affairs,
and to pass by nice Points of Honour, which ought not to give Law unto
Affection, This I do assure your Lordships; It is not possible for you
to imagine the true and cordial Love, that the King our Master beareth
to your Sovereign, except you were near him, as we are. He useth his
Name with so great respect; he remembreth their first acquaintance at
Paris with so great contentment; nay, he never speaks of him, but that
presently he falls into discourse of the miseries of great Kings, in
that they cannot converse with their Equals, but with Servants. This
affection to your King’s Person and Virtues, GOD hath put into the Heart
of our Master, no doubt for the good of Christendom, and for purposes
yet unknown to us all. For other Root it cannot have, since it was the
same to the earl of Richmond, that it is now to the King of England.
This is therefore the first motive that makes our King to desire Peace,
and League with your Sovereign: Good affection, and somewhat that he
finds in his own Heart. This affection is also armed with reason of
Estate. For our King doth in all candour and frankness of dealing open
himself unto you; that having an honourable, yea, and a Holy purpose, to
make a Voyage and War in remote parts, he considereth that it will be of
no small effect, in point of Reputation to his Enterprize, if it be
known abroad, that he ulin in good peace with all his Neighbour Princes,
and specially with the King of England, whom for good causes he
esteemeth most.</p>
<p>But now (my Lords) give me leave to use a few words to remove all
scruples and miss-understandings, between your Sovereign and ours,
concerning some late Actions; which if they be not cleared, may perhaps
hinder this Peace. To the end, that for matters past, neither King may
conceive unkindness of other, nor think the other conceiveth unkindness
of him. The late Actions are two; that of Britain, and that of Flanders.
In both which, it is true, that the Subjects swords of both Kings, have
encountred and stricken, and the ways and inclinations also of the two
Kings, in respect of their Confederates and Allies, have severed.</p>
<p>For that of Britain, The King your Sovereign knoweth best what hath
passed. It was a War of necessity on our Masters part. And though the
Motives of it were sharp and piquant as could be, yet did be make that
War rather with an Olive-branch, than a Laurel-branch in his hand, more
desiring Peace than Victory. Besides, from time to time he sent (as it
were) Blank-papers to your King, to write the conditions of Peace. For
though both his Honour and Safety went upon it, yet he thought neither
of them too precious, to put into the King of England’s hands. Neither
doth our King on the other side make any unfriendly interpretation, of
your King’s sending of Succours to the Duke of Britain; for the King
knoweth well, that many things must be done of Kings for satisfaction of
their People, and it is not hard to discern what is a King’s own. But
this matter of Britain is now (by the Act of GOD) ended and passed; and
(as the King hopesh) like the way of a Ship in the Sea, without leaving
any impression in either of the Kings minds; as he is sure, for his
part, it hath not done in his.</p>
<p>For the Action of Flanders; As the former of Britain was a War of
Necessity, so this was a War of Justice; which with a good King is of
equal necessity, with danger of Estate, for else he should leave to be a
King. The Subjects of Burgundy are Subjects in Chief to the Crown of
France, and their Duke the Homager and Vassal of France. They had wont
to be good Subjects, howsoever Maximilian hath of late distempered them.
They fled to the King for Justice, and deliverance from Oppression.
Justice he could not deny; Purchase he did not seek. This was good for
Maximilian, if he could have seen it in people mutined, to arrest Fury,
and prevent Despair. My Lords, it may be this I have said is needless,
save that the King our Master is tender in any thing, that may but
glance upon the Friendship of England. The amity between the two Kings
(no doubt) stands entire and inviolate. And that their Subjects swords
have clashed, it is nothing unto the publick Peace of the Crowns; it
being a thing very usual in Auxiliary Forces of the best and straitest
Confederates, to meet and draw blood in the Field. Nay, many times there
be Ayds of the same Nation on both sides, and yet it is not (for all
that) A Kingdom divided in it self.</p>
<p>It resteth (my Lords) that I impart unto you a matter, that I know
your Lordships all will much rejoyce to hear; as that which importeth
the Christian Common-weal more, than any Action that hath hapned of long
time. The King our Master hath a purpose and determination, to make War
upon the Kingdom of Naples; being now in the possession of a Bastardship
of Arragon, but appertaining unto his Majesty, by clear and undoubted
right; which if he should not by just Arms seek to recover, he could
neither acquit his Honour, nor answer it to his People. But his Noble
and Christian thoughts rest not here. For his Resolution and Hope is, to
make the Re-conquest of Naples, but as a Bridge, to transport his Forces
into Grecia; and not to spare Blood or Treasure (if it were to the
impawning of his Crown, and dis-peopling of France) till either he hath
overthrown the Empire of the Ottomans, or taken it in his way to
Paradise. The King knoweth well, that this is a design, that could not
arise in the mind of any King, that did not stedfastly look up unto GOD,
whose quarrel this is, and from whom cometh both the will, and the Deed.
But yet it is agreeable to the Person that he beareth (though unworthy)
of the Thrice-Christian King, and the Eldest Son of the Church.
Whereunto he is also invited by the Example (in more ancient time) of
King Henry the Fourth of England, (the First Renowned King of the House
of Lancaster, Ancestor, though not Progenitor to your King) who had a
purpose towards the end of his time (as you know better) to make an
Expedition into the Holy Land; and by the Example also (present before
his eyes) of that Honourable and Religious War which the King of Spain
now maketh, and hath almost brought to perfection, for the Recovery of
the Realm of Granada from the Moors. And although this Enterprize may
seem vast and unmeasured, for the King to attempt that by his own
Forces, wherein heretofore a Conjunction of most of the Christian
Princes hath found work enough; yet his Majesty wisely considereth, that
sometimes smaller Forces being united under one Command, are more
effectual in Proof (though not so promising in Opinion and Fame) than
much greater Forces, variously propounded by Associations and Leagues;
which commonly in a short time after their beginnings, turn to
Dissociations and Divisions. But (my Lords) that which is as a Voice
from Heaven that called the King to this Enterprize, is a Rent at this
time in the House of the Ottomans. I do not say, but there hath been
Brother against Brother in that House before, but never any that had
refuge to the Arms of the Christians, as now hath Gemes, (Brother unto
Bajazeth, that reigneth) the far braver man of the two; the other being
between a Monk and a Philosopher, and better read in the Alcoran and
Averroes, than able to weild the Scepter of so warlike an Empire. This
therefore is the King our Master’s memorable and heroical Resolution for
an Holy War. And because he carrieth in this the person of a Christian
Soldier, as well as of a great Temporal Monarch; he beginneth with
Humility, and is content for this cause, to beg Peace at the hands of
other Christian Kings. There remaineth only rather a Civil Request, than
any essential part of our Negotiation, which the King maketh to the King
your Sovereign. The King (as the World knoweth) is Lord in chief of the
Duchy of Britain. The Marriage of the Heir belongeth to him as Guardian.
This is a private Patrimonial Right, and no business of Estate: yet
nevertheless (to run a fair course with your King; whom he desires to
make another Himself, and to be one and the same thing with him) his
Request is, That with the King’s Favour and Consent, he may dispose of
her Marriage, as he thinketh good, and make void the intruded and
pretended Marriage of Maximilian, according to Justice. This (my Lords)
is all that I have to say, desiring your pardon for my weakness in the
delivery.</p>
<p>THus did the French Ambassadors with great shew of their King’s
affection, and many sugred words seek to adulce all matters between the
two Kings, having two things for their ends; The one, to keep the King
quiet till the Marriage of Britain was past, and this was but a
Summers-fruit, which they thought was almost ripe, and would be soon
gathered. The other was more lasting; and that was to put him into such
a temper as he might be no disturbance or impediment to the Voyage for
Italy. The Lords of the Council were silent; and said only, That they
knew the Ambassadors would look for no answer, till they had reported to
the King; and so they rose from Council. The King could not well tell
what to think of the Marriage of Britain. He saw plainly the ambition of
the French King was to impatronize himself of the Duchy; but he wondred
he would bring into his House a litigious Marriage, especially
considering who was his Successor. But weighing one thing with another,
he gave Britain for lost; but resolved to make his profit of this
business of Britain, as a quarrel for War; and that of Naples, as a
Wrench and mean for Peace; being well advertised, how strongly the King
was bent upon that Action. Having therefore conferred divers times with
his Council, and keeping himself somewhat close, he gave a direction to
the Chancellor, for a formal Answer to the Ambassadors, and that he did
in the presence of his Council. And after calling the Chancellor to him
apart, bade him speak in such language, as was fit for a Treaty that was
to end in a Breach; and gave him also a special Caveat, that he should
not use any words, to discourage the Voyage of Italy. Soon after the
Ambassadors were sent for to the Council, and the Lord Chancellor spake
to them in this sort:</p>
<p>MY Lords Ambassadors, I shall make answer by the King’s Commandment,
unto the eloquent Declaration of you my Lord Prior, in a brief and plain
manner. The King forgetteth not his former love and acquaintance with
the King your Master. But of this there needeth no repetition. For if it
be between them as it was, it is well; if there be any alteration, it is
not words that will make it up.</p>
<p>For the Business of Britain, the King findeth it a little strange
that the French King maketh mention of it, as matter of well-deserving
at his hand. For that Deserving was no more, but to make him his
Instrument, to surprize one of his best Confederates. And for the
Marriage, the King would not meddle in it if your Master would marry by
the Book, and not by the Sword.</p>
<p>For that of Flanders, if the Subjects of Burgundy had appealed to
your King, as their Chief Lord, at first, by way of Supplication, it
might have had a shew of Justice. But it was a new form of Process, for
Subjects to imprison their Prince first, and to slay his Officers, and
then to be Complainants. The King saith, That sure he is, when the
French King, and himself sent to the Subjects of Scotland (that had
taken Arms against their King) they both spake in another Stile, and did
in Princely manner signifie their detestation of Popular Attentates,
upon the Person or Authority of Princes. But my Lords Ambassadors, the
King leaveth these two actions thus: That on the one side, he hath not
received any manner of satisfaction from you concerning them; and on the
other, that he doth not apprehend them so deeply, as in respect of them,
to refuse to treat of Peace, if other things may go hand in hand. As for
the War of Naples, and the Design against the Turk; the King hath
commanded me expresly to say, That he doth wish with all his heart, to
his good Brother the French King, that his Fortunes may succeed
according to his hopes, and honourable intentions. And whensoever he
shall hear, that he is prepared for Grecia, as your Master is pleased
now to say, that he beggeth a Peace of the King, so the King will then
beg of him a part in that War.</p>
<p>But now my Lords Ambassadors, I am to propound unto you somewhat on
the King’s part. The King your Master hath taught our King what to say
and demand. You say (my Lord Prior) that your King is resolved to
recover his right to Naples, wrongfully detained from him. And that if
he should not thus do, he could not acquit his Honour, nor answer it to
his People. Think (my Lords) that the King our Master saith the same
thing over again to you touching Normandy, Guien, Anjou, yea and the
Kingdom of France it self. I cannot express it better than in your own
words: If therefore the French King shall consent, that the King our
Master’s Title to France (at least Tribute for the same) be handled in
the Treaty, the King is content to go on with the rest, otherwise he
refuseth to Treat.</p>
<p>THE Ambassadors being somewhat abashed with this demand, answered in
some heat; That they doubted not, but the King their Sovereign’s Sword
would be able to maintain his Scepter: And they assured themselves, he
neither could nor would yield to any diminution of the Crown of France,
either in Territory or Regality. But howsoever, they were too great
matters for them to speak of, having no Commission. It was replied, that
the King looked for no other answer from them; but would forthwith send
his own Ambassadors to the French King. There was a question also asked
at the table, Whether the French King would agree to have the disposing
of the Marriage of Britain with an exception and exclusion, that he
should not marry her himself? To which the Ambassadors answered; That it
was so far out of their King’s thoughts, as they had received no
Instruction touching the same. Thus were the Ambassadors dismissed, all
save the Prior; and were followed immediately by Thomas Earl of Ormond,
and Thomas Goldenston Prior of Christ-Church in Canterbury, who were
presently sent over into France. In the mean space, Lionel Bishop of
Concordia, was sent as Nuntio from Pope Alexander the sixth to both
Kings, to move a Peace between them. For Pope Alexander finding himself
pent and lockt up, by a League and Association of the principal States
of Italy, that he could not make his way for the advancement of his own
House, (which he immoderately thirsted after) was desirous to trouble
the waters in Italy, that he might fish the better; casting the Net, not
out of St. Peter’s, but out of Borgia’s Bark. And doubting lest the fear
from England, might stay the French King’s voyage into Italy, dispatched
this Bishop to compose all matters between the two Kings, if he could.
Who first repaired to the French King, and finding him well inclined (as
he conceived) took on his Journey towards England, and found the English
Ambassadors at Calice, on their way towards the French King. After some
conference with them, he was in honourable manner transported over into
England, where he had audience of the King. But notwithstanding he had a
good ominous name to have made a Peace, nothing followed. For in the
mean time, the purpose of the French King to marry the Duchess could be
no longer dissembled. Wherefore the English Ambassadors (finding how
things went) took their leave, and returned. And the Prior also was
warned from hence, to depart out of England. Who when he turned his back
(more like a Pedant, than an Ambassador) dispersed a bitter Libel, in
Latin Verse, against the King; unto which the King (though he had
nothing of a Pedant) yet was content to cause an answer to be made in
like Verse; and that as speaking in his own person, but in a stile of
scorn and sport. About this time also was born the King’s second Son
Henry, who afterward relgned. And soon after followed the solemnization
of the Marriage between Charles, and Ann Duchess of Britain, with whom
he received the Duchy of Britain as her Dowry; the Daughter of
Maximilian being a little before sent home. Which when it came to the
ears of Maximilian, (who would never believe it till it was done, being
ever the Principal in deceiving himself, though in this the French King
did very handsomly second it) and tumbling it over and over in his
thoughts, that he should at one blow (with such a double scorn) be
defeated, both of the Marriage of his Daughter, and his own (upon both
which he had fixed high imaginations;) he lost all patience, and casting
off the Respects fit to be continued between great Kings, (even when
their blood is hottest, and most risen) fell to bitter Invectives
against the person and actions of the French King. And (by how much he
was the less able to do, talking so much the more) spake all the
Injuries he could devise of Charles, saying; That he was the most
Perfidious man upon the earth, and that he had made a Marriage
compounded between an Advoutry and a Rape: which was done (he said) by
the just judgment of God; to the end, that (the Nullity thereof being so
apparent to all the World) the Race of so unworthy a person might not
reign in France. And forthwith he sent Ambassadors as well to the King
of England as to the King of Spain, to incite them to War, and to treat
a League offensive against France, promising to concur with great Forces
of his own. Hereupon the King of England (going nevertheless his own
way) called a Parliament, it being the seventh year of his Reign, and
the first day of opening thereof, (sitting under his Cloth of Estate)
spake himself unto his Lords and Commons, in this manner:</p>
<p>MY Lords, and you the Commons; When I purposed to make a War in
Britain by my Lieutenant, I made declaration thereof to you by my
Chancellor. But now that I mean to make a War upon France in Person, I
will declare it to you my Self. That War, was to defend another man’s
right, but this is to recever our own; and that ended by Accident, but
we hope this shall end in Victory.</p>
<p>The French King troubles the Christian World. That which he hath, is
not his own, and yet he seeketh more. He hath invested himself of
Britain, he maintaineth the Rebels in Flanders, and he threatneth Italy.
For Our Selves, he hath proceeded from Dissimulation to Neglect, and
from Neglect to Contumely. He hath assailed our Confederates; he denieth
our Tribute; in a word, he seeks War. So did not his Father, but sought
Peace at our hands; and so perhaps will be, when good Counsel or Time
shall make him see as much as his Father did.</p>
<p>Mean-while; let us make his Ambition, our Advantage; and let us not
stand upon a few Crowns of Tribute, or Acknowledgement, but (by the
favour of Almighty GOD) try Our Right for the Crown of France it self;
remembring that there hath been a French King Prisoner in England, and a
King of England Crowned in France. Our Confederates are not diminished.
Burgundy is in a mightier Hand than ever, and never more provoked;
Britain cannot help us, but it may hurt them. New Acquests are more
Burthen, than Strength. The Male-contents of his own Kingdom have not
been Base, Popular, nor Titulary Impostors, but of an higher nature. The
King of Spain (doubt ye not) will with us, not knowing where the French
King’s Ambition will stay. Our Holy Father the Pope, likes no
Tramontanes in Italy. But howsoever it be, this matter of Confederates,
is rather to be thought on, than reckoned on. (For God forbid; but
England should be able to get Reason of France, without a Second.</p>
<p>At the Battels of Cressy, Poictiers, Agent-Court, we were of Our
selves. France hath much People, and few Soldiers. They have no stable
Bands of Foot: some good Horse they have; but these are Forces, which
are least fit for a Defensive War, where the Actions are in the
Assailant’s choice. It was our Discords only, that lost France; and (by
the Power of GOD) it is the good Peace which we now enjoy, that will
recover it. GOD hath hitherto blessed my Sword. I have in this time that
I have Reigned, weeded out my bad Subjects, and tryed my good. My People
and I know one another; which breeds Confidence. And if there should be
any bad Blood left in the Kingdom, an Honourable Forein War will vent
it, or purifie it. In this great Business, let me have your Advice, and
Ayd. If any of you were to make his Son Knight; you might have ayd of
your Tenants by Law. This concerns the Knighthood and Spurs of the
Kingdom, whereof I am Father; and bound not only to seek to maintain it,
but to advance it. But for matter of Treasure, let it not be taken from
the Poorest sort; but from those, to whom the Benefit of the War may
redound. France is no Wilderness: and I, that profess good husbandry,
hope to make the War (after the Beginnings) to pay it self. Go together
in GOD’s Name, and lose no time; for I have called this Parliament
wholly for this Cause.</p>
<p>THus spake the King. But for all this, though he shewed great
forwardness for a War, not only to his Parliament and Court, but to his
Privy Council likewise, (except the two Bishops, and a few more) yet
nevertheless in his secret intentions, he had no purpose to go through
with any War, upon France. But the truth was, that he did but traffick
with that War, to make his Return in money. He knew well, that France
was now entire, and at unity with it self, and never so mighty many
years before. He saw by the tast that he had of his Forces sent into
Britain, that the French knew well enough how to make War with the
English; by not putting things to the hazard of a Battel, but wearing
them by long Sieges of Towns, and strong fortified Encampings. James the
Third of Scotland, (his true Friend, and Confederate) gone; and James
the Fourth (that had succeeded) wholly at the devotion of France, and
ill affected towards him. As for the Conjunctions of Ferdinando of
Spain, and Maximilian; he could make no foundation upon them: for the
one had Power, and not Will; and the other had Will, and not Power.
Besides that, Ferdinando had but newly taken breath, from the War with
the Moors; and merchanded at this time with France, for the restoring of
the Counties of Russignon and Perpignian, oppignorated to the French.
Neither was he out of fear of the Discontents, and ill blood within the
Realm; which having used always to repress and appease in person, he was
loth they should find him at a distance beyond Sea, and engaged in War.
Finding therefore the Inconveniences and Difficulties in the prosecution
of a War, he cast with himself how to compass two things: The one, how
by the declaration, and inchoation of a War, to make his Profit; the
other, how to come off from the War, with saving of his Honour. For
Profit, it was to be made two ways; upon his Subjects for the War, and
upon his Enemies for the Peace; like a good Merchant, that maketh his
gain, both upon the Commodities Exported, and Imported back again. For
the point of Honour, wherein he might suffer, for giving over the War;
he considered well, that as he could not trust upon the ayds of
Ferdinando and Maximilian for supports of War: so the impuissance of the
one, and the double proceeding of the other, lay fair for him for
occasions to accept of Peace. These things he did wisely fore-see, and
did as artificially conduct, whereby all things fell into his lap, as he
desired.</p>
<p>For as for the Parliament, it presently took fire, being affectionate
(of old) to the War of France; and desirous afresh to repair the
dishonour, they thought the King sustained by the loss of Britain.
Therefore they advised the King (with great alacrity) to undertake the
War of France. And although the Parliament consisted of the first and
second Nobility, (together with principal Citizens and Townsmen) yet
worthily and justly respecting more the People (whose Deputies they
were) than their own private Persons, and finding by the Lord
Chancellor’s Speech the King’s inclination that way; they consented that
Commissioners should go forth, for the gathering and levying of a
Benevolence, from the more able sort. This Tax (called Benevolence) was
devised by Edward the Fourth, for which he sustained much Envy. It was
abolished by Richard the Third, by Act of Parliament, to ingratiate
himself with the people; and it was now revived by the King, but with
consent of Parliament, for so it was not in the time of King Edward the
Fourth. But by this way he raised exceeding great summs. Insomuch as the
City of London (in those days) contributed nine thousand pounds and
better, and that chiefly levied upon the wealthier sort. There is a
Tradition of a Dilemma, that Bishop Morton the Chancellor used, to raise
up the Benevolence to higher Rates; and some called it his Fork, and
some his Crotch. For he had couched an Article in the Instructions to
the Commissioners, who were to levy the Benevolence; That if they met
with any that were sparing, they should tell them, That they must needs
have, because they laid up; and if they were spenders, they must needs
have, because it was seen in their port, and manner of living. So
neither kind came amiss.</p>
<p>This Parliament was meerly a Parliament of War; for it was in
substance, but a Declaration of War against France and Scotland, with
some Statutes conducing thereunto; As the severe punishing of Mortpayes,
and keeping back of Soldiers Wages in Captains. The like severity for
the departure of Soldiers without licence; Strengthning of the Common
Law in favour of Protections, for those that were in the King’s service;
And the setting the gate open and wide, for men to Sell or Mortgage
their Lands without Fines for Alienation, to furnish themselves with
Money for the War; And lastly, the avoiding of all Scottish-men out of
England. There was also a Statute, for the dispersing of the Standard of
the Exchequer, throughout England; thereby to size Weights and Measures;
and two or three more of less importance.</p>
<p>After the Parliament was broken up (which lasted not long) the King
went on with his Preparations for the War of France; yet neglected not
in the mean time the affairs of Maximilian, for the quieting of
Flanders, and restoring him to his Authority amongst his Subjects. For
at that time, the Lord of Ravenstein being not only a Subject rebelled,
but a Servant revolted, (and so much the more malicious and violent, by
the ayd of Bruges and Ghent) had taken the Town, and both the Castles of
Sluyce; as we said before.</p>
<p>And having (by the commodity of the Haven) gotten together certain
Ships and Barques, fell to a kind of Pyratical trade; robbing and
spoyling, and taking Prisoners the Ships and Vessels of all Nations,
that passed alongst that Coast, towards the Mart of Antwerp, or into any
part of Brabant, Zealand, or Friesland; being ever will victualled from
Picardy, besides the commodity of Victuals from Sluyce, and the Countrey
adjacent, and the avails of his own Prizes. The French assisted him
still under-hand; and he likewise (as all men do, that have been of both
sides) thought himself not safe, except he depended upon a third
Person.</p>
<p>There was a small Town some two miles from Bruges, towards the Sea,
called Dam; which was a Fort and Approch to Bruges, and had a relation
also to Sluyce. This Town the King of the Romans had attempted often,
(not for any worth of the Town in it self, but because it might choak
Bruges, and cut it off from the Sea) and ever failed. But therewith the
Duke of Saxony came down into Flanders, taking upon him the person of an
Umpire, to compose things between Maximilian and his Subjects; but being
(indeed) fast and assured to Maximilian. Upon this Pretext of Neutrality
and Treaty, he repaired to Bruges; desiring the States of Bruges, to
enter peaceably into their Town, with a Retinue of some number of men of
Arms, fit for his Estate, being somewhat the more (as he said) the
better to guard him in a Countrey, that was up in Arms: and bearing them
in hand, that he was to communicate with them of divers matters of great
importance, for their good. Which having obtained of them, he sent his
Carriages and Harbingers before him, to provide his Lodging. So that his
Men of War entred the City in good Array, but in peaceable manner, and
he followed. They that went before, enquired still for Inns and
Lodgings, as if they would have rested there all night, and so went on,
till they came to the Gate, that leadeth directly towards Dam; and they
of Bruges only gazed upon them, and gave them passage. The Captains and
inhabitants of Dam also suspected no harm, from any that passed through
Bruges; and discovering Forces a-far-off, supposed they had been some
Succours, that were come from their Friends, knowing some Dangers
towards them. And so perceiving nothing but well, till it was too late,
suffered them to enter their Town. By which kind of Sleight, rather than
Stratagem, the Town of Dam was taken, and the Town of Bruges shrewdly
blockt up, whereby they took great discouragement.</p>
<p>The Duke of Saxony having won the Town of Dam, sent immediately to
the King, to let him know that it was Sluyce chiefly, and the Lord
Ravenstein, that kept the Rebellion of Flanders in life; And that if it
pleased the King to besiege it by Sea, he also would besiege it by Land,
and so cut out the Core of those Wars.</p>
<p>The King willing to uphold the Authority of Maximilian, (the better
to hold France in awe) and being likewise sued unto by his Merchants,
for that the Seas were much infested by the Barques of the Lord
Ravenstein; sent straightways Sir Edward Poynings, a valiant man, and of
good service, with twelve Ships, well furnished with Soldiers and
Artillery, to clear the Seas, and to besiege Sluyce on that part. The
Englishmen did not only coop up the Lord Ravenstein, that he stirred
not, and likewise hold in strait Siege the Maritim part of the Town; but
also assailed one of the Castles, and renewed the assault so for twenty
days space (issuing still out of their Ships at the Ebb) as they made
great slaughter of them of the Castle; who continually fought with them
to repulse them, though of the English part also were slain a Brother of
the Earl of Oxford’s, and some fifty more.</p>
<p>But the Siege still continuing more and more strait, and both the
Castles (which were the principal strength of the Town) being
distressed, the one by the Duke of Saxony, and the other by the English;
and a Bridge of boats, which the Lord Ravenstein had made between both
Castles, whereby Succours and Relief might pass from the one to the
other, being on a night set on fire by the English, he despairing to
hold the Town, yielded (at the last) the Castle to the English, and the
Town to the Duke of Saxony, by composition. Which done, the Duke of
Saxony and Sir Edward Poynings treated with them of Bruges, to submit
themselves to Maximilian their Lord; which after some time they did,
paying (in some good part) the Charge of the War, whereby the Almains
and foreln Succours were dismissed. The example of Bruges, other of the
Revolted Towns followed, so that Maximilian grew to be out of danger,
but (as his manner was to handle matters) never out of necessity. And
Sir Edward Poynings (after he had continued at Sluyce some good while,
till all things were setled) returned unto the King, being then before
Bulloign.</p>
<p>Somewhat about this time came Letters from Ferdinando, and Isabella,
King and Queen of Spain; signifying the final Conquest of Granada from
the Moors; which action in it self so worthy, King Ferdinando, (whose
manner was never to lose any virtue for the shewing) had expressed and
displayed in his Letters at large, with all the particularities, and
Religious Puncto’s and Ceremonies, that were observed in the reception
of that City and Kingdom: Shewing amongst other things, That the King
would not by any means in person enter the City, until he had first
aloof seen the Cross set up upon the greater Tower of Granada, whereby
it became Christian ground: That likewise before he would enter, he did
Homage to God above, pronouncing by an Herald from the height of that
Tower, that he did acknowledge to have recovered that Kingdom, by the
help of God Almighty and the glorious Virgin, and the virtuous Apostle
St. James, and the holy Father Innocent the Eighth, together with the
ayds and services of his Prelates, Nobles and Commons: That yet he
stirred not from his Camp, till he had seen a little Army of Martyrs, to
the number of seven hundred and more Christians (that had lived in bonds
and servitude, as Slaves to the Moors) pass before his Eyes, singing a
Psalm for their redemption, and that he had given Tribute unto God by
alms, and relief, extended to them all, for his admission into the City.
These things were in the Letters, with many more Ceremonies of a kind of
Holy Ostentation.</p>
<p>The King ever willing to put himself into the consort or Choir of all
Religious actions, and naturally affecting much the King of Spain, (as
far as one King can affect another) partly for his virtues, and partly
for a counterpoise to France; upon the receipt of these Letters, sent
all his Nobles and Prelates, that were about the Court, together with
the Mayor and Aldermen of London, in great solemnity to the Church of
St. Pauls; there to hear a Declaration from the Lord Chancellor, now
Cardinal. When they were assembled, the Cardinal (standing upon the
uppermost step, or half-pace before the Chair; and all the Nobles,
Prelates, and Governours of the City at the foot of the stairs) made a
Speech to them; letting them know, that they were assembled in that
Consecrate place, to sing unto God a New-song; For that (said he) these
many years the Christians have not gained new ground or Territory upon
the Infidels, nor enlarged and set further the Bounds of the
Christianworld: But this is now done, by the prowess and devotion of
Ferdinando and Isabella, Kings of Spain; who have (to their immortal
Honour) recovered the great and rich Kingdom of Granade, and the
populous and mighty City of the same name, from the Moors, having been
in possession thereof by the space of seven hundred years and more. For
which, this Assembly and all Christians are to render laud and thanks
unto God, and to celebrate this noble Act of the King of Spain; who in
this is not only Victorious, but Apostolical, in the gaining of new
Provinces to the Christian Faith. And the rather, for that this victory
and Conquest is obtained, without much effusion of blood. Whereby it is
to be hoped, that there shall be gained, not only new Territory, but
infinite Souls, to the Church of Christ; whom the Almighty (as it seems)
would have live to be converted. Herewithal he did relate some of the
most memorable particulars of the War and Victory. And after his Speech
ended, the whole assembly went solemnly in Procession, and Te Deum was

<p>Immediately after the Solemnity, the King kept his May-day at his
Palace of Shein, now Richmond. Where to warm the blood of his Nobility,
and Gallants, against the War, he kept great Triumphs of Justing and
Tourney, during all that Month. In which space it so fell out, that Sir
James Parker, and Hugh Vaughan, (one of the King’s Gentlemen-Ushers)
having had a controversie touching certain Arms, that the King at Arms
had given Vaughan, were appointed to run some Courses one against
another. And by accident of a faulty Helmet, that Parker had on, he was
stricken into the mouth at the first Course, so that his tongue was born
unto the hinder part of his head, in such sort that he died presently
upon the place. Which because of the Controversie precedent, and the
Death that followed, was accounted among the Vulgar, as a Combat or
Tryal of Right. The King, towards the end of this Summer, having put his
Forces, wherewith he meant to invade France, in readiness, (but so as
they were not yet met or mustered together) sent Urswick (now made his
Almoner) and Sir John Risley, to Maximilian; to let him know, that he
was in Arms, ready to pass the Seas into France, and did but expect to
hear from him, when and where he did appoint to joyn with him, according
to his promise made unto him by Countebal, his Ambassador.</p>
<p>The English Ambassadors, having repaired to Maximilian, did find his
power and promise at a very great distance; he being utterly unprovided
of Men, Money, and Arms, for any such enterprize. For Maximilian, having
neither Wing to flie on (for that his Patrimony of Austria was not in
his hands, his Father being then living: And on the other side, his
Matrimonial Territories of Flanders being partly in Dowre to his
Mother-in-law, and partly not serviceable, in respect of the late
Rebellions) was thereby destitute of means to enter into War. The
Ambassadors saw this well, but wisely thought fit to advertise the King
thereof, rather than to return themselves, till the King’s further
pleasure were known: The rather, for that Maximilian himself spake as
great, as ever he did before, and entertained them with dilatory
Answers; so as the formal part of their Ambassage might well warrant and
require their further stay. The King hereupon (who doubted as much
before, and saw through his business from the beginning) wrote back to
the Ambassadors, commending their discretion in not returning, and
willing them to keep the state wherein they found Maximilian, as a
Secret, till they heard further from him; And mean while went on with
his Voyage Royal for France, suppressing for a time this Advertisement
touching Maximilian’s poverty and disability.</p>
<p>By this time, was drawn together a great and puissant Army into the
City of London; in which were Thomas Marquess Dorset, Thomas Earl of
Arundel, Thomas Earl of Derby, George Earl of Shrewsbury, Edmond Earl of
Suffolk, Edward Earl of Devonshire, George Earl of Kent, the Earl of
Essex, Thomas Earl of Ormond, with a great number of Barons, Knights,
and principal Gentlemen; and amongst them, Richard Thomas, much noted
for the brave Troops that he brought out of Wales; the Army rising in
the whole to the number of five and twenty thousand Foot, and sixteen
hundred Horse. Over which, the King (constant in his accustomed trust
and employment) made Jasper Duke of Bedford, and John Earl of Oxford
Generals under his own person. The ninth of September, in the eighth
year of his Reign, he departed from Greenwich; towards the Sea, all men
wondering, that he took that season (being so near Winter) to begin the
War; and some thereupon gathering it was a sign that the War would not
be long. Nevertheless, the King gave out the contrary, thus: That he
intending not to make a Summer-business of it, but a resolute War
(without term prefixed) until he recovered France; it skilled not much
when he began it: especially having Calice at his back; where he might
winter, if the reason of the War so required. The sixth of October, he
embarqued at Sandwich; and the same day took land at Calice: which was
the Rendezvonz, where all his Forces were assigned to meet. But in this
his Journey towards the Sea-side (wherein, for the cause that we shall
now speak of, he hovered so much the longer) he had received Letters
from the Lord Cordes: who the hotter he was against the English in time
of War, had the more credit in a Negotiation of Peace; and besides was
held a man open, and of good faith. In which Letters there was made an
overture of Peace from the French King, with such Conditions, as were
somewhat to the King’s tast: but this was carried at the first with
wonderful secrecy. The King was no sooner come to Calice, but the calm
winds of Peace began to blow. For first, the English Ambassadors
returned out of Flanders from Maximilian; and certified the King, that
he was not to hope for any ayd from Maximilian, for that he was
altogether improvided. His will was good; but he lacked money. And this
was made known; and spread through the Army. And although the English
were therewithal nothing dismayed; and that it be the manner of
Soldiers, upon bad news to speak the more bravely: yet nevertheless it
was a kind of preparative to a Peace. Instantly in the neck of this (as
the King had laid it) came news that Ferdinando and Isabella, Kings of
Spain, had concluded a peace with King Charles; and that Charles had
restored unto them the Counties of Russignon and Perpignian, which
formerly were Mortgaged by John King of Arragon (Ferdinando’s Father)
unto France, for three hundred thousand Crowns; which debt was also,
upon this Peace, by Charles clearly released. This came also handsomly
to put on the Peace: both because so potent a Confederate was faln off,
and because it was a fair example of a Peace bought; so as the King
should not be the sole Merchant in this Peace. Upon these Airs of Peace,
the King was content, that the Bishop of Exceter, and the Lord Daubigny
(Governour of Calice) should give a meeting unto the Lord Cordes, for
the Treaty of a Peace. But himself nevertheless, and his Army, the
fifteenth of October, removed from Calice, and in four days march sate
him down before Bulloign.</p>
<p>During this Siege of Bulloign (which continued near a Month) there
passed no memorable Action, nor Accident of War: only Sir John Savage, a
valiant Captain, was slain, riding about the Walls of the Town, to take
a View. The Town was both well fortified, and well manned; yet it was
distressed, and ready for an Assault: which if it had been given (as was
thought) would have cost much blood; but yet the Town would have been
carried in the end. Mean while, a Peace was concluded by the
Commissioners, to continue for both the Kings Lives. Where there was no
Article of importance; being in effect, rather a Bargain, than a Treaty.
For, all things remained as they were: save that there should be paid to
the King seven hundred forty five thousand Ducats in present, for his
Charges in that Journey; and five and twenty thousand Crowns yearly, for
his Charges sustained in the Ayds of the Britons. For which Annual,
though he had Maximilian bound before for those Charges; yet he counted
the alteration of the Hand, as much as the principal Debt. And besides,
it was left somewhat indefinitely; when it should determine or expire;
which made the English esteem it as a Tribute, carried under fair Terms.
And the truth is, it was paid both to the King, and to his Son King
Henry the Eighth, longer than it could continue upon any computation of
Charges. There were also assigned by the French King, unto all the
King’s principal Counsellors, great Pensions, besides rich Gifts for the
present. Which whether the King did permit, to save his own Purse from
Rewards, or to communicate the Envy of a Business, that was displeasing
to his People, was diversly interpreted; for certainly, the King had no
great fancy to own this Peace. And therefore, a little before it was
concluded, he had under-hand procured some of his best Captains, and Men
of War, to advise him to a Peace under their hands, in an earnest
manner, in the nature of a Supplication. But, the truth is, this Peace
was welcom to both Kings. To Charles, for that it assured unto him the
possession of Britain, and freed the enterprise of Naples. To Henry, for
that it filled his Coffers; and that he foresaw at that time a storm of
inward troubles coming upon him; which presently after brake forth. But
it gave no less discontent to the Nobility, and principal persons of the
Army; who had many of them sold or engaged their Estates, upon the hopes
of the War. They stuck not to say, That the King cared not to plume his
Nobility and People, to feather himself. And some made themselves merry
with that the King had said in Parliament: That after the War was once
begun, he doubted not but to make it pay it self; saying he had kept
promise.</p>
<p>Having risen from Bulloign, he went to Calice, where he stayed some
time. From whence also he wrote Letters, (which was a Courtesie that he
sometimes used) to the Mayor of London, and Aldermen his Brethren; half
bragging, what great summs he had obtained for the Peace; knowing well,
that full Coffers of the King, is ever good news to London. And better
news it would have been, if their Benevolence had been but a Loan. And
upon the seventeenth of December following, he returned to Westminster,
where he kept his Christmas.</p>
<p>Soon after the King’s return, he sent the Order of the Garter, to
Alphonso Duke of Calabria, eldest Son to Ferdinando King of Naples; an
honour sought by that Prince, to hold him up in the eyes of the
Italians: who, expecting the Arms of Charles, made great account of the
Amity of England, for a Bridle to France. It was received by Alphonso,
with all Ceremony and Pomp that could be devised; as things use to be
carried that are intended for Opinion. It was sent by Urswick: upon whom
the King bestowed this Ambassage, to help him, after many dry
Employments.</p>
<p>AT this time the King began again to be haunted with Spirits, by the
Magick and curious Arts of the Lady Margaret: who raised up the Ghost of
Richard Duke of York, second Son to King Edward the Fourth, to walk and
vex the King. This was a finer Counterfeit Stone, than Lambert Simnel,
better done, and worn upon greater hands; being graced after, with the
wearing of a King of France, and a King of Scotland, not of a Duchess of
Burgundy only. And for Simnel, there was not much in him, more than that
he was a handsom Boy, and did not shame his Robes. But this Youth (of
whom we are now to speak) was such a Mercurial, as the like hath seldom
been known, and could make his own Part, if at any time he chanced to be
out. Wherefore, this being one of the strangest Examples of a
Personation, that ever was in Elder or Latter times; it deserveth to be
discovered, and related at the full: Although the King’s manner of
shewing things, by Pieces and by Dark Lights, hath so musfled it, that
it hath left it almost as a Mystery to this day.</p>
<p>The Lady Margaret (whom the King’s Friends called Juno, because she
was to him as Junb was to Aeneas, stirring both Heaven and Hell, to do
him mischief) for a foundation of her particular Practices against him,
did continually, by all means possible, nourish, maintain, and divulge
the flying Opinion, That Richard Duke of York (second Son to Edward the
Fourth) was not murthered in the Tower, (as was given out) but saved
alive; For that those, who were employed in that barbarous Fact, having
destroyed the elder Brother, were stricken with remorse and compassion
towards the younger, and set him privily at liberty, to seek his
Fortune. This Lure she cast abroad, thinking that this Fame and Belief
(together with the fresh Example of Lambert Simnel) would draw at one
time, or other, some Birds to strike upon it. She used likewise a
further diligence, not committing all to Chance. For, she had some
secret Espials (like to the Turks Commissioners for Children of Tribute)
to look abroad for handsom and graceful Youths to make Plantagenets, and
Dukes of York. At the last she did light on one, in whom all things met,
as one would wish to serve her turn, for a Counterfeit of Richard Duke
of York.</p>
<p>This was Perkin Warbeck, whose Adventures we shall now describe. For,
first, the years agreed well. Secondly, he was a Youth of fine favour
and shape. But more than that, he had such a crafty and bewitching
fashion, both to move Pity, and to induce Belief, as was like a kind of
Fascination, and Inchantment to those that saw him, or heard him.
Thirdly, he had been from his Childhood such a Wanderer, or (as the King
called him) such a Land-loper, as it was extreme hard to hunt out his
Nest and Parents. Neither again could any man, by company or conversing
with him, be able to say or detect well what he was; he did so flit from
place to place. Lastly, there was a Circumstance (which is mentioned by
one that wrote in the same time) that is very likely to have made
somewhat to the matter; which is, That King Edward the Fourth was his
God-father. Which, as it is somewhat suspicious, for a wanton Prince to
become Gossip in so mean a House; and might make a man think, that he
might indeed have in him some base Blood of the House of York: so at the
least (though that were not) it might give the occasion to the Boy, in
being called King Edward’s God-son, or perhaps in sport, King Edward’s
Son, to entertain such Thoughts into his Head. For, Tutor he had none,
(for ought that appears) as Lambert Simnel had, until he came unto the
Lady Margaret, who instructed him.</p>
<p>Thus therefore it came to pass: There was a Towns-man of Tourney,
that had born Office in that Town, whose name was John Osbeck, a
Convert-Jew, married to Catherine de Faro; whose business drew him, to
live for a time with his Wife at London, in King Edward the Fourth’s
days. During which time he had a Son by her: and being known in Court,
the King either out of a religious Nobleness, because he was a Convert,
or upon some private acquaintance, did him the Honor, as to be
God-father to his Child, and named him Peter. But, afterwards, proving a
dainty and effeminate Youth, he was commonly called by the diminutive of
his name; Peterkin, or Perkin. For, as for the name of Warbeck, it was
given him when they did but guess at it, before examinations had been
taken. But yet he had been so much talked on by that name, as it stuck
by him after his true name of Osbeck was known. While he was a young
Child his Parents returned with him to Tourney. Then was he placed in a
house of a kinsman of his, called John Stenbeck, at Antwerp: and so
roved up and down between Antwerp and Tourney, and other Towns of
Flanders, for a good time; living much in English Company, and having
the English Tongue perfect. In which time, being grown a comely Youth,
he was brought by some of the Espials of the Lady Margaret unto her
Presence. Who viewing him well, and seeing that he had a Face and
Personage that would bear a Noble fortune, and finding him otherwise of
a fine Spirit, and winning Behaviour; thought she had now found a
curious Piece of Marble, to carve out an Image of a Duke of York. She
kept him by her a great while, but with extreme secrecy. The while, she
instructed him, by many Cabinet-Conferences. First, in Princely
behaviour and gesture; teaching him how he should keep State, and yet
with a modest sense of his misfortunes. Then she informed him of all the
circumstances and particulars, that concerned the Person of Richard Duke
of York, which he was to act: Describing unto him the Personages,
Lineaments, and Features of the King and Queen, his pretended Parents;
and of his Brother and Sisters, and divers others, that were nearest him
in his Childhood; together with all passages, some secret, some common,
that were fit for a Child’s memory, until the death of King Edward. Then
she added the particulars of the time, from the King’s death, until he
and his Brother were committed to the Tower, as well during the time he
was abroad, as while he was in Sanctuary. As for the times while he was
in the Tower, and the manner of his Brother’s death; and his own escape;
she knew they were things that a very few could controle. And therefore
she taught him, only to tell a smooth and likely Tale of those matters;
warning him not to vary from it. It was agreed likewise between them,
what account he should give of his Peregrination abroad; intermixing
many things which were true, and such as they knew others could
testifie, for the credit of the rest: but, still making them to hang
together, with the Part he was to play. She taught him likewise how to
avoid sundry captious and tempting questions which were like to be asked
of him. But, in this she found him of himself so nimble and shifting, as
she trusted much to his own wit and readiness; and therefore laboured
the less in it. Lastly, she raised his thoughts with some present
rewards, and further promises; setting before him chiefly the glory, and
fortune of a Crown, if things went well; and a sure refuge to her Court,
if the worst should fall. After such time as she thought he was perfect
in his Lesson, she began to cast with her self from what coast this
Blazing star should first appear, and at what time it must be upon the
Horizon of Ireland; for there had the like Meteor strong influence
before: the time of the Apparition to be, when the King should be
engaged into a War with France. But well she knew, that whatsoever
should come from her, would be held suspected. And therefore; if he
should go out of Flanders immediately into Ireland, she might be thought
to have some hand in it. And besides, the time was not yet ripe; for
that the two Kings were upon terms of Peace. Therefore she wheel’d
about; and to put all suspition a far off, and loth to keep him any
longer by her, (for that she knew Secrets are not long-lived) she sent
him unknown into Portugal, with the Lady , an English Lady, for Portugal
at that time; with some Privado of her own, to have an eye upon him: and
there he was to remain and to expect her further directions. In the mean
time, she omitted not to prepare things for his better welcome, and
accepting, not only in the Kingdom of Ireland, but in the Court of
France. He continued in Portugal about a year; and, by that time, the
King of England called his Parliament (as hath been said) and declared
open War against France. Now did the Sign , and the was come, under
Perkin should appear. And therefore he was straight sent unto by the
Duchess, to go for Ireland, according to the first designment. In
Ireland he did arrive at the Town of Cork. When he was thither come, his
own Tale was, (when he made his Confession afterwards) That the
Irish-men, finding him in some good clothes, came flocking about him,
and bare him down, that he was the Duke of Clarence, that had been there
before; and after, that he was Richard the Third’s base Son; and lastly,
that he was Richard Duke of York, second Son to Edward the Fourth: But
that he (for his part) renounced all these things, and offered to swear
upon the Holy Evangelists, that he was no such man; till, at last, they
forced it upon him, and bad him fear nothing, and so forth. But the
truth is, that immediately upon his coming into Ireland, he took upon
him the said Person of the Duke of York., and drew unto him Complices,
and Partakers, by all the means he could devise: Insomuch, as he wrote
his Letters unto the Earl of Densmond and Kildare, to come in to his
Ayd, and be of his Party: the Originals of which Letters are yet
extant.</p>
<p>Somewhat before this time, the Duchess had also gained unto her a
near Servant of King Henry’s own, one Stephen Frion, his Secretary for
the French Tongue; an active man, but turbulent, and discontented. This
Frion had fled over to Charles the French King, and put himself into his
service, at such time as he began to be in open enmity with the King.
Now King Charles, when he understood of the Person and Attempts of
Perkin (ready of himself to embrace all advantages against the King of
England; instigated by Frion, and formerly prepared by the Lady
Margaret,) forthwith dispatched one Lucas, and this Frion, in the nature
of of Ambassadors to Perkin, to advertise him of the King’s good
inclination to him, and that he was resolved to ayd him, to recover his
right against King Henry, an Usurper of England, and an Enemy of France;
and wished him, to come over unto him at Paris. Perkin thought himself
in heaven now, that he was invited by so great a King, in so honourable
a manner; And imparting unto his Friends in Ireland for their
encouragement; how Fortune called him, and what great hopes he had,
sailed presently into France. When he was come to the Court of France,
the King received him with great honour; saluted, and stiled him by the
name of the Duke of York; lodged him, and accommodated him in great
State: And the better to give him the representation and the countenance
of a Prince, assigned him a Guard for his Person, whereof the Lord
Congreshall was Captain. The Courtiers likewise (though it be ill
mocking with the French) applied themselves to their King’s bent, seeing
there was reason of State for it. At the same time there repaired unto
Perkin divers English-men of Quality; Sir George Nevile, Sir John
Taylor, and about one hundred more: and amongst the rest, this Stephen
Frion, of whom we spake; who followed his fortune both then and for a
long time after, and was indeed his principal Counsellor and Instrument
in all his Proceedings. But all this, on the French King’s part, was but
a Trick, the better to bow King Henry to Peace. And therefore upon the
first Grain of Incense, that was sacrificed upon the Altar of Peace, at
Bulloign, Perkin was smoaked away. Yet would not the French King deliver
him up to King Henry (as he was laboured to do) for his Honors sake, but
warned him away, and dismissed him. And Perkin on his part, was as ready
to be gone, doubting he might be caught up under-hand. He therefore took
his way into Flanders, unto the Duchess of Burgundy; pretending, that
having been variously tossed by Fortune, he directed his course thither,
as to a safe Harbour: No ways taking knowledge, that he had ever been
there before, but as if that had been his first address. The Duchess; on
the other part, made it as new and strange to see him: pretending (at
the first) that she was taught and made wise by the example of Lambert
Simnel, how she did admit of any Counterfeit stuff; though even in that
(she said) she was not fully satisfied. She pretended at the first (and
that was ever in the presence of others) to pose him and sift him,
thereby to try whether he were indeed the very Duke of York, or no. But,
seeming to receive full satisfaction by his answers, she then feined her
self to be transported with a kind of astonishment, mixt of Joy and
Wonder, at his miraculous deliverance; receiving him, as he were risen
from death to life; and inferring, that God, who had in such wonderful
manner preserved him from Death, did likewise reserve him for some great
and prosperous Fortune. As for his dismission out of France, they
interpreted it not, as if he were detected or neglected for a
Counterfeit Deceiver; but contrariwise, that it did shew manifestly unto
the World, that he was some Great matter; for that it was his
abandoning, that (in effect) made the Peare: being no more but the
sacrificing of a poor distressed Prince unto the utility and Ambition of
two Mighty Monarchs. Neither was Perkin for his part wanting to himself,
either in gracious and Princely behaviour, or in ready and apposite
answers, or in contenting and caressing those that did apply themselves
unto him or in pretty scorn and disdain to those that seemed to doubt of
him; but in all things did notably acquit himself: Insomuch as it was
generally believed (as well amongst great Persons, as amongst the
Vulgar) that he was indeed Duke Richard. Nay, himself, with long and
continual counterfeiting, and with oft telling a Lye, was turned by
habit almost into the thing he seemed to be, and from a Lyar, to a
Believer. The Duchess therefore (as in a case out of doubt) did him all
Princely honour, calling him always by the name of her Nephew, and
giving him the Delicare Title of the White-Rose of England; and
appointed him a Guard of thirty persons, Halberdiers, clad in a
party-coloured Livery of Murrey and Blew, to attend his Person. Her
Court likewise, and generally the Dutch and Strangers in their usage
towards him, expressed no less respect.</p>
<p>The News hereof came blazing and thundering over into England; that
the Duke of York was sure alive. As for the name of Perkin Warbeck, it
was not at that time come to light, but all the news ran upon the Duke
of York; that he had been entertained in Ireland, bought and sold in
France, and was now plainly avowed, and in great honour in Flanders.
These Fames took hold of divers; in some upon discontent, in some upon
ambition, in some upon levity and desire of change, and in some few upon
conscience and belief, but in most upon simplicity; and in divers out of
dependance upon some of the better sort, who did in secret favour and
nourish these bruits. And it was not long, ere these rumors of Novelty,
had begotten others of Scandal and Murmur against the King, and his
government; taxing him for a great Taxer of his People, and
discountenancer of his Nobility. The loss of Britain, and the Peace with
France were not forgotten. But chiefly they fell upon the wrong that he
did his Queen, in that he did not reign in her Right. Wherefore they
said, that God had now brought to light a Masculine-Branch of the House
of York, that would not be at his Courtesie, howsoever he did depress
his poor Lady. And yet (as it fareth in things which are currant with
the Multitude, and which they affect) these Fames grew so general, as
the Authors were lost in the generality of Speakers. They being like
running Weeds, that have no certain root; or like Footings up and down,
impossible to be traced. But after a while, these ill Hamors drew to an
head, and setled secretly in some eminent Persons; which were Sir
William Stanley Lord Chamberlain of the King’s Houshold, the Lord
Fitz-water, Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir Thomas Thwaites. These entred into
a secret Conspiracy to favour Duke Richard’s Title. Nevertheless none
engaged their fortunes in this business openly, but two; Sir Robert
Clifford, and Master William Barley, who sailed over into Flanders, sent
indeed from the Party of the Conspirators here, to understand the truth
of those things that passed there, and not without some help of monies
from hence; Provisionally to be delivered, if they found and were
satisfied, that there was truth in these pretences. The person of Sir
Robert Clifford (being a Gentleman of Fame and Family) was extremely
welcome to the Lady Margaret. Who after she had confeernce with him,
brought him to the sight of Perkin, with whom he had often speech and
discourse. So that in the end won either by the Duchess, to affect, or
by Perkin to believe, he wrote back into England, that he knew the
Person of Richard Duke of York, as well as he knew his own; and that
this Young-man was undoubtedly he. By this means all things grew
prepared to Revolt and Section here, and the Conspiracy came to have a
Correspondence between Planders and England.</p>
<p>The King on his part was not asleep; but to Arm or levy Forces yet,
he thought would but shew fear, and do this Idol too much worship.
Nevertheless the Ports he did shut up, or at least kept a Watch on them,
that none should pass to or fro that was suspected. But for the rest, he
chose to work by Counter-mine. His purposes were two; the one, to lay
open the Abuse: the other, to break the knot of the Conspirators. To
detect the Abuse, there were but two ways; the first, to make it
manifest to the world, that the Duke of York was indeed murthered: the
other, to prove, that were he dead or alive, yet Perkin was a
Counterfeit. For the first, thus it stood. There were but four persons
that could speak upon knowledge, to the murther of the Duke of York; Sir
James Tirrel, (the employed-man from King Richard) John Dighton, and
Miles Forrest, his Servants, (the two Butchers or Tormentors) and the
Priest of the Tower, that buried them. Of which four, Miles Forrest, and
the Priest were dead, and there remained alive only Sir James Tirrel,
and John Dighton. These two the King caused to be committed to the
Tower, and examined touching the manner of the Death of the two Innocent
Princes. They agreed both in a Tale, (as the King gave out) to this
effect: That King Richard having directed his Warrant for the putting of
them to death, to Brackenbury the Lieutenant of the Tower, was by him
refused. Whereupon the King directed his Warrant to Sir James Tirrel, to
receive the Keys of the Tower from the Lieutenant (for the space of a
night) for the King’s special service. That Sir James Tirrel accordingly
repaired to the Tower by night, attended by his two Servants
afore-named, whom he had chosen for that purpose. That himself stood at
the stair-foot, and sent these two Villains to execute the murther. That
they smothered them in their bed; and that done, called up their Master
to see their naked dead bodies, which they had laid forth. That they
were buried under the Stairs, and some stones cast upon them. That when
the report was made to King Richard, that his will was done, he gave Sir
James Tirrel great thanks, but took exception to the place of their
burial, being too base for them that were King’s children. Where upon
another night by the King’s Warrant renewed, their bodies were removed
by the Priest of the Tower, and buried by him in some place, which (by
means of the Priest’s death soon after) could not be known. Thus much
was then delivered abroad, to be the effect of those Examinations. But
the King nevertheless made no use of them in any of his Declarations;
whereby (as it seems) those Examinations left the business somewhat
perplexed. And as for Sir James Tirrel, he was soon after beheaded in
the Tower-yard, for other matters of Treason. But John-Dighton (who it
seemeth spake best for the King) was forthwith set at liberty, and was
the principal means of divulging this Tradition. Therefore this kind of
proof being left so naked, the King used the more diligence in the
latter, for the tracing of Perkin. To this purpose, he sent abroad into
several parts, and especially into Flanders, divers secret and nimble
Scouts and Spies; some feigning themselves to flie over unto Perkin, and
to adhere unto him; and some under other pretences, to learn, search,
and discover all the circumstances and particulars of Perkin’s Parents,
Birth, Person, Travels up and down; and in brief, to have a Journal (as
it were) of his life and doings. He furnished these his employed-men
liberally with Money, to draw on and reward intelligences: giving them
also in charge, to advertise continually what they found, and
nevertheless still to go on. And ever as one Advertisement and Discovery
called up another, he employed other new Men, where the Business did
require it. Others he employed in a more special nature and trust, to be
his Pioners in the main Counter-mine. These were directed to insinuate
themselves into the familiarity and confidence of the principal persons
of the Party in Flanders, and so to learn what Associates they had, and
Correspondents, either here in England, or abroad; and how far every one
engaged, and what new ones they meant afterwards to try, or board. And
as this for the Persons; so for the Actions themselves, to discover to
the Bottom (as they could) the utmost of Perkin’s and the Conspirators
their Intentions, Hopes, and Practices. These latter Best-be-trust-Spies
had some of them further instructions, to practise and draw off the best
Friends and Servants of Perkin, by making remonstrance to them, how
weakly his Enterprize and Hopes were built, and with how prudent and
potent a King they had to deal; and to reconcile them to the King, with
promise of Pardon, and good Conditions of Reward, And (above the rest)
to assail, sap, and work into the constancy of Sir Robert Clifford; and
to win him, (if they could) being the man that knew most of their
secrets, and who being won away, would most appall and discourage the
rest, and in a manner break the Knot.</p>
<p>There is a strange Tradition; That the King being lost in a Wood of
Suspitions, and not knowing whom to trust, had both intelligence with
the Confessors and Chaplains of divers great men, and for the better
Credit of his Espials abroad with the contrary side, did use to have
them cursed at St. Pauls (by Name) amongst the Bead-Roll of the King’s
Enemies, according to the Custom of those Times. These Espials plyed
their Charge so roundly; as the King had an Anatomy of Perkin alive; and
was likewise well informed of the particular correspondent Conspirators
in England, and and many other Mysteries were revealed; and Sir Robert
Clifford in especial won to be assured to the King, and industrious and
officious for his service. The King therefore (receiving a rich Return
of his diligence, and great satisfaction touching a number of
Particulars) first divulged and spred abroad the Imposture and jugling
of Perkin’s Person and Travels, with the Circumstances thereof,
throughout the Realm. Not by Proclamation (because things were yet in
Examination, and so might receive the more or the less) but by
Court-fames, which commonly print better than printed Proclamations.
Then thought he it also time to send an Ambassage unto Archduke Philip,
into Flanders, for the abandoning and dismissing of Perkin. Herein he
employed Sir Edward Poynings, and Sir William Warham, Doctor of the
Canon Law. The Archduke was then young, and governed by his Council:
before whom the Embassadors had audience, and Doctor Warham spake in
this manner:</p>
<p>MY Lords, the King our Master is very sorry, that England and your
Countrey here of Flanders having been counted as Man and Wife for so
long time, now this Countrey of all others should be the Stage, where a
base Counterfeit should play the part of a King of England; not only to
his Graces disquiet and dishonour, but to the scorn and reproach of all
Sovereign Princes. To counterfeit the dead Image of a King in his Coyn,
is an high Offence by all Laws: But to counterfeit the living Image of a
King in his Person, exceedeth all Falsifications, except it should be
that of a Mahomet, or an Antichrist, that counterfeit Divine Honour. The
King hath too great an Opinion of this sage Council, to think that any
of you is caught with this Fable, (though way may be given by you to the
passion of some): the thing in it self is so improbable. To set
Testimonies aside of the Death of Duke Richard, which the King hath upon
Record, plain and infallible because they may be thought to be in the
King’s own Power) let the thing testifie for it self. Sense and Reason
no Power can command. Is it possible (trow you) that King Richard should
damn his Soul, and foul his Name with so a Murther, and yet not mend his
Case? Or do you think, that Men of Blood (that were his Instruments) did
turn to Pity in the middest of their Execution? Whereas in cruel and
savage Beasts, and Men also, the first Draught of Blood doth yet make
them more fierce, and enraged. Do you not know, that the Bloody
Executioners of Tyrants do go to such Errants, with an Halter about
their neck: So that if they perform not, they are sure to die for it?
And do you think, that these men would hazard their own lives, for
sparing anothers? Admit they should have saved him: What should they
have done with him? Turn him into London-Streets, that the Watch-men or
any Passenger that should light upon him, might carry him before a
Justice, and so all come to light? Or should they have kept him by them
secretly? That surely would have required a great deal of Care, Charge,
and continual Fears. But (my Lords) I labour too much in a clear
Business. The King is so wise, and hath so good Friends abroad, as now
he knoweth Duke Perkin from his Cradle. And because he is a great
Prince, if you have any good Poet here, he can help him with Notes to
write his Life; and to parallel him with Lambert Simnel, now the King’s
Falconer. And therefore (to speak plainly to your Lordships) it is the
strangest thing in the World, that the Lady Margaret (excuse us, if we
name her, whose Malice to the King is both causlless and endless) should
now when she is old, at the time when other Women give over
Child-bearing, bring forth two such Monsters; being not the Births of
nine or ten Months, but of many Years. And whereas other natural Mothers
bring forth Children weak, and not able to help themselves; she bringeth
forth tall Striplings, able soon after their coming into the World, to
bid Battel to mighty Kings. My Lords, we stay unwillingly upon this
Part. We would to God, that Lady would once tast the Joys, which God
Almighty doth serve up unto her, in beholding her Niece to Reign in such
Honour, and with so much Royal Issue, which she might be pleased to
accompt as her own. The Kings Request unto the Archduke, and your
Lordships, might be; That, according to the example of King Charles, who
hath already discarded him, you would banish this unworthy Fellow out of
your Dominions. But because the King may justly expect more from an
ancient Confederate, than from a new reconciled Enemy; he maketh his
Request unto you, to deliver him up into his hands. Pirates and
Impostures of this sort, being fit to be accounted the Common Enemies of
Mankind, and no ways to be protected by the Law of Nations.</p>
<p>After some time of deliberation, the Ambassadors received this short
Answer:</p>
<p>THat the Archduke, for the love of King Henry, would in no sort ayd
or assist the pretended Duke, but in all things conserve the Amity he
had with the King. But for the Duchess Dowager, she was absolute in the
Lands of her Dowry, and that he could not let her to dispose of her
own.</p>
<p>THE King, upon the return of the Ambassadors, was nothing satisfied
with this Answer. For well he knew, that a Patrimonial Dowry carried no
part of Sovereignty, or Command of Forces. Besides, the Ambassadors told
him plainly, that they saw the Duchess had a great Party in the
Archduke’s Council; and that howsoever it was carried in a course of
connivence, yet the Archduke under-hand gave ayd and furtherance to
Perkin. Wherefore (partly out of Courage, and partly out of Policy) the
King forthwith banished all Flemings (as well their Persons, as their
Wares) out of his Kingdom; commanding his Subjects likewise (and by name
his Merchants-Adventurers) which had a Resiance in Antwerp, to return;
translating the Mart (which commonly followed the English Cloth) unto
Calice, and embarred also all further Trade for the future. This the
King did, being sensible in point of honour, not to suffer a Pretender
to the Crown of England, to affront him so near at hand, and he to keep
terms of Friendship with the Countrey where did set up. But he had also
a further reach: for that he knew well, that the Subjects of Flanders
drew so great commodity from the Trade of England, as by this Embargo
they would soon wax weary of Perkin, and that the Tumults of Flanders
had been so late and fresh, as it was no time for the Prince to
displease the People. Nevertheless for forms sake, by way of requital,
the Archduke did likewise banish the English out of Flanders; which in
effect was done to his hand.</p>
<p>The King being well advertised, that Perkin did more trust upon
Friends and Partakers within the Realm, than upon forein Arms, thought
it behoved him to apply the Remedy, where the Disease lay; and to
proceed with severity against some of the principal Conspirators here
within the Realm; Thereby to purge the ill humours in England, and to
cool the hopes in Flanders. Wherefore he caused to be apprehended
(almost at an instant) John Ratcliff Lord Fitz-water, Sir Simon
Mountford, Sir Thomas Thwaites, William Daubigney, Robert Ratcliff,
Thomas Chressenor, and Thomas Astwood. All these were arraigned,
convicted and condemned for High-Treason, in adhering, and promising ayd
to Perkin. Of these, the Lord Fitz-water was conveyed to Calice, and
there kept in hold, and in hope of life, until soon after (either
impatient, or betrayed) he dealt with his Keeper to have escaped, and
thereupon was beheaded. But Sir Simon Mountford, Robert Ratcliff, and
William Daubigney were beheaded immediately after their Condemnation.
The rest were pardoned, together with many others, Clerks and Laicks;
amongst which were two Dominican Friers, and William Worseley, Dean of
St. Pauls: which latter sort passed Examination, but came not to publick
Tryal.</p>
<p>The Lord Chamberlain at that time was not touched; whether it were,
that the King would not stir too many humours at once, but (after the
manner of good Physicians) purge the Head last; or that Clifford (from
whom most of these Discoveries came) reserved that Piece for his own
coming over: signifying only to the King in the mean time, that he
doubted there were some greater ones in the business, whereof he would
give the King further account, when he came to his presence.</p>
<p>Upon All-hallows-day-even, being now the tenth year of the King’s
Reign, the King’s second Son Henry was created Duke of York; and as well
the Duke, as divers others, Noblemen, KnightsBatchelors, and Gentlemen
of quality were made Knights of the Bath, according to the Ceremony.
Upon the morrow after Twelfthday, the King removed from Westminster
(where he had kept his Christmas) to the Tower of London. This he did as
soon as he had advertisement, that Sir Robert Clifford (in whose Bosom
or Budget most of Perkin’s secrets were laid up) was come into England.
And the place of the Tower was chosen to that end, that if Clifford
should accuse any of the Great-ones, they might without suspition, or
noise, or sending abroad of Warrants, be presently attached; the Court
and Prison being within the cincture of one Wall. After a day or two,
the King drew unto him a selected Council, and admitted Clifford to his
presence; who first fell down at his feet, and in all humble manner
craved the King’s Pardon, which the King then granted, though he were
indeed secretly assured of his life before. Then commanded to tell his
knowledge, he did amongst many others (of himself, not interrogated)
appeach Sir William Stanley, the Lord Chamberlain of the King’s
Houshold.</p>
<p>The King seemed to be much amazed at the naming of this Lord, as if
he had heard the news of some strange and fearful Prodigy. To hear a man
that had done him service of so high a nature, as to save his Life, and
set the Crown upon his head; a man, that enjoyed by his favour and
advancement, so great a fortune, both in Honour and Riches; a man, that
was tyed unto him in so near a band of Alliance, his Brother having
married the King’s Mother; and lastly, a man to whom he had committed
the trust of his Person, in making him his Chamberlain. That this Man,
no ways disgraced, no ways discontent, no ways put in fear, should be
false unto him. Clifford was required to say over again, and again, the
Particulars of his Accusation; being warned, that in a matter so
unlikely, and that concerned so great a Servant of the King’s, he should
not in any wise go too far. But the King finding that he did sadly, and
constantly (without hesitation or varying, and with those civil
Protestations that were fit) stand to that that he had said, offering to
justifie it upon his soul and life; he caused him to be removed. And
after he had not a little bemoaned himself unto his Council there
present, gave order that Sir William Stanley should be restrained in his
own Chamber, where he lay before, in the Square Tower. And the next day
he was examined by the Lords. Upon his Examination, he denyed little of
that wherewith he was charged, nor endeavoured much to excuse or
extenuate his fault. So that (not very wisely) thinking to make his
Offence less by Confession, he made it enough for Condemnation. It was
conceived, that he trusted much to his former Merits, and the interest
that his Brother had in the King. But those helps were over-weighed by
divers things that made against him, and were predominant in the King’s
nature and mind. First, an Over-merit; for convenient Merit, unto which
reward may easily reach, doth best with Kings. Next the sense of his
Power; for the King thought, that he that could set him up, was the more
dangerous to pull him down. Thirdly, the glimmering of a Confiscation;
for he was the richest Subject for value in the Kingdom: there being
found in his Castle of Holt forty thousand Marks in ready Money, and
Plate, besides Jewels, Houshold-stuff, Stocks upon his grounds, and
other Personal Estate, exceeding great. And for his Revenue in Land and
Fee, it was three thousand Pounds a year of old-Rent, a great matter in
those times. Lastly, the Nature of the Time; for if the King had been
out of fear of his own Estate, it was not unlike he would have spared
his life. But the Cloud of so great a Rebellion hanging over his head,
made him work sure. Wherefore after some six Weeks distance of time,
which the King did honorably interpose, both to give space to his
Brother’s Intercession, and to shew to the world, that he had a conflict
with himself what he should do; he was arraigned of High-Treason, and
condemned, and presently after beheaded.</p>
<p>Yet it is to this day left but in dark memory, both what the Case of
this Noble Person was, for which he suffered; and what likewise was the
ground and cause of his defection, and the alienation of his heart from
the King. His Case was said to be this: That in discourse between Sir
Robert Clifford and him, he had said, That if he were sure, that that
young man were King Edward’s Son, he would never bear Arms against him.
This Case seems somewhat an hard Case, both in respect of the
Conditional, and in respect of the other words. But for the Conditional,
it seems the Judges of that time (who were Learned men, and the three
chief of them of the Privy Council) thought it was a dangerous thing to
admit Ifs and Ands, to qualifie words of Treason; whereby every man
might express his malice, and blanch his danger. And it was like to the
Case (in the following times) of Elizabeth-Barton, the holy Maid of
Kent; who had said, That if King Henry the Eighth did not take Catherine
his Wife again, he should be deprived of his Crown, and dye the death of
a Dog. And infinite Cases may be put of like nature. Which (it seemeth)
the grave Judges taking into Consideration, would not admit of Treasons
upon Condition. And as for the Positive words, That he would not bear
Arms against King Edward’s Son, though the words seem calm, yet it was a
plain and direct Overruling of the King’s Title, either by Line of
Lancaster, or by Act of Parliament. Which (no doubt) pierced the King
more, than if Stanley had charged his Lance upon him in the field. For
if Stanley would hold that opinion, that a Son of King Edward had still
the better right, he being so principal a person of Authority, and
favour about the King; it was to teach all England to say as much. And
therefore (as those times were) that speech touched the quick. But some
Writers do put this out of doubt; for they say, that Stanley did
expresly promise to ayd Perkin, and sent him some help of Treasure.</p>
<p>Now for the Motive of his falling off from the King; It is true, that
at Bosworth-Field the King was be-set, and in a manner inclosed round
about by the Troops of King Richard, and in manifest danger of his life;
when this Stanley was sent by his Brother, with three thousand men to
his Rescue, which he performed so, that King Richard was slain upon the
Place. So as the condition of Mortal men is not capable of a greater
benefit, than the King received by the hands of Stanley; being like the
benefit of Christ, at once to Saye, and Crown. For which service the
King gave him great gifts, made him his Counsellor and Chamberlain; and
(some what contrary to his nature) had winked at the great Spoils of
Bosworth-Field, which came almost wholly to this man’s hands, to his
infinite enriching. Yet nevertheless blown up with the conceit of his
Merit, he did not think he had received good Measure from the King, at
least not Pressing-down, and Runningover, as he expected. And his
ambition was so exorbitant, and unbounded, as he became Sultor to the
King for the Earldom of Chester. Which ever being a kind of Appennage to
the Principality of Wales and using to go to the King’s Son; his Suit
did not only end in a Denial, but in a Distaste. The King perceiving
thereby, that his Desires were intemperate, and his Cogitations vast,
and irregular, and that his former Benefits were but cheap, and lightly
regarded by him. Wherefore the King began not to brook him well. And as
a little Leaven of new Distaste doth commonly sowre the whole Lump of
former Merits, the King’s Wit began now to suggest unto his Passion,
that Stanley, at Bosworth-Field, though he came time enough to save his
life, yet he stayed long enough to endanger it. But yet having no matter
against him, he continued him in his Places, until this his Fall.</p>
<p>After him was made Lord Chamberlain, Giles Lord Dawbeny, a man of
great sufficiency and valour; the more, because he was gentle and
moderate.</p>
<p>There was a common Opinion, That Sir Robert Clifford (who now was
become the State-Informer) was from the beginning an Emissary, and Spy
of the King’s; and that he fled over into Flanders, with his consent and
privity. But this is not probable; both because he never recovered that
degree of Grace, which he had with the King before his going over: and
chiefly, for that the Discovery which he had made touching the Lord
Chamberlain (which was his great Service) grew not from any thing he
learn’d abroad, for that he knew it well before he went.</p>
<p>These Executions (and especially that of the Lord Chamberlain’s,
which was the chief strength of the Party, and by means of Sir Robert
Clifford, who was the most inward man of Trust amongst them) did
extremely quail the Design of Perkin, and his complices, as well through
Discouragement, as Distrust. So that they were now (like Sand without
Lime) ill bound together; especially as many as were English: who were
at a gaze, looking strange, one upon another, not knowing who was
faithful to their Side; but thinking, that the King (what with his
Baits, and what with his Nets) would draw them all unto him that were
any thing worth. And indeed it came to pass, that divers came away by
the Thred, sometimes one, and sometimes another, Barley (that was
Joynt-Commissioner with Clifford) did hold out one of the longest, till
Perkin was far worn; yet made his Peace at the length. But the Fall of
this Great man, being in so high Authority and Favour (as was thought)
with the King; and the manner of Carriage of the Business, as if there
had been secret Inquisition upon him, for a great time before, and the
Cause for which he suffered, which was little more, than for saying in
effect, That the Title of York was better than the Title of Lancaster;
which was the Case almost of every man (at the least in Opinion;) was
matter of great Terrour amongst all the King’s Servants and Subjects:
Insomuch, as no man almost thought himself secure; and men durst scarce
commune or talk one with another: but there was a general Diffidence
every where. Which nevertheless made the King rather more Absolute, than
more Safe. For, Bleeding Inwards and shut Vapours strangle soonest, and
oppress most.</p>
<p>Hereupon presently came forth Swarms and Volies of Libels (which are
the Gusts of Liberty of Speech restrained, and the Females of Sedition)
containing bitter Invectives, and Slanders against the King, and some of
the Council. For the contriving and dispersing whereof (after great
Diligence of Inquiry) five mean persons were caught, and executed.</p>
<p>Mean while; the King did not neglect Ireland, being the Soil where
the Musbromes and Upstart-Weeds (that spring up in a Night) did chiefly
prosper. He sent therefore from hence (for the better setling of his
affairs there) Commissioners of both Robes: The Prior of Lanthony, to be
his Chancellour in that Kingdom; and Sir Edward Poynings, with a Power
of Men, and a Marshal Commission, together with a Civil Power of his
Lieutenant, with a Clause, That the Earl of Kildare, then Deputy, should
obey him. But, the Wild-Irish (who were the principal Offendors) fled
into the Woods and Bogs, after their manner: and those, that knew
themselves guilty, in the Pale, fled to them. So that Sir Edward
Poynings was enforced to make a Wild-Chase upon the Wild-Irish: Where
(in respect of the Mountains and Fastnesses) he did little good. Which
(either out of a suspicious Melancholy upon his bad Success, or the
better to save his service from Disgrace) he would needs impute unto the
Comfort, that the Rebels should receive under-hand from the Earl of
Kildare; every light suspition growing upon the Earl, in respect of the
Kildare that was in the Action of Lambert Simnel, and slain at
Stoke-field. Wherefore he caused the Earl to be apprehended, and sent
into England; where, upon Examination, he cleared himself so well, as he
was re-placed in his Government. But, Poynings (the better to make
compensation of the Meagerness of his Service in the Wars, by acts of
Peace) called a Parliament; where was made that memorable Act, which
this day is called Poynings Law, whereby all the Statutes of England
were made to be of force in Ireland. For, before they were not: neither
are any now in force in Ireland, which were made in England since that
time; which was the tenth year of the King.</p>
<p>About this time, began to be discovered in the King that disposition,
which, afterward nourished and whet-on by bad Counsellors and Ministers,
proved the Blot of his times; which was, the course he took, to crush
Treasure out of his Subjects Purses, by Forfeitures upon Penal Laws. At
this, men did startle the more at this time, because it appeared plainly
to be in the King’s Nature, and not out of his Necessity, he being now
in Float for Treasure; For that he had newly received the Peace-money
from France, the Benevolence-money from his Subjects, and great
Casualties upon the Confiscations of the Lord Chamberlain, and divers
others. The first noted Case of this kind, was that of Sir William
Capel, Alderman of London: Who, upon sundry Penal Laws, was condemned in
the summ of seven and twenty hundred Pounds, and compounded with the
King for sixteen hundred: And yet after, Empson would have cut another
Chop out of him, if the King had not died in the instant.</p>
<p>The Summer following, the King, to comfort his Mother (whom he did
always tenderly love and revere) and to make Demonstration to the World,
that the proceedings against Sir William Stanley (which was imposed upon
him by necessity of State) had not in any degree diminished the
affection he bare to Thomas, his Brother; went in Progress to Latham, to
make merry with his Mother, and the Earl; and lay there divers days.</p>
<p>During this Progress, Perkin Warbeck finding, that time and
temporizing, which (whilest his practices were covert and wrought well
in England) made for him; did now, when they were discovered and
defeated, rather make against him, (for that when matters once go down
the Hill, they stay not without a new force) resolved to try his
adventure in some exploit upon England; hoping still upon the affections
of the Common People towards the House of York. Which body of Common
People he thought was not to be practised upon, as persons of Quality
are; But, that they only practice upon their affections, was, to set up
a Standard in the field. The Place where he should make his Attempt, he
chose to be the Coast of Kent.</p>
<p>The King by this time was grown to such an height of Reputation for
cunning and Policy, that every Accident and Event, that went well, was
laid and imputed to his foresight, as if he had set it before: As, in
this particular of Perkin’s Design upon Kent. For, the world would not
believe afterwards, but the King, having secret Intelligence of Perkin’s
intention for Kent (the better to draw it on) went of purpose into the
North, a-faroff, laying an open side unto Perkin, to make him come to
the close, and so to trip up his heels, having made sure in Kent
beforehand.</p>
<p>But so it was, that Perkin had gathered together a Power of all
Nations, neither in number, not in the hardiness and courage of the
Persons, contemptible; but, in their nature and fortunes, to be feared
as well of Friends as Enemies; being Bankrupts, and many of them Felons,
and such as lived by Rapine. These he put to Sea, and arrived upon the
Coast of Sandwich and Deal in Kent, about July.</p>
<p>There he cast Anchor; and to prove the affections of the People, sent
some of his men to land, making great boast of the Power that was to
follow. The Kentish-men (perceiving that Perkin was not followed by any
English of name or account, and that his forces consisted but of
strangers born, and most of them base People, and Free-booters, fitter
to spoil a Coast, than to recover a Kingdom) resorting unto the
principal Gentlemen of the Countrey, professed their loyalty to the
King, and desired to be directed and commanded for the best of the
King’s service. The Gentlemen, entring into Consultation, directed some
forces in good number, to shew themselves upon the Coast; and some of
them to make signs, to entice Perkin’s Soldiers to land, as if they
would joyn with them: and some others to appear from some other places,
and to make semblance as if they fled from them; the better to encourage
them to land. But, Perkin (who, by playing the Prince, or else taught by
Secretary Frion, had learned thus much, That People under Command, do
use to consult, and after to march in order; and Rebels contrariwise run
upon an Head together in confusion) considering the delay of time, and
observing their orderly, and not tumultuary Arming, doubted the worst.
And therefore the wily Youth would not set one foot out of his Ship,
till he might see things were sure. Wherefore the King’s Forces,
perceiving that they could draw on no more than those that were formerly
landed, set upon them, and cut them in pieces, ere they could flie back
to their Ships. In which Skirmish (besides those that fled, and were
slain) there were taken about an hundred and fifty persons. Which, for
that the King thought, that to punish a few for example was Gentleman’s
play, but for Rascal-People, they were to be cut off every man,
especially in the beginning of an Enterprize; and likewise for that he
saw, that Perkin’s Forces would now consist chiefly of such Rabble and
scum of desperate people; he therefore hanged them all, for the greater
terrour. They were brought to London, all rail’d in Ropes, like a Team
of Horses in a Cart; and were executed some of them at London, and
Wapping, and the rest at divers places upon the Sea-Coast of Kent,
Sussex, and Norfolk, for Sea-marks, or Light-houses, to teach Perkin’s
People to avoid the Coast. The King, being advertised of the landing of
the Rebels, thought to leave his Progress: But, being certified the next
day, that they were partly defeated, and partly fled, he continued his
Progress, and sent Sir Richard Guilford into Kent in message. Who,
calling the Countrey together, did much commend (from the King) their
fidelity, manhood, and well handling of that service; and gave them all
thanks, and (in private) promised Reward to some particulars.</p>
<p>Upon the sixteenth of November (this being the Eleventh year of the
King) was holden the Serjeants-Feast, at Ely-Place; there being nine
Serjeants of that Call. The King, to honour the Feast, was present with
his Queen at the Dinner; being a Prince, that was ever ready to grace
and countenance the Professors of the Law; having a little of that, That
as he governed his Subjects by his Laws, so he governed his Laws by his
Lawyers.</p>
<p>This year also the King entred into League with the Italian
Potentates, for the defence of Italy, against France. For, King Charles
had conquered the Realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind of
Felicity of a Dream. He passed the whole length of Italy without
resistance: so that it was true which Pope Alexander was wont to say;
That the French-men came into Italy, with in their hands, to mark up
their lodgings, rather than with Swords to fight. He likewise entred and
won, in effect, the whole Kingdom of Naples it self, without striking
stroke. But, presently thereupon, he did commit and multiply so many
Errours, as was too great a task for the best fortune to overcome. He
gave no contentment to the Barons of Naples, of the Faction of the
Angeovines; but, scattered his rewards according to the mercenary
appetites of some about him. He put all Italy upon their Guard, by the
seizing and holding of Ostia, and the protecting of the Liberty of Pisa:
which made all men suspect that his purposes looked further, than his
Title of Naples. He fell too soon at difference with Ludovico Sfortia;
who was the man that carried the Keys which brought him in, and shut him
out. He neglected to extinguish some reliques of the War. And lastly, in
regard of his easie passage through Italy without resistance, he entred
into an over-much despising of the Arms of the Italians: whereby he left
the Realm of Naples, at his departure, so much the less provided. So
that not long after his return; the whole Kingdom revolted to Ferdinando
the younger, and the French were quite driven out. Nevertheless, Charles
did make both great threats, and great preparations, to re-enter Italy
once again. Wherefore, at the instance of divers of the States of Italy
(and especially of Pope Alexander, there was a League concluded, between
the said Pope, Maximilian King of Romans, Henry King of England,
Ferdinando and Isabella, King and Queen of Spain (for so they are
constantly placed in the Original Treaty throughout,) Augustissimo
Barbadico, Duke of Venice and Ludovico Sfortia, Duke of Millan, for the
common defence of their Estates. Wherein though Ferdinando of Naples was
not named as principal; yet, no doubt, the Kingdom of Naples was tacitly
included, as a Fee of the Church.</p>
<p>There dyed also this year Cecile, Duchess of York, Mother to King
Edward the Fourth, at her Castle of Barkbamstead, being of extreme
years; and who had lived to see three Princes of her body crowned, and
four murthered. She was buried at Foderingham, by her Husband.</p>
<p>This year also the King called his Parliament: where many Laws were
made, of a more private and vulgar nature, than ought to detain the
Reader of an History. And it may be justly suspected, by the proceedings
following, that as the King did excell in good Common-wealth Laws; so
nevertheless he had, in secret, a design to make use of them, as well
for collecting of Treasure, as for correcting of Manners; and so,
meaning thereby to harrow his People, did accumulate them the
rather.</p>
<p>The principal Law, that was made this Parliament, was a Law of a
strange nature: rather just, than legal; and more magnanimous than
provident. This Law did ordain, That no person, that did assist in Arms,
or otherwise, the King for the time being, should after be impeached
therefore, or attainted, either by the course of the Law, or by Act of
Parliament: But, if any such Act of Attainder did happen to be made, it
should be void, and of none effect; For that it was agreeable to reason
of Estate, that the Subject should not enquire of the justness of the
King’s Title, or Quarrel; and it was agreeable to good Conscience, (that
whatsoever the fortune of the War were) the Subject should not suffer
for his Obedience. The spirit of this Law was wonderful Pious and Noble:
being like in matter of War, unto the spirit of David in matter of
Plague, who said, If I have sinned, strike me; but what have these sheep
done? Neither wanted this Law parts of prudent and deep fore-sight. For,
it did the better take away occasion, for the People to busie
themselves, to pry into the King’s Title for that howsoever it fell,
their safety was already provided for. Besides, it could not but greatly
draw unto him, the love and hearts of the People, because he seemed more
careful for them, than for himself. But yet nevertheless, it did take
off from his Party, that great Tye and Spur of necessity, to fight and
go Victors out of the field; considering their lives and fortunes were
put in safety, and protected, whether they stood to it, or ran away. But
the force and obligation of this Law was in it self Illusory, as to the
latter part of it; by a precedent Act of Parliament, to bind or
frustrate a future. For a supreme and absolute Power cannot conclude it
self, neither can that which is in nature revocable be made fixed: no
more than if a man should appoint or declare by his Will, that if he
made any Latter Will, it should be void. And for the Case of the Act of
Parliament, there is a notable President of it in King Henry the
Eighth’s time: Who, doubting he might dye in the minority of his Son,
procured an Act to pass, That no Statute made during the minority of the
King, should bind him or his Successors, except it were confirmed by the
King under his great Seal, at his full age. But the first Act that
passed in King Edward the Sixth his time, was an Act of Repeal of that
former Act; at which time nevertheless the King was Minor. But things
that do not bind; may satisfie for the time.</p>
<p>There was also made a shoaring or under-propping Act for the
Benevolence; to make the summs which any person had agreed to pay, and
nevertheless were not brought in, to be leviable by course of Law. Which
Act did not only bring in the Arears, but did indeed countenance the
whole business, and was pretended to be made at the desire of those,
that had been forward to pay.</p>
<p>This Parliament also was made that good Law, which gave the Attaint
upon a false Verdict between Party and Party, which before was a kind of
Evangile, irremediable. It extends not to causes Capital, as well
because they are for the most part at the King’s Suit; as because in
them (if they be followed in Course of Indictment) there passeth a
double Jury, the Indictors and the Tryers; and so not Twelve Men, but
Four and twenty. But it seemeth that was not the only reason; for this
reason holdeth not in the Appeal. But the great reason was, lest it
should tend to the discouragement of Jurors in Cases of Life and Death;
if they should be subject to Suit and Penalty, where the favour of Life
maketh against them. It extendeth not also to any Suit, where the Demand
is under the value of forty Pounds; for that in such Cases of petty
value, it would not quit the Charge, to go about again.</p>
<p>There was another Law made against a branch of Ingratitude in Women,
who having been advanced by their Husbands., or their Husbands
Ancestors, should alien, and thereby seek to defeat the Heirs, or those
in Remainder, of the Lands, whereunto they had been so advanced. The
remedy was, by giving power to the next, to enter for a forfeiture.</p>
<p>There was also enacted that Charitable Law, for the admission of poor
Suitors In Forma Pauperis, without Fee to Counsellor, Attorney, or
Clerk, whereby poor men became rather able to vex; than unable to sue.
There were divers other good Laws made that Parliament, as we said
before: but we still observe our manner, in selecting out those, that
are not of a Vulgar nature.</p>
<p>The King this while, though he sate in Parliament, as in full Place,
and seemed to account of the designs of Perkin (who was now returned
into Flanders) but as a May-game; yet having the composition of a
wise-King (Stout without, and Apprehensive within) had given order for
the watching of Beacons upon the Coasts, and erecting more where they
stood too thin; and had a careful eye where this wandering Cloud would
break. But Perkin advised to keep his fire (which hitherto burned as it
were upon green wood) alive, with continual blowing; Sailed again into
Ireland, whence he had formerly departed, rather upon the hopes France,
than upon any unreadiness or discouragement he found in that People. But
in the space of time between the King’s Diligence and Poynings
Commission, had so setled things there, as there was nothing left for
Perkin, but the blustring affection of wild and naked people. Wherefore
he was advised by his Council, to seek ayd of the King of Scotland; a
Prince young, and valorous, and in good terms with his Nobles and
People, and ill affected to King Henry. At this time also both
Maximilian and Charles of France began to bear no good will to the King.
The one being displeased with the King’s Prohibition of Commerce with
Flanders; the other holding the King for suspect, in regard of his late
entry into League with the Italians. Wherefore besides the open Ayds of
the Duchess of Burgandy, which did with Sails and Oars put on and
advance Perkin’s designs, there wanted not some secret Tides from
Maximilian and Charles, which did further his fortunes. In so much as
they, both by their secret Letters, and Messages, recommended him to the
King of Scotland.</p>
<p>Perkin therefore coming into Scotland upon those hopes, with a well
appointed company, was by the King of Scots (being formerly well
prepared) honourably welcomed, and soon after his arrival admitted to
his Presence, in a solemn manner. For the King received him in State in
his Chamber of Presence, accompanied with divers of his Nobles. And
Perkin well attended, as well with those that the King had sent before
him, as with his own Train, entred the room where the King was, and
coming near to the King, and bowing a little to embrace him, he retired
some paces back, and with a loud voice (that all that were present might
hear him) made his Declaration in this manner:</p>
<p>HIgh and Mighty King, your Grace, and these your Nobles here present,
may be pleased benignly to bow your Ears, to hear the Tragedy of a young
Man, that by right ought to hold in his hand the Ball of a Kingdom; but
by Fortune is made Himself a Ball; tossed from Misery to Misery, and
from Place to Place. You see here before you the Spectacle of a
Plantagenet, who hath been carried from the Nursery to the Sanctuary;
from the Sanctuary, to the direful Prison; from the Prison, to the hand
of the cruel Tormentor; and from that hand, to the wide-Wilderness (as I
may truly call it) for so the World hath been to me. So that he that is
born to a great Kingdom, hath not ground to set his foot upon, more than
this where he now standeth, by your Princely Favour. Edward the Fourth,
late King of England, (as your Grace cannot but have heard) left two
Sons; Edward, and Richard Duke of York, both very young. Edward, the
eldest succeeded their Father in the Crown, by the name of King Edward
the Fifth. But Richard, Duke of Gloceffer, their unnatural Uncle, first
thirsting after the Kingdom, through Ambition, and afterwards thirsting
for their Blood, out of desire to secure himself; employed an Instrument
of his (confident to him, as he thought) to murther them both. But this
Man that was employed to execate that execrable Tragedy, having cruelly
slain King Edward the eldest of the two, was moved partly by Remorse,
and partly by some other mean, to save Richard his Brother; making a
Report nevertheless to the Tyrant, that he had performed his Commandment
for both Brethren. This Report was accordingly believed, and published
generally. So that the World hath been possessed of an Opinion, that
they both were barbarously made away, though ever Truth hath some sparks
that flie abroad, until it appear in due time, as this hath had. But
Almighty God, that stopped the mouth of the Lion, and saved little Joas
from the Tyranny of Athaliah, when she massacred the King’s Children;
and did save Isaac, when the hand was stretched forth to sacrifice him,
preserved the second Brother. For I my self, that stand here in your
presence, am that very Richard, Duke of York, Brother of that
infortunate Prince, King Edward the Fifth, now the most rightful
surviving Heir-male to that Victorious and most Noble Edward, of that
name the Fourth, late King of England. For the manner of my Escape, it
is fit it should pass in silence, or (at least) in a more secret
Relation: for that it may concern some alive, and the memory of some
that are dead. Let it suffice to think, that I had then a Mother living,
a Queen, and one that expected daily such a Commandment from the Tyrant,
for the murthering of her Children. Thus in my tender age escaping by
God’s mercy out of London, I was secretly conveyed over Sea. Where,
after a time, the Party that had me in Charge, (upon what new Fears,
change of Mind; or Practice, God knoweth) suddenly forsook me. Whereby I
was forced to wander abroad, to seek mean Conditions for the sustaining
of my Life. Wherefore distracted between several Passions, the one of
fear to be known, lest the Tyrant should have a new Attempt upon me; the
other of Grief and Disdain to be unknown, and to live in that base and
servile manner that I did; I resolved with my self to expect the
Tyrant’s death, and then to put my self into my Sisters hands, who was
next Heir to the Crown. But in this season, it happened one Henry
Tidder, Son to Edmond Tidder Earl of Richmond, to come from France, and
enter into the Realm, and by subtil and foul means to obtain the Crown
of the same, which to me rightfully appertained. So that it was but a
change, from Tyrant to Tyrant. This Henry, my extreme and mortal Enemy,
so soon as he had knowledge of my being alive, imagined and wrought all
the subtil ways and means he could, to procure my final Destruction. For
my mortal Enemy hath not only falsly surmised me to be a feigned Person,
giving me Nick-names, so abusing the World; but also, to deferr and put
me from entry into England, hath offered large summs of Money, to
corrupt the Princes and their Ministers, with whom I have been retained;
and made importune Labours to certain Servants about my Person, to
murther or Poyson me, and others to forsake and leave my righteous
Quarrel, and to depart from my Service, as Sir Robert Clifford, and
others. So that every man of Reason may well perceive, that Henry,
calling himself King of England, needed not to have bestowed such great
summs of Treasure, nor so to have busied himself with importune and
incessant Labour and Industry, to compass my Death and Ruine, if I had
been such a feigned Person. But the truth of my Cause being so manifest,
moved the most Christian King Charles, and the Lady Duchess Dowager of
Burgundy, my most dear Aunt, not only to acknowledge the truth thereof,
but lovingly to assist me. But it seemeth that God above (for the good
of this whole Island, and the knitting of these two Kingdoms of England
and Scotland in a strait Concord and Amity, by so great an Obligation)
had reserved the placing of me in the Imperial Throne of England, for
the Arms and Succours of your Grace. Neither is it the first time that a
King of Scotland hath supported them, that were bereft and spoiled of
the Kingdom of England; as of late (in fresh memory) it was done in the
Person of Henry the Sixth. Wherefore for that your Grace hath given
clear signs, that you are in no Noble quality inferiour to your Royal
Ancestors; I, so distressed a Prince, was hereby moved to come and put
my self into your Royal Hands, desiring your Assistance to recover my
Kingdom of England; promising faithfully to bear my self towards your
Grace no otherwise, than if I were your own Natural Brother, and will
upon the Recovery of mine Inheritance, gratefully do you all the
Pleasure that is in my utmost Power.</p>
<p>AFter Perkin had told his Tale, King James answered bravely and
wisely;</p>
<p>That whatsoever he were, he should not repent him of putting himself
into his hand.</p>
<p>And from that time forth, though there wanted not some about him,
that would have perswaded him, that all was but an Illusion; yet
notwithstanding, either taken by Perkin’s amiable and alluring
behaviour, or inclining to the recommendation of the great Princes
abroad, or willing to take an occasion of a War against King Henry, he
entertained him in all things, as became the person of Richard Duke of
York; embraced his Quarrel; (and the more to put it out of doubt, that
he took him to be a great Prince, and not a Representation only) he gave
consent that this Duke should take to Wife the Lady Catherine Gordon,
Daughter to Earl Huntley, being a near Kinswoman to the King himself,
and a young Virgin of excellent beauty and virtue.</p>
<p>Not long after, the King of Scots in person, with Perkin in his
company, entred with a great Army (though it consisted chiefly of
Borderers, being raised somewhat suddenly) into Northumberland. And
Perkin, for a Perfume before him as he went, caused to be published a
Proclamation of this tenour following, in the name of Richard Duke of
York, true Inheritor of the Crown of England.</p>
<p>IT hath pleased God, who putteth down the Mighty from their Seat, and
exalteth the Humble, and suffereth not the hopes of the Just to perish
in the end, to give Us means at the length, to shew Our Selves armed
unto Our Lieges and People of England. But far be it from Us, to intend
their hurt and damage, or to make War upon them, otherwise than to
deliver Our Self and them from Tyranny and Oppression. For, Our mortal
Enemy Henry Tidder, a false of the Crown of England, (which tolls by
Natural and Lineal Right appertaineth) knowing in his own Heart Our
undoubted Right, (We being the very Richard, Duke of York; younger Son,
and now surviving Heir-male of the Noble and Victorious Edward the
Fourth, late King of England) hath not only deprived Us of Our Kingdom,
but likewise by all foul and wicked means, sought to betray Us, and
bereave Us of Our Life. Yet if his Tyranny only extended it self to Our
Person (although Our Royal Blood teacheth Us to be sensible of Injuries)
it should be less to Our Grief. But this Tidder, who boasteth himself to
have overthrown a Tyrant, hath ever since his first entrance into his
Usurped Reign, put little in practice, but Tyranny and the feats
thereof.</p>
<p>For King Richard Our unnatural Uncle, although desire of Rule did
blind him, yet in his other actions (like a true Plantagenet) was Noble,
and loved the Honour of the Realm, and the Contentment and Comfort of
his Nobles and People. But this Our Mortal Enemy (agreeable to the
meanness of his Birth) hath trod under foot the Honour of this Nation;
selling Our hest Confederates for Money, and making Merchandize of the
Blood, Estates, and Fortunes of Our Peers and Subjects, by feigned wars,
and dishonourable Peace, only to enrich his Coffers. Nor unlike hath
been his hateful Mis-government, and evil Deportments at home. First, he
hath (to fortifie his false Quarrel) caused divers Nobles of this Our
Realm (whom he held Suspect, and stood in dread of) to be cruelly
murthred; as Our Cousin Sir William Stanley Lord Chamberlain, Sir Simon
Mountfort, Sir Robert Ratcliff, William Dawbeney, Humphrey Stafford, and
many others, besides such as have dearly bought their Lives with
intolerable Ransoms. Some of which Nobles are now in the Sanctuary. Also
he hath long kept, and yet keepeth in Prison, Our right entirely beloved
Cousin Edward, Son and Heir to Our Uncle Duke of Clarence, and others;
with-bolding from them their rightful Inheritance, to the intent they
should never be of might and power, to aid and assist Us at Our need,
after the duty of their Liegeances. He also married by compulsion
certain of Our Sisters, and also the Sister of Our said Cousin the Earl
of Warwick, and divers other Ladies of the Royal Blood, unto certain of
his Kinsmen and Friends of simple and low Degree, and putting apart all
well-disposed Nobles, he hath none in favour and trust about his Person,
but Bishop Fox, Smith, Bray, Lovel, Oliver King, David Owen, Risley,
Turbervile, Tiler, Cholmley, Empson, James Hobart, John Cut, Garth,
Henry Wyat, and such other Cattiffs and Villains of Birth, which by
subtil Inventions and Pilling of the People, have been the principal
Finders, Occasioners, and Counsellors of the Mis-rule and Mischief now
reigning in England.</p>
<p>We remembring these Premisses, with the great and execrable Offences
daily committed and done by Our foresaid great Enemy, and his Adherents,
in breaking the Liberties and Franchises of Our Mother the Holy Church,
upon pretences of Wicked and Heathenish Policy, to the high displeasure
of Almighty God; besides the manifold Treasons, abominable Murthers
Man-slaughters, Robberies, Extortions, the daily Pilling of the People,
by Disms, Taxes, Tallages, Benevolences, and other unlawful Impositions,
and grievous Exactions, with many other heinous Effects, to the likely
destruction and desolation of the whole Realm; shall by God’s grace, and
the help and assistante of the great Lords of Our Blood, with the
counsel of other sad Persons, see that the Commodities of Our Realm be
employed to the most advantage of the same; the intercourse of
Merchandise betwixt Realm and Realm, to be ministred and handled, as
shall more be to the Common-weal and prosperity of Our Subjects; and all
such Disms, Taxes, Tallages, Benevolences, unlawful Impositions, and
grievous Exactions, as be above rehearsed to be fore-done and laid
apart, and never from henceforth to be called upon, but in such cases as
Our Noble Progenitors, Kings of England, have of old time been
accustomed to have the ayd, succour, and help of their Subjects and true
Liege-men.</p>
<p>And further, We do out of Our Grace and Clemency, hereby as well
publish and promise to all our Subjects Remission and free Pardon of all
By-past Offences whatsoever, against Our Person, or Estate, in adhering
to Our said Enemy, by whom (We know well) they have been mis-led, if
they shall within time convenient submit themselves unto Us. And for
such as shall come with the foremost, to assist Our Righteous Quarrel,
We shall make them so far partakers of Our Princely Favour and Bounty;
as shall be highly for the Comfort of them and theirs, both during their
life, and after their death. As also We shall by all means, which God
shall put into Our hands, demean Our selves to give Royal contentment to
all Degrees and Estates of Our People, maintaining the Liberties of Holy
Church in their Entire, preserving the Honours, Priviledges, and
Prebeminences of Our Nobles, from contempt or disparagement, according
to the dignity of their Blood. We shall also unyoak. Our People from all
heavy Burthens and Endurances, and confirm Our Cities, Boroughs, and
Towns in their Charters and Freedoms, with enlargement, where it shall
be deserved, and in all points give Our Subjects cause to think, that
the blessed and debonair Government of Our Noble Father King Edward (in
his last times) is in Us revived.</p>
<p>And for as much as the putting to death, or taking alive of Our said
Mortal Enemy, may be a mean to stay much effusion of Blood, which
otherwise may ensue, if by Compulsion or fair Promises, he shall draw
after him any number of Our Subjects to resist Us; whith We desire to
avoid (though We be certainly informed, that Our said Enemy is purposed
and prepared to flie the Land, having already made over great masses of
the Treasure of Our Crown, the better to support him in Forein Parts) We
do hereby declare, That whosoever shall take or distress Our said Enemy
(though the Party be of never so mean a Condition) he shall be by Us
rewarded with a Thousand Pound in Money, forthwith to be laid down to
him, and an Hundred Marks by the year of Inheritance; besides that he
may otherwise merit, both toward God and all good People, for the
destruction of such a Tyrant.</p>
<p>Lastly, We do all men to wit; and herein We take also God to witness,
That whereas God hath moved the Heart of Our dearest Cousin, the King of
Scotland, to aid Us in Person, in this Our righteous Quarrel; it is
altogether without any Pact or Promise, or so much as demand of any
thing, that may prejudice Our Crown, or Subjects: But contrariwise with
promise on Our said Cousin’s part, that whensoever he shall find Us in
sufficient strength to get the upper hand of Our Enemy, (which we hope
will be very suddenly) he will forthwith peaceably return into his own
Kingdom; contenting himself only with the glory of so Honourable an
Enterprize, and Our true and faithful Love and Amity. Which We shall
ever (by the Grace of Almighty God) so order, as shall be to the great
comfort of both Kingdoms.</p>
<p>BUT Perkin’s Proclamation did little edifie with the people of
England; neither was he the better welcom for the company he came in.
Wherefore the King of Scotland seeing none came in to Perkin, nor none
stirred any where in his favour, turned his Enterprize into a Rode; and
wasted and destroyed the Countrey of Northumberland with fire and sword.
But hearing that there were Forces coming against him, and not willing
that they should find his men heavy and laden with booty, he returned
into Scotland with great Spoils, deferring further prosecution, till
another time. It is said, that Perkin acting the part of a Prince
handsomly, when he saw the Scottish fell to waste the Countrey, came to
the the King in a passionate manner, making great lamentation, and
desired, That that might not be the manner of making the War, for that
no Crown was so dear to his mind, as that he desired to purchase it with
the blood and ruine of his Countrey. Whereunto the King answered half in
sport; that he doubted much, he was careful for that that was none of
his, and that he should be too good a Steward for his Enemy, to save the
Countrey to his use.</p>
<p>By this time, being the Eleventh year of the King, the Interruption
of Trade between the English and the Plemmish, began to pinch the
Merchants of both Nations very sore. Which moved them, by all means they
could devise, to affect and dispose their Savereigns respectively, to
open the Intercourse again. Wherein, time favoured them. For the
Arch-Duke and his Council began to see, that Perkin would prove but a
Runnagate, and Citizen of the World; and that it was the part of
Children to fall out about Babies. And the King on his part, after the
Attempts upon Kent and Northumberland, began to have the business of
Perkin in less estimation; so as he did not put it to accompt, in any
Consultation of State. But that that moved him most, was, that being a
King that loved Wealth and Treasure, he could not endure to have Trade
sick, nor any Obstruction to continue in the Gate-vein, which disperseth
that blood. And yet he kept State so far, as first to be sought unto.
Wherein the Merchant-Adventurers likewise, (being a strong Company at
that time, and well under-set with rich men, and good order) did hold
out bravely; taking off the Commodities of the Kingdom, though they lay
dead upon their hands for want of Vent. At the last, Commissioners met
at London, to Treat. On the King’s part; Bishop Fox Lord Privy Seal,
Viscount Wells; Kendal Prior of St. John’s, Warham Master of the Polls,
who began to gain much upon the King’s opinion; Urswick, who was almost
ever one; and Risley. On the Arch-Duke’s part, the Lord Bevers his
Admiral, the Lord Verunsel President of Flanders, and others. These
concluded a perfect Treaty, both of Amity and Intercourse, between the
King and the Arch-Duke; containing Articles both of State, Commerce, and
Free-Fishing. This is that Treaty, which the Flemings call at this day;
Intercursus Magnus; both because it is more compleat, than the precedent
Treaties of the Third and Fourth years of the King: and chiefly to give
it a difference from the Treaty (that followed in the One and twentieth
year of the King, which they call Intercursus Malus. In this Treaty,
there was an express Article against the Reception of the Rebels of
either Prince by other; purporting, that if any such Rebel should be
required by the Prince whose Rebel he was, of the Prince Confederate,
that forthwith the Prince Confederate should by Proclamation command him
to avoid the Countrey. Which if he did not within fifteen days, the
Rebel was to stand proscribed, and put out of Protection. But
nevertheless in this Article, Perkin was not named, neither perhaps
contained, because he was no Rebel. But by this means his wings were
clipt off his Followers, that were English. And it was expresly
comprised in the Treaty, that it should extend to the Territories of the
Duchess Dowager. After the Intercourse thus restored, the English
Merchants came again to their Mansion at Antwerp, where they were
received with Procession and great Joy.</p>
<p>The Winter sollowing, being the Twelfth year of his reign, the King
called again his Parliament: Where he did much exaggerate both the
Malice, and the cruel Predatory War lately made by the King of Scotland;
That that King, being in Amity with him, and no ways provoked, should so
burn in hatred towards him, as to drink of the Lees and Dregs of
Perkin’s Intoxication, who was every where else detected and discarded.
And that when he perceived it was out of his reach, to do the King any
hurt, he had turned his Arms upon unarmed and unprovided people, to
spoil only and depopulate, contrary to the Laws both of War and Peace:
Concluding, that he could neither with Honour, nor with the safety of
his People, to whom he did owe Protection, let pass these wrongs
unrevenged. The Parliament understood him well, and gave him a Subsidy,
limited to the summ of one hundred and twenty thousand Pounds, besides
two Fifteens. For his Wars were always to him as a Mine of Treasure, of
a strange kind of Ore; Iron at the top, and Gold and Silver at the
bottom. At this Parliament (for that there had been so much time spent
in making Laws the year before; and for that it was called purposely in
respect of the Scottish War, there were no Laws made to be remembred.
Only there passed a Law, at the Suit of the Merchant-Adventurers of
England, against the Merchant-Adventurers of London, for Monopolizing
and exacting upon the Trade: which it seemeth they did, a little to save
themselves, after the hard time they had sustained by want of Trade. But
those Innovations were taken away by Parliament.</p>
<p>But it was fatal to the King, to fight for his Money. And though he
avoided to fight with Enemies abroad, yet he was still enforced to fight
for it with Rebels at home. For no sooner began the Subsidie to be
levied in Cornwal, but the people there began to grudge and murmur. The
Cornish being a race of men, stout of stomach, mighty of body and limb,
and that lived hardly in a barren Countrey, and many of them could (for
a need) live under ground, that were Tinners; they muttered extremely,
that it was a thing not to be suffered, that for a little stir of the
Scots, soon blown over, they should be thus grinded to Powder with
Payments: And said, it was for them to pay, that had too much, and lived
idly. But they would eat the bread they got with the sweat of their
brows, and no man should take it from them. And as in the Tides of
People once up, there want not commonly stirting Winds to make them more
rough: So this People did light upon two Ring-leaders, or Captains of
the Rout. The one was one Michael Joseph, a Black-smith or Farrier of
Bodmin; a notable talking Fellow, and no less desirous to be talked of.
The other was Thomas Flammocke, a Lawyer; who, by telling his neighbours
commonly upon any occasion, that the Law was on their side, had gotten
great sway amongst them. This man talked learnedly, and as if he could
tell how to make a Rebellion, and never break the Peace. He told the
people, that Subsidies were not to be granted nor levied in this case;
that is, for Wars of Scotland, (for that the Law had provided another
course, by service of Escuage, for those Journies,) much less when all
was quiet, and War was made but a Pretence to poll and pill the People:
And therefore that it was good, they should not stand now like sheep
before the Shearers, but put on Harness, and take Weapons in their
hands: Yet to do no creature hurt; but go and deliver the King a Strong
Petition, for the laying down of those grievous Payments, and for the
punishment of those that had given him that Counsel; to make others
beware how they did the like in time to come: And said, for his part he
did not see how they could do the duty of true English-men, and good
Liege-men, except they did deliver the King from such wicked Ones that
would destroy both Him and the Countrey. Their aim was at Archbishop
Morton, and Sir Reginald Bray, who were the King’s Skreens in this
Envy.</p>
<p>After that these two, Flammocke and the Black-smith, had, by joynt
and several Pratings, found tokens of consent in the Multitude, they
offered themselves to lead them, until they should hear of better men,
to be their Leaders; which they said would be ere long: Telling them
further, that they would be but their servants, and first in every
danger; but doubted not but to make both the West-end and East-end of
England to meet in so good a Quarrel; and that all (rightly understood)
was but for the King’s service. The People, upon these seditious
Instigations, did arm (most of them with Bows, and Arrows, and Bills,
and such other Weapons of rude and Countrey People) and forthwith under
the Command of their Leaders (which in such cases is ever at pleasure)
marched out of Cornwal, through Devonshire, unto Taunton in
Somersetshire, without any slaughter, violence, or spoil of the
Countrey. At Taunton they killed, in fury, an officious and eager
Commissioner for the Subsidie, whom they called the Provoct of Perin.
Thence they marched to Wells: where the Lord Audley (with whom their
Leaders had; before, some secret Intelligence) a Noble-man of an ancient
Family, but unquiet and popular, and aspiring to Ruine, came-in to them,
and was by them (with great gladness and cries of Joy) accepted as their
General; they being now proud, that they were led by a Noble-man. The
Lord Audley led them on from Wells to Salisbury, and from Salisbury to
Winchester. Thence the foolish people, who (in effect) led their
Leaders, had a mind to be led into Kent; fancying, that the people there
would joyn with them, contrary to all reason or judgment; considering,
the Kentish-men had shewed great Loyalty and Affection to the King so
lately before. But the rude People had heard Flammock say, that Kent was
never Conquered, and that they were the freest People of England. And,
upon these vain Noises, they looked for great matters at their hands, in
a cause which they conceited to be for the liberty of the Subject. But
when they were come into Kent, the Countrey was so well setled, both by
the King’s late kind usage towards them, and by the credit and power of
the Earl of Kent, the Lord Abergaveny, and the Lord Cobham, as neither
Gentleman nor Yeoman came-in to their aid; which did much damp and
dismay many of the simpler sort: Insomuch, as divers of them did
secretly flie from the Army, and went home. But the sturdier sort, and
those that were most engaged, stood by it, and rather waxed Proud, than
failed in Hopes and Courage. For as it did somewhat appall them, that
the people came not in to them; so it did no less encourage them, that
the King’s Forces had not set upon them, having marched from the West
unto the East of England. Wherefore they kept on their way, and encamped
upon Black-heath, between Greenwich and Eltham; threatning either to bid
Battel to the King, (for now the Seas went higher than to Morton, and
Bray) or to take London within his view, imagining with themselves,
there to find no less Fear, than Wealth.</p>
<p>But to return to the King. When first he heard of this Commotion of
the Cornish-men occasioned by the Subsidie, he was much troubled
therewith: Not for it self, but in regard of the Concurrence of other
Dangers, that did hang over him at that time. For he doubted lest a War
from Scotland, a Rebellion from Cornwal, and the Practices and
Conspiracies of Perkin and his Partakers, would come upon him at once;
Knowing well, that it was a dangerous Triplicity to a Monarchy, to have
the Arms of a Foreiner, the Discontents of Subjects, and the Title of a
Pretender, to meet. Nevertheless, the Occasion took him in some part
well provided. For as soon as the Parliament had broken up, the King had
presently raised a puissant Army, to war upon Scotland. And King James
of Scotland likewise, on his part, had made great preparations either
for defence, or for new assailing of England. But as for the King’s
Forces, they were not only in preparation, but in readiness presently to
set forth, under the Conduct of Dawbeney, the Lord Chamberlain. But as
soon as the King understood of the Rebellion of Cornwal, he stayed those
Forces, retaining them for his own service and safety. But therewithal
he dispatched the Earl of Surrey into the North, for the defence and
strength of those parts, in case the Scots should stir. But for the
course he held towards the Rebels, it was utterly differing from his
former custom, and practice; which was ever full of forwardness and
celerity, to make head against them, or to set upon them as soon as ever
they were in Action. This he was wont to do. But now, besides that he
was attempered by Years, and less in love with Dangers, by the continued
Fruition of a Crown; it was a time when the various appearance to his
Thoughts of Perils of several Natures, and from divers Parts, did make
him judge it his best and surest way, to keep his Strength together, in
the Seat and Centre of his Kingdom. According to the ancient Indian
Emblem; in such a swelling Season, To hold the hand upon the middle of
the Bladder, that no side might rise. Besides, there was no necessity
put upon him, to alter this Counsel. For neither did the Rebels spoil
the Countrey; in which case it had been dishonour to abandon his People:
Neither on the other side, did their Forces gather or increase, which
might hasten him to precipitate and assail them, before they grew too
strong. And lastly, both Reason of Estate and War seemed to agree with
this course; For that Insurrections of base People are commonly more
furious in their Beginnings. And by this means also he had them the more
at Vantage, being tired and harrassed with a long march; and more at
Mercy, being cut off far from their Countrey, and therefore not able by
any sudden flight to get to Retrait, and to renew the Troubles.</p>
<p>When therefore the Rebels were encamped on Black-heath, upon the
Hill, whence they might behold the City of London, and the fair Valley
about it: the King knowing well, that it stood him upon, by how much the
more he had hitherto protracted the time in not encountring them, by so
much the sooner to dispatch with them, that it might appear to have been
no Coldness in foreslowing, but Wisdom in choosing his time; resolved
with all speed to assail them, and yet with that Providence, and Surety,
as should leave little to Venture or Fortune. And having very great and
puissant Forces about him, the better to master all Events and
Accidents, he divided them into three parts. The first was led by the
Earl of Oxford in chief, assisted by the Earls of Essex and Suffolk.
These Noble-men were appointed, with some Cornets of Horses and Bands of
Foot, and good store of Artillery wheeling about to put themselves
beyond the Hill, where the Rebels were encamped; and to beset all the
skirts and descents thereof, except those that lay towards London;
whereby to have these Wild Beasts (as it were) in a Toyl. The second
part of his Forces (which were those that were to be most in Action, and
upon which he relyed most for the Fortune of the Day) he did assign to
be led by the Lord Chamberlain, who was appointed to set upon the Rebels
in Front, from that side which is toward London. The third part of his
Forces (being likewise great and brave Forces) he retained about
himself, to be ready, upon all Events, to restore the Fight, or
consummate the Victory; and mean while, to secure the City. And for that
purpose he encamped in Person in St. George’s Fields, putting himself
between the City and the Rebels. But the City of London (specially at
the first) upon the near encamping of the Rebels, was in great Tumult:
As it useth to be with wealthy and populous Cities, (especially those,
which, for greatness and fortune, are Queens of their Regions) who
seldom see out of their Windows, or from their Towers, an Army of
Enemies. But that which troubled them most, was the conceit, that they
dealt with a Rout of People, with whom there was no Composition, or
Condition, or orderly Treating, if need were, but likely to be bent
altogether upon Rapine and Spoil. And although they had heard that the
Rebels had behaved themselves quietly and modestly, by the way as they
went; yet they doubted much, that would not last, but rather make them
more hungry, and more in appetire, to fall upon spoil in the end.
Wherefore there was great running to and fro of People, some to the
Gates, some to the Walls, some to the Water ; giving themselves Alarms,
and Panick fears continually. Nevertheless, both Tate the Lord Mayor,
and Shaw, and Haddon, the Sheriffs, did their parts stoutly and well, in
arming and ordering the People. And the King likewise did adjoyn some
Captains of experience in the Wars, to advise and assist the Citizens.
But soon aften, when they understood that the King had so ordered the
matter, that the Rebels must win three Battels, before they could
approach the City, and that he had put his own Person between the Rebels
and them, and that the great care was rather how to impound the Rebels,
that none of them might escape, than that any doubt was made to vanquish
them; they grew to be quiet and out of fear. The rather, for the
confidence they reposed (which was not small) in the three Leaders,
Oxford, Essex, and Dawbency; all, men famed and loved amongst the
People. As for Jasper Duke of Bedford, whom the King used to employ with
the first in his Wars, he was then sick, and dyed soon after.</p>
<p>It was the two and twentieth of June, and a Saturday (which was the
day of the week the King fancied) when the Battel was fought; though the
King had, by all the Art he could devise; given out a false Day, as if
he prepared to give the Rebels Battel on the Monday following, the
better to find them unprovided, and in disarray. The Lords, that were
appointed to circle the Hill, had some days before planted themselves
(as at the Receipt) in places convenient. In the afternoon, towards the
decline of the day, (which was done, the better to keep the Rebels in
opinion that they should not fight that day) the Lord Dawbeney marched
on towards them, and first beat some Troops of them from Detford-bridge,
where they fought manfully: But being in no great number were soon
driven back, and fled up to their main Army upon the Hill. The Army, at
that time hearing of the approach of the King’s Forces, were putting
themselves in Array, not without much Confusion. But neither had they
placed upon the first high-ground towards the Bridge, any Forces to
second the Troops below, that kept the Bridge; neither had they brought
forwards their Main-Battel (which stood in array far into the Heath)
near to the ascent of the Hill. So that the Earl with his Forces mounted
the Hill, and recovered the Plain, without resistance. The Lord Dawbeney
charged them with great fury; Insomuch, as it had like (by accident) to
have brandled the Fortune of the Day. For, by inconsiderate Forwardness
in fighting in the head of his Troops, he was taken by the Rebels; but,
immediately rescued, and delivered. The Rebels maintained the Fight for
a small time, and for their Persons shewed no want of courage: but being
ill armed, and ill led, and without Horse or , they were with no great
difficulty cut in pieces, and put to flight. And for their three
Leaders; the Lord Audley, the Black-smith, and Flammocke, (as, commonly
the Captains of Commotions are but half-couraged Men) suffered
themselves to be taken alive. The number slain on the Rebels part, were
some two thousand men, their Army amounting (as it is said) unto the
number of sixteen thousand. The rest were (in effect) all taken; for
that the Hill, as was said, was encompassed with the King’s Forces round
about. On the King’s part there dyed about three hundred; most of them
shot with Arrows, which were reported to be of the length of a
Taylor’s-yard: So strong and mighty a Bow the Cornish-men were said to
draw.</p>
<p>The Victory thus obtained, the King created divers Bannerets, as well
upon Black-heath, where his Lieutenant had won the Field (whither he
rode in Person to perform the said Creation) as in St. George’s Fields,
where his own person had been encamped. And for matter of Liberality, he
did (by open Edict) give the goods of all the Prisoners, unto those that
had taken them; either to take them in Kind, or compound for them as
they could. After matter of Honour and Liberality, followed matter of
Severity and Execution. The Lord Audley was led from Newgate to
Tower-hill, in a Paper-Coat painted with his own Arms; the Arms
reversed, the Coat torn, and he at Tower-hill beheaded. Flammocke, and
the Black-smith were hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn; The
Black-smith taking pleasure upon the Hurdle (as it seemeth by words that
he uttered) to think that he should be famous in after-times. The King
was once in mind to have sent down Flammocke, and the Black-smith, to
have been executed in Cornwal, for the more terrour. But, being
advertised, that the Countrey was yet unquiet and boyling, he thought
better not to irritate the People further. All the rest were pardoned by
Proclamation, and to take out their Pardons under Seal, as many as
would: So that, more than the blood drawn in the Field, the King did
satisfie himself with the lives of only three Offenders, for the
expiation of this great Rebellion.</p>
<p>It was a strange thing, to observe the variety and inequality of the
King’s Executions and Pardons. And a man would think it, at the first, a
kind of Lottery or Chance. But, looking into it more nearly, one shall
find there was reason for it, much more perhaps than (after so long a
distance of time) we can now discern. In the Kentish Commotion (which
was but an handful of men) there were executed to the number of one
hundred and fifty; and, in this so mighty a Rebellion, but three:
Whether it were, that the King put to accompt the men that were slain in
the field; or that he was not willing to be severe in a popular cause;
or that the harmless behaviour of this People (that came from the West
of England, to the East, without mischief almost, or spoil of the
Countrey) did somewhat mollifie him, and move him to compassion; or
lastly, that he made a great difference between People, that did rebel
upon Wantonness, and them that did rebel upon Want.</p>
<p>After the Cornish-men were defeated, there came from Calioe to the
King, an honourable Ambassage from the French King, which had arrived at
Calice a Month before, and there was stayed in respect of the troubles;
but honourably entertained and defrayed.</p>
<p>The King, at their first coming, sent unto them, and prayed them to
have patience, till a little Smoak, that was raised in his Countrey,
were over, which would soon be: Slighting (as his manner was) that
openly, which nevertheless he intended seriously.</p>
<p>This Ambassage concerned no great Affair; but only the Prolongation
of Days for payment of Moneys, and some other Particulars of the
Frontiers. And it was (indeed) but a wooing Ambassage; with good
respects to entertain the King in good affection: but nothing was done,
or handled, to the derogation of the King’s late Treaty with the
Italians.</p>
<p>But, during the time that the Cornish-men were in their march towards
London, the King of Scotland (well advertised of all that passed, and
knowing himself sure of War from England, whensoever those Stirs were
appeased) neglected not his opportunity; But, thinking the King had his
hands full, entred the Frontiers of England again with an Army, and
besieged the Castle of Norham in Person, with part of his Forces,
sending the rest to forrage the Countrey. But Fox, Bishop of Duresm (a
wise man, and one that could see through the Present, to the Future)
doubting as much before, had caused his Castle of Norham to be strongly
fortified, and furnished, with all kind of Munition: And had manned it
likewise, with a very great number of tall Soldiers, more than for the
proportion of the Castle; reckoning rather upon a sharp Assault, than a
long Siege. And for the Countrey likewise, he had caused the people
withdraw their Cattel and Goods into Fact Places, that were not of easie
approach; and sent in post to the Earl of Surrey (who was not far off,
in Yorkshire) to come in diligence to the Succour. So as the Scottish
King both failed of doing good upon the Castle, and his men had but a
catching Harvest of their Spoils. And when he understood, that the Earl
of Surrey was coming on with great Forces, he returned back into
Scotland. The Earl finding the Castle freed, and the Enemy retired,
pursued with all into Scotland; hoping to have overtaken the Scottish
King, and to have given him Battel; But not attaining him in time, sate
down before the Castle of Aton (one of the strongest places, then
esteemed, between Berwick and Edenburgh) which in a small time he took.
And soon after, the Scottish King retiring further into his Countrey,
and the weather being extraordinary foul and stormy, the Earl returned
into England. So that the Expeditions on both parts were (in effect) but
a Castle taken, and a Castle distressed; not answerable to the puissance
of the Forces, nor to the heat of the Quarrel, nor to the greatness of
the Expectation.</p>
<p>Amongst these Troubles, both Civil and External, came into England
from Spain Peter Hialas, some call him Elias, (surely he was the fore
runner of the good Hap, that we enjoy at this day. For his Ambassage set
the Truce between England and Scotland; the Truce drew on the Peace; the
Peace the Marriage; and the Marriage the Union of the Kingdoms) a man of
great Wisdom, and (as those times were) not unlearned; sent from
Ferdinando and Isabella Kings of Spain unto the King, to treat a
Marriage between Catherine their second Daughter, and Prince Arthur.
This Treaty was by him set in a very good way, and almost brought to
perfection. But it so fell out by the way, that upon some Conference
which he had with the King touching this business, the King (who had a
great dexterity in getting suddenly into the bosom of Ambassadors of
forein Princes, if he liked the men; Insomuch as he would many times
communicate with them of his own affairs; yea and employ them in his
service) fell into speech and discourse incidently, concerning the
ending the Debates and differences with Scotland. For the King naturally
did not love the barren Wars with Scotland, though he made his profit of
the Noise of them. And he wanted not in the Council of Scotland those
that would advise their King to meet him at the half-way, and to give
over the War with England; pretending to be good Patriots, but indeed
favouring the affairs of the King. Only his heart was too great to begin
with Scotland for the motion of Peace. On the other side, he had met
with an Allie of Ferdinando of Arragon, as fit for his turn as could be.
For after that King Ferdinando had; upon assured confidence of the
Marriage to succeed, taken upon him the person of a Fraternal Allie to
the King, he would not let (in a Spanish gravity) to counsel the King in
his own affairs. And the King on his part not being wanting to himself,
but making use of every man’s humours, made his advantage of this in
such things as he thought either not decent, or not pleasant to proceed
from himself; putting them off, as done by the Counsel of Ferdinando.
Wherefore he was content that Hialas (as in a matter moved and advised
from Hialas himself) should go into Scotland, to treat of a Concord
between the two Kings. Hialas took it upon him: and coming to the
Scottish King, after he had with much Art brought King James to hearken
to the more safe and quiet Counsels, wrote unto the King, that he hoped
that Peace would with no great difficulty cement and close, if he would
send some wise and temperate Counsellor of his own, that might treat of
the Conditions. Whereupon the King directed Bishop Fox (who at that time
was at his Castle of Norham) to confer with Hialas, and they both to
treat with some Commissioners, deputed from the Scottish King. The
Commissioners on both sides met. But after much dispute upon the
Articles and Conditions of Peace, propounded upon either part, they
could not conclude a Peace. The chief Impediments thereof was the demand
of the King, to have Perkin delivered into his hands, as a reproach to
all Kings, and a person not protected by the Law of Nations. The King of
Scotland, on the other side, peremptorily denied so to do; saying, That
he (for his part) was no competent Judge of Perkin’s Title: But that he
had received him as a Suppliant, protected him as a person fled for
Refuge, espoused him with his Kinswoman, and aided him with his Arms,
upon the belief that he was a Prince; And therefore that he could not
now with his Honour so unrip, and (in a sort) put a Lye upon all that he
had said and done before, as to deliver him up to his Enemies. The
Bishop likewise (who had certain proud instructions from the King, at
the least in the Front, though there were a pliant clause at the Foot,
that remitted all to the Bishop’s discretion, and required him by no
means to break off in ill terms) after that he had failed to obtain the
delivery of Perkin, did move a second point of his Instructions; which
was, that the Scottish King would give the King an Enterview in Person
at Newcastle. But this being reported to the Scottish King, his answer
was, That he meant to treat a Peace, and not to go a begging for it. The
Bishop also (according to another Article of his Instructions) demanded
Restitution of the Spoils taken by the Scottish, or Damages for the
same. But the Scottish Commissioners answered; That that was but as
Water spilt upon the ground, which could not be gotten up again; and
that the King’s People were better able to bear the loss, than their
Master to it. But in the end (as persons capable of Reason) on both
sides they made a kind of Recess, than a Breach of Treaty, and concluded
upon a Truce for some Months following. But the King of Scotland, though
he would not formally retract his judgement of Perkin, wherein he had
engaged himself so far; yet in his private opinion, upon often speech
with the English-men, and divers other advertisements, began to suspect
him for a Counterfeit. Wherefore in a Noble fashion he called him unto
him, and recounted the benefits and favours that he had done him, in
making him his Allie, and in provoking a Mighty and Opulent King by an
Offensive War in his Quarrel, for the space of two years together. Nay
more; that he had refused an Honourable Peace, whereof he had a fair
Offer, if he would have delivered him; and that to keep his promise with
him, he had deeply offended both his Nobles and People, whom he might
not hold in any long discontent. And therefore required him to think of
his own Fortunes, and to choose out some fitter place for his Exile:
Telling him withal, that he could not say, but the English had forsaken
him before the Scottish, for that upon two several Tryals, none had
declared themselves on his side. But nevertheless he would make good
what he said to him at his first receiving, which was, That he should
not repent him, for putting himself into his hands; For that he would
not cast him off, but help him with Shipping and means, to transport him
where he should desire. Perkin, not descending at all from his
Stage-like Greatness, answered the King in few words; That he saw his
time was not yet come; But whatsoever his Fortunes were, he should both
think and speak Honour of the King. Taking his leave, he would not think
on Flanders, doubting it was but hollow ground for him, since the Treaty
of the Arch-Duke concluded the year before; but took his Lady, and such
followers as would not leave him, and sailed over into Ireland.</p>
<p>This Twelfth year of the King, a little before this time, Pope
Alexander (who loved best those Princes that were furthest off, and with
whom he had least to do) taking very thankfully the King’s late entrance
into League, for the defence of Italy, did remunerate him with an
Hallowed Sword, and Cap-of-Maintenance sent by his Nuncio. Pope Innocent
had done the like, but it was not received in that Glory. For the King
appointed the Mayor and his Brethren to meet the Pope’s Orator at
London-Bridge, and all the Streets between the Bridge-foot and the
Palace of St. Pauls (where the King then lay) were garnished with the
Citizens, standing in their Liveries. And the morrow after (being
All-hallows day) the King, attended with many of his Prelates, Nobles,
and principal Courtiers, went in Procession to St. Pauls, and the Cap
and Sword were born before him. And after the Procession, the King
himself remaining seated in the Choir, the Lord Archbishop upon the
greece of the Choir, made a long Oration, setting forth the greatness
and Eminency of that Honour, which the Pope (in these Ornaments and
Ensigns of Benediction) had done the King, and how rarely, and upon what
high deserts they used to be bestowed. And then recited the Kings
principal Acts and Merits, which had made him appear worthy in the eyes
of his Holiness of this great Honour.</p>
<p>All this while the Rebellion of Cornwal (whereof we have spoken)
seemed to have no relation to Perkin; save that perhaps Perkin’s
Proclamation had stricken upon the right Vein, in promising to lay down
Exactions and Payments, and so had made them now and then have a kind
thought on Perkin. But now these Bubbles by much stirring began to meet,
as they use to do upon the top of Water. The King’s lenity (by that time
the Cornish Rebels, who were taken and pardoned, and (as it was said)
many of them sold by them that had taken them, for twelve pence and two
shillings a piece, were come down into their Countrey) had rather
imboldened them, than reclaimed them: Insomuch, as they stuck not to say
to their Neighbours and Countrey-men, that The King did well to pardon
them, for that he knew he shouldl eave few Subjects in England, if he
hanged all that were of their mind: And began whetting and inciting one
another to renew the Commotion. Some of the subtilest of them, hearing
of Perkin’s being in Ireland, found means to send to him, to let him
know, that if he would come over to them, they would serve him.</p>
<p>When Perkin heard this News, he began to take heart again, and
advised upon it with his Council, which were principally three; Herne a
Mercer, that had fled for Debt; Skelton a Taylor, and Astley a
Scrivener: for Secretary Frion was gone. These told him, that he was
mightily overseen, both when he went into Kent, and when he went into
Scotland. The one being a place so near London, and under the King’s
Nose; and the other a Nation so distasted with the People of England,
that if they had loved him never so well, yet they could never have
taken his part in that Company. But if he had been so happy, as to have
been in Cornwal at the first, when the People began to take Arms there,
he had been crowned at Westminster before this time. For, these Kings
(as he had now experience) would sell poor Princes for shooes: But he
must rely wholly upon People; and therefore advised him to sail over
with all possible speed into Cornwal. Which, accordingly he did; having
in his Company four small Barques, with some six score or seven score
fighting men. He arrived in September at Whitsand-Bay; and forthwith
came to Bodmin, the Black-smith’s Town: Where there assembled unto him
to the number of three thousand men of the rude People. There he set
forth a new Proclamation, stroaking the People with fair Promises, and
humouring them with Invectives against the King and his Government. And;
as it fareth with Smoak, that never loseth it self till it be at the
highest; he did now before his end raise his Stile, intituling himself
no more Richard, Duke of York; but Richard the Fourth, King of England.
His Council advised him, by all means, to make himself Master of some
good walled Town; as well to make his Men find the sweetness of rich
Spoils, and to allure to him all loose and lost People; by like hopes of
Booty; as to be a sure Retrait to his Forces, in case they should have
any ill Day, or unlucky Chance in the Field. Wherefore they took heart
to them, and went on, and besieged the City of Exceter, the principal
Town for Strength and Wealth in those Parts.</p>
<p>When they were come before Exceter, they forbare to use any Force at
the first; but made continual Shouts and Out-cries, to terrifie the
Inhabitants. They did likewise in divers places call and talk to them
from under the Walls, to joyn with them, and be of their Party; telling
them, that the King would make them another London, if they would be the
first Town that should acknowledge him. But they had not the wit to send
to them, in any orderly fashion, Agents, or chosen Men, to tempt them,
and to treat with them. The Citizens on their part shewed themselves
stout and loyal Subjects. Neither was there so much as any Tumult or
Division amongst them: but all prepared themselves for a valiant
Defence, and making good the Town. For, well they saw, that the Rebels
were of no such Number or Power, that they needed to fear them as yet:
and well they hoped, that before their Numbers increased, the King’s
Succours would come-in. And, howsoever, they thought it the extremest of
Evils, to put themselves at the mercy of those hungry and disorderly
People. Wherefore, setting all things in good order within the Town,
they nevertheless let down with Cords, from several parts of the Walls
privily, several Messengers (that, if one came to mischance, another
might pass-on) which should advertise the King of the State of the Town,
and implore his ayd. Perkin also doubted, that Succours would come ere
long; and therefore resolved to use his utmost Force to assault the
Town: And for that purpose, having mounted Scaling-Ladders in divers
places upon the Walls, made at the same instant an Attempt to force one
of the Gates. But, having no Artillery nor Engins, and finding that he
could do no good by ramming with Logs of Timber, nor by the use of Iron
Bars and Iron Crows, and such other means at hand, he had no way left
him, but to set one of the Gates on fire: which he did. But the
Citizens, well perceiving the Danger, before the Gate could be fully
consumed, blocked up the Gate, and some space about it on the inside,
with Fagots and other Fuel: which they likewise set on fire, and so
repulsed fire with fire; And, in the mean time, raised up Rampiers of
earth, and cast up deep Trenches, to serve instead of Wall and Gate. And
for the Escalada’s, they had so bad success, as the Rebels were driven
from the Walls, with the loss of two hundred men.</p>
<p>The King, when he heard of Perkin’s Siege of Exceter, made sport with
it, and said to them that were about him, that The King of Rake-hells
was landed in the West, and that he hoped now to have the honour to see
him, which he could never yet do. And it appeared plainly to those that
were about the King, that he was indeed much joyed with the News of
Perkin’s being on English ground, where he could have no retreat by
Land; thinking now, that he should be cured of those privy Stitches,
which he had long had about his Heart, and had sometimes broken his
Sleeps in the midst of all his felicity. And, to set all mens hearts on
fire, he did by all possible means let it appear, that those, who should
now do him service to make an end of these troubles, should be no less
accepted of him, than he that came upon the Eleventh Hour, and had the
whole Wages of the Day. Therefore now (like the end of a Play) a great
number came upon the Stage at once. He sent the Lord Chamberlain, and
the Lord Brook, and Sir Rice ap Thomas, with expedite Forces to speed to
Exceter, to the Rescue of the Town, and to spread the Fame of his own
following in Person with a Royal Army. The Earl of Devonshire, and his
Son, with the Caroes, and the Fulfords, and other principal Persons of
Devonshire (uncalled from the Court, but hearing that the King’s heart
was so much bent upon this Service) made haste with Troops, that they
had raised, to be the first that should succour the City of Exceter, and
prevent the King’s Succours. The Duke of Buckingham likewise, with many
brave Gentlemen, put themselves in Arms, not staying either the King’s,
or the Lord Chamberlain’s coming on, but making a Body of Forces of
themselves, the more to indear their merit, signifying to the King their
readiness, and desiring to know his pleasure. So that according to the
Proverb, In the coming down, every Saint did help.</p>
<p>Perkin, hearing this Thunder of Arms, and Preparations against him
from so many Parts, raised his Siege, and marched to Taunton; beginning
already to squint one eye upon the Crown, and another upon the
Sanctuary: Though the Cornish-men were become, like Metal often fired
and quenched, churlish, and that would sooner break than bow; swearing
and vowing not to leave him, till the uttermost drop of their blood were
spilt. He was at his rising from Exceter between six and seven thousand
strong, many having come unto him, after he was set before Exceter, upon
fame of so great an Enterprize, and to partake of the Spoil; though upon
the raising of his Siege, some did slip away. When he was come near
Taunton, he dissembled all fear, and seemed all the day to use diligence
in preparing all things ready to fight. But about midnight, he fled with
threescore Horse to Bewley in the New-Forest, where he and divers of his
Company registred themselves Sanctuary-men, leaving his Cornish-men to
the Four Winds; But yet thereby easing them of their Vow, and using his
wonted Compassion, Not to be by when his Subjects blood should be spilt.
The King, as soon as he heard of Perkin’s Flight, sent presently five
hundred Horse to pursue and apprehend him, before he should get either
to the Sea, or to that same little Island, called a Sanctuary. But they
came too late for the latter of these. Therefore all they could do, was
to beset the Sanctuary, and to maintain a strong Watch about it, till
the King’s pleasure were further known. As for the rest of the Rebels,
they (being destituted of their head) without stroke stricken, submitted
themselves unto the King’s Mercy. And the King, who commonly drew Blood
(as Physicians do) rather to save life, than to spill it, and was never
Cruel, when he was Secure; now he saw the danger was past, pardoned them
all in the end, except some few desperate persons which he reserved to
be Executed, the better to set off his Mercy towards the rest. There
were also sent with all speed some Horse to St. Michael’s-Mount in
Cornwal, where the Lady Catherine Gordon was left by her Husband, whom
in all fortunes she entirely loved; adding the virtues of a Wife, to the
virtues of her Sex. The King sent in the greater diligence, not knowing
whether she might be with Child; whereby the business would not have
ended in Perkin’s person. When she was brought to the King, it was
commonly said, that the King received her not only with Compassion, but
with Affection; Pity giving more Impression to her excellent Beauty.
Wherefore comforting her (to serve as well his Eye as his Fame) he sent
her to his Queen, to remain with her; giving her very honourable
Allowance for the suport of her Estate: which she enjoyed both during
the King’s life, and many years after. The name of the White-Rose (which
had been given to her Husband’s False-Title) was continued in common
speech to her true Beauty.</p>
<p>The King went forward on his Journey, and made a joyful entrance into
Exceter, where he gave the Citizens great commendations and thanks; and
taking the Sword he wore, from his side, he gave it to the Mayor, and
commanded it should be ever after carried before him. There also he
caused to be executed some of the Ring-leaders of the Cornish-men, in
sacrifice to the Citizens, whom they had put in fear, and trouble. At
Exceter the King consulted with his Council, whether he should offer
life to Perkin, if he would quit the Sanctuary, and voluntarily submit
himself. The Council were divided in opinion. Some advised the King to
take him out of Sanctuary per-force, and to put him to death, as in a
case of Necessity, which in it self dispenseth with Consecrated Places
and things. Wherein they doubted not also, but the King should find the
Pope tractable to ratifie his Deed, either by Declaration, or (at least)
by Indulgence. Others were of opinion (since all was now safe, and no
further hurt could be done) that it was not worth the exposing of the
King to new Scandal and Envy. A third sort fell upon the opinion that it
was not possible for the King ever, either to satisfie the World well
touching the Imposture, or to learn out the bottom of the Conspiracy,
except by promise of Life and Pardon, and other fair means, he should
get Perkin into his hands. But they did all in their Preambles much
bemoan the King’s Case, with a kind of Indignation at his Fortune; That
a Prince of his high Wisdom and Virtue, should have been so long, and so
oft exercised and vexed with Idols. But the King said; that it was the
Vexation of God Almighty himself, to be vexed with Idols, and therefore
that that was not to trouble any of his Friends. And that for himself,
he always despised them; but was grieved that they had put his People to
such trouble and misery. But (in Concusion) he leaned to the third
opinion, and so sent some to deal with Perkin. Who seeing himself
Prisoner, and destitute of all hopes, having tryed Princes and People,
Great and Small, and found all either false, faint or unfortunate, did
gladly accept of the Condition. The King did also (while he was at
Exceter) appoint the Lord Darcy, and others, Commissioners, for the
fining of all such, as were of any value, or had any hand or partaking
in the ayd or comfort of Perkin or the Cornish-men, either in the Field
or in the Flight.</p>
<p>These Commissioners proceeded with such strictness and severity, as
did much obscure the King’s mercy in sparing of Blood, with the bleeding
of so much Treasure. Perkin was brought unto the King’s Court, but not
to the King’s presence; though the King (to satisfie his Curiosity) saw
him sometimes out of a window, or in passage. He was in shew at liberty,
but guarded with all care and watch that was possible, and willed to
follow the King to London. But from his first appearance upon the Stage,
in his new person of a Sycophant or Jugler, instead of his former person
of a Prince, all men may think how he was exposed to the derision, not
only of the Courtiers, but also of the Common-People who flocked about
him as he went along; that one might know a-far-off, where the Owl was
by the Flight of Birds. Some mocking, some wondering, some cursing, some
prying and picking matter out of his Countenance and Gesture, to talk
of. So that the false Honour and Respects which he had so long enjoyed,
was plentifully repayed in Scorn and Contempt. As soon as he was come to
London, the King gave also the City the solace of this May-Game. For he
was conveyed leisurely on Horse-back (but not in any ignominious
fashion) through Cheapside, and Cornwill, to the Tower; and from thence
back again unto Westminster, with the Churm of a thousand taunts and
reproaches. But to amend the Show, there followed a little distance of
Perkin, an inward Counsellor of his, one that had been SerjeantFarrier
to the King. This Fellow when Perkin took Sanctuary, chose rather to
take an Holy Habit than an Holy Place, and clad himself like an Hermit,
and in that weed wandred about the Countrey, till he was discovered, and
taken. But this Man was bound hand and foot upon the Horse, and came not
back with Perkin, but was left at the Tower, and within few days after
Executed. Soon after, now that Perkin could tell better what himself
was, he was diligently examined; and after his Confession taken, an
Extract was made of such parts of them as were thought fit to be
divulged, which was Printed and dispersed abroad. Wherein the King did
himself no Right. For as there was a laboured Tale of particulars, of
Perkin’s Father, and Mother, and Grandsire, and Grandmother, and Uncles,
and Cousins, by Names and Sirnames, and from what places he travelled up
and down; so there was little or nothing to purpose of any thing
concerning his Designs, or any Practices that had been held with him;
nor the Duchess of Burgundy her self (that all the World did take
knowledge of, as the Person that had put Life and Being into the whole
Business) so much as named or pointed at. So that men missing of that
they looked for, looked about for they knew not what, and were in more
doubt than before. But the King chose rather not to satisfie, than to
kindle Coals. At that time also it did not appear by any new
Examinations or Commitments, that any other Person of quality was
discovered or appeached, though the King’s closeness made that a
DoubtDormant.</p>
<p>About this time, a great Fire in the night time suddenly began at the
King’s Palace of Sheyn, near unto the King’s own Lodgings, whereby a
great part of the building was consumed, with much costly
Houshold-stuff; which gave the King occasion of Building from the ground
that fine Pile of Richmond, which is now standing.</p>
<p>Somewhat before this time also, there fell out a memorable Accident.
There was one Sebastian Gabato, a Venetian, dwelling in Bristow, a man
seen and expert in Cosmography and Navigation. This man seeing the
success, and emulating perhaps the enterprize of Christopherus Columbus
in that fortunate discovery towards the South-west, which had been by
him made some six years before; conceited with himself, that Lands might
likewise be discovered towards the North-west. And surely it may be he
had more firm and pregnant Conjectures of it, than Columbus had of this
at the first. For the two great Islands of the Old and New World, being
(in the shape and making of them) broad towards the North, and pointed
towards the South; it is likely, that the discovery first began where
the Lands did nearest meet. And there had been before that time a
discovery of some Lands, which they took to be Islands, and were indeed
the Continent of America, towards the North-west. And it may be, that
some Relation of this nature coming afterwards to the knowledge of
Columbus, and by him suppressed, (desirous rather to make his Enterprize
the Child of his Science and Fortune, than the Follower of a former
Discovery) did give him better assurance that all was not Sea, from the
West of Europe and Africk unto Asia, than either Seneca’s Prophesie, or
Plato’s Antiquities, or the Nature of the Tides, and Land-winds, and the
like, which were the Conjectures that were given out, whereupon he
should have relyed. Though I am not ignorant, that it was likewise laid
unto the casual and wind-beaten Discovery (a little before) of a Spanish
Pilot, who dyed in the house of Columbus. But this Gabato bearing the
King in hand, that he would find out an Island endued with rich
Commodities, procured him to man and victual a Ship at Bristow, for the
discovery of that Island; With whom ventured also three small Ships of
London-Merchants, fraught with some gross and sleight Wares, fit for
Commerce with barbarous people. He sayled (as he affirmed at his return,
and made a Card thereof) very far Westwards, with a Quarter of the
North, on the North-side of Tierra de Labrador, until he came to the
Latitude of sixty seven Degrees and an half, finding the Seas still
open. It is certain also, that the King’s Fortune had a tender of that
great Empire of the West-Indies. Neither was it a Refusal on the King’s
part, but a Delay by accident, that put by so great an Acquest. For
Christopherus Columbus refused by the King of Portugal (who would not
embrace at once both East and West) employed his Brother Bartholomaus
Columbus unto King Henry, to negotiate for his Discovery. And it so
fortuned, that he was taken by Pirates at Sea, by which accidental
impediment he was long ere he came to the King. So long, that before he
had obtained a Capitulation with the King for his Brother; the
Enterprize by him was atchieved, and so the West-Indies by Providence
were then reserved for the Crown of Castilia. Yet this sharpened the
King so, that not only in this Voyage, but again in the Sixteenth year
of his Reign, and likewise in the Eighteenth thereof, he granted forth
new Commissions, for the Discovery and investing of unknown Lands.</p>
<p>In this Fourteenth year also (by God’s wonderful providence, that
boweth things unto his will, and hangeth great Weights upon small Wires)
there fell out a trifling and untoward Accident that drew on great and
happy effects. During the Truce with Scotland, there were certain
Scottish young Gentleman, that came into Norham Town, and there made
merry with some of the English of the Town. And having little to do,
went sometimes forth, and would stand looking upon the Castle. Some of
the Garrison of the Castle, observing this their doing twice or thrice,
and having not their minds purged of the late ill blood of Hostility,
either suspected them, or quarrelled them for Spies. Whereupon they fell
at ill Words, and from Words to Blows; so that many were wounded of
either side, and the Scottish-men (being strangers in the Town) had the
worst. In so much as some of them were slain, and the rest made haste
home. The matter being complained on, and often debated before the
Wardens of the Marches of both sides, and no good order taken, the King
of Scotland took it to himself, and being much kindled, sent a Herald to
the King to make Protestation, That if Reparation were not done,
according to the Conditions of the Truce, his King did denounce War. The
King (who had often tryed Fortune, and was inclined to Peace) made
answer; That what had been done, was utterly against his will, and
without his Privity. But if the Garrison-Souldiers had been in fault, he
would see them punished, and the Truce in all points to be preserved.
But this answer seemed to the Scottish King but a delay, to make the
complaint breathe out with time; and therefore it did rather exaspetare
him, than satisfie him. Bishop Fox, understanding from the King, that
the Scottish King was still discontent and impatient, being troubled
that the occasion of breaking of the Truce should grow from his men,
sent many humble and deprecatory Letters to the Scottish King to appease
him. Whereupon King James, mollified by the Bishop’s submiss and
eloquent Letters, wrote back unto him; That though he were in part moved
by his Letters, yet he should not be fully satisfied, except he spake
with him; as well about the compounding of the present differences, as
about other matters that might concern the good of both Kingdoms. The
Bishop advising first with the King, took his Journey for Scotland. The
meeting was at Metross, an Abbey of the Cestercians; where the King then
abode. The King first roundly uttered unto the Bishop his offence
conceived for the insolent Breach of Truce, by his men of Norham Castle.
Whereunto Bishop Fox made such an humble and smooth answer, as it was
like Oyl into the wound, whereby it began to heal. And this was done in
the presence of the King and his Council. After, the King spake with the
Bishop apart, and opened himself unto him, saying; That these temporary
Truces and Peaces were soon made, and soon broken: But that he desired a
straiter Amity with the King of England, discovering his mind; that if
the King would give him in Marriage, the Lady Margaret, his eldest
Daughter, That indeed might be a Knot indissoluble. That he knew well
what Place and Authority the Bishop deservedly had with his Master.
Therefore, if he would take the business to heart, and deal in it
effectually, he doubted not but it would succeed well. The Bishop
answered soberly, that he thought himself rather happy, than worthy, to
be an instrument in such a matter; but would do his best endeavour.
Wherefore the Bishop returning to the King, and giving account what had
passed, and finding the King more than well disposed in it, gave the
King advice; first to proceed to a Conclusion of Peace, and then to go
on with the Treaty of Marriage, by degrees. Hereupon a Peace was
concluded, which was published a little before Christmas in the
Fourteenth year of the King’s Reign to continue for both the Kings
lives, and the overliver of them, and a year after. In this Peace there
was an Article contained, that no English-man should enter into
Scotland, and no Scottish-man into England, without Letters Commendatory
from the Kings of either Nation. This at the first sight might seem a
means to continue a strangeness between the Nations; but it was done, to
lock in the Borderers.</p>
<p>This year there was also born to the King a third Son, who was
christned by the name of Edmund, and shortly after dyed. And much about
the same time came news of the death of Charles the French King; For
whom there were celebrated Solemn and Princely Obsequies.</p>
<p>It was not long, but Perkin (who was made of Quick-silver, which is
hard to hold or imprison) began to stir. For deceiving his Keepers, he
took him to his heels, and made speed to the Seacoasts. But presently
all Corners were laid for him, and such diligent pursuit and search
made, as he was fain to turn back, and get him to the house of Bethleem,
called the Priory of Shyne, (which had the priviledge of a Sanctuary)
and put himself into the hands of the Prior of that Monastery. The Prior
was thought an Holy Man, and much reverenced in those days. He came to
the King, and besought the King for Perkin’s life only, leaving him
otherwise to the Kings discretion. Many about the King were again more
hot than ever, to have the King take him forth, and hang him. But the
King (that had an high stomach, and could not hate any that he despised)
bid, Take him forth, and set the Knave in the stocks. And so promising
the Prior his life, he caused him to be brought forth. And within two or
three days after, upon a fold, set up in the Palace-Court at
Westminster, he was and set in the Stocks, for the whole day. And the
next after, the like was done by him at the Cross in Cheapside in both
places he read his Confession, of which we made before; and was from
Cheapside conveyed and laid up the Tower. Notwithstanding all this, the
King was (as partly touched before) grown to be such a Partner with , as
no body could tell what Actions the one, and what other owned. For it
was believed generally that Perkin was betrayed, and that this Escape
was not without the King’s privity, who had him all the time of his
Flight in a Line; and that the King did this, to pick a Quarrel to him
to put him to death, and to be rid of him at once. But this is not
probable. For that the same Instruments who observed him in his Flight,
might have kept him from getting into Sanctuary.</p>
<p>But it was ordained, that this Winding-Ivy of a Plantagenet, should
kill the true Tree it self. For Perkin, after he had been a while in the
Tower, began to insinuate himself into the favour and kindness of his
Keepers, Servants to the Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir John Digby, being
four in number; Strangways, Blewet, Astwood, and Long-Roger. These
Varlets, with mountains of promises, he sought to corrupt, to obtain his
Escape. But knowing well, that his own Fortunes were made so
contemptible, as he could feed no man’s Hopes (and by Hopes he must
work, for Rewards he had none) he had contrived with himself a vast and
tragical Plot, which was, to draw into his Company Edward Plantagenet
Earl of Warwick, then Prisoner in the Tower; whom the weary life of a
long Imprisonment, and the often and renewing Fears of being put to
Death, had softned to take any impression of counsel for his Liberty.
This young Prince he thought these Servants would look upon, though not
upon himself. And therefore after that by some Message by one or two of
them, he had tasted of the Earl’s consent; it was agreed that these four
should murder their Master the Lieutenant, secretly in the night, and
make their best of such Money and portable Goods of his, as they should
find ready at hand, and get the Keys of the Tower, and presently let
forth Perkin and the Earl. But this Conspiracy was revealed in time,
before it could be executed. And in this again the Opinion of the King’s
great Wisdom did surcharge him with a sinister Fame, that Perkin was but
his Bait, to entrap the Earl of Warwick. And in the very instant while
this Conspiracy was in working (as if that also had been the King’s
industry) it was fatal, that there should break forth a counterfeit Earl
of Warwick, a Cordwainer’s Son, whose name was Ralph Wilford; a young
man, taught and set on by an Augustin Frier, called Patrick. They both
from the parts of Suffolk, came forwards into Kent, where they did not
only privily and underhand give out, that this Wilford was the true Earl
of Warwick; but also the Frier finding some light Credence in the
People, took the boldness in the Pulpit to declare as much, and to
incite the People to come in to his ayd. Whereupon they were both
presently , and the young fellow executed, and the Frier condemned
perpetual Imprisonment. This also hapning so opportunely, to the danger
to the King’s Estate, from the Earl of Warwick, and thereby to colour
the King’s severity that followed, together the madness of the Frier, so
vainly and desperately to divulge a Treason, before it had gotten any
manner of strength; and the saving of the Frier’s life, which
nevertheless was (indeed) but the priviledge of his Order; and the Pity
in the common People (which if it run in a strong Stream, doth ever cast
up Scandal and Envy) made it generally rather talked, than believed,
that all was but the King’s device. But howsoever it were, hereupon
Perkin (that had offended against Grace now the third time) was at the
last proceeded with, and by Commissioners of Oyer and Determiner,
arraigned at Westminster, upon divers Treasons committed and perpetrated
after his coming on land within this Kingdom (for so the Judges advised,
for that he was a Poreiner) and condemned, and a few days after executed
at Tyburn. Where he did again openly read his Confession, and take it
upon his Death to be true. This was the end of this little Cockatrice of
a King, that was able to destroy those that did not espy him first. It
was one of the longest Plays of that kind, that hath been in memory; and
might perhaps have had another end, if he had not met with a King both
wise, stout and fortunate.</p>
<p>As for Perkin’s three Counsellors, they had registred themselves
Sanctuary-men when their Master did. And whether upon Pardon obtained,
or continuance within the Priviledge, they came not to be proceeded
with.</p>
<p>There was executed with Perkin the Mayor of Cork, and his Son, who
had been principal Abettors of his Treasons. And soon after were
likewise condemned eight other Persons, about the TowerConspiracy,
whereof four were the Lieutenant’s men. But of those eight but two were
executed. And immediately after was arraigned before the Earl of Oxford
(then for the time High-Steward of England) the poor Prince the Earl of
Warwick; not for the Attempt to escape simply (for that was not acted;
And besides, the Imprisonment not being for Treason, the Escape by Law
could not be Treason) but for conspiring with Perkin to raise sedition,
and to destroy the King. And the Earl confessing the Indictment had
Judgment, and was shortly after beheaded on Tower-hill.</p>
<p>This was also the end not only of this Noble and Commiserable person
Edward the Earl of Warwick, eldest Son to the Duke of Clarence, but
likewise of the Line-Male of the Plantagenets, which had flourished in
great Royalty and Renown, from the time of the famous King of England
King Henry the Second. Howbeit it was a Race often dipped in their own
Blood. It hath remained since only transplanted into other Names, as
well of the Imperial-Line, as of other Noble Houses. But it was neither
guilt of Crime, nor reason of Estate, that could quench the Envy that
was upon the King for this Execution. So that he thought good to export
it out of the Land, and to lay it upon his new Ferdinando King of Spain.
For these two Kings understanding one another at half a word, so it was,
that there were Letters shewed out of Spain, whereby in the passages
concerning the Treaty of the Marriage, Ferdinando had written to the
King in plain terms, that he saw no assurance of his Succession, as long
as the Earl of Warwick lived; and that he was loth to send his Daughter
to Troubles and Dangers. But hereby, as the King did in some part remove
the Envy from himself; so he did not observe, that he did withal bring a
kind of Malediction and Infausting upon the Marriage, as an ill
Prognostick. Which in event so far proved true, as both Prince Arthur
enjoyed a very small time after the Marriage, and the Lady Katherine,
her self (a sad and a religious woman) long after, when King Henry the
Eighth his resolution of a Divorce from her was first made known to her,
used some words; That she had not offended: but it was a Judgment of
God, for that her former Marriage was made in blood; meaning that of the
Earl of Warwick.</p>
<p>This Fifteenth year of the King there was a great Plague, both in
London, and in divers parts of the Kingdom. Wherefore the King after
often change of Places (whether to avoid the danger of the Sickness, or
to give occasion of an Enterview with the ArchDuke, or both) sayled over
with his Queen to Calice. Upon his coming thither, the Arch-Duke sent an
honourable Ambassage unto him, as well to welcom him into those parts,
as to let him know, that (if it pleased him) he would come and do him
reverence. But it was said withal; That the King might be pleased to
appoint some place, that were out of any Walled Town or Fortress, for
that he had denied the same upon like occasion to the French King. And
though he said, he made a great difference between the two Kings, yet he
would be loth to give a President, that might make it after to be
expected at his hands, by another whom he trusted less. The King
accepted of the Courtesie, and admitted of his Excuse, and appointed the
place to be at St. Peter’s Church without Calice. But withal he did
visit the Arch-Duke with Ambassadors sent from himself, which were the
Lord SaintJohn, and the Secretary; unto whom the Arch-Duke did the
honour, as (going to Mass at St. Omers) to set the Lord Saint-John on
his right hand, and the Secretary on his left, and so to ride between
them to Church. The day appointed for the Enterview, the King went on
Horse-back some distance from St. Peter’s Church, to receive the
Arch-Duke. And upon their approaching, the ArchDuke made hast to light,
and offered to hold the King’s Stirrop at his alighting; which the King
would not permit, but descending from Horse-back, they embraced with
great affection, and withdrawing into the Church to a place prepared,
they had long Conference, not only upon the Confirmation of former
Treaties, and the of Commerce, but upon Cross Marriages, to be had
between the Duke of York the King’s second Son, and the Arch-Duke’s
Daughter, And again between Charles the ArchDukes Son and Heir, and Mary
the King’s second Daughter. But these Blossoms of unripe Marriages, were
but friendly wishes, and the Airs of loving Entertainment; though one of
them came afterwards to Conclusion in Treaty, though not in Effect. But
during the time that the two Princes conversed and commoned together in
the Suburbs of Calice, the Demonstrations on both sides were passing
hearty and affectionate, especially on the part of the Arch-Duke. Who
(besides that he was a Prince of an excellent good nature) being
conscious to himself, how drily the King had been used by his Council in
the matter of Perkin, did strive by all means to recover it in the
King’s affection. And having also his ears continually beaten with the
Counsels of his Father and Fatherin-law, who (in respect of their
jealous hatred against the French King) did always advise the Arch-Duke
to anchor himself upon the Amity of King Henry of England; was glad upon
this occasion, to put in ure and practice their precepts, calling the
King Patron, and Father, and Protector, (these very words the King
repeats; when he certified of the loving behaviour of the Arch-Duke to
the City) and what else he could devise, to express his love and
observance to the King. There came also to the King the Governour of
Picardy, and the Bailiff of Amiens, sent from Lewis the French King to
do him honour, and to give him knowledge of his victory and winning of
the Duchy of Millan. It seemeth the King was well pleased with the
honours he received from those parts, while he was at Calice. For he did
himself certifie all the News and Occurrents of them in every
particular, from Calice, to the Mayor and Aldermen of London, which (no
doubt) made no small talk in the City. For the King, though he could not
entertain the good will of the Citizens, as Edward the Fourth did; yet
by affability and other Princely Graces, did ever make very much of
them, and apply himself to them.</p>
<p>This year also dyed John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, Chancellor
of England, and Cardinal. He was a wise man, and an eloquent, but in his
nature harsh, and haughty; much accepted by the King, but envied by the
Nobility, and hated of the People. Neither was his name left out of
Perkin’s Proclamation for any good will, but they would not bring him in
amongst the King’s Casting-Counters, because he had the Image and
Superscription upon him of the Pope, in his Honour of Cardinal. He wan
the King with Secrecy and Diligence, but chiefly because he was his old
Servant in his less Fortunes: And also for that (in his affections) he
was not without an inveterate malice against the House of York, under
whom he had been in trouble. He was willing also to take Envy from the
King, more than the King was willing to put upon him. For the King cared
not for Subterfuges, but would stand Envy, and appear in any thing that
was to his mind; which made Envy still grow upon him more universal, but
less daring. But in the matter of Exactions, time did after shew, that
the Bishop in feeding the King’s humour, did rather temper it. He had
been by Richard the Third committed (as in custody) to the Duke of
Buckingham, whom he did secretly incite to revolt from King Richard. But
after the Duke was engaged, and thought the Bishop should have been his
chief Pilot in the Tempest, the Bishop was gotten into the Cock-boat,
and fled over beyond Seas. But whatsoever else was in the Man, he
deserveth a most happy Memory, in that he was the principal Mean of
joyning the two Roses. He dyed of great years, but of strong health and
Powers.</p>
<p>The next year, which was the Sixteenth year of the King, and the year
of our Lord One thousand five hundred, was the year of Jubile at Rome.
But Pope Alexander, to save the Hazard and Charges of mens Journeys to
Rome, thought good to make over those Graces by exchange, to such as
would pay a convenient Rate, seeing they could not come to fetch them.
For which purpose was sent into England Jasper Pons, a Spaniard, the
Pope’s Commissioner, better chosen than were the Commissioners of Pope
Leo, afterwards employed for Germany; for he carried the Business with
great wisdom, and semblance of Holiness. In so much as he levied great
summs of Money within this Land to the Pope’s use, with little or no
Scandal. It was thought the King shared in the Money. But it appeareth
by a Letter which Cardinal Adrian, the King’s Pensioner, wrote to the
King from Rome some few years after, that this was not so. For this
Cardinal, being to perswade Pope Julius on the King’s behalf, to
expedite the Bull of Dispensation for the Marriage between Prince Henry
and the Lady Katherine, finding the Pope difficil in granting thereof,
doth use it as a principal Argument concerning the King’s merit toward
that See, that he had touched none of those Deniers, which had been
levied by Pons in England. But that it might the better appear (for the
satisfaction of the Common people) that this was Consecrate Money, the
same Nuncio brought unto the King a Brief from the Pope, wherein the
King was exhorted and summoned to come in Person against the Turk. For
that the Pope (out of the care of an Universal Father) seeing almost
under his eyes the Successes and Progresses of that great Enemy of the
Faith, had had in the Conclave, and with the Assistance of the
Ambassadors of forein Princes, divers Consultations about an Holy War,
and a General Expedition of Christian Princes against the Turk. Wherein
it was agreed, and thought fit, that the Hungarians, Polonians, and
Bobemians should make a War upon Thracia; the French and Spaniards upon
Gracia; and that the Pope (willing to sacrifice himself in so good a
Cause) in Person and in Company of the King of England, the Venetians,
and such other States as were great in maritim Power, would sail with a
puissant Navy through the Mediterrane unto Constantinople. And that to
this end, his Holiness had sent Nuncio’s to all Christian Princes; As
well for a Cessation of all Quarrels and Differences amongst themselves,
as for speedy Preparations and Contributions of Forces and Treasure for
this Sacred Enterprize.</p>
<p>To this the King, (who understood well the Court of Rome) made an
Answer rather Solemn, than Serious: Signifying;</p>
<p>THat no Prince on Earth should be more forward and obedient, both by
his Person, and by all his possible Forces, and Fortunes, to enter into
this Sacred War, than himself. But that the distance of Place was such,
as no Forces that he should raise for the Seas, could be levied or
prepared, but with double the charge, and double the time (at the least)
that they might be from the other Princes, that had their Territories
nearer adjoyning. Besides, that neither the manner of his Ships (having
no Galleys) nor the Experience of his Pilots and Mariners could be so
apt for those Seas, as theirs. And therefore that his Holiness might do
well, to move one of those other Kings, who lay fitter for the purpose,
to accompany him by Sea. Whereby both all things would be sooner put in
readiness, and with less Charge, and the Emulation and Division of
Command, which might grow between those Kings of France and Spain, if
they should both joyn in the War by Land upon Grecia, might be wisely
avoided. And that for his part, he would not be wanting in Ayds and
Contribution. Yet notwithstanding, if both these Kings should refuse,
rather than his Holiness should go alone, he would wait upon him, as
soon as he could be ready. Always provided, that he might first see all
Differences of the Christian Princes amongst themselves, fully laid down
and appeased (as for his own part he was in none.) And that he might
have some good Towns upon the Coast in Italy put into his hands, for the
Retrait and safeguard of his Men.</p>
<p>With this Answer Jasper Pons returned, nothing at all discontented.
And yet this Declaration of the King (as superficial as it was) gave him
that Reputation abroad, as he was not long after elected by the Knights
of the Rhodes, Protector of their Order; All things multiplying to
Honour in a Prince, that had gotten such high Estimation for his Wisdom
and Sufficiency.</p>
<p>There were these two last years some proceedings against Hereticks,
which was rare in this King’s Reign, and rather by Penances, than by
Fire. The King had (though he were no good School-man) the Honour to
convert one of them by Dispute at Canterbury.</p>
<p>This year also, though the King were no more haunted with Sprites,
for that by the sprinkling, partly of Blood, and partly of Water, he had
chased them away; yet nevertheless he had certain Apparitions that
troubled him, still shewing themselves from one Region, which was the
House of-York. It came so to pass, that the Earl of Suffolk, Son to
Elizabeth, eldest Sister to King Edward the Fourth, by John Duke of
Suffolk, her second Husband, and Brother to John Earl of Lincoln, that
was slain at Stockfield, being of an hasty and Cholerick disposition,
had killed a man in his fury; whereupon the King gave him his Pardon.
But either willing to leave a Cloud upon him, or the better to make him
feel his Grace, produced him openly to plead his Pardon. This wrought in
the Earl, as in a haughty stomack it useth to do; for the Ignominy
printed deeper than the Grace. Wherefore he being discontent, fled
secretly into Flanders, unto his Aunt the Duchess of Burgundy. The King
startled at it. But being taught by Troubles, to use fair and timely
Remedies, wrought so with him by Messages, (the Lady Margaret also
growing by often failing in her Alchymy, weary of her Experiments, and
partly being a little sweetned, for that the King had not touched her
name in the Confession of Perkin) that he came over again upon good
terms, and was reconciled to the King.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the next year, being the Seventeenth of the King,
the Lady Katherine fourth Daughter of Ferdinando and Isabella, King and
Queen of Spain, arrived in England, at Plimouth, the second of October,
and was married to Prince Arthur in Pauls the fourteenth of November
following. The Prince being then about fifteen years of age, and the
Lady about eighteen. The manner of her Receiving, the manner of her
Entry into London, and the Celebrity of the Marriage were performed with
great and true Magnificence, in regard of Cost, Shew, and Order. The
chief man that took the care was Bishop Fox; who was not only a grave
Counsellor for War or Peace, but also a good Surveyor of Works, and a
good Master of Ceremonies, and any thing else that was fit for the
Active part, belonging to the service of Court, or State of a great
King. This Marriage was almost seven years in Treaty; which was in part
caused by the tender years of the Marriage-couple, especially of the
Prince. But the true reason was, that these two Princes, being Princes
of great Policy and profound Judgment, stood a great time looking one
upon another’s Fortunes, how they would go, knowing well that in the
mean time, the very Treaty it self gave abroad in the World a Reputation
of a strait Conjunction and Amity between them; which served on both
sides to many purposes, that their several Affairs required, and yet
they continued still free. But in the end, when the Fortunes of both the
Princes did grow every day more and more prosperous and assured, and
that looking all about them they saw no better Conditions, they shut it
up.</p>
<p>The Marriage-Money the Princess brought (which was turned over to the
King by Act of Renunciation) was two hundred thousand Ducats. Whereof
one hundred thousand were payable ten days after the Solemnization, and
the other hundred thousand at two payments Annual; but part of it to be
in Jewels and Plate, and a due course set down to have them justly and
indifferently prized. The Joynture or Advancement of the Lady, was the
third part of the Principality of Wales, and of the Dukedom of Cornwal,
and of the Earldom of Chester, to be after set forth in severalty. And
in case she came to be Queen of England, her Advancement was left
indefinite, but thus; That it should be as great, as ever any former
Queen of England had.</p>
<p>In all the Devices and Conceits of the Triumphs of this Marriage,
there was a great deal of Astronomy. The Lady being resembled to
Hesperus, and the Prince to Arcturus, and the old King Alphonsus (that
was the greatest Astronomer of Kings, and was Ancestor to the Lady) was
brought in to be the Fortune-celler of the Match. And whosoever had
those Toys in Compiling, they were not altogether Pedantical. But you
may be sure that King Arthur, the Briton, and the descent of the Lady
Katherine from the House of Lancaster, was in no wise forgotten. But (as
it should seem) it is not good to fetch Fortunes from the Stars. For
this young Prince (that drew upon him at that time, not only the Hopes
and Affections of his Countrey, but the Eyes and Expectation of
Foreiners) after a few Months, in the beginning of April, deceased at
Ludlow-Castle, where he was sent to keep his Resiance and Court, as
Prince of Wales. Of this Prince, in respect he dyed so young, and by
reason of his Father’s manner of Education, that did cast no great
Lustre upon his Children, there is little particular Memory. Only thus
much remaineth, that he was very studious and learned, beyond his years,
and beyond the Custom of great Princes.</p>
<p>There was a doubt ripped up in the times following, when the Divorce
of King Henry the Eighth from the Lady Katherine did so much busie the
world, whether Arthur was bedded with his Lady or no, whereby that
matter in fact (of Carnal Knowledge) might be part of the Case. And it
is true, that the Lady her self denyed it, or at least her Council stood
upon it, and would not blanch that Advantage, although the plenitude of
the Pope’s power of Dispensing was the main Question. And this Doubt was
kept long open, in respect of the two Queens that succeeded, Mary and
Elizabeth, whose Legitimations were incompatible one with another,
though their Succession was setled by Act of Parliament. And the Times
that favoured Queen Maries Legitimation, would have it believed, that
there was no Carnal Knowledge between Arthur and Katherine. Not that
they would seem to derogate from the Pope’s absolute power, to dispense
even in that Case; but only in point of Honour, and to make the Case
more favourable and smooth. And the Times that favoured Queen Elizabeths
Legitimation (which were the longer, and the later) maintained the
contrary. So much there remaineth in Memory, that it was half a years
time between the Creation of Henry Prince of Wales, and Prince Arthur’s
death; which was construed to be, for to expect a full time, whereby it
might appear, whether the Lady Katherine were with Child by Prince
Arthur, or no. Again, the Lady her self procured a Bull, for the better
Corroboration of the Marriage, with a Clause of (vel forsan cognitam)
which was not in the first Bull. There was given in Evidence also, when
the cause of the Divorce was handled, a pleasant passage, which was;
That in a Morning Prince Arthur, upon his up-rising from Bed with her,
called for drink, which he was not accustomed to do, and finding the
Gentleman of his Chamber that brought him the drink to smile at it and
to note it, he said merrily to him, That he had been in the midst of
Spain, which was an hot Region, and his Journey had made him dry, and
that if the other had been in so hot a Clime, he would have been dryer
than he. Besides, the Prince was upon the point of Sixteen years of Age
when he dyed, and forward, and able in Body.</p>
<p>The February following, Henry Duke of York was created Prince of
Wales, and Earl of Chester and Flint. For the Dukedom of Cornwal
devolved to him by Statute. The King also being fasthanded, and loth to
part with a second Dowry, but chiefly being affectionate both by his
Nature, and out of Politick Considerations to continue the Alliance with
Spain, prevailed with the Prince (though not without some Reluctation,
such as could be in those years, for he was not twelve years of Age) to
be contracted with the Princess Katherine. The secret Providence of God
ordaining that Marriage, to be the Occasion of great Events and
Changes.</p>
<p>The same year were the Espousals of James King of Scotland, with the
Lady Margaret, the King’s eldest Daughter, which was done by Proxy, and
published at Paul’s Cross, the five and twentieth of January, and Te
Deum solemnly sung. But certain it is, that the Joy of the City
thereupon shewed, by Ringing of Bells, and Bon-fires, and such other
Incense of the People, was more than could be expected, in a Case of so
great and fresh Enmity between the Nations; especially in London, which
was far enough off from feeling any of the former calamities of the War.
And therefore might be truly attributed to a Secret Instinct and
Inspiring (which many times runneth not only in the Hearts of Princes,
but in the Pulse and Veins of People) touching the happiness thereby to
ensue in time to come. This Marriage was in August following consummate
at Edenburgh. The King bringing his Daughter as far as Colly-Weston on
the way, and then consigning her to the Attendance of the Earl of
Northumberland; who with a great Troop of Lords and Ladies of Honour,
brought her into Scotland, to the King her Husband.</p>
<p>This Marriage had been in Treaty by the space of almost three years,
from the time that the King of Scotland did first open his mind to
Bishop Fox. The Summ given in Marriage by the King, was ten thousand
Pounds. And the Joynture and Advancement assured by the King of
Scotland, was two thousand Pounds a year, after King James his Death,
and one thousand Pounds a year in present, for the Ladys Allowance or
Maintenance. This to be set forth in Lands, of the best and most certain
Revenue. During the Treaty, it is reported, that the King remitted the
matter to his Council; And that some of the Table in the Freedom of
Counsellors (the King being present) did put the Case; that if God
should take the King’s two Sons without Issue, that then the Kingdom of
England would fall to the King of Scotland, which might prejudice the
Monarchy of England. Whereunto the King himself replied; That if that
should be, Scotland would be but an Accession to England, and not
England to Scotland, for that the greater would draw the less: And that
it was a safer Union for England, than that of France. This passed as an
Oracle, and silenced those that moved the Question.</p>
<p>The same year was fatal, as well for Deaths, as Marriages, and that
with equal temper. For the Joys and Feasts of the two Marriages, were
compensed with the Mournings, and Funerals of Prince Arthur (of whom we
have spoken) and of Queen Elizabeth, who dyed in Child-bed in the Tower,
and the Child lived not long after. There dyed also that year Sir
Reginold Bray, who was noted to have had with the King the greatest
Freedom of any Counsellor; but it was but a Freedom, the better to set
off Flattery. Yet he bare more than his just part of Envy, for the
Exactions.</p>
<p>At this time the King’s Estate was very prosperous, secured by the
Amity of Scotland, strengthned by that of Spain, cherished by that of
Burgundy, all Domestick Troubles quenched, and all Noise of War (like a
Thunder a-far-off) going upon Italy. Wherefore Nuture, which many times
is happily contained, and refrained by some Bands of Fortune, began to
take place in the King; carrying (as with a strong Tide) his Affections
and Thoughts unto the gathering and heaping up of Treasure. And as Kings
do more easily find Instruments for their Will and Humour, than for
their Service and Honour; He had gotten for his purpose, or beyond his
purpose, two Instruments, Empson and Dudley, (whom the people esteemed
as his Horse-Leeches and Shearers) bold men, and careless of Fame, and
that took Toll of their Master’s Grist. Dudley was of a good Family,
Eloquent, and one that could put Hateful Business into good Language.
But Empson, that was the Son of a Sieve-maker, triumphed always upon the
Deed done, putting off all other respects whatsoever. These two Persons
being Lawyers in Science, and Privy Counsellors in Authority (as the
corruption of the best things is the worst) turned Law and Justice into
Wormwood and Rapine. For first, their manner was to cause divers
Subjects to be indicted of sundry Crimes, and so far forth to proceed in
form of Law; But when the Bills were found, then presently to commit
them. And nevertheless not to produce them to any reasonable time to
their Answer, but to suffer them to languish long in Prison; and by
sundry artificial Devices and Terrours, to extort from them great Fines
and Ransoms, which they termed Compositions and Mitigations.</p>
<p>Neither did they (towards the end) observe so much as the Halfface of
Justice, in proceeding by Indictment; but sent forth their Precepts to
attach men, and convent them before themselves and some others, at their
private Houses, in a Court of Commission, and there used to shuffle up a
Summary Proceeding, by Examination, without tryal of Jury; assuming to
themselves there, to deal both in Pleas of the Crown, and Controversies
Civil.</p>
<p>Then did they also use to enthral and charge the Subjects Lands with
Tenures in Capite, by finding False Offices, and thereby to work upon
them for Wardships, Liveries, Primier Seisins, and Alienations, (being
the fruits of those Tenures) refusing upon divers Pretexts and Delays,
to admit men to traverse those False Offices, according to the Law. Nay,
the King’s Wards after they had accomplished their full Age, could not
be suffered to have Livery of their Lands, without paying excessive
Fines, far exceeding all reasonable Rates. They did also vex men with
Informations of Intrusion upon scarce colourable Titles.</p>
<p>When men were Out-lawed in Personal Actions they would not permit
them to purchase their Charters of Pardon, except they paid great and
intolerable, summs; standing upon the strict Point of Law, which upon
Out-lawries giveth Forfeiture of Goods. Nay, contrary to all Law and
Colour, they maintained, the King ought to have the half of mens Lands
and Rents, during the space of full two years, for a Pain in Case of
Out-lawry. They would also ruffle with Jurors, and enforce them to find
as they would direct, and (if they did not) Convent them, Imprison them,
and Fine them.</p>
<p>These and many other Courses, fitter to be buried than repeated, they
had of Preying upon the People; both like Tame Hawks for their Master,
and like Wild Hawks for themselves; in so much as they grew to great
Riches and Substance. But their principal working was upon Penal Laws,
wherein they spared none, great nor small; nor considered whether the
Law were possible, or impossible, in Use or Obsolete. But raked over all
old and new Statutes, though many of them were made with intention
rather of Terrour, than of Rigour; having ever a Rabble of Promoters,
Questmongers, and leading Jurors at their Command, so as they could have
any thing found either for Fact, or Valuation.</p>
<p>There remaineth to this day a Report, that the King was on a time
entertained by the Earl of Oxford (that was his principal Servant, both
for War and Peace) nobly and sumptuously, at his Castle at Henningham.
And at the King’s going away, the Earl’s Servants stood (in a seemly
manner) in their Livery-Coats, with Cognisances, ranged on both sides,
and made the King a . The King called the Earl to him, and said; My
Lord, I have heard much of your Hospitality, but I see it is greater
than the speech. These handsom Gentlemen and Yeomen, which I see on both
sides of me, are sure your Menial Servants. The Earl smiled, and said,
It may please your Grace, that were not for mine ease. They are most of
them my Retainers, they are come to do me service at such a time as
this, and chiefly to see your Grace. The King started a little, and
said; By my faith (my Lord) I thank you for my good Cheer, but I may not
endure to have my Laws broken in my sight. My Attorney must speak with
you. And it is part of the Report, that the Earl compounded for no less
than fifteen thousand Marks. And to shew further the Kings extreme
Diligence; I do remember to have seen long since a Book of Accompt of
Empson’s, that had the King’s hand almost to every Leaf, by way of
Signing, and was in some places Postilled in the Margin, with the King’s
hand likewise, where was this Remembrance:</p>
<p>Item, Received of such a one, five Marks for the Pardon to be
procured; and if the Pardon do not pass, the Money to be re-paid, except
the party be some other-ways satisfied.</p>
<p>And over against this Memorandum (of the King’s own hand) Otherwise
satisfied.</p>
<p>Which I do the rather mention, because it shews in the King a
Nearness, but yet with a kind of Justness. So these little Sands and
Grains of Gold and Silver (as it seemeth) helped not a little to make up
the great Heap and Bank.</p>
<p>But mean while (to keep the King awake) the Earl of Suffolk having
been too gay at Prince Arthur’s Marriage, and sunk himself deep in Debt,
had yet once more a mind to be a Knight-Errant; and to seek Adventures
in Forein parts. And taking his Brother with him, fled again into
Flanders. That (no doubt) which gave him Confidence, was the great
Murmur of the People against the King’s Government. And being a Man of a
light and rash Spirit, he thought every Vapour would be a Tempest.
Neither wanted he some Party within the Kingdom. For the Murmur of
People awakes the Discontents of Nobles; and again, that calleth up
commonly some Head of Sedition. The King resorting to his wonted and
tryed Arts, caused Sir Robert Curson, Captain of the Castle at Hammes
(being at that time beyond Sea, and therefore less likely to be wrought
upon by the King) to flie from his Charge, and to feign himself a
servant of the Earl’s. This Knight, having insinuated himself into the
Secrets of the Earl, and finding by him upon whom chiefly he had either
Hope or Hold, advertised the King thereof in great secrecy. But
nevertheless maintained his own Credit and inward trust with the Earl.
Upon whose Advertisements, the King attached William Courtney, Earl of
Devonshire, his Brother-in-Law, married to the Lady Katherine, Daughter
to King Edward the Fourth; William de la Pole, Brother to the Earl of
Suffolk; Sir James Tirrel, and Sir John Windham, and some other meaner
Persons, and committed them to Custody. George, Lord Abergaveny, and Sir
Thomas Green, were at the same time apprehended; but as upon less
Suspition, so in a freer Restraint, and were soon after delivered. The
Earl of Devonshire, being interessed in the blood of York, that was
rather Feared than Nocent; yet as One, that might be the Object of
others Plots and Designs, remained Prisoner in the Tower, during the
King’s life. William de la Pole, was also long restrained, though not so
straitly. But for Sir James Tirrel (against whom the Blood of the
Innocent Princes, Edward the Fifth, and his Brother did still cry from
under the Altar) and Sir John Windham, and the other meaner ones, they
were attainted and executed; the two Knights beheaded. Nevertheless, to
confirm the Credit of Curson (who belike had not yet done all his Feats
of Activity) there was published at Paul’s Cross, about the time of the
said Executions, the Pope’s Bull of Excommunication and Curse, against
the Earl of Suffolk, and Sir Robert Curson, and some others by name, and
likewise in general against all the Abettors of the said Earl. Wherein
it must be confessed, that Heaven was made too much to bow to Earth, and
Religion to Policy. But soon after, Curson (when he saw time) returned
into England, and withal into wonted Favour with the King, but worse
Fame with the People. Upon whose return the Earl was much dismayed, and
seeing himself destitute of hopes (the Lady Margaret also by tract of
Time, and bad Success, being now becom cool in those attempts) after
some wandering in France, and Germany, and certain little Projects, no
better than Squibs of an Exiled man, being tired out, retired again into
the Protection of the Arch-Duke Philip in Flanders, who by the death of
Isabella was at that time King of Castile, in the right of Joan his
Wife.</p>
<p>This year (being the Nineteenth of his Reign) the King called his
Parliament. Wherein a man may easily guess, how absolute the King took
himself to be with his Parliament, when Dudley that was so hateful, was
made Speaker of the House of Commons. In this Parliament, there were not
made any Statutes memorable, touching publick Government. But those that
were, had still the Stamp of the King’s Wisdom and Policy.</p>
<p>There was a Statute made for the disannulling of all Patents of
Lease, or Grant, to such as came not upon lawful Summons, to serve the
King in his Wars, against the Enemies or Rebels, or that should depart
without the King’s licence; With an exception of certain Persons of the
Long-robe. Providing nevertheless, That they should have the King’s
Wages, from their House, till their return home again. There had been
the like made before for Offices, and by this Statute it was extended to
Lands. But a man may easily see by many Statutes made in this King’s
time, that the King thought it safest, to assist Martial Law by Law of
Parliament.</p>
<p>Another Statute was made, prohibiting the bringing in of Manufactures
of Silk wrought by it self, or mixt with any other Thred. But it was not
of Stuffs of whole piece (for that the Realm had of them no Manufacture
in use at that time) but of Knit-Silk, or Texture of Silk; as Ribands,
Laces, Cawls, Points, and Girdles, andandandandc. which the people of
England could then well skill to make. This Law pointed at a true
Principle; That where forein materials are but Superfluities, forein
Manufactures should be prohibited. For that will either banish the
Superfluity, or gain the Manufacture.</p>
<p>There was a Law also of Resumption of Patents of Gaols, and the
Reannexing of them to the Sherifwicks; Priviledged Officers being no
less an Interruption of Justice, than Priviledged Places.</p>
<p>There was likewise a Law to restrain the By-laws or Ordinances of
Corporations, which many times were against the Prerogative of the King,
the Common-law of the Realm, and the Liberty of the Subject, being
Fraternities in Evil. It was therefore Provided, that they should not be
put in Execution, without the Allowance of the Chancellor, Treasurer,
and the two Chief-Justices, or three of them, or of the two Justices of
Circuit where the Corporation was.</p>
<p>Another Law was (in effect) to bring in the Silver of the Realm to
the Mint, in making all clipped, minished, or impaired Coins of Silver,
not to be currant in payments, without giving any Remedy of weight, but
with an exception only of a reasonable wearing, which was as nothing in
respect of the incertainty; and so (upon the matter) to set the Mint on
work, and give way to New Coins of Silver, which should be then
minted.</p>
<p>There likewise was a long Statute against Vagabonds, wherein two
things may be noted; The one, the Dislike the Parliament had of Gaoling
of them, as that which was chargeable, pesterous, and of no open
Example. The other, that in the Statutes of this King’s time, (for this
of the Nineteenth year is not the only Statute of that kind) there are
ever coupled, the punishment of Vagabonds, and the forbidding of Dice,
and Cards, and unlawful Games unto Servants and mean people, and the
putting down and suppressing of Ale-houses, as Strings of one Root
together, and as if the One were unprofitable, without the Other.</p>
<p>As for Riot and Retainers, there passed scarce any Parliament in this
time without a Law against them, the King ever having an Eye to Might,
and Multitude.</p>
<p>There was granted also that Parliament a Subsidy, both for the
Temporalty and the Clergy. And yet nevertheless, ere the year expired,
there went out Commissions for a general Benevolence, though there were
no Wars, no Fears. The same year the City gave five thousand Marks, for
Confirmation of their Liberties; A thing fitter for the Beginnings of
King’s Reigns, than the latter Ends. Neither was it a small matter, that
the Mint gained upon the late Statute, by the Recoinage of Groats, and
Half-Groats, now Twelve-pences and Sixpences. As for Empson and Dudley’s
Mills, they did grind more than ever. So that it was a strange thing, to
see what Golden Showrs poured down upon the King’s Treasury at once. The
last payments of the Marriage-Money from Spain; The Subsidy; The
Benevolence; The Recoinage; The Redemption of the Cities Liberties; The
Casualties. And this is the more to be marvelled at, because the King
had then no Occasions at all of Wars or Troubles. He had now but one Son
and one Daughter unbestowed. He was Wise; He was of an High Mind; He
needed not to make Riches his Glory. He did excel in so many things
else; save that certainly Avarice doth ever find in it self matter of
Ambition. Belike he thought to leave his Son such a Kingdom, and such a
Mass of Treasure; as he might choose his Greatness where he would.</p>
<p>This year was also kept the Serjeants , which was the second Call in
this Kings Days.</p>
<p>About this time Isabella, Queen of Castile, deceased; a right Noble
Lady, and an Honour to her Sex, and Times, and the Corner-stone of the
Greatness of Spain, that hath followed. This Accident the King took not
for News at large, but thought it had a great Relation to his own
Affairs; especially in two points: The one for Example; the other for
Consequence. First, he conceived that the Case of Ferdinando of Arragon,
after the death of Queen Isabella, was his own Case, after the death of
his own Queen: and the Case of Joan the Heir unto Castile, was the Case
of his own Son Prince Henry. For if both of the Kings had their Kingdoms
in the right of their Wives, they descended to the Heirs, and did not
accrew to the Husbands. And although his own Case had both Steel and
Parchment, more than the other (that is to say, a Conquest in the Field,
and an Act of Parliament) yet, notwithstanding, that Natural Title of
Descent in Blood, did (in the imagination even of a wise man) breed a
Doubt, that the other two were not safe nor sufficient. Wherefore he was
wonderful diligent to enquire and observe what became of the King of
Arragon, in holding and continuing the Kingdom of Castile. And whether
he did hold it in his own Right, or as Administrator to his Daughter;
and whether he were like to hold it in Fast, or to be put out by his
Son-in-Law. Secondly, he did revolve in his mind, that the State of
Christendom might by this late Accident have a turn. For whereas
before-time himself, with the Conjunction of Arragon and Castile (which
then was one) and the Amity of Maximilian and Philip his Son the
Arch-Duke, was far too strong a Party for France; he began to fear, that
now the French King (who had great Interest in the Affections of Philip
the young King of Castile) and Philip himself, now King of Castile, (who
was in ill terms with his Father-in-Law about the present Government of
Castile.) And thirdly Maximilian, Philip’s Father (who was ever
variable, and upon whom the surest Aim that could be taken, was that he
would not be long, as he had been last before) would, all three being
potent Princes, enter into some strait League and Confederation amongst
themselves. Whereby though he should not be endangered, yet he should be
left to the poor Amity of Arragon. And whereas he had been heretofore a
kind of Arbiter of Europe, he should now go less, and be over-topped by
so great a Conjunction. He had also (as it seems) an inclination to
marry, and bethought himself of some fit Conditions abroad. And amongst
others he had heard of the Beauty and virtuous Behaviour of the young
Queen of Naples, the Widow of Ferdinando the younger, being then of
Matronal years of seven and twenty. By whose Marriage he thought that
the Kingdom of Naples (having been a Goal for a time, between the King
of Arragon, and the French King, and being but newly setled) might in
some part be deposited in his hands, who was so able to keep the Stakes.
Therefore he sent in Ambassage or Message three confident Persons;
Francis Marsin, James Braybrook, and John Stile, upon two several
Inquisitions rather than Negotiations. The One, touching the Person and
Condition of the young Queen of Naples; the Other, touching all
particulars of Estate, that concerned the Fortunes and Intentions of
Ferdinando. And because they may observe best, who themselves are
observed least, he sent them under Colourable Pretexts; giving them
Letters of Kindness and Compliment from Katharine the Princess, to her
Aunt, and Niece, the Old and Young Queen of Naples, and delivering to
them also a Book of new Articles of Peace; which notwithstanding it had
been delivered unto Doctor De Putbla, the Leigier Ambassador of Spain
here in England, to be sent, yet for that the King had been long without
hearing from Spain, he thought good those Messengers, when they had been
with the two Queens, should likewise pass on to the Court of Ferdinando,
and take a Copy of the Book with them. The Instructions touching the
Queen of Naples were so curious and exquisite, being as Articles whereby
to direct a Survey, or a Particular of her Person, for Complexion,
Favour, Feature, Stature, Health, Age, Customs, Behaviour, Conditions,
and Estate, as if the King had been young, a man would have judged him
to be Amorous; but being ancient, it ought to be interpreted, that sure
he was very Chast, for that he meant to find all things in one Woman,
and so to settle his Affections, without ranging. But in this March he
was soon cooled, when he heard from his Ambassadors, that this young
Queen had had a goodly Joynture in the Realm of Naples, well answered
during the time of her Uncle Frederick, yea, and during the time of
Lewis the French King, in whose Division her Revenue fell; but since the
time that the Kingdom was in Ferdinando’s hands, all was assigned to the
Army, and Garrisons there, and she received only a Pension or Exhibition
out of his Coffers.</p>
<p>The other part of the Inquiry had a grave and diligent Return,
informing the King at full of the present State of King Ferdinando. By
this Report it appeared to the King, that Ferdinando did continue the
Government of Castile as Administrator unto his Daughter Joan, by the
Title of Queen Isabella’s Will, and partly by the Custom of the Kingdom,
as he pretended. And that all Mandates and Grants were expedited in the
name of Joan his Daughter, and himself as Administrator, without mention
of Philip, her Husband. And that King Ferdinando, howsoever he did
dismiss himself of the name of King of Castile, yet meant to hold the
Kingdom, without Accompt; and in absolute Command.</p>
<p>It appeareth also, that he flattered himself with hopes, that King
Philip would permit unto him the Goverment of Castile during his life;
which he had laid his Plot to work him unto, both by some Counsellors of
his about him, which Ferdinando had at his devotion, and chiefly by
promise, that in case Philip gave not way unto it, he would marry some
young Lady, whereby to put him by the Succession of Arragon and Granada,
in case he should have a Son. And lastly by representing unto him that
the Government of the Burgundians, till Philip were by continuance in
Spain made as Natural of Spain, would not be endured by the Spaniards.
But in all those things (though wisely laid down and considered)
Ferdinando failed; But that Pluto was better to him than Pallas.</p>
<p>In the same Report also, the Ambassadors being mean men, and
therefore the more free, did strike upon a string which was somewhat
dangerous. For they declared plainly, that the People of Spain, both
Nobles and Commons, were better affected unto the part of Philip (so he
brought his Wife with him) than to Ferdinando; and expressed the reason
to be, because he had imposed upon them many Taxes; and Tallages, which
was the King’s own Case between him and his Son.</p>
<p>There was also in this Report a Declaration of an Overture of of
Marriage, which Amason the Secretary of Ferdinando had made unto the
Ambassadors in great secret, between Charles Prince of Castile and Mary
the King’s second Daughter; assuring the King, that the Treaty of
Marriage then on foot, for the said Prince and the Daughter of France,
would break, and that she the said Daughter of France should be married
to Angolesme, that was the Heir Apparant of France.</p>
<p>There was a touch also of a speech of Marriage between Ferdinando and
Madam De Fois, a Lady of the Blood of France, which afterwards indeed
succeeded. But this was reported as learned in France, and silenced in
Spain.</p>
<p>The King by the return of this Ambassage, which gave great light unto
his Affairs, was well instructed, and prepared how to carry himself
between Ferdinando King of Arragon, and Philip his Son-in-law, King of
Castile; resolving with himself, to do all that in him lay to keep them
at one within themselves; But howsoever that succeeded, by a moderate
Carriage and bearing the Person of a Common-friend, to lose neither of
their Friendships; but yet to run a Course more entire with the King of
Arragon, but more laboured and officious with the King of Castile. But
he was much taken with the Overture of Marriage with his Daughter Mary;
Both because it was the greatest Marriage of Christendom, and for that
it took hold of both Allies.</p>
<p>But to corroborate his Alliance with Philip, the Winds gave him an
Enterview. For Philip choosing the Winter-season, the better to surprise
the King of Arragon, set forth with a great Navy out of Planders for
Spain in the Month of January, the One and Twentieth year of the King’s
Reign. But himself was surprised with a cruel Tempest, that scattered
his Ships upon the several Coasts of England. And the Ship wherein King
and Queen were (with two other small Barques only) torn, and in great
peril to escape the fury of the weather, thrust into Weymouth. King
Philip himself, having not been used (as it seems) to Sea, all wearied
and extreme sick, would needs land to refresh his Spirits, though it was
against the Opinion of his Council, doubting it might breed Delay, his
Occasions requiring Celerity.</p>
<p>The Rumour of the Arrival of a puissant Navy upon the Coast, made the
Countrey Arm. And Sir Thomas Trenchard with Forces suddenly raised, not
knowing what the matter might be, came to Weymouth. Where understanding
the Accident, he did in all Humbleness and Humanity invite the King and
Queen to his House; and forthwith dispatched Posts to the Court. Soon
after came Sir John Caroe likewise, with a great troop of Men well
armed; using the like Humbleness and Respect towards the King, when he
knew the Case. King Philip doubting that they, being but Subjects, durst
not let him pass away again, without the King’s Notice and Leave,
yielded to their Entreaties, to stay till they heard from the Court. The
King as soon as he heard the News, commanded presently the Earl of
Arundel, to go to visit the King of Castile, and let him understand;
That as he was very sorry for his Mishap, so he was glad that he had
escaped the Danger of the Seas, and likewise of the Occasion himself had
to do him Honour; and desiring him, to think himself as in his own Land;
and that the King made all haste possible to come and embrace him. The
Earl came to him in great Magnificence, with a brave Troop of three
hundred Horse; and (for more State) came by Torch-light. After he had
done the King’s Message, King Philip seeing how the world went, the
sooner to get away, went upon speed to the King at Windsor, and his
Queen followed by easie journeys. The two Kings at their meeting used
all the Caresses, and loving Demonstrations, that were possible. And the
King of Castile said presently to the King; That he was now punished,
for that he would not come within his walled Town of Calice, when they
met last. But the King answered, That Walls and Seas were nothing, where
Hearts were open, and that he was here no otherwise, but to be served.
After a day or two’s refreshing, the Kings entred into speech of
renewing the Treaty; the King saying, That though King Philip’s Person
were the same, yet his Fortunes and State were raised. In which Case a
Renovation of Treaty was used amongst Princes. But while these things
were in handling, the King choosing a fit time, and drawing the King of
Castile into a Room, where they two only were private, and laying his
hand civilly upon his arm, and changing his Countenance a little from a
Countenance of Entertainment, said to him; Sir, you have been saved upon
my Coast, I hope you will not suffer me to wrack upon yours. The King of
Castile asked him, What he meant by that speech? I mean it (saith the
King) by that same Hare-brain wild Fellow, my Subject, the Earl of
Suffolk, who is protected in your Countrey, and begins to play the Fool,
when all others are weary of it. The King of Castile answered; I had
thought (Sir) your Felicity had been above those thoughts. But if it
trouble you, I will banish him, The King replied; Those Hornets were
best in their Nests, and worst when they did flie abroad, that his
desire was, to have him delivered to him. The King of Castile herewith a
little confused, and in a study, said; That can I not do with my honour,
and less with yours; for you will be thought to have used me as a
Prisoner. The King presently said; Then the matter is at an end. For I
will take that dishonour upon me, and so your honour is saved. The King
of Castile, who had the King in great Estimation, and besides remembred
where he was, and knew not what use he might have of the King’s Amity,
for that himself was new in his Estate of Spain, and unsetled, both with
his Father-in-Law, and with his People, composing his Countenance, said;
Sir, you give Law to me; but so will I to you. You shall have him, but
(upon your honour) you shall not take his life. The King embracing him,
said; Agreed. Saith the King of Castile, Neither shall it dislike you,
if I send to him in such a fashion, as he may partly come with his own
good will. The King said; It was well thought of; and if it pleased him,
he would joyn with him, in sending to the Earl a Message to that
purpose. They both sent severally, and mean while they continued
Feasting and Pastimes. The King being (on his part) willing to have the
Earl sure before the King of Castile went; and the King of Castile being
as willing to seem to be enforced. The King also with many wise and
excellent Perswasions, did advise the King of Castile, to be ruled by
the counsel of his Father-in-Law Ferdinando; a Prince so prudent, so
experienced, so fortunate. The King of Castile (who was in no very good
terms with his said Father-in-Law) answered; That if his Father-inLaw
would suffer him to govern his Kingdoms, he should govern him.</p>
<p>There were immediately Messengers sent from both Kings to recall the
Earl of Suffolk: Who upon gentle words used to him was soon charmed, and
willing enough to return; assured of his Life, and hoping of his
Liberty. He was brought through Flanders to Calice, and thence landed at
Dover, and with sufficient Guard delivered and received at the Tower of
London. Mean while King Henry (to draw out the time) continued his
Feastings and Entertainments, and after he had received the King of
Castile into the Fraternity of the Garter, and for a Reciprocal had his
Son the Prince admitted to the Order of the Golden-fleece, he
accompanied King Philip and his Queen to the City of London; where they
were entertained with the greatest Magnificence and Triumph, that could
be upon no greater warning. And as soon as the Earl of Suffolk had been
conveyed to the Tower (which was the serious part) the Jollities had an
end, and the Kings took leave. Nevertheless during their being here,
they in substance concluded that Treaty, which the Flemings term
Intercursus malus, and bears Date at Windsor; for that there be some
things in it, more to the Advantage of the English, than of them;
especially, for that the Free-fishing of the Dutch upon the Coasts and
Seas of England, granted in the Treaty of Undecimo, was not by this
Treaty confirmed. All Articles that confirm former Treaties being
precisely and warily limited and confirmed to matter of Commerce only,
and not otherwise.</p>
<p>It was observed, that the great Tempest which drave Philip into
England, blew down the Golden Eagle, from the Spire of Pauls, and in the
fall it fell upon a Sign of the Black Eagle, which was in Pauls
Church-yard, in the place where the School-House now standeth, and
battered it, and brake it down. Which was a strange stooping of a Hawk
upon a Fowl. This the People interpreted to be an Ominous Prognostick
upon the Imperial House, which was (by Interpretation also) fulfilled
upon Philip the Emperor’s Son, not only in the Present Disaster of the
Tempest, but in that that followed. For Philip arriving into Spain, and
attaining the Possession of the Kingdom of Castile without resistance,
(insomuch as Ferdinando, who had spoke so great before, was with
difficulty admitted to the speech of his Son-in-Law) sickned soon after,
and deceased. Yet after such time as there was an Observation by the
wisest of that Court, That if he had lived, his Father would have gained
upon him in that sort, as he would have governed his Counsels and
Designs, if not his Affections. By this all Spain returned into the
power of Ferdinando in state as it was before; the rather, in regard of
the infirmity of Joan his Daughter, who loving her Husband (by whom she
had many Children) dearly well, and no less beloved of him) howsoever
her Father, to make Philip ill beloved of the People of Spain, gave out
that Philip used her not well) was unable in strength of mind to bear
the Grief of his Decease, and fell distracted of her Wits. Of which
Malady her Father was thought no ways to endeavour the Cure, the better
to hold his Regal Power in Castile. So that as the Felicity of Charles
the Eighth was said to be a Dream; so the Adversity of Ferdinando was
said likewise to be a Dream, it passed over so soon.</p>
<p>About this time the King was desirous to bring into the House of
Lancaster Celestial Honour, and became Suitor to Pope Julius, to
Canonize King Henry the Sixt for a Saint; the rather, in respect of that
his famous Prediction of the King’s own Assumption to the Crown. Julius
referred the matter (as the manner is) to certain Cardinals, to take the
verification of his Holy Acts and Miracles. But it dyed under the
Reference. The general Opinion was, that Pope Julius was too dear, and
that the King would not come to his Rates. But it is more probable, That
that Pope (who was extremely jealous of the Dignity of the See of Rome,
and of the Acts thereof) knowing that King Henry the Sixt was reputed in
the World abroad but for a Simple Man, was afraid it would but diminish
the Estimation of that kind of Honour, if there were not a distance kept
between Innocents and Saints.</p>
<p>The same year likewise there proceeded a Treaty of Marriage between
the King and the Lady Margaret Duchess Dowager of Savoy, only Daughter
to Maximilian, and Sister to the King of Castile; a Lady wise, and of
great good Fame. This Matter had been in speech between the two Kings at
their meeting, but was soon after resumed; and therein was employed for
his first piece the King’s then Chaplain, and after the great Prelate
Thomas Wolsey. It was in the end concluded, with great and ample
Conditions for the King, but with promise De Futuro only. It may be the
King was the rather induced unto it, for that he heard more and more of
the Marriage to go on between his great Friend and Allie Ferdinando of
Arragon, and Madam De Fois, whereby that King began to piece with the
French King, from whom he had been always before severed. So fatal a
thing it is, for the greatest and straitest Amities of Kings, at one
time or other to have a little of the Wheel. Nay there is a further
Tradition (in Spain, though not with us) That the King of Arragon, after
he knew that the Marriage between Charles, the young Prince of Castile,
and Mary the King’s second Daughter went roundly on (which though it was
first moved by the King of Arragon, yet it was afterwards wholly
advanced and brought to perfection by Maximilian, and the Friends on
that side) entred into jealousie, that the King did aspire to the
Government of Castilia, as Administrator during the Minority of his
Son-inLaw; as if there should have been a Competition of Three for that
Government; Ferdinando, Grand-father on the Mothers side; Maximilian,
Grand-father on the Father’s side; and King Henry, Father-in-Law to the
young Prince. Certainly, it is not unlike, but the King’s Government
(carrying the young Prince with him) would have been perhaps more welcom
to the Spaniards, than that of the other Two. For the Nobility of
Castilia, that so lately put out the King of Arragon, in favour of King
Philip, and had discovered themselves so far, could not but be in a
secret Distrust and Distast of that King. And as for Maximilian, upon
Twenty respects he could not have been the Man. But this purpose of the
King’s seemeth to me (considering the King’s safe Courses, never found
to be enterprizing or adventurous) not greatly probable, except he
should have had a Desire to breathe warmer, because he had ill Lungs.
This Marriage with Margaret was protracted from time to time, in respect
of the Infirmity of the King, who now in the Two and Twentieth year of
his Reign began to be troubled with the Gout. But the Defluxion taking
also into his Breast, wasted his Lungs, so that thrice in a Year (in a
kind of Return, and especially in the Spring,) he had great Fitts and
Labours of the Tissick. Nevertheless he continued to intend Business
with as great diligence, as before in his Heath. Yet so, as upon this
warning, he did likewise now more seriously think of the World to come,
and of making himself a Saint, as well as King Henry the Sixth, by
Treasure better employed, than to be given to Pope Julius. For this Year
he gave greater Alms than accustomed, and discharged all Prisoners about
the City, that lay for Fees or Debts, under forty Shillings. He did also
make haste with Religious Foundations; and in the Year following (which
was the Three and Twentieth) finished that of the Savoy. And hearing
also of the bitter Cries of his People against the Oppressions of Dudley
and Empson, and their Complices; partly by Devout Persons about him, and
partly by publick Sermons (the Preachers doing their Duty therein) he
was touched with great Remorse for the same. Nevertheless, Empson and
Dudley, though they could not but hear of these Scruples in the King’s
Conscience; yet as if the King’s Soul and his Money were in several
Offices, that the One was not to intermeddle with the Other, went on
with as great rage as ever. For the same Three and Twentieth Year was
there a sharp Prosecution against Sir William Capel now the second time;
and this was for matters of Misgovernment in his Maioralty. The great
Matter being, that in some Payments he had taken knowledge of False
Moneys, and did not his diligence to examine, and beat it out, who were
the Offendors. For this and some other things laid to his Charge, he was
condemned to pay two thousand Pounds; and being a Man of stomach, and
hardened by his former Troubles, refused to pay a Mite; and be-like used
some untoward Speeches of the Proceedings, for which he was sent to the
Tower, and there remained till the King’s Death. Knesworth likewise,
that had been lately Mayor of London, and both his Sheriffs, were, for
Abuses in their Offices, questioned, and imprisoned, and delivered, upon
one thousand four hundred Pounds paid. Hawis, an Alderman of London, was
put in Trouble, and dyed with Thought and Anguish, before his Business
came to an end. Sir Lawrence Ailmer, who had likewise been Mayor of
London, and his two Sheriffs, were put to the Fine of one thousand
Pounds. And Sir Lawrence, for refusing to make payment, was committed to
Prison, where he stay’d till Empson himself was committed in his
place.</p>
<p>It is no marvel (if the Faults were so light, and the Rates so heavy)
that the King’s Treasure of Store, that he left at his death, most of it
in secret places, under his own key and keeping, at Richmond, amounted
(as by Tradition it is reported to have done) unto the Summ of near
eighteen hundred thousand Pounds Sterling; a huge Mass of Money, even
for these times.</p>
<p>The last Act of State that concluded this King’s Temporal Felicity,
was the Conclusion of a Glorious Match between his Daughter Mary, and
Charles Prince of Castile, afterwards the great Emperor, both being of
tender years; which Treaty was perfected by Bishop Fox, and other his
Commissioners at Calice, the year before the King’s Death. In which
Alliance, it seemeth he himself took so high Contentment, as in a Letter
which he wrote thereupon to the City of London, (Commanding all possible
Demonstrations of Joy to be made for the same) he expresseth himself, as
if he thought he had built a Wall of Brass about his Kingdom. When he
had for his Sons-in-Law a King of Scotland, and a Prince of Castile and
Burgundy. So as now there was nothing to be added to this great King’s
Felicity, being at the top of all worldly Bliss, (in regard of the high
Marriages of his Children, his great Renown throughout Europe, and his
scarce credible Riches, and the perpetual Constancy of his prosperous
Successes) but an opportune Death, to withdraw him from any future blow
of Fortune. Which certainly (in regard of the great Hatred of his People
and the Title of his Son, being then come to Eighteen years of Age, and
being a bold Prince and liberal, and that gained upon the People by his
very Aspect and Presence) had not been impossible to have come upon
him.</p>
<p>To crown also the last year of his Reign, as well as his first, he
did an Act of Piety, rare, and worthy to be taken into Imitation. For he
granted forth a General Pardon, as expecting a second Coronation in a
better Kingdom. He did also declare in his Will, that his mind was, that
Restitution should be made of those Summs, which had been unjustly taken
by his Officers.</p>
<p>And thus this Solomon of England (for Solomon also was too heavy upon
his People in Exactions) having lived Two and Fifty Years, and thereof
Reigned Three and Twenty Years and Eight Months, being in perfect
Memory, and in a most Blessed Mind, in a great Calm of a Consuming
Sickness passed to a better World, the Two and Twentieth of April, 1508.
at his Palace of Richmond, which himself had Built.</p>
<p>THis King (to speak of him in Terms equal to his Deserving) was one
of the best sort of Wonders; a Wonder for Wise-men. He had parts (both
in his Virtues, and his Fortune) not so for a Common-place, as for
Observation. Certainly he was Religious, both in his Affection and
Observance. But as he could see clear (for those times) through
Superstition, so he would be blinded (now and than) by Humane Policy. He
advanced Church-men, he was tender in the Priviledge of Sanctuaries,
though they wrought him much Mischief. He built and endowed many
Religious Foundations, besides his Memorable Hospital of the Savoy. And
yet was he a great Almsgiver in secret; which shewed, that his Works in
publick were dedicated rather to God’s glory, than his own. He professed
always to love and seek Peace; and it was his usual Preface in his
Treaties; That when Christ came into the World, Peace was sung; and when
He went out of the World, Peace was bequeathed. And this Virtue could
not proceed out of Fear, or Softness; for he was Valiant and Active, and
therefore (no doubt) it was truly Christian and Moral. Yet he knew the
way to Peace, was not to seem to be desirous to avoid Wars. Therefore
would be make Offers, and Fames of Wars, till he had mended the
Conditions of Peace. It was also much, that one that was so great a
Lover of Peace, should be so happy in War. For his Arms (either in
Forein or Civil Wars) were never Infortunate, neither did he know what a
Disaster meant. The War of his Coming in, and the Rebellions of the Earl
of Lincoln, and the Lord Awdley were ended by Victory. The Wars of
France and Scotland, by Peaces sought at his hands. That of Britain, by
accident of the Duke’s death. The Insurrection of the Lord Lovel, and
that of Perkin at Exceter, and in Kent, by flight of the Rebels, before
they came to Blows. So that his Fortune of Arms was still Inviolate. The
rather sure, for that in the quenching of the Commotions of his
Subjects, he ever went in Person. Sometimes reserving himself to back
and second his Lieutenants, but ever in Action; and yet that was not
meerly Forwardness, but partly Distrust of others.</p>
<p>He did much maintain and countenance his Laws, which (nevertheless)
was no Impediment to him to work his Will. For it was so handled, that
neither Prerogative, nor Profit went to Diminution. And yet as he would
sometimes strain up his Laws to his Prerogative, so would he also let
down his Prerogative to his Parliament. For Mint, and Wars, and Martial
Discipline, (things of absolute Power) he would nevertheless bring to
Parliament. Justice was well administred in his time, save where the
King was Party: Save also, that the CouncilTable intermedled too much
with Meum and Tuum. For it was a very Court of Justice during his time,
especially in the Beginning. But in that part both of Justice and
Policy, which is the Durable Part, and cut (as it were) in Brass or
Marble (which is The making of good Laws) he did excell. And with his
Justice, he was also a Merciful Prince, as in whose time, there were but
three of the Nobility that suffered; the Earl of Warwick, the Lord
Chamberlain, and the Lord Awdley. Though the first two were instead of
Numbers, in the Dislike and Obloquie of the People. But there were never
so great Rebellions, expiated with so little Blood, drawn by the hand of
Justice, as the two Rebellions of Black-heath and Exceter. As for the
Severity used upon those which were taken in Kent, it was but upon a
Scum of People. His Pardons went ever both before, and after his Sword.
But then he had withal a strange kind of Interchanging of large and
inexpected Pardons, with severe Executions. Which (his Wisdom
considered) could not be imputed to any Inconstancy, or Inequality; but
either to some Reason which we do not now know, or to a Principle he had
set unto himself, That he would vary, and try both ways in turn. But the
less Blood he drew, the more he took of Treasure. And (as some construed
it) he was the more sparing in the One, that he might be the more
pressing in the Other; for both would have been intolerable. Of Nature
assuredly he coveted to accumulate Treasure, and was a little Poor in
admiring Riches. The People (into whom there is infused, for the
preservation of Monarchies, a natural Desire to discharge their Princes,
though it be with the charge of their Counsellors and Ministers) did
impute this unto Cardinal Morton, and Sir Reginold Bray; who (as it
after appeared) as Counsellors of ancient Authority with him, did so
second his Humours, as nevertheless they did temper them. Whereas
Empson, and Dudley that followed, being Persons that had no Reputation
with him (otherwise than by the servile following of his Bent) did not
give way only (as the first did) but shape him way to those Extremities,
for which himself was touched with remorse at his Death, and which his
Successor renounced, and sought to purge. This Excess of his, had at
that time many Glosses and Interpretations. Some thought the continual
Rebellions wherewith he had been vexed, had made him grow to hate his
People. Some thought it was done to pull down their Stomachs, and to
keep them low. Some, for that he would leave his Son a Golden-fleece.
Some suspected he had some high Design upon Forein parts. But those
perhaps shall come nearest the truth, that fetch not their reasons so
far off; but rather impute it to Nature, Age, Peace, and a Mind fixed
upon no other. Ambition or Pursuit. Whereunto I should add, that having
every day Occasion to take notice of the Necessities and Shifts for
Money of other great Princes abroad, it did the better (by Comparison)
set off to him the Felicity of full Coffers. As to his expending of
Treasure, he never spared Charge which his Affairs required; and in his
Buildings was Magnificent, but his Rewards were very limited. So that
his Liberality was rather upon his own State and Memory, than upon the
Deserts of others.</p>
<p>He was of an High Mind, and loved his own Will, and his own Way; as
One that revered himself, and would Reign indeed. Had he been a
Private-man, he would have been termed Proud. But in a wise Prince, it
was but keeping of Distance, which indeed he did towards all; not
admitting any near or full Approach, neither to his Power or to his
Secrets. For he was governed by none. His Queen notwithstanding she had
presented him with divers Children, and with a Crown also, (though he
would not acknowledge it) could do nothing with him. His Mother he
reverenced much, heard little. For any Person agreeable to him for
Society (such as was Hastings to King Edward the Fourth, or Charles
Brandon after to King Henry the Eighth) he had none: Except we should
account for such Persons, Fox, and Bray, and Empson, because they were
so much with him. But it was but as the Instrument is much with the
Work-man. He had nothing in him of Vain-glory, but yet kept State and
Majesty to the height; Being sensible, That Majesty maketh the People
bow, but Vain-glory boweth to them.</p>
<p>To his Confederates abroad he was Constant and Just, but not Open.
But rather such was his Inquiry, and such his Closeness, as they stood
in the Light towards him, and he stood in the Dark to them. Yet without
Strangeness, but with a semblance of mutual Communication of Affairs. As
for little Envies or Emulations upon Forein Princes (which are frequent
with many Kings) he had never any; but went substantially to his own
Business. Certain it is, that though his Reputation was great at home,
yet it was greater abroad. For Foreiners that could not see the Passages
of Affairs, but made their Judgments upon the Issues of them, noted that
he was ever in Strife, and ever A-loft. It grew also from the Airs,
which the Princes and States abroad received from their Ambassadors and
Agents here; which were attending the Court in great number. Whom he did
not only content with Courtesie, Reward, and Privateness; but (upon such
Conferences as passed with them) put them in Admiration, to find his
Universal Insight into the Affairs of the World. Which though he did
suck chiefly from themselves; yet that which he had gathered from them
all, seemed Admirable to every one: So that they did write ever to their
Superiours in high terms, concerning his Wisdom and Art of Rule. Nay,
when they were returned, they did commonly maintain Intelligence with
him. Such a Dexterity he had to impropriate to himself all Forein
Instruments.</p>
<p>He was careful and liberal to obtain good Intelligence from all parts
abroad. Wherein he did not only use his Interest in the Liegers here,
and his Pensioners which he had both in the Court of Rome, and other the
Courts of Christendom; but the Industry and Vigilancy of his own
Ambassadors in Forein parts. For which purpose, his Instructions were
ever Extreme, Curious, and Articulate; and in them more Articles
touching Inquisition, than touching Negotiation. Requiring likewise from
his Ambassadors an Answer, in particular distinct Articles, respectively
to his Questions.</p>
<p>As for his secret Spials, which he did employ both at home and
abroad, by them to discover what Practices and Conspiracies were against
him, surely his Case required it: He had such Moles perpetually working
and casting to undermine him. Neither can it be reprehended. For if
Spials be lawful against lawful Enemies, much more against Conspirators
and Traytors. But indeed to give them Credence by Oaths or Curses, that
cannot be well maintained; for those are too holy Vestments for a
Disguise. Yet surely there was this further Good in his employing of
these Flies and Familiars; That as the use of them was cause that many
Conspiracies were revealed, so the Fame and Suspition of them kept (no
doubt) many Conspiracies from being attempted.</p>
<p>Towards his Queen he was nothing Uxorious, nor scarce Indulgent; but
Companiable, and Respective, and without Jealousie. Towards his Children
he was full of Paternal Affection, Careful of their Education, aspiring
to their High Advancement, regular to see that they should not want of
any due Honour and Respect, but not greatly willing to cast any Popular
Lustre upon them.</p>
<p>To his Council he did refer much, and sate oft in Person; knowing it
to be the Way to assist his Power, and inform his Judgment. In which
respect also he was fairly patient of Liberty, both of Advice, and of
Vote, till himself were declared. He kept a strait hand on his Nobility,
and chose rather to advance Clergy-men and Lawyers, which were more
Obsequious to him, but had less Interest in the People; which made for
his Absoluteness, but not for his Safety. In so much as (I am perswaded)
it was one of the Causes of his Troublesom Reign; for that his Nobles,
though they were Loyal and Obedient, yet did not Co-operate with him,
but let every man go his own Way. He was not afraid of an Able Man, as
Lewis the Eleventh was. But contrariwise, he was served by the Ablest
Men that were to be found; without which his Affairs could not have
prospered as they did. For War, Bedford, Oxford, Surrey, Dawbeney,
Brook, Poynings. For other Affairs, Morton, Fox, Bray, the Prior of
Lanthony, Warham, Urswick, Hussey, Frowick, and others. Neither did he
care how Cunning they were, that he did employ; For he thought himself
to have the Master-Reach. And as he chose well, so he held them up well.
For it is a strange thing, that though he were a Dark Prince, and
infinitely Suspitious, and his Times full of Secret Conspiracies and
Troubles; yet in Twenty-four Years Reign, he never put down, or
discomposed Counsellor, or near Servant, save only Stanley, the Lord
Chamberlain. As for the Disposition of his Subjects in General towards
him, it stood thus with him; That of the Three Affections, which
naturally tye the Hearts of the Subjects to their Sovereigns, Love,
Fear, and Reverence; he had the last in height, the second in good
measure, and so little of the first, as he was beholding to the other
Two.</p>
<p>He was a Prince, Sad, Serious, and full of Thoughts, and secret
Observations, and full of Notes and Memorials of his own hand,
especially touching Persons. As whom to Employ, whom to Reward, whom to
Enquire of, whom to Beware of, what were the Dependencies, what were the
Factions, and the like; keeping (as it were) a Journal of his Thoughts.
There is to this day a merry Tale; That his Monkey (set on as it was
thought by one of his Chamber) tore his Principal NoteBook all to
pieces, when by chance it lay forth. Whereat the Court (which liked not
those Pensive Accompts) was almost tickled with sport.</p>
<p>He was indeed full of Apprehensions and Suspitions. But as he did
easily take them, so he did easily check them, and master them: whereby
they were not dangerous, but troubled himself more than others. It is
true; his Thoughts were so many, as they could not well always stand
together; but that which did good one way, did hurt another. Neither did
he at some times weigh them aright in their proportions. Certainly, that
Rumour which did him so much mischief (That the Duke of York should be
saved, and alive) was (at the first) of his own nourishing; because he
would have more Reason not to reign in the Right of his Wife. He was
Affable, and both Well and Fair-spoken, and would use strange Sweetness
and Blandishments of Words, where he desired to effect or perswade any
thing that he took to heart. He was rather Studious than Learned;
reading most Books that were of any worth, in the French Tongue. Yet he
understood the Latin, as appeareth in that Cardinal Hadriah, and others,
who could very well have written French; did usu to write to him in
Latin.</p>
<p>For his Pleasures, there is no News of them. And yet by his
Instructions to Marsin and Stile, touching the Queen of Naples, it
seemeth he could Interrogate well touching Beauty. He did by Pleasures,
as great Princes do by Banquets, come and look a little upon them, and
turn away. For never Prince was more wholly given to his Affairs, nor in
them more of himself. In so much, as in Triumphs of Justs and Tourneys,
and Balls, and Masques (which they then called Disguises) he was rather
a Princely and Gentle Spectator, than seemed much to be delighted.</p>
<p>No doubt, in bine as in all men (and most of all in Kings) his
Fortune wrought upon his Nature, and his Nature upon his Fortune. He
attained to the Crown, not only from a private Fortune, which might
endow him with Moderation; but also from the Fortune of an Exiled Man,
which had quickned in him all Seeds of Observation and Industry. And his
Times being rather Prosperous, than Calm, had raised his Confidence by
Success, but almost marred his Nature by Troubles. His Wisdom, by often
evading from Perils, was turned rather into a Dexterity to deliver
himself from Dangers, when they pressed him, than into a Providence to
prevent and remove them a far off. And even in Nature, the Sight of his
Mind was like some Sights of Eyes; rather strong at hand, than to carry
a far off. For his Wit increased upon the Occasion; and so much the
more, if the Occasion were sharpened by Danger. Again, whether it were
the shortness of his Foresight, or the strength of his Will, or the
dazeling of his Suspitions, or what it was; Certain it is, that the
perpetual Troubles of his Fortunes (there being no more matter out of
which they grew) could not have been without some great Defects, and
main Errours in his Nature, Customs, and Proceedings, which he had
enough to do to save and help, with a thousand little Industries and
Watches. But those do best appear in the Story it self. Yet take him
with all his Defects if a Man should compare him with the Kings his
Concurrents, in France, and Spain, he shall find him more Politick than
Lewis the Twelfth of France, and more Entire and Sincere than Ferdinando
of Spain. But if you shall change Lewis the Twelfth, for Lewis the
Eleventh, who lived a little before; then the Consort is more perfect.
For that Lewis the Eleventh, Ferdinando, and Henry, may be esteemed for
the Tres Magi of Kings of those Ages. To conclude, If this King did no
greater matters, it was long of himself; for what he minded, he
compassed.</p>
<p>He was a Comely Personage, a little above Just Stature, well and
straight limmed, but slender. His Countenance was Reverend, and a little
like a Church-man: And as it was not strange or dark, so neither was it
Winning or Pleasing, but as the Face of one well disposed. But it was to
the Disadvantage of the Painter; for it was best when he spake.</p>
<p>His Worth may bear a Tale or two, that may put upon him somewhat that
may seem Divine. When the Lady Margaret his Mother had divers great
Suitors for Marriage, she dreamed one Night, That one in the likeness of
a Bishop, in Pontificial habit, did tender her Edmund Earl of Richmond
(the King’s Father) for her Husband. Neither had she ever any Child but
the King, though she had three Husbands. One day when King Henry the
Sixth, (whose Innocency gave him Holiness) was washing his hands at a
great Feast, and cast his Eye upon King Henry, then a young Youth, he
said; This is the Lad, that shall possess quietly that that we now
strive for. But that that was truly Divine in him, was, that he had the
Fortune of a True Christian, as well as of a Great King, in living
Exercised, and dying Repentant. So as he had an happy Warfare in both
Conflicts, both of Sin, and the Cross.</p>
<p>He was born at Pembrook-Castle, and lyeth buried at Westminster, in
one of the Stateliest and Daintiest Monuments of Europe, both for the
Chappel, and for the Sepulchre. So that he dwelleth more richly Dead, in
the Monument of his Tomb, than he did Alive in Richmond, or any of his
Palaces. I could wish he did the like, in this Monument of his Fame.</p>

<p>TO HIS VERY GOOD FRIEND, MR. GEORGE HERBERT.</p>
<p>The pains that it pleased you to take about some of my writings, I
cannot forget; which did put me in mind to dedicate to you this poor
exercise of my sickness. Besides, it being my manner for dedications, to
choose those that I hold most fit for the argument, I thought, that in
respect of divinity and poesy met, whereof the one is the matter, the
other the style of this little writing, I could not make better choice:
so, with signification of my love and acknowledgment, I ever rest</p>
<p>Your affectionate friend,</p>
<p>Fr. St. Alban</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE Ist PSALM.</p>
<p>Who never gave to wicked reed</p>
<p>A yielding and attentive car;</p>
<p>Who never sinners paths did tread,</p>
<p>Nor sat him down in scorner’s chair;</p>
<p>But maketh it his whole delight</p>
<p>On law of God to meditate;</p>
<p>And therein spendeth day and night:</p>
<p>That man is in a happy state.</p>
<p>He shall be like the fruitful tree,</p>
<p>Planted along a running spring,</p>
<p>Which, in due season, constantly</p>
<p>A goodly yield of fruit doth bring:</p>
<p>Whose leaves continue always green,</p>
<p>And are no prey to winter’s power:</p>
<p>So shall that man not once be seen</p>
<p>Surprised with an evil hour.</p>
<p>With wicked men it is not so,</p>
<p>Their lot is of another kind:</p>
<p>All as the chaff, which to and fro</p>
<p>Is toss’d at mercy of the wind.</p>
<p>And when he shall in judgment plead,</p>
<p>A casting sentence bide he must:</p>
<p>So shall he not lift up his head</p>
<p>In the assembly of the just.</p>
<p>For why? the Lord hath special eye</p>
<p>To be the godly’s stay at call:</p>
<p>And hath given over, righteously,</p>
<p>The wicked man to take his fall.</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE XIIth PSALM.</p>
<p>Help, Lord, for godly men have took their flight,</p>
<p>And left the earth to be the wicked’s den:</p>
<p>Not one that standeth fast to truth and right,</p>
<p>But fears, or seeks to please, the eyes of men.</p>
<p>When one with other falls in talk apart,</p>
<p>Their meaning go’th not with their words, in proof,</p>
<p>But fair they flatter, with a cloven heart,</p>
<p>By pleasing words, to work their own behoof.</p>
<p>But God cut off the lips, that are all set</p>
<p>To trap the harmless soul, that peace hath vow’d;</p>
<p>And pierce the tongues, that seek to counterfeit</p>
<p>The confidence of truth, by lying loud:</p>
<p>Yet so they think to reign, and work their will</p>
<p>By subtile speech, which enters everywhere;</p>
<p>And say: Our tongues are ours, to help us still;</p>
<p>What need we any higher pow’r to fear?</p>
<p>Now for the bitter sighing of the poor,</p>
<p>The Lord hath said, I will no more forbear</p>
<p>The wicked’s kingdom to invade and scour,</p>
<p>And set at large the men restrain’d in fear.</p>
<p>And sure the word of God is pure and fine,</p>
<p>And in the trial never loseth weight;</p>
<p>Like noble gold, which, since it left the mine,</p>
<p>Hath seven times pass’d through the fiery strait.</p>
<p>And now thou wilt not first thy word forsake,</p>
<p>Nor yet the righteous man that leans thereto;</p>
<p>But wilt his safe protection undertake,</p>
<p>In spite of all their force and wiles can do.</p>
<p>And time it is, O Lord, thou didst draw nigh;</p>
<p>The wicked daily do enlarge their bands;</p>
<p>And that which makes them follow ill a vie,</p>
<p>Rule is betaken to unworthy hands.</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE XCth PSALM.</p>
<p>O Lord, thou art our home, to whom we fly,</p>
<p>And so hast always been from age to age;</p>
<p>Before the hills did intercept the eye,</p>
<p>Or that the frame was up of earthly stage.</p>
<p>One God thou wert, and art, and still shalt be;</p>
<p>The line of time, it doth not measure thee.</p>
<p>Both death and life obey thy holy lore,</p>
<p>And visit in their turns, as they are sent;</p>
<p>A thousand years with thee they are no more</p>
<p>Than yesterday, which, ere it is, is spent:</p>
<p>Or as a watch by night, that course doth keep,</p>
<p>And goes, and comes, unwares to them that sleep.</p>
<p>Thou carryest man away as with a tide:</p>
<p>Then down swim all his thoughts that mounted high;</p>
<p>Much like a mocking dream, that will not bide,</p>
<p>But flies before the sight of waking eye;</p>
<p>Or as the grass, that cannot term obtain!</p>
<p>To see the summer come about again.</p>
<p>At morning, fair it musters on the ground;</p>
<p>At even it is cut down, and laid along:</p>
<p>And though it spared were, and favour found,</p>
<p>The weather would perform the mower’s wrong:</p>
<p>Thus hast thou hang’d our life on brittle pins,</p>
<p>To let us know it will not bear our sins.</p>
<p>Thou buryest not within oblivion’s tomb</p>
<p>Our trespasses, but enterest them aright;</p>
<p>Ev’n those that are conceived in darkness’ womb,</p>
<p>To thee appear as done at broad day-light.</p>
<p>As a tale told, which sometimes men attend,</p>
<p>And sometimes not, our life steals to an end.</p>
<p>The life of man is threescore years and ten,</p>
<p>Or, if that he be strong, perhaps fourscore;</p>
<p>Yet all things are but labour to him then,</p>
<p>New sorrows still come on, pleasures no more.</p>
<p>Why should there be such turmoil and such strife.</p>
<p>To spin in length this feeble line of life?</p>
<p>But who considers duly of thine ire?</p>
<p>Or doth the thoughts thereof wisely embrace?</p>
<p>For thou, O God, art a consuming fire:</p>
<p>Frail man, how can he stand before thy face?</p>
<p>If thy displeasure thou dost not refrain,</p>
<p>A moment brings all back to dust again.</p>
<p>Teach us, O Lord, to number well our days,</p>
<p>Thereby our hearts to wisdom to apply;</p>
<p>For that which guides man best in all his ways,</p>
<p>Is meditation of mortality.</p>
<p>This bubble light, this vapour of our breath,</p>
<p>Teach us to consecrate to hour of death.</p>
<p>Return unto us, Lord, and balance now,</p>
<p>With days of joy, our days of misery;</p>
<p>Help us right soon, our knees to thee we bow,</p>
<p>Depending wholly on thy clemency;</p>
<p>Then shall thy servants both with heart and voice,</p>
<p>All the days of their life in thee rejoice.</p>
<p>Begin thy work, O Lord, in this our age,</p>
<p>Shew it unto thy servants that now live;</p>
<p>But to our children raise it many a stage,</p>
<p>That all the world to thee may glory give.</p>
<p>Our handy-work likewise, as fruitful tree</p>
<p>Let it, O Lord, blessed, not blasted be.</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE CIVth PSALM.</p>
<p>Father and King of powers, both high and low,</p>
<p>Whose sounding fame all creatures serve to blow;</p>
<p>My soul shall with the rest strike up thy praise,</p>
<p>And carol of thy works and wondrous ways.</p>
<p>But who can blaze thy beauties, Lord, aright?</p>
<p>They turn the brittle beams of mortal sight.</p>
<p>Upon thy head thou wear’st a glorious crown,</p>
<p>All set with virtues, polish’d with renown:</p>
<p>Thence round about a silver veil doth fall</p>
<p>Of crystal light, mother of colours all.</p>
<p>The compass heaven, smooth without grain, or fold,</p>
<p>All set with spangs of glittering stars untold,</p>
<p>And striped with golden beams of power unpent,</p>
<p>Is raised up for a removing tent.</p>
<p>Vaulted and arched are his chamber beams</p>
<p>Upon the seas, the waters, and the streams:</p>
<p>The clouds as chariots swift do scour the sky;</p>
<p>The stormy winds upon their wings do fly.</p>
<p>His angels spirits are, that wait his will,</p>
<p>As flames of fire his anger they fulfil.</p>
<p>In the beginning, with a mighty hand,</p>
<p>He made the earth by counterpoise to stand,</p>
<p>Never to move, but to be fixed still;</p>
<p>Yet hath no pillars but his sacred will.</p>
<p>This earth, as with a veil, once cover’d was,</p>
<p>The waters over-flowed all the mass:</p>
<p>But upon his rebuke away they fled,</p>
<p>And then the hills began to show their head;</p>
<p>The vales their hollow bosoms open’d plain,</p>
<p>The streams ran trembling down the vales again:</p>
<p>And that the earth no more might drowned be,</p>
<p>He set the sea his bounds of liberty;</p>
<p>And though his waves resound, and beat the shore,</p>
<p>Yet it is bridled by his holy lore.</p>
<p>Then did the rivers seek their proper places,</p>
<p>And found their heads, their issues, and their races;</p>
<p>The springs do feed the rivers all the way,</p>
<p>And so the tribute to the sea repay:</p>
<p>Running along through many a pleasant field,</p>
<p>Much fruitfulness unto the earth they yield:</p>
<p>That know the beasts and cattle feeding by,</p>
<p>Which for to slake their thirst do thither hie.</p>
<p>Nay, desert grounds the streams do not forsake,</p>
<p>But through the unknown ways their journey take:</p>
<p>The asses wild, that hide in wilderness,</p>
<p>Do thither come, their thirst for to refresh.</p>
<p>The shady trees along their banks do spring,</p>
<p>In which the birds do build, and sit, and sing;</p>
<p>Stroking the gentle air with pleasant notes,</p>
<p>Plaining, or chirping through their warbling throats.</p>
<p>The higher grounds, where waters cannot rise,</p>
<p>By rain and dews are water’d from the skies;</p>
<p>Causing the earth put forth the grass for beasts,</p>
<p>And garden herbs, served at the greatest feasts;</p>
<p>And bread, that is all viands firmament,</p>
<p>And gives a firm and solid nourishment;</p>
<p>And wine, man’s spirits for to recreate;</p>
<p>And oil, his face for to exhilarate.</p>
<p>The sappy cedars, tall like stately towers,</p>
<p>High-flying birds do harbour in their bowers:</p>
<p>The holy storks, that are the travellers,</p>
<p>Choose for to dwell and build within the firs;</p>
<p>The climbing goats hang on steep mountains’ side;</p>
<p>The digging conies in the rocks do bide.</p>
<p>The moon, so constant in inconstancy,</p>
<p>Doth rule the monthly seasons orderly;</p>
<p>The sun, eye of the world, doth know his race,</p>
<p>And when to show, and when to hide his face.</p>
<p>Thou makest darkness, that it may be night,</p>
<p>When as the savage beasts, that fly the light,</p>
<p>As conscious of man’s hatred, leave their den,</p>
<p>And range abroad, secured from sight of men.</p>
<p>Then do the forests ring of lions roaring,</p>
<p>That ask their meat of God, their strength restoring;</p>
<p>But when the day appears, they back do fly,</p>
<p>And in their dens again do lurking lie.</p>
<p>Then man goes forth to labour in the field,</p>
<p>Whereby his grounds more rich increase may yield.</p>
<p>O Lord, thy providence sufficeth all;</p>
<p>Thy goodness, not restrained, but general</p>
<p>Over thy creatures: the whole earth doth flow</p>
<p>With thy great largess pour’d forth here below.</p>
<p>Nor is it earth alone exalts thy name,</p>
<p>But seas and streams likewise do spread the same.</p>
<p>The rolling seas unto the lot doth fall</p>
<p>Of beasts innumerable, great and small;</p>
<p>There do the stately ships plow up the floods,</p>
<p>The greater navies look like walking woods;</p>
<p>The fishes there far voyages do make,</p>
<p>To divers shores their journey they do take.</p>
<p>There hast thou set the great Leviathan,</p>
<p>That makes the seas to seeth like boiling pan.</p>
<p>All these do ask of thee their meat to live,</p>
<p>Which in due season thou to them dost give.</p>
<p>Ope thou thy hand, and then they have good fare;</p>
<p>Shut thou thy hand, and then they troubled are.</p>
<p>All life and spirit from thy breath proceed,</p>
<p>Thy word doth all things generate and feed.</p>
<p>If thou withdraw’st it, then they cease to be,</p>
<p>And straight return to dust and vanity;</p>
<p>But when thy breath thou dost send forth again,</p>
<p>Then all things do renew and spring amain;</p>
<p>So that the earth, but lately desolate,</p>
<p>Doth now return unto the former state.</p>
<p>The glorious majesty of God above</p>
<p>Shall ever reign in mercy and in love:</p>
<p>God shall rejoice all his fair works to see,</p>
<p>For as they come from him all perfect be.</p>
<p>The earth shall quake, if aught his wrath provoke;</p>
<p>Let him but touch the mountains, they shall smoke.</p>
<p>As long as life doth last I hymns will sing,</p>
<p>With cheerful voice, to the eternal King;</p>
<p>As long as I have being, I will praise</p>
<p>The works of God, and all his wondrous ways.</p>
<p>I know that he my words will not despise,</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is to him a sacrifice.</p>
<p>But as for sinners they shall be destroy’d</p>
<p>From off” the earth, their places shall be void.</p>
<p>Let all his works praise him with one accord;</p>
<p>O praise the Lord, my soul; praise ye the Lord!</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE CXXVIth PSALM</p>
<p>When God return’d us graciously</p>
<p>Unto our native land,</p>
<p>We seem’d as in a dream to be,</p>
<p>And in a maze to stand.</p>
<p>The heathen likewise they could say:</p>
<p>The God, that these men serve,</p>
<p>Hath done great things for them this day,</p>
<p>Their nation to preserve.</p>
<p>’Tis true; God hath pour’d out his grace</p>
<p>On us abundantly,</p>
<p>For which we yield him psalms and praise,</p>
<p>And thanks with jubilee.</p>
<p>O Lord, turn our captivity,</p>
<p>As winds, that blow at south,</p>
<p>Do pour the tides with violence</p>
<p>Back to the rivers mouth.</p>
<p>Who sows in tears shall reap in joy,</p>
<p>The Lord doth so ordain;</p>
<p>So that his seed be pure and good,</p>
<p>His harvest shall be gain.</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE CXXXVIIth PSALM.</p>
<p>When as we sat, all sad and desolate,</p>
<p>By Babylon upon the river’s side,</p>
<p>Easel from the tasks, which in our captive state</p>
<p>We were enforced daily to abide,</p>
<p>Our harps we had brought with us to the field,</p>
<p>Some solace to our heavy souls to yield.</p>
<p>But soon we found we fail’d of our account,</p>
<p>For when our minds some freedom did obtain,</p>
<p>Straightways the memory of Sion Mount</p>
<p>Did cause afresh our wounds to bleed again;</p>
<p>So that with present griefs, and future fears,</p>
<p>Our eyes burst forth into a stream of tears.</p>
<p>As for our harps, since sorrow struck them dumb,</p>
<p>We hang’d them on the willow-trees were near;</p>
<p>Yet did our cruel masters to us come,</p>
<p>Asking of us some Hebrew songs to hear:</p>
<p>Taunting us rather in our misery,</p>
<p>Than much delighting in our melody.</p>
<p>Alas, said we, who can once force or frame</p>
<p>His grieved and oppressed heart to sing</p>
<p>The praises of Jehovah’s glorious name,</p>
<p>In banishment, under a foreign king?</p>
<p>In Zion is his seat and dwelling-place,</p>
<p>Thence doth he show the brightness of his face.</p>
<p>Jerusalem, where God his throne hath set,</p>
<p>Shall any hour absent thee from my mind?</p>
<p>Then let my right-hand quite her skill forget,</p>
<p>Then let my voice and words no passage find;</p>
<p>Nay, if I do not thee prefer in all,</p>
<p>That in the compass of my thoughts can fall.</p>
<p>Remember thou, O Lord, the cruel cry</p>
<p>Of Edom’s children, which did ring and sound,</p>
<p>Inciting the Chaldean’s cruelty,</p>
<p>“Down with it, down with it, even unto the ground.”</p>
<p>In that good day repay it unto them,</p>
<p>When thou shalt visit thy Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And thou, O Babylon, shalt have thy turn</p>
<p>By just revenge, and happy shall he be,</p>
<p>That thy proud walls and tow’rs shall waste and burn,</p>
<p>And as thou didst by us, so do by thee.</p>
<p>Yea, happy he, that takes thy children’s bones,</p>
<p>And dasheth them against the pavement stones.</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE CXLIXth PSALM.</p>
<p>O Sing a new song to our God above,</p>
<p>Avoid prophane ones, ’tis for holy choir:</p>
<p>Let Israel sing songs of holy love</p>
<p>To him that made them, with their hearts on fire:</p>
<p>Let Zion’s sons lift up their voice and sing</p>
<p>Carols and anthems to their heavenly King.</p>
<p>Let not your voice alone his praise forth tell,</p>
<p>But move withal, and praise him in the dance;</p>
<p>Cymbals and harps let them be tuned well,</p>
<p>’Tis he that doth the poor’s estate advance:</p>
<p>Do this not only on the solemn days,</p>
<p>But on your secret beds your spirits raise.</p>
<p>O let the saints bear in their mouth his praise,</p>
<p>And a two-edged sword drawn in their hand,</p>
<p>Therewith for to revenge the former days</p>
<p>Upon all nations that their zeal withstand;</p>
<p>To bind their kings in chains of iron strong,</p>
<p>And manacle their nobles for their wrong.</p>
<p>Expect the time, for ’tis decreed in heaven,</p>
<p>Such honour shall unto his saints be given.</p>

<p>CATALOGUE OF PARTICULAR HISTORIES BY TITLES</p>
<p>Description of a Natural and Experimental History Such as May Serve
for the Foundation of a True Philosophy</p>
<p>My object in publishing my Instauration by parts is that some portion
of it may be put out of peril. A similar reason induces me to subjoin
here another small portion of the work, and to publish it along with
that which has just been set forth. This is the description and
delineation of a natural and experimental history, such as may serve to
build philosophy upon, and containing material true and copious and
aptly digested for the work of the interpreter which follows. The proper
place for it would be when I come in due course to the “Preparatives” of
Inquiry. I have thought it better, however, to introduce it at once
without waiting for that. For a history of this kind, such as I conceive
and shall presently describe, is a thing of very great size and cannot
be executed without great labor and expense, requiring as it does many
people to help, and being (as I have said elsewhere) a kind of royal
work. It occurs to me, therefore, that it may not be amiss to try if
there be any others who will take these matters in hand, so that while I
go on with the completion of my original design, this part which is so
manifold and laborious may even during my life (if it so please the
Divine Majesty) be prepared and set forth, others applying themselves
diligently to it along with me; the rather because my own strength (if I
should have no one to help me) is hardly equal to such a province. For
as much relates to the work itself of the intellect, I shall perhaps be
able to master that by myself; but the materials on which the intellect
has to work are so widely spread that one must employ factors and
merchants to go everywhere in search of them and bring them in. Besides
I hold it to be somewhat beneath the dignity of an undertaking like mine
that I should spend my own time in a matter which is open to almost
every man’s industry. That, however, which is the main part of the
matter I will myself now supply, by diligently and exactly setting forth
the method and description of a history of this kind, such as shall
satisfy my intention; lest men for want of warning set to work the wrong
way and guide themselves by the example of the natural histories now in
use, and so go far astray from my design. Meanwhile, what I have often
said I must here emphatically repeat: that if all the wits of all the
ages had met or shall hereafter meet together, if the whole human race
had applied or shall hereafter apply themselves to philosophy, and the
whole earth had been or shall be nothing but academies and colleges and
schools of learned men, still without a natural and experimental history
such as I am going to prescribe, no progress worthy of the human race
could have been made or can be made in philosophy and the sciences.
Whereas, on the other hand, let such a history be once provided and well
set forth, and let there be added to it such auxiliary and light-giving
experiments as in the very course of interpretation will present
themselves or will have to be found out, and the investigation of nature
and of all sciences will be the work of a few years. This, therefore,
must be done or the business must be given up. For in this way, and in
this way only, can the foundations of a true and active philosophy be
established; and then will men wake as from deep sleep, and at once
perceive what a difference there is between the dogmas and figments of
the wit and a true and active philosophy, and what it is in questions of
nature to consult nature herself.</p>
<p>First, then, I will give general precepts for the composition of this
history; then I will set out the particular figure of it, inserting
sometimes as well the purpose to which the inquiry is to be adapted and
referred as the particular point to be inquired in order that a good
understanding and forecast of the mark aimed at may suggest to men’s
minds other things also which I may perhaps have overlooked. This
history I call “Primary History,” or the “Mother History.”</p>
<p>Aphorisms on the Composition of the Primary History</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Nature exists in three states, and is subject, as it were, to three
kinds of regimen. Either she is free and develops herself in her own
ordinary course, or she is forced out of her proper state by the
perverseness and insubordination of matter and the violence of
impediments, or she is constrained and molded by art and human ministry.
The first state refers to the “species” of things; the second to
“monsters”; the third to “things artificial.” For in things artificial
nature takes orders from man and works under his authority; without man,
such things would never have been made. But by the help and ministry of
man a new face of bodies, another universe or theater of things, comes
into view. Natural history therefore is threefold. It treats of the
“liberty” of nature, or the “errors” of nature, or the “bonds” of
nature, so that we may fairly distribute it into history of
“generations,” of “pretergenerations,” and of “arts”; which last I also
call “mechanical” or “experimental” history. And yet I do not make it a
rule that these three should be kept apart and separately treated. For
why should not the history of the monsters in the several species be
joined with the history of the species themselves? And things artificial
again may sometimes be rightly joined with the species, though sometimes
they will be better kept separate. It will be best, therefore, to
consider these things as the case arises. For too much method produces
iterations and prolixity as well as none at all.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Natural history, which in its subject (as I said) is threefold, is in
its use twofold. For it is used either for the sake of the knowledge of
the particular things which it contains or as the primary material of
philosophy and the stuff and subject matter of true induction. And it is
this latter which is now in hand — now, I say, for the first time; nor
has it even been taken in hand till now. For neither Aristotle, nor
Theophrastus, nor Dioscorides, nor Gaius Plinius ever set this before
them as the end of natural history. And the chief part of the matter
rests in this, that they who shall hereafter take it upon them to write
natural history should bear this continually in mind — that they ought
not to consult the pleasure of the reader, no, nor even that utility
which may be derived immediately from their narrations, but to seek out
and gather together such store and variety of things as may suffice for
the formation of true axioms. Let them but remember this, and they will
find out for themselves the method in which the history should be
composed. For the end rules the method.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>But the more difficult and laborious the work is, the more ought it
to be discharged of matters superfluous. And therefore there are three
things upon which men should be warned to be sparing of their labor, as
those which will immensely increase the mass of the work and add little
or nothing to its worth.</p>
<p>First then, away with antiquities, and citations or testimonies of
authors, and also with disputes and controversies and differing opinions
— everything, in short, which is philological. Never cite an author
except in a matter of doubtful credit; never introduce a controversy
unless in a matter of great moment. And for all that concerns ornaments
of speech, similitudes, treasury of eloquence, and such like
emptinesses, let it be utterly dismissed. Also let all those things
which are admitted be themselves set down briefly and concisely, so that
they may be nothing less than words. For no man who is collecting and
storing up materials for ship building or the like, thinks of arranging
them elegantly, as in a shop, and displaying them so as to please the
eye; all his care is that they be sound and good, and that they be so
arranged as to take up as little room as possible in the warehouse. And
this is exactly what should be done here.</p>
<p>Secondly, that superfluity of natural histories in descriptions and
pictures of species, and the curious variety of the same, is not much to
the purpose. For small varieties of this kind are only a kind of sports
and wanton freaks of nature and come near to the nature of individuals.
They afford a pleasant recreation in wandering among them and looking at
them as objects in themselves, but the information they yield to the
sciences is slight and almost superfluous.</p>
<p>Thirdly, all superstitious stories (I do not say stories of
prodigies, when the report appears to be faithful and probable, but
superstitious stories) and experiments of ceremonial magic should be
altogether rejected. For I would not have the infancy of philosophy, to
which natural history is as a nursing mother, accustomed to old wives’
fables. The time will perhaps come (after we have gone somewhat deeper
into the investigation of nature) for a light review of things of this
kind, that if there remain any grains of natural virtue in these dregs,
they may be extracted and laid up for use. In the meantime they should
be set aside. Even the experiments of natural magic should be sifted
diligently and severely before they are received, especially those which
are commonly derived from vulgar sympathies and antipathies, with great
sloth and facility both of believing and inventing.</p>
<p>And it is no small thing to relieve natural history from the three
superfluities above mentioned, which would otherwise fill volumes. Nor
is this all. For in a great work it is no less necessary that what is
admitted should be written succinctly than that what is superfluous
should be rejected, though no doubt this kind of chastity and brevity
will give less pleasure both to the reader and the writer. But it is
always to be remembered that this which we are now about is only a
granary and storehouse of matters, not meant to be pleasant to stay or
live in, but only to be entered as occasion requires, when anything is
wanted for the work of the interpreter which follows.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>In the history which I require and design, special care is to be
taken that it be of wide range and made to the measure of the universe.
For the world is not to be narrowed till it will go into the
understanding (which has been done hitherto), but the understanding to
be expanded and opened till it can take in the image of the world as it
is in fact. For that fashion of taking few things into account, and
pronouncing with reference to a few things, has been the ruin of
everything. To resume then the divisions of natural history which I made
just now — viz., that it is a history of generations, Pretergenerations,
and arts — I divide the history of generations into five parts. The
first, of ether and things celestial. The second, of meteors and the
regions (as they call them) of air, viz., of the tracts which lie
between the moon and the surface of the earth; to which part also (for
order’s sake, however the truth of the thing may be) I assign comets of
whatever kind, both higher and lower. The third, of earth and sea. The
fourth, of the elements (as they call them), flame or fire, air, water,
earth, understanding, however, by elements, not the first principles of
things, but the greater masses of natural bodies. For the nature of
things is so distributed that the quantity or mass of some bodies in the
universe is very great, because their configurations require a texture
of matter easy and obvious, such as are those four bodies which I have
mentioned; while of certain other bodies the quantity is small and
weakly supplied, because the texture of matter which they require is
very complex and subtle, and for the most part determinate and organic,
such as are the species of natural things — metals, plants, animals.
Hence I call the former kind of bodies the “greater colleges,” the
latter the “lesser colleges.” Now the fourth part of the history is of
those greater colleges — under the name of elements, as I said. And let
it not be thought that I confound this fourth part with the second and
third, because in each of them I have mentioned air, water, and earth.
For the history of these enters into the second and third, as they are
integral parts of the world, and as they relate to the fabric and
configuration of the universe. But in the fourth is contained the
history of their own substance and nature, as it exists in their several
parts of uniform structure, and without reference to the whole. Lastly,
the fifth part of the history contains the lesser colleges, or species,
upon which natural history has hitherto been principally employed.</p>
<p>As for the history of pretergenerations, I have already said that it
may be most conveniently joined with the history of generations — I mean
the history of prodigies which are natural. For the superstitious
history of marvels (of whatever kind) I remit to a quite separate
treatise of its own; which treatise I do not wish to be undertaken now
at first, but a little after, when the investigation of nature has been
carried deeper.</p>
<p>History of arts, and of nature as changed and altered by man, or
experimental history, I divide into three. For it is drawn either from
mechanical arts, or from the operative part of the liberal arts, or from
a number of crafts and experiments which have not yet grown into an art
properly so called, and which sometimes indeed turn up in the course of
most ordinary experience and do not stand at all in need of art.</p>
<p>As soon, therefore, as a history has been completed of all these
things which I have mentioned — namely, generations, pretergenerations,
arts, and experiments, it seems that nothing will remain unprovided
whereby the sense can be equipped for information of the understanding.
And then shall we be no longer kept dancing within little rings, like
persons bewitched, but our range and circuit will be as wide as the
compass of the world.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Among the parts of history which I have mentioned, the history of
arts is of most use because it exhibits things in motion and leads more
directly to practice. Moreover, it takes off the mask and veil from
natural objects, which are commonly concealed and obscured under the
variety of shapes and external appearance. Finally, the vexations of art
are certainly as the bonds and handcuffs of Proteus, which betray the
ultimate struggles and efforts of matter. For bodies will not be
destroyed or annihilated, rather than that they will turn themselves
into various forms. Upon this history, therefore, mechanical and
illiberal as it may seem (all fineness and daintiness set aside), the
greatest diligence must be bestowed.</p>
<p>Again, among the particular arts those are to be preferred which
exhibit, alter, and prepare natural bodies and materials of things, such
as agriculture, cookery, chemistry, dyeing, the manufacture of glass,
enamel, sugar, gunpowder, artificial fires, paper, and the like. Those
which consist principally in the subtle motion of the hands or
instruments are of less use, such as weaving, carpentry, architecture,
manufacture of mills, clocks, and the like, although these too are by no
means to be neglected, both because many things occur in them which
relate to the alterations of natural bodies, and because they give
accurate information concerning local motion, which is a thing of great
importance in very many respects.</p>
<p>But in the whole collection of this history of arts it is especially
to be observed and constantly borne in mind that not only those
experiments in each art which serve the purpose of the art itself are to
be received, but likewise those which turn up anyhow by the way. For
example, that locusts or crabs, which were before of the color of mud,
turn red when baked is nothing to the table; but this very instance is
not a bad one for investigating the nature of redness, seeing that the
same thing happens in baked bricks. In like manner the fact that meat is
sooner salted in winter than in summer is not only important for the
cook that he may know how to regulate the pickling, but is likewise a
good instance for showing the nature and impression of cold. Therefore,
it would be an utter mistake to suppose that my intention would be
satisfied by a collection of experiments of arts made only with the view
of thereby bringing the several arts to greater perfection. For though
this be an object which in many cases I do not despise, yet my meaning
plainly is that all mechanical experiments should be as streams flowing
from all sides into the sea of philosophy. But how to select the more
important instances in every kind (which are principally and with the
greatest diligence to be sought and as it were hunted out) is a point to
be learned from the prerogatives of instances.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>In this place also is to be resumed that which in the 99th, 119th,
and 120th aphorisms of the first book I treated more at large, but which
it may be enough here to enjoin shortly by way of precept — namely, that
there are to be received into this history, first, things the most
ordinary, such as it might be thought superfluous to record in writing
because they are so familiarly known; secondly, things mean, illiberal,
filthy (for “to the pure all things are pure,” and if money obtained
from Vespasian’s tax smelt well, much more does light and information
from whatever source derived); thirdly, things trifling and childish
(and no wonder, for we are to become again as little children); and
lastly, things which seem over subtle, because they are in themselves of
no use. For the things which will be set forth in this history are not
collected (as I have already said) on their own account; and therefore
neither is their importance to be measured by what they are worth in
themselves, but according to their indirect bearing upon other things
and the influence they may have upon philosophy.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>Another precept is that everything relating both to bodies and
virtues in nature be set forth (as far as may be) numbered, weighed,
measured, defined. For it is works we are in pursuit of, not
speculations; and practical working comes of the due combination of
physics and mathematics. And therefore the exact revolutions and
distances of the planets — in the history of the heavenly bodies; the
compass of the land and the superficial space it occupies in comparison
of the waters — in the history of earth and sea; how much compression
air will bear without strong resistance — in the history of air; how
much one metal outweighs another — in the history of metals; and
numberless other particulars of that kind are to be ascertained and set
down. And when exact proportions cannot be obtained, then we must have
recourse to indefinite estimates and comparatives. As for instance (if
we happen to distrust the calculations of astronomers as to the
distances of the planets), that the moon is within the shadow of the
earth, that Mercury is beyond the moon, and the like. Also when mean
proportions cannot be had, let extremes be proposed, as that a weak
magnet will raise so many times its own weight of iron, while the most
powerful will raise sixty times its own weight (as I have myself seen in
the case of a very small armed magnet). I know well enough that these
definite instances do not occur readily or often, but that they must be
sought for as auxiliaries in the course of interpretation itself when
they are most wanted. But nevertheless if they present themselves
accidentally, provided they do not too much interrupt the progress of
the natural history, they should also be entered therein.</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>With regard to the credit of the things which are to be admitted into
the history, they must needs be either certainly true, doubtful whether
true or not, or certainly not true. Things of the first kind should be
set down simply; things of the second kind with a qualifying note, such
as “it is reported,” “they relate,” “I have heard from a person of
credit,” and the like. For to add the arguments on either side would be
too laborious and would certainly interrupt the writer too much. Nor is
it of much consequence to the business in hand because (as I have said
in the 118th aphorism of the first book) mistakes in experimenting,
unless they abound everywhere, will be presently detected and corrected
by the truth of axioms. And yet if the instance be of importance, either
from its own use or because many other things may depend upon it, then
certainly the name of the author should be given, and not the name
merely, but it should be mentioned withal whether he took it from
report, oral or written (as most of Pliny’s statements are), or rather
affirmed it of his own knowledge; also whether it was a thing which
happened in his own time or earlier; and again, whether it was a thing
of which, if it really happened, there must needs have been many
witnesses; and finally, whether the author was a vain-speaking and light
person or sober and severe; and the like points, which bear upon the
weight of the evidence. Lastly, things which though certainly not true
are yet current and much in men’s mouths, having either through neglect
or from the use of them in similitudes prevailed now for many ages (as
that the diamond binds the magnet, garlic weakens it, that amber
attracts everything except basil, and other things of that kind), these
it will not be enough to reject silently; they must be in express words
proscribed, that the sciences may be no more troubled with them.</p>
<p>Besides, it will not be amiss, when the source of any vanity or
credulity happens to present itself, to make a note of it, as, for
example, that the power of exciting Venus is ascribed to the herb
Satyrion because its root takes the shape of testicles — when the real
cause of this is that a fresh bulbous root grows upon it every year,
last year’s root still remaining; whence those twin bulbs. And it is
manifest that this is so, because the new root is always found to be
solid and succulent, the old withered and spongy. And therefore it is no
marvel if one sinks in water and the other swims — which nevertheless
goes for a wonder and has added credit to the other virtues ascribed to
this herb.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>XThere are also some things which may be usefully added to the
natural history, and which will make it fitter and more convenient for
the work of the interpreter, which follows. They are five.</p>
<p>First, questions (I do not mean as to causes but as to the fact)
should be added in order to provoke and stimulate further inquiry, as in
the history of earth and sea, whether the Caspian ebbs and flows, and at
how many hours’ interval; whether there is any southern continent or
only islands, and the like.</p>
<p>Secondly, in any new and more subtle experiment the manner in which
the experiment was conducted should be added, that men may be free to
judge for themselves whether the information obtained from that
experiment be trustworthy or fallacious, and also that men’s industry
may be roused to discover, if possible, methods more exact.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if in any statement there be anything doubtful or
questionable, I would by no means have it suppressed or passed in
silence, but plainly and perspicuously set down by way of note or
admonition. For I want this primary history to be compiled with a most
religious care, as if every particular were stated upon oath, seeing
that it is the book of God’s works and (so far as the majesty of
heavenly may be compared with the humbleness of earthly things) a kind
of second Scripture.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it would not be amiss to intersperse observations
occasionally, as Pliny has done; as in the history of earth and sea,
that the figure of the earth (as far as it is yet known) compared with
the seas is narrow and pointed toward the south, wide and broad toward
the north, the figure of the sea contrary; that the great oceans
intersect the earth in channels running north and south, not east and
west, except perhaps in the extreme polar regions. It is also very good
to add canons (which are nothing more than certain general and catholic
observations), as in the history of the heavenly bodies, that Venus is
never distant more than 46 parts from the sun, Mercury never more than
23, and that the planets which are placed above the sun move slowest
when they are furthest from the earth, those under the sun fastest.
Moreover, there is another kind of observation to be employed, which has
not yet come into use, though it be of no small importance. This is,
that to the enumeration of things which are should be subjoined an
enumeration of things which are not. As in the history of the heavenly
bodies, that there is not found any star oblong or triangular, but that
every star is globular — either globular simply, as the moon, or
apparently angular, but globular in the middle, as the other stars, or
apparently radiant but globular in the middle, as the sun — or that the
stars are scattered about the sky in no order at all, so that there is
not found among them either quincunx or square, or any other regular
figure (howsoever the names be given of Delta, Crown, Cross, Chariot,
etc.) scarcely so much as a straight line, except perhaps in the belt
and dagger of Orion.</p>
<p>Fifthly, that may perhaps be of some assistance to an inquirer which
is the ruin and destruction of a believer; viz., a brief review, as in
passage, of the opinions now received, with their varieties and sects,
that they may touch and rouse the intellect and no more.</p>
<p>XAnd this will be enough in the way of general precepts which, if
they be diligently observed, the work of the history will at once go
straight toward its object and be prevented from increasing beyond
bounds. But if even as here circumscribed and limited it should appear
to some poor-spirited person a vast work — let him turn to the
libraries; and there among other things let him look at the bodies of
civil and canonical law on one side, and at the commentaries of doctors
and lawyers on the other, and see what a difference there is between the
two in point of mass and volume. For we (who as faithful secretaries do
but enter and set down the laws themselves of nature and nothing else)
are content with brevity, and almost compelled to it by the condition of
things; whereas opinions, doctrines, and speculations are without number
and without end.</p>
<p>And whereas in the Plan of the Work I have spoken of the cardinal
virtues in nature, and said that a history of these must also be
collected and written before we come to the work of Interpretation, I
have not forgotten this, but I reserve this part for myself since until
men have begun to be somewhat more closely intimate with nature, I
cannot venture to rely very much on other people’s industry in that
matter.</p>
<p>And now should come the delineation of the particular histories. But
I have at present so many other things to do that I can only find time
to subjoin a Catalogue of their titles. As soon, however, as I have
leisure for it, I mean to draw up a set of questions on the several
subjects, and to explain what points with regard to each of the
histories are especially to be inquired and collected, as conducing to
the end I have in view — like a kind of particular topics. In other
words, I mean (according to the practice in civil causes) in this great
plea or suit granted by the divine favor and providence (whereby the
human race seeks to recover its right over nature), to examine nature
herself and the arts upon interrogatories.</p>

more convenient to investigate them with reference to arts, and to
arrange them with reference to bodies. For I care little about the
mechanical arts themselves: only about those things which they
contribute to the equipment of philosophy. But these things will be
better regulated as the case arises.</p>
<h2 id="new-atlantis">New Atlantis</h2>
<p>An incomplete utopian work of fiction, first published in 1627, New
Atlantis concerns a vision of the future of human discovery and
knowledge, expressing Bacon’s aspirations and ideals for humankind. The
text depicts the creation of a utopian land where “generosity and
enlightenment, dignity and splendour, piety and public spirit” are the
commonly held qualities of the inhabitants of the mythical Bensalem. The
narrative describes how the island is discovered by the crew of a
European ship after they are lost in the Pacific Ocean, somewhere west
of Peru.</p>
<p>Many aspects of the society and history of the island are described,
such as the Christian religion – which is reported to have been born
there as a copy of the Bible and a letter from the Apostle Saint
Bartholomew arrived there miraculously, a few years after the Ascension
of Jesus; a cultural feast in honour of the family institution, called
“the Feast of the Family”; a college of sages, the Salomon’s House, “the
very eye of the kingdom”, to which order “God of heaven and earth had
vouchsafed the grace to know the works of Creation, and the secrets of
them”, as well as “to discern between divine miracles, works of nature,
works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts”; and a series
of instruments, process and methods of scientific research that were
employed in the island by the Salomon’s House.</p>
<p>New Atlantis may have been Bacon’s vision for a Utopian New World in
North America. He portrays a land where there would be freedom of
religion – showing a Jew treated fairly and equally in an island of
Christians, but it has been debated whether this work had influenced
others reforms, such as greater rights for women, the abolition of
slavery, elimination of debtors’ prisons, separation of church and
state, and freedom of political expression, although there is no hint of
these reforms in the text itself. The author played a leading role in
creating the English colonies, especially in Virginia, the Carolinas,
and Newfoundland in north-eastern Canada.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>
<p>THE NEW ATLANTIS</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>
<p>Bacon’s literary executor, Dr. Rowley, published “The New Atlantis”
in 1627, the year after the author’s death. It seems to have been
written about 1623, during that period of literary activity which
followed Bacon’s political fall. None of Bacon’s writings gives in short
apace so vivid a picture of his tastes and aspirations as this fragment
of the plan of an ideal commonwealth. The generosity and enlightenment,
the dignity and splendor, the piety and public spirit, of the
inhabitants of Bensalem represent the ideal qualities which Bacon the
statesman desired rather than hoped to see characteristic of his own
country; and in Solomon’s House we have Bacon the scientist indulging
without restriction his prophetic vision of the future of human
knowledge. No reader acquainted in any degree with the processes and
results of modern scientific inquiry can fail to be struck by the
numerous approximations made by Bacon’s imagination to the actual
achievements of modern times. The plan and organization of his great
college lay down the main lines of the modern research university; and
both in pure and applied science he anticipates a strikingly large
number of recent inventions and discoveries. In still another way is
“The New Atlantis” typical of Bacon’s attitude. In spite of the
enthusiastic and broad-minded schemes he laid down for the pursuit of
truth, Bacon always had an eye to utility. The advancement of science
which he sought was conceived by him as a means to a practical end the
increase of man’s control over nature, and the comfort and convenience
of humanity. For pure metaphysics, or any form of abstract thinking that
yielded no “fruit,” he had little interest; and this leaning to the
useful is shown in the practical applications of the discoveries made by
the scholars of Solomon’s House. Nor does the interest of the work stop
here. It contains much, both in its political and in its scientific
ideals, that we have as yet by no means achieved, but which contain
valuable elements of suggestion and stimulus for the future.</p>
<p>THE NEW ATLANTIS</p>
<p>We sailed from Peru, (where we had continued for the space of one
whole year) for China and Japan, by the South Sea; taking with us
victuals for twelve months; and had good winds from the east, though
soft and weak, for five months space, and more. But the wind came about,
and settled in the west for many days, so as we could make little or no
way, and were sometime in purpose to turn back. But then again there
arose strong and great winds from the south, with a point east, which
carried us up (for all that we could do) towards the north; by which
time our victuals failed us, though we had made good spare of them. So
that finding ourselves, in the midst of the greatest wilderness of
waters in the world, without victuals, we gave ourselves for lost men
and prepared for death. Yet we did lift up our hearts and voices to God
above, who showeth his wonders in the deep, beseeching him of his mercy,
that as in the beginning he discovered the face of the deep, and brought
forth dry land, so he would now discover land to us, that we might not
perish.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that the next day about evening we saw within a
kenning before us, towards the north, as it were thick clouds, which did
put us in some hope of land; knowing how that part of the South Sea was
utterly unknown; and might have islands, or continents, that hitherto
were not come to light. Wherefore we bent our course thither, where we
saw the appearance of land, all that night; and in the dawning of the
next day, we might plainly discern that it was a land; flat to our
sight, and full of boscage; which made it show the more dark. And after
an hour and a half’s sailing, we entered into a good haven, being the
port of a fair city; not great indeed, but well built, and that gave a
pleasant view from the sea: and we thinking every minute long, till we
were on land, came close to the shore, and offered to land. But
straightways we saw divers of the people, with bastons in their hands
(as it were) forbidding us to land; yet without any cries of fierceness,
but only as warning us off, by signs that they made. Whereupon being not
a little discomforted, we were advising with ourselves, what we should
do.</p>
<p>During which time, there made forth to us a small boat, with about
eight persons in it; whereof one of them had in his hand a tipstaff of a
yellow cane, tipped at both ends with blue, who came aboard our ship,
without any show of distrust at all. And when he saw one of our number,
present himself somewhat before the rest, he drew forth a little scroll
of parchment (somewhat yellower than our parchment, and shining like the
leaves of writing tables, but otherwise soft and flexible,) and
delivered it to our foremost man. In which scroll were written in
ancient Hebrew, and in ancient Greek, and in good Latin of the school,
and in Spanish, these words: Land ye not, none of you; and provide to be
gone from this coast, within sixteen days, except you have further time
given you. Meanwhile, if you want fresh water or victuals, or help for
your sick, or that your ship needeth repairs, write down your wants, and
you shall have that, which belongeth to mercy. This scroll was signed
with a stamp of cherubim: wings, not spread, but hanging downwards; and
by them a cross. This being delivered, the officer returned, and left
only a servant with us to receive our answer.</p>
<p>Consulting hereupon amongst ourselves, we were much perplexed. The
denial of landing and hasty warning us away troubled us much; on the
other side, to find that the people had languages, and were so full of
humanity, did comfort us not a little. And above all, the sign of the
cross to that instrument was to us a great rejoicing, and as it were a
certain presage of good. Our answer was in the Spanish tongue; that for
our ship, it was well; for we had rather met with calms and contrary
winds than any tempests. For our sick, they were many, and in very ill
case; so that if they were not permitted to land, they ran danger of
their lives. Our other wants we set down in particular; adding, That we
had some little store of merchandise, which if it pleased them to deal
for, it might supply our wants, without being chargeable unto them. We
offered some reward in pistolets unto the servant, and a piece of
crimson velvet to be presented to the officer; but the servant took them
not, nor would scarce look upon them; and so left us, and went back in
another little boat, which was sent for him.</p>
<p>About three hours after we had dispatched our answer, there came
towards us a person (as it seemed) of place. He had on him a gown with
wide sleeves, of a kind of water chamolet, of an excellent azure colour,
fair more glossy than ours; his under apparel was green; and so was his
hat, being in the form of a turban, daintily made, and not so huge as
the Turkish turbans; and the locks of his hair came down below the brims
of it. A reverend man was he to behold. He came in a boat, gilt in some
part of it, with four persons more only in that boat; and was followed
by another boat, wherein were some twenty. When he was come within a
flightshot of our ship, signs were made to us, that we should send forth
some to meet him upon the water; which we presently did in our
ship-boat, sending the principal man amongst us save one, and four of
our number with him.</p>
<p>When we were come within six yards of their boat, they called to us
to stay, and not to approach farther; which we did. And thereupon the
man, whom I before described, stood up, and with a loud voice, in
Spanish, asked, “Are ye Christians?” We answered, “We were;” fearing the
less, because of the cross we had seen in the subscription. At which
answer the said person lifted up his right hand towards Heaven, and drew
it softly to his mouth (which is the gesture they use, when they thank
God;) and then said: “If ye will swear (all of you) by the merits of the
Saviour, that ye are no pirates, nor have shed blood, lawfully, nor
unlawfully within forty days past, you may have licence to come on
land.” We said, “We were all ready to take that oath.” Whereupon one of
those that were with him, being (as it seemed) a notary, made an entry
of this act. Which done, another of the attendants of the great person
which was with him in the same boat, after his Lord had spoken a little
to him, said aloud: “My Lord would have you know, that it is not of
pride, or greatness, that he cometh not aboard your ship; but for that
in your answer you declare that you have many sick amongst you, he was
warned by the Conservator of Health of the city that he should keep a
distance.” We bowed ourselves towards him, and answered, “We were his
humble servants; and accounted for great honour, and singular humanity
towards us, that which was already done; but hoped well, that the nature
of the sickness of our men was not infectious.” So he returned; and a
while after came the Notary to us aboard our ship; holding in his hand a
fruit of that country, like an orange, but of color between
orange-tawney and scarlet; which cast a most excellent odour. He used it
(as it seemeth) for a preservative against infection. He gave us our
oath; “By the name of Jesus, and his merits:” and after told us, that
the next day, by six of the Clock, in the Morning, we should be sent to,
and brought to the Strangers’ House, (so he called it,) where we should
be accommodated of things, both for our whole, and for our sick. So he
left us; and when we offered him some pistolets, he smiling said, “He
must not be twice paid for one labour:” meaning (as I take it) that he
had salary sufficient of the State for his service. For (as I after
learned) they call an officer that taketh rewards, “twice paid.”</p>
<p>The next morning early, there came to us the same officer that came
to us at first with his cane, and told us, He came to conduct us to the
Strangers’ House; and that he had prevented the hour, because we might
have the whole day before us, for our business. “For,” said he, “if you
will follow my advice, there shall first go with me some few of you, and
see the place, and how it may be made convenient for you; and then you
may send for your sick, and the rest of your number, which ye will bring
on land.” We thanked him, and said, “That this care, which he took of
desolate strangers, God would reward.” And so six of us went on land
with him: and when we were on land, he went before us, and turned to us,
and said, “He was but our servant, and our guide.” He led us through
three fair streets; and all the way we went, there were gathered some
people on both sides, standing in a row; but in so civil a fashion, as
if it had been, not to wonder at us, but to welcome us: and divers of
them, as we passed by them, put their arms a little abroad; which is
their gesture, when they did bid any welcome.</p>
<p>The Strangers’ House is a fair and spacious house, built of brick, of
somewhat a bluer colour than our brick; and with handsome windows, some
of glass, some of a kind of cambric oiled. He brought us first into a
fair parlour above stairs, and then asked us, “What number of persons we
were? And how many sick?” We answered, “We were in all, (sick and
whole,) one and fifty persons, whereof our sick were seventeen.” He
desired us to have patience a little, and to stay till he came back to
us; which was about an hour after; and then he led us to see the
chambers which were provided for us, being in number nineteen: they
having cast it (as it seemeth) that four of those chambers, which were
better than the rest, might receive four of the principal men of our
company; and lodge them alone by themselves; and the other fifteen
chambers were to lodge us two and two together. The chambers were
handsome and cheerful chambers, and furnished civilly. Then he led us to
a long gallery, like a dorture, where he showed us all along the one
side (for the other side was but wall and window), seventeen cells, very
neat ones, having partitions of cedar wood. Which gallery and cells,
being in all forty, many more than we needed, were instituted as an
infirmary for sick persons. And he told us withal, that as any of our
sick waxed well, he might be removed from his cell, to a chamber; for
which purpose there were set forth ten spare chambers, besides the
number we spake of before. This done, he brought us back to the parlour,
and lifting up his cane a little, (as they do when they give any charge
or command) said to us, “Ye are to know, that the custom of the land
requireth, that after this day and to-morrow, (which we give you for
removing of your people from your ship,) you are to keep within doors
for three days. But let it not trouble you, nor do not think yourselves
restrained, but rather left to your rest and ease. You shall want
nothing, and there are six of our people appointed to attend you, for
any business you may have abroad.” We gave him thanks, with all
affection and respect, and said, “God surely is manifested in this
land.” We offered him also twenty pistolets; but he smiled, and only
said; “What? twice paid!” And so he left us.</p>
<p>Soon after our dinner was served in; which was right good viands,
both for bread and treat: better than any collegiate diet, that I have
known in Europe. We had also drink of three sorts, all wholesome and
good; wine of the grape; a drink of grain, such as is with us our ale,
but more clear: And a kind of cider made of a fruit of that country; a
wonderful pleasing and refreshing drink. Besides, there were brought in
to us, great store of those scarlet oranges, for our sick; which (they
said) were an assured remedy for sickness taken at sea. There was given
us also, a box of small gray, or whitish pills, which they wished our
sick should take, one of the pills, every night before sleep; which
(they said) would hasten their recovery.</p>
<p>The next day, after that our trouble of carriage and removing of our
men and goods out of our ship, was somewhat settled and quiet, I thought
good to call our company together; and when they were assembled, said
unto them; “My dear friends, let us know ourselves, and how it standeth
with us. We are men cast on land, as Jonas was, out of the whale’s
belly, when we were as buried in the deep: and now we are on land, we
are but between death and life; for we are beyond, both the old world,
and the new; and whether ever we shall see Europe, God only knoweth. It
is a kind of miracle bath brought us hither: and it must be little less,
that shall bring us hence. Therefore in regard of our deliverance past,
and our danger present, and to come, let us look up to God, and every
man reform his own ways. Besides we are come here amongst a Christian
people, full of piety and humanity: let us not bring that confusion of
face upon ourselves, as to show our vices, or unworthiness before them.
Yet there is more. For they have by commandment, (though in form of
courtesy) cloistered us within these wall, for three days: who knoweth,
whether it be not, to take some taste of our manners and conditions? And
if they find them bad, to banish us straightways; if good, to give us
further time. For these men that they have given us for attendance, may
withal have an eye upon us. Therefore for God’s love, and as we love the
weal of our souls and bodies, let us so behave ourselves, as we may be
at peace with God, and may find grace in the eyes of this people.” Our
company with one voice thanked me for my good admonition, and promised
me to live soberly and civilly, and without giving any the least
occasion of offence. So we spent our three days joyfully, and without
care, in expectation what would be done with us, when they were expired.
During which time, we had every hour joy of the amendment of our sick;
who thought themselves cast into some divine pool of healing; they
mended so kindly, and so fast.</p>
<p>The morrow after our three days were past, there came to us a new
man, that we had not seen before, clothed in blue as the former was,
save that his turban was white, with a small red cross on the top. He
had also a tippet of fine linen. At his coming in, he did bend to us a
little, and put his arms abroad. We of our parts saluted him in a very
lowly and submissive manner; as looking that from him, we should receive
sentence of life, or death: he desired to speak with some few of us:
whereupon six of us only staid, and the rest avoided the room. He said,
“I am by office governor of this House of Strangers, and by vocation I
am a Christian priest: and therefore am come to you to offer you my
service, both as strangers and chiefly as Christians. Some things I may
tell you, which I think you will not be unwilling to hear. The State
hath given you license to stay on land, for the space of six weeks; and
let it not trouble you, if your occasions ask further time, for the law
in this point is not precise; and I do not doubt, but my self shall be
able, to obtain for you such further time, as may be convenient. Ye
shall also understand, that the Strangers’ House is at this time rich,
and much aforehand; for it hath laid up revenue these thirty-seven
years; for so long it is since any stranger arrived in this part: and
therefore take ye no care; the State will defray you all the time you
stay; neither shall you stay one day the less for that. As for any
merchandise ye have brought, ye shall be well used, and have your
return, either in merchandise, or in gold and silver: for to us it is
all one. And if you have any other request to make, hide it not. For ye
shall find we will not make your countenance to fall by the answer ye
shall receive. Only this I must tell you, that none of you must go above
a karan,” (that is with them a mile and an half) “from the walls of the
city, without especial leave.”</p>
<p>We answered, after we had looked awhile one upon another, admiring
this gracious and parent-like usage; “That we could not tell what to
say: for we wanted words to express our thanks; and his noble free
offers left us nothing to ask. It seemed to us, that we had before us a
picture of our salvation in Heaven; for we that were a while since in
the jaws of death, were now brought into a place, where we found nothing
but consolations. For the commandment laid upon us, we would not fail to
obey it, though it was impossible but our hearts should be enflamed to
tread further upon this happy and holy ground.” We added, “That our
tongues should first cleave to the roofs of our mouths, ere we should
forget, either his reverend person, or this whole nation, in our
prayers.” We also most humbly besought him, to accept of us as his true
servants; by as just a right as ever men on earth were bounden; laying
and presenting, both our persons, and all we had, at his feet. He said;
“He was a priest, and looked for a priest’s reward; which was our
brotherly love, and the good of our souls and bodies.” So he went from
us, not without tears of tenderness in his eyes; and left us also
confused with joy and kindness, saying amongst ourselves; “That we were
come into a land of angels, which did appear to us daily, and prevent us
with comforts, which we thought not of, much less expected.”</p>
<p>The next day about ten of the clock, the Governor came to us again,
and after salutations, said familiarly; “That he was come to visit us;”
and called for a chair, and sat him down: and we, being some ten of us,
(the rest were of the meaner sort, or else gone abroad,) sat down with
him, And when we were set, he began thus: “We of this island of
Bensalem,” (for so they call it in their language,) “have this; that by
means of our solitary situation; and of the laws of secrecy, which we
have for our travellers, and our rare admission of strangers; we know
well most part of the habitable world, and are ourselves unknown.
Therefore because he that knoweth least is fittest to ask questions, it
is more reason, for the entertainment of the time, that ye ask me
questions, than that I ask you.”</p>
<p>We answered; “That we humbly thanked him that he would give us leave
so to do: and that we conceived by the taste we had already, that there
was no worldly thing on earth, more worthy to be known than the state of
that happy land. But above all,” (we said,) “since that we were met from
the several ends of the world, and hoped assuredly that we should meet
one day in the kingdom of Heaven, (for that we were both parts
Christians,) we desired to know, (in respect that land was so remote,
and so divided by vast and unknown seas, from the land where our Saviour
walked on earth,) who was the apostle of that nation, and how it was
converted to the faith?” It appeared in his face that he took great
contentment in this our question: he said; “Ye knit my heart to you, by
asking this question in the first place; for it sheweth that you first
seek the kingdom of heaven; and I shall gladly, and briefly, satisfy
your demand.</p>
<p>“About twenty years after the ascension of our Saviour, it came to
pass, that there was seen by the people of Renfusa, (a city upon the
eastern coast of our island,) within night, (the night was cloudy, and
calm,) as it might be some mile into the sea, a great pillar of light;
not sharp, but in form of a column, or cylinder, rising from the sea a
great way up towards heaven; and on the top of it was seen a large cross
of light, more bright and resplendent than the body of the pillar. Upon
which so strange a spectacle, the people of the city gathered apace
together upon the sands, to wonder; and so after put themselves into a
number of small boats, to go nearer to this marvellous sight. But when
the boats were come within (about) sixty yards of the pillar, they found
themselves all bound, and could go no further; yet so as they might move
to go about, but might not approach nearer: so as the boats stood all as
in a theatre, beholding this light as an heavenly sign. It so fell out,
that there was in one of the boats one of the wise men, of the society
of Salomon’s House; which house, or college (my good brethren) is the
very eye of this kingdom; who having awhile attentively and devoutly
viewed and contemplated this pillar and cross, fell down upon his face;
and then raised himself upon his knees, and lifting up his hands to
heaven, made his prayers in this manner.</p>
<p>“‘LORD God of heaven and earth, thou hast vouchsafed of thy grace to
those of our order, to know thy works of Creation, and the secrets of
them: and to discern (as far as appertaineth to the generations of men)
between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures
and illusions of all sorts. I do here acknowledge and testify before
this people, that the thing which we now see before our eyes is thy
Finger and a true Miracle. And forasmuch as we learn in our books that
thou never workest miracles, but to divine and excellent end, (for the
laws of nature are thine own laws, and thou exceedest them not but upon
great cause,) we most humbly beseech thee to prosper this great sign,
and to give us the interpretation and use of it in mercy; which thou
dost in some part secretly promise by sending it unto us.’</p>
<p>“When he had made his prayer, he presently found the boat he was in,
moveable and unbound; whereas all the rest remained still fast; and
taking that for an assurance of leave to approach, he caused the boat to
be softly and with silence rowed towards the pillar. But ere he came
near it, the pillar and cross of light brake up, and cast itself abroad,
as it were, into a firmament of many stars; which also vanished soon
after, and there was nothing left to be seen, but a small ark, or chest
of cedar, dry, and not wet at all with water, though it swam. And in the
fore-end of it, which was towards him, grew a small green branch of
palm; and when the wise man had taken it, with all reverence, into his
boat, it opened of itself, and there were found in it a Book and a
Letter; both written in fine parchment, and wrapped in sindons of linen.
The Book contained all the canonical books of the Old and New Testament,
according as you have them; (for we know well what the churches with you
receive); and the Apocalypse itself, and some other books of the New
Testament, which were not at that time written, were nevertheless in the
Book. And for the Letter, it was in these words:</p>
<p>“‘I, Bartholomew, a servant of the Highest, and Apostle of Jesus
Christ, was warned by an angel that appeareth to me, in a vision of
glory, that I should commit this ark to the floods of the sea. Therefore
I do testify and declare unto that people where God shall ordain this
ark to come to land, that in the same day is come unto them salvation
and peace and good-will, from the Father, and from the Lord Jesus.’</p>
<p>“There was also in both these writings, as well the Book, as the
Letter, wrought a great miracle, conform to that of the Apostles, in the
original Gift of Tongues. For there being at that time in this land
Hebrews, Persians, and Indians, besides the natives, every one read upon
the Book, and Letter, as if they had been written in his own language.
And thus was this land saved from infidelity (as the remainder of the
old world was from water) by an ark, through the apostolical and
miraculous evangelism of Saint Bartholomew.” And here he paused, and a
messenger came, and called him from us. So this was all that passed in
that conference.</p>
<p>The next day, the same governor came again to us, immediately after
dinner, and excused himself, saying; “That the day before he was called
from us, somewhat abruptly, but now he would make us amends, and spend
time with us if we held his company and conference agreeable.” We
answered, “That we held it so agreeable and pleasing to us, as we forgot
both dangers past and fears to come, for the time we hear him speak; and
that we thought an hour spent with him, was worth years of our former
life.” He bowed himself a little to us, and after we were set again, he
said; “Well, the questions are on your part.”</p>
<p>One of our number said, after a little pause; that there was a
matter, we were no less desirous to know, than fearful to ask, lest we
might presume too far. But encouraged by his rare humanity towards us,
(that could scarce think ourselves strangers, being his vowed and
professed servants,) we would take the hardiness to propound it: humbly
beseeching him, if he thought it not fit to be answered, that he would
pardon it, though he rejected it. We said; “We well observed those his
words, which he formerly spake, that this happy island, where we now
stood, was known to few, and yet knew most of the nations of the world;
which we found to be true, considering they had the languages of Europe,
and knew much of our state and business; and yet we in Europe,
(notwithstanding all the remote discoveries and navigations of this last
age), never heard of the least inkling or glimpse of this island. This
we found wonderful strange; for that all nations have inter-knowledge
one of another, either by voyage into foreign parts, or by strangers
that come to them: and though the traveller into a foreign country, doth
commonly know more by the eye, than he that stayeth at home can by
relation of the traveller; yet both ways suffice to make a mutual
knowledge, in some degree, on both parts. But for this island, we never
heard tell of any ship of theirs that had been seen to arrive upon any
shore of Europe; nor of either the East or West Indies; nor yet of any
ship of any other part of the world, that had made return from them. And
yet the marvel rested not in this. For the situation of it (as his
lordship said) in the secret conclave’ of such a vast sea might cause
it. But then, that they should have knowledge of the languages, books,
affairs, of those that lie such a distance from them, it was a thing we
could not tell what to make of; for that it seemed to us a conditioner
and propriety of divine powers and beings, to be hidden and unseen to
others, and yet to have others open and as in a light to them.”</p>
<p>At this speech the Governor gave a gracious smile, and said; “That we
did well to ask pardon for this question we now asked: for that it
imported, as if we thought this land, a land of magicians, that sent
forth spirits of the air into all parts, to bring them news and
intelligence of other countries.” It was answered by us all, in all
possible humbleness, but yet with a countenance taking knowledge, that
we knew that he spake it but merrily, “That we were apt enough to think
there was somewhat supernatural in this island; but yet rather as
angelical than magical. But to let his lordship know truly what it was
that made us tender and doubtful to ask this question, it was not any
such conceit, but because we remembered, he had given a touch in his
former speech, that this land had laws of secrecy touching strangers.”
To this he said; “You remember it aright and therefore in that I shall
say to you, I must reserve some particulars, which it is not lawful for
me to reveal; but there will be enough left, to give you
satisfaction.”</p>
<p>“You shall understand (that which perhaps you will scarce think
credible) that about three thousand years ago, or somewhat more, the
navigation of the world, (especially for remote voyages,) was greater
than at this day. Do not think with yourselves, that I know not how much
it is increased with you, within these six-score years: I know it well:
and yet I say greater then than now; whether it was, that the example of
the ark, that saved the remnant of men from the universal deluge, gave
men confidence to adventure upon the waters; or what it was; but such is
the truth. The Phoenicians, and especially the Tyrians, had great
fleets. So had the Carthaginians their colony, which is yet further
west. Toward the east the shipping of Egypt and of Palestine was
likewise great. China also, and the great Atlantis, (that you call
America,) which have now but junks and canoes, abounded then in tall
ships. This island, (as appeareth by faithful registers of those times,)
had then fifteen hundred strong ships, of great content. Of all this,
there is with you sparing memory, or none; but we have large knowledge
thereof.</p>
<p>“At that time, this land was known and frequented by the ships and
vessels of all the nations before named. And (as it cometh to pass) they
had many times men of other countries, that were no sailors, that came
with them; as Persians, Chaldeans, Arabians; so as almost all nations of
might and fame resorted hither; of whom we have some stirps, and little
tribes with us at this day. And for our own ships, they went sundry
voyages, as well to your straits, which you call the Pillars of
Hercules, as to other parts in the Atlantic and Mediterrane Seas; as to
Paguin, (which is the same with Cambaline,) and Quinzy, upon the
Oriental Seas, as far as to the borders of the East Tartary.</p>
<p>“At the same time, and an age after, or more, the inhabitants of the
great Atlantis did flourish. For though the narration and description,
which is made by a great man with you; that the descendants of Neptune
planted there; and of the magnificent temple, palace, city, and hill;
and the manifold streams of goodly navigable rivers, (which as so many
chains environed the same site and temple); and the several degrees of
ascent, whereby men did climb up to the same, as if it had been a scala
coeli, be all poetical and fabulous: yet so much is true, that the said
country of Atlantis, as well that of Peru, then called Coya, as that of
Mexico, then named Tyrambel, were mighty and proud kingdoms in arms,
shipping and riches: so mighty, as at one time (or at least within the
space of ten years) they both made two great expeditions; they of
Tyrambel through the Atlantic to the Mediterrane Sea; and they of Coya
through the South Sea upon this our island: and for the former of these,
which was into Europe, the same author amongst you (as it seemeth) had
some relation from the Egyptian priest whom he cited. For assuredly such
a thing there was. But whether it were the ancient Athenians that had
the glory of the repulse and resistance of those forces, I can say
nothing: but certain it is, there never came back either ship or man
from that voyage. Neither had the other voyage of those of Coya upon us
had better fortune, if they had not met with enemies of greater
clemency. For the king of this island, (by name Altabin,) a wise man and
a great warrior, knowing well both his own strength and that of his
enemies, handled the matter so, as he cut off their land-forces from
their ships; and entoiled both their navy and their tamp with a greater
power than theirs, both by sea and land: arid compelled them to render
themselves without striking stroke and after they were at his mercy,
contenting himself only with their oath that they should no more bear
arms against him, dismissed them all in safety.</p>
<p>“But the divine revenge overtook not long after those proud
enterprises. For within less than the space of one hundred years, the
great Atlantis was utterly lost and destroyed: not by a great
earthquake, as your man saith; (for that whole tract is little subject
to earthquakes;) but by a particular’ deluge or inundation; those
countries having, at this day, far greater rivers and far higher
mountains to pour down waters, than any part of the old world. But it is
true that the same inundation was not deep; not past forty foot, in most
places, from the ground; so that although it destroyed man and beast
generally, yet some few wild inhabitants of the wood escaped. Birds also
were saved by flying to the high trees and woods. For as for men,
although they had buildings in many places, higher than the depth of the
water, yet that inundation, though it were shallow, had a long
continuance; whereby they of the vale that were not drowned, perished
for want of food and other things necessary.</p>
<p>“So as marvel you not at the thin population of America, nor at the
rudeness and ignorance of the people; for you must account your
inhabitants of America as a young people; younger a thousand years, at
the least, than the rest of the world: for that there was so much time
between the universal flood and their particular inundation. For the
poor remnant of human seed, which remained in their mountains, peopled
the country again slowly, by little and little; and being simple and
savage people, (not like Noah and his sons, which was the chief family
of the earth;) they were not able to leave letters, arts, and civility
to their posterity; and having likewise in their mountainous habitations
been used (in respect of the extreme cold of those regions) to clothe
themselves with the skins of tigers, bears, and great hairy goats, that
they have in those parts; when after they came down into the valley, and
found the intolerable heats which are there, and knew no means of
lighter apparel, they were forced to begin the custom of going naked,
which continueth at this day. Only they take great pride and delight in
the feathers of birds; and this also they took from those their
ancestors of the mountains, who were invited unto it by the infinite
flights of birds that came up to the high grounds, while the waters
stood below. So you see, by this main accident of time, we lost our
traffic with the Americans, with whom of, all others, in regard they lay
nearest to us, we had most commerce.</p>
<p>“As for the other parts of the world, it is most manifest that in the
ages following (whether it were in respect of wars, or by a natural
revolution of time,) navigation did every where greatly decay; and
specially far voyages (the rather by the use of galleys, and such
vessels as could hardly brook the ocean,) were altogether left and
omitted. So then, that part of intercourse which could be from other
nations to sail to us, you see how it hath long since ceased; except it
were by some rare accident, as this of yours. But now of the cessation
of that other part of intercourse, which might be by our sailing to
other nations, I must yield you some other cause. For I cannot say (if I
shall say truly,) but our shipping, for number, strength, mariners,
pilots, and all things that appertain to navigation, is as great as
ever; and therefore why we should sit at home, I shall now give you an
account by itself: and it will draw nearer to give you satisfaction to
your principal question.</p>
<p>“There reigned in this land, about nineteen hundred years ago, a
king, whose memory of all others we most adore; not superstitiously, but
as a divine instrument, though a mortal man; his name was Solamona: and
we esteem him as the lawgiver of our nation. This king had a large
heart, inscrutable for good; and was wholly bent to make his kingdom and
people happy. He therefore, taking into consideration how sufficient and
substantive this land was to maintain itself without any aid (at all) of
the foreigner; being five thousand six hundred miles in circuit, and of
rare fertility of soil in the greatest part thereof; and finding also
the shipping of this country might be plentifully set on work, both by
fishing and by transportations from port to port, and likewise by
sailing unto some small islands that are not far from us, and are under
the crown and laws of this state; and, recalling into his memory the
happy and flourishing estate wherein this land then was; so as it might
be a thousand ways altered to the worse, but scarce any one way to the
better; thought nothing wanted to his noble and heroical intentions, but
only (as far as human foresight might reach) to give perpetuity to that
which was in his time so happily established. Therefore amongst his
other fundamental laws of this kingdom, he did ordain the interdicts and
prohibitions which we have touching entrance of strangers; which at that
time (though it was after the calamity of America) was frequent;
doubting novelties, and commixture of manners. It is true, the like law
against the admission of strangers without licence is an ancient law in
the kingdom of China, and yet continued in use. But there it is a poor
thing; and hath made them a curious, ignorant, fearful, foolish nation.
But our lawgiver made his law of another temper. For first, he hath
preserved all points of humanity, in taking order and making provision
for the relief of strangers distressed; whereof you have tasted.”</p>
<p>At which speech (as reason was) we all rose up and bowed ourselves.
He went on.</p>
<p>“That king also, still desiring to join humanity and policy together;
and thinking it against humanity, to detain strangers here against their
wills, and against policy that they should return and discover their
knowledge of this estate, he took this course: he did ordain that of the
strangers that should be permitted to land, as many (at all times) might
depart as would; but as many as would stay should have very good
conditions and means to live from the state. Wherein he saw so far, that
now in so many ages since the prohibition, we have memory not of one
ship that ever returned, and but of thirteen persons only, at several
times, that chose to return in our bottoms. What those few that returned
may have reported abroad I know not. But you must think, whatsoever they
have said could be taken where they came but for a dream. Now for our
travelling from henna into parts abroad, our Lawgiver thought fit
altogether to restrain it. So is it not in China. For the Chinese sail
where they will or can; which sheweth that their law of keeping out
strangers is a law of pusillanimity and fear. But this restraint of ours
hath one only exception, which is admirable; preserving the good which
cometh by communicating with strangers, and avoiding the hurt; and I
will now open it to you. And here I shall seem a little to digress, but
you will by and by find it pertinent.</p>
<p>“Ye shall understand (my dear friends) that amongst the excellent
acts of that king, one above all hath the pre-eminence. It was the
erection and institution of an Order or Society, which we call Salomon’s
House; the noblest foundation (as we think) that ever was upon the
earth; and the lanthorn of this kingdom. It is dedicated to the study of
the works and creatures of God. Some think it beareth the founder’s name
a little corrupted, as if it should be Solamona’s House. But the records
write it as it is spoken. So as I take it to be denominate of the king
of the Hebrews, which is famous with you, and no stranger to us. For we
have some parts of his works, which with you are lost; namely, that
natural history, which he wrote, of all plants, from the cedar of
Libanus to the moss that groweth out of the wall, and of all things that
have life and motion. This maketh me think that our king, finding
himself to symbolize in many things with that king of the Hebrews (which
lived many years before him), honored him with the title of this
foundation. And I am rather induced to be of this opinion, for that I
find in ancient records this Order or Society is sometimes called
Salomon’s House, and sometimes the College of the Six Days Works;
whereby I am satisfied that our excellent king had learned from the
Hebrews that God had created the world and all that therein is within
six days: and therefore he instituting that House for the finding out of
the true nature of all things, (whereby God might have the more glory in
the workmanship of them, and insert the more fruit in the use of them),
did give it also that second name.</p>
<p>“But now to come to our present purpose. When the king had forbidden
to all his people navigation into any part that was not under his crown,
he made nevertheless this ordinance; that every twelve years there
should be set forth, out of this kingdom two ships, appointed to several
voyages; That in either of these ships there should be a mission of
three of the Fellows or Brethren of Salomon’s House; whose errand was
only to give us knowledge of the affairs and state of those countries to
which they were designed, and especially of the sciences, arts,
manufactures, and inventions of all the world; and withal to bring unto
us books, instruments, and patterns in every kind: That the ships, after
they had landed the brethren, should return; and that the brethren
should stay abroad till the new mission. These ships are not otherwise
fraught, than with store of victuals, and good quantity of treasure to
remain with the brethren, for the buying of such things and rewarding of
such persons as they should think fit. Now for me to tell you how the
vulgar sort of mariners are contained from being discovered at land; and
how they that must be put on shore for any time, color themselves under
the names of other nations; and to what places these voyages have been
designed; and what places of rendezvous are appointed for the new
missions; and the like circumstances of the practique; I may not do it:
neither is it much to your desire. But thus you see we maintain a trade
not for gold, silver, or jewels; nor for silks; nor for spices; nor any
other commodity of matter; but only for God’s first creature, which was
Light: to have light (I say) of the growth of all parts of the
world.”</p>
<p>And when he had said this, he was silent; and so were we all. For
indeed we were all astonished to hear so strange things so probably
told. And he, perceiving that we were willing to say somewhat but had it
not ready in great courtesy took us off, and descended to ask us
questions of our voyage and fortunes and in the end concluded, that we
might do well to think with ourselves what time of stay we would demand
of the state; and bade us not to scant ourselves; for he would procure
such time as we desired: Whereupon we all rose up, and presented
ourselves to kiss the skirt of his tippet; but he would not suffer us;
and so took his leave. But when it came once amongst our people that the
state used to offer conditions to strangers that would stay, we had work
enough to get any of our men to look to our ship; and to keep them from
going presently to the governor to crave conditions. But with much ado
we refrained them, till we might agree what course to take.</p>
<p>We took ourselves now for free men, seeing there was no danger of our
utter perdition; and lived most joyfully, going abroad and seeing what
was to be seen in the city and places adjacent within our tedder; and
obtaining acquaintance with many of the city, not of the meanest
quality; at whose hands we found such humanity, and such a freedom and
desire to take strangers as it were into their bosom, as was enough to
make us forget all that was dear to us in our own countries: and
continually we met with many things right worthy of observation and
relation: as indeed, if there be a mirror in the world worthy to hold
men’s eyes, it is that country.</p>
<p>One day there were two of our company bidden to a Feast of the
Family, as they call it. A most natural, pious, and reverend custom it
is, shewing that nation to be compounded of all goodness. This is the
manner of it. It is granted to any man that shall live to see thirty
persons descended of his body alive together, and all above three years
old, to make this feast which is done at the cost of the state. The
Father of the Family, whom they call the Tirsan, two days before the
feast, taketh to him three of such friends as he liketh to choose; and
is assisted also by the governor of the city or place where the feast is
celebrated; and all the persons of the family, of both sexes, are
summoned to attend him. These two days the Tirsan sitteth in
consultation concerning the good estate of the family. There, if there
be any discord or suits between any of the family, they are compounded
and appeased. There, if any of the family be distressed or decayed,
order is taken for their relief and competent means to live. There, if
any be subject to vice, or take ill courses, they are reproved and
censured. So likewise direction is given touching marriages, and the
courses of life, which any of them should take, with divers other the
like orders and advices. The governor assisteth, to the end to put in
execution by his public authority the decrees and orders of the Tirsan,
if they should be disobeyed; though that seldom needeth; such reverence
and obedience they give to the order of nature. The Tirsan doth also
then ever choose one man from among his sons, to live in house with him;
who is called ever after the Son of the Vine. The reason will hereafter
appear.</p>
<p>On the feast day, the father or Tirsan cometh forth after divine
service into a large room where the feast is celebrated; which room hath
an half-pace at the upper end. Against the wall, in the middle of the
half-pace, is a chair placed for him, with a table and carpet before it.
Over the chair is a state, made round or oval, and it is of ivy; an ivy
somewhat whiter than ours, like the leaf of a silver asp; but more
shining; for it is green all winter. And the state is curiously wrought
with silver and silk of divers colors, broiding or binding in the ivy;
and is ever of the work of some of the daughters of the family; and
veiled over at the top with a fine net of silk and silver. But the
substance of it is true ivy; whereof, after it is taken down, the
friends of the family are desirous to have some leaf or sprig to
keep.</p>
<p>The Tirsan cometh forth with all his generation or linage, the males
before him, and the females following him; and if there be a mother from
whose body the whole linage is descended, there is a traverse placed in
a loft above on the right hand of the chair, with a privy door, and a
carved window of glass, leaded with gold and blue; where she sitteth,
but is not seen. When the Tirsan is come forth, he sitteth down in the
chair; and all the linage place themselves against the wall, both at his
back and upon the return of the half-pace, in order of their years
without difference of sex; and stand upon their feet. When he is set;
the room being always full of company, but well kept and without
disorder; after some pause, there cometh in from the lower end of the
room, a taratan (which is as much as an herald) and on either side of
him two young lads; whereof one carrieth a scroll of their shining
yellow parchment; and the other a cluster of grapes of gold, with a long
foot or stalk. The herald and children are clothed with mantles of
sea-water green satin; but the herald’s mantle is streamed with gold,
and hath a train.</p>
<p>Then the herald with three curtesies, or rather inclinations, cometh
up as far as the half-pace; and there first taketh into his hand the
scroll. This scroll is the king’s charter, containing gifts of revenew,
and many privileges, exemptions, and points of honour, granted to the
Father of the Family; and is ever styled and directed, To such do one
our well beloved friend and creditor: which is a title proper only to
this case. For they say the king is debtor to no man, but for
propagation of his subjects. The seal set to the king’s charter is the
king’s image, imbossed or moulded in gold; and though such charters be
expedited of course, and as of right, yet they are varied by discretion,
according to the number and dignity of the family. This charter the
herald readeth aloud; and while it is read, the father or Tirsan
standeth up supported by two of his sons, such as he chooseth. Then the
herald mounteth the half-pace and delivereth the charter into his hand:
and with that there is an acclamation by all that are present in their
language, which is thus much: Happy are the people of Bensalem.</p>
<p>Then the herald taketh into his hand from the other child the cluster
of grapes, which is of gold, both the stalk and the grapes. But the
grapes are daintily enamelled; and if the males of the family be the
greater number, the grapes are enamelled purple, with a little sun set
on the top; if the females, then they are enamelled into a greenish
yellow, with a crescent on the top. The grapes are in number as many as
there are descendants of the family. This golden cluster the herald
delivereth also to the Tirsan; who presently delivereth it over to that
son that he had formerly chosen to be in house with him: who beareth it
before his father as an ensign of honour when he goeth in public, ever
after; and is thereupon called the Son of the Vine.</p>
<p>After the ceremony endeth the father or Tirsan retireth; and after
some time cometh forth again to dinner, where he sitteth alone under the
state, as before; and none of his descendants sit with him, of what
degree or dignity soever, except he hap to be of Salomon’s House. He is
served only by his own children, such as are male; who perform unto him
all service of the table upon the knee; and the women only stand about
him, leaning against the wall. The room below the half-pace hath tables
on the sides for the guests that are bidden; who are served with great
and comely order; and towards the end of dinner (which in the greatest
feasts with them lasteth never above an hour and an half) there is an
hymn sung, varied according to the invention of him that composeth it
(for they have excellent posy) but the subject of it is (always) the
praises of Adam and Noah and Abraham; whereof the former two peopled the
world, and the last was the Father of the Faithful: concluding ever with
a thanksgiving for the nativity of our Saviour, in whose birth the
births of all are only blessed.</p>
<p>Dinner being done, the Tirsan retireth again; and having withdrawn
himself alone into a place, where he makes some private prayers, he
cometh forth the third time, to give the blessing with all his
descendants, who stand about him as at the first. Then he calleth them
forth by one and by one, by name, as he pleaseth, though seldom the
order of age be inverted. The person that is called (the table being
before removed) kneeleth down before the chair, and the father layeth
his hand upon his head, or her head, and giveth the blessing in these
words: Son of Bensalem, (or daughter of Bensalem,) thy father with it:
the man by whom thou hast breath and life speaketh the word: the
blessing of the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, and the Holy
Dove, be upon thee, and make the days of thy pilgrimage good and many.
This he saith to every of them; and that done, if there be any of his
sons of eminent merit and virtue, (so they be not above two,) he calleth
for them again; and saith, laying his arm over their shoulders, they
standing; Sons, it is well ye are born, give God the praise, and
persevere to the end. And withall delivereth to either of them a jewel,
made in the figure of an ear of wheat, which they ever after wear in the
front of their turban or hat. This done, they fall to music and dances,
and other recreations, after their manner, for the rest of the day. This
is the full order of that feast.</p>
<p>By that time six or seven days were spent, I was fallen into straight
acquaintance with a merchant of that city, whose name was Joabin. He was
a Jew and circumcised: for they have some few stirps of Jews yet
remaining among them, whom they leave to their own religion. Which they
may the better do, because they are of a far differing disposition from
the Jews in other parts. For whereas they hate the name of Christ; and
have a secret inbred rancour against the people among whom they live:
these (contrariwise) give unto our Saviour many high attributes, and
love the nation of Bensalem extremely. Surely this man of whom I speak
would ever acknowledge that Christ was born of a virgin and that he was
more than a man; and he would tell how God made him ruler of the
seraphims which guard his throne; and they call him also the Milken Way,
and the Eliah of the Messiah; and many other high names; which though
they be inferior to his divine majesty, yet they are far from the
language of other Jews.</p>
<p>And for the country of Bensalem, this man would make no end of
commending it; being desirous, by tradition among the Jews there, to
have it believed that the people thereof were of the generations of
Abraham, by another son, whom they call Nachoran; and that Moses by a
secret Cabala ordained the Laws of Bensalem which they now use; and that
when the Messiah should come, and sit in his throne at Hierusalem, the
king of Bensalem should sit at his feet, whereas other kings should keep
a great distance. But yet setting aside these Jewish dreams, the man was
a wise man, and learned, and of great policy, and excellently seen in
the laws and customs of that nation.</p>
<p>Amongst other discourses, one day I told him I was much affected with
the relation I had, from some of the company, of their custom, in
holding the Feast of the Family; for that (methought) I had never heard
of a solemnity wherein nature did so much preside. And because
propagation of families proceedeth from the nuptial copulation, I
desired to know of him what laws and customs they had concerning
marriage; and whether they kept marriage well and whether they were tied
to one wife; for that where population is so much affected,’ and such as
with them it seemed to be, there is commonly permission of plurality of
wives.</p>
<p>To this he said, “You have reason for to commend that excellent
institution of the Feast of the Family. And indeed we have experience
that those families that are partakers of the blessing of that feast do
flourish and prosper ever after in an extraordinary manner. But hear me
now, and I will tell you what I know. You shall understand that there is
not under the heavens so chaste a nation as this of Bensalem; nor so
free from all pollution or foulness. It is the virgin of the world. I
remember I have read in one of your European books, of an holy hermit
amongst you that desired to see the Spirit of Fornication; and there
appeared to him a little foul ugly Aethiop. But if he had desired to see
the Spirit of Chastity of Bensalem, it would have appeared to him in the
likeness of a fair beautiful Cherubim. For there is nothing amongst
mortal men more fair and admirable, than the chaste minds of this
people. Know therefore, that with them there are no stews, no dissolute
houses, no courtesans, nor anything of that kind. Nay they wonder (with
detestation) at you in Europe, which permit such things. They say ye
have put marriage out of office: for marriage is ordained a remedy for
unlawful concupiscence; and natural concupiscence seemeth as a spar to
marriage. But when men have at hand a remedy more agreeable to their
corrupt will, marriage is almost expulsed. And therefore there are with
you seen infinite men that marry not, but chose rather a libertine and
impure single life, than to be yoked in marriage; and many that do
marry, marry late, when the prime and strength of their years is past.
And when they do marry, what is marriage to them but a very bargain;
wherein is sought alliance, or portion, or reputation, with some desire
(almost indifferent) of issue; and not the faithful nuptial union of man
and wife, that was first instituted. Neither is it possible that those
that have cast away so basely so much of their strength, should greatly
esteem children, (being of the same matter,) as chaste men do. So
likewise during marriage, is the case much amended, as it ought to be if
those things were tolerated only for necessity? No, but they remain
still as a very affront to marriage. The haunting of those dissolute
places, or resort to courtesans, are no more punished in married men
than in bachelors. And the depraved custom of change, and the delight in
meretricious embracements, (where sin is turned into art,) maketh
marriage a dull thing, and a kind of imposition or tax. They hear you
defend these things, as done to avoid greater evils; as advoutries,
deflowering of virgins, unnatural lust, and the like. But they say this
is a preposterous wisdom; and they call it Lot’s offer, who to save his
guests from abusing, offered his daughters: nay they say farther that
there is little gained in this; for that the same vices and appetites do
still remain and abound; unlawful lust being like a furnace, that if you
stop the flames altogether, it will quench; but if you give it any vent,
it will rage. As for masculine love, they have no touch of it; and yet
there are not so faithful and inviolate friendships in the world again
as are there; and to speak generally, (as I said before,) I have not
read of any such chastity, in any people as theirs. And their usual
saying is, That whosoever is unchaste cannot reverence himself; and they
say, That the reverence of a man’s self, is, next to religion, the
chiefest bridle of all vices.”</p>
<p>And when he had said this, the good Jew paused a little; whereupon I,
far more willing to hear him speak on than to speak myself, yet thinking
it decent that upon his pause of speech I should not be altogether
silent, said only this; “That I would say to him, as the widow of
Sarepta said to Elias; that he was come to bring to memory our sins; and
that I confess the righteousness of Bensalem was greater than the
righteousness of Europe.” At which speech he bowed his head, and went on
in this manner:</p>
<p>“They have also many wise and excellent laws touching marriage. They
allow no polygamy. They have ordained that none do intermarry or
contract, until a month be past from their first interview. Marriage
without consent of parents they do not make void, but they mulct it in
the inheritors: for the children of such marriages are not admitted to
inherit above a third part of their parents’ inheritance. I have read in
a book of one of your men, of a Feigned Commonwealth, where the married
couple are permitted, before they contract, to see one another naked.
This they dislike; for they think it a scorn to give a refusal after so
familiar knowledge: but because of many hidden defects in men and
women’s bodies, they have a more civil way; for they have near every
town a couple of pools, (which they call Adam and Eve’s pools,) where it
is permitted to one of the friends of the men, and another of the
friends of the woman, to see them severally bathe naked.”</p>
<p>And as we were thus in conference, there came one that seemed to be a
messenger, in a rich huke, that spake with the Jew: whereupon he turned
to me and said; “You will pardon me, for I am commanded away in haste.”
The next morning he came to me again, joyful as it seemed, and said;
“There is word come to the Governor of the city, that one of the Fathers
of Salomon’s House will be here this day seven-night: we have seen none
of them this dozen years. His coming is in state; but the cause of his
coming is secret. I will provide you and your fellows of a good standing
to see his entry.” I thanked him, and told him, I was most glad of the
news.</p>
<p>The day being come, he made his entry. He was a man of middle stature
and age, comely of person, and had an aspect as if he pitied men. He was
clothed in a robe of fine black cloth, with wide sleeves and a cape. His
under garment was of excellent white linen down to the foot, girt with a
girdle of the same; and a sindon or tippet of the same about his neck.
He had gloves, that were curious,’’ and set with stone; and shoes of
peach-coloured velvet. His neck was bare to the shoulders. His hat was
like a helmet, or Spanish montera; and his locks curled below it
decently: they were of colour brown. His beard was cut round, and of the
same colour with his hair, somewhat lighter. He was carried in a rich
chariot without wheels, litter-wise; with two horses at either end,
richly trapped in blue velvet embroidered; and two footmen on each side
in the like attire. The chariot was all of cedar, gilt, and adorned with
crystal; save that the fore-end had panels of sapphires, set in borders
of gold; and the hinder-end the like of emeralds of the Peru colour.
There was also a sun of gold, radiant, upon the top, in the midst; and
on the top before, a small cherub of gold, with wings displayed. The
chariot was covered with cloth of gold tissued upon blue. He had before
him fifty attendants, young men all, in white satin loose coats to the
mid leg; and stockings of white silk; and shoes of blue velvet; and hats
of blue velvet; with fine plumes of diverse colours, set round like
hat-bands. Next before the chariot, went two men, bare-headed, in linen
garments down the foot, girt, and shoes of blue velvet; who carried, the
one a crosier, the other a pastoral staff like a sheep-hook; neither of
them of metal, but the crosier of balm-wood, the pastoral staff of
cedar. Horsemen he had none, neither before nor behind his chariot: as
it seemeth, to avoid all tumult and trouble. Behind his chariot went all
the officers and principals of the companies of the city. He sat alone,
upon cushions of a kind of excellent plush, blue; and under his foot
curious carpets of silk of diverse colours, like the Persian, but far
finer. He held up his bare hand as he went, as blessing the people, but
in silence. The street was wonderfully well kept: so that there was
never any army had their men stand in better battle-array than the
people stood. The windows likewise were not crowded, but every one stood
in them as if they had been placed.</p>
<p>When the shew was past, the Jew said to me; “I shall not be able to
attend you as I would, in regard of some charge the city hath laid upon
me, for the entertaining of this great person.” Three days after the Jew
came to me again, and said; “Ye are happy men; for the Father of
Salomon’s House taketh knowledge of your being here, and commanded me to
tell you that he will admit all your company to his presence, and have
private conference with one of you, that ye shall choose: and for this
hath appointed the next day after to-morrow. And because he meaneth to
give you his blessing, he hath appointed it in the forenoon.”</p>
<p>We came at our day and hour, and I was chosen by my fellows for the
private access. We found him in a fair chamber, richly hanged, and
carpeted under foot without any degrees to the state. He was set upon a
low Throne richly adorned, and a rich cloth of state over his head, of
blue satin embroidered. He was alone, save that he had two pages of
honour, on either hand one, finely attired in white. His under garments
were the like that we saw him wear in the chariot; but instead of his
gown, he had on him a mantle with a cape, of the same fine black,
fastened about him. When we came in, as we were taught, we bowed low at
our first entrance; and when we were come near his chair, he stood up,
holding forth his hand ungloved, and in posture of blessing; and we
every one of us stooped down, and kissed the hem of his tippet. That
done, the rest departed, and I remained. Then he warned the pages forth
of the room, and caused me to sit down beside him, and spake to me thus
in the Spanish tongue.</p>
<p>“God bless thee, my son; I will give thee the greatest jewel I have.
For I will impart unto thee, for the love of God and men, a relation of
the true state of Salomon’s House. Son, to make you know the true state
of Salomon’s House, I will keep this order. First, I will set forth unto
you the end of our foundation. Secondly, the preparations and
instruments we have for our works. Thirdly, the several employments and
functions whereto our fellows are assigned. And fourthly, the ordinances
and rites which we observe.</p>
<p>“The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret
motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to
the effecting of all things possible.</p>
<p>“The Preparations and Instruments are these. We have large and deep
caves of several depths: the deepest are sunk six hundred fathom: and
some of them are digged and made under great hills and mountains: so
that if you reckon together the depth of the hill and the depth of the
cave, they are (some of them) above three miles deep. For we find, that
the depth of a hill, and the depth of a cave from the flat, is the same
thing; both remote alike, from the sun and heaven’s beams, and from the
open air. These caves we call the Lower Region; and we use them for all
coagulations, indurations, refrigerations, and conservations of bodies.
We use them likewise for the imitation of natural mines; and the
producing also of new artificial metals, by compositions and materials
which we use, and lay there for many years. We use them also sometimes,
(which may seem strange,) for curing of some diseases, and for
prolongation of life in some hermits that choose to live there, well
accommodated of all things necessary, and indeed live very long; by whom
also we learn many things.</p>
<p>“We have burials in several earths, where we put diverse cements, as
the Chineses do their porcellain. But we have them in greater variety,
and some of them more fine. We have also great variety of composts and
soils, for the making of the earth fruitful.</p>
<p>“We have high towers; the highest about half a mile in height; and
some of them likewise set upon high mountains; so that the vantage of
the hill with the tower is in the highest of them three miles at least.
And these places we call the Upper Region; accounting the air between
the high places and the low, as a Middle Region. We use these towers,
according to their several heights, and situations, for insolation,
refrigeration, conservation; and for the view of divers meteors; as
winds, rain, snow, hail; and some of the fiery meteors also. And upon
them, in some places, are dwellings of hermits, whom we visit sometimes,
and instruct what to observe.</p>
<p>“We have great lakes, both salt, and fresh; whereof we have use for
the fish and fowl. We use them also for burials of some natural bodies:
for we find a difference in things buried in earth or in air below the
earth, and things buried in water. We have also pools, of which some do
strain fresh water out of salt; and others by art do turn fresh water
into salt. We have also some rocks in the midst of the sea, and some
bays upon the shore for some works, wherein is required the air and
vapor of the sea. We have likewise violent streams and cataracts, which
serve us for many motions: and likewise engines for multiplying and
enforcing of winds, to set also on going diverse motions.</p>
<p>“We have also a number of artificial wells and fountains, made in
imitation of the natural sources and baths; as tincted upon vitriol,
sulphur, steel, brass, lead, nitre, and other minerals. And again we
have little wells for infusions of many things, where the waters take
the virtue quicker and better, than in vessels or basins. And amongst
them we have a water which we call Water of Paradise, being, by that we
do to it made very sovereign for health, and prolongation of life.</p>
<p>“We have also great and spacious houses where we imitate and
demonstrate meteors; as snow, hail, rain, some artificial rains of
bodies and not of water, thunders, lightnings; also generations of
bodies in air; as frogs, flies, and divers others.</p>
<p>“We have also certain chambers, which we call Chambers of Health,
where we qualify the air as we think good and proper for the cure of
divers diseases, and preservation of health.</p>
<p>“We have also fair and large baths, of several mixtures, for the cure
of diseases, and the restoring of man’s body from arefaction: and others
for the confirming of it in strength of sinewes, vital parts, and the
very juice and substance of the body.</p>
<p>“We have also large and various orchards and gardens; wherein we do
not so much respect beauty, as variety of ground and soil, proper for
divers trees and herbs: and some very spacious, where trees and berries
are set whereof we make divers kinds of drinks, besides the vineyards.
In these we practise likewise all conclusions of grafting, and
inoculating as well of wild-trees as fruit-trees, which produceth many
effects. And we make (by art) in the same orchards and gardens, trees
and flowers to come earlier or later than their seasons; and to come up
and bear more speedily than by their natural course they do. We make
them also by art greater much than their nature; and their fruit greater
and sweeter and of differing taste, smell, colour, and figure, from
their nature. And many of them we so order, as they become of medicinal
use.</p>
<p>“We have also means to make divers plants rise by mixtures of earths
without seeds; and likewise to make divers new plants, differing from
the vulgar; and to make one tree or plant turn into another.</p>
<p>“We have also parks and enclosures of all sorts of beasts and birds
which we use not only for view or rareness, but likewise for dissections
and trials; that thereby we may take light what may be wrought upon the
body of man. Wherein we find many strange effects; as continuing life in
them, though divers parts, which you account vital, be perished and
taken forth; resuscitating of some that seem dead in appearance; and the
like. We try also all poisons and other medicines upon them, as well of
chirurgery, as physic. By art likewise, we make them greater or taller
than their kind is; and contrariwise dwarf them, and stay their growth:
we make them more fruitful and bearing than their kind is; and
contrariwise barren and not generative. Also we make them differ in
colour, shape, activity, many ways. We find means to make commixtures
and copulations of different kinds; which have produced many new kinds,
and them not barren, as the general opinion is. We make a number of
kinds of serpents, worms, flies, fishes, of putrefaction; whereof some
are advanced (in effect) to be perfect creatures, like bests or birds;
and have sexes, and do propagate. Neither do we this by chance, but we
know beforehand, of what matter and commixture what kind of those
creatures will arise.</p>
<p>“We have also particular pools, where we make trials upon fishes, as
we have said before of beasts and birds.</p>
<p>“We have also places for breed and generation of those kinds of worms
and flies which are of special use; such as are with you your silk-worms
and bees.</p>
<p>“I will not hold you long with recounting of our brewhouses,
bake-houses, and kitchens, where are made divers drinks, breads, and
meats, rare and of special effects. Wines we have of grapes; and drinks
of other juice of fruits, of grains, and of roots; and of mixtures with
honey, sugar, manna, and fruits dried, and decocted; Also of the tears
or woundings of trees; and of the pulp of canes. And these drinks are of
several ages, some to the age or last of forty years. We have drinks
also brewed with several herbs, and roots, and spices; yea with several
fleshes, and white-meats; whereof some of the drinks are such, as they
are in effect meat and drink both: so that divers, especially in age, do
desire to live with them, with little or no meat or bread. And above
all, we strive to have drink of extreme thin parts, to insinuate into
the body, and yet without all biting, sharpness, or fretting; insomuch
as some of them put upon the back of your hand will, with a little stay,
pass through to the palm, and yet taste mild to the mouth. We have also
waters which we ripen in that fashion, as they become nourishing; so
that they are indeed excellent drink; and many will use no other. Breads
we have of several grains, roots, and kernels; yea and some of flesh and
fish dried; with divers kinds of leavenings and seasonings: so that some
do extremely move appetites; some do nourish so, as divers do live of
them, without any other meat; who live very long. So for meats, we have
some of them so beaten and made tender and mortified,’ yet without all
corrupting, as a weak heat of the stomach will turn them into good
chylus; as well as a strong heat would meat otherwise prepared. We have
some meats also and breads and drinks, which taken by men enable them to
fast long after; and some other, that used make the very flesh of men’s
bodies sensibly’ more hard and tough and their strength far greater than
otherwise it would be.</p>
<p>“We have dispensatories, or shops of medicines. Wherein you may
easily think, if we have such variety of plants and living creatures
more than you have in Europe, (for we know what you have,) the simples,
drugs, and ingredients of medicines, must likewise be in so much the
greater variety. We have them likewise of divers ages, and long
fermentations. And for their preparations, we have not only all manner
of exquisite distillations and separations, and especially by gentle
heats and percolations through divers strainers, yea and substances; but
also exact forms of composition, whereby they incorporate almost, as
they were natural simples.</p>
<p>“We have also divers mechanical arts, which you have not; and stuffs
made by them; as papers, linen, silks, tissues; dainty works of feathers
of wonderful lustre; excellent dies, and, many others; and shops
likewise, as well for such as are not brought into vulgar use amongst us
as for those that are. For you must know that of the things before
recited, many of them are grown into use throughout the kingdom; but
yet, if they did flow from our invention, we have of them also for
patterns and principals.</p>
<p>“We have also furnaces of great diversities, and that keep great
diversity of heats; fierce and quick; strong and constant; soft and
mild; blown, quiet; dry, moist; and the like. But above all, we have
heats, in imitation of the Sun’s and heavenly bodies’ heats, that pass
divers inequalities, and (as it were) orbs, progresses, and returns,
whereby we produce admirable effects. Besides, we have heats of dungs;
and of bellies and maws of living creatures, and of their bloods and
bodies; and of hays and herbs laid up moist; of lime unquenched; and
such like. Instruments also which generate heat only by motion. And
farther, places for strong insulations; and again, places under the
earth, which by nature, or art, yield heat. These divers heats we use,
as the nature of the operation, which we intend, requireth.</p>
<p>“We have also perspective-houses, where we make demonstrations of all
lights and radiations; and of all colours: and out of things uncoloured
and transparent, we can represent unto you all several colours; not in
rain-bows, (as it is in gems, and prisms,) but of themselves single. We
represent also all multiplications of light, which we carry to great
distance, and make so sharp as to discern small points and lines. Also
all colourations of light; all delusions and deceits of the sight, in
figures, magnitudes, motions, colours all demonstrations of shadows. We
find also divers means, yet unknown to you, of producing of light
originally from divers bodies. We procure means of seeing objects afar
off; as in the heaven and remote places; and represent things near as
afar off; and things afar off as near; making feigned distances. We have
also helps for the sight, far above spectacles and glasses in use. We
have also glasses and means to see small and minute bodies perfectly and
distinctly; as the shapes and colours of small flies and worms, grains
and flaws in gems, which cannot otherwise be seen, observations in urine
and blood not otherwise to be seen. We make artificial rain-bows,
halo’s, and circles about light. We represent also all manner of
reflexions, refractions, and multiplications of visual beams of
objects.</p>
<p>“We have also precious stones of all kinds, many of them of great
beauty, and to you unknown; crystals likewise; and glasses of divers
kinds; and amongst them some of metals vitrificated, and other materials
besides those of which you make glass. Also a number of fossils, and
imperfect minerals, which you have not. Likewise loadstones of
prodigious virtue; and other rare stones, both natural and
artificial.</p>
<p>“We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all
sounds, and their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of
quarter-sounds, and lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music
likewise to you unknown, some sweeter than any you have, together with
bells and rings that are dainty and sweet. We represent small sounds as
great and deep; likewise great sounds extenuate and sharp; we make
divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in their original are
entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and letters, and
the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps which
set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers
strange and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as
it were tossing it: and some that give back the voice louder than it
came, some shriller, and some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice
differing in the letters or articulate sound from that they receive. We
have also means to convey sounds in trunks and pipes, in strange lines
and distances.</p>
<p>“We have also perfume-houses; wherewith we join also practices of
taste. We multiply smells, which may seem strange. We imitate smells,
making all smells to breathe outs of other mixtures than those that give
them. We make divers imitations of taste likewise, so that they will
deceive any man’s taste. And in this house we contain also a
confiture-house; where we make all sweet-meats, dry and moist; and
divers pleasant wines, milks, broths, and sallets; in far greater
variety than you have.</p>
<p>“We have also engine-houses, where are prepared engines and
instruments for all sorts of motions. There we imitate and practise to
make swifter motions than any you have, either out of your muskets or
any engine that you have: and to make them and multiply them more
easily, and with small force, by wheels and other means: and to make
them stronger and more violent than yours are; exceeding your greatest
cannons and basilisks. We represent also ordnance and instruments of
war, and engines of all kinds: and likewise new mixtures and
compositions of gun-powder, wild-fires burning in water, and
unquenchable. Also fireworks of all variety both for pleasure and use.
We imitate also flights of birds; we have some degrees of flying in the
air. We have ships and boats for going under water, and brooking of
seas; also swimming-girdles and supporters. We have divers curious
clocks, and other like motions of return: and some perpetual motions. We
imitate also motions of living creatures, by images, of men, beasts,
birds, fishes, and serpents. We have also a great number of other
various motions, strange for equality, fineness, and subtilty.</p>
<p>“We have also a mathematical house, where are represented all
instruments, as well of geometry as astronomy, exquisitely made.</p>
<p>“We have also houses of deceits of the senses; where we represent all
manner of feats of juggling, false apparitions, impostures, and
illusions; and their fallacies. And surely you will easily believe that
we that have so many things truly natural which induce admiration, could
in a world of particulars deceive the senses, if we would disguise those
things and labour to make them seem more miraculous. But we do hate all
impostures, and lies; insomuch as we have severely forbidden it to all
our fellows, under pain of ignominy and fines, that they do not show any
natural work or thing, adorned or swelling; but only pure as it is, and
without all affectation of strangeness.</p>
<p>“These are (my son) the riches of Salomon’s House.</p>
<p>“For the several employments and offices of our fellows; we have
twelve that sail into foreign countries, under the names of other
nations, (for our own we conceal); who bring us the books, and
abstracts, and patterns of experiments of all other parts. These we call
Merchants of Light.</p>
<p>“We have three that collect the experiments which are in all books.
These we call Depredators.</p>
<p>“We have three that collect the experiments of all mechanical arts;
and also of liberal sciences; and also of practices which are not
brought into arts. These we call Mystery-men.</p>
<p>“We have three that try new experiments, such as themselves think
good. These we call Pioneers or Miners.</p>
<p>“We have three that draw the experiments of the former four into
titles and tables, to give the better light for the drawing of
observations and axioms out of them. These we call Compilers.</p>
<p>“We have three that bend themselves, looking into the experiments of
their fellows, and cast about how to draw out of them things of use and
practise for man’s life, and knowledge, as well for works as for plain
demonstration of causes, means of natural divinations, and the easy and
clear discovery of the virtues and parts of bodies. These we call
Dowry-men or Benefactors.</p>
<p>“Then after divers meetings and consults of our whole number, to
consider of the former labours and collections, we have three that take
care, out of them, to direct new experiments, of a higher light, more
penetrating into nature than the former. These we call Lamps.</p>
<p>“We have three others that do execute the experiments so directed,
and report them. These we call Inoculators.</p>
<p>“Lastly, we have three that raise the former discoveries by
experiments into greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms. These we
call Interpreters of Nature.</p>
<p>“We have also, as you must think, novices and apprentices, that the
succession of the former employed men do not fail; besides, a great
number of servants and attendants, men and women. And this we do also:
we have consultations, which of the inventions and experiences which we
have discovered shall be published, and which not: and take all an oath
of secrecy, for the concealing of those which we think fit to keep
secret: though some of those we do reveal sometimes to the state and
some not.</p>
<p>“For our ordinances and rites: we have two very long and fair
galleries: in one of these we place patterns and samples of all manner
of the more rare and excellent inventions in the other we place the
statues of all principal inventors. There we have the statue of your
Columbus, that discovered the West Indies: also the inventor of ships:
your monk that was the inventor of ordnance and of gunpowder: the
inventor of music: the inventor of letters: the inventor of printing:
the inventor of observations of astronomy: the inventor of works in
metal: the inventor of glass: the inventor of silk of the worm: the
inventor of wine: the inventor of corn and bread: the inventor of
sugars: and all these, by more certain tradition than you have. Then
have we divers inventors of our own, of excellent works; which since you
have not seen, it were too long to make descriptions of them; and
besides, in the right understanding of those descriptions you might
easily err. For upon every invention of value, we erect a statue to the
inventor, and give him a liberal and honourable reward. These statues
are some of brass; some of marble and touch-stone; some of cedar and
other special woods gilt and adorned; some of iron; some of silver; some
of gold.</p>
<p>“We have certain hymns and services, which we say daily, of Lord and
thanks to God for his marvellous works: and forms of prayers, imploring
his aid and blessing for the illumination of our labours, and the
turning of them into good and holy uses.</p>
<p>“Lastly, we have circuits or visits of divers principal cities of the
kingdom; where, as it cometh to pass, we do publish such new profitable
inventions as we think good. And we do also declare natural divinations
of diseases, plagues, swarms-of hurtful creatures, scarcity, tempests,
earthquakes, great inundations, comets, temperature of the year, and
divers other things; and we give counsel thereupon, what the people
shall do for the prevention and remedy of them.”</p>
<p>And when he had said this, he stood up; and I, as I had been taught,
kneeled down, and he laid his right hand upon my head, and said; “God
bless thee, my son; and God bless this relation, which I have made. I
give thee leave to publish it for the good of other nations; for we here
are in God’s bosom, a land unknown.” And so he left me; having assigned
a value of about two thousand ducats, for a bounty to me and my fellows.
For they give great largesses where they come upon all occasions.</p>
