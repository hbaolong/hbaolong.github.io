<h4 id="section">41</h4>
<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the eighteenth place
Instances of the Road, which I also call Traveling Instances and
Articulate Instances. They are those which point out the motions of
nature in their gradual progress. This class of instances escapes the
observation rather than the sense. For it is strange how careless men
are in this matter; for they study nature only by fits and at intervals,
and when bodies are finished and completed, not while she is at work
upon them. Yet if anyone were desirous of examining and studying the
contrivances and industry of an artificer, he would not be content with
beholding merely the rude materials of the art and then the completed
works, but would rather wish to be present while the artificer was at
his labors and carrying his work on. And a like course should be taken
with the investigation of nature. For instance, if we are inquiring into
the vegetation of plants, we must begin from the very sowing of the
seed, and observe (as we may easily do, by taking out day after day the
seeds that have lain in the ground two days, three days, four days, and
so on, and carefully examining them) how and when the seed begins to
puff and swell and to be, as it were, filled with spirit; secondly, how
it begins to burst the skin and put forth fibers, at the same time
raising itself slightly upwards, unless the ground be very stiff; also,
how it puts forth its fibers, some for the root downwards and some for
the stem upwards, and sometimes also creeping sideways if it there finds
the ground more open and yielding; and so with many other things of the
kind. In the same way we should examine the hatching of eggs, in which
we might easily observe the whole process of vivification and
organization, and see what parts proceed from the yolk and what from the
white of the egg, and so forth. A similar course should be taken with
animals generated from putrefaction. For to prosecute such inquiries
concerning perfect animals by cutting out the fetus from the womb would
be too inhuman, except when opportunities are afforded by abortions, the
chase, and the like. There should therefore be set a sort of night watch
over nature, as showing herself better by night than by day. For these
may be regarded as night studies by reason of the smallness of our
candle and its continual burning.</p>
<p>The same too should be attempted with inanimate substances, as I have
done myself in investigating the expansion of liquids by fire. For there
is one mode of expansion in water, another in wine, another in vinegar,
another in verjuice, and quite another in milk and oil; as was easily to
be seen by boiling them over a slow fire and in a glass vessel in which
everything may be clearly distinguished. These matters, however, I touch
but briefly, meaning to treat of them more fully and exactly when I come
to the discovery of the Latent Process of things. For it should all
along be borne in mind that in this place I am not handling the things
themselves, but only giving examples.</p>
