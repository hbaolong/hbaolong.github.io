“TEMPORIS PARTUS MAXIMUS.”</h4>
<p>Francis Bacon was at Blois with Sir Amias Paulet in 1577. In the same
year was published the first edition of the first part of “Académie
Francoise par Pierre de la Primaudaye Esceuyer, Seignor dudict lieu et
de la Barrée, Gentilhomme ordinaire de la chambre du Roy.” The
dedication, dated February, 1577 (i.e., 1578) is addressed, “Au
Tres-chrestien Roy de France et de Polongne Henry III. de ce nom.” The
first English translation, by T. B., was “published in 15869, imprinted
at London by Edmund Bollifant for G. Bishop and Ralph Newbery.” Other
parts of “The Academy” followed at intervals of years, but the first and
only complete edition in English bears date 1618, and was printed for
Thomas Adams. Over the dedication is the well-known archer emblem. It is
a thick folio volume, with 1,038 pages double columns. It may be termed
the first Encyclopædia which appeared in any language, and is, perhaps,
one of the most remarkable productions of the Elizabethan era. Little is
known of Pierre de la Primaudaye. The particulars for his biography in
the “Biographie Nationale” seem to have been taken from references made
to the author in the “French Académie” itself. In the French Edition,
1580, there is a portrait of a man, and under it the words “Anag. de
L’auth. Par la prierè Dieu m’ayde.” The following is an extract from the
dedication: —</p>
<p>“The dinner of that prince of famous memorie, was a second table of
Salomon, vnto which resorted from euerie nation such as were best
learned, that they might reape profit and instruction. Yours, Sir, being
compassed about with those, who in your presence daily discourse of, and
heare discoursed many graue and goodly matters, seemeth to be a schoole
erected to teach men that are borne to vertue. And for myselfe, hauing
so good hap during the assemblie of your Estates at Blois, as to be made
partaker of the fruit gathered thereof, it came in my mind to offer vnto
your Maiestie a dish of diuers fruits, which I gathered in a Platonicall
garden or orchard, otherwise called an Academie, where I was not long
since with certaine yoong Gentlemen of Aniou my companions, discoursing
togither of the institution in good maners, and of the means how all
estates and conditions may liue well and happily. And although a
thousand thoughts came then into my mind to hinder my purpose, as the
small authoritie, which youth may or ought to haue in counsell amongst
ancient men: the greatnes of the matter subject, propounded to be
handled by yeeres of so small experience; the forgetfulness of the best
foundations of their discourses, which for want of a rich and happie
memorie might be in me: my iudgement not sound ynough, and my profession
vnfit to set them downe in good order: briefly, the consideration of
your naturall disposition and rare vertue, and of the learning which you
receiuve both by reading good authors, and by your familiar
communication with learned and great personages that are neere about
your Maiestie (whereby I seemed to oppose the light of an obscure day,
full of clouds and darkness, to the bright beames of a very cleere
shining sonne, and to take in hand, as we say, to teach Minerua). I say
all these reasons being but of too great weight to make me change my
opinion, yet calling to mind manie goodlie and graue sentences taken out
of sundry Greeke and Latine Philosophers, as also the woorthie examples
of the liues of ancient Sages and famous men, wherewith these discourses
were inriched, which might in delighting your noble mind renew your
memorie with those notable sayings in the praise of vertue and dispraise
of vice, which you alwaies loued to heare: and considering also that the
bounty of Artaxerxes that great Monarke of the Persians was reuiued in
you, who receiued with a cheerfull countenance a present of water of a
poore laborer, when he had no need of it, thinking to be as great an act
of magnanimitie to take in good part, and to receiue cheerfully small
presents offered with a hartie and good affection, as to giue great
things liberally, I ouercame whatsoeuer would haue staied me in mine
enterprise.”</p>
<p>It appears, therefore, that the author by good hap was a visitor at
the Court of Henry III. when at Blois; that he was there studying with
certain young gentlemen of Anjou, his companions; that he was a youth,
and of years of small experience; that his memory might not be
sufficiently rich and happy, his judgment not enough, and his profession
unfit in recording the discourses of himself and his companions.</p>
<p>“The Author to the Reader” is an essay on Philosophy, every sentence
in which seems to have the same familiar sound as essays which
subsequently appeared under another name. The contents of the several
chapters are enumerated thus: “Of Man,” “Of the Body and Soule,”
etc.</p>
<p>The first chapter contains a description of how the “Academie” came
about. An ancient wise gentleman of great calling having spent the
greater part of his years in the service of two kings, and of his
country, France, for many and good causes had withdrawn himself to his
house. He thought that to content his mind, which always delighted in
honest and vertuous things, he could not bring greater profit to the
Monarchie of France, than to lay open and preserve and keep youth from
the corruption which resulted from the over great license and excessive
liberty granted to them in the Universities. He took unto his house four
young gentlemen, with the consent of their parents who were
distinguished noblemen. After he had shown these young men the first
grounds of true wisdom, and of all necessary things for their salvation,
he brought into his house a tutor of great learning and well reported of
his good life and conversation, to whom he committed their instruction.
After teaching them the Latin tongue and some smattering of Greek he
propounded for their chief studies the moral philosophy of ancient sages
and wise men, together with the understanding and searching out of
histories which are the light of life. The four fathers, desiring to see
what progress their sons had made, decided to visit them. And because
they had small skill in the Latin tongue, they determined to have their
children discourse in their own natural tongue of all matters that might
serve for the instruction and reformation of every estate and calling,
in such order and method as they and their master might think best. It
was arranged that they should meet in a walking place covered over with
a goodly green arbour, and daily, except Sundays, for three weeks,
devote two hours in the morning and two hours after dinner to these
discourses, the fathers being in attendance to listen to their sons. So
interesting did these discussions become that the period was often
extended to three or four hours, and the young men were so intent upon
preparation for them that they would not only bestow the rest of the
days, but oftentimes the whole night, upon the well studying of that
which they proposed to handle. The author goes on to say:— “During which
time it was my good hap to be one of the companie when they began their
discourses, at which I so greatly wondered that I thought them worthy to
be published abroad.” From this it would appear that the author was a
visitor, privileged, with the four fathers and the master, to listen to
the discourses of these four young men. But, a little further on the
position is changed; one of the four young men is, without any
explanation, ignored, and his father disappointed! For the author takes
his place, as will be seen from the following extract: —</p>
<p>“And thus all fower of us followed the same order daily until everie
one in his course had intreated according to appointment, both by the
precepts of doctrine, as also by the examples of the lives of ancient
Sages and famous men, of all things necessary for the institution of
manners and happie life of all estates and callings in this French
Monarchie. But because I knowe not whether, in naming my companions by
their proper names, supposing thereby to honour them as indeede they
deserve it, I should displease them (which thing I would not so much as
thinke) I have determined to do as they that play on a Theater, who
under borrowed maskes and disguised apparell, do represent the true
personages of those whom they have undertaken to bring on the stage. I
will therefore call them by names very agreeable to their skill and
nature: the first Aser which signifieth Felicity: the second Amana which
is as much to say as Truth: the third Aram which noteth to us Highness;
and to agree with them as well in name as in education and behaviour. I
will name myself Achitob10 which is all one with Brother of goodness.
Further more I will call and honour the proceeding and finishing of our
sundry treatises and discourses with this goodlie and excellent title of
Academie, which was the ancient and renowned school amongst the Greek
Philosophers, who were the first that were esteemed, and that the place
where Plato, Xenophon, Poleman, Xenocrates, and many other excellent
personages, afterward called Academicks, did propound andandandand
discourse of all things meet for the instruction and teaching of
wisdome: wherein we purposed to followe them to our power, as the
sequele of our discourses shall make good proofe.”</p>
<p>And then the discourses commence.</p>
<p>“Love’s Labour’s Lost” was published in 1598, and was the first
quarto upon which the name of Shakespeare was printed. The title-page
states that it is “newly corrected and augmented,” from which it may be
inferred that there was a previous edition, but no copy of such is
known. The commentators are in practical agreement that it was probably
the first play written by the dramatist.</p>
<p>There are differences of opinion as to the probable date when it was
written. Richard Grant White believes this to be not later than 1588,
Knight gives 1589, but all this is conjecture.</p>
<p>The play opens with a speech by Ferdinand: —</p>
<p>“Let Fame that all hunt after in their lives,</p>
<p>Live registred upon our brazen Tombes,</p>
<p>And then grace us, in the disgrace of death:</p>
<p>When spight of cormorant devouring time,</p>
<p>Th’ endevour of this present breath may buy:</p>
<p>That honour which shall bate his sythes keene edge,</p>
<p>And make us heyres of all eternitie.</p>
<p>Therefore brave Conquerours, for so you are,</p>
<p>That warre against your own affections,</p>
<p>And the huge Armie of the worlds desires.</p>
<p>Our late Edict shall strongly stand in force,</p>
<p>Navar shall be the wonder of the world.</p>
<p>Our Court shall be a little Achademe,</p>
<p>Still and contemplative in living Art.</p>
<p>You three, Berowne, Doumaine, and Longavill,</p>
<p>Have sworne for three yeeres terme, to live with me,</p>
<p>My fellow Schollers, and to keepe those statutes</p>
<p>That are recorded in this schedule heere.</p>
<p>Your oathes are past, and now subscribe your names;</p>
<p>That his owne hand may strike his honour downe,</p>
<p>That violates the smallest branch heerein:</p>
<p>If you are arm’d to doe, as sworne to do,</p>
<p>Subscribe to your deepe oathes, and keepe it to.”</p>
<p>Four young men in the French “Academie” associated together, as in
“Love’s Labour Lost,” to war against their own affections and the whole
army of the world’s desires. Dumaine, in giving his acquiescence to
Ferdinand, ends: —</p>
<p>“To love, to wealth, to pompe, I pine and die</p>
<p>With all these living in Philosophie.”</p>
<p>Philosophie was the subject of study of the four young men to the
“Academie.”</p>
<p>Berowne was a visitor, for he says: —</p>
<p>“I only swore to study with your grace</p>
<p>And stay heere in your Court for three yeeres’ space.”</p>
<p>Upon his demurring to subscribe to the oath as drawn, Ferdinand
retorts: —</p>
<p>Well, sit you out: go home, Berowne: adue.”</p>
<p>To which Berowne replies: —</p>
<p>No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you.”</p>
<p>Achitob was a visitor at the Academie in France. There are other
points of resemblance, but sufficient has been said to warrant
consideration of the suggestion that the French “Academie” contains the
serious studies of the four young men whose experiences form the subject
of the play.</p>
<p>The parallels between passages in the Shakespeare plays and the
French “Academie” are numerous, but they form no part of the present
contention.</p>
<p>One of these may, however, be mentioned. In the third Tome the
following passage occurs11: —</p>
<p>Psal. xix.: “It is not without cause that the Prophet said (The
heavens declare the glory of God, and the earth sheweth the workes of
his handes) For thereby he evidently teacheth, as with the finger even
to our eies, the great and admirable providence of God their Creator;
even as if the heavens should speake to anyone. In another place it is
written (Eccles. xliii.): (This high ornament, this cleere firmament,
the beauty of the heaven so glorious to behold, tis a thing full of
Majesty).”</p>
<p>On turning to the revised version of the Bible it will be found that
the first verse is thus translated: “The pride of the height, the cleare
firmament the beauty of heaven with his glorious shew.” The rendering of
the text in “The French Academy” is strongly suggestive of Hamlet’s
famous soliloquy. “This most excellent canopy, this brave o’erhanging
firmament, this majestical roof fritted with golden fire, why it appears
to me no other than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.” The
author has forsaken the common-place rendering of the Apocrypha, and has
adopted the same declamatory style which Shakespeare uses. It is
strongly reminiscent of Hamlet’s famous speech, Act II., scene ii.</p>
<p>Only one of the Shakespeare commentators makes any reference to the
work. The Rev. Joseph Hunter, writing in 1844, points out that the
dramatist in “As You Like It,” describing the seven ages of man, follows
the division made in the chapter on “The Ages of Man” in the
“Academie.”12</p>
<p>The suggestion now made is that the French “Academie” was written by
Bacon, who is represented in the dialogues as Achitob — the first part
when he was about 18 years of age, that he continued it until, in 1618,
the complete work was published. In the dedication the author describes
himself as a youth of immature experience, but the contents bear
evidence of a wide knowledge of classical authors and their works, a
close acquaintance with the ancient philosophies, and a store of general
information which it would be impossible for any ordinary youth of such
an age to possess. But was not the boy who at 15 years of age left
Cambridge disagreeing with the teaching there of Aristotle’s philosophy,
and whose mental qualities and acquirements provoked as “the natural
ejaculation of the artist’s emotion” the significant words, “Si tabula
daretur digna animum mallem,” altogether abnormal?</p>
<p>Was the “French Academie” Bacon’s temporis partus maximus? It is only
in a letter written to Father Fulgentio about 1625 that this work is
heard of. Bacon writes: “Equidem memini me, quadraginta abhinc annis,
juvenile opusculum circa has res confecisse, quod magna prorsus fiducia
et magnifico titulo ‘Temporis Partum Maximum’ inscripsi.”13</p>
<p>Spedding says: “This was probably the work of which Henry Cuffe (the
great Oxford scholar who was executed in 1601 as one of the chief
accomplices in the Earl of Essex’s treason) was speaking when he said
that ‘a fool could not have written it and a wise man would not.’
Bacon’s intimacy with Essex had begun about thirty-five years before
this letter was written.”</p>
<p>Forty years from 1625 would carry back to 1585, the year preceding
the date of publication of the first edition in English. If Cuffe’s
remark was intended to apply to the “French Academy,” it is just such a
criticism as the book might be expected to provoke.</p>
<p>The first edition of “The French Academie” in English appeared in
1586, the second in 1589, the third (two parts) in 1594, the fourth
(three parts) in 1602, the fifth in 1614 (all quartos), then, in 1618,
the large folio edition containing the fourth part “never before
published in English.” It appears to have been more popular in England
than it was in France. Brunet in his 1838 edition mentions neither the
book nor the author, Primaudaye. The question as to whether there was at
this time a reading public in England sufficiently wide to absorb an
edition in numbers large enough to make the publication of this and
similar works possible at a profit will be dealt with hereafter. In
anticipation it may be said that the balance of probabilities justifies
the conjecture that the issue of each of these editions involved someone
in loss, and the folio edition involved considerable loss.</p>
<p>A comparison between the French and English publications points to
both having been written by an author who was a master of each language
rather than that the latter was a mere translation of the former. The
version is so natural in idiom and style that it appears to be an
original rather than a translation. In 1586 how many men were there who
could write such English? The marginal notes are in the exact style of
Bacon. “A similitude”— “A notable comparison” — occur frequently just as
the writer finds them again and again in Bacon’s handwriting in volumes
which he possesses. The book abounds in statements, phrases, and
quotations which are to be found in Bacon’s letters and works.</p>
<p>One significant fact must be mentioned. The first letter of the text
in the dedication in the first English translation is the letter S. It
is printed from a wood block (Fig. I.). Thirty-nine years after (in
1625) when the last edition of Bacon’s Essays — and, with the exception
of the small pamphlet containing his versification of certain Psalms,
the last publication during his life — was printed, that identical wood
block (Fig. II.) was again used to print the first letter in the
dedication of that book. Every defect and peculiarity in the one will be
found in the other. A search through many hundreds of books printed
during these thirty-nine years — 1586 to 1625 — has failed to find it
used elsewhere, except on one occasion, either then, before, or
since.</p>

<p>The first letter in the text of the dedication of the 1st edition of
the English translation of the “French Academie,” 1586. Printed at
London by G. Bollifant. The block is also used in a similar manner in
the 2nd edition, 1589. Londini Impensis, John Bishop.</p>

<p>The first letter in the text of the dedication of the 1625 edition of
Bacon’s Essays, printed in London, by John Haviland.</p>
<p>Both letters were printed from the same block.</p>
<p>Did Bacon mark his first work on philosophy and his last book by
printing the first letter in each from the same block?14</p>
