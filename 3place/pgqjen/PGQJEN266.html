<h4 id="section">129</h4>
<p>It remains for me to say a few words touching the excellency of the
end in view. Had they been uttered earlier, they might have seemed like
idle wishes, but now that hopes have been raised and unfair prejudices
removed, they may perhaps have greater weight. Also if I had finished
all myself, and had no occasion to call in others to help and take part
in the work, I should even now have abstained from such language lest it
might be taken as a proclamation of my own deserts. But since I want to
quicken the industry and rouse and kindle the zeal of others, it is
fitting that I put men in mind of some things.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, the introduction of famous discoveries
appears to hold by far the first place among human actions; and this was
the judgment of the former ages. For to the authors of inventions they
awarded divine honors, while to those who did good service in the state
(such as founders of cities and empires, legislators, saviors of their
country from long endured evils, quellers of tyrannies, and the like)
they decreed no higher honors than heroic. And certainly if a man
rightly compare the two, he will find that this judgment of antiquity
was just. For the benefits of discoveries may extend to the whole race
of man, civil benefits only to particular places; the latter last not
beyond a few ages, the former through all time. Moreover, the
reformation of a state in civil matters is seldom brought in without
violence and confusion; but discoveries carry blessings with them, and
confer benefits without causing harm or sorrow to any.</p>
<p>Again, discoveries are as it were new creations, and imitations of
God’s works, as the poet well sang:</p>
<p>To man’s frail race great Athens long ago</p>
<p>First gave the seed whence waving harvests grow,</p>
<p>And re-created all our life below.</p>
<p>And it appears worthy of remark in Solomon that, though mighty in
empire and in gold, in the magnificence of his works, his court, his
household, and his fleet, in the luster of his name and the worship of
mankind, yet he took none of these to glory in, but pronounced that “The
glory of God is to conceal a thing; the glory of the king to search it
out.”</p>
<p>Again, let a man only consider what a difference there is between the
life of men in the most civilized province of Europe, and in the wildest
and most barbarous districts of New India; he will feel it be great
enough to justify the saying that “man is a god to man,” not only in
regard to aid and benefit, but also by a comparison of condition. And
this difference comes not from soil, not from climate, not from race,
but from the arts.</p>
<p>Again, it is well to observe the force and virtue and consequences of
discoveries, and these are to be seen nowhere more conspicuously than in
those three which were unknown to the ancients, and of which the origin,
though recent, is obscure and inglorious; namely, printing, gunpowder,
and the magnet. For these three have changed the whole face and state of
things throughout the world; the first in literature, the second in
warfare, the third in navigation; whence have followed innumerable
changes, insomuch that no empire, no sect, no star seems to have exerted
greater power and influence in human affairs than these mechanical
discoveries.</p>
<p>Further, it will not be amiss to distinguish the three kinds and, as
it were, grades of ambition in mankind. The first is of those who desire
to extend their own power in their native country, a vulgar and
degenerate kind. The second is of those who labor to extend the power
and dominion of their country among men. This certainly has more
dignity, though not less covetousness. But if a man endeavor to
establish and extend the power and dominion of the human race itself
over the universe, his ambition (if ambition it can be called) is
without doubt both a more wholesome and a more noble thing than the
other two. Now the empire of man over things depends wholly on the arts
and sciences. For we cannot command nature except by obeying her.</p>
<p>Again, if men have thought so much of some one particular discovery
as to regard him as more than man who has been able by some benefit to
make the whole human race his debtor, how much higher a thing to
discover that by means of which all things else shall be discovered with
ease! And yet (to speak the whole truth), as the uses of light are
infinite in enabling us to walk, to ply our arts, to read, to recognize
one another — and nevertheless the very beholding of the light is itself
a more excellent and a fairer thing than all the uses of it — so
assuredly the very contemplation of things as they are, without
superstition or imposture, error or confusion, is in itself more worthy
than all the fruit of inventions.</p>
<p>Lastly, if the debasement of arts and sciences to purposes of
wickedness, luxury, and the like, be made a ground of objection, let no
one be moved thereby. For the same may be said of all earthly goods: of
wit, courage, strength, beauty, wealth, light itself, and the rest. Only
let the human race recover that right over nature which belongs to it by
divine bequest, and let power be given it; the exercise thereof will be
governed by sound reason and true religion.</p>
