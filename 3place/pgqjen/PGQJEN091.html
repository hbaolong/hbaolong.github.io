<h4 id="ii.-century.">II. Century.</h4>
<p>MVSICKE in the Practise, hath bin well pursued; And in good Variety;
But in the Theory, and especially in the Yeelding of the Causes of the
Practique, very weakly; Being reduced into certaine Mysticall
Subtilties, of no vse, and not much Truth. We shall therefore, after our
manner, ioyne the Contemplatiue and Actiue Part together.</p>
<p>All Sounds, are either Musicall Sounds, which we call Tones; Wherunto
there may be an Harmony; which Sounds are euer Equall; As Singing, the
Sounds of Stringed, and Wind-Instruments, the Ringing of Bells,
andandandandc. Or Immusicall Sounds; which are euer Vnequall; Such as
are the Voice in Speaking, all Whisperings, all Voices of Beasts, and
Birds, (except they bee Singing Birds;) all Percussions, of Stones,
Wood, Parchment, Skins (as in Drummes;) and infinite others.</p>
<p>The Sounds that produce Tones, are euer from such Bodies, as are in
their Parts and Pores Equall; As well as the Sounds themselues are
Equall; And such are the Percussions of Metall, as in Bells; Of Glasse,
as in the Fillipping of a Drinking Glasse; Of Aire, as in Mens voices
whilest they Sing, in Pipes, Whistles, Organs, Stringed Instruments,
andandandandc. And of Water; as in the Nightingale-Pipes of Regalls, or
Organs, and other Hydranlickes; which the Ancients had, and Nere did so
much esteeme, but are now lost. And if any Man thinke, that the String
of the Bowe, and the String of the Viall, are neither of them Equall
Bodies; And yet produce Tones; he is in an errour. For the Sound is not
created between the Bowe or Plectrum, and the String; But between the
String and the Aire; No more then it is between the Finger or Quill, and
the String, in other Instruments. So there are (in effect) but three
Percussions that create Tones; Percussions of Metalls, (comprehending
Glasse, and the like;) Percussions of Aire; and Percussions of
Water.</p>
<p>The Diapason or Eight in Musicke is the sweetest Concord; Insomuch,
as it is in effect an Vnison; As we see in Lutes, that are strung in the
Base Strings with two strings, one an Eight aboue another; Which make
but as one Sound. And euery Eighth Note in Ascent, (as from Eight to
Fifteene: from Fifteene to twenty two, and so in infinitum,) are but
Scales of Diapason. The Cause is darke, and hath not beene rendred by
any; And therfore would be better contemplated. It seemeth that Aire,
(which is the Subiect of Sounds) in Sounds that are not Tones, (which
are all vnequall, as hath beene said) admitteth much Varietie; As wee
see in the Voices of Liuing Creatures; And likewise in the Voices of
seuerall Men; (for we are capable to discerne seuerall Men by their
Voices;) And in the Coniugation of Letters, whence Articulate Sounds
proceed; Which of all others are most various. But in the Sounds which
we call Tones, (that are euer Equall) the Aire is not able to cast it
selfe into any such varietie; But is forced to recurre into one and the
same Posture or Figure, onely differing in Greatnesse and Smalnesse. So
we see Figures may be made of lines, Crooked and Straight, in infinite
Varietie, where there is Inequalitie; But Circles, or Squares, or
Triangles Equilaterall, (which are all Figures, of Equall lines) can
differ but in Greater, or Lesser.</p>
<p>It is to be noted (the rather left any Man should thinke, that there
is any thing in this Number of Eight, to create the Diapason), that this
Computation of Eight, is a thing rather receiued, than any true
Computation. For a true Computation ought euer to bee, by Distribution
into equall Portions. Now there be interuenient in the Rise of Eight (in
Tones) two Beemolls, or Halfe-notes; So as if you diuide the Tones
equally, the Eight is but Seuen whole and equall Notes; And if you
subdiuide that into Halfe Notes, (as it is in the Stops of a Lute), it
maketh the Number of thirteene.</p>
<p>Yet this true; That in the ordinary Rises and Falles of the Voice of
Man, (not measuring the Tone by whole Notes, and halfe Notes, which is
the Equall Measure;) there fall out to be two Beemols (as hath beene
said) betweene the Vnison and the Diapason: And this Varying is
naturall. For if a Man would endeuour to raise or fall his Voice, still
by HalfeNotes, like the Stops of a Lute; or by whole Notes alone,
without Halfes; as farre as an Eight; he will not be able to frame his
Voice vnto it. Which sheweth, that after euery three whole Notes Nature
requireth, for all Harmonicall vse, one halfe Note to be interposed.</p>
<p>It is to be considered, that whatsoeuer Vertue is in Numbers, for
Conducing to Concent of Notes, is rather to bee ascribed to the
Ante-Number, than to the Entire Number; As namely, that the Sound
retarneth after Six, or after Twelue; So that the Seuenth, or the
Thirteenth, is not the Matter, but the Sixth, or the Twelfth; And the
Seuenth and the Thirteenth are but the limits and Boundaries of the
returne.</p>
<p>The Concords in Musick which are Perfect, or Semiperfect, betweene
the Vnison, and the Diapason, are the Fifth, which is the most Perfect;
the Third next; And the Sixth which is more harsh: And as the Ancients
esteemed, and so doe my selfe and some Other yet, the Fourth which they
call Diatessaron. As for the Tenth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and so in
infinitum; they be but Recurrences of the Former; viz. of the Third, the
Fifth, and the Sixth; being an Eight respectiuely from them.</p>
<p>For Discords, the Second, and the Seuenth, are of all others the most
odious, in Harmony, to the Sense; whereof the One is next aboue the
Vnison, the Other next vnder the Diapason: which may shew, that Harmony
requireth a competent distance of Notes.</p>
<p>In Harmony, if there be not a Discord to the Base, it doth not
disturbe the Harmony, though there be a Discord to the Higher Parts; So
the Discord be not of the Two that are Odious; And therfore the ordinary
Concent of Foure Parts consisteth of an Eight, a Fifth, and a Third to
the Base: But that Fifth is a Fourth to the Treble, and the Third is a
Sixth. And the Cause is, for that the Base striking more Aire, doth
ouercome and drowne the Treble. (vnlesse the Discord be very Odious;)
And so hideth a small Imperfection. For we see, that in one of the lower
Strings of a Lute, there soundeth not the Sound of the Treble, not any
Mixt Sound, but onely the Sound of the Base.</p>
<p>We haue no Musicke of Quarter-Notes; And it may be, they are not
capable of Harmony; For we see the Halfe-Notes themselues doe but
interpose sometimes. Neuerthelesse we haue some Slides, or Relishes, of
the Voice, or Strings, as it were continued without Notes, from one Tone
to another, rising or falling, which are delightfull.</p>
<p>The Causes of that which is Pleasing, or Ingrate to the Hearing, may
receiue light by that, which is Pleasing or Ingrate to the Sight. There
be two Things Pleasing to the Sight, (leauing Pictures, and Shapes
aside, which are but Secondary Obiects; And please or displease but in
Memory;) these two are, Colours, and Order. The Pleasing of Colour
symbolizeth with the Pleasing of any Single Tone to the Eare; But the
Pleasing of Order doth symbolize with Harmony. And therfore we see in
Garden-knots, and the Frets of Houses, and all equall and well-answering
Figures, (as Globes, Pyramides, Cones, Cylinders, andandandandc.) how
they please; whereas Vnequall Figures are but Deformities. And both
these Pleasures, that of the Eye, and that of the Eare, are but the
Effects of Equality; Good Proportion, or Correspondence: So that (out of
Question,) Equality, and Correspondence, are the Causes of Harmony. But
to finde the Proportion of that Correspondence, is more abstruse; wherof
notwithstanding we shall speake somewhat, (when we handle Tones,) in the
generall Enquiry of Sounds.</p>
<p>Tones are not so apt altogether to procure Sleep, as some other
Sounds; As the Wind, the Purling of Water, Humming of Bees, a Sweet
Voice of one that readeth, andandandandc. The Cause whereof is, for that
Tones, because they are Equall, and slide not, doe more strike and erect
the Sense, than the other. And Ouermuch Attention hindreth Sleepe.</p>
<p>There be in Musick certaine Figures, or Tropes; almost agreeing with
the Figures of Rhetoricke; And with the Affections of the Minde, and
other Senses. First, the Diuision and Quauering, which please so much in
Musick, haue an Agreement with the Glittering of Light; As the
MooneBeames playing vpon a Waue. Againe, the Falling from a Discord to a
Concord, which maketh great Sweetnesse in Musick, hath an Agreement with
the Affections, which are reintegrated to the better, after some
dislikes: It agreeth also with the Taste, which is soone glutted with
that which is sweet alone. The Sliding from the Close or Cadence, hath
an Agreement with the Figure in Rhetoricke, which they call Praeter
Expectatum; For there is a Pleasure euen in Being deceined. The Reports,
and Fuges, haue an Agreement with the Figures in Rhetorick, of
Repetition, and Traduction. The Tripla’s, and Changing of Times, haue an
Agreement with the Changes of Motions; As when Galliard Time, and
Measure Time, are in the Medley of one Dance.</p>
<p>It hath been anciently held, and obserued, that the Sense of Hearing,
and the Kinds of Musick, haue most Operation vpon Manners; As to
Incourage Men, and make them warlike; To make them Soft and Effeminate;
To make them Graue; To make them Light; To make them Gentle and inclined
to Pitty, andandandandc. The Cause is, for that the Sense of Hearing
striketh the Spirits more immediatly, than the other Senses; And more
incorporeally than the Smelling: For the Sight, Taste, and Feeling, haue
their Organs, not of so present and immediate Accesse to the Spirits, as
the Hearing hath. And as for the Smelling, (which indeed worketh also
immediatly vpon the Spirits, and is sorcible while the Obiect
remaineth,) it is with a Communication of the Breath, or Vapour of the
Obiect Odorate: But Harmony entring easily, and Mingling not at all, and
Comming with a manifest Motion; doth by Custome of often Affecting the
Spirits, and Putting them into one kinde of Posture, alter not a little
the Nature of the Spirits, euen when the Obiect is remoued. And
therefore we see, that Tunes and Aires, euen in their owne Nature, haue
in themselues some Affinity with the Affections; As there be Merry
Tunes, Dolefull Tunes, Solemne Tunes; Tunes inclining Mens mindes to
Pitty; Warlike Tunes; andandandandc. So as it is no Maruell, if they
alter the Spirits; considering that Tunes haue a Predisposition to the
Motion of the Spirits in themselues. But yet it hath been noted, that
though this variety of Tunes, doth dispose the Spirits to variety of
Passions, conforme vnto them; yet generally, Musick feedeth that
disposition of the Spirits which it findeth. We see also that seuerall
Aires, and Tunes, doe please seuerall Nations, and Persons, according to
the Sympathy they haue with their Spirits.</p>
<p>Perspectiue hath been with some diligence inquired; And so hath the
Nature of Sounds, in some sort, as far as concerneth Musick. But the
Nature of Sounds in generall, hath been superficially obserued. It is
one of the subrillest Peeces of Nature. And besides, I practise, as I
doe aduise; which is, after long Inquiry of Things, Immerse in Matter,
to interpose some Subiect, which is Immateriate, or lesse Materiate;
Such as this of Sounds; To the end, that the Intellect may be Rectified,
and become not Partiall.</p>
<p>It is first to be considered, what Great Motions there are in Natute,
which passe without Sound, or Noise. The Heauens turne about, in a most
rapide Motion, without Noise to vs perceiued; Though in some Dreames
they haue been said to make an excellent Musick. So the Motions of the
Comets, and Fiery Meteors (as Stella Cadens, andandandandc.) yeeld no
Noise. And if it be thought, that it is the Greatnesse of distance from
vs, whereby the Sound cannot be heard; We see that Lightnings, and
Coruscations, which are neere at hand, yeeld no Sound neither. And yet
in all these, there is a Percussion and Diuision of the Aire. The Windes
in the Vpper Region (which moue the Clouds aboue (which we call the
Racke) and are not perceiued below) passe without Noise. The lower
Windes in a Plaine, except they be strong, make no Noise; But amongst
Trees, the Noise, of such Windes will be perceiued. And the Windes
(generally) when they make a Noise, doe euer make it vnequally, Rising
and Falling, and sometimes (when they are vehement,) Trembling at the
Height of their Blast. Raine, or Haile falling, (though vehemently,)
yeeldeth no Noise, in passing through the Aire, till it fall vpon the
Ground, Water, Houses, or the like. Water in a Riuer (though a swift
Streame) is not heard in the Channell, but runneth in Silence, if it be
of any depth; But the very Streame vpon Shallowes, of Grauell, or
Pebble, will be heard. And Waters, when they beat vpon the Shore, or are
straitned, (as in the falls of Bridges;) Or are dashed against
themselues, by Windes, giue a Roaring Noise. Any peece of Timber, or
Hard Body, being thrust forwards by another Body Contiguous, without
knocking, giueth no Noise. And so Bodies in weighing, one vpon another,
though the Vpper Body presse the lower Body downe, make no Noise. So the
Motion in the Minute Parts of any solide Body, (which is the Principall
Cause of Violent Motion, though vnobserued;) passeth without Sound; For
that Sound, that is heard sometimes, is produced onely by the Breaking
of the Aire; And not by the Impulsion of the Parts. So it is manifest;
That where the Anteriour Body giueth way, as fast as the Posteriour
commeth on, it maketh no Noise; be the Motion neuer so great, or
swift.</p>
<p>Aire open, and at large, maketh no Noise, except it be sharply
percussed; As in the Sound of a String, where Aire is percussed by a
hard, and stiffe Body; And with a sharp loose; For if the String be not
strained, it maketh no Noise. But where the Aire is pent, and straitned,
there Breath, or other Blowing, (which carry but a gentle Percussion,)
suffice to create Sound; As in Pipes, and winde-Instruments. But then
you must note, that in Recorders, which goe with a gentle Breath, the
Concaue of the Pipe, were it not for the Fipple, that straitneth the
Aire, (much more than the Simple Concaue;) would yeeld no Sound. For as
for other windeInstruments, they require a forcible Breath; As Trumpets,
Cornets, Hunters-hornes, andandandandc. Which appeareth by the
blowne-cheeks of him that windeth them. Organs also are blowne with a
strong winde, by the Bellowes. And note againe, that some kinde of
winde-Instruments, are blowne at a small Hole in the side, which
straitneth the Breath at the first Entrance; The rather, in respect of
their Trauerse, and Stop aboue the Hole, which performeth the Fipples
Part; As it is seene in Flutes, and Fifes, which will not giue Sound, by
a Blast at the end, as Recorders, andandandandc. doe. Likewise in all
Whistling, you contract the Mouth; And to make it more sharp, Men
sometimes vse their Finger. But in Open Aire, if you throw a Stone, or a
Dart, they giue no Sound: No more doe Bullets, except they happen to be
a little hollowed in the Casting; Which Hollownesse penneth the Aire:
Not yet Arrowes, except they be ruffled in their Feathers, which
likewise penneth the Aire. As for Small whistles, or Shepheards Oa —
Pipes; they giue a Sound, because of their extreame Slendernesse,
whereby the Aire is more pent, than in a Wider Pipe. Againe, the Voices
of Men, and Liuing Creatures, passe through the throat, which penneth
the Breath. As for the Iewes Harpe, it is a sharp Percussion; And
besides, hath the vantage of penning the Aire in the Mouth.</p>
<p>Solide Bodies, if they be very softly percussed, giue no Sound; As
when a man treadeth very softly vpon Boards. So Chests or Doores in
faire weather, when they open easily, giue no Sound. And Cart-wheeles
squeak not, when they are liquoured.</p>
<p>The Flame of Tapers, or Candles, though it be a swift Motion, and
breaketh the Aire, yet passeth without Sound. Aire in Ouens, though (no
doubt) it doth (as it were) boyle, and dilate it selfe, and is
repercussed; yet it is without Noise.</p>
<p>Flame percussed by Aire, giueth a Noise; As in Blowing of the Fire by
Bellowes; Greater, than if the Bellowes should blow vpon the Aire it
selfe. And so likewise Flame percussing the Aire strongly, (as when
Flame suddenly taketh, and openeth,) giueth a Noise; So, Great Flames,
whiles the one impelleth the other, giue a bellowing Sound.</p>
<p>There is a Conceit runneth abroad, that there should be a white
Powder, which will discharge a Peece without Noise; which is a dangerous
Experiment, if it should be true: For it may cause secret Murthers. But
it seemeth to me vnpossible; For, if the Aire pent, be driuen forth, and
strike the Aire open, it will certainly make a Noise. As for the white
Powder (if any such thing be, that may extinguish, or dead the Noise,)
it is like to be a Mixture of Petre, and Sulphur, without Coale. For
Petre alone will not take Fire. And if any Man thinke, that the Sound
may be extinguished, or deaded, by discharging the Pent Aire, before it
commeth to the Mouth of the Peece, and to the Open Aire; That is not
probable; For it will make more diuided Sounds; As if you should make a
Crosse Barrell hollow, thorow the Barrell of a Peece, it may be, it
would giue seuerall Sounds, both at the Nose, and at the Sides. But I
conceiue, that if it were possible, to bring to passe, that there should
be no Aire pent at the Mouth of the Peece, the Bullet might fly with
small, or no Noise, For first it is certaine, there is no Noise in the
Percussion of the Flame vpon the Bullet. Next the Bullet, in piercing
thorow the Aire, maketh no Noise; As hath beene said. And then, if there
be no Pent Aire that striketh vpon Open Aire, there is no Cause of
Noise; And yet the Flying of the Bullet will not be stayed. For that
Motion (as hath beene oft said) is in the Parts of the Bullet, and not
in the Aire. So as triall must be made by taking some small Concaue of
Metall, no more than you mean to fill with Powder; And laying the Bullet
in the Mouth of it, halfe out into the Open Aire.</p>
<p>I heard it affirmed by a Man, that was a great Dealer in Secrets, but
he was but vaine; That there was a Conspiracy (which himselfe hindred,)
to haue killed Queene Mary, Sister to Queene Elizabeth, by
BurningGlasse, when shee walked in Saint Iames Parke, from the Leads of
the House. But thus much (no doubt) is true; That if Burning-Glasses
could be brought to a great strength, (as they talke generally of
Burning-Glasses, that are able to burne a Nauy,) the Percussion of the
Aire alone, by such a Burning-Glasse, would make no Noise; No more than
is found in Cornscations, and Lightnings, without Thunders.</p>
<p>I suppose, that Impression of the Aire with Sounds, asketh a time to
be conueighed to the Sense; As well as the Impression of Species
visible: Or else they will not be heard. And therefore, as the Bullet
moueth so swift, that it is Inuisible; So the same Swiftnesse of Motion
maketh it Inaudible: For we see, that the Apprehension of the Eye, is
quicker than that of the Eare.</p>
<p>All Eruptions of Aire, though small and slight, giue an Entity of
Sound; which we call Crackling, Pussing, Spitting, andandandandc. As in
Bay-salt, and Bayleaues, cast into the Fire; So in Chesnuts, when they
leape forth of the Ashes; So in Greene Wood laid vpon the Fire,
especially Roots; So in Candles that spit Flame, if they be wet; So in
Rasping, Sneezing, andandandandc. So in a Rose-leafe gathered together
into the fashion of a Purse, and broken vpon the Fore-head, or Backe of
the Hand, as Children vse.</p>
<p>The Cause giuen of Sound, that it should be an Elision of the Aire
(wherby, if they meane any thing, they meane a Cutting, or Diuiding, or
else an Attenuating of the Aire) is but a Terme of Ignorance: And the
Motion is but a Catch of the Wit vpon a few Instances; As the Manner is
in the Philosophy Receiued. And it is common with Men, that if they haue
gotten a Pretty Expression, by a Word of Art, that Expression, goeth
currant; though it be empty of Matter. This Conceit of Elision,
appeareth most manifestly to befalse, in that the Sound of a Bell,
String, or the like, continueth melting, some time, after the
Percussion; But ceaseth straight-waies, if the Bell, or String, be
touched and stayed: wheras, if it were the Elision of the Aire, that
made the Sound, it could not be, that the Touch of the Bell, or String,
should extinguish so suddenly that Motion, caused by the Elision of the
Aire. This appeareth yet more manifestly, by Chiming with a Hammer, vpon
the Out-side of a Bell; For the Sound will be according to the inward
Concaue of the Bell; whereas the Elision, or Attenuation of the Aire,
cannot be but onely betweene the Hammer, and the Out-side of the Bell,
So againe, if it were an Elision, a broad Hammer, and a Bodkin, strucke
vpon Metall, would giue a diuers Tone; As well as a diuers Loudnesse:
But they doe not so; For though the Sound of the one be Louder, and of
the other Softer, yet the Tone is the same. Besides, in Eccho’s, (wherof
some are as loud as the Originall Voice, there is no new Elision; but a
Repercussion onely. But that which conuinceth it most of all, is, that
Sounds are generated, where there is no Aire at all. But these and the
like Conceits, when Men haue cleared their vnderstanding, by the light
of Experience, will scatter, and breake vp like a Mist.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that Sound is not produced at the first, but with
some Locall Motion of the Aire, or Flame, or some other Medium; Nor yet
without some Resistance, either in the Aire, or the Body Percussed. For
if there be a meere Yeelding, or Cession, it produceth no Sound; As hath
beene said. And therin Sounds differ from Light, and Colours; which
passe thorow the Aire, or other Bodies, without any Locall Motion of the
Aire; either at the first, or after. But you must attentiuely
distinguish, betweene the Locall Motion of the Aire, (which is but
Vehiculum Caussae, A Carrier of the Sounds,) and the Sounds themselues,
Conueighed in the Aire. For as to the former, we see manifestly, that no
Sound is produced (no not by Aire it selfe against other Aire, as in
Organs, andandandandc.) but with a perceptible Blast of the Aire; And
with some Resistance of the Aire strucken. For euen all Speech, (which
is one of the gentlest Motions of Aire,) is with Expulsion of a little
Breath. And all Pipes haue a Blast, as well as a Sound. We see also
manifestly, that Sounds are carried with Wind: And therefore Sounds will
be heard further with the Wind, than against the Wind; And likewise doe
rise and fall with the Intension or Remission of the Wind. But for the
Impression of the Sound, it is quite another Thing; And is vtterly
without any Locall Motion of the Aire, Perceptible; And in that
resembleth the Species visible: For after a Man hath lured, or a Bell is
rung, we cannot discerne any Perceptible Motion (at all) in the Aire, a
long as the Sound goeth; but only at the first. Neither doth the Wind
(as far as it carrieth a Voice,) with the Motion therof, confound any of
the Delicate, and Articulate Figurations of the Aire, in Variety of
Words. And if a Man speake a good loudnesse, against the Flame of a
Candle, it will not make it tremble much; though most, when those
Letters are pronounced, which contract the Mouth; As F, S,V, and some
others. But Gentle Breathing, or Blowing without speaking, will moue the
Candle far more. And it is the more probable, that Sound is without any
Locall Motion of the Aire, because as it differeth from the Sight, in
that it needeth a Locall Motion of the Aire at first; So it paralleleth
in so many other things with the Sight, and Radiation of Things visible;
Which (without all question) induce no Locall Motion in the Aire, as
hath beene said.</p>
<p>Neuerthelesse it is true, that vpon the Noise of Thunder, and great
Ordnance; Glasse windowes will shake; and Fishes are thought to be
frayed with the Motion, caused by Noise vpon the water. But these
Effects are from the Locall Motion of the Aire, which is a Concomitant
of the Sound, (as hath beene said;) and not from the Sound.</p>
<p>It hath beene anciently reported, and is still receiued, that Extreme
Applanses, and Shouting of People assembled in great Multitudes, haue so
rarified, and broken the Aire, that Birds flying ouer, haue fallen
downe, the Aire being not able to support them. And it is beleeued by
some, that Great Ringing of Bells in populous Cities, hath chased away
Thunder: and also dissipated Pestilent Aire: All which may be also from
the Concussion of the Aire, and not from the Sound.</p>
<p>A very great Sound, neare hand, hath strucken many Dease; And at the
Instant they haue found, as it were, the breaking of a Skin or Parchment
in their Eare: And my Selfe standing neare one that Lured loud, and
shrill, had suddenly an Offence, as if somewhat had broken, or beene
dislocated in my Eare; And immediately after, a loud Ringing; (Not an
ordinary Singing, or Hissing, but far louder, and differing;) so as I
feared some Deafenesse. But after some halfe Quarter of an Houre it
vanished. This Effect may be truly referred vnto the Sound: For (as is
commonly receiued) an ouer-potent Obiect doth destroy the Sense; And
Spirituall Species, (both Visible, and Audible,) will worke vpon the
Sensories, though they moue not any other Body.</p>
<p>In Delation of Sounds, the Enclosure of them preserueth them, and
causeth them to be heard further. And wee finde in Roules of Parchment,
or Trunckes, the Mouth being laid to the one end of the Rowle of
Parchment, or Truncke, and the Eare to the other, the Sound is heard
much further, than in the Open Aire; The Cause is, for that the Sound
spendeth, and is dissipated in the Open Aire; But in such Concaues it is
conserued, and contracted. So also in a Peece of Ordnance, if you speak
in the Touch-hole, and another lay his Eare to the Mouth of the Peece,
the Sound passeth, and is farre better heard, than in the Open Aire.</p>
<p>It is further to be considered, how it proueth and worketh, when the
Sound is not enclosed all the Length of his Way, but passeth partly
through open Aire; As where you speake some distance from a Truncke; or
where the Eare is some distance from the Truncke; at the other End; Or
where both Mouth and Eare are distant from the Truncke. And it is tried,
that in a long Truncke, of some eight or ten foot, the Sound is holpen,
though both the Mouth, and the Eare be a handfull, or more, from the
Ends of the Truncke; And somewhat more holpen, when the Eare of the
Hearer is neare, than when the Mouth of the Speaker. And it is certaine,
that the Voice is better heard in a Chamber from abroad, than abroad
from within the Chamber.</p>
<p>As the Enclosure, that is Round about and Entire, preserueth the
Sound; So doth a Semi-Concaue, though in a lesse degree. And therefore,
if you diuide a Truncke, or a Cane into two, and one speake at the one
end, and you lay your Eare at the other, it will carry the Voice
further, than in the Aire at large. Nay further, if it be not a full
Semi-Concaue; but if you doe the like vpon the Mast of a Ship, or a long
Pole, or a Peece of Ordnance (though one speake vpon the Surface of the
Ordnance, and not at any of the Bores;) the Voice will be heard further,
than in the Aire at large.</p>
<p>It would be tried, how, and with what proportion of disaduantage, the
Voice will be carried in an Horne, which is a line Arched; Or in a
Trumpet, which is a line Retorted; Or in some Pipe that were
Sinuous.</p>
<p>It is certaine, (howsoeuer it crosse the Receiued Opinion) that
Sounds may be created without Aire, though Aire be the most fauourable
Deferent of Sounds. Take a Vessell of Water, and knap a paire of Tongs
some depth within the Water, and you shall heare the Sound of the Tongs
well, and not much diminished; And yet there is no Aire at all
present.</p>
<p>Take one Vessell of Siluer, and another of Wood, and fill each of
them full of Water, and then knap the Tongs together, as before, about
an handfull from the Bottome, and you shall finde the Sound much more
Resounding from the Vessell of Siluer, than from that of Wood; And yet
if there be not water in the Vessell, so that yo knap the Tongs in the
Aire, you shall finde no difference, betweene the Siluer and Woodden
Vessell. Whereby, beside the maine point of creating Sound without Aire,
you may collect two Things: The one, that the Sound communicateth with
the Bottome of the Vessell: The other, that such a Communication passeth
farre better, thorow Water, than Aire.</p>
<p>Strike any Hard Bodies together, in the Middest of a Flame, and you
shall heare the Sound, with little difference, from the Sound in the
Aire.</p>
<p>The Pneumaticall Part, which is in all Tangible Bodies, and hath some
Affinity with the Aire, performeth, in some degree, the Parts of the
Aire; As when you knocke vpon an Emptie Barrell, the Sound is (in part)
created by the Aire on the Out-side; And (in part) by the Aire in the
Inside; For the Sound will be greater or lesser, as the Barrell is more
Emptie, or more full; But yet the Sound participateth also with the
Spirit in the Wood, thorow which it passeth, from the Outside to the
Inside: And so it commeth to passe, in the Chiming of Bells, on the
Outside; where also the Sound passeth to the Inside: And a number of
other like Instances, whereof we shall speake more, when we handle the
Communication of Sounds.</p>
<p>It were extreame Grossenesse to thinke, (as wee haue partly touched
before,) that the Sound in Strings is made, or produced, betweene the
Hand and the String, or the Quill and the String, or the Bow and the
String: For those are but Vehicula Motûs, Passages to the Creation of
the Sound; the Sound being produced betweene the String and the Aire;
And that not by any Impulsion of the Aire from the first Motion of the
String; but by the Returne or Result of the String, which was strained
by the Touch, to his former Place: which Motion of Result is quicke and
sharpe; Wheras the first Motion, is soft and dull. So the Bow tortureth
the String continually, and thereby holdeth it in a Continuall
Trepidation.</p>
<p>Take a Truncke, and let one whistle at the one End, and bold your
Eare at the other, and you shall finde the Sound strike so sharpe, as
you can scarce endure it. The Cause is, for that Sound diffuseth it
selfe in round; And so spendeth it Selfe; But if the Sound, which would
scatter in Open Aire, be made to goe all into a Canale; It must needs
giue greater force to the Sound. And so you may note, that Enclosures
doe not onely preserue Sound, but also Encrease and Sharpen it.</p>
<p>A Hunters Horne, being greater at one end, than at the other, doth
encrease the Sound more, than if the Horne were all of an equall Bore.
The Cause is, for that the Aire, and Sound, being first contracted at
the leffer End, and afterwards hauing more Roome to spread at the
greater End; doe dilate themselues; And in Comming out strike more Aire;
whereby the Sound is the Greater, and Baser. And euen Hunters Hornes,
which are sometimes made straight, and not Oblique, are euer greater at
the lower end. It would be tried also in Pipes, being made far larger at
the lower End: Or being made with a Belly towards the lower End, And
then issuing into a straight Concaue againe.</p>
<p>There is in Saint Iames Fields, a Conduit of Bricke, vnto which
ioyneth a low Vault; And at the End of that, a Round House of Stone: And
in the Bricke Conduit there is a Window; And in the Round House a Slit
or Rift of some little breadth: If you crie out in the Rift, it will
make a fearfull Roaring at the Window. The Cause is the same with the
former; For that all Concaues, that proceed from more Narrow to more
Broad, doe amplifie the Sound at the Comming out.</p>
<p>Hawkes Bells, that haue Holes in the sides, giue a greater Ring, than
if the Pellet did strike vpon Brasse, in the Open Aire. The Cause is the
same with the first Instance of the Trancke; Namely, for that the Sound
Enclosed with the Sides of the Bell, commeth forth at the Holes vnspent,
and more strong.</p>
<p>In Drums, the Closenesse round about, that preserueth the Sound from
dispersing, maketh the Noise come forth at the Drum-Hole, farre more
loud, and strong, than if you should strike vpon the like Skin, extended
in the Open Aire. The Cause is the same with the two precedent.</p>
<p>Sounds are better heard, and further off, in an Euening, or in the
Night, than at the Noone, or in the Day. The Cause is, for that in the
Day, when the Aire is more Thin, (no doubt) the Sound pierceth better;
But when the Aire is more Thicke, (as in the Night) the Sound spendeth
and spreadeth abroad lesse: And so it is a Degree of Enclosure. As for
the Night, it is true also, that the Generall Silence helpeth.</p>
<p>There be two Kinds of Reflexions of Sounds; The one at Distance,
which is the Eccho; Wherein the Originall is heard distinctly, and the
Reflexion also distinctly; Of which we shall speake hereafter: The other
in Concurrence; When the Sound Reflecting (the Reflexion being neare at
hand) returneth immediatly vpon the Originall, and so iterateth it not,
but amplifieth it. Therefore we see, that Musicke vpon the water
soundeth more; And so likewise Musicke is better in Chambers
Wainscotted, than Hanged.</p>
<p>The Strings of a Lute, or Violl, or Virginalls, doe giue a far
greater Sound, by reason of the Knot, and Board, and Concaue vnderneath,
than if there were nothing but onely the Flat of a Board, without that
Hollow and Knot, to let in the Vpper Aire into the Lower. The Cause is,
the Communication of the Vpper Aire with the Lower; And Penning of both
from Expence, or Dispersing.</p>
<p>An Irish Harpe hath Open Aire on both sides of the Strings: And it
hath the Concaue or Belly, not along the Strings, but at the End of the
Strings. It maketh a more Resounding Sound, than a Bandora, Orpharion,
or Citterne, which haue likewise Wire-strings. I iudge the Cause to be,
for that Open Aire on both Sides helpeth, so that there be a Concaue;
Which is therefore best placed at the End.</p>
<p>In a Virginall, when the Lid is downe, it maketh a more exile Sound,
than when the Lid is open. The Cause is, for that all Shutting in of
Aire, where there is no competent Vent, dampeth the Sound. Which
maintaineth likewise the former Instance; For the Belly of the Lute, or
Vi-ll, doth pen the Aire somewhat.</p>
<p>There is a Church at Glocester, (and as I haue heard the like is in
some other places;) where if you speake against a Wall, softly, another
shall heare your Voice better a good way off, than neare hand. Enquire
more particularly of the Frame of that Place. I suppose there is some
Vault, or Hollow, or Isle, behinde the Wall, and some Passage to it
towards the further end of that Wall, against which you speake; So as
the Voice, of him that speaketh, slideth along the Wall, and then
entreth at some Passage, and communicateth with the Aire of the Hollow;
For it is preserued somewhat by the plaine wall; but that is too weake
to giue a Sound Audible, till it hath communicated with the backe
Aire.</p>
<p>Strike vpon a Bowstring, and lay the Horne of the Bow neare your
Eare, and it will encrease the Sound, and make a degree of a Tone. The
Cause is, for that the Sensory, by reason of the Close Holding, is
percussed before the Aire disperseth. The like is, if yo hold the Horne
betwixt your Teeth. But that is a plaine Delation of the Sound; from the
Teeth, to the Instrument of Hearing; For there is a great Entercourse
betweene those two Parts; As appeareth by this; That a Harsh Grating
Tune setteth the Teeth on edge. The like falleth out, if the Horne of
the Bow be put vpon the Temples; But that is but the Slide of the Sound
from thence to the Eare.</p>
<p>If you take a Rod of Iron, or Brasse, and hold the one end to your
Eare, and strike vpon the other, it maketh a fat greater Sound, than the
like Stroke vpon the Rod, not so made Contiguous to the Eare. By which,
and by some other Instances, that haue beene partly touched, it should
appeare; That Sounds doe not onely slide vpon the Surface of a Smooth
Body, but doe also communicate with the Spirits, that are in the Pores
of the Body.</p>
<p>I remember in Trinity Colledge in Cambridge, there was an Vpper
Chamber, which being thought weake in the Roofe of it, was supported by
a Pillar of Iron, of the bignesse of ones Arme, in the middest of the
Chamber; Which if you had strucke, it would make a little flat Noise in
the Roome where it was strucke; But it would make a great Bombe in the
Chamber beneath.</p>
<p>The Sound which is made by Buckets in a Well, when they touch vpon
the Water; Or when they strike vpon the side of the Well; Or when two
Buckets dash the one against the other; These Sounds are deeper, and
suller, than if the like Percussion were made in the Open Aire. The
Cause is, the Penning and Enclosure of the Aire, in the Concaue of the
Well.</p>
<p>Barrells placed in a Roome vnder the Floare of a Chamber, make all
Noises in the same Chamber, more Full and Resounding.</p>
<p>So that there be fine wayes (in generall,) of Maioration of Sounds:
Enclosure Simple; Enclosure with Dilatation; Communication; Reflexion
Concurrent; and Approach to the Sensory.</p>
<p>For Exility of the Voice, or other Sounds: It is certaine, that the
Voice doth passe thorow Solide and Hard Bodies, if they be not too
thick. And thorow Water; which is likewise a very Close Body, and such
an one, as letteth not in Aire. But then the Voice, or other Sound, is
reduced, by such passage, to a great Weaknesse, or Exility. If therefore
you stop the Holes of a Howkes Bell, it will make no Ring, but a flat
Noise, or Rattle. And so doth the Aëtites, or Eagles Stone, which hath a
little Stone within it.</p>
<p>And as for Water, it is a certaine Triall: Let a Man goe into a Bath,
and take a Paile, and turne the Bottome vpward, and carry the Mouth of
it, (Euen,) downe to the Leuell of the Water; and so presse it downe
vnder the Water, some handfull and an halfe, still keeping it euen, that
it may not tilt on either side, andandandand so the Aire get out: Then
let him that is in the Bath, diue with his Head so far vnder Water, as
he may put his Head into the Paile; andandandand there wil come as much
Aire bubling forth, as will make Roome for his Head. Then let him speak;
and any that shal stand without, shal heare his Voice plainly; but yet
made extreme sharp and exile, like the Voice of Puppets: But yet the
Articulate Sounds of the Words will not be co¯founded. Note that it may
be much more handsomely done, if the Paile be put ouer the Mans head
aboue Water, and then he cowre downe, and the Paile be pressed downe
with him. Note that a Man must kneele or sit, that he may be lower than
the Water. A Man would thinke, that the Sicilian Poet had knowledge of
this Experiment; For he saith; That Hercules Page Hylas went with a
Water-pot, to fill it at a pleasant Fountaine, that was neere the Shore,
and that the Nymphs of the Fountaine fell in loue with the Boy, and
pulled him vnder Water, keeping him aliue; And that Hercules missing his
Page, called him by his Name, aloud, that all the Shore rang of it; And
that Hylas from within the Water, answered his Master; But (that which
is to the present purpose) with so small and exile a Voice, as Hercules
thought he had beene three miles off, when the Fountaine (indeed) was
fast by.</p>
<p>In Lutes, and Instruments of Strings, if you stop a String high,
(whereby it hath lesse Scope to tremble) the Sound is more Treble, but
yet more dead.</p>
<p>Take two Sawcers, and strike the Edge of the one against the Bottome
of the other, within a Paile of Water; And you shall finde, that as you
put the Sawcers lower, and lower, the Sound groweth more flat; euen
while Part of the Sawcer is aboue the Water; But that Flatnesse of Sound
is ioyned with a Harshnesse of Sound; which (no doubt) is caused by the
Inequalitie of the Sound, which commeth from the Part of the Sawcer
vnder the Water, and from the Part aboue. But when the Sawcer is wholly
vnder the Water, the Sound becommeth more cleare, but farre more low;
And as if the Sound came from a farre off.</p>
<p>A Soft Body dampeth the Sound, much more than a Hard; As if a Bell
hath Cloth, or Silke wrapped about it, it deadeth the Sound more, than
if it were Wood. And therefore in Clericalls, the Keyes are lined; And
in Colledges they vse to line the Tablemen.</p>
<p>Triall was made in a Recorder, after these seuerall manners. The
Bottome of it was set against the Palme of the Hand; stopped with Wax
round about; set against a Damaske Cushion; Thrust into Sand; Into
Ashes; Into Water, (halfe an Inch vnder the Water;) Close to the Bottome
of a Siluer Basin; And still the Tone remained: But the Bottome of it
was set against a Woollen Carpet; A Lining of Plush; A Locke of Wooll,
(though loosely put in;) Against Snow; And the Sound of it was quite
deaded, and but Breath.</p>
<p>Iron Hot produceth not so full a Sound, as when it is Cold; For while
it is hot, it appeareth to be more Soft, and lesse Resounding. So
likewise Warme Water, when it falleth, maketh not so full a Sound, as
Cold: And I conceiue it is softer, and neerer the Nature of Oyle; For it
is more slippery; As may be perceiued, in that it scowreth better.</p>
<p>Let there be a Recorder made, with two Fipples at each end one; The
Truncke of it of the length of two Recorders, and the Holes answerable
toward each end; And let two play the same Lesson vpon it, at an Vnison;
And let it be noted, whether the Sound be confounded; or amplified; or
dulled. So likewise let a Crosse be made, of two Trunckes (thorow-out)
hollow; And let two speake, or sing, the one long-waies, the other
trauerse: And let two heare at the opposite Ends; And note, whether the
Sound be confounded; amplified; or dulled. Which two Instances will also
giue light to the Mixture of Sounds; wherof we shall speake
hereafter.</p>
<p>A Bellowes blowne in at the Hole of a Drum, and the Drum then
strucken, maketh the Sound a little flatter, but no other apparent
Alteration. The Cause is manifest; Partly for that it hindreth the Issue
of the Sound; And partly for that it maketh the Aire, being blowne
together, lesse moueable.</p>
<p>The Loudnesse, and Softnesse of Sounds, is a Thing distinct from the
Magnitude and Exility of Sounds; For a Base String, though softly
strucken, giueth the greater Sound; But a Treble String, if hard
strucken, will be heard much further off. And the Cause is, for that the
Base String striketh more Aire; And the Treble lesse Aire, but with a
sharper Percussion.</p>
<p>It is therefore the Strength of the Percussion, that is a Principall
Cause of the Loudnesse or Softnesse of Sounds: As in knocking harder or
softer; Winding of a Horne stronger or weaker; Ringing of a Hand-bell
harder or softer, andandandandc. And the Strength of this Percussion,
consisteth, as much, or more, in the Hardnesse of the Body Percussed, as
in the Force of the Body Percussing: For if you strike against a Cloth,
it will giue a lesse Sound; If against Wood, a greater; If against
Metall, yet a greater; And in Metals, if you strike against Gold, (which
is the more pliant,) it giueth the flatter Sound; If against Siluer, or
Brasse, the more Ringing Sound. As for Aire, where it is strongly pent,
it matcheth a Hard Body. And therefore we see in discharging of a Peece,
what a great Noise it maketh. We see also, that the Charge with Bullet;
Or with Paper wet, and hard stopped; Or with Powder alone, rammed in
hard; maketh no great difference in the Loudnesse of the Report.</p>
<p>The Sharpnesse or Quicknesse of the Percussion, is a great Cause of
the Loudnesse, as well as the Strength: As in a Whip, or Wand, if you
strike the Aire with it; the Sharper and Quicker you strike it, the
Louder Sound it giueth. And in playing vpon the Lute, or Virginalls, the
quicke Stroke or Touch, is a great life to the Sound. The Cause is, for
that the Quicke Striking cutteth the Aire speedily; wheras the Soft
Striking doth rather beat, than cut.</p>
<p>The Communication of Sounds (as in Bellies of Lutes, Empty Vessells,
andandandandc.) hath beene touched obiter, in the Maioration of Sounds:
But it is fit also to make a Title of it apart.</p>
<p>The Experiment for greatest Demonstration of Communication of Sounds,
is the Chiming of Bells; where if you strike with a Hammer vpon the
Vpper Part, and then vpon the Midst, and then vpon the Lower, you shall
finde the Sound to be more Treble, and more Base, according vnto the
Concaue, on the Inside; though the Percussion be onely on the
Outside.</p>
<p>When the Sound is created betweene the Blast of the Mouth, and the
Aire of the Pipe, it hath neuerthelesse some Communication with the
Matter of the Sides of the Pipe, and the Spirits in them contained; for
in a Pipe, or Trumpet, of Wood, and Brasse, the Sound will be diuers; So
if the Pipe be couered with Cloth, or Silke, it will giue a diuers
Sound, from that it would doe of it selfe; So, if the Pipe be a little
wet on the Inside, it will make a differing Sound, from the same Pipe
dry.</p>
<p>That Sound made within Water, doth communicate better with a hard
Body thorow Water, than made in Aire, it doth with Aire; Vide
Experimentum, 134.</p>
<p>We haue spoken before (in the Inquisition touching Musicke,) of
Musicall Sounds, wherunto there may be a Concord or Discord in two
Parts; Which Sounds vve call Tones: And likewise of Immusicall Sounds;
And haue giuen the Cause, that the Tone proceedeth of Equality, and the
other of Inequality. And we haue also expressed there, what are the
Equall Bodies that giue Tones, and what are the Vnequall that giue none.
But now we shall speake of such Inequality of Sounds, as proceedeth, not
from the Nature of the Bodies themselues, but is Accidentall; Either
from the Roughnesse, or Obliquity of the Passage; Or from the Doubling
of the Percutient; Or from the Trepidation of the Motion.</p>
<p>A Bell, if it haue a Rift in it, whereby the Sound hath not a cleare
Passage, giueth a Hoarse and Iarring Sound; So the Voice of Man, when by
Cold taken the Wesill groweth rugged, and (as we call it) furred,
becommeth hoarse. And in these two Instances, the Sounds are Ingrate;
because they are meerely Vnequall: But, if they be Vnequall in Equality,
then the Sound is Gratefull, but Purling.</p>
<p>All Instruments, that haue either Returnes, as Trumpets; Or Flexions,
as Cornets; Or are Drawne vp, and put from, as Sackbuts; haue a Purling
Sound; But the Recorder, or Flute, that haue none of these Inequalities,
giue a cleare Sound. Neuerthelesse, the Recorder it selfe, or Pipe
moistened a little in the Inside, soundeth more solemnly, and with a
little Purling, or Hissing. Againe, a Wreathed String, such as are in
the Base Strings of Banderaes, giueth also a Purling Sound.</p>
<p>But a Lute-string, if it be meerely Vnequall in his Parts, giueth a
Harsh and Vntuneable Sound; which Strings we call False, being bigger in
one Place than in another; And therefore Wire-strings are neuer False.
We see also, that when we try a False Lute-string, wee vse to extend it
hard betweene the fingers, and to fillip it; And if it giueth a double
Species, it is True; But if it giueth a treble, or more, it is
False.</p>
<p>Waters, in the Noise they make as they runne, represent to the Eare a
Trembling Noise; And in Regalls, (where they haue a Pipe, they call the
Nightingale-Pipe, which containeth Water) the Sound hath a continuall
Trembling: And Children haue also little Things they call Cockes, which
haue Water in them; And when they blow, or whistle in them, they yeeld a
Trembling Noise; Which Trembling of Water, hath an assinity with the
Letter L. All which Inequalities of Trepidation, are rather pleasant,
than otherwise.</p>
<p>All Base Notes, or very Treble Notes, giue an Asper Sound; For that
the Base striketh more Aire, than it can well strike equally: And the
Treble cutteth the Aire so sharpe, as it returneth too swift, to make
the Sound Equall: And therefore a Meane, or Tenor, is the sweetest
Part.</p>
<p>We know Nothing, that can at pleasure make a Musicall, or Immusicall
Sound, by voluntary Motion, but the Voice of Man, and Birds. The Cause
is, (no doubt) in the Weasill or Wind-pipe, (which we call Aspera
Arteria,) which being well extended, gathereth Equality; As a Bladder
that is wrinckled, if it be extended, becommeth smooth. The Extension is
alwaies more in Tones, than in Speech: Therefore the Inward Voice of
Whisper can neuer a giue Tone: And in Singing, there is (manifestly) a
greater Working and Labour of the Throat, than in Speaking; As appeareth
in the Thrusting out, or Drawing in of the Chinne, when we sing.</p>
<p>The Humming of Bees, is an Vnequall Buzzing; And is conceiued, by
some of the Ancients, not to come forth at their Mouth, but to be an
Inward Sound, But (it may be) it is neither; But from the motion of
their Wings; For it is not heard but when they stirre.</p>
<p>All Metalls quenched in Water, giue a Sibilation or Hissing Sound;
(which hath an Affinity with the letter Z.) notwithstanding the Sound be
created betweene the Water or Vapour, and the Aire. Seething also, if
there be but small Store of Water, in a Vessell, giueth a Hissing Sound;
But Boyling in a full Vessell, giueth a Bubling Sound, drawing somewhat
neare to the Cocks vsed by Children.</p>
<p>Triall would be made, whether the Inequality, or Interchange of the
Medium, will not produce an Inequality of Sound; As if three Bells were
made one within another, and Aire betwixt Each; And then the outermost
Bell were chimed with a Hammer, how the Sound would differ from a Simple
Bell. So likewise take a Plate of Brasse, and a Plancke of Wood, and
ioyne them close together, and knock vpon one of them, and see if they
doe not giue an vnequall Sound. So make two or three Partitions or Wood
in a Hogshead, with Holes or Knots in them; And marke the difference of
their Sound, from the Sound of an Hogshead, without such Partitions.</p>
<p>It is euident, that the Percussion of the Greater Quantity of Aire,
causeth the Baser Sound; And the lesse Quantity, the more Treble Sound.
The Percussion of the Greater Quantity of Aire, is produced by the
Greatnesse of the Body Percussing; By the Latitude of the Concaue, by
which the Sound passeth; and by the Longitude of the same Concaue.
Therfore we see that a Base string, is greater than a Treble; A Base
Pipe hath a greater Bore than a Treble; And in Pipes, and the like, the
lower the Note Holes be, and the further off from the Mouth of the Pipe,
the more Base Sound they yeeld; And the nearer the Mouth, the more
Treble. Nay more, if you strike an Entire Body, as an Andiron of Brasse,
at the Top, it maketh a more Treble Sound; And at the Bottome a
Baser.</p>
<p>It is also euident, that the Sharper or Quicker Percussion of Aire
causeth the more Treble Sound; And the Slower or Heauier, the more Base
Sound. So we see in Strings; the more they are wound vp, and strained;
(And thereby giue a more quicke Start-backe;) the more Treble is the
Sound; And the slacker they are, or lesse wound vp, the Baser is the
Sound. And therfore a Bigger String more strained, and a Lesser String,
lesse strained, may fall into the same Tone.</p>
<p>Children, Women, Eunuchs haue more small and shrill Voices, than Men.
The Reason is, not for that Men haue greater Heat, which may make the
Voice stronger, (for the strength of a Voice or Sound, doth make a
difference in the Loudnesse or Softnesse, but not in the Tone;) But from
the Dilatation of the Organ; which (it is true) is likewise caused by
Heat. But the Cause of Changing the Voice, at the yeares of Puberty, is
more obscure. It seemeth to be, for that when much of the Moisture of
the Body, which did before irrigate the Parts, is drawne downe to the
Spermaticall vessells; it leaueth the Body more hot than it was; whence
commeth the Dilatation of the Pipes: For we see plainly, all Effects of
Heat, doe then come on; As Pilosity, more Roughnesse of the Skinne,
Hardnesse of the Flesh, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Industry of the Musitian, hath produced two other Meanes of
Strayning, or Intension of Strings, besides their Winding vp. The one is
the Stopping of the String with the Finger; As in the Necks of Lutes,
Viols, andandandandc. The other is the Shortnesse of the String; As in
Harps, Virginalls, andandandandc. Both these haue one, and the same
reason; For they cause the String to giue a quicker Start.</p>
<p>In the Straining of a String, the further it is strained, the lesse
Superstraining goeth to a Note; For it requireth good Winding of a
String, before it will make any Note at all: And in the Stops of Lutes,
andandandandc. the higher they goe, the lesse Distance is betweene the
Frets.</p>
<p>If you fill a Drinking-Glasse with Water, (especially one Sharp
below, and Wide aboue,) and fillip vpon the Brim, or Outside; And after
empty Part of the Water, and so more and more, and still try the Tone by
Fillipping; you shall finde the Tone fall, and be more Base, as the
Glasse is more Empty.</p>
<p>The Iust and Measured Proportion of the Aire Percussed, towards the
Basenesse or Treblenesse of Tones, is one of the greatest Secrets in the
Contemplation of Sounds. For it discouereth the true Coincidence of
Tones into Diapasons; Which is the Returne of the same Sound. And so of
the Concords and Discords, betweene the Vnison, and Diapason; Which we
haue touched before, in the Experiments of Musicke; but thinke fit to
resume it here, as a principall Part of our Enquiry touching the Nature
of Sounds. It may be found out in the Proportion of the Winding of
Strings; In the Proportion of the Distance of Frets; And in the
Proportion of the Concaue of Pipes, andandandandc. But most commodiously
in the last of these.</p>
<p>Try therfore the Winding of a String once about, as soone as it is
brought to that Extension, as will giue a Tone; And then of twice about;
And thrice about, andandandandc. And marke the Scale or Difference of
the Rise of the Tone: Wherby you shall discouer, in one, two Effects;
Both the Proportion of the Sound towards the Dimension of the Winding;
And the Proportion likewife of the Sound towards the String, as it is
more or lesse strained. But note that to measure this, the way will be,
to take the Length in a right Line of the String, vpon any Winding about
of the Pegge.</p>
<p>As for the Steps, you are to take the Number of Frets; And
principally the Length of the Line, from the first Stop of the String,
vnto such a Stop as shall produce a Diapason to the former Stop, vpon
the same String.</p>
<p>But it will best (as it is said) appeare, in the Bores of
Wind-Instruments: And therfore cause some halfe dozen Pipes, to be made,
in length, and all things else, alike, with a single, double, and so on
to a sextuple Bore; And so marke what Fall of Tone euery one giueth. But
still in these three last Instances, you must diligently obserue, what
length of String, or Distance of Stop, or Concaue of Aire, maketh what
Rise of Sound. As in the last of these (which (as we said) is that,
which giueth the aptest demonstration,) you must set downe what Encrease
of Concaue goeth to the Making of a Note higher; And what of two Notes;
And what of three Notes; And so vp to the Diapason: For then the great
Secret of Numbers, and Proportions, will appeare. It is not vnlike, that
those that make Recorders, andandandandc. know this already: for that
they make them in Sets. And likewise Bell-founders in fitting the tune
of their Bells. So that Enquiry may saue Triall. Surely, it hath beene
obserued by one of the Ancients, that an Empty Barrell knocked vpon with
the finger, giueth a Diapason to the Sound of the like Barrellfull; But
how that should be, I doe not well vnderstand; For that the knocking of
a Barrellfull, or Empty, doth scarce giue any Tone.</p>
<p>There is required some sensible Difference in the Proportion of
creating a Note, towards the Sound it selfe, which is the Passiue: And
that it be not too neare, but at a distance. For in a Recorder, the
three vppermost Holes, yeeld one Tone; which is a Note lower than the
Tone of the first three. And the like (no doubt) is required in the
Winding or Stopping of Strings.</p>
<p>There is another Difference of Sounds, which we will call Exteriour,
and Interiour. It is not Soft, nor Loud: Nor it is not Base, nor Treble:
Nor it is not Musicall, nor Immusicall: Though it be true, that there
can be no Tone in an Interiour Sound: But on the other side, in an
Exteriour Sound, there may be both Musicall and Immusicall. We shall
therfore enumerate them, rather than precisely distinguish them; Though
(to make some Adumbration of that we meane) the Interiour is rather an
Impulsion or Contusion of the Aire, than an Elision or Section of the
same. So as the Percussion of the one, towards the other, differeth, as
a Blow differeth from a Cut.</p>
<p>In Speech of Man, the Whispering, (which they call Susurrus in
Latine,) whether it be louder or softer, is an Interiour Sound; But the
Speaking out, is an Exteriour Sound; And therfore you can neuer make a
Tone, not sing in Whispering; But in Speech you may: So Breathing, or
Blowing by the Mouth, Bellowes, or Wind, (though loud) is an Interiour
Sound; But the Blowing thorow a Pipe, or Concaue, (though soft) is an
Exteriour. So likewise, the greatest Winds, if they haue no Coarctation,
or blow not hollow, giue an Interiour Sound; The Whistling or hollow
Wind yeeldeth a Singing, or Exteriour Sound; The former being pent by
some other Body; The latter being pent in by his owne Density: And
therfore we see, that when the Wind bloweth hollow, it is a Signe of
Raine. The Flame, as it moueth within it selfe, or is blowne by a
Bellowes, giueth a Murmur or Interiour Sound.</p>
<p>There is no Hard Body, but strucke against another Hard Body, will
yeeld an Exteriour Sound, greater or lesser: In so much as if the
Percussion be ouer-soft, it may induce a Nullity of Sound; But neuer an
Interiour Sound; As when one treadeth so softly, that he is not
heard.</p>
<p>Where the Aire is the Percutient, pent, or not pent, against a Hard
Body, it neuer giueth an Exteriour Sound; As if you blow strongly with a
Bellowes against a Wall.</p>
<p>Sounds (both Exteriour and Interiour,) may be made, as well by
Suction, as by Emission of the Breath: As in Whistling, or
Breathing.</p>
<p>It is euident, and it is one of the strangest Secrets in Sounds, that
the whole Sound is not in the whole Aire onely; But the whole Sound is
also in euery small Part of the Aire. So that all the curious Diuersity
of ArticulateSounds, of the Voice of Man, or Birds, will enter at a
small Cranny, Inconfused.</p>
<p>The Vnequall Agitation of the Winds, and the like, though they bee
materiall to the Carriage of the Sounds, further, or lesse way; yet they
doe not confound the Articulation of them at all, within that distance
that they can be heard; Though it may be, they make them to be heard
lesse Way, than in a Still; as hath beene partly touched.</p>
<p>Ouer-great Distance confoundeth the Articulation of Sounds; As we
see, that you may heare the Sound of a Preachers voice, or the like,
when you cannot distinguish what he saith. And one Articulate Sound will
confound another; As when many speake at once.</p>
<p>In the Experiment of Speaking vnder Water, when the Voice is reduced
to such an Extreme Exility, yet the Articulate Sounds, (which are the
Words,) are not confounded; as hath beene said.</p>
<p>I conceiue, that an Extreme Small, or an Extreme Great Sound, cannot
be Articulate; But that Articulation requireth a Mediocrity of Sound:
For that the Extreme Small Sound confoundeth the Articulation by
Contracting; And the Great Sound, by Dispersing: And although (as was
formerly said) a Sound Articulate, already created, will be contracted
into a small Cranny; yet the first Articulation requireth more
Dimension.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, that in a Roome, or in a Chappell, Vaulted
below, and Vaulted likewise in the Roofe, a Preacher cannot be heard so
well, as in the like Places not so Vaulted. The Cause is, for that the
Subsequent Words come on, before the Precedent words vanish: And
therfore the Articulate Sounds are more confused, though the Grosse of
the Sound be greater.</p>
<p>The Motions of the Tongue, Lips, Throat, Pallat, andandandandc. which
goe to the Making of the seuerall Alphabeticall Letters, are worthy
Enquiry, and pertinent to the present Inquisition of Sounds: But because
they are subtill, and long to describe, we will refer them ouer, and
place them amongst the Experiments of Speech. The Hebrewes haue beene
diligent in it, and haue assigned, which Letters are Labiall, which
Dentall, which Gutturall, andandandandc. As for the Latines, and
Grecians, they haue distinguished betweene Semi-vowels, and Mutes; And
in Mutes, betweene Mute Tenues, Media, and Aspirata; Not amisse; But yet
not diligently enough. For the speciall Strokes, andandandand Motions,
that create those Sounds, they haue little enquired: As that the
Letters, B. P. F. M. are not expressed, but with the Contracting, or
Shutting of the Mouth; That the Letters N. and B. cannot be pronounced,
but that the Letter N. will turne into M. As Hecatonba, will be
Hecatomba. That M. and T. cannot be pronounced together, but P. will
come betweene; as Emtus, is pronounced Emptus; And a Number of the like.
So that if you enquire to the full; you will finde, that to the Making
of the whole Alphabet, there will be fewer Simple Motions required, than
there are Letters.</p>
<p>The Lungs are the most Spongy Part of the Body; And therefore ablest
to contract, and dilate it selfe: And where it contracteth it selfe, it
expelleth the Aire; which thorow the Artire, Throat, and Mouth, maketh
the Voice: But yet Articulation is not made, but with the helpe of the
Tongue, Pallate, and the rest of those they call Instruments of
voice.</p>
<p>There is sound a Similitude, betweene the Sound that is made by
Inanimate Bodies, or by Animate Bodies, that haue no Voice Articulate;
and diuers Letters of Articulate Voices: And commonly Men haue giuen
such Names to those Sounds, as doe allude vnto the Articulate Letters.
As Trembling of Water hath Resemblance with the Letter L; Quenching of
Hot Mettalls, with the Letter Z; Snarling of Dogs, with the Letter R;
The Noise of Scritchowles, with the Letter Sh; Voice of Cats, with the
Dypthong Eu; Voice of Cuckoes, with the Dypthong On; Sounds of Strings,
with the Letter Ng: So that if a Man, (for Curiosity, or Strangenesse
sake,) would make a Puppet, or other Dead Body, to pronounce a Word; Let
him consider, on the one Part, the Motion of the Instruments of Voice;
and on the other part the like Sounds made in Inanimate Bodies; And what
Conformity there is that causeth the Similitude of Sounds; And by that
he may minister light to that Effect.</p>
