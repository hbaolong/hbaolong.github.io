<li>And as for the disgraces which learning receiveth from politics,
they be of this nature: that learning doth soften men’s minds, and makes
them more unapt for the honour and exercise of arms; that it doth mar
and pervert men’s dispositions for matter of government and policy, in
making them too curious and irresolute by variety of reading, or too
peremptory or positive by strictness of rules and axioms, or too
immoderate and overweening by reason of the greatness of examples, or
too incompatible and differing from the times by reason of the
dissimilitude of examples; or at least, that it doth divert men’s
travails from action and business, and bringeth them to a love of
leisure and privateness; and that it doth bring into states a relaxation
of discipline, whilst every man is more ready to argue than to obey and
execute. Out of this conceit Cato, surnamed the Censor, one of the
wisest men indeed that ever lived, when Carneades the philosopher came
in embassage to Rome, and that the young men of Rome began to flock
about him, being allured with the sweetness and majesty of his eloquence
and learning, gave counsel in open senate that they should give him his
despatch with all speed, lest he should infect and enchant the minds and
affections of the youth, and at unawares bring in an alteration of the
manners and customs of the state. Out of the same conceit or humour did
Virgil, turning his pen to the advantage of his country and the
disadvantage of his own profession, make a kind of separation between
policy and government, and between arts and sciences, in the verses so
much renowned, attributing and challenging the one to the Romans, and
leaving and yielding the other to the Grecians:</li>
</ol>
<p>Tu regere imperio popules, Romane, memento,</p>
<p>Hae tibi erunt artes, andandandandc.</p>
<p>So likewise we see that Anytus, the accuser of Socrates, laid it as
an article of charge and accusation against him, that he did, with the
variety and power of his discourses and disputatious, withdraw young men
from due reverence to the laws and customs of their country, and that he
did profess a dangerous and pernicious science, which was to make the
worse matter seem the better, and to suppress truth by force of
eloquence and speech.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>But these and the like imputations have rather a countenance of
gravity than any ground of justice: for experience doth warrant that,
both in persons and in times, there hath been a meeting and concurrence
in learning and arms, flourishing and excelling in the same men and the
same ages. For as ’for men, there cannot be a better nor the hike
instance as of that pair, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, the
Dictator; whereof the one was Aristotle’s scholar in philosophy, and the
other was Cicero’s rival in eloquence; or if any man had rather call for
scholars that were great generals, than generals that were great
scholars, let him take Epaminondas the Theban, or Xenophon the Athenian;
whereof the one was the first that abated the power of Sparta, and the
other was the first that made way to the overthrow of the monarchy of
Persia. And this concurrence is yet more visible in times than in
persons, by how much an age is greater object than a man. For both in
Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Graecia, and Rome, the same times that are most
renowned for arms are, likewise, most admired for learning, so that the
greatest authors and philosophers, and the greatest captains and
governors, have lived in the same ages. Neither can it otherwise he: for
as in man the ripeness of strength of the body and mind cometh much
about an age, save that the strength of the body cometh somewhat the
more early, so in states, arms and learning, whereof the one
correspondeth to the body, the other to the soul of man, have a
concurrence or near sequence in times.</p></li>
<li><p>And for matter of policy and government, that learning, should
rather hurt, than enable thereunto, is a thing very improbable; we see
it is accounted an error to commit a natural body to empiric physicians,
which commonly have a few pleasing receipts whereupon they are confident
and adventurous, but know neither the causes of diseases, nor the
complexions of patients, nor peril of accidents, nor the true method of
cures; we see it is a like error to rely upon advocates or lawyers which
are only men of practice, and not grounded in their books, who are many
times easily surprised when matter falleth out besides their experience,
to the prejudice of the causes they handle: so by like reason it cannot
be but a matter of doubtful consequence if states be managed by empiric
statesmen, not well mingled with men grounded in learning. But
contrariwise, it is almost without instance contradictory that ever any
government was disastrous that was in the hands of learned governors.
For howsoever it hath been ordinary with politic men to extenuate and
disable learned men by the names of pedantes; yet in the records of time
it appeareth in many particulars that the governments of princes in
minority (notwithstanding the infinite disadvantage of that kind of
state)— have nevertheless excelled the government of princes of mature
age, even for that reason which they seek to traduce, which is that by
that occasion the state hath been in the hands of pedantes: for so was
the state of Rome for the first five years, which are so much magnified,
during the minority of Nero, in the hands of Seneca, a pedenti; so it
was again, for ten years’ space or more, during the minority of
Gordianus the younger, with great applause and contentation in the hands
of Misitheus, a pedanti: so was it before that, in the minority of
Alexander Severus, in like happiness, in hands not much unlike, by
reason of the rule of the women, who were aided by the teachers and
preceptors. Nay, let a man look into the government of the Bishops of
Rome, as by name, into the government of Pius Quintus and Sextus Quintus
in our times, who were both at their entrance esteemed but as pedantical
friars, and he shall find that such Popes do greater things, and proceed
upon truer principles of state, than those which have ascended to the
papacy from an education and breeding in affairs of state and courts of
princes; for although men bred in learning are perhaps to seek in points
of convenience and accommodating for the present, which the Italians
call ragioni di stato, whereof the same Pius Quintus could not hear
spoken with patience, terming them inventions against religion and the
moral virtues; yet on the other side, to recompense that, they are
perfect in those same plain grounds of religion, justice, honour, and
moral virtue, which if they be well and watchfully pursued, there will
be seldom use of those other, no more than of physic in a sound or
well-dieted body. Neither can the experience of one man’s life furnish
examples and precedents for the event of one man’s life. For as it
happeneth sometimes that the grandchild, or other descendant, resembleth
the ancestor more than the son; so many times occurrences of present
times may sort better with ancient examples than with those of the later
or immediate times; and lastly, the wit of one man can no more
countervail learning than one man’s means can hold way with a common
purse.</p></li>
<li><p>And as for those particular seducements or indispositions of the
mind for policy and government, which learning is pretended to
insinuate; if it be granted that any such thing be, it must be
remembered withal that learning ministereth in every of them greater
strength of medicine or remedy than it offereth cause of indisposition
or infirmity. For if by a secret operation it make men perplexed and
irresolute, on the other side by plain precept it teacheth them when and
upon what ground to resolve; yea, and how to carry things in suspense,
without prejudice, till they resolve. If it make men positive and
regular, it teacheth them what things are in their nature demonstrative,
and what are conjectural, and as well the use of distinctions and
exceptions, as the latitude of principles and rules. If it mislead by
disproportion or dissimilitude of examples, it teacheth men the force of
circumstances, the errors of comparisons, and all the cautions of
application; so that in all these it doth rectify more effectually than
it can pervert. And these medicines it conveyeth into men’s minds much
more forcibly by the quickness and penetration of examples. For let a
man look into the errors of Clement VII., so lively described by
Guicciardini, who served under him, or into the errors of Cicero,
painted out by his own pencil in his Epistles to Atticus, and he will
fly apace from being irresolute. Let him look into the errors of
Phocion, and he will beware how he be obstinate or inflexible. Let him
but read the fable of Ixion, and it will hold him from being vaporous or
imaginative. Let him look into the errors of Cato II., and he will never
be one of the Antipodes, to tread opposite to the present
world.</p></li>
<li><p>And for the conceit that learning should dispose men to leisure
and privateness, and make men slothful: it were a strange thing if that
which accustometh the mind to a perpetual motion and agitation should
induce slothfulness, whereas, contrariwise, it may be truly affirmed
that no kind of men love business for itself but those that are learned;
for other persons love it for profit, as a hireling that loves the work
for the wages; or for honour, as because it beareth them up in the eyes
of men, and refresheth their reputation, which otherwise would wear; or
because it putteth them in mind of their fortune, and giveth them
occasion to pleasure and displeasure; or because it exerciseth some
faculty wherein they take pride, and so entertaineth them in good-humour
and pleasing conceits towards themselves; or because it advanceth any
other their ends. So that as it is said of untrue valours, that some
men’s valours are in the eyes of them that look on, so such men’s
industries are in the eyes of others, or, at least, in regard of their
own designments; only learned men love business as an action according
to nature, as agreeable to health of mind as exercise is to health of
body, taking pleasure in the action itself, and not in the purchase, so
that of all men they are the most indefatigable, if it be towards any
business which can hold or detain their mind.</p></li>
<li><p>And if any man be laborious in reading and study, and yet idle in
business and action, it groweth from some weakness of body or softness
of spirit, such as Seneca speaketh of: Quidam tam sunt umbratiles, ut
putent in turbido esse quicquid in luce est; and not of learning: well
may it be that such a point of a man’s nature may make him give himself
to learning, but it is not learning that breedeth any such point in his
nature.</p></li>
<li><p>And that learning should take up too much time or leisure: I
answer, the most active or busy man that hath been or can be, hath (no
question) many vacant times of leisure while he expecteth the tides and
returns of business (except he be either tedious and of no despatch, or
lightly and unworthily ambitious to meddle in things that may be better
done by others), and then the question is but how those spaces and times
of leisure shall be filled and spent; whether in pleasure or in studies;
as was well answered by Demosthenes to his adversary AEschines, that was
a man given to pleasure, and told him “That his orations did smell of
the lamp.” “Indeed,” said Demosthenes, “there is a great difference
between the things that you and I do by lamp-light.” So as no man need
doubt that learning will expel business, but rather it will keep and
defend the possession of the mind against idleness and pleasure, which
otherwise at unawares may enter to the prejudice of both.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, for that other conceit that learning should undermine the
reverence of laws and government, it is assuredly a mere depravation and
calumny, without all shadow of truth. For to say that a blind custom of
obedience should be a surer obligation than duty taught and understood,
it is to affirm that a blind man may tread surer by a guide than a
seeing man can by a light. And it is without all controversy that
learning doth make the minds of men gentle, generous, manageable, and
pliant to government; whereas ignorance makes them churlish, thwart, and
mutinous: and the evidence of time doth clear this assertion,
considering that the most barbarous, rude, and unlearned times have been
most subject to tumults, seditious, and changes.</p></li>
<li><p>And as to the judgment of Cato the Censor, he was well punished
for his blasphemy against learning, in the same kind wherein he
offended; for when he was past threescore years old, he was taken with
an extreme desire to go to school again, and to learn the Greek tongue,
to the end to peruse the Greek authors; which doth well demonstrate that
his former censure of the Grecian learning was rather an affected
gravity, than according to the inward sense of his own opinion. And as
for Virgil’s verses, though it pleased him to brave the world in taking
to the Romans the art of empire, and leaving to others the arts of
subjects, yet so much is manifest — that the Romans never ascended to
that height of empire till the time they had ascended to the height of
other arts. For in the time of the two first Caesars, which had the art
of government in greatest perfection, there lived the best poet,
Virgilius Maro; the best historiographer, Titus Livius; the best
antiquary, Marcus Varro; and the best or second orator, Marcus Cicero,
that to the memory of man are known. As for the accusation of Socrates,
the time must be remembered when it was prosecuted; which was under the
Thirty Tyrants, the most base, bloody, and envious persons that have
governed; which revolution of state was no sooner over but Socrates,
whom they had made a person criminal, was made a person heroical, and
his memory accumulate with honours divine and human; and those
discourses of his which were then termed corrupting of manners, were
after acknowledged for sovereign medicines of the mind and manners, and
so have been received ever since till this day. Let this, therefore,
serve for answer to politiques, which in their humorous severity, or in
their feigned gravity, have presumed to throw imputations upon learning;
which redargution nevertheless (save that we know not whether our
labours may extend to other ages) were not needful for the present, in
regard of the love and reverence towards learning which the example and
countenance of two so learned princes, Queen Elizabeth and your Majesty,
being as Castor and Pollux, lucida sidera, stars of excellent light and
most benign influence, hath wrought in all men of place and authority in
our nation.</p></li>
