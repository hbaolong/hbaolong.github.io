8 — Of the Impediments of Knowledge in Handling it by Parts, and in
Slipping off Particular Sciences from the Root and Stock Of Universal
Knowledge, Being the 8th Chapter, the Whole Chapter</h4>
<p>Cicero, the orator, willing to magnify his own profession, and
thereupon spending many words to maintain that eloquence was not a shop
of good words and elegancies but a treasury and receipt of all
knowledges, so far forth as may appertain to the handling and moving of
the minds and affections of men by speech, maketh great complaint of the
school of Socrates; that whereas before his time the same professors of
wisdom in Greece did pretend to teach an universal SAPIENCE and
knowledge both of matter and words, Socrates divorced them and withdrew
philosophy and left rhetoric to itself, which by that destitution became
but a barren and unnoble science. And in particular sciences we see that
if men fall to subdivide their labours, as to be an oculist in physic,
or to be perfect in some one title of the law, or the like, they may
prove ready and subtile, but not deep or sufficient, no not in that
subject which they do particularly attend, because of that consent which
it hath with the rest. And it is a matter of common discourse of the
chain of sciences how they are linked together, insomuch as the
Grecians, who had terms at will, have fitted it of a name of CIRCLE
LEARNING. Nevertheless I that hold it for a great impediment towards the
advancement and further invention of knowledge, that particular arts and
sciences have been disincorporated from general knowledge, do not
understand one and the same thing which Cicero’s discourse and the note
and conceit of the Grecians in their word CIRCLE LEARNING do intend. For
I mean not that use which one science hath of another for ornament or
help in practice, as the orator hath of knowledge of affections for
moving, or as military science may have use of geometry for
fortifications; but I mean it directly of that use by way of supply of
light and information which the particulars and instances of one science
do yield and present for the framing or correcting of the axioms of
another science in their very truth and notion. And therefore that
example of OCULISTS and TITLE LAWYERS doth come nearer my conceit than
the other two; for sciences distinguished have a dependence upon
universal knowledge to be augmented and rectified by the superior light
thereof, as well as the parts and members of a science have upon the
MAXIMS of the same science, and the mutual light and consent which one
part receiveth of another. And therefore the opinion of Copernicus in
astronomy, which astronomy itself cannot correct because it is not
repugnant to any of the appearances, yet natural philosophy doth
correct. On the other side if some of the ancient philosophers had been
perfect in the observations of astronomy, and had called them to counsel
when they made their principles and first axioms, they would never have
divided their philosophy as the Cosmographers do their descriptions by
globes, making one philosophy for heaven and another for under heaven,
as in effect they do.</p>
<p>So if the moral philosophers that have spent such an infinite
quantity of debate touching Good and the highest good, had cast their
eye abroad upon nature and beheld the appetite that is in all things to
receive and to give; the one motion affecting preservation and the other
multiplication; which appetites are most evidently seen in living
creatures in the pleasure of nourishment and generation; and in man do
make the aptest and most natural division of all his desires, being
either of sense of pleasure or sense of power; and in the universal
frame of the world are figured, the one in the beams of heaven which
issue forth, and the other in the lap of the earth which takes in: and
again if they had observed the motion of congruity or situation of the
parts in respect of the whole, evident in so many particulars; and
lastly if they had considered the motion (familiar in attraction of
things) to approach to that which is higher in the same kind; when by
these observations so easy and concurring in natural philosophy, they
should have found out this quaternion of good, in enjoying or fruition,
effecting or operation, consenting or proportion, and approach or
assumption; they would have saved and abridged much of their long and
wandering discourses of pleasure, virtue, duty, and religion. So
likewise in this same logic and rhetoric, or arts of argument and grace
of speech, if the great masters of them would but have gone a form
lower, and looked but into the observations of Grammar concerning the
kinds of words, their derivations, deflexions, and syntax; specially
enriching the same with the helps of several languages, with their
differing proprieties of words, phrases, and tropes; they might have
found out more and better footsteps of common reason, help of
disputation, and advantages of cavillation, than many of these which
they have propounded. So again a man should be thought to dally, if he
did note how the figures of rhetoric and music are many of them the
same. The repetitions and traductions in speech and the reports and
hauntings of sounds in music are the very same things. Plutarch hath
almost made a book of the Lacedaemonian kind of jesting, which joined
ever pleasure with distaste. SIR, (saith a man of art to Philip king of
Macedon when he controlled him in his faculty,) GOD FORBID YOUR FORTUNE
SHOULD BE SUCH AS TO KNOW THESE THINGS BETTER THAN I. In taxing his
ignorance in his art he represented to him the perpetual greatness of
his fortune, leaving him no vacant time for so mean a skill. Now in
music it is one of the ordinariest flowers to fall from a discord or
hard tune upon a sweet accord. The figure that Cicero and the rest
commend as one of the best points of elegancy, which is the fine
checking of expectation, is no less well known to the musicians when
they have a special grace in flying the close or cadence. And these are
no allusions but direct communities, the same delights of the mind being
to be found not only in music, rhetoric, but in moral philosophy,
policy, and other knowledges, and that obscure in the one, which is more
apparent in the other, yea and that discovered in the one which is not
found at all in the other, and so one science greatly aiding to the
invention and augmentation of another. And therefore without this
intercourse the axioms of sciences will fall out to be neither full nor
true; but will be such opinions as Aristotle in some places doth wisely
censure, when he saith THESE ARE THE OPINIONS OF PERSONS THAT HAVE
RESPECT BUT TO A FEW THINGS. So then we see that this note leadeth us to
an administration of knowledge in some such order and policy as the king
of Spain in regard of his great dominions useth in state; who though he
hath particular councils for several countries and affairs, yet hath one
council of State or last resort, that receiveth the advertisements and
certificates from all the rest. Hitherto of the diversion, succession,
and conference of wits.</p>
