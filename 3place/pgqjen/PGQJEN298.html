<h4 id="section">31</h4>
<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the tenth place Instances
of Power, or of the Fasces (to borrow a term from the badges of empire);
which I also call Instances of the Wit, or Hands of Man. These are the
noblest and most consummate works in each art, exhibiting the ultimate
perfection of it. For since our main object is to make nature serve the
business and conveniences of man, it is altogether agreeable to that
object that the works which are already in man’s power should (like so
many provinces formerly occupied and subdued) be noted and enumerated,
especially such as are the most complete and perfect; because starting
from them we shall find an easier and nearer passage to new works
hitherto unattempted. For if from an attentive contemplation of these a
man pushes on his work with zeal and activity, he will infallibly either
advance them a little further, or turn them aside to something in their
neighborhood, or even apply and transfer them to some more noble
use.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. But as by rare and extraordinary works of nature the
understanding is excited and raised to the investigation and discovery
of forms capable of including them, so also is this done by excellent
and wonderful works of art, and that in a much greater degree, because
the method of creating and constructing such miracles of art is in most
cases plain, whereas in the miracles of nature it is generally obscure.
But with these also we must use the utmost caution lest they depress the
understanding and fasten it as it were to the ground.</p>
<p>For there is danger lest the contemplation of such works of art,
which appear to be the very summits and crowning points of human
industry, may so astonish and bind and bewitch the understanding with
regard to them, that it shall be incapable of dealing with any other,
but shall think that nothing can be done in that kind except by the same
way in which these were done — only with the use of greater diligence
and more accurate preparation.</p>
<p>Whereas on the contrary this is certain: that the ways and means of
achieving the effects and works hitherto discovered and observed are for
the most part very poor things, and that all power of a high order
depends on forms and is derived in order from the sources thereof; not
one of which has yet been discovered.</p>
<p>And therefore (as I have said elsewhere) if a man had been thinking
of the war engines and battering-rams of the ancients, though he had
done it with all his might and spent his whole life in it, yet he would
never have lighted on the discovery of cannon acting by means of
gunpowder. Nor again, if he had fixed his observation and thought on the
manufacture of wool and cotton, would he ever by such means have
discovered the nature of the silkworm or of silk.</p>
<p>Hence it is that all the discoveries which can take rank among the
nobler of their kind have (if you observe) been brought to light, not by
small elaborations and extensions of arts, but entirely by accident. Now
there is nothing which can forestall or anticipate accident (which
commonly acts only at long intervals) except the discovery of forms.</p>
<p>Particular examples of such instances it is unnecessary to adduce,
for there is such an abundance of them. For what we have to do is simply
this: to seek out and thoroughly inspect all mechanical arts, and all
liberal too (as far as they deal with works), and make therefrom a
collection or particular history of the great and masterly and most
perfect works in every one of them, together with the mode of their
production or operation.</p>
<p>And yet I do not tie down the diligence that should be used in such a
collection to those works only which are esteemed the masterpieces and
mysteries of any art, and which excite wonder. For wonder is the child
of rarity; and if a thing be rare, though in kind it be no way
extraordinary, yet it is wondered at. While on the other hand things
which really call for wonder on account of the difference in species
which they exhibit as compared with other species, yet if we have them
by us in common use, are but slightly noticed.</p>
<p>Now the singularities of art deserve to be noticed no less than those
of nature, of which I have already spoken. And as among the
singularities of nature I placed the sun, the moon, the magnet, and the
like — things in fact most familiar, but in nature almost unique — so
also must we do with the singularities of art.</p>
<p>For example, a singular instance of art is paper, a thing exceedingly
common. Now if you observe them with attention, you will find that
artificial materials are either woven in upright and transverse threads,
as silk, woolen or linen cloth, and the like; or cemented of concreted
juices, as brick, earthenware, glass, enamel, porcelain, etc., which are
bright if well united, but if not, are hard indeed but not bright. But
all things that are made of concrete juices are brittle, and no way
cohesive or tenacious. On the contrary, paper is a tenacious substance
that may be cut or torn; so that it imitates and almost rivals the skin
or membrane of an animal, the leaf of a vegetable, and the like pieces
of nature’s workmanship. For it is neither brittle like glass, nor woven
as cloth; but is in fibers, not distinct threads, just like natural
materials; so that among artificial materials you will hardly find
anything similar; but it is altogether singular. And certainly among
things artificial those are to be preferred which either come nearest to
an imitation of nature, or on the contrary overrule and turn her
back.</p>
<p>Again, as instances of the wit and hand of man, we must not
altogether contemn juggling and conjuring tricks. For some of them,
though in use trivial and ludicrous, yet in regard to the information
they give may be of much value.</p>
<p>Lastly, matters of superstition and magic (in the common acceptation
of the word) must not be entirely omitted. For although such things lie
buried deep beneath a mass of falsehood and fable, yet they should be
looked into a little. For it may be that in some of them some natural
operation lies at the bottom, as in fascination, strengthening of the
imagination, sympathy of things at a distance, transmission of
impressions from spirit to spirit no less than from body to body, and
the like.</p>
