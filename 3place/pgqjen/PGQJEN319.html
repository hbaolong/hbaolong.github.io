<h4 id="section">52</h4>
<p>So much then for the dignities or prerogatives of instances. It must
be remembered, however, that in this Organon of mine I am handling
logic, not philosophy. But since my logic aims to teach and instruct the
understanding, not that it may with the slender tendrils of the mind
snatch at and lay hold of abstract notions (as the common logic does),
but that it may in very truth dissect nature, and discover the virtues
and actions of bodies, with their laws as determined in matter; so that
this science flows not merely from the nature of the mind, but also from
the nature of things — no wonder that it is everywhere sprinkled and
illustrated with speculations and experiments in nature, as examples of
the art I teach. It appears then from what has been said that there are
twenty-seven prerogative instances, namely, solitary instances;
migratory instances; striking instances; clandestine instances;
constitutive instances; conformable instances; singular instances;
deviating instances; bordering instances; instances of power; instances
of companionship and of enmity; subjunctive instances; instances of
alliance; instances of the fingerpost; instances of divorce; instances
of the door; summoning instances; instances of the road; instances
supplementary; dissecting instances; instances of the rod; instances of
the course; doses of nature; instances of strife; intimating instances;
polychrest instances; magical instances. Now the use of these instances,
wherein they excel common instances, is found either in the informative
part or in the operative, or in both. As regards the informative, they
assist either the senses or the understanding: the senses, as the five
instances of the lamp; the understanding, either by hastening the
exclusion of the form, as solitary instances; or by narrowing and
indicating more nearly the affirmative of the form, as instances
migratory, striking, of companionship, and subjunctive; or by exalting
the understanding and leading it to genera and common natures, either
immediately, as instances clandestine, singular, and of alliance, or in
the next degree, as constitutive, or in the lowest, as conformable; or
by setting the understanding right when led astray by habit, as
deviating instances; or by leading it to the great form or fabric of the
universe, as bordering instances; or by guarding it against false forms
and causes, as instances of the fingerpost and of divorce. In the
operative part they either point out, or measure, or facilitate
practice. They point it out by showing with what we should begin, that
we may not go again over old ground, as instances of power; or to what
we should aspire if means be given, as intimating instances. The four
mathematical instances measure practice: polychrest and magical
instances facilitate it.</p>
<p>Again, out of these twenty-seven instances there are some of which we
must make a collection at once, as I said above, without waiting for the
particular investigation of natures. Of this sort are instances
conformable, singular, deviating, bordering, of power, of the dose,
intimating, polychrest, and magical. For these either help and set right
the understanding and senses, or furnish practice with her tools in a
general way. The rest need not be inquired into till we come to make
Tables of Presentation for the work of the interpreter concerning some
particular nature. For the instances marked and endowed with these
prerogatives are as a soul amid the common instances of presentation
and, as I said at first, a few of them do instead of many; and therefore
in the formation of the Tables they must be investigated with all zeal
and set down therein. It was necessary to handle them beforehand because
I shall have to speak of them in what follows. But now I must proceed to
the supports and rectifications of induction, and then to concretes, and
Latent Processes, and Latent Configurations, and the rest, as set forth
in order in the twenty-first Aphorism; that at length (like an honest
and faithful guardian) I may hand over to men their fortunes, now their
understanding is emancipated and come as it were of age; whence there
cannot but follow an improvement in man’s estate and an enlargement of
his power over nature. For man by the fall fell at the same time from
his state of innocency and from his dominion over creation. Both of
these losses however can even in this life be in some part repaired; the
former by religion and faith, the latter by arts and sciences. For
creation was not by the curse made altogether and forever a rebel, but
in virtue of that charter “In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat
bread,” it is now by various labors (not certainly by disputations or
idle magical ceremonies, but by various labors) at length and in some
measure subdued to the supplying of man with bread, that is, to the uses
of human life.</p>
