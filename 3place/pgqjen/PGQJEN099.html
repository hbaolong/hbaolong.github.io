<h4 id="viii.-century.">VIII. Century.</h4>
<p>THere be Mineralls, and Fossiles, in great Varietie; But of Veines of
Earth Medicinall, but few; The Chiefe are, Terra Lemnia, Terra Sigillata
communis, and Bolus Arminus: Whereof Terra Lemnia is the Chiefe. The
Vertues of them are, for Curing of Wounds, Stanching of Bloud, Stopping
of Flaxes and Rheumes, and Arresting the Spreading of Poison, Infection,
and Putrefaction: And they haue, of all other Simples, the Perfectest
and Purest Qualitie of Drying, with little or no Mixture of any other
Qualitie. Yet it is true, that the Bole-Arminicke is the most Cold of
them; And that Terra Lemnia is the most Hot; For which Cause, the Island
Lemnos, where it is digged, was in the Old Fabulous Ages consecrated to
Vulcan.</p>
<p>About the Bottome of the Straights are gathered great Quantities of
Sponges, which are gathered from the sides of Rocks, being as it were a
large, but tough, Mosse. It is the more to be noted, because that there
be but few Substances, Plant-like, that grow deepe within the Sea; For
they are gathered sometimes fifteene Fathome deepe; And when they are
laid on Shoare, they seeme to be of great Bulke; But crushed together,
will be transported in a very small Roome.</p>
<p>It seemeth, that Fish, that are vsed to the Salt-Water, doe
neuerthelesse delight more in Fresh. Wee see, that Salmons, and Smelts,
loue to get into Riuers, though it be against the Streame. At the Hauen
of Constantinople, you shall haue great Quantities of Fish that come
from the Euxine-Sea; that when they come into the Fresh Water, doe
inebriate and turne vp their Bellies; So as you may take them with your
Hand. I doubt, there hath not beene sufficient Experiment made of
Putting Sea-Fish into Fresh Water, Ponds, and Pooles. It is a Thing of
great Vse, and Pleasure: For so you may haue them new at some good
distance from the Sea: And besides, it may be, the Fish will eat the
pleasanter, and may fall to breed: And it is said that Colchester
Oysters, which are put into Pits, where the Sea goeth and commeth, (but
yet so, that there is a Fresh Water Comming also to them, when the Sea
voideth,) become by that meanes Fatter, and more Growne.</p>
<p>The Turkish-Bow giueth a very Forcible Shoot; Insomuch as it hath
beene knowne, that the Arrow hath pierced a Stecle Target, or a Peece of
Brasse of two Inches thicke: But that which is more strange, the Arrow,
if it be Headed with Wood, hath beene knowne to pierce thorow a Peece of
Wood, of eight Inches thicke. And it is certaine, that wee had in vse at
one time, for Sea-Fight, short Arrowes, which they called Sprights,
without any other Heads, saue Wood sharpned; which were discharged out
of Muskets, and would pierce thorow the Sides of Ships, where a Bullet
would not pierce. But this dependeth vpon one of the greatest Secrets in
all Nature; Which is, that Similitude of Substance will cause
Attraction, where the Body is wholly freed from the Motion of Grauitie:
For if that were taken away, Lead would draw Lead, and Gold would draw
Gold, and Iron would draw Iron, without the helpe of the Load-Stone. But
this same Motion of Weight or Grauitie, (which is a meere Motion of the
Matter, and hath no Affinitie with the Forme, or Kinde,) doth kill the
other Motion, except it selfe be killed by a violent Motion; As in these
Instances of Arrowes; For then the Motion of Attraction by Similitude of
Substance, beginneth to shew it selfe. But wee shall handle this Point
of Nature fully in due Place.</p>
<p>They haue in Turkey, and the East, certaine Confections, which they
call Seruetts, which are like to Candied Conserues; And are made of
Sugar and Limons, or Sugar and Citrons, or Sugar and Violets, and some
other Flowers; And some Mixture of Amber for the more delicate Persons;
And those they dissolue in Water, and thereof make their Drinke because
they are forbidden Wine by their Law. But I doe much maruell that no
Englishman, or Dutehman, or German, doth set vp Brewing in
Constantinople; Considering they haue such Quantitie of Barley. For as
so the generall Sort of Men, Frugalitie may be the Cause of Drinking
Water; For that it is no small Sauing, to pay nothing for ones Drinke:
But the better Sort mought well be at the Cost. And yet I wonder the
lesse at it, because I see France, Italie, or Spaine, haue not taken
into vse, Beere, or Ale; Which (perhaps) if they did, would better both
their Healths, and their Complexions. It is likely it would be Matter of
great Gaine to any, that should begin it in Turkey.</p>
<p>In Bathing in Hot Water, Sweat (neuerthelesse) commeth not in the
Parts vnder the Water. The Cause is; First, for that Sweat is a Kinde of
Colliquation. And that Kinde of Colliquation is not made, either by an
Ouer-Drie Heat, or an Ouer-Moist Heat. For Ouer-Moisture doth somewhat
extinguish the Heat; As wee see that euen Hot Water quencheth Fire: And
Ouer-Drie Heat shutteth the Pores: And therefore Men will sooner Sweat
couered before the Sunne, or Fire, than if they stood Naked; And Earthen
Bottles, filled with Hot Water, doe prouoke, in Bed, a Sweat more
daintily, than Bricke-bats Hot. Secondly, Hot Water doth cause
Euaporation from the Skin; So as it spendeth the Matter, in those Parts
vnder the Water, before it issueth in Sweat. Againe, Sweat commeth more
plentifully, if the Heat be increased by Degrees, than if it be greatest
at first, or equall. The Cause is, for that the Pores are better opened
by a Gentle Heat, than by a more Violent; And by their opening the Sweat
issueth more abundantly. And therefore Physitians may doe well, when
they prouoke Sweat in Bed, by Bottles, with a Decoction of Sudorisicke
Herbs in Hot Water, to make two Degrees of Heat in the Bottles; And to
lay in the Bed, the lesse Heated first, and after halfe an Houre the
more Heated.</p>
<p>Sweat is Salt in Taste; The Cause is, for that, that Part of the
Nourishment, which is Fresh and Sweet, turneth into Bloud, and Flesh;
And the Sweat is only that Part which is Separate, and Excerned. Bloud
also Raw hath some Saltnesse, more than Flesh; because the Assimilation
into Flesh, is not without a little and subtile Excretion from the
Bloud.</p>
<p>Sweat commeth forth more out of the Vpper Parts of the Body, than the
Lower; The Reason is, because those Parts are more replenished with
Spirits; And the Spirits are they that put forth Sweat: Besides, they
are lesse Fleshy, and Sweat issueth (chiefly) out of the Parts that are
lesse Fleshy, and more Dry; As the Forehead, and Breast.</p>
<p>Men Sweat more in Sleepe, than Waking; And yet Sleepe doth rather
stay other Fluxions, than cause them; As Rheumes, Loosenesse of the
Body, andandandandc. The Cause is, for that in Sleepe, the Heat and
Spirits doe naturally moue inwards, and there rest. But when they are
collected once within, the Heat becommeth more Violent, and Irritate;
And thereby expelleth Sweat.</p>
<p>Cold Sweats are (many times) Mortall, and neere Death; And alwayes
ill, and Suspected; As in Great Feares, Hypochondricall Passions,
andandandandc. The Cause is, for that Cold Sweats come by a Relaxation
or Forsaking of the Spirits, wherby the Moisture of the Body, which Heat
did keepe firme in the Parts, seuereth, and issueth out.</p>
<p>In those Diseases, which cannot be discharged by Sweat, Sweat is ill,
and rather to be stayed; As in Diseases of the Lungs, and Fluxes of the
Belly; But in those Diseases, which are expelled by Sweat, it easeth and
lightneth; As in Agues, Pestilences, andandandandc. The Cause is, for
that Sweat in the Latter Sort is partly Criticall, and sendeth forth the
Matter that offendeth; But in the Former, it either proceedeth from the
Labour of the Spirits, which sheweth them Oppressed; Or from Motion of
Consent, when Nature not able to expell the Disease, where it is seated,
moueth to an Expulsion indifferent ouer all the Body.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Glo-wormexs is hitherto not well obserued. Thus
much we see; That they breed chiefly in the Hottest Moneths of Summer;
And that they breed not in Champaigne, but in Bushes, and Hedges. Wherby
it may be conceiued, that the Spirit of them is very fine, and not to be
refined, but by Summer Heats: And againe, that by reason of the
Finenesse, it doth easily exhale. In Italy, and the Hotter Countries,
there is a Fly they call Lucciole, that shineth as the Glo-worme doth;
And it may be is the Flying Glo-worme. But that Fly is chiefly vpon
Fens, and Marrishes. But yet the two former Obseruations hold; For they
are not seene, but in the Heat of Summer; And Sedge, or other Greene of
the Fens, giue as good Shade, as Bushes. It may be the Glo-wormes of the
Cold Countries ripen not so farre as to be Winged.</p>
<p>The Passions of the Minde, worke vpon the Body the Impressions
following.Feare causeth Palenesse; Trembling; The Standing of the Haire
vpright; Starting; and Skritching. The Palenesse is caused, for that the
Bloud runneth inward, to succour the Heart. The Trembling is caused, for
that through the Flight of the Spirits inward, the Outward Parts are
destituted, and not sustained. Standing Vpright of the Haire is caused,
for that by the Shutting of the Pores of the Skin, the Haire that lyeth
asloape, must needs Rise, Starting is both an Apprehension of the Thing
feared, (And, in that kinde, it is a Motion of Shrincking;) And likewise
an Inquisition, in the beginning, what the Matter should be; (And in
that kinde it is a Motion of Erection;) And therefore, when a Man would
listen suddenly to any Thing, he Starteth; For the Starting is an
Erection of the Spirits to attend. Skritching is an Appetite of
Expelling that which suddenly striketh the Spirits: For it must be
noted, that many Motions, though they be vnprofitable to expell that
which hurteth, yet they are Offers of Nature, and cause Motions by
Consent; As in Groaning, or Crying vpon Paine.</p>
<p>Griefe and Paine cause Sighing; Sobbing; Groaning; Screaming; and
Roaring; Teares; Distorting of the Face; Grinding of the Teeth;
Sweating. Sighing is caused by the Drawing in of a greater Quantity of
Breath to refresh the Heart that laboureth: like a great Draught when
one is thirsty. Sobbing is the same Thing stronger. Groaning, and
Screaming, and Roaring, are caused by an Appetite of Expulsion, as hath
beene said: For when the Spirits cannot expell the Thing that hurteth,
in their Strife to do it, by Motion of Consent, they expell the Voice.
And this is, when the Spirits yeeld, and giue ouer to resist; For if one
doe constantly resist Paine, he will not groane. Teares are caused by a
Contraction of the Spirits of the Braine; Which Contraction by
consequence astringeth the Moisture of the Braine, and thereby sendeth
Teares into the Eyes. And this Contraction, or Compression causeth also
Wringing of the Hands; For Wringing is a Gesture of Expression of
Moisture. The Distorting of the Face is caused by a Contention, first to
beare and resist, and then to expell; Which maketh the Parts knit first,
and afterwards open. Grinding of the Teeth is caused (likewise) by a
Gathering and Serring of the Spirits together to resist; Which maketh
the Teeth also to set hard one against another. Sweating is also a
Compound Motion by the Labour of the Spirits, first to resist, and then
to expell.</p>
<p>Ioy causeth a Chearefulnesse, and Vigour in the Eyes; Singing;
Leaping; Dancing; And sometimes Teares. All these are the Effects of the
Dilatation, and Comming forth of the Spirits into the Outward Parts;
Which maketh them more Linely, and Stirring. We know it hath beene
seene, that Excessiue Sudden Ioy, hath caused Present Death, while the
Spirits did spread so much, as they could not retire againe. As for
Teares, they are the Effects of Compression of the Moisture of the
Braine. vpon Dilatation of the Spirits. For Compression of the Spirits
worketh an Expression of the Moisture of the Braine, by Consent, as hath
beene said in Griefe. But then in Ioy, it worketh it diuersly; viz. by
Prepulsion of the Moisture, when the Spirits dilate, and occupy more
Roome.</p>
<p>Anger causeth Palenesse in some, and the Going and Comming of the
Colour in Others: Also Trembling in some, Swelling; Foaming at the
Month; Stamping; Bending of the Fist. Palenesse, and Going, and Comming
of the Colour, are caused by the Burning of the Spirits about the Heart;
Which to refresh themselues call in more Spirits from the Outward Parts.
And if the Palenesse be alone, without Sending forth the Colour againe,
it is commonly ioyned with some Feare; But in many there is no Palenesse
at all, but contrariwise Rednesse about the Cheekes, and Gills; Which is
by the Sending forsh of the Spirits in an Appetite to Reuenge. Trembling
in Anger is likewise by a Calling in of the Spirits; And is commonly,
when Anger is ioyned with Feare. Swelling is caused, both by a
Dilatation of the Spirits by Ouer-Heating, and by a Liquefaction or
Boyling of the Humours thereupon. Foaming at the Mouth is from the same
Cause, being an Ebullition. Stamping. and Bending of the Fist, are
caused by an Imagination of the Act of Reuenge.</p>
<p>Light Displeasure or Dislike, causeth Shaking of the Head; Frowning,
and Knitting of the B — es. These Effects arise from the same Causes
that Trembling, and Horrour doe; Namely, from the Retiring of the
Spirits. but in a lesse degree. For the Shaking of the Head is but a
Slow and Definite Trembling; And is a Gesture of Slight Refusall: And we
see also, that a Dislike causeth (often) that Gesture of the Hand, which
wee vse, when we refuse a Thing, or warne it away. The Frowning, and
Knitting of the Browes, is a Gathering, or Serring of the Spirits, to
resist in some Measure. And we see also, this Knitting of the Browes
will follow vpon earnest Studying, or Cogitation of any Thing, though it
bee without Dislike.</p>
<p>Shame causeth Blushing; And Casting downe of the Eyes. Blushing is
the Resort of Bloud to the Face; Which in the Passion of Shame is the
Part that laboureth most. And although the Blushing will be seene in the
whole Breast, if it be Naked, yet that is but in Passage to the Face. As
for the Casting downe of the Eyes, it proceedeth of the Reuerence a Man
beareth to other Men; Whereby, when he is ashamed, he cannot endure to
looke firmely vpon Others: And we see that Blushing, and the Casting
downe of the Eyes both, are more when we come before Many; Ore Pompeij
quid mollius? Nunquàm non coram pluribus erubuit: And likewise when we
come before Great, or Reuerend Persons.</p>
<p>Pity causeth sometimes Teares; And a Flexion or Cast of the Eye
aside. Teares come from the same Cause that they doe in Griefe: for Pity
is but Griefe in Anothers Behalfe. The Cast of the Eye is a Gesture of
Auersion, or Loathnesse to behold the Obiect of Pity.</p>
<p>Wonder causeth Astonishment, or an Immoueable Posture of the Body;
Casting vp of the Eyes to Heauen; And Lifting vp of the Hands. For
Astonishment, it is caused by the Fixing of the Minde vpon one Obiect of
Cogitation, whereby it doth not spatiate and transcurre, as it vseth:
For in Wonder the Spirits fly not, as in Feare; But onely settle, and
are made lesse apt to moue. As for the Casting vp of the Eyes, and
Lifting vp of the Hands, it is a Kinde of Appeale to the Deity; Which is
the Authour, by Power, and Prouidence, of Strange Wonders.</p>
<p>Laughing causeth a Dilatation of the Mouth, and Lips; A Continued
Expulsion of the Breath, with the loud Noise, which maketh the
Interiection of Laughing; Shaking of the Breast, and Sides; Running of
the Eyes with Water, if it be Violent, and Continued. Wherein first it
is to be vnderstood, that Laughing is scarce (properly) a Passion, but
hath his Source from the Intellect; For in Laughing there euer precedeth
a Conceit of somewhat Ridiculous, And therefore it is Proper to Man.
Secondly, that the Cause of Laughing is but a Light Touch of the
Spirits, and not so deepe an Impression as in other Passions. And
therefore, (that which hath no Affinity with the Passions of the Minde)
it is moued, and that in great vehemency, onely by Tickling some Parts
of the Body: And we see that Men euen in a Grieued State of Minde, yet
cannot sometimes forbeare Laughing. Thirdly, it is euer ioyned with some
Degree of Delight: And therefore Exhilaration hath some Affinity with
Ioy, though it be a much Lighter Motion: Res seneraest verum Gandium.
Fourthly, that the Obiect of it is Deformity, Absurdity, Shrew’d Turnes,
and the like. Now to speake of the Causes of the Effects before
mentioned, whereunto these Generall Notes giue some Light, For the
Dilatation of the Mouth and Lips, Continued Expulsion of the Breath and
Voice, and Shaking of the Breast and Sides, they proceed (all) from the
Dilatation of the Spirits; Especially being Sudden. So likewise, the
Running of the Eyes with Water, (as hath beene formerly touched, where
we spake of the Teares of Ioy and Griefe,) is an Effect of Dilatation of
the Spirits. And for Suddennesse, it is a great Part of the Matter: For
we see, that any Shrew’d Turne that lighteth vpon Another; Or any
Deformity, andandandandc. moueth Laughter in the Instant; Which after a
little time it doth not. So we cannot Laugh at any Thing after it is
Stale, but whilest it is New: And euen in Tickling, if you Tickle the
Sides, and giue warning; Or giue a Hard or Continued Touch, it doth not
moue Laughter so much.</p>
<p>Lust causeth a Flagrancy in the Eyes; and Priapisme. The Cause of
both these is, for that in Lust, the Sight, and the Touch, are the
Things desired: And therefore the Spirits resort to those part-, whch
are most affected. And note well in generall, (For that great Vse may be
made of the Obseruation,) that (euermore) the Spirits, in all Passions,
resort most to the Parts, that labour most, or are most affected. As in
the last, which hath been mentioned, they resort to the Eyes, and
Venereous Parts: In Feare, and Anger, to the Heart: In Shame to the
Face: And in Light Dislikes to the Head.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by the Ancients and is yet beleeued, that the
Sperme of Drunken Men is Vnfruitfull. The Cause is, for that it is
Ouer-moistened, and wanteth Spissitude. And we haue a merry Saying, that
they that goe Drunke to Bed, get Daughters.</p>
<p>Drunken Men are taken with a plaine Defect, or Destitution in
Voluntary Motion. They — ele: They tremble: They cannot stand, nor
speake strongly. The —— is, for that the Spirits of the Wine, oppresse
the Spirits Animall, and — pate Part of the Place, where they are; And
so make them Weake to moue. And therefore Drunken Men are apt to fall
asleepe: And Opiates, and Stupefactines, (as Poppy, Henbane, Hemlocke,
andandandandc.) induce a kinde of Drunkennesse, by the Grossenesse of
their Vapour; As Wine doth by the Quantity of the Vapour. Besides, they
rob the Spirits Animall of their Matter, whereby they are nourished: For
the Spirits of the Wine prey vpon it, as well as they: And so they make
the Spirits lesse Supple, and Apt to moue.</p>
<p>Drunken Men imagine euery Thing turneth round; They imagine also that
Things Come vpon them; They See not well Things a farre off; Those
Things that they See neare hand, they See out of their Place; And
(sometimes) they see Things double. The Cause of the Imagination that
Things turne Round, is, for that the Spirits themselues turne, being
compressed by the Vapour of the Wine: (For any Liquid Body vpon
Compression, turneth, as we see in Water:) And it is all one to the
Sight, whether the Visuall Spirits moue, or the Obiect moueth, or the
Medium moueth. And we see that long Turning Round breedeth the same
Imagination. The Cause of the Imagination that Things come vpon them,
is, for that the Spirits Visuall themselues draw backe; which maketh the
Obiect seeme to come on; And besides, when they see Things turne Round,
and Moue, Feare maketh them thinke they come vpon them. The Cause that
they cannot see Things a farre off, is the Weaknesse of the Spirits; for
in euery Megrim, or Vertige, there is an Obtenebration ioyned with a
Semblance of Turning round; Which we see also in the lighter Sort of
Swonnings. The Cause of Seeing things out of their Place, is the
Refraction: of the Spirits Visuall; For the Vapour is as an Vnequall
Medium; And it is, as the Sight of Things, out of place, in Water. The
Cause of Seeing Things double, is, the Swift and Vnquiet Motion of the
Spirits, (being Oppressed,) to and fro; For, (as was said before,) the
Motion of the Spirits Visuall, and the Motion of the Obiect, make the
same Appearances; And for the Swift Motion of the Obiect, we see, that
if you fillip a Lute-String, it sheweth double, or Treble.</p>
<p>Men are sooner Drunke with Small Draughts, than with Great. And
againe, Wine Sugred inebriateth lesse, than Wine Pure. The Cause of the
Former is, for that the Wine descendeth not so fast to the Bottome of
the Stomach; But maketh longer Stay in the Vpper Part of the Stomach,
and sendeth Vapours faster to the Head; And therefore inebriateth
sooner. And, for the same Reason, Sops in Wine, (Quantity for Quantity,)
inebriate more, than Wine of it selfe. The Cause of the Latter is, for
that the Sugar doth inspissate the Spirits of the Wine, and maketh them
not so easie to resolue into Vapour. Nay further, it is thought, to be
some Remedy against Inebriating, if Wine Sugred be taken after Wine
Pure. And the same Effect is wrought either by Oyle, or Milke, taken
vpon much Drinking.</p>
<p>The Vse of Wine, in Dry, and Consumed Bodies, is hurtfull; In Moist,
and Full Bodies, it is good. The Cause is, for that the Spirits of the
Wine doe prey vpon the Dew, or Radicall Moisture, (as they terme it,) of
the Body, and so deceiue the Animall Spirits. But where there is
Moisture Enough, or Superfluous, there Wine helpeth to disgest, and
desiccate the Moisture.</p>
<p>The Catterpiller is one of the most Generall of Wormes, and breedeth
of Dew, and Leaues: For we see infinite Number of Catterpillers, which
breed vpon Trees, and Hedges; By which the Leaues of the Trees, or
Hedges, are in great Part consumed; As well by their Breeding out of the
Leafe, as by their Feeding vpon the Leafe. They breed in the Spring
chiefly, because then there is both Dew, and Leafe. And they breed
commonly when the East Winds haue much blowne: The Cause whereof is, the
Drinesse of that Wind: For to all Viuification vpon Putrefaction, it is
requisite the Matter be not too Moist: And therefore we see, they haue
Copwebs about them, which is a signe of a Slimy Drinesse: As we see vpon
the Ground, whereupon, by Dew, and Sunne, Copwebs breed all ouer. We see
also the Greene Catterpiller breedeth in the Inward Parts of Roses,
especially not blowne, where the Dew sticketh: But especially
Catterpillers, both the greatest, and the most, breed vpon Cabbages,
which haue a Fat Leafe, and apt to Putrifie. The Catterpiller towards
the End of Summer waxeth Volatile, and turneth to a Butterfly, or
perhaps some other Fly. There is a Catterpiller, that hath a Furre, or
Downe vpon him, and seemeth to haue Affinity with the Silke-worme</p>
<p>The Flyes Cantharides are bred of a Worme, or Catterpiller, but
peculiar to certaine Fruit-Trees; As are the Fig-tree, the Pine-tree,
and the Wilde Briar; All which beare Sweet Fruit; And Fruit that hath a
kinde of secret Biting, or Sharpnesse: For the Fig hath a Milke in it,
that is Sweet, and Corrosiue: The Pine-Apple hath a Kernell that is
Strong and Absterside: The Fruit of the Briar is said to make Children,
or those that Eat them, Scabbed. And therefore, no maruell though
Cantharides haue such a Corrosiue, and Cauterizing Quality; For there is
not any other of the Insecta, but is bred of a Duller Matter. The Body
of the Cantharides is bright coloured; And it may be, that the
delicate-coloured Dragon-Flies, may haue likewise some Corrosiue
Quality.</p>
<p>Lassitude is remedied by Bathing, or Annointing with Oyle, and Warme
water. The Cause is, for that all Lassitude is a kinde of Contusion, and
Compression of the Parts; And Bathing, and Annointing giue a Relaxation,
or Emollition: And the Mixture of Oyle, and Water, is better than either
of them alone; Because Water Entreth better into the Pores, and Oyle
after Entry softneth better. It is found also, that the Taking of
Tobacco doth helpe and discharge Lassitude. The Reason whereof is,
partly, because by Chearing or Comforting of the Spirits it openeth the
Parts Compressed, or Contused: And chiefly, because it refresheth the
Spirits by the Opiate Vertue thereof; And so dischargeth Wearinesse; as
Sleepe likewise doth.</p>
<p>In Going vp a Hill, the Knees will be most Weary; In Going downe a
Hill, the Thighes. The Cause is, for that, in the Lift of the Feet, when
a Man Goeth vp the Hill, the Weight of the Body beareth most vpon the
Knees; And in Going downe the Hill, vpon the Thighes.</p>
<p>The Casting of the Skin, is by the Ancients compared, to the Breaking
of the Secundine, or Call; but not rightly: For that were to make euery
Casting of the Skin a New Birth: And besides, the Secundine is but a
generall Couer, not shaped according to the Parts; But the Skin is
shaped according to the Parts. The Creatures, that cast their Skin, are;
The Snake, the Viper, the Grashopper, the Lizard, the Silke worme,
andandandandc. Those that cast their Shell, are; The Lobster, the Crab,
the Crafish, the Hodmandod or Dedman, the Tortoise, andandandandc. The
Old Skins are found, but the Old Shells neuer: So as it is like, they
scale off, and crumble away by degrees. And they are knowne, by the
Extreme Tendernesse and Softnesse of the New Shell; And somewhat by the
Freshnesse of the Colour of it. The Cause of the Casting of Skin, and
Shell, should seeme to be the great Quantity of Matter in those
Creatures, that is fit to make Skin, or Shell; And againe, the
Loosenesse of the Skin, or Shell, that sticketh not close to the Flesh.
For it is certaine, that it is the New Skin, or Shell, that putteth off
the Old: So we see, that in Deere, it is the Young Horne, that putteth
off the Old; And in Birds, the Young Feathers put off the Old: And so
Birds, that haue much Matter for their Beake, cast their Beakes; the New
Beake Putting off the Old.</p>
<p>Lying, not Erect, but Hollow, which is in the Making of the Bed; Or
with the Legges gathered vp, which is in the Posture of the Body, is the
more Wholesome. The Reason is, the better Comforting of the Stomach,
which is by that lesse Pensile: And we see, that in Weake Stomachs, the
Laying vp of the Legs high, and the Knees almost to the Mouth, helpeth,
and comforteth. We see also that Gally-Slanes, notwithstanding their
Misery otherwise, are commonly Fat and Fleshy; And the Reason is,
because the Stomach is supported somewhat in Sitting; And is Pensile in
Standing, or Going. And therefore, for Prolongation of Life, it is good
to choose those Exercises, where the Limbes moue more than the Stomach,
and Belly; As in Rowing, and in Sawing being Set.</p>
<p>Megrims and Giddinesse are rather when we Rise, after long Sitting,
than while we Sit. The Cause is, for that the Vapours, which were
gathered by Sitting, by the Sudden Motion, fly more vp into the
Head.</p>
<p>Leaning long vpon any Part maketh it Numme, and, as wee call it,
Asleepe. The Cause is, for that the Compression of the Part suffereth
not the Spirits to haue free Accesse; And therefore, when wee come out
of it, wee feele a Stinging or —— ing; Which is the Re-entrance of the
Spirits.</p>
<p>It hath beene noted, that those Yeares are Pestilentiall, and
Vnwholesome, when there are great Numbers of Frogs, Flies, Locusts,
andandandandc. The Cause is plaine; For that those Creatures being
engendred of Putrefaction, when they abound, shew a generall Disposition
of the Yeare, and Constitution of the Aire, to Diseases of Putrefaction.
And the same Prognesticke, (as hath beene said before,) holdeth, if you
finde Wormes in OakeApples. For the Constitution of the Aire, appeareth
more subtilly, in any of these Things, than to the Sense of Man.</p>
<p>It is an Obseruation amongst Country-People, that Yeares of Store of
Hawes and Heps, doe commonly portend Cold Winters; And they ascribe it
to Gods Prouidence, that, (as the Scripture saith) reacheth euen to the
Falling of a Sparrow; And much more is like to reach to the Preseruation
of Birds in such Seasons. The Naturall Cause also may be the Want of
Heat, and Abundance of Moisture, in the Summer precedent; Which putteth
forth those Fruits, and must needs leaue great Quantity of Cold Vapours,
not dissipate; Which causeth the Cold of the Winter following.</p>
<p>They haue in Turkey, a Drinke called Coffa, made of a Berry of the
same Name, as Blacke as Soot, and of a Strong Sent, but not Aromaticall;
Which they take, beaten into Powder, in Water, as Hot as they can drinke
it: And they take it, and sit at it, in their Coffa-Houses, which are
like our Tauernes. This Drinke comforteth the Braine, and Heart, and
helpeth Disgestion. Certainly this Berry Coffa; The Root, and Leafe
Betel; The Leafe Tobacco; And the Teare of Poppy, (Opium,) of which the
Turks are great Takers, (supposing it expelleth all Feare;) doe all
Condense the Spirits, and make them Strong, and Aleger. But it seemeth
they are taken after seuerall manners; For Coffa and Opium are taken
downe; Tobacco but in Smoake; And Betel is but champed in the Mouth,
with a little Lime. It is like there are more of them, if they were well
found out, and well corrected. Quare of Henbane-Seed; Of Mandrake; Of
Saffron, Root, and Flower; Of Folium Indum; Of Amber-grice; Of the
Assyrian Amomum, if it may be had; And of the Scarlet Powder, which they
call Kermez; And (generally) of all such Things, as doe inebriate, and
prouoke Sleepe. Note that Tobacco is not taken in Root, or Seed, which
are more forcible euer than Leaues.</p>
<p>The Turkes haue a Blacke Powder, made of a Minerall called Alcohole;
Which with a fine long Pencill they lay vnder their Eye-lids; Which doth
colour them Blacke; Whereby the White of the Eye is set off more white.
With the same Powder they colour also the Haires of their Eye-lids, and
of their Eye-browes, which they draw into Embowed Arches. You shall
finde that Xenophon maketh Mention, that the Medes vsed to paint their
Eyes. The Turkes vse with the same Tincture, to colour the Haire of
their Heads and Beards Blacke: And diuers with vs, that are growne Gray,
and yet would appeare Young, finde meanes to make their Haire blacke, by
Combing it, (as they say,) with a Leaden Combe, or the like. As for the
Chineses, who are of an ill Complexion, (being Oliuaster,) they paint
their Cheekes Scarlet; Especially their King, and Grandes. Generally,
Barbarous People, that goe Naked, doe not onely paint Themselues, but
they pownce and raze their Skinne, that the Painting may not be taken
forth; And make it into Works. So doe the West Indians; And so did the
Ancient Picts, and Brittons; So that it seemeth, Men would haue the
Colours of Birds Feathers, if they could tell how; Or at least, they
will haue Gay Skins, instead of Gay Cloathes.</p>
<p>It is strange, that the Vse of Bathing, as a Part of Diet, is left.
With the Romans, and Grecians, it was as vsuall, as Eating, or Sleeping:
And so is it amongst the Turkes at this day: Whereas with vs it
remaineth but as a Part of Physicke. I am of Opinion, that the Vse of
it, as it was with the Romans, was hurtfull to Health; For that it made
the Body Soft, and easie to Waste. For the Turkes it is more proper,
because that their Drinking Water, and Feeding vpon Rize, and other Food
of small Nourishment, maketh their Bodies so Solide, and Hard, as you
need not feare that Bathing should make them Froathie. Besides, the
Turkes are great Sitters, and seldome walke; Whereby they Sweat lesse,
and need Bathing more. But yet certaine it is, that Bathing, and
especially Annointing, may be so vsed, as it may be a great Helpe to
Health, and Prolongation of Life. But hereof we shall speake in due
Place, when we come to handle Experiments Medicinall.</p>
<p>The Turkes haue a Pretty Art of Chamoletting of Paper, which is not
with vs in vse. They take diuers Oyled Colours, and put them seuerally
(in drops) vpon Water; And stirre the Water lightly; And then wet their
Paper, (being of some Thicknesse,) with it; And the Paper will be Waued,
and Veined, like Chamolet, or Marble.</p>
<p>It is somewhat strange, that the Bloud of all Birds, and Beasts, and
Fishes, should be of a Red Colour, and only the Bloud of the Cuttle
should be as Blacke as Inke. A Man would thinke, that the Cause should
be the High Concoction of that Bloud; For wee see in ordinary Puddings,
that the Boyling turneth the Bloud to be Blacke; And the Cuttle is
accounted a delicate Meat, and is much in Request.</p>
<p>It is reported of Credit, that if you take Earth, from Land adioyning
to the Riuer of Nile; And preserue it in that manner, that it neither
come to be Wet, nor Wasted; And Weigh it daily, it will not alter Weight
vntill the seuenteenth of Iune, which is the Day when the Riuer
beginneth to rise; And then it will grow more and more Ponderous, till
the Riuer commeth to his Heighth Which if it be true, it cannot be
caused, but by the Aire, which then beginneth to Condense; And so
turneth within that Small Mould into a degree of Moisture; Which
produceth Weight. So it hath beene obserued, that Tobacco, Cut, and
Weighed, and then Dried by the Fire, loseth Weight; And after being laid
in the open Aire, recouereth Weight againe. And it should seeme, that as
soone as euer the Riuer beginneth to increase, the whole Body of the
Aire thereabouts suffereth a Change: For (that which is more strange,)
it is credibly affirmed, that vpon that very Day, when the Riuer first
riseth, great Plagues, in Caire, vse suddenly to breake vp.</p>
<p>Those that are very Cold, and especially in their Feet, cannot get to
Sleepe. The Cause may be, for that in Sleepe is required a Free
Respiration, which Cold doth shut in, and hinder: For wee see, that in
great Colds, one can scarce draw his Breath. Another Cause may be, for
that Cold calleth the Spirits to succour; And therefore they cannot so
well close; and goe together in the Head; Which is euer requisite to
Sleepe. And for the same Cause, Paine, and Noise hinder Sleepe; And
Darknesse (contrariwise) furthereth Sleepe.</p>
<p>Some Noises (whereof wee spake in the 112. Experiment) helpe Sleepe;
As the Blowing of the Wind, the Trickling of Water, Humming of Bees,
Soft Singing, Reading, andandandandc. The Cause is, for that they moue
in the Spirits a gentle Attention; And whatsoeuer moueth Attention,
without too much Labour, stilleth the Naturall and discursiue Motion of
the Spirits.</p>
<p>Sleepe nourisheth, or at least preserueth Bodies, a long time,
without other Nourishment. Beasts that sleepe in Winter, (as it is noted
of Wilde Beares,) during their Sleep wax very Fat, though they Eat
nothing. Bats haue beene found in Ouens, and other Hollow Close Places,
Matted one vpon another; And therefore it is likely that they Sleepe in
the Winter time, and eat Nothing. Quare, whether Bees doe not Sleepe all
Winter, and spare their Honey? Butterflies, and other Flies, doe not
onely Sleepe, but lye as Dead all Winter; And yet with a little Heat of
Sunne, or Fire, reuine againe. A Dormonse, both Winter and Summer, will
Sleepe some dayes’ together, and eat Nothing.</p>
<p>To restore Teeth in Age, were Magnale Naturae. It may be thought of.
But howsoeuer the Nature of the Teeth deserueth to be enquired of, as
well as the other Parts of Liuing Creatures Bodies.</p>
<p>There be Fiue Parts in the Bodies of Liuing-Creatures, that are of
Hard Substance; The Skull; The Teeth; The Bones; The Hornes; and the
Nailes. The greatest Quantity of Hard Substance Continued, is towards
the Head. For there is the Skull of one Entire Bone; There are the
Teeth; There are the Maxillary Bones; There is the Hard Bone, that is
the Instrument of Hearing; And thence issue the Hornes: So that the
Building of Liuing Creatures Bodies, is like the Building of a
Timber-House, where the Walls, and other Parts haue Columnes, and
Beames; But the Roofe is, in the better Sort of Houses, all Tile, or
Lead, or Stone. As for Birds, they haue Three other Hard Substances
proper to them; The Bill, which is of like Matter with the Teeth; For no
Birds haue Teeth: The Shell of the Egge: And their Quills: For as for
their Spurre, it is but a Naile. But no Liuing-Creatures, that haue
Shells very hard; (As Oysters, Cockles, Mussles, Scallops, Crabs,
Lobsters, Cra-fish, Shrimps, and especially the Tortoise,) haue Bones
within them, but onely little Gristles.</p>
<p>Bones, after full Growth, continue at a Stay: And so doth the Skull:
Hornes, in some Creatures, are cast, and renued: Teeth stand at a Stay
except their Wearing: As for Nailes, they grow continually: And Bills
and Beakes will ouer-grow, and sometimes be cast; as in Eagles, and
Parrots.</p>
<p>Most of the Hard Substances fly to the Extremes of the Body, As
Skull, Hornes, Teeth, Nailes, and Beakes: Onely the Bones are more
Inward, and clad with Flesh. As for the Entrailes, they are all without
Bones; Saue that a Bone is (sometimes) found in the Heart of a Stag; And
it may be in some other Creature.</p>
<p>The Skull hath Braines, as a kinde of Marrow, within it. The
Back-Bone hath one Kinde of Marrow, which hath an Affinity with the
Braine; And other Bones of the Body haue another. The Iaw-Bones haue no
Marrow Seuered, but a little Pulpe of Marrow diffused. Teeth likewise
are thought to haue a kind of Marrow diffused, which causeth the Sense,
and Paine: But it is rather Sinnew; For Marrow hath no Sense; No more
than Bloud. Horne is alike throughout; And so is the Naile.</p>
<p>None other of the Hard Substances haue Sense, but the Teeth: And the
Teeth haue Sense, not onely of Paine, but of Cold.</p>
<p>But we will leaue the Enquiries of other Hard Substances, vnto their
seuerall Places; And now enquire onely of the Teeth.</p>
<p>The Teeth are, in Men, of three Kindes: Sharpe, as the Fore-Teeth;
Broad, as the Back-Teeth, which we call the Molar-Teeth, or Grinders;
And Pointed-Teeth, or Canine, which are betweene both. But there haue
beene some Men, that haue had their Teeth vndiuided, as of one whole
Bone, with some little Marke in the Place of the Diuision; As Pyrrhus
had. Some Creatures haue Ouer-long, or Out-growing Teeth, which wee call
Fangs, or Tuskes; As Boares, Pikes, Salmons, and Dogs though lesse. Some
Liuing Creatures haue Teeth against Teeth; As Men, and Horses; And some
haue Teeth, especially their Master-Teeth, indented one within Another,
like Sawes; As Lions; And so againe haue Dogs. Some Fishes haue diuers
Rowes of Teeth in the Roofes of their Mouthes; As Pikes, Salmons,
Trouts, andandandandc. And many more in Salt-Waters. Snakes, and other
Serpents, haue Venomous Teeth; which are sometimes mistaken for their
Sting.</p>
<p>No Beast that hath Hornes, hath Vpper Teeth; And no Beast, that hath
Teeth aboue, wanteth them below: But yet if they be of the same kinde,
it followeth not, that if the Hard Matter goeth not into Vpper Teeth, it
will goe into Hornes; Not yet — conuerse; For Doe’s, that haue no
Hornes, haue no Vpper Teeth.</p>
<p>Horses haue, at three yeares old, a Tooth put forth, which they call
the Colts Tooth; And at foure yeares old there commeth the Mark-Tooth,
which hath a Hole, as big as you may lay a Pease within it; And that
weareth shorter and shorter, euery yeare; Till that at eight yeares old,
the Tooth is smooth, and the Hole gone; And then they say; That the
Marke is out of the Horses Mouth.</p>
<p>The Teeth of Men breed first, when the Childe is about a yeare and
halfe old: And then they cast them, and new come about seuen yeares old.
But diuers haue Backward-Teeth come forth at Twenty, yea some at Thirty,
and Forty. Quare of the manner of the Comming of them forth. They tell a
Tale of the old Countesse of Desmond, who liued till she was seuen-score
yeares old, that she did Dentire, twice, or thrice; Casting her old
Teeth, and others Comming in their Place.</p>
<p>Teeth are much hurt by Sweet-Meats; And by Painting with Mercury; And
by Things Ouer-hot; And by Things Ouer-cold; And by Rheumes. And the
Paine of the Teeth, is one of the sharpest of Paines.</p>
<p>Concerning Teeth, those Things are to be Considered. 1. The
Preseruing of them. 2. The Keeping of them White. 3. The Drawing of them
with Least Paine. 4. The Staying and Easing of the Tooth-ach. 5. The
Binding in of Artificiall Teeth, where haue beene strucken out. 6. And
last of all, that Great One, of Restoring Teeth in Age. The Instances
that giue any likelihood of Restoring Teeth in Age, are; The Late
Comming of Teeth in some; And the Renewing of the Beakes in Birds, which
are Commateriall with Teeth. Quare therefore more particularly how that
commeth. And againe, the Renewing of Hornes. But yet that hath not beene
knowne to haue beene prouoked by Art; Therfore let Triall be made,
whether Hornes may be procured to grow in Beasts that are not Horned,
and how? And whether they may be procured to come Larger than vsuall; As
to make an Oxe, or a Deere, haue a Greater Head of Hornes? And whether
the Head of a Deere, that by Age is more Spitted, may be brought againe
to be more Branched; For those Trialls, and the like, will shew, whether
by Art such Hard Matter can be called, and prouoked. It may be tryed
also, whether Birds may not haue some thing done to them, when they are
Young, wherby they may be made to haue Greater, or Longer Bills; Or
Greater and Longer Tallons? And whether Children may not haue some Wash,
or Something to make their Teeth Better, and Stronger? Corall is in vse
as an Helpe to the Teeth of Children.</p>
<p>Some Liuing Creatures generate but at certaine Seasons of the Yeare;
As Deere, Sheepe, Wilde Conneyes, andandandandc. And most Sorts of
Birds, and Fishes: Others at any time of the Yeare, as Men; And all
Domesticke Creatures; As Horses, Hogges, Dogges, Cats, andandandandc.
The Cause of Generation at all Seasons seemeth to be Fulnesse: For
Generation is from Redundance. This Fulnesse ariseth from two Causes;
Either from the Nature of the Creature, if it be Hot, and Moist, and
Sanguine; Or from Plenty of Food. For the first, Men, Horses, Dogges,
andandandandc. which breed at all Seasons, are full of Heat, and
Moisture; Dones are the fullest of Heat and Moisture amongst Birds, and
therefore breed often; The Tame Doue almost continually. But Deere are a
Melancholy Dry Creature, as appeareth by their Fearefulnesse, and the
Hardnesse of their Flesh. Sheepe are a Cold Creature, as appeareth by
their Mildnesse, and for that they seldome Drinke. Most sort of Birds
are of a dry Substance in comparison of Beasts, Fishes are cold. For the
second Cause, Fulnesse of Food; Men, Kine, Swine, Dogs, andandandandc.
seed full; And we see that those Creatures, which being Wilde, generate
seldome, being Tame, generate often; Which is from Warmth, and Fulnesse
of Food. We finde, that the Time of Going to Rut of Deore is in
September; For that they need the whole Summers Feed and Grasse, to make
them fit for Generation. And if Raine come Earely about the Middle of
September, they goe to Rut somewhat the sooner; If Drought, somewhat the
later. So Sheepe, in respect of their small Neat. generate about the
same time, or somewhat before. But for the most part, Creatures that
generate at certaine Seasons, generate in the Spring; As Birds, and
Fishes; For that the End of the Winter, and the Heat, and Comfort of the
Spring prepareth them. There is also another Reason, why some Creatures
generate at certaine Seasons: And that is the Relation of their Time of
Bearing, to the time of Generation: For no Creature goeth to generate,
whilest the Female is full; Nor whilest shee is busie in Sitting or
Rearing her Young. And therefore it is found by Experience, that if you
take the Egges, or Young Ones, out of the Neasts of Birds, they will
fall to generate againe, three or foure times, one after another.</p>
<p>Of Liuing Creatures, some are Longer time in the Wombe, and some
Shorter. Women goe commonly nine Moneths; The Cow and the Ewe about six
Moneths; Doe’s goe about nine Moneths; Mares eleuen Moneths; Bitches
nine Weekes; Elephants are said to goe two Yeares; For the Receiued
Tradition of ten Yeares is Fabulous. For Birds there is double Enquiry;
The Distance betweene the Treading or Coupling, and the Laying of the
Egge; And againe betweene the Egge Layed, and the Disclosing or
Hetching. And amongst Birds, there is lesse Diuersity of Time, than
amongst other Creatures; yet some there is: For the Hen sitteth but
three Weekes; The Turky-Hen, Goose, and Ducke, a Moneth: Quare of
others. The Cause of the great Difference of Times, amongst Liuing
Creatures, is, Either from the Nature of the Kinde; Or from the
Constitution of the Wombe. For the former, those that are longer in
Comming to their Maturity or Growth, are longer in the Wombe; As is
chiefly seene in Men; And so Elephants which are long in the Wombe, are
long time in Comming to their full Growth. But in most other Kindes, the
Constitution of the Wombe, (that is, the Hardnesse or Drinesse thereof,)
is concurrent with the former Cause. For the — lt hath about foure
yeares of Growth; And so the Fawne; And so the Calfe. But Whelps, which
come to their Growth (commonly) within three Quarters of a yeare, are
but nine Weekes in the Wombe. As for Birds, as there is lesse Diuersity,
amongst them, in the time of their Bringing forth; So there is lesse
Diuersity in the time of their Growth; Most of them comming to their
Growth within a Twelue-Moneth.</p>
<p>Some Creatures bring forth many Young Ones at a Burthen; As Bitches,
Hares, Conneyes, andandandandc. Some (ordinatily) but One; As Women,
Lionesses, andandandandc. This may be caused, either by the Quantity of
Sperme required to the Producing One of that Kinde; which if lesse be
required, may admit greater Number; If more, fewer: Or by the Partitions
and Cells of the Wombe, which may feuer the Sperme.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, but Light by Refraction will shew greater, as well
as Things Coloured. For like as a Shilling, in the Bottomes of the
Water. will shew greater; So will a Candle in a Lanthorne, in the
Bottome of the Water. I haue heard of a Practise, that Glo-wormes in
Glasses were put in the Water, to make the Fish come. But I am not yet
informed, whether when a Diuer Diueth, hauing his Eyes open, and
swimmeth vpon his Backe; whether (I say) he seeth Things in the Aire
greater, or lesse. For it is manifest, that when the Eye standeth in the
Finer Medium, and the Obiect is in the Grosser, things shew greater; But
contrariwise, when the Eye is placed in the Grosser Medium, and the
Obiect in the Finer, how it worketh I know not.</p>
<p>It would be well boulted out, whether great Refractions may not be
made vpon Reflexions, as well as vpon Direct Beames. For Example, We see
that take an Empty Basen, put an Angell of Gold, or what you will, into
it; Then goe so farre from the Basen, till you cannot see the Angell,
because it is not in a Right Line; Then fill the Basen with Water, and
you shall see it out of his Place, because of the Reflexion. To proceed
therefore, put a Looking-Glasse into a Basen of Water; I suppose you
shall not see the Image in a Right Line, or at equall Angles, but aside.
I know not, whether this Experiment may not be extended so, as you might
see the Image, and not the Glasse; Which for Beauty, and Strangenesse,
were a fine Proofe: For then you should see the Image like a Spirit in
the Aire. As for Example, If there be a Cesterne or Poole of Water. you
shall place ouer against it a Picture of the Deuill, or what you will,
so as you doe not see the Water. Then put a Looking-Glasse in the Water:
Now if you can see the Deuills Picture aside, not seeing the Water, it
will looke like a Deuill indeed. They haue an old Tale in Oxford, that
Friar Bacon walked betweene two Steeples: Which was thought to be done
by Glasses, when he walked vpon the Ground.</p>
<p>A Weighty Body put into Motion, is more easily impelled, than at
first when it Resteth. The Cause is, Partly because Motion doth discusse
the Torpour of Solide Bodies, Which beside their Motion of Grauity, haue
in them a Naturall Appetite, not to moue at all; And partly, because a
Body that resteth, doth get, by the Resistance of the Body vpon which it
resteth, a stronger Compression of Parts, than it hath of it Selfe: And
therefore needeth more Force to be put in Motion. For if a Weighty Body
be Pensile, and hang but by a Thred, the Percussion will make an
Impulsion very neare as easily, as if it were already in Motion.</p>
<p>A Body Ouer-great, or Ouer-small, will not be throwne so farre, as a
Body of a Middle Sixe: So that (it seemeth) there must be a
Commensuration, or Proportion, betweene the Body Moued, and the Force,
to make it moue well. The Cause is, because to the Impulsion, there is
requisite the Force of the Body that Moueth, and the Resistance of the
Body that is Moued: And if the Body be too great, it yeeldeth too
little; And if it be too small, it resisteth too little.</p>
<p>It is Common Experience, that no Weight will presse or cut so strong,
being laid vpon a Body, as Falling, or strucken from aboue. It may be
the Aire hath some part in furthering the Percussion: But the chiefe
Cause I take to be, for that the Parts of the Body Moued, haue by
Impulsion, or by the Motion of Grauity continued, a Compression in them,
as well downwards, as they haue when they are throwne, or Shot thorow
the Aire, forwards. I conceiue also, that the quicke Loose of that
Motion, preuenteth the Resistance of the Body below; And Priority of the
Force, (alwaies,) is of great Efficacy; As appeareth in infinite
Instances.</p>
<p>Tickling is most in the Soles of the Feet, and vnder the Arme-Holes,
and on the Sides. The Cause is, the Thinnesse of the Skin in those
Parts; Ioyned with the Rarenesse of being touched there. For all
Tickling is a light Motion of the Spirits, which the Thinnesse of the
Skin, and Suddennesse, and Rarenesse of Touch, doe further: For we see,
a Feather, or a Rush, drawne along the Lip. or Cheeke, doth tickle;
Whereas a Thing more Obtuse, or a Touch more Hard, doth not. And for
Suddennesse; We see no Man can tickle himselfe: Wee see also, that the
Palme of the Hand, though it hath as Thinne a Skin as the other Parts
Mentioned, yet is not Ticklish, because it is accustomed to be Touched.
Tickling also causeth Laughter. The Cause may be, the Emission of the
Spirits, and so of the Breath, by a Flight from Titillation; For vpon
Tickling, we see there is euer a Starting, or Shrinking away of the
Part, to auoid it; And we see also, that if you Tickle the Nosthrills,
with a Feather, or Straw, it procureth Sneezing; Which is a Sudden
Emission of the Spirits, that doe likewise expell the Moisture. And
Tickling is euer Painfull, and not well endured.</p>
<p>It is strange, that the Riuer of Nilus, Ouer-flowing, as it doth, the
Country of AEgypt, there should be neuerthelesse little or no Raine in
that Country. The Cause must be, Either in the Nature of the Water; Or
in the Nature of the Aire; Or of Both. In the Water, it may be ascribed,
either vnto the Long — of the Water: For Swift Running Waters vapour,
not so much as Standing Waters; Or else to the Concoction of the Water;
For Waters well Concocted vapour not so much, as Waters Raw; No more
than Waters vpon the Fire doe vapour so much, after some time of
Boyling, as at the first. And it is true, that the Water of Nilus is
sweeter than other Waters in Taste; And it is excellent Good for the
Stone, and Hypochondriacall Melancholy; Which sheweth it is Lenefying:
And it runneth thorow a Countrey of a Hot Climate, and flat, without
Shade, either of Woods, or Hills; Whereby the Sunne must needs haue
great Power to Concoct it. As for the Aire, (from whence I conceiue this
Want of Showers commeth chiefly;) The Cause must be, for that the Aire
is, of it selfe, Thin and Thirsty; And as soone as euer it getteth any
Moisture from the Water, it imbibeth, and dissipateth it, in the whole
body of the Aire; And suffereth it not to remaine in Vapour; Whereby it
might breed Raine.</p>
<p>It hath beene touched in the Title of Percolations, (Namely such as
are Inwards,) that the Whites of Eggs, and Milke, doe clarifie; And it
is certaine, that in AEgypt, they prepare and clarifie the Water of
Nile, by putting it into great Iarres of Stone, and Stirring it about
with a few Stamped Almonds; Wherewith they also besmeare the Mouth of
the Vessell; And so draw it off, after it hath rested some time. It were
good, to trie this Clarifying with Almonds, in New Beere, or Must, to
hasten, and perfect the Clarifying.</p>
<p>There be scarce to be found any Vegetables, that haue Branches, and
no Leaues; except you allow Corall for one. But there is also in the
Desarts of S. Macario in AEgypt, a Plant which is Long, Leauelesse,
Browne of Colour, and Branched like Corall, faue that it closeth at the
Top. This being set in Water within House, spreadeth and displayeth
strangely; And the People thereabouts haue a Superstitious Beleefe, that
in the Labour of Women, it helpeth to the Easie Deliuerance.</p>
<p>The Crystalline Venice Glasse, is reported to be a Mixture, in equall
Portions, of Stones, brought from Pauia, by the Riuer Ticinum; And the
Ashes of a Weed called by the Arabs Kall, which is gathered in a Desart
betweene Alexandria and Rosetta; And is by the AEgyptians vsed first for
Fuell; And then they crush the Ashes into Lumps, like a Stone; And so
sell them to the Venetians for their Glasse-workes.</p>
<p>It is strange, and well to be noted, how long Carkasses haue
continued Vncorrupt, and in their former Dimensions; As appeareth in the
Mummies of AEgypt; Hauing lafted, as is conceiued, (some of them,) three
thousand yeeres. It is true, they finde Meanes to draw forth the
Braines, and to take forth the Entrailes, which are the Parts apteft to
corrupt. But that is nothing to the Wonder: For wee see, what a Soft and
Corruptible Substance the Flesh, of all the other Parts of the Body, is.
But it should seeme, that according to our Obseruation, and Axiorne, in
our hundredth Experiment, Putrefaction, which we conceiue to be so
Naturall a Period of Bodies, is but an Accident; And that Matter maketh
not that Haste to Corruption, that is conceiued. And therefore Bodies,
in Shining-Amber; In Quicke-Siluer; In Balmes, (whereof wee now speake;)
In Wax; In Honey; In Gummes; And (it may be) in Conseruatories of Snow;
andandandandc. are preserued very long. It need not goe for Repetition,
if we resume againe that which wee said in the aforesaid Experiment,
concerning Annihilation; Namely, that if you prouide against three
Causes of Putrefaction, Bodies will not corrupt: The First is, that the
Aire be excluded; For that vndermineth the Body, and conspireth with the
Spirit of the Body to dissolue it. The Second is, that the Body Adiacent
and Ambiens be not Commateriall, but meerely Heterogeneall towards the
Body that is to be presured: For if Nothing can be receiued by the One,
Nothing can issue from the Other, Such are Quick-Siluer, andandandand
White-Amber, to Herbs, and Flies, and such Bodies. The Third is, that
the Body to be preserued, be not of that Grasse, that it may corrupt
within it selfe, although no Part of it issue into the Body Adiacent:
And therefore it must be rather Thinne, and Small, than of Bulke. There
is a Fourth Remedie also, which is; That if the Body to be preserued be
of Bulke, as a Corps is, then the Body that Incloseth it, must haue a
Vertue to draw forth, and drie the Moisture of the Inward Body; For else
the Putrefaction will play within, though Nothing issue forth. I
remember Liuy doth relate, that there were found, at a time, two Coffins
of Lead, in a Tombe; Whereof the one contained the Body of King Numa; It
being some foure hundred yeares after his Death: And the other, his
Bookes of Sacred Rites and Ceremonies, and the Discipline of the
Pontises; And that in the Coffin that had the Body, there was Nothing
(at all) to be seene, but a little light Cinders about the Sides; But in
the Coffin that had the Bookes, they were found as fresh, as if they had
beene but newly Written; being written in Parchment, and couered ouer
with Watch-Candles of Wax, three or foure fold. By this it seemeth, that
the Romans. in Numa’s time, were not so good Embalmers, as the
AEgyptians were; Which was the Cause that the Body was vtterly consumed.
But I finde in Plutarch, and Others, that when Augustus Caesar visited
the Sepulchre of Alexander, the Great, in Alexandria, he found the Body
to keepe his Dimension; But withall, that, notwithstanding all the
Embalming, (which no doubt was of the best,) the Body was so Tender, as
Caesar touching but the Nose of it, defaced it. Which maketh mee finde
it very strange, that the Egyptian Mummies should be reported to be as
Hard as Stone-Pitch: For I finde no difference but one; Which indeed may
be very Materiall; Namely, that the Ancient AEgyptian Mummies, were
shrowded in a Number of Folds of Linnen, besmeared with Gums, in manner
of Seare-Cloth; Which it doth not appeare was practised vpon the Body of
Alexander.</p>
<p>Neare the Castle of Catie, and by the Wells of Assan, in the Land of
Idumea, a great Part of the Way, you would thinke the Sea were neare
hand, though it be a good distance off: And it is Nothing, but the
Shining of the Nitre, vpon the Sea-Sands; Such Abundance of Nitre the
Shores there doe put forth.</p>
<p>The Dead-Sea, which vomiteth vp Bitumen, is of that Crassitude, as
Liuing Bodies bound Hand and Foot, cast into it, haue beene borne vp and
not sunke. Which sheweth, that all Sinking into Water, is but an
Ouer-Weight of the Body, put into the Water, in respect of the Water: So
that you may make Water so strong, and heauy, of Quicke-Siluer,
(perhaps,) or the like, as may beare vp Iron: Of which I see no Vse, but
Imposture. Wee see also, that all Metalls, except Gold, for the same
reason swimme vpon Quicke-Siluer.</p>
<p>It is reported, that at the Feet of a Hill, neare the More mortuum,
there is a Blacke Stone, (whereof Pilgrims make Fires,) which burneth
like a Coale, and diminisheth not; But only waxeth Brighter, and Whiter.
That it should doe so, is not strange; For wee see Iron Red Hot burneth,
and consumeth not: But the Strangenesse is, that it should continue any
time so: For Iron, as soone as it is out of the Fire, deadeth straight
waies. Certainly, it were a Thing of great Vse, and Profit, if you could
finde out Fuell, that would burne Hot, and yet last long, Neither am I
altogether Incredulous, but there may be such Candles, as they say are
made of Salamanders Wooll; Being a Kinde of Minerall, which whiteneth
also in the Burning, and consumeth not. The Question is this; Flame must
be made of somewhat; And commonly it is made of some Tangible Body,
which hath Weight: But it is not impossible, perhaps, that it should be
made of Spirit, or Vapour, in a Body; (which Spirit on Vapour hath no
Weight;) such as is the Matter of Ignis —— s. But then you will say,
that that Vapour also can last but a short time: To that it may be
answered, That by the helpe of Oile, and Wax, and other Candle-Stuffe,
the Flame may continue, and the Wieke not burne.</p>
<p>Sea-Coale last longer than Char-Coale; And Char-Coale of Roots, being
coaled into great Peeces, last longer than Ordinary Char-Coale, Turfe,
and Peat, and Cow-Sheards, are cheape Fuels, and last long.Small-Coale,
or Briar-Coale, powred vpon Char-Coale, make them last longer. Sedge is
a cheape Fuell to Brew, or Bake with; the rather because it is good for
Nothing else. Triall would be made of some Mixture of Sea-Coale with
Earth, or Chalko; For if that Mixture be, as the Sea-Coale-Men vse it,
priuily, to make the Bulke of the Coale greater, it is Deceit; But if it
be vsed purposely, and be made knowne, it is Sauing.</p>
<p>It is, at this Day, in vse, in G —— to couch Pat-Sheards or Vessels
of Earth, in their Walls, to gather the Wind from the Top; and to passe
it downe in Spouts into Roomes. It is a Deuice for Freshnesse, in great
Heats: And it is said, there are some Roomes in Italie, and Spaine, for
Freshnesse, and Gathering the Winds, and Aire, in the Heats of Summer.
But they be but Pennings of the Winds, and Enlarging them againe, and
Making them Reuerberate, and goe round in Circles, rather than this
Deuice of Spouts in the Wall.</p>
<p>There would be vsed much diligence, in the Choice of some Bodies, and
Places, (as it were,) for the Testing of Aire; to discouer the
Wholesomenesse or Vnwholesomenesse, as well of Seasons, as of the Seats
of Dwellings. It is certaine, that there be some Heuses, wherein
Confitures, and Pies, will gather Mould, more than in Others. And I am
perswaded, that a Peece of Raw Flesh, or Fish, will sooner corrupt in
some Aires, than in Others. They be noble Experiments, that can make
this Discouerie; For they serue for a Naturall Diuination of Seasons;
Better than the Astronomer can by their Figures: And againe, they teach
Men where to chuse their Dwelling, for their better Health.</p>
<p>There is a Kinde of Stone, about Bethles-, which they grinde to
Powder, and put into Water, whereof Cattell drinke; Which maketh them
giue more Milke. Surely, there would be some better Trialls made of
Mixtures of Water in Ponds for Cattell, to make them more Milch; Or to
Fatten them; Or to Keepe them from Murraine, It may be, Chalke, and
Nitre, are of the best.</p>
<p>It is reported, that in the Valley, neare the Mountaine Carmel, in
Iudea, there is a Sand, which, of all other, hath most Affinitie with
Glasse; Insomuch as other Mineralls, laid in it, turne to a Glassie
Substance, without the Fire; And againe Glasse put into it, turneth into
the Mother-Sand. The Thing is very strange, if it be true: And it is
likeliest to be Caused by some Naturall Fornace, or Heat in the Earth:
And yet they doe not speake of any Eruption of Flames. It were good to
trie in Glasse-Workes, whether the Crude Materialls of Glasse, mingled
with Glasse, already made, and Re-moulten, doe not facilitate the Making
of Glasse with lesse Heat.</p>
<p>In the Sea, vpon the South-West of Sicilie, much Corall is found. It
is a Sub-Marine Plan. It hath no Leanes: It brancheth only when it is
vnder Water; It is Soft, and Greene of Colour; But being brought into
the Aire, it becommeth Hard, and Shining Red, as wee see. It is said
also, to haue a White Berry; But wee finde it not brought ouer with the
Corall. Belike it is cast away as nothing worth: Inquire better of it,
for the Difcouerie of the Nature of the Plant.</p>
<p>The Manns of Calabria is the best, and in most Plenty. They gather it
from the Leafe of the Mulberry Tree; But not of such Mulberry Trees, as
grow in the Valley’s. And Manns falleth vpon the Leaues by Night, as
other Deawes doe. It should seeme, that before those Deawes come vpon
Trees in the Valley’s, they dissipate, and cannot hold out. It should
seeme also, the Mulberry-Leafe, it selfe, hath some Coagulating Vertue,
which inspissateth the Deaw, for that it is not found vpon other Trees:
And wee see by the Silke-Worme, which feedeth vpon that Leafe, what’s
Dainty Smooth Iuyce it hath; And the Leaues also, (especially of the
Blacke Mulberry,) are somewhat Bristly, which may helpe to preserue the
Deaw. Certainly, it were not amisse, to obscrue a little better, the
Deawes that fall vpon Trees, or Herbs, Growing on Mountaines; For, it
may be, many Deawes fall, that spend before they come to the Valleys.
And I suppose, that he that would gather the best May-Deaw for Medicine,
should gather it from the Hills.</p>
<p>It is said, they haue a manner, to prepare their Greeke-Wines, to
keepe them from Fuming, and Inebriating, by adding some Sulphur, or
Allome: Whereof the one is Vnctnous, and the other is Astringent. And
certaine it is, that those two Natures doe best represse Fumes. This
Experiment would be transferred, vnto other Wine, and Strong Beere, by
Putting in some like Substances, while they worke; Which may make them
both to Fume lesse, and to Inflame lesse.</p>
<p>It is conceiued by some, (not improbably,) that the reason, why
Wilde-Fires, (Whereof the principall Ingredient is Bitumen,) doe not
quench with Water, is, for that the first Concretion of Bitumen is a
Mixture, of a Fiery, and Watry Substance: So is not Sulphur. This
appeareth, for that in the Place neare Puteoli, which they call the
Court of Valcan, you shall heare, vnder the Earth, a Horrible Thundring
of Fire, and Water, conflicting together: And there breake forth also
Spouts of Boyling Water. Now that Place yeeldeth great Quantities of
Bitumen; Whereas AEtna, and Vesuuius, and the like, which consist vpon
Sulphur, shoot forth Smoake, and Ashes, and Pumice, but no Water. It is
reported also, that Bitumen Mingled with Lime, and Put vnder Water, will
make, as it were, an Artificiall Rocke; The Substance becommeth so
Hard.</p>
<p>There is a Cement, compounded of Floure, Whites of Egges, and Stone
powdred, that becommeth Hard as Marble; wherewith Piscina mirabilis,
neare Cuma, is said to haue the Walls Plastered. And it is certaine, and
tried, that the Powder of Load-Stone, and Flint, by the Addition of
Whites of Egges, and Gumm-Dragon, made into Paste, will in a few dayes
harden to the Hardnesse of a Stone.</p>
<p>It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that in Full or Impure Bodies,
Vlcers or Hurts in the Leggs, are Hard to Cure; And in the Head more
Easie. The Cause is, for that Vlcers or Hurts in the Leggs require
Deficcation, which by the Defluxion of Humours to the Lower Parts is
hindred; Whereas Hurts and Vlcers in the Head require it not; But
contrariwise Drinesse maketh them more apt to Consolidate. And in
Moderne Obseruation, the like difference hath beene found, betweene
French-Men, and English-Men; Where of the ones Constitution is more Dry,
and the others more Moist. And therefore a Hurt of the Head is harder to
cure in a French-Man, and of the Legge in an English-Man.</p>
<p>It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that Southerne Winds, blowing
much, without Raine, doe cause a Feuourous Disposition of the Yeare; But
with Raine, not. The Cause is, for that Southerne Winds doe, of
themselues, qualifie the Aire, to be apt to cause Feuers; But when
Showers are ioyned, they doe Refrigerate in Part, and Checke the Sultry
Heat of the Southerne Wind. Therefore this holdeth not in the
Sea-Coasts, because the Vapour of the Sea, without Showers, doth
refresh.</p>
<p>It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that Wounds which are made with
Brasse, heale more easily, than Wounds made with Iron. The Cause is, for
that Brasse hath, in it selfe, a Sanatiue Vertue; And so in the very
Instant helpeth somewhat: But Iron is Corrosiue, and not Sanatiue. And
therefore it were good, that the Instruments which are vsed by
Chirurgians about Wounds, were rather of Brasse, than Iron.</p>
<p>In the Cold Countries, when Mens Noses, and Eares are Mortified, and
(as it were) Gangrened with Cold, if they come to a Fire, they rot off
presently. The Cause is, for that the few Spirits, that remaine in those
Parts, are suddenly drawne forth, and so Putrefaction is made Compleat.
But Snow Put vpon them, helpeth; For that it preserueth those Spirits
that remaine, till they can reuiue; And besides, Snow hath in it a
Secret Warmth: As the Monke proued out of the Text; Qui dat Niuem sicut
Lanam, Gelu sicut Cineres spargit. Whereby he did inferre, that Snow did
warme like Wooll, and Frost did fret like Ashes. Warme Water also doth
good, Because by little and little it openeth the Pores, without any
sudden Working vpon the Spirits. This Experiment may be transferred vnto
the Cure of Gangrenes, either Comming of themselues, or induced by too
much Applying of Opiates: Wherein you must beware of Dry Heat, and
resort to Things that are Refrigerant, with an Inward Warmth, and Vertue
of Cherishing.</p>
<p>Weigh Iron, and Aqua Fortis, seuerally; Then dissolue the Iron in the
Aqua Fortis: And weigh the Dissolution; And you shall finde it to beare
as good Weight, as the Bodies did seuerally: Notwithstanding a good
deale of Wast, by a thicke Vapour, that issueth during the Working:
Which sheweth, that the Opening of a Body, doth increase the Weight.
This was tried once, or twice, but I know not, whether there were any
Errour, in the Triall.</p>
<p>Take of Aqua-Fortis two Ounces, of Quick-siluer two Drachmes; (For
that Charge the Aqua-Fortis will beare;) The Dissolution will not beare
a Flint, as big as a Nutmeg: Yet (no doubt) the Increasing of the Weight
of Water, will increase his Power of Bearing: As we see Broine, when it
is Salt enough, will beare an Egge. And I remember well a Physitian,
that vsed to giue some Minerall Baths for the Gout. andandandandc. And
the Body when it was put into the Bath, could not get downe so easily,
as in Ordinary Water. But it seemeth, the Weight of the Quick-siluer,
more than the Weight of a Stone; doth not compense the Weight of a
Stone, more than the Weight of the Aqua-Fortis.</p>
<p>Let there be a Body of Vnequall Weight; (As of Wood and Lead, or Bone
and Lead;) If you throw it from you with the Light-End forward it will
turne, and the Weightier End will recouer to be Forwards; Vnlesse the
Body be Ouer-long. The Cause is, for that the more Dense Body, hath a
more Violent Pressure of the Parts, from the first Impulsion; Which is
the Cause, (though heretofore not found out, as hath been often said,)
of all Violent Motions: And when the Hinder Part moueth swifter, (for
that it lesse endureth Pressure of Parts,) than the Forward Part can
make way for it, it must needs be, that the Body turne ouer: For
(turned) it can more easily draw forward the Lighter Part. Ga — laeus
noteth it well; That if an Open Trough, wherein Water is, be driuen
faster than the Water can follow, the Water gathereth vpon an heape,
towards the Hinder End, where the Motion began; Which he supposeth,
(holding confidently the Motion of the Earth,) to be the Cause of the
Ebbing and Flowing of the Ocean; Because the Earth ouer-runneth the
Water. Which Theory, though it be false, yet the first Experiment is
true. As for the Inequality of the Pressure of Parts, it appeareth
manifestly in this; That if you take a Body of Stone, or Iron, and
another of Wood, of the same Magnitude, and Shape, and throw them with
equall Force, you cannot possibly throw the Wood, so farre, as the
Stone, or Iron.</p>
<p>It is certaine, (as it hath beene formerly, in part, touched,) that
Water may be the Medium of Sounds. If you dash a Stone against a Stone
in the Bottome of the Water, it maketh a Sound. So a long Pole strucke
vpon Grauell, in the Bottome of the Water, maketh a Sound. Nay, if you
should thinke that the Sound commeth vp by the Pole, and not by the
Water, you shall finde that an Anchor, let downe by a Roape, maketh a
Sound; And yet the Roape is no Solide Body, whereby the Sound can
ascend.</p>
<p>All Obiects of the Senses, which are very Offensiue, doe cause the
Spirits to retire; And vpon their Flight, the Parts are (in some degree)
destitute; And so there is induced in them a Trepidation and Horrour.
For Sounds, we see that the Grating of a Saw, or any very Harsh Noise,
will set the Teeth on edge, and make all the Body Shiuer. For Tastes, we
see that in the Taking of a Potion, or Pills, the Head, and the Necke
shake. For Odious Smells, the like Effect followeth, which is lesse
perceiued, because there is a Remedy at hand, by Stopping of the Nose:
But in Horses, that can vse no such Help, we see the Smell of a Carrion,
especially of a Dead Horse, maketh them fly away, and take on, almost as
if they were Mad. For Feeling, if you come out of the Sunne, suddenly,
into a Shade, there followeth a Chilnesse or Shiuering in all the Body.
And euen in Sight, which hath (in effect) no Odious Obiect, Comming into
Sudden Darknesse, induceth an Offer to Shiuer.</p>
<p>There is, in the City of Ticinum, in Italy, a Church, that hath
Windownes onely from aboue: It is in Length an Hundred Feet, in Breadth
Twenty Feet, and in Height neare Fifty; Hauing a Doore in the Middest.
It reporteth the Voice, twelue or thirteene times, if you stand by the
Close End-Wall, ouer against the Doore. The Eccho fadeth, and dyeth by
little and little, as the Eccho at Pont-charenton doth. And the Voice
soundeth, as if it came from aboue the Doore. And if you stand at the
Lower End, or on either Side of the Doore, the Eccho holdeth; But if you
stand in the Doore, or in the Middest iust ouer against the Doore, not.
Note that all Eccho’s sound better against Old Walls, than New; Because
they are more Dry, and Hollow.</p>
<p>Those Effects, which are wrought by the Percussion of the Sense, and
by Things in Fact, are produced likewise, in some degree, by the
Imagination. Therefore if a Man see another eat Soure or Acide Things,
which set the Teeth on edge, this Obiect tainteth the Imagination. So
that hee that seeth the Thing done by another, hath his owne Teeth also
set on edge. So if a Man see another turne swiftly, and long; Or if he
looke vpon Wheeles that turne, Himselfe waxeth Turne-sicke. So if a Man
be vpon an High Place, without Railes, or good Hold, except he be vsed
to it, he is Ready to Fall: For Imagining a Fall, it putteth his Spirits
into the very Action of a Fall. So Many vpon the Seeing of others Bleed,
or Strangled, or Tortured, Themselues are ready to faint, as if they
Bled, or were in Strife.</p>
<p>Take a Stocke-Gilly-Flower, and tye it gently vpon a Sticke, and put
them both into a Stoope Glasse, full of Quick-siluer, so that the Flower
be couered: Then lay a little Weight vpon the Top of the Glasse, that
may keepe the Sticke downe; And looke vpon them after foure or fiue
daies; And you shall finde the Flower Fresh, and the Stalke Harder, and
lesse Flexible, than it was. If you compare it with another Flower,
gathered at the same time, it will be the more manifest. This sheweth,
that Bodies doe preserue excellently in Quick-siluer; And not preserue
only, but, by the Coldnesse of the Quick-siluer, Indurate; For the
Freshnesse of the Flower may be meerely Conseruation; (which is the more
to be obserued because the Quick-Siluer presseth the Flower;) But the
Stiffenesse of the Stalke, cannot be without Induration, from the Cold
(as it seemeth,) of the Quick-siluer.</p>
<p>It is reported by some of the Ancients, that in Cyprus, there is a
Kinde of Iron, that being cut into Little Peeces, and put into the
Ground, if it be well Watred, will increase into Greater Peeces. This is
certaine, and knowne of Old; That Lead will multiply, and Increase; As
hath beene seene in Old Statua’s of Stone, which haue beene put in
Cellars; The Feet of them being bound with Leaden Bands; Where (after a
time,) there appeared, that the Lead did swell; Insomuch as it hanged
vpon the Stone like Warts.</p>
<p>I call Drowning of Metalls, when that the Baser Metall, is so
incorporate with the more Rich, as it can by no Meanes be separated
againe: which is a kinde of Version, though False: As if Siluer should
be inseparably incorporated with Gold; Or Copper, and Lead, with Siluer.
The Ancient Electrum had in it a Fifth of Siluer to the Gold; And made a
Compound Metall, as fit for most vses, as Gold; And more Resplendent,
and more Qualified in some other Properties; But then that was easily
Separated. This to doe priuily, or to make the Compound passe for the
Rich Metall Simple, is an Adulteration, or Counterfeiting: But if it be
done Auowedly, and without Disguizing, it may be a great Sauing of the
Richer Metall. I remember to haue heard of a Man, skilfull in Metalls,
that a Fifteenth Part of Siluer, incorporate with Gold, will not be
Recouered by any Water of Separation; Except you put a Greater Quantity
of Siluer, to draw to it the Lesse; which (he said) is the last Refuge
in Separations. But that is a tedious way, which no Man (almost) will
thinke on. This would be better enquired; And the Quantity of the
Fifteenth turned to a Twentieth; And likewise with some little
Additionall, that may further the Intrinsique Incorporation. Note that
Siluer in Gold will be detected by Weight, compared with the Dimension;
But Lead in Silver, (Lead being the Weightier Metall,) will not be
detected; If you take so much the more Siluer, as will counteruaile the
Ouer-Weight of the Lead.</p>
<p>Gold is the onely Substance, which hath nothing in it Volatile, and
yet melteth without much difficulty. The Melting sheweth that it is not
Ieiune, or Scarce in Spirit. So that the Fixing of it, is not Want of
Spirit to fly out, but the Equall Spreading of the Tangible Parts, and
the Close Coaceruation of them: Whereby they haue the lesse Appetite,
and no Meanes (at all) to issue forth. It were good therefore to try,
whether Glasse Re-moulten doe leese any Weight? For the Parts in Glasse
are euenly Spred; But they are not so Close as in Gold; As we see by the
Easie Admission of Light, Heat, and Cold; And by the Smalnesse of the
Weight. There be other Bodies, Fixed, which haue little, or no Spirit:
So as there is nothing to fly out; As wee see in the Stuffe, whereof
Coppells are made; Which they put into Furnaces; Vpon which Fire worketh
not: So that there are three Causes of Fixation; The Euen Spreading both
of the Spirits, and Tangible Parts; The Closenesse of the Tangible
Parts; And the Ieiunenesse or Extreme Comminution of Spirits: Of which
Three, the Two First may be ioyned with a Nature Liquefiable; The Last
not.</p>
<p>It is Profound Contemplation in Nature, to consider of the
Emptinesse, (as we may call it,) or Insatisfaction of seuerall Bodies;
And of their Appetite to take in Others.Aire taketh in Lights, and
Sounds, and Smells, and Vapours; And it is most manifest, that it doth
it, with a kinde of Thirst, as not satisfied with his owne former
Consistence; For else it would neuer receiue them in so suddenly, and
easily. Water, and all Liquours, doe hastily receiue Dry and more
Terrestriall Bodies, Proportionable: And Dry Bodies, on the other side,
drinke in Waters, and Liquours: So that, (as it was well said, by one of
the Ancients, of Earthy and Watry Substances,) One is a Glue to another.
Parchment, Skins, Cloth, andandandandc. drinke in Liquours, though
themselues be Entire Bodies, and not Comminuted, as Sand, and Ashes; Nor
apparently Porous: Metalls themselues doe receiue in readily
Strong-Waters; And Strong-Waters likewise doe readily pierce into
Metalls, and Stones: And that Strong-Water will touch vpon Gold, that
will not touch vpon Siluer; And è conuerso. And Gold, which seemeth by
the Weight, to be the Closest, and most Solide Body, doth greedily
drinke in Quick-Siluer. And it seemeth, that this Reception of other
Bodies, is not Violent: For it is (many times) Reciprocall, and as it
were with Consent. Of the Cause of this, and to what Axiome it may be
referred, consider attentiuely; For as for the Pretty Assertion, that
Matter is like a Common Strumpet, that desireth all Formes, it is but a
Wandring Notion. Onely Flame doth not content it selfe to take in any
other Body; But either, to ouercome and turne another Body into it
Selfe, as by Victory; Or it Selfe to dye, and goe out,</p>
