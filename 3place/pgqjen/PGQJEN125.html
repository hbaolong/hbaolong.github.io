<h4 id="the-plan-of-the-great-instauration">The Plan of the Great
Instauration</h4>
<p>The Instauration includes six Parts:</p>
<p>The Divisions of the Sciences</p>
<p>The New Organon; or Directions concerning the Interpretation of
Nature</p>
<p>The Phenomena of the Universe; or a Natural and Experimental History
for the Foundation of Philosophy</p>
<p>The Ladder of the Intellect</p>
<p>The Forerunners; or Anticipations of the New Philosophy</p>
<p>The New Philosophy; or Active Science</p>
<p>The Arguments of the Several Parts</p>
<p>It being part of my design to set everything forth, as far as may be,
plainly and perspicuously (for nakedness of the mind is still, as
nakedness of the body once was, the companion of innocence and
simplicity), let me first explain the order and plan of the work. I
distribute it into six parts.</p>
<p>The first part exhibits a summary or general description of the
knowledge which the human race at present possesses. For I thought it
good to make some pause upon that which is received; that thereby the
old may be more easily made perfect and the new more easily approached.
And I hold the improvement of that which we have to be as much an object
as the acquisition of more. Besides which it will make me the better
listened to; for “He that is ignorant (says the proverb) receives not
the words of knowledge, unless thou first tell him that which is in his
own heart.” We will therefore make a coasting voyage along the shores of
the arts and sciences received, not without importing into them some
useful things by the way.</p>
<p>In laying out the divisions of the sciences, however, I take into
account not only things already invented and known, but likewise things
omitted which ought to be there. For there are found in the intellectual
as in the terrestrial globe waste regions as well as cultivated ones. It
is no wonder, therefore, if I am sometimes obliged to depart from the
ordinary divisions. For in adding to the total you necessarily alter the
parts and sections; and the received divisions of the sciences are
fitted only to the received sum of them as it stands now.</p>
<p>With regard to those things which I shall mark as omitted, I intend
not merely to set down a simple title or a concise argument of that
which is wanted. For as often as I have occasion to report anything as
deficient, the nature of which is at all obscure, so that men may not
perhaps easily understand what I mean or what the work is which I have
in my head, I shall always (provided it be a matter of any worth) take
care to subjoin either directions for the execution of such work, or
else a portion of the work itself executed by myself as a sample of the
whole, thus giving assistance in every case either by work or by
counsel. For if it were for the sake of my own reputation only and other
men’s interests were not concerned in it, I would not have any man think
that in such cases merely some light and vague notion has crossed my
mind, and that the things which I desire and attempt are no better than
wishes, when they are in fact things which men may certainly command if
they will, and of which I have formed in my own mind a clear and
detailed conception. For I do not propose merely to survey these regions
in my mind, like an augur taking auspices, but to enter them like a
general who means to take possession. So much for the first part of the
work.</p>
<p>Having thus coasted past the ancient arts, the next point is to equip
the intellect for passing beyond. To the second part, therefore, belongs
the doctrine concerning the better and more perfect use of human reason
in the inquisition of things, and the true helps of the understanding,
that thereby (as far as the condition of mortality and humanity allows)
the intellect may be raised and exalted, and made capable of overcoming
the difficulties and obscurities of nature. The art which I introduce
with this view (which I call “Interpretation of Nature”) is a kind of
logic, though the difference between it and the ordinary logic is great,
indeed, immense. For the ordinary logic professes to contrive and
prepare helps and guards for the understanding, as mine does; and in
this one point they agree. But mine differs from it in three points
especially — viz., in the end aimed at, in the order of demonstration,
and in the starting point of the inquiry.</p>
<p>For the end which this science of mine proposes is the invention not
of arguments but of arts; not of things in accordance with principles,
but of principles themselves; not of probable reasons, but of
designations and directions for works. And as the intention is
different, so, accordingly, is the effect; the effect of the one being
to overcome an opponent in argument, of the other to command nature in
action.</p>
<p>In accordance with this end is also the nature and order of the
demonstrations. For in the ordinary logic almost all the work is spent
about the syllogism. Of induction, the logicians seem hardly to have
taken any serious thought, but they pass it by with a slight notice and
hasten on to the formulae of disputation. I, on the contrary, reject
demonstration by syllogism as acting too confusedly and letting nature
slip out of its hands. For although no one can doubt that things which
agree in a middle term agree with one another (which is a proposition of
mathematical certainty), yet it leaves an opening for deception, which
is this: the syllogism consists of propositions — propositions of words;
and words are the tokens and signs of notions. Now if the very notions
of the mind (which are as the soul of words and the basis of the whole
structure) be improperly and overhastily abstracted from facts, vague,
not sufficiently definite, faulty — in short, in many ways, the whole
edifice tumbles. I therefore reject the syllogism, and that not only as
regards principles (for to principles the logicians themselves do not
apply it) but also as regards middle propositions, which, though
obtainable no doubt by the syllogism, are, when so obtained, barren of
works, remote from practice, and altogether unavailable for the active
department of the sciences. Although, therefore, I leave to the
syllogism and these famous and boasted modes of demonstration their
jurisdiction over popular arts and such as are matter of opinion (in
which department I leave all as it is), yet in dealing with the nature
of things I use induction throughout, and that in the minor propositions
as well as the major. For I consider induction to be that form of
demonstration which upholds the sense, and closes with nature, and comes
to the very brink of operation, if it does not actually deal with
it.</p>
<p>Hence it follows that the order of demonstration is likewise
inverted. For hitherto the proceeding has been to fly at once from the
sense and particulars up to the most general propositions, as certain
fixed poles for the argument to turn upon, and from these to derive the
rest by middle terms — a short way, no doubt, but precipitate and one
which will never lead to nature, though it offers an easy and ready way
to disputation. Now my plan is to proceed regularly and gradually from
one axiom to another, so that the most general are not reached till the
last; but then, when you do come to them, you find them to be not empty
notions but well defined, and such as nature would really recognize as
her first principles, and such as lie at the heart and marrow of
things.</p>
<p>But the greatest change I introduce is in the form itself of
induction and the judgment made thereby. For the induction of which the
logicians speak, which proceeds by simple enumeration, is a puerile
thing, concludes at hazard, is always liable to be upset by a
contradictory instance, takes into account only what is known and
ordinary, and leads to no result.</p>
<p>Now what the sciences stand in need of is a form of induction which
shall analyze experience and take it to pieces, and by a due process of
exclusion and rejection lead to an inevitable conclusion. And if that
ordinary mode of judgment practiced by the logicians was so laborious,
and found exercise for such great wits, how much more labor must we be
prepared to bestow upon this other, which is extracted not merely out of
the depths of the mind, but out of the very bowels of nature.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. For I also sink the foundations of the sciences
deeper and firmer; and I begin the inquiry nearer the source than men
have done heretofore, submitting to examination those things which the
common logic takes on trust. For first, the logicians borrow the
principles of each science from the science itself; secondly, they hold
in reverence the first notions of the mind; and lastly, they receive as
conclusive the immediate informations of the sense, when well disposed.
Now upon the first point, I hold that true logic ought to enter the
several provinces of science armed with a higher authority than belongs
to the principles of those sciences themselves, and ought to call those
putative principles to account until they are fully established. Then
with regard to the first notions of the intellect, there is not one of
the impressions taken by the intellect when left to go its own way, but
I hold it as suspect and no way established until it has submitted to a
new trial and a fresh judgment has been thereupon pronounced. And
lastly, the information of the sense itself I sift and examine in many
ways. For certain it is that the senses deceive; but then at the same
time they supply the means of discovering their own errors; only the
errors are here, the means of discovery are to seek.</p>
<p>The sense fails in two ways. Sometimes it gives no information,
sometimes it gives false information. For first, there are very many
things which escape the sense, even when best disposed and no way
obstructed, by reason either of the subtlety of the whole body or the
minuteness of the parts, or distance of place, or slowness or else
swiftness of motion, or familiarity of the object, or other causes. And
again when the sense does apprehend a thing its apprehension is not much
to be relied upon. For the testimony and information of the sense has
reference always to man, not to the universe; and it is a great error to
assert that the sense is the measure of things.</p>
<p>To meet these difficulties, I have sought on all sides diligently and
faithfully to provide helps for the sense — substitutes to supply its
failures, rectifications to correct its errors; and this I endeavor to
accomplish not so much by instruments as by experiments. For the
subtlety of experiments is far greater than that of the sense itself,
even when assisted by exquisite instruments — such experiments, I mean,
as are skillfully and artificially devised for the express purpose of
determining the point in question. To the immediate and proper
perception of the sense, therefore, I do not give much weight; but I
contrive that the office of the sense shall be only to judge of the
experiment, and that the experiment itself shall judge of the thing. And
thus I conceive that I perform the office of a true priest of the sense
(from which all knowledge in nature must be sought, unless men mean to
go mad) and a not unskillful interpreter of its oracles; and that while
others only profess to uphold and cultivate the sense, I do so in fact.
Such then are the provisions I make for finding the genuine light of
nature and kindling and bringing it to bear. And they would be
sufficient of themselves if the human intellect were even and like a
fair sheet of paper with no writing on it. But since the minds of men
are strangely possessed and beset so that there is no true and even
surface left to reflect the genuine rays of things, it is necessary to
seek a remedy for this also.</p>
<p>Now the idols, or phantoms, by which the mind is occupied are either
adventitious or innate. The adventitious come into the mind from without
— namely, either from the doctrines and sects of philosophers or from
perverse rules of demonstration. But the innate are inherent in the very
nature of the intellect, which is far more prone to error than the sense
is. For let men please themselves as they will in admiring and almost
adoring the human mind, this is certain: that as an uneven mirror
distorts the rays of objects according to its own figure and section, so
the mind, when it receives impressions of objects through the sense,
cannot be trusted to report them truly, but in forming its notions mixes
up its own nature with the nature of things.</p>
<p>And as the first two kinds of idols are hard to eradicate, so idols
of this last kind cannot be eradicated at all. All that can be done is
to point them out, so that this insidious action of the mind may be
marked and reproved (else as fast as old errors are destroyed new ones
will spring up out of the ill complexion of the mind itself, and so we
shall have but a change of errors, and not a clearance); and to lay it
down once for all as a fixed and established maxim that the intellect is
not qualified to judge except by means of induction, and induction in
its legitimate form. This doctrine, then, of the expurgation of the
intellect to qualify it for dealing with truth is comprised in three
refutations: the refutation of the philosophies; the refutation of the
demonstrations; and the refutation of the natural human reason. The
explanation of which things, and of the true relation between the nature
of things and the nature of the mind, is as the strewing and decoration
of the bridal chamber of the mind and the universe, the divine goodness
assisting, out of which marriage let us hope (and be this the prayer of
the bridal song) there may spring helps to man, and a line and race of
inventions that may in some degree subdue and overcome the necessities
and miseries of humanity. This is the second part of the work.</p>
<p>But I design not only to indicate and mark out the ways, but also to
enter them. And therefore the third part of the work embraces the
“phenomena of the universe”; that is to say, experience of every kind,
and such a natural history as may serve for a foundation to build
philosophy upon. For a good method of demonstration or form of
interpreting nature may keep the mind from going astray or stumbling,
but it is not any excellence of method that can supply it with the
material of knowledge. Those, however, who aspire not to guess and
divine, but to discover and know, who propose not to devise mimic and
fabulous worlds of their own, but to examine and dissect the nature of
this very world itself, must go to facts themselves for everything. Nor
can the place of this labor and search and world-wide perambulation be
supplied by any genius or meditation or argumentation; no, not if all
men’s wits could meet in one. This, therefore, we must have or the
business must be forever abandoned. But up to this day such has been the
condition of men in this matter that it is no wonder if nature will not
give herself into their hands.</p>
<p>For first, the information of the sense itself, sometimes failing,
sometimes false; observation, careless, irregular, and led by chance;
tradition, vain, and fed on rumor; practice, slavishly bent upon its
work; experiment, blind, stupid, vague, and prematurely broken off;
lastly, natural history trivial and poor — all these have contributed to
supply the understanding with very bad materials for philosophy and the
sciences.</p>
<p>Then an attempt is made to mend the matter by a preposterous subtlety
and winnowing of argument. But this comes too late, the case being
already past remedy, and is far from setting the business right or
sifting away the errors. The only hope, therefore, of any greater
increase or progress lies in a reconstruction of the sciences.</p>
<p>Of this reconstruction the foundation must be laid in natural
history, and that of a new kind and gathered on a new principle. For it
is in vain that you polish the mirror if there are no images to be
reflected; and it is as necessary that the intellect should be supplied
with fit matter to work upon, as with safeguards to guide its working.
But my history differs from that in use (as my logic does) in many
things — in end and office, in mass and composition, in subtlety, in
selection also, and setting forth, with a view to the operations which
are to follow.</p>
<p>For first, the object of the natural history which I propose is not
so much to delight with variety of matter or to help with present use of
experiments, as to give light to the discovery of causes and supply a
suckling philosophy with its first food. For though it be true that I am
principally in pursuit of works and the active department of the
sciences, yet I wait for harvest-time and do not attempt to mow the moss
or to reap the green corn. For I well know that axioms once rightly
discovered will carry whole troops of works along with them, and produce
them, not here and there one, but in clusters. And that unseasonable and
puerile hurry to snatch by way of earnest at the first works which come
within reach, I utterly condemn and reject as an Atalanta’s apple that
hinders the race. Such then is the office of this natural history of
mine.</p>
<p>Next, with regard to the mass and composition of it: I mean it to be
a history not only of nature free and at large (when she is left to her
own course and does her work her own way) — such as that of the heavenly
bodies, meteors, earth and sea, minerals, plants, animals — but much
more of nature under constraint and vexed; that is to say, when by art
and the hand of man she is forced out of her natural state, and squeezed
and moulded. Therefore I set down at length all experiments of the
mechanical arts, of the operative part of the liberal arts, of the many
crafts which have not yet grown into arts properly so called, so far as
I have been able to examine them and as they conduce to the end in view.
Nay (to say the plain truth), I do in fact (low and vulgar as men may
think it) count more upon this part both for helps and safeguards than
upon the other, seeing that the nature of things betrays itself more
readily under the vexations of art than in its natural freedom.</p>
<p>Nor do I confine the history to bodies, but I have thought it my duty
besides to make a separate history of such virtues as may be considered
cardinal in nature. I mean those original passions or desires of matter
which constitute the primary elements of nature; such as dense and rare,
hot and cold, solid and fluid, heavy and light, and several others.</p>
<p>Then again, to speak of subtlety: I seek out and get together a kind
of experiments much subtler and simpler than those which occur
accidentally. For I drag into light many things which no one who was not
proceeding by a regular and certain way to the discovery of causes would
have thought of inquiring after, being indeed in themselves of no great
use; which shows that they were not sought for on their own account, but
having just the same relation to things and works which the letters of
the alphabet have to speech and words — which, though in themselves
useless, are the elements of which all discourse is made up.</p>
<p>Further, in the selection of the relation and experiments I conceive
I have been a more cautious purveyor than those who have hitherto dealt
with natural history. For I admit nothing but on the faith of eyes, or
at least of careful and severe examination, so that nothing is
exaggerated for wonder’s sake, but what I state is sound and without
mixture of fables or vanity. All received or current falsehoods also
(which by strange negligence have been allowed for many ages to prevail
and become established) I proscribe and brand by name, that the sciences
may be no more troubled with them. For it has been well observed that
the fables and superstitions and follies which nurses instill into
children do serious injury to their minds; and the same consideration
makes me anxious, having the management of the childhood, as it were, of
philosophy in its course of natural history, not to let it accustom
itself in the beginning to any vanity. Moreover, whenever I come to a
new experiment of any subtlety (though it be in my own opinion certain
and approved), I nevertheless subjoin a clear account of the manner in
which I made it, that men, knowing exactly how each point was made out,
may see whether there be any error connected with it and may arouse
themselves to devise proofs more trustworthy and exquisite, if such can
be found; and finally, I interpose everywhere admonitions and scruples
and cautions, with a religious care to eject, repress, and, as it were,
exorcise every kind of phantasm.</p>
<p>Lastly, knowing how much the sight of man’s mind is distracted by
experience and history, and how hard it is at the first (especially for
minds either tender or preoccupied) to become familiar with nature, I
not unfrequently subjoin observations of my own, being as the first
offers inclinations, and, as it were, glances of history toward
philosophy, both by way of an assurance to men that they will not be
kept forever tossing on the waves of experience, and also that when the
time comes for the intellect to begin its work, it may find everything
the more ready. By such a natural history, then, as I have described, I
conceive that a safe and convenient approach may be made to nature, and
matter supplied of good quality and well prepared for the understanding
to work upon.</p>
<p>And now that we have surrounded the intellect with faithful helps and
guards, and got together with most careful selection a regular army of
divine works, it may seem that we have no more to do but to proceed to
philosophy itself. And yet in a matter so difficult and doubtful there
are still some things which it seems necessary to premise, partly for
convenience of explanation, partly for present use.</p>
<p>Of these the first is to set forth examples of inquiry and invention
according to my method, exhibited by anticipation in some particular
subjects; choosing such subjects as are at once the most noble in
themselves among those under inquiry, and most different one from
another, that there may be an example in every kind. I do not speak of
those examples which are joined to the several precepts and rules by way
of illustration (for of these I have given plenty in the second part of
the work); but I mean actual types and models, by which the entire
process of the mind and the whole fabric and order of invention from the
beginning to the end, in certain subjects, and those various and
remarkable, should be set, as it were, before the eyes. For I remember
that in the mathematics it is easy to follow the demonstration when you
have a machine beside you, whereas without that help all appears
involved and more subtle than it really is. To examples of this kind —
being in fact nothing more than an application of the second part in
detail and at large — the fourth part of the work is devoted.</p>
<p>The fifth part is for temporary use only, pending the completion of
the rest, like interest payable from time to time until the principal be
forthcoming. For I do not make so blindly for the end of my journey as
to neglect anything useful that may turn up by the way. And therefore I
include in this part such things as I have myself discovered, proved, or
added — not, however, according to the true rules and methods of
interpretation, but by the ordinary use of the understanding in
inquiring and discovering. For besides that I hope my speculations may,
in virtue of my continual conversancy with nature, have a value beyond
the pretensions of my wit, they will serve in the meantime for wayside
inns, in which the mind may rest and refresh itself on its journey to
more certain conclusions. Nevertheless I wish it to be understood in the
meantime that they are conclusions by which (as not being discovered and
proved by the true form of interpretation) I do not at all mean to bind
myself. Nor need any one be alarmed at such suspension of judgment in
one who maintains not simply that nothing can be known, but only that
nothing can be known except in a certain course and way; and yet
establishes provisionally certain degrees of assurance for use and
relief until the mind shall arrive at a knowledge of causes in which it
can rest. For even those schools of philosophy which held the absolute
impossibility of knowing anything were not inferior to those which took
upon them to pronounce. But then they did not provide helps for the
sense and understanding, as I have done, but simply took away all their
authority; which is quite a different thing — almost the reverse.</p>
<p>The sixth part of my work (to which the rest is subservient and
ministrant) discloses and sets forth that philosophy which by the
legitimate, chaste, and severe course of inquiry which I have explained
and provided is at length developed and established. The completion,
however, of this last part is a thing both above my strength and beyond
my hopes. I have made a beginning of the work — a beginning, as I hope,
not unimportant: the fortune of the human race will give the issue, such
an issue, it may be, as in the present condition of things and men’s
minds cannot easily be conceived or imagined. For the matter in hand is
no mere felicity of speculation, but the real business and fortunes of
the human race, and all power of operation. For man is but the servant
and interpreter of nature: what he does and what he knows is only what
he has observed of nature’s order in fact or in thought; beyond this he
knows nothing and can do nothing. For the chain of causes cannot by any
force be loosed or broken, nor can nature be commanded except by being
obeyed. And so those twin objects, human knowledge and human power, do
really meet in one; and it is from ignorance of causes that operation
fails.</p>
<p>And all depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of
nature and so receiving their images simply as they are. For God forbid
that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of
the world; rather may he graciously grant to us to write an apocalypse
or true vision of the footsteps of the Creator imprinted on his
creatures.</p>
<p>Therefore do thou, O Father, who gavest the visible light as the
first fruits of creation, and didst breathe into the face of man the
intellectual light as the crown and consummation thereof, guard and
protect this work, which coming from thy goodness returneth to thy
glory. Thou when thou turnedst to look upon the works which thy hands
had made, sawest that all was very good, and didst rest from thy labors.
But man, when he turned to look upon the work which his hands had made,
saw that all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and could find no rest
therein. Wherefore if we labor in thy works with the sweat of our brows,
thou wilt make us partakers of thy vision and thy sabbath. Humbly we
pray that this mind may be steadfast in us, and that through these our
hands, and the hands of others to whom thou shall give the same spirit,
thou wilt vouchsafe to endow the human family with new mercies.</p>
