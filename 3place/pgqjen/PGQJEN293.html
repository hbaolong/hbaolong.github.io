<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the fifth place
Constitutive Instances, which I also call Manipular. They are those
which constitute a single species of the proposed nature, a sort of
Lesser Form. For since the genuine forms (which are always convertible
with the proposed natures) lie deep and are hard to find, it is required
by the circumstances of the case and the infirmity of the human
understanding that particular forms, which collect together certain
groups of instances (though not all) into some common notion, be not
neglected, but rather be diligently observed. For whatever unites
nature, though imperfectly, paves the way to the discovery of forms.
Instances, therefore, which are useful in this regard are of no
despicable power, but have a certain prerogative.</p>
<p>But great caution must here be employed lest the human understanding,
after having discovered many of those particular forms and thereupon
established partitions or divisions of the nature in question, be
content to rest therein, and instead of proceeding to the legitimate
discovery of the great form, take it for granted that the nature from
its very roots is manifold and divided, and so reject and put aside any
further union of the nature, as a thing of superfluous subtlety and
verging on mere abstraction.</p>
<p>For example, let the proposed nature be memory, or that which excites
and aids the memory. Constitutive instances are: order or distribution,
which clearly aids the memory; also topics or “places” in artificial
memory; which may either be places in the proper sense of the word, as a
door, angle, window, and the like; or familiar and known persons; or any
other things at pleasure (provided they be placed in a certain order),
as animals, vegetables; words, too, letters, characters, historical
persons, and the like; although some of these are more suitable and
convenient than others. Such artificial places help the memory
wonderfully, and exalt it far above its natural powers. Again, verse is
learned and remembered more easily than prose. From this group of three
instances, viz., order, artificial places, and verse, one species of aid
to the memory is constituted. And this species may with propriety be
called the cutting off of infinity. For when we try to recollect or call
a thing to mind, if we have no prenotion or perception of what we are
seeking, we seek and toil and wander here and there, as if in infinite
space. Whereas, if we have any sure prenotion, infinity is at once cut
off, and the memory has not so far to range. Now in the three foregoing
instances the prenotion is clear and certain. In the first it must be
something which suits the order; in the second it must be an image which
bears some relation or conformity to the places fixed; in the third, it
must be words that fall into the verse; and thus infinity is cut off.
Other instances, again, will give us this second species: that whatever
brings the intellectual conception into contact with the sense (which is
indeed the method most used in mnemonics) assists the memory. Other
instances will give us this third species: that things which make their
impression by way of a strong affection, as by inspiring fear,
admiration, shame, delight, assist the memory. Other instances will give
us this fourth species: that things which are chiefly imprinted when the
mind is clear and not occupied with anything else either before or
after, as what is learned in childhood, or what we think of before going
to sleep, also things that happen for the first time, dwell longest in
the memory. Other instances will give us this fifth species: that a
multitude of circumstances or points to take hold of aids the memory; as
writing with breaks and divisions, reading or reciting aloud. Lastly,
other instances will give us this sixth species: that things which are
waited for and raise the attention dwell longer in the memory than what
flies quickly by. Thus, if you read anything over twenty times, you will
not learn it by heart so easily as if you were to read it only ten,
trying to repeat it between whiles, and when memory failed, looking at
the book. It appears, then, that there are six lesser forms of aids to
the memory; viz.: the cutting off of infinity; the reduction of the
intellectual to the sensible; impression made on the mind in a state of
strong emotion; impression made on the mind disengaged; multitude of
points to take hold of; expectation beforehand.</p>
<p>To take another example, let the proposed nature be taste or tasting.
The following instances are Constitutive. Persons who are by nature
without the sense of smell cannot perceive or distinguish by taste food
that is rancid or putrid, nor food that is seasoned with garlic, or with
roses, or the like. Again, persons whose nostrils are accidentally
obstructed by a catarrh cannot distinguish or perceive anything putrid
or rancid or sprinkled with rosewater. Again, persons thus affected with
catarrh, if while they have something fetid or perfumed in their mouth
or palate they blow their nose violently, immediately perceive the
rancidity or the perfume. These instances, then, will give and
constitute this species, or rather division, of taste: that the sense of
taste is in part nothing else than an internal smell, passing and
descending from the upper passages of the nose to the mouth and palate.
On the other hand the tastes of salt, sweet, sour, acid, rough, bitter,
and the like, are as perceptible to those in whom the sense of smell is
wanting or stopped as to anyone else; so that it is clear that the sense
of taste is a sort of compound of an internal smell and a delicate power
of touch — of which this is not the place to speak.</p>
<p>To take another example, let the proposed nature be the communication
of quality without admixture of substance. The instance of light will
give or constitute one species of communication; heat and the magnet
another. For the communication of light is momentaneous, and ceases at
once on the removal of the original light. But heat and the virtue of
the magnet, after they have been transmitted to or rather excited in a
body, lodge and remain there for a considerable time after the removal
of the source of motion.</p>
<p>Very great, in short, is the prerogative of constitutive instances;
for they are of much use in the forming of definitions (especially
particular definitions) and in the division and partition of natures;
with regard to which it was not ill said by Plato, “That he is to be
held as a god who knows well how to define and to divide.”</p>
