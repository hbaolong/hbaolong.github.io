<h4 id="chapter-vii.">CHAPTER VII.</h4>
<p>BACON’S LAST YEARS.</p>
<p>[1621-1626.]</p>
<p>The tremendous sentences of those days, with their crushing fines,
were often worse in sound than in reality. They meant that for the
moment a man was defeated and disgraced. But it was quite understood
that it did not necessarily follow that they would be enforced in all
their severity. The fine might be remitted, the imprisonment shortened,
the ban of exclusion taken off. At another turn of events or caprice the
man himself might return to favour, and take his place in Parliament or
the Council as if nothing had happened. But, of course, a man might have
powerful enemies, and the sentence might be pressed. His fine might be
assigned to some favourite; and he might be mined, even if in the long
run he was pardoned; or he might remain indefinitely a prisoner. Raleigh
had remained to perish at last in dishonour. Northumberland, Raleigh’s
fellow-prisoner, after fifteen years’ captivity, was released this year.
The year after Bacon’s condemnation such criminals as Lord and Lady
Somerset were released from the Tower, after a six years’ imprisonment.
Southampton, the accomplice of Essex, Suffolk, sentenced as late as 1619
by Bacon for embezzlement, sat in the House of Peers which judged Bacon,
and both of them took a prominent part in judging him.</p>
<p>To Bacon the sentence was ruinous. It proved an irretrievable
overthrow as regards public life, and, though some parts of it were
remitted and others lightened, it plunged his private affairs into
trouble which weighed heavily on him for his few remaining years. To his
deep distress and horror he had to go to the Tower to satisfy the terms
of his sentence. “Good my Lord,” he writes to Buckingham, May 31,
“procure my warrant for my discharge this day. Death is so far from
being unwelcome to me, as I have called for it as far as Christian
resolution would permit any time these two months. But to die before the
time of his Majesty’s grace, in this disgraceful place, is even the
worst that could be.” He was released after two or three days, and he
thanks Buckingham (June 4) for getting him out to do him and the King
faithful service— “wherein, by the grace of God, your Lordship shall
find that my adversity hath neither spent nor pent my spirits.” In the
autumn his fine was remitted — that is, it was assigned to persons
nominated by Bacon, who, as the Crown had the first claim on all his
goods, served as a protection against his other creditors, who were many
and some of them clamorous — and it was followed by his pardon. His
successor, Williams, now Bishop of Lincoln, who stood in great fear of
Parliament, tried to stop the pardon. The assignment of the fine, he
said to Buckingham, was a gross job— “it is much spoken against, not for
the matter (for no man objects to that), but for the manner, which is
full of knavery, and a wicked precedent. For by this assignment he is
protected from all his creditors, which (I dare say) was neither his
Majesty’s nor your Lordship’s meaning.” It was an ill-natured and
cowardly piece of official pedantry to plunge deeper a drowning man; but
in the end the pardon was passed. It does not appear whether Buckingham
interfered to overrule the Lord Keeper’s scruples. Buckingham was
certainly about this time very much out of humour with Bacon, for a
reason which, more than anything else, discloses the deep meanness which
lurked under his show of magnanimity and pride. He had chosen this
moment to ask Bacon for York House. This meant that Bacon would never
more want it. Even Bacon was stung by such a request to a friend in his
condition, and declined to part with it; and Buckingham accordingly was
offended, and made Bacon feel it. Indeed, there is reason to think with
Mr. Spedding that for the sealing of his pardon Bacon was indebted to
the good offices with the King, not of Buckingham, but of the Spaniard,
Gondomar, with whom Bacon had always been on terms of cordiality and
respect, and who at this time certainly “brought about something on his
behalf, which his other friends either had not dared to attempt or had
not been able to obtain.”</p>
<p>But, though Bacon had his pardon, he had not received permission to
come within the verge of the Court, which meant that he could not live
in London. His affairs were in great disorder, his health was bad, and
he was cut off from books. He wrote an appeal to the Peers who had
condemned him, asking them to intercede with the King for the
enlargement of his liberty. “I am old,” he wrote, “weak, ruined, in
want, a very subject of pity.” The Tower at least gave him the
neighbourhood of those who could help him. “There I could have company,
physicians, conference with my creditors and friends about my debts and
the necessities of my estate, helps for my studies and the writings I
have in hand. Here I live upon the sword-point of a sharp air,
endangered if I go abroad, dulled if I stay within, solitary and
comfortless, without company, banished from all opportunities to treat
with any to do myself good, and to help out my wrecks.” If the Lords
would recommend his suit to the King, “You shall do a work of charity
and nobility, you shall do me good, you shall do my creditors good, and
it may be you shall do posterity good, if out of the carcase of dead and
rotten greatness (as out of Samson’s lion) there may be honey gathered
for the use of future times.” But Parliament was dissolved before the
touching appeal reached them; and Bacon had to have recourse to other
expedients. He consulted Selden about the technical legality of the
sentence. He appealed to Buckingham, who vouchsafed to appear more
placable. Once more he had recourse to Gondomar, “in that solitude of
friends, which is the base-court of adversity,” as a man whom he had
“observed to have the magnanimity of his own nation and the cordiality
of ours, and I am sure the wit of both” — and who had been equally kind
to him in “both his fortunes;” and he proposed through Gondomar to
present Gorhambury to Buckingham “for nothing,” as a peace-offering. But
the purchase of his liberty was to come in another way. Bacon had
reconciled himself to giving up York House; but now Buckingham would not
have it: he had found another house, he said, which suited him as well.
That is to say, he did not now choose to have York House from Bacon
himself; but he meant to have it. Accordingly, Buckingham let Bacon know
through a friend of Bacon’s, Sir Edward Sackville, that the price of his
liberty to live in London was the cession of York House — not to
Buckingham, but of all men in the world, to Lionel Cranfield, the man
who had been so bitter against Bacon in the House of Commons. This is
Sir Edward Sackville’s account to Bacon of his talk with Buckingham; it
is characteristic of every one concerned:</p>
<p>“In the forenoon he laid the law, but in the afternoon he preached
the gospel; when, after some revivations of the old distaste concerning
York House, he most nobly opened his heart unto me; wherein I read that
which augured much good towards you. After which revelation the book was
again sealed up, and must in his own time only by himself be again
manifested unto you. I have leave to remember some of the vision, and am
not forbidden to write it. He vowed (not court like), but constantly to
appear your friend so much, as if his Majesty should abandon the care of
you, you should share his fortune with him. He pleased to tell me how
much he had been beholden to you, how well he loved you, how unkindly he
took the denial of your house (for so he will needs understand it); but
the close for all this was harmonious, since he protested he would
seriously begin to study your ends, now that the world should see he had
no ends on you. He is in hand with the work, and therefore will by no
means accept of your offer, though I can assure you the tender hath much
won upon him, and mellowed his heart towards you, and your genius
directed you aright when you writ that letter of denial to the Duke. The
King saw it, and all the rest, which made him say unto the Marquis, you
played an after-game well; and that now he had no reason to be much
offended.</p>
<p>“I have already talked of the Revelation, and now am to speak in
apocalyptical language, which I hope you will rightly comment: whereof
if you make difficulty, the bearer can help you with the key of the
cypher.</p>
<p>“My Lord Falkland by this time hath showed you London from Highgate.
If York House were gone, the town were yours, and all your straitest
shackles clean off, besides more comfort than the city air only. The
Marquis would be exceeding glad the Treasurer had it. This I know; yet
this you must not know from me. Bargain with him presently, upon as good
conditions as you can procure, so you have direct motion from the
Marquis to let him have it. Seem not to dive into the secret of it,
though you are purblind if you see not through it. I have told
Mr. Meautys how I would wish your Lordship now to make an end of it.
From him I beseech you take it, and from me only the advice to perform
it. If you part not speedily with it, you may defer the good which is
approaching near you, and disappointing other aims (which must either
shortly receive content or never), perhaps anew yield matter of
discontent, though you may be indeed as innocent as before. Make the
Treasurer believe that since the Marquis will by no means accept of it,
and that you must part with it, you are more willing to pleasure him
than anybody else, because you are given to understand my Lord Marquis
so inclines; which inclination, if the Treasurer shortly send unto you
about it, desire may be more clearly manifested than as yet it hath
been; since as I remember none hitherto hath told you in terminis
terminantibus that the Marquis desires you should gratify the Treasurer.
I know that way the hare runs, and that my Lord Marquis longs until
Cranfield hath it; and so I wish too, for your good; yet would not it
were absolutely passed until my Lord Marquis did send or write unto you
to let him have it; for then his so disposing of it were but the next
degree removed from the immediate acceptance of it, and your Lordship
freed from doing it otherwise than to please him, and to comply with his
own will and way.”</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that when Cranfield got it, it soon passed
into Buckingham’s hands. “Bacon consented to part with his house, and
Buckingham in return consented to give him his liberty.” Yet Bacon could
write to him, “low as I am, I had rather sojourn in a college in
Cambridge than recover a good fortune by any other but yourself.” “As
for York House,” he bids Toby Matthews to let Buckingham know, “that
whether in a straight line or a compass line, I meant it for his
Lordship, in the way which I thought might please him best.” But liberty
did not mean either money or recovered honour. All his life long he had
made light of being in debt; but since his fall this was no longer a
condition easy to bear. He had to beg some kind of pension of the King.
He had to beg of Buckingham; “a small matter for my debts would do me
more good now than double a twelvemonth hence. I have lost six thousand
by the year, besides caps and courtesies. Two things I may assure your
Lordship. The one, that I shall lead such a course of life as whatsoever
the King doth for me shall rather sort to his Majesty’s and your
Lordship’s honour than to envy; the other, that whatsoever men talk, I
can play the good husband, and the King’s bounty shall not be lost.”</p>
<p>It might be supposed from the tone of these applications that Bacon’s
mind was bowed down and crushed by the extremity of his misfortune.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. In his behaviour during his
accusation there was little trace of that high spirit and fortitude
shown by far inferior men under like disasters. But the moment the
tremendous strain of his misfortunes was taken off, the vigour of his
mind recovered itself. The buoyancy of his hopefulness, the elasticity
of his energy, are as remarkable as his profound depression. When the
end was approaching, his thoughts turned at once to other work to be
done, ready in plan, ready to be taken up and finished. At the close of
his last desperate letter to the King he cannot resist finishing at once
with a jest, and with the prospect of two great literary undertakings
—</p>
<p>“This is my last suit which I shall make to your Majesty in this
business, prostrating myself at your mercy seat, after fifteen years
service, wherein I have served your Majesty in my poor endeavours with
an entire heart, and, as I presumed to say unto your Majesty, am still a
virgin for matters that concern your person and crown; and now only
craving that after eight steps of honour I be not precipitated
altogether. But because he that hath taken bribes is apt to give bribes,
I will go furder, and present your Majesty with a bribe. For if your
Majesty will give me peace and leisure, and God give me life, I will
present your Majesty with a good history of England, and a better digest
of your laws.”</p>
<p>The Tower did, indeed, to use a word of the time, “mate” him. But the
moment he was out of it, his quick and fertile mind was immediately at
work in all directions, reaching after all kinds of plans, making proof
of all kinds of expedients to retrieve the past, arranging all kinds of
work according as events might point out the way. His projects for
history, for law, for philosophy, for letters, occupy quite as much of
his thoughts as his pardon and his debts; and they, we have seen,
occupied a good deal. If he was pusillanimous in the moment of the
storm, his spirit, his force, his varied interests, returned the moment
the storm was past. His self-reliance, which was boundless, revived. He
never allowed himself to think, however men of his own time might judge
him, that the future world would mistake him. “Aliquis fui inter vivos,”
he writes to Gondomar, “neque omnino intermoriar apud posteros.” Even in
his time he did not give up the hope of being restored to honour and
power. He compared himself to Demosthenes, to Cicero, to Seneca, to
Marcus Livius, who had been condemned for corrupt dealings as he had
been, and had all recovered favour and position. Lookers-on were puzzled
and shocked. “He has,” writes Chamberlain, “no manner of feeling of his
fall, but continuing vain and idle in all his humours as when he was at
the highest.” “I am said,” Bacon himself writes, “to have a feather in
my head.”</p>
<p>Men were mistaken. His thoughts were, for the moment, more than ever
turned to the future; but he had not given up hope of having a good deal
to say yet to the affairs of the present. Strangely enough, as it seems
to us, in the very summer after that fatal spring of 1621 the King
called for his opinion concerning the reformation of Courts of Justice;
and Bacon, just sentenced for corruption and still unpardoned, proceeds
to give his advice as if he were a Privy Councillor in confidential
employment. Early in the following year he, according to his fashion,
surveyed his position, and drew up a paper of memoranda, like the notes
of the Commentarius Solutus of 1608, about points to be urged to the
King at an interview. Why should not the King employ him again? “Your
Majesty never chid me;” and as to his condemnation, “as the fault was
not against your Majesty, so my fall was not your act.” “Therefore,” he
goes on, “if your Majesty do at any time find it fit for your affairs to
employ me publicly upon the stage, I shall so live and spend my time as
neither discontinuance shall disable me nor adversity shall discourage
me, nor anything that I do give any new scandal or envy upon me.” He
insists very strongly that the King’s service never miscarried in his
hands, for he simply carried out the King’s wise counsels. “That his
Majesty’s business never miscarried in my hands I do not impute to any
extraordinary ability in myself, but to my freedom from any particular,
either friends or ends, and my careful receipt of his directions, being,
as I have formerly said to him, but as a bucket and cistern to that
fountain — a bucket to draw forth, a cistern to preserve.” He is not
afraid of the apparent slight to the censure passed on him by
Parliament. “For envy, it is an almanack of the old year, and as a
friend of mine said, Parliament died penitent towards me.” “What the
King bestows on me will be further seen than on Paul’s steeple.” “There
be mountebanks, as well in the civil body as in the natural; I ever
served his Majesty with modesty; no shouting, no undertaking.” In the
odd fashion of the time — a fashion in which no one more delighted than
himself — he lays hold of sacred words to give point to his
argument.</p>
<p>“I may allude to the three petitions of the Litany — Libera nos
Domine; parce nobis, Domine; exaudi nos, Domine. In the first, I am
persuaded that his Majesty had a mind to do it, and could not
conveniently in respect of his affairs. In the second, he hath done it
in my fine and pardon. In the third, he hath likewise performed, in
restoring to the light of his countenance.”</p>
<p>But if the King did not see fit to restore him to public employment,
he would be ready to give private counsel; and he would apply himself to
any “literary province” that the King appointed. “I am like ground
fresh. If I be left to myself I will graze and bear natural philosophy;
but if the King will plough me up again, and sow me with anything, I
hope to give him some yield.” “Your Majesty hath power; I have faith.
Therefore a miracle may be wrought.” And he proposes, for matters in
which his pen might be useful, first, as “active” works, the recompiling
of laws; the disposing of wards, and generally the education of youth;
the regulation of the jurisdiction of Courts; and the regulation of
Trade; and for “contemplative,” the continuation of the history of Henry
VIII.; a general treatise de Legibus et Justitia; and the “Holy War”
against the Ottomans.</p>
<p>When he wrote this he had already shown what his unquelled energy
could accomplish. In the summer and autumn after his condemnation, amid
all the worries and inconveniences of that time, moving about from place
to place, without his books, and without free access to papers and
records, he had written his History of Henry VII. The theme had, no
doubt, been long in his head. But the book was the first attempt at
philosophical history in the language, and it at once takes rank with
all that the world had yet seen, in classical times and more recently in
Italy, of such history. He sent the book, among other persons, to the
Queen of Bohemia, with a phrase, the translation of a trite Latin
commonplace, which may have been the parent of one which became famous
in our time; and with an expression of absolute confidence in the
goodness of his own work.</p>
<p>“I have read in books that it is accounted a great bliss for a man to
have Leisure with Honour. That was never my fortune. For time was, I had
Honour without Leisure; and now I have Leisure without Honour…. But my
desire is now to have Leisure without Loitering, and not to become an
abbey-lubber, as the old proverb was, but to yield some fruit of my
private life…. If King Henry were alive again, I hope verily he would
not be so angry with me for not flattering him, as well pleased in
seeing himself so truly described in colours that will last and be
believed.”</p>
<p>But the tide had turned against him for good. A few fair words, a few
grudging doles of money to relieve his pressing wants, and those
sometimes intercepted and perhaps never rightly granted from an
Exchequer which even Cranfield’s finance could not keep filled, were all
the graces that descended upon him from those fountains of goodness in
which he professed to trust with such boundless faith. The King did not
want him, perhaps did not trust him, perhaps did not really like him.
When the Novum Organum came out, all that he had to say about it was in
the shape of a profane jest that “it was like the peace of God — it
passed all understanding.” Other men had the ear of Buckingham; shrewd,
practical men of business like Cranfield, who hated Bacon’s loose and
careless ways, or the clever ecclesiastic Williams, whose counsel had
steered Buckingham safely through the tempest that wrecked Bacon, and
who, with no legal training, had been placed in Bacon’s seat. “I
thought,” said Bacon, “that I should have known my successor.” Williams,
for his part, charged Bacon with trying to cheat his creditors, when his
fine was remitted. With no open quarrel, Bacon’s relations to Buckingham
became more ceremonious and guarded; the “My singular good Lord” of the
former letters becomes, now that Buckingham had risen so high and Bacon
had sunk so low, “Excellent Lord.” The one friend to whom Bacon had once
wished to owe everything had become the great man, now only to be
approached with “sweet meats” and elaborate courtesy. But it was no use.
His full pardon Bacon did not get, though earnestly suing for it, that
he might not “die in ignominy.” He never sat again in Parliament. The
Provostship of Eton fell vacant, and Bacon’s hopes were kindled. “It
were a pretty cell for my fortune. The College and School I do not doubt
but I shall make to flourish.” But Buckingham had promised it to some
nameless follower, and by some process of exchange it went to Sir Henry
Wotton. His English history was offered in vain. His digest of the Laws
was offered in vain. In vain he wrote a memorandum on the regulation of
usury; notes of advice to Buckingham; elaborate reports and notes of
speeches about a war with Spain, when that for a while loomed before the
country. In vain he affected an interest which he could hardly have felt
in the Spanish marriage, and the escapade of Buckingham and Prince
Charles, which “began,” he wrote, “like a fable of the poets, but
deserved all in a piece a worthy narration.” In vain, when the Spanish
marriage was off and the French was on, he proposed to offer to
Buckingham “his service to live a summer as upon mine own delight at
Paris, to settle a fast intelligence between France and us;” “I have
somewhat of the French,” he said, “I love birds, as the King doth.”
Public patronage and public employment were at an end for him. His
petitions to the King and Buckingham ceased to be for office, but for
the clearing of his name and for the means of living. It is piteous to
read the earnestness of his requests. “Help me (dear Sovereign lord and
master), pity me so far as that I who have borne a bag be not now in my
age forced in effect to bear a wallet.” The words are from a
carefully-prepared and rhetorical letter which was not sent, but they
express what he added to a letter presenting the De Augmentis; “det
Vestra Majestas obolum Belisario.” Again, “I prostrate myself at your
Majesty’s feet; I your ancient servant, now sixty-four years old in age,
and three years and five months old in misery. I desire not from your
Majesty means, nor place, nor employment, but only after so long a time
of expiation, a complete and total remission of the sentence of the
Upper House, to the end that blot of ignominy may be removed from me,
and from my memory and posterity, that I die not a condemned man, but
may be to your Majesty, as I am to God, nova creatura.” But the pardon
never came. Sir John Bennett, who had been condemned as a corrupt judge
by the same Parliament, and between whose case and Bacon’s there was as
much difference, “I will not say as between black and white, but as
between black and gray,” had got his full pardon, “and they say shall
sit in Parliament.” Lord Suffolk had been one of Bacon’s judges. “I hope
I deserve not to be the only outcast.” But whether the Court did not
care, or whether, as he once suspected, there was some old enemy like
Coke, who “had a tooth against him,” and was watching any favour shown
him, he died without his wish being fulfilled, “to live out of want and
to die out of ignominy.”</p>
<p>Bacon was undoubtedly an impoverished man, and straitened in his
means; but this must be understood as in relation to the rank and
position which he still held, and the work which he wanted done for the
Instauratio. His will, dated a few months before his death, shows that
it would be a mistake to suppose that he was in penury. He no doubt
often wanted ready money, and might be vexed by creditors. But he kept a
large household, and was able to live in comfort at Gray’s Inn or at
Gorhambury. A man who speaks in his will of his “four coach geldings and
his best caroache,” besides many legacies, and who proposes to found two
lectures at the universities, may have troubles about debts and be
cramped in his expenditure, but it is only relatively to his station
that he can be said to be poor. And to subordinate officers of the
Treasury who kept him out of his rights, he could still write a sharp
letter, full of his old force and edge. A few months before his death he
thus wrote to the Lord Treasurer Ley, who probably had made some
difficulty about a claim for money:</p>
<p>“MY LORD, — I humbly entreat your Lordship, and (if I may use the
word) advise your Lordship to make me a better answer. Your Lordship is
interested in honour, in the opinion of all that hear how I am dealt
with. If your Lordship malice me for Long’s cause, surely it was one of
the justest businesses that ever was in Chancery. I will avouch it; and
how deeply I was tempted therein, your Lordship knoweth best. Your
Lordship may do well to think of your grave as I do of mine; and to
beware of hardness of heart. And as for fair words, it is a wind by
which neither your Lordship nor any man else can sail long. Howsoever, I
am the man that shall give all due respects and reverence to your great
place.</p>
<p>“20th June, 1625.</p>
<p>FR. ST. ALBAN.”</p>
<p>Bacon always claimed that he was not “vindicative.” But considering
how Bishop Williams, when he was Lord Keeper, had charged Bacon with
“knavery” and “deceiving his creditors” in the arrangements about his
fine, it is not a little strange to find that at the end of his life
Bacon had so completely made friends with him that he chose him as the
person to whom he meant to leave his speeches and letters, which he was
“willing should not be lost,” and also the charge of superintending two
foundations of £200 a year for Natural Science at the universities. And
the Bishop accepted the charge.</p>
<p>The end of this, one of the most pathetic of histories, was at hand;
the end was not the less pathetic because it came in so homely a
fashion. On a cold day in March he stopped his coach in the snow on his
way to Highgate, to try the effect of cold in arresting putrefaction. He
bought a hen from a woman by the way, and stuffed it with snow. He was
taken with a bad chill, which forced him to stop at a strange house,
Lord Arundel’s, to whom he wrote his last letter — a letter of apology
for using his house. He did not write the letter as a dying man. But
disease had fastened on him. A few days after, early on Easter morning,
April 9, 1626, he passed away. He was buried at St. Albans, in the
Church of St. Michael, “the only Christian church within the walls of
old Verulam.” “For my name and memory,” he said in his will, “I leave it
to men’s charitable speeches, and to foreign nations and the next ages.”
So he died: the brightest, richest, largest mind but one, in the age
which had seen Shakespeare and his fellows; so bright and rich and large
that there have been found those who identify him with the writer of
Hamlet and Othello. That is idle. Bacon could no more have written the
plays than Shakespeare could have prophesied the triumphs of natural
philosophy. So ended a career, than which no other in his time had
grander and nobler aims — aims, however mistaken, for the greatness and
good of England; aims for the enlargement of knowledge and truth, and
for the benefit of mankind. So ended a career which had mounted slowly
and painfully, but resolutely, to the highest pinnacle of greatness —
greatness full of honour and beneficent activity — suddenly to plunge
down to depths where honour and hope were irrecoverable. So closed, in
disgrace and disappointment and neglect, the last sad chapter of a life
which had begun so brightly, which had achieved such permanent triumphs,
which had lost itself so often in the tangles of insincerity and evil
custom, which was disfigured and marred by great misfortunes, and still
more by great mistakes of his own, which was in many ways misunderstood
not only by his generation but by himself, but which he left in the
constant and almost unaccountable faith that it would be understood and
greatly honoured by posterity. With all its glories, it was the greatest
shipwreck, the greatest tragedy, of an age which saw many.</p>
<p>But in these gloomy and dreary days of depression and vain hope to
which his letters bear witness— “three years and five months old in
misery,” again later, “a long cleansing week of five years’ expiation
and more” — his interest in his great undertaking and his industry never
flagged. The King did not want what he offered, did not want his
histories, did not want his help about law. Well, then, he had work of
his own on which his heart was set; and if the King did not want his
time, he had the more for himself. Even in the busy days of his
Chancellorship he had prepared and carried through the press the Novum
Organum, which he published on the very eve of his fall. It was one of
those works which quicken a man’s powers, and prove to him what he can
do; and it had its effect. His mind was never more alert than in these
years of adversity, his labour never more indefatigable, his powers of
expression never more keen and versatile and strong. Besides the
political writings of grave argument for which he found time, these five
years teem with the results of work. In the year before his death he
sketched out once more, in a letter to a Venetian correspondent, Fra
Fulgenzio, the friend of Sarpi, the plan of his great work, on which he
was still busy, though with fast diminishing hopes of seeing it
finished. To another foreign correspondent, a professor of philosophy at
Annecy, and a distinguished mathematician, Father Baranzan, who had
raised some questions about Bacon’s method, and had asked what was to be
done with metaphysics, he wrote in eager acknowledgment of the interest
which his writings had excited, and insisting on the paramount
necessity, above everything, of the observation of facts and of natural
history, out of which philosophy may be built. But the most
comprehensive view of his intellectual projects in all directions, “the
fullest account of his own personal feelings and designs as a writer
which we have from his own pen,” is given in a letter to the venerable
friend of his early days, Bishop Andrewes, who died a few months after
him. Part, he says, of his Instauratio, “the work in mine own judgement
(si nunquam fallit imago) I do most esteem,” has been published; but
because he “doubts that it flies too high over men’s heads,” he proposes
“to draw it down to the sense” by examples of Natural History. He has
enlarged and translated the Advancement into the De Augmentis. “Because
he could not altogether desert the civil person that he had borne,” he
had begun a work on Laws, intermediate between philosophical
jurisprudence and technical law. He had hoped to compile a digest of
English law, but found it more than he could do alone, and had laid it
aside. The Instauratio had contemplated the good of men “in the dowries
of nature;” the Laws, their good “in society and the dowries of
government.” As he owed duty to his country, and could no longer do it
service, he meant to do it honour by his history of Henry VII. His
Essays were but “recreations;” and remembering that all his writings had
hitherto “gone all into the City and none into the Temple,” he wished to
make “some poor oblation,” and therefore had chosen an argument mixed of
religious and civil considerations, the dialogue of “an Holy War”
against the Ottoman, which he never finished, but which he intended to
dedicate to Andrewes, “in respect of our ancient and private
acquaintance, and because amongst the men of our times I hold you in
special reverence.”</p>
<p>The question naturally presents itself, in regard to a friend of
Bishop Andrewes, What was Bacon as regards religion? And the answer, it
seems to me, can admit of no doubt. The obvious and superficial thing to
say is that his religion was but an official one, a tribute to custom
and opinion. But it was not so. Both in his philosophical thinking, and
in the feelings of his mind in the various accidents and occasions of
life, Bacon was a religious man, with a serious and genuine religion.
His sense of the truth and greatness of religion was as real as his
sense of the truth and greatness of nature; they were interlaced
together, and could not be separated, though they were to be studied
separately and independently. The call, repeated through all his works
from the earliest to the last, Da Fidel quæ Fidel sunt, was a warning
against confusing the two, but was an earnest recognition of the claims
of each. The solemn religious words in which his prefaces and general
statements often wind up with thanksgiving and hope and prayer, are no
mere words of course; they breathe the spirit of the deepest conviction.
It is true that he takes the religion of Christendom as he finds it. The
grounds of belief, the relation of faith to reason, the profounder
inquiries into the basis of man’s knowledge of the Eternal and
Invisible, are out of the circle within which he works. What we now call
the philosophy of religion is absent from his writings. In truth, his
mind was not qualified to grapple with such questions. There is no sign
in his writings that he ever tried his strength against them; that he
ever cared to go below the surface into the hidden things of mind, and
what mind deals with above and beyond sense — those metaphysical
difficulties and depths, as we call them, which there is no escaping,
and which are as hard to explore and as dangerous to mistake as the
forces and combinations of external nature. But it does not follow,
because he had not asked all the questions that others have asked, that
he had not thought out his reasonable faith. His religion was not one of
mere vague sentiment: it was the result of reflection and deliberate
judgment. It was the discriminating and intelligent Church of England
religion of Hooker and Andrewes, which had gone back to something deeper
and nobler in Christianity than the popular Calvinism of the earlier
Reformation; and though sternly hostile to the system of the Papacy,
both on religious and political grounds, attempted to judge it with
knowledge and justice. This deliberate character of his belief is shown
in the remarkable Confession of Faith which he left behind him: a
closely-reasoned and nobly-expressed survey of Christian theology— “a
summa theologiæ, digested into seven pages of the finest English of the
days when its tones were finest.” “The entire scheme of Christian
theology,” as Mr. Spedding says, “is constantly in his thoughts;
underlies everything; defines for him the limits of human speculation;
and, as often as the course of inquiry touches at any point the boundary
line, never fails to present itself. There is hardly any occasion or any
kind of argument into which it does not at one time or another
incidentally introduce itself.” Doubtless it was a religion which in him
was compatible, as it has been in others, with grave faults of
temperament and character. But it is impossible to doubt that it was
honest, that it elevated his thoughts, that it was a refuge and stay in
the times of trouble.</p>
