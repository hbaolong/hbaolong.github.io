<h4 id="chapter-xxii">Chapter XXII</h4>
<p>Nemesis, or the Vicissitude of Things Explained of the Reserves of
Fortune</p>
<p>NEMESIS is represented as a goddess venerated by all, but feared by
the powerful and the fortunate. She is said to be the daughter of Nox
and Oceanus She is drawn with wings, and a crown; javelin of ash in her
right hand; a glass containing Ethiopians in her left; and riding upon a
stag.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - The fable receives this explanation. The word Nemesis
manifestly signifies revenge, or retribution; for the office of this
goddess consisted in interposing, like the Roman tribunes, with an “I
forbid it,” in all courses of constant and perpetual felicity, so as not
only to chastise haughtiness, but also to repay even innocent and
moderate happiness with adversity; as if it were decreed, that none of
human race should be admitted to the banquet of the gods, but for sport.
And, indeed, to read over that chapter of Pliny wherein he has collected
the miseries and misfortunes of Augustus Cæsar, whom of all mankind one
would judge most fortunate, - as he had a certain art of using and
njoying prosperity, with a mind no way tumid, light, effeminate,
confused, or melancholic, - one cannot but think this a very great and
powerful goddess, who could bring such a victim to her altar.</p>
<p>The parents of this goddess were Oceanus and Nox; that is, the
fluctuating change of things, and the obscure and secret divine decrees.
The changes of things are aptly represented by the Ocean, on account of
its perpetual ebbing end flowing; and secret providence is justly
expressed by Night. Even the heathens have observed this secret Nemesis
of the night, or the difference betwixt divine and human judgment.</p>
<p>Wings are given to Nemesis, because of the sudden and unforeseen
changes of things; for, from the earliest account of time, it has been
common for great and prudent men to fall by the dangers they most
despised. Thus Cicero, when admonished by Brutus of the infidelity and
rancour of Octavius, coolly wrote back, “I cannot, however, but be
obliged to you, Brutus, as I ought, for informing me, though of such a
trifle.”</p>
<p>Nemesis also has her crown, by reason of the invidious and malignant
nature of the vulgar, who generally rejoice, triumph, and crown her, at
the fall of the fortunate and the powerful. And for the javelin in her
right hand, it has regard to those whom she has actually struck and
transfixed. But whoever escapes her stroke, or feels not actual calamity
or misfortune, she affrights with a black and dismal sight in her left
hand; for doubtless, mortals on the highest pinnacle of felicity have a
prospect of death, diseases, calamities, perfidious friends, undermining
enemies, reverses of fortune, andandandandc., represented by the
Ehtiopians in her glass. Thus Virgil with great elegance, describing the
battle of Actium, says of Cleopatra, .that, “she did not yet perceive
the two asps behind her;” but soon: after, which way soever she turned,
she saw whole troops of Ethiopians still before her.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is significantly added, that, Nemesis rides upon a stag,
which is a very long-lived creature; for perhaps some, by an untimely
death in youth, may prevent or escape this goddess, yet they who enjoy a
long flow of happiness and power, doubtless become subject to her at
length, and are brought to yield.</p>
