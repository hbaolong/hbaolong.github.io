<h4 id="of-simulation-and-dissimulation">Of Simulation and
Dissimulation</h4>
<p>Dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy, or wisdom; for it asketh
a strong wit, and a strong heart, to know when to tell truth, and to do
it. Therefore it is the weaker sort of politics, that are the great
dissemblers.</p>
<p>Tacitus saith, Livia sorted well with the arts of her husband, and
dissimulation of her son; attributing arts or policy to Augustus, and
dissimulation to Tiberius. And again, when Mucianus encourageth
Vespasian, to take arms against Vitellius, he saith, We rise not against
the piercing judgment of Augustus, nor the extreme caution or closeness
of Tiberius. These properties, of arts or policy, and dissimulation or
closeness, are indeed habits and faculties several, and to be
distinguished. For if a man have that penetration of judgment, as he can
discern what things are to be laid open, and what to be secreted, and
what to be showed at half lights, and to whom and when (which indeed are
arts of state, and arts of life, as Tacitus well calleth them), to him,
a habit of dissimulation is a hinderance and a poorness. But if a man
cannot obtain to that judgment, then it is left to him generally, to be
close, and a dissembler. For where a man cannot choose, or vary in
particulars, there it is good to take the safest, and wariest way, in
general; like the going softly, by one that cannot well see. Certainly
the ablest men that ever were, have had all an openness, and frankness,
of dealing; and a name of certainty and veracity; but then they were
like horses well managed; for they could tell passing well, when to stop
or turn; and at such times, when they thought the case indeed required
dissimulation, if then they used it, it came to pass that the former
opinion, spread abroad, of their good faith and clearness of dealing,
made them almost invisible.</p>
<p>There be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a man’s self.
The first, closeness, reservation, and secrecy; when a man leaveth
himself without observation, or without hold to be taken, what he is.
The second, dissimulation, in the negative; when a man lets fall signs
and arguments, that he is not, that he is. And the third, simulation, in
the affirmative; when a man industriously and expressly feigns and
pretends to be, that he is not.</p>
<p>For the first of these, secrecy; it is indeed the virtue of a
confessor. And assuredly, the secret man heareth many confessions. For
who will open himself, to a blab or a babbler? But if a man be thought
secret, it inviteth discovery; as the more close air sucketh in the more
open; and as in confession, the revealing is not for worldly use, but
for the ease of a man’s heart, so secret men come to the knowledge of
many things in that kind; while men rather discharge their minds, than
impart their minds. In few words, mysteries are due to secrecy. Besides
(to say truth) nakedness is uncomely, as well in mind as body; and it
addeth no small reverence, to men’s manners and actions, if they be not
altogether open. As for talkers and futile persons, they are commonly
vain and credulous withal. For he that talketh what he knoweth, will
also talk what he knoweth not. Therefore set it down, that an habit of
secrecy, is both politic and moral. And in this part, it is good that a
man’s face give his tongue leave to speak. For the discovery of a man’s
self, by the tracts of his countenance, is a great weakness and
betraying; by how much it is many times more marked, and believed, than
a man’s words.</p>
<p>For the second, which is dissimulation; it followeth many times upon
secrecy, by a necessity; so that he that will be secret, must be a
dissembler in some degree. For men are too cunning, to suffer a man to
keep an indifferent carriage between both, and to be secret, without
swaying the balance on either side. They will so beset a man with
questions, and draw him on, and pick it out of him, that, without an
absurd silence, he must show an inclination one way; or if he do not,
they will gather as much by his silence, as by his speech. As for
equivocations, or oraculous speeches, they cannot hold out long. So that
no man can be secret, except he give himself a little scope of
dissimulation; which is, as it were, but the skirts or train of
secrecy.</p>
<p>But for the third degree, which is simulation, and false profession;
that I hold more culpable, and less politic; except it be in great and
rare matters. And therefore a general custom of simulation (which is
this last degree) is a vice, rising either of a natural falseness or
fearfulness, or of a mind that hath some main faults, which because a
man must needs disguise, it maketh him practise simulation in other
things, lest his hand should be out of use.</p>
<p>The great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three.
First, to lay asleep opposition, and to surprise. For where a man’s
intentions are published, it is an alarum, to call up all that are
against them. The second is, to reserve to a man’s self a fair retreat.
For if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration, he must go
through or take a fall. The third is, the better to discover the mind of
another. For to him that opens himself, men will hardly show themselves
adverse; but will fair let him go on, and turn their freedom of speech,
to freedom of thought. And therefore it is a good shrewd proverb of the
Spaniard, Tell a lie and find a troth. As if there were no way of
discovery, but by simulation. There be also three disadvantages, to set
it even. The first, that simulation and dissimulation commonly carry
with them a show of fearfulness, which in any business, doth spoil the
feathers, of round flying up to the mark. The second, that it puzzleth
and perplexeth the conceits of many, that perhaps would otherwise
co-operate with him; and makes a man walk almost alone, to his own ends.
The third and greatest is, that it depriveth a man of one of the most
principal instruments for action; which is trust and belief. The best
composition and temperature, is to have openness in fame and opinion;
secrecy in habit; dissimulation in seasonable use; and a power to feign,
if there be no remedy.</p>
