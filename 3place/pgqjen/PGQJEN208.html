<h4 id="section">71</h4>
<p>The sciences which we possess come for the most part from the Greeks.
For what has been added by Roman, Arabic, or later writers is not much
nor of much importance; and whatever it is, it is built on the
foundation of Greek discoveries. Now the wisdom of the Greeks was
professorial and much given to disputations, a kind of wisdom most
adverse to the inquisition of truth. Thus that name of Sophists, which
by those who would be thought philosophers was in contempt cast back
upon and so transferred to the ancient rhetoricians, Gorgias,
Protagoras, Hippias, Polus, does indeed suit the entire class: Plato,
Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, Theophrastus, and their successors
Chrysippus, Carneades, and the rest. There was this difference only,
that the former class was wandering and mercenary, going about from town
to town, putting up their wisdom to sale, and taking a price for it,
while the latter was more pompous and dignified, as composed of men who
had fixed abodes, and who opened schools and taught their philosophy
without reward. Still both sorts, though in other respects unequal, were
professorial; both turned the matter into disputations, and set up and
battled for philosophical sects and heresies; so that their doctrines
were for the most part (as Dionysius not unaptly rallied Plato) “the
talk of idle old men to ignorant youths.” But the elder of the Greek
philosophers, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippus, Democritus, Parmenides,
Heraclitus, Xenophanes, Philolaus, and the rest (I omit Pythagoras as a
mystic), did not, so far as we know, open schools; but more silently and
severely and simply — that is, with less affectation and parade — betook
themselves to the inquisition of truth. And therefore they were in my
judgment more successful; only that their works were in the course of
time obscured by those slighter persons who had more which suits and
pleases the capacity and tastes of the vulgar; time, like a river,
bringing down to us things which are light and puffed up, but letting
weighty matters sink. Still even they were not altogether free from the
failing of their nation, but leaned too much to the ambition and vanity
of founding a sect and catching popular applause. But the inquisition of
truth must be despaired of when it turns aside to trifles of this kind.
Nor should we omit that judgment, or rather divination, which was given
concerning the Greeks by the Egyptian priest — that “they were always
boys, without antiquity of knowledge or knowledge of antiquity.”
Assuredly they have that which is characteristic of boys: they are
prompt to prattle, but cannot generate; for their wisdom abounds in
words but is barren of works. And therefore the signs which are taken
from the origin and birthplace of the received philosophy are not
good.</p>
