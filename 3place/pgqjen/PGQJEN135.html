<h4 id="section">9</h4>
<p>There are also some things which may be usefully added to the natural
history, and which will make it fitter and more convenient for the work
of the interpreter, which follows. They are five.</p>
<p>First, questions (I do not mean as to causes but as to the fact)
should be added in order to provoke and stimulate further inquiry, as in
the history of earth and sea, whether the Caspian ebbs and flows, and at
how many hours’ interval; whether there is any southern continent or
only islands, and the like.</p>
<p>Secondly, in any new and more subtle experiment the manner in which
the experiment was conducted should be added, that men may be free to
judge for themselves whether the information obtained from that
experiment be trustworthy or fallacious, and also that men’s industry
may be roused to discover, if possible, methods more exact.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if in any statement there be anything doubtful or
questionable, I would by no means have it suppressed or passed in
silence, but plainly and perspicuously set down by way of note or
admonition. For I want this primary history to be compiled with a most
religious care, as if every particular were stated upon oath, seeing
that it is the book of God’s works and (so far as the majesty of
heavenly may be compared with the humbleness of earthly things) a kind
of second Scripture.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it would not be amiss to intersperse observations
occasionally, as Pliny has done; as in the history of earth and sea,
that the figure of the earth (as far as it is yet known) compared with
the seas is narrow and pointed toward the south, wide and broad toward
the north, the figure of the sea contrary; that the great oceans
intersect the earth in channels running north and south, not east and
west, except perhaps in the extreme polar regions. It is also very good
to add canons (which are nothing more than certain general and catholic
observations), as in the history of the heavenly bodies, that Venus is
never distant more than 46 parts from the sun, Mercury never more than
23, and that the planets which are placed above the sun move slowest
when they are furthest from the earth, those under the sun fastest.
Moreover, there is another kind of observation to be employed, which has
not yet come into use, though it be of no small importance. This is,
that to the enumeration of things which are should be subjoined an
enumeration of things which are not. As in the history of the heavenly
bodies, that there is not found any star oblong or triangular, but that
every star is globular — either globular simply, as the moon, or
apparently angular, but globular in the middle, as the other stars, or
apparently radiant but globular in the middle, as the sun — or that the
stars are scattered about the sky in no order at all, so that there is
not found among them either quincunx or square, or any other regular
figure (howsoever the names be given of Delta, Crown, Cross, Chariot,
etc.) scarcely so much as a straight line, except perhaps in the belt
and dagger of Orion.</p>
<p>Fifthly, that may perhaps be of some assistance to an inquirer which
is the ruin and destruction of a believer; viz., a brief review, as in
passage, of the opinions now received, with their varieties and sects,
that they may touch and rouse the intellect and no more.</p>
