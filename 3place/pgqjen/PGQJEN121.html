<h4 id="section">24</h4>
<p>Thus have I concluded this portion of learning touching civil
knowledge; and with civil knowledge have concluded human philosophy; and
with human philosophy, philosophy in general. And being now at some
pause, looking back into that I have passed through, this writing
seemeth to me (si nunquam fallit imago), as far as a man can judge of
his own work, not much better than that noise or sound which musicians
make while they are in tuning their instruments, which is nothing
pleasant to hear, but yet is a cause why the music is sweeter
afterwards. So have I been content to tune the instruments of the Muses,
that they may play that have better hands. And surely, when I set before
me the condition of these times, in which learning hath made her third
visitation or circuit in all the qualities thereof; as the excellency
and vivacity of the wits of this age; the noble helps and lights which
we have by the travails of ancient writers; the art of printing, which
communicateth books to men of all fortunes; the openness of the world by
navigation, which hath disclosed multitudes of experiments, and a mass
of natural history; the leisure wherewith these times abound, not
employing men so generally in civil business, as the states of Graecia
did, in respect of their popularity, and the state of Rome, in respect
of the greatness of their monarchy; the present disposition of these
times at this instant to peace; the consumption of all that ever can be
said in controversies of religion, which have so much diverted men from
other sciences; the perfection of your Majesty’s learning, which as a
phoenix may call whole volleys of wits to follow you; and the
inseparable propriety of time, which is ever more and more to disclose
truth; I cannot but be raised to this persuasion, that this third period
of time will far surpass that of the Grecian and Roman learning; only if
men will know their own strength and their own weakness both; and take,
one from the other, light of invention, and not fire of contradiction;
and esteem of the inquisition of truth as of an enterprise, and not as
of a quality or ornament; and employ wit and magnificence to things of
worth and excellency, and not to things vulgar and of popular
estimation. As for my labours, if any man shall please himself or others
in the reprehension of them, they shall make that ancient and patient
request, Verbera, sed audi: let men reprehend them, so they observe and
weigh them. For the appeal is lawful (though it may be it shall not be
needful) from the first cogitations of men to their second, and from the
nearer times to the times further off. Now let us come to that learning,
which both the former times were not so blessed as to know, sacred and
inspired divinity, the Sabbath and port of all men’s labours and
peregrinations.</p>
