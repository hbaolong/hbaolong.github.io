<p>BACON AS A WRITER.</p>
<p>Bacon’s name belongs to letters as well as to philosophy. In his own
day, whatever his contemporaries thought of his Instauration of
Knowledge, he was in the first rank as a speaker and a writer. Sir
Walter Raleigh, contrasting him with Salisbury, who could speak but not
write, and Northampton, who could write but not speak, thought Bacon
eminent both as a speaker and a writer. Ben Jonson, passing in review
the more famous names of his own and the preceding age, from Sir Thomas
More to Sir Philip Sidney, Hooker, Essex, and Raleigh, places Bacon
without a rival at the head of the company as the man who had “fulfilled
all numbers,” and “stood as the mark and ἀκμὴ of our language.” And he
also records Bacon’s power as a speaker. “No man,” he says, “ever spoke
more neatly, more pressly, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in
what he uttered.”…”His hearers could not cough or look aside from him
without loss. He commanded when he spoke, and had his judges angry and
pleased at his devotion … the fear of every man that heard him was that
he should make an end.” He notices one feature for which we are less
prepared, though we know that the edge of Bacon’s sarcastic tongue was
felt and resented in James’s Court. “His speech,” says Ben Jonson, “was
nobly censorious when he could spare and pass by a jest.” The
unpopularity which certainly seems to have gathered round his name may
have had something to do with this reputation.</p>
<p>Yet as an English writer Bacon did not expect to be remembered, and
he hardly cared to be. He wrote much in Latin, and his first care was to
have his books put into a Latin dress. “For these modern languages,” he
wrote to Toby Matthews towards the close of his life, “will at one time
or another play the bank-rowte with books, and since I have lost much
time with this age, I would be glad if God would give me leave to
recover it with posterity.” He wanted to be read by the learned out of
England, who were supposed to appreciate his philosophical ideas better
than his own countrymen, and the only way to this was to have his books
translated into the “general language.” He sends Prince Charles the
Advancement in its new Latin dress. “It is a book,” he says, “that will
live, and be a citizen of the world, as English books are not.” And he
fitted it for continental reading by carefully weeding it of all
passages that might give offence to the censors at Rome or Paris. “I
have been,” he writes to the King, “mine own Index Expurgatorius, that
it may be read in all places. For since my end of putting it in Latin
was to have it read everywhere, it had been an absurd contradiction to
free it in the language and to pen it up in the matter.” Even the Essays
and the History of Henry VII. he had put into Latin “by some good pens
that do not forsake me.” Among these translators are said to have been
George Herbert and Hobbes, and on more doubtful authority, Ben Jonson
and Selden. The Essays were also translated into Latin and Italian with
Bacon’s sanction.</p>
<p>Bacon’s contemptuous and hopeless estimate of “these modern
languages,” forty years after Spenser had proclaimed and justified his
faith in his own language, is only one of the proofs of the
short-sightedness of the wisest and the limitations of the
largest-minded. Perhaps we ought not to wonder at his silence about
Shakespeare. It was the fashion, except among a set of clever but not
always very reputable people, to think the stage, as it was, below the
notice of scholars and statesmen; and Shakespeare took no trouble to
save his works from neglect. Yet it is a curious defect in Bacon that he
should not have been more alive to the powers and future of his own
language. He early and all along was profoundly impressed with the
contrast, which the scholarship of the age so abundantly presented, of
words to things. He dwells in the Advancement on that “first distemper
of learning, when men study words and not matter.” He illustrates it at
large from the reaction of the new learning and of the popular teaching
of the Reformation against the utilitarian and unclassical terminology
of the schoolmen; a reaction which soon grew to excess, and made men
“hunt more after choiceness of the phrase, and the round and clean
composition of the sentence, and the sweet falling of the clauses,” than
after worth of subject, soundness of argument, “life of invention or
depth of judgment.” “I have represented this,” he says, “in an example
of late times, but it hath been and will be secundum majus et minus in
all times;” and he likens this “vanity” to “Pygmalion’s frenzy”— “for to
fall in love with words which are but the images of matter, is all one
as to fall in love with a picture.” He was dissatisfied with the first
attempt at translation into Latin of the Advancement by Dr. Playfer of
Cambridge, because he “desired not so much neat and polite, as clear,
masculine, and apt expression.” Yet, with this hatred of circumlocution
and prettiness, of the cloudy amplifications, and pompous flourishings,
and “the flowing and watery vein,” which the scholars of his time
affected, it is strange that he should not have seen that the new ideas
and widening thoughts of which he was the herald would want a much more
elastic and more freely-working instrument than Latin could ever become.
It is wonderful indeed what can be done with Latin. It was long after
his day to be the language of the exact sciences. In his History of the
Winds, which is full of his irrepressible fancy and picturesqueness,
Bacon describes in clear and intelligible Latin the details of the
rigging of a modern man-of-war, and the mode of sailing her. But such
tasks impose a yoke, sometimes a rough one, on a language which has
“taken its ply” in very different conditions, and of which the genius is
that of indirect and circuitous expression, “full of majesty and
circumstance.” But it never, even in those days of scholarship, could
lend itself to the frankness, the straightforwardness, the fulness and
shades of suggestion and association, with which, in handling ideas of
subtlety and difficulty, a writer would wish to speak to his reader, and
which he could find only in his mother tongue. It might have been
thought that with Bacon’s contempt of form and ceremony in these
matters, his consciousness of the powers of English in his hands might
have led him to anticipate that a flexible and rich and strong language
might create a literature, and that a literature, if worth studying,
would be studied in its own language. But so great a change was beyond
even his daring thoughts. To him, as to his age, the only safe language
was the Latin. For familiar use English was well enough. But it could
not be trusted; “it would play the bankrupt with books.” And yet Galileo
was writing in Italian as well as in Latin; only within twenty-five
years later, Descartes was writing De la Méthode, and Pascal was writing
in the same French in which he wrote the Provincial Letters, his
Nouvelles Expériences touchant le Vide, and the controversial pamphlets
which followed it; showing how in that interval of five-and-twenty years
an instrument had been fashioned out of a modern language such as for
lucid expression and clear reasoning, Bacon had not yet dreamed of. From
Bacon to Pascal is the change from the old scientific way of writing to
the modern; from a modern language, as learned and used in the 16th
century, to one learned in the 17th.</p>
<p>But the language of the age of Elizabeth was a rich and noble one,
and it reached a high point in the hands of Bacon. In his hands it lent
itself to many uses, and assumed many forms, and he valued it, not
because he thought highly of its qualities as a language, but because it
enabled him with least trouble “to speak as he would,” in throwing off
the abundant thoughts that rose within his mind, and in going through
the variety of business which could not be done in Latin. But in all his
writing it is the matter, the real thing that he wanted to say, which
was uppermost. He cared how it was said, not for the sake of form or
ornament, but because the force and clearness of what was said depended
so much on how it was said. Of course, what he wanted to say varied
indefinitely with the various occasions of his life. His business may
merely be to write “a device” or panegyric for a pageant in the Queen’s
honour, or for the revels of Gray’s Inn. But even these trifles are the
result of real thought, and are full of ideas — ideas about the hopes of
knowledge or about the policy of the State; and though, of course, they
have plenty of the flourishes and quaint absurdities indispensable on
such occasions, yet the “rhetorical affectation” is in the thing itself,
and not in the way it is handled; he had an opportunity of saying some
of the things which were to him of deep and perpetual interest, and he
used it to say them, as forcibly, as strikingly, as attractively as he
could. His manner of writing depends, not on a style, or a studied or
acquired habit, but on the nature of the task which he has in hand.
Everywhere his matter is close to his words, and governs, animates,
informs his words. No one in England before had so much as he had the
power to say what he wanted to say, and exactly as he wanted to say it.
No one was so little at the mercy of conventional language or customary
rhetoric, except when he persuaded himself that he had to submit to
those necessities of flattery, which cost him at last so dear.</p>
<p>The book by which English readers, from his own time to ours, have
known him best, better than by the originality and the eloquence of the
Advancement, or than by the political weight and historical imagination
of the History of Henry VII., is the first book which he published, the
volume of Essays. It is an instance of his self-willed but most skilful
use of the freedom and ease which the “modern language,” which he
despised, gave him. It is obvious that he might have expanded these
“Counsels, moral and political,” to the size which such essays used to
swell to after his time. Many people would have thanked him for doing
so; and some have thought it a good book on which to hang their own
reflections and illustrations. But he saw how much could be done by
leaving the beaten track of set treatise and discourse, and setting down
unceremoniously the observations which he had made, and the real rules
which he had felt to be true, on various practical matters which come
home to men’s “business and bosoms.” He was very fond of these moral and
political generalisations, both of his own collecting and as found in
writers who, he thought, had the right to make them, like the Latins of
the Empire and the Italians and Spaniards of the Renaissance. But a mere
string of maxims and quotations would have been a poor thing and not
new; and he cast what he had to say into connected wholes. But nothing
can be more loose than the structure of the essays. There is no art, no
style, almost, except in a few — the political ones — no order: thoughts
are put down and left unsupported, unproved, undeveloped. In the first
form of the ten, which composed the first edition of 1597, they are more
like notes of analysis or tables of contents; they are austere even to
meagreness. But the general character continues in the enlarged and
expanded ones of Bacon’s later years. They are like chapters in
Aristotle’s Ethics and Rhetoric on virtues and characters; only Bacon’s
takes Aristotle’s broad marking lines as drawn, and proceeds with the
subtler and more refined observations of a much longer and wider
experience. But these short papers say what they have to say without
preface, and in literary undress, without a superfluous word, without
the joints and bands of structure; they say it in brief, rapid
sentences, which come down, sentence after sentence, like the strokes of
a great hammer. No wonder that in their disdainful brevity they seem
rugged and abrupt, “and do not seem to end, but fall.” But with their
truth and piercingness and delicacy of observation, their roughness
gives a kind of flavour which no elaboration could give. It is none the
less that their wisdom is of a somewhat cynical kind, fully alive to the
slipperiness and self-deceits and faithlessness which are in the world
and rather inclined to be amused at them. In some we can see distinct
records of the writer’s own experience: one contains the substance of a
charge delivered to Judge Hutton on his appointment; another of them is
a sketch drawn from life of a character which had crossed Bacon’s path,
and in the essay on Seeming Wise we can trace from the impatient notes
put down in his Commentarius Solutus, the picture of the man who stood
in his way, the Attorney-General Hobart. Some of them are memorable
oracular utterances not inadequate to the subject, on Truth or Death or
Unity. Others reveal an utter incapacity to come near a subject, except
as a strange external phenomena, like the essay on Love. There is a
distinct tendency in them to the Italian school of political and moral
wisdom, the wisdom of distrust and of reliance on indirect and
roundabout ways. There is a group of them, “of Delays,” “of Cunning,”
“of Wisdom for a Man’s Self,” “of Despatch,” which show how vigilantly
and to what purpose he had watched the treasurers and secretaries and
intriguers of Elizabeth’s and James’s Courts; and there are curious
self-revelations, as in the essay on Friendship. But there are also
currents of better and larger feeling, such as those which show his own
ideal of “Great Place,” and what he felt of its dangers and duties. And
mixed with the fantastic taste and conceits of the time, there is
evidence in them of Bacon’s keen delight in nature, in the beauty and
scents of flowers, in the charm of open-air life, as in the essay on
Gardens, “The purest of human pleasures, the greatest refreshment to the
spirits of man.”</p>
<p>But he had another manner of writing for what he held to be his more
serious work. In the philosophical and historical works there is no want
of attention to the flow and order and ornament of composition. When we
come to the Advancement of Learning, we come to a book which is one of
the landmarks of what high thought and rich imagination have made of the
English language. It is the first great book in English prose of secular
interest; the first book which can claim a place beside the Laws of
Ecclesiastical Polity. As regards its subject-matter, it has been partly
thrown into the shade by the greatly enlarged and elaborate form in
which it ultimately appeared, in a Latin dress, as the first portion of
the scheme of the Instauratio, the De Augmentis Scientiarum. Bacon
looked on it as a first effort, a kind of call-bell to awaken and
attract the interest of others in the thoughts and hopes which so
interested himself. But it contains some of his finest writing. In the
Essays he writes as a looker-on at the game of human affairs, who,
according to his frequent illustration, sees more of it than the
gamesters themselves, and is able to give wiser and faithful counsel,
not without a touch of kindly irony at the mistakes which he observes.
In the Advancement he is the enthusiast for a great cause and a great
hope, and all that he has of passion and power is enlisted in the effort
to advance it. The Advancement is far from being a perfect book. As a
survey of the actual state of knowledge in his day, of its deficiencies,
and what was wanted to supply them, it is not even up to the materials
of the time. Even the improved De Augmentis is inadequate; and there is
reason to think the Advancement was a hurried book, at least in the
later part, and it is defective in arrangement and proportion of parts.
Two of the great divisions of knowledge — history and poetry — are
despatched in comparatively short chapters; while in the division on
“Civil Knowledge,” human knowledge as it respects society, he inserts a
long essay, obviously complete in itself and clumsily thrust in here, on
the ways of getting on in the world, the means by which a man may be
“Faber fortunæ suæ” — the architect of his own success; too lively a
picture to be pleasant of the arts with which he had become acquainted
in the process of rising. The book, too, has the blemishes of its own
time; its want of simplicity, its inevitable though very often amusing
and curious pedantries. But the Advancement was the first of a long line
of books which have attempted to teach English readers how to think of
knowledge; to make it really and intelligently the interest, not of the
school or the study or the laboratory only, but of society at large. It
was a book with a purpose, new then, but of which we have seen the
fulfilment. He wanted to impress on his generation, as a very practical
matter, all that knowledge might do in wise hands, all that knowledge
had lost by the faults and errors of men and the misfortunes of time,
all that knowledge might be pushed to in all directions by faithful and
patient industry and well-planned methods for the elevation and benefit
of man in his highest capacities as well as in his humblest. And he
further sought to teach them how to know; to make them understand that
difficult achievement of self-knowledge, to know what it is to know; to
give the first attempted chart to guide them among the shallows and
rocks and whirlpools which beset the course and action of thought and
inquiry; to reveal to them the “idols” which unconsciously haunt the
minds of the strongest as well as the weakest, and interpose their
delusions when we are least aware— “the fallacies and false appearances
inseparable from our nature and our condition of life.” To induce men to
believe not only that there was much to know that was not yet dreamed
of, but that the way of knowing needed real and thorough improvement;
that the knowing mind bore along with it all kinds of snares and
disqualifications of which it is unconscious; and that it needed
training quite as much as materials to work on, was the object of the
Advancement. It was but a sketch; but it was a sketch so truly and
forcibly drawn, that it made an impression which has never been
weakened. To us its use and almost its interest is passed. But it is a
book which we can never open without coming on some noble interpretation
of the realities of nature or the mind; some unexpected discovery of
that quick and keen eye which arrests us by its truth; some felicitous
and unthought-of illustration, yet so natural as almost to be doomed to
become a commonplace; some bright touch of his incorrigible
imaginativeness, ever ready to force itself in amid the driest details
of his argument.</p>
<p>The Advancement was only one shape out of many into which he cast his
thoughts. Bacon was not easily satisfied with his work; even when he
published he did so, not because he had brought his work to the desired
point, but lest anything should happen to him and it should “perish.”
Easy and unstudied as his writing seems, it was, as we have seen, the
result of unintermitted trouble and varied modes of working. He was
quite as much a talker as a writer, and beat out his thoughts into shape
in talking. In the essay on Friendship he describes the process with a
vividness which tells of his own experience —</p>
<p>“But before you come to that [the faithful counsel that a man
receiveth from his friend], certain it is that whosoever hath his mind
fraught with many thoughts, his wits and understanding do clarify and
break up in the communicating and discoursing with another. He tosseth
his thoughts more easily; he marshalleth them more orderly; he seeth how
they look when they are turned into words; finally, he waxeth wiser than
himself, and that more by an hour’s discourse than by a day’s
meditation. It was well said by Themistocles to the King of Persia,
‘That speech was like cloth of arras opened and put abroad, whereby the
imagery doth appear in figure; whereas in thought they lie in packs.’
Neither is this second fruit of friendship, in opening the
understanding, restrained only to such friends as are able to give a man
counsel. (They are, indeed, best.) But even without that, a man learneth
of himself, and bringeth his own thoughts to light, and whetteth his
wits against a stone which itself cuts not. In a word, a man were better
relate himself to a statua or a picture, than to suffer his thoughts to
pass in smother.”</p>
<p>Bacon, as has been said, was a great maker of notes and note-books:
he was careful not of the thought only, but of the very words in which
it presented itself; everything was collected that might turn out useful
in his writing or speaking, down to alternative modes of beginning or
connecting or ending a sentence. He watched over his intellectual
appliances and resources much more strictly than over his money
concerns. He never threw away and never forgot what could be turned to
account. He was never afraid of repeating himself, if he thought he had
something apt to say. He was never tired of recasting and rewriting,
from a mere fragment or preface to a finished paper. He has favourite
images, favourite maxims, favourite texts, which he cannot do without.
“Da Fidei quæ sunt Fidei” comes in from his first book to his last. The
illustrations which he gets from the myth of Scylla, from Atalanta’s
ball, from Borgia’s saying about the French marking their lodgings with
chalk, the saying that God takes delight, like the “innocent play of
children,” “to hide his works in order to have them found out,” and to
have kings as “his playfellows in that game,” these, with many others,
reappear, however varied the context, from the first to the last of his
compositions. An edition of Bacon, with marginal references and parallel
passages, would show a more persistent recurrence of characteristic
illustrations and sentences than perhaps any other writer.</p>
<p>The Advancement was followed by attempts to give serious effect to
its lesson. This was nearly all done in Latin. He did so, because in
these works he spoke to a larger and, as he thought, more interested
audience; the use of Latin marked the gravity of his subject as one that
touched all mankind; and the majesty of Latin suited his taste and his
thoughts. Bacon spoke, indeed, impressively on the necessity of entering
into the realm of knowledge in the spirit of a little child. He dwelt on
the paramount importance of beginning from the very bottom of the scale
of fact, of understanding the commonplace things at our feet, so full of
wonder and mystery and instruction, before venturing on theories. The
sun is not polluted by shining on a dunghill, and no facts were too
ignoble to be beneath the notice of the true student of nature. But his
own genius was for the grandeur and pomp of general views. The practical
details of experimental science were, except in partial instances, yet a
great way off; and what there was, he either did not care about or
really understand, and had no aptitude for handling. He knew enough to
give reality to his argument; he knew, and insisted on it, that the
labour of observation and experiment would have to be very heavy and
quite indispensable. But his own business was with great principles and
new truths; these were what had the real attraction for him; it was the
magnificent thoughts and boundless hopes of the approaching “kingdom of
man” which kindled his imagination and fired his ambition. “He writes
philosophy,” said Harvey, who had come to his own great discovery
through patient and obscure experiments on frogs and monkeys— “he writes
philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.” And for this part of the work, the
stateliness and dignity of the Latin corresponded to the proud claims
which he made for his conception of the knowledge which was to be.
English seemed to him too homely to express the hopes of the world, too
unstable to be trusted with them. Latin was the language of command and
law. His Latin, without enslaving itself to Ciceronian types, and with a
free infusion of barbarous but most convenient words from the vast and
ingenious terminology of the schoolmen, is singularly forcible and
expressive. It is almost always easy and clear; it can be vague and
general, and it can be very precise where precision is wanted. It can,
on occasion, be magnificent, and its gravity is continually enlivened by
the play upon it, as upon a background, of his picturesque and
unexpected fancies. The exposition of his philosophical principles was
attempted in two forms. He began in English. He began, in the shape of a
personal account, a statement of a series of conclusions to which his
thinking had brought him, which he called the “Clue of the Labyrinth,”
Filum Labyrinthi. But he laid this aside unfinished, and rewrote and
completed it in Latin, with the title Cogitata et Visa. It gains by
being in Latin; as Mr. Spedding says, “it must certainly be reckoned
among the most perfect of Bacon’s productions.” The personal form with
each paragraph begins and ends. “Franciscus Bacon sic cogitavit … itaque
visum est ei” gives to it a special tone of serious conviction, and
brings the interest of the subject more keenly to the reader. It has the
same kind of personal interest, only more solemn and commanding, which
there is in Descartes’s Discours de la Méthode. In this form Bacon meant
at first to publish. He sent it to his usual critics, Sir Thomas Bodley,
Toby Matthews, and Bishop Andrewes. And he meant to follow it up with a
practical exemplification of his method. But he changed his plan. He had
more than once expressed his preference for the form of aphorisms over
the argumentative and didactic continuity of a set discourse. He had,
indeed, already twice begun a series of aphorisms on the true methods of
interpreting nature, and directing the mind in the true path of
knowledge, and had begun them with the same famous aphorism with which
the Novum Organum opens. He now reverted to the form of the aphorism,
and resolved to throw the materials of the Cogitata et Visa into this
shape. The result is the Novum Organum. It contains, with large
additions, the substance of the treatise, but broken up and rearranged
in the new form of separate impersonal generalised observations. The
points and assertions and issues which, in a continuous discourse,
careful readers mark and careless ones miss, are one by one picked out
and brought separately to the light. It begins with brief, oracular,
unproved maxims and propositions, and goes on gradually into larger
developments and explanations. The aphorisms are meant to strike, to
awaken questions, to disturb prejudices, to let in light into a nest of
unsuspected intellectual confusions and self-misunderstandings, to be
the mottoes and watchwords of many a laborious and difficult inquiry.
They form a connected and ordered chain, though the ties between each
link are not given. In this way Bacon put forth his proclamation of war
on all that then called itself science; his announcement that the whole
work of solid knowledge must be begun afresh, and by a new, and, as he
thought, infallible method. On this work Bacon concentrated all his
care. It was twelve years in hand, and twelve times underwent his
revision. “In the first book especially,” says Mr. Ellis, “every word
seems to have been carefully weighed; and it would be hard to omit or
change anything without injuring the meaning which Bacon intended to
convey.” Severe as it is, it is instinct with enthusiasm, sometimes with
passion. The Latin in which it is written answers to it; it has the
conciseness, the breadth, the lordliness of a great piece of
philosophical legislation.</p>
<p>The world has agreed to date from Bacon the systematic reform of
natural philosophy, the beginning of an intelligent attempt, which has
been crowned by such signal success, to place the investigation of
nature on a solid foundation. On purely scientific grounds his title to
this great honour may require considerable qualification. What one
thing, it is asked, would not have been discovered in the age of Galileo
and Harvey, if Bacon had never written? What one scientific discovery
can be traced to him, or to the observance of his peculiar rules? It was
something, indeed, to have conceived, as clearly as he conceived it, the
large and comprehensive idea of what natural knowledge must be, and must
rest upon, even if he were not able to realise his idea, and were
mistaken in his practical methods of reform. But great ideas and great
principles need their adequate interpreter, their vates sacer, if they
are to influence the history of mankind. This was what Bacon was to
science, to that great change in the thoughts and activity of men in
relation to the world of nature around them: and this is his title to
the great place assigned to him. He not only understood and felt what
science might be, but he was able to make others — and it was no easy
task beforehand, while the wonders of discovery were yet in the future —
understand and feel it too. And he was able to do this because he was
one of the most wonderful of thinkers and one of the greatest of
writers. The disclosure, the interpretation, the development of that
great intellectual revolution which was in the air, and which was
practically carried forward in obscurity, day by day, by the fathers of
modern astronomy and chemistry and physiology, had fallen to the task of
a genius, second only to Shakespeare. He had the power to tell the story
of what they were doing and were to do with a force of imaginative
reason of which they were utterly incapable. He was able to justify
their attempts and their hopes as they themselves could not. He was able
to interest the world in the great prospects opening on it, but of which
none but a few students had the key. The calculations of the astronomer,
the investigations of the physician, were more or less a subject of
talk, as curious or possibly useful employments. But that which bound
them together in the unity of science, which gave them their meaning
beyond themselves, which raised them to a higher level and gave them
their real dignity among the pursuits of men, which forced all thinking
men to see what new and unsuspected possibilities in the knowledge and
in the condition of mankind were opened before them, was not Bacon’s own
attempts at science, not even his collections of facts and his rules of
method, but that great idea of the reality and boundless worth of
knowledge which Bacon’s penetrating and sure intuition had discerned,
and which had taken possession of his whole nature. The impulse which he
gave to the progress of science came from his magnificent and varied
exposition of this idea; from his series of grand and memorable
generalisations on the habits and faults of the human mind — on the
difficult and yet so obvious and so natural precautions necessary to
guide it in the true and hopeful track. It came from the attractiveness,
the enthusiasm, and the persuasiveness of the pleading; from the clear
and forcible statements, the sustained eloquence, the generous hopes,
the deep and earnest purpose of the Advancement and the De Augmentis;
from the nobleness, the originality, the picturesqueness, the impressive
and irresistible truth of the great aphorisms of the Novum Organum.</p>
