9 — That the End and Scope of Knowledge Hath Been Generally Mistaken,
and that Men Were Never Well Advised what it was They Sought; Being the
9th Chapter, Whereof a Fragment (Which is the End of the Same Chapter)
Is Before</h4>
<p>It appeareth then how rarely the wits and labours of men have been
converted to the severe and original inquisition of knowledge; and in
those who have pretended, what hurt hath been done by the affectation of
professors and the distraction of such as were no professors; and how
there was never in effect any conjunction or combination of wits in the
first and inducing search, but that every man wrought apart, and would
either have his own way or else would go no further than his guide,
having in the one case the honour of a first, and in the other the ease
of a second; and lastly how in the descent and continuance of wits and
labours the succession hath been in the most popular and weak opinions,
like unto the weakest natures which many times have most children, and
in them also the condition of succession hath been rather to defend and
to adorn than to add; and if to add, yet that addition to be rather a
refining of a part than an increase of the whole. But the impediments of
time and accidents, though they have wrought a general indisposition,
yet are they not so peremptory and binding as the internal impediments
and clouds in the mind and spirit of man, whereof it now followeth to
speak.</p>
<p>The Scripture speaking of the worst sort of error saith, ERRARE FECIT
COS IN INVIO ET NON IN VIA. For a man may wander in the way, by rounding
up and down. But if men have failed in their very direction and address
that error will never by good fortune correct itself. Now it hath fared
with men in their contemplations as Seneca saith it fareth with them in
their actions, DE PARTIBUS VITAE QUISQUE DELIBERAT, DE SUMMA NEMO. A
course very ordinary with men who receive for the most part their final
ends from the inclination of their nature, or from common example and
opinion, never questioning or examining them, nor reducing them to any
clear certainty; and use only to call themselves to account and
deliberation touching the means and second ends, and thereby set
themselves in the right way to the wrong place. So likewise upon the
natural curiosity and desire to know, they have put themselves in way
without foresight or consideration of their journey’s end.</p>
<p>For I find that even those that have sought knowledge for itself, and
not for benefit or ostentation or any practical enablement in the course
of their life, have nevertheless propounded to themselves a wrong mark,
namely satisfaction (which men call truth) and not operation. For as in
the courts and services of princes and states it is a much easier matter
to give satisfaction than to do the business; so in the inquiring of
causes and reasons it is much easier to find out such causes as will
satisfy the mind of man and quiet objections, than such causes as will
direct him and give him light to new experiences and inventions. And
this did Celsus note wisely and truly, how that the causes which are in
use and whereof the knowledges now received do consist, were in time
minors and subsequents to the knowledge of the particulars out of which
they were induced and collected; and that it was not the light of those
causes which discovered particulars, but only the particulars being
first found, men did fall on glossing and discoursing of the causes;
which is the reason why the learning that now is hath the curse of
barrenness, and is courtesanlike, for pleasure, and not for fruit. Nay
to compare it rightly, the strange fiction of the poets of the
transformation of Scylla seemeth to be a lively emblem of this
philosophy and knowledge; a fair woman upwards in the parts of show, but
when you come to the parts of use and generation, Barking Monsters; for
no better are the endless distorted questions, which ever have been, and
of necessity must be, the end and womb of such knowledge.</p>
<p>But yet nevertheless here I may be mistaken, by reason of some which
have much in their pen the referring sciences to action and the use of
man, which mean quite another matter than I do. For they mean a
contriving of directions and precepts for readiness of practice, which I
discommend not, so it be not occasion that some quantity of the science
be lost; for else it will be such a piece of husbandry as to put away a
manor lying somewhat scattered, to buy in a close that lieth handsomely
about a dwelling. But my intention contrariwise is to increase and
multiply the revenues and possessions of man, and not to trim up only or
order with conveniency the grounds whereof he is already stated.
Wherefore the better to make myself understood that I mean nothing less
than words, and directly to demonstrate the point which we are now upon,
that is, what is the true end, scope, or office of knowledge, which I
have set down to consist not in any plausible, delectable, reverend, or
admired discourse, or any satisfactory arguments, but in effecting and
working, and in discovery of particulars not revealed before for the
better endowment and help of man’s life; I have thought good to make as
it were a Kalendar or Inventory of the wealth, furniture, or means of
man according to his present estate, as far as it is known; which I do
not to shew any universality of sense or knowledge, and much less to
make a satire of reprehension in respect of wants and errors, but partly
because cogitations new had need of some grossness and inculcation to
make them perceived; and chiefly to the end that for the time to come
(upon the account and state now made and cast up) it may appear what
increase this new manner of use and administration of the stock (if it
be once planted) shall bring with it hereafter; and for the time present
(in case I should be prevented by death to propound and reveal this new
light as I purpose) yet I may at the least give some awaking note both
of the wants in man’s present condition and the nature of the supplies
to be wished; though for mine own part neither do I much build upon my
present anticipations, neither do I think ourselves yet learned or wise
enough to wish reasonably: for as it asks some knowledge to demand a
question not impertinent, so it asketh some sense to make a wish not
absurd.</p>
