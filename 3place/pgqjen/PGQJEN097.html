<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>To proceed now from imperial and military virtue to moral and
private virtue; first, it is an assured truth, which is contained in the
verses:—</li>
</ol>
<p>“Scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes</p>
<p>Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.”</p>
<p>It taketh away the wildness and barbarism and fierceness of men’s
minds; but indeed the accent had need be upon fideliter; for a little
superficial learning doth rather work a contrary effect. It taketh away
all levity, temerity, and insolency, by copious suggestion of all doubts
and difficulties, and acquainting the mind to balance reasons on both
sides, and to turn back the first offers and conceits of the mind, and
to accept of nothing but examined and tried. It taketh away vain
admiration of anything, which is the root of all weakness. For all
things are admired, either because they are new, or because they are
great. For novelty, no man that wadeth in learning or contemplation
thoroughly but will find that printed in his heart, Nil novi super
terram. Neither can any man marvel at the play of puppets, that goeth
behind the curtain, and adviseth well of the motion. And for magnitude,
as Alexander the Great, after that he was used to great armies, and the
great conquests of the spacious provinces in Asia, when he received
letters out of Greece, of some fights and services there, which were
commonly for a passage or a fort, or some walled town at the most, he
said:—”It seemed to him that he was advertised of the battles of the
frogs and the mice, that the old tales went of.” So certainly, if a man
meditate much upon the universal frame of nature, the earth with men
upon it (the divineness of souls except) will not seem much other than
an ant-hill, whereas some ants carry corn, and some carry their young,
and some go empty, and all to and fro a little heap of dust. It taketh
away or mitigateth fear of death or adverse fortune, which is one of the
greatest impediments of virtue and imperfections of manners. For if a
man’s mind be deeply seasoned with the consideration of the mortality
and corruptible nature of things, he will easily concur with Epictetus,
who went forth one day and saw a woman weeping for her pitcher of earth
that was broken, and went forth the next day and saw a woman weeping for
her son that was dead, and thereupon said, “Heri vidi fragilem frangi,
hodie vidi mortalem mori.” And, therefore, Virgil did excellently and
profoundly couple the knowledge of causes and the conquest of all fears
together, as concomitantia.</p>
<p>“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,</p>
<p>Quique metus omnes, et inexorabile fatum</p>
<p>Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque</p>
<p>Acherontis avari.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>It were too long to go over the particular remedies which
learning doth minister to all the diseases of the mind: sometimes
purging the ill humours, sometimes opening the obstructions, sometimes
helping digestion, sometimes increasing appetite, sometimes healing the
wounds and exulcerations thereof, and the like; and, therefore, I will
conclude with that which hath rationem totius — which is, that it
disposeth the constitution of the mind not to be fixed or settled in the
defects thereof, but still to be capable and susceptible of growth and
reformation. For the unlearned man knows not what it is to descend into
himself, or to call himself to account, nor the pleasure of that
suavissima vita, indies sentire se fieri meliorem. The good parts he
hath he will learn to show to the full, and use them dexterously, but
not much to increase them. The faults he hath he will learn how to hide
and colour them, but not much to amend them; like an ill mower, that
mows on still, and never whets his scythe. Whereas with the learned man
it fares otherwise, that he doth ever intermix the correction and
amendment of his mind with the use and employment thereof. Nay, further,
in general and in sum, certain it is that Veritas and Bonitas differ but
as the seal and the print; for truth prints goodness, and they be the
clouds of error which descend in the storms of passions and
perturbations.</p></li>
<li><p>From moral virtue let us pass on to matter of power and
commandment, and consider whether in right reason there be any
comparable with that wherewith knowledge investeth and crowneth man’s
nature. We see the dignity of the commandment is according to the
dignity of the commanded; to have commandment over beasts as herdmen
have, is a thing contemptible; to have commandment over children as
schoolmasters have, is a matter of small honour; to have commandment
over galley-slaves is a disparagement rather than an honour. Neither is
the commandment of tyrants much better, over people which have put off
the generosity of their minds; and, therefore, it was ever holden that
honours in free monarchies and commonwealths had a sweetness more than
in tyrannies, because the commandment extendeth more over the wills of
men, and not only over their deeds and services. And therefore, when
Virgil putteth himself forth to attribute to Augustus Caesar the best of
human honours, he doth it in these words:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Victorque volentes</p>
<p>Per populos dat jura, viamque affectat Olympo.”</p>
<p>But yet the commandment of knowledge is yet higher than the
commandment over the will; for it is a commandment over the reason,
belief, and understanding of man, which is the highest part of the mind,
and giveth law to the will itself. For there is no power on earth which
setteth up a throne or chair of estate in the spirits and souls of men,
and in their cogitations, imaginations, opinions, and beliefs, but
knowledge and learning. And therefore we see the detestable and extreme
pleasure that arch-heretics, and false prophets, and impostors are
transported with, when they once find in themselves that they have a
superiority in the faith and conscience of men; so great as if they have
once tasted of it, it is seldom seen that any torture or persecution can
make them relinquish or abandon it. But as this is that which the author
of the Revelation calleth the depth or profoundness of Satan, so by
argument of contraries, the just and lawful sovereignty over men’s
understanding, by force of truth rightly interpreted, is that which
approacheth nearest to the similitude of the divine rule.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>As for fortune and advancement, the beneficence of learning is
not so confined to give fortune only to states and commonwealths, as it
doth not likewise give fortune to particular persons. For it was well
noted long ago, that Homer hath given more men their livings, than
either Sylla, or Caesar, or Augustus ever did, notwithstanding their
great largesses and donatives, and distributions of lands to so many
legions. And no doubt it is hard to say whether arms or learning have
advanced greater numbers. And in case of sovereignty we see, that if
arms or descent have carried away the kingdom, yet learning hath carried
the priesthood, which ever hath been in some competition with
empire.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, for the pleasure and delight of knowledge and learning, it
far surpasseth all other in nature. For, shall the pleasures of the
affections so exceed the pleasure of the sense, as much as the obtaining
of desire or victory exceedeth a song or a dinner? and must not of
consequence the pleasures of the intellect or understanding exceed the
pleasures of the affections? We see in all other pleasures there is
satiety, and after they be used, their verdure departeth, which showeth
well they be but deceits of pleasure, and not pleasures; and that it was
the novelty which pleased, and not the quality. And, therefore, we see
that voluptuous men turn friars, and ambitions princes turn melancholy.
But of knowledge there is no satiety, but satisfaction and appetite are
perpetually interchangeable; and, therefore, appeareth to be good in
itself simply, without fallacy or accident. Neither is that pleasure of
small efficacy and contentment to the mind of man, which the poet
Lucretius describeth elegantly:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Suave mari magno, turbantibus aequora ventis, andandandandc.”</p>
<p>“It is a view of delight,” saith he, “to stand or walk upon the shore
side, and to see a ship tossed with tempest upon the sea; or to be in a
fortified tower, and to see two battles join upon a plain. But it is a
pleasure incomparable, for the mind of man to be settled, landed, and
fortified in the certainty of truth; and from thence to descry and
behold the errors, perturbations, labours, and wanderings up and down of
other men.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Lastly, leaving the vulgar arguments, that by learning man
excelleth man in that wherein man excelleth beasts; that by learning man
ascendeth to the heavens and their motions, where in body he cannot
come; and the like: let us conclude with the dignity and excellency of
knowledge and learning in that whereunto man’s nature doth most aspire,
which is immortality, or continuance; for to this tendeth generation,
and raising of houses and families; to this tend buildings, foundations,
and monuments; to this tendeth the desire of memory, fame, and
celebration; and in effect the strength of all other human desires. We
see then how far the monuments of wit and learning are more durable than
the monuments of power or of the hands. For have not the verses of Homer
continued twenty-five hundred years, or more, without the loss of a
syllable or letter; during which the infinite palaces, temples, castles,
cities, have been decayed and demolished? It is not possible to have the
true pictures or statues of Cyrus, Alexander, Caesar, no nor of the
kings or great personages of much later years; for the originals cannot
last, and the copies cannot but leese of the life and truth. But the
images of men’s wits and knowledges remain in books, exempted from the
wrong of time and capable of perpetual renovation. Neither are they
fitly to be called images, because they generate still, and cast their
seeds in the minds of others, provoking and causing infinite actions and
opinions in succeeding ages. So that if the invention of the ship was
thought so noble, which carrieth riches and commodities from place to
place, and consociateth the most remote regions in participation of
their fruits, how much more are letters to be magnified, which as ships
pass through the vast seas of time, and make ages so distant to
participate of the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions, the one of the
other? Nay, further, we see some of the philosophers which were least
divine, and most immersed in the senses, and denied generally the
immortality of the soul, yet came to this point, that whatsoever motions
the spirit of man could act and perform without the organs of the body,
they thought might remain after death, which were only those of the
understanding and not of the affection; so immortal and incorruptible a
thing did knowledge seem unto them to be. But we, that know by divine
revelation that not only the understanding but the affections purified,
not only the spirit but the body changed, shall be advanced to
immortality, do disclaim in these rudiments of the senses. But it must
be remembered, both in this last point, and so it may likewise be
needful in other places, that in probation of the dignity of knowledge
or learning, I did in the beginning separate divine testimony from
human, which method I have pursued, and so handled them both
apart.</p></li>
<li><p>Nevertheless I do not pretend, and I know it will be impossible
for me, by any pleading of mine, to reverse the judgment, either of
AEsop’s cock, that preferred the barleycorn before the gem; or of Midas,
that being chosen judge between Apollo, president of the Muses, and Pan,
god of the flocks, judged for plenty; or of Paris, that judged for
beauty and love against wisdom and power; or of Agrippina, occidat
matrem, modo imperet, that preferred empire with any condition never so
detestable; or of Ulysses, qui vetulam praetulit immortalitati, being a
figure of those which prefer custom and habit before all excellency, or
of a number of the like popular judgments. For these things must
continue as they have been; but so will that also continue whereupon
learning hath ever relied, and which faileth not: Justificata est
sapientia a filiis suis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Second Book</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It might seem to have more convenience, though it come often
otherwise to pass (excellent King), that those which are fruitful in
their generations, and have in themselves the foresight of immortality
in their descendants, should likewise be more careful of the good estate
of future times, unto which they know they must transmit and commend
over their dearest pledges. Queen Elizabeth was a sojourner in the world
in respect of her unmarried life, and was a blessing to her own times;
and yet so as the impression of her good government, besides her happy
memory, is not without some effect which doth survive her. But to your
Majesty, whom God hath already blessed with so much royal issue, worthy
to continue and represent you for ever, and whose youthful and fruitful
bed doth yet promise many the like renovations, it is proper and
agreeable to be conversant not only in the transitory parts of good
government, but in those acts also which are in their nature permanent
and perpetual. Amongst the which (if affection do not transport me)
there is not any more worthy than the further endowment of the world
with sound and fruitful knowledge. For why should a few received authors
stand up like Hercules’ columns, beyond which there should be no sailing
or discovering, since we have so bright and benign a star as your
Majesty to conduct and prosper us? To return therefore where we left, it
remaineth to consider of what kind those acts are which have been
undertaken and performed by kings and others for the increase and
advancement of learning, wherein I purpose to speak actively, without
digressing or dilating.</p></li>
<li><p>Let this ground therefore be laid, that all works are over common
by amplitude of reward, by soundness of direction, and by the
conjunction of labours. The first multiplieth endeavour, the second
preventeth error, and the third supplieth the frailty of man. But the
principal of these is direction, for claudus in via antevertit cursorem
extra viam; and Solomon excellently setteth it down, “If the iron be not
sharp, it requireth more strength, but wisdom is that which prevaileth,”
signifying that the invention or election of the mean is more effectual
than any enforcement or accumulation of endeavours. This I am induced to
speak, for that (not derogating from the noble intention of any that
have been deservers towards the state of learning), I do observe
nevertheless that their works and acts are rather matters of
magnificence and memory than of progression and proficience, and tend
rather to augment the mass of learning in the multitude of learned men
than to rectify or raise the sciences themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The works or acts of merit towards learning are conversant about
three objects — the places of learning, the books of learning, and the
persons of the learned. For as water, whether it be the dew of heaven or
the springs of the earth, doth scatter and leese itself in the ground,
except it be collected into some receptacle where it may by union
comfort and sustain itself; and for that cause the industry of man hath
made and framed springheads, conduits, cisterns, and pools, which men
have accustomed likewise to beautify and adorn with accomplishments of
magnificence and state, as well as of use and necessity; so this
excellent liquor of knowledge, whether it descend from divine
inspiration, or spring from human sense, would soon perish and vanish to
oblivion, if it were not preserved in books, traditions, conferences,
and places appointed, as universities, colleges, and schools, for the
receipt and comforting of the same.</p></li>
<li><p>The works which concern the seats and places of learning are four
— foundations and buildings, endowments with revenues, endowments with
franchises and privileges, institutions and ordinances for government —
all tending to quietness and privateness of life, and discharge of cares
and troubles; much like the stations which Virgil prescribeth for the
hiving of bees:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Principio sedes apibus statioque petenda,</p>
<p>Quo neque sit ventis aditus, andandandandc.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>The works touching books are two — first, libraries, which are as
the shrines where all the relics of the ancient saints, full of true
virtue, and that without delusion or imposture, are preserved and
reposed; secondly, new editions of authors, with more correct
impressions, more faithful translations, more profitable glosses, more
diligent annotations, and the like.</p></li>
<li><p>The works pertaining to the persons of learned men (besides the
advancement and countenancing of them in general) are two — the reward
and designation of readers in sciences already extant and invented; and
the reward and designation of writers and inquirers concerning any parts
of learning not sufficiently laboured and prosecuted.</p></li>
<li><p>These are summarily the works and acts wherein the merits of many
excellent princes and other worthy personages, have been conversant. As
for any particular commemorations, I call to mind what Cicero said when
he gave general thanks, Difficile non aliquem, ingratum quenquam
praeterire. Let us rather, according to the Scriptures, look unto that
part of the race which is before us, than look back to that which is
already attained.</p></li>
<li><p>First, therefore, amongst so many great foundations of colleges
in Europe, I find strange that they are all dedicated to professions,
and none left free to arts and sciences at large. For if men judge that
learning should be referred to action, they judge well; but in this they
fall into the error described in the ancient fable, in which the other
parts of the body did suppose the stomach had been idle, because it
neither performed the office of motion, as the limbs do, nor of sense,
as the head doth; but yet notwithstanding it is the stomach that
digesteth and distributeth to all the rest. So if any man think
philosophy and universality to be idle studies, he doth not consider
that all professions are from thence served and supplied. And this I
take to be a great cause that hath hindered the progression of learning,
because these fundamental knowledges have been studied but in passage.
For if you will have a tree bear more fruit than it hath used to do, it
is not anything you can do to the boughs, but it is the stirring of the
earth and putting new mould about thee roots that must work it. Neither
is it to be forgotten, that this dedicating of foundations and dotations
to professory learning hath not only had a malign aspect and influence
upon the growth of sciences, but hath also been prejudicial to states,
and governments. For hence it proceedeth that princes find a solitude in
regard of able men to serve them in causes of estate, because there is
no education collegiate which is free, where such as were so disposed
might give themselves in histories, modern languages, books of policy
and civil discourse, and other the like enablements unto service of
estate.</p></li>
<li><p>And because founders of colleges do plant, and founders of
lectures do water, it followeth well in order to speak of the defect
which is in public lectures; namely, in the smallness, and meanness of
the salary or reward which in most places is assigned unto them, whether
they be lectures of arts, or of professions. For it is necessary to the
progression of sciences that readers be of the most able and sufficient
men; as those which are ordained for generating and propagating of
sciences, and not for transitory use. This cannot be, except their
condition and endowment be such as may content the ablest man to
appropriate his whole labour and continue his whole age in that function
and attendance; and therefore must have a proportion answerable to that
mediocrity or competency of advancement, which may be expected from a
profession or the practice of a profession. So as, if you will have
sciences flourish, you must observe David’s military law, which was,
“That those which stayed with the carriage should have equal part with
those which were in the action;” else will the carriages be ill
attended. So readers in sciences are indeed the guardians of the stores
and provisions of sciences, whence men in active courses are furnished,
and therefore ought to have equal entertainment with them; otherwise if
the fathers in sciences be of the weakest sort or be ill
maintained,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Et patrum invalidi referent jejunia nati.”</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>Another defect I note, wherein I shall need some alchemist to
help me, who call upon men to sell their books, and to build furnaces;
quitting and forsaking Minerva and the Muses as barren virgins, and
relying upon Vulcan. But certain it is, that unto the deep, fruitful,
and operative study of many sciences, specialty natural philosophy and
physic, books be not only the instrumentals; wherein also the
beneficence of men hath not been altogether wanting. For we see spheres,
globes, astrolabes, maps, and the like, have been provided as
appurtenances to astronomy and cosmography, as well as books. We see
likewise that some places instituted for physic have annexed the
commodity of gardens for simples of all sorts, and do likewise command
the use of dead bodies for anatomies. But these do respect but a few
things. In general, there will hardly be any main proficience in the
disclosing of nature, except there be some allowance for expenses about
experiments; whether they be experiments appertaining to Vulcanus or
Daedalus, furnace or engine, or any other kind. And therefore as
secretaries and spials of princes and states bring in bills for
intelligence, so you must allow the spials and intelligencers of nature
to bring in their bills; or else you shall be ill advertised.</p></li>
<li><p>And if Alexander made such a liberal assignation to Aristotle of
treasure for the allowance of hunters, fowlers, fishers, and the like,
that he might compile a history of nature, much better do they deserve
it that travail in arts of nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Another defect which I note is an intermission or neglect in
those which are governors in universities, of consultation, and in
princes or superior persons, of visitation: to enter into account and
consideration, whether the readings, exercises, and other customs
appertaining unto learning, anciently begun and since continued, be well
instituted or no; and thereupon to ground an amendment or reformation in
that which shall be found inconvenient. For it is one of your Majesty’s
own most wise and princely maxims, “That in all usages and precedents,
the times be considered wherein they first began; which if they were
weak or ignorant, it derogateth from the authority of the usage, and
leaveth it for suspect.” And therefore inasmuch as most of the usages
and orders of the universities were derived from more obscure times, it
is the more requisite they be re-examined. In this kind I will give an
instance or two, for example sake, of things that are the most obvious
and familiar. The one is a matter, which though it be ancient and
general, yet I hold to be an error; which is, that scholars in
universities come too soon and too unripe to logic and rhetoric, arts
fitter for graduates than children and novices. For these two, rightly
taken, are the gravest of sciences, being the arts of arts; the one for
judgment, the other for ornament. And they be the rules and directions
how to set forth and dispose matter: and therefore for minds empty and
unfraught with matter, and which have not gathered that which Cicero
calleth sylva and supellex, stuff and variety, to begin with those arts
(as if one should learn to weigh, or to measure, or to paint the wind)
doth work but this effect, that the wisdom of those arts, which is great
and universal, is almost made contemptible, and is degenerate into
childish sophistry and ridiculous affectation. And further, the untimely
learning of them hath drawn on by consequence the superficial and
unprofitable teaching and writing of them, as fitteth indeed to the
capacity of children. Another is a lack I find in the exercises used in
the universities, which do snake too great a divorce between invention
and memory. For their speeches are either premeditate, in verbis
conceptis, where nothing is left to invention, or merely extemporal,
where little is left to memory. Whereas in life and action there is
least use of either of these, but rather of intermixtures of
premeditation and invention, notes and memory. So as the exercise
fitteth not the practice, nor the image the life; and it is ever a true
rule in exercises, that they be framed as near as may be to the life of
practice; for otherwise they do pervert the motions and faculties of the
mind, and not prepare them. The truth whereof is not obscure, when
scholars come to the practices of professions, or other actions of civil
life; which when they set into, this want is soon found by themselves,
and sooner by others. But this part, touching the amendment of the
institutions and orders of universities, I will conclude with the clause
of Caesar’s letter to Oppius and Balbes, Hoc quemadmodum fieri possit,
nonnulla mihi in mentem veniunt, et multa reperiri possunt: de iis rebus
rgo vos ut cogitationem suscipiatis.</p></li>
<li><p>Another defect which I note ascendeth a little higher than the
precedent. For as the proficience of learning consisteth much in the
orders and institutions of universities in the same states and kingdoms,
so it would be yet more advanced, if there were more intelligence mutual
between the universities of Europe than now there is. We see there be
many orders and foundations, which though they be divided under several
sovereignties and territories, yet they take themselves to have a kind
of contract, fraternity, and correspondence one with the other, insomuch
as they have provincials and generals. And surely as nature createth
brotherhood in families, and arts mechanical contract brotherhoods in
communalties, and the anointment of God superinduceth a brotherhood in
kings and bishops, so in like manner there cannot but be a fraternity in
learning and illumination, relating to that paternity which is
attributed to God, who is called the Father of illuminations or
lights.</p></li>
<li><p>The last defect which I will note is, that there hath not been,
or very rarely been, any public designation of writers or inquirers
concerning such parts of knowledge as may appear not to have been
already sufficiently laboured or undertaken; unto which point it is an
inducement to enter into a view and examination what parts of learning
have been prosecuted, and what omitted. For the opinion of plenty is
amongst the causes of want, and the great quantity of books maketh a
show rather of superfluity than lack; which surcharge nevertheless is
not to be remedied by making no more books, but by making more good
books, which, as the serpent of Moses, might devour the serpents of the
enchanters.</p></li>
<li><p>The removing of all the defects formerly enumerate, except the
last, and of the active part also of the last (which is the designation
of writers), are opera basilica; towards which the endeavours of a
private man may be but as an image in a crossway, that may point at the
way, but cannot go it. But the inducing part of the latter (which is the
survey of learning) may be set forward by private travail. Wherefore I
will now attempt to make a general and faithful perambulation of
learning, with an inquiry what parts thereof lie fresh and waste, and
not improved and converted by the industry of man, to the end that such
a plot made and recorded to memory may both minister light to any public
designation, and, also serve to excite voluntary endeavours. Wherein,
nevertheless, my purpose is at this time to note only omissions and
deficiences, and not to make any redargution of errors or incomplete
prosecutions. For it is one thing to set forth what ground lieth
unmanured, and another thing to correct ill husbandry in that which is
manured.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the handling and undertaking of which work I am not ignorant what
it is that I do now move and attempt, nor insensible of mine own
weakness to sustain my purpose. But my hope is, that if my extreme love
to learning carry me too far, I may obtain the excuse of affection; for
that “It is not granted to man to love and to be wise.” But I know well
I can use no other liberty of judgment than I must leave to others; and
I for my part shall be indifferently glad either to perform myself, or
accept from another, that duty of humanity — Nam qui erranti comiter
monstrat viam, andandandandc. I do foresee likewise that of those things
which I shall enter and register as deficiences and omissions, many will
conceive and censure that some of them are already done and extant;
others to be but curiosities, and things of no great use; and others to
be of too great difficulty, and almost impossibility to be compassed and
effected. But for the two first, I refer myself to the particulars. For
the last, touching impossibility, I take it those things are to be held
possible which may be done by some person, though not by every one; and
which may be done by many, though not by any one; and which may be done
in the succession of ages, though not within the hourglass of one man’s
life; and which may be done by public designation, though not by private
endeavour. But, notwithstanding, if any man will take to himself rather
that of Solomon, “Dicit piger, Leo est in via,” than that of Virgil,
“Possunt quia posse videntur,” I shall be content that my labours be
esteemed but as the better sort of wishes; for as it asketh some
knowledge to demand a question not impertinent, so it requireth some
sense to make a wish not absurd.</p>
