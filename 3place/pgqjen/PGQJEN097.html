<h4 id="vi.-century.">VI. Century.</h4>
<p>OVR Experiments we take care to be, (as we haue often said,) either
Experimenta Fructifera, or Lucifera; Either of Vse, or of Discouery: For
we hate Impostures; And despise Curiosities. Yet because we must apply
out Selues somewhat to Others, wee will set downe some Curiofities
touching Plants.</p>
<p>It is a Curiosity, to haue seuerall Fruits vpon one Tree; And the
more, when some of them come Early, and some come Late; So that you, may
haue, vpon the same Tree, Ripe Fruits all Sommer. This is easily done,
by Grafting of Seurall Cians, vpon seuerall Boughes of a Stock, in a
good Ground, plentifully sed. So you may haue all Kindes of Cherries,
and all kindes of Plums, and Peaches, and Apricots, vpon one Tree; But I
conceiue the Diuer sity of Fruits must be such, as will grast vpon the
same Stocke. And therefore, I doubt, whether you can haue Apples, or
Peares, or Orenges, vpon the same Stocke, vpon which you graft
Plummes.</p>
<p>It is a Curiosity to haue Fruits of Diuers Shopes, and Figures. This
is easily performed by Moulding them, when the Fruit is young, with
Moulds of Earth, or Wood. So you may haue Cucumbers andandandandc. as
Long as a Cane; Or as Round as a Spheare; Or formed like a Crosse. You
may haue also Apples, in the sorme of Peares, or Limons. You may haue
also Fruit in more Accurate Figures; As we said of Men, Beasts, or
Birds, according as you make the Moulds. Wherein you must vnderstand,
that you make the Mould big enough, to containe the whole Fruit, when it
is growne to the greatest: For else you will choake the Spreading of the
Fruit; Which otherwise would spread it selfe, and fill the Concaue, and
so be turned into the Shape desired; As it is in Mouldworkes of Liquid
Things. Some doubt may be conceiued, that the Keeping of the Sunne from
the Fruit, may hurt it: But there is ordinary experience of Fruit that
groweth Couered. Quare also, whether some small Holes, may not be made
in the Wood, to let in the Sunne. And note, that it were best to make
the Moulds partible, glued, or cemented together, that you may open
them, when you take out the Fruit.</p>
<p>It is a Curiosity, to haue Inscriptions, or Engrauings, in Fruit, or
Trees. This is easily performed, by Writing with a Needle, or Bodkin, or
Knife, or the like, when the Fruit, or Trees are young; For as they
grow, so the Letters will grow more large, and Graphicall.</p>
<p>— Teneris{que} meos incidere Amores</p>
<p>Arboribus, crescent illa, crescetis Amores.</p>
<p>You may haue Trees apparrelled with Flowers, or Herbs, by Boring
Holes in the Bodies of them, and Putting into them Earth Holpen with
Mucke, and Setting Seeds, or Slips, of Wielets, Stramberries,
Wilde-Thyme Camamill, and such like in the Earth. Wherein they doe but
grow, in the Tree, as they doe in Pots; Though (perhaps) with some
Feeding from the Trees. It would be tried also with Shoots of Vines and
Roots of RedRoses; For it may be, they being of a more Ligueout Nature,
will incorporate with the Tree it selfe.</p>
<p>It is an ordinary Curiosity, to Forme Trees and Sbrubs, (as Rosemary,
Inniper, and the like,) into Sundry Shapes; which is done by Moulding
them within, and Cutting them without. But they are but lame Things,
being too small to keepe Figure: Great Castles made of Trees vpon Frames
of Timber, with Turrets, and Arches, were anciently matters of
Magnificence.</p>
<p>Amongst Cariofities, I shall place Colouration, though it be somewhat
better: For Beauty in Flowers is their Preheminence. It is obserued by
some, that Gilly-flowers, Sweet-Williams, Yielets, that are Coloured, if
they be neglected, and neither Watred, not New Monlded, nor
Transplanted, will turne White. And it is probable, that the White with
much culture, may turne Coloured. For this is certaine, that the White
Colour commeth of Scarcity of Nourishment; Except in Flowers that are
onely White, and admit no other Colours.</p>
<p>It is good therefore, to see what Natures doe accompany what Colours;
For by that you shall haue Light, how to induce Colours, by Producing
those Natures. Whites are more Inodorate, (for the most part) than
Flowers of the same kinde Coloured; As is found in Single White Violets,
White-Roses, White Gilly-Flowers, White Stock-Grlly-Flowers,
andandandandc. Wee finde also, that Blossomes of Trees, that are White,
are commonly Inodorate; As Cherries, Pearas; Pl —— s; Whereas those of
Apples, Crabs, Almonds, and Peaches, are Blushy, and Smell Sweet. The
Cause is, for that the Substance that maketh the Flower, is of the
thinnest and sinest of the Plant; Which also maketh Flowers to be of so
dainty Colours. And if it bee too Sparing, and Thinne, it attaineth no
Strength of Odour; Except it be in such Plants, as are very Succulent;
Whereby they need rather to be scanted in their Nourishment, than
replenished, to haue them sweet. As we fee in White Satyrian, which is
of a Dainty Smell; And in Beane-Flowers, andandandandc. And againe, if
the Plant be of Nature, to put forth White Flowers onely, and those not
thinne, or dry, they are commonly of rancke and fulsome Smell; As
May-Flowers, and White Lillies.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, in Berries, the White is commonly more Delicaee, and
Sweet in Taste, than the Coloured; As wee see in White Grapes; In White
Raspes; In White Strawberries; In White Carra-, andandandandc. The Cause
is, for that the Coloured are more iuyced, and courfer iuyced; And
therefore not so well and equally Concocted; But the White are better
proportioned, to the Disgestion of the Plant.</p>
<p>But in Fruits, the White commonly is meaner; As in Peare-Plums,
Da-asi-s, andandandandc. And the Choicest Plammes are Blacke, The
Malberry, (which though they call it a Berry, is a Fruit,) is better the
Blacke, than the White. The Haruest White-Pl-mme, is a base Pl-mme; And
the Verdoccie and White Date-Plamme, are no very good Plummes. The Cause
is, for that they are all Ouer-watry: Whereas an higher Concoction is
required for Sweetnesse, or Pleasure of Taste; And therefore all your
dainty Plummes, are a little dry, and come from the Stone; As the
Muscle-Plumme, the Damasin-Plumme, the Peach, the Apricet,
andandandandc. Yet some Fruits, which grow not to be Blacke, are of the
Nature of Berries, sweetest such as are Paler; As the Cae-r-Cherry,
which inclineth more to White, is sweeter than the Red; But the Egriot
is more sowre.</p>
<p>Take Gilly-Flower Seed, of one kinde of Gilly-Flower: (As of the
Cloue-Gilly-Flower, which is the most Common;) And sow it; And there
will come vp Gilly-Flowers, some of one Colour, and some of another,
casually, as the Seed meeteth with Nourishment in the Earth; So that the
Gardiners finde, that they may haue two or three Roots amongst an
hundred, that are rare, and of great Price: As Purple, Carnation of
Seuerall Stripes; The Canse is, (no doubt,) that in Earth, though it be
contiguous, and in one Bed, there are very feuerall luyees; And as the
Seed doth casually meet with them, so it commethforth. And it is noted
especially, that those which doe come vp Purple, doe alwayes come vp
Single; The Iuyee, as it seemeth, not being able to suffice a Succulent
Colour, and a Double Leafe. This Experiment of seuerall Colours, comming
vp from one Seed, would be tried also in Larkes-Foot, Moukes-Head,
Rappy, and Hollyoke.</p>
<p>Few Fruits are coloured Red within; The Queene-Apple is; And another
Apple, called the Rose Apple; Mulberries likewise; and Grapes, though
most toward the Skinne. There is a Peach also, that hath a Circle of Red
towards the Stone: And the Egriot-Cherry is somewhat Red within; But no
Peare, nor Warden, not Plumme, nor Apricet, although they haue (many
times) Red sides, are Coloured Red within. The Canse may be
enquired.</p>
<p>The Generall Colour of Plants is Greene; which is a Colour that no
Flower is of. There is a Greenish Prime-Rose, but it is Pale, and scatce
a Greene; The Leaues of some Trees turne a little Murry, or Reddish; And
they be commonly Young Leaues that doe so; As it is in Oakes, and Vines,
and Hasle. Leaves tot into a Yellow; And some Hollies haue part of their
Leaues Yellow, that are, (to all seeming,) as Fresh and Shining, as the
Greene. I suppose also, that Yellow is a lesse Succulent Colour, than
Greene; And a degree nearer White. For it hath beene noted, that those
Yellow Leaues of Holly stand euor towards the North, or North-East. Some
Roots are Yellow, as Carress; And some Plants Bloud-Red, Stalke and
Leafe, and all; as Amaranthus. Some Herbs incline to Purple, and Red; As
a Kinde of Sage doth, and a Kinde of Mint, and Rosa Solis,
andandandandc. And Some haue White Leaues, as another Kinde of Sape, and
another kinde of Mins; But Azure, and a Paire Purple, are neuer found in
Leaues. This Sheweth, that Flowers are made of a Refined luyce, of the
Earth; And so are Fruits: But Leaues of a more Courfe, and Common.</p>
<p>It is a Curiosity also to make Flowers Double; Which is effected by
Often Remouing them into New Earth; As on the contrary Part, Double
Flowers, by neglecting, and not Remouing, proue Single And the Way to
doe it speedily, is to sow or set Seeds, or Slips of Flowers; And as
soone as they come vp, to remoue them into New Ground, that is good.
Enquire also, whether Inoculating of Flowers, (as Stock-GillyFlowers,
Roses, Muske-Roses. andandandandc.) doth not make them Double. There is
a Cherry-Tree, that hath Double Blossomes; But that Tree beareth no
Fruit; And, it may be, that the same Meanes, which applied to the Tree,
doth extremely accelerate the Sap to rise, and breake sorth. Would make
the Tree spend it selfe in Flowers, and those to become Double; Which
were a great pleasure to see; Especially in Apple-Trees, Peach-Trees,
and Almond-Trees, that haue Blossomes Blush-Coloured.</p>
<p>The Making of Fruits, without Core or Stone, is likewise a Curiosity;
And somewhat better: Because whatsoeuer maketh them so, is like to make
them more Tender and Delicate. If a Cions or Shooe, fit to be set in the
Ground, haue the Pith finely taken forth, (and not altogether, but some
of it left, the better to saue the life,) it will beare a Fruit with
little, or no Core, or Stone. And the like is said to be, of diuiding a
Quicke-Tree downe to the Ground, and Taking out the Pith, and then
binding it vp againe.</p>
<p>It is reported also, that a Citron grafted vpon a Quince haue small
or no Seeds; And it is very probable, that grafted vpon a Stocke, that a
Sweeter Fruit may hath make the Fruit sweeter, and more void of the
harsh 〈◊◊◊〉 or Seeds.</p>
<p>It is reported, that not only the —— —— of the —— but the Steepping
of the Iuyce of the Pith, from Rising in the if you should boare a Tree
cleane thorow, and put a wedge in.It is true, there is some Affinitie
betweene the Pith, and the Kernell,because they are both of a harsh
Substance, and both placed in the Middest.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Trees watred perpetually with Warme Water, will
make a Fruit, with little or no Core, or — . And the Rule is generall,
that whatsoeuer will make a Water-Tree a Garden-Tree, will make a
Garden-Tree to haue lesse Core, or Stone.</p>
<p>The Rule is certaine, that Plants for want of Culture, —— to be be
baser in the same Kinde; And sometimes so —— , as to change into another
Kinde. 1. The St — ding —— not being Remoued, — keth them degenerase. 2.
Drangle, vnlesse the Earth of it selfe be moist, doth the like. 3. So
doth Remouing into worse Earth, or Gorbearing to C — p-st the Earth; As
wee see that Water-Mini turneth into Field-Mini; And the Colewort into
Rape by Neglect, andandandandc.</p>
<p>Whatsouer Fruit vseth to bee set vpon a Ro — , or a Slipif it bee
will degenerate. Grapes sowne; Figs, Almonds, Pomgranate Kernells sowne;
make the Fruits degenerate, and become Wilde. And againe, Most of those
Fruits that vse to be grafted, if they be set of Kernells, or Stones,
degenerate. It is true, that —— , (as hath beene touched before,) doe
better vpon S — S — , than vpon Grafting: And the Rule of Exception
should seeme to be this; That whatsoeuer P —— requireth much Moisture,
prospereth better vpon the Stone, or Kernell, than vpon the Graft. For
the Stocke, though it glueth a finer Nourishment, yet it giueth a
scanter, than the Earth at large.</p>
<p>Seeds, if they be very Old, and yet haue strength enough to bring
forth a Plant, make the Plant degenerate. And therefore skilfull
Gardiners make triall of the Seeds, before they buy them, whether they
be good or no, by Putting them into Water gently Boyled; And if they be
good, they will sprout within Halfe an Houre.</p>
<p>It is strange which is reported, that Basill too such exposed to the
Sunne, doth turne into Wilde Thyme: Although those two Herbs seeme to
haue small Affinitie; but Basill is almost the only Hot Herbe, that hath
Fat and Succulent Leaues; Which Oylinesse, if it be drawne forth by the
Sunne, it is like it will make a very great Change.</p>
<p>There is an old Tradition, that Boughs of Oake, put into the Earth,
will put forth Wilde Vines: Which if it be true, (no doubt,) it is not
the Oake that turneth into a Vine, but the Oake-Bough Putrifying,
qualifieth the Earth, to put forth a Vine of it selfe.</p>
<p>It is not impossible, and I haue heard it verified, that vpon Cutting
downe of an Old Timber-Tree, the Stub hath put out sometimes a Tree of
another Kinde; As that Beech hath put forth Birch; Which, if it be true,
the Cause may be, for that the old Stub is too scant of Iuyce, to put
forth the former Tree; And therefore putteth forth a Tree of a smaller
kindey that needeth lesse Nourishment.</p>
<p>There is an Opinion in the Countrey, that if the same Ground be oft
sowen, with the Graine that grew vpon it, it will, in the end, grow to
be of a ba-er kinde.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that in very Sterile Yeares, Carne sowne will grow to
an Other Kinde.</p>
<p>Grandia sapè quibus mandauimus Hordes Sulcis.</p>
<p>Infoelix Lolium, andandandand steriles dominantur Auena.</p>
<p>And generally it is a Rule, that Plants, that are brought forth by
Culture, as Corne, will sooner change into other Species, than those
that come of themselues: For that Culture giueth but an Aduentitious
Nature, which is more easily put off.</p>
<p>This worke of the Transmutation of Plants, one into another, is inter
Magnalia Naturae: For the Transmutation of Species is, in the vulgar
philosophie, pronounced Impossible: And certainly, it is a thing of
difficultie, and requireth deepe Seatch into Nature: But feeing there
appeare some manifest Instances of it, the Opinion of Impossibilitie is
to be reiected; And the Meanes thereof to be found out. Wee see, that in
Liuing Creatures, that come of Putrefaction, there is much
Transmutation, of one into another; As Catterpillers turne into Flies,
andandandandc. And it should seeme probable, that what soeuer Creature,
hauing life, is generated without Seed, that Creature will change out of
one Species into another. For it is the Seed, and the Nature of it,
which locketh and boundeth in the Creature, that it doth not expatiate.
So as wee may well conclude, that seeing the Earth, of it selfe, doth
put forth Plants, without Seed, therefore Plants may well haue a
Transmigration of Species. Wherefore Wanting Instances, which doe
occurre, wee shall giue Directions of the most likely Trialls: And
generally, wee would not haue those, that read this our Worke of Sylua
Syluarum, account it strange, or thinke that it is an Ouer-Haste, that
wee haue set downe Particulars vntried; For contrariwise, in our owne
Estimation, we account such Particulars, more worthy, than those that
are already tried and knowne. For these Later must be taken as you finde
them; But the Other doe leuell Point blanke at the Inuenting of Causes,
and Axiomes.</p>
<p>Flast therefore you must make account, that if you will haue one
Plant change into another, you must haue the Nourishment ouer-rule the
Seed; And therefore you are to practise it by Nourishments as contrary,
as may be, to the Nature of the Harbs; So neuerthelesse as the Herbe may
grow; And likewise with Seeds that are of the Weakest Sort, and haue
least Vigour. You shall doe well therefore, to take Marsh-Herbs, and
Plant them vpon Tops of Hills, and Champaignes; And such plants as
require much Moisture, vpon Sandy and very drie Grounds. As for Example,
Marsh-Maltowes, and Sedge, vpon Hills; Cucumber and Let-nce. Seeds, and
Coloworis, vpon a Sandy Plas: So contrariwise plant Bushes, Heath, Ling,
and Brakes, vpon a Wet or Mu-sh Ground. This I conceiue also, that all
E-c-lent and Garden-Herbs, set vpon the Tops of Hills, will proue more
Modicinall, though leffe E — lent, than they were before. And it may be
likewise, some Wilde-Herbs you may make Sallel-Herbs. This is the first
Rule for Trans — ction of Plants.</p>
<p>The second Rule shall be to burie some few Seeds, of the Herbe you
would change, amongst other Seeds; And then you shall see, whether the
luyee of those other Seeds, doe — so qualifie the Earth, as it will
alter the Seed, whereupon you worke. As for Example; Put Parfly —
amongst Onion-S — t Or Lettuce Seed amongst Parthy-Seed; Or Ba — Seed
amongst Thyme-Seed; And see the Change of Taste on otherwise. But you
shall doe well, to put the Seed you would change, into a little linnen
Cloth, that it mingle not with the forraine Seed.</p>
<p>The third Rule shall be, the Making of some Medley or Mixture of
Earth, with some other plants Braised, or Shanes, either in Leafe or
Root; As for Example, make Earth with a Mixture of Calmert-Leaues,
stamped, and set in it Artis — kes, or Pars-ips; So take Earth made with
Mai — , or Origa — m, or Wilde Th — , bruised, or stamped, and set in it
Fennell-Seed, andandandandc. In which Operation, the Processe of Nature
still will be, (as I conceiue,) not that the Harbe you worke vpon,
should draw the Iuyce of the Fo — ne Herbes (For that Opinion was haue
formerly reiected;) But that there will be a New Confection of Mould,
which perhaps will alter the Seed, and yet not to the kinde of the
former Herbe.</p>
<p>The fo — Rule shall be, to — what Herbs, some — doe put forth of
themselues; And to take — Earth, and to Pat it, or to —— — it; And in
that to set the Seed you would change: as for example, sake from vnder
Walls, or the like, where Nettles put forth in abundance, the Earth
which you shall there finde, without any String, or Root of the Nettles;
And Pot that Earth, and set in it Stock-gilly, flowers, or Wall Flowers,
andandandandc. Or sow in the Seeds of them; And see what the Euent will
be: Or take Earth, that you haue prepared to put forth Mushromes, of it
selfe, (whereof you shall finde some Instances following;) And sow in it
Purslane Seed, or Lettuce-Seed; For in these Experiments, it is likely
enough, that the Earth being accustomed to send forth one Kinde of
Nourishment, will alter the new Seed.</p>
<p>The fifth Rule shall be, to make the Herbe grow Contrary to his
Nature; As to make Ground-Herbes rise in Heighth: As for example; Carry
Camomill, or Wilde-Thyme, or the Greene Strawberry, vpon Sticks, as you
doe Heps vpon Poles; And see what the Euent will be.</p>
<p>The sixth Rule shall be, to make Plants grow out of the Sunne, or
Open Aire; For that is a great Mutation in Nature; And may induce a
Change in the Seed: As barrell vp Earth, and sow some Seed in it, and
put it in the Bottome of a Pond; Or put it in some great hollow Tree;
Trie also the Sowing of Seeds, in the Bottomes of Caues; And Pots with
Seeds sowne, hanged vp in Wells, some distance from the Water, and see
what the Euent will be.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that Timber-Trees in Coppice-Words, grow more
vpright, and more free from Vnder-Boughs, than those that stand in the
Field; The Cause whereof is, for that Plants haue a Naturall Motion, to
get to the Sunne; And besides, they are not glutted with too much
Nourishment; For that the Coppice shareth with them; And Repletion euer
hindreth Stature; Lastly, they are kept warme; And that euer in Plants
helpeth Mounting.</p>
<p>Trees, that are, of themselues, full of Heat, (which Heat appeareth
by their Inflammable Gumms,) as Firrs, and Pines, mount of themselues in
Heighth without Side-Boughs, till they come towards the Top. The Cause
is, partly Heat; And partly Tenuitie of Iuyce; Both which send the Sap
vpwards. As for Iuniper, it is but a Shrub, and groweth not bigge enough
in Body, to maintaine a tall Tree.</p>
<p>It is reported, that a Good Strong Canuas, spread ouer a Tree grasted
low, soone after it putteth forth, will dwarfe it, and make it spread.
The Cause is plaine; For that all Things that grow, will grow as they
finde Roome.</p>
<p>Trees are generally set of Roots, or Kernells; But if you set them of
Slips, (as of some Trees you may, by name the Mulberry), some of the
Slips will take; And those that take, (as is reported,) will be
DwarfeTrees. The Cause is, for that a Slip draweth Nourishment more
weakly, than either a Root, or Kernell.</p>
<p>All Plants, that put forth their Sap hastily, haue their Bodies not
proportionable to their Length; And therefore they are Winders, and
Creepers; As Iuy, Briony, Hops, Woodbine: Whereas Dwarsing requireth a
slow Putting forth, and lesse Vigour of Mounting.</p>
<p>The Scripture saith, that Salomon wrote a Naturall History, from the
Cedar of Libanus, to the Mosse growing vpon the Wall: For so the belt
Translations haue it. And it is true that Mosse is but the Rudiment of a
Plant. And (as it were) the Mould of Earth, or Barke.</p>
<p>Mosse groweth chiefly vpon Ridges of Houses, tiled or thatched, And
vpon the Crests of Walls. And that Mosse is of a lightsome, and pleasant
Greene. The Growing vpon Slopes is caused, for that Mosse, as on the one
side it commeth of Moisture and Water, so on the other side the Water
must but Slide, and not Stand or Poole. And the Growing vpon Tiles, or
Walls, andandandandc. is caused, for that those dried Earths, hauing not
Moisture sufficient to put forth a Plant, doe practise Gormination by
Putting forth Mosse; Though when by Age, or otherwise, they grow to
relent and resolue, they sometimes put forth Plants; As Wall-Flowers.
And almost all Mosse hath here and there little Stalkes, besides the low
Thrumme.</p>
<p>Mosse groweth vpon Alleyes, especially such as lye Cold, and vpon the
North; As in diuers Tarrasses: And againe, if they be much trodden; Or
if they were, at the first, grauelled; For wheresoeuer Plants are kept
downe, the Earth putteth forth Mosse.</p>
<p>Old Ground, that hath beene long vnbroken vp, gathereth Mosse: And
therfore Husbandmen vse to cure theit Pasture Grounds, when they grow to
Mosse, by Tilling them for a yeare, or two: Which also dependeth vpon
the same Cause; For that, the more Sparing and Staruing Iuyce of the
Earth, in sufficient for Plants, doth breed Mosse.</p>
<p>Old Trees are more Mossy, (farre) than Young; For that the Sap is not
so francke as to rise all to the Boughes, but tireth by the way, and
putteth out Mosse.</p>
<p>Fountaines haue Mosse growing vpon the Ground about them;</p>
<p>Muscosi Fontes; —</p>
<p>The Cause is, for that the Fountaines draine the Water from the
Ground Adiacent, and leaue but sufficient Moisture to breed Mosse: And
besides, the Coldnesse of the Water conduceth to the same.</p>
<p>The Mosse of Trees, is a kinde of Haire; For it is the Iuyce of the
Tree, that is Excerned, and doth not Affimilate. And vpon great Trees
the Mosse gathereth a Figure, like a Leafe.</p>
<p>The Moister Sort of Trees yeeld little Mosse; As we see in Aspes,
Poplars, Willowes, Beeches, andandandandc. Which is partly caused, for
the Reason that hath beene giuen, of the francke Putting vp of the Sap
into the Boughes; And partly, for that the Barkes of those Trees, are
more Close and Smooth, than those of Oakes, and Ashes; Whereby the Mosse
can the hardlier issue out.</p>
<p>In Clay-Grounds, all Fruit-Trees grow full of Mosse, both vpon Body
and Boughes; Which is caused, partly by the Coldnesse of the Ground,
whereby the Plants nourish lesse; And partly by the Toughnesse of the
Earth, whereby the Sap is shut in, and cannot get vp, to spread so
franckly, as it should doe.</p>
<p>Wee haue said heretofore, that if Trees be Hide-bound, they wax lesse
Fruitfull, and gather Mosse: And that they are holpen by Hacking,
andandandandc. And therefore by the Reason of Contraries, if Trees be
bound in with Cords, or some Outward Bands, they will put forth more
Mosse: Which (I thinke) happeneth to Trees that stand Bleake, and vpon
the Cold Winds. It would also be tried, whether, if you couer a Tree,
somewhat thicke vpon the top, after his Powling, it will not gather more
Mosse. I thinke also, the Watring of Trees with Cold Fountaine-Water,
will make them grow full of Mosse.</p>
<p>There is a Mosse the Perfumers haue, which commeth out of AppleTrees,
that hath an Excellent Sent. Quare particularly for the Manner of the
Growth, and the Nature of it. And for this Experiments, sake, being a
Thing of Price, I haue set downe the last Experiments, how to multiply,
and call on Mosses.</p>
<p>Next vnto Mosse, I will speake of Mushromes; Which are likewise an
Vnperfect Plant. These Mushromes haue two strange Properties; The One,
that they yeeld so Delicious a Meat; The other, that they come vp so
bastily; As in a Night; And yet they are Vnsowne. And therefore, such as
are Vpstarts in State, they call, in reproch, Mushromes. It must needs
bee therefore, that they be made of much Moisture; And that Moisture
Fat, Grosse, and yet somewhat Concocted. And (indeed) we finde, that
Mushromes cause the Accident, which we call Incubus, or the Mare, in the
Stomacke. And therefore the Surfet of them may Suffocate, and Empoyson.
And this sheweth, that they are Windy; And that Windinesse is Grosse,
and Swelling; Not Sharpe, or Griping. And vpon the same reason Mushromes
are a venereous Meat.</p>
<p>It is reported, that the Barke of White, or Red Poplar, (which are of
the Moistest of Trees,) cut small, and cast into Furrowes well dunged,
will cause the Ground to put forth Mushromes, at all Seasons of the
Yeare, fit to be eaten. Some adde to the Mixture Leanen of Bread,
resolued in Water.</p>
<p>It is reported, that if a Hilly-Field, where the Stubble is standing,
bee set on Fire, in a Showry Season, it will put forth great Store of
Mushromes.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Harts-Horne, Shauen, or in Small Peeces, mixed
with Dung, and watred, putteth vp Mushromes. And we know HartsHorne is
of a Fat and Clammy Substance: And it may be Oxe-Horne would doe the
like.</p>
<p>It hath beene reported, though it be searce credible, that Iuy hath
growne out of a Stags-Horne; Which they suppose, did rather come from a
Confrication of the Horne vpon the Iuy than from the Horne it selfe.
There is not knowne any Substance, but Earth, and the Procedures of
Earth, (as Tile, Stone, andandandandc.) that yeeldeth any Mosse, or
Herby Substance. There may be Trial made of some Seeds, as that of
Fennel-Seed, Mustard Seed, and Rape-Seed, put into some little Holes,
made in the Hornes of Stags, or Oxen, to see if they will grow.</p>
<p>There is also another Vnperfect Plant, that (in shew) is like a great
Mushrome: And it is sometimes as broad as ones Hat; Which they call a
Toads-Stoole: But it is not Esculent; And it groweth (commonly) by a
dead Stub of a Tree; And likewise about the Roots of Rotten Trees: And
therefore seemeth to take his Iuyce from Wood Putrified. Which sheweth,
by the way, that Wood-Putrified yeeldeth a franke Moisture.</p>
<p>There is a Cake, that groweth vpon the Side of a Dead Tree, that hath
gotten no Name, but it is large, and of a Chesnut Colour, and hard, and
pithy; Whereby it should seeme, that euen Dead Trees forget not their
Putting forth; No more than the Careasses of Mens Bodies, that put forth
Haire, and Nailes, for a Time.</p>
<p>There is a Cod, or Bag, that groweth commonly in the Fields; That at
the first is hard like a Tennis-Ball, and white; And after groweth of a
Mushrome Colour, and full of light Dust vpon the Breaking: And is
thought to be dangerous for the Eyes, if the Powder get into them; And
to bee good for Kibes. Belike it hath a Corrosiue, and Fretting
Nature.</p>
<p>There is an Herb called Iewes-Eare, that groweth vpon the Roots, and
Lower Parts of the Bodies of Trees; Especially of Elders, and sometimes
Ashes. It hath a strange Property; For in Warme-water, it swelleth, and
openeth extremely. It is not greene, but of a dusky browne Colour. And
it is vsed for Squinancies, and Inflammations in the Throat; Whereby it
seemeth to haue a Mollifying, and Lenifying Vertue.</p>
<p>There is a Kinde of Spongy Excrescence, which groweth chiefly vpon
the Roots of the Laser-Tree; And sometimes vpon Cedar, and other Trees.
It is very White, and Light, and Friable: Which we call Agarick. It is
famous in Physicke for the Purging of Tough flegme. And it is also an
excellent Opener for the Liuer: But Offensiue to the Stomack; And in
Taste it is, at the first, Sweet, and after Bitter.</p>
<p>We finde no Super-Plant, that is a Formed Plant, but Misseltoe. They
haue an idle Tradition, that there is a Bird, called a Missel-Bird, that
feedeth vpon a Seed, which many times shee cannot disgest, and so
expelleth it whole with her Excrement: which falling vpon a Bough of a
Tree, that hath some Rift, putteth forth the Misseltoe. But this is a
Fable: For it is not probable, that Birds should feed vpon that they
cannot disgest. But allow that, yet it cannot be for other Reasons: For
First, it is found but vpon certaine Trees; And those Trees beare no
such Fruit, as may allure that Bird to sit, and feed vpon them. It may
be, that Bird feedeth vpon the Misseltoe-Berries, and so is often found
there; Which may haue giuen occasion to the Tale. But that which maketh
an End of the Question, is, that Misseltoe hath beene found to put forth
vnder the Boughes, and not (onely) aboue the Boughes: So it cannot be
any Thing that falleth vpon the Bough. Misseltoe groweth chiefly vpon
Crab-Trees, AppleTrees; sometimes vpon Hasses; And rarely vpon Oakes;
The Misseltoe whereof is counted very Medicinall. It is cuer greene,
Winter and Summer; And beareth a White Glistering Berry: And it is a
Plant, vtterly differing from the Plant, vpon which it groweth. Two
things therfore may be certainly set downe: First, that Super-fatation
must be by Abundance of Sap, in the Bough that putteth it forth:
Secondly, that that Sap must be such, as the Tree doth excerne, and
cannot affimilate; For else it would goe into a Bough; And besides, it
seemeth to be more Fat and Vnctuous, than the Ordinary Sap of the Tree;
Both by the Berry, which is Clammy; And by that it continueth greene,
Winter and Summer, which the Tree doth not.</p>
<p>This Experiment of Misseltoe may giue Light to other Practises.
Therefore Triall would be made, by Ripping of the Bough of a Crab-Tree,
in the Barke; And Watring of the Wound euery Day, with Warme Water
Dunged, to see if it would bring forth Misseltoe, or any such like
Thing. But it were yet more likely to try it, with some other Watring,
or Anointing, that were not so Naturall to the Tree, as Water is; As
Oyle, or Barme of Drinke, andandandandc. So they be such Things as kill
not the Bough.</p>
<p>It were good to try, what Plants would put forth, if they be
forbidden to put forth their Naturall Boughes: Poll therefore a Tree,
and couer it, some thicknesse, with Clay on the Top; And see what it
will put forth. I suppose it will put forth Roots; For so will a Cions,
being turned downe into Clay: Therefore, in this Experiment also, the
Tree would be closed with somewhat, that is not so Naturall to the
Plant, as Clay is. Try it with Leather, or Cloth, or Painting, so it be
not hurtfull to the Tree. And it is certaine, that a Brake hath beene
knowne to grow out of a Pollard.</p>
<p>A Man may count the Prickles of Trees to be a kinde of Excrescence;
For they will neuer be Boughes, nor beare Leaues. The Plants that haue
Prickles, are Thornes, blacke and white; Brier; Rose; Limon-Trees;
CrabTrees; Goose-Berry; Berbery; These haue it in the Bough, The Plants
that haue Prickles in the Leafe, are; Holly; Iuniper; Whin-bush;
Thistle; Nettles also haue a small Venemous Prickle; So hath Borrage a
small prickle, but harmelesse. The Cause must be Hasty Putting forth;
Want of Moisture; And the Closenesse of the Barke; For the Haste of the
Spirit to put forth, and the Want of Nourishment to put forth a Bough,
and the Closenesse of the Barke, cause Prickles in Boughes; And
therefore they are euer like a Pyramis, for that the Moisture spendeth
after a little Putting forth. And for Prickles in Leaues, they come also
of Putting forth more Iuyce into the Leafe, than can spread in the Leafe
smooth; And therefore the Leaues otherwise are Rough, as Borrage and
Nettles are. As for the Leaues of Holly, they are Smooth, but neuer
Plaine, but as it were with Folds, for the same Cause.</p>
<p>There be also Plants, that though they haue no Prickles, yet they
haue a Kinde of Downy or Veluet Rine, vpon their Leaues; As Rose
Campion, Stock-Gilly-Flowers, Colts-Foot; which Downe or Nap commeth of
a Subtill Spirit, in a Soft or Fat Substance. For it is certaine, that
both Stock-Gilly-Flowers, and Rose-Campions, stamped, haue beene
applied, with successe,) to the Wrests of those that haue had Tertian,
or Quartan Agues; And the Vapour of Colts-Foot hath a Sanatiue vertue,
towards the Lungs; And the Leafe also is Healing in Surgery.</p>
<p>Another Kinde of Excrescence is an Exudation of Plants, ioyned with
Putrefaction; As we see in Oake-Apples, which are found chiefly vpon the
Leaues of Oakes; And the like vpon Willowes: And Countrey People haue a
kinde of Prediction, that if the Oake-Apple, broken, be full of Wormes,
it is a Signe of a Pestilent Yeare; Which is a likely Thing, because
they grow of Corruption.</p>
<p>There is also vpon Sweet, or other Brier, a fine Tuse, or Brush of
Mosse, of diuers Colours; Which if you cut, you shall euer finde full of
little white Wormes.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that Earth taken out of the Foundations of Vaults and
Houses, and Bottomes of Wells, and then put into Pots, will put forth
Sundry Kindes of Herbs: But some Time is required, for the Germination;
For if it be taken, but from a Fathome deepe, it will put forth the
First Yeare; If much deeper, not till after a Yeare, or Two.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Plants growing out of Earth so taken vp, doth
follow the Nature of the Mould it selfe; As if the Mould be Soft, and
Fine, it putteth forth Soft Herbs; As Grasse, Plantine, and the like; if
the Earth be Harder and Courser, it putteth forth Herbs more Rough, as
Thistles, Firres, andandandandc.</p>
<p>It is Common Experience, that where Alleyes are close Grauelled, the
Earth putteth forth, the first yeare, Knot-grasse, and after
Spire-grasse. The Cause is, for that the Hard Grauell, or Pebble at the
first Laying, will not suffer the Grasse to come forth vpright, but
turneth it to finde his way where it can; But after that the Earth is
somewhat loosened at the Top, the Ordinary Grasse commeth vp.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Earth, being taken out of Shady and Watry Woods,
some depth, and Potted, will put forth Herbs of a Fat and Iuycy
Substance; As Penny-wort, Purslane, Hausleeke, Penny-royall,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Water also doth send forth Plants, that haue no Roots fixed in
the Bottome; But they are lesse Perfect Plants, being almost but Leaues,
and those Small ones; Such is that we call Duck-Weed; Which hath a Leafe
no bigger than a Thyme-Leafe, but of a fresher Greene, and putteth forth
a little String into the Water, farre from the Bottome. As for the
Water-Lilly, it hath a Root in the Ground, And so haue a Number of other
Herbs that grow in Ponds.</p>
<p>It is reported by some of the Ancients, and some Moderne Teftimony
likewife, that there be some Plants, that grow vpon the Top of the Sea;
Being supposed to grow of some Concretion of Slime from the Water, where
the Sunne beateth hot, and where the Sea stirreth little. As for Alga
Marina, (Sea-weed,) and Eryngium (Sea-Thistle,) both haue Roots; but the
Sea-weed vnder the Water, the Sea-Thistle but vpon the Shore.</p>
<p>The Ancients haue noted, that there are some Herbs, that grow out of
Snow, laid vp close together, and Putrified; And that they are all
Bitter; And they name one specially, Flomus, which wee call MothMullein
It is certaine, that Wormes are found in Snow commonly, like
Earth-Wormes; And therefore it is not vnlike, that it may likewise put
forth Plants.</p>
<p>The Ancients haue affirmed, that there are some Herbs, that grow out
of Stone; Which may be, for that it is certain, that Toads haue been
found in the Middle of a Free-Stone. We see also, that Flints, lying
aboue Ground, gather Mosse; And Wall-Flowers, and some other Flowers,
grow vpon Walls; But whether vpon the Maine Bricke, or Stone, or whether
out of the Lime, or Chinckes, is not well obserued; For Elders and Ashes
haue beene seene to grow out of Steeples: But they manifestly grow out
of Clefts; In so much as when they grow big, they will disioyne the
Stone. And besides it is doubtfull, whether the Mortar it selfe putteth
it forth, or whether some Seeds be not let fall by Birds. There be
likewife Rock-Herbs; But I suppose those are, where there is some Mould,
or Earth. It hath likewife beene found, that great Trees growing vpon
Quarries, haue put downe their Root into the Stone.</p>
<p>In some Mines in Germany, as is reported, there grow in the Bottome
Vegetables; And the Worke-Folkes vse to say, they haue Magicall Vertue;
And will not suffer Men to gather them.</p>
<p>The Sea-Sands seldome beare Plants. Whereof the Cause is yeelded, by
some of the Ancients, for that the Sunne exhaleth the Moisture; before
it can incorporate with the Earth, and yeeld a Nourishment for the
Plant. And it is affirmed also, that Sand hath (alwayes) his Root in
Clay; And that there be no Veines of Sand, any great depth within the
Earth.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that some Plants put forth for a time, of their owne
Store, without any Nourishment from Earth, Water, Stone, andandandandc.
Of which Vide the Experiment 29.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Earth, that was brought out of the Indies, and
other Remote Countries, for Ballast of Ships, cast vpon some Grounds in
Italy, did put forth Fortaine Herbs, to vs in Europe not knowne; And,
that which is more, that of their Roots, Barkes, and Seeds, con-used
together, and mingled with other Earth, and well Watred with Warme
Water, there came forth Herbs, much like the Other.</p>
<p>Plants brought out of Hot Countries, will endeuour to put forth, at
the same Time, that they vsually do in their owne Climate; And therfore
to preserue them, there is no more required, than to keepe them from the
Iniury of Putting backe by Cold. It is reported also, that Graine out of
the Hotter Countries translated into the Colder, will be more forward,
than the Ordinary Graine of the Cold Countrey. It is likely, that this
will proue better in Graines, than in Trees; For that Graines are but
Annuall; And so the Vertue, of the Seed is not worne out; Whereas in a
Tree, it is embased by the Ground, to which it is Remoued.</p>
<p>Many Plants, which grow in the Hotter Countries; being set in the
Colder, will neucrthelesse, euen in those Cold Countries, being sowne of
Seeds, ate in the Spring, come vp and abide most Part of the Summer; As
we finde it in Orenge, and Limon-Seeds, andandandandc. The Seeds
whereof, Sowen in the End of Aprill, will bring forth Excellent Sallets,
mingled with other Herbs. And I doubt not, but the Seeds of Cloue-Trees,
and Pepper-Seeds, andandandandc. if they could come hither Greene enough
to be sowen, would doe the like.</p>
<p>There be some Flowers, Blossomes, Graines, and Fruits, which come
more Early; And Others which come more Late in the Yeare. The Flowers
that come early, with vs, are; Prime-Roses, Violets, Anemonies,
Water-Daffadillies, Crocus Vernus, and some early Tulippa’s. And they
are all Cold Plants; Which therefore, (as it should seeme,) haue a
quicker Perception, of the Heat of the Sunne Increasing, than the Hot
Herbs haue; As a Cold Hand will sooner finde a little Warmth, than a
Hot. And those that come next after, are Wall-Flowers, Cowflips,
Hyacinths, Rosemary-Flowers, andandandandc. And after them, Pincks,
Roses, Flowerdelnces, andandandandc. And the latest are Gilly-Flowers,
Holly-oakes, Larkes-Foot, andandandandc. The Earliest Blossomes are, the
Blossomes of Peaches, Almonds, Cornelians, Mezerions, andandandandc. And
they are of such Trees, as haue much Moisture, either Watrie, or Oylie.
And therefore Grocus Vernus also, being an Herbe, that hath, an Oylie
luyce, putteth forth early. For those also finde the Sunne sooner than
the Drier Trees. The Graines are, first Rye and Wheat; Then Oats and
Barley; Then Pease and Beanes. For though Greene Pease and Beanes be
eaten sooner, yet the Drie Ones, that are vsed for Horse-Meat, are ripe
last; And it seemeth that the Fatter Graine commeth first. The Earliest
Fruits are, Strawberries, Cherries, Gooseberries, Corrans; And after
them Early Apples, Early Peares, Apricots, Rasps; And after them
Damasins, and most Kinde of Plums, Peaches, andandandandc. And the
latest are Apples, Wardens, Grapes, Nuts, Quinces, Almonds, Sloes,
Brier-Berries, Heps, Medlars, Seruices, Cornelians, andandandandc.</p>
<p>It is to be noted, that (commonly) Trees that ripen latest, blossome
soonest: As Peaches, Cornelians, Sloes, Almonds, andandandandc. And it
seemeth to be a Worke of Prouidence, that they blossome so soone; For
otherwise, they could not haue the Sunne long enough to ripen.</p>
<p>There be Fruits, (but rarely,) that come twice a Teare; as some
Peares, Strawberries, andandandandc. And it seemeth they are such, as
abound with Nourishment; Whereby after one Period, before the Sunne
waxeth too weake, they can endure another. The Violet also, amongst
Flowers, commeth twice a Yeare; Especially the Double White; And that
also is a Plant full of Moisture. Roses come twice, but it is not
without Ca-ting, as hath beene formerly said.</p>
<p>In Muscbuia, though the Corne come not vp, till late Spring, yet
their Haruest is as Early as Ours. The Cause is, for that the Strength
of the Ground is kept in with the Snow; And wee see with vs, that if it
be a long Winter, it is commonly a more Plentifull Teare: And after
those kinde of Winters likewise, the Flowers, and Corne, which are
Earlier, and Later, doe come commonly at once, and at the same time;
Which troubleth the Husbandman many times; For you sh-ll haue Red Roses,
and Damaske Roses, come together; And likewise the Harnest of Wheat and
Barley. But this happeneth euer, for that the Earlier staieth for the
Later; And not that the Later commeth sooner.</p>
<p>There be diuers Fruit-Trees, in the Hot Countries, which haue
Blossomes, and Young Fruit, and Ripe Fruit, almost all the Yeare,
succeeding one another. And it is said, the Orenge hath the like with
vs, for a great Part of Summer; And so also hath the Figge. And no
doubt, the Naturall Motion of Plants, is to haue so; But that either
they want luyce to spend; Or they meet with the Cold of the Winter: And
therefore this Circle of Ripening cannot be, but in Succulent Plants,
and Hot Countries.</p>
<p>Some Herbs are but Annuall, and die, Root and all, once a Yeare; As
Borrage, Lettuce, Cucumbers, Muske-Melons, Bafill, Tobacco,
Mustard-Seed, and all kindes of Corne; Some continue many Yeares; As
Hyssope, Germander, Lanander, Fennell, andandandandc. The Cause of the
Dying is double; The first is the Tendernesse and Weaknesse of the Seed,
which maketh the Period in a small time; As it is in Borrage, Lettnce,
Cucumbers, Corne, andandandandc. And therefore none of these are Hot.
The other Cause is, for that some Herbs can worse endure Cold; As
Basill, Tobacco, Mustard-Seed. And these haue (all) much Heat.</p>
<p>The Lasting of Plants is most in those that are Largest of Body; As
Oakes, Elme, Ches-Nut, the Loat-Tree, andandandandc. And this holdeth in
Trees; But in Herbs it is often contrary; For borage, Colewort,
Pompions, which are Herbs of the Largest Size, are of small Durance;
Whereas Hyssope, Winter-Sauoury, Germander, Thyme, Sage, will last long.
The Cause is, for that Trees last according to the Strength, and
Quantitie of their Sap and Iuyce; Being well munited by their Barke
against the Iniuries of the Aire: But Herbs draw a Weake luyce; And haue
a Soft Stalke; And therefore those amongst them which last longest, are
Herbs of Strong Smell, and with a Sticky Stalke.</p>
<p>Trees that beare Mast, and Nuts, are commonly more lasting, than
those that beare Fruits; Especially the Moister Fruits: As Oakes,
Beeches, Chesnuts, Wall-nuts, Almonds, Pine-Trees, andandandandc. last
longer than Apples, Peares, Plums, andandandandc. The Cause is the
Fatnesse and Oylinesse of the Sap; Which euer wasteth lesse, than the
more Watry.</p>
<p>Trees, that bring forth their Leaues late in the Yeare, and cast them
likewise late, are more lasting, than those that sprout their Leaues
Early, or shed them betimes. The Cause is, for that the late Comming
forth sheweth a Moisture more fixed; And the other more loose, and more
easily resolued, And the same Cause is, that Wilde-Trees last longer
than Garden-Trees; And in the same kinde, those whose Fruit is Acide,
more than those whose Fruit is sweet.</p>
<p>Nothing procureth the Lasting of Trees, Bushes, and Herbs, so much,
as often Cutting: For euery Cutting causeth a Renouation of the Iuyee of
the Plant; That it neither goeth so farre, nor riseth so faintly, as
when the Plant is not Cut: Insomuch as Annuall Plants, if you cut them
seasonably, and will spare the vse of them, and suffer them to come vp
still young, will last more Yeares than one; As hath beene partly
touched; Such as is Lettuce, Purslane, Cucumber, and the like. And for
Great Trees, we see almost all Ouer-growne-Trees, in Church-yards, or
neare Ancient Buildings, and the like, are Pollards, or Dottards, and
not Trees at their full Height.</p>
<p>Some Experiment would be made, how by Art to make Plants more
Lasting, than their ordinary Period; As to make a Stalke of Wheat,
andandandandc. last a whole yeare. You must euer presuppose, that you
handle it so, as the Winter killeth it not; For we speake onely of
Prolonging the Naturall Period. I conceiue, that the Rule will hold;
That whatsoeuer maketh the Herbe come later, than at his time, will make
it last longer time: It were good to try it, in a Stalke of Wheat,
andandandandc. set in the Shade, and encompassed with a Case of Wood,
not touching the Straw, to keepe out Open Aire.</p>
<p>As for the Preseruation of Fruits, and Plants, as well vpon the Tree,
or Stalke, as gathered, we shall handle it vnder the Title of
Conseruation of Bodies.</p>
<p>The Particular Figures of Plants we leaue to their Descriptions; But
some few Things, in generall, we will obserue. Trees and Herbs, in the
Growing forth of their Boughes, and Branches, are not Figured, and keep
no Order. The Cause is, for that the Sap, being restrained in the Rinde,
and Barke, breaketh not forth at all; (As in the Bodies of Trees, and
Stalkes of Herbs.) till they begin to branch; And then, when they make
an Eruption, they breake forth casually, where they finde best way, in
the Barke, or Rinde. It is true, that some Trees are more scattered in
their Boughes; As Sallow-Trees, Warden-Trees, Quince-Trees,
Medlar-Trees, Limon-Trees, andandandandc. Some are more in the forme of
a Pyramis, and come almost to todd; As the Peare-Tree, (which the
Critickes will haue to borrow his name of — , Fire,) Orenge-Trees,
Firre-Trees, Service-Trees, LimeTrees, andandandandc. And some are more
spred and broad; As Beeches, Hornebeame, andandandandc. The rest are
more indifferent. The Cause of Scattering the Boughes, is the Hasty
breaking forth of the Sap; And therefore those Trees rise not in a Body
of any Height, but branch neare the Ground. The Cause of the Pyramis, is
the Keeping in of the Sap, long before it branch; And the spending of it
when it beginneth to branch, by equall degrees. The Spreading is caused
by the Carrying vp of the Sap, plentifully, without Expence; And then
putting it forth speedily, and at once.</p>
<p>There be diuers Herbs, but no Trees, that may be said to haue some
kinde of Order, in the Putting forth of their Leaues: For they haue
Ioynts, or Knuckles, as it were Stops in their Germination; As haue
GillyFlowers, Pinckes, Fennell, Corne, Reeds, and Canes. The Cause
whereof is, for that the Sap asoendeth vnequally, and doth (as it were)
tire and stop by the way. And it seemeth, they haue some Closenesse, and
Hardnesse in their Stalke, which bindreth the Sap from going vp, vntill
it hath gathered into a Knot, and so is more vrged to put forth. And
therefore, they are most of them hollow, when the Stalke is dry. As
Fennell-Stalke, Stubble, and Canes.</p>
<p>Flowers haue (all) exquisite Figures; And the Flower-Numbers are
(chiefly) Fiue, and Foure; As in Prime-Roses, Brier-Roses, Single
MuskeRoses, Single Pinkes, and Gilly-Flowers, andandandandc. which haue
fiue Leaues: Lillies, Flower-de-luces, Borage, Buglosse, andandandandc.
which haue foure Leaues. But some put forth Leaues not Numbered; But
they are euer small Ones; As Mary-Golds, Trisoile, andandandandc. We see
also, that the Sockets, and Supporters of Flowers, are Figured; As in
the Fiue Brethren of the Rose; Sockets of Gilly-Flowers, andandandandc.
Leaues also are all Figured, Some Round, Some Long; None Square; And
many iagged on the Sides; Which Leaues of Flowers seldome are. For I
account the Iagging of Pinkes, and GillyFlowers, to be like the
Inequality of Oake-leaues, or Vine-leaues, or the like; But they seldome
or neuer haue any small Purles.</p>
<p>Of Plants, some few put forth their Blossomes before their Leaues; As
Almonds, Peaches, Cornelians, Black-Thorne, andandandandc. But most put
forth some Leaues before their Blossomes; As Apples, Peares, Plums,
Cherries, White-Thorne, andandandandc. The Cause is, for that those,
that put forth their Blossomes first, haue either an Acute and Sharpe
Spirit; (And therfore commonly they all put forth earely in the Spring,
and ripen very late; As most of the Particulars before mentioned;) Or
else an Oyly Iuyce, which is apter to put out Flowers, than Leaues.</p>
<p>Of Plants, some are Greene all Winter; Others cast their Leaues.
There are Greene a-l Winter; Holly, Iny, Box, Firre, Eugh, Cypresse,
Iuniper, Bayes, Rose-Mary, andandandandc. The Cause of the Holding
Greene, is the Close and Compact Substance of their Leaues, and the
Pedicles of them. And the Cause of that againe, is either the Tough and
Viscous Iuyce of the Plant; Or the Strength and Heat thereof. Of the
first Sort is Holly; Which is of so Viscous a Iuyce, as they make
Bird-lime of the Barke of it. The Stalke of Iuy is Tough, and not
Fragile, as we see in other small Twigs dry. Firre yeeldeth Pitch. Box
is a fast and heauy Wood, as we see it in Bowles. Eugh is a Strong and
Tough Wood, as we see it in Bowes. Of the second Sort is Iuniper, which
is a Wood Odorate, and maketh a hot Fire. Bayes is likewise a Hot and
Aromatical Wood; And so is Rose-Mary for a Shrub. As for the Leaues,
their Density appeareth, in that, either they are Smooth and Shining, as
in Bayes, Holly, Iuy, Box, andandandandc. Or in that they are Hard and
Spiry, as in the rest. And Triall would be made of Grasting of RoseMary,
and Bayes, and Box, vpon a Holly-Stocke; Because they are Planes that
come all Winter. It were good to try it also with Grafts of other Trees,
either Fruit-Trees, or Wilde-Trees; To see whether they will not yeeld
their Fruit, or beare their Leaues, later, and longer in the Winter;
because the Sap of the Holly putteth forth most in the Winter. It may be
also a Mexerion-Tree, grafted vpon a Holly, will proue both an Earlier,
and a Greater Tree.</p>
<p>There be some Plants, that beare no Flower, and yet beare Fruit:
There be some, that beare Flowers, and no Fruit: There be some that
beare neither Flowers, nor Fruit. Most of the great Timber-Trees, (as
Oakes, Beeches, andandandandc.) beare not apparent Flowers: Some few
(likewise) of the Fruit-Trees; As Mulberry, Wall-unt, andandandandc. And
some Shrubs, (as Iuniper, Holly, andandandandc.) beare no Flowers.
Diuers Herbs also beare Seeds, (which is as the Fruit,) and yet beare no
Flowers; As Parslane, andandandandc. Those that beare Flowers and no
Fruit, are few; At the Double Cherry, the Sallow, andandandandc. But for
the Cherry, it is doubtfull, whether it be not by Art, or Culture; For
if it be by Art, then Triall would be made, whether Apples, and other
Fruits Blossomes, may not be doubled. There are some Few, that beare
neither Fruit, nor Flower; As the Elme, the Poplers, Box, Brakes,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>There be some Plants, that shoot still vpwards, and can Support
themselues; As the greatest Part of Trees and Plants: There be some
Other, that Creepe along the Ground; Or Winde about other Trees, or
Props, and cannot support themselues; As Vines, Iuy, Briar, Briony,
Woodbines, Hop’s, Climatis, Camomill, andandandandc. The Cause is, (as
hath beene partly touched,) for that all Plants, (naturally) moue
vpwards; But if the Sap put vp too fast, it maketh a slender Stalks,
which will not support the weight: And therefore these latter Sort are
all Swift and Hasty Commers.</p>
<p>The first and most Ordinary Holpe is Stercoration. The Sheeps-Dung is
one of the best; And next, the Dung of Kine: And thirdly, that of
Horses: Which is held to be somewhat too hot, vnlesse it be mingled.
That of Pigeons for a Garden, or a small Quantity of Ground, excelleth.
The Ordering of Dung is; If the Ground be Arable, to spread it
immediately before the Plonghing and Sowing; And so to Plough it in: For
if you spread it long before, the Sunne will draw out much of the
Fatnesse of the Dung: If the Ground be Grazing Ground, to spread it
somewhat late, towards Winter; That the Sunne may haue the lesse Power
to dry it vp. As for speciall Composts for Gardens, (as a Hot Bed,
andandandandc.) we haue handled them before.</p>
<p>The Second Kind of Compost, is, the Spreading of diuers Kinds of
Earths; As Marle, Chalke, Sea-Sand, Earth vpon Earth, Pond-Earth; And
the Mixtures of them. Marle is thought to be the best; As hauing most
Fatnesse; And not Heating the Ground too much. The next is Sea-Sand;
Which (no doubt) obtaineth a speciall Vertue, by the Salt: For Salt is
the first Rudiment of life. Chalke ouer heateth the Ground a little. And
therfore is best vpon Gold Clay-Grounds, or Moist Grounds: But I heard a
great Husband say, that it was a common Errour, to thinke that Chalke
helpeth Arable Grounds, but helpeth not Grazing Grounds; Wheras (indeed)
it helpeth, Grasse, as well as Corne: But that which breedeth the Errour
is, because after the Chalking of the Ground, they weare it out with
many Crops, without Rest; And then (indeed) afterwards it will beare
little Grasse, because the Gound is tired out. It were good to try the
laying of Chalke vpon Arable Grounds, a little while before Ploughing;
And to Plough it in, as they doe the Dung; But then it must be Friable
first, by Raine, or Lying: As for Earth, it Copasseth it Selfe; For I
knew a Great Garden, that had a Field (in a manner) powred vpon it; And
it did beare Fruit excellently the first yeare of the Planting: For the
Surface of the Earth is cuer the Fruitfullest. And Earth so prepared
hath a double Surface. But it is true, as I co¯-eiue, that such Earth,
as hath Salt-Petre bred in it, if you can procure it without too much
charge, doth excell. The way to hasten the Breeding of Salt-Petre, is to
forbid the Sunne, and the Growth of Vegetables, And therefore, if you
make a large Houell, thatched, ouer some Quantity of Ground; Nay if you
doe but Plancke the Ground ouer, it will breed Salt-petre. As for
Pond-Earth, or Riuer-Earth, it is a very good Compost; Especially if the
Pond haue beene long vncleansed, and so the Water be not too Hungry: And
I iudge it will be yet better, if there be some Mixture of Chalke.</p>
<p>The Third Helpe of Ground, is, by some other Substances, that haue a
Vertue to make Ground Fertile; though they be not meerely Earth: wherin
Ashes excell; In so much as the Countries about AEtna, and Vesuuius,
haue a kinde of Amends made them, for the Mischiefe the Eruptions (many
times) doe, by the exceeding Fruit fulnesse of the Soyle, caused by the
Ashes, scattered about. Soot also, though thinne spred, in a Field, or
Garden, is tried to be a very good Compost. For Salt, it is too Costly:
But it is tryed, that mingled with Seed-Corne, and sowen together, it
doth good: And I am of Opinion, that Chalke in Powder, mingled with
SeedCorne, would doe good; Perhaps as much as Chalking the Ground all
ouer. As for the Steeping of the Seeds, in seuerall Mixtures with Water,
to giue them Vigour; Or Watring Grounds with Compost-Water; We haue
spoken of them before.</p>
<p>The Fourth Helpe of Ground, is, the Suffering of Vegetables to dye
into the Ground; And so to Fatten it; As the Stubble of Corne,
Especially PeaseBrakes cast vpon the Ground, in the Beginning of Winter,
will make it very Fruitfull. It were good (also) to try, whether Leaues
of Trees swept together, with some Chalke and Dung mixed, to giue them
more Heart, would not make a good Compost: For there is nothing lost, so
much as Leaues of Trees; And as they lye scattered, and without Mixture,
they rather make the Ground soure, than otherwise.</p>
<p>The Fifth Helpe of Ground, is Heat and Warmth. It hath beene anci ——
practised to burne Heath, and Ling, and Sedge, with the vantage of Wind,
vpon the Ground: Wee see, that Warmth of Walls and Enclo — es, mendeth
Ground: We see also that Lying open to the South, men — th Ground: We
see againe, that the Foldings of Sheepe helpe Ground.ll by their Warmth,
as by their Compost: And it may be doubted, — ther the Couering of the
Ground with Brakes, in the Beginning of the Winter, (where of we spake
in the last Experiment,) helpeth it not, by reaso- of the Warmth. Nay
some very good Husbands doe suspect, that the Gathering vp of Flints, in
Flinty Ground, and Laying them on Heapes, (which is much vsed,) is no
good Husbandry; For that they would keep the Ground Warme.</p>
<p>The Sixth Helpe of Ground is, by Watering, and Irrigation; which is
in two Munners: The one by Letting in, and Shutti gout Waters, at
seasonable Tunes: For Water, at some Seasons, and with reasonable dry,
deth good; But at some other Seasons, and with too long Stay, doth — .
And this serueth onely for Meadowes, which are along some Rtuer. The
other way is, to bring Water, from some Hanging Grounds, where there are
Springs, into the Lower Grounds, carrying it in some — Furrowes; And
from those Furrowes, drawing it trauerse to spread the Water. And this
maketh an excellent Improuement, both for Corne, and Grasse. It is the
richer, if those Hanging Grounds be fruitfull, because it washeth off
some of the Fatnesse of the Earth: But howsoeuer it profiteth much.
Generally, where there are great Ouerflowes, in Fens, or the like, the
drowning of them in the Winter, maketh the Summer following more
fruitfull: The Cause may be, for that it keepeth the Ground warme, and
nourisheth it: But the Fen-Men hold, that the Sewers must be kept so, as
the Water may not stay too long in the Spring, til the Weeds and Sedge
be growne vp; For then the Ground will be like a Wood, which keepeth out
the Sunne; And so continueth the Wet; Whereby it will peuer graze (to
purpose) that yeare. Thus much for Irrigation. But for Anoydances, and
Draynings of water, where there is too much, and the Helps of Ground in
that kinde, wee shall speake of them in another Place.</p>
