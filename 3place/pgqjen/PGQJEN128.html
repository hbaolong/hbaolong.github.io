<h4 id="chapter-xv.">CHAPTER XV.</h4>
<p>Appendix.</p>
<p>The facsimile shewn in Plate 41, Page 176, is from “The Attourney’s
Academy,” 1630. The reader will perceive that the ornamental heading is
printed upside down. In the ordinary copies it is not so printed, but
only in special copies such as that possessed by the writer; the object
of the upside-down printing being, as we have already pointed out in
previous pages, to reveal, to those deemed worthy of receiving it, some
secret concerning Bacon.</p>
<p>In the present work, while we have used our utmost endeavour to place
in the vacant frame, the true portrait of him who was the wonder and
mystery of his own age and indeed of all ages, we have never failed to
remember the instructions given to us in “King Lear”: —</p>
<p>“Have more than thou showest,</p>
<p>Speak less than thou knowest.”</p>
<p>Our object has been to supply exact and positive information and to
confirm it by proofs so accurate and so certain as to compel belief and
render any effective criticism an impossibility.</p>
<p>It may however not be without advantage to those who are becoming
convinced against their will, if we place before them a few of the
utterances of men of the greatest distinction who, without being
furnished with the information which we have been able to afford to our
readers, were possessed of sufficient intelligence and common sense to
perceive the truth respecting the real authorship of the Plays.</p>
<p>LORD PALMERSTON, b. 1784, d. 1865.</p>
<p>Viscount Palmerston, the great British statesman, used to say that he
rejoiced to have lived to see three things — the re-integration of
Italy, the unveiling of the mystery of China and Japan, and the
explosion of the Shakespearian illusions. — From the Diary of the Right
Hon. Mount-Stewart E. Grant.</p>
<p>LORD HOUGHTON, b. 1809, d. 1885.</p>
<p>Lord Houghton (better known as a statesman under the name of
Richard</p>
<p>Monckton Milnes) reported the words of Lord Palmerston, and he also
told</p>
<p>Dr. Appleton Morgan that he himself no longer considered
Shakespeare,</p>
<p>the actor, as the author of the Plays.</p>
<p>SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, b. 1772, d. 1834.</p>
<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the eminent British critic and poet,
although he assumed that Shakespeare was the author of the Plays,
rejected the facts of his life and character, and says: “Ask your own
hearts, ask your own common sense, to conceive the possibility of the
author of the Plays being the anomalous, the wild, the irregular genius
of our daily criticism. What! are we to have miracles in sport? Does God
choose idiots by whom to convey divine truths to man?”</p>
<p>JOHN BRIGHT, b. 1811, d. 1889.</p>
<p>John Bright, the eminent British statesman, declared: “Any man that
believes that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote Hamlet or Lear is a
fool.” In its issue of March 27th 1889, the Rochdale Observer reported
John Bright as scornfully angry with deluded people who believe that
Shakespeare wrote Othello.</p>
<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON, b. 1803, d. 1882.</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, the great American philosopher and poet, says:
“As long as the question is of talent and mental power, the world of men
has not his equal to show…. The Egyptian verdict of the Shakespeare
Societies comes to mind that he was a jovial actor and manager. I cannot
marry this fact to his verse.” — Emerson’s Works. London, 1883. Vol. 4,
p. 420.</p>
<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER, b. 1807, d. 1892.</p>
<p>John Greenleaf Whittier, the American poet, declared: “Whether Bacon
wrote the wonderful plays or not, I am quite sure the man Shakspere
neither did nor could.”</p>
<p>DR. W. H. FURNESS, b. 1802, d. 1891.</p>
<p>Dr. W. H. Furness, the eminent American scholar, who was the father
of the Editor of the Variorum Edition of Shakespeare’s Works, wrote to
Nathaniel Holmes in a letter dated Oct. 29th 1866: “I am one of the many
who have never been able to bring the life of William Shakespeare and
the plays of Shakespeare within planetary space of each other. Are there
any two things in the world more incongruous? Had the plays come down to
us anonymously, had the labor of discovering the author been imposed
upon after generations, I think we could have found no one of that day
but F. Bacon to whom to assign the crown. In this case it would have
been resting now on his head by almost common consent.”</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN, b. 1835, d. 1910.</p>
<p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who wrote under the pseudonym of Mark
Twain, was, — it is universally admitted, — one of the wisest of men.
Last year (1909) he published a little book with the title, “Is
Shakespeare dead?” In this he treats with scathing scorn those who can
persuade themselves that the immortal plays were written by the
Stratford clown. He writes, pp. 142-3: “You can trace the life histories
of the whole of them [the world’s celebrities] save one far and away the
most colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation — Shakespeare. About
him you can find out nothing. Nothing of even the slightest importance.
Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory. Nothing that
even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly
common-place person — a manager,15 an actor of inferior grade, a small
trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any
consequence, and had forgotten him before he was fairly cold in his
grave. We can go to the records and find out the life-history of every
renowned race-horse of modern times — but not Shakespeare’s! There are
many reasons why, and they have been furnished in cartloads (of guess
and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that is worth all
the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly sufficient all
by itself — he hadn’t any history to record. There is no way of getting
around that deadly fact. And no sane way has yet been discovered of
getting round its formidable significance. Its quite plain significance
— to any but those thugs (I do not use the term unkindly) is, that
Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived, and none until he had been
dead two or three generations. The Plays enjoyed high fame from the
beginning.”</p>
<p>PRINCE BISMARCK, b. 1815, d. 1898.</p>
<p>We are told in Sydney Whitman’s “Personal Reminiscences of Prince
Bismarck,” pp. 135-6, that in 1892, Prince Bismarck said, “He could not
understand how it were possible that a man, however gifted with the
intuitions of genius, could have written what was attributed to
Shakespeare unless he had been in touch with the great affairs of state,
behind the scenes of political life, and also intimate with all the
social courtesies and refinements of thought which in Shakspeare’s time
were only to be met with in the highest circles.”</p>
<p>“It also seemed to Prince Bismarck incredible that the man who had
written the greatest dramas in the world’s literature could of his own
free will, whilst still in the prime of life, have retired to such a
place as Stratford-on-Avon and lived there for years, cut off from
intellectual society, and out of touch with the world.”</p>
<p>The foregoing list of men of the very greatest ability and
intelligence who were able clearly to perceive the absurdity of
continuing to accept the commonly received belief that the Mighty Author
of the immortal Plays was none other than the mean rustic of Stratford,
might be extended indefinitely, but the names that we have mentioned are
amply sufficient to prove to the reader that he will be in excellent
company when he himself realises the truth that</p>
<p>BACON IS SHAKESPEARE.</p>
<p>A NEUER WRITER, TO AN EUER READER. NEWES.</p>
<p>Eternall reader, you haue heere a new play, neuer stal’d with the
Stage, neuer clapper-clawd with the palmes of the vulger, and yet
passing full of the palme comicall; for it is a birth of your braine,
that neuer under-tooke any thing commicall, vainely: And were but the
vaine names of commedies changde for the titles of Commodities, or of
Playes for Pleas; you should see all those grand censors, that now stile
them such vanities, flock to them for the maine grace of their
grauities: especially this authors Commedies, that are so fram’d to the
life, that they serve for the most common Commentaries, of all the
actions of our Hues shewing such a dexteritie, and power of witte, that
the most displeased with Playes are pleasd with his Commedies…..</p>
<p>And beleeue this, that when hee is gone, and his Commedies out of
sale, you will scramble for them, and set up a new English Inquisition.
Take this for a warning, and at the perrill of your pleasures losse, and
Judgements, refuse not, nor like this the lesse, for not being sullied,
with the smoaky breath of the multitude.16</p>
<p>ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.</p>

10th</p>
<p>February 1616, Judith, William Shakespeare’s younger daughter, who,
like</p>

<p>Footnote to page 62. In 1615, although nothing of poetical importance
bearing Bacon’s name had been published, we find in Stowe’s “Annales,”

Elizabethan poets.</p>

<p>PROMUS OF FOURMES AND ELEGANCYES</p>
<p>BY</p>
<p>FRANCIS BACON.</p>
<p>PREFACE TO PROMUS</p>
<p>To these Essays I have attached a carefully collated reprint of
Francis</p>
<p>Bacon’s “Promus of Formularies and Elegancies,” a work which is to
be</p>
<p>found in Manuscript at the British Museum in the Harleian
Collection</p>
<p>(No. 7,017.)</p>
<p>The folios at present known are numbered from 83 to 132, and are
supposed to have been written about A.D. 1594-6, because folio 85 is
dated December 5th 1594, and folio 114, January 27 1595.</p>
<p>The pagination of the MS. is modern, and was inserted for reference
purposes when the Promus was bound up in one volume together with
certain other miscellaneous manuscripts which are numbered from 1 to 82,
and from 133 onwards.</p>
<p>A facsimile of a portion of a leaf of the Promus MS., folio 85, is
given on pages 190-91, in order to illustrate Bacon’s handwriting, and
also to shew his method of marking the entries. It will be perceived
that some entries have lines //// drawn across the writing, while upon
others marks similar to the capital letters T, F, and A are placed at
the end of the lines. But as the Promus is here printed page for page as
in the manuscript, I am not raising the question of the signification of
these marks, excepting only to say they indicate that Bacon made
considerable use of these memoranda.</p>
<p>“Promus” means larder or storehouse, and these “Fourmes, Formularies
and Elegancyes” appear to have been intended as a storehouse of words
and phrases to be employed in the production of subsequent literary
works.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pott was the first to print the “Promus,” which, with
translations and references, she published in 1883. In her great work,
which really may be described as monumental, Mrs. Pott points out, by
means of some thousands of quotations, how great a use appears to have
been made of the “Promus” notes, both in the acknowledged works of Bacon
and in the plays which are known as Shakespeare’s.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pott’s reading of the manuscript was extremely good, considering
the great difficulty experienced in deciphering the writing. But I
thought it advisable when preparing a reprint to secure the services of
the late Mr. F. B. Bickley, of the British Museum, to carefully revise
the whole of Bacon’s “Promus.” This task he completed and I received
twenty-four proofs, which I caused to be bound with a title page in
1898. There were no other copies, the whole of the type having
unfortunately been broken up. The proof has again been carefully
collated with the original manuscript and corrected by Mr. F. A.
Herbert, of the British Museum, and I have now reprinted it here, as I
am satisfied that the more Bacon’s Promus — the Storehouse — is
examined, the more it will be recognised how large a portion of the
material collected therein has been made use of in the Immortal Plays,
and I therefore now issue the Promus with the present essay as an
additional proof of the identity of Bacon and Shakespeare.</p>

<p>ENDNOTES.</p>
<p>1 Digges really means “When Time dissolves thy Stratford Mask”.</p>
<p>2 Through the whole play the fact that Puntarvolo represents Bacon is
continually apparent to the instructed reader. Note especially Act II.,
Scene 3, where Puntarvolo addresses his wife, who appears at a window,
in a parody of the address of Romeo to Juliet. Again in Act II., Scene
3, Carlo Buffone calls Puntarvolo “A yeoman pheuterer.” Pheuter or
feuter means a rest or supportfor a spear — which is informing.</p>
<p>3 This fact so puzzling to Halliwell-Phillipps is fully explained
when it is realised that William Shackspere of Stratford could neither
read or write.</p>
<p>4 The words attriuted to Apollo, are of course spoken by his
Chancellor Bacon. See note on the number 33 on page 112.</p>
<p>5 While I am perfectly satisfied that the above explanation of the
meaning of the expression “All numbers” is the correct one; I am not
unaware that at the date at which the Discoveries appeared “All numbers”
would be generally understood in its classical sense; Jonson of course
not being permitted to speak too plainly. He was foreman of Bacon’s good
pens and one of his “left-hands”; as any visitor to Westminster Abbey
may learn, the attendants there being careful to point out that the
sculptor has “accidentally” clothed Jonson’s Bust in a left-handed coat.
(With respect to the meaning of this the reader is referred to Plate 33,
page 131.) Thus far was written and in print when the writer’s attention
was called to the Rev. George O Neill’s little brochure, “Could Bacon
have written the plays?” in which in a note to page 14 we find “Numeri”
in Latin, “numbers” in English, applied to literature mean nothing else
than verse, and even seem to exclude prose. Thus Tibullus writes,
“Numeris ille hic pede libero scribit” (one writes in verse another in
prose), and Shakespeare has the same antithesis in “Love’s Labour Lost”
(iv., 3), “These numbers I will tear and write in prose.” Yet all this
does not settle the matter, for “Numeri” is also used in the sense
merely of “parts”. Pliny speaks of a prose work as perfect in all its
parts, “Omnibus numeris absolutus,” and Cicero says of a plan of life,
“Omnes numeros virtutis continet” (it contains every element of virtue).
So that Jonson may have merely meant to say in slightly pedantic phrase
that Bacon had passed away all parts fulfilled.</p>
<p>6 Under what is now known as “Rask’s law” the Roman F becomes B in
the Teutonic languages: fero, bear; frater, brother; feru, brew; flo,
blow, etc., etc., shewing that the Roman F was by no means really a
mute.</p>
<p>7 See Page 104.</p>
<p>8 The number 33 too obviously represented Bacon, and therefore 53
which spells sow (S 18, O 14, W 21 = 53) was substituted for 33. Scores
of examples can be found where on page 53 some reference is made to
Bacon in books published under various names, especially in the Emblem
Books. In many cases page 55 is misprinted as 53. In the Shakespeare
Folio 1623 on the first page 53 we read “Hang Hog is latten for Bacon,”
and on the second page 53 we find “Gammon of Bacon.” When the seven
extra plays were added in thethird folio 1664 in each of the two new
pages 53 appears “St. Albans.” In the fifth edition, published by Kowe
in 1709, on page 53 we read “deeper than did ever Plummet sound I’ll
drown my Book”; and on page 55 misprinted 53 (the only mispagination in
the whole book of 3324 pages) we find “I do … require My Dukedom of
thee, which perforce I know Thou must restore.” In Bacon’s “Advancement
of Learning,” first English edition, 1640, on page 55 misprinted 53 in
the margin in capital letters (the only name in capital letters in the
whole book) we read “BACON.” In Florio’s “Second Frutes,” 1591, on page
53, is “slice of bacon” and also “gammon of bakon,” to shew that Bacon
may be misspelled as it is in Drayton’s “Polyolbion,” 1622, where on
page 53 we find Becanus. A whole book could be filled with similar
instances.</p>
<p>9 About A.D. 1300 benefit of clergy was extended to all males who
could read. In 1487 it was enacted that mere laymen should have the
benefit only once and should be branded on the thumb to shew they had
once had it. Whimsies, 1623, p. 69, tells us: “If a prisoner, by help of
a compassionate prompter, hack out his neck verse (Psalm li. v. i in
Latin) and be admitted to his clergy, the jailors have a cold iron in
store if his purse be hot, but if not, a hot iron that his fist may
Fiz.” Benefit of clergy was not totally abolished till 1827.</p>
<p>10 In 1599 Sir John Hayward, LL.D., brought out “The Life and raigne
of King Henrie IIII extending to the end of the first yeare of his
raigne.” This little book contains an account of the trial of Richard
II., and was dedicated to the Earl of Essex in very encomiastic terms.
It irritated Queen Elizabeth in the highest degree, and she clapped
Hayward into prison and employed Sir Francis Bacon to search his book
for treason. (Lowndes, Bohn, p. 1018). The story carefully read reveals
the fact that it was really the play rather than the book which enraged
Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>11 The appearance of Shakespeare’s name in the list of Actors in Ben
Jonson’s plays and in the plays known as Shakespeare’s was, of course,
part of the plot to place Shakespeare’s name in a prominent position
while the pseudonym had to be preserved.</p>
<p>12 Facsimiles of law clerks’ writing of the name “John Shakespeare,”
are given in Plate 40, Page 169. They are taken from
Halliwell-Phillipps’ “Outlines of the Life of Shakespeare,” 1889,
vol. 2, pp. 233 and 236. In the first two examples the name is written
“Shakes,” followed by an exactly similar scroll and dash to complete the
name. In Saunders’ “Ancient Handwriting,” 1909, page 24, we are shown
that such a “scroll and dash” represents “per” “par,” and “por”; and in
Wright’s “Court Handwriting restored” we find that in the most perfectly
formed script a “p” with a dash through the lower part similarly
represented “per,” “par,” and “por,” this is repeated in Thoyts’ “How to
decipher and study old documents,” and the same information is given in
numerous other works. There is therefore no possible excuse for
Dr. Wallace’s blundering.</p>
<p>13 A facsimile example of the way in which the law clerk wrote
“Shaxper” is shewn in the third line of Plate 40, Page 169, where it
will be seen that the writer uses a similar “X”.</p>
<p>14 Holinshed’s Chronicles (1557) state that “Montioy, king-at-arms,
was sent to the King of England to defie him as the enemie of France,
and to tell him that he should shortlie have battell.” Moreover,
“Montioy” is not the personal name, but the official title of a Herald
of France, just as “Norroy” is not a personal name, but the official
title of one of the three chief Heralds of the College of Arms of
England.</p>

<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>It is with some hesitation that I give my husband’s last book to the
world. It was in type when he died, but he had no time to correct even
the first proofs, and doubtless he would have made many changes, if not
in his views at least in his expression of them. Mr. Bartram has
verified the quotations and dates with infinite care, and for this he
has my warmest thanks. For the rest I can but ask those who differ from
the author to remember the circumstances in which the work has been
published.</p>
<p>L. B. L.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The theory that Francis Bacon was, in the main, the author of
“Shakespeare’s plays,” has now been for fifty years before the learned
world. Its advocates have met with less support than they had reason to
expect. Their methods, their logic, and their hypotheses closely
resemble those applied by many British and foreign scholars to Homer;
and by critics of the very Highest School to Holy Writ. Yet the Baconian
theory is universally rejected in England by the professors and
historians of English literature; and generally by students who have no
profession save that of Letters. The Baconians, however, do not lack the
countenance and assistance of highly distinguished persons, whose names
are famous where those of mere men of letters are unknown; and in
circles where the title of “Professor” is not duly respected.</p>
<p>The partisans of Bacon aver (or one of them avers) that “Lord
Penzance, Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Palmerston, Judge Webb, Judge Holmes
(of Kentucky, U.S.), Prince Bismarck, John Bright, and innumerable most
thoughtful scholars eminent in many walks of life, and especially in the
legal profession . . . “ have been Baconians, or, at least, opposed to
Will Shakspere’s authorship. To these names of scholars I must add that
of my late friend, Samuel Clemens, D.Litt. of Oxford; better known to
many as Mark Twain. Dr. Clemens was, indeed, no mean literary critic;
witness his epoch-making study of Prof. Dowden’s Life of Shelley, while
his researches into the biography of Jeanne d’Arc were most
conscientious.</p>
<p>With the deepest respect for the political wisdom and literary taste
of Lord Palmerston, Prince Bismarck, Lord Beaconsfield, and the late
Mr. John Bright; and with every desire to humble myself before the
judicial verdicts of Judges Holmes, Webb, and Lord Penzance; with
sincere admiration of my late friend, Dr. Clemens, I cannot regard them
as, in the first place and professionally, trained students of literary
history.</p>
<p>They were no more specially trained students of Elizabethan
literature than myself; they were amateurs in this province, as I am an
amateur, who differ from all of them in opinion. Difference of opinion
concerning points of literary history ought not to make “our angry
passions rise.” Yet this controversy has been extremely bitter.</p>
<p>I abstain from quoting the “sweetmeats,” in Captain MacTurk’s phrase,
which have been exchanged by the combatants. Charges of ignorance and
monomania have been answered by charges of forgery, lying, “scandalous
literary dishonesty,” and even inaccuracy. Now no mortal is infallibly
accurate, but we are all sane and “indifferent honest.” There have been
forgeries in matters Shakespearean, alas, but not in connection with the
Baconian controversy.</p>
<p>It is an argument of the Baconians, and generally of the impugners of
good Will’s authorship of the plays vulgarly attributed to him, that the
advocates of William Shakspere, Gent, as author of the plays, differ
like the Kilkenny cats among themselves on many points. All do not
believe, with Mr. J. C. Collins, that Will knew Sophocles, Euripides,
and Æschylus (but not Aristophanes) as well as Mr. Swinburne did, or
knew them at all — for that matter. Mr. Pollard differs very widely from
Sir Sidney Lee on points concerning the First Folio and the Quartos: my
sympathies are with Mr. Pollard. Few, if any, partisans of Will agree
with Mrs. Stopes (herself no Baconian) about the history of the
Stratford monument of the poet. About Will’s authorship of Titus
Andronicus, and Henry VI, Part I, the friends of Will, like the friends
of Bacon, are at odds among themselves. These and other divergencies of
opinion cause the Baconians to laugh, as if they were a harmonious
circle . . . ! For the Baconian camp is not less divided against itself
than the camp of the “Stratfordians.” Not all Baconians hold that Bacon
was the legitimate son of “that Imperial otaress” Queen Elizabeth. Not
all believe in the Cryptogram of Mr. Ignatius Donnelly, or in any other
cryptograms. Not all maintain that Bacon, in the Sonnets, was inspired
by a passion for the Earl of Essex, for Queen Elizabeth, or for an early
miniature of himself. Not all regard him as the author of the plays of
Kit Marlowe. Not all suppose him to be a Rosicrucian, who possibly died
at the age of a hundred and six, or, perhaps, may be “still running.”
Not all aver that he wrote thirteen plays before 1593. But one party
holds that, in the main, Will was the author of the plays, while the
other party votes for Bacon — or for Bungay, a Great Unknown. I use
Bungay as an endearing term for the mysterious being who was the Author
if Francis Bacon was not. Friar Bungay was the rival of Friar Bacon, as
the Unknown (if he was not Francis Bacon) is the rival of “the inventor
of Inductive reasoning.”</p>
<p>I could never have expected that I should take a part in this
controversy; but acquaintance with The Shakespeare Problem Restated (503
pp.), (1908), and later works of Mr. G. G. Greenwood, M.P., has tempted
me to enter the lists.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood is worth fighting; he is cunning of fence, is learned
(and I cannot conceal my opinion that Mr. Donnelly and Judge Holmes were
rather ignorant). He is not over “the threshold of Eld” (as were Judge
Webb and Lord Penzance when they took up Shakespearean criticism). His
knowledge of Elizabethan literature is vastly superior to mine, for I
speak merely, in Matthew Arnold’s words, as “a belletristic
trifler.”</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Greenwood, as a practising barrister, is a judge of
legal evidence; and, being a man of sense, does not “hold a brief for
Bacon” as the author of the Shakespearean plays and poems, and does not
value Baconian cryptograms. In the following chapters I make endeavours,
conscientious if fallible, to state the theory of Mr. Greenwood. It is a
negative theory. He denies that Will Shakspere (or Shaxbere, or
Shagspur, and so on) was the author of the plays and poems. Some other
party was, in the main, with other hands, the author. Mr. Greenwood
cannot, or does not, offer a guess as to who this ingenious Somebody
was. He does not affirm, and he does not deny, that Bacon had a share,
greater or less, in the undertaking.</p>
<p>In my brief tractate I have not room to consider every argument; to
traverse every field. In philology I am all unlearned, and cannot
pretend to discuss the language of Shakespeare, any more than I can
analyse the language of Homer into proto-Arcadian and Cyprian, and so
on. Again, I cannot pretend to have an opinion, based on internal
evidence, about the genuine Shakespearean character of such plays as
Titus Andronicus, Henry VI, Part I, and Troilus and Cressida. About them
different views are held within both camps.</p>
<p>I am no lawyer or naturalist (as Partridge said, Non omnia possumus
omnes), and cannot imagine why our Author is so accurate in his frequent
use of terms of law — if he be Will; and so totally at sea in natural
history — if he be Francis, who “took all knowledge for his
province.”</p>
<p>How can a layman pretend to deal with Shakespeare’s legal
attainments, after he has read the work of the learned Recorder of
Bristol, Mr. Castle, K.C.? To his legal mind it seems that in some of
Will’s plays he had the aid of an expert in law, and then his
technicalities were correct. In other plays he had no such tutor, and
then he was sadly to seek in his legal jargon. I understand
Mr. Greenwood to disagree on this point. Mr. Castle says, “I think
Shakespeare would have had no difficulty in getting aid from several
sources. There is therefore no prima facie reason why we should suppose
the information was supplied by Bacon.”</p>
<p>Of course there is not!</p>
<p>“In fact, there are some reasons why one should attribute the legal
assistance, say, to Coke, rather than to Bacon.”</p>
<p>The truth is, that Bacon seems not to have been lawyer enough for
Will’s purposes. “We have no reason to believe that Bacon was
particularly well read in the technicalities of our law; he never seems
to have seriously followed his profession.”</p>
<p>Now we have Mr. Greenwood’s testimonial in favour of Mr. Castle, “Who
really does know something about law.” Mr. Castle thinks that Bacon
really did not know enough about law, and suggests Sir Edward Coke, of
all human beings, as conceivably Will’s “coach” on legal technicalities.
Perhaps Will consulted the Archbishop of Canterbury on theological
niceties?</p>
<p>Que sçais je? In some plays, says Mr. Castle, Will’s law is all
right, in other plays it is all wrong. As to Will’s law, when
Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Castle differ, a layman dare not intervene.</p>
<p>Concerning legend and tradition about our Will, it seems that, in
each case, we should do our best to trace the Quellen, to discover the
original sources, and the steps by which the tale arrived at its late
recorders in print; and then each man’s view as to the veracity of the
story will rest on his sense of probability; and on his bias, his wish
to believe or to disbelieve.</p>
<p>There exists, I believe, only one personal anecdote of Will, the
actor, and on it the Baconians base an argument against the contemporary
recognition of him as a dramatic author. I take the criticism of
Mr. Greenwood (who is not a Baconian). One John Manningham,
Barrister-at-Law, “a well-educated and cultured man,” notes in his Diary
(February 2, 1601) that “at our feast we had a play called Twelve Night
or What you Will, much like the Comedy of Errors, or Menæchmi n Plautus,
but most like and near to that in Italian called Inganni.” He confides
to his Diary the tricks played on Malvolio as “a good practice.” That is
all.</p>
<p>About the authorship he says nothing: perhaps he neither knew nor
cared who the author was. In our day the majority of people who tell me
about a play which they have seen, cannot tell me the name of the
author. Yet it is usually printed on the playbill, though in modest
type. The public does not care a straw about the author’s name, unless
he be deservedly famous for writing letters to the newspapers on things
in general; for his genius as an orator; his enthusiasm as a moralist,
or in any other extraneous way. Dr. Forman in his queer account of the
plot of “Mack Beth” does not allude to the name of the author (April 20,
1610). Twelfth Night was not published till 1623, in the Folio: there
was no quarto to enlighten Manningham about the author’s name. We do not
hear of printed playbills, with author’s names inserted, at that period.
It seems probable that occasional playgoers knew and cared no more about
authors than they do at present. The world of the wits, the critics
(such as Francis Meres), poets, playwrights, and players, did know and
care about the authors; apparently Manningham did not. But he heard a
piquant anecdote of two players and (March 13, 1601) inserted it in his
Diary.</p>
<p>Shakespeare once anticipated Richard Burbage at an amorous tryst with
a citizen’s wife. Burbage had, by the way, been playing the part of
Richard III. While Will was engaged in illicit dalliance, the message
was brought (what a moment for bringing messages!) that Richard III was
at the door, and Will “caused return to be made that William the
Conqueror was before Richard III. Shakespeare’s name William.” (My
italics.) Mr. Greenwood argues that if “Shakspere the player was known
to the world as the author of the plays of Shakespeare, it does seem
extremely remarkable” that Manningham should have thought it needful to
add “Shakespeare’s name William.”</p>
<p>But was “Shakspere,” or any man, “known to the world as the author of
the plays of Shakespeare”? No! for Mr. Greenwood writes, “nobody,
outside a very small circle, troubled his head as to who the dramatist
or dramatists might be.” To that “very small circle” we have no reason
to suppose that Manningham belonged, despite his remarkable opinion that
Twelfth Night resembles the Menæchmi. Consequently, it is not “extremely
remarkable” that Manningham wrote “Shakespeare’s name William,” to
explain to posterity the joke about “William the Conqueror,” instead of
saying, “the brilliant author of the Twelfth Night play which so much
amused me at our feast a few weeks ago.” “Remarkable” out of all hooping
it would have been had Manningham written in the style of Mr. Greenwood.
But Manningham apparently did not “trouble his head as to who the
dramatist or dramatists might be.” “Nobody, outside a very small
circle,” did trouble his poor head about that point. Yet Mr. Greenwood
thinks “it does seem extremely remarkable” that Manningham did not
mention the author.</p>
<p>Later, on the publication of the Folio (1623), the world seems to
have taken more interest in literary matters. Mr. Greenwood says that
then while “the multitude” would take Ben Jonson’s noble panegyric on
Shakespeare as a poet “au pied de la lettre,” “the enlightened few would
recognise that it had an esoteric meaning.” Then, it seems, “the world”
— the “multitude” — regarded the actor as the author. Only “the
enlightened few” were aware that when Ben said “Shakespeare,” and “Swan
of Avon,” he meant — somebody else.</p>
<p>Quite different inferences are drawn from the same facts by persons
of different mental conditions. For example, in 1635 or 1636, Cuthbert
Burbage, brother of Richard, the famous actor, Will’s comrade,
petitioned Lord Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, for consideration in a
quarrel about certain theatres. Telling the history of the houses, he
mentions that the Burbages “to ourselves joined those deserving men,
Shakspere, Heminge, Condell, Phillips and others.” Cuthbert is arguing
his case solely from the point of the original owners or lease-holders
of the houses, and of the well-known actors to whom they joined
themselves. Judge Webb and Mr. Greenwood think that “it does indeed seem
strange . . . that the proprietor[s] of the playhouses which had been
made famous by the production of the Shakespearean plays, should, in
1635 — twelve years after the publication of the great Folio — describe
their reputed author to the survivor of the Incomparable Pair, as merely
a ‘man-player’ and ‘a deserving man.’” Why did he not remind the Lord
Chamberlain that this “deserving man” was the author of all these famous
dramas? Was it because he was aware that the Earl of Pembroke “knew
better than that”?</p>
<p>These arguments are regarded by some Baconians as proof positive of
their case.</p>
<p>Cuthbert Burbage, in 1635 or 1636, did not remind the Earl of what
the Earl knew very well, that the Folio had been dedicated, in 1623, to
him and his brother, by Will’s friends, Heminge and Condell, as they had
been patrons of the late William Shakspere and admirers of his plays.
The terms of this dedication are to be cited in the text, later. We all
now would have reminded the Earl of what he very well knew. Cuthbert did
not.</p>
<p>The intelligence of Cuthbert Burbage may be gauged by anyone who will
read p–484 in William Shakespeare, His Family and Friends, by the late
Mr. Charles Elton, Q.C., of White Staunton. Cuthbert was a puzzle-pated
old boy. The silence as to Will’s authorship on the part of this
muddle-headed old Cuthbert, in 1635–36, cannot outweigh the explicit and
positive public testimony to his authorship, signed by his friends and
fellow-actors in 1623.</p>
<p>Men believe what they may; but I prefer positive evidence for the
affirmative to negative evidence from silence, the silence of Cuthbert
Burbage.</p>
<p>One may read through Mr. Greenwood’s three books and note the
engaging varieties of his views; they vary as suits his argument; but he
is unaware of it, or can justify his varyings. Thus, in 1610, one John
Davies wrote rhymes in which he speaks of “our English Terence, Mr. Will
Shakespeare”; “good Will.” In his period patriotic English critics
called a comic dramatist “the English Terence,” or “the English
Plautus,” precisely as American critics used to call Mr. Bryant “the
American Wordsworth,” or Cooper “the American Scott”; and as Scots
called the Rev. Mr. Thomson “the Scottish Turner.” Somewhere, I believe,
exists “the Belgian Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>Following this practice, Davies had to call Will either “our English
Terence,” or “our English Plautus.” Aristophanes would not have been
generally recognised; and Will was no more like one of these ancient
authors than another. Thus Davies was apt to choose either Plautus or
Terence; it was even betting which he selected. But he chanced to choose
Terence; and this is “curious,” and suggests suspicions to Mr. Greenwood
— and the Baconians. They are so very full of suspicions!</p>
<p>It does not suit the Baconians, or Mr. Greenwood, to find
contemporary recognition of Will as an author. Consequently,
Mr. Greenwood finds Davies’s “curious, and at first sight, inappropriate
comparison of ‘Shake-speare’ to Terence worthy of remark, for Terence is
the very author whose name is alleged to have been used as a mask-name,
or nom de plume, for the writings of great men who wished to keep the
fact of their authorship concealed.”</p>
<p>Now Davies felt bound to bring in some Roman parallel to Shakespeare;
and had only the choice of Terence or Plautus. Meres (1598) used
Plautus; Davies used Terence. Mr. Greenwood shows us that Plautus would
not do. “Could he” (Shakespeare) “write only of courtesans and cocottes,
and not of ladies highly born, cultured, and refined? . . .”</p>
<p>“The supposed parallel” (Plautus and Shakespeare) “breaks down at
every point.” Thus, on Mr. Greenwood’s showing, Plautus could not serve
Davies, or should not serve him, in his search for a Roman parallel to
“good Will.” But Mr. Greenwood also writes, “if he” (Shakespeare) “was
to be likened to a Latin comedian, surely Plautus is the writer with
whom he should have been compared.” Yet Plautus was the very man who
cannot be used as a parallel to Shakespeare. Of course no Roman nor any
other comic dramatist closely resembles the author of As You Like It.
They who selected either Plautus or Terence meant no more than that both
were celebrated comic dramatists. Plautus was no parallel to Will. Yet
“surely Plautus is the author to whom he should have been compared” by
Davies, says Mr. Greenwood. If Davies tried Plautus, the comparison was
bad; if Terence, it was “curious,” as Terence was absurdly accused of
being the “nom de plume” of some great “concealed poets” of Rome. “From
all the known facts about Terence,” says a Baconian critic (who has
consulted Smith’s Biographical Dictionary), “it is an almost unavoidable
inference that John Davies made the comparison to Shakspere because he
knew of the point common to both cases.” The common point is taken to
be, not that both men were famous comic dramatists, but that Roman
literary gossips said, and that Baconians and Mr. Greenwood say, that
“Terence” was said to be a “mask-name,” and that “Shakespeare” s a
mask-name. Of the second opinion there is not a hint in literature of
the time of good Will.</p>
<p>What surprises one most in this controversy is that men eminent in
the legal profession should be “anti-Shakesperean,” if not overtly
Baconian. For the evidence for the contemporary faith in Will’s
authorship is all positive; from his own age comes not a whisper of
doubt, not even a murmur of surprise. It is incredible to me that his
fellow-actors and fellow-playwrights should have been deceived,
especially when they were such men as Ben Jonson and Tom Heywood. One
would expect lawyers, of all people, to have been most impatient of the
surprising attempts made to explain away Ben Jonson’s testimony, by aid,
first, of quite a false analogy (Scott’s denial of his own authorship of
his novels), and, secondly, by the suppression of such a familiar fact
as the constant inconsistency of Ben’s judgments of his contemporaries
in literature. Mr. Greenwood must have forgotten the many examples of
this inconsistency; but I have met a Baconian author who knew nothing of
the fact. Mr. Greenwood, it is proper to say, does not seem to be
satisfied that he has solved what he calls “the Jonsonian riddle.”
Really, there is no riddle. About Will, as about other authors, his
contemporaries and even his friends, on occasion, Ben “spoke with two
voices,” now in terms of hyperbolical praise, now in carping tones of
censure. That is the obvious solution of “the Jonsonian riddle.”</p>
<p>I must apologise if I have in places spelled the name of the Swan of
Avon “Shakespeare” where Mr. Greenwood would write “Shakspere,” and vice
versa. He uses “Shakespeare” where he means the Author; “Shakspere”
where he means Will; and is vexed with some people who write the name of
Will as “Shakespeare.” As Will, in the opinion of a considerable portion
of the human race, and of myself, was the Author, one is apt to write
his name as “Shakespeare” in the usual way. But difficult cases occur,
as in quotations, and in conditional sentences. By any spelling of the
name I always mean the undivided personality of “Him who sleeps by
Avon.”</p>
<p>I. THE BACONIAN AND ANTI-WILLIAN POSITIONS</p>
<p>Till the years 1856–7 no voice was raised against the current belief
about Shakespeare (1564–1616). He was the author in the main of the
plays usually printed as his. In some cases other authors, one or more,
may have had fingers in his dramas; in other cases, Shakespeare may have
“written over” and transfigured earlier plays, of himself and of others;
he may have contributed, more or less, to several plays mainly by other
men. Separately printed dramas published during his time carry his name
on their title-pages, but are not included in the first collected
edition of his dramas, “The First Folio,” put forth by two of his
friends and fellow-actors, in 1623, seven years after his death.</p>
<p>On all these matters did commentators, critics, and antiquarians for
long dispute; but none denied that the actor, Will Shakspere (spelled as
heaven pleased), was in the main the author of most of the plays of
1623, and the sole author of Venus and Adonis, Lucrece, and the
Sonnets.</p>
<p>Even now, in England at least, it would be perhaps impossible to find
one special and professed student of Elizabethan literature, and of the
classical and European literatures, who does not hold by the ancient
belief, the belief of Shakespeare’s contemporaries and intimates, the
belief that he was, in the sense explained above, the author of the
plays.</p>
<p>But ours is not a generation to be overawed by “Authority” (as it is
called). A small but eager company of scholars have convinced themselves
that Francis Bacon wrote the Shakespearean plays. That is the point of
agreement among these enthusiasts: points of difference are numerous:
some very wild little sects exist. Meanwhile multitudes of earnest and
intelligent men and women, having read notices in newspapers of the
Baconian books, or heard of them at lectures and tea-parties, disbelieve
in the authorship of “the Stratford rustic,” and look down on the
faithful of Will Shakespere with extreme contempt.</p>
<p>From the Baconians we receive a plain straightforward theory, “Bacon
wrote Shakespeare,” as one of their own prophets has said. Since we have
plenty of evidence for Bacon’s life and occupations during the period of
Shakespearean poetic activity, we can compare what he was doing as a
man, a student, a Crown lawyer, a pleader in the Courts, a political
pamphleteer, essayist, courtier, active member of Parliament, and so on,
with what he is said to have been doing — by the Baconians; namely,
writing two dramas yearly.</p>
<p>But there is another “Anti-Willian” theory, which would dethrone Will
Shakspere, and put but a Shadow in his place. Conceive a “concealed
poet,” of high social position, contemporary with Bacon and Shakespeare.
Let him be so fond of the Law that he cannot keep legal “shop” out of
his love Sonnets even. Make him a courtier; a statesman; a philosopher;
a scholar who does not blench even from the difficult Latin of Ovid and
Plautus. Let this almost omniscient being possess supreme poetic genius,
extensive classical attainments, and a tendency to make false
quantities. Then conceive him to live through the reigns of “Eliza and
our James,” without leaving in history, in science, in society, in law,
in politics or scholarship, a single trace of his existence. He left
nothing but the poems and plays usually attributed to Will. As to the
date of his decease, we only know that it must necessarily have been
later than the composition of the last genuine Shakespearean play — for
this paragon wrote it.</p>
<p>Such is the Being who occupies, in the theory of the non-Baconian,
but not Anti-Baconian, Anti-Willians, the intellectual throne filled, in
the Will Shakespeare theory, by Will; and in the Baconian, by Bacon —
two kings of Brentford on one throne.</p>
<p>We are to be much engaged by the form of this theory which is held by
Mr. G. G. Greenwood in his The Shakespeare Problem Restated. In
attempting to explain what he means I feel that I am skating on very
thin ice. Already, in two volumes (In Re Shakespeare, 1909, and The
Vindicators of Shakespeare), Mr. Greenwood has accused his critics of
frequently misconceiving and misrepresenting his ideas: wherefore I also
tremble. I am perfectly confident in saying that he “holds no brief for
the Baconians.” He is not a Baconian. His position is negative merely:
Will of Stratford is not the author of the Shakespearean plays and
poems. Then who is? Mr. Greenwood believes that work by an unknown
number of hands exists in the plays first published all together in
1623. Here few will differ from him. But, setting aside this aspect of
the case, Mr. Greenwood appears to me to believe in an entity named
“Shakespeare,” or “the Author,” who is the predominating partner; though
Mr. Greenwood does not credit him with all the plays in the Folio of
1623 (nor, perhaps, with the absolute entirety of any given play). “The
Author” or “Shakespeare” is not a syndicate (like the Homer of many
critics), but an individual human being, apparently of the male sex. As
to the name by which he was called on earth, Mr. Greenwood is
“agnostic.” He himself is not Anti-Baconian. He does not oust Bacon and
put the Unknown in his place. He neither affirms nor denies that Bacon
may have contributed, more or less, to the bulk of Shakespearean work.
To put it briefly: Mr. Greenwood backs the field against the favourite
(our Will), and Bacon may be in the field. If he has any part in the
whole I suspect that it is “the lion’s part,” but Mr. Greenwood does not
commit himself to anything positive. We shall find (if I am not
mistaken) that Mr. Greenwood regards the hypothesis of the Baconians as
“an extremely reasonable one,” and that for his purposes it would be an
extremely serviceable one, if not even essential. For as Bacon was a
genius to whose potentialities one can set no limit, he is something to
stand by, whereas we cannot easily believe — I cannot believe — that the
actual “Author,” the “Shakespeare” lived and died and left no trace of
his existence except his share in the works called Shakespearean.</p>
<p>However, the idea of the Great Unknown has, for its partisans, this
advantage, that as the life of the august Shade is wholly unknown, we
cannot, as in Bacon’s case, show how he was occupied while the plays
were being composed. He must, however, have been much at Court, we
learn, and deep in the mysteries of legal terminology. Was he Sir Edward
Coke? Was he James VI and I?</p>
<p>It is hard, indeed, to set forth the views of the Baconians and of
the “Anti-Willians” in a shape which will satisfy them. The task,
especially when undertaken by an unsympathetic person, is perhaps
impossible. I can only summarise their views in my own words as far as I
presume to understand them. I conceive the Baconians to cry that “the
world possesses a mass of transcendent literature, attributed to a man
named William Shakespeare.” Of a man named William Shakspere (there are
many varieties of spelling) we certainly know that he was born (1564)
and bred in Stratford-on-Avon, a peculiarly dirty, stagnant, and
ignorant country town. There is absolutely no evidence that he (or any
Stratford boy of his standing) ever went to Stratford school. His
father, his mother, and his daughter could not write, but, in signing,
made their marks; and if he could write, which some of us deny, he wrote
a terribly bad hand. As far as late traditions of seventy or eighty
years after his death inform us, he was a butcher’s apprentice; and also
a schoolmaster “who knew Latin pretty well”; and a poacher. He made,
before he was nineteen, a marriage tainted with what Meg Dods calls
“ante-nup.” He early had three children, whom he deserted, as he
deserted his wife. He came to London, we do not know when (about 1582,
according to the “guess” of an antiquary of 1680); held horses at the
door of a theatre (so tradition says), was promoted to the rank of
“servitor” (whatever that may mean), became an actor (a vagabond under
the Act), and by 1594 played before Queen Elizabeth. He put money in his
pocket (heaven knows how), for by 1597 he was bargaining for the best
house in his native bourgade. He obtained, by nefarious genealogical
falsehoods (too common, alas, in heraldry), the right to bear arms; and
went on acting. In 1610–11 (?) he retired to his native place. He never
took any interest in his unprinted manuscript plays; though rapacious,
he never troubled himself about his valuable copyrights; never dreamed
of making a collected edition of his works. He died in 1616, probably of
drink taken. Legal documents prove him to have been a lender of small
sums, an avid creditor, a would-be encloser of commons. In his will he
does not bequeath or mention any books, manuscripts, copyrights, and so
forth. It is utterly incredible, then, that this man wrote the poems and
plays, so rich in poetry, thought, scholarship, and knowledge, which are
attributed to “William Shakespeare.” These must be the works of “a
concealed poet,” a philosopher, a courtier moving in the highest
circles, a supreme legist, and, necessarily, a great poet, and student
of the classics.</p>
<p>No known person of the age but one, Bacon, was a genius, a legist, a
scholar, a great poet, and brilliant courtier, with all the other
qualifications so the author of the plays either was Francis Bacon — or
some person unknown, who was in all respects equally distinguished, but
kept his light under a bushel. Consequently the name “William
Shakespeare” is a pseudonym or “pen-name” wisely adopted by Bacon (or
the other man) as early as 1593, at a time when William Shakspere was
notoriously an actor in the company which produced the plays of the
genius styling himself “William Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>Let me repeat that, to the best of my powers of understanding and of
expression, and in my own words, so as to misquote nobody, I have now
summarised the views of the Baconians sans phrase, and of the more
cautious or more credulous “Anti-Willians,” as I may style the party who
deny to Will the actor any share in the authorship of the plays, but do
not overtly assign it to Francis Bacon.</p>
<p>Beyond all comparison the best work on the Anti-Willian side of the
controversy is The Shakespeare Problem Restated, by Mr. G. G. Greenwood
(see my Introduction). To this volume I turn for the exposition of the
theory that “Will Shakspere” (with many other spellings) is an actor
from the country — a man of very scanty education, in all probability,
and wholly destitute of books; while “William Shakespeare,” or with the
hyphen, “Shake-speare,” is a “nom de plume” adopted by the Great Unknown
“concealed poet.”</p>
<p>When I use the word “author” here, I understand Mr. Greenwood to mean
that in the plays called “Shakespearean” there exists work from many
pens: owing to the curious literary manners, methods, and ethics of
dramatic writing in, say, 1589–1611. In my own poor opinion this is
certainly true of several plays in the first collected edition, “The
Folio,” produced seven years after Will’s death, namely in 1623. These
curious “collective” methods of play-writing are to be considered
later.</p>
<p>Matters become much more perplexing when we examine the theory that
“William Shake-speare” (with or without the hyphen), on the title-pages
of plays, or when signed to the dedications of poems, is the chosen
pen-name, or “nom de plume,” of Bacon or of the Unknown.</p>
<p>Here I must endeavour to summarise what Mr. Greenwood has written on
the name of the actor, and the “nom de plume” of the unknown author who,
by the theory, was not the actor. Let me first confess my firm belief
that there is no cause for all the copious writing about the spellings
“Shakespeare” or “Shake-speare” — as indicating the true but “concealed
poet” — and “Shakspere” (andandandandc.), as indicating the Warwickshire
rustic. At Stratford and in Warwickshire the clan-name was spelled in
scores of ways, was spelled in different ways within a single document.
If the actor himself uniformly wrote “Shakspere” (it seems that we have
but five signatures), he was accustomed to seeing the name spelled
variously in documents concerning him and his affairs. In London the
printers aimed at a kind of uniformity, “Shakespeare” or “Shake-speare”:
and even if he wrote his own name otherwise, to him it was indifferent.
Lawyers and printers might choose their own mode of spelling — and there
is no more in the matter.</p>
<p>I must now summarise briefly, in my own words, save where quotations
are indicated in the usual way, the results of Mr. Greenwood’s
researches. “The family of William Shakspere of Stratford” (perhaps it
were safer to say “the members of his name”) “wrote their name in many
different ways — some sixty, I believe, have been noted . . . but the
form ‘Shakespeare’ seems never to have been employed by them”; and,
according to Mr. Spedding, “Shakspere of Stratford never so wrote his
name ‘in any known case.’” (According to many Baconians he never wrote
his name in his life.) On the other hand, the dedications of Venus and
Adonis (1593) and of Lucrece (1594) are inscribed “William Shakespeare”
(without the hyphen). In 1598, the title-page of Love’s Labour’s Lost
“bore the name W. Shakespere,” while in the same year Richard II and
Richard III bear “William Shake-speare,” with the hyphen (not without
it, as in the two dedications by the Author). “The name which appears in
the body of the conveyance and of the mortgage bearing” (the actor’s)
“signature is ‘Shakespeare,’ while ‘Shackspeare’ appears in the will,
prepared, as we must presume, by or under the directions of Francis
Collyns, the Stratford solicitor, who was one of the witnesses thereto”
(and received a legacy of £13, 6s. 8d.).</p>
<p>Thus, at Stratford even, the name was spelled, in legal papers, as it
is spelled in the two dedications, and in most of the title-pages — and
also is spelled otherwise, as “Shackspeare.” In March 1594 the actor’s
name is spelled “Shakespeare” in Treasury accounts. The legal and the
literary and Treasury spellings (and conveyances and mortgages and wills
are not literature) are Shakespeare, Shackspeare, Shake-speare,
Shakespere — all four are used, but we must regard the actor as never
signing “Shakespeare” in any of these varieties of spelling — if sign he
ever did; at all events he is not known to have used the a in the last
syllable.</p>
<p>I now give the essence of Mr. Greenwood’s words concerning the nom de
plume of the “concealed poet,” whoever he was.</p>
<p>“And now a word upon the name ‘Shakespeare.’ That in this form, and
more especially with a hyphen, Shake-speare, the word makes an excellent
nom de plume is obvious. As old Thomas Fuller remarks, the name suggests
Martial in its warlike sound, ‘Hasti-vibrans or Shake-speare.’ It is of
course further suggestive of Pallas Minerva, the goddess of Wisdom, for
Pallas also was a spear-shaker (Pallas ὰπὸ του πάλλειν τὸ δόρυ); and all
will remember Ben Jonson’s verses . . . “ on Shakespeare’s “true-filed
lines” —</p>
<p>“In each of which he seems to shake a lance,</p>
<p>As brandished at the eyes of ignorance.”</p>
<p>There is more about Pallas in book-titles (to which additions can
easily be made), and about “Jonson’s Cri-spinus or Cri-spinas,” but
perhaps we have now the gist of Mr. Greenwood’s remarks on the
“excellent nom de plume” (cf. p–37. On the whole of this, cf. The
Shakespeare Problem Restated, p–295; a nom de plume called a
“pseudonym,” p, 312; Shakespeare “a mask name,” ; a “pseudonym,” ; “nom
de plume,” ).</p>
<p>Now why was the “nom de plume” or “pseudonym” “William Shakespeare”
“an excellent nom de plume” for a concealed author, courtier, lawyer,
scholar, and so forth? If “Shakespeare” suggested Pallas Athene, goddess
of wisdom and of many other things, and so was appropriate, why add
“William”?</p>
<p>In 1593, when the “pseudonym” first appears in Venus and Adonis, a
country actor whose name, in legal documents — presumably drawn up by or
for his friend, Francis Collyns at Stratford — is written “William
Shakespeare,” was before the town as an actor in the leading company,
that of the Lord Chamberlain. This company produced the plays some of
which, by 1598, bear “W. Shakespere,” or “William Shakespeare” on their
title-pages. Thus, even if the actor habitually spelled his name
“Shakspere,” “William Shakespeare” was, practically (on the Baconian
theory), not only a pseudonym of one man, a poet, but also the real name
of another man, a well-known actor, who was not the “concealed
poet.”</p>
<p>“William Shakespeare” or “Shakespere” was thus, in my view, the
ideally worst pseudonym which a poet who wished to be “concealed” could
possibly have had the fatuity to select. His plays and poems would be,
as they were, universally attributed to the actor, who is represented as
a person conspicuously incapable of writing them. With Mr. Greenwood’s
arguments against the certainty of this attribution I deal later.</p>
<p>Had the actor been a man of rare wit, and of good education and wide
reading, the choice of name might have been judicious. A “concealed
poet” of high social standing, with a strange fancy for rewriting the
plays of contemporary playwrights, might obtain the manuscript copies
from their owners, the Lord Chamberlain’s Company, through that
knowledgeable, witty, and venal member of the company, Will Shakspere.
He might then rewrite and improve them, more or less, as it was his whim
to do. The actor might make fair copies in his own hand, give them to
his company, and say that the improved works were from his own pen and
genius. The lie might pass, but only if the actor, in his life and witty
talk, seemed very capable of doing what he pretended to have done. But
if the actor, according to some Baconians, could not write even his own
name, he was impossible as a mask for the poet. He was also impossible,
I think, if he were what Mr. Greenwood describes him to be.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, in his view of the actor as he was when he came to
London, does not deny to him the gift of being able to sign his name.
But, if he were educated at Stratford Free School (of which there is no
documentary record), according to Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps “he was
removed from school long before the usual age,” “in all probability”
when “he was about thirteen” (an age at which some boys, later well
known, went up to their universities). If we send him to school at seven
or so, “it appears that he could only have enjoyed such advantages as it
may be supposed to have provided for a period of five or six years at
the outside. He was then withdrawn, and, as it seems, put to
calf-slaughtering.”</p>
<p>What the advantages may have been we try to estimate later.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, with Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, thinks that Will “could
have learned but little there. No doubt boys at Elizabethan grammar
schools, if they remained long enough, had a good deal of Latin driven
into them. Latin, indeed, was the one subject that was taught; and an
industrious boy who had gone through the course and attained to the
higher classes would generally be able to write fair Latin prose. But he
would learn very little else” (except to write fair Latin prose?). “What
we now call ‘culture’ certainly did not enter into the ‘curriculum,’ nor
‘English,’ nor modern languages, nor ‘literature.’”
Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps says that “removed prematurely from school,
residing with illiterate relatives in a bookless neighbourhood, thrown
into the midst of occupations adverse to scholastic progress — it is
difficult to believe that when he first left Stratford he was not all
but destitute of polished accomplishments.” Mr. Greenwood adds the
apprenticeship to a butcher or draper, but doubts the poaching, and the
frequent whippings and imprisonments, as in the story told by the
Rev. R. Davies in 1708.</p>
<p>That this promising young man, “when he came to London, spoke the
Warwickshire dialect or patois is, then, as certain as anything can be
that is incapable of mathematical proof.” “Here is the young
Warwickshire provincial . . . “ producing, apparently five or six years
after his arrival in town, Venus and Adonis . . . “Is it conceivable
that this was the work of the Stratford Player of whom we know so
little, but of whom we know so much too much? If so we have here a
veritable sixteenth-century miracle.” Moreover, “our great supposed poet
and dramatist had at his death neither book nor manuscript in his
possession, or to which he was legally entitled, or in which he had any
interest whatever.”</p>
<p>If it be not conceivable now that the rustic speaking in a patois
could write Venus and Adonis, manifestly it was inconceivable in 1593,
when Venus and Adonis was signed “William Shakespeare.” No man who knew
the actor (as described) could believe that he was the author, but there
does not exist the most shadowy hint proving that the faintest doubt was
thrown on the actor’s authorship; ignorant as he was, bookless, and rude
of speech. For such a Will as Mr. Greenwood describes to persuade the
literary and dramatic world of his age that he did write the plays,
would have been a miracle. Consequently Mr. Greenwood has to try to
persuade us that there is no sufficient evidence that Will did persuade,
say Ben Jonson, of his authorship and we shall see whether or not he
works this twentieth-century miracle of persuasion.</p>
<p>Of course if Will were unable to write even his name, as an
enthusiastic Baconian asserts, Mr. Greenwood sees that Will could not
easily pass for the Author. But his own bookless actor with a patois
seems to him, as author of Venus and Adonis, almost inconceivable. Yet,
despite Will’s bookless rusticity, this poem with Lucrece, which
displays knowledge of a work of Ovid not translated into English by
1593, was regarded as his own. I must suppose, therefore, that Will was
not manifestly so ignorant of Latin as Mr. Greenwood thinks. “I think it
highly probable,” says this critic, “that he attended the Grammar School
at Stratford” (where nothing but Latin was taught) “for four or five
years, and that, later in life, after some years in London, he was
probably able to ‘bumbast out a line,’ and perhaps to pose as ‘Poet-Ape
that would be thought our chief.’ Nay, I am not at all sure that he
would not have been capable of collaborating with such a man as George
Wilkins, and perhaps of writing quite as well as he, if not even better.
But it does not follow from this that he was the author either of Venus
and Adonis or of Hamlet.”</p>
<p>Nothing follows from all this: we merely see that, in Mr. Greenwood’s
private opinion, the actor might write even better than George Wilkins,
but could not write Venus and Adonis. Will, therefore, though bookless,
is not debarred here from the pursuits of literature, in partnership
with Wilkins. We have merely the critic’s opinion that Will could not
write Hamlet, even if, like Wordsworth, “he had the mind,” even if the
gods had made him more poetical than Wilkins.</p>
<p>Again, “he had had but little schooling; he had ‘small Latin and less
Greek’” (as Ben Jonson truly says), “but he was a good Johannes
Factotum; he could arrange a scene, and, when necessary, ‘bumbast out a
blank verse.’”</p>
<p>The “Johannes Factotum,” who could “bumbast out a blank verse,” is
taken from Robert Greene’s hackneyed attack on an actor-poet,
“Shake-scene,” published in 1592. “Poet-Ape that would be thought our
chief,” is from an epigram on an actor-poet by Ben Jonson (1601–16?). If
the allusions by Greene and Jonson are to our Will, he, by 1592, had a
literary ambition so towering that he thought his own work in the new
art of dramatic blank verse was equal to that of Marlowe (not to speak
of Wilkins), and Greene reckoned him a dangerous rival to three of his
playwright friends, of whom Marlowe is one, apparently.</p>
<p>If Jonson’s “Poet-Ape” be meant for Will, by 1601 Will would fain “be
thought the chief” of contemporary dramatists. His vanity soared far
above George Wilkins! Greene’s phrases and Jonson’s are dictated by
spite, jealousy, and envy; and from them a true view of the work of the
man whom they envy, the actor-poet, cannot be obtained. We might as well
judge Molière in the spirit of the author of Elomire Hypocondre, and of
de Visé! The Anti-Willian arguments keep on appearing, going behind the
scenes, and reappearing, like a stage army. To avoid this phenomenon I
reserve what is to be said about “Shake-scene” and “Poet-Ape” for
another place (p–145 infra). But I must give the reader a warning.
Concerning “William Shakespeare” as a “nom de plume,” or pseudonym,
Mr. Greenwood says, “Some, indeed, would see through it, and roundly
accuse the player of putting forth the works of others as his own. To
such he would be a ‘Poet-Ape,’ or ‘an upstart crow’ (Shake-scene)
‘beautified with the feathers of other writers.’”</p>
<p>If this be true, if “some would see through” (Mr. Greenwood,
apparently, means did “see through”) the “nom de plume,” the case of the
Anti-Willians is promising. But, in this matter, Mr. Greenwood se
trompe. Neither Greene nor Jonson accused “Shake-scene” or “Poet-Ape” of
“putting forth the works of others as his own.” That is quite certain,
as far as the scorns of Jonson and Greene have reached us. (See p–145
infra.)</p>
<p>If an actor, obviously incapable of wit and poetry, were credited
with the plays, the keenest curiosity would arise in “the profession,”
and among rival playwrights who envied the wealth and “glory” of the
actors. This curiosity, prompting the wits and players to watch and
“shadow” Will, would, to put it mildly, most seriously imperil the
secret of the concealed author who had the folly to sign himself
“William Shakespeare.” Human nature could not rest under such a
provocation as the “concealed poet” offered.</p>
<p>This is so obvious that had one desired to prove Bacon or the Unknown
to be the concealed author, one must have credited his mask, Will, with
abundance of wit and fancy, and, as for learning — with about as much as
he probably possessed. But the Baconians make him an illiterate yokel,
and we have quoted Mr. Greenwood’s estimate of the young Warwickshire
provincial.</p>
<p>We all have our personal equations in the way of belief. That the
plot of the “nom de plume” should have evaded discovery for a week, if
the actor were the untutored countryman of the hypotheses, is to me, for
one, absolutely incredible. A “concealed poet” looking about for a “nom
de plume” and a mask behind which he could be hidden, would not have
selected the name, or the nearest possible approach to the name, of an
ignorant unread actor. As he was never suspected of not being the author
of the plays and poems, Will cannot have been a country ignoramus,
manifestly incapable of poetry, wit, and such learning as the plays
exhibit. Every one must judge for himself. Mr. Greenwood fervently
believes in what I disbelieve.</p>
<p>“Very few Englishmen . . . in Elizabethan times, concerned themselves
at all, or cared one brass farthing, about the authorship of plays . . .
“ says Mr. Greenwood.</p>
<p>Very few care now. They know the actors’ names: in vain, as a rule,
do I ask playgoers for the name of the author of their entertainment.
But in Elizabeth’s time the few who cared were apt to care very much,
and they would inquire intensely when the Stratford actor, a bookless,
untaught man, was announced as the author of plays which were among the
most popular of their day. The seekers never found any other author.
They left no hint that they suspected the existence of any other author.
Hence I venture to infer that Will seemed to them no unread rustic, but
a fellow of infinite fancy, — no scholar to be sure, but very capable of
writing the pieces which he fathered.</p>
<p>They may all have been mistaken. Nobody can prove that Heywood and
Ben Jonson, and the actors of the Company, were not mistaken. But
certain it is that they thought the Will whom they knew capable of the
works which were attributed to him. Therefore he cannot possibly have
been the man who could not write, of the more impulsive Baconians; or
the bookless, and probably all but Latinless, man of Mr. Greenwood’s
theory. The positions already seem to me to be untenable.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE “SILENCE” ABOUT SHAKESPEARE</li>
</ol>
<p>Before proceeding further to examine Mr. Greenwood’s book, and the
Baconian theories, with the careful attention which they deserve, we
must clear the ground by explaining two points which appear to puzzle
Baconians, though, to be sure, they have their own solutions of the
problems.</p>
<p>The first question is: Why, considering that Shakespeare, by the
consent of the learned of most of the polite foreign nations, was one of
the world’s very greatest poets, have we received so few and such brief
notices of him from the pens of his contemporaries?</p>
<p>“It is wonderful,” exclaims Mr. Crouch-Batchelor, “that hundreds of
persons should not have left records of him. We know nearly as much
about the most insignificant writer of the period as we know of him, but
fifty times more about most of his contemporaries. It is senseless to
try to account for this otherwise than by recognising that the man was
not the author.”</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch-Batchelor is too innocent. He sees the sixteenth century
in the colours of the twentieth. We know nothing, except a few dates of
birth, death, entrance at school, College, the Inns of Court, and so
forth, concerning several of Shakespeare’s illustrious contemporaries
and successors in the art of dramatic poetry. The Baconians do not quite
understand, or, at least, keep steadily before their minds, one immense
difference between the Elizabethan age and later times. In 1590–1630,
there was no public excitement about the characters, personalities, and
anecdotage of merely literary men, poets, and playwrights, who held no
position in public affairs, as Spenser did; or in Court, Society, and
War, as Sidney did; who did not write about their own feuds and
friendships, like Greene and Nash; who did not expand into prefaces and
reminiscences, and satires, like Ben Jonson; who never killed anybody,
as Ben did; nor were killed, like Marlowe; nor were involved, like him,
in charges of atheism, and so forth; nor imprisoned with every chance of
having their ears and noses slit, like Marston. Consequently, silence
and night obscure the lives and personalities of Kyd, Chapman, Beaumont,
Fletcher, Dekker, Webster, and several others, as night and silence hide
Shakespeare from our view.</p>
<p>He was popular on the stage; some of his plays were circulated
separately in cheap and very perishable quartos. No collected edition of
his plays appeared during his life; without that he could not be
studied, and recognised in his greatness. He withdrew to the country and
died. There was no enthusiastic curiosity about him; nobody Boswellised
any playwright of his time. The Folio of 1623 gave the first opportunity
of studying him as alone he can be studied. The Civil Wars and the Reign
of the Saints distracted men’s minds and depressed or destroyed the
Stage.</p>
<p>Sir William Davenant, a boy when Shakespeare died, used to see the
actor at his father’s inn at Oxford, was interested in him, and
cherished the embers of the drama, which were fading before the theatres
were closed. Davenant collected what he could in the way of information
from old people of the stage; he told Shakespearean anecdotes in
conversation; a few reached the late day when uncritical inquiries
began, say 1680–90 at earliest. The memories of ancient people of the
theatre and clerks and sextons at Stratford were ransacked, to very
little purpose.</p>
<p>As these things were so, how can we expect biographical materials
about Shakespeare? As to the man, as to how his character impressed
contemporaries, we have but the current epithets: “friendly,” “gentle,”
and “sweet,” the praise of his worth by two of the actors in his company
(published in 1623), and the brief prose note of Ben Jonson, — this is
more than we have for the then so widely admired Beaumont, Ben Jonson’s
friend, or Chapman, or the adored Fletcher. “Into the dark go one and
all,” Shakespeare and the others. To be puzzled by and found theories on
the silence about Shakespeare is to show an innocence very odd in
learned disputants.</p>
<p>The Baconians, as usual, make a puzzle and a mystery out of their own
misappreciation of the literary and social conditions of Shakespeare’s
time. That world could not possibly appreciate his works as we do; the
world, till 1623, possessed only a portion of his plays in cheap
pamphlets, in several of these his text was mangled and in places
unintelligible. And in not a single instance were anecdotes and
biographical traits of playwrights recorded, except when the men
published matter about themselves, or when they became notorious in some
way unconnected with their literary works. Drummond, in Scotland, made
brief notes of Ben Jonson’s talk; Shakespeare he never met.</p>
<p>That age was not widely and enthusiastically appreciative of literary
merit in playwrights who were merely dramatists, and in no other way
notorious or eminent. Mr. Greenwood justly says “the contemporary
eulogies of the poet afford proof that there were some cultured critics
of that day of sufficient taste and acumen to recognise, or partly
recognise, his excellence . . . “ (Here I omit some words, presently to
be restored to the text.) From such critics the poet received such
applause as has reached us. We also know that the plays were popular;
but the audiences have not rushed to pen and ink to record their
satisfaction. With them, as with all audiences, the actors and the
spectacle, much more than the “cackle,” were the attractions. When
Dr. Ingleby says that “the bard of our admiration was unknown to the men
of that age,” he uses hyperbole, and means, I presume, that he was
unknown, as all authors are, to the great majority; and that those who
knew him in part made no modern fuss about him.</p>
<p>The second puzzle is, — Why did Shakespeare, conscious of his great
powers, never secure for his collected plays the permanence of print and
publication? We cannot be sure that he and his company, in fact, did not
provide publishers with the copy for the better Quartos or pamphlets of
separate plays, as Mr. Pollard argues on good grounds that they
sometimes did. For the rest, no dramatic author edited a complete
edition of his works before Ben Jonson, a scholarly man, set the example
in the year of Shakespeare’s, and of Beaumont’s death (1616). Neither
Beaumont nor Fletcher collected and published their works for the Stage.
The idea was unheard of before Jonson set the example, and much of his
work lay unprinted till years after his death. We must remember the
conditions of play-writing in Shakespeare’s time.</p>
<p>There were then many poets of no mean merit, all capable of admirable
verse on occasion; and in various degrees possessed of the lofty,
vigorous, and vivid style of that great age. The theatre, and writing
for the theatre, afforded to many men of talent a means of livelihood
analogous to that offered by journalism among ourselves. They were apt
to work collectively, several hands hurrying out a single play; and in
twos or threes, or fours or fives, they often collaborated.</p>
<p>As a general rule a play when finished was sold by the author or
authors to a company of players, or to a speculator like the notorious
Philip Henslowe, and the new owners, “the grand possessors,” were
usually averse to the publication of the work, lest other companies
might act it. The plays were primarily written to be acted. The company
in possession could have the play altered as they pleased by a literary
man in their employment.</p>
<p>To follow Mr. Greenwood’s summary of the situation “it would seem
that an author could restrain any person from publishing his manuscript,
or could bring an action against him for so doing, so long as he had not
disposed of his right to it; and that the publisher could prevent any
other publisher from issuing the work. At the same time it is clear that
the law was frequently violated . . . whether because of the difficulty
of enforcing it, or through the supineness of authors; and that in
consequence authors were frequently defrauded by surreptitious copies of
their works being issued by piratical publishers.”</p>
<p>It may appear that to “authors” we should, in the case of plays, add
“owners,” such as theatrical companies, for no case is cited in which
such a company brings an action against the publisher of a play which
they own. The two players of Shakespeare’s company who sign the preface
to the first edition of his collected plays (1623, “The First Folio”)
complain that “divers stolen and surreptitious copies” of single plays
have been put forth, “maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of
injurious impostors.” They speak as if they were unable to prevent, or
had not the energy to prevent, these frauds. In the accounts of the
aforesaid Henslowe, we find him paying forty shillings to a printer to
stop or “stay” the printing of a play, Patient Grizel, by three of his
hacks.</p>
<p>We perhaps come across an effort of the company to prevent or delay
the publication of The Merchant of Venice, on July 17, 1598, in the
Stationers’ Register. James Robertes, and all other printers, are
forbidden to print the book without previous permission from the Lord
Chamberlain, the protector of Will Shakespeare’s company. Two years
passed before Robertes issued the book. As is well known, Heywood, a
most prolific playwright, boasts that he never made a double sale of his
pieces to the players and the press. Others occasionally did, which
Heywood clearly thought less than honest.</p>
<p>As an author who was also an actor, and a shareholder in his company,
Will’s interests were the same as theirs. It is therefore curious that
some of his pieces were early printed, in quartos, from very good
copies; while others appeared in very bad copies, clearly surreptitious.
Probably the company gave a good MS. copy, sometimes, to a printer who
offered satisfactory terms, after the gloss of novelty was off the acted
play. In any case, we see that the custom and interests of the owners of
manuscript plays ran contrary to their early publication. In 1619 even
Ben Jonson, who loved publication, told Drummond that half of his
comedies were still unprinted.</p>
<p>These times were not as our own, and must not be judged by ours.
Whoever wrote the plays, the actor, or Bacon, or the Man in the Moon;
whoever legally owned the manuscripts, was equally incurious and
negligent about the preservation of a correct text. As we shall see
later, while Baconians urge without any evidence that Bacon himself
edited, or gave to Ben Jonson the duty of editing, the first collected
edition (1623), the work has been done in an indescribably negligent and
reckless manner, and, as Mr. Greenwood repeatedly states, the edition,
in his opinion, contains at least two plays not by his “Shakespeare” —
that “concealed poet” — and masses of “non-Shakespearean” work.</p>
<p>How this could happen, if Bacon (as on one hypothesis) either revised
the plays himself, or entrusted the task to so strict an Editor as Ben
Jonson, I cannot imagine. This is also one of the difficulties in
Mr. Greenwood’s theory. Thus we cannot argue, “if the actor were the
author, he must have been conscious of his great powers. Therefore the
actor cannot have been the author, for the actor wholly neglected to
collect his printed and to print his manuscript works.”</p>
<p>This argument is equally potent against the authorship of the plays
by Bacon. He, too, left the manuscripts unpublished till 1623. “But he
could not avow his authorship,” cry Baconians, giving various exquisite
reasons. Indeed, if Bacon were the author, he might not care to divulge
his long association with “a cry of players,” and a man like Will of
Stratford. But he had no occasion to avow it. He had merely to suggest
to the players, through any safe channel, that they should collect and
publish the works of their old friend Will Shakspere.</p>
<p>Thus indifferent was the main author of the plays, whether he were
actor or statesman; and the actor, at least, is not to blame for the
chaos of the first collected edition, made while he was in his grave,
and while Bacon was busy in revising and superintending Latin
translations of his works on scientific subjects.</p>
<p>We now understand why there are so few contemporary records of
Shakspere the man; and see that the neglect of his texts was extreme,
whether or not he were the author. The neglect was characteristic of the
playwrights of his own and the next generation. In those days it was no
marvel; few cared. Nine years passed before a second edition of the
collected plays appeared: thirty-two years went by before a third
edition was issued — years of war and tumult, yet they saw the
posthumous publication of the collected plays of Beaumont and
Fletcher.</p>
<p>There remains one more mystery connected with publication. When the
first collected edition of the plays appeared, it purported to contain
“All His Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies.” According to the postulate
of the Baconians it was edited by the Author, or by Jonson acting for
him. It contains several plays which, according to many critics, are not
the author’s. This, if true, is mysterious, and so is the fact that a
few plays were published, as by Shakespeare, in the lifetime both of the
actor and of Bacon; plays which neither acknowledged for his own, for we
hear of no remonstrance from — whoever “William Shakespeare” was. It is
impossible for me to say why there was no remonstrance.</p>
<p>Suppose that Will merely supplied Bacon’s plays, under his own name,
with a slight difference in spelling, to his company. It was as much his
interest, in that case, to protest when Bacon’s pen-name was taken in
vain, as if he had spelled his own surname with an a in the second
syllable.</p>
<p>There is another instance which Mr. Greenwood discusses twice. In
1599 Jaggard published “The Passionate Pilgrim; W. Shakespeare.” Out of
twenty poems, five only were by W. S. In 1612, Jaggard added two poems
by Tom Heywood, retaining W. Shakespeare’s name as sole author. “Heywood
protested” in print, “and stated that Shakespeare was offended, and,”
says Mr. Greenwood, “very probably he was so; but as he was, so I
conceive, ‘a concealed poet,’ writing under a nom de plume, he seems to
have only made known his annoyance through the medium of Heywood.”</p>
<p>If so, Heywood knew who the concealed poet was. Turning to p, 349, we
find Mr. Greenwood repeating the same story, with this addition, that
the author of the poems published by Jaggard, “to do himself right, hath
since published them in his own name.” That is, W. Shakespeare has since
published under his own name such pieces of The Passionate Pilgrim as
are his own. “The author, I know,” adds Heywood, “was much offended with
Mr. Jaggard that (altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold
with his name.”</p>
<p>Why was the author so slack when Jaggard, in 1599, published W. S.’s
poems with others not by W. S.?</p>
<p>How can anyone explain, by any theory? It was as open to him in 1599
as in 1612 to publish his own pieces under his own name, or
pen-name.</p>
<p>“Here we observe,” says Mr. Greenwood, “that Heywood does nothing to
identify ‘the author with the player.’” This is, we shall see, the
eternal argument. Why should Heywood, speaking of W. Shakespeare,
explain what all the world knew? There was no other W. Shakespeare (with
or without the e and a) but one, the actor, in the world of letters of
Elizabeth and James. Who the author was Heywood himself has told us,
elsewhere: the author was — Will!</p>
<p>But why Shakespeare was so indifferent to the use of his name, or,
when he was moved, acted so mildly, it is not for me or anyone to
explain. We do not know the nature of the circumstances in detail; we do
not know that the poet saw hopes of stopping the sale of the works
falsely attributed to him. I do not even feel certain that he had not a
finger in some of them. Knowing so little, a more soaring wit than mine
might fly to the explanation that “Shakespeare” was the “nom de plume”
of Bacon or his unknown equivalent, and that he preferred to “let
sleeping dogs lie,” or, as Mr. Greenwood might quote the Latin tag, said
ne moveas Camarinam.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THAT IMPOSSIBLE HE — THE SCHOOLING OF SHAKESPEARE</li>
</ol>
<p>The banner-cry of the Baconians is the word “Impossible!” It is
impossible that the actor from Stratford (as they think of him, a
bookless, untutored lad, speaking in patois) should have possessed the
wide, deep, and accurate scholarship displayed by the author of the
plays and poems. It is impossible that at the little Free School of
Stratford (if he attended it), he should have gained his wide knowledge
of the literatures of Greece and Rome. To these arguments, the orthodox
Stratfordian is apt to reply, that he finds in the plays and poems
plenty of inaccurate general information on classical subjects,
information in which the whole literature of England then abounded. He
also finds in the plays some knowledge of certain Latin authors, which
cannot be proved to have been translated at the date when Shakespeare
drew on them. How much Latin Shakespeare knew, in our opinion, will
presently be explained.</p>
<p>But, in reply to the Baconians and the Anti-Willians, we must say
that while the author of the plays had some lore which scholars also
possessed, he did not use his knowledge like a scholar. We do not see
how a scholar could make, as the scansion of his blank verse proves that
the author did make, the second syllable of the name of Posthumus, in
Cymbeline, long. He must have read a famous line in Horace thus,</p>
<p>“Eheu fugaces Posthoome, Posthoome!”</p>
<p>which could scarce ’scape whipping, even at Stratford Free School. In
the same way he makes the penultimate syllable of Andronicus short,
equally impossible.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, we shall see, denies to him Titus Andronicus, but also
appears to credit it to him, as one of the older plays which he
“revised, improved, and dressed,” and that is taken to have been all his
“authorship” in several cases. A scholar would have corrected, not
accepted, false quantities. In other cases, as when Greeks and Trojans
cite Plato and Aristotle in Troilus and Cressida, while Plato and
Aristotle lived more than a thousand years after the latest conceivable
date of the siege of Troy, I cannot possibly suppose that a scholar
would have permitted to himself the freak, any more than that in The
Winter’s Tale he should have borrowed from an earlier novel the
absurdity of calling Delphi “Delphos” (a non-existent word), of
confusing “Delphos” with Delos, and placing the Delphian Oracle in an
island. In the same play the author, quite needlessly, makes the artist
Giulio Romano (1492–1546) contemporary with the flourishing age of the
oracle of the Pythian Apollo. This, at least, would not be
ignorance.</p>
<p>We have, I think, sufficient testimony to Ben’s inability to refrain
from gibes at Shakspere’s want of scholarship. Rowe, who had traditions
of Davenant’s, tells how, in conversation with Suckling, Davenant,
Endymion Porter, and Hales of Eton, Ben harped on Will’s want of
learning; and how Hales snubbed him. Indeed, Ben could have made mirth
enough out of The Winter’s Tale. For, granting to Mr. Greenwood that
“the mention of Delphos suggests the Bohemia of a much earlier date, and
under the reign of Ottocar (1255–78) Bohemia extended from the Adriatic
to the shores of the Baltic,” that only makes matters far worse.
“Delphos” never was a place-name; there was no oracle on the isle of
“Delphos”; there were no Oracles in 1255–78 (A.D.); and Perdita, who
could have sat for her portrait to Giulio Romano, was contemporary with
an Oracle at Delphos, but not with Ottocar.</p>
<p>There never was so mad a mixture, not even in Ivanhoe; not even in
Kenilworth. Scott erred deliberately, as he says in his prefaces; but
Will took the insular oracle of Delphos from Greene, inserted Giulio
Romano “for his personal diversion,” never heard of Ottocar (no more
than I), and made a delightful congeries of errors in gaiety of heart.
Nobody shall convince me that Francis Bacon was so charmingly
irresponsible; but I cannot speak so confidently of Mr. Greenwood’s
Great Unknown, a severe scholar, but perhaps a frisky soul. There was no
region called Bohemia when the Delphic oracle was in vigour; — this
apology (apparently contrived by Sir Edward Sullivan) is the most comic
of erudite reflections.</p>
<p>Some cruel critic has censured the lovely speech of Perdita,
concerning the flowers which Proserpine let fall, when she was carried
off by Dis. How could she, brought up in the hut of a Bohemian shepherd,
know anything of the Rape of Proserpine? Why not, as she lived in the
days of the Delphic Oracle — and Giulio Romano, and of printed
ballads.</p>
<p>It is impossible, Baconians cry, that the rabbit-stealer, brought up
among the Audreys and Jaquenettas of Warwickshire, should have created
the noble and witty ladies of the Court; and known the style of his
Armado; and understood how dukes and kings talk among themselves —
usually in blank verse, it appears.</p>
<p>It is impossible that the home-keeping yokel should have heard of the
“obscure” (sic!) Court of Navarre; and known that at Venice there was a
place called the Rialto, and a “common ferry” called “the tranect.” It
is impossible that he should have had “an intimate knowledge of the
castle of Elsinore,” though an English troupe of actors visited Denmark
in 1587. To Will all this knowledge was impossible; for these and many
more exquisite reasons the yokel’s authorship of the plays is a physical
impossibility. But scholars neither invent nor tolerate such strange
liberties with time and place, with history, geography, and common
sense. Will Shakspere either did not know what was right, or, more
probably, did not care, and supposed, like Fielding in the old anecdote,
that the audience “would not find it out.” How could a scholar do any of
these things? He was as incapable of them as Ben Jonson. Such sins no
scholar is inclined to; they have, for him, no temptations.</p>
<p>As to Shakspere’s schooling, the Baconians point at the current
ignorance of Stratford-on-Avon, where many topping burgesses, even
aldermen, “made their marks,” in place of signing their names to
documents. Shakespeare’s father, wife, and daughter “made their marks,”
in place of signing. So did Lady Jane Gordon, daughter of the Earl of
Huntly, when she married the cultivated Earl of Bothwell (1566).</p>
<p>There is no evidence, from a roll of schoolboys at Stratford Free
Grammar School, about 1564–77, that any given boy attended it; for no
roll exists. Consequently there is no evidence that Will was a
pupil.</p>
<p>“In the Appendix to Malone’s Life of Shakespeare will be found two
Latin letters, written by alumni of Stratford School contemporary with
Shakespeare,” says Mr. Collins. But though the writers were Stratford
boys contemporary with Shakespeare, in later life his associates, as
there is no roll of pupils’ names how do we know, the Baconians may ask,
that these men were educated at Stratford School? Why not at Winchester,
Eton, St. Paul’s, or anywhere? Need one reply?</p>
<p>Mr. Collins goes on, in his simple confiding way, to state that “one
letter is by Abraham Sturley, afterwards an alderman of Stratford . . .
“ Pursuing the facts, we find that Sturley wrote in Latin to “Richard
Quiney, Shakespeare’s friend,” who, if he could read Sturley’s letter,
could read Latin. Then young Richard Quiney, apparently aged eleven,
wrote in Latin to his father. If young Richard Quiney be the son of
Shakespeare’s friend, Richard Quiney, then, of course, his Latin at the
age of eleven would only prove that, if he were a schoolboy at
Stratford, one Stratford boy could write Latin in the generation
following that of Shakespeare. Thus may reason the Baconians.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, we may say that if Stratford boys contemporary with
Shakspere, in his own rank and known to him, learned Latin, which they
retained in manhood, Shakspere, if he went to school with them, may have
done as much.</p>
<p>Concerning the school, a Free Grammar School, we know that during
Shakespeare’s boyhood the Mastership was not disdained by Walter Roche,
perhaps a Fellow of what was then the most progressive College in
learning of those at Oxford, namely, Corpus Christi. That Shakespeare
could have been his pupil is uncertain; the dates are rather difficult.
I think it probable that he was not, and we do not know the
qualifications of the two or three succeeding Masters.</p>
<p>As to the methods of teaching and the books read at Grammar Schools,
abundance of information has been collected. We know what the use was in
one very good school, Ipswich, from 1528; in another in 1611; but as we
do not possess any special information about Stratford School,
Mr. Greenwood opposes the admission of evidence from other academies. A
man might think that, however much the quality of the teaching varied in
various free schools, the nominal curriculum would be fairly
uniform.</p>
<p>As to the teacher, a good endowment would be apt to attract a capable
man. What was the endowment of Stratford School? It was derived from the
bequest of Thomas Jolyffe (died 1482), a bequest of lands in Stratford
and Dodwell, and before the Reformation the Brethren of the Guild were
“to find a priest fit and able in knowledge to teach grammar freely to
all scholars coming to him, taking nothing for their teaching . . . “
“The Founder’s liberal endowment made it possible to secure an income
for the Master by deed. Under the Reformation, Somerset’s Commission
found that the School Master had £10 yearly by patent; the school was
well conducted, and was not confiscated.”</p>
<p>Baconians can compare the yearly £20 (the salary in 1570–6, which
then went much further than it does now) with the incomes of other
masters of Grammar Schools, and thereby find out if the Head-Master was
very cheap. Mr. Elton (who knew his subject intimately) calls the
provision “liberal.” The Head-Master of Westminster had £20 and a
house.</p>
<p>As to the method of teaching, it was colloquial; questions were asked
and answered in Latin. This method, according to Dr. Rouse of Perse
School, brings boys on much more rapidly than does our current fashion,
as may readily be imagined; but experts vary in opinion. The method, I
conceive, should give a pupil a vocabulary. Lilly’s Latin Grammar was
universally used, and was learned by rote, as by George Borrow, in the
last century. See Lavengro for details. Conversation books, Sententiæ
Pueriles, were in use; with easy books, such as Corderius’s Colloquia,
and so on, for boys were taught to speak Latin, the common language of
the educated in Europe. Waifs of the Armada, Spaniards wrecked on the
Irish coast, met “a savage who knew Latin,” and thus could converse with
him. The Eclogues of Mantuanus, a Latin poet of the Renaissance (the
“Old Mantuan” of Love’s Labour’s Lost), were used, with Erasmus’s
Colloquia, and, says Mr. Collins, “such books as Ovid’s Metamorphoses”
(and other works of his), “the Æneid, selected comedies of Terence and
Plautus, and portions of Cæsar, Sallust, Cicero, and Livy.”</p>
<p>“Pro-di-gi-ous!” exclaims Mr. Greenwood, referring to what
Mr. Collins says Will had read at school. But precocious Latinity was
not thought “prodigious” in an age when nothing but Latin was taught to
boys — not even cricket. Nor is it to be supposed that every boy read in
all of these authors, still less read all of their works, but these were
the works of which portions were read. It is not prodigious. I myself,
according to my class-master, was “a bad and careless little boy” at
thirteen, incurably idle, but I well remember reading in Ovid and Cæsar,
and Sallust, while the rest of my time was devoted to the total neglect
of the mathematics, English “as she was taught,” History, and whatsoever
else was expected from me. Shakespeare’s time was not thus frittered
away; Latin was all he learned (if he went to school), and, as he was
(on my theory) a very clever, imaginative kind of boy, I can conceive
that he was intensely interested in the stories told by Ovid, and in
Catiline’s Conspiracy (thrilling, if you know your Sallust); and if his
interest were once aroused, he would make rapid progress. My own early
hatred of Greek was hissing and malignant, but as soon as I opened
Homer, all was changed. One was intensely interested!</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood will not, in the matter of books, go beyond
Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, “Lilly’s Grammar, and a few classical works
chained to the desks of the free schools.” Mr. Collins himself gives but
“a few classical books,” of which portions were read. The chains were in
all the free schools, if Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps is right. The chains,
if authentic, do not count as objections.</p>
<p>Here it must be noted that Mr. Greenwood’s opinion of Will’s
knowledge and attainments is not easily to be ascertained with
precision. He sees, of course, that the pretension of the extreme
Baconians — Will could not even write his name — is absurd. If he could
not write, he could not pass as the author. Mr. Greenwood “fears that
the arguments” (of a most extreme Baconian) “would drive many wandering
sheep back to the Stratfordian fold.”</p>
<p>He has therefore to find a via media, to present, as the
pseudo-author, a Will who possessed neither books nor manuscripts when
he made his Testament; a rustic, bookless Will, speaking a patois, who
could none the less pass himself off as the author. So “I think it
highly probable,” says Mr. Greenwood, “that he attended the Grammar
School at Stratford for four or five years, and that, later in life,
after some years in London, he was probably able to ‘bumbast out a
line,’ and perhaps to pose as ‘Poet-Ape who would be thought our
chief.’” Again, “He had had but little schooling; he had ‘small Latin
and less Greek’; but he was a good Johannes Factotum, he could arrange a
scene, and, when necessary, ‘bumbast out a blank verse.’”</p>
<p>But this is almost to abandon Mr. Greenwood’s case. Will appears to
me to be now perilously near acceptance as Greene’s “Shake-scene,” who
was a formidable rival to Greene’s three professional playwrights: and
quite as near to Ben’s Poet-Ape “that would be thought our chief,” who
began by re-making old plays; then won “some little wealth and credit on
the scene,” who had his “works” printed (for Ben expects them to reach
posterity), and whom Ben accused of plagiarism from himself and his
contemporaries. But this Shake-scene, this Poet-Ape, is merely our Will
Shakespeare as described by bitterly jealous and envious rivals. Where
are now the “works” of “Poet-Ape” if they are not the works of
Shakespeare which Ben so nobly applauded later, if they are not in the
blank verse of Greene’s Shake-scene? “Shakespeare’s plays” we call
them.</p>
<p>When was it “necessary” for the “Stratford rustic” to “bumbast out a
blank verse”? Where are the blank verses which he bumbasted out? For
what purposes were they bumbasted? By 1592 “Shake-scene” was ambitious,
and thought his blank verse as good as the best that Greene’s friends,
including Marlowe, could write. He had plenty of time to practise before
the date when, as Ben wrote, “he would be thought our chief.” He would
not cease to do that in which he conceived himself to excel; to write
for the stage.</p>
<p>When once Mr. Greenwood deems it “highly probable” that Will had four
or five years of education at a Latin school, Will has as much of
“grounding” in Latin, I think, as would account for all the knowledge of
the Roman tongue which he displays. His amount of teaching at school
would carry and tempt even a boy who was merely clever, and loved to
read romantic tales and comic plays, into Ovid and Plautus — English
books being to him not very accessible.</p>
<p>Here I may speak from my own memories, for though utterly idle where
set school tasks were concerned, I tried very early to worry the sense
out of Aristophanes — because he was said to contain good reading.</p>
<p>To this amount of taste and curiosity, nowise unexampled in an
ordinary clever boy, add Genius, and I feel no difficulty as to Will’s
“learning,” such as, at best, it was. “The Stratfordian,” says
Mr. Greenwood, “will ingeminate ‘Genius! Genius!’” I do say “Genius,”
and stand by it. The ordinary clever boy, in the supposed circumstances,
could read and admire his Ovid (though Shakespeare used cribs also), the
man of genius could write Venus and Adonis.</p>
<p>Had I to maintain the Baconian hypothesis, I would not weigh heavily
on bookless Will’s rusticity and patois. Accepting Ben Jonson’s account
of his “excellent phantasy, brave notions, and gentle expressions,
wherein he flowed with that facility . . . ,” accepting the tradition of
his lively wit; admitting that he had some Latin and literature, I would
find in him a sufficiently plausible mask for that immense Unknown with
a strange taste for furbishing up older plays. I would merely deny to
Will his genius, and hand that over to Bacon — or Bungay. Believe me,
Mr. Greenwood, this is your easiest way! — perhaps this is your way? —
the plot of the unscrupulous Will, and of your astute Bungay, might thus
more conceivably escape detection from the pack of envious
playwrights.</p>
<p>According to “all tradition,” says Mr. Greenwood, Shakespeare was
taken from school at the age of thirteen. Those late long-descended
traditions of Shakespeare’s youth are of little value as evidence; but,
if it pleases Mr. Greenwood, I will, for the sake of argument, accept
the whole of them. Assuredly I shall not arbitrarily choose among the
traditions: all depends on the genealogical steps by which they reach
us, as far as these can be discovered.</p>
<p>According to the tattle of Aubrey the antiquary, publishing in 1680,
an opinion concerning Shakspere’s education reached him. It came thus;
there had been an actor in Shakspere’s company, one Phillips, who, dying
in 1605, left to Shakspere the usual thirty-shilling piece of gold; and
the same “to my servant, Christopher Beeston.” Christopher’s son,
William, in 1640, became deputy to Davenant in the management of “the
King’s and Queen’s Young Company”, and through Beeston, according to
Aubrey, Davenant learned; through Beeston Aubrey learned, that
Shakespeare “understood Latin pretty well, for he had been in his
younger days a school-master in the country.” Aubrey writes that “old
Mr. Beeston, whom Mr. Dryden calls ‘the chronicle of the stage,’” died
in 1682.</p>
<p>This is a fair example of the genealogy of the traditions. Phillips,
a friend of Shakspere, dies in 1605, leaving a servant, Christopher
Beeston (he, too, was a versifier), whose son, William, dies in 1682; he
is “the chronicle of the stage.” Through him Davenant gets the story,
through him Aubrey gets the story, that Shakspere “knew Latin pretty
well,” and had been a rural dominie. Mr. Greenwood devotes much space to
disparaging Aubrey (and I do not think him a scientific authority, moult
s’en faut), but Mr. Greenwood here says not a word as to the steps in
the descent of the tradition. He frequently repeats himself, thereby
forcing me to more iteration than I like. He had already disparaged
Aubrey in note I to , but there he approached so closely to historical
method as to say that “Aubrey quotes Beeston, a seventeenth-century
actor, as his authority.” On he dismisses the anecdote (which does not
suit his book) as “a mere myth.” “He knows, he knows” which traditions
are mythical, and which possess a certain historical value.</p>
<p>My own opinion is that Shakspere did “know Latin pretty well,” and
was no scholar, as his contemporaries reckoned scholarship. He left
school, if tradition speak true, by a year later than the age, twelve,
when Bacon went to Cambridge. Will, a clever kind of lad (on my theory),
left school at an age when some other clever lads became freshmen. Why
not? Gilbert Burnet (of whom you may have heard as Bishop of Salisbury
under William III) took his degree at the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>Taking Shakspere as an extremely quick, imaginative boy, with nothing
to learn but Latin, and by the readiest road, the colloquial, I conceive
him to have discovered that, in Ovid especially, were to be found the
most wonderful and delightful stories, and poetry which could not but
please his “green unknowing youth.” In the years before he left
Stratford, and after he left school (1577–87?), I can easily suppose
that he was not always butchering calves, poaching, and making love; and
that, if he could get books in no other way, this graceless fellow might
be detected on a summer evening, knitting his brows over the stories and
jests of the chained Ovid and Plautus on his old schoolroom desk. Moi
qui parle, I am no genius; but stories, romance, and humour would
certainly have dragged me back to the old desks — if better might not
be, and why not Shakspere? Put yourself in his place, if you have ever
been a lad, and if, as a lad, you liked to steal away into the world of
romance, into fairyland.</p>
<p>If Will wrote the plays, he (and indeed whoever wrote the plays) was
a marvel of genius. But I am not here claiming for him genius, but
merely stating my opinion that if he were fond of stories and romance,
had no English books of poetry and romance, and had acquired as much
power of reading Latin as a lively, curious boy could easily gain in
four years of exclusively Latin education, he might continue his studies
as he pleased, yet be, so far, no prodigy.</p>
<p>I am contemplating Will in the conditions on which the Baconians
insist; if they will indeed let us assume that for a few years he was at
a Latin school. I credit the graceless loon with the curiosity, the
prompt acquisitiveness, the love of poetry and romance, which the author
of the plays must have possessed in youth. “Tradition says nothing of
all that,” the Baconian answers, and he may now, if he likes, turn to my
reply in The Traditional Shakespeare. Meanwhile, how can you expect old
clerks and sextons, a century after date, in a place where literature
was not of supreme interest, to retain a tradition that Will used to
read sometimes (if he did), in circumstances of privacy? As far as I am
able to judge, had I been a boy at Stratford school for four years, had
been taught nothing but Latin, and had little or no access to English
books of poetry and romance, I should have acquired about the same
amount of Latin as I suppose Shakspere to have possessed. Yet I could
scarcely, like him, have made the second syllable in “Posthumus” long!
Sir Walter Scott, however, was guilty of similar false quantities: he
and Shakspere were about equally scholarly.</p>
<p>I suppose, then, that Shakspere’s “small Latin” (as Jonson called it)
enabled him to read in the works of the Roman clerks; to read sufficient
for his uses. As a fact, he made use of English translations, and also
of Latin texts. Scholars like Bacon do not use bad translations of easy
Latin authors. If Bacon wanted Plutarch, he went to Plutarch in Greek,
not to an English translation of a French translation of a Latin
translation.</p>
<p>Some works of Shakespeare, the Lucrece, for example, and The Comedy
of Errors (if he were not working over an earlier canvas from a more
learned hand), and other passages, show knowledge of Latin texts which
in his day had not appeared in published translations, or had not been
translated at all as far as we know. In my opinion Will had Latin enough
to puzzle out the sense of the Latin, never difficult, for himself. He
could also “get a construe,” when in London, or help in reading, from a
more academic acquaintance: or buy a construe at no high ransom from
some poor scholar. No contemporary calls him scholarly; the generation
of men who were small boys when he died held him for no scholar. The
current English literature of his day was saturated with every kind of
classical information; its readers, even if Latinless, knew, or might
know a world of lore with which the modern man is seldom acquainted. The
ignorant Baconian marvels: the classically educated Baconian who is not
familiar with Elizabethan literature is amazed. Really there is nothing
worthy of their wonder.</p>
<p>Does any contemporary literary allusion to Shakespeare call him
“learned”? He is “sweet,” “honey-tongued,” “mellifluous,” and so forth,
but I ask for any contemporary who flattered him with the compliment of
“learned.” What Ben Jonson thought of his learning (but Ben’s standard
was very high), what Milton and Fuller, boys of eight when he died,
thought of his learning, we know. They thought him “Fancy’s child”
(Milton) and with no claims to scholarship (Fuller), with “small Latin
and less Greek” (Jonson). They speak of Shakespeare the author and
actor; not yet had any man divided the persons.</p>
<p>Elizabethan and Jacobean scholarly poets were widely read in the
classics. They were not usually, however, scholars in the same sense as
our modern scholarly poets and men of letters; such as Mr. Swinburne
among the dead, and Mr. Mackail and Sir Gilbert Murray — if I may be
pardoned for mentioning contemporary names. But Elizabethan scholarly
poets, and Milton, never regarded Shakespeare as learned. Perhaps few
modern men of letters who are scholars differ from them. The opinion of
Mr. Collins is to be discussed presently, but even he thought
Shakespeare’s scholarship “inexact,” as we shall see.</p>
<p>I conceive that Shakspere “knew Latin pretty well,” and, on Ben
Jonson’s evidence, he knew “less Greek.” That he knew any Greek is
surprising. Apparently he did, to judge from Ben’s words. My attitude
must, to the Baconians, seem frivolous, vexatious, and evasive. I cannot
pretend to know what was Shakspere’s precise amount of proficiency in
Latin when he was writing the plays. That between his own knowledge, and
construes given to him, he might easily get at the meaning of all the
Latin, not yet translated, which he certainly knew, I believe.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood says “the amount of reading which the lad Shakspere
must have done, and assimilated, during his brief sojourn at the Free
School is positively amazing.” But I have shown how an imaginative boy,
with little or no access to English poetry and romances, might continue
to read Latin “for human pleasure” after he left school. As a
professional writer, in a London where Latinists were as common as now
they are rare in literary society, he might read more, and be helped in
his reading. Any clever man might do as much, not to speak of a man of
genius. “And yet, alas, there is no record or tradition of all this
prodigious industry. . . . “ I am not speaking of “prodigious industry,”
and of that — at school. In a region so non-literary as, by his account,
was Stratford, Mr. Greenwood ought not to expect traditions of Will’s
early reading (even if he studied much more deeply than I have supposed)
to exist, from fifty to seventy years after Will was dead, in the
memories of the sons and grandsons of country people who cared for none
of these things. The thing is not reasonable.</p>
<p>Let me take one example of what Mr. E. A. Sonnenschein is quoted as
saying (somewhere) about Shakespeare’s debt to Seneca’s then
untranslated paper De Clementia (1, 3, 3; I, 7, 2; I, 6, I). It inspires
Portia’s speech about Mercy. Here I give a version of the Latin.</p>
<p>“Clemency becometh, of all men, none more than the King or chief
magistrate (principem) . . . No one can think of anything more becoming
to a ruler than clemency . . . which will be confessed the fairer and
more goodly in proportion as it is exhibited in the higher office . . .
But if the placable and just gods punish not instantly with their
thunderbolts the sins of the powerful, how much more just it is that a
man set over men should gently exercise his power. What? Holds not he
the place nearest to the gods, who, bearing himself like the gods, is
kind, and generous, and uses his power for the better? . . . Think . . .
what a lone desert and waste Rome would be, were nothing left, and none,
save such as a severe judge would absolve.”</p>
<p>The last sentence is fitted with this parallel in Portia’s
speech:</p>
<p>“Consider this</p>
<p>That in the course of Justice none of us</p>
<p>Should see salvation.”</p>
<p>Here, at least, Protestant theology, not Seneca, inspires Portia’s
eloquence.</p>
<p>Now take Portia:</p>
<p>“The quality of Mercy is not strain’d;</p>
<p>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</p>
<p>Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;</p>
<p>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes;”</p>
<p>(Not much Seneca, so far!)</p>
<p>“’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes</p>
<p>The thronèd monarch better than his crown;</p>
<p>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</p>
<p>The attribute to awe and majesty,</p>
<p>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</p>
<p>But Mercy is above this sceptred sway,</p>
<p>It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings,</p>
<p>It is an attribute to God himself;</p>
<p>And earthly power doth then show likest God’s,</p>
<p>When mercy seasons justice . . .”</p>
<p>There follows the passage about none of us seeing salvation, already
cited, and theological in origin.</p>
<p>Whether Shakespeare could or could not have written these
reflections, without having read Seneca’s De Clementia, whether, if he
could not conceive the ideas “out of his own head,” he might not hear
Seneca’s words translated in a sermon, or in conversation, or read them
cited in an English book, each reader must decide for himself. Nor do I
doubt that Shakespeare could pick out what he wanted from the Latin if
he cast his eye over the essay of the tutor of Nero.</p>
<p>My view of Shakespeare’s Latinity is much like that of Sir Walter
Raleigh. As far as I am aware, it is the opinion usually held by people
who approach the subject, and who have had a classical education. An
exception was the late Mr. Churton Collins, whose ideas are discussed in
the following chapter.</p>
<p>In his youth, and in the country, Will could do what Hogg and Burns
did (and Hogg had no education at all; he was self-taught, even in
writing). Will could pick up traditional, oral, popular literature. “His
plays,” says Sir Walter Raleigh, “are extraordinarily rich in the
floating debris of popular literature, — scraps and tags and broken ends
of songs and ballads and romances and proverbs. In this respect he is
notable even among his contemporaries. . . . Edgar and Iago, Petruchio
and Benedick, Sir Toby and Pistol, the Fool in Lear and the Grave-digger
in Hamlet, even Ophelia and Desdemona, are all alike singers of old
songs. . . . “ He is rich in rural proverbs not recorded in Bacon’s
Promus.</p>
<p>Shakespeare in the country, like Scott in Liddesdale, “was making
himself all the time.”</p>
<p>The Baconian will exclaim that Bacon was familiar with many now
obsolete rural words. Bacon, too, may have had a memory rich in all the
tags of song, ballad, story, and dicton. But so may Shakespeare.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MR. COLLINS ON SHAKESPEARE’S LEARNING</li>
</ol>
<p>That Shakspere, whether “scholar” or not, had a very wide and deep
knowledge both of Roman literature and, still more, of the whole field
of the tragic literature of Athens, is a theory which Mr. Greenwood
seems to admire in that “violent Stratfordian,” Mr. Churton Collins. I
think that Mr. Collins did not persuade classical scholars who have
never given a thought to the Baconian belief, but who consider on their
merits the questions: Does Shakespeare show wide classical knowledge?
Does he use his knowledge as a scholar would use it?</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Collins, as I may have to say again, was a very wide
reader of poetry, with a memory like Macaulay’s. It was his native
tendency to find coincidences in poetic passages (which, to some, to me
for example, did not often seem coincidental); and to explain
coincidences by conscious or subconscious borrowing. One remarked in him
these tendencies long before he wrote on the classical acquirements of
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>While Mr. Collins tended to account for similarities in the work of
authors by borrowing, my tendency was to explain them as undesigned
coincidences. The question is of the widest range. Some inquirers
explain the often minute coincidences in myths, popular tales, proverbs,
and riddles, found all over the world, by diffusion from a single centre
(usually India). Others, like myself, do not deny cases of transmission,
but in other cases see spontaneous and independent, though coincident
invention. I do not believe that the Arunta of Central Australia
borrowed from Plutarch the central feature of the myth of Isis and
Osiris.</p>
<p>It is not on Shakespeare’s use, now and then, of Greek and Latin
models and sources, but on coincidences detected by Mr. Collins himself,
and not earlier remarked, that he bases his belief in the saturation of
Shakespeare’s mind with Roman and Athenian literature. Consequently we
can only do justice to Mr. Collins’s system, if we compare example after
example of his supposed instances of Shakespeare’s borrowing. This is a
long and irksome task; and the only fair plan is for the reader to
peruse Mr. Collins’s Studies in Shakespeare, compare the Greek and Roman
texts, and weigh each example of supposed borrowing for himself.
Baconians must delight in this labour.</p>
<p>I shall waive the question whether it were not possible for
Shakespeare to obtain a view of the manuscript translation of plays of
Plautus made by Warner for his unlearned friends, and so to use the
Menæchmi as the model of The Comedy of Errors. He does not borrow
phrases from it, as he does from North’s Plutarch.</p>
<p>Venus and Adonis owes to Ovid, at most, but ideas for three purple
patches, scattered in different parts of the Metamorphoses. Lucrece is
based on the then untranslated Fasti of Ovid. I do not think Shakespeare
incapable of reading such easy Latin for himself; or too proud to ask
help from a friend, or buy it from some poor young University man in
London. That is a simple and natural means by which he could help
himself when in search of a subject for a play or poem; and ought not to
be overlooked.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, in his rapturous account of Shakespeare’s wide and
profound knowledge of the classics, opens with the remark: “Nothing
which Shakespeare has left us warrants us in pronouncing with certainty
that he read the Greek classics in the original, or even that he
possessed enough Greek to follow the Latin versions of those classics in
the Greek text.” In that case, how did Shakespeare’s English become
contaminated, as Mr. Collins says it did, with Greek idioms, while he
only knew the Greek plays through Latin translations?</p>
<p>However this is to be answered, Mr. Collins proceeds to prove
Shakespeare’s close familiarity with Latin and with Greek dramatic
literature by a method of which he knows the perils— “it is always
perilous to infer direct imitation from parallel passages which may be
mere coincidences.” Yet this method is what he practises throughout;
with what amount of success every reader must judge for himself.</p>
<p>He thinks it “surely not unlikely” that Polonius’s</p>
<p>“Neither a borrower nor a lender be:</p>
<p>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,”</p>
<p>may be a terse reminiscence of seven lines in Plautus (Trinummus, iv.
3). Why, Polonius is a coiner of commonplaces, and if ever there were a
well-known reflection from experience it is this of the borrowers and
lenders.</p>
<p>Next, take this of Plautus (Pseudolus, I, iv. 7–10), “But just as the
poet when he has taken up his tablets seeks what exists nowhere among
men, and yet finds it, and makes that like truth which is mere fiction.”
We are to take this as the possible germ of Theseus’s theory of the
origin of the belief in fairies:</p>
<p>“And as imagination bodies forth</p>
<p>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</p>
<p>Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing</p>
<p>A local habitation and a name.”</p>
<p>The reasoning is odd; imagination bodies forth forms, and the poet’s
pen turns them to shapes. But to suppose that Shakespeare here borrowed
from Plautus appears highly superfluous.</p>
<p>These are samples of Mr. Collins’s methods throughout.</p>
<p>Of Terence there were translations — first in part; later, in 1598,
of the whole. Of Seneca there was an English version (1581). Mr. Collins
labours to show that one passage “almost certainly” implies
Shakespeare’s use of the Latin; but it was used “by an inexact scholar,”
— a terribly inexact scholar, if he thought that “alienus” (“what
belongs to another”) meant “slippery”!</p>
<p>Most of the passages are from plays (Titus Andronicus and Henry VI,
i., ii., iii.), which Mr. Greenwood denies (usually) to his author, the
Great Unknown. Throughout these early plays Mr. Collins takes
Shakespeare’s to resemble Seneca’s Latin style: Shakespeare, then, took
up Greek tragedy in later life; after the early period when he dealt
with Seneca. Here is a sample of borrowing from Horace, “Persicos odi
puer apparatus” (Odes. I, xxxviii. I). Mr. Collins quotes Lear (III, vi.
85) thus, “You will say they are Persian attire.” Really, Lear in his
wild way says to Edgar, “I do not like the fashion of your garments: you
will say they are Persian; but let them be changed.” Mr. Collins changes
this into “you will say they are Persian attire,” a phrase “which could
only have occurred to a classical scholar.” The phrase is not in
Shakespeare, and Lear’s wandering mind might as easily select “Persian”
as any other absurdity.</p>
<p>So it is throughout. Two great poets write on the fear of death, on
the cries of new-born children, on dissolution and recombination in
nature, on old age; they have ideas in common, obvious ideas, glorified
by poetry, — and Shakespeare, we are told, is borrowing from Lucretius
or Juvenal; while the critic leaves his reader to find out and study the
Latin passages which he does not quote. So arbitrary is taste in these
matters that Mr. Collins, like Mr. Grant White, but independently, finds
Shakespeare putting a thought from the Alcibiades I of Plato into the
mouth of Achilles in Troilus and Cressida, while Mr. J. M. Robertson
suggests that the borrowing is from Seneca — where Mr. Collins does not
find “the smallest parallel.” Mr. Collins is certainly right; the author
of Troilus makes Ulysses quote Plato as “the author” of a remark, and
makes Achilles take up the quotation, which Ulysses goes on to
criticise.</p>
<p>Thus, in this play, not only Aristotle (as Hector says) but Plato are
taken to have lived before the Trojan war, and to have been read by the
Achæans!</p>
<p>There were Latin translations of Plato; the Alcibiades I was
published apart, from Ficinus’ version, in 1560, with the sub-title,
Concerning the Nature of Man. Who had read it? — Shakespeare, or one of
the two authors (Dekker and Chettle) of another Troilus and Cressida
(now lost), or Bacon, or Mr. Greenwood’s Unknown? Which of these
Platonists chose to say that Plato and Aristotle lived long before
Homer? Which of them followed the Ionic and mediæval anti-Achæan view of
Homer’s heroes, as given in the Troy Books of the Middle Ages, and yet
knew Iliad, Book VII, and admired Odysseus, whom the Ionian tradition
abhors? Troilus and Cressida is indeed a mystery, but Somebody concerned
in it had read Ficinus’ version of the Alcibiades; and yet made the
monstrous anachronism of dating Aristotle and Plato before the Trojan
war. “That was his fun,” as Charles Lamb said in another connection.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, it is plain, goes much further than the “small Latin”
with which his age (like myself) credited Shakespeare. He could read
Latin, Mr. Collins thinks, as easily as an educated Briton reads French
— that is, as easily as he reads English. Still further, Shakespeare,
through Latin translations, was so saturated with the Greek drama “that
the characteristics which differentiate his work from the work of his
contemporaries and recall in essentials the work of the Greek dramatists
are actually attributable to these dramatists.”</p>
<p>Ben Jonson, and all the more or less well-taught University wits, as
far as I remember, like Greene, Marlowe, and Lyly, do not show much
acquaintance with Euripides, Æschylus, Sophocles, and do not often
remind us of these masters. Shakespeare does remind us of them — the
only question is, do the resemblances arise from his possession of a
genius akin to that of Greece, or was his memory so stored with all the
treasures of their art that the waters of Helicon kept bubbling up
through the wells of Avon?</p>
<p>But does Mr. Collins prove (what, as he admits, cannot be
demonstrated) that Shakespeare was familiar with the Attic tragedians?
He begins by saying that he will not bottom his case “on the ground of
parallels in sentiment and reflection, which, as they express
commonplaces, are likely to be” (fortuitous) “coincidences.” Three pages
of such parallels, all from Sophocles, therefore follow. “Curiously
close similarities of expression” are also barred. Four pages of
examples therefore follow, from Sophocles and Æschylus, plays and
fragments, Euripides, and Homer too (once!). Again, “identities of
sentiment under similar circumstances” are not to be cited; two pages
are cited; and “similarities, however striking they may be in
metaphorical expression,” cannot safely be used; several pages of them
follow.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Collins chooses a single play, the Aias of Sophocles,
and tests Shakespeare by that, unluckily in part from Titus Andronicus,
which Mr. Greenwood regards (usually) as non-Shakespearean, or not by
his unknown great author. Troilus and Cressida, whatever part
Shakespeare may have had in it, does suggest to me that the author or
authors knew of Homer no more than the few books of the Iliad, first
translated by Chapman and published in 1598. But he or they did know the
Aias of Sophocles, according to Mr. Collins: so did the author of Romeo
and Juliet.</p>
<p>Now all these sorts of parallels between Shakespeare and the Greeks
are, Mr. Collins tells us, not to count as proofs that Shakespeare knew
the Greek tragedians. “We have obviously to be on our guard” against
three kinds of such parallels, which “may be mere coincidences,”
fortuitous coincidences. But these coincidences against which “we must
be on our guard” fill sixteen pages (p–63). These pages must necessarily
produce a considerable effect in the way of persuading the reader that
Shakespeare knew the Greek tragedians as intimately as Mr. Collins did.
Mr. Greenwood is obliged to leave these parallels to readers of
Mr. Collins’s essay. Indeed, what more can we do? Who would read through
a criticism of each instance? Two or three may be given. The Queen in
Hamlet reminds that prince, grieving for his father’s death, that “all
that live must die”:</p>
<p>“That loss is common to the race,</p>
<p>And common is the common-place.”</p>
<p>The Greek Chorus offers the commonplace to Electra, — and here is a
parallel! Again, two Greeks agree with Shakespeare that anxious
expectation of evil is worse than actual experience thereof. Greece
agrees with Shakespeare that ill-gotten gains do not thrive, or that it
is not lucky to be “a corby messenger” of bad news; or that all goes ill
when a man acts against his better nature; or that we suffer most from
the harm which we bring on ourselves; or that there is strength in a
righteous cause; or that blood calls for blood (an idea common to
Semites, Greeks, and English readers of the Bible); or that, having lost
a very good man, you will not soon see his like again, — and so on as
long as you please. Of such wisdom are proverbs made, and savages and
Europeans have many parallel proverbs. Vestigia nulla retrorsum is as
well known to Bushmen as to Latinists. Manifestly nothing in this kind
proves, or even suggests, that Shakespeare was saturated in Greek
tragedy. But page on page of such facts as that both Shakespeare and
Sophocles talk, one of “the belly-pinched wolf,” the other of “the
empty-bellied wolf,” are apt to impress the reader — and verily both
Shakespeare and Æschylus talk of “the heart dancing for joy.”
Mr. Collins repeats that such things are no proof, but he keeps on
piling them up. It was a theory of Shakespeare’s time that the apparent
ghost of a dead man might be an impersonation of him by the devil.
Hamlet knows this —</p>
<p>“The spirit that I have seen may be the devil.”</p>
<p>Orestes (Electra, Euripides) asks whether it may not be an avenging
dæmon (alastor) in the shape of a god, that bids him avenge his father.
Is Shakespeare borrowing from Euripides, or from a sermon, or any
contemporary work on ghosts, such as that of Lavater?</p>
<p>A girl dies or is sacrificed before her marriage, and characters in
Romeo and Juliet, and in Euripides, both say that Death is her
bridegroom. Anyone might say that, anywhere, as in the Greek Anthology
—</p>
<p>“For Death not for Love hast thou loosened thy zone.”</p>
<p>One needs the space of a book wherein to consider such parallels. But
confessedly, though a parade is made of them, they do not prove that
Shakespeare constantly read Greek tragedies in Latin translations.</p>
<p>To let the truth out, the resemblances are mainly found in such
commonplaces: as when both Aias and Antony address the Sun of their
latest day in life; or when John of Gaunt and Aias both pun on their own
names.</p>
<p>The situations, in Hamlet and the Choephoræ and Electra, are so close
that resemblances in some passages must and do occur, and Mr. Collins
does not comment specially upon the closest resemblance of all: the
English case is here the murder of Duncan, the Greek is the murder of
Agamemnon.</p>
<p>Now it would be easy for me to bring forward many close parallels
between Homer and the old Irish epic story of Cuchulainn, between Homer
and Beowulf and the Njal’s saga, yet Norsemen and the early Irish were
not students of Homer! The parallel passages in Homer, on one side, and
the Old Irish Tain Bo Cualgne, and the Anglo-Saxon epics, are so
numerous and close that the theory of borrowing from Homer has actually
occurred to a distinguished Greek scholar. But no student of Irish and
Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry has been found, I think, to suggest that Early
Irish and Anglo-Saxon Court minstrels knew Greek. The curious may
consult Mr. Munro Chadwick’s The Heroic Age (1912), especially Chapter
XV, “The Common Characteristics of Teutonic and Greek Heroic Poetry,”
and to what Mr. Chadwick says much might be added.</p>
<p>But, to be short, Mr. Collins’s case can only be judged by readers of
his most interesting Studies in Shakespeare. To me, Hamlet’s soliloquy
on death resembles a fragment from the Phœnix of Euripides no more
closely than two sets of reflections by great poets on the text that “of
death we know nothing” are bound to do, — though Shakespeare’s are
infinitely the richer. For Shakespeare’s reflections on death, save
where Christians die in a Christian spirit, are as agnostic as those of
the post-Æschylean Greek and early Anglo-Saxon poets. In many respects,
as Mr. Collins proves, Shakespeare’s highest and deepest musings are
Greek in tone. But of all English poets he who came nearest to Greece in
his art was Keats, who of Greek knew nothing. In the same way, a
peculiar vein of Anglo-Saxon thought, in relation to Destiny and Death,
is purely Homeric, though necessarily unborrowed; nor were a native
Fijian poet’s lines on old age, sine amore jocisque, borrowed from
Mimnermus! There is such a thing as congruity of genius. Mr. Collins
states the hypothesis — not his own— “that by a certain natural affinity
Shakespeare caught also the accent and tone as well as some of the most
striking characteristics of Greek tragedy.”</p>
<p>Though far from accepting most of Mr. Collins’s long array of Greek
parallels, I do hold that by “natural affinity,” by congruity of genius,
Shakespeare approached and resembled the great Athenians.</p>
<p>One thing seems certain to me. If Shakspere read and borrowed from
Greek poetry, he knew it as well (except Homer) as Mr. Collins knew it;
and remembered what he knew with Mr. Collins’s extraordinary tenacity of
memory.</p>
<p>Now if “Shakespeare” did all that, he was not the actor. The author,
on Mr. Collins’s showing, must have been a very sedulous and diligent
student of Greek poetry, above all of the drama, down to its fragments.
The Baconians assuredly ought to try to prove, from Bacon’s works, that
he was such a student.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, “a violent Stratfordian,” overproved his case. If his
proofs be accepted, Shakspere the actor knew the Greek tragedians as
well as did Mr. Swinburne. If the author of the plays were so learned,
the actor was not the author, in my opinion — he was, in the opinion of
Mr. Collins.</p>
<p>If Shakespeare’s spirit and those of Sophocles and Æschylus meet, it
is because they move on the same heights, and thence survey with “the
poet’s sad lucidity” the same “pageant of men’s miseries.” But how
dissimilar in expression Shakespeare can be, how luxuriant and apart
from the austerity of Greece, we observe in one of Mr. Collins’s
parallels.</p>
<p>Polynices, in the Phœnissæ of Euripides (504–506), exclaims:</p>
<p>“To the stars’ risings, and the sun’s I’d go,</p>
<p>And dive ’neath earth, — if I could do this thing, —</p>
<p>Possess Heaven’s highest boon of sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Then compare Hotspur:</p>
<p>“By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap</p>
<p>To pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon,</p>
<p>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</p>
<p>Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,</p>
<p>And pluck up drownèd honour by the locks,</p>
<p>So he that doth redeem her thence, might wear</p>
<p>Without corrival all her dignities.”</p>
<p>What a hurrying crowd of pictures rush through Hotspur’s mind! Is
Shakespeare thinking of the Phœnissæ, or is he speaking only on the
promptings of his genius?</p>
<p>V. SHAKESPEARE, GENIUS, AND SOCIETY</p>
<p>A phrase has been used to explain the Greek element in Shakespeare’s
work, namely, “congruity of genius,” which is apt to be resented by
Baconians. Perhaps they have a right to resent it, for “genius” is hard
to define, and genius is invoked by some wild wits to explain feats of
Shakespeare’s which (to Baconians) appear “miracles.” A “miracle” also
is notoriously hard to define; but we may take it (“under all reserves”)
to stand for the occurrence of an event, or the performance of an action
which, to the speaker who applies the word “miracle,” seems
“impossible.” The speaker therefore says, “The event is impossible;
miracles do not happen: therefore the reported event never occurred. The
alleged performance, the writing of the plays by the actor, was
impossible, was a miracle, therefore was done by some person or persons
other than the actor.” This idea of the impossibility of the player’s
authorship is the foundation of the Baconian edifice.</p>
<p>I have, to the best of my ability, tried to describe Mr. Greenwood’s
view of the young provincial from Warwickshire, Will Shakspere. If Will
were what Mr. Greenwood thinks he was, then Will’s authorship of the
plays seems to me, “humanly speaking,” impossible. But then
Mr. Greenwood appeared to omit from his calculations the circumstance
that Will may have been, not merely “a sharp boy” but a boy of great
parts; and not without a love of stories and poetry: a passion which, in
a bookless region, could only be gratified through folk-song, folk-tale,
and such easy Latin as he might take the trouble to read. If we add to
these very unusual but not wholly impossible tastes and abilities, that
Will may have been a lad of genius, there is no more “miracle” in his
case than in other supreme examples of genius. “But genius cannot work
miracles, cannot do what is impossible.” Do what is impossible to whom?
To the critics, the men of common sense.</p>
<p>Alas, all this way of talking about “miracles,” and “the impossible,”
and “genius” is quite vague and popular. What do we mean by “genius”?
The Latin term originally designates, not a man’s everyday intellect,
but a spirit from without which inspires him, like the “Dæmon,” or, in
Latin, “Genius” of Socrates, or the lutin which rode the pen of Molière.
“Genius” is claimed for Shakespeare in an inscription on his Stratford
monument, erected at latest some six years after his death. Following
this path of thought we come to “inspiration”: the notion of it, as
familiar to Australian savages as to any modern minds, is that, to the
poet, what he produces is given by some power greater than himself, by
the Boilyas (spirits) or Pundjel, the Father of all. This palæolithic
psychology, of course, is now quite discredited, yet the term “genius”
is still (perhaps superstitiously) applied to the rare persons whose
intellectual faculties lightly outrun those of ordinary mortals, and who
do marvels with means apparently inadequate.</p>
<p>In recent times some philosophers, like Mr. F. W. H. Myers, put — in
place of the Muses or the Boilyas, or the Genius — what they call the
“Subliminal Self,” something “far more deeply interfused than the
everyday intellect.” This subconscious self, capable of far more than
the conscious intelligence, is genius.</p>
<p>On the other side, genius may fairly be regarded as faculty, only
higher in degree, and not at all different in kind, from the everyday
intellect which, for example, pens this page.</p>
<p>Thus as soon as we begin to speak of “genius,” we are involved in
speculations, psychological, psychical, physical, and metaphysical; in
difficulties of all sorts not at present to be solved either by
physiological science or experimental psychology, or by psychical
research, or by the study of heredity. When I speak of “the genius of
Shakespeare,” of Jeanne d’Arc, of Bacon, even of Wellington, I possibly
have a meaning which is not in all respects the meaning of
Mr. Greenwood, when he uses the term “genius”; so we are apt to
misunderstand each other. Yet we all glibly use the term “genius,”
without definition and without discussion.</p>
<p>At once, too, in this quest, we jostle against “that fool of a word,”
as Napoleon said, “impossible.” At once, on either side, we assume that
we know what is possible and what is impossible, — and so pretend to
omniscience.</p>
<p>Thus some “Stratfordians,” or defenders of the actor’s authorship,
profess to know — from all the signed work of Bacon, and from all that
has reached us about Bacon’s occupations and preoccupations, from 1590
to 1605 — that the theory of Bacon’s authorship of the plays is
“impossible.” I, however, do not profess this omniscience.</p>
<p>On the other side the Baconian, arguing from all that he knows, or
thinks he knows, or can imagine, of the actor’s education, conditions of
life, and opportunities, argues that the authorship of the actor is
“impossible.”</p>
<p>Both sides assume to be omniscient, but we incontestably know much
more about Bacon, in his works, his aims, his inclinations, and in his
life, than we know about the actor; while about “the potentialities of
genius,” we know — very little.</p>
<p>Thus, with all Bacon’s occupations and preoccupations, he had, the
Baconians will allow, genius. By the miracle of genius he may have found
time and developed inclination, to begin by furbishing up older plays
for a company of actors: he did it extremely well, but what a quaint
taste for a courtier and scholar! The eccentricities of genius may
account for his choice of a “nom de plume,” which, if he desired
concealment, was the last that was likely to serve his turn. He may also
have divined all the Doll Tearsheets and Mrs. Quicklys and Pistols,
whom, conceivably, he did not much frequent.</p>
<p>I am not one of those who deny that Bacon might have written Hamlet
“if he had the mind,” as Charles Lamb said of Wordsworth. Not at all; I
am the last to limit the potentialities of genius.</p>
<p>But suppose, merely for the sake of argument, that Will Shakspere too
had genius in that amazing degree which, in Henry V, the Bishop of Ely
and the Archbishop of Canterbury describe and discuss in the case of the
young king. In this passage we perceive that the poet had brooded over
and been puzzled by the “miracle” (he uses the word) of genius. Says
Canterbury speaking of the Prince’s wild youth,</p>
<p>“Never was such a sudden scholar made.”</p>
<p>One Baconian objection to Shakespeare’s authorship is that during his
early years in London (say 1587–92) he was “such a sudden scholar made”
in various things.</p>
<p>The young king’s</p>
<p>“addiction was to courses vain,</p>
<p>His companies unletter’d, rude, and shallow,”</p>
<p>precisely like Shakespeare’s courses and companions at Stratford</p>
<p>“Had never noted in him any study.”</p>
<p>Stratford tradition, a century after Shakespeare left the town, did
not remember “any study” in him; none had been “noted,” nor could have
been remembered. To return to Henry, he shines in divinity, knowledge of
“commonwealth affairs,”</p>
<p>“You would say, it hath been all in all his study.”</p>
<p>He is as intimate with the art of war; to him “Gordian knots of
policy” are “familiar as his garter.” He must have</p>
<p>“The art and practic part of life,”</p>
<p>as “mistress to this theorie,”</p>
<p>“Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,”</p>
<p>as his youth was riotous, and was lived in all men’s gaze,</p>
<p>“And never noted in him any study,</p>
<p>Any retirement, any sequestration</p>
<p>From open haunts and popularity.”</p>
<p>The Bishop of Ely can only suggest that Henry’s study or
“contemplation”</p>
<p>“Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</p>
<p>Unseen,”</p>
<p>and Canterbury says</p>
<p>“It must be so, for miracles are ceased.”</p>
<p>And thus the miracle of genius baffles the poet, for Henry’s had been
“noisy nights,” notoriously noisy.</p>
<p>Now, as we shall later show, Bacon’s rapid production of the plays,
considering his other contemporary activities and varied but always
absorbing interests, was as much a miracle as the sudden blossoming of
Henry’s knowledge and accomplishments; for all Bacon’s known exertions
and occupations, and his deepest and most absorbing interest, were
remote from the art of tragedy and comedy. If we are to admit the marvel
of genius in Bacon, of whose life and pursuits we know much, by parity
of reasoning we may grant that the actor, of whom we know much less, may
have had genius: had powers and could use opportunities in a way for
which Baconians make no allowance.</p>
<p>We now turn to Mr. Greenwood’s chapter, “Shakespeare and ‘Genius.’”
It opens with the accustomed list of poor Will’s disqualifications, “a
boy born of illiterate parents,” but we need not rehearse the list. He
“comes to town” (date unknown) “a needy adventurer”; in 1593 appeared
the poem Venus and Adonis, author’s name being printed as “W.
Shakespeare.” Then comes Lucrece (1594). In 1598 Love’s Labour’s Lost,
printed as “corrected and augmented” by “W. Shakespere.” And so on with
all the rest. Criticism of the learning and splendour of the two poems
follows. To Love’s Labour’s Lost, and the amusing things written about
it by Baconians, I return; and to Shakespeare’s “impossible” knowledge
of courtly society, his “polish and urbanity,” his familiar acquaintance
with contemporary French politics, foreign proverbs, and “the gossip of
the Court” of Elizabeth: these points are made by His Honour Judge
Webb.</p>
<p>All this lore to Shakespeare is “impossible” — he could not read, say
some Baconians, or had no Latin, or had next to none; on these points I
have said my say. The omniscient Baconians know that all the early works
ascribed to the actor were impossible, to a man of, say thirty — who was
no more, and knew no more, than they know that the actor was and knew;
and as for “Genius,” it cannot work miracles. Genius “bestows upon no
one a knowledge of facts,” “Shakespeare, however favoured by nature,
could impart only what he had learned.”</p>
<p>Precisely, but genius as I understand it (and even cleverness) has a
way of acquiring knowledge of facts where the ordinary “dull intelligent
man” gains none. Keen interest, keen curiosity, swift observation, even
the power of tearing out the things essential from a book, the gift of
rapid reading; the faculty of being alive to the fingertips, — these,
with a tenacious memory, may enable a small boy to know more facts of
many sorts than his elders and betters and all the neighbours. They are
puzzled, if they make the discovery of his knowledge. Scott was such a
small boy; whether we think him a man of genius or not. Shakspere, even
the actor, was, perhaps, a man of genius, and possessed this power of
rapid acquisition and vivid retention of all manner of experience and
information. To what I suppose to have been his opportunities in London,
I shall return. Meanwhile, let the doubter take up any popular English
books of Shakespeare’s day: he will find them replete with much
knowledge wholly new to him — which he will also find in
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>A good example is this: Judge Webb proclaimed that in points of
scientific lore (the lore of that age) Shakespeare and Bacon were much
on a level. Professor Tyrrell, in a newspaper, said that the facts
staggered him, as a “Stratfordian.” A friend told me that he too was
equally moved. I replied that these pseudoscientific “facts” had long
been commonplaces. Pliny was a rich source of them. Professor Dowden
took the matter up, with full knowledge, and reconverted Mr. Tyrrell,
who wrote: “I am not versed in the literature of the Shakespearian era,
and I assumed that the Baconians who put forward the parallelisms had
satisfied themselves that the coincidences were peculiar to the writings
of the philosopher and the poet. Professor Dowden has proved that this
is not so.”</p>
<p>Were I to enter seriously on this point of genius, I should begin by
requesting my adversaries to read Mr. F. W. H. Myers’s papers on “The
Mechanism of Genius” (in his Human Personality), and to consider the
humble problem of “Calculating Boys,” which is touched on also by
Cardinal Newman. How do they, at the age of innocence, arrive at their
amazing results? How did the child Pascal, ignorant of Euclid, work out
the Euclidean propositions of “bars and rounds,” as he called lines and
circles? Science has no solution!</p>
<p>Transport the problem into the region of poetry and knowledge of
human nature, take Will in place of Pascal and Gauss, and (in manners
and matter of war) Jeanne d’Arc; — and science, I fancy, is much to seek
for a reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood considers, among others, the case of Robert Burns. The
parallel is very interesting, and does not, I think, turn so much to
Mr. Greenwood’s advantage as he supposes. The genius of Burns, of
course, is far indeed below the level of that of the author of the
Shakespearean plays. But that author and Burns have this in common with
each other (and obviously with Homer), that their work arises from a
basis of older materials, already manipulated by earlier artists. Burns
almost always has a key-note already touched, as confessedly in the
poems of his predecessor, Fergusson; of Hamilton of Gilbertfield; in
songs, popular or artistic, and so forth. He “alchemised” his materials,
as Mr. Greenwood says of his author of the plays; turned dross into
gold, brick into marble. Notoriously much Shakespearean work is of the
same nature.</p>
<p>The education of Burns he owed to his peasant father, to his parish
school (in many such schools he might have acquired Latin and Greek; in
fact he did not), to a tutor who read with him some English and French;
and he knew a modernised version of Blind Harry’s Wallace; Locke’s
Essay; The Spectator, novels of the day, and vernacular Scots poets of
his century, with a world of old Scots songs. These things, and such as
these, were Burns’s given literary materials. He used them in the only
way open to him, in poems written for a rural audience, and published
for an Edinburgh public. No classical, no theatrical materials were
given; or, if he read the old drama, he could not, in his rural
conditions, and in a Scotland where the theatre was in a very small way,
venture on producing plays, for which there was no demand, while he had
no knowledge of the Stage. Burns found and filled the only channels open
to him, in a printed book, and in music books for which he transmuted
old songs.</p>
<p>The bookish materials offered to Will, in London, were crammed with
reminiscences from the classics, were mainly romantic and theatrical;
and, from his profession of actor, by far the best channel open to him
was the theatre. Badly as it paid the outside author, there was nothing
that paid better. Venus and Adonis brought “more praise than pudding,”
if one may venture a guess. With the freedom of the theatre Will could
soar to all heights and plumb all depths. No such opportunity had Burns,
even if he could have used it, and, owing to a variety of causes, his
spirit soon ceased to soar high or wing wide.</p>
<p>I take Shakespeare, in London at least, to have read the current
Elizabethan light literature — Euphues, Lyly’s Court comedies, novels
full of the classics and of social life; Spenser, Sidney — his Defence
of Poesy, and Arcadia (1590) — with scores of tales translated from the
Italian, French, and Spanish, all full of foreign society, and
discourses of knights and ladies. He saw the plays of the day, perhaps
as one of “the groundlings.” He often beheld Society, from without, when
acting before the Queen and at great houses. He had thus, if I am right,
sufficient examples of style and manner, and knowledge of how the great
were supposed (in books) to comport and conduct themselves. The books
were cheap, and could be borrowed, and turned over at the booksellers’
stalls. The Elizabethan style was omnipresent. Suppose that Shakespeare
was a clever man, a lover of reading, a rapid reader with an excellent
memory, easily influenced, like Burns, by what he read, and I really
think that my conjectures are not too audacious. Not only “the man in
the street,” but “the reading public” (so loved by Coleridge), have not
the beginning of a guess as to the way in which a quick man reads. Watch
them poring for hours over a newspaper! Let me quote what Sir Walter
Raleigh says: “Shakespeare was one of those swift and masterly readers
who know what they want of a book; they scorn nothing that is dressed in
print, but turn over the pages with a quick discernment of all that
brings them new information, or jumps with their thought, or tickles
their fancy. Such a reader will have done with a volume in a few
minutes, yet what he has taken from it he keeps for years. He is a live
man; and is sometimes judged by slower wits to be a learned man.”</p>
<p>I am taking Shakespeare to have been a reader of this kind, as was
Dr. Johnson, as are not a few men who have no pretensions to genius. The
accomplishment is only a marvel to — well, I need not be particular
about the kind of person to whom it is a marvel!</p>
<p>Here, in fairness, the reader should be asked to consider an eloquent
passage of comparison between the knowledge of Burns and of Will, quoted
by Mr. Greenwood from Mr. Morgan.</p>
<p>Genius, says Mr. Morgan, “did not guide Burns’s untaught pen to write
of Troy or Egypt, of Athens and Cyprus.” No! that was not Burns’s lay;
nor would he have found a public had he emulated the contemporary
St. Andrews professor, Mr. Wilkie, who wrote The Epigoniad, and sang of
Cadmeian Thebes, to the delight of David Hume, his friend. The public of
1780–90 did not want new epics of heroic Greece from Mossgiel; nor was
the literature accessible to Burns full of the mediæval legends of Troy
and Athens. But the popular literature accessible to Will was full of
the mediæval legends of Thebes, Troy, and Athens; and of these, not of
Homer, Will made his market. Egypt he knew only in the new English
version of Plutarch’s Lives; of Homer, he (or the author of Troilus and
Cressida) used only Iliad VII., in Chapman’s new translation (1598). For
the rest he had Lydgate (perhaps), and, certainly, Caxton’s Destruction
of Troy, still reprinted as a popular book as late as 1713. Will did
not, as Mr. Morgan says, “reproduce the very counterfeit civilisations
and manners of nations born and buried and passed into history a
thousand years before he had been begotten. . . “ He bestowed the
manners of mediæval chivalrous romance on his Trojans and Greeks. He
accommodated prehistoric Athens with a Duke. He gave Scotland cannon
three hundred years too early; and made Cleopatra play at billiards.
Look at his notion of “the very manners” of early post-Roman Britain in
Cymbeline and King Lear! Concerning “the anomalous status of a King of
Scotland under one of its primitive Kings” the author of Macbeth knew no
more than what he read in Holinshed; of the actual truth concerning
Duncan (that old prince was, in fact, a young man slain in a
blacksmith’s bothy), and of the whole affair, the author knew nothing
but a tissue of sophisticated legends. The author of the plays had no
knowledge (as Mr. Morgan inexplicably declares that he had) of “matters
of curious and occult research for antiquaries or dilettanti to dig out
of old romances or treaties or statutes rather than for historians to
treat of or schools to teach!”</p>
<p>Mon Dieu! do historians not treat of “matters of curious research”
and of statutes and of treaties? As for “old romances,” they were
current and popular. The “occult” sources of King Lear are a popular
tale attached to legendary “history” and a story in Sidney’s Arcadia.
Will, whom Mr. Morgan describes as “a letterless peasant lad,” or the
Author, whoever he was, is not “invested with all the love” (sic, v.1.
“lore”), “which the ages behind him had shut up in clasped books and
buried and forgotten.”</p>
<p>“Our friend’s style has flowery components,” Mr. Greenwood adds to
this deliciously eloquent passage from his American author, “and yet
Shakespeare who did all this,” et cætera. But Shakespeare did not do
“all this”! We know the sources of the plays well enough: novels in one
of which “Delphos” is the insular seat of an oracle of Apollo;
Holinshed, with his contaminated legends; North’s Plutarch, done out of
the French; older plays, and the rest of it. Shakespeare does not go to
Tighernach and the Hennskringla for Macbeth; or for Hamlet to the saga
which is the source of Saxo; or for his English chronicle-plays to the
State Papers. Shakespeare did not, like William of Deloraine, dig up
“clasped books, buried and forgotten.” There is no original research;
the author uses the romances, novels, ballads, and popular books of
uncritical history which were current in his day. Mr. Greenwood knows
that; Mr. Morgan, perhaps, knew it, but forgot what he knew; hurried
away by the Muse of Eloquence. And the common Baconian may believe
Mr. Morgan.</p>
<p>But Mr. Greenwood asks “what was the poetic output?” in Burns’s case.
It was what we know, and that was what suited his age and his
circumstances. It was lyric, idyll, song, and satire; it was not drama,
for to the Stage he had no access, he who passed but one winter in
Edinburgh, where the theatre was not the centre of literature.</p>
<p>Shakespeare came, with genius and with such materials as I have
suggested, to an entirely different market, the Elizabethan theatre. I
have tried to show how easily his mind might be steeped in the
all-pervading classicism and foreign romance of the period, with the
wide, sketchy, general information, the commonly known fragments from
the great banquet of the classics, — with such history, wholly
uncritical, as Holinshed and Stow, and other such English chroniclers,
could copiously provide; with the courtly manners mirrored in scores of
romances and Court plays; and in the current popular Morte d’Arthur and
Destruction of Troy.</p>
<p>I can agree with Mr. Greenwood, when he says that “Genius is a
potentiality, and whether it will ever become an actuality, and what it
will produce, depends upon the moral qualities with which it is
associated, and the opportunities that are open to it — in a word, on
the circumstances of its environment.”</p>
<p>Of course by “moral qualities,” a character without spot or stain is
not intended: we may take that for granted. Otherwise, I agree; and
think that Shakespeare of Stratford had genius, and that what it
produced was in accordance with the opportunities open to it, and with
“the circumstances of its environment.” Without the “environment,” no
Jeanne d’Arc, — without the environment, no Shakespeare.</p>
<p>To come to his own, Shakespeare needed the environment of “the light
people,” the crowd of wits living from hand to mouth by literature, like
Greene and Nash; and he needed that pell-mell of the productions of
their pens: the novels, the poems, the pamphlets, and, above all, the
plays, and the wine, the wild talk, the wit, the travellers’ tales, the
seamen’s company, the vision of the Court, the gallants, the beauties;
and he needed the People, of whom he does not speak in the terms of such
a philanthropist as Bacon professedly was. Not as an aristocrat, a
courtier, but as a simple literary man, William does not like, though he
thoroughly understands, the mob. Like Alceste (in Le Misanthrope of
Poquelin), he might say,</p>
<p>“L’Ami du genre humain n’est point du tout mon fait.”</p>
<p>In London, not in Stratford, he could and did find his mob. This
reminds one to ask, how did the Court-haunting, or the study-haunting,
or law-court, and chamber of criminal examination-rooms haunting Bacon
make acquaintance with Mrs. Quickly, and Doll Tearsheet, and drawers,
and carters, and Bardolph, and Pistol, and copper captains, and all
Shakespeare’s crowd of people hanging loose on the town?</p>
<p>It is much easier to discover how Shakespeare found the tone and
manners of courtly society (which, by the way, are purely poetic and
conventional), than to find out where Bacon got his immense knowledge of
what is called “low life.”</p>
<p>If you reply, as regards Bacon, “his genius divined the Costards and
Audreys, the Doll Tearsheets and tapsters, and drawers, and Bardolphs,
and carters, from a hint or two, a glance,” I answer that Will had much
better sources for them in his own experience of life, and had
conventional poetic sources for his courtiers — of whom, in the quick,
he saw quite as much as Molière did of his Marquis.</p>
<p>But one Baconian has found out a more excellent way of accounting for
Bacon’s pictures of rude rustic life, and he is backed by Lord Penzance,
that aged Judge. The way is short. These pictures of rural life and
character were interpolated into the plays of Bacon by his collaborator,
William Shakspere, actor, “who prepared the plays for the stage.” This
brilliant suggestion is borrowed from Mr. Appleton Morgan.</p>
<p>Thus have these two Baconians perceived that it is difficult to see
how Bacon obtained his knowledge of certain worlds and aspects of
character which he could scarcely draw “from the life.” I am willing to
ascribe miracles to the genius of Bacon; but the Baconians cited give
the honour to the actor, “who prepared the plays for the stage.”</p>
<p>Take it as you please, my Baconian friends who do not believe as I
believe in “Genius.” Shakespeare and Molière did not live in “Society,”
though both rubbed shoulders with it, or looked at it over the invisible
barrier between the actor and the great people in whose houses or
palaces he takes the part of Entertainer. The rest they divined, by
genius.</p>
<p>Bacon did not, perhaps, study the society of carters, drawers,
Mrs. Quickly, and Doll Tearsheet; of copper captains and their boys; not
at Court, not in the study, did he meet them. How then did he create his
multitude of very low-lived persons? Rustics and rural constables he may
have lovingly studied at Gorhambury, but for his collection of other
very loose fish Bacon must have kept queer company. So you have to admit
“Genius,” — the miracle of “Genius” in your Bacon, — to an even greater
extent than I need it in the case of my Will; or, like Lord Penzance,
you may suggest that Will collaborated with Bacon.</p>
<p>Try to imagine that Will was a born poet, like Burns, but with a very
different genius, education, and environment. Burns could easily get at
the Press, and be published: that was impossible for Shakespeare at
Stratford, if he had written any lyrics. Suppose him to be a poet, an
observer, a wit, a humorist. Tradition at Stratford says something about
the humorist, and tradition, in similar circumstances, would have
remembered no more of Burns, after the lapse of seventy years.</p>
<p>Imagine Will, then, to have the nature of a poet (that much I am
obliged to assume), and for nine or ten years, after leaving school at
thirteen, to hang about Stratford, observing nature and man, flowers and
foibles, with thoughts incommunicable to Sturley and Quiney. Some sorts
of park-palings, as he was married at eighteen, he could not break so
lightly as Burns did, — some outlying deer he could not so readily shoot
at, perhaps, but I am not surprised if he assailed other deer, and was
in troubles many. Unlike Burns, he had a keen eye for the main chance.
Everything was going to ruin with his father; school-mastering, if he
tried it (I merely follow tradition), was not satisfactory. His opinion
of dominies, if he wrote the plays, was identical with that frequently
expressed, in fiction and privately, by Sir Walter Scott.</p>
<p>Something must be done! Perhaps the straitest Baconian will not deny
that companies of players visited Stratford, or even that he may have
seen and talked with them, and been attracted. He was a practical man,
and he made for London, and, by tradition, we first find him heading
straight for the theatre, holding horses at the door, and organising a
small brigade of boys as his deputies. According to Ben Jonson he shone
in conversation; he was good company, despite his rustic accent, that
terrible bar! The actors find that out; he is admitted within the house
as a “servitor” — a call-boy, if you like; an apprentice, if you
please.</p>
<p>By 1592, when Greene wrote his Groatsworth, “Shakescene” thinks he
can bombast out a blank verse with the best; he is an actor, he is also
an author, or a furbisher of older plays, and, as a member of the
company, is a rival to be dreaded by Greene’s three author friends:
whoever they were, they were professional University playwrights; the
critics think that Marlowe, so near his death, was one of them.</p>
<p>Will, supposing him to come upon the town in 1587, has now had, say,
five years of such opportunities as were open to a man connected with
the stage. Among these, in that age, we may, perhaps, reckon a good deal
of very mixed society — writing men, bookish young blades, young blades
who haunt the theatre, and sit on the stage, as was the custom of the
gallants.</p>
<p>What follows? Chaff follows, a kind of intimacy, a supper, perhaps,
after the play, if an actor seems to be good company. This is quite
natural; the most modish young gallants are not so very dainty as to
stand aloof from any amusing company. They found it among
prize-fighters, when Byron was young, and extremely conscious of the
fact that he was a lord. Moreover there were no women on the stage to
distract the attention of the gallants. The players, says Asinius Lupus,
in Jonson’s Poetaster, “corrupt young gentry very much, I know it.” I
take the quotation from Mr. Greenwood. They could not corrupt the young
gentry, if they were not pretty intimate with them. From Ben’s
Poetaster, which bristles with envy of the players, Mr. Greenwood also
quotes a railing address by a copper captain to Histrio, a poor actor,
“There are some of you players honest, gentlemanlike scoundrels, and
suspected to ha’ some wit, as well as your poets, both at drinking and
breaking of jests; and are companions for gallants. A man may skelder
ye, now and then, of half a dozen shillings or so.” We think of Nigel
Olifaunt in The Fortunes of Nigel; but better gallants might choose to
have some acquaintance with Shakespeare.</p>
<p>To suppose that young men of position would not form a playhouse
acquaintanceship with an amusing and interesting actor seems to me to
show misunderstanding of human nature. The players were, when
unprotected by men of rank, “vagabonds.” The citizens of London, mainly
Puritans, hated them mortally, but the young gallants were not Puritans.
The Court patronised the actors who performed Masques in palaces and
great houses. The wealth and splendid attire of the actors, their
acquisition of land and of coats of arms infuriated the sweated
playwrights. Envy of the actors appears in the Cambridge “Parnassus”
plays of c. 1600–2. In the mouth of Will Kempe, who acted Dogberry in
Shakespeare’s company, and was in favour, says Heywood, with Queen
Elizabeth, the Cambridge authors put this brag: “For Londoners, who of
more report than Dick Burbage and Will Kempe? He is not counted a
gentleman that knows not Dick Burbage and Will Kempe.” It is not my
opinion that Shakespeare was, as Ben Jonson came to be, as much “in
Society” as is possible for a mere literary man. I do not, in fancy, see
him wooing a Maid of Honour. He was a man’s man, a peer might be
interested in him as easily as in a jockey, a fencer, a tennis-player, a
musician, que sçais-je? Southampton, discovering his qualities, may have
been more interested, interested in a better way.</p>
<p>In such circumstances which are certainly in accordance with human
nature, I suppose the actor to have been noticed by the young, handsome,
popular Earl of Southampton; who found him interesting, and interested
himself in the poet. There followed the dedication to the Earl of Venus
and Adonis; a poem likely to please any young amorist (1693).</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood cries out at the audacity of a player dedicating to an
Earl, without even saying that he has asked leave to dedicate. The mere
fact that the dedication was accepted, and followed by that of Lucrece,
proves that the Earl did not share the surprise of Mr. Greenwood. He,
conceivably, will argue that the Earl knew the real concealed author,
and the secret of the pseudonym. But of the hypothesis of such a choice
of a pseudonym, enough has been said. Whatever happened, whatever the
Earl knew, if it were discreditable to be dedicated to by an actor,
Southampton was discredited; for we are to prove that all in the world
of letters and theatre who have left any notice of Shakespeare
identified the actor with the poet.</p>
<p>This appears to me to be the natural way of looking at the affair.
But, says Mr. Greenwood, of this intimacy or “patronage” of Southampton
“not a scrap of evidence exists.” Where would Mr. Greenwood expect to
find a scrap of evidence? In literary anecdote? Of contemporary literary
anecdote about Shakespeare, as about Beaumont, Dekker, Chapman, Heywood,
and Fletcher, there is none, or next to none. There is the tradition
that Southampton gave the poet £1000 towards a purchase to which he had
a mind. (Rowe seems to have got this from Davenant, — through
Betterton.) In what documents would the critic expect to find a scrap of
evidence? Perhaps in Southampton’s book of his expenditure, and that
does not exist. It is in the accounts of Prince Charlie that I find him,
poor as he was, giving money to Jean Jacques Rousseau.</p>
<p>As to the chances of an actor’s knowing “smart people,” Heywood, who
knew all that world, tells us that “Tarleton, in his time, was gracious
with the Queen, his sovereign,” Queen Elizabeth. “Will Kempe was in the
favour of his sovereign.”</p>
<p>They had advantages, they were not literary men, but low comedians. I
am not pretending that, though his</p>
<p>“flights upon the banks of Thames</p>
<p>So did take Eliza and our James,”</p>
<p>Will Shakspere “was gracious with the Queen.”</p>
<p>We may compare the dedication of the Folio of 1623; here two players
address the Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery. They have the audacity to
say nothing about having asked and received permission to dedicate. They
say that the Earls “have prosecuted both the plays and their authour
living” (while in life) “with much favour.” They “have collected and
published the works of ‘the dead’ . . . only to keep alive the memory of
so worthy a Friend, and Fellow” (associate) “as was our Shakespeare,
‘your servant Shakespeare.’”</p>
<p>Nothing can possibly be more explicit, both as to the actor’s
authorship of the plays, and as to the favour in which the two Earls
held him. Mr. Greenwood supposes that Jonson wrote the Preface, which
contains an allusion to a well-known ode of Horace, and to a phrase of
Pliny. Be that as it may, the Preface signed by the two players speaks
to Pembroke and Montgomery. To them it cannot lie; they know whether
they patronised the actor or not; whether they believed, or not, that
the plays were their “servant’s.” How is Mr. Greenwood to overcome this
certain testimony of the Actors, to the identity of their late “Fellow”
the player, with the author; and to the patronage which the Earls
bestowed on him and his compositions? Mr. Greenwood says nothing except
that we may reasonably suppose Ben to have written the dedication which
the players signed.</p>
<p>Whether or not the two Earls had a personal knowledge of Shakespeare,
the dedication does not say in so many words. They had seen his plays
and had “favoured” both him and them, with so much favour, had “used
indulgence” to the author. That is not nearly explicit enough for the
precise Baconians. But the Earls knew whether what was said were true or
false. I am not sure whether the Baconians regard them as having been
duped as to the authorship, or as fellow-conspirators with Ben in the
great Baconian joke and mystery — that “William Shakespeare” the author
is not the actor whose Stratford friend, Collyns, has his name written
in legal documents as “William Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>Anyone, however, may prefer to believe that, while William Shakspere
was acting in a company (1592–3), Bacon, or who you please, wrote Venus
and Adonis, and, signing “W. Shakspeare,” dedicated it to his young
friend, the Earl, promising to add “some graver labour,” a promise
fulfilled in Lucrece. In 1593, Bacon was chiefly occupied, we shall see,
with the affairs of a young and beautiful Earl — the Earl of Essex, not
of Southampton: to Essex he did not dedicate his two poems (if Venus and
Lucrece were his). He “did nothing but ruminate” (he tells the world) on
Essex. How Mr. Greenwood’s Unknown was occupied in 1593–4, of course we
cannot possibly be aware.</p>
<p>I have thus tried to show that Will Shakspere, if he had as much
schooling as I suggest; and if he had four or five years of life in
London, about the theatre, and, above all, had genius, might, by 1592,
be the rising player-author alluded to as “Shakescene.” There remains a
difficulty. By 1592 Will had not time to be guilty of thirteen plays, or
even of six. But I have not credited him with the authorship, between,
say, 1587 and 1593, of eleven plays, namely, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet,
Midsummer Night’s Dream, Titus Andronicus, Comedy of Errors, Love’s
Labour’s Lost, King John, the three plays of Henry VI, and The Taming of
the Shrew. Mr. Greenwood cites Judge Webb for the fact that between the
end of 1587 and the end of 1592 “some half-dozen Shakespearean dramas
had been written,” and for Dr. Furnivall’s opinion that eleven had been
composed.</p>
<p>If I believed that half a dozen, or eleven Shakespearean plays, as we
have them, had been written or composed, between 1587 and 1592, I should
be obliged to say that, in my opinion, they were not composed, in these
five years, by Will. Mr. Greenwood writes, “Some of the dates are
disputable”; and, for himself, would omit “Titus Andronicus, the three
plays of Henry VI, and possibly also The Taming of the Shrew, while the
reference to Hamlet also is, as I have elsewhere shown, of very doubtful
force.” This leaves us with six of Dr. Furnivall’s list of earliest
plays put out of action. The miracle is decomposing, but plays numerous
enough to stagger my credulity remain.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that the author even of the five plays before 1592–3
was the ex-butcher’s boy. Meanwhile these five plays, written by
somebody before 1593, meet the reader on the threshold of
Mr. Greenwood’s book with Dr. Furnivall’s eleven; and they fairly
frighten him, if he be a “Stratfordian.” “Will, even Will,” says the
Stratfordian, “could not have composed the five, much less the eleven,
much less Mr. Edwin Reed’s thirteen ‘before 1592.’” But, at the close of
his work Mr. Greenwood reviews and disbands that unlucky troop of
thirteen Shakespearean plays “before 1592” as mustered by Mr. Reed, a
Baconian of whom Mr. Collins wrote in terms worthy of feu Mr. Bludyer of
The Tomahawk.</p>
<p>From the five plays left to Shakespeare’s account in , King John (as
we know it) is now eliminated. “I find it impossible to believe that the
same man was the author of the drama” (The Troublesome Reign of King
John) “published in 1591, and that which, so far as we know, first saw
the light in the Folio of 1623 . . . Hardly a single line of the
original version reappears in the King John of Shakespeare.” “I think it
is a mistake to endeavour to fortify the argument against him” (my Will,
toi que j’aime), “by ascribing to Shakespeare such old plays as the King
John of 1591 or the primitive Hamlet.”</p>
<p>I thought so too, when I read , and saw King John apparently still
“coloured on the card” among “Shakespeare’s lot.” We are now left with
Love’s Labour’s Lost, Midsummer Night’s Dream, Comedy of Errors, and
Romeo and Juliet, out of Dr. Furnivall’s list of plays up to 1593. The
phantom force of miraculously early plays is “following darkness like a
dream.” We do not know the date of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, we do not
know the date of Romeo and Juliet. Mr. Gollancz dates the former “about
1592,” and the latter “at 1591.” This is a mere personal speculation. Of
Love’s Labour’s Lost, we only know that our version is one “corrected
and augmented” by William Shakespeare in 1598. I dare say it is as early
as 1591–2, in its older form. Of The Comedy of Errors, Mr. Collins
wrote, “It is all but certain that it was written between 1589 and 1592,
and it is quite certain that it was written before the end of 1594.”</p>
<p>The legion of Shakespearean plays of date before 1593 has vanished.
The miracle is very considerably abated. In place of introducing the
airy hosts of plays before 1592, in , it would have been, perhaps, more
instructive to write that, as far as we can calculate, Shakespeare’s
earliest trials of his pinions as a dramatist may be placed about
1591–3. There would then have been no specious appearance of miracles to
be credited by Stratfordians to Will. But even so, we have sufficient to
“give us pause,” says Mr. Greenwood, with justice. It gives me “pause,”
if I am to believe that, between 1587 and 1592, Will wrote Love’s
Labour’s Lost, The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and
Romeo and Juliet. There is a limit even to my gullibility, and if anyone
wrote all these plays, as we now possess them, before 1593, I do not
suppose that Will was the man. But the dates, in fact, are unknown: the
miracle is apocryphal.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE COURTLY PLAYS: “LOVE’S LABOUR’S LOST”</li>
</ol>
<p>We now come to consider another “miracle” discovered in the plays, —
a miracle if the actor be the author. The new portent is the courtliness
and refinement (too often, alas! the noblest ladies make the coarsest
jokes) and wit of the speeches of the noble gentlemen and ladies in the
plays. To be sure the refinement in the jests is often conspicuously
absent. How could the rude actor learn his quips and pretty phrases, and
farfetched conceits? This question I have tried to answer already, — the
whole of these fashions abound in the literature of the day.</p>
<p>Here let us get rid of the assumption that a poet could not make the
ladies and gentlemen of his plays converse as they do converse, whether
in quips and airs and graces, or in loftier style, unless he himself
frequented their society. Marlowe did not frequent the best society; he
was no courtier, but there is the high courtly style in the speeches of
the great and noble in Edward II. Courtiers and kings never did speak in
this manner, any more than they spoke in blank verse. The style is a
poetical convention, while the quips and conceits, the airs and graces,
ran riot through the literature of the age of Lyly and his Euphues and
his comedies, the age of the Arcadia.</p>
<p>A cheap and probable source of Will’s courtliness is to be found in
the courtly comedies of John Lyly, five of which were separately printed
between 1584 and 1592. Lyly’s “real significance is that he was the
first to bring together on the English stage the elements of high
comedy, thereby preparing the way for Shakespeare’s Much Ado about
Nothing and As You Like It” (and Love’s Labour’s Lost, one may add).
“Whoever knows his Shakespeare and his Lyly well can hardly miss the
many evidences that Shakespeare had read Lyly’s plays almost as closely
as Lyly had read Pliny’s Natural History. . . . One could hardly imagine
Love’s Labour’s Lost as existent in the period from 1590 to 1600, had
not Lyly’s work just preceded it.”</p>
<p>“It is to Lyly’s plays,” writes Dr. Landmann, “that Shakespeare owes
so much in the liveliness of his dialogues, in smartness of expression,
and especially in that predilection for witticisms, quibbles, and
playing upon words which he shows in his comedies as well as in his
tragedies.” There follows a dissertation on the affected styles of
Guevara and Gongora, of the Pléiade in France, and generally of the
artificial manner in Europe, till in England we reach Lyly, “in whose
comedies,” says Dr. Furness, “I think we should look for motives which
appeared later in Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>The Baconians who think that a poet could not derive from books and
court plays his knowledge of fashions far more prevalent in literature
than at Court, decide that the poet of Love’s Labour’s Lost was not
Will, but the courtly “concealed poet.” No doubt Baconians may argue
with Mr. R. M. Theobald that “Bacon wrote Marlowe,” and, by parity of
reasoning many urge, though Mr. Theobald does not, that Bacon wrote
Lyly, pouring into Lyly’s comedies the grace and wit, the quips and
conceits of his own courtly youth. “What for no?” The hypothesis is as
good as the other hypotheses, “Bacon wrote Marlowe,” “Bacon wrote
Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>The less impulsive Baconians and the Anti-Willians appear to ignore
the well-known affected novels which were open to all the world, and are
noted even in short educational histories of English literature.
Shakespeare, in London, had only to look at the books on the stalls, to
read or, if he had the chance, to see Lyly’s plays, and read the poems
of the time. I am taking him not to be a dullard but a poet. It was not
hard for him, if he were a poet of genius, not only to catch the manner
of Lyly’s Court comedies, and “Marlowe’s mighty line” (Marlowe was not
“brought up on the knees of Marchionesses”!), but to improve on them.
People did not commonly talk in the poetical way, heaven knows; people
did not write in the poetic convention. Certainly Queen Mary and Queen
Elizabeth talked and wrote, as a rule (we have abundance of their
letters), like women of this world. There is a curious exception in
Letter VIII of the Casket Letters from Mary to Bothwell. In this (we
have a copy of the original French), Mary plunges into the affected and
figured style already practised by Les Précieuses of her day; and
expands into symbolisms in a fantastic jargon. If courtiers of both
sexes conversed in the style of Euphues (which is improbable), they
learned the trick of it from Euphues; not the author of Euphues from
them. Lyly’s most popular prose was accessible to Shakespeare. The whole
convention as to how the great should speak and bear themselves was
accessible in poetry and the drama. A man of genius naturally made his
ladies and courtiers more witty, more “conceited,” more eloquent, more
gracious than any human beings ever were anywhere, in daily life.</p>
<p>It seems scarcely credible that one should be obliged to urge facts
so obvious against the Baconian argument that only a Bacon, intimately
familiar with the society of the great, could make the great speak as,
in the plays, they do — and as in real life they probably did not!</p>
<p>We now look at Love’s Labour’s Lost, published in quarto, in 1598, as
“corrected and augmented by W. Shakespere.” The date of composition is
unknown, but the many varieties of versification, with some allusions,
mark it as among the earliest of the dramas. Supposing that Shakespeare
obtained his knowledge of fine manners and speech, and of the tedious
quips and conceits which he satirises, from the contemporary poems,
plays, and novels which abounded in them, and from précieux and
précieuses who imitated them, as I suggest, even then Love’s Labour’s
Lost is an extremely eccentric piece. I cannot imagine how a man who
knew the foreign politics of his age as Bacon did, could have dreamed of
writing anything so eccentric, that is, if it has any connection with
foreign politics of the time.</p>
<p>The scene is the Court of Ferdinand, King of Navarre. In 1589–93, the
eyes of England were fixed on the Court of her ally, Henri of Navarre,
in his struggle with the League and the Guises; the War of Religion. But
the poet calls the King “Ferdinand,” taking perhaps from some story this
non-existent son of Charles III of Navarre (died 1425): to whom,
according to Monstrelet, the Burgundian chronicler of that time, the
French king owed 200,000 ducats of gold. This is a transaction of the
early fifteenth century, and leads to the presence of the princess of
France as an envoy at the Court of Navarre in the play; the whole thing
is quite unhistorical, and has the air of being borrowed from some lost
story or brief novel. Bacon’s brother, Anthony, was English minister at
the Court of Navarre. What could tempt Bacon to pick out a
non-historical King Ferdinand of Navarre, plant him in the distant days
of Jeanne d’Arc, and make him, at that period, found an Academe for
three years of austere study and absence of women? But, if Bacon did
this, what could induce him to give to the non-existent Ferdinand, as
companions, the Maréchal de Biron with de Longueville (both of them, in
1589–93, the chief adherents of Henri of Navarre), and add to them
“Dumain,” that is, the Duc de Mayenne, one of the Guises, the deadly
foes of Henri and of the Huguenots? Even in the unhistorically minded
Shakespeare, the freak is of the most eccentric, — but in Bacon this
friskiness is indeed strange. I cannot, like Mr. Greenwood, find any
“allusions to the Civil War of France.” France and Navarre, in the play,
are in full peace.</p>
<p>The actual date of the fabulous King Ferdinand would have been about
1430. By introducing Biron, Longueville, and the Duc de Mayenne, and
Bankes’s celebrated educated horse, the author shifts the date to 1591.
But the Navarre of the play is a region “out of space, out of time,” a
fairy world of projected Academes (like that of the four young men in de
la Primaudaye’s L’Académie Française, Englished in 1586) and of peace,
while the actual King of Navarre of 1591 was engaged in a struggle for
life and faith; and in his ceaseless amours.</p>
<p>Many of Shakespeare’s anachronisms are easily intelligible. He takes
a novel or story about any remote period, or he chooses, as for the
Midsummer Night’s Dream, a period earlier than that of the Trojan war.
He gives to the Athens contemporary with the “Late Minoan III” period
(1600 B.C.?) a Duke, and his personages live like English nobles and
rustics of his own day, among the fairies of English folk-lore. It is
the manner of Chaucer and of the poets and painters of any age before
the end of the eighteenth century. The resulting anachronisms are
natural and intelligible. We do not expect war-chariots in Troilus and
Cressida; it is when the author makes the bronze-clad Achæans familiar
with Plato and Aristotle that we are surprised. In Love’s Labour’s Lost
we do not expect the author to introduce the manners of the early
fifteenth century, the date of the affair of the 200,000 ducats. Let the
play reflect the men and manners of 1589–93, — but why place Mayenne, a
fanatical Catholic foe of Navarre, among the courtiers of the Huguenot
King of Navarre?</p>
<p>As for de Mayenne (under the English spelling of the day Dumain)
appearing as a courtier of his hated adversary Henri, Bacon, of all men,
could not have made that absurd error. It was Shakespeare who took but
an absent-minded interest in foreign politics. If Bacon is building his
play on an affair, the ducats, of 1425–35 (roughly speaking), he should
not bring in a performing horse, trained by Bankes, a Staffordshire man,
which was performing its tricks at Shrewsbury — in 1591. Thus early we
find that great scholar mixing up chronology in a way which, in
Shakespeare even, surprises; but, in Bacon, seems quite out of
keeping.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, as Sir Sidney Lee says, gives Mayenne as “Dumain,” —
Mayenne, “whose name was so frequently mentioned in popular accounts of
French affairs in connection with Navarre’s movements that Shakespeare
was led to number him also among his supporters.” Bacon would not have
been so led! As Mayenne and Henri fought against each other at Ivry, in
1590, this was carrying nonsense far, even for Will, but for the
earnestly instructive Bacon!</p>
<p>“The habits of the author could not have been more scholastic,” so
Judge Webb is quoted, “if he had, like Bacon, spent three years in the
University of Cambridge . . . “ Bacon, or whoever corrected the play in
1598, might have corrected “primater” into “pia mater,” unless Bacon
intended the blunder for a malapropism of “Nathaniel, a Curate.” Either
Will or Bacon, either in fun or ignorance, makes Nathaniel turn a common
Italian proverb on Venice into gibberish. It was familiar in Florio’s
Second Frutes (1591), and First Frutes (1578), with the English
translation. The books were as accessible to Shakspere as to Bacon.
Either author might also draw from James Sandford’s Garden of Pleasure,
done out of the Italian in 1573–6.</p>
<p>Where the scholastic habits of Bacon at Cambridge are to be
discovered in this play, I know not, unless it be in Biron’s witty
speech against study. If the wit implies in the author a Cambridge
education, Costard and Dull and Holofernes imply familiarity with
rustics and country schoolmasters. Where the author proves that he
“could not have been more familiar with French politics if, like Bacon,
he had spent three years in the train of an Ambassador to France,” I
cannot conjecture. There are no French politics in the piece, any more
than there are “mysteries of fashionable life,” such as Bacon might have
heard of from Essex and Southampton. There is no “familiarity with all
the gossip of the Court”; there is no greater knowledge of foreign
proverbs than could be got from common English books. There is
abundance, indeed overabundance of ridicule of affected styles, and
quips, with which the literature of the day was crammed: call it
Gongorism, Euphuism, or what you please. One does not understand how or
where Judge Webb (in extreme old age) made all these discoveries,
sympathetically quoted by Mr. Greenwood. “Like Bacon, the author of the
play must have had a large command of books; he must have had his
“Horace,” his “Ovidius Naso,” and his “good old ‘Mantuan.’” What a
prodigious “command of books”! Country schoolmasters confessedly had
these books on the school desks. It was not even necessary for the
author to “have access to the Chronicles of Monstrelet.” It is not
known, we have said, whether or not such plot as the play possesses,
with King Ferdinand and the 100,000 ducats, or 200,000 ducats (needed to
bring the Princess and the mythical King Ferdinand of Navarre together),
were not adapted by the poet from an undiscovered conte, partly based on
a passage in Monstrelet.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be conceded that Love’s Labour’s Lost is not a play
which can easily be attributed to Bacon. We do not know how much of the
play existed before Shakespeare “augmented” it in 1598. We do not know
whether what he then corrected and augmented was an early work of his
own or from another hand, though probably it was his own. Molière
certainly corrected and augmented and transfigured, in his illustrious
career in Paris, several of the brief early sketches which he had
written when he was the chief of a strolling troupe in Southern
France.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood does not attribute the wit (such as it is), the quips,
the conceits, the affectations satirised in Love’s Labour’s Lost, to
Will’s knowledge of the artificial style then prevalent in all the
literatures of Western Europe, and in England most pleasingly used in
Lyly’s comedies. No, “the author must have been not only a man of high
intellectual culture, but one who was intimately acquainted with the
ways of the Court, and the fashionable society of his time, as also with
contemporary foreign politics.”</p>
<p>I search the play once more for the faintest hint of knowledge of
foreign politics. The embassy of the daughter of the King of France
(who, by the date of the affair of the ducats, should be Charles VII)
has been compared to a diplomatic sally of the mother of the childless
actual King of France (Henri III), in 1586, when Catherine de Medici was
no chicken. I do not see in the embassy of the Princess of the story any
“intimate acquaintance with contemporary foreign politics” about 1591–3.
The introduction of Mayenne as an adherent of the King of Navarre, shows
either a most confused ignorance of foreign politics on the part of the
author, or a freakish contempt for his public. I am not aware that the
author shows any “intimate acquaintance with the ways” of Elizabeth’s
Court, or of any other fashionable society, except the Courts which
Fancy held in plays.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood appears to be repeating “the case as to this very
remarkable play” as “well summed up by the late Judge Webb in his
Mystery of William Shakespeare” (). In that paralysing judicial summary,
as we have seen, “the author could not have been more familiar with
French politics if, like Bacon, he had spent three years in the train of
an Ambassador to France.” The French politics, in the play, are to send
the daughter of a King of France (the contemporary King Henri III was
childless) to conduct a negotiation about 200,000 ducats, at the Court,
steeped in peace, of a King of Navarre, a scholar who would fain be a
recluse from women, in an Academe of his own device. Such was not the
Navarre of Henri in his war with the Guises, and Henri did not shun the
sex!</p>
<p>Such are the “contemporary foreign politics,” the “French politics”
which the author knows — as intimately as Bacon might have known them.
They are not foreign politics, they are not French politics, they are
politics of fairy-land: with which Will was at least as familiar as
Bacon.</p>
<p>These, then, are the arguments in favour of Bacon, or the Great
Unknown, which are offered with perfect solemnity of assurance: and the
Baconians repeat them in their little books of popularisation and
propaganda. Quantula sapientia!</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>CONTEMPORARY RECOGNITION OF WILL AS AUTHOR</li>
</ol>
<p>It is absolutely impossible to prove that Will, or Bacon, or the Man
in the Moon, was the author of the Shakespearean plays and poems. But it
is easy to prove that Will was recognised as the author, by Ben Jonson,
Heywood, and Heminge and Condell the actors, to take the best witnesses.
Meanwhile we have received no hint that any man except Will was ever
suspected of being the author till 1856, when the twin stars of Miss
Delia Bacon and Mr. Smith arose. The evidence of Ben Jonson and the rest
can only prove that professed playwrights and actors, who knew Will both
on and off the stage, saw nothing in him not compatible with his work.
Had he been the kind of letterless country fellow, or bookless fellow
whom the Baconians and Mr. Greenwood describe, the contemporary
witnesses cited must have detected Will in a day; and the story of the
“Concealed Poet” who really, at first, did the additions and changes in
the Company’s older manuscript plays, and of the inconceivably impudent
pretences of Will of Stratford, would have kept the town merry for a
month. Five or six threadbare scholars would have sat down at a long
table in a tavern room, and, after their manner, dashed off a Comedy of
Errors on the real and the false playwright.</p>
<p>Baconians never seem to think of the mechanical difficulties in their
assumed literary hoax. If Will, like the old Hermit of Prague who never
saw pen and ink, could not even write, the hoax was a physical
impossibility. If he could write, but was a rough bookless man, his
condition would be scarcely the more gracious, even if he were able to
copy in his scrawl the fine Roman hand of the concealed poet. I am
surprised that the Baconians have never made that point. Will’s “copy”
was almost without blot or erasion, the other actors were wont to boast.
Really the absence of erasions and corrections is too easily explained
on the theory that Will was not the author. Will merely copied the fair
copies handed to him by the concealed poet. The farce was played for
some twenty years, and was either undetected or all concerned kept the
dread secret — and all the other companies and rival authors were
concerned in exposing the imposture.</p>
<p>The whole story is like the dream of a child. We therefore expect the
Anti-Willians to endeavour to disable the evidence of Jonson, Heywood,
Heminge, and Condell. Their attempts take the shape of the most
extravagant and complex conjectures; with certain petty objections to
Ben’s various estimates of the merits of the plays. He is constant in
his witness to the authorship. To these efforts of despair we return
later, when we hope to justify what is here deliberately advanced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we study Mr. Greenwood’s attempts to destroy or weaken the
testimony of contemporary literary allusions, in prose or verse, to the
plays as the work of the actor. Mr. Greenwood rests on an argument which
perhaps could only have occurred to legal minds, originally, perhaps to
the mind of Judge Webb, not in the prime vigour of his faculties. Not
very many literary allusions remain, made during Will’s life-time, to
the plays of Shakespeare. The writers, usually, speak of “Shakespeare,”
or “W. Shakespeare,” or “Will Shakespeare,” and leave it there. In the
same way, when they speak of other contemporaries, they name them, — and
leave it there, without telling us “who” (Frank) Beaumont, or (Kit)
Marlowe, or (Robin) Greene, or (Jack) Fletcher, or any of the others
“were.” All interested readers knew who they were: and also knew who
“Shakespeare” or “Will Shakespeare” was. No other Will
Shak(andandandandc.) was prominently before the literary and dramatic
world, in 1592–1616, except the Warwickshire provincial who played with
Burbage.</p>
<p>But though the mere names of the poets, Ben Jonson, Kit Marlowe,
Frank Beaumont, Harry Chettle, and so forth, are accepted as indicating
the well-known men whom they designate, this evidence to identity does
not satisfy Mr. Greenwood, and the Baconians, where Will is concerned.
“We should expect to find allusions to dramatic and poetical works
published under the name of ‘Shakespeare’; we should expect to find
Shakespeare spoken of as a poet and a dramatist; we should expect,
further, to find some few allusions to Shakespeare or Shakspere the
player. And these, of course, we do find; but these are not the objects
of our quest. What we require is evidence to establish the identity of
the player with the poet and dramatist; to prove that the player was the
author of the Plays and Poems. That is the proposition to be
established, and that the allusions fail, as it appears to me, to
prove,” says Mr. Greenwood. He adds, “At any rate they do not disprove
the theory that the true authorship was hidden under a pseudonym” —
which raises an entirely different question.</p>
<p>Makers of allusions to the plays must identify Shakespeare with the
actor, explicitly; must tell us who this Shakespeare was, though they
need not, and usually do not, tell us who the other authors mentioned
were; and though the world of letters and the Stage knew but one William
Shakspere or Shakespeare, who was far too familiar to them to require
further identification. But even if the makers of allusions did all
this, and said, “by W. Shakespeare the poet, we mean W. Shakespeare the
actor” — that is not enough. For they may all be deceived, may all
believe that a bookless, untutored man is the author. So we cannot get
evidence correct enough for Mr. Greenwood.</p>
<p>Destitute as I am of legal training, I leave this notable way of
disposing of the evidence to the judgement of the Bench and the Bar, a
layman intermeddleth not with it. Still, I am, like other readers, on
the Jury addressed, — I do not accept the arguments. Miror magis, as
Mr. Greenwood might quote Latin. We have already seen one example of
this argument, when Heywood speaks of the author of poems by
Shakespeare, published in The Passionate Pilgrim. Heywood does nothing
to identify the actor Shakspere with the author Shakespeare, says
Mr. Greenwood. I shall prove that, elsewhere, Heywood does identify
them, and no man knew more of the world of playwrights and actors than
Heywood. I add that in his remarks on The Passionate Pilgrim, Heywood
had no need to say “by W. Shakespeare I mean the well-known actor in the
King’s Company.” There was no other William Shakspere or Shakespeare
known to his public.</p>
<p>It is to no purpose that Mr. Greenwood denies, as we have seen above,
that the allusions “disprove the theory that the true authorship was
hidden under a pseudonym.” That is an entirely different question. He is
now starting quite another hare. Men of letters who alluded to the plays
and poems of William Shakespeare, meant the actor; that is my position.
That they may all have been mistaken: that “William Shakespeare” was
Bacon’s, or any one’s pseudonym, is, I repeat, a wholly different
question; and we must not allow the critic to glide away into it through
an “at any rate”; as he does three or four times. So far, then,
Mr. Greenwood’s theory that it was impossible for the actor Shakspere to
have been the author of the plays, encounters the difficulty that no
contemporary attributed them to any other hand: that none is known to
have said, “This Warwickshire man cannot be the author.”</p>
<p>“Let us, however, examine some of these allusions to Shakspere, real
or supposed,” says the critic. He begins with the hackneyed words of the
dying man of letters, Robert Greene, in A Groatsworth of Wit (1592). The
pamphlet is addressed to Gentlemen of his acquaintance “that spend their
wits in making plays”; he “wisheth them a better exercise,” and better
fortunes than his own. (Marlowe is supposed to be one of the three
Gentlemen playwrights, but such suppositions do not here concern us.)
Greene’s is the ancient feud between the players and the authors,
between capital and labour. The players are the capitalists, and buy the
plays out and out, — cheap. The author has no royalties; and no control
over the future of his work, which a Shakspere or a Bacon, a Jonson or a
Chettle, or any handyman of the company owning the play, may alter as he
pleases. It is highly probable that the actors also acquired most of the
popular renown, for, even now, playgoers have much to say about the
players in a piece, while they seldom know the name of the playwright.
Women fall in love with the actors, not with the authors; but with
“those puppets,” as Greene says, “that speake from our mouths, these
anticks, garnished in our colours.” Ben Jonson, we shall see, makes some
of the same complaints, — most natural in the circumstances: though he
managed to retain the control of his dramas; how, I do not know. Greene
adds that in his misfortunes, illness, and poverty, he is ungratefully
“forsaken,” by the players, and warns his friends that such may be their
lot; advising them to seek “some better exercise.” He then writes — and
his meaning cannot easily be misunderstood, I think, but misunderstood
it has been— “Yes, trust them not” (trust not the players), “FOR there
is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tyger’s
heart wrapt in a Player’s hide” (“Player’s” in place of “woman’s,” in an
old play, The Tragedy of Richard, Duke of York, andandandandc.),
“supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blank verse as the best of
you; and being an absolute Johannes Factotum, is in his own conceit the
only Shake-scene in a country.”</p>
<p>The meaning is pellucid. “Do not trust the players, my fellow
playwrights, for the reasons already given, for they, in addition to
their glory gained by mouthing our words, and their ingratitude, may now
forsake you for one of themselves, a player, who thinks his blank verse
as good as the best of yours” (including Marlowe’s, probably). “The man
is ready at their call” (“an absolute Johannes Factotum”). “In his own
conceit” he is “the only Shake-scene in a country.” “Seek you better
masters,” than these players, who have now an author among themselves,
“the only Shake-scene,” where the pun on Shakespeare does not look like
a fortuitous coincidence. But it may be, anything may happen.</p>
<p>The sense, I repeat, is pellucid. But Mr. Greenwood writes that if
Shake-scene be an allusion to Shakespeare “it seems clear that it is as
an actor rather than as an author he is attacked.” As an actor the
person alluded to is merely assailed with the other actors, his
“fellows.” But he is picked out as presenting another and a new reason
why authors should distrust the players, “for there is” among
themselves, “in a player’s hide,” “an upstart crow” — who thinks his
blank verse as good as the best of theirs. He is, therefore, necessarily
a playwright, and being a factotum, can readily be employed by the
players to the prejudice of Greene’s three friends, who are professed
playwrights.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood says that “we do not know why Greene should have been
so particularly bitter against the players, and why he should have
thought it necessary so seriously to warn his fellow playwrights against
them.” But we cannot help knowing; for Greene has told us. In addition
to gaining renown solely through mouthing “our” words, wearing “our
feathers,” they have been bitterly ungrateful to Greene in his poverty
and sickness; they will, in the same circumstances, as cruelly forsake
his friends; “yes, for they now have” an author, and to the playwrights
a dangerous rival, in their own fellowship. Thus we know with absolute
certainty why Greene wrote as he did. He says nothing about the superior
financial gains of the players, which Mr. Greenwood suspects to have
been the “only” cause of his bitterness. Greene gives its causes in the
plainest possible terms, as did Ben Jonson later, in his verses
“Poet-Ape” (Playwright-Actor). Moreover, Mr. Greenwood gives Greene’s
obvious motives on the very page where he says that we do not know
them.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Greenwood, anxious as he is to prove Shake-scene to be
attacked as an actor, admits that the words “supposes himself as well
able to bumbast out a blank verse as the best of you,” “do seem to have
that implication,” namely, that “Shake-scene” is a dramatic author: what
else can the words mean; why, if not for the Stage, should Shake-scene
write blank verse?</p>
<p>Finally Mr. Greenwood, after saying “it is clear that it is as an
actor rather than as an author that ‘Shake-scene’ is attacked,” concedes
that it “certainly looks as if he” (Greene) “meant to suggest that this
Shake-scene supposed himself able to compose, as well as to mouth
verses.” Nothing else can possibly be meant. “The rest of you” were
authors, not actors.</p>
<p>If not, why, in a whole company of actors, should “Shake-scene” alone
be selected for a special victim? Shake-scene is chosen out because, as
an author, a factotum always ready at need, he is more apt than the
professed playwrights to be employed as author by his company: this is a
new reason for not trusting the players.</p>
<p>I am not going to take the trouble to argue as to whether, in the
circumstances of the case, “Shake-scene” is meant by Greene for a pun on
“Shake-speare,” or not. If he had some other rising player-author, the
Factotum of a cry of players, in his mind, Baconians may search for that
personage in the records of the stage. That other player-author may have
died young, or faded into obscurity. The term “the only Shake-scene” may
be one of those curious coincidences which do occur. The presumption
lies rather on the other side. I demur, when Mr. Greenwood courageously
struggling for his case says that, even assuming the validity of the
surmise that there is an allusion to Shakspere, “the utmost that we
should be entitled to say is that Greene here accuses Player Shakspere
of putting forward, as his own, some work, or perhaps some parts of a
work, for which he was really indebted to another” (the Great Unknown?).
I do more than demur, I defy any man to exhibit that sense in Greene’s
words.</p>
<p>“The utmost that we should be entitled to say,” is, in my opinion,
what we have no shadow of a title to say. Look at the poor hackneyed,
tortured words of Greene again. “Yes, trust them not; for there is an
upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tyger’s heart
wrapped in a player’s hide, supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a
blank verse as the best of you; and being an absolute Johannes Factotum,
is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.”</p>
<p>How can mortal man squeeze from these words the charge that “Player
Shakspere” is “putting forward, as his own, some work, or perhaps some
parts of a work, for which he was really indebted to another”? It is as
an actor, with other actors, that the player is “beautified with our
feathers,” — not with the feathers of some one not ourselves, Bacon or
Mr. Greenwood’s Unknown. Mr. Greenwood even says that Shake-scene is
referred to “as beautified with the feathers which he has stolen from
the dramatic writers” (“our feathers”).</p>
<p>Greene says absolutely nothing about feathers “which he has stolen.”
The “feathers,” the words of the plays, were bought, not stolen, by the
actors, “anticks garnished in our colours.”</p>
<p>Tedious it is to write many words about words so few and simple as
those of Greene; meaning “do not trust the players, for one of them
writes blank verse which he thinks as good as the best of yours, and
fancies himself the only Shake-scene in a country.”</p>
<p>But “Greene here accuses Player Shakspere of putting forward, as his
own, some work, or perhaps some parts of a work, for which he was really
indebted to another,” this is “the utmost we should be entitled to say,”
even if the allusion be to Shakspere. How does Mr. Greenwood get the
Anti-Willian hypothesis out of Greene’s few and plain words?</p>
<p>It is much safer for him to say that “Shake-scene” is not meant for
Shakespeare. Nobody can prove that it is; the pun may be a strange
coincidence, — or any one may say that he thinks it nothing more; if he
pleases.</p>
<p>Greene nowhere “refers to this Shake-scene as being an impostor, an
upstart crow beautified with the feathers which he has stolen from the
dramatic writers (“our feathers”)” — that is, Greene makes no such
reference to Shake-scene in his capacity of writer of blank verse. Like
all players, who are all “anticks garnisht in our colours,” Shake-scene,
as player, is “beautified with our feathers.” It is Mr. Greenwood who
adds “beautified with the feathers which he has stolen from the dramatic
writers.” Greene does not even remotely hint at plagiarism on the part
of Shake-scene: and the feathers, the plays of Greene and his friends,
were not stolen but bought. We must take Greene’s evidence as we find
it, — it proves that by “Shake-scene” he means a “poet-ape,” a
playwright-actor; for Greene, like Jonson, speaks of actors as “apes.”
Both men saw in a certain actor and dramatist a suspected rival. Only
one such successful practising actor-playwright is known to us at this
date (1592–1601), — and he is Shakespeare. Unless another such existed,
Greene, in 1592, alludes to William Shak(andandandandc.) as a player and
playwright. This proves that the actor from Stratford was accepted in
Greene’s world as an author of plays in blank verse. He cannot,
therefore, have seemed incapable of his poetry.</p>
<p>Let us now briefly consider other contemporary allusions to
Shakespeare selected by Mr. Greenwood himself. No allusion can prove
that Shakespeare was the author of the work attributed to him in the
allusions. The plays and poems may have been by James VI and I, “a
parcel-poet.” The allusions can prove no more than that, by his
contemporaries, Shakespeare was believed to be the poet, which is
impossible if he were a mere rustic ignoramus, as the Baconians aver.
Omitting some remarks by Chettle on Greene’s Groatsworth of Wit, as, if
grammar goes for all, they do not refer to Shakespeare, we have the
Cambridge farce or comedy on contemporary literature, the Return from
Parnassus (1602?). The University wits laugh at Shakespeare, — not an
university man, as the favourite poet, in his Venus and Adonis, of a
silly braggart pretender to literature, Gullio.</p>
<p>They also introduce Kempe, the low comedy man of Shakespeare’s
company, speaking to Burbage, the chief tragic actor, of Shakespeare as
a member of their company, who, as an author of plays, “puts down” the
University wits “and Ben Jonson too.” The date is not earlier than that
of Ben’s satiric play on the poets, The Poetaster (1601), to which
reference is made. Since Kempe is to be represented as wholly ignorant,
his opinion of Shakespeare’s pre-eminent merit only proves, as in the
case of Gullio, that the University wits decried the excellences of
Shakespeare. In him they saw no scholar.</p>
<p>The point is that Kempe recognises Shakespeare as both actor and
author.</p>
<p>All this “is quite consistent with the theory that Shake-speare was a
pseudonym,” says Mr. Greenwood. Of course it is, but it is not
consistent with the theory that Shakespeare was an uneducated, bookless
rustic, for, in that case, his mask would have fallen off in a day, in
an hour. Of course the Cambridge author only proves, if you will, that
he thought that Kempe thought, that his fellow player was the author.
But we have better evidence of what the actors thought than in the
Cambridge play.</p>
<p>In 1598, as we saw, Francis Meres in Palladis Tamia credits
Shakespeare with Venus and Adonis, with privately circulated sonnets,
and with a number of the comedies and tragedies. How the allusions
“negative the hypothesis that Shakespeare was a nom de plume is not
apparent,” says Mr. Greenwood, always constant to his method. I repeat
that he wanders from the point, which is, here, that the only William
Shak(andandandandc.) known to us at the time, in London, was credited
with the plays and poems on all sides, which proves that no
incompatibility between the man and the works was recognised.</p>
<p>Then Weaver (1599) alludes to him as author of Venus, Lucrece, Romeo,
Richard, “more whose names I know not.” Davies (1610) calls him “our
English Terence” (the famous comedian), and mentions him as having
“played some Kingly parts in sport.” Freeman (1614) credits him with
Venus and Lucrece. “Besides in plays thy wit winds like Meander.” I
repeat Heywood’s evidence. Thomas Heywood, author of that remarkable
domestic play, A Woman Killed with Kindness, was, from the old days of
Henslowe, in the fifteen-nineties, a playwright and an actor; he
survived into the reign of Charles I. Writing on the familiar names of
the poets, “Jack Fletcher,” “Frank Beaumont,” “Kit Marlowe,” “Tom Nash,”
he says,</p>
<p>“Mellifluous Shakespeare whose enchanting quill</p>
<p>Commanded mirth and passion, was but ‘Will.’”</p>
<p>Does Heywood not identify the actor with the author? No quibbles
serve against the evidence.</p>
<p>We need not pursue the allusions later than Shakespeare’s death, or
invoke, at present, Ben Jonson’s panegyric of 1623. As to Davies, his
dull and obscure epigram is addressed “To our English Terence, Mr. Will
Shake-speare.” He accosts Shakespeare as “Good Will.” He remarks that,
“as some say,” if Will “had not played some Kingly parts in sport,” he
had been “a companion for a King,” and “been a King among the meaner
sort.” Nobody, now, can see the allusion and the joke. Shakespeare’s
company, in 1604, acted a play on the Gowrie Conspiracy of 1600. King
James suppressed the play after the second night, as, of course, he was
brought on the stage throughout the action: and in very droll and
dreadful situations. Did Will take the King’s part, and annoy gentle
King Jamie, “as some say”? Nobody knows. But Mr. Greenwood, to disable
Davies’s recognition of Mr. Will as a playwright, “Our English Terence,”
quotes, from Florio’s Montaigne, a silly old piece of Roman literary
gossip, Terence’s plays were written by Scipio and Laelius. In fact,
Terence alludes in his prologue to the Adelphi, to a spiteful report
that he was aided by great persons. The prologue may be the source of
the fable — that does not matter. Davies might get the fable in
Montaigne, and, knowing that some Great One wrote Will’s plays, might
therefore, in irony, address him as “Our English Terence.” This is a
pretty free conjecture! In Roman comedy he had only two names known to
him to choose from; he took Terence, not Plautus. But if Davies was in
the great Secret, a world of others must have shared le Secret de
Polichinelle. Yet none hints at it, and only a very weak cause could
catch at so tiny a straw as the off-chance that Davies knew, and used
“Terence” as a gibe.</p>
<p>The allusions, even the few selected, cannot prove that the actor
wrote the plays, but do prove that he was believed to have done so, and
therefore that he was not so ignorant and bookless as to demonstrate
that he was incapable of the poetry and the knowledge displayed in his
works. Mr. Greenwood himself observes that a Baconian critic goes too
far when he makes Will incapable of writing. Such a Will could deceive
no mortal. But does Mr. Greenwood, who finds in the Author of the plays
“much learning, and remarkable classical attainments,” or “a wide
familiarity with the classics,” suppose that his absolutely bookless
Will could have persuaded his intimates that he was the author of plays
exhibiting “a wide familiarity with the classics,” or “remarkable
classical attainments.” The thing is wholly impossible.</p>
<p>I do not remember that a single contemporary allusion to Shakespeare
speaks of him as “learned,” erudite, scholarly, and so forth. The
epithets for him are “sweet,” “gentle,” “honeyed,” “sugared,”
“honey-tongued” — this is the convention. The tradition followed by
Milton, who was eight years of age when Shakespeare died, and who wrote
L’Allegro just after leaving Cambridge, makes Shakespeare “sweetest
Shakespeare, Fancy’s child,” with “native wood-notes wild”; and gives to
Jonson “the learned sock.” Fuller, like Milton, was born eight years
before the death of Shakespeare, namely, in 1608. Like Milton he was a
Cambridge man. The First Folio of Shakespeare’s works appeared when each
of these two bookish men was aged fifteen. It would necessarily revive
interest in Shakespeare, now first known as far as about half of his
plays went: he would be discussed among lovers of literature at
Cambridge. Mr. Greenwood quotes Fuller’s remark that Shakespeare’s
“learning was very little,” that, if alive, he would confess himself “to
be never any scholar.” I cannot grant that Fuller is dividing the
persons of actor and author. Men of Shakespeare’s generation, such as
Jonson, did not think him learned; nor did men of the next generation.
If Mr. Collins’s view be correct, the men of Shakespeare’s and of
Milton’s generations were too ignorant to perceive that Shakespeare was
deeply learned in the literature of Rome, and in the literature of
Greece. Every one was too ignorant, till Mr. Collins came.</p>

<li>“THE SILENCE OF PHILIP HENSLOWE”</li>
</ol>
<p>When Shakespeare is mentioned as an author by contemporary writers,
the Baconian stratagem, we have seen, is to cry, “Ah, but you cannot
prove the author mentioned to be the actor.” We have seen that Meres
(1598) speaks of Shakespeare as the leading tragic and comic poet (“Poor
poet-ape that would be thought our chief,” quoth Jonson), as author of
Venus and Adonis, and as a sonneteer. “All this does nothing whatever to
support the idea that the Stratford player was the author of the plays
and poems alluded to,” says Mr. Greenwood, playing that card again.</p>
<p>The allusions, I repeat, do prove that Shak(andandandandc.), the
actor, was believed to be the author, till any other noted William
Shak(andandandandc.) is found to have been conspicuously before the
town. “There is nothing at all to prove that Meres, native of
Lincolnshire, had any personal knowledge of Shakespeare.” There is
nothing at all to prove that Meres, native of Lincolnshire, had any
personal knowledge of nine-tenths of the English authors, famous or
forgotten, whom he mentions. “On the question — who was Shakespeare? —
he throws no light.” He “throws no light on the question” “who was?” any
of the poets mentioned by him, except one, quite forgotten, whose
College he names . . . To myself this “sad repeated air,”— “critics who
praise Shakespeare do not say who Shakespeare was,” — would appear to
be, not an argument, but a subterfuge: though Mr. Greenwood honestly
believes it to be an argument, — otherwise he would not use it: much
less would he repeat it with frequent iteration. The more a man was
notorious, as was Will Shakspere the actor, the less the need for any
critic to tell his public “who Shakespeare was.”</p>
<p>As Mr. Greenwood tries to disable the evidence when Shakespeare is
alluded to as an author, so he tries to better his case when, in the
account-book of Philip Henslowe, an owner of theatres, money-lender,
pawn-broker, purchaser of plays from authors, and so forth, Shakespeare
is not mentioned at all. Here is a mystery which, properly handled, may
advance the great cause. Henslowe has notes of loans of money to several
actors, some of them of Shakespeare’s company, “The Lord Chamberlain’s.”
There is no such note of a loan to Shakespeare. Does this prove that he
was not an actor? If so, Burbage was not an actor; Henslowe never names
him.</p>
<p>There are notes of payments of money to Henslowe after each
performance of any play in one of his theatres. In these notes the name
of Shakespeare is never once mentioned as the author of any play. How
weird! But in these notes the names of the authors of the plays acted
are never mentioned. Does this suggest that Bacon wrote all these
plays?</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are frequent mentions of advances of money
to authors who were working at plays for Henslowe, singly, or in pairs,
threes, fours, or fives. We find Drayton, Dekker, Chapman, and nine
authors now forgotten by all but antiquarians. We have also Ben Jonson
(1597), Marston, Munday, Middleton, Webster, and others, authors in
Henslowe’s pay. But the same of Shakespeare never appears. Mysterious!
The other men’s names, writes Dr. Furness, occur “because they were all
writers for Henslowe’s theatre, but we must wait at all events for the
discovery of some other similar record, before we can produce
corresponding memoranda regarding Shaksper” (sic) “and his
productions.”</p>
<p>The natural mind of the ordinary man explains all by saying,
“Henslowe records no loans of money to Shakspere the actor, because he
lent him no money. He records no payments for plays to Shakespeare the
author-actor, because to Henslowe the actor sold no plays.” That is the
whole explanation of the Silence of Philip Henslowe. If Shakspere did
sell a play to Henslowe, why should that financier omit the fact from
his accounts? Suppose that the actor was illiterate as Baconians
fervently believe, and sold Bacon’s plays, what prevented him from
selling a play of Bacon’s (under his own name, as usual) to Henslowe? To
obtain a Baconian reply you must wander into conjecture, and imagine
that Bacon forbade the transaction. Then why did he forbid it? Because
he could get a better price from Shakspere’s company? The same cause
would produce the same effect on Shakspere himself; whether he were the
author, or were Bacon’s, or any man’s go-between. On any score but that
of money, why was Henslowe good enough for Ben Jonson, Dekker, Heywood,
Middleton, and Webster, and not good enough for Bacon, who did not
appear in the matter at all, but was represented in it by the actor,
Will? As a gentleman and a man of the Court, Bacon would be as much
discredited if he were known to sell (for £6 on an average) his noble
works to the Lord Chamberlain’s Company, as if he sold them to
Henslowe.</p>
<p>I know not whether the great lawyer, courtier, scholar, and
philosopher is supposed by Baconians to have given Will Shakspere a
commission on his sales of plays; or to have let him keep the whole sum
in each case. I know not whether the players paid Shakspere a sum down
for his (or Bacon’s) plays, or whether Will received a double share, or
other, or any share of the profits on them, as Henslowe did when he let
a house to the players. Nobody knows any of these things.</p>
<p>“If Shakspere the player had been a dramatist, surely Henslowe would
have employed him also, like the others, in that behalf.” Henslowe
would, if he could have got the “copy” cheap enough. Was any one of “the
others,” the playwrights, a player, holding a share in his company? If
not, the fact makes an essential difference, for Shakspere was a
shareholder. Collier, in his preface to Henslowe’s so-called “Diary,”
mentions a playwright who was bound to scribble for Henslowe only (Henry
Porter), and another, Chettle, who was bound to write only for the
company protected by the Earl of Nottingham. Modern publishers and
managers sometimes make the same terms with novelists and
playwrights.</p>
<p>It appears to me that Shakspere’s company would be likely, as his
plays were very popular, to make the same sort of agreement with him,
and to give him such terms as he would be glad to accept, — whether the
wares were his own — or Bacon’s. He was a keen man of business. In such
a case, he would not write for Henslowe’s pittance. He had a better
market. The plays, whether written by himself, or Bacon, or the Man in
the Moon, were at his disposal, and he did not dispose of them to
Henslowe, wherefore Henslowe cannot mention him in his accounts. That is
all.</p>
<p>Quoting an American Judge (Dr. Stotsenburg, apparently),
Mr. Greenwood cites the circumstance that, in two volumes of Alleyn’s
papers “there is not one mention of such a poet as William Shaksper in
his list of actors, poets, and theatrical comrades.” If this means that
Shakspere is not mentioned by Alleyn among actors, are we to infer that
William was not an actor? Even Baconians insist that he was an actor.
“How strange, how more than strange,” cries Mr. Greenwood, “that
Henslowe should make no mention in all this long diary, embracing all
the time from 1591 to 1609, of the actor-author . . . No matter. Credo
quia impossibile!” Credo what? and what is impossible? Henslowe’s volume
is no Diary; he does not tell a single anecdote of any description; he
merely enters loans, gains, payments. Does Henslowe mention, say, Ben
Jonson, when he is not doing business with Ben? Does he mention any
actor or author except in connection with money matters? Then, if he did
no business with Shakspere the actor, in borrowing or lending, and did
no business with Shakespeare the author, in borrowing, lending, buying
or selling, “How strange, how more than strange” it would be if Henslowe
did mention Shakespeare! He was not keeping a journal of literary and
dramatic jottings. He was keeping an account of his expenses and
receipts. He never names Richard Burbage any more than he mentions
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood again expresses his views about this dark suspicious
mystery, the absence of Shakespeare or Shakspere (or Shak, as you like
it), from Henslowe’s accounts, if Shak(andandandandc.) wrote plays. But
the mystery, if mystery there be, is just as obscure if the actor were
the channel through which Bacon’s plays reached the stage, for the
pretended author of these masterpieces. Shak — was not the man to do all
the troking, bargaining, lying, going here and there, and making himself
a motley to the view for £0, 0s. 0d. If he were a sham, a figure-head, a
liar, a fetcher-and-carrier of manuscripts, he would be paid for it. But
he did not deal with Henslowe in his bargainings, and that is why
Henslowe does not mention him. Mr. Greenwood, in one place, agrees, so
far, with me. “Why did Henslowe not mention Shakespeare as the writer of
other plays” (than Titus Andronicus and Henry VI)? “I think the answer
is simple enough.” (So do I.) “Neither Shakspere nor ‘Shakespeare’ ever
wrote for Henslowe!” The obvious is perceived at last; and the reason
given is “that he was above Henslowe’s ‘skyline,’” “he” being the
Author. We only differ as to why the author was above Henslowe’s
“sky-line.” I say, because good Will had a better market, that of his
Company. I understand Mr. Greenwood to think, — because the Great
Unknown was too great a man to deal with Henslowe. If to write for the
stage were discreditable, to deal (unknown) with Henslowe was no more
disgraceful than to deal with “a cry of players”; and as (unknown) Will
did the bargaining, the Great Unknown was as safe with Will in one case
as in the other. If Will did not receive anything for the plays from his
own company (who firmly believed in his authorship), they must have
said, “Will! dost thou serve the Muses and thy obliged fellows for
naught? Dost thou give us two popular plays yearly, — gratis?”</p>
<p>Do you not see that, in the interests of the Great Secret itself,
Will had to take the pay for the plays (pretended his) from somebody.
Will Shakspere making his dear fellows and friends a present of two
masterpieces yearly was too incredible. So I suppose he did have
royalties on the receipts, or otherwise got his money; and, as he
certainly did not get them from Henslowe, Henslowe had no conceivable
reason for entering Will’s name in his accounts.</p>
<p>Such are the reflections of a plain man, but to an imaginative soul
there seems to be a brooding mist, with a heart of fire, which half
conceals and half reveals the darkened chamber wherein abides “The
Silence of Philip Henslowe.” “The Silence of Philip Henslowe,”
Mr. Greenwood writes, “is a very remarkable phenomenon . . . “ It is a
phenomenon precisely as remarkable as the absence of Mr. Greenwood’s
name from the accounts of a boot-maker with whom he has never had any
dealings.</p>
<p>“If, however, there was a man in high position, ‘a concealed poet,’”
who “took the works of others and rewrote and transformed them, besides
bringing out original plays of his own . . . then it is natural enough
that his name should not appear among those [of the] for the most part
impecunious dramatists to whom Henslowe paid money for playwriting.”
Nothing can be more natural, and, in fact, the name of Bacon, or
Southampton, or James VI, or Sir John Ramsay, or Sir Walter Raleigh, or
Sir Fulke Greville, or any other “man in high position,” does not appear
in Henslowe’s accounts. Nor does the name of William
Shak(andandandandc.). But why should it not appear if Will sold either
his own plays, or those of the noble friend to whom he lent his name and
personality — to Henslowe? Why not?</p>
<p>Then consider the figure, to my mind impossible, of the great
“concealed poet” “of high position,” who can “bring out original plays
of his own,” and yet “takes the works of others,” say of “sporting Kyd,”
or of Dekker and Chettle, and such poor devils, — takes them as a Yankee
pirate-publisher takes my rhymes, — and “rewrites and transforms
them.”</p>
<p>Bacon (or Bungay) cannot “take” them without permission of their
legal owners, — Shakspere’s or any other company; — of any one, in
short, who, as Ben Jonson says, “buys up reversions of old plays.” How
is he to manage these shabby dealings? Apparently he employs Will
Shakspere, spells his own “nom de plume” “Shakespeare,” and has his
rewritings and transformations of the destitute author’s work acted by
Will’s company. What a situation for Bacon, or Sir Fulke Greville, or
James VI, or any “man in high position” whom fancy can suggest! The
plays by the original authors, whoever they were, could only be obtained
by the “concealed poet” and “man in high position” from the legal
owners, Shakspere’s company, usually. The concealed poet had to
negotiate with the owners, and Bacon (or whoever he was) employed that
scamp Will Shakspere, first, I think, to extract the plays from the
owners, and then to pretend that he himself, even Will, had “rewritten
and transformed them.”</p>
<p>What an associate was our Will for the concealed poet; how certain it
was that Will would blackmail the “man in high position”! “Doubtless” he
did: we find Bacon arrested for debt, more than once, while Will buys
New Place, in Stratford, with the money extorted from the concealed poet
of high position. Bacon did associate with that serpent Phillips, a
reptile of Walsingham, who forged a postscript to Mary Stuart’s letter
to Babington. But now, if not Bacon, then some other concealed poet of
high position, with a mysterious passion for rewriting and transforming
plays by sad, needy authors, is in close contact with Will Shakspere,
the Warwickshire poacher and ignorant butcher’s boy, country
schoolmaster, draper’s apprentice, enfin, tout le tremblement.</p>
<p>“How strange, how more than strange!”</p>
<p>The sum of the matter seems to me to be that from as early as March
3, 1591, we find Henslowe receiving small sums of money for the
performances of many plays. He was paid as owner or lessee of the House
used by this or that company. On March 3, 1591, the play acted by “Lord
Strange’s (Derby’s) men” was Henry VI. Several other plays with names
familiar in Shakespeare’s Works, such as Titus Andronicus, all the three
parts of Henry VI, King Leare (April 6, 1593), Henry V (May 14, 1592),
The Taming of a Shrew (June 11, 1594), and Hamlet, paid toll to
Henslowe. He “received” so much, on each occasion, when they were acted
in a theatre of his. But he never records his purchase of these plays;
and it is not generally believed that Shakespeare was the author of all
these plays, in the form which they bore in 1591–4: though there is much
difference of opinion.</p>
<p>There is one rather interesting case. On August 25, 1594, Henslowe
enters “ne” (that is, “a new play”) “Received at the Venesyon Comodey,
eighteen pence.” That was his share of the receipts. The Lord
Chamberlain’s Company, that of Shakespeare, was playing in Henslowe’s
theatre at Newington Butts. If the “Venesyon Comodey” (Venetian Comedy)
were The Merchant of Venice, this is the first mention of it. But nobody
knows what Henslowe meant by “the Venesyon Comodey.” He does not mention
the author’s name, because, in this part of his accounts he never does
mention the author or authors. He only names them when he buys from, or
lends to, or has other money dealings with the authors. He had none with
Shakespeare, hence the Silence of Philip Henslowe.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE LATER LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE — HIS MONUMENT AND PORTRAITS</li>
</ol>
<p>In the chapter on the Preoccupations of Bacon the reader may find
help in making up his mind as to whether Bacon, with his many and
onerous duties and occupations, his scientific studies, and his
absorbing scientific preoccupation, is a probable author of the
Shakespearean plays. Mr. Greenwood finds the young Shakspere impossible
— because of his ignorance — which made him such a really good
pseudo-author, and such a successful mask for Bacon, or Bacon’s unknown
equivalent. The Shakspere of later life, the well-to-do Shakspere, the
purchaser of the right to bear arms; so bad at paying one debt at least;
so eager a creditor; a would-be encloser of a common; a man totally
bookless, is, to Mr. Greenwood’s mind, an impossible author of the later
plays.</p>
<p>Here, first, are moral objections on the ground of character as
revealed in some legal documents concerning business. Now, I am very
ready to confess that William’s dealings with his debtors, and with one
creditor, are wholly unlike what I should expect from the author of the
plays. Moreover, the conduct of Shelley in regard to his wife was, in my
opinion, very mean and cruel, and the last thing that we could have
expected from one who, in verse, was such a tender philanthropist, and
in life was — women apart — the best-hearted of men. The conduct of
Robert Burns, alas, too often disappoints the lover of his Cottar’s
Saturday Night and other moral pieces. He was an inconsistent
walker.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish that Shakespeare had been less hard in money
matters, just as I wish that in financial matters Scott had been more
like himself, that he had not done the last things that we should have
expected him to do. As a member of the Scottish Bar it was inconsistent
with his honour to be the secret proprietor of a publishing and a
printing business. This is the unexplained moral paradox in the career
of a man of chivalrous honour and strict probity: but the fault did not
prevent Scott from writing his novels and poems. Why, then, should the
few bare records of Shakspere’s monetary transactions make his
authorship impossible? The objection seems weakly sentimental.</p>
<p>Macaulay scolds Scott as fiercely as Mr. Greenwood scolds Shakspere,
— for the more part, ignorantly and unjustly. Still, there is matter to
cause surprise and regret. Both Scott and Shakspere are accused of
writing for gain, and of spending money on lands and houses with the
desire to found families. But in the mysterious mixture of each human
personality, any sober soul who reflects on his own sins and failings
will not think other men’s failings incompatible with intellectual
excellence. Bacon’s own conduct in money matters was that of a man
equally grasping and extravagant. Ben Jonson thus describes Shakespeare
as a social character: “He was indeed honest, and of an open and free
nature . . . I loved the man and do honour his memory on this side
idolatry as much as any.” Perhaps Ben never owed money to Shakspere and
refused to pay!</p>
<p>We must not judge a man’s whole intellectual character, and declare
him to be incapable of poetry, on the score of a few legal papers about
matters of business. Apparently Shakspere helped that Elizabethan
Mr. Micawber, his father, out of a pecuniary slough of despond, in which
the ex-High Bailiff of the town was floundering, — pursued by the
distraint of one of the friendly family of Quiney — Adrian Quiney. They
were neighbours and made a common dunghill in Henley Street. I do not,
like Mr. Greenwood, see anything “at all out of the way” in the
circumstance “that a man should be writing Hamlet, and at the same time
bringing actions for petty sums lent on loan at some unspecified
interest.” Nor do I see anything at all out of the way in Bacon’s
prosecution of his friend and benefactor, Essex (1601), while Bacon was
writing Hamlet. Indeed, Shakspere’s case is the less “out of the way” of
the two. He wanted his loan to be repaid, and told his lawyer to bring
an action. Bacon wanted to keep his head (of inestimable value) on his
shoulders; or to keep his body out of the Tower; or he merely, as he
declares, wanted to do his duty as a lawyer of the Crown. In any case,
Bacon was in a tragic position almost unexampled; and was at once
overwhelmed by work, and, one must suppose, by acute distress of mind,
in the case of Essex. He must have felt this the more keenly, if, as
some Baconians vow, he wrote the Sonnets to Essex. Whether he were
writing his Hamlet when engaged in Essex’s case (1601), or any other of
his dramatic masterpieces, even this astonishing man must have been
sorely bestead to combine so many branches of business.</p>
<p>Thus I would reply to Mr. Greenwood’s amazement that Shakspere, a
hard creditor, and so forth, should none the less have been able to
write his plays. But if it is meant that a few business transactions
must have absorbed the whole consciousness of Shakespeare, and left him
neither time nor inclination for poetry, consider the scientific
preoccupation of Bacon, his parliamentary duties, his ceaseless activity
as “one of the legal body-guard of the Queen” at a time when he had
often to be examining persons accused of conspiracy, — and do not forget
his long and poignant anxiety about Essex, his constant efforts to
reconcile him with Elizabeth, and to advocate his cause without losing
her favour; and, finally, the anguish of prosecuting his friend, and of
knowing how hardly the world judged his own conduct. Follow him into his
relations with James I; his eager pursuit of favour, the multiplicity of
his affairs, his pecuniary distresses, and the profound study and severe
labour entailed by the preparation for and the composition of The
Advancement of Learning (1603–5). He must be a stout-hearted Baconian
who can believe that, between 1599 and 1605, Bacon was writing Hamlet,
and other masterpieces of tragedy or comedy. But all is possible to
genius. What Mr. Greenwood’s Great Unknown was doing at this period,
“neither does he know, nor do I know, but he only.” He, no doubt, had
abundance of leisure.</p>
<p>At last Shakspere died (1616), and had not the mead of one melodious
tear, as far as we know, from the London wits, in the shape of obituary
verses. This fills Mr. Greenwood with amazement. “Was it because ‘the
friends of the Muses’ were for the most part aware that Shakespeare had
not died with Shakspere?” Did Jonson perchance think that his idea might
be realised when he wrote,</p>
<p>“What a sight it were,</p>
<p>To see thee in our waters yet appear”?</p>
<p>and so on. Did Jonson expect and hope to see the genuine
“Shakespeare” return to the stage, seven years after the death of
Shakspere the actor, the Swan of Avon? As Jonson was fairly sane, we can
no more suspect him of having hoped for this miracle than believe that
most of the poets knew the actor not to be the author. Moreover Jonson,
while desiring that Shakespeare might “shine forth” again and cheer the
drooping stage, added,</p>
<p>“Which since thy flight from hence hath mourned like Night,</p>
<p>And despairs day, but for thy volume’s light,”</p>
<p>that is — the Folio of 1623. Ben did not weave the amazing tissue of
involved and contradictory falsities attributed to him by Baconians.
Beaumont died in the same year as Shakspere, who died in the depths of
the country, weary of London. Has Mr. Greenwood found obituary poems
dropped on the grave of the famous Beaumont? Did Fletcher, did Jonson,
produce one melodious tear for the loss of their friend; in Fletcher’s
case his constant partner? No? Were the poets, then, aware that Beaumont
was a humbug, whose poems and plays were written by Bacon?</p>
<p>I am not to discuss Shakespeare’s Will, the “second-best bed,” and so
forth. But as Shakespeare’s Will says not a word about his books, it is
decided by Mr. Greenwood that he had no books. Mr. Greenwood is a
lawyer; so was my late friend Mr. Charles Elton, Q.C., of White
Staunton, who remarks that Shakespeare bequeathed “all the rest of my
goods, chattels, leases, andandandandc., to my son-in-law, John Hall,
gent.” (He really was a “gent.” with authentic coat-armour.)</p>
<p>It is with Mr. Elton’s opinion, not with my ignorance, that
Mr. Greenwood must argue in proof of the view that “goods” are
necessarily exclusive of books, for Mr. Elton takes it as a quite
natural fact that Shakespeare’s books passed, with his other goods, to
Mr. Hall, and thence to a Mr. Nash, to whom Mr. Hall left “my study of
books” (library). I only give this as a lawyer’s opinion.</p>
<p>There is in the Bodleian an Aldine Ovid, “with Shakespeare’s”
signature (merely Wm. She.), and a note, “This little volume of Ovid was
given to me by W. Hall, who sayd it was once Will Shakespeare’s.” I do
not know that the signature (like that on Florio’s Montaigne, in the
British Museum) has been detected as a forgery; nor do I know that
Shakespeare’s not specially mentioning his books proves that he had
none. Lawyers appear to differ as to this inference: both Mr. Elton and
Mr. Greenwood seem equally confident. But if it were perfectly natural
that the actor, Shakspere, should have no books, then he certainly made
no effort, by the local colour of owning a few volumes, to persuade
mankind that he was the author. Yet they believed that he was — really
there is no wriggling out of it. As regards any of his own MSS. which
Shakespeare may have had (one would expect them to be at his theatre),
and their monetary value, if they were not, as usual, the property of
his company, and of him as a member thereof, we can discuss that
question in the section headed “The First Folio.”</p>
<p>It appears that Shakespeare’s daughter, Judith, could write no more
than her grandfather. Nor, I repeat, could the Lady Jane Gordon,
daughter of the great Earl of Huntly, when she was married to the Earl
of Bothwell in 1566. At all events, Lady Jane “made her mark.” It may be
feared that Judith, brought up in that very illiterate town of
Stratford, under an illiterate mother, was neglected in her education.
Sad, but very common in women of her rank, and scarcely a proof that her
father did not write the plays.</p>
<p>As “nothing is known of the disposition and character” of
Shakespeare’s grand-daughter, Lady Barnard, who died in 1670, it is not
so paralysingly strange that nothing is known of any relics or anecdotes
of Shakespeare which she may have possessed. Mr. Greenwood “would have
supposed that she would have had much to say about the great poet,”
exhibited his books (if any), and so forth. Perhaps she did, — but how,
if we “know nothing about her disposition and character,” can we tell?
No interviewers rushed to her house (Abington Hall, Northampton-shire)
with pencils and notebooks to record her utterances; no reporter
interviewed her for the press. It is surprising, is it not?</p>
<p>The inference might be drawn, in the Baconian manner, that, during
the Commonwealth and Restoration, “the friends of the Muses” knew that
the actor was not the author, and therefore did not interview his
granddaughter in the country.</p>
<p>“But, at any rate, we have the Stratford monument,” says
Mr. Greenwood, and delves into this problem. Even the Stratford monument
of Shakespeare in the parish church is haunted by Baconian mysteries. If
the gentle reader will throw his eye over the photograph of the monument
as it now exists, he may not be able to say to the face of the poet
—</p>
<p>“Thou wast that all to me, Will,</p>
<p>For which my soul did pine.”</p>
<p>But if he has any knowledge of Jacobean busts on monuments, he will
probably agree with me in saying, “This effigy, though executed by
somebody who was not a Pheidias, and who perhaps worked merely from
descriptions, is, at all events, Jacobean.” The same may assuredly be
said of the monument; it is in good Jacobean style: the pillars with
their capitals are graceful: all the rest is in keeping; and the two
inscriptions are in the square capital letters of inscriptions of the
period; not in italic characters. Distrusting my own expertise, I have
consulted Sir Sidney Colvin, and Mr. Holmes of the National Portrait
Gallery. They, with Mr. Spielmann, think the work to be of the early
seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Next, glance at the figure opposite. This is a reproduction of “the
earliest representation of the Bust” (and monument) in Dugdale’s
Antiquities of Warwickshire (1656). Compare the two objects, point by
point, from the potato on top with holes in it, of Dugdale, which is
meant for a skull, through all the details, — bust and all. Does
Dugdale’s print, whether engraved by Hollar or not, represent a Jacobean
work? Look at the two ludicrous children, their legs dangling in air; at
the lions’ heads above the capitals of the pillars; at the lettering of
the two visible words of the inscription, and at the gloomy
hypochondriac or lunatic, clasping a cushion to his abdomen. That
hideous design was not executed by an artist who “had his eye on the
object,” if the object were a Jacobean monument: while the actual
monument was fashioned in no period of art but the Jacobean. From
Digges’ rhymes in the Folio of 1623, we know that Shakespeare already
had his “Stratford monument.” The existing object is what he had; the
monument in Dugdale is what, I hope, no architect of 1616–23 could have
imagined or designed.</p>
<p>Dugdale’s engraving is not a correct copy of any genuine Jacobean
work of art. Is Dugdale accurate in his reproductions of other monuments
in Stratford Church? To satisfy himself on this point, Sir George
Trevelyan, as he wrote to me (June 13, 1912), “made a sketch of the
Carew Renaissance monument in Stratford Church, and found that the
discrepancies between the original tomb and the representation in
Dugdale’s Warwickshire are far and away greater than in the monument to
William Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, while justly observing that “the little sitting
figures . . . are placed as no monumental sculptor would place them,”
“on the whole sees no reason at all why we should doubt the substantial
accuracy of Dugdale’s figure . . . It is impossible to suppose that
Hollar would have drawn and that Dugdale would have published a mere
travesty of the Stratford Monument.”</p>
<p>I do not know who drew the design, but a travesty of Jacobean work it
is in every detail of the monument. A travesty is what Dugdale gives as
a representation of the Carew monument. Mr. Greenwood, elsewhere,
repeating his criticism of the impossible figures of children, says:
“This is certainly mere matter of detail, and, in the absence of other
evidence, would give us no warrant for doubting the substantial accuracy
of Dugdale’s presentment of the ‘Shakespeare’ bust.”</p>
<p>Why are we to believe that Dugdale’s artist was merely fantastic in
his design of the children (and also remote from Jacobean taste in every
detail), and yet to credit him with “substantial accuracy” in his
half-length of a gloomy creature clutching a cushion to his stomach?
With his inaccuracies as to the Carew monument, why are we to accept him
as accurate in his representation of the bust? Moreover, other evidence
is not wanting. It is positively certain that the monument existing in
1748, was then known as “the original monument,” and that no other
monument was put in its place, at that date or later.</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Stopes argues that in 1748 the monument was “entirely
reconstructed,” and so must have become no longer what Dugdale’s man
drew, but what we see to-day. It is positively certain that her opinion
is erroneous.</p>
<p>If ever what we see to-day was substituted for anything like what
Dugdale’s man drew, the date of the substitution is unknown.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stopes herself discovered the documents which disprove her
theory. They were known to Halliwell-Phillipps, who quotes an unnamed
“contemporary account.” This account Mrs. Stopes, with her tireless
industry, found in the Wheler manuscripts, among papers of the
Rev. Joseph Greene, in 1746 Head Master of the Grammar School. In one
paper of September 1740 “the original monument” is said to be “much
impaired and decayed.” There was a scheme for making “a new monument” in
Westminster Abbey. That, I venture to think, would have been in
Hanoverian, not in Jacobean taste and style. But there was no money for
a new monument. Mrs. Stopes also found a paper of November 20, 1748,
showing that in September 1746, Mr. Ward (grandfather of Mrs. Siddons)
was at Stratford with “a cry of players.” He devoted the proceeds of a
performance of Othello to the reparation of the then existing monument.
The amount was twelve pounds ten shillings. The affair dragged on, one
of the Church-wardens, a blacksmith, held the £12, 10s., and was
troublesome. The document of November 20, 1748, was drawn up to be
signed, but was not signed, by the persons who appear to be chiefly
concerned in the matter. It directed that Mr. Hall, a local limner or
painter, is to “take care, according to his ability, that the monument
shall become as like as possible to what it was when first erected.”
This appears to have been the idea of Mr. Greene. Another form of words
was later adopted, directing Mr. Hall, the painter, “to repair and
beautify, or to have the direction of repairing and beautifying, the
original monument of Shakespeare the poet.” Mrs. Stopes infers, justly
in my opinion, that Hall “would fill up the gaps, restore what was
amissing as he thought it ought to be, and finally repaint it according
to the original colours, traces of which he might still be able to see.”
In his History and Antiquities of Stratford-on-Avon, Mr. Wheler tells us
that this was what Hall did. “In the year 1748 the monument was
carefully repaired, and the original colours of the bust,
andandandandc., as much as possible preserved by Mr. John Hall, limner,
of Stratford.”</p>
<p>It follows that we see the original monument and bust, but the
painting is of 1861, for the bust, says Wheler, was in 1793 “painted in
white,” to please Malone. It was repainted in 1861.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stopes, unluckily, is not content with what Hall was told to do,
and what, according to Wheler, he did. She writes: “It would only be
giving good value for his money” (£12, 10s.) “to his churchwardens if
Hall added (sic) a cloak, a pen, and manuscript.” He “could not help
changing” the face, and so on.</p>
<p>Now it was physically impossible to add a cloak, a pen, and
manuscript to such a stone bust as Dugdale’s man shows; to take away the
cushion pressed to the stomach, and to alter the head. Mr. Hall, if he
was to give us the present bust, had to make an entirely new bust, and,
to give us the present monument in place of that shown in Dugdale’s
print, had to construct an entirely new monument. Now Hall was a
painter, not (like Giulio Romano) also an architect and sculptor. Pour
tout potage he had but £12, 10s. He could not do, and he did not do
these things! he did not destroy “the original monument” and make a new
monument in Jacobean style. He was straitly ordered to “repair and
beautify the original monument”; he did repair it, and repainted the
colours. That is all. I do not quote what Halliwell-Phillipps tells us
about the repairing of the forefinger and thumb of the right hand, and
the pen; work which, he says, had to be renewed by William Roberts of
Oxford in 1790. He gives no authority, and Baconians may say that he was
hoaxed, or “lied with circumstance.”</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood quotes Halliwell-Phillipps’s Works of Shakespeare
(1853), in which he says that the design in Dugdale’s book “is evidently
too inaccurate to be of any authority; the probability being that it was
not taken from the monument itself.” Indeed the designer is so
inaccurate that he gives the first word of the Latin inscription as
“Judicyo,” just as Oudry blunders in the Latin inscription of a portrait
of Mary Stuart which he copied badly. Mr. Greenwood proceeds: “In his
Outlines Halliwell simply ignores Dugdale. His engraving was doubtless
too inconvenient to be brought to public notice!” Here Halliwell is
accused of suppressing the truth; if he invented his minute details
about the repeated reparation of the writing hand, — not represented in
Dugdale’s design, — he also lied with circumstance. But he certainly
quoted a genuine “contemporary account” of the orders for repairing and
beautifying the original monument in 1748, and I presume that he also
had records for what he says about reparations of the hand and pen. He
speaks, too, of substitutions for decayed alabaster parts of the
monument, though not in his Outlines; and I observe that, in
Mrs. Stopes’s papers, there is record of a meeting on December 20, 1748,
at which mention was made of “the materials” which Hall was to use for
repairs.</p>
<p>To me the evidence of the style as to the date of both monument and
bust speaks so loudly for their accepted date (1616–23) and against the
Georgian date of 1748, that I need no other evidence; nor do I suppose
that any one familiar with the monumental style of 1590–1620 can be of a
different opinion. In the same way I do not expect any artist or
engraver to take the engraving of the monument in Rowe’s Shakespeare
(1709), and that by Grignion so late as 1786, for anything but copies of
the design in Dugdale, with modifications made à plaisir. In Pope’s
edition (1725) Vertue gives the monument with some approach to accuracy,
but for the bald plump face of the bust presents a top-heavy and
sculpturally impossible face borrowed from “the Chandos portrait,”
which, in my opinion, is of no more authority than any other portrait of
Shakespeare. None of them, I conceive, was painted from the life.</p>
<p>The Baconians show a wistful longing to suppose the original bust,
copied in Dugdale, to have been meant for Bacon; but we need not waste
words over this speculation. Mr. Greenwood writes that “if I should be
told that Dugdale’s effigy represented an elderly farmer deploring an
exceptionally bad harvest, ‘I should not feel it to be strange!’ Neither
should I feel it at all strange if I were told that it was the
presentment of a philosopher and Lord Chancellor, who had fallen from
high estate and recognised that all things are but vanity.”</p>
<p>“I should not feel it to be strange” if a Baconian told me that the
effigy of a living ex-Chancellor were placed in the monument of the dead
Will Shakspere, and if, on asking why the alteration was made, I were
asked in reply, in Mr. Greenwood’s words, “Was Dugdale’s bust thought to
bear too much resemblance to one who was not Shakspere of Stratford? Or
was it thought that the presence of a woolsack” (the cushion) “might be
taken as indicating that Shakspere of Stratford was indebted for support
to a certain Lord Chancellor?” Such, indeed, are the things that
Baconians might readily say: do say, I believe.</p>
<p>Dugdale’s engraving reproduces the first words of a Latin
inscription, still on the monument:</p>
<p>Judicio Pylium, genio Socratem, arte Maronem</p>
<p>Terra tegit, populus mæret, Olympus habet:</p>
<p>“Earth covers, Olympus” (heaven? or the Muses’ Hill?) “holds him who
was a Nestor in counsel; in poetic art, a Virgil; a Socrates for his
Dæmon” (“Genius”). As for the “Genius,” or dæmon of Socrates, and the
permitted false quantity in making the first syllable of Socrates short;
and the use of Olympus for heaven in epitaphs, it is sufficient to
consult the learning of Mr. Elton. The poet who made such notable false
quantities in his plays had no cause to object to another on his
monument. We do not know who erected the monument, and paid for it, or
who wrote or adapted the epitaph; but it was somebody who thought
Shakespeare (or Bacon?) “a clayver man.” The monument (if a trembling
conjecture may be humbly put forth) was conceivably erected by the piety
of Shakespeare’s daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Hall. They
exhibit a taste for the mortuary memorial and the queer Latin
inscription. Mrs. Hall gratified the Manes of her poor mother,
Mrs. Shakespeare, with one of the oddest of Latin epitaphs. It opens
like an epigram in the Greek Anthology, and ends in an unusual strain of
Christian mysticism. Mr. Hall possesses, perhaps arranged for himself, a
few Latin elegiacs as an epitaph.</p>
<p>The famous “Good friend for Jesus’ sake forbear,” and so on, on the
stone in the chancel, beneath which the sacred dust of Shakespeare lies,
or lay, is the first of “the last lines written, we are told,” “by the
author of Hamlet.” Who tells us that Shakespeare wrote the four lines of
doggerel? Is it conceivable that the authority for Shakespeare’s
authorship of the doggerel is a tradition gleaned by Mr. Dowdall of
Queen’s in 1693, from a parish clerk, aged over eighty, he says, —
criticism makes the clerk twenty years younger. For Baconians the lines
are bad enough to be the work of William Shakspere of Stratford.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1649, when Will’s daughter, Mrs. Hall, died, her
epitaph spoke quite respectfully of her father’s intelligence.</p>
<p>“Witty above her sex, but that’s not all,</p>
<p>Wise to salvation was good Mistris Hall,</p>
<p>Something of Shakespeare was in that, but this</p>
<p>Wholly of Him with whom she’s now in bliss.”</p>
<p>Thirty-three years after Shakespeare’s death he was still thought
“witty” in Stratford. But what could Stratford know? Milton and Charles
I were of the same opinion; so was Suckling, and the rest of the
generation after Shakespeare. But they did not know, how should they,
that Bacon (or his equivalent) was the genuine author of the plays and
poems. The secret, perhaps, so widely spread among “the friends of the
Muses” in 1616, was singularly well kept by a set of men rather given to
blab as a general rule.</p>
<p>I confess to be passing weary of the Baconian hatred of Will, which
pursues him beyond his death with sneers and fantastic suspicions about
his monument and his grave, and asks if he “died with a curse upon his
lips, an imprecation against any man who might move his bones? A mean
and vulgar curse indeed!” And the authority for the circumstance that he
died with a mean and vulgar curse upon his lips?</p>
<p>About 1694, a year after Mr. Dowdall in 1693, and eighty years almost
after Shakespeare’s death, W. Hall, a Queen’s man, Oxford (the W. Hall,
perhaps, who gave the Bodleian Aldine Ovid, with Shakespeare’s
signature, true or forged, to its unknown owner), went to Stratford, and
wrote about his pilgrimage to his friend Mr. Thwaites, a Fellow of
Queen’s. Mr. Hall heard the story that Shakespeare was the author of the
mean and vulgar curse. He adds that there was a great ossuary or
bone-house in the church, where all the bones dug up were piled, “they
would load a great number of waggons.” Not desiring this promiscuity,
Shakespeare wrote the Curse in a style intelligible to clerks and
sextons, “for the most part a very ignorant sort of people.”</p>
<p>If Shakespeare did, that accommodation of himself to his audience was
the last stroke of his wisdom, or his wit. Of course there is no
evidence that he wrote the mean and vulgar curse: that he did is only
the pious hope of the Baconians and Anti-Willians.</p>
<p>Into the question of the alleged portraits of Shakespeare I cannot
enter. Ben spoke well of the engraving prefixed to the First Folio, but
Ben, as Mr. Greenwood says, was anxious to give the Folio “a good
send-off.” The engraving is choicely bad; we do not know from what
actual portrait, if from any, it was executed. Richard Burbage is known
to have amused himself with the art of design; possibly he tried his
hand on a likeness of his old friend and fellow-actor. If so, he may
have succeeded no better than Mary Stuart’s embroiderer, Oudry, in his
copy of the portrait of her Majesty.</p>
<p>That Ben Jonson was painted by Honthorst and others, while
Shakespeare, as far as we know, was not, has nothing to do with the
authorship of the plays. Ben was a scholar, the darling of both
Universities; constantly employed about the Court in arranging Masques;
his learning and his Scottish blood may have led James I to notice him.
Ben, in his later years, was much in society; fashionable and literary.
He was the father of the literary “tribe of Ben.” Thus he naturally sat
for his portrait. In the same way George Buchanan has, and had, nothing
like the fame of Knox. But as a scholar he was of European reputation;
haunted the Court as tutor of his King, and was the “good pen” of the
anti-Marian nobles, Murray, Morton, and the rest. Therefore Buchanan’s
portrait was painted, while of Knox we have only a woodcut, done,
apparently, after his death, from descriptions, for Beza’s Icones. The
Folio engraving may have no better source. Without much minute research
it is hard to find authentic portraits of Mary Stuart, and, just as in
Shakespeare’s case, the market, in her own day and in the eighteenth
century, was flooded with “mock-originals,” not even derived (in any
case known to me) from genuine and authentic contemporary works.</p>
<p>One thing is certain about the Stratford bust. Baconians will believe
that Dugdale’s man correctly represented the bust as it was in his time;
and that the actual bust is of 1748, in spite of proofs of Dugdale’s
man’s fantastic inaccuracy; in spite of the evidence of style; and in
spite of documentary evidence that “the original monument” was not to be
destroyed and replaced by the actual monument, but was merely “repaired
and beautified” (painted afresh) by a local painter.</p>
<p>X. “THE TRADITIONAL SHAKSPERE”</p>
<p>In perusing the copious arguments of the Anti-Shakesperean but
Non-Baconian Mr. Greenwood, I am often tempted, in Socratic phrase, to
address him thus: Best of men, let me implore you, first, to keep in
memory these statements on which you have most eloquently and abundantly
insisted, namely, that society in Stratford was not only not literary,
but was illiterate. Next pardon me for asking you to remember that the
late sixteenth and the early seventeenth century did not resemble our
fortunate age. Some people read Shakespeare’s, Beaumont’s, and
Fletcher’s plays. This exercise is now very rarely practised. But nobody
cared to chronicle literary gossip about the private lives and personal
traits of these and several other Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights,
in the modern manner. Of Shakespeare (pardon, I mean Shakspere), the
actor, there is one contemporary anecdote, in my poor opinion a baseless
waggery. Of Beaumont there is none. Of a hand-maid of Fletcher, who
drank sack in a tumbler, one anecdote appears at the end of the
seventeenth century, — nothing better. Meanwhile of Shakspere the
“traditions” must be sought either at Stratford or in connection with
the London Stage; and in both cases the traditions began to be in demand
very late.</p>
<p>As Stratford was not literary, indeed was terribly illiterate, any
traditions that survived cannot conceivably have been literary. That is
absolutely certain. Natives at Stratford had, by your own hypothesis,
scant interest in literary anecdote. Fifty years after Shakespeare’s
death, no native was likely to cherish tales of any sprouts of wit
(though it was remembered in 1649, that he was “witty”), or any
“wood-notes wild,” which he may have displayed or chirped at an early
age.</p>
<p>Such things were of no interest to Stratford. If he made a speech
when he killed a calf, or poached, or ran away to town, the circumstance
might descend from one gaffer to another; he might even be remembered as
“the best of his family,” — the least inefficient. Given your
non-literary and illiterate Stratford, and you can expect nothing more,
and nothing better, than we receive.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate by a modern example. In 1866 I was an undergraduate
of a year’s standing at Balliol College, Oxford, certainly not an
unlettered academy. In that year, the early and the best poems of a
considerable Balliol poet were published: he had “gone down” some eight
years before. Being young and green I eagerly sought for traditions
about Mr. Swinburne. One of his contemporaries, who took a First in the
final Classical Schools, told me that “he was a smug.” Another, that, as
Mr. Swinburne and his friend (later a Scotch professor) were not
cricketers, they proposed that they should combine to pay but a single
subscription to the Cricket Club. A third, a tutor of the highest
reputation as a moralist and metaphysician, merely smiled at my early
enthusiasm, — and told me nothing. A white-haired College servant said
that “Mr. Swinburne was a very quiet gentleman.”</p>
<p>Then you take us to dirty illiterate Stratford, from fifty to eighty
years after Shakspere’s death, — a Civil War and the Reign of the
Saints, a Restoration and a Revolution having intervened, — and ask us
to be surprised that no anecdotes of Shakspere’s early brilliance, a
century before, survived at Stratford.</p>
<p>A very humble parallel may follow. Some foolish person went seeking
early anecdotes of myself at my native town, Selkirk on the Ettrick.
From an intelligent townsman he gathered much that was true and
interesting about my younger brothers, who delighted in horses and dogs,
hunted, shot, and fished, and played cricket; one of them bowled for
Gloucestershire and Oxford. But about me the inquiring literary snipe
only heard that “Andra was aye the stupid ane o’ the fam’ly.” Yet, I,
too, had bowled for the local club, non sine gloria! Even that was
forgotten.</p>
<p>Try to remember, best of men, that literary anecdotes of a fellow
townsman’s youth do not dwell in the memories of his neighbours from
sixty to a hundred years after date. It is not in human nature that what
was incomprehensible to the grandsire should be remembered by the
grandson. Go to “Thrums” and ask for literary memories of the youth of
Mr. Barrie.</p>
<p>Yet the learned Malone seems to have been sorry that little of
Shakespeare but the calf-killing and the poaching, and the dying of a
fever after drink taken (where, I ask you?), with Ben and Drayton, was
remembered, so long after date, at Stratford, of all dirty ignorant
places. Bah! how could these people have heard of Drayton and Ben?
Remember that we are dealing with human nature, in a peculiarly
malodorous and densely ignorant bourgade, where, however, the “wit” of
Shakespeare was not forgotten (in the family) in 1649. See the epithet
on the tomb of his daughter, Mrs. Hall.</p>
<p>You give us the Rev. John Ward, vicar of Stratford (1661–3), who has
heard that the actor was “a natural wit,” and contracted and died of a
fever, after a bout with Drayton and Ben. I can scarcely believe that
these were local traditions. How could these rustauds have an opinion
about “natural wit,” how could they have known the names of Ben and
Drayton?</p>
<p>When you come to Aubrey, publishing in 1680, sixty years after
Shakespeare’s death, you neglect to trace the steps in the descent of
his tradition. As has been stated, Beeston, “the chronicle of the Stage”
(died 1682), gave him the story of the school-mastering; Beeston being
the son of a servitor of Phillips, an actor and friend of Shakespeare,
who died eleven years before that player. The story of the
school-mastering and of Shakespeare “knowing Latin pretty well,” is of
no value to me. I think that he had some knowledge of Latin, as he must
have had, if he were what I fancy him to have been, and if (which is
mere hypothesis) he went for four years to a Latin School. But the story
does not suit you, and you call it “a mere myth,” which, “of course,
will be believed by those who wish to believe it.” But, most excellent
of mortals, will it not, by parity of reasoning, “of course be
disbelieved by those who do not wish to believe it”?</p>
<p>And do you want to believe it?</p>
<p>To several stage anecdotes of the actor as an excellent instructor of
younger players, you refer slightingly. They do not weigh with me:
still, the Stage would remember Shakspere (or Shakespeare) best in stage
affairs. In reference to a very elliptic statement that, “in Hamlet
Betterton benefited by Shakespeare’s coaching,” you write, “This is
astonishing, seeing that Shakspere had been in his grave nearly twenty
years when Betterton was born. The explanation is that Taylor, of the
Black Fryars Company, was, according to Sir William Davenant, instructed
by Shakspere, and Davenant, who had seen Taylor act, according to
Downes, instructed Betterton. There is a similar story about Betterton
playing King Henry VIII. Betterton was said to have been instructed by
Sir William, who was instructed by Lowen, who was instructed by
Shakspere!”</p>
<p>Why a note of exclamation? Who was Downes, and what were his
opportunities of acquiring information? He “was for many years
book-keeper in the Duke’s Company, first under Davenant in the old house
. . . “ Davenant was notoriously the main link between “the first and
second Temple,” the theatre of Shakespeare whom, as a boy, he knew, and
the Restoration theatre. Devoted to the traditions of the stage, he
collected Shakespearean and other anecdotes; he revived the theatre,
cautiously, during the last years of Puritan rule, and told his stories
to the players of the early Restoration. As his Book-keeper with the
Duke of York’s Company, Downes heard what Davenant had to tell; he also,
for his Roscius Anglicanus, had notes from Charles Booth, prompter at
Drury Lane. On May 28, 1663, Davenant reproduced Hamlet, with young
Betterton as the Prince of Denmark. Davenant, says Charles Booth, “had
seen the part taken by Taylor, of the Black Fryars Company, and Taylor
had been instructed by the author,” (not Bacon but) “Mr. William
Shakespeare,” and Davenant “taught Mr. Betterton in every particle of
it.” Mr. Elton adds, “We cannot be sure that Taylor was taught by
Shakespeare himself. He is believed to have been a member of the King’s
Company before 1613, and to have left it for a time before Shakespeare’s
death.” His name is in the list in the Folio of “the principall Actors
in all these plays,” but I cannot pretend to be certain that he played
in them in Will’s time.</p>
<p>It is Mr. Pepys (December 30, 1668) who chronicles Davenant’s
splendid revival of Henry VIII, in which Betterton, as the King, was
instructed by Sir William Davenant, who had it from old Mr. Lowen, that
had his instruction “from Mr. Shakespear himself.” Lowin, or Lowen,
joined Shakespeare’s Company in 1604, being then a man of twenty-eight.
Burbage was the natural man for Hamlet and Henry VIII; but it is not
unusual for actors to have “understudies.”</p>
<p>The stage is notoriously tenacious of such traditions.</p>
<p>When we come with you to Mr. W. Fulman, about 1688, and the additions
to his notes made about 1690–1708, we are concerned with evidence much
too remote, and, in your own classical style, “all this is just a little
mixed.” With what Mr. Dowdall heard in 1693, and Mr. William Hall (1694)
heard from a clerk or sexton, or other illiterate dotard at Stratford, I
have already dealt. I do not habitually believe in what I hear from “the
oldest aunt telling the saddest tale,” — no, not even if she tells a
ghost story, or an anecdote about the presentation by Queen Mary of her
portrait to the ancestor of the Laird, — the portrait being dated 1768,
and representing her Majesty in the bloom of girlhood. Nor do I care for
what Rowe said (on Betterton’s information), in 1709, about
Shakespeare’s schooling; nor for what Dr. Furnivall said that Plume
wrote; nor for what anybody said that Sir John Mennes (Menzies?) said.
But I do care for what Ben Jonson and Shakespeare’s fellow-actors said;
and for what his literary contemporaries have left on record. But this
evidence you explain away by ætiological guesses, absolutely modern,
and, I conceive, to anyone familiar with historical inquiry, not more
valuable as history than other explanatory myths.</p>
<p>What Will Shakspere had to his literary credit when he died, was
men’s impressions of the seeing of his acted plays; with their
knowledge, if they had any, of fugitive, cheap, perishable, and often
bad reprints, in quartos, of about half of the plays. Men also had Venus
and Adonis, Lucrece, and the Sonnets, which sold very poorly, and I do
not wonder at it. Of the genius of Shakespeare England could form no
conception, till the publication of the Folio (1623), not in a large
edition; it struggled into a Third Edition in 1664. The engouement about
the poet, the search for personal details, did not manifest itself with
any vigour till nearly thirty years after 1664 — and we are to wonder
that the gleanings, at illiterate Stratford, and in Stage tradition, are
so scanty and so valueless. What could have been picked up, by 1680–90,
about Bacon at Gorhambury, or in the Courts of Law, I wonder.</p>
<ol start="11" type="I">
<li>THE FIRST FOLIO</li>
</ol>
<p>“The First Folio” is the name commonly given to the first collected
edition of Shakespeare’s plays. The volume includes a Preface signed by
two of the actors, Heminge and Condell, panegyrical verses by Ben Jonson
and others, and a bad engraved portrait. The book has been
microscopically examined by Baconians, hunting for cyphered messages
from their idol in italics, capital letters, misprints, and everywhere.
Their various discoveries do not win the assent of writers like the late
Lord Penzance and Mr. Greenwood.</p>
<p>The mystery as to the sources, editing, and selection of plays in the
Folio (1623) appears to be impenetrable. The title-page says that all
the contents are published “according to the true original copies.” If
only MS. copies are meant, this is untrue; in some cases the best
quartos were the chief source, supplemented by MSS. The Baconians,
following Malone, think that Ben Jonson wrote the Preface (and certainly
it looks like his work), speaking in the name of the two actors who sign
it. They say that Shakespeare’s friends “have collected and published”
the plays, have so published them “that whereas you were abus’d with
divers stolne and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by the
frauds and stealthes of injurious impostors that exposed them: even
those” (namely, the pieces previously ill-produced by pirates) “are now
offered to your view cur’d, and perfect of their limbes; and all the
rest” (that is, all the plays which had not been piratically debased),
“absolute in their numbers, as he conceived them.” So obscure is the
Preface that not all previously published separate plays are explicitly
said to be stolen and deformed, but “divers stolen copies” are
denounced. Mr. Pollard makes the same point in Shakespeare Folios and
Quartos, (1909).</p>
<p>Now, as a matter of fact, while some of the quarto editions of
separate plays are very bad texts, others are so good that the Folio
sometimes practically reprints them, with some tinkerings, from
manuscripts. Some quartos, like that of Hamlet of 1604, are excellent,
and how they came to be printed from good texts, and whether or not the
texts were given to the press by Shakespeare’s Company, or were sold, or
stolen, is the question. Mr. Pollard argues, on grounds almost certain,
that “we have strong prima facie evidence that the sale to publishers of
plays afterwards duly entered on the Stationers’ Registers was regulated
by their lawful owners.”</p>
<p>The Preface does not explicitly deny that some of the separately
printed texts were good, but says that “divers” of them were stolen and
deformed. My view of the meaning of the Preface is not generally held.
Dr. H. H. Furness, in his preface to Much Ado about Nothing (), says,
“We all know that these two friends of Shakespeare assert in their
Preface to the Folio that they had used the Author’s manuscripts, and in
the same breath denounce the Quartos as stolen and surreptitious.” I
cannot see, I repeat, that the Preface denounces all the Quartos. It
could be truly said that divers stolen and maimed copies had been
foisted on “abused” purchasers, and really no more is said. Dr. Furness
writes, “When we now find them using as ‘copy’ one of these very
Quartos” (Much Ado about Nothing, 1600), “we need not impute to them a
wilful falsehood if we suppose that in using what they knew had been
printed from the original text, howsoever obtained, they held it to be
the same as the manuscript itself . . . “ That was their meaning, I
think, the Quarto of Much Ado had not been “maimed” and “deformed,” as
divers other quartos, stolen and surreptitious, had been.</p>
<p>Shakspere, unlike most of the other playwrights, was a member of his
Company. I presume that his play was thus the common good of his Company
and himself. If they sold a copy to the press, the price would go into
their common stock; unless they, in good will, allowed the author to
pocket the money.</p>
<p>It will be observed that I understand the words of the Preface
otherwise than do the distinguished Editors of the Cambridge edition.
They write, “The natural inference to be drawn from this statement” (in
the Preface) “is that all the separate editions of Shakespeare’s plays
were ‘stolen,’ ‘surreptitious’ and imperfect, and that all those
published in the Folio were printed from the author’s own manuscripts”
(my italics). The Editors agree with Dr. Furness, not with Mr. Pollard,
whose learned opinion coincides with my own.</p>
<p>Perhaps it should be said that I reached my own construction of the
sense of this passage in the Preface by the light of nature, before
Mr. Pollard’s valuable book, based on the widest and most minute
research, came into my hands. By the results of that research he backs
his opinion (and mine), that some of the quartos are surreptitious and
bad, while others are good “and were honestly obtained.” The Preface
never denies this; never says that all the quartos contain maimed and
disfigured texts. The Preface draws a distinction to this effect, “even
those” (even the stolen and deformed copies) “are now cured and perfect
in their limbs,” — that is, have been carefully edited, while “all the
rest” are “absolute in their numbers as he conceived them.” This does
not allege that all the rest are printed from Shakespeare’s own
holograph copies.</p>
<p>Among the plays spoken of as “all the rest,” namely, those not
hitherto published and not deformed by the fraudulent, are, Tempest, Two
Gentlemen, Measure for Measure, Comedy of Errors, As You Like It, All’s
Well, Twelfth Night, Winter’s Tale, Henry VI, iii., Henry VIII,
Coriolanus, Timon, Julius Cæsar, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, and
Cymbeline. Also Henry VI, i., ii., King John, and Taming of the Shrew,
appeared now in other form than in the hitherto published Quartos
bearing these or closely similar names. We have, moreover, no previous
information as to The Shrew, Timon, Julius Cæsar, All’s Well, and Henry
VIII. The Preface adds the remarkable statement that, whatever
Shakespeare thought, “he uttered with that easinesse, that wee have
scarce received from him a blot in his papers.”</p>
<p>It is plain that the many dramas previously unpublished could only be
recovered from manuscripts of one sort or another, because they existed
in no other form. The Preface takes it for granted that the selected
manuscripts contain the plays “absolute in their numbers as he conceived
them.” But the Preface does not commit itself, I repeat, to the
statement that all of these many plays are printed from Shakespeare’s
own handwriting. After “as he conceived them,” it goes on, “Who, as he
was a most happy imitator of nature, was a most gentle expresser of it.
His mind and hand went together: and what he thought he uttered with
that easiness, that we have scarce received from him a blot in his
papers.”</p>
<p>This may be meant to suggest, but does not affirm, that the actors
have “all the rest” of the plays in Shakespeare’s own handwriting. They
may have, or may have had, some of his manuscripts, and believed that
other manuscripts accessible to them, and used by them, contain his very
words. Whether from cunning or design, or from the Elizabethan inability
to tell a plain tale plainly, the authors or author of the Preface have
everywhere left themselves loopholes and ways of evasion and escape. It
is not possible to pin them down to any plain statement of facts
concerning the sources for the hitherto unpublished plays, “the rest” of
the plays.</p>
<p>These, at least, were from manuscript sources which the actors
thought accurate, and some may have been “fair copies” in Shakespeare’s
own hand. (Scott, as regards his novels, sent his prima cura, his first
writing down, to the press, and his pages are nearly free from blot or
erasion. In one case at least, Shelley’s first draft of a poem is
described as like a marsh of reeds in water, with wild ducks, but he
made very elegant fair copies for the press.) Let it be supposed that
Ben Jonson wrote all this Preface, in accordance with the wishes and
instructions of the two actors who sign it. He took their word for the
almost blotless MSS. which they received from Shakespeare. He remarks,
in his posthumously published Discoveries (notes, memories, brief
essays), “I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honour to
Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never blotted
out a line.” And Ben gives, we shall later see, his habitual reply to
this habitual boast.</p>
<p>As to the sources of such plays as had been “maimed and deformed by
injurious impostors,” and are now “offered cur’d and perfect of their
limbs,” “it can be proved to demonstration,” say the Cambridge Editors,
“that several plays in the Folio were printed from earlier quarto
editions” (but the players secured a retreat on this point), “and that
in other cases the quarto is more correctly printed, or from a better
manuscript than the Folio text, and therefore of higher authority.”
Hamlet, in the Folio of 1623, when it differs from the quarto of 1604,
“differs for the worse in forty-seven places, while it differs for the
better in twenty places.”</p>
<p>Can the wit of man suggest any other explanation than that the
editing of the Folio was carelessly done; out of the best quartos and
MSS. in the theatre for acting purposes, and, — if the players did not
lie in what they “often said,” and if they kept the originals, — out of
some MSS. received from Shakspere? Whether the two players themselves
threw into the press, after some hasty botchings, whatever materials
they had, or whether they employed an Editor, a very wretched Editor, or
Editors, or whether the great Author, Bacon, himself was his own Editor,
the preparation of a text was infamously done. The two actors, probably,
I think, never read through the proof-sheets, and took the word of the
man whom they employed to edit their materials, for gospel. The editing
of the Folio is so exquisitely careless that twelve printer’s errors in
a quarto of 1622, of Richard III, appear in the Folio of 1623. Again,
the Merry Wives of the Folio, is nearly twice as long as the quarto of
1619, yet keeps old errors.</p>
<p>How can we explain the reckless retention of errors, and also the
large additions and improvements? Did the true author (Bacon or Bungay)
now edit his work, add much matter, and go wrong forty-seven times where
the quarto was right, and go right twenty times when the quarto was
wrong? Did he, for the Folio of 1623, nearly double The Merry Wives in
extent, and also leave all the errors of the fourth quarto
uncorrected?</p>
<p>In that case how negligent was Bacon of his immortal works! Now Bacon
was a scholar, and this absurd conduct cannot be imputed, I hope, to
him.</p>
<p>Mr. Pollard is much more lenient than his fellow-scholars towards the
Editor or Editors of the Folio. He concludes that “manuscript copies of
the plays were easily procurable.” Sixteen out of the thirty-six plays
existed in quartos. Eight of the sixteen were not used for the Folio;
five were used, “with additions, corrections, or alterations” (which
must have been made from manuscripts). Three quartos only were reprinted
as they stood. The Editors greatly preferred to use manuscript copies;
and showed this, Mr. Pollard thinks, by placing plays, never before
printed, in the most salient parts of the three sets of dramas in their
book. They did make an attempt to divide their plays into Acts and
Scenes, whereas the quartos, as a general rule, had been undivided. But
the Editors, I must say, had not the energy to carry out their good
intentions fully — or Bacon or Bungay, if the author, wearied in
well-doing. The work is least ill done in the Comedies, and grows worse
and worse as the Editor, or Bacon, or Bungay becomes intolerably
slack.</p>
<p>A great living author, who had a decent regard for his own works,
could never have made or passed this slovenly Folio. Yet Mr. Greenwood
argues that probably Bungay was still alive and active, after Shakspere
was dead and buried. (Mr. Greenwood, of course, does not speak of
Bungay, which I use as short for his Great Unknown.) Thus, Richard III
from 1597 to 1622 appeared in six quartos. It is immensely improved in
the Folio, and so are several other plays. Who made the improvements,
which the Editors could only obtain in manuscripts? If we say that
Shakespeare made them in MS., Mr. Greenwood asks, “What had he to work
upon, since, after selling his plays to his company, he did not preserve
his manuscript?” Now I do not know that he did sell his plays to his
company. We are sure that Will got money for them, but we do not know
what arrangement he made with his company. He may have had an author’s
rights in addition to a sum down, as later was customary, and he had his
regular share in the profits. Nor am I possessed of information that “he
did not preserve his manuscript.” How can we know that? He may have kept
his first draft, he may have made a fair copy for himself, as well as
for the players, or may have had one made. He may have worked on a copy
possessed by the players; and the publisher of the quartos of 1605,
1612, 1622, may not have been allowed to use, or may not have asked for
the latest manuscript revised copy. The Richard III of the Folio
contains, with much new matter, the printer’s errors of the quarto of
1622. I would account for this by supposing that the casual Editor had
just sense enough to add the new parts in a revised manuscript to the
quarto, and was far too lazy to correct the printer’s errors in the
quarto. But Mr. Greenwood asks whether “the natural conclusion is not
that ‘some person unknown’ took the Quarto of 1622, revised it, added
the new passages, and thus put it into the form in which it appeared in
1623.” This natural conclusion means that the author, Bungay, was alive
in 1622, and put his additions and improvements of recent date into the
quarto of 1622, but never took the trouble to correct the errors in the
quarto. And so on in other plays similarly treated. “Is it not a more
natural conclusion that ‘Shakespeare’” (Bungay) “himself revised its
publication, and that some part of this revision, at any rate, was done
after 1616 and before 1623.”</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, after criticising other systems, writes, “There is, of
course, another hypothesis. It is that Shakespeare” (meaning the real
author) “did not die in 1616,” and here follows the usual notion that
“Shakespeare” was the “nom de plume” of that transcendent genius,
“moving in Court circles among the highest of his day (as assuredly
Shakespeare must have moved) — who wished to conceal his identity.”</p>
<p>I have not the shadow of assurance that the Author “moved in Court
circles,” though Will would see a good deal when he played at Court, and
in the houses of nobles, before “Eliza and our James.” I never moved in
Court circles: Mr. Greenwood must know them better than I do, and I have
explained (see Love’s Labour’s Lost, and Shakespeare, Genius, and
Society) how Will picked up his notions of courtly ways.</p>
<p>“Another hypothesis,” the Baconian hypothesis,— “nom de plume” and
all, — Mr. Greenwood thinks “an extremely reasonable one”: I cannot
easily conceive of one more unreasonable.</p>
<p>“Supposing that there was such an author as I have suggested, he may
well have conceived the idea of publishing a collected edition of the
plays which had been written under the name of Shakespeare, and being
himself busy with other matters, he may have entrusted the business to
some ‘literary man,’ to some ‘good pen,’ who was at the time doing work
for him; and why not to the man who wrote the commendatory verses, the
‘Lines to the Reader’” (opposite to the engraving), “and, as seems
certain, the Preface, ‘to the great variety of Readers’?”</p>
<p>That man, that “good pen,” was Ben Jonson. On the “supposing” of
Mr. Greenwood, Ben is “doing work for” the Great Unknown at the time
when “the business” following on the “idea of publishing a collected
edition of the plays which had been written under the name of
Shakespeare” occurred to the illustrious but unknown owner of that “nom
de plume.” In plain words of my own, — the Author may have entrusted
“the business,” and what was that business if not the editing of the
Folio? — to Ben Jonson— “who was at the time doing work for him” — for
the Author.</p>
<p>Here is a clue! We only need to know for what man of “transcendent
genius, universal culture, world-wide philosophy . . . moving in Court
circles,” and so on, Ben “was working” about 1621–3, the Folio appearing
in 1623.</p>
<p>The heart beats with anticipation of a discovery! “On January 22,
1621, Bacon celebrated his sixtieth birthday with great state at York
House. Jonson was present,” and wrote an ode, with something about the
Genius of the House (Lar or Brownie),</p>
<p>“Thou stand’st as if some mystery thou didst.”</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood does not know what this can mean; nor do I.</p>
<p>“Jonson, it appears” (on what authority?), “was Bacon’s guest at
Gorhambury, and was one of those good ‘pens,’” of whom Bacon speaks as
assisting him in the translation of some of his books into Latin.</p>
<p>Bacon, writing to Toby Mathew, June 26, 1623, mentions the help of
“some good pens,” Ben Jonson he does not mention. But Judge Webb does.
“It is an undoubted fact,” says Judge Webb, “that the Latin of the De
Augmentis, which was published in 1623, was the work of Jonson.” To whom
Mr. Collins replies, “There is not a particle of evidence that Jonson
gave to Bacon the smallest assistance in translating any of his works
into Latin.”</p>
<p>Très bien, on Judge Webb’s assurance the person for whom Ben was
working, in 1623, was Bacon. Meanwhile, Mr. Greenwood’s “supposing” is
“that there was such an author” (of transcendent genius, and so on), who
“may have entrusted the editing of his collected plays” to some “good
pen,” who was at the time “doing work for him,” and “why not to” — Ben
Jonson. Now the man for whom Ben, in 1623, was “doing work” — was Bacon,
— so Judge Webb says.</p>
<p>Therefore, by this hypothesis of Mr. Greenwood, the Great Unknown was
Bacon, — just the hypothesis of the common Baconian.</p>
<p>Is my reasoning erroneous? Is the “supposing” suggested by
Mr. Greenwood any other than that of Miss Delia Bacon, and Judge Webb?
True, Mr. Greenwood’s Baconian “supposing” is only a working hypothesis:
not a confirmed belief. But it is useful to his argument (see “Ben
Jonson and Shakespeare”) when he wants to explain away Ben’s evidence,
in his verses in the Folio, to the Stratford actor as the Author.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood writes, in the first page of his Preface: “It is no
part of my plan or intention to defend that theory,” “the Baconian
theory.” Apparently it pops out contrary to the intention of
Mr. Greenwood. But pop out it does: at least I can find no flaw in the
reasoning of my detection of Bacon: I see no way out of it except this:
after recapitulating what is said about Ben as one of Bacon’s “good
pens” with other details, Mr. Greenwood says, “But no doubt that way
madness lies!” Ah no! not madness, no, but Baconism “lies that way.”
However, “let it be granted” (as Euclid says in his sportsmanlike way)
that Mr. Greenwood by no means thinks that his “concealed poet” is Bacon
— only some one similar and similarly situated and still active in 1623,
and occupied with other business than supervising a collected edition of
plays written under his “nom de plume” of Shakespeare. Bacon, too, was
busy, with supervising, or toiling at the Latin translation of his
scientific works, and Ben (according to Judge Webb) was busy in turning
the Advancement of Learning into Latin prose. Mr. Greenwood quotes,
without reference, Archbishop Tenison as saying that Ben helped Bacon in
doing his works into Latin. Tenison is a very late witness. The
prophetic soul of Bacon did not quite trust English to last as long as
Latin, or he thought Latin, the lingua franca of Europe in his day, more
easily accessible to foreign students, as, of course, it was. Thus Bacon
was very busy; so was Ben. The sad consequence of Ben’s business,
perhaps, is that the editing of the Folio is notoriously bad; whether
Ben were the Editor or not, it is infamously bad.</p>
<p>Conceivably Mr. Greenwood is of the same opinion. He says, “It stands
admitted that a very large part of that volume” (the Folio) “consists of
work that is not ‘Shakespeare’s’ at all.”</p>
<p>How strange, if Ben edited it for the Great Unknown — who knew, if
any human being knew, what work was “Shakespeare’s”! On Mr. Greenwood’s
hypothesis, or “supposing,” the Unknown Author “may well have conceived
the idea of publishing a collected edition of the plays which had been
written” (not “published,” written) “under the name of Shakespeare, and,
being himself busy with other matters, he may have entrusted the
business to” some “good pen,” “and why not to” — Ben. Nevertheless “a
very large part of that volume consists of work that is not
‘Shakespeare’s’ at all.” How did this occur? The book is “that very
doubtful ‘canon.’” How, if “Shakespeare’s” man edited it for
“Shakespeare”? Did “Shakespeare” not care what stuff was placed under
his immortal “nom de plume”?</p>
<p>It is not my fault if I think that Mr. Greenwood’s hypotheses — the
genuine “Shakespeare” either revised his own works, or put Ben on the
editorial task — are absolutely contradicted by his statements in
another part of his book. For the genuine “Shakespeare” knew what plays
he had written, knew what he could honestly put forth as his own, as
“Shakespeare’s.” Or, if he placed the task of editing in Ben’s hands, he
must have told Ben what plays were of his own making. In either case the
Folio would contain these, and no others. But— “the plat contraire,” —
the very reverse, — is stated by Mr. Greenwood. “It stands admitted that
a very large portion of that volume” (the Folio) “consists of work that
is not ‘Shakespeare’s’” (is not Bacon’s, or the other man’s) “at all.”
Then away fly the hypotheses that the auto-Shakespeare, or that Ben,
employed by the auto-Shakespeare (apparently Bacon) revised, edited, and
prepared for publication the auto-Shakespearean plays. For Mr. Greenwood
“has already dealt with Titus (Andronicus) and Henry VI,” and proved
them not to be auto-Shakespearean — and he adds “there are many other
plays in that very doubtful ‘canon’” (the Folio) “which, by universal
admission, contain much non-Shakespearean composition.” Perhaps! but if
so the two hypotheses, that either the genuine Shakespeare revised (“is
it not a more natural solution that ‘Shakespeare’ himself revised his
works for publication, and that some part, at any rate, of this revision
was done after 1616 and before 1623?”), or that he gave Ben (who was
working, by the conjecture, for Bacon) the task of editing the Folio, —
are annihilated. For neither the auto-Shakespeare (if honest), nor Ben
(if sober), could have stuffed the Folio full of non-Shakespearean work,
— including four “non-Shakespearean” plays, — nor could the Folio be
“that very doubtful canon.” Again, if either the auto-Shakespeare or Ben
following his instructions, were Editor, neither could have, as the
Folio Editor had “evidently no little doubt about” Troilus and
Cressida.</p>
<p>Neither Ben, nor the actual Simon Pure, the author, the
auto-Shakespeare, could fail to know the truth about Trodus and
Cressida. But the Editor did not know the truth, the whole canon is
“doubtful.” Therefore the hypothesis, the “supposing,” that the actual
author did the revising, and the other hypothesis that he gave Ben the
work, seem to me wholly impossible. But Mr. Greenwood needs the
“supposings” of p, 293; and as he rejects Titus Andronicus and Henry VI
(both in the Folio), he also needs the contradictory views of p, 358. On
which set of supposings and averments does he stand to win?</p>
<p>Perhaps he thinks to find a way out of what appears to me to be a
dilemma in the following fashion: He will not accept Titus Andronicus
and Henry VI, though both are in the Folio, as the work of his
“Shakespeare,” his Unknown, the Bacon of the Baconians. Well, we ask, if
your Unknown, or Bacon, or Ben, — instructed by Bacon, or by the
Unknown, — edited the Folio, how could any one of the three insert
Titus, and Henry VI, and be “in no little doubt about” Troilus and
Cressida? Bacon, or the Unknown, or the Editor employed by either, knew
perfectly well which plays either man could honestly claim as his own
work, done under the “nom de plume” of “William Shakespeare” (with or
without the hyphen). Yet the Editor of the Folio does not know — and
Mr. Greenwood does know — Henry VI and Titus are “wrong ones.”</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood’s way out, if I follow him, is this: “Judge Stotsenburg
asks, ‘Who wrote The Taming of a Shrew printed in 1594, and who wrote
Titus Andronicus, Henry VI, or King Lear referred to in the Diary?’”
(Henslowe’s). The Judge continues: “Neither Collier nor any of the
Shaxper commentators make (sic) any claim to their authorship in behalf
of William Shaxper. Since these plays have the same names as those
included in the Folio of 1623 the presumption is that they are the same
plays until the contrary is shown. Of course it may be shown, either
that those in the Folio are entirely different except in name, or that
these plays were revised, improved, and dressed by some one whom they”
(who?) “called Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood says, “My own conviction is that . . . these plays were
‘revised, improved, and dressed by some one whom they called
Shakespeare.’” (Whom who called Shakespeare?) In that case these plays,
— say Titus Andronicus and Henry VI, Part 1, — which Mr. Greenwood
denies to his “Shakespeare” were just as much his Shakespeare’s plays as
any other plays (and there are several), which his Shakespeare “revised,
improved, and dressed.” Yet his Shakespeare is not author of Henry VI,
not the author of Titus Andronicus. “Mr. Anders,” writes Mr. Greenwood,
“makes what I think to be a great error in citing Henry VI and Titus as
genuine plays of Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>He hammers at this denial in nineteen references in his Index to
Titus Andronicus. Yet Ben, or Bacon, or the Unknown thought that these
plays were “genuine plays” of “Shakespeare,” the concealed author —
Bacon or Mr. Greenwood’s man. It appears that the immense poet who used
the “nom de plume” of “Shakespeare” did not know the plays of which he
could rightfully call himself the author; that (not foreseeing
Mr. Greenwood’s constantly repeated objections) he boldly annexed four
plays, or two certainly, which Mr. Greenwood denies to him, and another
about which “the Folio Editor was in no little doubt.”</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Greenwood is “convinced,” “it is my conviction” that
some plays which he often denies to his “Shakespeare” were “revised,
improved, and dressed by some one whom they called Shakespeare.” That
some one, if he edited or caused to be edited the Folio, thought that
his revision, improvement, and dressing up of the plays gave him a right
to claim their authorship — and Mr. Greenwood, a dozen times and more,
denies to him their authorship.</p>
<p>One is seriously puzzled to discover the critic’s meaning. The Taming
of a Shrew, Titus, Henry VI, and King Lear, referred to in Henslowe’s
“Diary,” are not “Shakespearean,” we are repeatedly told. But “my own
conviction is that . . . “ these plays were “revised, improved, and
dressed by some one whom they called Shakespeare.” But to be revised,
improved, and dressed by some one whom they called Shakespeare, is to be
as truly “Shakespearean” work as is any play so handled “by
Shakespeare.” Thus the plays mentioned are as truly “Shakespearean” as
any others in which “Shakespeare” worked on an earlier canvas, and also
Titus “is not Shakespearean at all.” Mr. Greenwood, I repeat, constantly
denies the “Shakespearean” character to Titus and Henry VI. “The
conclusion of the whole matter is that Titus and The Trilogy of Henry VI
are not the work of Shakespeare: that his hand is probably not to be
found at all in Titus, and only once or twice, if at all, in Henry VI,
Part I, but that he it probably was who altered and remodelled the two
parts of the old Contention of the Houses of York and Lancaster, thereby
producing Henry VI, Parts II and III.”</p>
<p>Yet Titus and Henry VI appear as “revised, improved, and dressed” by
the mysterious “some one whom they called Shakespeare.” If
Mr. Greenwood’s conclusion be correct, “Shakespeare” had no right to
place Henry VI, Part I, and Titus in his Folio. If his “conviction” be
correct, Shakespeare had as good a right to them as to any of the plays
which he revised, and improved, and dressed. They must be
“Shakespearean” if Mr. Greenwood is right in his suggestion that
“Shakespeare” either revised his works for publication between 1616 and
1623, or set his man, Ben Jonson, upon that business. Yet neither one
nor the other knew what to make of Troilus and Cressida. “The Folio
Editor had, evidently, no little doubt about that play.”</p>
<p>So neither “Shakespeare” nor Ben, instructed by him, can have been
“the Folio Editor.” Consequently Mr. Greenwood must abandon his
suggestion that either man was the Editor, and may return to his
rejection of Titus and Henry VI, Part I. But he clings to it. He finds
in Henslowe’s Diary “references to, and records of the writing of, such
plays” as, among others, Titus Andronicus, and Henry VI.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, after rejecting a theory of some one, says, “Far more
likely does it appear that there was a great man of the time whose
genius was capable of ‘transforming dross into gold,’ who took these
plays, and, in great part, rewrote and revised them, leaving sometimes
more, and sometimes less of the original work; and that so rewritten,
revised, and transformed they appeared as the plays of
‘Shake-speare.’”</p>
<p>This statement is made about “these plays,” including Titus
Andronicus and Henry VI, while “Titus and the Trilogy of Henry VI are
not the work of Shakespeare . . . his hand is probably not to be found
at all in Titus, and only once or twice in Henry VI, Part I,” though he
probably made Parts II and III out of older plays.</p>
<p>I do not know where to have the critic. If Henry VI, Part I, and
Titus are in no sense by “Shakespeare,” then neither “Shakespeare” nor
Ben for him edited or had anything to do with the editing of the Folio.
If either or both had to do with the editing, as the critic suggests,
then he is wrong in denying Shakespearean origin to Titus and Henry VI,
Part I.</p>
<p>Of course one sees a way out of the dilemma for the great
auto-Shakespeare himself, who, by one hypothesis, handed over the
editing of his plays to Ben (he, by Mr. Greenwood’s “supposing,” was
deviling at literary jobs for Bacon). The auto-Shakespeare merely tells
Ben to edit his plays, and never even gives him a list of them. Then Ben
brings him the Folio, and the author looks at the list of Plays.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jonson,” he says, “I have hitherto held thee for an honest
scholar and a deserving man in the quality thou dost profess. But thou
hast brought me a maimed and deformed printed copy of that which I did
write for my own recreation, not wishful to be known for so light a
thing as a poet. Moreover, thou hast placed among these my trifles, four
plays to which I never put a finger, and others in which I had no more
than a thumb. The Seneschal, Mr. Jonson, will pay thee what is due to
thee; thy fardels shall be sent whithersoever thou wilt, and, Mary!
Mr. Jonson, I bid thee never more be officer of mine.”</p>
<p>This painful discourse must have been held at Gorhambury, — if Ben
edited the Folio — for Francis.</p>
<p>It is manifest, I hope, that about the Folio Mr. Greenwood speaks
with two voices, and these very discordant. It is also manifest that,
whoever wrote the plays left his materials in deep neglect, and that,
when they were collected, some one gathered them up in extreme disorder.
It is extraordinary that the Baconians and Mr. Greenwood do not see the
fallacy of their own reasoning in this matter of the Folio. They
constantly ridicule the old view that the actor, Will Shakspere (if, by
miracle, he were the author of the plays), could have left them to take
their fortunes. They are asked, what did other playwrights do in that
age? They often parted with their whole copyright to the actors of this
or that company, or to Henslowe. The new owners could alter the plays at
will, and were notoriously anxious to keep them out of print, lest other
companies should act them. As Mr. Greenwood writes, “Such, we are told,
was the universal custom with dramatists of the day; they ‘kept no
copies’ of their plays, and thought no more about them. It will, I
suppose, be set down to fanaticism that I should doubt the truth of this
proposition, that I doubt if it be consonant with the known facts of
human nature.” But whom, except Jonson, does Mr. Greenwood find editing
and publishing his plays? Beaumont, Fletcher, Heywood? No!</p>
<p>If the Great Unknown were dead in 1623, his negligence was as bad as
Will’s. If he were alive and revised his own work for publication, he
did it as the office cat might have done it in hours of play. If, on the
other side, he handed the editorial task over to Ben, then he did not
even give Ben a list of his genuine works. Mr. Greenwood cites the case
of Ben Jonson, a notorious and, I think, solitary exception. Ben was and
often proclaimed himself to be essentially a scholar. He took as much
pains in prefacing, editing, and annotating his plays, as he would have
taken had the texts been those of Greek tragedians.</p>
<p>Finally, all Baconians cry out against the sottish behaviour of the
actor, Will, if being really the author of the plays, he did not bestir
himself, and bring them out in a collected edition. Yet no English
dramatist ventured on doing such a thing, till Ben thus collected his
“works” (and was laughed at) in 1616. The example might have encouraged
Will to be up and doing, but he died early in 1616. If Will were not the
author, what care was Bacon, or the Unknown, taking of his many
manuscript plays, and for the proper editing of those which had appeared
separately in pamphlets? As indolent and casual as Will, the great
Author, Bacon or another, left the plays to take their chances.
Mr. Greenwood says that “if the author” (Bacon or somebody very like
him) “had been careless about keeping copies of his manuscripts . . . “
What an “if” in the case of the great Author! This gross neglect,
infamous in Will, may thus have been practised by the Great Unknown
himself.</p>
<p>In 1911 Mr. Greenwood writes, “There is overwhelming authority for
the view that Titus Andronicus is not Shakespearean at all.” In that
case, neither Bacon, nor the Unknown, nor Ben, acting for either, can
have been the person who put Titus into the Folio.</p>
<ol start="12" type="I">
<li>BEN JONSON AND SHAKESPEARE</li>
</ol>
<p>The evidence of Ben Jonson to the identity of Shakespeare the author
with Shakspere the actor, is “the strength of the Stratfordian faith,”
says Mr. Greenwood. “But I think it will be admitted that the various
Jonsonian utterances with regard to ‘Shakespeare’ are by no means easy
to reconcile one with the other.”</p>
<p>It is difficult to reply briefly to Mr. Greenwood’s forty-seven pages
about the evidence of Jonson. But, first, whenever in written words or
in reported conversation, Ben speaks of Shakespeare by name, he speaks
of his works: in 1619 to Drummond of Hawthornden; in 1623 in
commendatory verses to the Folio; while, about 1630, probably, in his
posthumously published Discourses, he writes on Shakespeare as the
friend and “fellow” of the players, on Shakespeare as his own friend,
and as a dramatist. On each of these three occasions, Ben’s tone varies.
In 1619 he said no more to Drummond of Hawthornden (apparently on two
separate occasions) than that Shakespeare “lacked art,” and made the
mistake about a wreck on the sea-coast of Bohemia.</p>
<p>In 1619, Ben spoke gruffly and briefly of Shakespeare, as to Drummond
he also spoke disparagingly of Beaumont, whom he had panegyrised in an
epigram in his own folio of 1616, and was again to praise in the
commendatory verses in the Folio. He spoke still more harshly of
Drayton, whom in 1616 he had compared to Homer, Virgil, Theocritus, and
Tyræus! He told an unkind anecdote of Marston, with whom he had first
quarrelled and then made friends, collaborating with him in a play; and
very generously and to his great peril, sharing his imprisonment. To
Drummond, Jonson merely said that he “beat Marston and took away his
pistol.” Of Sir John Beaumont, brother of the dramatist, Ben had written
a most hyperbolical eulogy in verse; luckily for Sir John, to Drummond
Ben did not speak of him. Such was Ben, in panegyric verse hyperbolical;
in conversation “a despiser of others, and praiser of himself.” Compare
Ben’s three remarks about Donne, all made to Drummond. Donne deserved
hanging for breaking metre; Donne would perish for not being understood:
and Donne was in some points the first of living poets.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood’s effort to disable Jonson’s evidence rests on the
contradictions in his estimates of Shakespeare’s poetry, in notices
scattered through some thirty years. Jonson, it is argued, cannot on
each occasion mean Will. He must now mean Will, now the Great Unknown,
and now — both at once. Yet I have proved that Ben was the least
consistent of critics, all depended on the occasion, and on his humour
at the moment. This is a commonplace of literary history. The Baconians
do not know it; Mr. Greenwood, if he knows it, ignores it, and bases his
argument on facts which may be unknown to his readers. We have noted
Ben’s words of 1619, and touched on his panegyric of 1623. Thirdly,
about 1630 probably, Ben wrote in his manuscript book Discourses an
affectionate but critical page on Shakespeare as a man and an author.
Always, in prose, and in verse, and in recorded conversation, Ben
explicitly identified Shakspere (William, of Stratford) with the author
of the plays usually ascribed to him. But the Baconian Judge Webb (in
extreme old age), and the anti-Shakespearean Mr. Greenwood and others,
choose to interpret Ben’s words on the theory that, in 1623, he “had his
tongue in his cheek”; that, like Odysseus, he “mingled things false with
true,” that they know what is true from what is false, and can undo the
many knots which Ben tied in his tongue. How they succeed we shall
see.</p>
<p>In addition to his three known mentions of Shakespeare by name (1619,
1623, 1630?), Ben certainly appears to satirise his rival at a much
earlier date; especially as Pantalabus, a playwright in The Poetaster
(1601), and as actor, poet, and plagiarist in an epigram, Poet-Ape,
published in his collected works of 1616; but probably written as early
as 1602. It is well known that in 1598 Shakespeare’s company acted Ben’s
Every Man in His Humour. It appears that he conceived some grudge
against the actors, and apparently against Shakespeare and other
playwrights, for, in 1601, his Poetaster is a satire both on playwrights
and on actors, whom he calls “apes.” The apparent attacks on Shakespeare
are just such as Ben, if angry and envious, would direct against him;
while we know of no other poet-player of the period to whom they could
apply. For example, in The Poetaster, Histrio, the actor, is advised to
ingratiate himself with Pantalabus, “gent’man parcel-poet, his father
was a man of worship, I tell thee.” This is perhaps unmistakably a blow
at Shakespeare, who had recently acquired for his father and himself
arms, and the pleasure of writing himself “gentleman.” This “parcel-poet
gent’man” “pens lofty, in a new stalking style,” — he is thus an author,
he “pens,” and in a high style. He is called Pantalabus, from the Greek
words for “to take up all,” which means that, as poet, he is a
plagiarist. Jonson repeats this charge in his verses called Poet-Ape
—</p>
<p>“He takes up all, makes each man’s wit his own,</p>
<p>And told of this, he slights it.”</p>
<p>In a scene added to The Poetaster in 1616, the author (Ben) is
advised not</p>
<p>“With a sad and serious verse to wound</p>
<p>Pantalabus, railing in his saucy jests,”</p>
<p>and obviously slighting the charges of plagiarism. Perhaps Ben is
glancing at Shakespeare, who, if accused of plagiary by an angry rival,
would merely laugh.</p>
<p>A reply to the Poetaster, namely Satiromastix (by Dekker and
Marston?), introduces Jonson himself as babbling darkly about
“Mr. Justice Shallow,” and “an Innocent Moor” (Othello?). Here is
question of “administering strong pills” to Jonson; then,</p>
<p>“What lumps of hard and indigested stuff,</p>
<p>Of bitter Satirism, of Arrogance,</p>
<p>Of Self-love, of Detraction, of a black</p>
<p>And stinking Insolence should we fetch up!”</p>
<p>This “pill” is a reply to Ben’s “purge” for the poets in his
Poetaster. Oh, the sad old stuff!</p>
<p>Referring to Jonson’s Poetaster, and to Satiromastix, the
counter-attack, we find a passage in the Cambridge play, The Return from
Parnassus (about 1602). Burbage, the tragic actor, and Kempe, the
low-comedy man of Shakespeare’s company, are introduced, discussing the
possible merits of Cambridge wits as playwrights. Kempe rejects them as
they “smell too much of that writer Ovid, and that writer Metamorphosis
. . . “ The purpose, of course, is to laugh at the ignorance of the
low-comedy man, who thinks “Metamorphosis” a writer, and does not
suspect — how should he? — that Shakespeare “smells of Ovid.” Kempe
innocently goes on, “Why, here’s our fellow” (comrade) “Shakespeare puts
them all down” (all the University playwrights), “aye, and Ben Jonson
too. O that Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow, he brought up Horace” (in
The Poetaster) “giving the poets a pill, but our fellow Shakespeare hath
given him a purge . . .”</p>
<p>The Cambridge author, perhaps, is thinking of the pill (not purge)
which, in Satiromastix, might be administered to Jonson. The Cambridge
author may have thought that Shakespeare wrote the passage on the pill
which was to “fetch up” masses of Ben’s insolence, self-love, arrogance,
and detraction. If this be not the sequence of ideas, it is not easy to
understand how or why Kempe is made to say that Shakespeare has given
Jonson a purge. Stupid old nonsense! There are other more or less
obscure indications of Jonson’s spite, during the stage-quarrel, against
Shakespeare, but the most unmistakable proof lies in his verses in
“Poet-Ape.” I am aware that Ben’s intention here to hit at Shakespeare
has been denied, for example by Mr. Collins with his usual vigour of
language. But though I would fain agree with him, the object of attack
can be no known person save Will. Jonson was already, in The Poetaster,
using the term “Poet-Ape,” for he calls the actors at large “apes.”</p>
<p>Jonson thought so well of his rhymes that he included them in the
Epigrams of his first Folio (1616). By that date, the year of
Shakespeare’s death, if he really loved Shakespeare, as he says, in
verse and prose, Ben might have suppressed the verses. But (as Drummond
noted) he preferred his jest, such as it was, to his friend; who was
not, as usually understood, a man apt to resent a very blunt shaft of
very obsolete wit. Like Molière, Shakespeare had outlived the charge of
plagiarism, made long ago by the jealous Ben.</p>
<p>Poet-Ape is an actor-playwright “that would be thought our chief” —
words which, by 1601, could only apply to Shakespeare; there was no
rival, save Ben, near his throne. The playwright-actor, too, has now
confessedly</p>
<p>“grown</p>
<p>To a little wealth and credit in the scene,”</p>
<p>of no other actor-playwright could this be said.</p>
<p>He is the author of “works” (Jonson was laughed at for calling his
own plays “works”), but these works are “the frippery of wit,” that is,
a tissue of plagiarisms, as in the case of Pantalabus. But “told of this
he slights it,” as most successful authors, when accused, as they often
are, of plagiarism by jealous rivals, wisely do; — so did Molière. This
Poet-Ape began his career by “picking and gleaning” and “buying
reversions of old plays.” This means that Shakespeare did work over
earlier plays which his company had acquired; or, if Shakespeare did
not, — then, I presume, — Bacon did!</p>
<p>That, with much bad humour, is the gist of the rhymes on Poet-Ape.
Ben thinks Shakespeare’s “works” very larcenous, but still, the “works,”
as such, are those of the poet-actor. I hope it is now clear that
Poet-Ape, who, like Pantalabus, “takes up all”; who has “grown to a
little wealth and credit in the scene,” and who “thinks himself the
chief” of contemporary dramatists, can be nobody but Shakespeare. Hence
it follows that the “works” of Poet-Ape, are the works of Shakespeare.
Ben admits, nay, asserts the existence of the works, says that they may
reach “the after-time,” but he calls them a mass of plagiarisms, —
because he is in a jealous rage.</p>
<p>But this view does not at all suit Mr. Greenwood, for it shows Ben
regarding Shakespeare as the “Ape,” or Actor, and also as the “Poet” and
author of the “works.” Yet Ben’s words mean nothing if not that an actor
is the author of works which Ben accuses of plagiarism. Mr. Greenwood
thinks that the epigram proves merely that “Jonson looked upon Shakspere
(if, indeed, he refers to him) as one who put forward the writings of
others as his own, or, in plain English, an impostor.” “The work which
goes in his name is, in truth, the work of somebody else.” Mr. Greenwood
put the same interpretation on Greene’s words about “Shakescene,” and we
showed that the interpretation was impossible. “The utmost we should be
entitled to say” (if Shake-scene be meant for Shakspere) “is that Greene
accuses Player Shakspere of putting forward, as his own, some work or
perhaps some parts of a work, for which he was really indebted to
another.” We proved, by quoting Greene’s words, that he said nothing
which could be tortured into this sense. In the same way Ben’s words
cannot be tortured into the sense that “the work which goes in his”
(Poet-Ape’s) “name is, in truth, the work of somebody else.”
Mr. Greenwood tries to find the Anti-Willian hypothesis in Greene’s
Groatsworth of Wit and in Ben’s epigram. It is in neither.</p>
<p>Jonson is not accusing Shakespeare of pretending to be the author of
plays written by somebody else, but of “making each man’s wit his own,”
and the men are the other dramatists of the day. Thus the future “may
judge” Shakespeare’s work “to be his as well as ours.”</p>
<p>It is “we,” the living and recognised dramatists, whom Shakespeare is
said to plagiarise from; so boldly that</p>
<p>“We, the robbed, leave rage, and pity it.”</p>
<p>Ben does not mean that Shakespeare is publishing, as his own, whole
plays by some other author, but that his works are tissues of scraps
stolen from his contemporaries, from “us, the robbed.” Where are to be
found or heard of any works by a player-poet of 1601, the would-be chief
dramatist of the day, except those signed William Shak(andandandandc.).
There are none, and thus Ben, at this date, is identifying Will
Shakspere, the actor, with the author of the Shakespearean plays, which
he expects to reach posterity; “after times may judge them to be his,”
as after times do to this hour.</p>
<p>Thus Ben expresses, in accordance with his humour on each occasion,
most discrepant opinions of Will’s works, but he never varies from his
identification of Will with the author of the plays.</p>
<p>The “works” of which Ben wrote so splenetically in Poet-Ape, were the
works of a Playwright-Actor, who could be nobody but the actor
Shakespeare, as far as Ben then knew. If later, and in altered
circumstances, he wrote of the very same works in very different terms,
his “utterances” are “not easily reconcilable” with each other, —
whoever the real author of the works may be. If Bacon, or
Mr. Greenwood’s anonymous equivalent for Bacon, were the author, and if
Ben came to know it, his attitudes towards the works are still as
irreconcilable as ever.</p>
<p>Perhaps Baconians and Mr. Greenwood might say, “as long as Ben
believed that the works were those of an Actor-Playwright, he thought
them execrable. But when he learned that they were the works of Bacon
(or of some Great One), he declared them to be more than excellent” —
but not to Drummond. I am reluctant to think that Jonson was the falsest
and meanest of snobs. I think that when his old rival, by his own
account his dear friend, was dead, and when (1623) Ben was writing
panegyric verses about the first collected edition of his plays (the
Folio), then between generosity and his habitual hyperbolical manner
when he was composing commendatory verses, he said, — not too much in
the way of praise, — but a good deal more than he later said (1630?), in
prose, and in cold blood. I am only taking Ben as I find him and as I
understand him. Every step in my argument rests on well-known facts. Ben
notoriously, in his many panegyric verses, wrote in a style of inflated
praise. In conversation with Drummond he censured, in brief blunt
phrases, the men whom, in verse, he had extolled. The Baconian who has
not read all Ben’s panegyrics in verse, and the whole of his
conversations with Drummond, argues in ignorance.</p>
<p>We now come to Ben’s panegyrics in the Folio of 1623. Ben heads the
lines,</p>
<p>“TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED</p>
<p>THE AUTHOR</p>
<p>MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>WHAT HE HATH LEFT US.”</p>
<p>Words cannot be more explicit. Bacon was alive (I do not know when
Mr. Greenwood’s hidden genius died), and Ben goes on to speak of the
Author, Shakespeare, as dead, and buried. He calls on him thus:</p>
<p>“Soul of the Age!</p>
<p>The applause! delight! the wonder of our Stage!</p>
<p>My Shakespear rise: I will not lodge thee by</p>
<p>Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie</p>
<p>A little further, to make thee a room:</p>
<p>Thou art a monument, without a tomb,</p>
<p>And art alive still, while thy book doth live,</p>
<p>And we have wits to read, and praise to give.”</p>
<p>Beaumont, by the way, died in the same year as Shakespeare, 1616,
and, while Ben here names him with Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare,
his contemporaries have left no anecdotes, no biographical hints. In the
panegyric follow the lines:</p>
<p>“And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,</p>
<p>From thence to honour thee I would not seek</p>
<p>For names, but call forth thund’ring Æschylus,”</p>
<p>and the other glories of the Roman and Attic stage, to see and hear
how Shakespeare bore comparison with all that the classic dramatists
did, or that “did from their ashes come.”</p>
<p>Jonson means, “despite your lack of Greek and Latin I would not
shrink from challenging the greatest Greek and Roman tragedians to see
how you bear comparison with themselves”?</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood and the Baconians believe that the author of the plays
abounded in Latin and Greek. In my opinion his classical scholarship
must have seemed slight indeed to Ben, so learned and so vain of his
learning: but this is part of a vexed question, already examined. So
far, Ben’s verses have brought not a hint to suggest that he does not
identify the actor, his Beloved, with the author. Nothing is gained when
Ben, in commendatory verses, praises “Thy Art,” whereas, speaking to
Drummond of Hawthornden (1619), he said that Shakespeare “wanted art.”
Ben is not now growling to Drummond of Hawthornden: he is writing a
panegyric, and applauds Shakespeare’s “well-turned and true-filed
lines,” adding that, “to write a living line” a man “must sweat,” and
“strike the second heat upon the Muses’ anvil.”</p>
<p>To produce such lines requires labour, requires conscious “art.” So
Shakespeare had “art,” after all, despite what Ben had said to Drummond:
“Shakespeare lacked art.” There is no more in the matter; the
“inconsistency” is that of Ben’s humours on two perfectly different
occasions, now grumbling to Drummond; and now writing hyperbolically in
commendatory verses. But the contrast makes Mr. Greenwood exclaim, “Can
anything be more astonishing and at the same time more unsatisfactory
than this?”</p>
<p>Can anything be more like Ben Jonson?</p>
<p>Did he know the secret of the authorship in 1619? If so, why did he
say nothing about the plays of the Great Unknown (whom he called
Shakespeare), save what Drummond reports, “want of art,” ignorance of
Bohemian geography. Or did Ben not know the secret till, say, 1623, and
then heap on the very works which he had previously scouted praise for
the very quality which he had said they lacked? If so, Ben was as
absolutely inconsistent, as before. There is no way out of this dilemma.
On neither choice are Ben’s utterances “easy to reconcile one with the
other,” except on the ground that Ben was — Ben, and his comments varied
with his varying humours and occasions. I believe that, in the
commendatory verses, Ben allowed his Muse to carry him up to heights of
hyperbolical praise which he never came near in cold blood. He was
warmed with the heat of poetic composition and wound up to heights of
eulogy, though even now he could not forget the small Latin and less
Greek!</p>
<p>We now turn to Mr. Greenwood’s views about the commendatory verses.
On mature consideration I say nothing of his remarks on Ben’s couplets
about the bad engraved portrait. They are concerned with the supposed
“original bust,” as represented in Dugdale’s engraving of 1656. What the
Baconians hope to make out of “the original bust” I am quite unable to
understand. Again, I leave untouched some witticisms on Jonson’s lines
about Spenser, Chaucer, and Beaumont in their tombs — lines either
suggested by, or suggestive of others by an uncertain W. Basse, “but the
evidence of authorship seems somewhat doubtful. How the date is
determined I do not know . . . “ As Mr. Greenwood knows so little, and
as the discussion merely adds dust to the dust, and fog to the mist of
his attempt to disable Ben’s evidence, I glance and pass by.</p>
<p>“Then follow these memorable words, which I have already
discussed:</p>
<p>“’And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek . . . ’”</p>
<p>In “these memorable words,” every non-Baconian sees Ben’s opinion
about his friend’s lack of scholarship. According to his own excellent
Index, Mr. Greenwood has already adverted often to “these memorable
words.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>P. 40. “ . . . if this testimony is to be explained away as not
seriously written, then are we justified in applying the same methods of
interpretation to Jonson’s other utterances as published in the Folio of
1623. But I shall have more to say as to that further on.”</p></li>
<li><p>P. 88. Nothing of importance.</p></li>
<li><p>P. 220. Quotation from Dr. Johnson. Ben, “who had no imaginable
temptation to falsehood,” wrote the memorable words. But Mr. Greenwood
has to imagine a “temptation to falsehood,” — and he does.</p></li>
<li><p>P. 222. “And we have recognised that Jonson’s ‘small Latin and
less Greek’ must be explained away” (a quotation from
somebody).</p></li>
<li><p>P. 225. Allusion to anecdote of “Latin (latten) spoons.”</p></li>
<li><p>P, 383. “Some of us” (some of whom?) “have long looked upon it as
axiomatic . . . that Jonson’s ‘small Latin and less Greek,’ if meant to
be taken seriously, can only be applicable to Shakspere of Stratford and
not to Shakespeare,” that is, not to the Unknown author. Unluckily Ben,
in 1623, is addressing the shade of the “sweet Swan of Avon,” meaning
Stratford-on-Avon.</p></li>
<li><p>The next references in the laudable Index are to p, 475. “Then
follow these memorable words, which I have already discussed:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“‘And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,’</p>
<p>words which those who see how singularly inappropriate they are to
the author of the Plays and Poems of Shakespeare have been at such
infinite pains to explain away without impeaching the credit of the
author, or assuming that he is here indulging in a little Socratic
irony.”</p>
<p>I do not want to “explain” Ben’s words “away”: I want to know how on
earth Mr. Greenwood explains them away. My view is that Ben meant what
he said, that Will, whose shade he is addressing, was no scholar (which
he assuredly was not). I diligently search Mr. Greenwood’s scriptures,
asking How does he explain Ben’s “memorable words” away? On of The
Shakespeare Problem Restated I seem to catch a glimmer of his method.
“Once let the Stratfordians” (every human and non-Baconian person of
education) “admit that Jonson when he penned the words ‘small Latin and
less Greek’ was really writing ‘with his tongue in his cheek.’ . .
.”</p>
<p>Once admit that vulgarism concerning a great English poet engaged on
a poem of Pindaric flight, and of prophetic vision! No, we leave the
admission to Mr. Greenwood and his allies.</p>
<p>To consider thus is to consider too seriously. The Baconians and
Anti-Willians have ceased to deserve serious attention (if ever they did
deserve it), and virtuous indignation, and all that kind of thing, when
they ask people who care for poetry to “admit” that Ben wrote his verses
“with his tongue in his cheek.” Elsewhere, in place of Ben’s “tongue in
his cheek,” Mr. Greenwood prefers to suggest that Ben “is here indulging
in a little Socratic irony.” Socrates “with his tongue in his cheek”!
Say “talking through his throat,” if one may accept the evidence of the
author of Raffles, as to the idioms of burglars.</p>
<p>To return to criticism, we are to admit that Jonson was really
writing “with his tongue in his cheek,” knowing that, as a fact,
“Shakespeare” (the Great Unknown, the Bacon of the Baconians) “had
remarkable classical attainments, and they, of course, open the door to
the suggestion that the entire poem is capable of an ironical
construction and esoteric interpretation.”</p>
<p>So this is Mr. Greenwood’s method of “explaining away” the memorable
words. He seems to conjecture that Will was not Shakespeare, not the
author of the plays; that Jonson knew it; that his poem is, as a whole,
addressed to Bacon, or to the Great Unknown, under his “nom de plume” of
“William Shakespeare”; that the address to the “Swan of Avon” is a mere
blind; and that Ben only alludes to his “Beloved,” the Stratford actor,
when he tells his Beloved that his Beloved has “small Latin and less
Greek.” All the praise is for Bacon, or the Great Unknown (Mr. Harris),
the jeer is for “his Beloved, the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare, And
what he hath left Us.”</p>
<p>As far as I presume to understand this theory of the “tongue in the
cheek,” of the “Socratic irony,” this is what Mr. Greenwood has to
propose towards “explaining away” the evidence of Ben Jonson, in his
famous commendatory verses. When we can see through the dust of words we
find that the “esoteric interpretation” of the commendatory verses is
merely a reassertion of the general theory: a man with small Latin and
less Greek could not have written the plays and poems. Therefore when
Ben explicitly states that his Beloved, Mr. Shakespeare of Stratford,
the Swan of Avon did write the plays, and had small Latin and less
Greek, Ben meant that he did not write them, that they were written by
somebody else who had plenty of Greek and Latin. It is a strange logical
method! Mr. Greenwood merely reasserts his paradox, and proves it, like
certain Biblical critics of more orthodoxy than sense, by aid of his
private “esoteric method of interpretation.” Ben, we say, about 1630, in
prose and in cold blood, and in a humour of criticism without the old
rancour and envy, or the transitory poetic enthusiasm, pens a note on
Shakespeare in a volume styled “Timber, or Discoveries, made upon men
and Matter, as they have flowed out of his daily Readings; or had their
reflux to his peculiar Notion of the Times.” Ben died in 1637; his MS.
collection of notes and brief essays, and reflections, was published in
1641. Bacon, of whom he wrote his impressions in this manuscript, had
died in 1626. Ben was no longer young: he says, among these notes, that
his memory, once unusually strong, after he was past forty “is much
decayed in me . . . It was wont to be faithful to me, but shaken with
age now . . .” (I copy the extract as given by Mr. Greenwood. ) He spoke
sooth: he attributes to Orpheus, in “Timber,” a line from Homer, and
quotes from Homer what is not in that poet’s “works.”</p>
<p>In this manuscript occurs, then, a brief prose note, headed, De
Shakespeare nostrati, on our countryman Shakespeare. It is an anecdote
of the Players and their ignorance, with a few critical and personal
remarks on Shakespeare. “I remember the players have often mentioned it
as an honour to Shakespeare that (whatsoever he penned) he never blotted
out a line. My answer hath been, ‘Would he had blotted a thousand,’
which they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this
but for their ignorance who chose that circumstance to commend their
friend by (that) wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own
candour, for I loved the man, and do honour his memory on this side
idolatry as much as any. He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free
nature; had an excellent phantasy, brave notions and gentle expressions,
wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he
should be stopped. ‘Sufflaminandus erat,’ as Augustus said of Haterius.
His wit was in his own power; would the rule of it had been so too! Many
times he fell into those things could not escape laughter, as when he
said in the person of Cæsar, one speaking to him, ‘Cæsar, thou dost me
wrong.’ He replied, ‘Cæsar did never wrong but with just cause’; and
such like, which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his vices with his
virtues. There was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.”
Baconians actually maintain that Ben is here speaking of Bacon.</p>
<p>Of whom is Ben writing? Of the author of Julius Cæsar, — certainly,
from which, his memory failing, he misquotes a line. If Ben be in the
great secret — that the author was Bacon, or Mr. Greenwood’s Great
Unknown, he is here no more enthusiastic about the Shadow or the
Statesman, than about Shakespeare; no less cool and critical, whoever
may be the subject of his comments. Whether, in the commendatory verses,
he referred to the Actor-Author, or Bacon, or the Shining Shadow, or all
of them at once, he is now in a mood very much more cool and critical.
If to be so cool and critical is violently inconsistent in the case of
the Stratford actor, it is not less so if Ben has Bacon or the Shadow in
his mind. Meanwhile the person of whom he speaks is here the
actor-author, whom the players, his friends, commended “wherein he
faulted,” namely, in not “blotting” where, in a thousand cases, Ben
wishes that he had blotted. Can the most enthusiastic Baconian believe
that when Ben wrote about the players’ ignorant applause of
Shakespeare’s, of their friend’s lack of care in correction, Ben had
Bacon in his mind?</p>
<p>As for Mr. Greenwood, he says that in Ben’s sentence about the
players and their ignorant commendation, “we have it on Jonson’s
testimony that the players looked upon William Shakspere the actor as
the author of the plays and praised him for never blotting out a line.”
We have it, and how is the critic to get over or round the fact? Thus,
“We know that this statement” (about the almost blotless lines) “is
ridiculous; that if the players had any unblotted manuscripts in their
hands (which is by no means probable) they were merely fair copies . .
.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, but the Baconians appear to assume that a “fair copy” is
not, and cannot be, a copy in the handwriting of the author.</p>
<p>As I have said before, the Players knew Will’s handwriting, if he
could write. If they received his copy in a hand not his own, and were
not idiots, they could not praise him and his unerring speed and
accuracy in penning his thoughts. If, on the other hand, Will could not
write, in their long friendship with Will, the Players must have known
the fact, and could not possibly believe, as they certainly did, “on
Jonson’s testimony” in his authorship.</p>
<p>To finish Mr. Greenwood’s observations, “if they” (the players)
“really thought that the author of the plays wrote them off currente
calamo, and never” (or “hardly ever”) “blotted a line, never revised,
never made any alterations, they knew nothing whatever concerning the
real Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>Nothing whatever? What they did not know was merely that Will gave
them fair copies in his own hand, as, before the typewriting machine was
invented, authors were wont to do. Within the last fortnight I heard the
error attributed to the players made by an English scholar who is
foremost in his own field of learning. He and I were looking at some of
Dickens’s MSS. They were full of erasions and corrections. I said, “How
unlike Scott!” whose first draft of his novels exactly answered to the
players’ description of Will’s “copy.” My friend said, “Browning
scarcely made an erasion or change in writing his poems,” and referred
to Mr. Browning’s MSS. for the press, of which examples were lying near
us. “But Browning must have made clean copies for the press,” I said:
which was as new an idea to my learned friend as it was undreamed of by
the Players: — if what they received from him were his clean copies.</p>
<p>The Players’ testimony, through Jonson, cannot be destroyed by the
“easy stratagem” of Mr. Greenwood.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood now nearly falls back on Bacon, though he constantly
professes that he “is not the advocate of Bacon’s authorship.” The
author was some great man, as like Bacon as one pea to another.
Mr. Greenwood says that Jonson looked on the issue of the First Folio
“as a very special occasion.” Well, it was a very special occasion; no
literary occasion could be more “special.” Without the Folio, badly as
it is executed, we should perhaps never have had many of Shakespeare’s
plays. The occasion was special in the highest degree.</p>
<p>But, says Mr. Greenwood, “if we could only get to the back of
Jonson’s mind, we should find that there was some efficient cause
operating to induce him to give the best possible send-off to that
celebrated venture.”</p>
<p>Ben was much in the habit of giving “sendoffs” of great eloquence to
poetic “ventures” now forgotten. What could “the efficient cause” be in
the case of the Folio? At once Mr. Greenwood has recourse to Bacon; he
cannot, do what he will, keep Bacon “out of the Memorial.” Ben was with
Bacon at Gorhambury, on Bacon’s sixtieth birthday (January 22, 1621).
Ben wrote verses about the Genius of the old house,</p>
<p>“Thou stand’st as if some mystery thou didst.”</p>
<p>“What was that ‘mystery’?” asks Mr. Greenwood. What indeed? And what
has all this to do with Ben’s commendatory verses for the Folio, two
years later? Mr. Greenwood also surmises, as we have seen, that Jonson
was with Bacon, helping to translate The Advancement of Learning in
June, 1623.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that he was: what has that to do with Ben’s verses for
the Folio? Does Mr. Greenwood mean to hint that Bacon was the “efficient
cause operating to induce” Ben “to give the best possible send-off” to
the Folio? One does not see what interest Bacon had in stimulating the
enthusiasm of Ben, unless we accept Bacon as author of the plays, which
Mr. Greenwood does not. If Mr. Greenwood thinks that Bacon was the
author of the plays, then the facts are suitable to his belief. But if
he does not,— “I hold no brief for the Baconians,” he says, — how is all
this passage on Ben’s visits to Bacon concerned with the subject in
hand?</p>
<p>Between the passage on some “efficient cause” “at the back of Ben’s
mind,” and the passage on Ben’s visits to Bacon in 1621–3, six pages
intervene, and blur the supposed connection between the “efficient
cause” of Ben’s verses of 1623, and his visits to Bacon in 1621–3. These
intercalary pages are concerned with Ben’s laudations of Bacon, by name,
in his Discoveries. The first is entirely confined to praise of Bacon as
an orator. Bacon is next mentioned in a Catalogue of Writers as “he who
hath filled up all numbers, and performed that in our tongue which may
be preferred or compared either to insolent Greece or haughty Rome,”
words used of Shakespeare by Jonson in the Folio verses.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood remarks that Jonson’s Catalogue, to judge by the names
he cites (More, Chaloner, Smith, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Sidney, Hooker,
Essex, Raleigh, Savile, Sandys, and so on), suggests that “he is
thinking mainly of wits and orators of his own and the preceding
generation,” not of poets specially. This is obvious; why should Ben
name Shakespeare with More, Smith, Chaloner, Eliot, Bishop Gardiner,
Egerton, Sandys, and Savile? Yet “it is remarkable that no mention
should be made of the great dramatist.” Where is Spenser named, or
Beaumont, or Chaucer, with whom Ben ranked Shakespeare? Ben quoted of
Bacon the line he wrote long before of Shakespeare as a poet, about
“insolent Greece,” and all this is “remarkable,” and Mr. Greenwood finds
it “not surprising” that the Baconians dwell on the “extraordinary
coincidence of expression,” as if Ben were incapable of repeating a
happy phrase from himself, and as if we should wonder at anything the
Baconians may say or do.</p>
<p>Another startling coincidence is that, in Discoveries, Ben said of
Shakespeare “his wit was in his own power,” and wished that “the rule of
it had been so too.” Of Bacon, Ben wrote, “his language, where he could
spare or pass by a jest, was nobly censorious.” Thus Bacon had “the rule
of his own wit,” Bacon “could spare or pass by a jest,” whereas
Shakespeare apparently could not — so like were the two Dromios in this
particular! Strong in these convincing arguments, the Baconians ask (not
so Mr. Greenwood, he is no Baconian), “were there then two writers of
whom this description was appropriate . . . ?” Was there only one, and
was it of Bacon, under the name of “Shakespeare,” that Ben wrote De
Shakespeare nostrati?</p>
<p>Read it again, substituting “Bacon” for “Shakespeare.” “I remember
the players,” and so on, and what has Bacon to do here? “Sometimes it
was necessary that Bacon should be stopped.” “Many times Bacon fell into
those things could not escape laughter,” such as Cæsar’s supposed line,
“and such like, which were ridiculous.” “Bacon redeemed his vices with
his virtues. There was ever more in Bacon to be praised than to be
pardoned.”</p>
<p>Thus freely, according to the Baconians, speaks Ben of Bacon, whom he
here styles “Shakespeare,” — Heaven knows why! while crediting him with
the players as his friends. Ben could not think or speak thus of Bacon.
Mr. Greenwood occupies his space with these sagacities of the Baconians;
one marvels why he takes the trouble. We are asked why Ben wrote so
little and that so cool (“I loved him on this side idolatry as much as
any”) about Shakespeare. Read through Ben’s Discoveries: what has he to
say about any one of his great contemporary dramatists, from Marlowe to
Beaumont? He says nothing about any of them; though he had panegyrised
them, as he panegyrised Beaumont, in verse. In his prose Discoveries he
speaks, among English dramatists, of Shakespeare alone.</p>
<p>We are also asked by the Baconians to believe that his remarks on
Bacon under the name of Shakespeare are really an addition to his more
copious and infinitely more reverential observations on Bacon, named by
his own name; “I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was
only proper to himself.” Also (where Bacon is spoken of as Shakespeare)
“He redeemed his vices by his virtues. There was ever more in him to be
praised than to be pardoned . . . Sometimes it was necessary that he
should be stopped . . . Many times he fell into those things that could
not escape laughter.”</p>
<p>These two views of Bacon are, if you like, incongruous. The person
spoken of is in both cases Bacon, say the Baconians, and Mr. Greenwood
sympathetically alludes to their ideas, which I cannot qualify in
courteous terms. Baconians “would, of course, explain the difficulty by
saying that however sphinx-like were Jonson’s utterances, he had clearly
distinct in his own mind two different personages, viz. Shakspere the
player, and Shakespeare the real author of the plays and poems, and that
if in the perplexing passage quoted from the Discoveries he appears to
confound one with the other, it is because the solemn seal of secrecy
had been imposed on him.” They would say, they do say all that. Ben is
not to let out that Bacon is the author. So he tells us of Bacon that he
often made himself ridiculous, and so forth, — but he pretends that he
is speaking of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>All this wedge of wisdom, remember, is inserted between the search
for “the efficient cause” of Ben’s panegyric (1623), in the Folio, on
his Beloved Mr. William Shakespeare, and the discovery of Ben’s visits
to Bacon in 1621–3.</p>
<p>Does Mr. Greenwood mean that Ben, in 1623 (or earlier), knew the
secret of Bacon’s authorship, and, stimulated by his hospitality,
applauded his works in the Folio, while, as he must not disclose the
secret, he throughout speaks of Bacon as Shakespeare, puns on that name
in the line about seeming “to shake a lance,” and salutes the Lord of
Gorhambury as “Sweet Swan of Avon”? Mr. Greenwood cannot mean that; for
he is not a Baconian. What does he mean?</p>
<p>Put together his pages 483, 489–491. On the former we find how “it
would appear” that Jonson thought the issue of the Folio (1623) “a very
special occasion,” and that perhaps if we could only “get to the back of
his mind, we should find that there was some efficient cause operating
to induce him to give the best possible send-off to that celebrated
venture.” Then skip to p–491, and you find very special occasions:
Bacon’s birthday feast with its “mystery”; Ben as one of Bacon’s “good
pens,” in 1623. “The best of these good pens, it seems, was Jonson.” On
what evidence does it “seem”? The opinion of Judge Webb.</p>
<p>Is this supposed collaboration with Bacon in 1623, “the efficient
cause operating to induce” Ben “to give the best possible send-off” to
the Folio? How could this be the “efficient cause” if Bacon were not the
author of the plays?</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, like the Genius at the birthday supper,</p>
<p>“Stands as if some mystery he did.”</p>
<p>On a trifling point of honour, namely, as to whether Ben were a man
likely to lie, tortuously, hypocritically, to be elaborately false about
the authorship of the Shakespearean plays, it is hopelessly impossible
to bring the Baconians and Mr. Greenwood (who “holds no brief for the
Baconians”) to my point of view. Mr. Greenwood rides off thus — what the
Baconians do is unimportant.</p>
<p>“There are, as everybody knows, many falsehoods that are justifiable,
some that it is actually a duty to tell.” It may be so; I pray that I
may never tell any of them (or any more of them).</p>
<p>Among justifiable lies I do not reckon that of Scott if ever he
plumply denied that he wrote the Waverley novels. I do not judge Sir
Walter. Heaven forbid! But if, in Mr. Greenwood’s words, he, “we are
told, thought it perfectly justifiable for a writer who wished to
preserve his anonymity, to deny, when questioned, the authorship of a
work, since the interrogator had no right to put such a question to
him,” I disagree with Sir Walter. Many other measures, in accordance
with the conditions of each case, were open to him. Some are formulated
by his own Bucklaw, in The Bride of Lammermoor, as regards questions
about what occurred on his bridal night. Bucklaw would challenge the
man, and cut the lady, who asked questions. But Scott’s case, as cited,
applies only to Bacon (or Mr. Greenwood’s Unknown), if he were asked
whether or not he were the author of the plays. No idiot, at that date,
was likely to put the question! But, if anyone did ask, Bacon must
either evade, or deny, or tell the truth.</p>
<p>On the parallel of Scott, Bacon could thus deny, evade, or tell the
truth. But the parallel of Scott is not applicable to any other person
except to the author who wishes to preserve his anonymity, and is
questioned. The parallel does not apply to Ben. He had not written the
Shakespearean plays. Nobody was asking him if he had written them. If he
knew that the author was Bacon, and knew it under pledge of secrecy, and
was asked (per impossibile) “Who wrote these plays?” he had only to say,
“Look at the title-page.” But no mortal was asking Ben the question. But
we are to suppose that, in the panegyric and in Discoveries, Ben chooses
to assert, first, that Shakespeare was his Beloved, his Sweet Swan of
Avon; and that he “loved him, on this side idolatry, as much as any.”
There is no evidence that he did love Shakespeare, except his own
statement, when, according to the Baconians, he is really speaking of
Bacon, and, according to Mr. Greenwood, of an unknown person, singularly
like Bacon. Consequently, unless we can prove that Ben really loved the
actor, he is telling a disgustingly hypocritical and wholly needless
falsehood, both before and after the death of Bacon. To be silent about
the authorship of a book, an authorship which is the secret of your
friend and patron, is one thing and a blameless thing. All the friends,
some twenty, to whom Scott confided the secret of his authorship were
silent. But not one of them publicly averred that the author was their
very dear friend, So-and-so, who was not Scott, and perhaps not their
friend at all. That was Ben’s line. Thus the parallel with Scott drawn
by Mr. Greenwood, twice, is no parallel. It has no kind of analogy with
Ben’s alleged falsehoods, so elaborate, so incomprehensible except by
Baconians, and, if he did not love the actor Shakspere dearly, so
detestably hypocritical, and open to instant detection.</p>
<p>It is not easy to find a parallel to the conduct with which Ben is
charged. But suppose that Scott lived unsuspected of writing his novels,
which, let us say, he signed “James Hogg,” and died without confessing
his secret, and without taking his elaborate precautions for its
preservation on record.</p>
<p>Next, imagine that Lockhart knew Scott’s secret, under vow of
silence, and was determined to keep it at any cost. He therefore,
writing after the death of Hogg of Ettrick, and in Scott’s lifetime,
publishes verses declaring that Hogg was his “beloved” (an enormous
fib), and that Hogg, “Sweet Swan of Ettrick,” was the author of the
Waverley novels.</p>
<p>To complete the parallels, Lockhart, after Scott’s death, leaves a
note in prose to the effect that, while he loved Hogg on this side
idolatry (again, a monstrous fable), he must confess that Hogg, author
of the Waverley novels, often fell into things that were ridiculous; and
often needed to have a stopper put on him for all these remarks.
Lockhart, while speaking of Hogg, is thinking of Scott — and he makes
the remarks solely to conceal Scott’s authorship of the novels — of
which, on the hypothesis, nobody suspected Scott to be the author.
Lockhart must then have been what the Baconian Mr. Theobald calls
Mr. Churton Collins, “a measureless liar,” — all for no reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, starting as usual from the case, which is no parallel,
of Scott’s denying his own authorship, goes on, “for all we know, Jonson
might have seen nothing in the least objectionable in the publication by
some great personage of his dramatic works under a pseudonym” (under
another man’s name really), “even though that pseudonym led to a wrong
conception as to the authorship; and that, if, being a friend of that
great personage, and working in his service” (Ben worked, by the theory,
in Bacon’s), “he had solemnly engaged to preserve the secret inviolate,
and not to reveal it even to posterity, then doubtless (‘I thank thee,
Jew’ (meaning Sir Sidney Lee), ‘for teaching me that word’!) he would
have remained true to that solemn pledge.”</p>
<p>To remain “true,” Ben had only to hold his peace. But he lied up and
down, and right and left, and even declared that Bacon was a friend of
the players, and needed to be shut up, and made himself a laughing-stock
in his plays, — styling Bacon “Shakespeare.” All this, and much more of
the same sort, we must steadfastly believe before we can be Baconians,
for only by believing these doctrines can we get rid of Ben Jonson’s
testimony to the authorship of Will Shakspere, Gent.</p>
<ol start="13" type="I">
<li>THE PREOCCUPATIONS OF BACON</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us now examine a miracle and mystery in which the Baconians find
nothing strange; nothing that is not perfectly normal. Bacon was the
author of the Shakespearean plays, they tell us. Let us look rapidly at
his biography, after which we may ask, does not his poetic supremacy,
and imaginative fertility, border on the miraculous, when we consider
his occupations and his ruling passion?</p>
<p>Bacon, born in 1561, had a prodigious genius, was well aware of it,
and had his own ideal as to the task which he was born to do. While
still at Cambridge, and therefore before he was fifteen, he was utterly
dissatisfied, as he himself informed Dr. Rawley, with the scientific
doctrines of the Schools. In the study of nature they reasoned from
certain accepted ideas, a priori principles, not from what he came to
call “interrogation of Nature.” There were, indeed, and had long been
experimental philosophers, but the school doctors went not beyond
Aristotle; and discovered nothing. As Mr. Spedding puts it, the boy
Bacon asked himself, “If our study of nature be thus barren, our method
of study must be wrong; might not a better method be found? . . . Upon
the conviction ‘This may be done,’ followed at once the question, How
may it be done? Upon that question answered followed the resolution to
try and do it.”</p>
<p>This was, in religious phrase, the Conversion of Bacon, “the event
which had a greater influence than any other upon his character and
future course. From that moment he had a vocation which employed and
stimulated him . . . an object to live for as wide as humanity, as
immortal as the human race; an idea to live in vast and lofty enough to
fill the soul for ever with religious and heroic aspirations.” The
vocation, the idea, the object, were not poetical.</p>
<p>In addition to this ceaseless scientific preoccupation, Bacon was
much concerned with the cause of reformed religion (then at stake in
France, and supposed to be in danger at home), and with the good
government of his native country. He could only aid that cause by the
favour of Elizabeth and James; by his services in Parliament, where,
despite his desire for advancement, he conscientiously opposed the
Queen. He was obliged to work at such tasks of various sorts, legal and
polemical literature, as were set him by people in power. With these
three great objects filling his heart, inspiring his ambition, and
occupying his energies and time, we cannot easily believe, without
direct external evidence, that he, or any mortal, could have leisure and
detachment from his main objects (to which we may add his own
advancement) sufficient to enable him to compose the works ascribed to
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Thus, at the age of twenty-two (1583), when, if ever, he might have
penned sonnets to his mistress’s eyebrow, he reports that he wrote “his
first essay on the Instauration of Philosophy, which he called Temporis
Partus Maximus, ‘The Greatest Birth of Time,’” and “we need not doubt
that between Law and Philosophy he found enough to do.” For the
Baconians take Bacon to have been a very great lawyer (of which I am no
judge), and Law is a hard mistress, rapacious of a man’s hours. In 1584
he entered Parliament, but we do not hear anything very important of his
occupations before 1589, when he wrote a long pamphlet, “Touching the
Controversies of the Church of England.” He had then leisure enough;
that he was not anonymously supplying the stage with plays I can neither
prove nor disprove: but there is no proof that he wrote Love’s Labour’s
Lost! By 1591–2, we learn much of him from his letter to Cecil, who
never would give him a place wherein he could meditate his philosophy.
He was apparently hard at scientific work. “I account my ordinary course
of study and meditation to be more painful than most parts of action
are.” He adds, “The contemplative planet carries me away wholly,” and by
contemplation I conceive him to mean what he calls “vast contemplative
ends.” These he proceeds to describe: he does not mean the writing of
Venus and Adonis (1593), nor of Lucrece (1594), nor of comedies! “I have
taken all knowledge to be my province,” and he recurs to his protest
against the pseudo-science of his period. “If I could purge knowledge of
two sorts of rovers whereof the one, with frivolous disputations,
confutations, and verbosities; the other with blind experiments, and
auricular traditions and impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I
hope I should bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions,
and profitable inventions and discoveries . . . This, whether it be
curiosity, or vainglory, or nature, or (if one take it favourably)
philanthropy, is so fixed in my mind that it cannot be removed.” If
Cecil cannot help him to a post, if he cannot serve the truth, he will
reduce himself, like Anaxagoras, to voluntary poverty, “ . . . and
become some sorry bookmaker, or a true pioneer in that mine of truth . .
. “ Really, from first to last he was the prince of begging-letter
writers, endlessly asking for place, pensions, reversions, money, and
more money.</p>
<p>Though his years were thirty-one, Bacon was as young at heart as
Shelley at eighteen, when he wrote thus to Cecil, “my Lord Treasurer
Burghley.” What did Cecil care for his youngish kinsman’s philanthropy,
and “vast speculative ends” (how modern it all is!), and the rest of it?
But just because Bacon, at thirty-one, is so extremely “green,” going to
“take all knowledge for his province” (if some one will only subsidise
him, and endow his research), I conceive that he was in earnest about
his reformation of science. Surely no Baconian will deny it! Being so
deeply in earnest, taking his “study and meditation” so hard, I cannot
see him as the author of Venus and Adonis, and whatever plays of the
period, — say, Love’s Labour’s Lost, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, Henry
VI, Part I, — are attributed to him, about this time, by Baconians. Of
course my view is merely personal or “subjective.” The Baconians’ view
is also “subjective.” I regard Bacon, in 1591, and later, as
intellectually preoccupied by his vast speculative aims: — what he says
that he desires to do, in science, is what he did, as far as he was
able. His other desires, his personal advancement, money, a share in the
conduct of affairs, he also hotly pursued, not much to his own or the
public profit. There seems to be no room left, no inclination left, for
competition in their own line with Marlowe, Greene, Nash, and half a
dozen other professed playwrights: no room for plays done under the
absurd pseudonym of an ignorant actor.</p>
<p>You see these things as the Baconians do, or as I do. Argument is
unavailing. I take Bacon to have been sincere in his effusive letter to
Cecil. Not so the Baconians; he concealed, they think, a vast literary
aim. They must take his alternative — to be “some sorry bookmaker, or a
pioneer in that mine of truth,” as meaning that he would either be the
literary hack of a company of players, or the founder of a regenerating
philosophy. But, at that date, playwrights could not well be called
“bookmakers,” for the owners of the plays did their best to keep them
from appearing as printed books. If Bacon by “bookmaker” meant
“playwright,” he put a modest value on his poetical work!</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1591–2), Bacon attached himself to the young, beautiful,
and famous Essex, on the way to be a Favourite, and gave him much
excellent advice, as he always did, and, as always, his advice was not
taken. It is not a novel suggestion, that Essex is the young man to whom
Bacon is so passionately attached in the Sonnets traditionally
attributed to Shakespeare. “I applied myself to him” (that is, to
Essex), says Bacon, “in a manner which, I think, happeneth rarely among
men.” The poet of the Sonnets applies himself to the Beloved Youth, in a
manner which (luckily) “happeneth rarely among men.”</p>
<p>It is difficult to fit the Sonnets into Bacon’s life. But, if you
pursue the context of what Bacon says concerning Essex, you find that he
does not speak openly of a tenderly passionate attachment to that young
man; not more than this, “I did nothing but advise and ruminate with
myself, to the best of my understanding, propositions and memorials of
anything that might concern his Lordship’s honour, fortune, or service.”
As Bacon did nothing but these things (1591–2), he had no great leisure
for writing poetry and plays. Moreover, speaking as a poet, in the
Sonnets, he might poetically exaggerate his intense amatory devotion to
Essex into the symbolism of his passionate verse. Was Essex then a
married man? If so, the Sonneteer’s insistence on his marrying must be
symbolical of — anything else you please.</p>
<p>We know that Bacon, at this period, “did nothing” but “ruminate”
about Essex. The words are his own! (1604). No plays, no Venus and
Adonis, nothing but enthusiastic service of Essex and the Sonnets.
Mr. Spedding, indeed, thinks that, to adorn some pageant of Essex
(November 17, 1592), Bacon kindly contributed such matter as “Mr. Bacon
in Praise of Knowledge” (containing his usual views about regenerating
science), and “Mr. Bacon’s Discourse in Praise of his Sovereign.” Both
are excellent, though, for a Court festival, not very gay.</p>
<p>He also, very early in 1593, wrote an answer to Father Parson’s (?)
famous indictment of Elizabeth’s Government, in Observations on a Libel.
What with ruminating on Essex, and this essay, he was not solely devoted
to Venus and Adonis and to furbishing-up old plays, though, no doubt, he
may have unpacked his bosom in the Sonnets, and indulged his luscious
imaginations in Venus and Adonis. I would not limit the potentialities
of his genius. But, certainly, this amazing man was busy in quite other
matters than poetry; not to mention his severe “study and meditation” on
science.</p>
<p>All these activities of Bacon, in the year of Venus and Adonis, do
not exhaust his exercises. Bacon, living laborious days, plunged into
the debate in the Commons on Supply and fell into Elizabeth’s disgrace,
and vainly competed with Coke for the Attorney-Generalship, and went on
to write a pamphlet on the conspiracy of Lopez, and to try to gain the
office of Solicitor-General, to manage Essex’s affairs, to plead at the
Bar, to do Crown work as a lawyer, to urge his suit for the
Solicitorship; to trifle with the composition of “Formularies and
Elegancies” (January 1595), to write his Essays, to try for the
Mastership of the Rolls, to struggle with the affairs of the doomed
Essex (1600–1), while always “labouring in secret” at that vast aim of
the reorganisation of natural science, which ever preoccupied him, he
says, and distracted his attention from his practice and from affairs of
State. Of these State affairs the projected Union with Scotland was the
most onerous. He was also writing The Advancement of Learning (1605). “I
do confess,” he wrote to Sir Thomas Bodley, “since I was of any
understanding, my mind hath in effect been absent from that I have
done.” His mind was with his beloved Reformation of Learning: this came
between him and his legal, his political labours, his pamphlet-writing,
and his private schemes and suits. To this burden of Atlas the Baconians
add the vamping-up of old plays for Shakespeare’s company, and the
inditing of new plays, poems, and the Sonnets. Even without this
considerable addition to his tasks, Bacon is wonderful enough, but with
it — he needs the sturdy faith of the Rationalist to accept him and his
plot — to write plays under the pseudonym of “William Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>Talk of miracles as things which do not happen! The activities of
Bacon from 1591 to 1605; the strain on that man’s mind and heart, —
especially his heart, when we remember that he had to prosecute his
passionately adored Essex to the death; all this makes it seem, to me,
improbable that, as Mrs. Pott and her school of Baconians hold, he lived
to be at least a hundred and six, if not much older. No wonder that he
turned to tragedy, Lear, Macbeth, Othello, and saw life en noir: man
delighted him not, nor woman either.</p>
<p>The occupations, and, even more, the scientific preoccupation of
Bacon, do not make his authorship of the plays a physical impossibility.
But they make it an intellectual miracle. Perhaps I may be allowed to
set off this marvel against that other portent, Will Shakspere’s
knowledge and frequent use of terms of Law. I do not pretend to
understand how Will came to have them at the tip of his pen. Thus it may
be argued that the Sonnets are by Bacon and no other man, because the
Law is so familiar to the author, and his legal terms are always used
with so nice an accuracy, that only Bacon can have been capable of these
mysterious productions. (But why was Bacon so wofully inaccurate in
points of scholarship and history?)</p>
<p>By precisely the same argument Lord Penzance proves that Bacon (not
Ben, as Mr. Greenwood holds) wrote for the players the Dedication of the
Folio. “If it should be the case that Francis Bacon wrote the plays, he
would, probably, afterwards have written the Dedication of the Folio,
and the style of it” (stuffed with terms of law) “would be accounted
for.” Mr. Greenwood thinks that Jonson wrote the Dedication; so Ben,
too, was fond of using legal terms in literature. “Legal terms abounded
in all plays and poems of the period,” says Sir Sidney Lee, and
Mr. Greenwood pounces on the word “all.” However he says, “We must admit
that this use of legal jargon is frequently found in lay-writers, poets,
and others of the Elizabethan period — in sonnets for example, where it
seems to us intolerable.” Examples are given from Barnabe Barnes. The
lawyers all agree, however, that Shakespeare does the legal style “more
natural,” and more accurately than the rest. And yet I cannot even argue
that, if he did use legal terms at all, he would be sure to do it pretty
well.</p>
<p>For on this point of Will’s use of legal phraseology I frankly
profess myself entirely at a loss. To use it in poetry was part of the
worse side of taste at that period. The lawyers with one voice declare
that Will’s use of it is copious and correct, and that their “mystery”
is difficult, their jargon hard to master; “there is nothing so
dangerous,” wrote Lord Campbell, “as for one not of the craft to tamper
with our freemasonry.” I have not tampered with it. Perhaps a man of
genius who found it interesting might have learned the technical terms
more readily than lawyers deem possible. But Will, so accurate in his
legal terms, is so inaccurate on many other points; for example, in
civil and natural history, and in classic lore. Mr. Greenwood proves him
to be totally at sea as a naturalist. On the habits of bees, for
example, “his natural history of the insect is as limited as it is
inaccurate.” Virgil, though not a Lord Avebury, was a great
entomologist, compared with Will. About the cuckoo Will was recklessly
misinformed. His Natural History was folklore, or was taken from that
great mediæval storehouse of absurdities, the popular work of Pliny. “He
went to contemporary error or antiquated fancy for his facts, not to
nature,” says a critic quoted by Mr. Greenwood. Was that worthy of
Bacon?</p>
<p>All these charges against le vieux Williams (as Théophile Gautier
calls our Will) I admit. But Will was no Bacon; Will had not “taken all
knowledge for his province.” Bacon, I hope, had not neglected Bees! Thus
the problem, why is Will accurate in his legal terminology, and reckless
of accuracy in quantity, in history, in classic matters, is not by me to
be solved. I can only surmise that from curiosity, or for some other
unknown reason, he had read law-books, or drawn information from
Templars about the meaning of their jargon, and that, for once, he was
technically accurate.</p>
<p>We have now passed in review the chief Baconian and Anti-Willian
arguments against Will Shakespeare’s authorship of the plays and poems.
Their chief argument for Bacon is aut Diabolus, aut Franciscus, which,
freely interpreted, means, “If Bacon is not the author, who the devil
is?”</p>
<p>We reply, that man is the author (in the main) to whom the works are
attributed by every voice of his own generation which mentions them,
namely, the only William Shakespeare that, from 1593 to the early years
of the second decade of the following century, held a prominent place in
the world of the drama. His authorship is explicitly vouched for by his
fellow-players, Heminge and Condell, to whom he left bequests in his
will; and by his sometime rival, later friend, and always critic, Ben
Jonson; Heywood, player and playwright and pamphleteer, who had been one
of Henslowe’s “hands,” and lived into the Great Rebellion, knew the
stage and authors for the stage from within, and his “mellifluous
Shakespeare” is “Will,” as his Beaumont was “Frank,” his Marlowe “Kit,”
his Fletcher, “Jack.” The author of Daiphantus (1604), mentioning the
popularity of Hamlet, styles it “one of friendly Shakespeare’s
tragedies.” Shakespeare, to him, was our Will clearly, a man of known
and friendly character. The other authors of allusions did not need to
say who their “Shakespeare” was, any more than they needed to say who
Marlowe or any other poet was. We have examined the possibly
unprecedented argument which demands that they who mention Shakespeare
as the poet must, if they would enlighten us, add explicitly that he is
also the actor.</p>
<p>“But all may have been deceived” by the long conspiracy of the astute
Bacon, or the Nameless One. To believe this possible, considering the
eager and suspicious jealousy and volubility of rival playwrights, is to
be credulous indeed. The Baconians, representing Will almost as
incapable of the use of pen and ink as “the old hermit of Prague,”
destroy their own case. A Will who had to make his mark, like his
father, could not pose as an author even to the call-boy of his company.
Mr. Greenwood’s bookless Will, with some crumbs of Latin, and some power
of “bumbasting out a blank verse,” is a rather less impossible
pretender, indeed; but why and when did the speaker of patois, the
bookless one, write blank verse, from 1592 onwards, and where are his
blank verses? Where are the “works” of Poet-Ape? As to the man, even
Will by tradition, whatever it may be worth, he was “a handsome,
well-shaped man; very good company, and of a very ready and pleasant,
smooth wit.” To his fellow-actors he was “so worthy a friend and fellow”
(associate). To Jonson, “he was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free
nature; had an excellent phantasy, brave notions, and gentle
expressions, wherein he flowed so freely that sometimes it was necessary
he should be stopped.” If Jonson here refers, as I suppose he does, to
his conversation, it had that extraordinary affluence of thoughts, each
mating itself with as remarkable originality of richly figured
expressions, which is so characteristic of the style of Shakespeare’s
plays. In this prodigality he was remote indeed from the style of the
Greeks; “panting Time toils after him in vain,” and even the reader,
much more the listener, might say, sufflaminandus est; “he needs to have
the brake put on.”</p>
<p>Such, according to unimpeachable evidence, was Will. Only despair can
venture the sad suggestion that, under the name of Shakespeare, Ben is
here speaking of Bacon, as “falling into those things which could not
escape laughter . . . which were ridiculous.” But to this last poor
shift and fantastic guess were the Anti-Willians and Baconians
reduced.</p>
<p>Such was Shakespeare, according to a rival.</p>
<p>But it is “impossible” that a man should have known so much,
especially of classical literature and courtly ways, and foreign manners
and phrases, if he had no more, at most, than four or five years at a
Latin school, and five or six years in that forcing-house of faculty,
the London of the stage, in the flush of the triumph over the
Armada.</p>
<p>“With innumerable sorts of English books and infinite fardles of
printed pamphlets this country is pestered, all shops stuffed, and every
study furnished,” says a contemporary. If a doubter will look at the
cheap and common books of that day (a play in quarto, and the Sonnets of
Shakespeare, when new, were sold for fippence) in any great collection;
he will not marvel that to a lover of books, poor as he might be, many
were accessible. Such a man cannot be kept from books.</p>
<p>If the reader will look into “the translations and imitations of the
classics which poured from the press . . . the poems and love-pamphlets
and plays of the University wits” (when these chanced to be printed),
“the tracts and dialogues in the prevailing taste,” he will understand
the literary soil in which the genius of Shakespeare blossomed as
rapidly as the flowers in “Adonis’ garden.” The whole literature was, to
an extent which we find tedious, saturated with classical myths,
anecdotes, philosophic dicta — a world of knowledge of a kind then “in
widest commonalty spread,” but now so much forgotten that, to Baconians
and the public, such lore seems recondite learning.</p>
<p>The gallants who haunted the stage, and such University wits as could
get the money, or had talent (like Crichton) to “dispute their way
through Europe,” made the Italian tour, and, notoriously, were
“Italianate.” They would not be chary of reminiscences of Florence,
Venice, and Rome. Actors visited Denmark and Germany. No man at home was
far to seek for knowledge of Elsinore, the mysterious Venetian “tranect
or common ferry,” the gondolas, and the Rialto. There was no lack of
soldiers fresh and voluble from the foreign wars. Only dullards, or the
unthinking, can be surprised by the ease with which a quick-witted man,
having some knowledge of Latin, can learn to read a novel in French,
Italian, or Spanish. That Shakespeare was the very reverse of a dullard,
of the clod of Baconian fancy, is proved by the fact that he was thought
capable of his works. For courtly manners he had the literary convention
and Lyly’s Court Comedies, with what he saw when playing at the Court
and in the houses of the great. As to untaught nobility of manners,
there came to the Court of France in 1429, from a small pig-breeding
village on the marches of Lorraine, one whose manners were deemed of
exquisite grace, propriety, and charm, by all who saw and heard her: of
her manners and swift wit and repartee, the official record of her trial
bears concordant evidence. Other untaught gifts she possessed, and the
historic record is unimpeached as regards that child of genius, Jeanne
d’Arc.</p>
<p>“Ne me dites jamais cette bête de mot, impossible,” said Napoleon: it
is indeed a stupid word where genius is concerned.</p>
<p>If intellectual “miracles” were impossible to genius, even Bacon
could not have been and done all that he was and did, and also the
author of the Shakespearean plays and poems; even Ben could not have
been the scholar that he was. For the rest, I need not return on my
tracks and explain once more such shallow mysteries as the “Silence of
Philip Henslowe,” and the lack of literary anecdotage about Shakespeare
in a stupendously illiterate country town. Had Will, not Ben, visited
Drummond of Hawthornden, we should have matter enough of the kind
desired.</p>
<p>“We have the epics of Homer,” people say, “what matters it whether
they be by a Man, or by a Syndicate that was in business through seven
centuries? We have the plays of Shakespeare, what matters it whether he,
or Bacon, or X. were, in the main, the author?”</p>
<p>It matters to us, if we hold such doubts to be fantastic pedantries,
such guesses contrary to the nature of things; while we wish to give
love and praise and gratitude where they are due; to that Achæan “Father
of the rest”; and to “friendly Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>APPENDICES</p>
<p>APPENDIX I. “TROILUS AND CRESSIDA”</p>
<p>To myself Troilus and Cressida is, with Henry VI, Part I, the most
mysterious among the Shakespearean plays. Here we find, if Will wrote
it, or had any hand in it, the greatest poet of the modern world in
touch with the heroes of the greatest poet of the ancient world; but the
English author’s eyes are dimmed by the mists and dust of post-Homeric
perversions of the Tale of Troy. The work of perversion began, we know,
in the eighth century before our era, when, by the author of the Cypria,
these favourite heroes of Homer, Odysseus and Diomede, were represented
as scoundrels, assassins, and cowards.</p>
<p>In the Prologue to the play (whosoever wrote it) we see that the
writer is no scholar. He makes the Achæan fleet muster in “the port of
Athens,” of all places. Even Ovid gave the Homeric trysting-place,
Aulis, in Bœotia. (This Prologue is not in the Folio of 1623.) Six gates
hath the Englishman’s Troy, and the Scæan is not one of them.</p>
<p>The loves of Troilus and Cressida, with Pandarus as go-between, are
from the mediæval Troy books, and were wholly unknown to Homer, whose
Pandarus is only notable for loosing a traitor’s shaft at Menelaus, in
time of truce, and for his death at the hand of Diomede. The play begins
after the duel (Iliad, III) between Paris and Menelaus: in the play, not
in Homer, Paris “retires hurt,” as is at first reported. Hector has a
special grudge against the Telamonian Aias. As in the Iliad there is a
view of the Achæans, taken from the walls by Priam and Helen; so, in the
play, Pandarus and Cressida review the Trojans re-entering the city.
Paris turns out not to be hurt after all.</p>
<p>In Act i. Scene 3, the Achæans hold council, and regret the
disaffection of Achilles. Here comes Ulysses’ great speech on
discipline, in armies, and in states, the gradations of rank and duty;
commonly thought to be a leaf in Shakespeare’s crown of bays. The
speeches of Agamemnon and Nestor are dignified; indeed the poet treats
Agamemnon much more kindly than Homer is wont to do. But the poet
represents Achilles as laughing in his quarters at Patroclus’s imitation
of the cough and other infirmities of old Nestor, to which Homer,
naturally, never alludes. Throughout, the English poet regards Achilles
with the eyes of his most infamous late Greek and ignorant mediæval
detractors. The Homeric sequence of events is so far preserved that, on
the day of the duel between Paris and Menelaus, comes (through Æneas)
the challenge by Hector to fight any Greek in “gentle and joyous passage
of arms” (Iliad, VII). As in the Iliad, the Greeks decide by lot who is
to oppose Hector; but by the contrivance of Odysseus (not by chance, as
in Homer) the lot falls on Aias. In the Iliad Aias is as strong and
sympathetic as Porthos in Les Trois Mousquetaires. The play makes him as
great an eater of beef, and as stupid as Sir Andrew Aguecheek. Achilles,
save in a passage quite out of accord with the rest of the piece, is
nearly as dull as Aias, is discourteous, and is cowardly! No poet and no
scholar who knew Homer’s heroes in Homer’s Greek, could thus degrade
them; and the whole of the revilings of Thersites are loathsome in their
profusion of filthy thoughts. It does not follow that Will did not write
the part of Thersites. Some of the most beautiful and Shakespearean
pieces of verse adorn the play; one would say that no man but Will could
have written them. Troilus and Cressida, at first, appear “to dally with
the innocence of love”; and nothing can be nobler and more dramatic than
the lines in which Cressida, compelled to go to her father, Calchas, in
the Greek camp, in exchange for Antenor, professes her loyalty in love.
But the Homeric and the alien later elements, — the story of false love,
— cannot be successfully combined. The poet, whoever he was, appears to
weary and to break down. He ends, indeed, as the Iliad ends, with the
death of Hector, but Hector, in the play, is murdered, while resting
unarmed, without shield and helmet, after stripping a suit of sumptuous
mail from a nameless runaway. In the play he has slain Patroclus, but
has not stripped him of the armour of Achilles, which, in Homer, he is
wearing. Achilles then meets Hector, but far from rushing to avenge on
him Patroclus, he retires like a coward, musters his men, and makes them
surround and slay the defenceless Hector.</p>
<p>Cressida, who is sent to her father Calchas, in the Greek camp, in a
day becomes “the sluttish spoil of opportunity,” and of Diomede, and the
comedy praised by the preface-writer of a quarto of 1609, is a squalid
tragedy reeking of Thersites and Pandarus, of a light o’ love, and the
base victory of cruel cowardice over knightly Hector. Yet there seemed
to be muffled notes from the music, and broken lights from the splendour
of Homer. When Achilles eyes Hector all over, during a truce, and
insultingly says that he is thinking in what part of his body he shall
drive the spear, we are reminded of Iliad, XXII, 320–326, where Achilles
searches his own armour, worn by Patroclus, stripped by Hector from him,
and worn by Hector, for a chink in the mail. Yet, after all, these
points are taken, not from the Iliad, but from Caxton’s popular Troy
Book.</p>
<p>Once more, when Hector is dead, and Achilles bids his men to</p>
<p>“cry amain,</p>
<p>Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain,”</p>
<p>we think of Iliad, XXII, 390–393, where Achilles commands the
Myrmidons to go singing the pæan</p>
<p>“Glory have we won, we have slain great Hector!”</p>
<p>The sumptuous armour stripped by Hector from a nameless man, recalls
his winning of the arms of Achilles from Patroclus. But, in fact, this
passage is also borrowed, with the murder of Hector, from Caxton, except
as regards the pæan.</p>
<p>It may be worth noting that Chapman’s first instalment of his
translation of the Iliad, containing Books I, II, and VII–XI, appeared
in 1598, and thence the author could adapt the passages from Iliad, Book
VII. In or about 1598–9 occurred, in Histriomastix, by Marston and
others, a burlesque speech in which Troilus, addressing Cressida, speaks
of “thy knight,” who “Shakes his furious Speare,” while in April 1599,
Henslowe’s account-book contains entries of money paid to Dekker and
Chettle for a play on Troilus and Cressida, for the Earl of Nottingham’s
Company. Of this play no more is known, nor can we be sure that
Chapman’s seven Books of the Iliad (I, II, VII–XI) of 1598 attracted the
attention of playwrights, from Shakespeare to Chettle and Dekker, to
Trojan affairs. The coincidences at least are curious. If “Shakes his
furious Speare” in Histriomastix refers to Shakespeare in connection
with Cressida, while, in 1599, Dekker and Chettle were doing a Troilus
and Cressida for a company not Shakespeare’s, then there were two
Troilus and Cressida in the field. A licence to print a Troilus and
Cressida was obtained in 1602–3, but the quarto of our play, the
Shakespearean play, is of 1609, “as it is acted by my Lord Chamberlain’s
men,” that is, by Shakespeare’s Company. Now Dekker and Chettle wrote,
apparently, for Lord Nottingham’s Company. One quarto of 1609 declares,
in a Preface, that the play has “never been staled with the stage”;
another edition of the same year, from the same publishers, has not the
Preface, but declares that the piece “was acted by the King’s Majesty’s
servants at the Globe.” The author of the Preface (Ben Jonson,
Mr. Greenwood thinks, ) speaks only of a single author, who has written
other admirable comedies. “When he is gone, and his comedies out of
sale, you will scramble for them, and set up a new English Inquisition.”
Why? The whole affair is a puzzle. But if the author of the Preface is
right about the single author of Troilus and Cressida, and if
Shakespeare is alluded to in connection with Cressida, in Histriomastix
(1599), then it appears to me that Shakespeare, in 1598–9, after
Chapman’s portion of the Iliad appeared, was author of one Troilus and
Cressida, extant in 1602–3 (when its publication was barred till the
publisher “got authority”), while Chettle and Dekker, in April 1599,
were busy with another Troilus and Cressida, as why should they not be?
In an age so lax about copyright, if their play was of their own
original making, are we to suppose that there was copyright in the names
of the leading persons of the piece, Troilus and Cressida?</p>
<p>Perhaps not: but meanwhile Mr. Greenwood cites Judge Stotsenburg’s
opinion that Henslowe’s entries of April 1599 “refute the Shakespearean
claim to the authorship of Troilus and Cressida,” which exhibits “the
collaboration of two men,” as “leading commentators” hold that it does.
But the learned Judge mentions as a conceivable alternative that “there
were two plays on the subject with the same name,” and, really, it looks
as if there were! The Judge does not agree “with Webb and other gifted
writers that Bacon wrote this play.” So far the Court is quite with him.
He goes on however, “It was, in my opinion, based on the foregoing
facts, originally the production of Dekker and Chettle, added to and
philosophically dressed by Francis Bacon.” But, according to
Mr. Greenwood, “it is admitted not only that the different writing of
two authors is apparent in the Folio play, but also that ‘Shakespeare’
must have had at least some share in a play of Troilus and Cressida as
early as the very year 1599, in the spring of which Dekker and Chettle
are found engaged in writing their play of that name,” on the evidence
of Histriomastix. How that evidence proves that “a play of Troilus and
Cressida had been published as by ‘Shakespeare’ about 1599,” I know not.
Perhaps “published” means “acted”? “And it is not unreasonable to
suppose that this play” (“published as by Shakespeare”) “was the one to
which Henslowe alludes” — as being written in April 1599, by Dekker and
Chettle.</p>
<p>If so, the play must show the hands of three, not two, men, Dekker,
Chettle, and “Shakespeare,” the Great Unknown, or Bacon. He collaborates
with Dekker and Chettle, in a play for Lord Nottingham’s men (according
to Sir Sidney Lee), but it is, later at least, played by Shakespeare’s
company; and perhaps Bacon gets none of the £4 paid to Dekker and
Chettle. Henslowe does not record his sale of the Dekker and Chettle
play to Shakespeare’s or to any company or purchaser. Without an entry
of the careful Henslowe recording his receipts for the sale of the
Dekker and Chettle play to any purchaser, it is not easy to see how
Shakespeare’s company procured the manuscript, and thus enabled him to
refashion it. Perhaps no reader will fail to recognise his hand in the
beautiful blank verse of many passages. I am not familiar enough with
the works of Dekker and Chettle to assign to them the less desirable
passages. Thersites is beastly: a Yahoo of Swift’s might poison with
such phrases as his the name and nature of love, loyalty, and military
courage. But whatsoever Shakespeare did, he did thoroughly, and if he
were weary, if man delighted him not, nor woman either, he may have
written the whole piece, in which love perishes for the whim of “a
daughter of the game,” and the knightly Hector is butchered to sate the
vanity of his cowardly Achilles. If Shakespeare read the books
translated by Chapman, he must have read them in the same spirit as
Keats, and was likely to find that the poetry of the Achæan could not be
combined with the Ionian, Athenian, and Roman perversions, as he knew
them in the mediæval books of Troy, in the English of Lydgate and
Caxton. The chivalrous example of Chaucer he did not follow. Probably
Will looked on the play as one of his failures. The Editor, if we can
speak of an Editor, of the Folio clearly thrust the play in late, so
confusedly that it is not paged, and is not mentioned in the table of
the contents.</p>
<p>“The Grand Possessors” of the play referred to in the Preface to one
of the two quartos of 1609 we may suppose to be Shakespeare’s Company.
In this case the owners would not permit the publication of the play if
they could prevent it. The title provokes Mr. Greenwood to say, “Why
these worthies should be so styled is not apparent; indeed the
supposition seems not a little ridiculous.” Of course, if the players
were the possessors, “grand” is merely a jeer, by a person advertising a
successful piracy. And in regard to Tieck’s conjecture that James I is
alluded to as “the grand possessor, for whom the play was expressly
written,” the autocratic James was very capable of protecting himself
against larcenous publishers.</p>
<p>APPENDIX II. CHETTLE’S SUPPOSED ALLUSION TO WILL SHAKSPERE</p>
<p>In discussing contemporary allusions to William Shakspere or
Shakespeare (or however you spell the name), I have not relied on
Chettle’s remarks (in Kind-Hart’s Dreame, 1592) concerning Greene’s
Groatsworth of Wit. Chettle speaks of it, saying, “in which a letter,
written to divers play-makers, is offensively by one or two of them
taken.” It appears that by “one or two” Chettle means two. “With neither
of them that take offence was I acquainted” (at the time when he edited
the Groatsworth), “and with one of them I care not if I never be.” We do
not know who “the Gentlemen his Quondam acquaintance,” addressed by
Greene, were. They are usually supposed to have been Marlowe, Peele, and
Lodge, or Nash. We do not know which of the two who take offence is the
man with whom Chettle did not care to be acquainted. Of “the other,”
according to Chettle, “myself have seen his demeanour no less civil than
he is excellent in the quality he professes” (that is, “in his
profession,” as we say), “besides divers of worship have reported his
uprightness of dealing, which argues his honesty; and his facetious
grace in writing that approves his art.”</p>
<p>Speaking from his own observation, Chettle avers that the person of
whom he speaks is civil in his demeanour, and (apparently) that he is
“excellent in the quality he professes” — in his profession. Speaking on
the evidence of “divers of worship,” the same man is said to possess
“facetious grace in writing.” Had his writings been then published,
Chettle, a bookish man, would have read them and formed his own opinion.
Works of Lodge, Peele, and Marlowe had been published. Writing is not
“the quality he professes,” is not the “profession” of the man to whom
Chettle refers. On the other hand, the profession of Greene’s “Quondam
acquaintance” was writing, “they spend their wits in making Plays.” Thus
the man who wrote, but whose profession was not that of writing, does
not, so far, appear to have been one of those addressed by Greene. It
seems undeniable that Greene addresses gentlemen who are “playmakers,”
who “spend their wits in making Plays,” and who are not actors; for
Greene’s purpose is to warn them against the rich, ungrateful actors. If
Greene’s friends, at the moment when he wrote, were, or if any one of
them then was, by profession an actor, Greene’s warning to him against
actors, directed to an actor, is not, to me, intelligible. But
Mr. Greenwood writes, “As I have shown, George Peele was one of the
playwrights addressed by Greene, and Peele was a successful player as
well as playwright, and might quite truly have been alluded to both as
having ‘facetious grace in writing,’ and being ‘excellent in the quality
he professed,’ that is, as a professional actor.”</p>
<p>I confess that I did not know that George Peele, M.A., of Oxford, had
ever been a player, and a successful player. But one may ask, — in 1592
did George Peele “profess the quality” of an actor; was he then a
professional actor, and only an occasional playwright? If so, I am not
apt to believe that Greene seriously advised him not to put faith in the
members of his own profession. From them, as a successful member of
their profession (a profession which, as Greene complains, “exploited”
dramatic authors), Peele stood in no danger. Thus I do not see how
Chettle’s professional actor, reported to have facetious grace in
writing, can be identified with Peele. The identification seems to me
impossible. Peele and Marlowe, in 1592, were literary gentlemen; Lodge,
in 1592, was filibustering, though a literary man; he had not yet become
a physician. In 1592, none of the three had any profession but that of
literature, so far as I am aware. The man who had a special profession,
and also wrote, was not one of these three; nor was he Tom Nash, a mere
literary gentleman, pamphleteer and playwright.</p>
<p>I do not know the name of any one of the three to whom Greene
addressed the Groatsworth, though the atheistic writer of tragedies
seems meant, and disgracefully meant, for Marlowe. I only know that
Chettle is expressing his regrets for Greene’s language to some one whom
he applauded as to his exercise of his profession; and who, according to
“divers of worship,” had also “facetious grace in writing.” “Myself have
seen him no less civil than he is excellent in the quality he
professes”; whether or not this means that Chettle has seen his
excellence in his profession, I cannot tell for certain; but Chettle’s
remark is, at least, contrasted with what he gives merely from report—
“the facetious grace in writing” of the man in question. His writing is
not part of his profession, so he is not, in 1592 (I conceive), Lodge,
Peele, Marlowe, or Nash.</p>
<p>Who, then, is this mysterious personage? Malone, Dyce, Steevens,
Collier, Halliwell-Phillipps, Knight, Sir Sidney Lee, Messrs. Gosse and
Garnett, and Mr. J. C. Collins say that he is Will Shakspere. But
Mr. Fleay and Mr. Castle, whose “mind” is “legal,” have pointed out that
this weird being cannot be Shake-scene (or Shakspere, if Greene meant
Shakspere), attacked by Greene. For Chettle says that in the Groatsworth
of Wit “a letter, written to divers play-makers, is offensively by one
or two of them taken.” The mysterious one is, therefore, one of the
playwrights addressed by Greene. Consequently all the followers of
Malone, who wrote before Messrs. Fleay and Castle, are mistaken; and
what Mr. Greenwood has to say about Sir Sidney Lee, J. C. Collins, and
Dr. Garnett, and Mr. Gosse, in the way of moral reprobation, may be read
by the curious in his pages.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if we take Chettle to have been a strict grammarian, by
his words— “a letter, written to divers play-makers, is offensively by
one or two of them taken,” Will is excluded; the letter was most
assuredly not written to him. But I, whose mind is not legal, am not
certain that Chettle does not mean that the letter, written to divers
play-makers, was by one or two makers of plays offensively taken.</p>
<p>This opinion seems the less improbable, as the person to whom Chettle
is most apologetic excels in a quality or profession, which is
contrasted with, and is not identical with, “his facetious grace in
writing” — a parergon, or “ bye-work,” in his case. Whoever this person
was, he certainly was not Marlowe, Peele, Lodge, or Nash. We must look
for some other person who had a profession, and also was reported to
have facetious grace in writing.</p>
<p>If Chettle is to be held tight to grammar, Greene referred to some
one unknown, some one who wrote for the stage, but had another
profession. If Chettle is not to be thus tautly construed, I confess
that to myself he seems to have had Shakspere, even Will, in his mind.
For Will in 1592 had “a quality which he professed,” that of an actor;
and also (I conceive) was reported to have “ facetious grace in
writing.” But other gentlemen may have combined these attributes;
wherefore I lay no stress on the statements of Chettle, as if they
referred to our Will Shakspere.</p>
<h2 id="forty-years-of-bacon-shakespeare-folly-by-john-fiske">Forty
Years of Bacon-Shakespeare Folly by John Fiske</h2>
<p>From ‘A Century of Science and Other Essays’</p>
<p>Some time ago, while I happened to be looking over a wheelbarrow-load
of rubbish written to prove that such plays as “King Lear” and “The
Merry Wives of Windsor” emanated from one of the least poetical and
least humorous minds of modern times, I was reminded of a story which I
heard when a boy. I forget whether it was some whimsical man of letters
like Charles Lamb, or some such professional wag as Theodore Hook, who
took it into his head one day to stand still on a London street, with
face turned upward, gazing into the sky. Thereupon the next person who
came that way forthwith stopped and did likewise, and then the next, and
the next, until the road was blocked by a dense crowd of men and women,
all standing as if rooted in the ground, and with solemn sky-ward stare.
The enchantment was at last broken when some one asked what they were
looking at, and nobody could tell. It was simply an instance of a
certain remnant of primitive gregariousness of action on the part of
human beings, which exhibits itself from time to time in sundry queer
fashions and fads.</p>
<p>So when Miss Delia Bacon, in the year which saw the beginning of “The
Atlantic Monthly,” published a book purporting to unfold the
“philosophy” of Shakespeare’s dramas, it was not long before other
persons began staring intently into the silliest mare’s nest ever
devised by human dulness; and the fruits of so much staring have
appeared in divers eccentric volumes, of which more specific mention
will presently be made. Neither in number nor in quality are they such
as to indicate that the Bacon-Shakespeare folly has yet become
fashionable, and we shall presently observe in it marked suicidal
tendencies which are likely to prevent its ever becoming so; but there
are enough of such volumes to illustrate the point of my anecdote.</p>
<p>Another fad, once really fashionable, and in defence of which some
plausible arguments could be urged, was the Wolfian theory of the
Homeric poems, which dazzled so many of our grandparents. It is worth
our while to mention it here by way of prelude. The theory that the
Iliad and Odyssey are mere aggregations of popular ballads, collected
and arranged in the time of Pisistratus, was perhaps originally
suggested by the philosopher Vico, but first attracted general attention
in 1795, when set forth by Friedrich August Wolf, one of the most
learned and brilliant of modern scholars. Thus eminently respectable in
its parentage and quite reasonable on the surface, this ballad theory
came to be widely fashionable; forty years ago it was accepted by many
able scholars, though usually with large modifications.</p>
<p>The Wolfians urged that we know absolutely nothing about the man
Homer, not even when or where he lived. His existence is merely matter
of tradition, or of inference from the existence of the poems. But as
the poems know nothing of Dorians in Peloponnesus, their date can hardly
be so late as 1100 b. c. What happened, then, when “an edition of Homer”
was made at Athens, about 530 b. c., by Pisistratus, or under his
orders? Did the editor simply edit two great poems already six centuries
old, or did he make up two poems by piecing together a miscellaneous lot
of ancient ballads? Wolf maintained the latter alternative, chiefly
because of the alleged impossibility of composing and preserving such
long poems in the alleged absence of the art of writing. Having thus
made a plausible start, the Wolfians proceeded to pick the poems to
pieces, and to prove by “internal evidence” that there was nothing like
“unity of design” in them, etc.; and so it went on, till poor old Homer
was relegated to the world of myth. As a schoolboy I used to hear the
belief in the existence of such a poet derided as “uncritical” and
“unscholarly.”</p>
<p>In spite of these terrifying epithets, the ballad theory never made
any impression upon me; for it seemed to ignore the most conspicuous and
vital fact about the poems, namely, the style, the noble, rapid, simple,
vivid, supremely poetical style, — a style as individual and
unapproachable as that of Dante or Keats. For an excellent
characterization of it, read Matthew Arnold’s charming essays “On
Translating Homer.” The style is the man, and to suppose that this
Homeric style ever came from a democratic multitude of minds, or from
anything save one of those supremely endowed individual natures such as
get born once or twice in a millennium, is simply to suppose a
psychological impossibility. I remember once talking about this with
George Eliot, who had lately been reading Frederick Paley’s ingenious
restatement of the ballad theory, and was captivated by its ingenuity. I
told her I did not wonder that old dry-as-dust philologists should hold
such views, but I was indeed surprised to find such a literary artist as
herself ignoring the impassable gulf between Homer’s language and that
which any ballad theory necessarily implies. She had no answer for this
except to say that she should have supposed an evolutionist like me
would prefer to regard the Homeric poems as gradually evolved rather
than suddenly created! A retort so clever and amiable most surely
entitled her to the woman’s privilege of the last word.</p>
<p>The Wolfian theory may now be regarded as a thing of the past; it has
had its day and been flung aside. If Wolf himself were living, he would
be the first to laugh at it. Its original prop has been knocked away,
since it has become pretty clear that the art of writing was practised
about the shores of the Ægean Sea long before 1100 b. c. Even Wolf would
now admit that it might have been a real letter that Bellerophon carried
to the father of Anteia. All attempts to show a lack of unity in the
design of the Iliad and the Odyssey have failed irretrievably, and the
discussion has served only to make more and more unmistakable the work
of the mighty master. The ballad theory is dead and buried, and he who
would read its obituary may find keen pleasure, as well as many a
wholesome lesson in sound criticism, in the sensible and brilliant book
by Andrew Lang on “Homer and the Epic.”</p>
<p>The Bacon-Shakespeare folly has never been set forth by scholars of
commanding authority, like Wolf and Lachmann, or Niese and Wilamowitz
Moellendorff. Among Delia Bacon’s followers not one can by any
permissible laxity of speech be termed a scholar, and their theory has
found acceptance with very few persons. Nevertheless, it illustrates as
well as the Wolfian theory the way in which such notions grow. It starts
from a false premise, hazily conceived, and it subsists upon arguments
in which trivial facts are assigned higher value than facts of vital
importance. Mr. Lang’s remark upon certain learned Homeric commentators,
“that they pore over the hyssop on the wall, but are blind to the cedar
of Lebanon,” applies with tenfold force to the Bacon-Shakespeare
sciolists. In them we always miss the just sense of proportion which is
one of the abiding marks of sanity. The unfortunate lady who first
brought their theory into public notoriety in 1857 was then sinking
under the cerebral disease of which she died two years later, and her
imitators have been chiefly weak minds of the sort that thrive upon
paradox, closely akin to the circle-squarers and inventors of perpetual
motion. Underlying all the absurdities, however, there is something that
deserves attention. Like many other morbid phenomena, the
Bacon-Shakespeare folly has its natural history which is instructive.
The vagaries of Delia Bacon and her followers originated in a group of
conditions which admit of being specified and described, and which the
historian of nineteenth-century literature will need to notice. In order
to understand the natural history of the affair, it is necessary to
examine the Delia Bacon theory at greater length than it would otherwise
deserve. Let us see how it is constructed.</p>
<p>It starts with a syllogism, of which the major premise is that the
dramas ascribed to Shakespeare during his lifetime, and ever since
believed to be his, abound in evidences of extraordinary book-learning.
The minor premise is that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon could
not have acquired or possessed so much book-learning. The conclusion is
that he could not have written those plays.</p>
<p>The question then arises, Which of Shakespeare’s contemporaries had
enough book-lore to have written them? No doubt Francis Bacon had
enough. The conclusion does not follow, however, that he wrote the
plays; for there were other contemporaries with learning enough and to
spare, as for example George Chapman and Ben Jonson. These two men, to
judge from their acknowledged works, were great poets, whereas in
Bacon’s fifteen volumes there is not a paragraph which betrays poetical
genius. Why not, then, ascribe the Shakespeare dramas to Chapman or
Jonson? Here the Baconizers endeavour to support their assumption by
calling attention to similarities in thought and phrase between Francis
Bacon and the writer of the dramas. Up to this point their argument
consists of deductions from assumed premises; here they adduce inductive
evidence, such as it is. We shall see specimens of it by and by. At
present we are concerned with the initial syllogism.</p>
<p>And first, as to the major premise, it must be met with a flat
denial. The Shakespeare plays do not abound with evidences of
scholarship or learning of the sort that is gathered from profound and
accurate study of books. It is precisely in this respect that they are
conspicuously different from many of the plays contemporary with them,
and from other masterpieces of English literature. Such plays as
Jonson’s “Sejanus” and “Catiline” are the work of a scholar deeply
indoctrinated with the views and mental habits of classic antiquity; he
has soaked himself in the style of Lucan and Seneca, until their mental
peculiarities have become like a second nature to him, and are
unconsciously betrayed alike in the general handling of his story and in
little turns of expression. Or take Milton’s “Lycidas:” no one but a man
saturated in every fibre with Theocritus and Virgil could have written
such a poem. An extremely foreign and artificial literary form has been
so completely mastered and assimilated by Milton that he uses it with as
much ease as Theocritus himself, and has produced a work that even the
master of idyls had scarcely equalled. After the terrific invective
against the clergy and the beautiful invocation to the flowers, followed
by the triumphant hallelujah of Christian faith, observe the sudden
reversion to pagan sentiment where Lycidas is addressed as the genius of
the shore. Only profound scholarship could have written this wonderful
poem, — could have brought forth the Christian thought as if
spontaneously through the medium of the pagan form. Now there is nothing
of this sort in Shakespeare. He uses classical materials, or anything
else under the sun that suits his purpose. He takes a chronicle from
Holinshed, a biography from North’s translation of Plutarch, a legend
from Saxo Grammaticus through Belleforest’s French version, a novel of
Boccaccio, a miracle play, — whatever strikes his fancy; he chops up his
materials and weaves them into a story without much regard to classical
models; defying rules of order and unity, and not always heeding
probability, but never forgetful of his abiding purpose, to create live
men and women. These people may have Greek or Latin names, and their
scene of action may be Rome or Mitylene, decorated with scraps of
classical knowledge such as a bright man might pick up in miscellaneous
reading; but all this is the superficial setting, the mere frame to the
picture. The living canvas is human nature as Shakespeare saw it in
London and depicted with supreme poetic faculty. Among the new books
within his reach was Chapman’s magnificent translation of the Iliad,
which at a later day inspired Keats to such a noble outburst of
encomium; and in “Troilus and Cressida” we have the Greek and Trojan
heroes set before us with an incisive reality not surpassed by Homer
himself. This play shows how keenly Shakespeare appreciated Homer, how
delicately and exquisitely he could supplement the picture; but there is
nothing in its five acts that shows him clothed in the garment of
ancient thought as Milton wore it. Shakespeare’s freedom from such lore
is a great advantage to him; in “Troilus and Cressida” there is a
freedom of treatment hardly possible to a professional scholar. It is
because of this freedom that Shakespeare reaches a far wider public of
readers and listeners than Milton or Dante, whose vast learning makes
them in many places “caviare to the general.” Book-lore is a great
source of power, but one may easily be hampered by it. What we forever
love in Homer is the freshness that comes with lack of it, and in this
sort of freshness Shakespeare agrees with Homer far more than with the
learned poets.</p>
<p>It is not for a moment to be denied that Shakespeare’s plays exhibit
a remarkable wealth of varied knowledge. The writer was one of the
keenest observers that ever lived. In the woodland or on the farm, in
the printing shop or the alehouse, or up and down the street, not the
smallest detail escaped him. Microscopic accuracy, curious interest in
all things, unlimited power of assimilating knowledge, are everywhere
shown in the plays. These are some of the marks of what we call genius,
— something that we are far from comprehending, but which experience has
shown that books and universities cannot impart. All the colleges on
earth could not by combined effort make the kind of man we call a
genius, but such a man may at any moment be born into the world, and it
is as likely to be in a peasant’s cottage as anywhere.</p>
<p>There is nothing in which men differ more widely than in the capacity
for imbibing and assimilating knowledge. The capacity is often exercised
unconsciously. When my eldest son, at the age of six, was taught to read
in the course of a few weeks of daily instruction, it was suddenly
discovered that his four-year-old brother also could read. Nobody could
tell how it happened. Of course the younger boy must have taken keen
notice of what the elder one was doing, but the process went on without
attracting attention until the result appeared.</p>
<p>This capacity for unconscious learning is not at all uncommon. It is
possessed to some extent by everybody; but a very high degree of it is
one of the marks of genius. I remember one evening, many years ago,
hearing Herbert Spencer in a friendly discussion regarding certain
functions of the cerebellum. Abstruse points of comparative anatomy and
questions of pathology were involved. Spencer’s three antagonists were
not violently opposed to him, but were in various degrees unready to
adopt his views. The three were: Huxley, one of the greatest of
comparative anatomists; Hughlings Jackson, a very eminent authority on
the pathology of the nervous system; and George Henry Lewes, who,
although more of an amateur in such matters, had nevertheless devoted
years of study to neural physiology, and was thoroughly familiar with
the history of the subject. Spencer more than held his ground against
the others. He met fact with fact, brought up points in anatomy the
significance of which Huxley confessed that he had overlooked, and had
more experiments and clinical cases at his tongue’s end than Jackson
could muster. It was quite evident that he knew all they knew on the
subject, and more besides. Yet Spencer had never been through a course
of “regular training” in the studies concerned; nor had he ever studied
at a university, or even at a high school. Where did he learn the
wonderful mass of facts which he poured forth that evening? Whence came
his tremendous grasp upon the principles involved? Probably he could not
have told you. A few days afterward I happened to be talking with
Spencer about history, a subject of which he modestly said he knew but
little. I told him I had often been struck with the aptness of the
historic illustrations cited in many chapters of his “Social Statics,”
written when he was twenty-nine years old. The references were not only
always accurate, but they showed an intelligence and soundness of
judgment unattainable, one would think, save by close familiarity with
history. Spencer assured me that he had never read extensively in
history. Whence, then, this wealth of knowledge, — not smattering, not
sciolism, but solid, well-digested knowledge? Really, he did not know,
except that when his interest was aroused in any subject he was keenly
alive to all facts bearing upon it, and seemed to find them whichever
way he turned. When I mentioned this to Lewes, while recalling the
discussion on the cerebellum, he exclaimed: “Oh, you can’t account for
it! It’s his genius. Spencer has greater instinctive power of
observation and assimilation than any man since Shakespeare, and he is
like Shakespeare for hitting the bull’s-eye every time he fires. As for
Darwin and Huxley, we can follow their intellectual processes, but
Spencer is above and beyond all; he is inspired!”</p>
<p>Those were Lewes’s exact words, and they made a deep impression upon
me. The comparison with Shakespeare struck me as a happy one, and I can
understand both Spencer and Shakespeare the better for it. Concerning
Spencer one circumstance may be observed. Since his early manhood he has
lived in London, and has had for his daily associates men of vast
attainments in every department of science. He has thus had rare
opportunities for absorbing an immense fund of knowledge
unconsciously.</p>
<p>It is evident that the author of Shakespeare’s plays possessed an
extraordinary “instinctive power of observation and assimilation.” There
was nothing strange in such a genius growing up in a small Warwickshire
town. The difficulty is one which the Delia-Baconians have created for
themselves. As it is their chief stock in trade, they magnify it in
every way they can think of. Shakespeare’s parents, they say, were
illiterate, and he did not know how to spell his own name. It appears as
Shagspere, Shaxpur, Shaxberd, Chacsper, and so on through some thirty
forms, several of which William Shakespeare himself used indifferently.
The implication is that such a man must have been shockingly ignorant.
The real ignorance, however, is on the part of those who use such an
argument. Apparently, they do not know that in Shakespeare’s time such
laxity in spelling was common in all ranks of society and in all grades
of culture. The name of Elizabeth’s great Lord Treasurer, Cecil, and his
title, Burghley, were both spelled in half a dozen ways. The name of
Raleigh occurs in more than forty different forms, and Sir Walter, one
of the most accomplished men of his time, wrote it Rauley, Rawleyghe,
Ralegh, and in yet other ways. The talk of the Baconizers on this point
is simply ludicrous.</p>
<p>Equally silly is their talk about the dirty streets of Stratford.
They seem to have just discovered that Elizabeth’s England was a badly
drained country, with heaps of garbage in the streets. Shakespeare’s
father, they tell us, was a butcher, and evidently from a butcher’s son,
living in an ill-swept town, and careless about the spelling of his
name, not much in the way of intellectual achievement was to be
expected! In point of fact, Shakespeare’s parents belonged to the middle
class. His father owned several houses in Stratford and two or three
farms in the neighbourhood. As a farmer in those days, he would
naturally have cattle slaughtered on his premises and would sell wool
off the backs of his own flocks, whence the later tradition of his
having been butcher and wool dealer. That his social position was good
is shown by the facts that he was chief alderman and high bailiff of
Stratford, and justice of the peace, and was styled “Master John
Shakespeare,” or (as we should say) “Mr.;” whereas, had he been one of
the common folk, his style had been “Goodman Shakespeare.” A visit to
his home in Henley Street, and to Anne Hathaway’s cottage at Shottery,
shows that the two families were in eminently respectable circumstances.
The son of the high bailiff would see the best people in the
neighbourhood. There was in the town a remarkably good free grammar
school, where he might have learned the “small Latin and less Greek”
which his friend Ben Jonson assures us he possessed. This expression, by
the way, is usually misunderstood, because people do not pause to
consider it. Coming from Ben Jonson, I should say that “small Latin and
less Greek” might fairly describe the amount of those languages
ordinarily possessed by a member of the graduating class at Harvard in
good standing. It can hardly imply less than the ability to read Terence
at sight, and perhaps Euripides less fluently. The author of the plays,
with his unerring accuracy of observation, knows Latin enough at least
to use the Latin part of English most skilfully; at the same time, when
he has occasion to use Greek authors, such as Homer or Plutarch, he
usually prefers an English translation. At all events, Jonson’s remark
informs us that the man whom he addresses as “sweet swan of Avon” knew
some Latin and some Greek, — a conclusion which is so distasteful to one
of our Baconizers, Mr. Edwin Reed, that he will not admit it. Rather
than do so, he has the assurance to ask us to believe that by the
epithet “sweet swan of Avon” Jonson really meant Francis Bacon! Dear me,
Mr. Reed, do you really mean it? And how about the editor of Beaumont
and Fletcher in 1647, when, in his dedication to Shakespeare’s friend
the Earl of Pembroke, he speaks of “Sweet Swan of Avon Shakespear”? Was
he too a participator in the little scheme for fooling posterity? Or was
he one of those who were fooled?</p>
<p>Whether Shakespeare had other chances for book-lore than those which
the grammar school afforded, whether there was any interesting parson at
hand, as often in small towns, to guide and stimulate his unfolding
thoughts, — upon such points we have no information. But there were
things to be learned in the country town quite outside of books and
pedagogues. There, while the poet listened to the “strain of strutting
chanticleer,” and watched the “sun-burn’d sicklemen, of August weary,”
putting on their rye-straw hats and making holiday with rustic nymphs,
he could rejoice in</p>
<p>“Earth’s increase, foison plenty, Barns and garners never empty;
Vines with clust’ring bunches growing; Plants with goodly burthen
bowing;”</p>
<p>there he could see the “unbacked colts” prick their ears, advance
their eyelids, lift up their noses, as if they smelt music; there he
knew, doubtless, many a bank where the wild thyme grew and on which the
moonlight sweetly slept; there he watched the coming of “violets dim,”
“pale primroses,” flower-de-luce, carnations, with “rosemary and rue” to
keep their “savour all the winter long,”</p>
<p>“When icicles hang by the wall, And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
And Tom bears logs into the hall, And milk comes frozen home in
pail.”</p>
<p>Such lore as this no books or college could impart.</p>
<p>It was this that Milton had in mind when he introduced Shakespeare
and Ben Jonson into his poem “L’Allegro.” Milton was in his thirtieth
year when Jonson, poet laureate, was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey;
he was only a boy of eight years when Shakespeare died, but the
beautiful sonnet written fourteen years later shows how lovingly he
studied his works: —</p>
<p>“What needs my Shakespeare, for his honoured bones,” etc.</p>
<p>The poem “L’Allegro” and its fellow “Il Penseroso” describe the
delights of Milton’s life at his father’s country house near Windsor
Castle. He used often to ride into London to hear music or pass an
evening at the theatre, as in the following lines: —</p>
<p>“Then to the well-trod stage anon, If Jonson’s learned sock be on, Or
sweetest Shakespeare, fancy’s child, Warble his native woodnotes
wild.”</p>
<p>This accurate and happy contrast exasperates the Baconizers, for it
spoils their stock in trade, and accordingly they try their best to
assure us that Milton did not know what he was writing about. They
asseverate with vehemence that in all the seven-and-thirty plays there
is no such thing as a native woodnote wild.</p>
<p>But before leaving the contrast we may pause for a moment to ask,
Where did Ben Jonson get his learning? He was, as he himself tells us,
“poorly brought up” by his stepfather, a bricklayer. He went to
Westminster School, where he was taught by Camden, and he may have spent
a short time at Cambridge, though this is doubtful. His schooling was
nipped in the bud, for he had to go home and lay brick; and when he
found such an existence insupportable he went into the army and fought
in the Netherlands. At about the age of twenty we find him back in
London, and there lose sight of him for five years, when all at once his
great comedy “Every Man in his Humour” is performed, and makes him
famous. Now, in such a life, when did Jonson get the time for his
immense reading and his finished classical scholarship? Reasoning after
the manner of the Delia-Baconians, we may safely say that he could not
possibly have accumulated the learning which is shown in his plays:
therefore he could not have written those plays; therefore Lord Bacon
must have written them! There are daring soarers in the empyrean who do
not shrink from this conclusion; a doctor in Michigan, named Owen, has
published a pamphlet to prove, among other things, that Bacon was the
author of the plays which were performed and printed as Jonson’s.</p>
<p>To return to Shakespeare. Somewhere about 1585, when he was
one-and-twenty, he went to London, leaving his wife and three young
children at Stratford. His father had lost money, and the fortunes of
the family were at the lowest ebb. In London we lose sight of
Shakespeare for a while, just as we lose sight of Jonson, until literary
works appear. The work first published is “Venus and Adonis,” one of the
most exquisite pieces of diction in the English language. It was
dedicated to Henry, Earl of Southampton, by William Shakespeare, whose
authorship of the poem is asserted as distinctly as the title-page of
“David Copperfield” proclaims that novel to be by Charles Dickens, yet
some precious critics assure us that Shakespeare “could not” have
written the poem, and never knew the Earl of Southampton. Some years
ago, Mr. Appleton Morgan, who does not wish to be regarded as a
Baconizer, published an essay on the Warwickshire dialect, in which he
maintained that since no traces of that kind of speech occur in “Venus
and Adonis,” therefore it could not have been written by a young man
fresh from a small Warwickshire town. This is a specimen of the loose
kind of criticism which prepares soil for Delia-Baconian weeds to grow
in. The poem was published in 1593, seven or eight years after
Shakespeare’s coming to London; and we are asked to believe that the
world’s greatest genius, one of the most consummate masters of speech
that ever lived, could tarry seven years in the city without learning
how to write what Hosea Biglow calls “citified English”! One can only
exclaim with Gloster, “O monstrous fault, to harbour such a
thought!”</p>
<p>In those years Shakespeare surely learned much else. It seems clear
that he had a good reading acquaintance with French and Italian, though
he often uses translations, as for instance Florio’s version of
Montaigne. In estimating what Shakespeare “must have” known or “could
not have” known, one needs to use more caution than some of our critics
display. For example, in “The Winter’s Tale” the statue of Hermione is
called “a piece … now newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio
Romano.” Now, since Romano is known as a great painter, but not as a
sculptor, this has been cited as a blunder on Shakespeare’s part. It
appears, however, that the first edition of Vasari’s “Lives of the
Painters,” published in 1550 and never translated from its original
Italian, informs us that Romano did work in sculpture. In Vasari’s
second edition, published in 1568 and translated into several languages,
this information is not given. From these facts, the erudite German
critic Dr. Karl Elze, who is not a bit of a Delia-Baconian, but only an
occasional sufferer from vesania commentatorum, introduces us to a
solemn dilemma: either the author of “The Winter’s Tale” must have
consulted the first edition of Vasari in the original Italian, or else
he must have travelled in Italy and gazed upon statues by Romano. Ah!
prithee not so fast, worthy doctor; be not so lavish with these “musts.”
It is, I think, improbable that Shakespeare ever saw Italy except with
the eyes of his imperial fancy. On the other hand, there are many
indications that he could read Italian, but among them we cannot attach
much importance to this one. Why should he not have learned from hearsay
that Romano had made statues? In the name of common sense, are there no
sources of knowledge save books? Or, since it was no unusual thing for
Italian painters in the sixteenth century to excel in sculpture and
architecture, why should not Shakespeare have assumed without
verification that it was so in Romano’s case? It was a tolerably safe
assumption to make, especially in an age utterly careless of historical
accuracy, and in a comedy which provides Bohemia with a sea-coast, and
mixes up times and customs with as scant heed of probability as a fairy
tale.</p>
<p>In arguing about what Shakespeare “must have” or “could not have”
known, we must not forget that at no time or place since history began
has human thought fermented more briskly than in London while he was
living there. The age of Drake and Raleigh was an age of efflorescence
in dramatic poetry, such as had not been seen in the twenty centuries
since Euripides died. Among Shakespeare’s fellow craftsmen were writers
of such great and varied endowments as Chapman, Marlowe, Greene, Nash,
Peele, Marston, Dekker, Webster, and Cyril Tourneur. During his earlier
years in London, Richard Hooker was master of the Middle Temple, and
there a little later Ford and Beaumont were studying. The erudite Camden
was master of Westminster School; among the lights of the age for legal
learning were Edward Coke and Francis Bacon; at the same time, one might
have met in London the learned architect Inigo Jones and the learned
poet John Donne, both of them excellent classical scholars; there one
would have found the divine poet Edmund Spenser, just come over from
Ireland to see to the publication of his “Faerie Queene;” not long
afterward came John Fletcher from Cambridge, and the acute philosopher
Edward Herbert from Oxford and one and all might listen to the
incomparable table-talk of that giant of scholarship, John Selden. The
delights of the Mermaid Tavern, where these rare wits were wont to
assemble, still live in tradition. As Keats says: —</p>
<p>“Souls of poets dead and gone, What Elysium have ye known, Happy
field or mossy cavern, Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?”</p>
<p>It has always been believed that this place was one of Shakespeare’s
favourite haunts. By common consent of scholars, it has been accepted as
the scene of those contests of wit between Shakespeare and Jonson of
which Fuller tells us when he compares Jonson to a Spanish galleon,
built high with learning, but slow in movement, while he likens
Shakespeare to an English cruiser, less heavily weighted, but apt for
victory because of its nimbleness, — the same kind of contrast, by the
way, as that which occurred to Milton.</p>
<p>But our Baconizing friends will not allow that Shakespeare ever went
to the Mermaid, or knew the people who met there; at least, none but a
few fellow dramatists. We have no documentary proof that he ever met
with Raleigh, or Bacon, or Selden. Let us observe that, while these
sapient critics are in some cases ready to welcome the slightest
circumstantial evidence, there are others in which they will accept
nothing short of absolute demonstration. Did Shakespeare ever see a
maypole? The word occurs just once in his plays, namely, in the
“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” where little Hermia, quarrelling with tall
Helena, calls her a “painted maypole;” but that proves nothing. I am not
aware that there is any absolute documentary proof that Shakespeare ever
set eyes on a maypole. It is nevertheless certain that in England, at
that time, no boy could grow to manhood without seeing many a maypole.
Common sense has some rights which we are bound to respect.</p>
<p>Now, Shakespeare’s London was a small city of from 150,000 to 200,000
souls, or about the size of Providence or Minneapolis at the present
time. In cities of such size, everybody of the slightest eminence is
known all over town, and such persons are sure to be more or less
acquainted with one another; it is a very rare exception when it is not
so. Before his thirtieth year, Shakespeare was well known in London as
an actor, a writer of plays, and the manager of a prominent theatre. It
was in that year that Spenser, in his “Colin Clout’s Come Home Again,”
alluding to Shakespeare under the name of Aëtion, or “eagle-like,” paid
him this compliment: —</p>
<p>“And there, though last, not least, is Aëtion; A gentler shepherd may
nowhere be found; Whose muse, full of high thought’s invention, Doth,
like himself, heroically sound.”</p>
<p>Four years after this, in 1598, Francis Meres published his book
entitled “Palladis Tamia,” a very interesting contribution to literary
history. The author, who had been an instructor in rhetoric in the
University of Oxford, was then living in London, near the Globe Theatre.
In this book Meres tells his readers that “the sweet witty soul of Ovid
lives in mellifluous and honey-tongued Shakespeare; witness his ‘Venus
and Adonis,’ his ‘Lucrece,’ his sugared sonnets among his private
friends, etc…. As Plautus and Seneca are accounted the best for comedy
and tragedy among the Latins, so Shakespeare among the English is the
most excellent in both kinds for the stage: for comedy, witness his
‘Gentlemen of Verona,’ his ‘Errors,’ his ‘Love’s Labour’s Lost,’ his
‘Love’s Labour’s Wonne,’ his ‘Midsummer Night’s Dream,’ and his
‘Merchant of Venice;’ for tragedy, his ‘Richard II.,’ ‘Richard III.,’
‘Henry IV.,’ ‘King John,’ ‘Titus Andronicus,’ and his ‘Romeo and
Juliet.’ As Epius Stolo said that the Muses would speak with Plautus’s
tongue if they would speak Latin, so I say that the Muses would speak
with Shakespeare’s fine filed phrase if they would speak English.” In
other passages Meres mentions Shakespeare’s lyrical quality, for which
he likens him to Pindar and Catullus; and the glory of his style, for
which he places him along with Virgil and Homer. It thus appears that,
at the age of thirty-four, this poet from Stratford was already ranked
by critical scholars by the side of the greatest names of antiquity. Let
me add that the popularity of his plays was making him a somewhat
wealthy man, so that he had relieved his father from pecuniary troubles,
and had just bought for himself the Great House at Stratford where the
last years of his life were spent. His income seems already to have been
equivalent to 0,000 a year in our modern money. His position had come to
be such that he could extend patronage to others. It was in 1598 that
through his influence Ben Jonson obtained, after many rebuffs, his first
hearing before a London audience, when “Every Man in his Humour” was
brought out at Blackfriars Theatre, with Shakespeare acting one of the
parts.</p>
<p>To suppose that such a man as this, in a town the size of
Minneapolis, connected with a principal theatre, writer of the most
popular plays of the day, a poet whom men were already coupling with
Homer and Pindar, — to suppose that such a man was not known to all the
educated people in the town is simply absurd. There were probably very
few men, women, or children in London, between 1595 and 1610, who did
not know who Shakespeare was when he passed them in the street; and as
for such wits as drank ale and sack at the Mermaid, as for Raleigh and
Bacon and Selden and the rest, to suppose that Shakespeare did not know
them well — nay, to suppose that he was not the leading spirit and
brightest wit of those ambrosial nights — is about as sensible as to
suppose that he never saw a maypole.</p>
<p>The facts thus far contemplated point to one conclusion. The son of a
well-to-do magistrate in a small country town is born with a genius
which the world has never seen surpassed. Coming to London at the age of
twenty-one, he achieves such swift success that within thirteen years he
is recognized as one of the chief glories of English literature. During
this time he is living in the midst of such a period of intellectual
ferment as the world has seldom seen, and in a position which
necessarily brings him into frequent contact with all the most
cultivated men. Under such circumstances, there is nothing in the
smallest degree strange or surprising in his acquiring the varied
knowledge which his plays exhibit. The major premise of the
Delia-Baconians has, therefore, nothing in it whatever. It is a mere
bubble, an empty vagary, — only this, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Before leaving this part of the subject, however, there are still one
or two points of interest to be mentioned. Shakespeare shows a fondness
for the use of phrases and illustrations taken from the law; and on such
grounds our Delia-Baconians argue that the plays must have been written
by an eminent lawyer, such as the Lord Chancellor Bacon undoubtedly was.
They feel that this is a great point on their side. One instance, cited
by Nathaniel Holmes and other Baconizers, is the celebrated case of Sir
James Hales, who committed suicide by drowning, and was accordingly
buried at the junction of crossroads, with a stake through his body,
while all his property was forfeited to the Crown. Presently his widow
brought suit for an estate by survivorship in joint-tenancy. Her case
turned upon the question whether the forfeiture occurred during her late
husband’s lifetime: if it did, he left no estate which she could take;
if it did not, she took the estate by survivorship. The lady’s counsel
argued that so long as Sir James was alive he had not been guilty of
suicide, and the instant he died the estate vested in his widow as
joint-tenant. But the opposing counsel argued that the instant Sir James
voluntarily made the fatal plunge, and therefore before the breath had
left his body, the guilt of suicide was incurred and the forfeiture took
place. The court decided in favour of this view, and the widow got
nothing.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that this decision is travestied in the
conversation of the two clowns in “Hamlet” with regard to Ophelia’s
right to Christian burial. The first clown makes precisely the point
upon which the ingenious counsel for the defendant had rested his
argument: “If I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and an act
hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform.” In making
this distinction the counsel had maintained that the second branch, or
the doing, was the only thing for the law to consider. The talk of the
clowns brings out the humour of the case with Shakespeare’s inimitable
lightness of touch.</p>
<p>The report of the Hales case was published in the volume of
“Plowden’s Reports” which was issued in 1578; and Mr. Holmes informs us
that “there is not the slightest ground for a belief, on the facts which
we know, that Shakespeare ever looked into ‘Plowden’s Reports.’” This is
one of the cases where your stern Baconizer will not hear of anything
short of absolute demonstration. Mere considerations of human
probability might disturb the cogency of a neat little pair of
syllogisms: —</p>
<p>(1.) The author of “Hamlet” must have read Plowden. Shakespeare never
read Plowden. Therefore Shakespeare was not the author of “Hamlet.”</p>
<p>(2.) The author of “Hamlet” must have read Plowden. The lawyer,
Bacon, must have read Plowden. Therefore Bacon wrote “Hamlet.”</p>
<p>With regard to the major premise here, one might freely deny it. The
author of “Hamlet” might easily have got all the knowledge involved from
an evening chat with some legal friend at an alehouse. Then as to the
minor premise, what earthly improbability is there in Shakespeare’s
having dipped into Plowden? Can anybody but lawyers or law students
enjoy reading reports of law cases? I remember that, when I was about
ten years old, a favourite book with me was one entitled “Criminal
Trials of All Countries, by a Member of the Philadelphia Bar.” I read it
and read it, until forbidden to read such a gruesome book, and then I
read it all the more. One of the most elaborate reports in it was that
of the famous case of Captain Donellan, tried in 1780 on a charge of
poisoning his wife’s brother, Sir Theodosius Boughton, a dissipated and
diseased young man, who died very suddenly one day. A post-mortem
inspection showed spots in the intestine, which three ordinary country
doctors ascribed to poisoning by laurel water, while Sir John Hunter,
one of the greatest authorities in Europe, testified that they might
equally well have ensued upon death from apoplexy. The judge, Sir
Francis Buller, saw fit, in his charge, to reckon this as the testimony
of three experts against one; and thus the jury were driven to a verdict
of murder, though it was not proved that any murder had been committed.
Captain Donellan, who lived in his brother-in-law’s house, was a man of
blameless life, an amateur chemist, much given to fooling with odorous
liquids and hissing retorts. It was proved that he had been distilling
laurel water, and one or two other suspicious circumstances were
alleged. The whole trial was begun and ended on the same day, the jury
were about twenty minutes in finding the captain guilty, and three days
afterward he was hung. It was a case where reason was submerged and
drowned under a wave of angry prejudice shrieking for a victim.</p>
<p>Now, if I did not forthwith write a play, and take the occasion to
ridicule the judge’s charge to the jury, it was because I could not
write a play, not because I did not fully appreciate the insult to law
and common sense which that unfortunate case involved. In view of this
and other experiences, when I now read a play or a novel that contains
an intelligent allusion to some law case, I am far from feeling driven
to the conclusion that it must have been written by a lord
chancellor.</p>
<p>If Shakespeare’s dramas are proved by such internal evidence to have
been written by a lawyer, that lawyer, by parity of reasoning, could
hardly have been Francis Bacon. For he was preëminently a chancery
lawyer, and chancery phrases are in Shakespeare conspicuously absent.
The word “injunctions” occurs five times in the plays, once perhaps with
a reference to its legal use (“Merchant of Venice,” II. ix.); but
nowhere do we find any exhibition of a knowledge of chancery law. His
allusions to the common law are often very amusing, as when, in “Love’s
Labour’s Lost,” at the end of a brisk punning-match between Boyet and
Maria, he offers to kiss her, laughingly asking for a grant of pasture
on her lips, and she replies, “Not so; my lips are no common, though
several they be.” Again, in “The Comedy of Errors,” “Dromio asserts that
there is no time for a bald man to recover his hair. This having been
written, the law phrase suggested itself, and he was asked whether he
might not do it by fine and recovery, and this suggested the efficiency
of that proceeding to bar heirs; and this started the conceit that thus
the lost hair of another man would be recovered.” In such quaint
allusions to the common law and its proceedings Shakespeare abounds, and
we cannot help remembering that Nash, in his prefatory epistle to
Greene’s “Menaphon,” printed about 1589, makes sneering mention of
Shakespeare as a man who had left the “trade of Noverint,” whereunto he
was born, in order to try his hand at tragedy. The “trade of Noverint”
was a slang expression for the business of attorney; and this passage
has suggested that Shakespeare may have spent some time in a law office,
as student or as clerk, either before leaving Stratford, or perhaps soon
after his arrival in London. This seems to me not improbable. On the
other hand, “The Merchant of Venice” contains such crazy law that it is
hard to imagine it coming even from a lawyer’s clerk. At all events, we
may safely say that the legal knowledge exhibited in the plays is no
more than might readily have been acquired by a man of assimilative
genius associating with lawyers. It simply shows the range and accuracy
of Shakespeare’s powers of observation.</p>
<p>Let us come now to the second part of the Delia Bacon theory. Having
satisfied herself that William Shakespeare could not have written the
poems and plays published under his name, she jumped to the conclusion
that Francis Bacon was the author. Surely, a singular choice! Of all
men, why Francis Bacon? Why not, as I said before, George Chapman or Ben
Jonson, men who were at once learned scholars and great poets? Chapman,
like Marlowe, could write the “mighty line.” Jonson had rare lyric
power; his verses sing, as witness the wonderful “Do but look on her
eyes,” which Francis Bacon could no more have written than he could have
jumped over the moon. To pitch upon Bacon as the writer of “Twelfth
Night” or “Romeo and Juliet” is about as sensible as to assert that
“David Copperfield” must have been written by Charles Darwin. After a
familiar acquaintance of more than forty years with Shakespeare’s works,
of nearly forty years with Bacon’s, the two men impress me as simply
antipodal one to the other. A similar feeling was entertained by the
late Mr. Spedding, the biographer and editor of Bacon; and no one has
more happily hit off the vagaries of the Baconizers than the foremost
Bacon scholar now living, Dr. Kuno Fischer, in his recent address before
the Shakespeare Society at Weimar. I used to wonder whether the
Bacon-Shakespeare people really knew anything about Bacon, and, now that
chance has led me to read their books, I am quite sure they do not. To
their minds, his works are simply a storehouse of texts which serve them
for controversial missiles, very much as scattered texts from the Bible
used to serve our uncritical grandfathers.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon was one of the most interesting persons of his time,
and, as is often the case with such many-sided characters, posterity has
held various opinions about him. On the one hand, his fame has grown
brighter with the years; on the other hand, it has come to be more or
less circumscribed and limited. Pope’s famous verse, “The wisest,
brightest, meanest of mankind,” may be disputed in all its three
specifications. Bacon’s treatment of Essex, which formerly called forth
such bitter condemnation, has been, I think, completely justified; and
as for the taking of bribes, which led to his disgrace, there were
circumstances which ought largely to mitigate the severity of our
judgment. But if Bacon was far from being a mean example of human
nature, it is surely an exaggeration to call him the wisest and
brightest of mankind. He was a scholar and critic of vast
accomplishments, a writer of noble English prose, and a philosopher who
represented rather than inaugurated a most beneficial revolution in the
aims and methods of scientific inquiry. He is one of the real glories of
English literature, but he is also one of the most overrated men of
modern times. When we find Macaulay saying that Bacon had “the most
exquisitely constructed intellect that has ever been bestowed on any of
the children of men,” we need not be surprised to find that his
elaborate essay on Bacon is as false in its fundamental conception as it
is inaccurate in details. For a long time it was one of the accepted
commonplaces that Bacon inaugurated the method by which modern
discoveries in physical science have been made. Early in the present
century, such writers on the history of science as Whewell began to show
the incorrectness of this notion, and it was completely exploded by
Stanley Jevons in his “Principles of Science,” the most profound
treatise on method that has appeared in the last fifty years. Jevons
writes: “It is wholly a mistake to say that modern science is the result
of the Baconian philosophy; it is the Newtonian philosophy and the
Newtonian method which have led to all the great triumphs of physical
science, and … the ‘Principia’ forms the true Novum Organon.” This
statement of Jevons is thoroughly sound. The great Harvey, who knew how
scientific discoveries are made, said with gentle sarcasm that Bacon
“wrote philosophy like a lord chancellor;” yet Harvey would not have
denied that the chancellor was doing noble service as the eloquent
expounder of many sides of the scientific movement that was then
gathering strength. Bacons mind was eminently sagacious and fertile in
suggestions, but the supreme creative faculty, the power to lead men
into new paths, was precisely the thing which he did not possess. His
place is a very high one among intellects of the second order; but to
rank him with such godlike spirits as Newton, Spinoza, and Leibnitz
simply shows that one has no real knowledge of the work which such men
have done.</p>
<p>So much for Bacon himself. With regard to him as possible author of
the Shakespeare poems and plays, it is difficult to imagine so learned a
scholar making the kind of mistakes that abound in those writings. Bacon
would hardly have introduced clocks into the Rome of Julius Cæsar; nor
would he have made Hector quote Aristotle, nor Hamlet study at the
University of Wittenberg, founded five hundred years after Hamlet’s
time; nor would he have put pistols into the age of Henry IV., nor
cannon into the age of King John; and we may be pretty sure that he
would not have made one of the characters in “King Lear” talk about
Turks and Bedlam. In this severely realistic age of ours, writers are
more on their guard against such anachronisms than they were in
Shakespeare’s time; in his works we cannot call them serious blemishes,
for they do not affect the artistic character of the plays, but they are
certainly such mistakes as a scholar like Bacon would not have
committed.</p>
<p>Deeper down lies the contrast involved in the fact that Bacon was in
a high degree a subjective writer, from whom you are perpetually getting
revelations of his idiosyncrasies and moods, whereas of all writers in
the world Shakespeare is the most completely objective, the most
absorbed in the work of creation. In the one writer you are always
reminded of the man Bacon; in the other the personality is never thrust
into sight. Bacon is highly self-conscious; from Shakespeare
self-consciousness is absent.</p>
<p>The contrast is equally great in respect of humour. I would not deny
that Bacon relished a joke, or could perpetrate a pun; but the bubbling,
seething, frolicsome, irrepressible drollery of Shakespeare is something
quite foreign to him. Read his essays, and you get charming English,
wide knowledge, deep thought, keen observation, worldly wisdom, good
humour, sweet serenity; but exuberant fun is not there. In writing these
essays Bacon was following an example set by Montaigne, but, as
contrasted with the delicate effervescent humour of the Frenchman, his
style seems sober and almost insipid. Only fancy such a man trying to
write “The Merry Wives of Windsor”!</p>
<p>Both Shakespeare and Bacon were sturdy and rapacious purloiners. They
seized upon other men’s bright thoughts and made them their own without
compunction and without acknowledgment; and this may account for sundry
similarities which may be culled from the plays and from Bacon’s works,
upon which Baconizing text-mongers are wont to lay great stress as proof
of common authorship. Some such resemblances may be due to borrowing
from common sources; others are doubtless purely fanciful; others
indicate either that Shakespeare cribbed from Bacon or vice versa. Here
are a few miscellaneous instances: —</p>
<p>Where Bacon says, “Be so true to thyself as thou be not false to
others” (“Essay of Wisdom”), Shakespeare says: —</p>
<p>“To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.”</p>
<p>(Hamlet, I. iii.)</p>
<p>This looks as if one writer might have copied from the other. If so,
it is Bacon who is the thief, for the lines occur in the quarto “Hamlet”
published in 1603, whereas the “Essay of Wisdom” was first published in
1612.</p>
<p>Again, where Bacon, in the “Essay of Gardens,” says, “The breath of
flowers comes and goes like the warbling of music,” it reminds one
strongly of the exquisite passage in “Twelfth Night” where the Duke
exclaims: —</p>
<p>“That strain again! it had a dying fall: O, it came o’er my ear like
the sweet south, That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and
giving odour.”</p>
<p>I have little doubt that Bacon had this passage in mind when he wrote
the “Essay of Gardens,” which was first published in 1625, two years
later than the complete folio of Shakespeare. This effectually disposes
of the attempt to cite these correspondences in evidence that Bacon
wrote the plays.</p>
<p>Another instance is from “Richard III.:” —</p>
<p>“By a divine instinct men’s minds mistrust Ensuing danger; as, by
proof, we see The waters swell before a boisterous storm.”</p>
<p>Bacon, in the “Essay of Sedition,” writes, “As there are … secret
swellings of seas before a tempest, so there are in states.” But this
essay was not published till 1625, so again we find him copying
Shakespeare. Many such “parallelisms,” cited to prove that Bacon wrote
Shakespeare’s works, do really prove that he read them with great care
and remembered them well, or else took notes from them.</p>
<p>An interesting illustration of the helpless ignorance shown by
Baconizers is furnished by a remark of Sir Toby Belch in “Twelfth
Night.” In his instructions to that dear old simpleton, Sir Andrew
Aguecheek, about the challenge, Sir Toby observes, “If thou thou’st him
some thrice, it shall not be amiss.” In Elizabethan English, to address
a man as “thou” was to treat him as socially inferior; such familiarity
was allowable only between members of the same family or in speaking to
servants, just as you address your wife, and likewise the cook and
housemaid, by their Christian names, while with the ladies of your
acquaintance such familiarity would be rudeness. The same rule for the
pronoun survives to-day in French and German, but has been forgotten in
English. In the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh in 1604, Justice Coke
insulted the prisoner by calling out, “Thou viper! for I thou thee, thou
traitor!” Now, one of our Baconizers thinks that his idol, in writing
“Twelfth Night,” introduced Sir Toby’s suggestion in order to recall to
the audience Coke’s abusive remark. Once more, a little attention to
dates would have prevented the making of a bad blunder. We know from
Manningham’s Diary that “Twelfth Night” had been on the stage nearly two
years before Raleigh’s trial. On the other hand, to say that the play
might have suggested to Coke his coarse speech would be admissible, but
idle, inasmuch as the expression “to thou a man” was an every-day phrase
in that age.</p>
<p>Here it naturally occurs to me to mention the “Promus,” about which
as much fuss has been made as if it really furnished evidence in support
of the Baconian folly. There is in the British Museum a manuscript, in
Bacon’s handwriting, entitled “Promus of Formularies and Elegancies.”
“Promus” means “storehouse” or “treasury.” A date at the top of the
first page shows that it was begun in December, 1594; there is nothing,
I believe, to show over how many years it extended. It is a scrap-book
in which Bacon jotted down such sentences, words, and phrases as struck
his fancy, such as might be utilized in his writings. These neatly
turned phrases, these “formularies and elegancies,” are gathered from
all quarters, — from the Bible, from Virgil and Horace, from Ovid and
Seneca, from Erasmus, from collections of proverbs in various languages,
etc. As there is apparently nothing original in this scrap-bag,
Mr. Spedding did not think it worth while to include it in his edition
of Bacon’s works, but in the fourteenth volume he gives a sufficient
description of it, with illustrative extracts. In 1883 Mrs. Henry Pott
published the whole of this “Promus” manuscript, and swelled it by
comments and dissertations into a volume of 600 octavo pages. She had
found in it several hundred expressions which reminded her of passages
in Shakespeare, and so it confirmed her in the opinion which she already
entertained that Bacon was the author of Shakespeare’s works. Thus, when
the “Promus” has a verse from Ovid, which means, “And the forced tongue
begins to lisp the sound commanded,” it reminds Mrs. Pott of divers
lines in which Shakespeare uses the word “lisp,” as for example, in “As
You Like It,” “you lisp and wear strange suits;” and she jumps to the
conclusion that when Bacon jotted down the verse from Ovid, it was as a
preparatory study toward “As You Like It,” and any other play that
contains the word “lisp:” therefore Bacon wrote all those plays, Q. E.
D.! On the next page we find Virgil’s remark, “Thus was I wont to
compare great things with small,” made the father of Falstaff’s “base
comparisons,” and Fluellen’s “Macedon and Monmouth,” as well as honest
Dogberry’s “comparisons are odorous.” When one reads such things,
evidently printed in all seriousness, one feels like asking Mrs. Pott,
in the apt words of Shakespeare’s friend Fletcher, “What mare’s nest
hast thou found?” (“Bonduca,” V. ii.)</p>
<p>There are many phrases, however, in the “Promus” which undoubtedly
agree with phrases in the plays. They show that Bacon heard or read the
plays with great interest, and culled from them his “elegancies” with no
stinted hand. As for Mrs. Pott’s bulky volume, it brings us so near to
the final reductio ad absurdum of the Bacon theory that we hardly need
spend many words upon the gross improbabilities which that theory
involves. The plays of Shakespeare were universally ascribed to him by
his contemporaries; many of them were published during his lifetime with
his name upon the title-page as the author; all were collected and
published together by Hemminge and Condell, two of his fellow actors,
seven years after his death; and for more than two centuries nobody ever
dreamed of looking for a different authorship, or of associating the
plays with Bacon. But this Chimborazo of prima facie evidence becomes a
mere mole-hill in the hands of your valiant Baconizer. It is all clear
to him. Bacon did not acknowledge the authorship of these works because
such literature was deemed frivolous, and current prejudices against
theatres and playwrights might injure his hopes of advancement at the
bar and in political life. Therefore, by some sort of private
understanding with the ignorant and sordid wretch Shakespeare, at whose
theatre they were brought out, their authorship was ascribed to him, the
real author died without revealing the secret, and the whole world was
deceived until the days of Delia Bacon.</p>
<p>But there are questions which even this ingenious hypothesis fails to
answer. Why should Bacon have taken the time to write those thirty-seven
plays, two poems, and one hundred and fifty-four sonnets, if they were
never to be known as his works? Not for money, surely, for that grasping
Shakespeare seems to have got the money as well as the fame; Bacon died
a poor man. His principal aim in life was to construct a new system of
philosophy; on this noble undertaking he spent such time as he could
save from the exactions of his public career as member of Parliament,
chancery lawyer, solicitor-general, attorney-general, lord chancellor;
and he died with this work far from finished. The volumes which he left
behind him were only fragments of the mighty structure which he had
planned. We may well ask, Where did this overburdened writer find the
time for doing work of another kind voluminous enough to fill a
lifetime, and what motive had he for doing it without recompense in
either fame or money? Baconizers find it strange that Shakespeare’s will
contains no reference to his plays as literary property. The omission is
certainly interesting, since it seems to indicate that he had parted
with his pecuniary interest in them, — had perhaps sold it out to the
Globe Theatre. If this omission can be held to show that Shakespeare was
lacking in fondness for the productions of his own genius, what shall be
said of the notion that Bacon spent half his life in writing works the
paternity of which he must forever disown?</p>
<p>This question is answered by Mr. Ignatius Donnelly, a writer who
speculates with equal infelicity on all subjects, but never suffers for
lack of boldness. He published in 1887 a book even bigger than that of
Mrs. Pott, for it has nearly 1000 pages. Its title is, “The Great
Cryptogram,” and its thesis is, that Bacon really did claim the
authorship of the Shakespeare plays. Only the claim was made in a
cipher, and if you simply make some numbers mean some words, and other
words mean other numbers, and perform a good many sums in what the Mock
Turtle called “ambition, distraction, uglification, and derision,” you
will be able to read this claim between the lines, along with much other
wonderful information. Thus does the arithmetical Donnelly carry us
quite a long stride nearer to the reductio ad absurdum, or suicide
point, than we were left by Mrs. Pott, with her lisping and limping
comparisons.</p>
<p>But before we come to the jumping-off place, let us pause for a
moment and take a retrospective glance at the natural history of the
Bacon-Shakespeare craze. What was it that first unlocked the
sluice-gates, and poured forth such a deluge of foolishness upon a
sorely suffering world? It will hardly do to lay the blame upon poor
Delia Bacon. Her suggestions would have borne no fruit had they not
found a public, albeit a narrow one, in some degree prepared for them.
Who, then, prepared the soil for the seeds of this idiocy to take root?
Who but the race of fond and foolish Shakespeare commentators, with
their absurd claims for their idol? During the eighteenth century
Shakespeare was generally underrated. Voltaire wondered how a nation
that possessed such a noble tragedy as Addison’s “Cato” could endure
such plays as “Hamlet” and “Othello.” In the days of Scott and Burns a
reaction set in; and Shakespeare worship reached its height when the
Germans took it up, and, not satisfied with calling him the prince of
poets and peerless master of dramatic art, began to discover in his
works all sorts of hidden philosophy and impossible knowledge. Of the
average German mind Lowell good-naturedly says that “it finds its
keenest pleasure in divining a profound significance in the most
trifling things, and the number of mare’s nests that have been stared
into by the German Gelehrter through his spectacles passes calculation.”
But the Germans are not the only sinners; let me cite an instance from
near home. In the quarto “Hamlet” of 1603 we read: —</p>
<p>“Full forty years are past, their date is gone, Since happy time
joined both our hearts as one: And now the blood that filled my youthful
veins Runs weakly in their pipes,” etc.</p>
<p>Whereupon Mr. Edward Vining calls upon us to observe how Shakespeare,
“to whom all human knowledge seems to be but a matter of instinct, in
[these lines] asserts the circulation of the blood in the veins and
‘pipes,’ a truth which Harvey probably did not even suspect until at
least thirteen years later,” etc. Does Mr. Vining really suppose that
what Harvey did was to discover that blood runs in our veins? A little
further study of history would have taught him that even the ancients
knew that blood runs in the veins. About fourteen hundred years before
“Hamlet” was written, Galen proved that it also runs in the arteries.
After Galen’s time, it was believed that the dark blood nourishes such
plebeian organs as the liver, while the bright blood nourishes such
lordly organs as the brain, and that the interchange takes place in the
heart; until the sixteenth century, when Vesalius proved that the
interchange does not take place in the heart, and the martyr Servetus
proved that it does take place in the lungs; and so on till 1619, when
Harvey discovered that dark blood is brought by the veins to the right
side of the heart, and thence driven into the lungs, where it becomes
bright and flows into the left side of the heart, thence to be propelled
throughout the body in the arteries. That it then grows dark and returns
through the veins Harvey believed, but no one could tell how, until,
forty years later, Malpighi with his microscope detected the
capillaries. Now to talk about Shakespeare discerning as if by instinct
a truth which Harvey afterward discovered is simply silly. Instead of
showing rare scientific knowledge, his remark about blood running in the
veins is one that anybody might have made.</p>
<p>This is a fair specimen of the ignorant way in which doting
commentators have built up an impossible Shakespeare, until at last they
have provoked a reaction. Sooner or later the question was sure to
arise, Where did your Stratford boy get all this abstruse scientific
knowledge? The keynote was perhaps first sounded by August von Schlegel,
who persuaded himself that Shakespeare had mastered “all the things and
relations of this world,” and then went on to declare that the accepted
account of his life must be a mere fable. Thus we reach the point from
which Delia Bacon started.</p>
<p>It may safely be said that all theories of Shakespeare’s plays which
suppose them to be attempts at teaching occult philosophical doctrines,
or which endow them with any other meanings than those which their words
directly and plainly convey, are a delusion and a snare. Those plays
were written, not to teach philosophy, but to fill the theatre and make
money. They were written by a practised actor and manager, the most
consummate master of dramatic effects that ever lived; a poet
unsurpassed for fertility of invention, unequalled for melody of
language, unapproached for delicacy of fancy, inexhaustible in humour,
profoundest of moralists; a man who knew human nature by intuition, as
Mozart knew counterpoint or as Chopin knew harmony. The name of that
writer was none other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that the Bacon folly, after once adopting such
methods as those of Mrs. Pott and Mr. Donnelly, should proceed to commit
suicide by piling up extravagances. By such methods one can prove
anything, and accordingly we find these writers busy in tracing Bacon’s
hand in the writings of Greene, Marlowe, Shirley, Marston, Massinger,
Middleton, and Webster. They are sure that he was the author of
Montaigne’s Essays, which were afterward translated into what we have
always supposed to be the French original. Mr. Donnelly believes that
Bacon also wrote Burton’s “Anatomy of Melancholy.” Next comes
Dr. Orville Owen with a new cipher, which proves that Bacon was the son
of Queen Elizabeth by Robert Dudley, and that he was the author of the
“Faerie Queene” and other poems attributed to Edmund Spenser. Finally we
have Mr. J. E. Roe, who does not mean to be outdone. He asks us what we
are to think of the notion that an ignorant tinker, like John Bunyan,
could have written the most perfect allegory in any language. Perish the
thought! Nobody but Bacon could have done it. Of course Bacon had been
more than fifty years in his grave when “Pilgrim’s Progress” was
published as Bunyan’s. But your true Baconizer is never stopped by
trifles. Mr. Roe assures us that Bacon wrote that heavenly book, as well
as “Robinson Crusoe” and the “Tale of a Tub;” which surely begins to
make him seem ubiquitous and everlasting. If things go on at this rate,
we shall presently have a religious sect holding as its first article of
faith that Francis Bacon created the heavens and the earth in six days,
and rested on the seventh day.</p>

Classification of the Sciences — Francis Bacon by Walter Libby</h2>
<p>From ‘An Introduction to the History of Science’</p>
<p>The preceding chapter has shown that there is a continuity in the
development of single sciences. The astronomy, or the chemistry, or the
mathematics, of one period depends so directly on the respective science
of the foregoing period, that one feels justified in using the term
“growth,” or “evolution,” to describe their progress. Now a vital
relationship can be observed not only among different stages of the same
science, but also among the different sciences. Physics, astronomy, and
chemistry have much in common; geometry, trigonometry, arithmetic, and
algebra are called “branches” of mathematics; zoölogy and botany are
biological sciences, as having to do with living species. In the century
following the death of Copernicus, two great scientists, Bacon and
Descartes, compared all knowledge to a tree, of which the separate
sciences are branches. They thought of all knowledge as a living
organism with an interconnection or continuity of parts, and a
capability of growth.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the seventeenth century the sciences were so
considerable that in the interest of further progress a comprehensive
view of the tree of knowledge, a survey of the field of learning, was
needed. The task of making this survey was undertaken by Francis Bacon,
Lord Verulam (1561-1626). His classification of human knowledge was
celebrated, and very influential in the progress of science. He kept one
clear purpose in view, namely, the control of nature by man. He wished
to take stock of what had already been accomplished, to supply
deficiencies, and to enlarge the bounds of human empire. He was acutely
conscious that this was an enterprise too great for any one man, and he
used his utmost endeavors to induce James I to become the patron of the
plan. His project admits of very simple statement now; he wished to edit
an encyclopedia, but feared that it might prove impossible without
coöperation and without state support. He felt capable of furnishing the
plans for the building, but thought it a hardship that he was compelled
to serve both as architect and laborer. The worthiness of these plans
was attested in the middle of the eighteenth century, when the great
French Encyclopaedia was projected by Diderot and D’Alembert. The
former, its chief editor and contributor, wrote in the Prospectus: “If
we come out successful from this vast undertaking, we shall owe it
mainly to Chancellor Bacon, who sketched the plan of a universal
dictionary of sciences and arts at a time when there were not, so to
speak, either arts or sciences. This extraordinary genius, when it was
impossible to write a history of what men knew, wrote one of what they
had to learn.”</p>
<p>Bacon, as we shall amply see, was a firm believer in the study of the
arts and occupations, and at the same time retained his devotion to
principles and abstract thought. He knew that philosophy could aid the
arts that supply daily needs; also that the arts and occupations
enriched the field of philosophy, and that the basis of our
generalizations must be the universe of things knowable. “For,” he
writes, “if men judge that learning should be referred to use and
action, they judge well; but it is easy in this to fall into the error
pointed out in the ancient fable; in which the other parts of the body
found fault with the stomach, because it neither performed the office of
motion as the limbs do, nor of sense, as the head does; but yet
notwithstanding it is the stomach which digests and distributes the
aliment to all the rest. So that if any man think that philosophy and
universality are idle and unprofitable studies, he does not consider
that all arts and professions are from thence supplied with sap and
strength.” For Bacon, as for Descartes, natural philosophy was the trunk
of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he looked to the arts, crafts, and occupations as
a source of scientific principles. In his survey of learning he found
some records of agriculture and likewise of many mechanical arts. Some
think them a kind of dishonor. “But if my judgment be of any weight, the
use of History Mechanical is, of all others, the most radical and
fundamental towards natural philosophy.” When the different arts are
known, the senses will furnish sufficient concrete material for the
information of the understanding. The record of the arts is of most use
because it exhibits things in motion, and leads more directly to
practice. “Upon this history, therefore, mechanical and illiberal as it
may seem (all fineness and daintiness set aside), the greatest diligence
must be bestowed.” “Again, among the particular arts those are to be
preferred which exhibit, alter, and prepare natural bodies and materials
of things as agriculture, cooking, chemistry, dyeing; the manufacture of
glass, enamel, sugar, gunpowder, artificial fires, paper and the like.”
Weaving, carpentry, architecture, manufacture of mills, clocks, etc.
follow. The purpose is not solely to bring the arts to perfection, but
all mechanical experiments should be as streams flowing from all sides
into the sea of philosophy.</p>
<p>Shortly after James I came to the throne in 1603, Bacon published his
Advancement of Learning. He continued in other writings, however, to
develop the organization of knowledge, and in 1623 summed up his plan in
the De Augmentis Scientiarum.</p>
<p>A recent writer (Pearson, 1900) has attempted to summarize Bacon’s
classification of the different branches of learning. When one compares
this summary with an outline of the classification of knowledge made by
the French monk, Hugo of St. Victor, who stands midway between Isidore
of Seville (570-636) and Bacon, some points of resemblance are of course
obvious. Moreover, Hugo, like Bacon, insisted on the importance of not
being narrowly utilitarian. Men, he says, are often accustomed to value
knowledge not on its own account but for what it yields. Thus it is with
the arts of husbandry, weaving, painting, and the like, where skill is
considered absolutely vain, unless it results in some useful product.
If, however, we judged after this fashion of God’s wisdom, then, no
doubt, the creation would be preferred to the Creator. But wisdom is
life, and the love of wisdom is the joy of life (felicitas vitæ).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when we compare these classifications diligently, we
find very marked differences between Bacon’s views and the medieval. The
weakest part of Hugo’s classification is that which deals with natural
philosophy. Physica, he says, undertakes the investigation of the causes
of things in their effects, and of effects in their causes. It deals
with the explanation of earthquakes, tides, the virtues of plants, the
fierce instincts of wild animals, every species of stone, shrub, and
reptile. When we turn to his special work, however, on this branch of
knowledge, Concerning Beasts and Other Things, we find no attempt to
subdivide the field of physica, but a series of details in botany,
geology, zoölogy, and human anatomy, mostly arranged in dictionary
form.</p>
<p>When we refer to Bacon’s classification we find that Physics
corresponds to Hugo’s Physica. It studies natural phenomena in relation
to their material causes. For this study, Natural History, according to
Bacon, supplies the facts. Let us glance, then, at his work on natural
history, and see how far he had advanced from the medieval toward the
modern conception of the sciences.</p>
<p>For purposes of scientific study he divided the phenomena of the
universe into (1) Celestial phenomena; (2) Atmosphere; (3) Globe; (4)
Substance of earth, air, fire, water; (5) Genera, species, etc. Great
scope is given to the natural history of man. The arts are classified as
nature modified by man. History means, of course, descriptive
science.</p>
