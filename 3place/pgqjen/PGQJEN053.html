<h4 id="chapter-xxvi">Chapter XXVI</h4>
<p>Prometheus, or the State of Man Explained of an Over-Ruling
Providence, and of Human Nature</p>
<p>THE ancients relate that man was the work of Prometheus, and formed
of clay; only the artificer mixed in with the mass, particles taken from
different animals. And being desirous to improve his workmanship, and
endow, as well as create, the human race, he stole up to heaven with a
bundle of birch-rods, and kindling them at the chariot of the Sun,
thence brought down fire to the earth for the service of men.</p>
<p>They add, that for this meritorious act Prometheus was repayed with
ingratitude by mankind, so that, forming a conspiracy, they arraigned
both him and his invention before Jupiter. But the matter was otherwise
received than they imagined; for the accusation proved extremely
grateful to Jupiter and the gods, insomuch that, delighted with the
action, they not only indulged mankind the use of fire, but moreover
conferred upon them a most acceptable and desirable present,
viz. perpetual youth.</p>
<p>But men, foolishly overjoyed hereat, laid this present of the gods
upon an ass, who, in returning back with it, being extremely thirsty,
strayed to a fountain. The serpent, who was guardian thereof; would not
suffer him to drink, but upon condition of receiving the burden he
carried, whatever it should be. The silly ass complied, and thus the
perpetual renewal of youth was, for a drop of water, transferred from
men to the race of serpents.</p>
<p>Prometheus, not desisting from his unwarrantable practices, though
now reconciled to mankind, after they were thus tricked of their
present, but still continuing inveterate against Jupiter, had the
boldness to attempt deceit, even in a sacrifice, and is said to have
once offered up two bulls to Jupiter, but so as in the hide of one of
them to wrap all the flesh and fat of both, and stuffing out the other
hide only with the bones; then in a religious and devout manner, gave
Jupiter his choice of the two. Jupiter, detesting this sly fraud and
hypocrisy, but having thus an opportunity of punishing the offender,
purposely chose the mock bull.</p>
<p>And now giving way to revenge, but finding he could not chastise the
insolence of Prometheus without afflicting the human race (in the
production whereof Prometheus had strangely and insufferably prided
himself), he commanded Vulcan to form a beautiful and graceful woman, to
whom every god presented a certain gift, whence she was called Pandora.
They put into her hands an elegant box, containing all sorts of miseries
and misfortunes; but Hope was placed at the bottom of it. With this box
she first goes to Prometheus, to try if she could prevail upon him to
receive and open it; but be, being upon his guard, warily refused the
offer. Upon this refusal, she comes to his brother Epimetheus, a man of
a very different temper, who rashly and inconsiderately opens the box.
When finding all kinds of miseries and misfortunes issued out of it, he
grew wise too late, and with great hurry and struggle endeavoured to
clap the cover on again; but with all his endeavour could scarce keep in
Hope, which lay at the bottom.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jupiter arraigned Prometheus of many heinous crimes: as that
he formerly stole fire from heaven; that he contemptuously and
deceitfully mocked him by a sacrifice of bones; that he despised his
present, adding withal a new crime, that he attempted to ravish Pallas:
for all which, he was sentenced to be bound in chains, and doomed to
perpetual torments. Accordingly, by Jupiter’s command, he was brought to
Mount Caucasus, and there fastened to a pillar, so firmly that he could
no way stir. A vulture or eagle stood by him, which in the daytime
gnawed and consumed his liver; but in the night the wasted parts were
supplied again; whence matter for his pain was never wanting.</p>
<p>They relate, however, that his punishment had an end; for Hercules
sailing the ocean, in a cup, or pitcher, presented him by the Sun, came
at length to Caucasus, shot the eagle with his arrows, and set
Prometheus free. In certain nations, also, there were instituted
particular games of the torch, to the honour of Prometheus, in which
they who ran for the prize carried lighted torches; and as any one of
these torches happened to go out, the bearer withdrew himself, and gave
way to the next; and that person was allowed to win the prize who first
brought in his lighted torch to the goal.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - This fable contains and enforces many just, and
serious considerations; some whereof have been long since well observed,
but some again remain perfectly untouched. Prometheus clearly and
expressly signifies Providence; for of all the things in nature, the
formation and endowment of man was singled out by the ancients, and
esteemed the peculiar work of Providence. The reason hereof seems, 1.
That the nature of man includes a mind and understanding, which is the
seat of Providence. 2. That it is harsh and incredible to suppose reason
and mind should be raised, and drawn out of senseless and irrational
principles; whence it becomes almost inevitable, that providence is
implanted in the human mind in conformity with, and by the direction and
the design of the greater over-ruling Providence. But, 3. The principal
cause is this: that man seems to be the thing in which the whole world
centres, with respect to final causes; so that if he were away, all
other things would stray and fluctuate, without end or intention, or
become perfectly disjointed, and out of frame; for all. things are made
subservient to man, and he receives use and benefit from them all. Thus
the revolutions, places, and periods, of the celestial bodies, serve him
for distinguishing times and seasons, and for dividing the world into
different regions; the meteors afford him prognostications of the
weather; the winds sail our ships, drive our mills, and move our
machines; and the vegetables and animals of all kinds either afford us
matter for houses and habitations, clothing, food, physic, or tend to
ease, or delight, to support, or refresh us: so that everything in
nature seems not made for itself, but for man.</p>
<p>And it is not without reason added, that the mass of matter whereof
man was formed, should be mixed up with particles taken from different
animals, and wrought in with the clay, because it is certain, that of
all things in the universe, man is the most compounded and recompounded
body; so that the ancients not improperly styled him a Microcosm, or
little world within himself. For although the chemists have absurdly,
and too literally, wrested and perverted the elegance of the term
microcosm, whilst they pretend to find all kind of mineral and vegetable
matters, or something corresponding to them, in man, yet it remains firm
end unshaken, that the human body is of all substances the most mixed
and organical; whence it has surprising powers end faculties: for the
powers of simple bodies are but few, though certain and quick; as being
little broken, or weakened, and not counterbalanced by mixture: but
excellence and quantity of energy reside in mixture and composition.</p>
<p>Man, however, in his first origin, seems to be a defenceless naked
creature, slow in assisting himself, and standing in need of numerous
things. Prometheus, therefore, hastened to the invention of fire, which
supplies and administers to nearly all human uses and necessities,
insomuch that, if the soul may be called the form of forms, if the hand
may be called the instrument of instruments, fire may, as properly, be
called the assistant of assistants, or the helper of helps:; for hence
proceed numberless operations, hence all the mechanic arts, and hence
infinite assistances are afforded to the sciences themselves.</p>
<p>The manner wherein Prometheus stole this fire is properly described
from the nature of the thing; he being said to have done it by applying
a rod of birch to the chariot of the Sun: for birch is used in striking
and beating, which clearly denotes the generation of fire to be from the
violent percussions and collisions of bodies; whereby the matters struck
are subtilized, rarefied, put into motion, and so prepared to receive
the heat of the celestial bodies; whence they, in clandestine and secret
manner, collect and snatch fire, as it were by stealth, from the chariot
of the Sun.</p>
<p>The next is a remarkable part of the fable, which represents that
men, instead of gratitude and thanks, fell into indignation and
expostulation, accusing both Prometheus ad his fine to Jupiter, - and
yet the accusation proved highly pleasing to Jupiter; so that he, for
this reason, crowned these benefits of mankind with a new bounty. Here
it may seem strange that the sin of ingratitude to a creator and
benefactor, a sin so heinous as to include almost all others, should
meet with approbation and reward. But the allegory has another view, and
denotes, that the accusation and arraignment, both of human nature and
human art among mankind, proceeds from a most noble and laudable temper
of the mind, and tends to a very good purpose; whereas the contrary
temper is odious to the gods, and unbeneficial in itself. For they who
break into extravagant praises of human nature, and the arts in vogue,
and who lay themselves out in admiring the things they already possess,
and will needs have the sciences cultivated among them, to be thought
absolutely perfect and complete, in the first place, show little regard
to the divine nature, whilst they extol their own inventions almost as
high as his perfection. In the neat place, men of this temper are
unserviceable and prejudicial in life, whilst they imagine themselves
already got to the top of things, and there rest, without farther
inquiry. On the contrary, they who arraign and accuse both nature and
art, and are always full of complaints against them, not only preserve a
more just and modest sense of mind, but are also perpetually stirred up
to fresh industry and new discoveries. Is not, then, the ignorance and
fatality of mankind to be extremely pitied, whilst they remain slaves to
the arrogance of a few of their own fellows, and are dotingly fond of
that scrap of Grecian knowledge, the Peripatetic philosophy; and this to
such a degree, as not only to think all accusation or arraignment
thereof useless, but even hold it suspect and dangerous? Certainly the
procedure of Empedocles, though furious - but especially that of
Democritus (who with great modesty complained that all things were
abstruse; that we know nothing; that truth lies hid in deep pits; that
falsehood is strangely joined and twisted along with truth,
andandandandc} - is to be preferred before the confident, assuming, and
dogmatical school of Aristotle. Mankind are, therefore, to be
admonished, that the arraignment of nature and of art is pleasing to the
gods; and that a sharp and vehement accusation of Prometheus, though a
creator, a founder, and a master, obtained new blessings and presents
from the divine bounty, and proved more sound and serviceable than a
diffusive harangue of praise and gratulation. And let men be assured,
that the fond opinion that they have already acquired enough, is a
principal reason why they have acquired so little.</p>
<p>That the perpetual flower of youth should be the present which
mankind received as a reward for their accusation, carries this moral:
that the ancients seem not to have despaired of discovering methods, and
remedies, for retarding old age, and prolonging the period of human
life, but rather reckoned it among those things which, through sloth and
want of diligent inquiry, perish and come to nothing, after having been
once undertaken, than among such as are absolutely impossible, or placed
beyond the reach of the human power. For they signify and intimate from
the true use of fire, and the just and strenuous accusation and
conviction of the errors of art, that the divine bounty is not wanting
to men in such kind of presents, but that men indeed are wanting to
themselves, and lay such an inestimable gift upon the back of a
slow-paced ass; that is, upon the back of the heavy, dull, lingering
thing, experience; from whose sluggish and tortoise-pace proceeds that
ancient complaint of the shortness of life, and the slow advancement of
arts. And certainly it may well seem, that the two faculties of
reasoning and experience arts not hitherto properly joined and coupled
together, but to be still new gifts of the gods, separately laid, the
one upon the back of a light bird, or abstract philosophy, and the other
upon an ass, or slow-paced practice and trial. And yet good hopes might
be conceived of this ass, if it were not for his thirst and the
accidents of the way. For we judge, that if any one would constantly
proceed, by a certain law and method, in the road of experience, and not
by the way thirst after such experiments as make for profit or
ostentation, nor exchange his burden, or quit the original design for
the sake of these, he might be an useful bearer of a new and accumulated
divine bounty to mankind.</p>
<p>That this gift of perpetual youth should pass from men to serpents,
seems added by way of ornament, and illustration to the fable; perhaps
intimating, at the same time, the shame it is for men, that they, with
their fire, and numerous arts, cannot procure to themselves those things
which nature has bestowed upon many other creatures.</p>
<p>The sudden reconciliation of Prometheus to mankind, after being
disappointed of their hopes, contains a prudent and useful admonition.
It points out the levity and temerity of men in new experiments, when,
not presently succeeding, or answering to expectation, they
precipitantly quit their new undertakings, hurry back to their old ones,
and grow reconciled thereto.</p>
<p>After the fable has described the state of man, with regard to arts
and intellectual matters, it passes on to religion; for after the
inventing and settling of arts, follows the establishment of divine
worship, which hypocrisy presently enters into and corrupts. So that by
the two sacrifices we have elegantly painted the person of a man truly
religious, and of an hypocrite. One of these sacrifices contained the
fat, or the portion of God, used for burning and incensing; thereby
denoting affection and zeal, offered up to his glory. It likewise
contained the bowels, which are expressive of charity, along with the
good and useful flesh. But the other contained nothing more than dry
bones, which nevertheless stuffed out the hide, so as to make it
resemble a fair, beautiful, and magnificent sacrifice; hereby finely
denoting the external and empty rites and barren ceremonies, wherewith
men burden and stuff out the divine worship, - things rather intended
for show and ostentation than conducing to piety: - Nor are mankind
simply content with this mock-worship of God, but also impose and father
it upon him, as if he had chosen and ordained it. Certainly the prophet,
in the person of God, has a fine expostulation, as to this matter of
choice - “Is this the fasting which I have chosen, that a man should
afflict his soul for a day, and bow down his head like a bulrush?”</p>
<p>After thus touching the state of religion, the fable next turns to
manners, and the conditions of human life. And though it be a very
common, yet is it a just interpretation, that Pandora denotes the
pleasures and licentiousness which the cultivation and luxury of the
arts of civil life introduce, as it were, by the instrumental efficacy
of fire; whence the works of the voluptuary arts are properly attributed
to Vulcan, the God of Fire. And hence infinite miseries and calamities
have proceeded to the minds, the bodies, and the fortunes of men,
together with a late repentance; and this not only in each man’s
particular, but also in kingdoms and states; for wars, and tumults, and
tyrannies, have all arisen from this same fountain, or box of
Pandora.</p>
<p>It is worth observing, how beautifully and elegantly the fable has
drawn two reigning characters in human life, and given two examples, or
tablatures of them, under the persons of Prometheus and Epimetheus. The
followers of Epimetheus are improvident, see not far before them, and
prefer such things as are agreeable for the present; whence they are
oppressed with numerous straits, difficulties; and calamities, with
which they almost continually struggle; but in the mean time gratify
their own temper, and, for want of a better knowledge of things, feed
their minds with many vain hopes; and as with so many pleasing dreams,
delight themselves, and sweeten the miseries of life.</p>
<p>But the followers of Prometheus are the prudent, wary men, that look
into futurity, and cautiously guard against, prevent, and undermine many
calamities and misfortunes. But this watchful, provident temper, is
attended with a deprivation of numerous pleasures, and the loss of
various delights, whilst such men debar themselves the use even of
innocent things, and what is still worse, rack and torture themselves
with cares, fears, and disquiets; being bound fast to the pillar of
necessity, and tormented with numberless thoughts (which for their
swiftness are well compared to an eagle), that continually wound, tear,
and gnaw their liver or mind, unless, perhaps, they find some small
remission by intervals, or as it were at nights; but then new anxieties,
dreads, and fears, soon return again, as it were in the morning. And,
therefore, very few men, of either temper, have secured to themselves
the advantages of providence, and kept clear of disquiets, troubles, and
misfortunes.</p>
<p>Nor indeed can any man obtain this end without the assistance of
Hercules; that is, of such fortitude and constancy of mind as stands
prepared against every event, and remains indifferent to every change;
looking forward without being daunted, enjoying the good without
disdain, and enduring the bad without impatience. And it must be
observed, that even Prometheus had not the power to free himself, but
owed his deliverance to another; for no natural inbred force and
fortitude could prove equal to such a task. The power of releasing him
came from the utmost confines of the ocean, and from the sun; that is,
from Apollo, or knowledge; and again, from a due consideration of the
uncertainty, instability, and fluctuating state of human life, which is
aptly represented by sailing the ocean. Accordingly, Virgil has
prudently joined these two together, accounting him happy who knows the
causes of things, and has conquered all his fears, apprehensions, and
superstitions.</p>
<p>It is added; with great elegance, for supporting and confirming the
human mind, that the great hero who thus delivered him sailed the ocean
in a cup, or pitcher, to prevent fear, or complaint; as if, through the
narrowness of our nature, or a too great fragility thereof, we were
absolutely incapable of that fortitude and constancy to which Seneca,
finely alludes, when he says, “It is a noble thing, at once to
participate in the frailty of man and the security of a god.”</p>
<p>We have hitherto, that we might not break the connection of things,
designedly omitted the last crime of Prometheus - that of attempting the
chastity of Minerva - which heinous offence it doubtless was, that
caused the punishment of having his liver gnawed by the vulture. The
meaning seems to be this, that when men are puffed up with arts and
knowledge, they often try to subdue even the divine wisdom and bring it
under the dominion of sense and reason, whence inevitably follows a
perpetual and restless rending and tearing of the mind. A sober and
humble distinction must, therefore, be made betwixt divine and human
things, and betwixt the oracles of sense and faith, unless mankind had
rather choose an heretical religion, and a fictitious and romantic
philosophy.</p>
<p>The last particular in the fable is the Games of the Torch,
instituted to Prometheus, which again relates to arts and sciences, as
well as the invention of fire, for the commemoration and celebration
whereof three games were held. And here we have an extremely prudent
admonition, directing us to expect the perfection of the sciences from
succession, and not from the swiftness and abilities of any single
person; for he who is fleetest and strongest in the course may perhaps
be less fit to keep his touch a-light, since there is danger of its
going out from too rapid as well as from too slow a motion.</p>
<p>But this kind of contest, with the torch, seems to have been long
dropped and neglected; the sciences appearing to have flourished
principally in their first authors, as Aristotle, Galen, Euclid,
Ptolemy, andandandandc.; whilst their successors have done very little,
or scarce made any attempts. But it were highly to be wished that these
games might be renewed, to the honour of Prometheus, or human nature,
and that they might excite contest, emulation, and laudable endeavours,
and the design meet with such success as not to hang tottering,
tremulous, and hazarded, upon the torch of any single person. Mankind,
therefore, should be admonished to rouse themselves, and try and exert
their own strength and chance, and, not place all their dependence upon
a few men, whose abilities and capacities, perhaps, are not greater than
their own.</p>
<p>These are the particulars which appear to us shadowed out by this
trite and vulgar fable, though without denying that there may be
contained in it several intimations that have a surprising
correspondence with the Christian mysteries. In particular, the voyage
of Hercules; made in a pitcher, to release Prometheus, bears an allusion
to the word of God, coming in the frail vessel of the flesh to redeem
mankind. But we indulge ourselves no such liberties as these, for fear
of using strange fire at the altar of the Lord.</p>
