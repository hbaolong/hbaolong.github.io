<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>That the cautels and devices put in practice in the delivery of
knowledge for the covering and palliating of ignorance, and the gracing
and overvaluing of that they utter, are without number; but none more
bold and more hurtful than two; the one that men have used of a few
observations upon any subject to make a solemn and formal art, by
filling it up with discourse, accommodating it with some circumstances
and directions to practice, and digesting it into method, whereby men
grow satisfied and secure, as if no more inquiry were to be made of that
matter; the other, that men have used to discharge ignorance with
credit, in defining all those effects which they cannot attain unto to
be out of the compass of art and human endeavour. That the very styles
and forms of utterance are so many characters of imposture, some
choosing a style of pugnacity and contention, some of satire and
reprehension, some of plausible and tempting similitudes and examples,
some of great words and high discourse, some of short and dark
sentences, some of exactness of method, all of positive affirmation,
without disclosing the true motives and proofs of their opinions, or
free confessing their ignorance or doubts, except it be now and then for
a grace, and in cunning to win the more credit in the rest, and not in
good faith. That although men be free from these errors and incumbrances
in the will and affection, yet it is not a thing so easy as is conceived
to convey the conceit of one man’s mind into the mind of another without
loss or mistaking, specially in notions new and differing from those
that are received. That never any knowledge was delivered in the same
order it was invented, no not in the mathematic, though it should seem
otherwise in regard that the propositions placed last do use the
propositions or grants placed first for their proof and demonstration.
That there are forms and methods of tradition wholly distinct and
differing, according to their ends whereto they are directed. That there
are two ends of tradition of knowledge, the one to teach and instruct
for use and practice, the other to impart or intimate for re-examination
and progression. That the former of these ends requireth a method not
the same whereby it was invented and induced, but such as is most
compendious and ready whereby it may be used and applied. That the
latter of the ends, which is where a knowledge is delivered to be
continued and spun on by a succession of labours, requireth a method
whereby it may be transposed to another in the same manner as it was
collected, to the end it may be discerned both where the work is weak,
and where it breaketh off. That this latter method is not only unfit for
the former end, but also impossible for all knowledge gathered and
insinuated by Anticipations, because the mind working inwardly of
itself, no man can give a just account how he came to that knowledge
which he hath received, and that therefore this method is peculiar for
knowledge gathered by interpretation. That the discretion anciently
observed, though by the precedent of many vain persons and deceivers
disgraced, of publishing part, and reserving part to a private
succession, and of publishing in a manner whereby it shall not be to the
capacity nor taste of all, but shall as it were single and adopt his
reader, is not to be laid aside, both for the avoiding of abuse in the
excluded, and the stregthening of affection in the admitted. That there
are other virtues of tradition, as that there be no occasion given to
error, and that it carry a vigour to root and spread against the vanity
of wits and injuries of time; all which if they were ever due to any
knowledge delivered, or if they were never due to any human knowledge
heretofore delivered, yet are now due to the knowledge propounded.</p>
