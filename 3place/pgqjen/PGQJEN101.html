<h4 id="x.-century.">X. Century.</h4>
<p>THe Philosophie of Pythagoras, (which was full of Superstition,) did
first plant a Monstrous Imagination, Which afterwards was, by the
Schoole of Plato, and Others, Warred, and Nourished. It was, that the
World was One, Entire, Perfect, Liuing Creature; Insomuch as Apolloni-
of Tya-a, a Pythagorean Prophet, affirmed, that the Ebbing and Flowing
of the Sea, was the Respiration of the World, drawing in Water as
Breath, and putting it forth againe. They went on, and inferred; That if
the World were a Liuing Creature, it had a Soule, and Spirit; Which also
they ha — calling it Spiritus Mundi; The Spirit or Soule of the World:
By which they did not intend God; (for they did admit of a Deitie
besides;) But only the Soule, or Essentiall Forme of the Vniue-se. This
Foundation being laid, they mought build vpon it, what they would; For
in a Liuing Creature, though neuer so great, (As for Example, in a great
Whale,) the Sense, and the Affects of any one Part of the Body,
instantly make a Transcursion tho- rowout the whole Body: So that by
this they did insinuate, that no Distance of Place, nor Want or
Indisposition of Matter, could hinder Magicall Operations; But that,
(for Example,) wee mought here in Europe, haue Sense and Feeling of
that, which was done in China: And likewise, we mought worke any Effect,
without, and against Matter: And this, not Holpen by the Cooperation of
Angels, or Spirits, but only by the Vnitie and Harmonie of Nature. There
were some also, that staid not here; but went further, and held; That if
the Spirit of Man, (whom they call the Microcosme,) doe giue a fit touch
to the Spirit of the World, by strong Imaginations, and Beleefes, it
might command Nature; For Paracelsus, and some darksome Authors of
Magicke, doe ascribe to Imagination Exalted, the Power of
Miracle-working Faith. With these Vast and Bottomelesse Follies, Men
haue been (in part) entertained.</p>
<p>But wee, that hold firme to the Works of God; And to the Sense, which
is Gods Lampe; (Lucerna Dei Spiraculum Hominis;) willen quire, with all
Sobrietie, and Seueritie, whether there be to be found, in the
Foot-steps of Nature, any such Transmission and Influx of Immateriate
Vertues; And what the Force of Imagination is; Either vpon the Body
Imaginant, or vpon another Body: Wherein it will be like that Labour of
Hercules, in Purging the Stable of Augeas, to separate from
Superstitious, and Magicall Arts, and Obseruations, any thing that is
cleane, and pure Naturall; And not to be either Contemned, or Condemned.
And although wee shall haue occasion to speake of this in more Places
than One, yet we will now make some Entrance thereinto.</p>
<p>Men are to be Admonished, that they doe not with-draw Credit, from
the Operations by Transmission of Spirits, and Force of Imagination,
because the Effects faile sometimes. For as in Infection, and Contagion
from Body to Body, (as the Plague, and the like,) it is most certaine,
that the Infection is receiued (many times) by the Body Passiue, but yet
is by the Strength, and good Disposition thereof, Repulsed, and wrought
out, before it be formed into a Disease; So much more in Impressions
from Minde to Minde, or from Spirit to Spirit, the Impression taketh,
but is Encountred, and Ouercome, by the Minde and Spirit, which is
Passiue, before it worke any manifest Effect. And therefore, they worke
most vpon Weake Mindes, and Spirits: As those of Women; Sicke Persons;
Superstitious, and Fearfull Persons; Children, and Young Creatures;</p>
<p>Nescio quis teneros Oculus mihi fascinat Agnos:</p>
<p>The Poet speaketh not of Sheepe, but of Lambs. As for the Weaknesse
of the Power of them, vpon Kings, and Magistrates; It may be ascribed,
(besides the maine, which is the Protection of God, ouer those that
Execute his Place,) to the Weaknesse of the Imagination of the
Imaginant: For it is hard, for a Witch, or a Sorcerer, to put on a
Beleefe, that they can hurt such Persons.</p>
<p>Men are to be Admonished, on the other side, that they doe not easily
giue Place and Credit to these Operations, because they Succeed many
times; For the Cause of this Successe, is (oft) to be truly ascribed,
vnto the Force of Affection and Imagination, vpon the Body Agent; And
then by a Secondary Meanes, it may worke vpon a Diuers Body: As for
Example; If a Man carry a Planets Seale, or a Ring, or some Part of a
Beast, beleeuing strongly, that it will helpe him to obtaine his Loue;
Or to keepe him from danger of hurt in Fight; Or to preuaile in a Suit;
andandandandc. it may make him more Actiue, and Industrious; And againe,
more Confident, and Persisting, than otherwise he would be. Now the
great Effects that may come of Industrie, and Perseuerance, (especially
in Ciuill Businesse,) who knoweth not? For wee see Audacitie doth almost
binde and mare the weaker Sort of Minds; And the State of Humane Actions
is so variable, that to trie Things oft, and neuer to giue ouer, doth
Wonders: Therefore, it were a Meere Fallacie and Mistaking, to ascribe
that to the Force of Imagination, vpon another Body, which is but the
Force of Imagination vpon the Proper Body: For there is no doubt, but
that Imagination, and Vehement Affection, worke greatly vpon the Body of
the Imaginant: As wee shall shew in due place.</p>
<p>Men are to be Admonished, that as they are not to mistake the Causes
of these Operations; So, much lesse, they are to mistake the Fact, or
Effect; And rashly to take that for done, which is not done. And
therefore, as diuers wise Indges haue prescribed, and cautioned, Men may
not too rashly beleeue, the Confessions of Witches, nor yet the Enidence
against them. For the Witches themselues are Imaginatiue, and beleeue
oft-times, they doe that, which they doe not: And People are Credulous
in that point, and ready to impute Accidents, and Naturall Operations,
to Witch Craft. It is worthy the Obseruing, that both in Ancient, and
Late times; (As in the Thassalian Witches, and the Meetings of Witches
that haue beene recorded by so many late Confessions;) the great Wonders
which they tell, of Carrying in the Aire; Transforming themselues into
other Bodies; andandandandc. are still reported to be wrought, not by
Incantations, or Ceremonies; But by Ointments, and Annointing themselues
all ouer. This may iustly moue a Man to thinke, that these Fables are
the Effects of Imagination: For it is certaine, that Ointments doe all,
(if they be laid on any thing thicke,) by Stopping of the Pores, shut in
the Vapours, and send them to the Head extremely. And for the Particular
Ingredients of those Magicall Ointments, it is like they are Opiate, and
Soporiferous. For Annointing of the Fore-head, Necke, Feet, Back-Bone,
we know is vsed for Procuring Dead Sleepes: And if any Man say, that
this Effect would be better done by Inward Potions; Answer may be made,
that the Medicines, which goe to the Ointments, are so strong, that if
they were vsed inwards, they would kill those that vse them: And
therefore they worke Potently, though Outwards.</p>
<p>We will diuide the Seuerall Kindes of the Operations, by Transmission
of Spirits, and Imagination; Which will giue no small Light to the
Experiments that follow. All Operations by Transmission of Spirits, and
Imagination haue this; That they Worke at Distance, and not at Touch;
And they are these being distinguished.</p>
<p>The First is the Transmission or Emission, of the Thinner, and more
Airy Parts of Bodies; As in Odours, and Infections; And this is, of all
the rest, the most Corporeall. But you must remember withall, that there
be a Number of those Emissions, both Wholesome, and Vnwholesome, that
giue no Smell at all: For the Plague, many times, when it is taken,
giueth no Sent at all: And there be many Good and Healthfull Aires, that
doe appeare by Habitation, and other Proofes, that differ not in Smell
from other Aires. And vnder this Head, you may place all Imbibitions of
Aire, where the Substance is Materiall, Odour-like; Whereof some
neuerthelesse are strange, and very suddenly diffused; As the
Alteration, which the Aire receiueth in AEgypt, almost immediately, vpon
the Rising of the Riuer of Nilus, whereof we haue spoken.</p>
<p>The Second is the Transmission or Emission of those Things that wee
call Spirituall Species; As Visibles, and Sounds: The one whereof wee
haue handled; And the other we shall handle in due place. These moue
swiftly, and at great distance; But then they require a Medium well
disposed; And their Transmission is easily stopped.</p>
<p>The Third is the Emissions, which cause Attraction of Certaine Bodies
at Distance; Wherein though the Loadstone be commonly placed in the
First Ranke, yet we thinke good to except it, and referre it to another
Head: But the Drawing of Amber, and let, and other Electricke Bodies;
And the Attraction in Gold of the Spirit of Quick-Siluer, at distance;
And the Attraction of Heat at distance; And that of Fire to Naphtha; And
that of some Herbs to Water, though at distance; And diuers others; We
shall handle, but yet not vnder this present Title, but vnder the Title
of Attraction in generall.</p>
<p>The Fourth is the Emission of Spirits, and Immateriate Powers and
Vertues, in those Things, which worke by the Vniuersall Configuration,
and Sympathy of the World; Not by Formes, or Colestiall Influxes, (as is
vainly caught and receiued,) but by the Primitiue Nature of Matter, and
the Seeds of Things. Of this kinde is, (as we yet suppose,) the Working
of the Load-Stone, which is by Consent with the Globe of the Earth: Of
this Kinde is the Motion of Grauity, which is by Consent of De-se
Bodies, with the Globe of the Earth: Of this kinde is some Disposition
of Bodies to Rotation, and particularly from East to West: Of which
kinde we conceiue the Maine Float and Re-float of the Sea is, which is
by Consent of the Vniuerse, as Part of the Diurnall Motion. These I —
teriate Vertues haue this Property differing from Others; That the
Diuersity of the Medium hindreth them not; But they passe through all
Mediums; yet at Determinate distances. And of these we shall speake, as
they are incident to seuerall Titles.</p>
<p>The Fifth is the Emissions of Spirits; And this is the Principall in
our Intention to handle now in this Place Namely, the Operation of the
Spirits of the Minde of Man, vpon other Spirits: And this is of a Double
Nature: The Operations of the Affections, if they be Vehement; And the
Operation of the Imagination, if it be Strong. But these two are so Conp
— d, as we shall handle them together: For when an E — io-, or Am-ro —
Aspect doth infect the Spirits of Another, there is Ioyned both
Affection, and Imagination.</p>
<p>The Sixth is, the Influxes of the Hea — ly Bodies, besides those two
Manifest Oues, of Heat, and Light. But these we will handle, where we
handle the C-lestiall Bodies, and Motions.</p>
<p>The Seuenth is the Operations of Sympathy; Which the Writers of
Naturall Magicke haue brought into an Art, or Precept: And it is this;
That if you desire to Super-induce, any Vertue or Disposition, vpon a
Person, you should take the Liuing Creature, in which that Vertue is
most Emine — , and in Perfection: Of that Creature you must take the
Parts, wherein that Virtue chiefly is Collecate: Againe, you must take
those Parts, in the Time, and Act, when that Vertue is most in Exercise;
And then you must apply it to that Part of Man, wherein that Vertue
chiefly Consisteth. As if you would Super-induce Courage and Fortitude,
take a Lion, or a Coche; And take the Heart, Teeth, or Paw of the Lion;
Or the Heart, or Spurre of the Cocke: Take those Parts immediately after
the Lion, or the Cocke haue beene in Fight; And let them be worne, vpon
a Mans Heart, or Wrest. Of these and such like Sympathies, we shall
speake vnder this present Title.</p>
<p>The Eighth and last is, an Emission of Immateriate Vertues; Such as
we are a little doubtfull to Propound; It is so predigious: But that it
is so conste-ly a-ouched by many: And wee hour set it downe, as a Law to
our Selues, to examine things to the Bottome; And not to receiue vpon
Credit, or reiect vpon Improbabilities, vntill there hath passed a due
Examination. This is, the Sympathy of Indiuiduals: For as there is a
Sympathy of Species; So, (it may be) there is a Sympathy of Indiuiduals:
That is, that in Things, or the Parts of Things, that haue beene once
Contiguous, or Entire, there should remaine a Transmission of Vertue,
from the One to the Other: As betweene the Weapon, and the Wound.
Whereupon is blazed abroad the Operation of Vnguentum Teli: And so of a
Peece of Lard, or Sticke of Elder, andandandandc. that if Part of it be
Consumed or Putrified, it will worke vpon the other Part Seuered. Now
wee will pursue the Instances themselues.</p>
<p>The Plague is many times taken without Manifest Sense, as hath beene
said. And they report, that where it is found, it hath a Sent, of the
Smell of a Mellow Apple; And (as some say) of May-Flowers: And it is
also receiued, that Smels of Flowers, that are Mellow and Lushious, are
ill for the Plague; As White Lillies, Cowslips, and Hyacinths.</p>
<p>The Plague is not easily receiued by such, as continually are about
them, that haue the Plague; As Keepers of the Sicke, and Physitians; Nor
againe by such as take Antidotes, either Inward, (as Mithridate;
InniperBerries; Rue, Leafe and Seed; andandandandc.) Or Outward, (as
Angelica, Zedoary, and the like, in the Mouth; Tarre, Galbanum, and the
like, in Perfume;) Nor againe by Old People, and such as are of a Dry
and Cold Complexion. On the other side, the Plague taketh soonest hold
of those, that come out of a Fresh Aire; And of those that are Fasting;
And of Children; And it is likewise noted to goe in a Bloud, more than
to a Stranger.</p>
<p>The most Pernicious Infection, next the Plague, is the Smell of the
Iayle; When Prisoners haue beene Long, and Close, and Nastily kepti
Whereof we haue had, in our time, Experience, twice or thrice; when both
the Iudges that sate vpon the Iayle, and Numbers of those that attended
the Businesse, or were present, Sickned vpon it, and Died. Therfore it
were good wisdome, that in such Cases, the Iayle were Aired, before they
be brought forth.</p>
<p>Out of question, if such Foule Smels be made by Art, and by the Hand,
they consist chiefly of Mans Flesh, or Sweat, Putrified; For they are
not those Stinckes, which the Nosthrils streight abhorre, and expell,
that are most Pernicious; But such Aires, as haue some Similitude with
Mans Body; And so insinuate themselues, and betray the Spirits. There
may be great danger, in vsing such Compositions, in great Meetings of
People, within Houses; As in Churches; At Arraignments; At Playes and
Solemnities; And the like; For Poysoning of Aire is no lesse dangerous
than Poysoning of Water; Which hath beene vsed by the Turkes in the
Warres; And was vsed by Emanuel Commenus towards the Christians, when
they passed thorow his Countrey to the Holy Land. And these
Empoisonments of Aire, are the more dangerous in Meetings of People;
Because the much Breath of People, doth further the Reception of the
Infection: And therefore, where any such Thing is feared, it were good,
those Publique Places were perfumed, before the Assemblies.</p>
<p>The Empoysonment of Particular Persons, by Odours, hath beene
reported to be in Perfumed Gloues, or the like: And it is like, they
Mingle the Poyson that is dexdly, with some Smels that are Sweet, which
also maketh it the sooner receiued. Plagues also haue been raised by
Annointings of the Chinckes of Doores, and the like; Nor so much by the
Touch, as for that it is common for Men, when they finde any thing Wet
vpon their Fingers, to put them to their Nose; Which Men therefore
should take heed how they doe. The best is, that these Compositions of
Infectious Aires, cannot be made without Danger of Death, to them that
make them. But then againe, they may haue some Antidotes to saue
themselues, So that Men ought not to be secure of it.</p>
<p>There haue beene, in diuers Countries, great Plagues, by the
Putrefaction, of great Swarmes of Grasse-Hoppers, and L-custs, when they
haue beene dead, and cast vpon Heaps.</p>
<p>It hapneth oft in Mines, that there are Damps, which kill, either by
Suffocation, or by the Poysonous Nature of the Minerall: And those that
deale much in Refining, or other Workes about Metals, and Minerals, haue
their Braines Hurt and Stupefied by the Metalline Vapours. Amongst
which, it is noted, that the Spirits of Quick-Siluer, euer fly to the
Skull, Teeth, or Bones; In so much as Gilders vse to haue a Peece of
Gold in their Mouth, to draw the Spirits of the Quick-Siluer; Which Gold
afterwards they finde to be Whintened. There are also certaine Lakes,
and Pits, such as that of Anernus, that Poyson Birds, (as is said,)
which fly ouer them; Or Men, that stay too long about them.</p>
<p>The Vapour of Char-Code, or Sea-Coale, in a Close Roome, hath killed
many: And it is the more dangerous, because it commeth without any Tll
Smell; But stealeth on by little and little; Enducing only a F — nesse,
without any Manifest Strangling. When the Dutch-Men Wintred at Noua
Zembla, and that they could gather no more Stickes, they fell to make
Fire of some Sea-Coale they had, wherewith (at first) they were much
refreshed; But a little after they had sit about the Fire, there grew a
Generall Silence, and lothnesse to speake amongst them; And immediately
after, One of the Weakest of the Company, fell downe in a Swoune;
Whereupon they doubting what it was, opened their doore, to let in Aire,
and so saued themselues. The Effect (no doubt) is wrought by the
Inspissation of the Aire; And so of the Breath, and Spirits. The like
ensueth in Roomes newly Plastered, if a Fire be made in them; Whereof no
lesse Man than the Emperour Ioninianus Died.</p>
<p>Vide the Experiment, 803. touching the Infectious Nature of the Aire,
vpon the First Showers, after long Drought.</p>
<p>It hath come to passe, that some Apothecaries, vpon Stamping of
Coloquintida, haue beene put into a great Sk — ring, by the Vapour
onely.</p>
<p>It hath beene a Practise, to burne a Pepper, they call Ginny-Pepper;
Which hath such a strong Spirit, that it prouoketh a Continuall
Sneezing, in those that are in the Roome.</p>
<p>It is an Ancient Tradition, that Bleare-Byes infect Sound-Eyes; And
that a Menstruous Woman, looking vpon a Glasse, doth rust it. Nay they
haue an Opinion, which seemeth Fabulous; That Menstruous Women, going
ouer a Field, or Garden, doe Corne and Herbes good by Killing the
Wormes.</p>
<p>The Tradition is no lesse Ancient, that the Bafiliske killeth by
Aspect; And that the Wolfe, if he see a Man first, by Aspect striketh a
Man hoarse.</p>
<p>Perfumes Conuenient doe dry and strengthen the Braine; And stay
Rbeumes and Defluxions; As we finde in Fame of Rose-Mary dryed, and
Lignum Aloës, and Calamus, taken at the Mouth, and Nosthrils; And no
doubt there be other Perfumes, that doe moisten, and refresh; And are
fit to be vsed in Burning Agues, Consumptions, and too much
Wakefulnesse; Such as are, Rose-Water, Vinegar, Limon-Pills, Violets,
the Leanes of Vines sprinckled with a little Rose-Water,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>They doe vse in Sudden Faintings, and Swonnings, to put a
Handkerchiefe with Rose Water, or a Little Vinegar, to the Nose; Which
gathereth together againe the Spirits, which are vpon point to resolue,
and fall away.</p>
<p>Tobacco comforteth the Spirits, and dischargeth Wearinesse; Which it
worketh partly by Opening; But chiefly by the Opiate Vertue, which
condenseth the Spirits. It were good therefore to try the Taking of
Fumes by Pipes, (as they doe in Tobacco,) of other Things; As well to
dry, and comfort, as for other Intentions. I wish Triall be made of the
Drying Fume, of Rose-Mary, and Lignum Aloës, before mentioned, in Pipe;
And so of Nutmeg, and Folium Indum; andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Following of the Plough, hath been approued, for Refreshing the
Spirits, and Procuring Appetite: But to doe it in the Ploughing for
Wheat, or Rye, is not so good; Because the Earth hath spent her Sweet
Breath, in Vegetables, put forth in Summer. It is better therefore to
doe it, when you sow Barley. But because Ploughing is tied to Seasons,
it is best to take the Aire of the Earth, new turned vp, by Digging with
the Spade; Or Standing by him that Diggeth. Gentlewomen may doe
themselues much good by kneeling vpon a Cushion, and Weeding. And these
Things you may practise in the best Seasons; Which is euer the Early
Spring. before the Earth putteth forth the Vegetables; And in the
Sweetest Earth you can chuse. It would be done also, when the Dew is a
little off the Ground, lest the Vapour be too Moist. I knew a great Man,
that liued Long, who had a Cleane Clod of Earth, brought to him euery
Morning, as he sate in his Bed; And he would hold his Head ouer it, a
good pretty while. I Commend also, sometimes, in Digging of New Earth,
to poure in some Malmesey, or Greeke Wine; That the Vapour of the Earth,
and Wine together, may comfort the Spirits, the more; Prouided alwaies,
it be not taken, for a Heathen Sacrifice, or Libation to the Earth.</p>
<p>They haue, in Physicke, Vse of Pomanders, and Knots of Powders, for
Drying of Rheumes, Comforting of the Heart, Prouking of Sleepe,
andandandandc. For though those Things be not so Strong as Perfumes, yet
you may haue them continually in your Hand; whereas Perfumes you can
take but at Times; And besides, there be diuers Things, that breath
better of themselues, than when they come to the Fire; As Nigella
Romana, the Seed of Melanthium, A-o-num, andandandandc.</p>
<p>There be two Things, which (inwardly vsed) doe Coole and condense the
Spirits; And I wish the same to be tried outwardly in Vapours. The One
is Nitre, which I would haue dissoluted in Malmesey, or GreekeWine, and
so the Smell of the Wine taken; Or if you would haue it more forcible,
poure of it vpon a Fire-pan, well heated, as they doe Rose-Water, and
Vinegar. The other is, the Distilled Water of Wilde Poppy; which I wish
to be mingled, at halfe, with Rose-Water, and so taken with some Mixture
of a few Clones, in a Perfuming-Pan. The like would be done with the
Distilled Water of Saffron Flowers.</p>
<p>Smells of Muske, and Amber, and Ciuit, are thought to further
Venereous Appetite: Which they may doe by the Refreshing and Calling
forth of the Spirits.</p>
<p>Incense, and Nidorous Smells, (such as were of Sacrifices,) were
thought to Intoxicate the Braine, and to dispose Men to Deuotion: Which
they may doe, by a kinde of Sadnesse, and Contristation of the Spirits:
And partly also by Heating, and Exalting them. Wee see, that amongst the
Iewes, the Principall Perfume of the Sanctuary, was forbidden all Common
Vses.</p>
<p>There be some Perfumes, prescribed by the Writers of Naturall
Magicke, which procure Pleasant Dreames; And some others, (as they say,)
that procure Propheticall Dreames; As the Seeds of Flax, Fleawort,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that Odours doe, in a small Degree, Nourish;
Especially the Odour of Wine: And we see Men a hungred, doe loue to
smell Hot Bread. It is related, that Democritus, when he lay a dying,
heard a Woman, in the House, complaine, that she should be kept from
being at a Feast, and Solemnity, (which she much desired to see,)
because there would be a Corps in the House; Whereupon he caused Loaues
of New Bread to be sent for, and opened them; And powred a little Wine
into them; And so kept himselfe aliue with the Odour of them, till the
Feast was past. I knew a Gentleman, that would fast (sometimes) three or
foure, yea fiue dayes, without Meat, Bread, or Drinke; But the same Man
vsed to haue continually, a great Wispe of Herbes, that he smelled on:
And amongst those Herbes, some Esculent Herbs of strong Sent; As Onions,
Garlicke, Leekes, and the like.</p>
<p>They doe vse, for the Accident of the Mother, to burne Feathers, and
other Things of Ill Odour: And by those Ill Smells, the Rising of the
Mother is put downe.</p>
<p>There be Aires, which the Physitians aduise their Patients to remoue
vnto, in Consumptions, or vpon Recouery of Long Sicknessess Which
(commonly) are Plaine Champaignes, but Grasing, and not Ouen-growne with
Heath, or the like: Or else Timber-Shades, as in Forrests, and the like.
It is noted also, that Groues of Bayes doe forbid Pestilent Aires; Which
was accounted a great Cause of the Wholesome Aire of Antiochia. There be
also some Soyles that put forth Odorate Herbes of themselues; As Wilde
Thyme; Wilde Maioram; Penny-Roiall; Camomill; And in which the
BriarRoses smell almost like Muske-Roses; Which (no doubt) are Signes
that doe discouer an Excellent Aire.</p>
<p>It were good for Men, to thinke of hauing Healthfull Aire, in their
Houses; Which will neuer be, if the Roomes be Low-roosed, or full of
Windowes, and Doores; For the one maketh the Aire Close, and not Fresh;
And the other maketh it Exceeding Vnequall; Which is a great Enemy to
Health. The Windowes also should not be high vp to the Roofe, (which is
in vse for Beauty, and Magnificence,) but Low. Also Stone-Walls are not
wholesome; But Timber is more wholesome; And especially Brick. Nay it
hath beene vsed by some, with great Successe, to make their Walls
thicke; And to put a Lay of Chalke betweene the Brickes, to take away
all Dampishnesse.</p>
<p>These Emissions, (as we said before,) are handled, and ought to be
handled, by themselues, vnder their Proper Titles: That is, Visibles,
and Andibles, each a-part: In this Place, it shall suffice to giue some
generall Obseruations, Common to both. First, they seeme to be
Incorporeall. Secondly, they Worke Swiftly. Thirdly, they Worke at Large
Distances. Fourthly, in Curious Varieties. Fifthly, they are not
Effectiue of any Thing; Nor leaue no Worke behinde them; But are
Energies meerely; For their Working vpon Mirrours, and Places of Eccho,
doth not alter any Thing in those Bodies; But it is the same Action with
the Originall, onely Repercussed. And as for the Shaking of windowes, or
Rarefying the Aire by Great Noyses; And the Heat caused by
Burning-Glasses; They are rather Concomitants of the Andible, and
Visible Species, than the Effects of them. Sixthly, they seeme to be
ofso Tender, and Weake a Nature, as they affect onely such a Rare, and
Attenuate Substance, as is the spirit of Liuing Creatures.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in some Stories, that where Children haue been
Exposed, or taken away young from their Parents; And that afterwards
they haue approached to their Parents presence, the Parents, (though
they haue not knowne them,) haue had a Secret Ioy, or Other Alteration
thereupon.</p>
<p>There was an AEgyptian South-Sayer, that made Anthonius beleeue, that
his Genius, (which otherwise was Braue, and Confident,) was, in the
Presence of Octanianus Caesar, Poore, and Cowardly: And therefore, he
aduised him, to absent himselfe, (as much as he could,) and remoue far
from him. This South-Sayer was thought to be suborned by Cleopatra, to
make him liue in AEgypt, and other Remote Places from Rome. Howsouer the
Conceit of a Perdominant or Mastering Spirit, of one Man ouer Another,
is Ancient, and Receiued still, euen in Vulgar Opinion.</p>
<p>There are Conceits, that some Men, that are of an Ill, and Melancholy
Nature, doe incline the Company, into which they come, to be Sad; and
Ill disposed; And contrariwise, that Others, that are of a Iouiall
Nature, doe dispose the Company to be Merry and Cheerefull. And againe,
that some Men are Lucky to be kept Company with, and Employed; And
Others Vnlucky. Certninly, it is agreeable to Reason, that there are, at
the least, some Light Effluxions from Spirit to Spirit, when Men are in
Presence one with another, as well as from Body to Body.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, that Old Men, who haue loued Toung Company,
and beene Conuersant continually with them, haue beene of Long Life;
Their Spirits, (as it seemeth,) being Recreated by such Company. Such
were the Ancient Sophists, and Rhetoricians; Which euer had Young
Auditours, and Disciples; As Gorgias, Protagoras, Isocrates,
andandandandc. Who liued till they were an Hundred yeares Old. And so
likewise did many of the Grammarians, and Schoole-Masters; such as was
Orbilius, andandandandc.</p>
<p>Audacity and Confidence doth; in Ciuill Businesse, so great Effects,
as a Man may (reasonably) doubt, that besides the very Daring, and
Earnestnesse, and Persisting and Importunity, there should be some
Secret Binding, and Stooping of other Mens Spirits, to such Persons.</p>
<p>The Affections (no doubt) doe make the Spirits more Powerfull, and
Actiue; And especially those Affections, which draw the Spirits into the
Eyes: Which are two: Loue, and Enuy, which is called Oculus Malus. As
for Loue, the Platonists, (some of them,) goe so farre, as to hold that
the Spirit of the Louer, doth passe into the Spirits, of the Person
Loued; Which causeth the desire of Returne into the Body, whence it was
Emitted: Whereupon followeth that Appetite of Contact, and Coninuction.
which is in Louers. And this is obserued likewise, that the Aspects that
procure Loue, are not Gazings, but Sudden Glances, and Dartings of the
Eye. As for Enuy, that emitteth some Maligne and Poysonous Spirit, which
taketh hold of the Spirit of Another; And is likewise of greatest Force,
when the Cast of the Eye is Oblique. It hath beene noted also, that it
is most Dangerous, when an Enuious Eye is cast vpon Persons in Glory,
and Triumph, and Ioy. The Reason whereof is, for that, at such times,
the Spirits come forth most, into the Outward Parts, and so meet the
Percussion of the Enuious Eye, more at Hand: And therefore it hath beene
noted, that after great Triumphs, Men haue beene ill disposed, for some
Daies following. We see the Opinion of Fascination is Ancient, for both
Effects; Of Procuring Loue; And Sicknesse caused by Envy: And
Fascination is euer by the Eye. But yet if there be any such Infection
from Spirit to Spirit, there is no doubt, but that it worketh by
Presence, and not by the Eye alone; Yet most Forcibly by the Eye.</p>
<p>Feare, and Shame, are likewise Infection; For we see that the
Starting of one will make another ready to Start: And when one Man is
out of Conntenance in a Company, others doe likewise Blush in his
behalfe.</p>
<p>Now we will speake of the Force of Imagination vpon other Bodies; And
of the Meanes to Exalt and Strengthen it. Imagination, in this Place, I
vnderstand to be, the Representation of an Indiuiduall Thought.
Imagination is of three Kinds: The First Ioyned with Beleefe of that
which is to Come: The Second Ioyned with Memory of that which is Past:
And the Third is of Things Present, or as if they were Present; For I
comprehend in this, Imaginations Faigned, and at Pleasure; As if one
should Imagine such a Man to be in the Vestments of a Pope; Or to haue
Wings. I single out, for this time, that which is with Faith, or Beleefe
of that which is to Come. The Inquisition of this Subiect, in our way,
(which is by Induction,) is wonderfull hard; for the Things that are
reported, are full of Fables; And New Experiments can hardly be made,
but with Extreme Caution, for the Reason which wee will hereafter
declare.</p>
<p>The Power of Imagination is in three Kindes; The First, vpon the Body
of the Imaginant; Including likewise the Childe in the Mothers Wombe;
The Second is, the Power of it vpon Dead Bodies, as Plants, Wood, Stone,
Metall, andandandandc. The Third is, the Power of it, vpon the Spirits
of Men, and Liuing Creatures: And with this last we will onely
meddle.</p>
<p>The Probleme therefore is, whether a Man Constantly and Strongly
Beleeuing, that such a Thing shall be; (As that such an One will Loue
Him; Or that such an One will Grant him his Request; Or that such an One
shall Recouer a Sicknesse; Or the like;) It doth helpe any thing to the
Effecting of the Thing it selfe. And here againe we must warily
distinguish; For it is not meant, (as hath beene partly said before,)
that it should helpe by Making a Man more Stout, or more Industrious;
(In which kinde a Constant Beleefe doth much;) But meerely by a Secret
Operation, or Binding, or Changing the Spirit of Another: And in this it
is hard, (as we began to say,) to make any New Experiment; For I cannot
command my Selfe to Beleeue what I will, and so no Triall can be made.
Nay it is worse; For whatsoeuer a Man Imagineth doubtingly, or with
Feare, must needs doe hurt, if Imagination haue any Power at all; For a
Man representeth that oftner, that he feareth, than the contrary.</p>
<p>The Helpe therefore is, for a Man to worke by Another, in whom he may
Create Beleefe, and not by Himselfe; Vntill Himselfe haue found by
Experience, that Imagination doth preuaile; For then Experience worketh
in Himselfe Beleefe; If the Beleefe, that such a Thing shall be, be
ioyned with a Beleefe, that his Imagination may procure it.</p>
<p>For Example; I related one time to a Man, that was Curious, and Vaine
enough in these Things; That I saw a Kinds of Iugler, that had a Paire
of Cards, and would tell a Man what Card he thought. This Pretended
Learned Man told me; It was a Mistaking in Me; For (said he) it was not
the Knowledge of the Mans Thought, (for that is Proper to God,) but it
was the Inforcing of a Thought vpon him, and Binding his Imagination by
a Stronger, that he could Thinke no other Card. And thereupon he asked
me a Question, or two, which I thought he did but cunningly, knowing
before what vsed to be the Feats of the Iugler. Sir, (said hee,) doe you
remember whether he told the Card, the Man thought, Himselfe, or bade
Another to tell it. I answered (as was true;) That be bade Another tell
it. Whereunto he said; so I thought: For (said he) Himselfe could not
haue put on so strong an Imagination; But by telling the other the Card,
(who beleeued that the Iugler was some Strange Man, and could doe
Strange Things,) that other Man caught a strong Imagination. I harkened
vnto him, thinking for a Vanity he spoke prettily. Then he asked me
another Question: Saith he; Doe you remember, whether he had the Man
think the Card first, and afterwards told the other Man in his Eare,
what he should thinke, Or else that he did whisper first in the Mans
Eare, that should tell the Card, telling that such a Man should thinke
such a Card, and after bade the Man thinke a Card? I told him, as was
true; That he did first whisper the Man in the Eare, that such a Man
should thinke such a Card: Vpon this the Learned Man did much Exult, and
Please himselfe, saying; Loe, you may see that my Opinion is right: For
if the Man had: thought first, his Thought had beene Fixed; But the
other Imagining first, bound his Thought. Which though it did somewhat
sinke with mee, yet I made it Lighter than I thought, and said; I
thought it was Confederacy, betweene the Iugler, and the two Seruants:
Though (Indeed) I had no Reason so to thinke: For they were both my
Fathers Seruants; And he had neuer plaid in the House before. The Iugler
also did cause a Garter to be held vp; And tooke vpon him, to know, that
such a One, should point in such a Place, of the Garter; As it should be
neare so many Inches to the Longer End, and so many to the Shorter; And
still he did it, by First Telling the Imaginer, and after Bidding the
Actour Thinke.</p>
<p>Hauing told this Relation, not for the Weight thereof, but because it
doth handsomely open the Nature of the Question; I returne to that I
said; That Experiments of Imagination, must be practised by Others, and
not by a Mans Selfe. For there be Three Meanes to fortifie Beleefe: The
First is Experience: The Second is Reason: And the Third is Authoritie:
And that of these, which is farre the most Potent, is Authoritie: For
Beleefe vpon Reason, or Experience, will Stagger.</p>
<p>For Authoritie, it is of two Kindes; Beleefe in an Art; And Beleefe
in a Man. And for Things of Beleefe in an Art; A Man may exercise them
by Himselfe; But for Beleefe in a Man, it must be by Another. Therfore,
if a Man beleeue in Astrologie, and finde a Figure Prosperous; Or
beleeue in Naturall Magicke, and that a Ring with such a Stone, or such
a Peece of a Liuing Creature, Carried, will doe good; It may helpe his
Imagination: But the Beleefe in a Man is farre the more Actiue. But
howsoeuer, all Authoritie must be out of a Mans Selfe, turned (as was
said,) either vpon an Art, or vpon a Man: And where Authoritie is from
one Man to another, there the Second must be Ignorant, and not Learned,
or Full of Thoughts; And such are (for the most part) all Witches, and
Superstitious Persons; Whose Beleefes, tied to their Teachers, and
Traditions, are no whit controlled, either by Reason, or Experience: And
vpon the same Reason, in Magicke, they vse (for the most part,) Boyes,
and Young People; whose Spirits easiliest take Beleefe, and
Imagination.</p>
<p>Now to fortifie Imagination, there be three Wayes: The Authoritie
whence the Beleefe is deriued; Meanes to Quicken and Corroborate the
Imagination; And Meanes to Repeat it, and Refresh it.</p>
<p>For the Authoritie, wee haue already spoken: As for the Second;
Namely the Meanes to Quicken, and Corroborate the Imagination; Wee see
what hath beene vsed in Magicke; (If there be in those Practises any
thing that is purely Naturall;) As Vestments; Characters; Words; Seales;
Some Parts of Plants, or Liuing Creatures; Stones; Choice of the Houre;
Gestures and Motions; Also Incenses, and Odours; Choice of Societie,
which increaseth Imagination; Diets and Preparations for some time
before. And for Words, there haue beene euer vsed, either Barbarous
Words, of no Sense, lest they should disturbe the Imagination; Or Words
of Similitude, that may second and feed the Imagination: And this was
euer as well in Heathen Charmes, as in Charmes of latter Times. There
are vsed also Scripture-Words; For that the Beleefe, that Religious
Texts, and Words, haue Power, may strengthen the Imagination: And for
the same Reason, Hebrew Words, (which amongst vs is counted the Holy
Tongue, and the Words more Mysticall,) are often vsed.</p>
<p>For the Refreshing of the Imagination, (which was the Third Meanes of
Exalting it;) Wee see the Practises of Magicke, as in Images of Wax,</p>
<p>and the like, that should Melt by little, and little; Or some other
Things Buried in Mucke, that should Putrifie by little and little; Or
the like: For so oft as the Imaginant doth thinke of those Things, so
oft doth he represent to his Imagination, the Effect of that he
desireth.</p>
<p>If there be any Power in Imagination, it is lesse credible, that it
should be so Incorporcall and Immateriate a Vertue, as to worke at great
Distances; Or through all Mediums Or vpon all Bodies: But that the
Distance must be Competent; The Medium not Aduerse; And the Body Apt and
Proportionate. Therefore if there be any Operation vpon Bodies, in
Absence, by Nature; it is like to be conueyed from Man to Man, as Fame
is; As if a Witch, by Imagination, should hurt any afarre off, it cannot
be naturally, but by Working vpon the Spirit of some, that commeth to
the Witch; And from that Party vpon the Imagination of Another; And so
vpon Another; till it come to one that hath resort to the Party
Intended; And so by Him to the Party intended himselfe. And although
they speake, that it sufficeth, to take a Point, or a Peece of the
Garment, or the Name of the Party, or the like; yet there is lesse
Credit to be giuen to those Things, except it be by Working of euill
Spirits.</p>
<p>The Experiments, which may certainly demonstrate the Power of
Imagination, vpon other Bodies, are few, or none: For the Experiments of
Witchcraft, are no cleare Proofes; For that they may be, by a Tacite
Operation of Maligne Spirits: We shall therefore be forced, in this
Enquire, to resort to New Experiments: Wherein wee can giue only
Directions of Trialls, and not any Positiue Experiments. And if any Man
thinke, that wee ought to haue staied, till wee had made Experiment, of
some of them, our selues, (as wee doe commonly in other Titles,) the
Truth is, that these Effects of Imagination vpon other Bodies, haue so
little Credit with vs, as we shall trie them at leisure: But in the
meane Time, we will lead others the way.</p>
<p>When you worke by the Imagination of Another, it is necessary, that
He, by whom you worke, haue a Precedent Opinion of you, that you can doe
Strange Things; Or that you are a Man of Art, as they call it; For else
the Simple Affirmation to Another, that this or that shall be, can worke
but a weake Impression, in his Imagination.</p>
<p>It were good, because you cannot discerne fully of the Strength of
Imagination, in one Man more than another, that you did vse the
Imagination of more than One; That so you may light vpon a Strong One.
As if a Physitian should tell Three, or Foure, of his Patients Seruants,
that their Master shall surely recouer.</p>
<p>The Imagination of One, that you shall vse, (such is the Variety of
Mens Mindes,) cannot be alwaies alike Constant, and Strong; And if the
Successe follow not speedily, it will faint and leese Strength. To
remedy this, you must pretend to Him, whose Imagination you vse,
seuerall Degrees of Meanes, by which to Operate; As to prescribe him,
that euery three Dayes, if he finde not the Successe Apparent, he doe
vse another Root, or Part of a Beast, or Ring, andandandandc. As being
of more Force; And if that faile, Another; And if that, Another; till
Seuen Times. Also you must prescribe a good Large Time for the Effect
you promise; As if you should tell a Seruant of a Sick-Man, that his
Master shall recouer, but it will be Fourteene daies, eare he findeth it
apparently, andandandandc. All this to entertaine the Imagination, that
it wauer lesse.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that Potions, or Things taken into the Body: Incenses
and Perfumes taken at the Nosthrills; And Ointments of some Parts; doe
(naturally) worke vpon the Imagination of Him that taketh them. And
therefore it must needs greatly Cooperate with the Imagination of him,
whom you vse, if you presribe him, before he doe vse the Receit, for the
Worke which he desireth, that he doe take such a Pill, or a Spoonefull
of Liquour, Or burne such an Incense; Or Annoint his Temples, or the
Soles of his Feet, with such an Ointment, or Oyle: And you must chuse,
for the Composition of such Pill, Perfume, or Ointment, such
Ingredients, as doe make the Spirits, a little more Grosse, or Muddy:
Whereby the Imagination will fix the better.</p>
<p>The Body Passiue, and to be Wrought Vpon, (I meane not of the
Imaginant,) is better wrought vpon, (as hath beene partly touched,) at
some Times, than at other: As if you should prescribe a Seruant, about a
Sick Person, (whom you haue possessed, that his Master shall recouer,)
when his Master is fast asleepe, to vse such a Root, or such a Root. For
Imagination is like to worke better vpon Sleeping Men, than Men Awake,
As wee shall shew when we handle Dreames.</p>
<p>We finde in the Art of Memory, that Images Visible, worke better than
other Conceits: As if you would remember the Word Philosophy, you shall
more surely doe it, by Imagining that such a Man, (For Men are best
Places,) is reading vpon Aristotles Physickes; Than if you should
Imagine him to say; I’le goe study Philosophy. And therefore, this
Obseruation would be translated to the Subiect wee now speake of: For
the more Lustrous the Imagination is, it filleth and fixeth the better.
And therefore I conceiue, that you shall, in that Experiment, (whereof
wee spake before,) of Binding of Thoughts, lesse faile, if you tell One,
that such an One shal name one of Twenty Men, than if it were One of
Twenty Cards. The Experiment of Binding of Thoughts, would be
Diuersified, and tried to the Full: And you are to note, whether it hit
for the most part, though not alwaies.</p>
<p>It is good to consider, vpon what Things, Imagination hath most
Force: And the Rule, (as I conceiue,) is, that it hath most Force vpon
Things, that haue the Lightest, and Easiest Motions. And therefore aboue
all, vpon the Spirits of Men: And in them, vpon such Affections, as moue
Lightest; As vpon Procuring of Loue; Binding of Lust, which is euer with
Imagination; vpon Men in Feare; Or Men in Irresolution; And the like.
Whatsoeuer is of this kinde would be throughly enquired. Trialls
likewise would be made vpon Plants. and that diligently: As if you
should tell a Man, that such a Tree would Dye this yeare; And will him,
at these and these times, to goe vnto it, to see how it thriueth. As for
In — imate Things, it is true, that the Mount of Shuffling of Cards, or
Casting of Dice, are very Light Motions; And there is a Folly very
vsuall, that Gamesters imagine, that some that stand by them, bring them
ill Lucke. There would be Triall also made, of holding a Ring by a
Threed in a Glasse, and telling him that holdeth it, before, that it
shall strike so many times against the Side of the Glasse, and no more;
Or of Holding a Key betweene two Mens Fingers, without a Charme; And to
tell those that hold it, that at such a Name, it shall goe off their
Fingers: For these two are Extreme Light Motions. And howsoeuer I haue
no Opinion of these things, yet so much I conceiue to be true; That
Strong Imagination hath more Force vpon Things Liuing, Or that haue,
been Liuing, than Things meerely Inauimate; And more Force likewise vpon
Light, and Subtill Motions, than vpon Motions Vehement, or
P-nderous.</p>
<p>It is an vsuall Obseruation, that if the Body of One Murthered, be
brought before the Murtherer, the Wounds will bleed a-fresh, Some doe
affirme, that the Dead Body, vpon the Presence of the Murtherer, hath
opened the Eyes; And that there haue beene such like Motions, as well
where the Party Murthered hath beene Strengled, or Drew-ed, as where
they haue beene Killed by Wounds, It may be, that this participateth of
a Miracle, by Gods Iust Iudgement, who vsually bringeth Murthers to
Lights But if it be Naturall, it must be referred to Imagination.</p>
<p>The Tying of the Point vpon the day of Mariage, to make Men Impotent
towards their Wiues, which (as we haue formerly touched,) is so frequent
in Zant, and Gascony, if it be Naturall, must be referred to the
Imagination of Him that Tieth the Point. I conceiue it to haue the lesse
Affinity with Witchcraft, because not Peculiar Persons onely, (such as
Witches are,) but any Body may doe it.</p>
<p>There be many Things that worke vpon the Spirits of Man, by Secret
Sympathy, and Antipathy; The Vertues of Pretious Stones worne, haue
beene anciently and generally Receiued: And curiously assigned to Worke
seuerall Effects. So much is true; That Stones haue in them fine
Spirits; As appeareth by their Splendour: And therefore they may worke
by Consort vpon the Spirits of Men, to Comfort, and Exhilarate them.
Those that are the best, for that Effect, are the Diamond. the Emerald,
the Iacinth Orientall, and the Gold-Stone, which is the Yellow Topaze.
As for their particular Proprieties, there is no Credit to be giuen to
them. But it is manifest, that Light, aboue all things, excelleth in
Comforting the Spirits of Men: And it is very probable, that Light
Varied doth the same Effect, with more Nouelty. And this is one of the
Causes, why Pretious Stones comfort. And therefore it were good to haue
Tincted Lanthornes. or Tincted Skreenes, of Glasse Coloured into Greene,
Blew, Carnation, Crimson, Purple, andandandandc. And to vse them with
Candles in the Night. So likewise to haue Round Glasses, not onely of
Glasse Coloured thorow, but with Colours laid betweene Crystals, with
Handles to hold in ones Hand. Prismes are also Comfortable Things. They
haue of Paris-Worke, Looking-Glasses, bordered with broad Borders of
small Crystall, and great Counterfete Pretious Stones, of all Colours,
that are most Glorious and Pleasant to behold; Especially in the Night.
The Pictures of Indian Feathers, are likewise Comfortable, and Pleasant
to behold. So also Faire and Cleare Pooles doe greatly comfort the Eyes,
and Spirits; Especially when the Sunne is not Glaring, but Ouercast; Or
when the Moone shineth.</p>
<p>There be diuers Sorts of Bracelets fit to Comfort the Spirits; And
they be of Three Intentions: Refrigerant; Corroborant; and Aperient. For
Refrigerant, I wish them to be of Pearle, or of Corall, as is vsed: And
it hath beene noted that Corall, if the Party that weareth it be ill
disposed, will wax Pale: Which I beleeue to be true, because otherwise
Distemper of Heat will make Corall lose Colour. I Commend also Beads, or
little Plates of Lapis Lazuli; And Beads of Nitre, either alone, or with
some Cordiall Mixture.</p>
<p>For Corroboration and Confortation, take such Bodies as are of
Astringent Quality, without Manifest Cold. I commend Bead-Amber; which
is full of Astriction, but yet is Vnctuous, and not Cold; And is
conceiued to Impinguate those that weare such Beads: I commend also,
Beads of HartsHorne, and Iuory, which are of the like Nature; Also
Orenge-Beads; Also Beads of Lignum Aloës, Macerated first in Rose-Water,
and Dryed.</p>
<p>For Opening, I Commend Beads, or Peeces of the Roots of Cardius
Benedictus: Also of the Roots of Piony the Male; And of Orris; And of
Calamus Aromaticus; And of Rew.</p>
<p>The Crampe, (no doubt,) commeth of Contraction of Sinnewes; Which is
Manifest, in that it commeth either by Cold, or Drinesse; As after
Consumptions, and Long Agues: For Cold and Drinesse doe (both of them)
Contract, and Corrugate. We see also, that Chasing a little aboue the
Place in paine, easeth the Crampe; Which is wrought by the Dilatation,
of the Contracted Sinnewes, by Heat. There are in vse, for the
Preuention of the Crampe, two Things; The one Rings of Sea Horse Teeth,
worne vpon the Fingers; The other Bands of Greene Periwinckle, (the
Herbe,) tied about the Calfe of the Leg, or the Thigh, andandandandc.
where the Crampe vseth to come. I doe finde this the more strange,
because Neither of these haue any Relaxing Vertue, but rather the
Contrary. I iudge therefore, that their Working, is rather vpon the
Spirits, within the Nerues, to make them striue lesse; Than vpon the
Bodily Substance of the Nerues.</p>
<p>I would haue Triall made of two other Kindes of Bracelets, for
Comforting the Heart, and Spirits; The one of the Trechisch of Vipers,
made into little Peeces of Beads; For since they doe great Good Inwards,
(especially for Pestilent Agues, it is like they will be Effectuall
Outwards; Where they may be applied in greater Quantity. There would be
Trochish likewise made of Snakes; Whose Flesh dried, is thought to haue
a very Opening, and Cordiall Vertue. The other is, of Beads made of the
Scarlet Powder, which they call Kermes; Which is the Principall
Ingredient in their Cordiall Confection Alkermes: The Beads would be
made vp with AmberGrice, and some Pomander.</p>
<p>It hath beene long receiued, and confirmed by diuers Trialls; That
the Root of the Male-Piony, dried, tied to the Necke, doth helpe the
Falling-Sicknesse; And likewise the Incubus, which wee call the Mare.
The Cause of both these Diseases, and especially of the Epilepsie from
the Stomach, is the Grossenesse of the Vapours, which rise and enter
into the Cells of the Braine: And therfore the Working is, by Extreme,
and Subtill Attenuations; Which that Simple hath. I iudge the like to be
in Castoreum, Muske, Rew-Seed, Agnus Castus Seed, andandandandc.</p>
<p>There is a Stone, which they call the Bloud-Stone, which worne is
thought to be good for them that Bleed at the Nose: Which (no doubt) is
by Astriction, and Cooling of the Spirits. Quare, if the Stone taken out
of the Toads Head, be not of the like Vertue? For the Toade loueth
Shade, and Coolenesse.</p>
<p>Light may be taken from the Experiment of the Horse-Tooth-Ring, and
the Garland of Periwinckle, how that those things, which asswage the
Strife of the Spirits, doe helpe diseases, contrary to the Intention
desired: For in the Curing of the Crampe, the Intention is to relax the
Sinnewes; But the Contraction of the Spirits, that they striue lesse, is
the best Helpe: So to procure easie Tranailes of Women, the Intention is
to bring downe the Childe; But the best Helpe is, to stay the Comming
downe too Fast: Whereunto they say, the Toad-Stone likewise helpeth. So
in Pestilent Feaners, the Intention is to expell the Intection by Sweat,
and Enapouration; But the best Meanes to doe it, is by Nitre,
Diascordium, and other Coole Things, which doe for a time arrest the
Expulsion, till Nature can doe it more quietly. For as one faith
prettily; In the Quenching of the Flame of a Pestilent Ague, Nature is
like People, that come to quench the Fire of a House; which are so
busie, as one of them letteth another. Surely, it is an Excellent
Axiome, and of Manifold Vse, that whasoeuer appeaseth the Contention of
the Spirits, furthereth their Action.</p>
<p>The Writers of Naturall Magick, commend the Wearing of the Spoile of
a Snake, for Preseruing of Health; I doubt it is but a Conceit; For that
the Snake is thought to renue her Touth, by Casting her Spoile. They
might as well take the Beake of an Eagle, or a Peece of a Harts-Horne,
because those Renue.</p>
<p>It hath beene Anciently Receiued, (For Pericles the Athenian vsed
it,) and it is yet in vse, to weare little Bladders of Quick-Siluer, or
Tablets of Arsenicke, as Preseruatines against the Plague: Not as they
conceiue, for any Comfort they yeeld to the Spirits, but for that being
Poysons themselues, they draw the Venome to them, from the Spirits.</p>
<p>Vide the Experiments 95.96. and 97. touching the Seuerall Sympathies,
and Antipathies, for Medicinall Vse.</p>
<p>It is said, that the Guts or Skin of a Wolfe being applyed to the
Belly, doe cure the Cholicke. It is true, that the Wolfe is a Beast of
great Edacity, and Disgestion; And so, it may be, the Parts of him
comfort the Bowels.</p>
<p>We see Scare-Crowes, are set vp to keep Birds from Corne, and Fruit;
It is reported by some, that the Head of a Wolfe, whole, dried, and
hanged vp in a Done-House, will scare away Vermine; Such as are Weasils,
Polcats, and the like. It may be, the Head of a Dog will doe as much;
For those Vermine with vs, know Dogs better than Wolues.</p>
<p>The Braines of some Creatures, (when their Heads are roasted) taken
in Wine, are said to strengthen the Memory: As the Braines of Hares;
Braines of Hens; Braines of Deeres, andandandandc. And it seemeth, to be
incident to the Braines of those Creatures, that are Fearefull.</p>
<p>The Ointment, that Witches vse, is reported to be made, of the Fat of
Children, digged out of their Granes; Of the Iuyees of Smallage,
Wolfebane, and Cinquefoile; Mingled with the Meale of fine Wheat. But I
suppose that the Soperiferous Medicines are likest to doe it; Which are
Henbane, Hemlocke, Mandrake, Moone-Shade, Tabacco, Opium, Saffron,
PoplarLeaues, andandandandc.</p>
<p>It is reported by some, that the Affections of Beasts, when they are
in Strength, doe adde some Vertue, vnto Inanimate Things; As that the
Skin of a Sheepe, deuoured by a Wolfe, moueth Itching; That a Stone,
bitten by a Dog in Anger, being throwne at him, drunke in Powder,
prouoketh Choler.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, that the Diet of Women with Childe, doth
worke much vpon the Infant; As if the Mother eat Quinces much, and
Coriander-Seed, (the Nature of both which is to represse and stay
Vapours, that ascend to the Braine,) it will make the Childe Ingenious:
And on the contrary side, if the Mother eat (much) Onions, or Beanes, or
such Vapourous Food; Or drinke Wine, or Strong Drinke, immoderately; Or
Fast much; Or be giuen to much Musing; (All which send, or draw Vapours
to the Head,) It endangereth the Childe to become Lunaticke, or of
Ionperfect Memory: And I make the same Iudgement of Tobacco, often taken
by the Mother.</p>
<p>The Writers of Naturall Magicke report, that the Heart of an Ape,
worne neare the Heart, comforteth the Heart, and increaseth Audacity. It
is true, that the Ape is a Merry and Bold Beast. And that the same Heart
likewise of an Ape, applied to the Necke, or Head, helpeth the Wit; And
is good for the Falling-Sicknesse: The Ape also is a Witty Beast, and
hath a Dry Braine; Which may be some Cause of Attenuation of Vapours in
the Head. Yet it is said to moue Dreames also. It may be, the Heart of a
Man would doe more, but that is more against Mens Mindes to vse it;
Except it be in such as weare the Reliques of Saints.</p>
<p>The Flesh of a Hedge-Hog, Dressed, andandandand Eaten, is said to be
a great Drier: It is true, that the Iuyce of a Hedge-Hog, must needs be
Harsh, and Dry, because it putteth forth so many Prickles: For Plants
also, that are full of Prickles, are generally Dry: As Briars, Thornes,
Berberries: And therefore the Ashes of a Hedge-Hog are said to be a
great Desiccatiue of Fistula’s.</p>
<p>Mummy hath great force in Stanching of Bloud; which, as it may be
ascribed to the Mixture of Balmes, that are Glutinous; So it may also
partake of a Secret Propriety; In that the Bloud draweth Mans Flesh. And
it is approued, that the Mosse, which groweth vpon the Skull of a Dead
Men, vnburied, will stanch Bloud potently. And so doe the Dregs, or
Powder of Bloud, seuered from the Water, and Dried.</p>
<p>It hath beene practised, to make White Swallowes, by Annointing of
the Egs with Oyle. Which Effect may be produced, by the Stopping of the
Pores of the Shell, and making the Iuyce, that putteth forth the
Feathers afterwards, more Penurious. And it may be, the Annointing of
the Egs, will be as Effectuall, as the Annointing of the Body; Of which
Vide the Experiment 93.</p>
<p>It is reported, that the White of an Egge, or Bloud, mingled with
Salt-Water, doth gather the Saltnesse, and maketh the Water sweeter.
This may be by Adhesion; As in the 6. Experiment of Clarification: It
may be also, that Bloud, and the White of an Egge, (which is the Malter
of a Liuing Creature,) haue some Sympathy with Salt: For all Life hath a
Sympathy with Salt. We see that Salt, laid to a Cut Finger, healeth it;
So as it seemeth Salt draweth Bloud, as well as Bloud draweth Salt.</p>
<p>It hath beene anciently receiued, that the Sea-Hare, hath an
Antipathy with the Lungs, (if it commeth neare the Body,) and erodeth
them. Where of the Cause is conceiued to be, a Quality it hath of
Heating the Brath, and Spirits; As Cantharides haue vpon the Watery
Parts of the Body; As -ine and Hydro-icall Water. And it is a good Rule,
that whatsoeuer hath an Operation vpon certaine Kindes of Matters, that,
in Mars Body; worketh most vpon those Parts, wherein that kinde of
Matter — .</p>
<p>Generally, that which is Dead, or Corrapted, or Excerned, hath
Antipathy with the same Thing, when it is Aliue, and when it is Sound;
And with those Parts which doe Excerne: As a Carkasse of Man is most
Infectious, and Odious to Man; A Carrion of an Horse to an Horse,
andandandandc. Puro — Matter of Wounds, and Vlcers, Car — ctes, Pockes,
Scabs, Leprousie, to Sound Flesh; And the Excrement of euery Species to
that Creature that Externeth them. But the Excrements are lesse
Per-icious than the Corruptions.</p>
<p>It is a Common Experience, that Dog know the Dog-Killer; When as in
times of Infection. some Petty F —— — is sent out to kill the Dogges;
And that, though they haue neuer seene him before; yet they will all
come forth, and barke, and fly at him.</p>
<p>The Relutions touching the Force of — , and the Secret — of Nature
are so vncertaine, as they require a great deale of Examination, ere —
conclude vpon them. I would haue it first throughly inquired, whether
there be any Secret Passages of Sympathy, betweene Persons of neare
Bloud; As Parents, Children, Brothers, Sisters, NurseChildren, Husbands,
Wiues, andandandandc. There be many Reports in Historie, that vpon the
Death of Persons of such Nearenesse, Men haue had an inward Feeling of
it. I my Selfe remember, that being in Paris, and my Father dying in
London, two or three dayes before my Fathers death, I had a Dreame,
which I told to diuers English Gentlemen; That my Fathers House, in the
Countrey, was Plastered all ouer with Blacke Mortar. There is an Opinion
abroad, (whether Idle or no I cannot say,) That louing and kinde
Husbands, haue a Sense of their Wiues Breeding Childe, by some Accident
in their owne Body.</p>
<p>Next to those that are Neare in Bloud, there may be the like Passage,
and Instincts of Nature, betweene great Friends, and Enemies: And
sometimes the Reucaling is vnto Another Person, and not to the Party
Himselfe. I remember Philippus Commineus, (a graue Writer,) reporteth;
That the Arch-Bishop of Vienna, (a Reuerend l’relate,) said (one day)
after Masse, to King Lewis the eleuenth of France; Sir, your Mortall
Enemie is dead; What time Duke Charles of Burgundie was Slaine, at the
Battell of Granson, against the Switzers. Some triall also would be
made, whether Pact or Agreement doe any thing; As if two Friends should
agree, that such a Day in euery Weeke, they being in farre Distant
Places, should Pray one for Another; Or should put on a Ring, or Tablet,
one for anothers Sake; Whether if one of them should breake their Vow
and Promise, the other should haue any Feeling of it, in Absence.</p>
<p>If there be any Force in Imaginations and Affections of Singular
Persons; It is Probable the Force is much more in the Ioynt Imaginations
and Affections of Multitudes: As if a Victorie should be won, or lost,
in Remote Parts, whether is there not some Sense thereof, in the People
whom it concerneth; Because of the great Ioy, or Griefe, that many Men
are prossest with, at once? Pius Quintus, at the very time, when that
Memorable Victorie was won, by the Christians, against the Turks, at the
Nauall Battell of Lepanto, being then hearing of Causes in Consistorie,
brake off suddenly, and said to those about him; It is now more time, we
should giue thanks to God, for the great Victorie he hath granted vs,
against the Turks. It is true, that Victorie had a Sympathie with his
Spirit; For it was meerely his Worke, to conclude that League. It may
be, that Reuelation was Diuine; But what shall wee say then, to a Number
of Examples, amongst the Grecians, and Romans? Where the People, being
in Theaters at Playes, haue had Newes of Victories, and Ouerthrowes,
some few dayes, before any Messenger could come.</p>
<p>It is true, that that may hold in these Things, which is the generall
Root of Superstition; Namely, that Men obserue when Things Hit, and not
when they Misse: And commit to Memory the one, And forget and passe ouer
the other. But touching Diuination, and the Misgiuing of Mindes, wee
shall speake more, when wee handle in generall, the Nature of Mindes,
and Soules, and Spirits.</p>
<p>Wee haue giuen formerly some Rules of Imgination; And touching the
Fortifying of the Same. Wee haue set downe also some few Instances, and
Directions, of the Force of Imagination, vpon Beasts, Birds,
andandandandc. vpon Plants; And vpon Inanimate Bodies: Wherein you must
still obserue, that your Trialls be vpon Subtill and Light Motions, and
not the contrary; For you will sooner, by Imagination, binde a Bird from
Singing, than from Eating, or Flying: And I leaue it to euery Man, to
choose Experiments, which himself thinketh most Commodious; Giuing now
but a few Examples of euery of the Three Kindes.</p>
<p>Vse some Imaginant, (obseruing the Rules formerly prescribed,) for
Binding of a Bird from Singing; And the like of a Dogge from Barking.
Trie also the Imagination of some, whom you shall accommodate with
things to fortifie it, in Cocke-Fights, to make one Cocke more Hardy,
and the other more Cowardly. It would be tried also, in Flying of
Hawkes; Or in Coursing of a Deere, or Hare, with Grey-hounds; Or in
Horse-Races; And the like Comparatiue Motions: For you may sooner by
Imagination, quicken or slacke a Motion, than raise or cease it; As it
is easier to make a Dogge goe slower, than to make him stand still that
he may not run.</p>
<p>In Plants also, you may trie the Force of Imagination, vpon the
Lighter Sort of Motions: As vpon the Sudden Fading, or Liuely Comming vp
of Herbs; Or vpon their Bending one way, or other; Or vpon their
Closing, and Opening; andandandandc.</p>
<p>For Inanimate Things, you may trie the Force of Imagination, vpon
Staying the Working of Beere, when the Barme is put in; Or vpon the
Comming of Butter, or Cheese, after the Cherming, or the Rennet bee put
in.</p>
<p>It is an Ancient Tradition, euery where alleaged, for Example of
Secret Proprieties and Influxes, that the Torpede Marina, if it be
touched with a long Stick, doth stupefie the Hand of him that toucheth
it. It is one degree of Working at Distance, to worke by the Continuance
of a Fit Medium; As Sound will be conueyed to the Eare, by striking vpon
a Bow-String, if the Horne of the Bow be held to the Eare.</p>
<p>The Writers of Naturall Magicke, doe attribute much to the Vertues,
that come from the Parts of Liuing Creatures; So as they be taken from
them, the Creatures remaining still aliue: As if the Creature still
liuing did infuse some Immateriate Vertue, and Vigour, into the Part
Seuered. So much may be true; that any Part, taken from a Liuing
Creature, newly Slaine, may be of greater force, than if it were taken
from the like Creature dying of it Selfe, because it is fuller of
Spirit.</p>
<p>Triall would be made, of the like Parts of Indiuidualls, in Plants,
and Liuing Creatures; As to cut off a Stocke of a tree; And to lay that,
whith you cut off, to Putrifie, to see whether it will Decay the Rest of
the Stocke: Or if you should cut off part off the Taile, or Legge of a
Dogge, or a Cat, and lay it to Putrifie, and so see whether it will
Fester, or keepe from Healing, the Part which remaineth.</p>
<p>It is receiued, that it helpeth to Continue Loue, if one weare a
Ring, or a Bracelet, of the Haire of the Party Beloued. But that may be
by the Exciting of the Imagination: And perhaps a Gloue, or other like
Fauour, may as well doe it.</p>
<p>The Sympathie of Indiuiduals, that haue beene Entire, or haue
Touched, is of all others the most Incredible: Yet according vnto our
faithfull Manner of Examination of Nature, wee will make some little
mention of it. The Taking away of Warts, by Rubbing them with Somewhat
that afterwards is put to waste, and consume, is a Common Experiment:
And I doe apprehend it the rather, because of mine owne Experience. I
had, from my Childhood, a Warts, vpon one of my Fingers: Afterwards when
I was about Sixteene Yeeres old, being then at Paris, there grew vpon
both my Hands a Number of Warts, (at the least an hundred,) in a Moneths
Space. The English Embassadours Lady, who was a Woman farre from
Superstition, told me, one day; She would helpe me away with my Warts:
Whereupon she got a Peece of Lard, with the Skin on, and rubbed the
Warts all ouer, with the Fat Side; And amongst the rest that Wart, which
I had had from my Childhood; Then she uailed the Peece of Lord, with the
Fat towards the Sunne, vpon a Poast of her Chamber Window, which was to
the South, The Successe was, that within fiue weekes space, all the
Warts went quite away: And that Wart, which I had so long endured, for
Company. But at the rest I did little maruell, because they came in a
Short time, and might goe away in a Short Time againe: But the Going
away of that, which had staid so long, doth yet sticke with mee. They
say the like is done, by the Rubbing of Warts with a Greene Elder
Sticke, and then Burying the Sticke to Rot in Mucke. It would be tried,
with Cornes, and Wenns, and such other Excrescences. I would haue it
also tried, with some Parts of Liuing Creatures, that are nearest the
Nature of Excrescences; As the Combes of Cocks, the Spurres of Cocks,
the Hornes of Beasts, andandandandc. And I would haue it tried both
wnyes; Both by Rubbing those Parts with Lord, or Elder, as before; And
by Cutting off some Peece of those Parts, and laying it to Consume; To
see whether it will Worke any Effect, towards the Consumption of that
Part, which was once Ioyned with it.</p>
<p>It is constantly Receiued, and touched, that the Anointing of the
Weapon, than maketh the Wound, will heale the Wound it selfe. In this
Experiment, vpon the Relation of Men of Credit, (though my selfe, as
yet, am not fully inclined to beleoue it,) you shall note the Points
following. First the Ointment, wherewith this is done, is made of Diuers
Ingredients; whereof the Strangest and Hardest to come by, are the Mosse
vpon the Skull of a dead Men, Vnburied; And the Fats of a Beare, and a
Beare, killed in the Act of Generation. These two last I could easily
suspect to be prescribed at a Starting Hole; That if the Experiment
proued not, it mouight be pretended, that the Beasts were not killed in
the due Time; For as for the Mosse, it is certaine, there is great
Quantitie of it in Ireland, vpon Slaine Bodies, laid on Heaps, Vnburied.
The other Ingredients are, the Bloud-Stone in Powder, and some other
Things, which seeme to haue a Vertue to Stanch Bloud; As also the Mosse
hath. And the Description of the Whole Ointment is to be found in the
Chymicall Dispensatorie of Crollius. Secondly, the same Kinde of
Ointment, applied to the Hurt it selfe, worketh not the Effect; but only
applied to the Weapon. Thirdly, (which I like well) they doe not obserue
the Confecting of the Ointment, vnder any certaine Constellation; which
commonly is the Excuse of Magicall Medicines, when they faile, that they
were not made vnder a fit Figure of Heauen. Fourthly, it may be applied
to the Weapon, though the Party Hurt be at great Distance. Fifthly, it
seemeth the Imagination of the Party, to be Cured, is not needfull to
Concurre; For it may be done, without the Knowledge, of the Party
Wounded; And thus much hath beene tried, that the Ointment (for
Experiments sake,) hath beene wiped off the Weapon, without the
knowledge of the Party Hurt, and presently the Party Hurt, hath beene in
great Rage of Paine, till the Weapon was Reannointed. Sixthly, it is
affirmed, that if you cannot get the Weapon, yet if you put an
Instrument of Iron, or Wood, resembling the Weapon, into the Wound,
whereby it bleedeth, the Annointing of that Instrument will serue, and
worke the Effect. This I doubt should be a Deuice, to keepe this strange
Forms of Cure, in Request, and Vse; Because many times you cannot come
by the Weapon it selfe. Seuenthly, the Wound must be at first Washed
cleans, with White Wine, or the Parties owne Water; And then bound vp
close in Fine Linnen, and no more Dressing renewed, till it be whole.
Eighthly, the Sword it selfe must be Wrapped vp Close, as farre as the
Ointment goeth, that it taketh no Wind. Ninthly, the Ointment, if you
wipe it off from the Sword, and keepe it, will Serue againe; and rather
Increase in Vertue, than Diminish. Tenthly, it will Cure in farte
Shorter Time, than Ointments of Wounds commonly doe. Lastly, it will
Cure a Beast, as well as a Man; which I like best of all the rest,
because it subiecteth the Matter, to an Easie Triall.</p>
<p>I would haue Men know, that though I reprehend, the Easie Passing
ouer, of the Causes of Things, by Ascribing them to Secret and Hidden
Vertues, and Proprieties; (For this hath arrested, and laid asleepe, all
true Enquiry, and Indications;) yet I doe not vnderstand, but that in
the Practicall Part of Knowledge, much will be left to Experience, and
Probation, whereunto Indication cannot so fully reach: And this not
onely in Specie, but in Indiuiduo. So in Physicke, if you will cure the
Iaundies, it is not enough to say, that the Medicine must not be
Cooling; For that will hinder the Opening which the Disease requireth:
That it must not be Hot; For that will exasperate Choler: That it must
goe to the Gall; For there is the Obstruction which causeth the Disease,
andandandandc. But you must receiue from Experience, that Powder of
Chamapytis, or the like, drunke in Beere, is good for the Iaundies: So
againe, a wise Physitian doth not continue still the same Medicine, to a
Patient; But he will vary, if the first Medicine doth not apparently
succeed; For of those Remedies, that are good for the Iaundies, Stone,
Agues, andandandandc. that will doe good in one Body, which will not doe
good in Another; According to the Correspondence the Medicine hath to
the Indiuduall Body.</p>
<p>The Delight which Men haue in Popularity, Fame, Honour, Submission,
and Subiection of other Mens Mindes, Wills, or Affections, (although
these Things may be desired for other Ends,) seemeth to be a Thing, in
it selfe, without Contemplation of Consequence, Gratefull andandandand
agreeable to the Nature of Man. This Thing (surely) is not without some
Signification, as if all Spirits and Soules of Men, came forth out of
one Diuine Limbus; Else why should Men be so much affected with that,
which others thinke, or say? The best Temper of Mindes desireth Good
Name, and True Honour: The Lighter, Popularity, and Applause; The more
depraued, Subiection, and Tyranny; As is seene in great Conquerours, and
Troublers of the World: And yet more in Arch-Heretickes; for the
Introducing of new Doctrines, is likewise an Affectation of Tyranny,
ouer the Vnderstandings, and Beleefes of Men.</p>
