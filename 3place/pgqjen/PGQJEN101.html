<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Poesy is a part of learning in measure of words, for the most
part restrained, but in all other points extremely licensed, and doth
truly refer to the imagination; which, being not tied to the laws of
matter, may at pleasure join that which nature hath severed, and sever
that which nature hath joined, and so make unlawful matches and divorces
of things — Pictoribus atque poetis, andandandandc. It is taken in two
senses in respect of words or matter. In the first sense, it is but a
character of style, and belongeth to arts of speech, and is not
pertinent for the present. In the latter, it is — as hath been said —
one of the principal portions of learning, and is nothing else but
feigned history, which may be styled as well in prose as in
verse.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of this feigned history hath been to give some shadow of
satisfaction to the mind of man in those points wherein the nature of
things doth deny it, the world being in proportion inferior to the soul;
by reason whereof there is, agreeable to the spirit of man, a more ample
greatness, a more exact goodness, and a more absolute variety, than can
be found in the nature of things. Therefore, because the acts or events
of true history have not that magnitude which satisfieth the mind of
man, poesy feigneth acts and events greater and more heroical. Because
true history propoundeth the successes and issues of actions not so
agreeable to the merits of virtue and vice, therefore poesy feigns them
more just in retribution, and more according to revealed Providence.
Because true history representeth actions and events more ordinary and
less interchanged, therefore poesy endueth them with more rareness and
more unexpected and alternative variations. So as it appeareth that
poesy serveth and conferreth to magnanimity, morality and to
delectation. And therefore, it was ever thought to have some
participation of divineness, because it doth raise and erect the mind,
by submitting the shows of things to the desires of the mind; whereas
reason doth buckle and bow the mind unto the nature of things. And we
see that by these insinuations and congruities with man’s nature and
pleasure, joined also with the agreement and consort it hath with music,
it hath had access and estimation in rude times and barbarous regions,
where other learning stood excluded.</p></li>
<li><p>The division of poesy which is aptest in the propriety thereof
(besides those divisions which are common unto it with history, as
feigned chronicles, feigned lives, and the appendices of history, as
feigned epistles, feigned orations, and the rest) is into poesy
narrative, representative, and allusive. The narrative is a mere
imitation of history, with the excesses before remembered, choosing for
subjects commonly wars and love, rarely state, and sometimes pleasure or
mirth. Representative is as a visible history, and is an image of
actions as if they were present, as history is of actions in nature as
they are (that is) past. Allusive, or parabolical, is a narration
applied only to express some special purpose or conceit; which latter
kind of parabolical wisdom was much more in use in the ancient times, as
by the fables of AEsop, and the brief sentences of the seven, and the
use of hieroglyphics may appear. And the cause was (for that it was then
of necessity to express any point of reason which was more sharp or
subtle than the vulgar in that manner) because men in those times wanted
both variety of examples and subtlety of conceit. And as hieroglyphics
were before letters, so parables were before arguments; and nevertheless
now and at all times they do retain much life and rigour, because reason
cannot be so sensible nor examples so fit.</p></li>
<li><p>But there remaineth yet another use of poesy parabolical,
opposite to that which we last mentioned; for that tendeth to
demonstrate and illustrate that which is taught or delivered, and this
other to retire and obscure it — that is, when the secrets and mysteries
of religion, policy, or philosophy, are involved in fables or parables.
Of this in divine poesy we see the use is authorised. In heathen poesy
we see the exposition of fables doth fall out sometimes with great
felicity: as in the fable that the giants being overthrown in their war
against the gods, the earth their mother in revenge thereof brought
forth Fame:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Illam terra parens, ira irritat Deorum,</p>
<p>Extremam, ut perhibent,</p>
<p>Coeo Enceladoque soroem,</p>
<p>Progenuit.”</p>
<p>Expounded that when princes and monarchs have suppressed actual and
open rebels, then the malignity of people (which is the mother of
rebellion) doth bring forth libels and slanders, and taxations of the
states, which is of the same kind with rebellion but more feminine. So
in the fable that the rest of the gods having conspired to bind Jupiter,
Pallas called Briareus with his hundred hands to his aid: expounded that
monarchies need not fear any curbing of their absoluteness by mighty
subjects, as long as by wisdom they keep the hearts of the people, who
will be sure to come in on their side. So in the fable that Achilles was
brought up under Chiron, the centaur, who was part a man and part a
beast, expounded ingeniously but corruptly by Machiavel, that it
belongeth to the education and discipline of princes to know as well how
to play the part of a lion in violence, and the fox in guile, as of the
man in virtue and justice. Nevertheless, in many the like encounters, I
do rather think that the fable was first, and the exposition devised,
than that the moral was first, and thereupon the fable framed; for I
find it was an ancient vanity in Chrysippus, that troubled himself with
great contention to fasten the assertions of the Stoics upon the
fictions of the ancient poets; but yet that all the fables and fictions
of the poets were but pleasure and not figure, I interpose no opinion.
Surely of these poets which are now extant, even Homer himself
(notwithstanding he was made a kind of scripture by the later schools of
the Grecians), yet I should without any difficulty pronounce that his
fables had no such inwardness in his own meaning. But what they might
have upon a more original tradition is not easy to affirm, for he was
not the inventor of many of them.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>In this third part of learning, which is poesy, I can report no
deficience; for being as a plant that cometh of the lust of the earth,
without a formal seed, it hath sprung up and spread abroad more than any
other kind. But to ascribe unto it that which is due, for the expressing
of affections, passions, corruptions, and customs, we are beholding to
poets more than to the philosophers’ works; and for wit and eloquence,
not much less than to orators’ harangues. But it is not good to stay too
long in the theatre. Let us now pass on to the judicial place or palace
of the mind, which we are to approach and view with more reverence and
attention.</li>
