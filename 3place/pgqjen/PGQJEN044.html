<p>Cupid, or an Atom Explained of the Corpuscular Philosophy</p>
<p>THE particulars related by the poets of Cupid, or Love, do not
properly agree to the same person; yet they differ only so far, that if
the confusion of persons be rejected, the correspondence may hold. They
say, that Love was the most ancient of all the gods, and existed before
everything else, except Chaos, which is held coeval therewith. But for
Chaos, the ancients never paid divine honours, nor gave the title of a
god thereto. Love is represented absolutely without progenitor,
excepting only that he is said to have proceeded from the egg of Nox;
but that himself begot the gods, and all things else on Chaos. His
attributes are four; viz,, 1. perpetual infancy; 2. blindness; 3.
nakedness; and 4. archery.</p>
<p>There was also another Cupid, or Love, the youngest son of the gods,
born of Venus; and upon him the attributes of the elder are transferred,
with some degree of correspondence.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - This fable points at, and enters, the cradle of love
seems to be the appetite, or incentive, of the primitive matter; or, to
speak more distinctly, the natural motion, or moving principle, of the
original corpuscles, or atoms; this being the most ancient and only
power that made and wrought all things out of matter. It is absolutely
without parent, that is, without cause; for causes are as parents to
effects; but this power or efficacy could have no natural cause; for,
excepting God, nothing was before it; and therefore it could have no
efficient in nature. And as nothing is more inward with nature, it can
neither be a genus nor a form; and therefore, whatever it is, it must be
somewhat positive, though inexpressible. And if it were possible to
conceive its modus and process, yet it could not be known from its
cause, as being, next to God, the cause of causes, and itself without a
cause. And perhaps we are not to hope that the modus of it should fall,
or be comprehended, under human inquiry. Whence it is properly feigned
to be the egg of Nox, or laid in. the dark.</p>
<p>The divine philosopher declares, that “God has made everything
beautiful in its season; and has given over the world to our disputes
and inquiries: but that man cannot find out the work which God has
wrought, from its beginning up to its end.” Thus the summary or
collective law of nature, or the principle of love, impressed by God
upon the original particles of all things, so as to make them attack
each other and come together, by the repetition and multiplication
whereof all the variety in the universe is produced, can scarce possibly
find full admittance into the thoughts of men, though some faint notion
may be had thereof. The Greek philosophy is subtile, and busied in
discovering the material principles of things, but negligent and languid
in discovering the principles of motion, in which the energy and
efficacy of every operation consists. And here the Greek philosophers
seem perfectly blind and childish; for the opinion of the Peripatetics,
as to the stimulus of matter, by privation, is little more than words,
or rather sound than signification. And they who refer it to God, though
they do well therein, yet they do it by a start, and not by proper
degrees of assent; for doubtless there is one summary, or capital law,
in which nature meets, subordinate to God, viz., the law mentioned in
the passage above quoted from Solomon; or the work which God has wrought
from its beginning up to its end.</p>
<p>Democritus, who farther considered this subject, having first
supposed an atom, or corpuscle, of some dimension or figure, attributed
thereto an appetite, dire, or first motion simply, and another
comparatively, imagining that all things properly tended to the centre
of the world; those containing more matter falling faster to the centre,
and thereby removing, and in the shock driving away, such as held less.
But this is a slender conceit, and regards too few particulars; for
neither the revolutions of the celestial bodies, nor the contractions
and expansions of things, can be reduced to this principle. And for the
opinion of Epicurus, as to the declination and fortuitous agitation of
atoms, this only brings the matter back again to a trifle, and wraps it
up in ignorance and night.</p>
<p>Cupid is elegantly drawn a perpetual child; for compounds are larger
things, and have their periods of age; but the first seeds or atoms of
bodies are small, and remain in a perpetual infant state.</p>
<p>He is again justly represented naked; as all compounds may properly
be said to be dressed and clothed, or to assume a personage; whence
nothing remains truly naked, but the original particles of things.</p>
<p>The blindness of Cupid, contains a deep allegory; for this same
Cupid, Love, or appetite of the world, seems to have very little
foresight, but directs his steps and motions conformably to what he
finds next him, as blind men do when they feel out their way; which
renders the divine and overruling Providence and foresight the more
surprising; as by a certain steady law, it brings such a beautiful order
and regularity of things out of what seems extremely casual, void of
design, and, as it were, really blind.</p>
<p>The last attribute of Cupid is archery, viz., a virtue or power
operating at a distance; for everything that operates at a distance, may
seem, as it were, to dart, or shoot with arrows. And whoever allows of
atoms and vacuity, necessarily supposes that the virtue of atoms
operates at a distance; for without this operation, no motion could be
excited, on account of the vacuum interposing, but all things would
remain sluggish and unmoved.</p>
<p>As to the other Cupid, he is properly said to be the youngest sons of
the gods, as his power could not take place before the formation of
species, or particular bodies. The description given us of him transfers
the allegory to morality, though he still retains some resemblance with
the ancient Cupid; for as Venus universally excites the affection of
association, and the desire of procreation, her son Cupid applies the
affection to individuals; so that the general disposition proceeds from
Venus, but the more close sympathy from Cupid. The former depends upon a
near approximation of causes, but the latter upon deeper, more
necessitating and uncontrollable principles, as if they proceeded from
the ancient Cupid, on whom all exquisite sympathies depend.</p>
