<h4 id="authors-preface">Author’s Preface</h4>
<p>Those who have taken upon them to lay down the law of nature as a
thing already searched out and understood, whether they have spoken in
simple assurance or professional affectation, have therein done
philosophy and the sciences great injury. For as they have been
successful in inducing belief, so they have been effective in quenching
and stopping inquiry; and have done more harm by spoiling and putting an
end to other men’s efforts than good by their own. Those on the other
hand who have taken a contrary course, and asserted that absolutely
nothing can be known — whether it were from hatred of the ancient
sophists, or from uncertainty and fluctuation of mind, or even from a
kind of fullness of learning, that they fell upon this opinion — have
certainly advanced reasons for it that are not to be despised; but yet
they have neither started from true principles nor rested in the just
conclusion, zeal and affectation having carried them much too far. The
more ancient of the Greeks (whose writings are lost) took up with better
judgment a position between these two extremes — between the presumption
of pronouncing on everything, and the despair of comprehending anything;
and though frequently and bitterly complaining of the difficulty of
inquiry and the obscurity of things, and like impatient horses champing
at the bit, they did not the less follow up their object and engage with
nature, thinking (it seems) that this very question — viz., whether or
not anything can be known — was to be settled not by arguing, but by
trying. And yet they too, trusting entirely to the force of their
understanding, applied no rule, but made everything turn upon hard
thinking and perpetual working and exercise of the mind.</p>
<p>Now my method, though hard to practice, is easy to explain; and it is
this. I propose to establish progressive stages of certainty. The
evidence of the sense, helped and guarded by a certain process of
correction, I retain. But the mental operation which follows the act of
sense I for the most part reject; and instead of it I open and lay out a
new and certain path for the mind to proceed in, starting directly from
the simple sensuous perception. The necessity of this was felt, no
doubt, by those who attributed so much importance to logic, showing
thereby that they were in search of helps for the understanding, and had
no confidence in the native and spontaneous process of the mind. But
this remedy comes too late to do any good, when the mind is already,
through the daily intercourse and conversation of life, occupied with
unsound doctrines and beset on all sides by vain imaginations. And
therefore that art of logic, coming (as I said) too late to the rescue,
and no way able to set matters right again, has had the effect of fixing
errors rather than disclosing truth. There remains but one course for
the recovery of a sound and healthy condition — namely, that the entire
work of the understanding be commenced afresh, and the mind itself be
from the very outset not left to take its own course, but guided at
every step; and the business be done as if by machinery. Certainly if in
things mechanical men had set to work with their naked hands, without
help or force of instruments, just as in things intellectual they have
set to work with little else than the naked forces of the understanding,
very small would the matters have been which, even with their best
efforts applied in conjunction, they could have attempted or
accomplished. Now (to pause a while upon this example and look in it as
in a glass) let us suppose that some vast obelisk were (for the
decoration of a triumph or some such magnificence) to be removed from
its place, and that men should set to work upon it with their naked
hands, would not any sober spectator think them mad? And if they should
then send for more people, thinking that in that way they might manage
it, would he not think them all the madder? And if they then proceeded
to make a selection, putting away the weaker hands, and using only the
strong and vigorous, would he not think them madder than ever? And if
lastly, not content with this, they resolved to call in aid the art of
athletics, and required all their men to come with hands, arms, and
sinews well anointed and medicated according to the rules of the art,
would he not cry out that they were only taking pains to show a kind of
method and discretion in their madness? Yet just so it is that men
proceed in matters intellectual — with just the same kind of mad effort
and useless combination of forces — when they hope great things either
from the number and cooperation or from the excellency and acuteness of
individual wits; yea, and when they endeavor by logic (which may be
considered as a kind of athletic art) to strengthen the sinews of the
understanding, and yet with all this study and endeavor it is apparent
to any true judgment that they are but applying the naked intellect all
the time; whereas in every great work to be done by the hand of man it
is manifestly impossible, without instruments and machinery, either for
the strength of each to be exerted or the strength of all to be
united.</p>
<p>Upon these premises two things occur to me of which, that they may
not be overlooked, I would have men reminded. First, it falls out
fortunately as I think for the allaying of contradictions and
heartburnings, that the honor and reverence due to the ancients remains
untouched and undiminished, while I may carry out my designs and at the
same time reap the fruit of my modesty. For if I should profess that I,
going the same road as the ancients, have something better to produce,
there must needs have been some comparison or rivalry between us (not to
be avoided by any art of words) in respect of excellency or ability of
wit; and though in this there would be nothing unlawful or new (for if
there be anything misapprehended by them, or falsely laid down, why may
not I, using a liberty common to all, take exception to it?) yet the
contest, however just and allowable, would have been an unequal one
perhaps, in respect of the measure of my own powers. As it is, however
(my object being to open a new way for the understanding, a way by them
untried and unknown), the case is altered: party zeal and emulation are
at an end, and I appear merely as a guide to point out the road — an
office of small authority, and depending more upon a kind of luck than
upon any ability or excellency. And thus much relates to the persons
only. The other point of which I would have men reminded relates to the
matter itself.</p>
<p>Be it remembered then that I am far from wishing to interfere with
the philosophy which now flourishes, or with any other philosophy more
correct and complete than this which has been or may hereafter be
propounded. For I do not object to the use of this received philosophy,
or others like it, for supplying matter for disputations or ornaments
for discourse — for the professor’s lecture and for the business of
life. Nay, more, I declare openly that for these uses the philosophy
which I bring forward will not be much available. It does not lie in the
way. It cannot be caught up in passage. It does not flatter the
understanding by conformity with preconceived notions. Nor will it come
down to the apprehension of the vulgar except by its utility and
effects.</p>
<p>Let there be therefore (and may it be for the benefit of both) two
streams and two dispensations of knowledge, and in like manner two
tribes or kindreds of students in philosophy — tribes not hostile or
alien to each other, but bound together by mutual services; let there in
short be one method for the cultivation, another for the invention, of
knowledge.</p>
<p>And for those who prefer the former, either from hurry or from
considerations of business or for want of mental power to take in and
embrace the other (which must needs be most men’s case), I wish that
they may succeed to their desire in what they are about, and obtain what
they are pursuing. But if there be any man who, not content to rest in
and use the knowledge which has already been discovered, aspires to
penetrate further; to overcome, not an adversary in argument, but nature
in action; to seek, not pretty and probable conjectures, but certain and
demonstrable knowledge — I invite all such to join themselves, as true
sons of knowledge, with me, that passing by the outer courts of nature,
which numbers have trodden, we may find a way at length into her inner
chambers. And to make my meaning clearer and to familiarize the thing by
giving it a name, I have chosen to call one of these methods or ways
Anticipation of the Mind, the other Interpretation of Nature.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have one request to make. I have on my own part made it
my care and study that the things which I shall propound should not only
be true, but should also be presented to men’s minds, how strangely
soever preoccupied and obstructed, in a manner not harsh or unpleasant.
It is but reasonable, however (especially in so great a restoration of
learning and knowledge), that I should claim of men one favor in return,
which is this: if anyone would form an opinion or judgment either out of
his own observation, or out of the crowd of authorities, or out of the
forms of demonstration (which have now acquired a sanction like that of
judicial laws), concerning these speculations of mine, let him not hope
that he can do it in passage or by the by; but let him examine the thing
thoroughly; let him make some little trial for himself of the way which
I describe and lay out; let him familiarize his thoughts with that
subtlety of nature to which experience bears witness; let him correct by
seasonable patience and due delay the depraved and deep-rooted habits of
his mind; and when all this is done and he has begun to be his own
master, let him (if he will) use his own judgment.</p>
