<p>Sphinx, or Science Explained of the Sciences</p>
<p>THEY relate that Sphinx was a monster, variously formed, having the
face and voice of a virgin, the wings of a bird, and the talons of a
griffin. She resided on the top of a mountain, near the city Thebes, and
also beset the highways. Her manner was to lie in ambush and seize the
travellers, and having them in her power, to propose to them certain
dark and perplexed riddles, which it was thought she received from the
Muses, and if her wretched captives could not solve and interpret these
riddles, she with great cruelty fell upon them, in their hesitation and
confusion, and tore them to pieces. This plague having reigned a long
time, the Thebans at length offered their kingdom to the men who could
interpret her riddles, there being no other way to subdue her. Œdipus, a
penetrating and prudent man, though lame in his feet, excited by so
great a reward, accepted the condition, and with a good assurance of
mind, cheerfully presented himself before the monster, who directly
asked him, “What creature that was, which being born four-footed,
afterwards became two-footed, then three-footed, and lastly four-footed
again?” Œdipus, with presence of mind, replied it was man, who, upon his
first birth and infant state, crawled upon all fours in endeavouring to
walk; but not long after went upright upon his two natural feet; again,
in old age walked three-footed, with a stick; and at last, growing
decrepit, lay four-footed confined to his bed; and having by this exact
solution obtained the victory, he slew the monster, and, laying the
carcass upon an ass, led her away in triumph; and upon this he was,
according to the agreement, made king of Thebes.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - This is an elegant, instructive fable, and seems
invented to represent science, especially as joined with practice. For
science may, without absurdity, be called a monster, being strangely
gazed at and admired by the ignorant and unskilful. Her figure and form
is various, by reason of the vast variety of subjects that science
considers; her voice and countenance are represented female, by reason
of her gay appearance, and volubility of speech; wings are added,
because the sciences and their inventions run and fly about in a moment,
for knowledge, like light communicated from one torch to another, is
presently caught and copiously diffused; sharp and hooked talons are
elegantly attributed to her, because the, axioms and arguments of
science enter the mind, lay hold of it, fix it down, and keep it from
moving or slipping away. This the sacred philosopher observed when he
said, “The words of the wise are like goads or nails driven far in.”
Again, all science seems placed on high, as it were on the tops of
mountains that are hard to climb; for science is justly imagined a
sublime and lofty thing, looking down upon ignorance, from an eminence,
and at the same time taking an extensive view on all sides, as is usual
on the top of mountains. Science is said to beset the highways, because
through all the journey and peregrination of human life there is matter
and occasion offered of contemplation.</p>
<p>Sphinx is said to propose various difficult questions and riddles to
men, which she received from the Muses; and these questions, so long as
they remain with the Muses, may very well be unaccompanied with
severity, for while there is no other end of contemplation and inquiry
but that of knowledge alone, the understanding is not oppressed, or
driven to straits and difficulties, but expatiates and ranges at large,
and even receives a degree of pleasure from doubt and variety; but after
the Muses have given over their riddles to Sphinx, that is, to practice,
which urges and impels to action, choice, and determination, then it is
that they become torturing, severe, and trying, and, unless solved and
interpreted, strangely perplex and harass the human mind, rend it every
way, and perfectly tear it to pieces. All the riddles of Sphinx,
therefore, leave two conditions annexed, viz., dilaceration to those who
do not solve them, and empire to those that do. For he who understands
the thing proposed obtains his end, and every artificer rules over his
work.</p>
<p>Sphinx has no more than two kinds of riddles, one relating to the
nature of things, the other to the nature of man; and correspondent to
these, the prizes of the solution are two kinds of empire, the empire
over nature, and the empire over man. For the true and ultimate end of
natural philosophy is dominion over natural things, natural bodies,
remedies, machines, and numberless other particulars, though the
schools, contented with what spontaneously offers, and swollen with
their own discourses, neglect, and in a manner despise, both things and
works.</p>
<p>But the riddle proposed to Œdipus, the solution whereof acquired him
the Theban kingdom, regarded the nature of man; for he who has
thoroughly looked into and examined human nature, may in a manner
command his own fortune, and seems born to acquire dominion and rule.
Accordingly, Virgil properly makes the arts of government to be the arts
of the Romans.] It was, therefore, extremely apposite in Augustus Cæsar
to use the image of Sphinx in his signet, whether this happened by
accident or by design; for he of all men was deeply versed in politics,
and through the course of his life very happily solved abundance of new
riddles with regard to the nature of man; and unless he had done this
with great dexterity and ready address, he would frequently have been
involved in imminent danger, if not destruction.</p>
<p>It is with the utmost elegance added in the fable, that when Sphinx
was conquered, her carcass was laid upon an ass; for there is nothing so
subtile and abstruse, but after being once made plain, intelligible, and
common, it may be received by the slowest capacity.</p>
<p>We must not omit that Sphinx was conquered by a lame man, and
impotent in his feet; for men usually make too much haste to the
solution of Sphinx’s riddles; whence it happens, that she prevailing,
their minds are rather racked and torn by disputes, than invested with
command by works and effects.</p>
