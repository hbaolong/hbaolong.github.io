<p>XProserpine, or Spirit Explained of the Spirit Included in Natural
Bodies</p>
<p>THEY tell us, Pluto having, upon that memorable division of empire
among the gods, received the infernal regions for his share, despaired
of winning any one of the goddesses in marriage by an obsequious
courtship, and therefore through necessity resolved upon a rape. Having
watched his opportunity, he suddenly seized upon Proserpine, a most
beautiful virgin, the daughter of Ceres, as she was gathering narcissus
flowers in the meads of Sicily, and hurrying her to his chariot, carried
her with him to the subterraneal regions, where she was treated with the
highest reverence, and styled the Lady of Dis. But Ceres missing her
only daughter, whom she extremely loved, grew pensive and anxious beyond
measure, and taking a lighted torch in her hand, wandered the world over
in quest of her daughter, but all to no purpose, till, suspecting she
might be carried to the infernal regions, she, with great lamentation
and abundance of tears, importuned Jupiter to restore her; and with much
ado prevailed so far as to recover and bring her away, if she had tasted
nothing there. This proved a hard condition upon the mother, for
Proserpine was found to have eaten three kernels of a pomegranate.
Cares, however, desisted not, but fell to her entreaties and
lamentations afresh, insomuch that at last it was indulged her that
Proserpine should divide the year betwixt her husband and her mother,
and live six months with the one and as many with the other. After this;
Theseus and Perithous, with uncommon audacity, attempted to force
Proserpine away from Pluto’s bed, but happening to grow tired in their
journey, and resting themselves upon a stone in the realms below, they
could never rise from it again, but remain sitting there for ever.
Proserpine, therefore, still continued queen of the lower regions, in
honour of whom there was also added this grand privilege, that though it
had never been permitted any one to return after having once descended
thither, a particular exception was made, that he who brought a golden
bough as a present to Proserpine, might on that condition descend and
return. This was an only bough that grew in a large dark grove, not from
a tree of its own, but like the mistletoe, from another, and when
plucked away a fresh one always shot out in its stead.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - This fable seems to regard natural philosophy, and
searches deep into that rich and fruitful virtue and supply in
subterraneous bodies, from whence all the things upon the earth’s
surface spring, and into which they again relapse and return. By
Proserpine the ancients denoted that ethereal spirit shut up and
detained within the earth, here represented by Pluto, the spirit being
separated from the superior globe, according to the expression of the
poet. This spirit is conceived as ravished, or snatched up by the earth,
because it can no way be detained, when it has time and opportunity to
fly off, but is only wrought together and fixed by sudden intermixture
and comminution, in the same manner as if one should endeavour to mix
air with water, which cannot otherwise be done than by a quick and rapid
agitation, that joins them together in froth whilst the air is thus
caught up by the water. And it is elegantly added, that Proserpine was
ravished whilst she gathered narcissus flowers, which have their name
from numbedness or stupefaction; for the spirit we speak of is in the
fittest disposition to be embraced by terrestrial matter when it begins
to coagulate, or grow torpid as it were.</p>
<p>It is an honour justly attributed to Proserpine, and not to any other
wife of the gods, that of being the lady or mistress of her husband,
because this spirit performs all its operations in the subterraneal
regions, whilst Pluto, or the earth, remains stupid, or as it were
ignorant of them.</p>
<p>The æther, or the efficacy of the heavenly bodies, denoted by Ceres,
endeavours with infinite diligence to force out this spirit, and restore
it to its pristine state. And by the torch in the hand of Ceres, or the
nether, is doubtless meant the sun, which disperses light over the whole
globe of the earth, and if the thing were possible, must have the
greatest share in recovering Proserpine, or reinstating the subterraneal
spirit. Yet Proserpine still continues and dwells below, after the
manner excellently described in the condition betwixt Jupiter and Ceres.
For first, it is certain that there are two ways of detaining the
spirit, in solid and terrestrial matter, - the one by condensation or
obstruction, which is mere violence and imprisonment; the other by
administering a proper alignment, which in spontaneous and free. For
after the included spirit begins to feed and nourish itself; it is not
in a hurry to fly off, but remains as it were fixed in its own earth.
And this is the moral of Proserpine’s tasting the pomegranate; and were
it not for this, she must long ago have been carried up by Ceres, who
with her torch wandered the world over, and so the earth have been left
without its spirit. For though the spirit in metals and minerals may
perhaps be, after a particular manner, wrought in by the solidity of the
mass, yet the spirit of vegetables and animals has open passages to
escape at, unless it be willingly detained, in the way of sipping and
tasting them.</p>
<p>The second article of agreement, that of Proserpine’s remaining six
months with her mother and six with her husband, is an elegant
description of the division of the year; for the spirit diffused through
the earth lives above-ground in the vegetable world during the summer
months, but in the winter returns underground again.</p>
<p>The attempt of Theseus and Perithous to bring Proserpine away,
denotes that the more subtile spirits, which descend in many bodies to
the earth, may frequently be unable to drink in, unite with themselves,
and carry off the subterraneous spirit, but on the contrary be
coagulated by it, and rise no more, so as to increase the inhabitants
and add to the dominion of Proserpine.</p>
<p>The alchemists will be apt to fall in with our interpretation of the
golden bough, whether we will or no, because they promise golden
mountains, and the restoration of natural bodies from their stone, as
from the gates of Pluto; but we are well assured that their theory has
no just foundation, and suspect they have no very encouraging or
practical proofs of its soundness. Leaving, therefore, their conceits to
themselves, we shall freely declare our own sentiments upon this last
part of the fable. We are certain, from numerous figures and expressions
of the ancients, that they judged the conservation, and in some degree
the renovation, of natural bodies to be no desperate or impossible
thing, but rather abstruse and out of the common road than wholly
impracticable. And this seems to be their opinion in the present case,
as they have placed this bough among an infinite number of shrubs, in a
spacious and thick wood. They supposed it of gold, because gold is the
emblem of duration. They feigned it adventitious, not native, because
such an effect is to be expected from art, and not from any medicine or
any simple or mere natural way of working.</p>
