<p>BACON ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND CHANCELLOR.</p>
<p>Thus, at last, at the age of fifty-two, Bacon had gained the place
which Essex had tried to get for him at thirty-two. The time of waiting
had been a weary one, and it is impossible not to see that it had been
hurtful to Bacon. A strong and able man, very eager to have a field for
his strength and ability, who is kept out of it, as he thinks unfairly,
and is driven to an attitude of suppliant dependency in pressing his
claim on great persons who amuse him with words, can hardly help
suffering in the humiliating process. It does a man no good to learn to
beg, and to have a long training in the art. And further, this long
delay kept up the distraction of his mind between the noble work on
which his soul was bent, and the necessities of that “civil” or
professional and political life by which he had to maintain his estate.
All the time that he was “canvassing” (it is his own word) for office,
and giving up his time and thoughts to the work which it involved, the
great Instauration had to wait his hours of leisure; and his
exclamation, so often repeated, Multum incola fuit anima mea, bears
witness to the longings that haunted him in his hours of legal drudgery,
or in the service of his not very thankful employers. Not but that he
found compensation in the interest of public questions, in the company
of the great, in the excitement of state-craft and state employment, in
the pomp and enjoyment of court life. He found too much compensation; it
was one of his misfortunes. But his heart was always sound in its
allegiance to knowledge; and if he had been fortunate enough to have
risen earlier to the greatness which he aimed at as a vantage-ground for
his true work, or if he had had self-control to have dispensed with
wealth and position — if he had escaped the long necessity of being a
persistent and still baffled suitor — we might have had as a completed
whole what we have now only in great fragments, and we should have been
spared the blots which mar a career which ought to have been a noble
one.</p>
<p>The first important matter that happened after Bacon’s new
appointment was the Essex divorce case, and the marriage of Lady Essex
with the favourite whom Cecil’s death had left at the height of power,
and who from Lord Rochester was now made Earl of Somerset. With the
divorce, the beginning of the scandals and tragedies of James’s reign,
Bacon had nothing to do. At the marriage which followed Bacon presented
as his offering a masque, performed by the members of Gray’s Inn, of
which he bore the charges, and which cost him the enormous sum of £2000.
Whether it were to repay his obligations to the Howards, or in lieu of a
“fee” to Rochester, who levied toll on all favours from the King, it can
hardly be said, as has been suggested, to be a protest against the great
abuse of the times, the sale of offices for money. The “very splendid
trifle, the Masque of Flowers,” was one form of the many extravagant
tributes paid but too willingly to high-handed worthlessness, of which
the deeper and darker guilt was to fill all faces with shame two years
afterwards.</p>
<p>As Attorney, Bacon had to take a much more prominent part in affairs,
legal, criminal, constitutional, administrative, than he had yet been
allowed to have. We know that it was his great object to show how much
more active and useful an Attorney he could be than either Coke or
Hobart; and as far as unflagging energy and high ability could make a
good public servant, he fully carried out his purpose. In Parliament,
the “addled Parliament” of 1614, in which he sat for the University of
Cambridge, he did his best to reconcile what were fast becoming
irreconcilable, the claims and prerogatives of an absolute king,
irritable, suspicious, exacting, prodigal, with the ancient rights and
liberties, growing stronger in their demands by being denied, resisted,
or outwitted, of the popular element in the State. In the trials, which
are so large and disagreeable a part of the history of these years —
trials arising out of violent words provoked by the violent acts of
power, one of which, Peacham’s, became famous, because in the course of
it torture was resorted to, or trials which witnessed to the corruption
of the high society of the day, like the astounding series of
arraignments and condemnations following on the discoveries relating to
Overbury’s murder, which had happened just before the Somerset marriage
— Bacon had to make the best that he could for the cruel and often
unequal policy of the Court; and Bacon must take his share in the
responsibility for it. An effort on James’s part to stop duelling
brought from Bacon a worthier piece of service, in the shape of an
earnest and elaborate argument against it, full of good sense and good
feeling, but hopelessly in advance of the time. On the many questions
which touched the prerogative, James found in his Attorney a ready and
skilful advocate of his claims, who knew no limit to them but in the
consideration of what was safe and prudent to assert. He was a better
and more statesmanlike counsellor, in his unceasing endeavours to
reconcile James to the expediency of establishing solid and good
relations with his Parliament, and in his advice as to the wise and
hopeful ways of dealing with it. Bacon had no sympathy with popular
wants and claims; of popularity, of all that was called popular, he had
the deepest suspicion and dislike; the opinions and the judgment of
average men he despised, as a thinker, a politician, and a courtier; the
“malignity of the people” he thought great. “I do not love,” he says,
“the word people.” But he had a high idea of what was worthy of a king,
and was due to the public interests, and he saw the folly of the petty
acts and haughty words, the use of which James could not resist. In his
new office he once more urged on, and urged in vain, his favourite
project for revising, simplifying, and codifying the law. This was a
project which would find little favour with Coke, and the crowd of
lawyers who venerated him — men whom Bacon viewed with mingled contempt
and apprehension both in the courts and in Parliament where they were
numerous, and whom he more than once advised the King to bridle and keep
“in awe.” Bacon presented his scheme to the King in a Proposition, or,
as we should call it, a Report. It is very able and interesting; marked
with his characteristic comprehensiveness and sense of practical needs,
and with a confidence in his own knowledge of law which contrasts
curiously with the current opinion about it. He speaks with the utmost
honour of Coke’s work, but he is not afraid of a comparison with him. “I
do assure your Majesty,” he says, “I am in good hope that when Sir
Edward Coke’s Reports and my Rules and Decisions shall come to
posterity, there will be (whatever is now thought) question who was the
greater lawyer.” But the project, though it was entertained and
discussed in Parliament, came to nothing. No one really cared about it
except Bacon.</p>
<p>But in these years (1615 and 1616) two things happened of the utmost
consequence to him. One was the rise, more extravagant than anything
that England had seen for centuries, and in the end more fatal, of the
new favourite, who from plain George Villiers became the all-powerful
Duke of Buckingham. Bacon, like the rest of the world, saw the necessity
of bowing before him; and Bacon persuaded himself that Villiers was
pre-eminently endowed with all the gifts and virtues which a man in his
place would need. We have a series of his letters to Villiers; they are
of course in the complimentary vein which was expected; but if their
language is only compliment, there is no language left for expressing
what a man wishes to be taken for truth. The other matter was the
humiliation, by Bacon’s means and in his presence, of his old rival
Coke. In the dispute about jurisdiction, always slumbering and lately
awakened and aggravated by Coke, between the Common Law Courts and the
Chancery, Coke had threatened the Chancery with Præmunire. The King’s
jealousy took alarm, and the Chief-Justice was called before the
Council. There a decree, based on Bacon’s advice and probably drawn up
by him, peremptorily overruled the legal doctrine maintained by the
greatest and most self-confident judge whom the English courts had seen.
The Chief-Justice had to acquiesce in this reading of the law; and then,
as if such an affront were not enough, Coke was suspended from his
office, and, further, enjoined to review and amend his published
reports, where they were inconsistent with the view of law which on
Bacon’s authority the Star Chamber had adopted (June, 1616). This he
affected to do, but the corrections were manifestly only colourable; his
explanations of his legal heresies against the prerogative, as these
heresies were formulated by the Chancellor and Bacon, and presented to
him for recantation, were judged insufficient; and in a decree, prefaced
by reasons drawn up by Bacon, in which, besides Coke’s errors of law,
his “deceit, contempt, and slander of the Government,” his “perpetual
turbulent carriage,” and his affectation of popularity, were noted — he
was removed from his office (Nov., 1616). So, for the present, the old
rivalry had ended in a triumph for Bacon. Bacon, whom Coke had so long
headed in the race, whom he had sneered at as a superficial pretender to
law, and whose accomplishments and enthusiasm for knowledge he utterly
despised, had not only defeated him, but driven him from his seat with
dishonour. When we remember what Coke was, what he had thought of Bacon,
and how he prized his own unique reputation as a representative of
English law, the effects of such a disgrace on a man of his temper
cannot easily be exaggerated.</p>
<p>But for the present Bacon had broken through the spell which had so
long kept him back. He won a great deal of the King’s confidence, and
the King was more and more ready to make use of him, though by no means
equally willing to think that Bacon knew better than himself. Bacon’s
view of the law, and his resources of argument and expression to make it
good, could be depended upon in the keen struggle to secure and enlarge
the prerogative which was now beginning. In the prerogative both James
and Bacon saw the safety of the State and the only reasonable hope of
good government; but in Bacon’s larger and more elevated views of policy
— of a policy worthy of a great king, and a king of England — James was
not likely to take much interest. The memorials which it was Bacon’s
habit to present on public affairs were wasted on one who had so little
to learn from others — so he thought and so all assured him — about the
secrets of empire. Still they were proofs of Bacon’s ready mind; and
James, even when he disagreed with Bacon’s opinion and arguments, was
too clever not to see their difference from the work of other men. Bacon
rose in favour; and from the first he was on the best of terms with
Villiers. He professed to Villiers the most sincere devotion. According
to his custom he presented him with a letter of wise advice on the
duties and behaviour of a favourite. He at once began, and kept up with
him to the end, a confidential correspondence on matters of public
importance. He made it clear that he depended upon Villiers for his own
personal prospects, and it had now become the most natural thing that
Bacon should look forward to succeeding the Lord Chancellor, Ellesmere,
who was fast failing. Bacon had already (Feb. 12, 1615/16). in terms
which seem strange to us, but were less strange then, set forth in a
letter to the King the reasons why he should be Chancellor; criticising
justly enough, only that he was a party interested, the qualifications
of other possible candidates, Coke, Hobart, and the Archbishop Abbott.
Coke would be “an overruling nature in an overruling place,” and
“popular men were no sure mounters for your Majesty’s saddle.” Hobart
was incompetent. As to Abbott, the Chancellor’s place required “a whole
man,” and to have both jurisdiction, spiritual and temporal, “was fit
only for a king.” The promise that Bacon should have the place came to
him three days afterwards through Villiers. He acknowledged it in a
burst of gratitude (Feb. 15, 1615/16). “I will now wholly rely on your
excellent and happy self…. I am yours surer to you than my own life.
For, as they speak of the Turquoise stone in a ring, I will break into
twenty pieces before you bear the least fall.” They were unconsciously
prophetic words. But Ellesmere lasted longer than was expected. It was
not till a year after this promise that he resigned. On the 7th of
March, 1616/17, Bacon received the seals. He expresses his obligations
to Villiers, now Lord Buckingham, in the following letter:</p>
<p>“MY DEAREST LORD, — It is both in cares and kindness that small ones
float up to the tongue, and great ones sink down into the heart with
silence. Therefore I could speak little to your Lordship to-day, neither
had I fit time; but I must profess thus much, that in this day’s work
you are the truest and perfectest mirror and example of firm and
generous friendship that ever was in court. And I shall count every day
lost, wherein I shall not either study your well-doing in thought, or do
your name honour in speech, or perform you service in deed. Good my
Lord, account and accept me your most bounden and devoted friend and
servant of all men living,</p>
<p>“March 7, 1616 (i.e. 1616/1617).</p>
<p>FR. BACON, C.S.”</p>
<p>He himself believed the appointment to be a popular one. “I know I am
come in,” he writes to the King soon after, “with as strong an envy of
some particulars as with the love of the general.” On the 7th of May,
1617, he took his seat in Chancery with unusual pomp and magnificence,
and set forth, in an opening speech, with all his dignity and force, the
duties of his great office and his sense of their obligation. But there
was a curious hesitation in treating him as other men were treated in
like cases. He was only “Lord Keeper.” It was not till the following
January (1617/18) that he received the office of Lord Chancellor. It was
not till half a year afterwards that he was made a Peer. Then he became
Baron Verulam (July, 1618), and in January, 1620/21, Viscount
St. Alban’s.</p>
<p>From this time Bacon must be thought of, first and foremost, as a
Judge in the great seat which he had so earnestly sought. It was the
place not merely of law, which often tied the judge’s hands painfully,
but of true justice, when law failed to give it. Bacon’s ideas of the
duties of a judge were clear and strong, as he showed in various
admirable speeches and charges: his duties as regards his own conduct
and reputation; his duties in keeping his subordinates free from the
taint of corruption. He was not ignorant of the subtle and
unacknowledged ways in which unlawful gains may be covered by custom,
and an abuse goes on because men will not choose to look at it. He
entered on his office with the full purpose of doing its work better
than it had ever been done. He saw where it wanted reforming, and set
himself at once to reform. The accumulation and delay of suits had
become grievous; at once he threw his whole energy into the task of
wiping out the arrears which the bad health of his predecessor and the
traditional sluggishness of the court had heaped up. In exactly three
months from his appointment he was able to report that these arrears had
been cleared off. “This day” (June 8, 1617), he writes to Buckingham, “I
have made even with the business of the kingdom for common justice. Not
one cause unheard. The lawyers drawn dry of all the motions they were to
make. Not one petition unheard. And this I think could not be said in
our time before.”</p>
<p>The performance was splendid, and there is no reason to think that
the work so rapidly done was not well done. We are assured that Bacon’s
decisions were unquestioned, and were not complained of. At the same
time, before this allegation is accepted as conclusive proof of the
public satisfaction, it must be remembered that the question of his
administration of justice, which was at last to assume such strange
proportions, has never been so thoroughly sifted as, to enable us to
pronounce upon it, it should be. The natural tendency of Bacon’s mind
would undoubtedly be to judge rightly and justly; but the negative
argument of the silence at the time of complainants, in days when it was
so dangerous to question authority, and when we have so little evidence
of what men said at their firesides, is not enough to show that he never
failed.</p>
<p>But the serious thing is that Bacon subjected himself to two of the
most dangerous influences which can act on the mind of a judge — the
influence of the most powerful and most formidable man in England, and
the influence of presents, in money and other gifts. From first to last
he allowed Buckingham, whom no man, as Bacon soon found, could displease
except at his own peril, to write letters to him on behalf of suitors
whose causes were before him; and he allowed suitors, not often while
the cause was pending, but sometimes even then, to send him directly, or
through his servants, large sums of money. Both these things are
explained. It would have been characteristic of Bacon to be confident
that he could defy temptation: these habits were the fashion of the
time, and everybody took them for granted; Buckingham never asked his
good offices beyond what Bacon thought just and right, and asked them
rather for the sake of expedition than to influence his judgment. And as
to the money presents — every office was underpaid; this was the common
way of acknowledging pains and trouble: it was analogous to a doctor’s
or a lawyer’s fee now. And there is no proof that either influence ever
led Bacon to do wrong. This has been said, and said with some degree of
force. But if it shows that Bacon was not in this matter below his age,
it shows that he was not above it. No one knew better than Bacon that
there were no more certain dangers to honesty and justice than the
interference and solicitation of the great, and the old famous pest of
bribes, of which all histories and laws were full. And yet on the
highest seat of justice in the realm he, the great reformer of its
abuses, allowed them to make their customary haunt. He did not mean to
do wrong: his conscience was clear; he had not given thought to the
mischief they must do, sooner or later, to all concerned with the Court
of Chancery. With a magnificent carelessness he could afford to run
safely a course closely bordering on crime, in which meaner men would
sin and be ruined.</p>
<p>Before six months were over Bacon found on what terms he must stand
with Buckingham. By a strange fatality, quite unintentionally, he became
dragged into the thick of the scandalous and grotesque dissensions of
the Coke family. The Court was away from London in the North; and Coke
had been trying, not without hope of success, to recover the King’s
favour. Coke was a rich man, and Lady Compton, the mother of the
Villiers, thought that Coke’s daughter would be a good match for one of
her younger sons. It was really a great chance for Coke; but he haggled
about the portion; and the opportunity, which might perhaps have led to
his taking Bacon’s place, passed. But he found himself in trouble in
other ways; his friends, especially Secretary Winwood, contrived to
bring the matter on again, and he consented to the Villiers’s terms. But
his wife, the young lady’s mother, Lady Hatton, would not hear of it,
and a furious quarrel followed. She carried off her daughter into the
country. Coke, with a warrant from Secretary Winwood, which Bacon had
refused to give him, pursued her: “with his son, ‘Fighting Clem,’ and
ten or eleven servants, weaponed, in a violent manner he repaired to the
house where she was remaining, and with a piece of timber or form broke
open the door and dragged her along to his coach.” Lady Hatton rushed
off the same afternoon for help to Bacon.</p>
<p>After an overturn by the way, “at last to my Lord Keeper’s they come,
but could not have instant access to him, for that his people told them
he was laid at rest, being not well. Then my La. Hatton desired she
might be in the next room where my Lord lay, that she might be the first
that [should] speak with him after he was stirring. The door-keeper
fulfilled her desire, and in the meantime gave her a chair to rest
herself in, and there left her alone; but not long after, she rose up
and bounced against my Lord Keeper’s door, and waked him and affrighted
him, that he called his men to him; and they opening the door, she
thrust in with them, and desired his Lp. to pardon her boldness, but she
was like a cow that had lost her calf, and so justified [herself] and
pacified my Lord’s anger, and got his warrant and my Lo. Treasurer’s
warrant and others of the Council to fetch her daughter from the father
and bring them both to the Council.”</p>
<p>It was a chance that the late Chief-Justice and his wife, with their
armed parties, did not meet on the road, in which case “there were like
to be strange tragedies.” At length the Council compelled both sides to
keep the peace, and the young lady was taken for the present out of the
hands of her raging parents. Bacon had assumed that the affair was the
result of an intrigue between Winwood and Coke, and that the Court would
take part against Coke, a man so deep in disgrace and so outrageously
violent. Supposing that he had the ear of Buckingham, he wrote
earnestly, persuading him to put an end to the business; and in the
meantime the Council ordered Coke to be brought before the Star Chamber
“for riot and force,” to “be heard and sentenced as justice shall
appertain.” They had not the slightest doubt that they were doing what
would please the King. A few days after they met, and then they learned
the truth.</p>
<p>“Coke and his friends,” writes Chamberlain, “complain of hard measure
from some of the greatest at that board, and that he was too much
trampled upon with ill language. And our friend [i.e. Winwood] passed
out scot free for the warrant, which the greatest [word illegible] there
said was subject to a præmunire; and withal told the Lady Compton that
they wished well to her and her sons, and would be ready to serve the
Earl of Buckingham with all true affection, whereas others did it out of
faction and ambition — which words glancing directly at our good friend
(Winwood), he was driven to make his apology, and to show how it was put
upon him from time to time by the Queen and other parties; and, for
conclusion, showed a letter of approbation of all his courses from the
King, making the whole table judge what faction and ambition appeared in
this carriage. Ad quod non fuit responsum.”</p>
<p>None indeed, but blank faces, and thoughts of what might come next.
The Council, and Bacon foremost, had made a desperate mistake. “It is
evident,” as Mr. Spedding says, “that he had not divined Buckingham’s
feelings on the subject.” He was now to learn them. To his utter
amazement and alarm he found that the King was strong for the match, and
that the proceeding of the Council was condemned at Court as gross
misconduct. In vain he protested that he was quite willing to forward
the match; that in fact he had helped it. Bacon’s explanations, and his
warnings against Coke the King “rejected with some disdain;” he
justified Coke’s action; he charged Bacon with disrespect and
ingratitude to Buckingham; he put aside his arguments and apologies as
worthless or insincere. Such reprimands had not often been addressed,
even to inferior servants. Bacon’s letters to Buckingham remained at
first without notice; when Buckingham answered he did so with scornful
and menacing curtness. Meanwhile Bacon heard from Yelverton how things
were going at Court.</p>
<p>“Sir E. Coke,” he wrote, “hath not forborne by any engine to heave at
both your Honour and myself, and he works the weightiest instrument, the
Earl of Buckingham, who, as I see, sets him as close to him as his
shirt, the Earl speaking in Sir Edward’s phrase, and as it were menacing
in his spirit.”</p>
<p>Buckingham, he went on to say, “did nobly and plainly tell me he
would not secretly bite, but whosoever had had any interest, or tasted
of the opposition to his brother’s marriage, he would as openly oppose
them to their faces, and they should discern what favour he had by the
power he would use.” The Court, like a pack of dogs, had set upon Bacon.
“It is too common in every man’s mouth in Court that your greatness
shall be abated, and as your tongue hath been as a razor unto some, so
shall theirs be to you.” Buckingham said to every one that Bacon had
been forgetful of his kindness and unfaithful to him: “not forbearing in
open speech to tax you, as if it were an inveterate custom with you, to
be unfaithful unto him, as you were to the Earls of Essex and
Somerset.”</p>
<p>All this while Bacon had been clearly in the right. He had thrust
himself into no business that did not concern him. He had not, as
Buckingham accuses him of having done, “overtroubled” himself with the
marriage. He had done his simple duty as a friend, as a councillor, as a
judge. He had been honestly zealous for the Villiers’s honour, and
warned Buckingham of things that were beyond question. He had curbed
Coke’s scandalous violence, perhaps with no great regret, but with
manifest reason. But for this he was now on the very edge of losing his
office; it was clear to him, as it is clear to us, that nothing could
save him but absolute submission. He accepted the condition. How this
submission was made and received, and with what gratitude he found that
he was forgiven, may be seen in the two following letters. Buckingham
thus extends his grace to the Lord Keeper, and exhorts him to better
behaviour:</p>
<p>“But his Majesty’s direction in answer of your letter hath given me
occasion to join hereunto a discovery unto you of mine inward thoughts,
proceeding upon the discourse you had with me this day. For I do freely
confess that your offer of submission unto me, and in writing (if so I
would have it), battered so the unkindness that I had conceived in my
heart for your behaviour towards me in my absence, as out of the sparks
of my old affection towards you I went to sound his Majesty’s intention
how he means to behave himself towards you, specially in any public
meeting; where I found on the one part his Majesty so little satisfied
with your late answer unto him, which he counted (for I protest I use
his own terms) confused and childish, and his vigorous resolution on the
other part so fixed, that he would put some public exemplary mark upon
you, as I protest the sight of his deep-conceived indignation quenched
my passion, making me upon the instant change from the person of a party
into a peace-maker; so as I was forced upon my knees to beg of his
Majesty that he would put no public act of disgrace upon you, and, as I
dare say, no other person would have been patiently heard in this suit
by his Majesty but myself, so did I (though not without difficulty)
obtain thus much — that he would not so far disable you from the merit
of your future service as to put any particular mark of disgrace upon
your person. Only thus far his Majesty protesteth, that upon the
conscience of his office he cannot omit (though laying aside all
passion) to give a kingly reprimand at his first sitting in council to
so many of his councillors as were then here behind, and were actors in
this business, for their ill behaviour in it. Some of the particular
errors committed in this business he will name, but without accusing any
particular persons by name.</p>
<p>“Thus your Lordship seeth the fruits of my natural inclination; and I
protest all this time past it was no small grief unto me to hear the
mouth of so many upon this occasion open to load you with innumerable
malicious and detracting speeches, as if no music were more pleasing to
my ears than to rail of you, which made me rather regret the ill nature
of mankind, that like dogs love to set upon him that they see once
snatched at. And to conclude, my Lord, you have hereby a fair occasion
so to make good hereafter your reputation by your sincere service to his
Majesty, as also by your firm and constant kindness to your friends, as
I may (your Lordship’s old friend) participate of the comfort and honour
that will thereby come to you. Thus I rest at last</p>
<p>“Your Lordship’s faithful friend and servant,</p>
<p>“G.B.”</p>
<p>“MY EVER BEST LORD, now better than yourself, — Your Lordship’s pen,
or rather pencil, hath pourtrayed towards me such magnanimity and
nobleness and true kindness, as methinketh I see the image of some
ancient virtue, and not anything of these times. It is the line of my
life, and not the lines of my letter, that must express my thankfulness;
wherein if I fail, then God fail me, and make me as miserable as I think
myself at this time happy by this reviver, through his Majesty’s
singular clemency, and your incomparable love and favour. God preserve
you, prosper you, and reward you for your kindness to</p>
<p>“Your raised and infinitely obliged friend and servant,</p>
<p>“Sept. 22, 1617.</p>
<p>FR. BACON, C.S.”</p>
<p>Thus he had tried his strength with Buckingham. He had found that
this, “a little parent-like” manner of advising him, and the doctrine
that a true friend “ought rather to go against his mind than his good,”
was not what Buckingham expected from him. And he never ventured on it
again. It is not too much to say that a man who could write as he now
did to Buckingham, could not trust himself in any matter in which
Buckingham, was interested.</p>
<p>But the reconciliation was complete, and Bacon took his place more
and more as one of the chief persons in the Government. James claimed so
much to have his own way, and had so little scruple in putting aside, in
his superior wisdom, sometimes very curtly, Bacon’s or any other
person’s recommendations, that though his services were great, and were
not unrecognised, he never had the power and influence in affairs to
which his boundless devotion to the Crown, his grasp of business, and
his willing industry, ought to have entitled him. He was still a
servant, and made to feel it, though a servant in the “first form.” It
was James and Buckingham who determined the policy of the country, or
settled the course to be taken in particular transactions; when this was
settled, it was Bacon’s business to carry it through successfully. In
this he was like all the other servants of the Crown, and like them he
was satisfied with giving his advice, whether it were taken or not; but
unlike many of them he was zealous in executing with the utmost vigour
and skill the instructions which were given him. Thus he was required to
find the legal means for punishing Raleigh; and, as a matter of duty, he
found them. He was required to tell the Government side of the story of
Raleigh’s crimes and punishment — which really was one side of the
story, only not by any means the whole; and he told it, as he had told
the Government story against Essex, with force, moderation, and good
sense. Himself, he never would have made James’s miserable blunders
about Raleigh; but the blunders being made, it was his business to do
his best to help the King out of them. When Suffolk, the Lord Treasurer,
was disgraced and brought before the Star Chamber for corruption and
embezzlement in his office, Bacon thought that he was doing no more than
his duty in keeping Buckingham informed day by day how the trial was
going on; how he had taken care that Suffolk’s submission should not
stop it— “for all would be but a play on the stage if justice went not
on in the right course;” how he had taken care that the evidence went
well— “I will not say I sometime holp it, as far as was fit for a
judge;” how, “a little to warm the business” … “I spake a word, that he
that did draw or milk treasure from Ireland, did not, emulgere, milk
money, but blood.” This, and other “little things” like it, while he was
sitting as a judge to try, if the word may be used, a personal enemy of
Buckingham, however bad the case might be against Suffolk, sound strange
indeed to us; and not less so when, in reporting the sentence and the
various opinions of the Council about it, he, for once, praises Coke for
the extravagance of his severity: “Sir Edward Coke did his part — I have
not heard him do better — and began with a fine of £100,000; but the
judges first, and most of the rest, reduced it to £30,000. I do not
dislike that thing passed moderately; and all things considered, it is
not amiss, and might easily have been worse.”</p>
<p>In all this, which would have been perfectly natural from an
Attorney-General of the time, Bacon saw but his duty, even as a judge
between the Crown and the subject. It was what was expected of those
whom the King chose to employ, and whom Buckingham chose to favour. But
a worse and more cruel case, illustrating the system which a man like
Bacon could think reasonable and honourable, was the disgrace and
punishment of Yelverton, the Attorney-General, the man who had stood by
Bacon, and in his defence had faced Buckingham, knowing well
Buckingham’s dislike of himself, when all the Court turned against Bacon
in his quarrel with Coke and Lady Compton. Towards the end of the year
1620, on the eve of a probable meeting of Parliament, there was great
questioning about what was to be done about certain patents and
monopolies — monopolies for making gold and silk thread, and for
licensing inns and ale-houses — which were in the hands of Buckingham’s
brothers and their agents. The monopolies were very unpopular; there was
always doubt as to their legality; they were enforced oppressively and
vexatiously by men like Michell and Mompesson, who acted for the
Villiers; and the profits of them went, for the most part, not into the
Exchequer, but into the pockets of the hangers-on of Buckingham. Bacon
defended them both in law and policy, and his defence is thought by
Mr. Gardiner to be not without grounds; but he saw the danger of
obstinacy in maintaining what had become so hateful in the country, and
strongly recommended that the more indefensible and unpopular patents
should be spontaneously given up, the more so as they were of “no great
fruit.” But Buckingham’s insolent perversity “refused to be convinced.”
The Council, when the question was before them, decided to maintain
them. Bacon, who had rightly voted in the minority, thus explains his
own vote to Buckingham: “The King did wisely put it upon and consult,
whether the patents were at this time to be removed by Act of Council
before Parliament. I opined (but yet somewhat like Ovid’s mistress, that
strove, but yet as one that would be overcome), that yes!” But in the
various disputes which had arisen about them, Yelverton had shown that
he very much disliked the business of defending monopolies, and sending
London citizens to jail for infringing them. He did it, but he did it
grudgingly. It was a great offence in a man whom Buckingham had always
disliked; and it is impossible to doubt that what followed was the
consequence of his displeasure.</p>
<p>“In drawing up a new charter for the city of London,” writes
Mr. Gardiner, “Yelverton inserted clauses for which he was unable to
produce a warrant. The worst that could be said was that he had, through
inadvertence, misunderstood the verbal directions of the King. Although
no imputation of corruption was brought against him, yet he was
suspended from his office, and prosecuted in the Star Chamber. He was
then sentenced to dismissal from his post, to a fine of £4000, and to
imprisonment during the Royal pleasure.”</p>
<p>In the management of this business Bacon had the chief part.
Yelverton, on his suspension, at once submitted. The obnoxious clauses
are not said to have been of serious importance, but they were new
clauses which the King had not sanctioned, and it would be a bad
precedent to pass over such unauthorised additions even by an
Attorney-General. “I mistook many things,” said Yelverton afterwards, in
words which come back into our minds at a later period, “I was
improvident in some things, and too credulous in all things.” It might
have seemed that dismissal, if not a severe reprimand, was punishment
enough. But the submission was not enough, in Bacon’s opinion, “for the
King’s honour.” He dwelt on the greatness of the offence, and the
necessity of making a severe example. According to his advice, Yelverton
was prosecuted in the Star Chamber. It was not merely a mistake of
judgment. “Herein,” said Bacon, “I note the wisdom of the law of
England, which termeth the highest contempt and excesses of authority
Misprisions; which (if you take the sound and derivation of the word) is
but mistaken; but if you take the use and acception of the word, it is
high and heinous contempt and usurpation of authority; whereof the
reason I take to be and the name excellently imposed, for that main
mistaking, it is ever joined with contempt; for he that reveres will not
easily mistake; but he that slights, and thinks more of the greatness of
his place than of the duty of his place, will soon commit misprisions.”
The day would come when this doctrine would be pressed with ruinous
effect against Bacon himself. But now he expounded with admirable
clearness the wrongness of carelessness about warrants and of taking
things for granted. He acquitted his former colleague of “corruption of
reward;” but “in truth that makes the offence rather divers than less;”
for some offences “are black, and others scarlet, some sordid, some
presumptuous.” He pronounced his sentence — the fine, the imprisonment;
“for his place, I declare him unfit for it.” “And the next day,” says
Mr. Spedding, “he reported to Buckingham the result of the proceeding,”
and takes no small credit for his own part in it.</p>
<p>It was thus that the Court used Bacon, and that Bacon submitted to be
used. He could have done, if he had been listened to, much nobler
service. He had from the first seen, and urged as far as he could, the
paramount necessity of retrenchment in the King’s profligate
expenditure. Even Buckingham had come to feel the necessity of it at
last; and now that Bacon filled a seat at the Council, and that the
prosecution of Suffolk and an inquiry into the abuses of the Navy had
forced on those in power the urgency of economy, there was a chance of
something being done to bring order into the confusion of the finances.
Retrenchment began at the King’s kitchen and the tables of his servants;
an effort was made, not unsuccessfully, to extend it wider, under the
direction of Lionel Cranfield, a self-made man of business from the
city; but with such a Court the task was an impossible one. It was not
Bacon’s fault, though he sadly mismanaged his own private affairs, that
the King’s expenditure was not managed soberly and wisely. Nor was it
Bacon’s fault, as far as advice went, that James was always trying
either to evade or to outwit a Parliament which he could not, like the
Tudors, overawe. Bacon’s uniform counsel had been — Look on a Parliament
as a certain necessity, but not only as a necessity, as also a unique
and most precious means for uniting the Crown with the nation, and
proving to the world outside how Englishmen love and honour their King,
and their King trusts his subjects. Deal with it frankly and nobly as
becomes a king, not suspiciously like a huckster in a bargain. Do not be
afraid of Parliament. Be skilful in calling it, but don’t attempt to
“pack” it. Use all due adroitness and knowledge of human nature, and
necessary firmness and majesty, in managing it; keep unruly and
mischievous people in their place, but do not be too anxious to meddle—
“let nature work;” and above all, though of course you want money from
it, do not let that appear as the chief or real cause of calling it.
Take the lead in legislation. Be ready with some interesting or imposing
points of reform, or policy, about which you ask your Parliament to take
counsel with you. Take care to “frame and have ready some commonwealth
bills, that may add respect to the King’s government and acknowledgment
of his care; not wooing bills to make the King and his graces cheap, but
good matter to set the Parliament on work, that an empty stomach do not
feed on humour.” So from the first had Bacon always thought; so he
thought when he watched, as a spectator, James’s blunders with his first
Parliament of 1604; so had he earnestly counselled James, when admitted
to his confidence, as to the Parliaments of 1614 and 1615; so again, but
in vain, as Chancellor, he advised him to meet the Parliament of 1620.
It was wise, and from his point of view honest advice, though there runs
all through it too much reliance on appearances which were not all that
they seemed; there was too much thought of throwing dust in the eyes of
troublesome and inconvenient people. But whatever motives there might
have been behind, it would have been well if James had learned from
Bacon how to deal with Englishmen. But he could not. “I wonder,” said
James one day to Gondomar, “that my ancestors should ever have permitted
such an institution as the House of Commons to have come into existence.
I am a stranger, and found it here when I arrived, so that I am obliged
to put up with what I cannot get rid of.” James was the only one of our
many foreign kings who, to the last, struggled to avoid submitting
himself to the conditions of an English throne.</p>
