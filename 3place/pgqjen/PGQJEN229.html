<h4 id="section">92</h4>
<p>But by far the greatest obstacle to the progress of science and to
the undertaking of new tasks and provinces therein is found in this —
that men despair and think things impossible. For wise and serious men
are wont in these matters to be altogether distrustful, considering with
themselves the obscurity of nature, the shortness of life, the
deceitfulness of the senses, the weakness of the judgment, the
difficulty of experiment, and the like; and so supposing that in the
revolution of time and of the ages of the world the sciences have their
ebbs and flows; that at one season they grow and flourish, at another
wither and decay, yet in such sort that when they have reached a certain
point and condition they can advance no further. If therefore anyone
believes or promises more, they think this comes of an ungoverned and
unripened mind, and that such attempts have prosperous beginnings,
become difficult as they go on, and end in confusion. Now since these
are thoughts which naturally present themselves to men grave and of
great judgment, we must take good heed that we be not led away by our
love for a most fair and excellent object to relax or diminish the
severity of our judgment. We must observe diligently what encouragement
dawns upon us and from what quarter, and, putting aside the lighter
breezes of hope, we must thoroughly sift and examine those which promise
greater steadiness and constancy. Nay, and we must take state prudence
too into our counsels, whose rule is to distrust, and to take the less
favorable view of human affairs. I am now therefore to speak touching
hope, especially as I am not a dealer in promises, and wish neither to
force nor to ensnare men’s judgments, but to lead them by the hand with
their good will. And though the strongest means of inspiring hope will
be to bring men to particulars, especially to particulars digested and
arranged in my Tables of Discovery (the subject partly of the second,
but much more of the fourth part of my Instauration), since this is not
merely the promise of the thing but the thing itself; nevertheless, that
everything may be done with gentleness, I will proceed with my plan of
preparing men’s minds, of which preparation to give hope is no
unimportant part. For without it the rest tends rather to make men sad
(by giving them a worse and meaner opinion of things as they are than
they now have, and making them more fully to feel and know the
unhappiness of their own condition) than to induce any alacrity or to
whet their industry in making trial. And therefore it is fit that I
publish and set forth those conjectures of mine which make hope in this
matter reasonable, just as Columbus did, before that wonderful voyage of
his across the Atlantic, when he gave the reasons for his conviction
that new lands and continents might be discovered besides those which
were known before; which reasons, though rejected at first, were
afterwards made good by experience, and were the causes and beginnings
of great events.</p>
