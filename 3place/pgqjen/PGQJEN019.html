<h4 id="of-superstition">Of Superstition</h4>
<p>It were better to have no opinion of God at all, than such an
opinion, as is unworthy of him. For the one is unbelief, the other is
contumely; and certainly superstition is the reproach of the Deity.
Plutarch saith well to that purpose: Surely (saith he) I had rather a
great deal, men should say, there was no sitch man at all, as Plutarch,
than that they should say, that there was one Plutarch, that would eat
his children as soon as they were born; as the poets speak of Saturn.
And as the contumely is greater towards God, so the danger is greater
towards men. Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural
piety, to laws, to reputation all which may be guides to an outward
moral virtue, though religion were not; but superstition dismounts all
these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy, in the minds of men. Therefore
theism did never perturb states; for it makes men wary of themselves, as
looking no further: and we see the times inclined to atheism (as the
time of Augustus Caesar) were civil times. But superstition hath been
the confusion of many states, and bringeth in a new primum mobile, that
ravisheth all the spheres of government. The master of superstition, is
the people; and in all superstition, wise men follow fools; and
arguments are fitted to practice, in a reversed order. It was gravely
said by some of the prelates in the Council of Trent, where the doctrine
of the Schoolmen bare great sway, that the Schoolmen were like
astronomers, which did feign eccentrics and epicycles, and such engines
of orbs, to save the phenomena; though they knew there were no such
things; and in like manner, that the Schoolmen had framed a number of
subtle and intricate axioms, and theorems, to save the practice of the
church. The causes of superstition are: pleasing and sensual rites and
ceremonies; excess of outward and pharisaical holiness; overgreat
reverence of traditions, which cannot but load the church; the
stratagems of prelates, for their own ambition and lucre; the favoring
too much of good intentions, which openeth the gate to conceits and
novelties; the taking an aim at divine matters, by human, which cannot
but breed mixture of imaginations: and, lastly, barbarous times,
especially joined with calamities and disasters. Superstition, without a
veil, is a deformed thing; for, as it addeth deformity to an ape, to be
so like a man, so the similitude of superstition to religion, makes it
the more deformed. And as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms, so
good forms and orders corrupt, into a number of petty observances. There
is a superstition in avoiding superstition, when men think to do best,
if they go furthest from the superstition, formerly received; therefore
care would be had that (as it fareth in the good be not taken away with
the bad; which commonly is done, when the people is the reformer.</p>
