<p>XDædalus, or Mechanical Skill Explained of Arts and Artists in
Kingdoms and States</p>
<p>THE ancients have left us a description of mechanical skill,
industry, and curious arts converted to ill uses, in the person of
Dædalus, a most ingenious but execrable artist. This Dædalus was
banished for the murder of his brother artist and rival, yet found a
kind reception in his banishment from the kings and states where he
came. He raised many incomparable edifices to the honour of the gods,
and invented many new contrivances for the beautifying and ennobling of
cities and public places, but still he was most famous for wicked
inventions. Among the rest, by his abominable industry and destructive
genius, he assisted in the fatal and infamous production of the monster
Minotaur, that devourer of promising youths. And then, to cover one
mischief with another, and provide for the security of this monster, he
invented and built a labyrinth; a work infamous for it’s end and design,
but admirable and prodigious for art and workmanship. After this, that
he might not only be celebrated for wicked inventions, but be sought
after, as well for prevention, as for instruments of mischief, he formed
that ingenious device of his clue, which led directly through all the
windings of the labyrinth. This Dædalus was persecuted by Minos with the
utmost severity, diligence, and inquiry; but he always found refuge and
means of escaping. Lastly, endeavouring to teach his son Icarus the art
of flying, the novice, trusting too much to his wings, fell from his
towering flight, and was drowned in the sea.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - The sense of the fable runs thus. It first enotes
envy, which is continually upon the watch, and strangely prevails among
excellent artificers; for no kind of people are observed to be more
implacably and destructively envious to one another than these.</p>
<p>In the next place, it observes an impolitic and improvident kind of
of punishment inflicted upon Dædalus, that of banishment; for good
workmen are gladly received everywhere, so that banishment to an
excellent artificer is scarce any punishment at all; whereas other
conditions of life cannot easily flourish from home. For the admiration
of artists is propagated and increased among foreigners and strangers;
it being a principle in the minds of men to slight and despise the
mechanical operators of their own nation.</p>
<p>The succeeding part of the fable is plain, concerning the use of
mechanic arts, whereto human life stands greatly indebted, as receiving
from this treasury numerous particulars for the service of religion, the
ornament of civil society, and the whole provision and apparatus of
life; but then the same magazine supplies instruments of lust, cruelty,
and death: For, not to mention the arts of luxury and debauchery, we
plainly see how far the business of exquisite poisons, guns, engines of
war, and such kind of destructive inventions, exceeds the cruelty and
barbarity of the Minotaur himself.</p>
<p>The addition of the labyrinth contains a beautiful allegory,
representing the nature of mechanic arts in general; for all ingenious
and accurate mechanical inventions, may be conceived as a labyrinth,
which, by reason of their subtilty, intricacy, crossing, and interfering
with one another, and the apparent resemblances they have among
themselves, scarce any power of the judgment can unravel and
distinguish; so that they are only to be understood and traced by the
clue of experience.</p>
<p>It is no less prudently added, that he who invented the windings of
the labyrinth, should also show the use and management of the clue; for
mechanical arts have an ambiguous or double use, and serve as well to
produce as to prevent mischief and destruction; so that their virtue
almost destroys or unwinds itself.</p>
<p>Unlawful arts, and indeed frequently arts themselves, are persecuted
by Minos, that is, by laws, which prohibit and forbid their use among
the people; but notwithstanding this, they are hid, concealed, retained,
and everywhere find reception and sculking-places; a thing well observed
by Tacitus of the astrologers and fortune-tellers of his time. “These,”
says he, “are a kind of men that will always be prohibited, and yet will
always be retained in our city.”</p>
<p>But lastly, all unlawful and vain arts, of what kind soever, lose
their reputation in tract of time; grow contemptible and perish, through
their over-confidence, like Icarus; being commonly unable to perform
what they boasted. And to say the truth, such arts are better suppressed
by their own vain pretensions, than checked or restrained by the bridle
of laws.</p>
