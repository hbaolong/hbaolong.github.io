<h4 id="chapter-i.-sources-of-information.">Chapter I. SOURCES OF
INFORMATION.</h4>
<p>The standard work is “The Life and Letters of Francis Bacon,” by
James Spedding, which was published from 1858-1869. It comprises seven
volumes, with 3,033 pages. The first twenty years of Bacon’s life are
disposed of in 8 pages, and the next ten years in 95 pages, of which 43
pages are taken up with three tracts attributed to him. There is
practically no information given as to what should be the most important
years of his life. The two first volumes carry the narrative to the end
of Elizabeth’s reign, when Bacon had passed his fortieth year. There is
in them a considerable contribution to the history of the times, but a
critical perusal will establish the fact that they add very little to
our knowledge of the man, and they fail to give any adequate idea of how
he was occupied during those years. In the seven volumes 513 letters of
Bacon’s are printed, and of these no less than 238 are addressed to
James I. and the Duke of Buckingham, and were written during the last
years of his life. The biographies by Montagu and Hepworth Dixon are
less pretentious, but contain little more information.</p>
<p>The first published Life of Bacon appears to have been unknown to all
these writers. In 1631 was published in Paris a translation of the
“Sylva Sylvarum,” as the “Histoire Naturelle de Mre. Francois Bacon.”
Prefixed to it is a chapter entitled “Discours sur la vie de Mre.
Francois Bacon, Chancelier D’Angleterre.” Reference will be made to this
important discourse hereafter. It is sufficient for the present to say
that it definitely states that during his youth Bacon travelled in Italy
and Spain, which fact is to-day unrecognised by those who are accepted
as authorities on his life. In 1647 there was published at Leyden a
Dutch translation of forty-six of Bacon’s Essays — the “Wisdom of the
Ancients” and the “Religious Meditations.” The translation is by Peter
Boener, an apothecary of Nymegen, Holland, who was in Bacon’s service
for some years as domestic apothecary, and occasional amanuensis, and
quitted his employment in 1623. Boener added a Life of Bacon which is a
mere fragment, but contains testimony by a personal attendant which is
of value. In 1657 William Rawley issued a volume of unpublished
manuscripts under the title of “Resuscitatio,” and to these he added a
Life of the great Philosopher. Rawley is only once mentioned by Bacon.
His will contains the sentence: “I give to my chaplain, Dr. Rawleigh,
one hundred pounds.” Rawley was born in 1590. When he became associated
with his master is not known, but it could only have been towards the
close of his life. Bacon appears to have reposed great confidence in
him. In 1627,2 the year following Bacon’s death, he published the “Sylva
Sylvarum.” This must have been in the press before Bacon’s death. Rawley
subsequently published other works, and was associated with Isaac Gruter
during the seventeenth century in producing on the continent various
editions of Bacon’s works.</p>
<p>Rawley’s account of Bacon’s life is meagre, and, having regard to the
wealth of information which must have been at his disposal, it is a very
disappointing production. Still, it contains information which is not to
be found elsewhere. How incomplete it is may be gathered from the fact
that there is no reference in it to Bacon’s fall.</p>
<p>In 1665 was published a volume, “The Statesmen and Favourites of
England since the Reformation.” It was compiled by David Lloyd. The
biographies of the Elizabethan statesmen were written by someone who was
closely associated with them, and who appears to have had exceptional
opportunities of obtaining information as to their opinions and
characters.3 As to how these lives came into Lloyd’s possession nothing
is known. Prefixed to the biographies are two pages containing “The Lord
Bacon’s judgment in a work of this nature.” The chapter on Bacon is a
most important contribution to the subject, but it also appears to have
escaped the notice of Spedding, Hepworth Dixon, and Montagu. In 1658
Francis Osborn, in Letters to his son, gives a graphic description of
the Lord Chancellor. Perhaps one can better picture Bacon as he was in
the strength of his manhood from Osborne’s account of him than from any
other source. Thomas Bushell, another of Bacon’s household dependents,
published in 1628 “The First Part of Youth’s Errors.” In a letter
therein addressed to Mr. John Eliot, he has left contributions to our
stock of knowledge. There are also some miscellaneous tracts written by
him, and published about the year 1660, which contain references to
Bacon.</p>
<p>Fuller’s Worthies (1660) gives a short account of his life and
character, eulogistic but sparse. In 1679 was published “Baconiana,” or
Certain Genuine Remains of Sir Francis Bacon, andandandandc., by Bishop
Tennison, but it contains no better account of his life. Winstanley’s
Worthies (1684) relies entirely on Rawley’s Life, which is reproduced in
it. Aubrey’s brief Lives were written about 1680. There are references
to Bacon in Arthur Wilson’s “History of the Reign of James I.”; in “The
Court of James I.,” by Sir W. A.; in “Simeon D’Ewes’ Diary”; and,
lastly, in his “Discoveries,” Ben Jonson contributes a high eulogy on
Bacon’s character and attainments.</p>
<p>In 1702 Robert Stephens, the Court historiographer, published a
volume of Bacon’s letters, with an introduction giving some account of
his life; and there was a second edition in 1736. In 1740 David Mallet
published an edition of Bacon’s works, and wrote a Life to accompany it.
This was subsequently printed as a separate volume. As a biography it is
without interest, as it contains no new facts as to his life.</p>
<p>In 1754 memoirs of the reign of Queen Elizabeth from the year 1581 to
her death appeared, edited by Dr. Thomas Birch. These memoirs are
founded upon the letters of the various members of the Bacon family. In
1763 a volume of letters of Francis Bacon was issued under the same
editor.</p>
<p>Such are the sources of information which have come down to us in
biographical notices.</p>
<p>In the British Museum, the Record Office, and elsewhere are the
originals of the letters and the manuscripts of some of the tracts which
Spedding has printed.</p>
<p>The British Museum also possesses two books of Memoranda used by
Bacon. The Transportat is entirely, and the Promus is partly, in his
handwriting. Beyond his published works, that is all that so far has
been available.</p>
<p>Spedding remarks4: “What became of his books which were left to Sir
John Constable and must have contained traces of his reading, we do not
know, but very few appear to have survived.”</p>
<p>Happily, Spedding was wrong. During the past ten years nearly 2,000
books which have passed through Bacon’s hands have been gathered
together. These are copiously annotated by him, and from these
annotations the wide range and the methodical character of his reading
may be gathered. Manuscripts which were in his library, and at least
four common-place books in his handwriting, have also been recovered.
Particulars of these have not yet been made public, but the advantage of
access to them has been available in the preparation this volume.</p>
