<p>Dionysus, or, Bacchus. Explained of the Passions</p>
<p>THE fable is, that Semele, Jupiter’s mistress, having bound him by an
inviolable oath to grant her an unknown request, desired he would
embrace her in the same form and manner he used to embrace Juno; and the
promise being irrevocable, she was burnt to death with lightning in the
performance. The embryo, however, was served up, and carried in
Jupiter’s thigh till the complete time of its birth; but the burthen
thus rendering the father lame, and causing him pain, the child was
thence called Dionysus. When born, he was committed, for some years, to
be nursed by Proserpina; and when grown up, appeared with so effeminate
a face, that his sex seemed somewhat doubtful He also died, and was
buried for a time, but afterwards revived. When a youth, he first
introduced the cultivation and dressing of vines, the method of
preparing wine, and taught the use thereof; whence becoming famous, he
subdued the world, even to the utmost bounds of the Indies. He rode in a
chariot drawn by tigers. There danced about him certain deformed demons
called Cobali, andandandandc. The Muses also joined in his train. He
married Ariadne, who was deserted by Theseus. The ivy was sacred to him.
He was also held the inventor and instructor of religious rites and
ceremonies, but such as were wild, frantic and full of corruption and
cruelty. He had also the power of striking men with frenzies. Pentheus
and Orpheus were torn to pieces by the frantic women at his orgies; the
first for climbing a tree to behold their ceremonies, and the other for
the music of his harp. But the acts of this god are much entangled and
confounded with those of Jupiter.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - This fable seems to contain a little system of
morality, so that there is scarce any better invention in all ethics.
Under the history of Bacchus is drawn the nature of unlawful desire or
affection, and disorder; for the appetite and thirst of apparent good is
the mother of all unlawful desire, though ever so destructive, and all
unlawful desires are conceived in unlawful wishes or requests, rashly
indulged or granted before they are well understood or considered, and
when the affection begins to grow warm, the mother of it (the nature of
good) is destroyed and burnt up by the heat. And whilst an unlawful
desire lies in the embryo, or unripened in the mind, which is its
father, and here represented by Jupiter, it is cherished and concealed,
especially in the inferior part of the mind, corresponding to the thigh
of the body, where pain twitches and depresses the mind so far as to
render its resolutions and actions imperfect and lame. And even after
this child of the mind is confirmed, and gains strength by consent and
habit, and comes forth into action, it must still be nursed by
Proserpina for a time; that is, it skulks and hides its head in a
clandestine manner, as it were under ground, till at length, when the
checks of shame and fear are removed, and the requisite boldness
acquired, it either assumes the pretext of some virtue, or openly
despises infamy. And it is justly observed, that every vehement passion
appears of a doubtful sex, as having the strength of a man at first, but
at last the impotence of a woman. It is also excellently added, that
Bacchus died and rose again; for the affections sometimes seem to die
and be no more; but there is no trusting them, even though they were
buried, being always apt and ready to rise again whenever the occasion
or object offers.</p>
<p>That Bacchus should be the inventor of wine carries a fine allegory
with it; for every affection is cunning and subtile in discovering a
proper matter to nourish and feed it; and of all things known to
mortals, wine is the most powerful and effectual for exciting and
inflaming passions of all kinds, being indeed like a common fuel to
all.</p>
<p>It is again with great elegance observed of Bacchus, that he subdued
provinces, and undertook endless expeditions, for the affections never
rest satisfied with what they enjoy, but with an endless and insatiable
appetite thirst after something further. And tigers are prettily feigned
to draw the chariot; for as soon as any affection shall, from going on
foot, be advanced to ride, it triumphs over reason, and exerts its
cruelty, fierceness, and strength against all that oppose it.</p>
<p>It is also humorously imagined, that ridiculous demons dance and
frisk about this chariot; for every passion produces indecent,
disorderly, interchangeable, and deformed motions in the eyes,
countenance, and gesture, so that the person under the impulse, whether
of anger; insult; love, andandandandc., though to, himself he may seem
grand, lofty, or obliging, yet in the, eyes of others appears mean,
contemptible, or ridiculous.</p>
<p>The Muses also are found in the train of Bacchus, for there is scarce
any passion without its art, science, or doctrine to court and flatter
it; but in this respect the indulgence of men of genius has greatly
detracted from the majesty of the Muses, who ought to be the leaders and
conductors of human life, and not the handmaids of the passions.</p>
<p>The allegory of Bacchus falling in love with a cast mistress, is
extremely noble; for it is certain that the affections always court and
covet what has been rejected upon experience. And all those who by
serving and indulging their passions immensely raise the value of
enjoyment, should know, that whatever they covet and pursue, whether
riches, pleasure, glory, learning, or anything else, they only pursue
those things that have been forsaken and cast off with contempt by great
numbers in all ages, after possession and experience.</p>
<p>Nor is it without a mystery that the ivy was sacred to Bacchus, and
this for two reasons: first, because ivy is an evergreen, or flourishes
in the winter; and secondly, because it winds and creeps about so many
things, as trees, walls, and buildings, and raises itself above them. As
to the first, every passion grows fresh, strong, and vigorous by
opposition and prohibition, as it were by a kind of contrast or
antiperistasis, like the ivy, in the winter. And for the second, the
predominant passion of the mind throws itself, like the ivy, round all
human actions, entwines all our resolutions, and perpetually adheres to,
and mixes itself among, or even overtops them.</p>
<p>And no wonder that superstitious rites and ceremonies are attributed
to Bacchus, when almost every ungovernable passion grows wanton and
luxuriant in corrupt religions; nor again, that fury and frenzy should
be sent and dealt out by him, because every passion is a short frenzy,
and if it be vehement, lasting, and take deep root, it terminates in
madness. And hence the allegory of Pentheus and Orpheus being torn to
pieces is evident; for every headstrong passion is extremely bitter,
severe, inveterate, and revengeful upon all curious inquiry, wholesome
admonition, free counsel and persuasion.</p>
<p>Lastly, the confusion between the persons of Jupiter and Bacchus will
justly admit of an allegory, because noble and meritorious actions may
sometimes proceed from virtue, sound reason, and magnanimity, and
sometimes again from a concealed passion and secret desire of ill,
however they may be extolled and praised, insomuch that it is not easy
to distinguish betwixt the acts of Bacchus and the acts of Jupiter.</p>
