<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>Among the parts of history which I have mentioned, the history of
arts is of most use because it exhibits things in motion and leads more
directly to practice. Moreover, it takes off the mask and veil from
natural objects, which are commonly concealed and obscured under the
variety of shapes and external appearance. Finally, the vexations of art
are certainly as the bonds and handcuffs of Proteus, which betray the
ultimate struggles and efforts of matter. For bodies will not be
destroyed or annihilated, rather than that they will turn themselves
into various forms. Upon this history, therefore, mechanical and
illiberal as it may seem (all fineness and daintiness set aside), the
greatest diligence must be bestowed.</p>
<p>Again, among the particular arts those are to be preferred which
exhibit, alter, and prepare natural bodies and materials of things, such
as agriculture, cookery, chemistry, dyeing, the manufacture of glass,
enamel, sugar, gunpowder, artificial fires, paper, and the like. Those
which consist principally in the subtle motion of the hands or
instruments are of less use, such as weaving, carpentry, architecture,
manufacture of mills, clocks, and the like, although these too are by no
means to be neglected, both because many things occur in them which
relate to the alterations of natural bodies, and because they give
accurate information concerning local motion, which is a thing of great
importance in very many respects.</p>
<p>But in the whole collection of this history of arts it is especially
to be observed and constantly borne in mind that not only those
experiments in each art which serve the purpose of the art itself are to
be received, but likewise those which turn up anyhow by the way. For
example, that locusts or crabs, which were before of the color of mud,
turn red when baked is nothing to the table; but this very instance is
not a bad one for investigating the nature of redness, seeing that the
same thing happens in baked bricks. In like manner the fact that meat is
sooner salted in winter than in summer is not only important for the
cook that he may know how to regulate the pickling, but is likewise a
good instance for showing the nature and impression of cold. Therefore,
it would be an utter mistake to suppose that my intention would be
satisfied by a collection of experiments of arts made only with the view
of thereby bringing the several arts to greater perfection. For though
this be an object which in many cases I do not despise, yet my meaning
plainly is that all mechanical experiments should be as streams flowing
from all sides into the sea of philosophy. But how to select the more
important instances in every kind (which are principally and with the
greatest diligence to be sought and as it were hunted out) is a point to
be learned from the prerogatives of instances.</p>
