<h4 id="v.-century.">V. Century.</h4>
<p>WE will now enquire of Plants or Vegetables: And we shall doe it with
diligence. They are the principall Part of the Third Dayes Worke. They
are the first Producat, which is the Word of Animation: For the other
Words are but the Words of Essence; And they are of excellent and
generall Vse, for Food, Medicine, and a Number of Mechanicall Arts.</p>
<p>There were sowen in a Bed, Turnip-Seed, Radish-Seed, Wheat,
Cucumber-Seed, and Pease. The Bed we call a Hot-Bed, and the Manner of
it is this. There was taken Horse-dung, old, and well rotted; This was
laid vpon a Banke, halfe a foot high, and supported round about with
Planks; And vpon the Top was cast Sifted Earth, some two Fingers deepe;
And then the Seed Sprinkled vpon it, hauing beene steeped all night in
Water Mixed with Cow dung. The Turnip-Seed, and the Wheat came vp halfe
an Inch aboue Ground, within two dayes after, without any Watring. The
Rest the third day. The Experiment was made in October; And (it may be)
in the Spring, the Accelerating would haue beene the speedier. This is a
Noble Experiment; For without this helpe, they would haue beene foure
times as long in comming vp. But there doth not occurre to me, at this
present, any vse thereof, for profit; Except it should be for Sowing of
Pease; which haue their Price very much increased, by the early Comming.
It may be tried also with Cherries, Strawberries, and other Fruit, which
are dearest, when they come early.</p>
<p>There was Wheat, steeped in Water mixed with Cow-Dung; Other in Water
mixed with Horse-Dung; Other in Water mixed with Pigeon-Dung; Other in
Vrine of Man; Other in Water mixed with Chalke powdred; Other in Water
mixed with Soot; Other in Water mixed with Ashes; Other in Water mixed
with Bay-Salt; Other in Claret Wine; Other in Malmsey; Other in Spirìt
of Wine. The Proportion of the Mixture was, a fourth Part of the
Ingredients to the Water; Saue that there was not of the Salt aboue an
eighth Part. The Vrine, and Wines, and Spirit of Wine, were Simple
without Mixture of Water. The Time of the Steeping was twelue houres.
The Time of the Yeare October. There was also other Wheat sowen
vnsteeped, but watred twice a day with Warme water. There was also other
Wheat sowen Simple to compare it with the rest. The Euent was; That
those that were in the Mixture of Dung, and Vrine, and Soot, Chalke,
Ashes, and Salt, came vp within fix dayes: And those that afterwards
proued the Highest, Thickest, and most Lustie, were; First the Vrine;
And then the Dungs, Next the Chalke; Next the Soot; Next the Ashes; Next
the Salt; Next the Wheat Simple of it selfe, vnsteeped, and vnwatered;
Next the Watered twice a day with warme water; Next the Claret Wine. So
that these three last were slower than the ordinary Wheat of it selfe;
And this Culture did rather retard, than aduance. As for those that were
steeped in Malmsey, and Spirit of Wine, they came not vp at all. This is
a Rich Experiment for Profit; For the most of the Steel pings are Cheape
Things; And the Goodnesse of the Crop is a great Matter of Gaine; If the
Goodnesse of the Crop answer the Earlinesse of the Comming vp: As it is
like it will; Both being from the vigour of the Seed; Which also partly
appeared in the Former Experiments, as hath beene said. This Experiment
would be tried in other Graines, Seeds, and Kernells: For it may be some
Steeping will agree best with some Seeds. It would be tried also with
Roots steeped as before, but for longer time. It would be tried also in
Seuerall Seasons of the yeare, especially the Spring.</p>
<p>Strawberries watered now and then, (as once in three dayes,) with
Water, wherein hath beene steeped Sheepes-dung, or Pigeons-dong, will
preuent and come early. And it is like, the same Effect would follow in
other Berries, Herbs, Flowers, Graines, or Trees. And therefore it is an
Experiment, though vulgar in Strawberries, yet not brought into vse
generally: For it is vsuall to helpe the Ground with Mucke; And likewise
to Recomfort it sometimes with Mucke put to the Roots; But to water it
with Mucke water, which is like to be more Forcible, is not
practised.</p>
<p>Dung, or Chalke, or Bloud, applied in Substance, (seasonably,) to the
Roots of Trees, doth set them forwards. But to doe it vnto Herbs,
without Mixture of Water or Earth, it may be these Helpes are too
Hot.</p>
<p>The former Meanes of Helping Germination, are either by the Goodnesse
and Strength of the Nourishment; Or by the Comforting, and Exciting the
Spirits in the Plant, to draw the Nourishment better. And of this latter
kinde, concerning the Comforting of the Spirits of the Plant, arealso
the experiments that follow; Though they be not Applications to the
Root, or Seed. The Planting of Trees warme vpon a Wall, against the
South, or South-East Sunne, doth hasten their Comming on, and Ripening;
And the South-East is found to be better than the SouthWest, though the
South-West be the Hotter Coast. But the cause is chiefly, for that the
Heat of the Morning succeedeth the Cold of the Night: and partly,
because (many times) the South-west Sunne is too Parching. So likewise
the Planting of them vpon the Backe of a Chimney, where a Fire is kept,
doth hasten their Comming on, and Ripening: Nay more, the Drawing of the
Boughes into the Inside of a Roome, where a Fire is continually kept,
worketh the same Effect; Which hath beene tried with Grapes; In so much
as they will come a Moneth earlier, than the Grapes abroad.</p>
<p>Besides the two Meanes of Accelerating Germination, formerly
described; That is to say, the Mending of the Nourishment; and
Comforting of the Spirit of the Plant; there is a Third; Which is the
Making way for the Easie Comming to the Nourishment, and Drawing it. And
therefore Gentle Digging and Loosening of the Earth about the Roots of
Trees; And the Remening Herbs and Flowers into new Earth, once in two
yeares, (which is the same thing, For the new Earth is euer looser,)
doth greatly further the Prospering, and Earlinesse of Plants.</p>
<p>But the most admirable Acceleration by Facilitating the Nourishment,
is that of Water. For a Standard of a Damaske Rose with the Root on, was
set in a Chamber, where no Fire was, vpright in an Earthen Pan, full of
Faire Water, without any Mixture, halfe a foot vnder the Water, the
Standard being more then two foot high aboue the Water: Within the Space
of ten dayes, the Standard did put forth a faire Greene lease, and some
other little Buds, which stood at a stay, without any Shew of decay or
withering, more then seuen Daies. But afterwards that Leafe faded, but
the young Buds did sprout on; which afterward opened into faire Leaues,
in the space of three Moneths; And continued so a while after, till vpon
Remouall wee left the Triall. But note that the Leaues were somewhat
paler, and lighter-coloured, than the Leaues vse to be abroad. Note that
the first Buds were in the End of October; And it is likely that if it
had beene in the Spring time, it would haue put forth with greater
strength, and (it may be) to haue growne on to beare Flowers. By this
Meanes, you may haue, (as it seemeth,) Roses set in the middest of a
Poole, being supported with some stay; Which is Matter of Rarenesse and
Pleasure, though of small Vse. This is the more strange, for that the
like Rose-Standard was put, at the same time, into Water, mixed with
Horse-dung, the Horse-dung about the fourth Part to the Water, and in
foure Moneths space (while it was obserued) put not forth any Leafe,
though diuers Buds at the first, as the other.</p>
<p>A Dutch Flower, that had a Bulbous Root, was likewise put, at the
same time, all vnder Water, some two or three Fingers deepe; And within
seuen dayes sprouted, and continued long after, further Growing. There
were also put in, a Beet-Root, a Borrage-Root, and a RaddishRoot, which
had al their Leaues cut almost close to the Roots; And within six weekes
had faire Leaues; And so continued, till the end of Nouember.</p>
<p>Note that if Roots, or Pease, or Flowers, may be Accelerated in their
Comming and Ripening, there is a double Profit; The one in the high
Price that those Things beare when they come early: The other in the
Swiftnesse of their Returnes: For in some Grounds which are strong, you
shall haue a Raddish, andandandandc. come in a Month; That in other
Grounds will not come in two; And so make double Returnes.</p>
<p>Wheat also was put into the Water, and came not forth at all; So as
it seemeth there must be some Strength and Bulke in the Body, put into
the Water, as it is in Roots; For Graines, or Seeds, the Cold of the
Water will mortifie. But casually some Wheat lay vnder the Pan, which
was somewhat moistned by the Suing of the Pan; which in six weekes (as
aforesaid) looked mouldy to the Eye, but it was sprouted forth halfe a
Fingers length.</p>
<p>It seemeth by these Instances of Water, that for Nourishment, the
Water is almost all in all, and that the Earth doth but keepe the Plant
vpright, and saue it from Ouer-heat, and Ouer-cold; And therefore is a
Comfortable Experiment for good Drinkers. It proueth also that our
former Opinion; That Drinke incorporate with Flesh, or Roots, (as in
Capon-Baere, andandandandc.) will nourish more easily, than Meat and
Drinke taken seuerally.</p>
<p>The Nousing of Plants (I conceiue) will both Accelerate Germination,
and bring forth Flowers and Plants in the Colder Seasons: And as wee
House Hot-Countrey Plants, as Limons, Orenges, Myrtles, to saue them; So
we may House our owne Countrey Plants, to forward them, and make them
come in the Cold Seasons; In such sort, that you may haue Violets,
Strawberries, Pease, all Winter: So that you sow, or remoue them at fit
times. This Experiment is to be referred vnto the Comforting of the
Spirit of the Plant, by Warmth, as well as Housing their Boughes,
andandandandc. So then the Meanes, to Accelerate Germination, are in
Particular eight, in Generall three.</p>
<p>To make Roses, or other Flowers come late, it is an Experiment of
Pleasure. For the Ancients esteemed much of Rosa Sera. And indeed the
Nouember-Rose is the sweetest, hauing beene lesse exhaled by the Sunne.
The Meanes are these. First, the Cutting off their Tops, immediately
after they haue done Bearing; And then they will come againe the same
yeare about Nouember: But they will not come iust on the Tops, where
they were cut, but out of those Shoots, which were as it were,)
Water-Boughes. The Cause is, for that the Sap, which otherwise would
haue fed the Top, (though after Bearing,) will, by the discharge of
that, diuert vnto the Side-Sprouts; And they will come to beare, but
later.</p>
<p>The Second is the Pulling off the Buds of the Rose, when they are
Newly knotted; For then the Side-Branches will beare. The Cause is the
same with the former: For Cutting off the Tops, and Pulling off the
Buds, worke the same Effect, in Retention of the Sap for a time, and
Diuersion of it to the Sprouts, that were not so forward.</p>
<p>The Third is the Cutting off some few of the Top-Roughes in the
Spring-time, but suffering the lower Boughes to grow on. The Cause is,
for that the Boughes doe helpe to draw vp the Sap more strongly; And we
see that in Powling of Trees, many doe vse to leaue a Bough or two on
the Top, to helpe to draw vp the Sap. And it is coparated also, that if
you graft vpon the Bough of a Tree, and cut off some of the old Boughes,
the new Cions will perish.</p>
<p>The Fourth is by Laying the Roots bare about christmus, some dayes.
The Cause is plaine, for that it doth —— the Sap, from going vpwards,
for a time; Which Arrest is after wards released by the Couering of the
Root a gaine with Earth; And then the Sap getteth vp, but later.</p>
<p>The Fifth is the Re —— of the Tree, some Moneth before it Buddes. The
cause is, for that some time will be required after the Re — e, for the
Reselting; before it can draw the Iuycs: And that time being lost, the
Blossome u — needs some forth later.</p>
<p>The Sixth is the Grasting of Kaser in May, which commonly Gardiners
doe not till Inly; And then they beare not till the Next Yeare; But if
you graft them in May, they will beare the same yeare, but late.</p>
<p>The Seuenth is, the Girding of the Body of the Tree about with some
Pack-threed; For that also, in a degree, restraineth the Sap, and maketh
it come vp, more late, and more Slowly.</p>
<p>The Eighth in, the Planting of them — Shade, or in a Hedge; The Cause
is, partly the Keeping out of the Sunne, which hasteneth the Sap to
rise; And partly the Robbing of them of Nourishment, by the S-uffe in
the Hedge. These Meanes may be practised vpon other, both Trees, and
Flowers, M〈10 letters〉</p>
<p>Men haue entertained a Conceit that sheweth prettily; Namely, that if
you grast a Late Comming Fruit, vpon a Stocke of a Fruit-tree that —— —
early, the Graft will beare Fruit Early. At a Peach vpon a Cherry; And
contrariwise, if an Early-Comming Fruit vpon a Stocke of a Fruit-Tree
that Commeth late, the Grafe will beare Fruit late; As a Cherry vpon a
Peach. But these are but Imaginations, and vntrue. The Cause is, for
that the Cions ouerroleth the Stocke quite; And the Stocke is but Passue
onely, and giueth Aliment, but no Motion to the Graft.</p>
<p>We will speake now, how to make Fruits, Flowers, and Ro- larger; in
more plenty; and sweeter; than they vse to be; And how to make the Trees
themselues, more Tall; more Spread; and more Hasty and Sudden; than they
vse to be. Wherein there is no doubt, but the former Experiments of
Acceleration, will serue much to these Purposes. And againe, that these
Experiments, which we shall now set downe, doe serue also for
Acceleration; because both Effects proceed from the Encrease of vigour
in the Tree, But yet to auoid Confusion; And because some of the Meanes
are more proper for the one Effect, and some for the other, wee will
handle them apart.</p>
<p>It is an assured Experience, that an Heape of flint, or Stone, laid
about the Bottome of a Wilde-Tree, (as an Oake, Elme, Ash,
andandandandc.) vpon the first Planting, doth make it prosper double as
much, as without it. The Cause is, for that it retaineth the Moisture,
which falleth at any time vpon the Tree, and suffereth it not to be
exhaled by the Sunne. Againe, it keepeth the Tree warme, from Cold
Blasts and Frosts, as it were in an House. It may be also, there is
somewhat in the Keeping of it steady at the first. Quare, if Laying of
Straw some Height about the Body of a Tree, will not make the Tree
forwards. For though the Root giueth the Sap, yet it is the Body that
draweth it. But you must note, that if you lay Stones about the stalke
of Lettuce, or other Plants, that are more soft, it will ouer-moisten
the Roots, so as the Wormes will eat them.</p>
<p>A Tree, at the first Setting, should not be Shaken, vntill it hath
taken Root fully: And therefore some haue, put two little Forkes about
the Bottome of their Trees, to keepe them vpright; But after a yeares
Rooting, then Shaking doth the Tree good, by Loosening of the Earth, and
(perhaps) by Exercising (as it were) and Stirring the Sap of the
Tree.</p>
<p>Generally, the Cutting away of Boughes and Suckers at the Root and
Body, doth make Trees grow high; And contrariwise, the Powling and
Cutting of the Top, maketh them grow spread, and bushy. As wee see in
Pollards, andandandandc.</p>
<p>It is reported, that to make hasty Growing Coppice-Woods, the way is,
to take Willow, Sallow, Poplar, Alder, of some seuen yeares growth; And
to set them, not vpright, but a-slope, a reasonable depth vnder the
Ground; And then, instead of one Root, they will put forth many, and so
carry more Shoots vpon a Stemme.</p>
<p>When you would haue many new Roots of Fruit-trees, take a Low Tree,
and bow it, and lay all his Branches a-flat vpon the Ground, and cast
Earth vpon them; And euery Twigge will take Root. And this is a very
profitable Experiment for Costly Trees; (for the Boughtes will make
Stockes without charge;) Such as are Apricots, Peaches, Almonds,
Cornelians, Mulberries, Figs, andandandandc. The like is continually
practised with Vines, Roses, Muske-Roses, andandandandc.</p>
<p>From May to Iuly you may take off the Barke of any Bough, being of
the Bignesse of three or foure Inches, and couer the bare Place,
somewhat aboue, and below, with Loame well tempered with Horse-dung,
binding it fast downe. Then cut off the Bough about Alhollontide in the
bare place, and set it in the Ground; And it will grow to be a faire
Tree in one Yeare. The Cause may be, for that the Baring from the Barke
keepeth the Sap from descending towards Winter, and so holdeth it in the
Bough; And it may be also that the Loame and Horse-Dung applied to the
bare place, doe moisten it, and cherish it, and make it more apt to put
forth the Root. Note, that this may be a generall Meanes for keeping vp
the Sap of Trees in their Boughes; Which may serue to other Effects.</p>
<p>It hath beene practised in Trees, that shew faire, and beare not, to
Bore a Hole thorow the Heart of the Tree, and thereupon it will beare.
Which may be for that the Tree before had too much Repletion, and was
oppressed with his owne Sap; For Repletion is an Enemy to
Generation.</p>
<p>It hath beene practised in Trees, that doe not beare, to cleaue two
or three of the Chiese Roots, and to put into the Cleft a small Pebble,
which may keepe it open, and then it will beare. The Cause may be, for
that a Root of a Tree may be (as it were,) Hide-bound, no lesse than the
Body of the Tree; But it will not keepe open without somewhat put into
it.</p>
<p>It is vsually practised, to set Trees that require much Sunne, vpon
Walls against the South; As Apricots, Peaches, Plums, Vines, Figs, and
the like. It hath a double Commodity; The one, the Heat of the Wall by
Reflexion; The other, the Taking away of the Shade; For when a Tree
groweth round, the vpper Boughes ouer-shadow the lower; But when it is
spread vpon a Wall, the Sunne commeth alike, vpon the vpper, and lower
Branches.</p>
<p>It hath also beene practised (by some) to pull off some Leanes from
the Trees so spread, that the Sunne may come vpon the Bough and Fruit
the better. There hath beene practised also a Curiosity, to set a Tree
vpon the North-Side of a Wall, and at a little height, to draw him
thorow the Wall, and spread him vpon the South-Side: Conceiuing that the
Root and lower Part of the Stocke should enioy the Freshnesse of the
Shade; And the Vpper Boughes, and Fruit, the Comsort of the Sunne. But
it sorted not; The Cause is, for that the Root requireth some Comsort
from the Sunne, though vnder Earth, as well as the Body: And the Lower
Part of the Body more than the Vpper, as wee see in Compassing a Tree
below with Straw.</p>
<p>The Lownesse of the Bough, where the Fruit commeth, maketh the Fruit
greater, and to ripen better; For you shall euer see in Apricots,
Peaches, or Melo-Cotones, vpon a wall, the greatest Fruits towards the
Bottome. And in France the Grapes that make the Wine, grow vpon low
Vines, bound to small Stakes. And the raised Vines in Arbours make but
Veriuyce. It is true, that in Italy, and other Countries, where they
haue hotter Sunne, they raise them vpon Elmes, and Trees; But I
conceiue, that if the French Manner of Planting low, were brought in vse
there, their Wines would be stronger and sweeter. But it is more
chargeable in respect of the Props. It were good to try whether a Tree
grafted somewhat neare the Ground, and the lower boughes onely
maintained, and the higher continually proined off, would not make a
larger Fruit.</p>
<p>To haue Fruit in Greater Plenty, the way is, to graft, not onely vpon
young Stockes, but vpon diuers Boughes of an old Tree; for they will
beare great Numbers of Fruit; Whereas if you graft but vpon one Stocke,
the Tree can beare but few.</p>
<p>The Digging yearely about the Roots of Trees, which is a great means,
both to the Acceleration and Melioration of Fruits, is practised in
nothing but in Vines; Which if it were transferred vnto other Trees, and
Shrubs, (as Roses, andandandandc.) I conceiue would aduance them
likewise.</p>
<p>It hath beene knowne, that a Fruit-Tree hath beene blowne vp (almost)
by the Roots, and set vp againe, and the next yeare bare exceedingly.
The Cause of this, was nothing but the Looseming of the Earth, which
comforteth any Tree, and is fit to be practised, more than it is, in
Fruit-Trees: For Trees cannot be so fitly remoued into New Grounds, as
Flowers and Herbs may.</p>
<p>To reuiue an Old Tree, the Digging of it about the Roots, and
Applying new Mould to the Roots, is the way. We see also that
DraughtOxen, put into fresh Pasture, gather new and tender Flesh; And in
all Things, better Nourishment than hath beene vsed, doth helpe to
renew; Especially, if it be not onely better, but changed, and differing
from the former.</p>
<p>If an Herbe be cut off from the Roots, in the beginning of Winter,
and then the Earth be troden and beaten downe hard, with the Foot and
Spade, the Roots will become of very great Magnitude in Summer. The
Reason is, for that the Moisture being forbidden to come vp in the
Plant, stayeth longer in the Root, and so dilateth it. And Gardiners vse
to tread downe any loose Ground, after they haue sowne Onions, or
Turnips, andandandandc.</p>
<p>If Panicum be laid below, and about the Bottome of a Root, it will
cause the Root to grow to an Excessiue Bignesse. The Cause is, for that
being it selfe of a Spungy Substance, it draweth the Moisture of the
Earth to it, and so feedeth the Root. This is of greatest vse for
Onions, Turnips, Parsnips, and Carrets.</p>
<p>The Shifting of Ground is a Meanes to better the Tree, and Fruit; But
with this Caution; That all Things doe prosper best, when they are
aduanced to the better: Your Nursery of Stockes ought to be in a more
Barren Ground, than the Ground is whereunto you remoue them. So all
Grasiers preferre their Cattell from meaner Pastures to better. We see
also, that Hardnesse in Youth lengthneth Life, because it leaueth a
Cherishing to the better, of the Body, in Age: Nay in Exercises, it is
good to begin with the hardest, as Dancing in Thicke Shooes,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, that Hacking of Trees in their Barke, both
downe-right, and acrosse, so as you make them rather in slices, than in
continued Hacks, doth great good to Trees; And especially deliuereth
them from being Hide-bound, and killeth their Mosse.</p>
<p>Shade to some Plants conduceth to make them large, and prosperous,
more than Sun; As in Strawberries, and Bayes, andandandandc. Therefore
amongst Strawberries, sow here and there some Barrage-Seed; And you
shall finde the Strawberries vnder those Leaues farro more large than
their Fellowes. And Bayes you must plant to the North; Or defond them
from the Sunne by a Hedge-Row; And when you sow the Berries, weed not
the Borders, for the first halfe yeare; For the Weed giueth them
Shade.</p>
<p>To increase the Crops of Ph — , there would be considered, not only
the Increasing the Lust of the Earth, or of the Plant, but the Sauing
also of that which is spilt. So they haue lately made a Triall, to Set
Wheat; which neuerthelesse hath beene left off, because of the trouble
and paines; Yet so much is true, that there is much saued by the
Setting, in comparison of that which is Sewen; Both by keeping it from
being picked vp by Birds; And by Auoiding the Shallow lying of it,
whereby much that is sowen taketh no Root.</p>
<p>It is prescribed by some of the Ancients, that you take Small Trees,
vpon which Figs or other Fruit grow, being yet vnripe, and couer the
Trees in the Middle of Autamne with dung, vntill the Spring; And then
take them vp in a warme day, and replant them in good Ground; And by
that meanes, the former yeares Tree will be ripe, as by a new Birth;
when other Trees of the fame kinde, doe but blossome. But this seemeth
to haue no great Probabilitie.</p>
<p>It is reported, that if you take Nitre, and mingle it with Water, to
the thicknesse of Honey, and therewith anoint the Bud, after the Vine is
cut, it will sprout forth within eight dayes. The Cause is like to be,
(if the Experiment be true,) the Opening of the Bud, and of the Parts
Contiguous, by the Spirit of the Nitre; For Nitre is (as it were) the
Life of Vegetables.</p>
<p>Take Seed, or Kernells of Apples, Peares, Orenges; Or a Peach, or a
Plum Stone, andandandandc. And put them into a Squill, (which is like a
great Onion,) and they will come vp much earlier than in the Earth it
selfe. This I conceiue no be as a Kinde of Grafting in the Root; For as
the Stocke of a Graft yeeldeth better prepared Nourishment to the Graft,
than the Crude Earth; So the Squill doth the like to the Seed. And I
suppose the same would be done, by Putting Kernells into a Turnip, or
the like; Saue that the Squill is more Vigorous, and Hot. It may be
tried also, with putting Onion-Seed into an Onion-Head, which thereby
(perhaps) will bring forth a larger, and earlier Onion.</p>
<p>The Pricking of a Fruit in seuerall places, when it is almost at his
Bignesse, and before it ripeneth, hath beene practised with successe, to
ripen the Fruit more suddenly. Wee see the Example of the Biting of
Waspes, or Wormes, vpon Fruit, whereby it (manifestly) ripeneth the
sooner.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Alga Marina (Sea-weed) put vnder the Roots of
Coleworts, and (perhaps) of other Plants, will further their Growth. The
vertue (no doubt) hath Relation to Salt, which is a great Helpe to
Fertilitie.</p>
<p>It hath beene practised, to cut off the Stalkes of Cucumbers,
immediately after their Bearing, close by the Earth; And then to cast a
prettie Quantitie of Earth vpon the Plant that remaineth; and they will
beare the next yeare Fruit, long before the ordinary time. The Cause may
be, for that the Sap goeth downe the sooner, and is not spent in the
Stalke or Lease, which remaineth after the Fruit. Where note, that the
Dying, in the winter, of the Roots of Plants, that are Annuall, seemeth
to be partly caused by the Ouer-Expence of the Sap into Stalke, and
Leaues; which being preuented, they will super-annate, if they stand
warme.</p>
<p>The Pulling off many of the Blossomes from a Fruit-Tree, doth make
the Fruit fairer. The Cause is manifest; For that the Sap hath the lesse
to nourish. And it is a Common Experience, that if you doe not pull off
some Blossomes, the first time a Tree bloometh, it will blossome it
selfe to death.</p>
<p>It were good to trie, what would be the Effect, if all the Blossomes
were pulled from a Fruit-Tree; Or the Acornes and Chesnut-buds,
andandandandc. from a Wilde Tree, for two yeares together. I suppose
that the Tree will either put forth, the third yeare, bigger, and more
plentifull Fruit; Or else, the same yeares, larger Leaues, because of
the Sap stored vp.</p>
<p>It hath beene generally receiued, that a Plant Watered with Warme
Water, will come vp sooner and better, than with Cold Water, or with
Showers. But our Experiment of Watering Wheat with Warme Water (as hath
beene said) succeeded not; which may be, because the Triall was too late
in the Yeare, vix. in the End of October. For the Cold then comming vpon
the Seed, after it was made more tender by the Warme Water, might checke
it.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, but that Grafting (for the most Part) doth
meliorate the Fruit. The Cause is manifest; For that the Nourishment is
better prepared in the Stocke, than in the Crude Earth: But yet note
well, that there be some Trees, that are said to come vp more happily
from the Kernell, than from the Graft; As the Peach, and Melocotone. The
Cause I suppose to he, for that those Plants require a Nourishment of
great Moisture; And though the Nourishment of the Stocke be finer, and
better prepared, yet it is not so moist, and plentifull, as the
Nourishment of the Earth. And indeed we see those Fruits are very Cold
Fruits in their Nature.</p>
<p>It hath beene receiued, that a Smaller Peare, grafted vpon a Stocke
that beareth a greater Peare, will become Great. But I thinke it is as
true, as that of the Prime-Fruit vpon the Late Stocke; And è conuerso;
which we reiected before: For the Cions will gouerne. Neuerthelesse it
is probable enough, that if you can get a Cions to grow vpon a Stocke of
another kinde, that is much moister than his owne Stocke, it may make
the Fruit Greater, because it will yeeld more plentifull nourishment;
Though it is like it will make the Fruit Baser. But generally, the
Grafting is vpon a dryer Stock; As the Apple vpon a Crab; The Peare vpon
a Thorne; andandandandc. Yet it is reported, that in the Low-Conntries
they will graft an Apple-Cions vpon the Stocke of a Colewort, and it
will beare a great flaggy Apple: The Kernell of which, if it be set,
will be a Colewort, and not an Apple. It were good to try, whether an
Apple-Cions will prosper, if it be grafted vpon a Sallow, or vpon a
Poplar, or vpon an Alder, or vpon an Elme, or vpon an Horse-Plumme,
which are the moistest of Trees. I haue heard that it hath beene tryed
vpon an Elme, and succeeded.</p>
<p>It is manifest by Experience, that Flowers Remoued wax greater,
because the Nourishment is more easily come by, in the loose Earth. It
may be, that Oft Regrafting of the same Cions, may likewise make Fruit
greater; As if you take a Cions, and graft it vpon a Stocke the first
yeare; And then cut it off, and graft it vpon another Stocke the second
yeare; and so for a third; Or fourth yeare; And then let it rest, it
will yeeld afterward, when it beareth, the greater Fruit.</p>
<p>Of Grafting there are many Experiments worth the Noting, but those we
reserue to a proper Place.</p>
<p>It maketh Figs better, if a Fig-Tree, when it beginneth to put forth
Leaues, haue his Top cut off. The Cause is plaine, for that the Sap hath
the lesse to seed, and the lesse way to mount: But it may be, the Figge
will come somewhat later, as was formerly touched. The same may be tried
likewise in other Trees.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Mulberries will be fairer, and the Trees more
fruitfull, if you bore the Truncke of the Tree thorow, in seuerall
places, and thrust into the Places bored, Wedges of some Hot Trees, as
Turpentine, Mastick-Tree, Guaiacum, Inniper, andandandandc. The Cause
may be, for that Aduentiue Heat doth cheare vp the Natiue Iuyce of the
Tree.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Trees will grow greater, and beare better Fruit,
if you put Salt, or Lees of Wine, or Bloud to the Root. The Cause may be
the Encreasing the Lust or Spirit of the Root; These Things being more
forcible, than ordinary Composts.</p>
<p>It is reported by one of the Ancients, that Artichoakes will be lesse
prickly, and more tender; if the Seeds haue their Tops dulled, or grated
off vpon a Stone.</p>
<p>Herbes will be tenderer, and fairer; if you take them out of Beds,
when they are newly come vp, and remoue them into Pots, with better
Earth. The Remoue from Bed to Bed was spoken of before; But that was in
seuerall yeares; This is vpon the sudden. The Cause is the same with
other Remoues, formerly mentioned.</p>
<p>Coleworts are reported by one of the Ancients, to prosper
exceedingly, and to be better tasted, if they be sometimes watred with
Salt-Water; And much more with Water mixed with Nitre; The Spirit of
which is lesse Adurent than Salt.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Cucumbers will proue more Tender, and Dainty, if
their Seeds be Steeped (a little) in Milke; The Cause may be, for that
the Seed being mollified with the Milke, will be too weake to draw the
grosser Iuyce of the Earth, but onely the finer. The same Experiment may
be made in Artichoakes, and other Seeds, when you would take away,
either their Flashinesse, or Bitternesse. They speake also, that the
like Effect followeth, of Steeping in Water mixed with Honey; But that
seemeth to me not so probable, because Honey hath too quicke a
Spirit.</p>
<p>It is reported that Cucumbers will be lesse Watry, and more
Melonlike, it in the Pit where you set them, you fill it (halfe way vp)
with Chaffe, or small Stickes, and then powre Earth vpon them; For
Cucumbers, as it seemeth, doe extremely affect Moisture; And ouer-drinke
themselues; Which this Chaffe, or Chips, forbiddeth. Nay it is further
reported, that if when a Cucumber is growne, you fet a Pot of water
about fiue or six inches distance from it, it will, in 24, houres, shoot
so much out, as to touch the Pot; Which if it be true, it is an
Experiment of an higher Nature than belongeth to this Title: For it
discouereth Perception in Plants, to moue towards that which should
helpe and comfort them, though it be at a distance. The ancient
Tradition of the Vine is far more strange: It is, that if you set a
Stake, or Prop, some distance from it, it will grow that way; Which is
farre stranger (as is said) than the other; For that Water may worke by
a Sympathy of Attraction: But this of the Stake seemeth to be a
Reasonable Discourse.</p>
<p>It hath beene touched before, that Terebration of Trees doth make
them prosper better. But it is found also, that it maketh the Fruit
sweeter, and better. The Cause is, for that notwithstanding the
Terebration, they may receiue Aliment sufficient; And yet no more than
they can well turne, and disgest; And withall doe sweat out the coursest
and vnprofitablest Iuyce; Euen as it is in Lining Creatures, which by
Moderate Feeding, and Exercise, and Sweat, attaine the soundest Habite
of Body.</p>
<p>As Terebration doth Meliorate Fruit, so, vpon the like reason, doth
Letting of Plants Blond; As Pricking Vines, or other Trees, after they
be of some Growth; And thereby letting forth Gumme, or Teares; Though
this be not to continue, as it is in Terebration, but at some Seasons.
And it is reported, that by this Artifice, Bitter Almonds haue beene
turned into Sweet.</p>
<p>The Ancients for the Dulcorating of Fruit, doe commend SwinesDung
aboue all other Dung; Which may be, because of the Moisture of that
Beast, whereby the Excrement hath lesse Acrimony; For wee see Swines and
Pigges Flesh is the Moistest of Fleshes.</p>
<p>It is obserued by some, that all Herbs wax sweeter, both in Smell and
Taste, if after they be growne vp some reasonable time, they be cut, and
so you take the latter Sprout. The Cause may be, for that the longer the
Iuyce stayeth in the Root, and Stalke, the better it concocteth. For one
of the Chiefe Causes, why Graines, Seeds, and Fruits, are more
Nourishing than Leanes, is the Length of time, in which they grow to
Maturation. It were not amisse to keepe backe the Sap of Herbs, or the
like, by some fit meanes, till the end of Summer; whereby (it may be)
they will be more Nourishing.</p>
<p>As Grafting doth generally aduance and Meliorate Fruits, aboue that
which they would be, if they were set of Kernells, or Stones, in regard
the Nourishment is better concocted; So (no doubt) euen in Grafting, for
the same cause, the Choise of the Stocke doth much; Alwayes prouided,
that it be somewhat inferiour to the Cions: For otherwise it dulleth it.
They commend much the Grafting of Peares, or Apples, vpon a Quince.</p>
<p>Besides the Meanes of Melioration of Fruits, before mentioned, it is
set downe as tryed, that a Mixture of Bran, and Swines-Dung; Or Chaffe
and Swines-Dung; (especially laid vp together for a Moneth to rot,) is a
very great Nourisher, and Comforter to a Fruit-Tree.</p>
<p>It is deliuered, that Onions wax greater, if they be taken out of the
Earth, and laid a drying twenty dayes, and then set againe; And yet
more, if the outermost Pill be taken off all ouer.</p>
<p>It is deliuered by some, that if one take the Bough of a Low
Fruittree, newly budded, and draw it gently, without hurting it, into an
Earthen Pot perforate at the bottome to let in the Plant, and then Couer
the Pot with Earth, it will yeeld a very large Fruit, within the Ground.
Which Experiment is Nothing but Potting of Plants, without Remouing, and
Leauing the Fruit in the Earth. The like, (they say,) will be effected,
by an Empty Pot without Earth in it, put ouer a Fruit, being propped vp
with a Stake, as it hangeth vpon the Tree; And the better, if some few
Pertusions be made in the Pot. Wherein, besides the Defending of the
Fruit, from Extremity of Sunne or Weather, some giue a reason, that the
Fruit, Louing and Coueting the open Aire and Sunne, is inuited by those
Pertusions, to spread and approch, as neare the open Aire, as it can;
And so enlargeth in Magnitude.</p>
<p>All Trees, in High and Sandy Grounds, are to be set deepe; And in
Watry Grounds, more shallow. And in all Trees, when they be remoued
(especially Fruit-Trees) care ought to be taken, that the Sides of the
Trees be coasted, (North and South, andandandandc.) as they stood
before. The same is said also of Stone out of the Quarry, to make it
more durable; Though that seemeth to haue lesse reason; Because the
Stone lyeth not so neare the Sunne, as the Tree groweth.</p>
<p>Timber Trees in a Coppice Wood, doe grow better, than in an Open
Field; Both because, they offer not to spread so much, but shoot vp
still in Height; And chiefly because they are defended from too much Sun
and Wind, which doe checke the Growth of all Fruit; And so (no doubt)
Fruit-Trees, or Vines, set vpon a Wall, against the Sunne, betweene
Elbowes or Buttresses of Stone, ripen more, than vpon a Plaine Wall.</p>
<p>It is said, that if Potado Roots, be set in a Pot filled with Earth,
and then the Pot with Earth be set likewise within the Ground, some two
or three Inches, the Roots will grow greater, than Ordinary. The Cause
may be, for that Hauing Earth enough within the Pot to nourish them; And
then being stopped by the Bottom of the Pot from putting Strings
downward, they must needs grow greater in Breadth, and Thicknesse. And
it may be, that all Seeds or Roots, Potted, and so set into the Earth,
will prosper the better.</p>
<p>The Cutting off the Leaues of Radish, or other Roots, in the
beginning of Winter, before they wither; And Couering againe the Root,
something high with Earth; Will preserue the Root all Winter, and make
it bigger, in the Spring following, as hath beene partly touched before.
So that there is a double Vse of this Cutting off the Leaues: For in
Plants, where the Root is the Esculent, as Radish, and Parsnips, it will
make the Root the greater: And so it will doe to the Heads of Onions.
And where the Fruit is the Esculent, by Strengthning the Root, it will
make the Fruit also the greater.</p>
<p>It is an Experiment of great pleasure, to make the Leaues of Shady
Trees, larger than ordinary. It hath beene tryed (for certaine) that a
Cions of a Weech-Elme, grafted vpon the Stocke of an Ordinary Elme, will
put forth Leaues, almost as broad as the Brimme of ones Hat. And it is
very likely, that as in Fruit-Trees, the Graft maketh a greater Fruit;
So in Trees that beare no Fruit, it will make the greater Leaues. It
would be tryed therefore in Trees of that kinde chiefly; As Birch, Asp,
Willow; And especially the Shining Willow, which they call
Swallow-Taile, because of the pleasure of the Leafe.</p>
<p>The Barrennesse of Trees, by Accident, (besides the Weaknesse of the
Soile, Seed, or Root; And the Iniury of the Weather) commeth either of
their Ouer-growing with Mosse, Or their being Hide-bound; Or their
Planting too deepe; Or by Issuing of the Sap too much into the Leaues.
For all these there are Remedies mentioned before.</p>
<p>Wee see that in Liuing Creatures, that haue Male and Female, there is
Copulation of seuerall Kindes; And so Compound Creatures; As the Mule,
that is generated betwixt the Horse and the Asse; And some other
Compounds, which we call Monsters, though more rare: And it is held,
that that Prouerbe, Africa semper aliquid Monstri parit; commeth, for
that the Fountaines of Waters there, being rare, diuers Sorts of Beasts
come from seuerall Parts to drinke; And so being refreshed, fall to
couple, and many times with seuerall Kinds. The Compounding or Mixture
of Kinds in Plants is not found out; Which neuerthelesse, if it be
possible, is more at command, than that of liuing Creatures; For that
their Lust requireth a voluntary Motion: wherefore it were One of the
most Noble Experiments touching Plants, to finde it out: For so you may
haue great Varietie of New Fruits, and Flowers yet vnknowne. Grafting
doth it not: That mendeth the Fruit, or doubleth the Flowers,
andandandandc. But it hath not the Power to make a New Kinde. For the
Cions euer ouer-ruleth the Stocke.</p>
<p>It hath beene set downe by one of the Ancients, that if you take two
Twigs of seuerall Fruit Trees, and flat them on the Sides, and then
binde them close together, and set them in the ground, they will come vp
in one Stocke; But yet they will put forth their seuerall Fruits,
without any Commixture in the Fruit. Wherein note (by the way) that
Vnitie of Continuance, is easier to procure, than Vnitie of Species. It
is reported also, that Vines of Red and White Grapes, being set in the
Ground, and the vpper Parts being flatted, and bound close together,
will put forth Grapes of the seuerall Colours, vpon the same Branch; And
Grape-Stones of seuerall Colours within the same Grape: But the more,
after a yeare or two; The Vnitie (as it seemeth) growing more Perfect.
And this will likewise helpe, if from the first Vniting, they be often
Watred; For all Moisture helpeth to Vnion. And it is prescribed also, to
binde the Bud, as soone as it commeth forth, as well as the Stocke; At
the least for a time.</p>
<p>They report, that diuers Seeds, put into a Clout, and laid in Earth
well dunged, will put vp Plants Contiguous; Which (afterwards) being
bound in, their Shoots will Incorporate. The like is said of Kernels,
put into a Bottle, with a Narrow Mouth, filled with Earth.</p>
<p>It is reported, that young Trees of seuerall kindes, set contiguous,
without any binding, and very often Watred, in a Fruitfull Ground, with
the very Luxurie of the Trees will incorporate, and grow together. Which
seemeth to me the likeliest Meanes, that hath beene propounded; For that
the Binding doth hinder the Naturall Swelling of the Tree; which, while
it is in Motion, doth better vnite.</p>
<p>There are many Ancient and Receiued Traditions and Obseruations,
touching the Sympathy and Antipathy of Plants: For that some will thriue
best growing neere others; which they impute to Sympathy: And some
worse; which they impute to Antipathy. But these are Idle and Ignorant
Conceits; And forsake the true Indication of the Causes; As the most
Part of Experiments, that concerne Sympathies and Antipathies doe. For
as to Plants, neither is there any such Secret Friendship, or Hatred, as
they imagine; And if we should be content to call it Sympathy, and
Antipathy, it is vtterly mistaken; For their Sympathy is an Antipathy,
and their Antipathy is a Sympathy: For it is thus; Wheresoeuer one Plant
draweth such a particular Iuyce out of the Earth; as it qualifieth the
Earth; So as that Iuyce which remaineth is fit for the other Plant,
there the Neighbourhood doth good; Because the Nourishments are
contrary, or seuerall: But where two Plants draw (much) the same Iuyce,
there the Neighbourhood hurteth; For the one deceiueth the other.</p>
<p>First therfore, all Plants that doe draw much Nourishment from the
Earth, and so soake the Earth, and exhaust it; hurt all Things that grow
by them; As Great Trees, (especially Ashes,) and such Trees, as spread
their Roots, neere the Top of the Ground. So the Colewort is not an
Enemy (though that were anciently receiued) to the Vine only; But it is
an Enemy to any other Plant; Because it draweth strongly the fattest
Iuyce of the Earth. And if it be true, that the Vine, when it creepeth
neere the Colewort, will turneaway; This may be, because there it
findeth worse Nourishment; For though the Root be where it was, yet (I
doubt) the Plant will bend as it nourisheth.</p>
<p>Where Plants are of seuerall Natures, and draw seuerall Iuyces out of
the Earth, there (as hath beene said) the One set by the other helpeth:
As it is set downe by diuers of the Ancients, that Rew doth prosper
much, and becommeth stronger, if it be set by a Figge-Tree: which (we
conceiue) is caused, Not by Reason of Friendship, but by Extraction of a
Contrary Iuyce: The one Drawing Iuyce fit to result Sweet, the other
bitter. So they haue set downe likewise, that a Rose set by Garlicke is
sweeter: Which likewise may be, because the more Fetide Iuyce of the
Earth goeth into the Garlicke; And the more Odorate into the Rose.</p>
<p>This wee see manifestly, that there be certaine Corne-Flowers, which
come seldome or neuer in other places, vnlesse they be set; But onely
amongst Corne: As the Blew-Bottle, a kinde of Yellow Mary Gold, Wilde
Poppy, and Fumitorie. Neither can this be, by Reason of the Culture of
the Ground, by Plowing, or Furrowing; As some Herbs, and Flowers, will
grow but in Ditches new Cast; for if the Ground lie sallow, and vnsowne,
they will not come: So as it should seeme to be the Corne, that
qualifieth the Earth, and prepareth it for their Growth.</p>
<p>This Obseruation, if it holdeth, (as it is very probable,) is of
great vse, for the Meliorating of Taste in Fruits, and Esculent Herbs;
And of the Sent of Flowers. For I doe not doubt, but if the Figge-Tree
doe make the Rew more strong, and bitter, (as the Ancients haue noted,)
good store of Rew planted about the Figge-Tree, will make the Figge more
sweet. Now the Tastes that doe most offend in Fruits, and Herbs, and
Roots, are Bitter; Harrish; Sowre; And Watrish, or Flashy. It were good
therefore to make the Trials following.</p>
<p>Take Wormewood, or Rew, and set it neere Lettuce, or Goleflory, or
Arti-hoake; And see whether the Lettuce, or the Coleflory,
andandandandc. become not the sweeter.</p>
<p>Take a Seruice-Tree, or a Cornelian-Tree, or an Elder-Tree, which wee
know haue Fruits of harsh and binding Iuyce, and set them neere a Vine,
or Figge-Tree, and see whether the Grapes, or Figs, will be the
sweeter.</p>
<p>Take Cucumbers, or Pumpions, and set them (here and there) amongst
Muske-Melons, and see whether the Melons will not be more Winy, and
better tasted. Set Cucumbers (likewise) amongst Radish, and see whether
the Radish will not be made the more Biting.</p>
<p>Take Sorrell, and set it amongst Rosps, and see whether the Rasps
will not be the sweeter.</p>
<p>Take Common Briar, and set it amongst Violets, or Wall-Flowers, and
see whether it will not make the Violets, or Wall-Flowers sweeter, and
lesse Earthy in their Smell. So set Lettuce, or Cucumbers, amongst
Rosemary, or Bayes, and see whether the Rosemary, on Bayes, will not be
the more Odorate, or Aromaticall.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, you must take heed, how you set Herbs together, that
draw much the like Iuyce. And therefore I thinke Rosemary will leese in
Sweetnesse, if it be set with Lauender, or Bayes, or the like. But yet,
if you will correct the strength of an Herbe, you shall doe well to set
other like Herbs by him, to take him downe; As if you should set Tansey
by Angelica, it may be, the Angelica would be the weaker, and fitter for
Mixture in Perfume. And if you should set Rew by Common Wormewood, it
may be, the Wormewood would turne to be like Roman Worniewood.</p>
<p>This Axiome is of large extent; And therefore would be seuered, and
refined by Triall. Neither must you expect to haue a Grasse Difference
by this kinde of Culture, but only Further Perfection.</p>
<p>Triall would be also made in Herbs Poisonous, and Purgatine, whose
ill Qualitie (perhaps) may be discharged, or attempted, by Setting
stronger Poisons; or Purgatines, by them.</p>
<p>It is reported, that the Shrub called Our Ladies Seale; (which is a
Kinde of Briony,) and Coleworts, set neere together, one or both will
die. The Cause is, for that they be both great Depredatours of the
Earth, and one of them starueth the other. The like is said of a Reed,
and a Brake; Both which are succulent; And therefore the One deceiueth
the Other. And the like of Hemlocke and Rew; Both which draw strong
luyces.</p>
<p>Some of the Ancients, and likewise diures of the Moderne Writers,
that haue laboured in Natural Magicke, haue noted a Sympathy, between
the Sunne, Moone, and some Principall Starres; And certaine Herbs, and
Plants. And so they haue denominated some Herbs Solar, and some Lunar;
And such like Toyes put into great Words. It is manifest, that there are
some Flowers, that haue Respect to the Sunne, in two Kindes; The one by
Opening and Shutting; And the other by Bowing and Inclining the Head.
For Mary-golds, Tulippa’s, Pimper-ell, and indeed most Flowers, doe open
or spread their Leaues abroad, when the Sunne shineth serene and faire:
And againe, (in some part,) close them, or gather them inward, either
towards Night, or when the Skie is ouercast. Of this there needeth no
such Solemne Reason to be assigned; As to say, that they reioyce at the
presence of the Sunne; And mourne at the Absence thereof. For it is
Nothing else, but a little Loading of the Leaues, and Swelling them at
the Bottome, with the Moisture of the Aire; whereas the drie Aire doth
extend them: And they make it a Peece of the wonder, that Garden Clauer
will hide the Stalke, when the Sunne sheweth bright; Which is Nothing,
but a full Expansion of the leaues. For the Bowing and Inclining the
Head; it is found in the great Flower of the Sunne; in Mary-golds; Wart
wort; Mallow Flowers; and others. The Cause is somewhat more Obscure
than the former; But I take it to be no other, but that the Part against
which the Sunne beateth, waxeth more faint and flaccide in the Stalke;
And thereby lesse able to support the Flower.</p>
<p>What a little Moisture will doe in Vegetables, euen though they be
dead, and seuered from the Earth, appeareth well in the Experiment of
Inglers. They take the Beard of an Oate; which (if you marke it well,)
is wreathed at the Bottome, and one smooth entire Straw at the Top. They
take only the Part that is Wreathed, and cut off the other, leauing the
Beard halfe the Breadth of a finger in length. Then they make a little
Crosse of a Quill, long-wayes of that Part of the Quill, which hath the
Pith; And Crosse-wayes of that peece of the Quill without Pith; The
whole Crosse being the Breadth of a Finger high. Then they pricke the
Bottome where the Pith is, and thereinto they put the Oaten-beard,
leauing halfe of it sticking forth of the Quill: Then they take a little
white Box of wood, to deceiue Men, as if somewhat in the Box did worke
the Feat: In which, with a Pinne, they make a little Hole, enough to
take the Beard, but not to let the Crosse sinke downe, but to sticke.
Then likewise by way of Imposture, they make a Question; As, Who is the
Fairest Woman in the Company? Or, Who hath a Gloue, or Card? And canse
Another to name diners Persons: And vpon euery Naming, they sticke the
Crosse in the Box, hauing first put it towards their Mouth, as if they
charmed it; And the Crasse stirreth not; But when they come to the
Person that they would take; As they hold the Orasse to their Mouth,
they touch the Beard with the Tip of their Tongue, and wet it; And so
sticke the Crosse in the Box; And then you shall see it turne finely and
softly, three or foure Turnes; Which is caused by the vntwining of the
Beard by the Moisture. You may see it more euidently, if you sticke the
Crosse betweene your fingers, in Stead of the Box; And therfore you may
see, that this Motion, which is effected by so little Wet, is stronger
than the Closing or Bending of the Head of a Marigold.</p>
<p>It is reported by some, that the Herb called Rosa-Solis, (wherof they
make Strong Waters,) will at the Noone-day, when the Sunne shineth hot
and bright, haue a great Dew vpon it. And therefore, that the right Name
is Ros Solis: which they impute to a Delight and Sympathy, that it hath
with the Sunne. Men fauour Wonders. It were good first to be sure, that
the Dew that is found vpon it, be not the Dew of the Morning Preserued,
when the Dew of other Herbs is breathed away; for it hath a smooth and
thicke Leafe, that doth not discharge the Dew so soone, as other Herbs
that are more Spungy and Porous. And it may be Purslane, or some other
Herb, doth the like, and is not marked. But if it be so, that it hath
more Dew at Noone, than in the Morning, then sure it seemeth to be an
Exudation of the Herb is solfe. As Plums sweat when they are set into
the Ouen: for you will not (I hope) thinke, that it is like Gedeons
Fleeel of Wood, that the Dew should fail vpon that, and no where
else.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that the Honey-dews are found more vpon Oahe-le — es,
than vpon A — of Beech, or the like: But whether any Cause be, from the
Leafe it selfe, to concoct- the Dew, Or whether it be onely, that the
Leafe is Close and Smooth; (And therefore drinketh not in the Dew, but
preserueth it;) may be doubted. It would be well inquired, whether Ma —
the Drug, doth fall but vpon certaine Herbs or L — onely. Flowers that
haue deepe Sockets, doe gather in the Bottome, a kinde of Honey; As
Honey-Suckles; (both the Woodbine, and the Trisoile;) Dillier; and the
like. And in them certainly the Flower beareth part with the Dew.</p>
<p>The Experience is, that the Froth, which they call Woodsears, (being
like a kinde of Spittle,) is found but vpon certaine Herbs, and those
Hot Ones; As Lauender-cotton, Sage, Hissope, andandandandc. Of the Cause
of this enquire further; For it seemeth a Secret. There falleth also
Mildew vpon Corne, and smutteth it; But it may be, that the same salleth
also vpon other Herbs, and is not obserued.</p>
<p>It were good, Triall were made, whether the great Consent betweene
Plants and Water, which is a principall Nourishment of them; will make
an Attraction or Distance, and not at Touch onely. Therfore take a
Vessell, and in the middle of it make a false Bottome of course Can —
affe: Fill it with E — aboue the Canuaffey and let not the Bar-h be
wa-ed; Then sow some good Seeds in that Earth, But — the Canuaffe, some
halfe a foot in the Bottome of the Vessell, lay a great Sp — ge, th —
owly wet in water; And let it lye so some ten Dayes. And see whether the
Seeds will sprout, and the Earth become more Moist, and the Spunge more
dry. The Experiment formerly mentioned of the Cucumber, creeping to the
Pot of Water, is far stranger than this.</p>
<p>The Altering of the Sent, Colour, or Taste, of Fruit, by Infusing,
Mixing, or Letting into the Barke, or Rost, of the Tree, Herb, or
Flower, any Coloured, Aromaticall, or Medicinall; Substance; are but
Fancies. The Cause is, for that those Things haue passed their Period,
and nourish not. And all Alteration of Vegetables, in those Qualitles,
must be by somewhat, that is apt to goe into the Nourishment of the
Plant. But this is true; that where Kine feed vpon Wilde Garlicke, their
Milke tasteth plainly of the Garlicke: And the Flesh of Muttons is
better tasted where the Sheepe feed vpon Wilde Thyme, and other
wholesome Herbs. Galen also speaketh of the Curing of the Scirrus of the
Liuer, by Milke of a Cow, that feedeth but vpon certaine Herbs; And
Honey in Spaine smelleth (apparently) of the Rosemary, or Orenge, from
whence the Bee gathereth it: And there is an old Tradition of a Mayden
that was fed with Napellus; (which is counted the Strongest Poyson of
all Vegetables;) which with vse did not hurt the Maid, but poisoned some
that had Carnall Company with her. So it is obserued by some, that there
is a vertuous Bexoar, and another without vertue; which appeare to the
shew alike; But the Vertuous is taken from the Beast, that feedeth vpon
the Mountaines, where there are Theriacall Herbs; And that without
Vertue; from those that feed in the Valleyes, where no such Herbs are.
Thus far I am of Opinion; That as Steeped Wines and Beeres, are very
Medicinall; and likewise Bread tempred with diuers Powders; So of Meat
also, (as Flesh, Fish, Milke, and Egges,) that they may be made of great
vse for Medicine, and Diet, if the Beasts, Fowle, or Fish, be fed with a
speciall kinde of food, fit for the Disease. It were a dangerous Thing
also for secret Empoysonthents. But whether it may be applyed vnto
Plants, and Herbs. I doubt more; Because the Nourishment of them is a
more common Iuyce; which is hardly capable of any speciall Quality,
vntill the Plant doe assimilate it.</p>
<p>But lest our Incredulity may preiudice any profitable Operations in
this kind, (especially since Many of the Ancients haue set them down,)
We thinke good briefly to propound the foure Meanes, which they haue
deuised of Making Plants Medicinable. The First is by Slitting of the
Root, and Infusing into it the Medicine; As Hellebore, Opium, Scammony,
Triacle, andandandandc. And then binding it vp againe. This seemeth to
me the least probable; Because the Root draweth immediately from the
Earth; And so the Nourishment is the more Common, and lesse Qualified:
And besides, it is a long time in Going vp, ere it come to the Fruit.
The Second Way is, to Perforate the Body of the Tree, and there to
Infuse the Medicine: Which is somewhat better: For if any Vertue be
receiued from the Medicine, it hath the lesse way, and the lesse time,
to goe vp. The Third is, the Steeping of the Seed or Kernell in some
Liquour, wherein the Medicine is Infused: Which I haue little Opinion
of, because the Seed, (I doubt,) will not draw the Parts of the Matter,
which haue the Propriety: But it will be farre the more likely, if you
mingle the Medicine with Dung; For that the Seed naturally drawing the
Moisture of the Dung, may call in withall some of the Propriety. The
fourth is, the Watring of the Plant oft, with an Infusion of the
Medicine. This, in one respect, may haue more force than the rest;
Because the Medication is oft renewed; Whereas the rest are applyed but
at one time: And therefore the Vertue may the sooner vanish. But still I
doubt, that the Root is somewhat too stubborne to receiue those fine
Impressions; And besides, (as I said before,) they haue a great Hill to
goe vp. I iudge therefore the likeliest way to be the Perforation of the
Body of the Tree, in senerall Places, one aboue the other; And the
Filling of the Holes with Dung mingled with the Medicine. And the
Watring of those Lumpes of Dung, with Squirts of an Infusion of the
Medicine in Dunged water, once in three or foure Daies.</p>
