<ol type="1">
<li><p>As for human proofs, it is so large a field, as in a discourse of
this nature and brevity it is fit rather to use choice of those things
which we shall produce, than to embrace the variety of them. First,
therefore, in the degrees of human honour amongst the heathen, it was
the highest to obtain to a veneration and adoration as a God. This unto
the Christians is as the forbidden fruit. But we speak now separately of
human testimony, according to which — that which the Grecians call
apotheosis, and the Latins relatio inter divos — was the supreme honour
which man could attribute unto man, specially when it was given, not by
a formal decree or act of state (as it was used among the Roman
Emperors), but by an inward assent and belief. Which honour, being so
high, had also a degree or middle term; for there were reckoned above
human honours, honours heroical and divine: in the attribution and
distribution of which honours we see antiquity made this difference;
that whereas founders and uniters of states and cities, lawgivers,
extirpers of tyrants, fathers of the people, and other eminent persons
in civil merit, were honoured but with the titles of worthies or
demigods, such as were Hercules, Theseus, Minus, Romulus, and the like;
on the other side, such as were inventors and authors of new arts,
endowments, and commodities towards man’s life, were ever consecrated
amongst the gods themselves, as was Ceres, Bacchus, Mercurius, Apollo,
and others. And justly; for the merit of the former is confined within
the circle of an age or a nation, and is like fruitful showers, which
though they be profitable and good, yet serve but for that season, and
for a latitude of ground where they fall; but the other is, indeed, like
the benefits of heaven, which are permanent and universal. The former
again is mixed with strife and perturbation, but the latter hath the
true character of Divine Presence, coming in aura leni, without noise or
agitation.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither is certainly that other merit of learning, in repressing
the inconveniences which grow from man to man, much inferior to the
former, of relieving the necessities which arise from nature, which
merit was lively set forth by the ancients in that feigned relation of
Orpheus’ theatre, where all beasts and birds assembled, and, forgetting
their several appetites — some of prey, some of game, some of quarrel —
stood all sociably together listening unto the airs and accords of the
harp, the sound whereof no sooner ceased, or was drowned by some louder
noise, but every beast returned to his own nature; wherein is aptly
described the nature and condition of men, who are full of savage and
unreclaimed desires, of profit, of lust, of revenge; which as long as
they give ear to precepts, to laws, to religion, sweetly touched with
eloquence and persuasion of books, of sermons, of harangues, so long is
society and peace maintained; but if these instruments be silent, or
that sedition and tumult make them not audible, all things dissolve into
anarchy and confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>But this appeareth more manifestly when kings themselves, or
persons of authority under them, or other governors in commonwealths and
popular estates, are endued with learning. For although he might be
thought partial to his own profession that said “Then should people and
estates be happy when either kings were philosophers, or philosophers
kings;” yet so much is verified by experience, that under learned
princes and governors there have been ever the best times: for howsoever
kings may have their imperfections in their passions and customs, yet,
if they be illuminate by learning, they have those notions of religion,
policy, and morality, which do preserve them and refrain them from all
ruinous and peremptory errors and excesses, whispering evermore in their
ears, when counsellors and servants stand mute and silent. And senators
or counsellors, likewise, which be learned, to proceed upon more safe
and substantial principles, than counsellors which are only men of
experience; the one sort keeping dangers afar off, whereas the other
discover them not till they come near hand, and then trust to the
agility of their wit to ward or avoid them.</p></li>
<li><p>Which felicity of times under learned princes (to keep still the
law of brevity, by using the most eminent and selected examples) doth
best appear in the age which passed from the death of Domitianus the
emperor until the reign of Commodus; comprehending a succession of six
princes, all learned, or singular favourers and advancers of learning,
which age for temporal respects was the most happy and flourishing that
ever the Roman Empire (which then was a model of the world) enjoyed — a
matter revealed and prefigured unto Domitian in a dream the night before
he was slain: for he thought there was grown behind upon his shoulders a
neck and a head of gold, which came accordingly to pass in those golden
times which succeeded; of which princes we will make some commemoration;
wherein, although the matter will be vulgar, and may be thought fitter
for a declamation than agreeable to a treatise infolded as this is, yet,
because it is pertinent to the point in hand —</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Neque semper arcum</p>
<p>Tendit Apollo</p>
<p>— and to name them only were too naked and cursory, I will not omit
it altogether. The first was Nerva, the excellent temper of whose
government is by a glance in Cornelius Tacitus touched to the life:
Postquam divus Nerva res oluim insociabiles miscuisset, imperium et
libertatem. And in token of his learning, the last act of his short
reign left to memory was a missive to his adopted son, Trajan,
proceeding upon some inward discontent at the ingratitude of the times,
comprehended in a verse of Homer’s —</p>
<p>“Telis, Phoebe, tuis, lacrymas ulciscere nostras.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Trajan, who succeeded, was for his person not learned; but if we
will hearken to the speech of our Saviour, that saith, “He that
receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall have a prophet’s
reward,” he deserveth to be placed amongst the most learned princes; for
there was not a greater admirer of learning or benefactor of learning, a
founder of famous libraries, a perpetual advancer of learned men to
office, and familiar converser with learned professors and preceptors
who were noted to have then most credit in court. On the other side how
much Trajan’s virtue and government was admired and renowned, surely no
testimony of grave and faithful history doth more lively set forth than
that legend tale of Gregorius Magnum, Bishop of Rome, who was noted for
the extreme envy he bare towards all heathen excellency; and yet he is
reported, out of the love and estimation of Trajan’s moral virtues, to
have made unto God passionate and fervent prayers for the delivery of
his soul out of hell, and to have obtained it, with a caveat that he
should make no more such petitions. In this prince’s time also the
persecutions against the Christians received intermission upon the
certificate of Plinius Secundus, a man of excellent learning and by
Trajan advanced.</p></li>
<li><p>Adrian, his successor, was the most curious man that lived, and
the most universal inquirer: insomuch as it was noted for an error in
his mind that he desired to comprehend all things, and not to reserve
himself for the worthiest things, falling into the like humour that was
long before noted in Philip of Macedon, who, when he would needs
overrule and put down an excellent musician in an argument touching
music, was well answered by him again —”God forbid, sir,” saith he,
“that your fortune should be so bad as to know these things better than
I.” It pleased God likewise to use the curiosity of this emperor as an
inducement to the peace of His Church in those days; for having Christ
in veneration, not as a God or Saviour, but as a wonder or novelty, and
having his picture in his gallery matched with Apollonius (with whom in
his vain imagination he thought its had some conformity), yet it served
the turn to allay the bitter hatred of those times against the Christian
name, so as the Church had peace during his time. And for his government
civil, although he did not attain to that of Trajan’s in glory of arms
or perfection of justice, yet in deserving of the weal of the subject he
did exceed him. For Trajan erected many famous monuments and buildings,
insomuch as Constantine the Great in emulation was wont to call him
Parietaria, “wall-flower,” because his name was upon so many walls; but
his buildings and works were more of glory and triumph than use and
necessity. But Adrian spent his whole reign, which was peaceable, in a
perambulation or survey of the Roman Empire, giving order and making
assignation where he went for re-edifying of cities, towns, and forts
decayed, and for cutting of rivers and streams, and for making bridges
and passages, and for policing of cities and commonalties with new
ordinances and constitutions, and granting new franchises and
incorporations; so that his whole time was a very restoration of all the
lapses and decays of former times.</p></li>
<li><p>Antoninus Pius, who succeeded him, was a prince excellently
learned, and had the patient and subtle wit of a schoolman, insomuch as
in common speech (which leaves no virtue untaxed) he was called Cymini
Sector, a carver or a divider of cummin seed, which is one of the least
seeds. Such a patience he had and settled spirit to enter into the least
and most exact differences of causes, a fruit no doubt of the exceeding
tranquillity and serenity of his mind, which being no ways charged or
encumbered, either with fears, remorses, or scruples, but having been
noted for a man of the purest goodness, without all fiction or
affectation, that hath reigned or lived, made his mind continually
present and entire. He likewise approached a degree nearer unto
Christianity, and became, as Agrippa said unto St. Paul, “half a
Christian,” holding their religion and law in good opinion, and not only
ceasing persecution, but giving way to the advancement of
Christians.</p></li>
<li><p>There succeeded him the first Divi fratres, the two adoptive
brethren — Lucius Commodus Verus, son to AElius Verus, who delighted
much in the softer kind of learning, and was wont to call the poet
Martial his Virgil; and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus: whereof the latter,
who obscured his colleague and survived him long, was named the
“Philosopher,” who, as he excelled all the rest in learning, so he
excelled them likewise in perfection of all royal virtues; insomuch as
Julianus the emperor, in his book entitled Caersares, being as a pasquil
or satire to deride all his predecessors, feigned that they were all
invited to a banquet of the gods, and Silenus the jester sat at the
nether end of the table and bestowed a scoff on everyone as they came
in; but when Marcus Philosophus came in, Silenus was gravelled and out
of countenance, not knowing where to carp at him, save at the last he
gave a glance at his patience towards his wife. And the virtue of this
prince, continued with that of his predecessor, made the name of
Antoninus so sacred in the world, that though it were extremely
dishonoured in Commodus, Caracalla, and Heliogabalus, who all bare the
name, yet, when Alexander Severus refused the name because he was a
stranger to the family, the Senate with one acclamation said, Quomodo
Augustus, sic et Antoninus. In such renown and veneration was the name
of these two princes in those days, that they would have had it as a
perpetual addition in all the emperors’ style. In this emperor’s time
also the Church for the most part was in peace; so as in this sequence
of six princes we do see the blessed effects of learning in sovereignty,
painted forth in the greatest table of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>But for a tablet or picture of smaller volume (not presuming to
speak of your Majesty that liveth), in my judgment the most excellent is
that of Queen Elizabeth, your immediate predecessor in this part of
Britain; a prince that, if Plutarch were now alive to write lives by
parallels, would trouble him, I think, to find for her a parallel
amongst women. This lady was endued with learning in her sex singular,
and rare even amongst masculine princes — whether we speak of learning,
of language, or of science, modern or ancient, divinity or humanity —
and unto the very last year of her life she accustomed to appoint set
hours for reading, scarcely any young student in a university more daily
or more duly. As for her government, I assure myself (I shall not exceed
if I do affirm) that this part of the island never had forty-five years
of better tines, and yet not through the calmness of the season, but
through the wisdom of her regiment. For if there be considered, of the
one side, the truth of religion established, the constant peace and
security, the good administration of justice, the temperate use of the
prerogative, not slackened, nor much strained; the flourishing state of
learning, sortable to so excellent a patroness; the convenient estate of
wealth and means, both of crown and subject; the habit of obedience, and
the moderation of discontents; and there be considered, on the other
side, the differences of religion, the troubles of neighbour countries,
the ambition of Spain, and opposition of Rome, and then that she was
solitary and of herself; these things, I say, considered, as I could not
have chosen an instance so recent and so proper, so I suppose I could
not have chosen one more remarkable or eminent to the purpose now in
hand, which is concerning the conjunction of learning in the prince with
felicity in the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither hath learning an influence and operation only upon civil
merit and moral virtue, and the arts or temperature of peace and
peaceable government; but likewise it hath no less power and efficacy in
enablement towards martial and military virtue and prowess, as may be
notably represented in the examples of Alexander the Great and Caesar
the Dictator (mentioned before, but now in fit place to be resumed), of
whose virtues and acts in war there needs no note or recital, having
been the wonders of time in that kind; but of their affections towards
learning and perfections in learning it is pertinent to say
somewhat.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander was bred and taught under Aristotle, the great
philosopher, who dedicated divers of his books of philosophy unto him;
he was attended with Callisthenes and divers other learned persons, that
followed him in camp, throughout his journeys and conquests. What price
and estimation he had learning in doth notably appear in these three
particulars: first, in the envy he used to express that he bare towards
Achilles, in this, that he had so good a trumpet of his praises as
Homer’s verses; secondly, in the judgment or solution he gave touching
that precious cabinet of Darius, which was found among his jewels
(whereof question was made what thing was worthy to be put into it, and
he gave his opinion for Homer’s works); thirdly, in his letter to
Aristotle, after he had set forth his books of nature, wherein he
expostulateth with him for publishing the secrets or mysteries of
philosophy; and gave him to understand that himself esteemed it more to
excel other men in learning and knowledge than in power and empire. And
what use he had of learning doth appear, or rather shine, in all his
speeches and answers, being full of science and use of science, and that
in all variety.</p></li>
<li><p>And herein again it may seem a thing scholastical, and somewhat
idle to recite things that every man knoweth; but yet, since the
argument I handle leadeth me thereunto, I am glad that men shall
perceive I am as willing to flatter (if they will so call it) an
Alexander, or a Caesar, or an Antoninus, that are dead many hundred
years since, as any that now liveth; for it is the displaying of the
glory of learning in sovereignty that I propound to myself, and not a
humour of declaiming in any man’s praises. Observe, then, the speech he
used of Diogenes, and see if it tend not to the true state of one of the
greatest questions of moral philosophy: whether the enjoying of outward
things, or the contemning of them, be the greatest happiness; for when
he saw Diogenes so perfectly contented with so little, he said to those
that mocked at his condition, “were I not Alexander, I would wish to be
Diogenes.” But Seneca inverteth it, and saith, “Plus erat, quod hic
nollet accipere, quam quod ille posset dare.” There were more things
which Diogenes would have refused than those were which Alexander could
have given or enjoyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Observe, again, that speech which was usual with him — “That he
felt his mortality chiefly in two things, sleep and lust;” and see if it
were not a speech extracted out of the depth of natural philosophy, and
liker to have come out of the mouth of Aristotle or Democritus than from
Alexander.</p></li>
<li><p>See, again, that speech of humanity and poesy, when, upon the
bleeding of his wounds, he called unto him one of his flatterers, that
was wont to ascribe to him divine honour, and said, “Look, this is very
blood; this is not such a liquor as Homer speaketh of, which ran from
Venus’ hand when it was pierced by Diomedes.”</p></li>
<li><p>See likewise his readiness in reprehension of logic in the speech
he used to Cassander, upon a complaint that was made against his father
Antipater; for when Alexander happened to say, “Do you think these men
would have come from so far to complain except they had just cause of
grief?” and Cassander answered, “Yea, that was the matter, because they
thought they should not be disproved;” said Alexander, laughing, “See
the subtleties of Aristotle, to take a matter both ways, pro et contra,
andandandandc.”</p></li>
<li><p>But note, again, how well he could use the same art which he
reprehended to serve his own humour: when bearing a secret grudge to
Callisthenes, because he was against the new ceremony of his adoration,
feasting one night where the same Callisthenes was at the table, it was
moved by some after supper, for entertainment sake, that Callisthenes,
who was an eloquent man, might speak of some theme or purpose at his own
choice; which Callisthenes did, choosing the praise of the Macedonian
nation for his discourse, and performing the same with so good manner as
the hearers were much ravished; whereupon Alexander, nothing pleased,
said, “It was easy to be eloquent upon so good a subject; but,” saith
he, “turn your style, and let us hear what you can say against us;”
which Callisthenes presently undertook, and did with that sting and life
that Alexander interrupted him, and said, “The goodness of the cause
made him eloquent before, and despite made him eloquent then
again.”</p></li>
<li><p>Consider further, for tropes of rhetoric, that excellent use of a
metaphor or translation, wherewith he taxeth Antipater, who was an
imperious and tyrannous governor; for when one of Antipater’s friends
commended him to Alexander for his moderation, that he did not
degenerate as his other lieutenants did into the Persian pride, in uses
of purple, but kept the ancient habit of Macedon, of black. “True,”
saith Alexander; “but Antipater is all purple within.” Or that other,
when Parmenio came to him in the plain of Arbela and showed him the
innumerable multitude of his enemies, specially as they appeared by the
infinite number of lights as it had been a new firmament of stars, and
thereupon advised him to assail them by night; whereupon he answered,
“That he would not steal the victory.”</p></li>
<li><p>For matter of policy, weigh that significant distinction, so much
in all ages embraced, that he made between his two friends Hephaestion
and Craterus, when he said, “That the one loved Alexander, and the other
loved the king:” describing the principal difference of princes’ best
servants, that some in affection love their person, and other in duty
love their crown.</p></li>
<li><p>Weigh also that excellent taxation of an error, ordinary with
counsellors of princes, that they counsel their masters according to the
model of their own mind and fortune, and not of their masters. When upon
Darius’ great offers Parmenio had said, “Surely I would accept these
offers were I as Alexander;” saith Alexander, “So would I were I as
Parmenio.”</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, weigh that quick and acute reply which he made when he
gave so large gifts to his friends and servants, and was asked what he
did reserve for himself, and he answered, “Hope.” Weigh, I say, whether
he had not cast up his account aright, because hope must be the portion
of all that resolve upon great enterprises; for this was Caesar’s
portion when he went first into Gaul, his estate being then utterly
overthrown with largesses. And this was likewise the portion of that
noble prince, howsoever transported with ambition, Henry Duke of Guise,
of whom it was usually said that he was the greatest usurer in France,
because he had turned all his estate into obligations.</p></li>
<li><p>To conclude, therefore, as certain critics are used to say
hyperbolically, “That if all sciences were lost they might be found in
Virgil,” so certainly this may be said truly, there are the prints and
footsteps of learning in those few speeches which are reported of this
prince, the admiration of whom, when I consider him not as Alexander the
Great, but as Aristotle’s scholar, hath carried me too far.</p></li>
<li><p>As for Julius Caesar, the excellency of his learning needeth not
to be argued from his education, or his company, or his speeches; but in
a further degree doth declare itself in his writings and works: whereof
some are extant and permanent, and some unfortunately perished. For
first, we see there is left unto us that excellent history of his own
wars, which he entitled only a Commentary, wherein all succeeding times
have admired the solid weight of matter, and the real passages and
lively images of actions and persons, expressed in the greatest
propriety of words and perspicuity of narration that ever was; which
that it was not the effect of a natural gift, but of learning and
precept, is well witnessed by that work of his entitled De Analogia,
being a grammatical philosophy, wherein he did labour to make this same
Vox ad placitum to become Vox ad licitum, and to reduce custom of speech
to congruity of speech; and took as it were the pictures of words from
the life of reason.</p></li>
<li><p>So we receive from him, as a monument both of his power and
learning, the then reformed computation of the year; well expressing
that he took it to be as great a glory to himself to observe and know
the law of the heavens, as to give law to men upon the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>So likewise in that book of his, Anti-Cato, it may easily appear
that he did aspire as well to victory of wit as victory of war:
undertaking therein a conflict against the greatest champion with the
pen that then lived, Cicero the orator.</p></li>
<li><p>So, again, in his book of Apophthegms, which he collected, we see
that he esteemed it more honour to make himself but a pair of tables, to
take the wise and pithy words of others, than to have every word of his
own to be made an apophthegm or an oracle, as vain princes, by custom of
flattery, pretend to do. And yet if I should enumerate divers of his
speeches, as I did those of Alexander, they are truly such as Solomon
noteth, when he saith, Verba sapientum tanquam aculei, et tanquam clavi
in altum defixi: whereof I will only recite three, not so delectable for
elegancy, but admirable for vigour and efficacy.</p></li>
<li><p>As first, it is reason he be thought a master of words, that
could with one word appease a mutiny in his army, which was thus: The
Romans, when their generals did speak to their army, did use the word
Milites, but when the magistrates spake to the people they did use the
word Quirites. The soldiers were in tumult, and seditiously prayed to be
cashiered; not that they so meant, but by expostulation thereof to draw
Caesar to other conditions; wherein he being resolute not to give way,
after some silence, he began his speech, Ego Quirites, which did admit
them already cashiered — wherewith they were so surprised, crossed, and
confused, as they would not suffer him to go on in his speech, but
relinquished their demands, and made it their suit to be again called by
the name of Milites.</p></li>
<li><p>The second speech was thus: Caesar did extremely affect the name
of king; and some were set on as he passed by in popular acclamation to
salute him king. Whereupon, finding the cry weak and poor, he put it off
thus, in a kind of jest, as if they had mistaken his surname: Non Rex
sum, sed Caesar; a speech that, if it be searched, the life and fulness
of it can scarce be expressed. For, first, it was a refusal of the name,
but yet not serious; again, it did signify an infinite confidence and
magnanimity, as if he presumed Caesar was the greater title, as by his
worthiness it is come to pass till this day. But chiefly it was a speech
of great allurement toward his own purpose, as if the state did strive
with him but for a name, whereof mean families were vested; for Rex was
a surname with the Romans, as well as King is with us.</p></li>
<li><p>The last speech which I will mention was used to Metellus, when
Caesar, after war declared, did possess himself of this city of Rome; at
which time, entering into the inner treasury to take the money there
accumulate, Metellus, being tribune, forbade him. Whereto Caesar said,
“That if he did not desist, he would lay him dead in the place.” And
presently taking himself up, he added, “Young man, it is harder for me
to speak it than to do it — Adolescens, durius est mihi hoc dicere quam
facere.” A speech compounded of the greatest terror and greatest
clemency that could proceed out of the mouth of man.</p></li>
<li><p>But to return and conclude with him, it is evident himself knew
well his own perfection in learning, and took it upon him, as appeared
when upon occasion that some spake what a strange resolution it was in
Lucius Sylla to resign his dictators, he, scoffing at him to his own
advantage, answered, “That Sylla could not skill of letters, and
therefore knew not how to dictate.”</p></li>
<li><p>And here it were fit to leave this point, touching the
concurrence of military virtue and learning (for what example should
come with any grace after those two of Alexander and Caesar?), were it
not in regard of the rareness of circumstance, that I find in one other
particular, as that which did so suddenly pass from extreme scorn to
extreme wonder: and it is of Xenophon the philosopher, who went from
Socrates’ school into Asia in the expedition of Cyrus the younger
against King Artaxerxes. This Xenophon at that time was very young, and
never had seen the wars before, neither had any command in the army, but
only followed the war as a voluntary, for the love and conversation of
Proxenus, his friend. He was present when Falinus came in message from
the great king to the Grecians, after that Cyrus was slain in the field,
and they, a handful of men, left to themselves in the midst of the
king’s territories, cut off from their country by many navigable rivers
and many hundred miles. The message imported that they should deliver up
their arms and submit themselves to the king’s mercy. To which message,
before answer was made, divers of the army conferred familiarly with
Falinus; and amongst the rest Xenophon happened to say, “Why, Falinus,
we have now but these two things left, our arms and our virtue; and if
we yield up our arms, how shall we make use of our virtue?” Whereto
Falinus, smiling on him, said, “If I be not deceived, young gentleman,
you are an Athenian, and I believe you study philosophy, and it is
pretty that you say; but you are much abused if you think your virtue
can withstand the king’s power.” Here was the scorn; the wonder
followed: which was that this young scholar or philosopher, after all
the captains were murdered in parley by treason, conducted those ten
thousand foot, through the heart of all the king’s high countries, from
Babylon to Graecia in safety, in despite of all the king’s forces, to
the astonishment of the world, and the encouragement of the Grecians in
times succeeding to make invasion upon the kings of Persia, as was after
purposed by Jason the Thessalian, attempted by Agesilaus the Spartan,
and achieved by Alexander the Macedonian, all upon the ground of the act
of that young scholar.</p></li>
