<p>And yet since truth will sooner come out from error than from
confusion, I think it expedient that the understanding should have
permission, after the three Tables of First Presentation (such as I have
exhibited) have been made and weighed, to make an essay of the
Interpretation of Nature in the affirmative way, on the strength both of
the instances given in the tables, and of any others it may meet with
elsewhere. Which kind of essay I call the Indulgence of the
Understanding, or the Commencement of Interpretation, or the First
Vintage.</p>
<p>First Vintage Concerning the Form of Heat</p>
<p>It is to be observed that the form of a thing is to be found (as
plainly appears from what has been said) in each and all the instances
in which the thing itself is to be found; otherwise it would not be the
form. It follows therefore that there can be no contradictory instance.
At the same time the form is found much more conspicuous and evident in
some instances than in others, namely in those wherein the nature of the
form is less restrained and obstructed and kept within bounds by other
natures. Instances of this kind I call Shining or Striking Instances.
Let us now therefore proceed to the first vintage concerning the form of
heat.</p>
<p>From a survey of the instances, all and each, the nature of which
heat is a particular case, appears to be motion. This is displayed most
conspicuously in flame, which is always in motion, and in boiling or
simmering liquids, which also are in perpetual motion. It is also shown
in the excitement or increase of heat caused by motion, as in bellows
and blasts; on which see Tab. 3. Inst. 29.; and again in other kinds of
motion, on which see Tab. 3. Inst. 28. and 31. Again it is shown in the
extinction of fire and heat by any strong compression, which checks and
stops the motion; on which see Tab. 3. Inst. 30. and 32. It is shown
also by this, that all bodies are destroyed, or at any rate notably
altered, by all strong and vehement fire and heat; whence it is quite
clear that heat causes a tumult and confusion and violent motion in the
internal parts of a body, which perceptibly tend to its dissolution.</p>
<p>When I say of motion that it is as the genus of which heat is a
species, I would be understood to mean not that heat generates motion or
that motion generates heat (though both are true in certain cases), but
that heat itself, its essence and quiddity, is motion and nothing else;
limited however by the specific differences which I will presently
subjoin, as soon as I have added a few cautions for the sake of avoiding
ambiguity.</p>
<p>Sensible heat is a relative notion, and has relation to man, not to
the universe, and is correctly defined as merely the effect of heat on
the animal spirits. Moreover, in itself it is variable, since the same
body, according as the senses are predisposed, induces a perception of
cold as well as of heat. This is clear from Inst. 41. Tab. 3.</p>
<p>Nor again must the communication of heat, or its transitive nature,
by means of which a body becomes hot when a hot body is applied to it,
be confounded with the form of heat. For heat is one thing, heating
another. Heat is produced by the motion of attrition without any
preceding heat, an instance which excludes heating from the form of
heat. And even when heat is produced by the approach of a hot body, this
does not proceed from the form of heat, but depends entirely on a higher
and more general nature, viz., on the nature of assimilation or
self-multiplication, a subject which requires a separate inquiry.</p>
<p>Again, our notion of fire is popular, and of no use, being made up of
the combination in any body of heat and brightness, as in common flame
and bodies heated to redness.</p>
<p>Having thus removed all ambiguity, I come at length to the true
specific differences which limit motion and constitute it the form of
heat.</p>
<p>The first difference then is this. Heat is an expansive motion
whereby a body strives to dilate and stretch itself to a larger sphere
or dimension than it had previously occupied. This difference is most
observable in flame, where the smoke or thick vapor manifestly dilates
and expands itself into flame.</p>
<p>It is shown also in all boiling liquid which manifestly swells,
rises, and bubbles, and carries on the process of self-expansion till it
turns into a body far more extended and dilated than the liquid itself,
namely, into vapor, smoke, or air.</p>
<p>It appears likewise in all wood and combustibles, from which there
generally arises exudation and always evaporation.</p>
<p>It is shown also in the melting of metals which, being of the
compactest texture, do not readily swell and dilate, but yet their
spirit being dilated in itself, and thereupon conceiving an appetite for
further dilation, forces and agitates the grosser parts into a liquid
state. And if the heat be greatly increased it dissolves and turns much
of their substance to a volatile state.</p>
<p>It is shown also in iron or stones which, though not melted or
dissolved, are yet softened. This is the case also with sticks, which
when slightly heated in hot ashes become flexible.</p>
<p>But this kind of motion is best seen in air, which continuously and
manifestly dilates with a slight heat, as appears in Inst. 38. Tab.
3.</p>
<p>It is shown also in the opposite nature of cold. For cold contracts
all bodies and makes them shrink, insomuch that in intense frosts nails
fall out from walls, brazen vessels crack, and heated glass, on being
suddenly placed in the cold, cracks and breaks. In like manner air is
contracted by a slight chill, as in Inst. 38. Tab. 3. But on these
points I shall speak more at length in the inquiry concerning Cold. Nor
is it surprising that heat and cold should exhibit many actions in
common (for which see Inst. 32. Tab. 2.), when we find two of the
following specific differences (of which I shall speak presently)
suiting nature; though in this specific difference (of which I am now
speaking) their actions are diametrically opposite. For heat gives an
expansive and dilating, cold a contractive and condensing motion.</p>
<p>The second difference is a modification of the former, namely, that
heat is a motion expansive or toward the circumference, but with this
condition, that the body has at the same time a motion upward. For there
is no doubt that there are many mixed motions. For instance, an arrow or
dart turns as it goes forward, and goes forward as it turns. And in like
manner the motion of heat is at once a motion of expansion and a motion
upward. This difference is shown by putting a pair of tongs or a poker
in the fire. If you put it in perpendicularly and hold it by the top, it
soon burns your hand; if at the side or from below, not nearly so
soon.</p>
<p>It is also observable in distillations per descensorium, which men
use for delicate flowers that soon lose their scent. For human industry
has discovered the plan of placing the fire not below but above, that it
may burn the less. For not only flame tends upward, but also all
heat.</p>
<p>But let trial be made of this in the opposite nature of cold, viz.,
whether cold does not contract a body downward as heat dilates a body
upward. Take therefore two iron rods, or two glass tubes, exactly alike;
warm them a little and place a sponge steeped in cold water or snow at
the bottom of the one, and the same at the top of the other. For I think
that the extremities of the rod which has the snow at the top will cool
sooner than the extremities of the other which has the snow at the
bottom; just as the opposite is the case with heat.</p>
<p>The third specific difference is this: that heat is a motion of
expansion, not uniformly of the whole body together, but in the smaller
parts of it; and at the same time checked, repelled, and beaten back, so
that the body acquires a motion alternative, perpetually quivering,
striving and struggling, and irritated by repercussion, whence springs
the fury of fire and heat.</p>
<p>This specific difference is most displayed in flame and boiling
liquids, which are perpetually quivering and swelling in small portions,
and again subsiding.</p>
<p>It is also shown in those bodies which are so compact that when
heated or ignited they do not swell or expand in bulk, as ignited iron,
in which the heat is very sharp.</p>
<p>It is shown also in this, that a fire burns most briskly in the
coldest weather.</p>
<p>Again, it is shown in this, that when the air is extended in a
calendar glass without impediment or repulsion — that is to say,
uniformly and equably — there is no perceptible heat. Also when wind
escapes from confinement, although it burst forth with the greatest
violence, there is no very great heat perceptible; because the motion is
of the whole, without a motion alternating in the particles. And with a
view to this, let trial be made whether flame does not burn more sharply
toward the sides than in the middle of the flame.</p>
<p>It is also shown in this, that all burning acts on minute pores of
the body burnt; so that burning undermines, penetrates, pricks, and
stings the body like the points of an infinite number of needles. It is
also an effect of this, that all strong waters (if suited to the body on
which they are acting) act as fire does, in consequence of their
corroding and pungent nature.</p>
<p>And this specific difference (of which I am now speaking) is common
also to the nature of cold. For in cold the contractive motion is
checked by a resisting tendency to expand, just as in heat the expansive
motion is checked by a resisting tendency to contract. Thus, whether the
particles of a body work inward or outward, the mode of action is the
same though the degree of strength be very different; because we have
not here on the surface of the earth anything that is intensely cold.
See Inst. 27. Tab. [1].</p>
<p>The fourth specific difference is a modification of the last: it is,
that the preceding motion of stimulation or penetration must be somewhat
rapid and not sluggish, and must proceed by particles, minute indeed,
yet not the finest of all, but a degree larger.</p>
<p>This difference is shown by a comparison of the effects of fire with
the effects of time or age. Age or time dries, consumes, undermines and
reduces to ashes, no less than fire; indeed, with an action far more
subtle; but because such motion is very sluggish, and acts on particles
very small, the heat is not perceived.</p>
<p>It is also shown by comparing the dissolution of iron and gold. Gold
is dissolved without any heat being excited, while the dissolution of
iron is accompanied by a violent heat, though it takes place in about
the same time. The reason is that in gold the separating acid enters
gently and works with subtlety, and the parts of the gold yield easily;
whereas in iron the entrance is rough and with conflict, and the parts
of the iron have greater obstinacy.</p>
<p>It is shown also to some degree in some gangrenes and mortifications,
which do not excite great heat or pain on account of the subtle nature
of putrefaction.</p>
<p>Let this then be the First Vintage or Commencement of Interpretation
concerning the form of heat, made by way of indulgence to the
understanding.</p>
<p>Now from this our First Vintage it follows that the form or true
definition of heat (heat, that is, in relation to the universe, not
simply in relation to man) is, in few words, as follows: Heat is a
motion, expansive, restrained, and acting in its strife upon the smaller
particles of bodies. But the expansion is thus modified: while it
expands all ways, it has at the same time an inclination upward. And the
struggle in the particles is modified also; it is not sluggish, but
hurried and with violence.</p>
<p>Viewed with reference to operation it is the same thing. For the
direction is this: If in any natural body you can excite a dilating or
expanding motion, and can so repress this motion and turn it back upon
itself that the dilation shall not proceed equably, but have its way in
one part and be counteracted in another, you will undoubtedly generate
heat; without taking into account whether the body be elementary (as it
is called) or subject to celestial influence; whether it be luminous or
opaque; rare or dense; locally expanded or confined within the bounds of
its first dimension; verging to dissolution or remaining in its original
state; animal, vegetable, or mineral, water, oil or air, or any other
substance whatever susceptible of the above-mentioned motion. Sensible
heat is the same thing; only it must be considered with reference to the
sense. Let us now proceed to further aids.</p>
