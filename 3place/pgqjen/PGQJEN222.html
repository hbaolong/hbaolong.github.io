<h4 id="section">85</h4>
<p>Nor is it only the admiration of antiquity, authority, and consent,
that has forced the industry of man to rest satisfied with the
discoveries already made, but also an admiration for the works
themselves of which the human race has long been in possession. For when
a man looks at the variety and the beauty of the provision which the
mechanical arts have brought together for men’s use, he will certainly
be more inclined to admire the wealth of man than to feel his wants; not
considering that the original observations and operations of nature
(which are the life and moving principle of all that variety) are not
many nor deeply fetched, and that the rest is but patience, and the
subtle and ruled motion of the hand and instruments — as the making of
clocks (for instance) is certainly a subtle and exact work: their wheels
seem to imitate the celestial orbs, and their alternating and orderly
motion, the pulse of animals; and yet all this depends on one or two
axioms of nature.</p>
<p>Again, if you observe the refinement of the liberal arts, or even
that which relates to the mechanical preparation of natural substances,
and take notice of such things as the discovery in astronomy of the
motions of the heavens, of harmony in music, of the letters of the
alphabet (to this day not in use among the Chinese) in grammar; or again
in things mechanical, the discovery of the works of Bacchus and Ceres —
that is, of the arts of preparing wine and beer, and of making bread;
the discovery once more of the delicacies of the table, of distillations
and the like; and if you likewise bear in mind the long periods which it
has taken to bring these things to their present degree of perfection
(for they are all ancient except distillation), and again (as has been
said of clocks) how little they owe to observations and axioms of
nature, and how easily and obviously and as it were by casual suggestion
they may have been discovered; you will easily cease from wondering, and
on the contrary will pity the condition of mankind, seeing that in a
course of so many ages there has been so great a dearth and barrenness
of arts and inventions. And yet these very discoveries which we have
just mentioned are older than philosophy and intellectual arts. So that,
if the truth must be spoken, when the rational and dogmatical sciences
began, the discovery of useful works came to an end.</p>
<p>And again, if a man turn from the workshop to the library, and wonder
at the immense variety of books he sees there, let him but examine and
diligently inspect their matter and contents, and his wonder will
assuredly be turned the other way. For after observing their endless
repetitions, and how men are ever saying and doing what has been said
and done before, he will pass from admiration of the variety to
astonishment at the poverty and scantiness of the subjects which till
now have occupied and possessed the minds of men.</p>
<p>And if again he descend to the consideration of those arts which are
deemed curious rather than safe, and look more closely into the works of
the alchemists or the magicians, he will be in doubt perhaps whether he
ought rather to laugh over them or to weep. For the alchemist nurses
eternal hope and when the thing fails, lays the blame upon some error of
his own; fearing either that he has not sufficiently understood the
words of his art or of his authors (whereupon he turns to tradition and
auricular whispers), or else that in his manipulations he has made some
slip of a scruple in weight or a moment in time (whereupon he repeats
his trials to infinity). And when, meanwhile, among the chances of
experiment he lights upon some conclusions either in aspect new or for
utility not contemptible, he takes these for earnest of what is to come,
and feeds his mind upon them, and magnifies them to the most, and
supplies the rest in hope. Not but that the alchemists have made a good
many discoveries and presented men with useful inventions. But their
case may be well compared to the fable of the old man who bequeathed to
his sons gold buried in a vineyard, pretending not to know the exact
spot; whereupon the sons applied themselves diligently to the digging of
the vineyard, and though no gold was found there, yet the vintage by
that digging was made more plentiful.</p>
<p>Again the students of natural magic, who explain everything by
sympathies and antipathies, have in their idle and most slothful
conjectures ascribed to substances wonderful virtues and operations; and
if ever they have produced works, they have been such as aim rather at
admiration and novelty than at utility and fruit.</p>
<p>In superstitious magic on the other hand (if of this also we must
speak), it is especially to be observed that they are but subjects of a
certain and definite kind wherein the curious and superstitious arts, in
all nations and ages, and religions also, have worked or played. These
therefore we may pass. Meanwhile if is nowise strange if opinion of
plenty has been the cause of want.</p>
