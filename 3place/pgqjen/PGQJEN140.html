<h4 id="chapter-iii.">CHAPTER III.</h4>
<p>BACON AND JAMES I.</p>
<p>Bacon’s life was a double one. There was the life of high thinking,
of disinterested aims, of genuine enthusiasm, of genuine desire to
delight and benefit mankind, by opening new paths to wonder and
knowledge and power. And there was the put on and worldly life, the life
of supposed necessities for the provision of daily bread, the life of
ambition and self-seeking, which he followed, not without interest and
satisfaction, but at bottom because he thought he must — must be a great
man, must be rich, must live in the favour of the great, because without
it his great designs could not be accomplished. His original plan of
life was disclosed in his letter to Lord Burghley: to get some office
with an assured income and not much work, and then to devote the best of
his time to his own subjects. But this, if it was really his plan, was
gradually changed: first, because he could not get such a place; and
next because his connection with Essex, the efforts to gain him the
Attorney’s place, and the use which the Queen made of him after Essex
could do no more for him, drew him more and more into public work, and
specially the career of the law. We know that he would not by preference
have chosen the law, and did not feel that his vocation lay that way;
but it was the only way open to him for mending his fortunes. And so the
two lives went on side by side, the worldly one — he would have said,
the practical one — often interfering with the life of thought and
discovery, and partly obscuring it, but yet always leaving it paramount
in his own mind. His dearest and most cherished ideas, the thoughts with
which he was most at home and happiest, his deepest and truest
ambitions, were those of an enthusiastic and romantic believer in a
great discovery just within his grasp. They were such as the dreams and
visions of his great Franciscan namesake, and of the imaginative seekers
after knowledge in the middle ages, real or mythical, Albert the Great,
Cornelius Agrippa, Dr. Faustus; they were the eager, undoubting hopes of
the physical students in Italy and England in his own time, Giordano
Bruno, Telesio, Campanella, Gilbert, Galileo, or the founders of the
Italian prototype of “Solomon’s House” in the New Atlantis, the
precursor of our Royal Societies, the Academy of the Lincei at Rome.
Among these meditations was his inner life. But however he may have
originally planned his course, and though at times under the influence
of disappointment he threatened to retire to Cambridge or to travel
abroad, he had bound himself fast to public life, and soon ceased to
think of quitting it. And he had a real taste for it — for its shows,
its prizes, for the laws and turns of the game, for its debates and
vicissitudes. He was no mere idealist or recluse to undervalue or
despise the real grandeur of the world. He took the keenest interest in
the nature and ways of mankind; he liked to observe, to generalise in
shrewd and sometimes cynical epigrams. He liked to apply his powerful
and fertile intellect to the practical problems of society and
government, to their curious anomalies, to their paradoxical phenomena;
he liked to address himself, either as an expounder or a reformer, to
the principles and entanglements of English law; he aspired, both as a
lecturer and a legislator, to improve and simplify it. It was not beyond
his hopes to shape a policy, to improve administration, to become
powerful by bringing his sagacity and largeness of thought to the
service of the State, in reconciling conflicting forces, in mediating
between jealous parties and dangerous claims. And he liked to enter into
the humours of a Court; to devote his brilliant imagination and
affluence of invention either to devising a pageant which should throw
all others into the shade, or a compromise which should get great
persons out of some difficulty of temper or pique.</p>
<p>In all these things he was as industrious, as laborious, as calmly
persevering and tenacious, as he was in his pursuit of his philosophical
speculations. He was a compound of the most adventurous and most
diversified ambition, with a placid and patient temper, such as we
commonly associate with moderate desires and the love of retirement and
an easy life. To imagine and dare anything, and never to let go the
object of his pursuit, is one side of him; on the other he is
obsequiously desirous to please and fearful of giving offence, the
humblest and most grateful and also the most importunate of suitors,
ready to bide his time with an even cheerfulness of spirit, which yet it
was not safe to provoke by ill offices and the wish to thwart him. He
never misses a chance of proffering his services; he never lets pass an
opportunity of recommending himself to those who could help him. He is
so bent on natural knowledge that we have a sense of incongruity when we
see him engaging in politics as if he had no other interest. He throws
himself with such zest into the language of the moralist, the
theologian, the historian, that we forget we have before us the author
of a new departure in physical inquiry, and the unwearied compiler of
tables of natural history. When he is a lawyer, he seems only a lawyer.
If he had not been the author of the Instauratio, his life would not
have looked very different from that of any other of the shrewd and
supple lawyers who hung on to the Tudor and Stuart Courts, and who
unscrupulously pushed their way to preferment. He claimed to be, in
spite of the misgivings of Elizabeth and her ministers, as devoted to
public work and as capable of it as any of them. He was ready for
anything, for any amount of business, ready, as in everything, to take
infinite trouble about it. The law, if he did not like it, was yet no
by-work with him; he was as truly ambitious as the men with whom he
maintained so keen and for long so unsuccessful a rivalry. He felt
bitterly the disappointment of seeing men like Coke and Fleming and
Doddridge and Hobart pass before him; he could not, if he had been only
a lawyer, have coveted more eagerly the places, refused to him, which
they got; only, he had besides a whole train of purposes, an inner and
supreme ambition, of which they knew nothing. And with all this there is
no apparent consciousness of these manifold and varied interests. He
never affected to conceal from himself his superiority to other men in
his aims and in the grasp of his intelligence. But there is no trace
that he prided himself on the variety and versatility of these powers,
or that he even distinctly realized to himself that it was anything
remarkable that he should have so many dissimilar objects and be able so
readily to pursue them in such different directions.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether, as long as Elizabeth lived, Bacon could ever
have risen above his position among the “Learned Counsel,” an office
without patent or salary or regular employment. She used, him, and he
was willing to be used; but he plainly did not appear in her eyes to be
the kind of man who would suit her in the more prominent posts of her
Government. Unusual and original ability is apt, till it is generally
recognised, to carry with it suspicion and mistrust as to its being
really all that it seems to be. Perhaps she thought of the possibility
of his flying out unexpectedly at some inconvenient pinch, and
attempting to serve her interests, not in her way, but in his own;
perhaps she distrusted in business and state affairs so brilliant a
discourser, whose heart was known, first and above all, to be set on
great dreams of knowledge; perhaps those interviews with her in which he
describes the counsels which he laid before her, and in which his
shrewdness and foresight are conspicuous, may not have been so welcome
to her as he imagined; perhaps, it is not impossible, that he may have
been too compliant for her capricious taste, and too visibly anxious to
please. Perhaps, too, she could not forget, in spite of what had
happened, that he had been the friend, and not the very generous friend,
of Essex. But, except as to a share of the forfeitures, with which he
was not satisfied, his fortunes did not rise under Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the Queen’s feelings towards him, there is no
doubt that one powerful influence, which lasted into the reign of James,
was steadily adverse to his advancement. Burghley had been strangely
niggardly in what he did to help his brilliant nephew; he was going off
the scene, and probably did not care to trouble himself about a younger
and uncongenial aspirant to service. But his place was taken by his son,
Robert Cecil; and Cecil might naturally have been expected to welcome
the co-operation of one of his own family who was foremost among the
rising men of Cecil’s own generation, and who certainly was most
desirous to do him service. But it is plain that he early made up his
mind to keep Bacon in the background. It is easy to imagine reasons,
though the apparent short-sightedness of the policy may surprise us; but
Cecil was too reticent and self-controlled a man to let his reasons
appear, and his words, in answer to his cousin’s applications for his
assistance, were always kind, encouraging, and vague. But we must judge
by the event, and that makes it clear that Cecil did not care to see
Bacon in high position. Nothing can account for Bacon’s strange failure
for so long a time to reach his due place in the public service but the
secret hostility, whatever may have been the cause, of Cecil.</p>
<p>There was also another difficulty. Coke was the great lawyer of the
day, a man whom the Government could not dispense with, and whom it was
dangerous to offend. And Coke thoroughly disliked Bacon. He thought
lightly of his law, and he despised his refinement and his passion for
knowledge. He cannot but have resented the impertinence, as he must have
thought it, of Bacon having been for a whole year his rival for office.
It is possible that if people then agreed with Mr. Spedding’s opinion as
to the management of Essex’s trial, he may have been irritated by
jealousy; but a couple of months after the trial (April 29, 1601) Bacon
sent to Cecil, with a letter of complaint, the following account of a
scene in Court between Coke and himself:</p>
<p>“A true remembrance of the abuse I received of Mr. Attorney-General
publicly in the Exchequer the first day of term; for the truth whereof I
refer myself to all that were present.</p>
<p>“I moved to have a reseizure of the lands of Geo. Moore, a relapsed
recusant, a fugitive and a practising traytor; and showed better matter
for the Queen against the discharge by plea, which is ever with a salvo
jure. And this I did in as gentle and reasonable terms as might be.</p>
<p>“Mr. Attorney kindled at it, and said, ‘Mr. Bacon, if you have any
tooth against me pluck it out; for it will do you more hurt than all the
teeth in your head will do you good.’ I answered coldly in these very
words: ‘Mr. Attorney, I respect you; I fear you not; and the less you
speak of your own greatness, the more I will think of it.’</p>
<p>“He replied, ‘I think scorn to stand upon terms of greatness towards
you, who are less than little; less than the least;’ and other such
strange light terms he gave me, with that insulting which cannot be
expressed.</p>
<p>“Herewith stirred, yet I said no more but this: ‘Mr. Attorney, do not
depress me so far; for I have been your better, and may be again, when
it please the Queen.’</p>
<p>“With this he spake, neither I nor himself could tell what, as if he
had been born Attorney-General; and in the end bade me not meddle with
the Queen’s business, but with mine own; and that I was unsworn, etc. I
told him, sworn or unsworn was all one to an honest man; and that I ever
set my service first, and myself second; and wished to God that he would
do the like.</p>
<p>“Then he said, it were good to clap a cap. ultegatum upon my back! To
which I only said he could not; and that he was at fault, for he hunted
upon an old scent. He gave me a number of disgraceful words besides,
which I answered with silence, and showing that I was not moved with
them.”</p>
<p>The threat of the capias ultegatum was probably in reference to the
arrest of Bacon for debt in September, 1593. After this we are not
surprised at Bacon writing to Coke, “who take to yourself a liberty to
disgrace and disable my law, my experience, my discretion,” that, “since
I missed the Solicitor’s place (the rather I think by your means) I
cannot expect that you and I shall ever serve as Attorney and Solicitor
together, but either serve with another on your remove, or step into
some other course.” And Coke, no doubt, took care that it should be so.
Cecil, too, may possibly have thought that Bacon gave no proof of his
fitness for affairs in thus bringing before him a squabble in which both
parties lost their tempers.</p>
<p>Bacon was not behind the rest of the world in “the posting of men of
good quality towards the King,” in the rash which followed the Queen’s
death, of those who were eager to proffer their services to James, for
whose peaceful accession Cecil had so skilfully prepared the way. He
wrote to every one who, he thought, could help him: to Cecil, and to
Cecil’s man— “I pray you, as you find time let him know that he is the
personage in the State which I love most;” to Northumberland, “If I may
be of any use to your Lordship, by my head, tongue, pen, means, or
friends, I humbly pray you to hold me your own;” to the King’s Scotch
friends and servants, even to Southampton, the friend of Essex, who had
been shut up in the Tower since his condemnation with Essex, and who was
now released. “This great change,” Bacon assured him, “hath wrought in
me no other change towards your Lordship than this, that I may safely be
now that which I truly was before.” Bacon found in after years that
Southampton was not so easily conciliated. But at present Bacon was
hopeful: “In mine own particular,” he writes, “I have many comforts and
assurances; but in mine own opinion the chief is, that the canvassing
world is gone, and the deserving world is come.” He asks to be
recommended to the King— “I commend myself to your love and to the
well-using of my name, as well in repressing and answering for me, if
there be any biting or nibbling at it in that place, as in impressing a
good conceit and opinion of me, chiefly in the King, as otherwise in
that Court.” His pen had been used under the government of the Queen,
and he had offered a draft of a proclamation to the King’s advisers. But
though he obtained an interview with the King, James’s arrival in
England brought no immediate prospect of improvement in Bacon’s
fortunes. Indeed, his name was at first inadvertently passed over in the
list of Queen’s servants who were to retain their places. The first
thing we hear of is his arrest a second time for debt; and his letters
of thanks to Cecil, who had rendered him assistance, are written in deep
depression.</p>
<p>“For my purpose or course I desire to meddle as little as I can in
the King’s causes, his Majesty now abounding in counsel, and to follow
my private thrift and practice, and to marry with some convenient
advancement. For as for any ambition, I do assure your Honour, mine is
quenched. In the Queen’s, my excellent Mistress’s, time the quorum was
small: her service was a kind of freehold, and it was a more solemn
time. All those points agreed with my nature and judgment. My ambition
now I shall only put upon my pen, whereby I shall be able to maintain
memory and merit of the times succeeding.</p>
<p>“Lastly, for this divulged and almost prostituted title of
knighthood, I could without charge, by your Honour’s mean, be content to
have it, both because of this late disgrace and because I have three new
knights in my mess in Gray’s Inn’s commons; and because I have found out
an alderman’s daughter, an handsome maiden, to my liking.”</p>
<p>Cecil, however, seems to have required that the money should be
repaid by the day; and Bacon only makes a humble request, which, it
might be supposed, could have been easily granted.</p>
<p>“IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP, — In answer of your last letter,
your money shall be ready before your day: principal, interest, and
costs of suit. So the sheriff promised, when I released errors; and a
Jew takes no more. The rest cannot be forgotten, for I cannot forget
your Lordship’s dum memor ipse mei; and if there have been aliquid
nimis, it shall be amended. And, to be plain with your Lordship, that
will quicken me now which slackened me before. Then I thought you might
have had more use of me than now I suppose you are like to have. Not but
I think the impediment will be rather in my mind than in the matter or
times. But to do you service I will come out of my religion at any
time.</p>
<p>“For my knighthood, I wish the manner might be such as might grace
me, since the matter will not; I mean, that I might not be merely
gregarious in a troop. The coronation is at hand. It may please your
Lordship to let me hear from you speedily. So I continue your Lordship’s
ever much bounden,</p>
<p>“FR. BACON.</p>
<p>“From Gorhambury, this 16th of July, 1603.”</p>
<p>But it was not done. He “obtained his title, but not in a manner to
distinguish him. He was knighted at Whitehall two days before the
coronation, but had to share the honour with 300 others.”</p>
<p>It was not quite true that his “ambition was quenched.” For the rest
of Cecil’s life Cecil was the first man at James’s Court; and to the
last there was one thing that Bacon would not appear to believe — he did
not choose to believe that it was Cecil who kept him back from
employment and honour. To the last he persisted in assuming that Cecil
was the person who would help, if he could, a kinsman devoted to his
interests and profoundly conscious of his worth. To the last he
commended his cause to Cecil in terms of unstinted affection and
confiding hope. It is difficult to judge of the sincerity of such
language. The mere customary language of compliment employed by every
one at this time was of a kind which to us sounds intolerable. It seems
as if nothing that ingenuity could devise was too extravagant for an
honest man to use, and for a man who respected himself to accept. It
must not, indeed, be forgotten that conventionalities, as well as
insincerity, differ in their forms in different times; and that
insincerity may lurk behind frank and clear words, when they are the
fashion, as much as in what is like mere fulsome adulation. But words
mean something, in spite of forms and fashions. When a man of great
genius writes his private letters, we wish generally to believe on the
whole what he says; and there are no limits to the esteem, the honour,
the confidence, which Bacon continued to the end to express towards
Cecil. Bacon appeared to trust him — appeared, in spite of continued
disappointments, to rely on his good-will and good offices. But for one
reason or another Bacon still remained in the shade. He was left to
employ his time as he would, and to work his way by himself.</p>
<p>He was not idle. He prepared papers which he meant should come before
the King, on the pressing subjects of the day. The Hampton Court
conference between the Bishops and the Puritan leaders was at hand, and
he drew up a moderating paper on the Pacification of the Church. The
feeling against him for his conduct towards Essex had not died away, and
he addressed to Lord Mountjoy that Apology concerning the Earl of Essex,
so full of interest, so skilfully and forcibly written, so vivid a
picture of the Queen’s ways with her servants, which has every merit
except that of clearing Bacon from the charge of disloyalty to his best
friend. The various questions arising out of the relations of the two
kingdoms, now united under James, were presenting themselves. They were
not of easy solution, and great mischief would follow if they were
solved wrongly. Bacon turned his attention to them. He addressed a
discourse to the King on the union of the two kingdoms, the first of a
series of discussions on the subject which Bacon made peculiarly his
own, and which, no doubt, first drew the King’s attention and favour to
him.</p>
<p>But for the first year of James’s reign he was unnoticed by the King,
and he was able to give his attention more freely to the great thought
and hope of his life. This time of neglect gave him the opportunity of
leisurely calling together and examining the ideas which had long had
hold of his mind about the state of human knowledge, about the
possibilities of extending it, about the hopes and powers which that new
knowledge opened, and about the methods of realising this great
prospect. This, the passion of his life, never asleep even in the
hottest days of business or the most hopeless days of defeat, must have
had full play during these days of suspended public employment. He was a
man who was not easily satisfied with his attempts to arrange the order
and proportions of his plans for mastering that new world of unknown
truth, which he held to be within the grasp of man if he would only dare
to seize it; and he was much given to vary the shape of his work, and to
try experiments in composition and even style. He wrote and rewrote.
Besides what was finally published, there remains a larger quantity of
work which never reached the stage of publication. He repeated over and
over again the same thoughts, the same images and characteristic
sayings. Among these papers is one which sums up his convictions about
the work before him, and the vocation to which he had been called in
respect of it. It is in the form of a “Proem” to a treatise on the
Interpretation of Nature. It was never used in his published works; but,
as Mr. Spedding says, it has a peculiar value as an authentic statement
of what he looked upon as his special business in life. It is this
mission which he states to himself in the following paper. It is drawn
up in “stately Latin.” Mr. Spedding’s translation is no unworthy
representation of the words of the great Prophet of Knowledge:</p>
<p>“Believing that I was born for the service of mankind, and regarding
the care of the Commonwealth as a kind of common property which, like
the air and water, belongs to everybody, I set myself to consider in
what way mankind might be best served, and what service I was myself
best fitted by nature to perform.</p>
<p>“Now among all the benefits that could be conferred upon mankind, I
found none so great as the discovery of new arts, endowments, and
commodities for the bettering of man’s life…. But if a man could
succeed, not in striking out some particular invention, however useful,
but in kindling a light in nature — a light that should in its very
rising touch and illuminate all the border regions that confine upon the
circle of our present knowledge; and so spreading further and further
should presently disclose and bring into sight all that is most hidden
and secret in the world — that man (I thought) would be the benefactor
indeed of the human race — the propagator of man’s empire over the
universe, the champion of liberty, the conqueror and subduer of
necessities.</p>
<p>“For myself, I found that I was fitted for nothing so well as for the
study of Truth; as having a mind nimble and versatile enough to catch
the resemblances of things (which is the chief point), and at the same
time steady enough to fix and distinguish their subtler differences; as
being gifted by nature with desire to seek, patience to doubt, fondness
to meditate, slowness to assert, readiness to reconsider, carefulness to
dispose and set in order; and as being a man that neither affects what
is new nor admires what is old, and that hates every kind of imposture.
So I thought my nature had a kind of familiarity and relationship with
Truth.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, because my birth and education had seasoned me in
business of State; and because opinions (so young as I was) would
sometimes stagger me; and because I thought that a man’s own country has
some special claims upon him more than the rest of the world; and
because I hoped that, if I rose to any place of honour in the State, I
should have a larger command of industry and ability to help me in my
work — for these reasons I both applied myself to acquire the arts of
civil life, and commended my service, so far as in modesty and honesty I
might, to the favour of such friends as had any influence. In which also
I had another motive: for I felt that those things I have spoken of — be
they great or small — reach no further than the condition and culture of
this mortal life; and I was not without hope (the condition of religion
being at that time not very prosperous) that if I came to hold office in
the State, I might get something done too for the good of men’s souls.
When I found, however, that my zeal was mistaken for ambition, and my
life had already readied the turning-point, and my breaking health
reminded me how ill I could afford to be so slow, and I reflected,
moreover, that in leaving undone the good that I could do by myself
alone, and applying myself to that which could not be done without the
help and consent of others, I was by no means discharging the duty that
lay upon me — I put all those thoughts aside, and (in pursuance of my
old determination) betook myself wholly to this work. Nor am I
discouraged from it because I see signs in the times of the decline and
overthrow of that knowledge and erudition which is now in use. Not that
I apprehend any more barbarian invasions (unless possibly the Spanish
empire should recover its strength, and having crushed other nations by
arms should itself sink under its own weight); but the civil wars which
may be expected, I think (judging from certain fashions which have come
in of late), to spread through many countries — together with the
malignity of sects, and those compendious artifices and devices which
have crept into the place of solid erudition — seem to portend for
literature and the sciences a tempest not less fatal, and one against
which the Printing-office will be no effectual security. And no doubt
but that fair-weather learning which is nursed by leisure, blossoms
under reward and praise, which cannot withstand the shock of opinion,
and is liable to be abused by tricks and quackery, will sink under such
impediments as these. Far otherwise is it with that knowledge whose
dignity is maintained by works of utility and power. For the injuries,
therefore, which should proceed from the times, I am not afraid of them;
and for the injuries which proceed from men, I am not concerned. For if
any one charge me with seeking to be wise over-much, I answer simply
that modesty and civil respect are fit for civil matters; in
contemplations nothing is to be respected but Truth. If any one call on
me for works, and that presently, I tell him frankly, without any
imposture at all, that for me — a man not old, of weak health, my hands
full of civil business, entering without guide or light upon an argument
of all others the most obscure — I hold it enough to have constructed
the machine, though I may not succeed in setting it on work…. If, again,
any one ask me, not indeed for actual works, yet for definite premises
and forecasts of the works that are to be, I would have him know that
the knowledge which we now possess will not teach a man even what to
wish. Lastly — though this is a matter of less moment — if any of our
politicians, who used to make their calculations and conjectures
according to persons and precedents, must needs interpose his judgment
in a thing of this nature, I would but remind him how (according to the
ancient fable) the lame man keeping the course won the race of the swift
man who left it; and that there is no thought to be taken about
precedents, for the thing is without precedent.</p>
<p>“For myself, my heart is not set upon any of those things which
depend upon external accidents. I am not hunting for fame: I have no
desire to found a sect, after the fashion of heresiarchs; and to look
for any private gain from such an undertaking as this I count both
ridiculous and base. Enough for me the consciousness of well-deserving,
and those real and effectual results with which Fortune itself cannot
interfere.”</p>
<p>In 1604 James’s first Parliament met, and with it Bacon returned to
an industrious public life, which was not to be interrupted till it
finally came to an end with his strange and irretrievable fall. The
opportunity had come; and Bacon, patient, vigilant, and conscious of
great powers and indefatigable energy, fully aware of all the conditions
of the time, pushed at once to the front in the House of Commons. He
lost no time in showing that he meant to make himself felt. The House of
Commons had no sooner met than it was involved in a contest with the
Chancery, with the Lords, and finally with the King himself, about its
privileges — in this case its exclusive right to judge of the returns of
its members. Bacon’s time was come for showing the King both that he was
willing to do him service, and that he was worth being employed. He took
a leading part in the discussions, and was trusted by the House as their
spokesman and reporter in the various conferences. The King, in his
overweening confidence in his absolute prerogative, had, indeed, got
himself into serious difficulty; for the privilege was one which it was
impossible for the Commons to give up. But Bacon led the House to agree
to an arrangement which saved their rights; and under a cloud of words
of extravagant flattery he put the King in good-humour, and elicited
from him the spontaneous proposal of a compromise which ended a very
dangerous dispute. “The King’s voice,” said Bacon, in his report to the
House, “was the voice of God in man, the good spirit of God in the mouth
of man; I do not say the voice of God and not of man; I am not one of
Herod’s flatterers; a curse fell upon him that said it, a curse on him
that suffered it. We might say, as was said to Solomon, We are glad, O
King, that we give account to you, because you discern what is
spoken.”</p>
<p>The course of this Parliament, in which Bacon was active and
prominent, showed the King, probably for the first time, what Bacon was.
The session was not so stormy as some of the later ones; but occasions
arose which revealed to the King and to the House of Commons the deeply
discordant assumptions and purposes by which each party was influenced,
and which brought out Bacon’s powers of adjusting difficulties and
harmonising claims. He never wavered in his loyalty to his own House,
where it is clear that his authority was great. But there was no limit
to the submission and reverence which he expressed to the King, and,
indeed, to his desire to bring about what the King desired, as far as it
could be safely done. Dealing with the Commons, his policy was “to be
content with the substance and not to stand on the form.” Dealing with
the King, he was forward to recognise all that James wanted recognised
of his kingcraft and his absolute sovereignty. Bacon assailed with a
force and keenness which showed what he could do as an opponent, the
amazing and intolerable grievances arising out of the survival of such
feudal customs as Wardship and Purveyance; customs which made over a
man’s eldest son and property, during a minority, to the keeping of the
King, that is, to a King’s favourite, and allowed the King’s servants to
cut down a man’s timber before the windows of his house. But he urged
that these grievances should be taken away with the utmost tenderness
for the King’s honour and the King’s purse. In the great and troublesome
questions relating to the Union he took care to be fully prepared. He
was equally strong on points of certain and substantial importance,
equally quick to suggest accommodations where nothing substantial was
touched. His attitude was one of friendly and respectful independence.
It was not misunderstood by the King. Bacon, who had hitherto been an
unsworn and unpaid member of the Learned Counsel, now received his
office by patent, with a small salary, and he was charged with the grave
business of preparing the work for the Commissioners for the Union of
the Kingdoms, in which, when the Commission met, he took a foremost and
successful part.</p>
<p>But the Parliament before which their report was to be laid did not
meet till ten months after the work of the Commission was done (Dec.,
1604 — Nov., 1605). For nearly another year Bacon had no public work.
The leisure was used for his own objects. He was interested in history
in a degree only second to his interest in nature; indeed, but for the
engrossing claims of his philosophy of nature, he might have been the
first and one of the greatest of our historians. He addressed a letter
to the Chancellor Ellesmere on the deficiencies of British history, and
on the opportunities which offered for supplying them. He himself could
at present do nothing; “but because there be so many good painters, both
for hand and colours, it needeth but encouragement and instructions to
give life and light unto it.” But he mistook, in this as in other
instances, the way in which such things are done. Men do not accomplish
such things to order, but because their souls compel them, as he himself
was building up his great philosophical structure, in the midst of his
ambition and disappointment. And this interval of quiet enabled him to
bring out his first public appeal on the subject which most filled his
mind. He completed in English the Two Books of the Advancement of
Knowledge, which were published at a book-shop at the gateway of Gray’s
Inn in Holborn (Oct., 1605). He intended that it should be published in
Latin also; but he was dissatisfied with the ornate translation sent him
from Cambridge, and probably he was in a hurry to get the book out. It
was dedicated to the King, not merely by way of compliment, but with the
serious hope that his interest might be awakened in the subjects which
were nearest Bacon’s heart. Like other of Bacon’s hopes, it was
disappointed. The King’s studies and the King’s humours were not of the
kind to make him care for Bacon’s visions of the future, or his eager
desire to begin at once a novel method of investigating the facts and
laws of nature; and the appeal to him fell dead. Bacon sent the book
about to his friends with explanatory letters. To Sir T. Bodley he
writes:</p>
<p>“I think no man may more truly say with the Psalm, Multum incola fuit
anima mea [Ps. 120] than myself. For I do confess since I was of any
understanding, my mind hath in effect been absent from that I have done;
and in absence are many errors which I willingly acknowledge; and among
them, this great one which led the rest: that knowing myself by inward
calling to be fitter to hold a book than to play a part, I have led my
life in civil causes, for which I was not very fit by nature, and more
unfit by the preoccupation of my mind. Therefore, calling myself home, I
have now enjoyed myself; whereof likewise I desire to make the world
partaker.”</p>
<p>To Lord Salisbury, in a note of elaborate compliment, he describes
his purpose by an image which he repeats more than once. “I shall
content myself to awake better spirits, like a bell-ringer, which is
first up to call others to church.” But the two friends whose judgment
he chiefly valued, and who, as on other occasions, were taken into his
most intimate literary confidence, were Bishop Andrewes, his
“inquisitor,” and Toby Matthews, a son of the Archbishop of York, who
had become a Roman Catholic, and lived in Italy, seeing a good deal of
learned men there, apparently the most trusted of all Bacon’s
friends.</p>
<p>When Parliament met again in November, 1605, the Gunpowder Plot and
its consequences filled all minds. Bacon was not employed about it by
Government, and his work in the House was confined to carrying on
matters left unfinished from the previous session. On the rumour of
legal promotions and vacancies Bacon once more applied to Salisbury for
the Solicitorship (March, 1606). But no changes were made, and Bacon was
“still next the door.” In May, 1606, he did what had for some time been
in his thoughts: he married; not the lady whom Essex had tried to win
for him, that Lady Hatton who became the wife of his rival Coke, but one
whom Salisbury helped him to gain, an alderman’s daughter, Alice
Barnham, “an handsome maiden,” with some money and a disagreeable
mother, by her second marriage, Lady Packington. Bacon’s curious love of
pomp amused the gossips of the day. “Sir Francis Bacon,” writes Carleton
to Chamberlain, “was married yesterday to his young wench, in Maribone
Chapel. He was clad from top to toe in purple, and hath made himself and
his wife such store of raiments of cloth of silver and gold that it
draws deep into her portion.” Of his married life we hear next to
nothing: in his Essay on Marriage he is not enthusiastic in its praise;
almost the only thing we know is that in his will, twenty years
afterwards, he showed his dissatisfaction with his wife, who after his
death married again. But it gave him an additional reason, and an
additional plea, for pressing for preferment, and in the summer of 1606
the opening came. Coke was made Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas,
leaving the Attorney’s place vacant. A favourite of Salisbury’s, Hobart,
became Attorney, and Bacon hoped for some arrangement by which the
Solicitor Doddridge might be otherwise provided for, and he himself
become Solicitor. Hopeful as he was, and patient of disappointments, and
of what other men would have thought injustice and faithlessness, he
felt keenly both the disgrace and the inconvenience of so often
expecting place, and being so often passed over. While the question was
pending, he wrote to the King, the Chancellor, and Salisbury. His letter
to the King is a record in his own words of his public services. To the
Chancellor, whom he believed to be his supporter, he represented the
discredit which he suffered — he was a common gaze and a speech;” “the
little reputation which by his industry he gathered, being scattered and
taken away by continual disgraces, every new man coming above me;” and
his wife and his wife’s friends were making him feel it. The letters
show what Bacon thought to be his claims, and how hard he found it to
get them recognised. To the Chancellor he urged, among other things,
that time was slipping by —</p>
<p>“I humbly pray your Lordship to consider that time groweth precious
with me, and that a married man is seven years elder in his thoughts the
first day…. And were it not to satisfy my wife’s friends, and to get
myself out of being a common gaze and a speech, I protest before God I
would never speak word for it. But to conclude, as my honourable Lady
your wife was some mean to make me to change the name of another, so if
it please you to help me to change my own name, I can be but more and
more bounden to you; and I am much deceived if your Lordship find not
the King well inclined, and my Lord of Salisbury forward and
affectionate.”</p>
<p>To Salisbury he writes:</p>
<p>“I may say to your Lordship, in the confidence of your poor kinsman,
and of a man by you advanced, Tu idem fer opem, qui spem dedisti; for I
am sure it was not possible for any living man to have received from
another more significant and comfortable words of hope; your Lordship
being pleased to tell me, during the course of my last service, that you
would raise me; and that when you had resolved to raise a man, you were
more careful of him than himself; and that what you had done for me in
my marriage was a benefit to me, but of no use to your Lordship…. And I
know, and all the world knoweth, that your Lordship is no dealer of holy
water, but noble and real; and on my part I am of a sure ground that I
have committed nothing that may deserve alteration. And therefore my
hope is your Lordship will finish a good work, and consider that time
groweth precious with me, and that I am now vergentibus annis. And
although I know your fortune is not to need an hundred such as I am, yet
I shall be ever ready to give you my best and first fruits, and to
supply (as much as in me lieth) worthiness by thankfulness.”</p>
<p>Still the powers were deaf to his appeals; at any rate he had to be
content with another promise. Considering the ability which he had shown
in Parliament, the wisdom and zeal with which he had supported the
Government, and the important position which he held in the House of
Commons, the neglect of him is unintelligible, except on two
suppositions: that the Government, that is Cecil, were afraid of
anything but the mere routine of law, as represented by such men as
Hobart and Doddridge; or that Coke’s hostility to him was unabated, and
Coke still too important to be offended.</p>
<p>Bacon returned to work when the Parliament met, November, 1606. The
questions arising out of the Union, the question of naturalisation, its
grounds and limits, the position of Scotchmen born before or since the
King’s accession, the Antenati and Postnati, the question of a union of
laws, with its consequences, were discussed with great keenness and much
jealous feeling. On the question of naturalisation Bacon took the
liberal and larger view. The immediate union of laws he opposed as
premature. He was a willing servant of the House, and the House readily
made use of him. He reported the result of conferences, even when his
own opinion was adverse to that of the House. And he reported the
speeches of such persons as Lord Salisbury, probably throwing into them
both form and matter of his own. At length, “silently, on the 25th of
June,” 1607, he was appointed Solicitor-General. He was then
forty-seven.</p>
<p>“It was also probably about this time,” writes Mr. Spedding, “that
Bacon finally settled the plan of his ‘Great Instauration,’ and began to
call it by that name.”</p>
