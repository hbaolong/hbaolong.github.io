<h4 id="of-plantations">Of Plantations</h4>
<p>Plantations are amongst ancient, primitive, and heroical works. When
the world was young, it begat more children; but now it is old, it
begets fewer: for I may justly account new plantations, to be the
children of former kingdoms. I like a plantation in a pure soil; that
is, where people are not displanted, to the end, to plant in others. For
else it is rather an extirpation, than a plantation. Planting of
countries, is like planting of woods; for you must make account to leese
almost twenty years’profit, and expect your recompense in the end. For
the principal thing, that hath been the destruction of most plantations,
hath been the base and hasty drawing of profit, in the first years. It
is true, speedy profit is not to be neglected, as far as may stand with
the good of the plantation, but no further. It is a shameful and
unblessed thing, to take the scum of people, and wicked condemned men,
to be the people with whom you plant; and not only so, but it spoileth
the plantation; for they will ever live like rogues, and not fall to
work, but be lazy, and do mischief, and spend victuals, and be quickly
weary, and then certify over to their country, to the discredit of the
plantation. The people wherewith you plant ought to be gardeners,
ploughmen, laborers, smiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen, fowlers,
with some few apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and bakers. In a country of
plantation, first look about, what kind of victual the country yields of
itself to hand; as chestnuts, walnuts, pineapples, olives, dates, plums,
cherries, wild honey, and the like; and make use of them. Then consider
what victual or esculent things there are, which grow speedily, and
within the year; as parsnips, carrots, turnips, onions, radish,
artichokes of Hierusalem, maize, and the like. For wheat, barley, and
oats, they ask too much labor; but with pease and beans you may begin,
both because they ask less labor, and because they serve for meat, as
well as for bread. And of rice, likewise cometh a great increase, and it
is a kind of meat. Above all, there ought to be brought store of
biscuit, oat-meal, flour, meal, and the like, in the beginning, till
bread may be had. For beasts, or birds, take chiefly such as are least
subject to diseases, and multiply fastest; as swine, goats, cocks, hens,
turkeys, geese, house-doves, and the like. The victual in plantations,
ought to be expended almost as in a besieged town; that is, with certain
allowance. And let the main part of the ground, employed to gardens or
corn, be to a common stock; and to be laid in, and stored up, and then
delivered out in proportion; besides some spots of ground, that any
particular person will manure for his own private. Consider likewise
what commodities, the soil where the plantation is, doth naturally
yield, that they may some way help to defray the charge of the
plantation (so it be not, as was said, to the untimely prejudice of the
main business), as it hath fared with tobacco in Virginia. Wood commonly
aboundeth but too much; and therefore timber is fit to be one. If there
be iron ore, and streams whereupon to set the mills, iron is a brave
commodity where wood aboundeth. Making of bay-salt, if the climate be
proper for it, would be put in experience. Growing silk likewise, if any
be, is a likely commodity. Pitch and tar, where store of firs and pines
are, will not fail. So drugs and sweet woods, where they are, cannot but
yield great profit. Soap-ashes likewise, and other things that may be
thought of. But moil not too much under ground; for the hope of mines is
very uncertain, and useth to make the planters lazy, in other things.
For government, let it be in the hands of one, assisted with some
counsel; and let them have commission to exercise martial laws, with
some limitation. And above all, let men make that profit, of being in
the wilderness, as they have God always, and his service, before their
eyes. Let not the government of the plantation, depend upon too many
counsellors, and undertakers, in the country that planteth, but upon a
temperate number; and let those be rather noblemen and gentlemen, than
merchants; for they look ever to the present gain. Let there be freedom
from custom, till the plantation be of strength; and not only freedom
from custom, but freedom to carry their commodities, where they may make
their best of them, except there be some special cause of caution. Cram
not in people, by sending too fast company after company; but rather
harken how they waste, and send supplies proportionably; but so, as the
number may live well in the plantation, and not by surcharge be in
penury. It hath been a great endangering to the health of some
plantations, that they have built along the sea and rivers, in marish
and unwholesome grounds. Therefore, though you begin there, to avoid
carriage and like discommodities, yet build still rather upwards from
the streams, than along. It concerneth likewise the health of the
plantation, that they have good store of salt with them, that they may
use it in their victuals, when it shall be necessary. If you plant where
savages are, do not only entertain them, with trifles and gingles, but
use them justly and graciously, with sufficient guard nevertheless; and
do not win their favor, by helping them to invade their enemies, but for
their defence it is not amiss; and send oft of them, over to the country
that plants, that they may see a better condition than their own, and
commend it when they return. When the plantation grows to strength, then
it is time to plant with women, as well as with men; that the plantation
may spread into generations, and not be ever pieced from without. It is
the sinfullest thing in the world, to forsake or destitute a plantation
once in forwardness; for besides the dishonor, it is the guiltiness of
blood of many commiserable persons.</p>
