<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the sixteenth place
Instances of the Door or Gate, this being the name I give to instances
which aid the immediate actions of the senses. Now of all the senses it
is manifest that sight has the chief office in giving information. This
is the sense, therefore, for which we must chiefly endeavor to procure
aid. Now the aids to sight are of three kinds: it may be enabled to
perceive objects that are not visible; to perceive them further off; and
to perceive them more exactly and distinctly.</p>
<p>Of the first kind (not to speak of spectacles and the like, which
serve only to correct or relieve the infirmity of a defective vision,
and therefore give no more information) are those recently invented
glasses which disclose the latent and invisible minutiae of bodies and
their hidden configurations and motions by greatly increasing their
apparent size; instruments by the aid of which the exact shape and
outline of body in a flea, a fly, a worm, and also colors and motions
before unseen, are not without astonishment discerned. It is also said
that a straight line drawn with a pen or pencil is seen through such
glasses to be very uneven and crooked, the fact being that neither the
motion of the hand, though aided by a ruler, nor the impression of the
ink or color, is really even, although the unevenness is so minute that
it cannot be detected without such glasses. And here (as is usual in
things new and wonderful) a kind of superstitious observation has been
added, viz., that glasses of this sort do honor to the works of nature
but dishonor to the works of art. The truth however is only this, that
natural textures are far more subtle than artificial. For the
microscope, the instrument I am speaking of, is only available for
minute objects. So that if Democritus had seen one, he would perhaps
have leaped for joy, thinking a way was now discovered of discerning the
atom, which he had declared to be altogether invisible. The incompetency
however of such glasses, except for minutiae alone, and even for them
when existing in a body of considerable size, destroys the use of the
invention. For if it could be extended to larger bodies, or to the
minutiae of larger bodies, so that the texture of a linen cloth could be
seen like network, and thus the latent minutiae and inequalities of
gems, liquors, urine, blood, wounds, etc., could be distinguished, great
advantages might doubtless be derived from the discovery.</p>
<p>Of the second kind are those other glasses discovered by the
memorable efforts of Galileo, by the aid of which, as by boats or
vessels, a nearer intercourse with the heavenly bodies can be opened and
carried on. For these show us that the Milky Way is a group or cluster
of small stars entirely separate and distinct, of which fact there was
but a bare suspicion among the ancients. They seem also to point out
that the spaces of the planetary orbits, as they are called, are not
altogether destitute of other stars, but that the heaven begins to be
marked with stars before we come to the starry sphere itself, although
with stars too small to be seen without these glasses. With this
instrument we can descry those small stars wheeling as in a dance round
the planet Jupiter, whence it may be conjectured that there are several
centers of motion among the stars. With this the inequalities of light
and shade in the moon are more distinctly seen and placed, so that a
sort of selenography can be made. With this we descry spots on the sun,
and similar phenomena — all indeed noble discoveries, so far as we may
safely trust to demonstrations of this kind, which I regard with
suspicion chiefly because the experiment stops with these few
discoveries, and many other things equally worthy of investigation are
not discovered by the same means.</p>
<p>Of the third kind are measuring rods, astrolabes, and the like, which
do not enlarge the sense of sight, but rectify and direct it. And if
there are other instances which aid the remaining senses in their
immediate and individual actions, and yet are of a kind which add
nothing to the information already possessed; they are not to the
present purpose, and therefore I have omitted to mention them.</p>
