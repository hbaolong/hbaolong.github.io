<p>EARLY LIFE.</p>
<p>The life of Francis Bacon is one which it is a pain to write or to
read. It is the life of a man endowed with as rare a combination of
noble gifts as ever was bestowed on a human intellect; the life of one
with whom the whole purpose of living and of every day’s work was to do
great things to enlighten and elevate his race, to enrich it with new
powers, to lay up in store for all ages to come a source of blessings
which should never fail or dry up; it was the life of a man who had high
thoughts of the ends and methods of law and government, and with whom
the general and public good was regarded as the standard by which the
use of public power was to be measured; the life of a man who had
struggled hard and successfully for the material prosperity and opulence
which makes work easy and gives a man room and force for carrying out
his purposes. All his life long his first and never-sleeping passion was
the romantic and splendid ambition after knowledge, for the conquest of
nature and for the service of man; gathering up in himself the spirit
and longings and efforts of all discoverers and inventors of the arts,
as they are symbolised in the mythical Prometheus. He rose to the
highest place and honour; and yet that place and honour were but the
fringe and adornment of all that made him great. It is difficult to
imagine a grander and more magnificent career; and his name ranks among
the few chosen examples of human achievement. And yet it was not only an
unhappy life; it was a poor life. We expect that such an overwhelming
weight of glory should be borne up by a character corresponding to it in
strength and nobleness. But that is not what we find. No one ever had a
greater idea of what he was made for, or was fired with a greater desire
to devote himself to it. He was all this. And yet being all this, seeing
deep into man’s worth, his capacities, his greatness, his weakness, his
sins, he was not true to what he knew. He cringed to such a man as
Buckingham. He sold himself to the corrupt and ignominious Government of
James I. He was willing to be employed to hunt to death a friend like
Essex, guilty, deeply guilty, to the State, but to Bacon the most loving
and generous of benefactors. With his eyes open he gave himself up
without resistance to a system unworthy of him; he would not see what
was evil in it, and chose to call its evil good; and he was its first
and most signal victim.</p>
<p>Bacon has been judged with merciless severity. But he has also been
defended by an advocate whose name alone is almost a guarantee for the
justness of the cause which he takes up, and the innocency of the client
for whom he argues. Mr. Spedding devoted nearly a lifetime, and all the
resources of a fine intellect and an earnest conviction, to make us
revere as well as admire Bacon. But it is vain. It is vain to fight
against the facts of his life: his words, his letters. “Men are made
up,” says a keen observer, “of professions, gifts, and talents; and also
of themselves.”2 With all his greatness, his splendid genius, his
magnificent ideas, his enthusiasm for truth, his passion to be the
benefactor of his kind; with all the charm that made him loved by good
and worthy friends, amiable, courteous, patient, delightful as a
companion, ready to take any trouble — there was in Bacon’s “self” a
deep and fatal flaw. He was a pleaser of men. There was in him that
subtle fault, noted and named both by philosophy and religion in the
ἄρεσκοϛ of Aristotle, the ἀνθρωπάρεσκοϛ of St. Paul, which is more
common than it is pleasant to think, even in good people, but which if
it becomes dominant in a character is ruinous to truth and power. He was
one of the men — there are many of them — who are unable to release
their imagination from the impression of present and immediate power,
face to face with themselves. It seems as if he carried into conduct the
leading rule of his philosophy of nature, parendo vincitur. In both
worlds, moral and physical, he felt himself encompassed by vast forces,
irresistible by direct opposition. Men whom he wanted to bring round to
his purposes were as strange, as refractory, as obstinate, as
impenetrable as the phenomena of the natural world. It was no use
attacking in front, and by a direct trial of strength, people like
Elizabeth or Cecil or James; he might as well think of forcing some
natural power in defiance of natural law. The first word of his teaching
about nature is that she must be won by observation of her tendencies
and demands; the same radical disposition of temper reveals itself in
his dealings with men: they, too, must be won by yielding to them, by
adapting himself to their moods and ends; by spying into the drift of
their humour, by subtly and pliantly falling in with it, by circuitous
and indirect processes, the fruit of vigilance and patient thought. He
thought to direct, while submitting apparently to be directed. But he
mistook his strength. Nature and man are different powers, and under
different laws. He chose to please man, and not to follow what his soul
must have told him was the better way. He wanted, in his dealings with
men, that sincerity on which he insisted so strongly in his dealings
with nature and knowledge. And the ruin of a great life was the
consequence.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon was born in London on the 22d of January, 1560/61,
three years before Galileo. He was born at York House, in the Strand;
the house which, though it belonged to the Archbishops of York, had been
lately tenanted by Lord Keepers and Lord Chancellors, in which Bacon
himself afterwards lived as Lord Chancellor, and which passed after his
fall into the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, who has left his mark in
the Water Gate which is now seen, far from the river, in the garden of
the Thames Embankment. His father was Sir Nicholas Bacon, Elizabeth’s
first Lord Keeper, the fragment of whose effigy in the Crypt of
St. Paul’s is one of the few relics of the old Cathedral before the
fire. His uncle by marriage was that William Cecil who was to be Lord
Burghley. His mother, the sister of Lady Cecil, was one of the daughters
of Sir Antony Cook, a person deep in the confidence of the reforming
party, who had been tutor of Edward VI. She was a remarkable woman,
highly accomplished after the fashion of the ladies of her party, and as
would become her father’s daughter and the austere and laborious family
to which she belonged. She was “exquisitely skilled in the Greek and
Latin tongues;” she was passionately religious, according to the
uncompromising religion which the exiles had brought back with them from
Geneva, Strasburg, and Zurich, and which saw in Calvin’s theology a
solution of all the difficulties, and in his discipline a remedy for all
the evils, of mankind. This means that his boyhood from the first was
passed among the high places of the world — at one of the greatest
crises of English history — in the very centre and focus of its
agitations. He was brought up among the chiefs and leaders of the rising
religion, in the houses of the greatest and most powerful persons of the
State, and naturally, as their child, at times in the Court of the
Queen, who joked with him, and called him “her young Lord Keeper.” It
means also that the religious atmosphere in which he was brought up was
that of the nascent and aggressive Puritanism, which was not satisfied
with the compromises of the Elizabethan Reformation, and which saw in
the moral poverty and incapacity of many of its chiefs a proof against
the great traditional system of the Church which Elizabeth was loath to
part with, and which, in spite of all its present and inevitable
shortcomings, her political sagacity taught her to reverence and
trust.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve he was sent to Cambridge, and put under Whitgift
at Trinity. It is a question which recurs continually to readers about
those times and their precocious boys, what boys were then? For whatever
was the learning of the universities, these boys took their place with
men and consorted with them, sharing such knowledge as men had, and
performing exercises and hearing lectures according to the standard of
men. Grotius at eleven was the pupil and companion of Scaliger and the
learned band of Leyden; at fourteen he was part of the company which
went with the ambassadors of the States-General to Henry IV.; at sixteen
he was called to the bar, he published an out-of-the-way Latin writer,
Martianus Capella, with a learned commentary, and he was the
correspondent of De Thou. When Bacon was hardly sixteen he was admitted
to the Society of “Ancients” of Gray’s Inn, and he went in the household
of Sir Amyas Paulet, the Queen’s Ambassador, to France. He thus spent
two years in France, not in Paris alone, but at Blois, Tours, and
Poitiers. If this was precocious, there is no indication that it was
thought precocious. It only meant that clever and promising boys were
earlier associated with men in important business than is customary now.
The old and the young heads began to work together sooner. Perhaps they
felt that there was less time to spare. In spite of instances of
longevity, life was shorter for the average of busy men, for the
conditions of life were worse.</p>
<p>Two recollections only have been preserved of his early years. One is
that, as he told his chaplain, Dr. Rawley, late in life, he had
discovered, as far back as his Cambridge days, the “unfruitfulness” of
Aristotle’s method. It is easy to make too much of this. It is not
uncommon for undergraduates to criticise their text-books; it was the
fashion with clever men, as, for instance, Montaigne, to talk against
Aristotle without knowing anything about him; it is not uncommon for men
who have worked out a great idea to find traces of it, on precarious
grounds, in their boyish thinking. Still, it is worth noting that Bacon
himself believed that his fundamental quarrel with Aristotle had begun
with the first efforts of thought, and that this is the one recollection
remaining of his early tendency in speculation. The other is more
trustworthy, and exhibits that inventiveness which was characteristic of
his mind. He tells us in the De Augmentis that when he was in France he
occupied himself with devising an improved system of cypher-writing — a
thing of daily and indispensable use for rival statesmen and rival
intriguers. But the investigation, with its call on the calculating and
combining faculties, would also interest him, as an example of the
discovery of new powers by the human mind.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1579 Bacon, at eighteen, was called home by his
father’s death. This was a great blow to his prospects. His father had
not accomplished what he had intended for him, and Francis Bacon was
left with only a younger son’s “narrow portion.” What was worse, he lost
one whose credit would have served him in high places. He entered on
life, not as he might have expected, independent and with court favour
on his side, but with his very livelihood to gain — a competitor at the
bottom of the ladder for patronage and countenance. This great change in
his fortunes told very unfavourably on his happiness, his usefulness,
and, it must be added, on his character. He accepted it, indeed,
manfully, and at once threw himself into the study of the law as the
profession by which he was to live. But the law, though it was the only
path open to him, was not the one which suited his genius, or his object
in life. To the last he worked hard and faithfully, but with doubtful
reputation as to his success, and certainly against the grain. And this
was not the worst. To make up for the loss of that start in life of
which his father’s untimely death had deprived him, he became, for
almost the rest of his life, the most importunate and most untiring of
suitors.</p>
<p>In 1579 or 1580 Bacon took up his abode at Gray’s Inn, which for a
long time was his home. He went through the various steps of his
profession. He began, what he never discontinued, his earnest and humble
appeals to his relative the great Lord Burghley, to employ him in the
Queen’s service, or to put him in some place of independence: through
Lord Burghley’s favour he seems to have been pushed on at his Inn,
where, in 1586, he was a Bencher; and in 1584 he came into Parliament
for Melcombe Regis. He took some small part in Parliament; but the only
record of his speeches is contained in a surly note of Recorder
Fleetwood, who writes as an old member might do of a young one talking
nonsense. He sat again for Liverpool in the year of the Armada (1588),
and his name begins to appear in the proceedings. These early years, we
know, were busy ones. In them Bacon laid the foundation of his
observations and judgments on men and affairs; and in them the great
purpose and work of his life was conceived and shaped. But they are more
obscure years than might have been expected in the case of a man of
Bacon’s genius and family, and of such eager and unconcealed desire to
rise and be at work. No doubt he was often pinched in his means; his
health was weak, and he was delicate and fastidious in his care of it.
Plunged in work, he lived very much as a recluse in his chambers, and
was thought to be reserved, and what those who disliked him called
arrogant. But Bacon was ambitious — ambitious, in the first place, of
the Queen’s notice and favour. He was versatile, brilliant, courtly,
besides being his father’s son; and considering how rapidly bold and
brilliant men were able to push their way and take the Queen’s favour by
storm, it seems strange that Bacon should have remained fixedly in the
shade. Something must have kept him back. Burghley was not the man to
neglect a useful instrument with such good will to serve him. But all
that Mr. Spedding’s industry and profound interest in the subject has
brought together throws but an uncertain light on Bacon’s long
disappointment. Was it the rooted misgiving of a man of affairs like
Burghley at that passionate contempt of all existing knowledge, and that
undoubting confidence in his own power to make men know, as they never
had known, which Bacon was even now professing? Or was it something soft
and over-obsequious in character which made the uncle, who knew well
what men he wanted, disinclined to encourage and employ the nephew? Was
Francis not hard enough, not narrow enough, too full of ideas, too much
alive to the shakiness of current doctrines and arguments on religion
and policy? Was he too open to new impressions, made by objections or
rival views? Or did he show signs of wanting backbone to stand amid
difficulties and threatening prospects? Did Burghley see something in
him of the pliability which he could remember as the serviceable quality
of his own young days — which suited those days of rapid change, but not
days when change was supposed to be over, and when the qualities which
were wanted were those which resist and defy it? The only thing that is
clear is that Burghley, in spite of Bacon’s continual applications,
abstained to the last from advancing his fortunes.</p>
<p>Whether employed by government or not, Bacon began at this time to
prepare those carefully-written papers on the public affairs of the day,
of which he has left a good many. In our day they would have been
pamphlets or magazine articles. In his they were circulated in
manuscript, and only occasionally printed. The first of any importance
is a letter of advice to the Queen, about the year 1585, on the policy
to be followed with a view to keeping in check the Roman Catholic
interest at home and abroad. It is calm, sagacious, and, according to
the fashion of the age, slightly Machiavellian. But the first subject on
which Bacon exhibited his characteristic qualities, his appreciation of
facts, his balance of thought, and his power, when not personally
committed, of standing aloof from the ordinary prejudices and
assumptions of men round him, was the religious condition and prospects
of the English Church. Bacon had been brought up in a Puritan household
of the straitest sect. His mother was an earnest, severe, and intolerant
Calvinist, deep in the interests and cause of her party, bitterly
resenting all attempts to keep in order its pretensions. She was a
masterful woman, claiming to meddle with her brother-in-law’s policy,
and though a most affectionate mother she was a woman of violent and
ungovernable temper. Her letters to her son Antony, whom she loved
passionately, but whom she suspected of keeping dangerous and papistical
company, show us the imperious spirit in which she claimed to interfere
with her sons; and they show also that in Francis she did not find all
the deference which she looked for. Recommending Antony to frequent “the
religious exercises of the sincerer sort,” she warns him not to follow
his brother’s advice or example. Antony was advised to use prayer twice
a day with his servants. “Your brother,” she adds, “is too negligent
therein.” She is anxious about Antony’s health, and warns him not to
fall into his brother’s ill-ordered habits: “I verily think your
brother’s weak stomach to digest hath been much caused and confirmed by
untimely going to bed, and then musing nescio quid when he should sleep,
and then in consequent by late rising and long lying in bed, whereby his
men are made slothful and himself continueth sickly. But my sons haste
not to hearken to their mother’s good counsel in time to prevent.” It
seems clear that Francis Bacon had shown his mother that not only in the
care of his health, but in his judgment on religious matters, he meant
to go his own way. Mr. Spedding thinks that she must have had much
influence on him; it seems more likely that he resented her
interference, and that the hard and narrow arrogance which she read into
the Gospel produced in him a strong reaction. Bacon was obsequious to
the tyranny of power, but he was never inclined to bow to the tyranny of
opinion; and the tyranny of Puritan infallibility was the last thing to
which he was likely to submit. His mother would have wished him to sit
under Cartwright and Travers. The friend of his choice was the Anglican
preacher, Dr. Andrewes, to whom he submitted all his works, and whom he
called his “inquisitor general;” and he was proud to sign himself the
pupil of Whitgift, and to write for him — the archbishop of whom Lady
Bacon wrote to her son Antony, veiling the dangerous sentiment in Greek,
“that he was the ruin of the Church, for he loved his own glory more
than Christ’s.”</p>
<p>Certainly, in the remarkable paper on Controversies in the Church
(1589), Bacon had ceased to feel or to speak as a Puritan. The paper is
an attempt to compose the controversy by pointing out the mistakes in
judgment, in temper, and in method on both sides. It is entirely unlike
what a Puritan would have written: it is too moderate, too tolerant, too
neutral, though like most essays of conciliation it is open to the
rejoinder from both sides — certainly from the Puritan — that it begs
the question by assuming the unimportance of the matters about which
each contended with so much zeal. It is the confirmation, but also the
complement, and in some ways the correction of Hooker’s contemporary
view of the quarrel which was threatening the life of the English
Church, and not even Hooker could be so comprehensive and so fair. For
Hooker had to defend much that was indefensible: he had to defend a
great traditional system, just convulsed by a most tremendous shock — a
shock and alteration, as Bacon says, “the greatest and most dangerous
that can be in a State,” in which old clews and habits and rules were
confused and all but lost; in which a frightful amount of personal
incapacity and worthlessness had, from sheer want of men, risen to the
high places of the Church; and in which force and violence, sometimes of
the most hateful kind, had come to be accepted as ordinary instruments
in the government of souls. Hooker felt too strongly the unfairness, the
folly, the intolerant aggressiveness, the malignity of his opponents —
he was too much alive to the wrongs inflicted by them on his own side,
and to the incredible absurdity of their arguments — to do justice to
what was only too real in the charges and complaints of those opponents.
But Bacon came from the very heart of the Puritan camp. He had seen the
inside of Puritanism — its best as well as its worst side. He witnesses
to the humility, the conscientiousness, the labour, the learning, the
hatred of sin and wrong, of many of its preachers. He had heard, and
heard with sympathy, all that could be urged against the bishops’
administration, and against a system of legal oppression in the name of
the Church. Where religious elements were so confusedly mixed, and where
each side had apparently so much to urge on behalf of its claims, he saw
the deep mistake of loftily ignoring facts, and of want of patience and
forbearance with those who were scandalised at abuses, while the abuses,
in some cases monstrous, were tolerated and turned to profit. Towards
the bishops and their policy, though his language is very respectful,
for the government was implicated, he is very severe. They punish and
restrain, but they do not themselves mend their ways or supply what was
wanting; and theirs are “injuriæ potentiorum”— “injuries come from them
that have the upperhand.” But Hooker himself did not put his finger more
truly and more surely on the real mischief of the Puritan movement: on
the immense outbreak in it of unreasonable party spirit and visible
personal ambition— “these are the true successors of Diotrephes and not
my lord bishops” — on the gradual development of the Puritan theory till
it came at last to claim a supremacy as unquestionable and intolerant as
that of the Papacy; on the servile affectation of the fashions of Geneva
and Strasburg; on the poverty and foolishness of much of the Puritan
teaching — its inability to satisfy the great questions which it raised
in the soul, its unworthy dealing with Scripture— “naked examples,
conceited inferences, and forced allusions, which mine into all
certainty of religion”— “the word, the bread of life, they toss up and
down, they break it not;” on their undervaluing of moral worth, if it
did not speak in their phraseology— “as they censure virtuous men by the
names of civil and moral, so do they censure men truly and godly wise,
who see into the vanity of their assertions, by the name of politiques,
saying that their wisdom is but carnal and savouring of man’s brain.”
Bacon saw that the Puritans were aiming at a tyranny which, if they
established it, would be more comprehensive, more searching, and more
cruel than that of the older systems; but he thought it a remote and
improbable danger, and that they might safely be tolerated for the work
they did in education and preaching, “because the work of exhortation
doth chiefly rest upon these men, and they have a zeal and hate of sin.”
But he ends by warning them lest “that be true which one of their
adversaries said, that they have but two small wants — knowledge and
love.” One complaint that he makes of them is a curious instance of the
changes of feeling, or at least of language, on moral subjects. He
accuses them of “having pronounced generally, and without difference,
all untruths unlawful,” forgetful of the Egyptian midwives, and Rahab,
and Solomon, and even of Him “who, the more to touch the hearts of the
disciples with a holy dalliance, made as though he would have passed
Emmaus.” He is thinking of their failure to apply a principle which was
characteristic of his mode of thought, that even a statement about a
virtue like veracity “hath limit as all things else have;” but it is odd
to find Bacon bringing against the Puritans the converse of the charge
which his age, and Pascal afterwards, brought against the Jesuits. The
essay, besides being a picture of the times as regards religion, is an
example of what was to be Bacon’s characteristic strength and weakness:
his strength in lifting up a subject which had been degraded by mean and
wrangling disputations, into a higher and larger light, and bringing to
bear on it great principles and the results of the best human wisdom and
experience, expressed in weighty and pregnant maxims; his weakness in
forgetting, as, in spite of his philosophy, he so often did, that the
grandest major premises need well-proved and ascertained minors, and
that the enunciation of a principle is not the same thing as the
application of it. Doubtless there is truth in his closing words; but
each party would have made the comment that what he had to prove, and
had not proved, was that by following his counsel they would “love the
whole world better than a part.”</p>
<p>“Let them not fear … the fond calumny of neutrality; but let them
know that is true which is said by a wise man, that neuters in
contentions are either better or worse than either side. These things
have I in all sincerity and simplicity set down touching the
controversies which now trouble the Church of England; and that without
all art and insinuation, and therefore not like to be grateful to either
part. Notwithstanding, I trust what has been said shall find a
correspondence in their minds which are not embarked in partiality, and
which love the whole letter than a part”</p>
<p>Up to this time, though Bacon had showed himself capable of taking a
broad and calm view of questions which it was the fashion among good
men, and men who were in possession of the popular ear, to treat with
narrowness and heat, there was nothing to disclose his deeper thoughts —
nothing foreshadowed the purpose which was to fill his life. He had,
indeed, at the age of twenty-five, written a “youthful” philosophical
essay, to which he gave the pompous title “Temporis Partus Maximus,”
“the Greatest Birth of Time.” But he was thirty-one when we first find
an indication of the great idea and the great projects which were to
make his name famous. This indication is contained in an earnest appeal
to Lord Burghley for some help which should not be illusory. Its words
are distinct and far-reaching, and they are the first words from him
which tell us what was in his heart. The letter has the interest to us
of the first announcement of a promise which, to ordinary minds, must
have appeared visionary and extravagant, but which was so splendidly
fulfilled; the first distant sight of that sea of knowledge which
henceforth was opened to mankind, but on which no man, as he thought,
had yet entered. It contains the famous avowal— “I have taken all
knowledge to be my province” — made in the confidence born of long and
silent meditations and questionings, but made in a simple good faith
which is as far as possible from vain boastfulness.</p>
<p>“MY LORD, — With as much confidence as mine own honest and faithful
devotion unto your service and your honourable correspondence unto me
and my poor estate can breed in a man, do I commend myself unto your
Lordship. I wax now somewhat ancient: one and thirty years is a great
deal of sand in the hour glass. My health, I thank God, I find
confirmed; and I do not fear that action shall impair it, because I
account my ordinary course of study and meditation to be more painful
than most parts of action are. I ever bare a mind (in some middle place
that I could discharge) to serve her Majesty, not as a man born under
Sol, that loveth honour, nor under Jupiter, that loveth business (for
the contemplative planet carrieth me away wholly), but as a man born
under an excellent sovereign that deserveth the dedication of all men’s
abilities. Besides, I do not find in myself so much self-love, but that
the greater parts of my thoughts are to deserve well (if I be able) of
my friends, and namely of your Lordship; who, being the Atlas of this
commonwealth, the honour of my house, and the second founder of my poor
estate, I am tied by all duties, both of a good patriot, and of an
unworthy kinsman, and of an obliged servant, to employ whatsoever I am
to do you service. Again, the meanness of my estate doth somewhat move
me; for though I cannot accuse myself that I am either prodigal or
slothful, yet my health is not to spend, nor my course to get. Lastly, I
confess that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have moderate civil
ends; for I have taken all knowledge to be my province; and if I could
purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof the one with frivolous
disputations, confutations, and verbosities, the other with blind
experiments and auricular traditions and impostures, hath committed so
many spoils, I hope I should bring in industrious observations, grounded
conclusions, and profitable inventions and discoveries: the best state
of that province. This, whether it be curiosity or vain glory, or
nature, or (if one take it favourably) philanthropia, is so fixed in my
mind as it cannot be removed. And I do easily see, that place of any
reasonable countenance doth bring commandment of more wits than of a
man’s own; which is the thing I greatly affect. And for your Lordship,
perhaps you shall not find more strength and less encounter in any
other. And if your Lordship shall find now, or at any time, that I do
seek or affect any place whereunto any that is nearer unto your Lordship
shall be concurrent, say then that I am a most dishonest man. And if
your Lordship will not carry me on, I will not do as Anaxagoras did, who
reduced himself with contemplation unto voluntary poverty, but this I
will do — I will sell the inheritance I have, and purchase some lease of
quick revenue, or some office of gain that shall be executed by deputy,
and so give over all care of service, and become some sorry book-maker,
or a true pioneer in that mine of truth which (he said) lay so deep.
This which I have writ unto your Lordship is rather thoughts than words,
being set down without all art, disguising, or reservation. Wherein I
have done honour both to your Lordship’s wisdom, in judging that that
will be best believed of your Lordship which is truest, and to your
Lordship’s good nature, in retaining nothing from you. And even so I
wish your Lordship all happiness, and to myself means and occasions to
be added to my faithful desire to do you service. From my lodgings at
Gray’s Inn.”</p>
<p>This letter to his unsympathetic and suspicious, but probably not
unfriendly relative, is the key to Bacon’s plan of life; which, with
numberless changes of form, he followed to the end. That is, a
profession, steadily, seriously, and laboriously kept to, in order to
provide the means of living; and beyond that, as the ultimate and real
end of his life, the pursuit, in a way unattempted before, of all
possible human knowledge, and of the methods to improve it and make it
sure and fruitful. And so his life was carried out. On the one hand it
was a continual and pertinacious seeking after government employment,
which could give credit to his name and put money in his pocket —
attempts by general behaviour, by professional services when the
occasion offered, by putting his original and fertile pen at the service
of the government, to win confidence, and to overcome the manifest
indisposition of those in power to think that a man who cherished the
chimera of universal knowledge could be a useful public servant. On the
other hand, all the while, in the crises of his disappointment or
triumph, the one great subject lay next his heart, filling him with fire
and passion — how really to know, and to teach men to know indeed, and
to use their knowledge so as to command nature; the great hope to be the
reformer and restorer of knowledge in a more wonderful sense than the
world had yet seen in the reformation of learning and religion, and in
the spread of civilised order in the great states of the Renaissance
time. To this he gave his best and deepest thoughts; for this he was for
ever accumulating, and for ever rearranging and reshaping those masses
of observation and inquiry and invention and mental criticism which were
to come in as parts of the great design which he had seen in the visions
of his imagination, and of which at last he was only able to leave noble
fragments, incomplete after numberless recastings. This was not indeed
the only, but it was the predominant and governing, interest of his
life. Whether as solicitor for Court favour or public office; whether
drudging at the work of the law or managing State prosecutions; whether
writing an opportune pamphlet against Spain or Father Parsons, or
inventing a “device” for his Inn or for Lord Essex to give amusement to
Queen Elizabeth; whether fulfilling his duties as member of Parliament
or rising step by step to the highest places in the Council Board and
the State; whether in the pride of success or under the amazement of
unexpected and irreparable overthrow, while it seemed as if he was only
measuring his strength against the rival ambitions of the day, in the
same spirit and with the same object as his competitors, the true motive
of all his eagerness and all his labours was not theirs. He wanted to be
powerful, and still more to be rich; but he wanted to be so, because
without power and without money he could not follow what was to him the
only thing worth following on earth — a real knowledge of the amazing
and hitherto almost unknown world in which he had to live. Bacon, to us,
at least, at this distance, who can only judge him from partial and
imperfect knowledge, often seems to fall far short of what a man should
be. He was not one of the high-minded and proud searchers after
knowledge and truth, like Descartes, who were content to accept a frugal
independence so that their time and their thoughts might be their own.
Bacon was a man of the world, and wished to live in and with the world.
He threatened sometimes retirement, but never with any very serious
intention. In the Court was his element, and there were his hopes. Often
there seems little to distinguish him from the ordinary place-hunters,
obsequious and selfish, of every age; little to distinguish him from the
servile and insincere flatterers, of whom he himself complains, who
crowded the antechambers of the great Queen, content to submit with
smiling face and thankful words to the insolence of her waywardness and
temper, in the hope, more often disappointed than not, of hitting her
taste on some lucky occasion, and being rewarded for the accident by a
place of gain or honour. Bacon’s history, as read in his letters, is not
an agreeable one; after every allowance made for the fashions of
language and the necessities of a suitor, there is too much of insincere
profession of disinterestedness, too much of exaggerated profession of
admiration and devoted service, too much of disparagement and
insinuation against others, for a man who respected himself. He
submitted too much to the miserable conditions of rising which he found.
But, nevertheless, it must be said that it was for no mean object, for
no mere private selfishness or vanity, that he endured all this. He
strove hard to be a great man and a rich man. But it was that he might
have his hands free and strong and well furnished to carry forward the
double task of overthrowing ignorance and building up the new and solid
knowledge on which his heart was set — that immense conquest of nature
on behalf of man which he believed to be possible, and of which he
believed himself to have the key.</p>
<p>The letter to Lord Burghley did not help him much. He received the
reversion of a place, the Clerkship of the Council, which did not become
vacant for twenty years. But these years of service declined and place
withheld were busy and useful ones. What he was most intent upon, and
what occupied his deepest and most serious thought, was unknown to the
world round him, and probably not very intelligible to his few intimate
friends, such as his brother Antony and Dr. Andrewes. Meanwhile he
placed his pen at the disposal of the authorities, and though they
regarded him more as a man of study than of practice and experience,
they were glad to make use of it. His versatile genius found another
employment. Besides his affluence in topics, he had the liveliest fancy
and most active imagination. But that he wanted the sense of poetic
fitness and melody, he might almost be supposed, with his reach and play
of thought, to have been capable, as is maintained in some eccentric
modern theories, of writing Shakespeare’s plays. No man ever had a more
imaginative power of illustration drawn from the most remote and most
unlikely analogies; analogies often of the quaintest and most unexpected
kind, but often also not only felicitous in application but profound and
true. His powers were early called upon for some of those sportive
compositions in which that age delighted on occasions of rejoicing or
festival. Three of his contributions to these “devices” have been
preserved — two of them composed in honour of the Queen, as “triumphs,”
offered by Lord Essex, one probably in 1592 and another in 1595; a third
for a Gray’s Inn revel in 1594. The “devices” themselves were of the
common type of the time, extravagant, odd, full of awkward allegory and
absurd flattery, and running to a prolixity which must make modern
lovers of amusement wonder at the patience of those days; but the
“discourses” furnished by Bacon are full of fine observation and
brilliant thought and wit and happy illustration, which, fantastic as
the general conception is, raises them far above the level of such
fugitive trifles.</p>
<p>Among the fragmentary papers belonging to this time which have come
down, not the least curious are those which throw light on his manner of
working. While he was following out the great ideas which were to be the
basis of his philosophy, he was as busy and as painstaking in fashioning
the instruments by which they were to be expressed; and in these papers
we have the records and specimens of this preparation. He was a great
collector of sentences, proverbs, quotations, sayings, illustrations,
anecdotes, and he seems to have read sometimes simply to gather phrases
and apt words. He jots down at random any good and pointed remark which
comes into his thought or his memory; at another time he groups a set of
stock quotations with a special drift, bearing on some subject, such as
the faults of universities or the habits of lawyers. Nothing is too
minute for his notice. He brings together in great profusion mere forms,
varied turns of expression, heads and tails of clauses and paragraphs,
transitions, connections; he notes down fashions of compliment, of
excuse or repartee, even morning and evening salutations; he records
neat and convenient opening and concluding sentences, ways of speaking
more adapted than others to give a special colour or direction to what
the speaker or writer has to say — all that hook-and-eye work which
seems so trivial and passes so unnoticed as a matter of course, and
which yet is often hard to reach, and which makes all the difference
between tameness and liveliness, between clearness and obscurity — all
the difference, not merely to the ease and naturalness, but often to the
logical force of speech. These collections it was his way to sift and
transcribe again and again, adding as well as omitting. From one of
these, belonging to 1594 and the following years, the Promus of
Formularies and Elegancies, Mr. Spedding has given curious extracts; and
the whole collection has been recently edited by Mrs. Henry Pott. Thus
it was that he prepared himself for what, as we read it, or as his
audience heard it, seems the suggestion or recollection of the moment.
Bacon was always much more careful of the value or aptness of a thought
than of its appearing new and original. Of all great writers he least
minds repeating himself, perhaps in the very same words; so that a
simile, an illustration, a quotation pleases him, he returns to it — he
is never tired of it; it obviously gives him satisfaction to introduce
it again and again. These collections of odds and ends illustrate
another point in his literary habits. His was a mind keenly sensitive to
all analogies and affinities, impatient of a strict and rigid logical
groove, but spreading as it were tentacles on all sides in quest of
chance prey, and quickened into a whole system of imagination by the
electric quiver imparted by a single word, at once the key and symbol of
the thinking it had led to. And so he puts down word or phrase, so
enigmatical to us who see it by itself, which to him would wake up a
whole train of ideas, as he remembered the occasion of it — how at a
certain time and place this word set the whole moving, seemed to breathe
new life and shed new light, and has remained the token, meaningless in
itself, which reminds him of so much.</p>
<p>When we come to read his letters, his speeches, his works, we come
continually on the results and proofs of this early labour. Some of the
most memorable and familiar passages of his writings are to be traced
from the storehouses which he filled in these years of preparation. An
example of this correspondence between the note-book and the composition
is to be seen in a paper belonging to this period, written apparently to
form part of a masque, or as he himself calls it, a “Conference of
Pleasure,” and entitled the Praise of Knowledge. It is interesting
because it is the first draught which we have from him of some of the
leading ideas and most characteristic language about the defects and the
improvement of knowledge, which were afterwards embodied in the
Advancement and the Novum Organum. The whole spirit and aim of his great
reform is summed up in the following fine passage:</p>
<p>“Facility to believe, impatience to doubt, temerity to assever, glory
to know, doubt to contradict, end to gain, sloth to search, seeking
things in words, resting in a part of nature — these and the like have
been the things which have forbidden the happy match between the mind of
man and the nature of things, and in place thereof have married it to
vain notions and blind experiments…. Therefore, no doubt, the
sovereignty of man lieth hid in knowledge; wherein many things are
reserved which kings with their treasures cannot buy nor with their
force command; their spials and intelligencers can give no news of them;
their seamen and discoverers cannot sail where they grow. Now we govern
nature in opinions, but we are thrall unto her in necessity; but if we
could be led by her in invention, we should command her in action.”</p>
<p>To the same occasion as the discourse on the Praise of Knowledge
belongs, also, one in Praise of the Queen. As one is an early specimen
of his manner of writing on philosophy, so this is a specimen of what
was equally characteristic of him — his political and historical
writing. It is, in form, necessarily a panegyric, as high-flown and
adulatory as such performances in those days were bound to be. But it is
not only flattery. It fixes with true discrimination on the points in
Elizabeth’s character and reign which were really subjects of admiration
and homage. Thus of her unquailing spirit at the time of the Spanish
invasion —</p>
<p>“Lastly, see a Queen, that when her realm was to have been invaded by
an army, the preparation whereof was like the travail of an elephant,
the provisions infinite, the setting forth whereof was the terror and
wonder of Europe; it was not seen that her cheer, her fashion, her
ordinary manner was anything altered; not a cloud of that storm did
appear in that countenance wherein peace doth ever shine; but with
excellent assurance and advised security she inspired her council,
animated her nobility, redoubled the courage of her people; still having
this noble apprehension, not only that she would communicate her fortune
with them, but that it was she that would protect them, and not they
her; which she testified by no less demonstration than her presence in
camp. Therefore that magnanimity that neither feareth greatness of
alteration, nor the vows of conspirators, nor the power of the enemy, is
more than heroical.”</p>
<p>These papers, though he put his best workmanship into them, as he
invariably did with whatever he touched, were of an ornamental kind. But
he did more serious work. In the year 1592 a pamphlet had been published
on the Continent in Latin and English, Responsio ad Edictum Reginæ
Angliæ, with reference to the severe legislation which followed on the
Armada, making such charges against the Queen and the Government as it
was natural for the Roman Catholic party to make, and making them with
the utmost virulence and unscrupulousness. It was supposed to be written
by the ablest of the Roman pamphleteers, Father Parsons. The Government
felt it to be a dangerous indictment, and Bacon was chosen to write the
answer to it. He had additional interest in the matter, for the pamphlet
made a special and bitter attack on Burghley, as the person mainly
responsible for the Queen’s policy. Bacon’s reply is long and elaborate,
taking up every charge, and reviewing from his own point of view the
whole course of the struggle between the Queen and the supporters of the
Roman Catholic interest abroad and at home. It cannot be considered an
impartial review; besides that it was written to order, no man in
England could then write impartially in that quarrel; but it is not more
one-sided and uncandid than the pamphlet which it answers, and Bacon is
able to recriminate with effect, and to show gross credulity and
looseness of assertion on the part of the Roman Catholic advocate. But
religion had too much to do with the politics of both sides for either
to be able to come into the dispute with clean hands: the Roman
Catholics meant much more than toleration, and the sanguinary
punishments of the English law against priests and Jesuits were edged by
something even keener than the fear of treason. But the paper contains
some large surveys of public affairs, which probably no one at that time
could write but Bacon. Bacon never liked to waste anything good which he
had written; and much of what he had written in the panegyric in Praise
of the Queen is made use of again, and transferred with little change to
the pages of the Observations on a Libel.</p>
