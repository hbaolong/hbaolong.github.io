<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>The rule or axiom for the transformation of bodies is of two kinds.
The first regards a body as a troop or collection of simple natures. In
gold, for example, the following properties meet. It is yellow in color,
heavy up to a certain weight, malleable or ductile to a certain degree
of extension; it is not volatile and loses none of its substance by the
action of fire; it turns into a liquid with a certain degree of
fluidity; it is separated and dissolved by particular means; and so on
for the other natures which meet in gold. This kind of axiom, therefore,
deduces the thing from the forms of simple natures. For he who knows the
forms of yellow, weight, ductility, fixity, fluidity, solution, and so
on, and the methods for superinducing them and their gradations and
modes, will make it his care to have them joined together in some body,
whence may follow the transformation of that body into gold. And this
kind of operation pertains to the first kind of action. For the
principle of generating some one simple nature is the same as that of
generating many; only that a man is more fettered and tied down in
operation, if more are required, by reason of the difficulty of
combining into one so many natures which do not readily meet, except in
the beaten and ordinary paths of nature. It must be said, however, that
this mode of operation (which looks to simple natures though in a
compound body) proceeds from what in nature is constant and eternal and
universal, and opens broad roads to human power, such as (in the present
state of things) human thought can scarcely comprehend or
anticipate.</p>
<p>The second kind of axiom, which is concerned with the discovery of
the latent process, proceeds not by simple natures, but by compound
bodies, as they are found in nature in its ordinary course. As, for
instance, when inquiry is made from what beginnings, and by what method
and by what process, gold or any other metal or stone is generated, from
its first menstrua and rudiments up to the perfect mineral; or in like
manner, by what process herbs are generated, from the first concretion
of juices in the ground or from seeds up to the formed plant, with all
the successive motions and diverse and continued efforts of nature. So
also in the inquiry concerning the process of development in the
generation of animals, from coition to birth; and in like manner of
other bodies.</p>
<p>It is not however only to the generations of bodies that this
investigation extends, but also to other motions and operations of
nature. As, for instance, when inquiry is made concerning the whole
course and continued action of nutrition, from the first reception of
the food to its complete assimilation; or again, concerning the
voluntary motion of animals from the first impression on the imagination
and the continued efforts of the spirit up to the bendings and movements
of the limbs; or concerning the motion of the tongue and lips and other
instruments, and the changes through which it passes till it comes to
the utterance of articulate sounds. For these inquiries also relate to
natures concrete or combined into one structure, and have regard to what
may be called particular and special habits of nature, not to her
fundamental and universal laws which constitute forms. And yet it must
be confessed that this plan appears to be readier and to lie nearer at
hand and to give more ground for hope than the primary one.</p>
<p>In like manner the operative which answers to this speculative part,
starting from the ordinary incidents of nature, extends its operation to
things immediately adjoining, or at least not far removed. But as for
any profound and radical operations on nature, they depend entirely on
the primary axioms. And in those things too where man has no means of
operating, but only of knowing, as in the heavenly bodies (for these he
cannot operate upon or change or transform), the investigation of the
fact itself or truth of the thing, no less than the knowledge of the
causes and consents, must come from those primary and catholic axioms
concerning simple natures, such as the nature of spontaneous rotation,
of attraction or magnetism, and of many others which are of a more
general form than the heavenly bodies themselves. For let no one hope to
decide the question whether it is the earth or heaven that really
revolves in the diurnal motion until he has first comprehended the
nature of spontaneous rotation.</p>
