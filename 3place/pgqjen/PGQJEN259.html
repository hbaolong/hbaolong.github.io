<h4 id="section">122</h4>
<p>It may be thought also a strange and a harsh thing that we should at
once and with one blow set aside all sciences and all authors; and that,
too, without calling in any of the ancients to our aid and support, but
relying on our own strength.</p>
<p>And I know that if I had chosen to deal less sincerely, I might
easily have found authority for my suggestions by referring them either
to the old times before the Greeks (when natural science was perhaps
more flourishing, though it made less noise, not having yet passed into
the pipes and trumpets of the Greeks), or even, in part at least, to
some of the Greeks themselves; and so gained for them both support and
honor, as men of no family devise for themselves by the good help of
genealogies the nobility of a descent from some ancient stock. But for
my part, relying on the evidence and truth of things, I reject all forms
of fiction and imposture; nor do I think that it matters any more to the
business in hand whether the discoveries that shall now be made were
long ago known to the ancients, and have their settings and their
risings according to the vicissitude of things and course of ages, than
it matters to mankind whether the new world be that island of Atlantis
with which the ancients were acquainted, or now discovered for the first
time. For new discoveries must be sought from the light of nature, not
fetched back out of the darkness of antiquity.</p>
<p>And as for the universality of the censure, certainly if the matter
be truly considered such a censure is not only more probable but more
modest, too, than a partial one would be. For if the errors had not been
rooted in primary notions, there must have been some true discoveries to
correct the false. But the errors being fundamental, and not so much of
false judgment as of inattention and oversight, it is no wonder that men
have not obtained what they have not tried for, nor reached a mark which
they never set up, nor finished a course which they never entered on or
kept.</p>
<p>And as for the presumption implied in it, certainly if a man
undertakes by steadiness of hand and power of eye to describe a
straighter line or more perfect circle than anyone else, he challenges a
comparison of abilities; but if he only says that he with the help of a
rule or a pair of compasses can draw a straighter line or a more perfect
circle than anyone else can by eye and hand alone, he makes no great
boast. And this remark, be it observed, applies not merely to this first
and inceptive attempt of mine, but to all that shall take the work in
hand hereafter. For my way of discovering sciences goes far to level
men’s wit and leaves but little to individual excellence, because it
performs everything by the surest rules and demonstrations. And
therefore I attribute my part in all this, as I have often said, rather
to good luck than to ability, and account it a birth of time rather than
of wit. For certainly chance has something to do with men’s thoughts, as
well as with their works and deeds.</p>
