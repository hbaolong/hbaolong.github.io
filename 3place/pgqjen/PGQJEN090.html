<h4 id="i.-century.">I. Century.</h4>
<p>DIGG a Pitt vpon the Sea shore, somewhat aboue the High-water Marke,
and sincke it as deepe as the Low-Water marke; And as the Tide commeth
in, it will fill with Water, Fresh and Potable. This is commonly
practized vpon the Coast of Barbary, where other fresh Water is wanting.
And CAESAR knew this well, when he was besieged in Alexandria: For by
Digging of Pitts in the Sea shoare, hee did frustrate the Laborious
Workes of the Enemies, which had turned the Sea-Water vpon the Wells of
Alexandria; And so saued his Army, being then in Desperation. But Caesar
mistooke the Cause, For he thought that all Sea-Sandes had Naturall
Springs of Fresh Water. But it is plaine, that it is the Sea-Water;
because the Pitt filleth according to the Measure of the Tide: And the
Sea-water passing or Strayning through the Sandes, leaueth the
Saltnesse.</p>
<p>I remember to haue Read, that Triall hath beene made of Salt Water
passed through Earth; through Tenn Vessells, one within an other, and
yet it hath not lost his Saltnesse, as to become potable: But the same
Man saith, that (by the Relation of Another,) Salt Water drained through
twenty Vessells, hath become Fresh. This Experiment seemeth to crosse
that other of Pitts, made by the Sea side; And yet but in part, if it be
true, that twentie Repetitions doe the Effect. But it is worth the Note,
how poore the Imitations of Nature are, in Common course of Experiments,
except they be led by great Iudgement, and some good Light of Axiomes.
For first, ther is no small difference betweene a Passage of Water
through twenty small Vessells; And through such a distance, as betweene
the Low water, and High water Marke. Secondly, there is a great
difference betweene Earth and Sand. For all Earth hath in it a kinde of
Nitrous Salt, from which Sand is more free: And besides Earth doth not
straine the Water so finely, as Sand doth. But ther is a Third Point,
that I suspect as much, or more, then the other Two: And that is, that
in the Experiment of Transmission of the Sea-water into the Pitts, the
Water riseth; But in the Experiment of Transmission of the Water through
the Vessells, it falleth: Now certaine it is, that the Salter Part of
Water, (once Salted throughout) goeth to the Bottome. And therfore no
meruaile, if the Draining of Water by descent, doth not make it fresh:
Besides, I doe somewhat doubt, that the very Dashing of the Water, that
commeth from the Sea, is more proper to strike of the Salt part, then
wher the Water slideth of her owne Motion.</p>
<p>It seemeth Percolation or Transmission, (which is commonly called
Straining,) is a good kinde of Separation; Not onely of Thicke from
Thin, and Grosse from Fine,; But of more subtile Natures; And varieth
according to the Bodie through which the Transmission is made. As if
through a wollen Bagg, the Liquour leaueth the Fatnesse; If through
Sand, the Saltnesse; andandandandc. They speake of Seuering Wine from
Water, passing it through Iuy wood, or through other the like porous
Body; But Non Constat.</p>
<p>The Gumm of Trees (which wee see to be commonly shining and cleare)
is but a fine Passage or Straining of the Iuice of the Tree, through the
Wood and Bark. And in like manner, Cornish Diamonds, and Rock Rubies,
(which are yet more resplendent then Gumms) are the fine Exudations of
Stone.</p>
<p>Aristotle giueth the Cause, vainely, why the Feathers of Birdes are
of more liuely Colours, then the Haires of Beastes; for no Beast hath
any fine Azure, or Carnation, or Greene Haire. He saith, It is, because
Birds are more in the Beames of the Sunn, then Beasts; But that is
manifestly vntrue; For Cattle are more in the Sun then Birds, that liue
commonly in the Woods, or in some Couert. The true Cause is, that the
Excrementious Moisture of liuing Creatures, which maketh as well the
Feathers in Birds, as the Haire in Beasts, passeth in Birds through a
finer and more delicate Strainer, then it doth in Beastes: For Feathers
passe through Quills; And Haire through Skin.</p>
<p>The Clarifying of Liquors by Adhesion is an Inward Percolation; And
is effected, when some Cleauing Body is Mixed and Agitated with the
Liquours; wherby the grosser Part of the Liquor sticks to that Cleauing
Body; And so the finer Parts are freed from the Grosser. So the
Apothecaries clarify their Sirrupes by whites of Eggs, beaten with the
Iuices which they would clarify; which Whites of Eggs, gather all the
Dreggs and grosser Parts of the Iuyce to them; And after the Sirrupe
being sett on the Fire, the whites of Egges themselues harden, and are
taken forth. So Ippocrasse is clarified by mixing with Milke; And
stirring it about; And then passing it through a Wollen Bagge, which
they call Hippocrates Sleeue: And the Cleauing Nature of the Milke
draweth the Powder of the Spices, and Grosser parts of the Liquour to
it; And in the passage they stick vpon the Woollen Bagge.</p>
<p>The Clarifying of Water, is an Experiment tending to Health; besides
the pleasure of the Eye, when Water is Crystaline. It is effected by
casting in and placing Pebbles, at the Head of a Current; that the Water
may straine through them.</p>
<p>It may be, Percolation doth not onely cause Clearenesse and
Splendour, but Sweetnes of Sauour; For that also followeth, as well as
Clearenes, when the Finer Parts are seuered from the Grosser. So it is
found, that the Sweates of Men that haue much Heat, and exercise much,
and haue cleane Bodies, and fine Skins, doe smell sweet; As was said of
Alexander; And we see, commonly, that Gumms haue sweet Odours.</p>
<p>TAke a Glasse, and put Water into it, and wett your Finger, and draw
it round about the Lipp of the Glasse, pressing it somewhat hard; And
after you haue drawne it some few times about; it will make the Water
friske and sprinckle vp, in a fine Dew. This Instance doth excellently
Demonstrate the Force of Compression in a Solid Body. For whensoeuer a
Solid Body (as Wood, Stone, Mettall, andandandandc.) is pressed, ther is
an inward Tumult in the parts therof; seeking to deliuer themselues from
the Compression: And this is the Cause of all Violent Motion. Wherin it
is strange in the highest Degree, that this Motion hath neuer been
obserued, nor inquired; It being of all Motions, the most Common, and
the Chiefe Roote of all Mechanicall Operations. This Motion worketh in
round at first, by way of Proofe, and Search, which way to deliuer it
selfe; And then worketh in Progresse, wher it findeth the Deliuerance
easiest. In Liquours this Motion is visible: For all Liquours strucken
make round Circles, and withall Dash; but in Solids, (which breake not,)
it is so subtile, as it is inuisible; But neuertheless bewrayeth it
selfe by many Effects; As in this Instance wherof we speake. For the
Pressure of the Finger furthered by the wetting (because it sticketh so
much the better vnto the Lipp of the Glasse,) after some continuance,
putteth all the small Parts of the Glasse, into worke; that they strike
the Water sharpely; from which Percussion that Sprinkling commeth.</p>
<p>If you strike or pierce a Solid Body, that is brittle, as Glasse, or
Sugar, it breaketh not onely, wher the immediate force is; but breaketh
all about into shiuers and fitters; The Motion, vpon the Pressure,
searching all wayes; and breaking where it findeth the Body weakest.</p>
<p>The Powder in Shot, being Dilated into such a Flame, as endureth not
Compression; Moueth likewise in round, (The Flame being in the Nature of
a liquid Body:) Sometimes recoyling; Sometimes breaking the Piece; But
generally discharging the Bullett, because ther it findeth easiest
Deliuerance.</p>
<p>This Motion vpon Pressure, and the Reciprocall therof, which is
Motion vpon Tensure; we vse to call (by one common Name) Motion of
Libertie; which is, when any Body, being forced to a Preter-Naturall
Extent, or Dimension, deliuereth and restoreth it selfe to the Naturall:
As when a Blowne Bladder (Pressed) riseth againe; or when Leather or
Cloath tentured spring backe. These two Motions (of which ther be
infinite Instances,) we shall handle in due place.</p>
<p>This Motion vpon Pressure is excellently also demonstrated in Sounds;
As when one Chimeth vpon a Bell, it soundeth; But as soon as he layeth
his hand vpon it, the Sound ceaseth: And so, the Sound of a Virginall
String, as soone as the Quill of the Iack falleth vpon it, stoppeth. For
these Sounds are produced, by the subtile Percussion of the Minute
parts, of the Bell, or String, vpon the Aire; All one, as the Water is
caused to leape by the subtile Percussion of the Minute parts of the
Glasse, vpon the Water, wherof we spake a little before in the 9th.
Experiment. For you must not take it to be, the locall Shaking of the
Bell, or String, that doth it. As we shall fully declare, when we come
hereafter to handle Sounds.</p>
<p>TAke a Glasse with a Belly and a long Nebb; fill the Belly (in part)
with Water: Take also another Glasse, whereinto put Claret Wine and
Water mingled; Reverse the first Glasse, with the Belly vpwards,
Stopping the Nebb with your fingar; Then dipp the Mouth of it within the
Second Glasse, and remoue your Fingar: Continue it in that posture for a
time; And it will vnmingle the VVine from the Water: The VVine ascending
and setling in the topp of the vpper Glasse; And the VVater descending
and setling in the bottome of the lower Glasse. The passage is apparent
to the Eye; For you shall see the VVine, as it were, in a small veine,
rising through the VVater. For handsomnesse sake (because the Working
requireth some small time) it were good you hang the vpper Glasse vpon a
Naile. But as soone as ther is gathered so much pure and vnmixed water
in the Bottome of the Lower Glasse, as that the Mouth of the vpper
Glasse dippeth into it, the Motion ceaseth</p>
<p>Let the Vpper Glasse be VVine, and the Lower VVater; ther followeth
no Motion at all. Lett the Vpper Glasse be VVater pure, the Lowwer
VVater coloured; or contrariwise; ther followeth no Motion at all. But
it hath been tried, that though the Mixture of VVine and VVater, in the
Lower Glasse, be three parts VVater, and but one VVine; yet it doth not
dead the Motion. This Separation of VVater and VVine appeareth to be
made by Weight; for it must be of Bodies of vnequall Weight, or ells it
worketh not; And the Heauier Body must euer be in the vpper Glasse. But
then note withall, that the VVater being made pensile, and ther being a
great VVeight of VVater in the Belly of the Glasse, sustained by a small
Pillar of VVater in the Neck of the Glasse; It is that, which sesteth
the Motion on worke: For VVater and VVine in one Glasse, with long
standing, will hardly seuer.</p>
<p>This Experiment would be Extended from Mixtures of seuerall Liquors,
to Simple Bodies, which Consist of seuerall Similare Parts: Try it
therfore with Broyne or Salt water, and Fresh water; Placing the Salt
water (which is the heauier) in the vpper Glasse; And see whether the
Fresh will come aboue. Try it also with VVater thick Sugred, and Pure
water; and see whether the water which commeth aboue, will loose his
Sweetnes: For which purpose it were good ther were a little Cock made in
the Belly of the vpper Glasse.</p>
<p>IN Bodies containing Fine Spirits, which doe easely dissipate, when
you make Infusions, the Rule is; A short Stay of the Body in the Liquour
receyueth the Spiritt; And a longer Stay confoundeth it; because it
draweth forth the Earthy Part withall; which embaseth the finer. And
therfore it is an Errour in Phisicians, to rest simply vpon the Length
of stay, for encreasing the vertue. But if you will haue the Infusion
strong, in those kinde of Bodies, which haue fine Spiritts, your way is,
not to giue Longer time, but to repeat the Infusion of the Body oftner.
Take Violetts, and infuse a good Pugill of them in a Quart of Vineger;
Lett them stay three quarters of an houre, and take them forth; And
refresh the Infusion with like quantity of new Violetts, seuen times;
And it will make a Vineger so fresh of the Flower, as if a Twelue-moneth
after, it be brought you in a Saucer, you shall smell it before it come
at you. Note, that it smelleth more perfectly of the Flower, a good
while after, then at first.</p>
<p>This Rule, which wee haue giuen, is of singular vse, for the
Preparations of Medecines, and other Infusions. As for Example; the
Leafe of Burrage hath an Excellent Spiritt, to represse the fuliginous
Vapour of Dusky Melancholy, and so to cure Madnes: But neuerthelesse, if
the Leafe be infused long, it yieldeth forth but a raw substance, of no
Vertue; Therfore I suppose, that if in the Must of Wine, or Wort of
Beere, while it worketh, before it be Tunned, the Burrage stay a small
time, and be often changed with fresh; It will make a Soueraigne Drink
for Melancholy Passions. And the like I conceyue of Orenge Flowers.</p>
<p>Rubarb hath manifestly in it Parts of contrary Operations: Parts that
purge; And parts that binde the body: And the first lay looser, and the
latter lay deeper: So that if you infuse Rubarb for an houre, and crush
it well, it will purge better, and binde the Body lesse after the
purging, then if it stood twenty foure houres; This is tried: But I
conceiue likewise, that by Repeating the Infusion of Rubarb, seuerall
times, (as was said of Violetts,) letting each stay in but a small time;
you may make it as strong a Purging Medecine, as Scammony. And it is not
a small thing wonn in Phisick, if you can make Rubarb, and other
Medecines that are Benedict, as strong Purgers, as those that are not
without some Malignity.</p>
<p>Purging Medecines, for the most part, haue their Purgatine Vertue, in
a fine Spirit; As appeareth by that they indure not boiling, without
much losse of vertue. And therfore it is of good vse in Phisick, if you
can retaine the Purging Vertue, and take away the Vnpleasant tast of the
Purger; which it is like you may doe, by this Course of Infusing oft,
with little stay. For it is probable, that the Horrible and Odious Tast,
is in the Grosser part.</p>
<p>Generally, the working by Infusions, is grosse and blinde, except you
first try the Issuing of the seuerall Parts of the Body, which of them
Issue more speedily, and which more slowly; And so by apportioning the
time, can take and leaue that Quality, which you desire. This to know,
ther be two waies; The one to try what long stay, and what short stay
worketh, as hath been said: The other to try in Order, the succeding
Infusions, of one and the same Body, successiuely, in seuerall Liquors.
As for example; Take Orenge-Pills, or Rose-Mary, or Cinnamon, or what
you will; And let them Infuse halfe an houre in VVater: Then take them
out, and Infuse them againe in other VVater; And so the third time: And
then tast and consider the First water, the Second, and the Third: And
you will find them differing, not only in Strength and Weaknes, but
otherwise in Tast, or Odour; For it may bee the First water will haue
more of the Sent, as more Fragrant; And the Second more of the Tast, as
more bitter or Biting, andandandandc.</p>
<p>Infusions in Aire, (for so we may well call Odours) haue the same
diuersities with Infusions in VVater; In that the seuerall Odours (which
are in one Flower, or other Body) issue at seuerall times; Some earlier,
some later: So we finde that Violetts, Woodbines, Strawberries, yield a
pleasing Sent, that commeth forth first; But soone after an ill Sent,
quite differing from the Former; Which is caused, not so much by
Mellowing, as by the late Issuing of the Grosser Spirit.</p>
<p>As we may desire to extract the finest Spirits in some Cases; So we
may desire also to discharge them (as hurtfull) in some other. So VVine
burnt, by reason of the Evaporating of the finer Spirit, enslameth
lesse, and is best in Agues: Opium leeseth some of his poisonous
Quallity, if it be vapoured out, mingled with Spirit of Wine, or the
like: Sean leeseth somewhat of his windines by Decocting; And
(generally) subtile or windy Spirits are taken off by Incension, or
Evaporation. And euen in Infusions in things that are of too high a
Spirit, you were better poure off the first Infusion, after a small
time, and vse the latter.</p>
<p>BVbbles are in the forme of a Hemisphere; Aire within, and a little
Skin of VVater without: And it seemeth somewhat strange, that the Aire
should rise so swiftly, while it is in the VVater; And when it commeth
to the topp, should be staid by so weake a Couer as that of the Bubble
is. But as for the swift Ascent of the Aire, while is vnder the VVater,
that is a Motion of Percussion from the VVater; which it selfe
descending, driueth vpp the Aire; and no Motion of Leuity in the Aire.
And this Democritus called Motus Plaga. In this Common Experiment, the
Cause of the Enclosure of the Bubble is, for that the Appetite to resist
Separation, or Discontinuance, (which in solide Bodies is strong) is
also in Liquours, though fainter and weaker; As wee see in this of the
Bubble: we see it also in little Glasses of Spittle that children make
of Rushes; And in Castles of Bubbles, which they make by blowing into
water, hauing obtained a little Degree of Tenacity by Mixture of Soape:
Wee see it also in the Stillicides of water, which if ther be water
enough to follow, will Drawe themselues into a small thredd, because
they will not discontinue; But if ther be no Remedy, then they cast
themselues into round Dropps; which is the Figure, that saueth the Body
most from Discontinuance: The same Reason is of the Roundnes of the
Bubble, as well for the Skin of water, as for the Aire within: For the
Aire likewise auoideth Discontinuance; And therfore casteth it self into
a Round Figure. And for the stopp and Arrest of the Aire a little while,
it sheweth that the Aire of it selfe hath little, or no Appetite, of
Ascending.</p>
<p>THE Reiection, which I continually vse, of Experiments, (though it
appeareth not) is infinit; But yet if an Experiment be probable in the
Worke, and of great Vse, I receyue it, but deliuer it as doubtfull. It
was reported by a Sober Man, that an Artificiall Spring may be made
thus: Finde out a hanging Ground, wher ther is a good quick Fall of
Raine-water. Lay a Half-Trough of Stone, of a good length, 3. or 4.
foote deep within the same Ground; with one end vpon the high Ground,
the other vpon the lowe. Couer the Trough with Brakes a good thicknes,
and cast Sand vpon the Topp of the Brakes: You shall see, (saith he)
that after some showers are past, the lower End of the Trough will runn
like a Spring of water: which is no maruaile, if it hold, while the
Raine-water lasteth; But he said it would continue long time after the
Raine is past: As if the water did multiply it self vpon the Aire, by
the helpe of the Coldnesse and Condensation of the Earth, and the
Consort of the first Water.</p>
<p>THE French, (which put off the Name of the French Disease; vnto the
Name of the Disease of Naples,) doe report, that at the Siege of Naples,
ther were certaine wicked Merchants, that Barrelled vpp Mans flesh, (of
some that had been, lately slaine in Barbary) and sold it for Tunny; And
that vpon that foule and high Nourishment, was the Originall of that
Disease. Which may well be; For that it is certaine, that the Caniballs
in the West Indies, eate Mans flesh; And the West Indies were full of
the Pockes when they were first discouered: And at this day the
Mortallest poisons, practised by the West Indians, haue some Mixture of
the Bloud, or Fatt, or Flesh of Man: And diuers Witches, and
Sorceresles, aswell amongst the Heathen, as amongst the Christians, haue
fedd vpon Mans flesh, to aid (as it seemeth) their Imagination, with
High and foule Vapours.</p>
<p>IT seemeth that ther be these waies (in likelihood) of Version of
Vapours, or Aire, into Water and Moisture. The first is Cold; which doth
manifestly Condense; As wee see in the Contracting of the Aire in the
Weather-Glasse; whereby it is a Degree nearer to water. Wee see it also
in the Generation of Springs, which the Ancients thought (very probably)
to be made by the Version of Aire into water, holpen by the Rest, which
the Aire hath in those Parts; wherby it cannot dissipate. And by the
Coldnes of Rockes; for ther Springs are chiefly generated. Wee see it
also in the Effects of the Cold of the Middle Region (as they call it)
of the Aire; which produceth Dews, and Raines. And the Experiment of
Turning water into Ice, by Snow, Nitre, and Salt, (wherof wee shall
speake hereafter,) would be transferred to the Turning of Aire into
Water. The Second way is by Compression; As in Stillatories, wher the
Vapour is turned back, vpon it self, by the Encounter of the Sides of
the Stillatory; And in the Dew vpon the Couers of Boyling Potts; And in
the Dew towards Raine, vpon Marble, and Wainscott. But this is like to
doe no great effect; Except it be vpon Vapours, and grosse Aire, that
are allready very neare in Degree to Water. The Third is that, which may
be searched into, but doth not yet appeare; which is, by Mingling of
moist Vapours with Aire; And trying if they will not bring a Returne of
more Water, then the water was at first: For if so; That Increase is a
version of the Aire: Therfore putt water into the Bottome of a
Stillatory, with the Nebb stopped; Weigh the Water first; Hang in the
Middle of the Stillatory a large Spunge; And see what Quantitie of Water
you can crush out of it; And what it is more, or lesse, compared with
the water spent; For you must vnderstand, that if any Version can be
wrought, it will be easeliest done in small Pores: And that is the
Reason why wee prescribe a Spunge. The Fourth way is Probable also,
though not Appearing; Which is, by Receiuing the Aire into the small
Pores of Bodies; For (as hath been said) euery thing in small Quantity
is more easy for version; And Tangible Bodies haue no pleasure in the
Consort of Aire, but endeauour to subact it into a more Dense Body: But
in Entire Bodies it is checked; because if the Aire should Condense,
ther is nothing to succeed: Therfore it must be in loose Bodies, as
Sand, and Powder; which wee see, if they lye close, of themselues gather
Moisture.</p>
<p>IT is reported by some of the Ancients; That Whelps, or other
Creatures, if they be put Young, into such a Cage, or Boxe, as they
cannot rise to their Stature, but may encrease in Breadth, or length;
will growe accordingly, as they can gett Roome: which if it be true, and
faisible, and that the young Creature so pressed, and straightened, doth
not therupon die; It is a Meanes to produce Dwarfe Creatures, and in a
very Strange Figure. This is certaine, and noted long since; That the
Pressure or Forming of Parts of Creatures, when they are very young,
doth alter the Shape not a little; As the Stroaking of the Heads of
Infants, between the Hands, was noted of Old, to make Macrocephali;
which shape of the Head, at that time, was esteemed. And the Raising
gently of the Bridge of the Nose, doth preuent the Deformity of a Saddle
Nose. Which obseruation well weighed, may teach a Meanes, to make the
Persons of Men, and Women, in many kindes, more comely, and better
featured, then otherwise they would be; By the Forming and Shaping of
them in their Infancy: As by Stroaking vp the Calues of the Leggs, to
keepe them from falling downe too lowe; And by Stroaking vp the Forehead
to keepe them from being lowforeheaded. And it is a common Practise to
swath Infants, that they may growe more straight, and better shaped: And
wee see Young Women, by wearing straight Bodies, keepe themselues from
being Grosse, and Corpulent.</p>
<p>ONions, as they hang, will many of them shoot forth; And so will
Penniroiall; And so will an Herb called Orpin; with which they vse, in
the Country, to trimme their Houses, binding it to a Lath, or Stick, and
setting it against a wall. We see it like wise, more especially, in the
greater Semper-vine, which will put out Branches, two or three yeares:
But it is true, that commonly they wrapp the Root in a Cloth besmeared
with Oyle, and renue it once in halfe a Yeare. The like is reported by
some of the Ancients, of the Stalks of Lillies. The Cause is; For that
these Plants haue a Strong, Dense, and Succulent Moisture, which is not
apt to exhale; And so is able, from the old store, without drawing helpe
from the Earth, to suffice the sprouting of the Plant: And this
Sprouting is chiefly in the late Spring, or early Sommer; which are the
Times of Putting forth. We see also, that Stumps of Trtes, lying out of
the ground, will put forth Sprouts for a Time. But it is a Noble Triall,
and of very great Consequence, to try whether these things, in the
Sprouting, doe increase Weight; which must be tried, by weighing them
before they be hangd vp; And afterwards againe, when they are sprouted.
For if they encrease not in Weight; Then it is no more but this; That
what they send forth in the Sprout, they leese in some other Part: But
if they gather Weight, then it is Magnale Naturae; For it sheweth that
Aire may be made so to be Condensed, as to be conuerted into a Dense
Body; wheras the Race and Period of all things, here aboue the Earth, is
to extenuate and turne things to be more Penumaticall, and Rare; And not
to be Retrograde, from Pneumaticall to that which is Dense. It sheweth
also, that Aire can Nourish; which is another great Matter of
Consequence. Note, that to try this, the Experiment of the Semper-viue
must be made without Oiling the Cloth; For els, it may be, the Plant
receiueth Nourishment from the Oile.</p>
<p>FLame and Aire doe not Mingle, except it be in an Instant; Or in the
vitall Spiritts of vegetables, and liuing Creatures. In Gunpowder, the
Force of it hath been ascribed, to Rarefaction of the Earthy Substance
into Flame; And thus farr it is true: And then (forfooth) it is become
another Element; the Forme wherof occupieth more place; And so, of
Necessity, followeth a Dilatation: And therfore, lest two Bodies should
be in one place, ther must needes also follow an Expulsion of the
pellet; Or Blowing vp of the Mine. But these are Crude and Ignorant
Speculations. For Flame, if ther were nothing els, except it were in
very great quantity, will be suffocate with any hard Body, such as a
Pellet is, Or the Barrell of a Gunn; So as the Flame would not expell
the hard Body; But the hard Body would kill the Flame, and not suffer it
to kindle, or spread. But the Cause of this so potent a Motion, is the
Nitre, (which wee call otherwise Salt-Petre;) which hauing in it
anotable Crude and windy Spirit, first by the Heate of the Fire
suddainly dilateth it self; (And wee knowe that simple Aire, being
preternaturally attenuated by Heate, will make it self Roome, and breake
and blowe vp that which resisteth it;) And Secondly, when the Nitre hath
Dilated it self, it bloweth abroad the Flame, as an Inward Bellowes. And
therfore wee see that Brimstone, Pitch, Camphire, Wilde-Fire, and diuers
other Inflammable Matters, though they burne cruelly, and are hard to
quench; Yet they make no such fiery winde, as Gunpowder doth: And on the
other side, wee see that Quick Siluer, (which is a most Crude and Watry
Body) heated, and pent in, hath the like force with Gunpowder. As for
liuing Creatures, it is certaine, their Vitall Spiritts are a Substance
Compounded of an Airy and Flamy Matter; And though Aire and Flame being
free, will not well mingle; yet bound in by a Body that hath some
fixing, they will. For that you may best see in those two Bodies, (which
are their Aliments,) water, and Oyle; For they likewise will not well
mingle of themselues, but in the Bodies of Plants, and liuing Creatures,
they will. It is no maruaile therfore, that a small Quantity of
Spiritts, in the Cells of the Braine, and Canales of the Sinewes, are
able to moue the whole Body, (which is of so great Masse,) both with so
great Force, as in Wrestling, Leaping; And with so great Swiftnes, As in
playing Diuision vpon the Lute. Such is the force of these two Natures,
Aire and Flame, when they incorporate.</p>
<p>TAke a small waxe Candle, and putt it in a Socket, of Brasse, or
Iron; Then sett it vpright in a Porringer full of Spirits of Wine,
heated: Then sett both the Candle, and Spiritt of Wine, on fire, and you
shall see the Flame of the Candle, open it self, and become 4. or 5.
times bigger then otherwise it would haue been; and appeare in Figure
Globular and not in Piramis. You shall see also, that the Inward Flame
of the Candle keepeth Colour, and doth not waxe any whitt blewe towardes
the Colour of the Outward flame of the Spiritt of Wine. This is a Noble
Instance; where in two things are most remarkable; The one; that one
Flame within another quencheth not; but is a fixed Body, and continueth
as Aire, or Water doe. And therefore Flame would still ascend vpwards in
one greatnesse, if it were not quenched on the Sides: And the greater
the Flame is at the Bottome, the higher is the Rise. The other, that
Flame doth not mingle with Flame, as Aire doth with Aire, or Water with
Water, but only remaineth contiguous; As it commeth to passe betwixt
Consisting Bodies. It appeareth also, that the forme of a Piramis in
Flame, which we vsually see, is meerely by Accident, and that the Aire
about, by quenching the Sides of the Flame, crusheth it, and extenuateth
it into that Forme; For of it selfe it would be Round: And therefore
Smoake is in the Figure of a Piramis Reuersed; For the Aire quencheth
the Flame, and receiueth the Smoake. Note also, that the Flame of the
Condle, within the Flame of the Spirit of Wine, is troubled; And doth
not onely open and moue vpwards, but moueth wauing, and to and fro: As
if Flame of his owne Nature (if it were not quenched,) would rowle and
turne, as well as moue vpwards. By all which, it should seeme, that the
Caelestiall Bodies, (most of them,) are true Fires or Flames, as the
Stoicks held; More fine (perhaps) and Rarified, than our Flame is. For
they are all Globular, and Determinate,; They haue Rotation; And they
haue the Colour and Splendour of Flame: So that Flame aboue is Durable,
and Consistent, and in his Naturall place; But with vs, it is a
Stranger, and Momentany, and Impure; Like Vulcan that haked with his
Fall.</p>
<p>Take an Arrow, and hold it in Flame, for the space of ten pulses; And
when it commeth forth, you shall finde those Parts of the Arrow, which
were on the Outsides of the Flame, more burned, blacked, and turned
almost into a Coale; whereas that in the Middest of the Flame, will be,
as if the Fire had scarce touched it. This is an Instance of great
consequence for the discouery of the Nature of Flame; And sheweth
manifestly, that Flame burneth more violently towards the Sides, than in
the Middest: And, which is more, that Heat or Fire is not violent or
furious, but where it is checked, and pont. And therfore the
Peripatetickes (howsoeuer their opinion of an Element of Fire aboue the
Aire is iustly exploded;) in that Point they acquit themselues well: For
being opposed, that if there were a Spbeare of Fire, that incompassed
the Earth so neare hand, it were impossible but all things should be
burnt vp; They answer, that the pure Elementall Fire, in his owne place,
and not irritate, is but of a Moderate Heat.</p>
<p>It is affirmed constantly by many, as an vsuall Experiment; That a
Lampe of Vre, in the Bottome of a Mine, will be tumbled, and stirred, by
two Mens strength; which if you bring it to the Topp of the Earth, will
aske Six Mens strength at the least to stirre it. It is a Noble
Instance, and is fit to be tried to the full: For it is very probable,
that the Motion of Grauitie worketh weakly, both farre from the Earth,
and also within the Earth: The former, because the Appetite of Vnion of
Dense Bodies with the Earth, in respect of the distance, is more dull;
The latter, because the Body hath in part attained his Nature, when it
is some Depth in the Earth. For as for the Mouing to a Point or Place
(which was the Opinion of the Ancients) it is a meere Vanity.</p>
<p>It is strange, how the Ancients tooke vp Experiments vpon credit, and
yet did build great Matters vpon them. The Obseruation of some of the
best of them, deliuered confidently, is That a Vessell filled with
Ashes, will receiue the like quantity of Water, that it would haue done,
if it had been empty. But this is vtterly vntrue; for the Water will not
goe in by a Fifth part. And I suppose, that that Fifth part is the
difference of the lying close, or open, of the Ashes; As we see that
Ashes alone, if they be hard pressed, will lye in lesse roome: And so
the Ashes with Aire betweene, lye looser; and with Water, closer. For I
haue not yet found certainly, that the Water, it selfe, by mixture of
Ashes, or Dust, will shrinke or draw into lesse Roome.</p>
<p>It is reported of credit, that if you lay good store of Kernells of
Grapes, about the Root of a Vine; it will make the Vine come earlier,
and prosper better. It may be tried with other Kernells, laid about the
Root of a Plant of the same kinde; As Figgs, Kernells of Apples,
andandandandc. The Cause may be, for that the Kernells draw out of the
Earth Iuice fit to nourish the Tree, as those that would be Trees of
themselues, though there were no Root; But the Root being of greater
strength, robbeth and deuoureth the Nourishment, when they haue drawne
it: As great Fishes deuoure little.</p>
<p>The Operation of Purging Medicines, and the Causes thereof, haue
béene thought to be a great Secret; And so according to the slothfull
manner of Men, it is referred to a Hidden Propriety, a Specificall
vertue, and a Fourth Qualitie, and the like Shifts of Ignorance. The
Causes of Purging are diuers; All plaine and perspicuous; And throughly
maintained by Experience. The first is, That whatsoeuer cannot be
ouercome and disgested by the Stomacke, is by the Stomacke, either put
vp by Vomit, or put downe to the Guts; And by that Motion of Expulsion
in the Stomacke, and Guts, other Parts of the Body, (as the Orifices of
the Veines, and the like) are moued to expell by Consent. For nothing is
more frequent than Motion of Consent in the Body of Man. This Surcharge
of the Stomacke, is caused either by the Qualitie of the Medicine, or by
the Quantitie. The Qualities are three: Extreme Bitter, as in Aloes,
Coloquintida, andandandandc. Loathsome and of horrible taste; As in
Agarick, Black Hellebore, andandandandc. And of secret Malignity, and
disagreement towards Mans Bodie, many times not appearing much in the
Taste; As in Scammony, Mechoacham, Antimony, andandandandc. And note
well, that if there be any Medicine, that Purgeth, and hath neither of
the first two Manifest Qualities; it is to be held suspected, as a kinde
of Poysons; For that it worketh either by Corrosion; or by a secret
Malignitie and Enmitie to Nature: And therfore such Medicines are warily
to be prepared, and vsed. The Quantitie of that which is taken, doth
also cause Parging; As we see in a great Quantitie of New Milke from the
Cow; yea and a great Quantitie of Meat; For Surfets many times turne to
Purges, both vpwards, and downwards. Therefore we see generally, that
the working of Purging Medicines, commeth two or three houres after the
Medicines taken; For that the Stomacke first maketh a proofe, whether it
can concoct them. And the like happeneth after Surfets; or Milke in too
great Quantitie.</p>
<p>A second Cause is Mordication of the Orifices of the Parts;
Especially of the Mesentery veines; As it is seene, that Salt, or any
such thing that is sharpe and biting, put into the Fundament, doth
prouoke the Part to expell; And Mustard prouoketh Sneezing: And any
Sharpe Thing to the Eyes, prouoketh Teares. And therfore we see that
almost all Purgers haue a kinde of Twiching and vellication, besides the
Griping which commeth of wind. And if this Mordication be in an
ouer-high Degree, it is little better than the Corrosion of Poyson; And
it commeth to passe sometimes in Antimony; Especially if it be giuen, to
Bodies not repleat with Humors; For where Humors abound, the Humors saue
the Parts.</p>
<p>The third Cause is Attraction: For I doe not deny, but that Purging
Medicines haue in them a direct Force of Attraction; As Drawing Plasters
haue in Surgery: And we see Sage, or Bettony brused, Sneezing-powder,
and other Powders or Liquors (which the Physitians call Errhines,) put
into the Nose, draw Flegme, and water from the Head; And so it is in
Apophlegmatismes, and Gargarismes, that draw the Rheume downe by the
Pallate. And by this Vertue, no doubt, some Purgers draw more one
Humour, and some another, according to the Opinion receiued: As Rubarb
draweth Choller; Sean Melancholy; Agarick Flegme; andandandandc. But
yet, (more or lesse) they draw promiscuously. And note also, that
besides Sympathy, between the Purger and the Humour, there is also
another Cause, why some Medicines draw some Humour more than another.
And it is, for that some Medicines work quicker than others: And they
that draw quick, draw only the Lighter, andandandand more fluide
Humours; they that draw flow, worke vpon the more Tough, and Viscous
Humours. And therfore Men must beware, how they take Rubarb, and the
like, alone, familiarly; For it taketh only the Lightest part of the
Humour away, and leaueth the Masse of Humours more obstinate. And the
like may be said of Worme-wood, which is so much magnified.</p>
<p>The fourth Cause is Flatnosity; For Wind stirred moueth to expell:
And we finde that (in effect) all Purgers haue in them a raw Spirit, or
Wind; which is the Principall Cause of Tortion in the Stomach, and
Belly. And therfore Purgers leese (most of them) the vertue, by
Decoction vpon the Fire; And for that Cause are gluen chiefly in
Infusion, Iuyce, or Powder.</p>
<p>The fifth Cause is Compression, or Crushing: As when Water is Crushed
out of a Spunge: So we see that Taking Cold moueth Loosenesse by
Contraction of the Skinn, and outward Parts; And so doth Cold likewise
cause Rheumes, and Defluxions from the Head; And some Astringent
Plasters crush out purulent Matter. This kind of Operation is not found
in many Medicines: Mirabalanes haue it; And it may be the Barkes of
Peaches; For this Vertue requireth an Astriction; but such an
Astriction, as is not gratefull to the Body; (For a pleasing Astriction
doth rather Binde in the Humours, than Expell them:) And therfore such
Astriction is found in Things of an Harrish Taste.</p>
<p>The Sixth Cause is Lubrefaction, and Relaxation. As we see in
Medicines Emollient; Such as are Milke, Honey, Mallowes, Lettuce,
Mercuriall, Pelletory of the Wall, and others. There is also a secret
Vertue of Relaxation in Cold: For the Heat of the Body bindeth the Parts
and Humours together, which Cold relaxeth: As it is seene in Vrine,
Bloud, Pottage, or the like; which, if they be Cold, breake, and
dissolue. And by this kinde of Relaxation, Feare looseneth the Belly;
because the Heat retiring inwards towards the Heart, the Gutts and other
Parts are relaxed; In the same manner, as Feare also causeth Trembling
in the Sinewes. And of this Kinde of Purgers are some Medicines made of
Mercury.</p>
<p>The Seuenth Cause is Abstersion; which is plainly a Scouring off, or
Incision of the more viscous Humors, and making the Humors more fluide;
And Cutting betweene them, and the Part. As is found in Nitrous Water,
which scoureth Linnen Cloth (speedily) from the Foulenesse. But this
Incision must be by a Sharpnesse, without Astriction: Which wee finde in
Salt, Worm-wood, Oxymel, and the like.</p>
<p>There be Medicines, that moue Stooles, and not Vrine; Some other,
Vrine, and not Stooles, Those that Purge by Stoole are such as enter not
at all, or little into the Mesentery Veines; But either at the first are
not digestible by the Stomach, and therefore moue immediatly downwards
to the Gutts; Or else are afterwards reiected by the Mesentery Veines,
and so turne likewise downwards to the Gutts; and of these two kindes
are most Purgers. But those that moue Vrine, are such, as are well
digested of the Stomach, and well receiued also of the Mesenfery Veines;
So they come as farre as the Liuer, which sendeth Vrine to the Bladder,
as the Whey of Bloud: And those Medicines being Opening and Piercing,
doe fortifie the Operation of the Liuer, in sending downe the wheyey
Part of the Bloud to the Reines. For Medicines Vrinatiue doe not worke
by Reiection, and Indigestion, as Solutiue doe.</p>
<p>There be diuers Medicines, which in greater Quantity, moue Stock, and
in smaller, Vrine: And so contrariwise, some that in greater Quantity,
moue Vrine, and in Smaller, Stoole. Of the former sort is Rubarb, and
some others. The Cause is, for that Rubarb is a Medicine, which the
Stomach in a small Quantity doth digest, and ouercome, (being not
Flatuous, nor Loathsome;) and so sendeth it to the Mesentery Veines; And
so being opening, it helpeth downe Vrine: But in a greater Quantitie,
the Stomach cannot ouercome it, and so it goeth to the Gutts. Pepper by
some of the Ancients is noted to be of the second sort; which being in
small Quantity, moueth wind in the Stomach and Gutts, and so expelleth
by Stoole; But being in greater Quantity, dissipateth the Wind; And it
selfe gotteth to the Mesentery veines; And so to the Liuer, and Reines;
where, by Heating and Opening, it sendeth downe Vrine more
plentifully.</p>
<p>Wee haue spoken of Euacuating of the Body; wee will now speake
something of the Filling of it by Restoratines in Consumptions, and
Emaciating Diseases. In Vegetables, there is one Part that is more
Nourishing than another; As Graines, and Roots nourish more, than the
Leaues; In so much as the Order of the Foliatanes was put downe by the
Pope, as finding Leaues vnable to Nourish Mans Body. Whether there be
that difference in the Flesh of Liuing Creatures, is not well inquired:
As whether Liuers, and other Entrails, be not more Nourishing, than the
Outward Flesh. We find that amongst the Romans, a Gooses Liuer was a
great Delicacy; In so much as they had Artificiall Meanes to make it
faire, and great; But whether it were more Nourishing, appeareth not. It
is certaine, that Marrow is more Nourishing than Fat. And I conceiue
that some Decoction of Bones, and Sinewes, stamped, and well strained,
would bee a very Nourishing Broth: Wee finde also that Scotch Skinck,
(which is a Pottage of strong Nourishment,) is made with the Knees, and
Sinewes of B-est, but long boiled: letty also, which they vse for a
Restoratiue, is chiefly made of K-uckles of Veale. The Pulp that is
within the Crafish or Crabb, which they spice and butter, is more
Nourishing than the Flesh of the Crabb or Crafish. The Yolkes of Egges
are clearely more Nourishing than the Whites. So that it should seeme,
that the Parts of Liuing Creatures, that lye more Inwards, nourish more
than the Outward Flesh: Except it bee the Braine; which the Spirits prey
too much vpon, to leaue it any great Vertue of Nourishing. It seemeth
for the Nourishing of Aged Men, or Men in Consumptions, some such thing
should be Deuised, as should be halfe Chylus, before it be put into the
Stomach.</p>
<p>Take two large Capons; perboile them vpon a soft fire, by the space
of an houre, or more, till in effect all the Bloud be gone. Adde in the
Decoction the Pill of a Sweet Limon, or a good part of the Pill of a
Citron, and a little Mace. Cut off the Shanckes, and throw them away.
Then with a good strong Chopping-knife, mince the two Capons, bones and
all, as small as ordinary Minced Meat; Put them into a large neat
Boulter; Then take a Kilderkin, sweet, and well feasoned, of foure
gallons of Beere, of 8.-. strength, new as it commeth from the Tunning;
Make in the Kilderkin a great Bung-hole of purpose: Then thrust into it,
the Boulter (in which the Capons are) drawne out in length; Let it
steepe in it three Dayes, and three Nights, the Bung-hole open, to
worke; Then close the Bung-hole, and so let it continue, a Day and a
halfe; Then draw it into bottles, and you may drinke it well after three
dayes Botteling; And it will last six weeks (approued.) It drinketh
fresh, flowreth and mantleth exceedingly; It drinketh not newish at all;
It is an excellent Drinke for a Consumption, to be drunke either alone,
or Carded with some other Beere. It quencheth Thirst, and hath no whit
of windinesse. Note, that it is not possible, that Meat and Bread,
either in Broths, or taken with Drink, as is vsed, should get forth into
the veines, and outward Parts, so finely, and easily, as when it is thus
Incorporate, and made almost a Chylus aforehand.</p>
<p>Triall would bee made of the like Brew with Potado Roots, or Burr
Roots, or the Pith of Artichoakes, which are nourishing Meats: It may be
tried also, with other flesh; As Phesant, Partridge, Young Porke, Pigge,
Venison, especially of young Deere, andandandandc.</p>
<p>A Mortresse made with the Brawne of Capons, stamped, and strained,
and mingled (after it is made) with like quantitie, (at the least,) of
Almond Butter; is an excellent Meat to Nourish those that are weake;
Better than Blanck-Manger, or Ielly: And so is the Cullice of Cocks,
boyled thick with the like Mixture of Almond Butter: For the Mortresse,
or Cullice, of it selfe, is more Sauoury and strong; And not so fit for
Nourishing of weake Bodies; But the Almonds that are not of so high a
taste as Flesh, doe excellently qualifie it.</p>
<p>Indian Maiz hath (of certaine) an excellent Spirit of Nourishment;
But it must be throughly boyled, and made into a Maiz-Creame like a
Barley Creame. I iudge the same of Rize, made into a Creame; For Rize is
in Turky, and other Countries of the East, most fed vpon; But it must be
throughly boyled in respect of the Hardnesse of it: And also because
otherwise it bindeth the Body too much.</p>
<p>Pistachoes, so they be good, and not musty, ioyned with Almonds in
Almond Milke; Or made into a Milke of themselues, like vnto Almond
Milke, but more greene, are an excellent Nourisher. But you shall doe
well, to adde a little Ginger, scraped, because they are not without
some subtill windinesse</p>
<p>Milke warme from the Cow, is found to be a great Nourisher, and a
good Remedy in Consumptions: But then you must put into it, when you
milke the Cow, two little bagges; the one of Powder of Mint, the other
of Powder of Red Roses; For they keepe the Milke somewhat from Turning,
or Crudling in the stomach; And put in Sugar also, for the same cause,
and partly for the Tasts sake; But you must drinke a good draught that
it may stay lesse time in the stomach, left it Cruddle: And let the Cup
into which you milke the Cow, bee set in a greater Cup of hot water,
that you may take it warme. And Cow-milke thus prepared, I iudge to be
better for a Consumption, than Asse-milke, which (it is true) turneth
not so easily, but it is a little harrish; Marry it is more proper for
Sharpnesse of Vrine, and Exulceration of the Bladder, and all manner of
Lenifyings. Womans milke likewise is prescribed, when all faile; but I
commend it not; as being a little too neere the Iuyce of Mans Body, to
be a good Nourisher; Except it be in Infants, to whom it is
Naturall.</p>
<p>Oyle of Sweet Almonds, newly drawen, with Sugar, and a little Spice,
spread vpon Bread tosted, is an Excellent Nourisher; But then to keepe
the Oyle from frying in the Stomach, you must drinke a good draught of
Milde Beere after it; And to keepe it from relaxing the Stomach too
much, you must put in a little Powder of Cinnamon.</p>
<p>The Yolkes of Eggs are of themselues so well prepared by Nature for
Nourishment; As (so they be Potched, or Reare boiled) they need no other
Preparation, or Mixture; yet they may be taken also rawe, when they are
new laid, with Malmesey, or Sweet wine; You shall doe well to put in
some few Slices of Eryngium Roots, and a little Amber-grice; For by this
meanes, besides the immediate Facultie of Nourishment, such Drinke will
strengthen the Backe; So that it will not draw downe the Vrine too fast;
For too much Vrine doth alwaies hinder Nourishment.</p>
<p>Mincing of meat, as in Pies, and buttered Minced Meat, saueth the
Grinding of the Teeth; And therefore, (no doubt) it is more Nourishing;
Especially in Age; Or to them that haue weake Toeth; But the Butter is
not so proper for weake Bodies; And therfore it were good to moisten it
with a little Claret wine, Pill of Limon, or Orenge, cut small, Sugar,
and a very little Cinnamon, or Nutmegg. As for Chaetts, which are
likewise minced Meat, in stead of Butter, and Fat, it were good to
moisten them, partly with Creame, or Almond, or Pistachomilke, or Barly,
or Maiz Creame; Adding a little Coriander Seed, and Carraway Seed, and a
very little Saffron. The more full Handling of Alimentation we reserue
to the due place.</p>
<p>Wee haue hitherto handled the Particulars which yeeld best, and
easiest, and plentifullest Nourishment; And now we will speake of the
best Meanes of Conueying, and Conuerting the Nourishment.</p>
<p>The First Meanes is, to procure that the Nourishment may not be
robbed, and drawen away; wherin that, which we haue already said, is
very Materiall; To prouide, that the Reines draw not too strongly an
ouer-great Part of the Bloud into Vrine. To this adde that Precept of
Aristotle, that Wine be forborne in all Consumptions; For that the
Spirits of the Wine, doe prey vpon the Roseide Iuyce of the Body, and
inter-common with the Spirits of the Body, and so deceiue and robbe them
of their Nourishment. And therefore if the Consumption growing from the
weaknes of the Stomach, doe force you to vse Wine; let it alwaies be
burnt, that the Quicker Spirits may euaporate; or at the least quenched
with two little wedges of Gold, six or seuen times repeated. Adde also
this Prouision, That there be not too much Expence of the Nourishment,
by Exhaling, and Sweating: And therfore if the Patient be apt to sweat,
it must be gently restrained. But chiefly Hippocrates Rule is to bee
followed; who aduiseth quite contrary to that which is in vse: Namely,
that the Linnen, or Garment next the Flesh, be in Winter drie, and oft
changed; And in Sommer seldome changed, and smeared ouer with Oyle; For
certaine it is, that any Substance that is fat, doth a little fill the
Pores of the Body, and stay Sweat, in some Degree. But the more cleanly
way is, to haue the Linnen smeared lightly ouer, with Oyle of Sweet
Almonds; And not to forbeare shifting as oft as is fit.</p>
<p>The Second Meanes is, to send forth the Nourishment into the Parts,
more strongly; For which, the working must be by Strengthening of the
Stomach; And in this, because the Stomach is chiefly comforted by Wine,
and Hot things, which otherwise hurt; it is good to resort to Outward
Applications to the Stomach: Wherin it hath beene tried, that the Quilts
of Roses, Spices, Mastick, Wormewood, Mint, andandandandc. are nothing
so helpfull, as to take a Cake of New bread, and to bedew it with a
little Sack, or Alegant; And to drie it; And after it be dried a little
before the Fire, to put it within a cleane Napkin, and to lay it to the
Stomach: For it is certaine, that all Flower hath a potent Vertue of
Astriction; In so much as it hardeneth a peece of flesh, or a Flower,
that is laid in it: And therefore a Bagge quilted with Bran, is likewise
very good; but it drieth somewhat too much; and therefore it must not
lye long.</p>
<p>The Third Meanes (which may be a Branch of the former) is to send
forth the Nourishment the better by Sleepe. For we see, that Beares, and
other Creatures that sleepe in the Winter, wax exceeding fat: And
certaine it is, (as it is commonly beleeued) that Sleepe doth Nourish
much; Both for that the Spirits do lesse spend the Nourishment in
Sleepe, then when liuing Creatures are awake: And because (that which is
to the present purpose) it helpeth to thrust out the Nourishment into
the Parts. Therefore in Aged men, and weake Bodies, and such as abound
not with Choller, a short Sleepe after dinner doth helpe to Nourish; For
in such Bodies there is no feare of an ouer-hastie Disgestion, which is
the Inconuenience of Postmeridian Sleepes. Sleepe also in the Morning,
after the taking of somewhat of easie Digestion; As Milke from the Cow,
Nourishing Breth, or the like; doth further Nourishment: But this would
bee done, sitting vpright, that the Milke or Broth may passe the more
speedily to the bottome of the Stomach.</p>
<p>The Fourth Meanes is to prouide that the Parts themselues may draw to
them the Nourishment strongly. There is an Excellent Obseruation of
Aristotle; That a great Reason, why Plants (some of them) are of greater
Age, than Liuing Creatures, is, for that they yearely put forth new
Leaues, and Boughes; whereas Liuing Creatures put forth (after their
Period of Growth,) nothing that is young, but Haire and Nailes; which
are Excrements, and no Parts. And it is most certaine, that whatsoeuer
is young, doth draw Nourishment better, than that which is Old; And then
(that which is the Mystery of that Obseruation) young Boughes, and
Leaues, calling the Sap vp to them; the same Nourisheth the Body, in the
Passage. And this we see notably proued also, in that the oft Cutting,
or Polling of Hedges, Trees, and Herbs, doth conduce much to their
Lasting. Transferre therefore this Obseruation to the Helping of
Nourishment in Liuing Creatures: The Noblest and Principall Vse whereof
is, for the Prolongation of Life; Restauration of some Degree of Youth;
and Inteneration of the Parts: For certaine it is, that there are in
Liuing Creatures Parts that Nourish, and Repaire easily; And Parts that
Nourish and repaire hardly, And you must refresh, and renew those that
are easie to Nourish, that the other may be refreshed, and (as it were)
Drinke in Nourishment, in the Passage. Now wee see that Draught Oxen,
put into good Pasture, recouer the Flesh of young Beese; And Men after
long Emaciating Diets, wax plumpe, and fat, and almost New: So that you
may surely conclude, that the frequent and wise Vse of those Emaciating
Diets, and of Purgings; And perhaps of some kinde of Bleeding; is a
principall Meanes of Prolongation of Life; and Restoring some Degree of
Youth: For as we haue often said, Death commeth vpon Liuing Creatures
like the Torment of McZentius;</p>
<p>Mortua quinetiam iungebat Corporavinis,</p>
<p>Componens Manibus{que} Manus, at{que} Oribus Ora.</p>
<p>For the Parts in Mans Body easily reparable, (as Spirits, Bloud, and
Flesh,) die in the Embracement of the Parts hardly reparable, (as Bones,
Nerues, and Membranes;) And likewise some Entrails (which they reckon
amongst the Spermaticall Parts) are hard to repaire: Though that
Diuision of Spermaticall, and Menstrnall Parts, be but a Conceit. And
this same Obseruation also may be drawne to the present purpose of
Nourishing Emaciated Bodies: And therefore Gentle Frication draweth
forth the Nourishment, by making the Parts a little hungry, and heating
them; whereby they call forth Nourishment the better. This Frication I
wish to be done in the Morning. It is also best done by the Hand, or a
peece of Scarlet wooll, wet a little with Oile of Almonds, mingled with
a small Quantity of Bay-sals, or Saffron. We see that the very Currying
of Horses doth make them fat, and in good liking.</p>
<p>The Fifth Meanes is, to further the very Act of Assimilation of
Nourishment; which is done by some outward Emollients, that make the
Parts more apt to Assimilate. For which I haue compounded an Ointment of
Excellent Odour, which I call Roman Ointment, vide the Receit. The vse
of it would be betweene Sleepes; For in the latter Sleepe the Parts
Assimilate chiefly.</p>
<p>There be many Medicines, which by themselues would doe no Cure, but
perhaps Hurt; but being applyed in a certaine Order, one after another,
doe great Cures. I haue tried (my selfe) a Remedy for the Gout, which
hath seldome failed, but driuen it away in 24. Houres space: It is first
to apply a Pultasse; Of which vide the Receit; And then a Bath or
Fomentation, of which vide the Receit; And then a Plaister, vide the
Receit. The Pultasse relaxeth the Pores, and maketh the Humour apt to
Exhale. The Fomentation calleth forth the Humour by Vapours; But yet in
regard of the way made by the Pultasse. Draweth gently; And therfore
draweth the Humour out; and doth not draw more to it; For it is a Gentle
Fomentation, and hath withall a Mixture, (though very little) of some
Stupefactine. The Plaister is a Moderate Astringent Plaister, which
repelleth New Humour from falling. The Pultasse alone would make the
Part more soft, and weake; And apter to take the Defluxion and
Impression of the Humour. The Fomentation alone, if it were too weake,
without way made by the Pultasse, would draw forth little; If too
strong, it would draw to the Part, as well as draw from it. The Plaister
alone, would pen the Humour already contained in the Part, and so
exasperate it, as well as forbid new Humour. Therefore they must be all
taken in Order, as is said. The Pultasse is to be laid to for two or
three Houres: The Fomentation for a Quarter of an Houre, or somewhat
better, being vsed hot, and seuen or eight times repeated: The Plaister
to continue on still, till the Part be well confirmed.</p>
<p>There is a secret Way of Cure, (vnpractized;) By Assuetude of that
which in it selfe hurteth.Poysons haue beene made, by some, Familiar, as
hath beene said. Ordinary keepers of the Sicke of the Plague, are
seldome infected. Enduring of Torture, by Custome, hath been made more
casie: The Brooking of Enormous Quantity of Meats, and so of Wine or
Strong Drinke, hath beene, by Custome, made to be without Surfet, or
Drunkennesse. And generally Diseases that are Chronicall, as Coughes.,
Phthisickes, some kindes of Palseyes, Lunacies, andandandandc. are most
dangerous at the first: Therefore a wise Physitian will consider whether
a Disease be Incurable; Or whether the Iust Cure of it be not full of
perill; And if he finde it to bee such, let him resort to Palliation;
And alleuiate the Symptome, without busying himselfe too much with the
perfect Cure: And many times, (if the Patient be indeed patient,) that
Course will exceed all Expectation. Likewise the Patient himselfe may
striue, by little and little, to Ouercome the Symptome, in the
Exacerbation, and so, by time, turne Suffering into Nature.</p>
<p>Diuers Diseases, especially Chronicall, (such as Quartan Agues;) are
somtimes cured by Surset, and Excesses; As Excesse of Meat, Excesse of
Drinke, Extraordinary Fasting, Extraordinary Stirring, or Lassitude,
andandandand the like. The Cause is, for that Diseases of Cotinuance get
an Adue¯titious Strength fro¯ Custome, besides their Materiall Cause
from the Humours: So that the Breaking of the Custome doth leaue them
only to their first Cause; which if it be any thing weake will fall off.
Besides, such Excesses doe Excite and Spur Nature, which thereupon
riseth more forcibly against the Disease.</p>
<p>There is in the Body of Man a great Consent in the Motion of the
seuerall Parts. We see, it is Childrens sport, to proue whether they can
rub vpon their Brest with one hand, and pat vpon their Fore-head with
another; And straight-waies, they shall sometimes rubbe with both Hands,
or pat with both hands. We see, that when the Spirits, that come to the
Nosthrills, expell a bad Sent, the Stomach is ready to Expell by Vomit.
We finde that in Consumptions of the Lungs, when Nature cannot expell by
Cough, Men fall into Fluxes of the Belly, and then they dye. So in
Pestilent Diseases, if they cannot be expelled by Sweat, they fall
likewise into Loosenesse, and that is commonly Mortall. Therfore
Physitians should ingeniously contriue, how by Motions that are in their
Power, they may excite Inward Motions that are not in their Power, by
Consent: As by the Stench of Feathers, or the like, they cure the Rising
of the Mother.</p>
<p>Hippocrates Aphorisme, In Morbis minus, is a good profound Aphorisme.
It importeth, that Diseases, contrary to the Complexion, Age, Sexe,
Season of the yeare, Diet, andandandandc. are more dangerous, than those
that are Concurrent. A Man would thinke it should be otherwise; For
that, when the Accident of Sicknesse, and the Naturall Disposition, doe
second the one the other, the Disease should be more forcible: And so
(no doubt) it is; if you suppose like Quantity of Matter. But that,
which maketh good the Aphorisine, is; Because such Diseases doe shew a
greater Collection of Matter, by that they are able to ouercome those
Naturall Inclinations to the Contrary. And therefore in Diseases of that
kinde, let the Physitian apply himselfe more to Purgation, than to
Alteration; Because the Offence is in the Quantity; and the Qualities
are rectified of themselues.</p>
<p>Physitians do wisely prescribe, that there be Preparatiues vsed
before Iust Purgations; For certaine it is, that Purgers doe many times
great Hurt, if the Body be not accommodated, both before, and after the
Purging. The Hurt that they doe, for want of Preparation before Purging,
is by the Sticking of the Humours, and their not comming faire away;
Which causeth in the Body great Perturbations, and ill Accidents, during
the Purging; And also, the diminishing, and dulling of the Working of
the Medicine it selfe, that it purgeth not sufficiently. Therefore the
worke of Preparation is double; To make the Humours fluide, and mature;
And to make the Passages more open: For both those helpe to make the
Humours passe readily. And for the former of these, Sirrups are most
profitable; And for the Latter, Apozumes, or Preparing Broaths; Clisters
also helpe, lest the Medicine stop in the Guts, and worke gripingly. But
it is true, that Bodies abounding with Humours; And fat Bodies; And Open
weather; are Preparatines in themselues; because they make the Humours
more fluide. But let a Physitian beware, how he purge after hard Frostie
Weather, and in a Leane Body, without Preparation. For the Hurt, that
they may doe after Purging; It is caused by the Lodging of some Humours
in ill Places: For it is certaine, that there be Humours, which
somewhere placed in the Body, are quiet, and doe little hurt; In other
Places, (especially Passages,) doe much mischiefe. Therefore it is good,
after Purging, to vse Apozumes, and Broths, not so much Opening as those
vsed before Purging, but Absterfine and Mundifying Clisters also are
good to conclude with, to draw away the Reliques of the Humours, that
may haue descended to the Lower Region of the Body.</p>
<p>Bloud is stanched diuers waies. First by Astringents, and
Repercussiue Medicines. Secondly by Drawing of the Spirits and Bloud
inwards; which is done by Cold; As Iron, or a Stone laid to the neck
doth stanch the Bleeding at the Nose; Also it hath beene tryed, that the
Testicles, being put into sharp Vineger, hath made a suddaine Recesse of
the Spirits, and stanched Bloud. Thirdly by the Recesse of the Bloud by
Sympathy. So it hath beene tried, that the part that bleedeth, being
thrust into the Body of a Capon, or Sheepe, new ript and bleeding, hath
stanched Bloud; The Bloud, as it seemeth, sucking and drawing vp, by
similitude of substance, the Bloud it meeteth with, and so it selfe
going backe. Fourthly by Custome and Time; So the Prince of Aurange, in
his first hurt, by the Spanish Boy, could finde no meanes to stanch the
Bloud, either by Medicine or Ligament; but was faine to haue the Orifice
of the Wound stopped by Mens Thumbes, succeeding one another, for the
space at least of two Dayes; And at the last the bloud by Custome onely
retired. There is a fifth Way also in vse, to let Bloud in an Aduerse
Part, for a Revulsion.</p>
<p>It helpeth, both in Medicine, and Aliment, to Change and not to
continue the same Medicine andandandand Aliment still. The Cause is, for
that Nature by continuall Vso of any Thing, groweth to a Sacietie, and
Dulnesse, either of Appetite, or Working. And we see that Assuetude of
Things Hurtfull doth make them leese their force to Hurt; As Poyson,
which with vse some haue brought themselues to brooke. And therefore it
is no maruaile, though Things helpfull, by Custome, leese their force to
Helpe. I count Intermission almost the same thing with Change; For that,
that hath beene intermitted, is after a fort new.</p>
<p>It is found by Experience, that in Diets of Guaiacum, Sarza, and the
like (especially if they be strict,) the Patient is more troubled in the
beginning, then after continuance; Which hath made some of the more
delicate Sort of patients, giue them ouer in the middest; Supposing that
if those Diets trouble them so much at first, they shall not be able to
endure them to the End. But the Cause is, for that all those Diets, doe
drie vp Humours, Rheumes, and the like; And they cannot Drie vp vntil
they haue first attenuated; And while the Humour is attenuated, it is
more Fluid, then it was before, and troubleth the Body a great deale
more vntill it be dried vp, and consumed. And therefore Patients must
expect a due time, and not checke at them at the first.</p>
<p>The Producing of Cold is a thing very worthy the Inquisition; both
for Vse, and Disclosure of Causes. For Heat and Cold are Natures two
Hands, whereby she chiefly worketh: And Heat we haue in readinesse, in
respect of the Fire; But for Cold we must staie till it commeth; or
seecke it in deepe Caues, or high Mountaines: And when all is done, we
cannot obtaine it in any great degree: For Furnaces of Fire are farre
hotter, then a Sommers Sunne; But Vaults, or Hills are not much Colder
then a Winters Frost.</p>
<p>The first Meanes of Producing Cold, is that which Nature presenteth
vs withall; Namely the Expiring of Cold out of the Inward Parts of the
Earth in Winter, when the Sun hath no power to ouercome it; the Earth
being (as hath beene noted by some) Primum Frigidum. This hath beene
asserted, as well by Auncient as by Moderne Philosophers: It was the
Tenet of Parmenides. It was the opinion of the Authour of the discourse
in Plutarch (for I take it that booke was not Plutarches owne) De prime
Frigide. It was the opinion of Telesius, who hath renewed the Philosophy
of Parmenides, and is the best of the Nouellists.</p>
<p>The Second Cause of Cold is the Contact of Cold Bodies; For Cold is
Actiue and Transitiue into Bodies Adiacent, as well as Heat: which is
seene in those things that are touched with Snow or Cold water. And
therefore, whosoeuer will be an Inquirer into Nature, let him resort to
a Conseruatory of Snow and Ice; Such as they vse for delicacy, to coole
Wine in Summer: Which is a Poore and Contemptible vse, in respect of
other vses, that may bee made of such Conseruatories.</p>
<p>The Third Cause is the Primary Nature of all Tangible bodies: For it
is well to be noted, that all Things whatsoeuer (Tangible) are of
themselues Cold; Except they haue an Accessory Heat by fire; Life; or
Motion: For euen the Spirit of Wine, or Chy-icall Oyles, which are so
hot in Operation, are to the first Touch Cold; And Aire it selfe
compressed, and Condensed a little by blowing, is Cold.</p>
<p>The Fourth Cause is the Density of the Body; For all Dense Bodies are
Colder then most other Bodies; As Mettalls, Stone, Glasse; And they are
longer in Heating than Softer Bodies. And it is certaine, that Earth,
Dense, Tangible, hold all of the Nature of Cold. The Cause is, for that
all Matters Tangible being Cold, it must needs follow, that where the
Matter is moist Congregate, the Cold is the greater.</p>
<p>The Fifth Cause of Cold, or rather of increase and vehemence of Cold,
is a Quicke Spirit inclosed in a Cold Body: As will appeare to any that
shall attentiuely consider of Nature in many Instances. Wee see Nitre
(which hath a Quicke Spirit) is Cold; more Cold to the Tongue, then a
Stone; So Water is Colder then Oile, because it hath a Quicker Spirit;
For all Oile, though it hath the Tangible Parts better digested then
Water, yet hath it a duller Spirit: So Snow is Colder then Water,
because it hath more Spirit within it: So we see that Salt put to Ice
(as in the producing of the Artificiall Ice) increaseth the Actiuity of
Cold: So some In — cta which haue Spirit of Life, as Snakes, and
Silkwormes, are, to the touch, Cold. So Quick-filuer is the Coldest of
Mettals, because it is Fullest of Spirit.</p>
<p>The Sixth Cause of Cold is the Chasing and Driuing away of Spirits,
such as haue some Degree of Heat: For the Banishing of the Heat must
needs leaue any Body Cold. This we see in the Operation of Opium, and
Stupefactiues, vpon the Spirits of liuing Creatures: And it were not
amisse to trie Opium, by laying it vpon the Top of a Weather-glasse, to
see whether it will contract the Aire: But I doubt it will not succeed:
For besides that the vertue of Opium will hardly penetrate thorow such a
Body as Glasse, I conceiue that Opium, and the like, make the Spirits
fly rather by Malignity, then by Cold.</p>
<p>Seuenthly, the same Effect must follow vpon the Exhaling or Drawing
out of the warme Spirits, that doth vpon the Flight of the Spirits.
There is an Opinion, that the Moone is Magneticall of Heat, as the Sun
is of Cold, and Moisture: It were not amisse therefore to trie it, with
Warme waters; The one exposed to the Beames of the Moone; the other with
some Skreene betwixt the Beames of the Moone and the water; As we vse to
the Sunne for Shade; And to see whether the former will coole sooner.
And it were also good to inquire, what other Meanes there may be, to
draw forth the Exile heat, which is in the Aire; for that may be a
Secret of great Power to Produce Cold weather.</p>
<p>We haue formerly set downe the Meanes of turning Aire into water, in
the Experiment 27. But because it is Magnale Nature; And tendeth to the
subduing of a very great effect; And is also of Manifold vse; we will
adde some Instances in Consort that giue light thereunto.</p>
<p>It is reported by some of the Ancients, that Sailers haue vsed, euery
Night, to hang Fleeces of wooll on the sides of their Ships, the Wooll
towards the water; And that they haue crushed fresh Water out of them,
in the Morning, for their vse. And thus much we haue tried, that a
Quantitie of Wooll tied loose together, being let downe into a deepe
Well; And hanging in the Middle, some three Fathome from the water, for
a night, in the Winter time; increased in weight, (as I now remember) to
a fifth Part.</p>
<p>It is reported by one of the Ancients, that in Lydia, neare Pergamus,
there were certaine Worke-men, in time of Warres, fled into Caues; And
the Mouth of the Caues being stopped by the Enemies, they were famished.
But long time after the dead Bones were found; And some Vessels which
they had carried with them; And the vessels full of Water; And that
Water, thicker, and more towards Ice, than Common Water: which is a
Notable Instance of Condensation, and Induration, by Buriall under
Earth, (in Caues,) for long time; And of version also (as it should
seeme,) of Aire into Water; if any of those vessels were Emptie. Trie
therefore a small Bladder hung in Snow; And the like in Nitre; And the
like in Quick-filuer: And if you finde the Bladders fallen, or shrunke;
you may be sure the Aire is condensed by the Cold of those Bodies; As it
would be in a Caue vnder Earth.</p>
<p>It is reported of very good credit, that in the East Indies, if you
set a Tub of Water open, in a Roome where Cloues are kept, it will be
drawne dry in 24 houres; Though it stand at some distance from the
Cloues. In the Countrey, they vse many times, in deceit, when their
wooll is new shorne, to set some Pailes of water by, in the same Roome;
to increase the weight of the wooll: But it may be, that the Heat of the
Wooll, remaining from the body of the Sheepe; or the Heat gathered by
the lying close of the wooll, helpeth to draw the watry Vapour; But that
is nothing to the Version.</p>
<p>It is Reported also credibly, that Wooll new shorne, being laid
casually vpon a Vessell of Verinyce, after some time, had drunke vp a
great part of the Veriuyce, though the Vessell were whole without any
Flaw and had not the Bung-hole open. In this Instance, there is (vpon
the by) to be noted, the Percolation, or Suing of the Veriuyce through
the wood; For Veriuyce of it selfe would neuer haue passed thorow the
wood: So as, it seemeth, it must be first in a kinde of Vapour, before
it passe.</p>
<p>It is especially to be noted, that the Cause, that doth facilitate
the Version of Aire into water, when the Aire is not in grosse, but
subtilly mingled with Tangible Bodies, is, (as hath beene partly touched
before,) for that Tangible Bodies haue an Antipathy with Aire; And if
they finde and Liquid Body, that is more dense, neare them, they will
draw it: And after they haue drawne it, they will condense it more, and
in effect incorporate it; For wee see that a Spunge, or Wooll, or Sugar,
or a Woollen cloth, being put but in part, in Water, or Wine, will draw
the Liquour higher, and beyond the place, where the Water or wine
commeth. We see also, that Wood, Lute-strings, and the like, doe swell
in moist Seasons: As appeareth by the Breaking of the Strings, the Hard
Turning of the Pegs, and the Hard drawing forth of Boxes, and Opening of
Wainseet deeres; which is a kinde of Infusion: And is much like to an
Infusion in water, which will make wood to swell: As we see in the
Filling of the Chops of Boules, by laying them in water. But for that
part of these Experiments, which concerneth Attraction; we will reserue
it to the proper Title of Attraction.</p>
<p>There is also a Version of Aire into water, seene in the Sweating of
Marbles, and other Stones. And of Wainsces before and in moist weather:
This must be, either by some Moisture the Body yeeldeth; Or else by the
Moist Aire thickned against the hard body. But it is plaine, that it is
the latter; For that we see Wood painted with Oyle Colour, will sooner
gather drops in a moist Night, than Wood alone: which is caused by the
Smoothnesse and Closenesse; which letteth in no part of the Vapour, and
so turneth it backe, and thickeneth it into Dew. We see also, that
Breathing vpon a Glasse, or Smooth body, giueth a Dew; And in Frosty
Mornings (such as we call Rime frosts) you shall finde drops of Dew vpon
the Inside of Glasse-windowes; And the Frost it selfe vpon the ground is
but a Version or Condensation, of the Moist vapours of the Night, into a
watry substance: Dewes likewise, and Raine, are but the Returnes of
Moist vapours Condensed; The Dew, by the Cold onely of the Sunnes
departure, which is the gentler Cold; Raines, by the Cold of that, which
they call the Middle Region of the Aire; which is the more violent
Cold.</p>
<p>It is very probable (as hath beene touched) that that, which will
turne Water into Ice, will likewise turne Aire Some Degree nearer vnto
water. Therefore trie the Experiment of the Artificiall Turning water
into Ice (whereof we shall speake in another place) with Aire in place
of water, and the Ice about it. And although it be a greater Alteration
to turne Aire into water, than water into Ice: yet there is this Hope,
that by Continuing the Aire longer time, the effect will follow; For
that Artificiall Conuersion of water into Ice, is the worke of a few
Houres; And this of Aire may be tried by a Moneths space, or the
like.</p>
<p>Induration, or Lapidification, of Substances more Soft, is likewise
another degree of Condensation; And is a great Alteration in Nature. The
Effecting and Accelerating thereof is very worthy to be inquired. It is
effected by three Meanes. The first is by Cold; vvhose Property is to
Condense, and constipate, as hath beene said. The Second is by Heat;
which is not proper, but by consequence; For the Heat doth attenuate;
And by Attenuation doth send forth the Spirit and moister Part of a
Body; And vpon that, the more grosse of the Tangible Parts doe contract
and serre themselues together; Both to Auoid Vacuums (as they call it;)
And also to Munite themselues against the Force of the Fire, which they
haue suffered. And the Third is by Assimilation; when a Hard Body
Assimilateth a Soft, being contiguous to it.</p>
<p>The Examples of Induration, taking them promiscuously, are many: As
the Generation of Stones within the Earth, which at the first are but
Rude Earth, or Clay: And so of Mineralls, which come (no doubt) at
first, of luyces Concrete, which afterward indurate: And so of
Porcellane, which is an Artificiall Cement, buried in the Earth a long
time: And so the Making of Bricke, and Tile: Also the Making of Glasse,
of a certaine Sand, and Brake-Roots, and some other Matters: Also the
Exudations of Rock-Diamonds, and Crystall, which harden with time: Also
the Induration of Bead-Amber, which at first is a soft Substance; As
appeareth by the Flies, and Spiders, which are found in it; And many
more: But wee will speake of them distinctly.</p>
<p>For Indurations by Cold, there bee few Trialls of it; For wee haue no
strong or intense Cold here on the Surface of the Earth, so neare the
Beames of the Sunne, and the Heauens. The likeliest Triall is by Snow,
and Ice; For as Snow and Ice, especially being holpen, and their Cold
actiuated by Nitre, or Salt, will turne Water into Ice, and that in a
few houres; So it may be, it will turne wood, or Stiffe Clay, into
Stone, in longer time. Put therefore, into a Conseruing Pit of Snow, and
Ice, (adding some quantity of Salt, and Nitre,) a Peece of Wood, or a
Peece of Tough Clay, and let it lye a Moneth, or more.</p>
<p>Another Triall is by Metalline Waters, which haue virtuall Cold in
them. Put therefore Wood, or Clay, into Smiths water, or other Metalline
water; And try whether it will not harden in some reasonable time. But I
vnderstand it, of Metalline waters, that come by Washing, or Quenching;
And not of Strong Waters that come by dissolution; for they are too
Corrosiue to consolidate.</p>
<p>It is already found, that there are some Naturall Spring-waters, that
will Inlapidate Wood; So as you shall see one peece of Wood, whereof the
Part aboue the Water shall continue Wood; And the Part vnder the Water
shall be turned into a kinde of Grauelly Stons. It is likely those
Waters are of some Metalline Mixture; But there would be more particular
Inquiry made of them. It is certaine, that an Egge was found, hauing
lien many yeeres in the bottome of a Moate, where the Earth had somewhat
ouergrowen it; And this Egge was comen to the Hardnesse of a Stone; And
had the Colours of the white and Yolke perfect: And the Shell shining in
small graines like Sugar, or Alablaster.</p>
<p>Another Experience there is of Induration by Cold, which is already
found; which is, that Metalls, themselues are hardned by often Heating
and Quenching in Cold Water: For Cold euer worketh most potently vpon
Heat Precedene.</p>
<p>For Induration by Heat it must be considered, that Heat, by the
Exhaling of the Moister Parts, doth either harden the Body; As in
Bricks, Tiles, andandandandc; Or if the Heat be more fierce, maketh the
grosser part it selfe, Runne and Melt; As in the making of ordinary
Glosse; And in the Vitrification of Earth, (As wee see in the Inner
Parts of Farneces;) And in the Vitrification of Brick; And of Mettals.
And in the former of these, which is the Hardening by baking, without
Melting, the Heat hath these degrees; First it Indurateth; and then
maketh Fragile; And lastly it doth Inciuerate and Calcinate.</p>
<p>But if you desire to make an Induration with Toughnesse, and lesse
Fragility; A middle way would be taken; Which is that which Artistotle
hath well noted; But would be throughly verified. It is, to decoct
Bodies in water, for two or three dayes; But they must bee such Bodies,
into which the Water will not enter; As Stone, and Metall. For if they
be Bodies into which the Water will enter, then long Seething, will
rather Soften than indurate them. As hath beene tried in Eggs
andandandandc. Therefore, Softer Bodies must be put into Bottles; And
the Bottles hung into Water seething, with the mouths open, aboue the
Water; that no Water may get in; For by this Meaues, the virtuall Heat
of the Water will enter; And such a Heat, as will not make the Body
adust, or fragile; But the Substance of the Water will be shut out. This
Experiment wee made; And it sorted thus. It was tried with a Peece of
Free-stone, and with Pewter, put into the Water at large. The Free-stone
we found receiued in some water; For it was softer, and easier to
scrape, then a peece of the same Stone kept drie. But the Pewter into
which no water could enter, became more white, and liker to Siluer, and
lesse flexible, by much. There were also put into an Earthen Bottle,
placed as before, a good Pellet of Clay, a Peece of Cheese, a Peece of
Chalke, and a Peece of Free-stone. The Clay, came forth almost of the
Hardnesse of Stone; The Cheese likewise very hard, and not well to be
cut: The Chalke and the Free-stone much harder than they were. The
colour of the Clay inclined not a whit to the Colour of Bricke, but
rather to white, as in ordinary Drying by the Sunne. Note, that all the
former Trialls were made by a Boyling vpon a good hot Fire, renewing the
water as it consumed, with other hot water; But the Boyling was but for
twelue houres onely; And it is like that the Experiment would haue beene
more effectuall, if the Boyling had beene for two or three daies, as we
prescribed before.</p>
<p>As touching Assimilation, (for there is a degree of Assimilation euen
in Inanimate bodies) wee see Examples of it in some Stones in
ClayGrounds, lying neare to the top of the Earth, where Pebble is; In
which you may manifestly see diuers Pebbles gathered together, and a
Crust of Cement or Stone betweene them, as hard as the Pebbles
themselues: And it were good to make a Triall of purpose, by taking
Clay, and putting in it diuers Pebble-Stones, thicke set, to see whether
in continuance of time, it will not be harder then other Clay of the
same lump, in which no Pebbles are set. Wee see also in Ruines of old
Walls, especially towards the bottome, the Morter will become as hard as
the Brick; wee see also, that the Wood on the sides of Vessles of Wine,
gathereth a Crust of Tartar, harder then the wood it selfe; And Scales
likewise grow to the Teeth, harder then the Teeth themselues.</p>
<p>Most of all, Induration by Assimilation appeareth in the Bodies of
Trees, and liuing Creatures: For no Nourishment that the Tree receiueth,
or that the liuing Creature receiueth, is so hard as Wood, Bone, or
Horne, andandandandc. but is Indurated after by Assimilation.</p>
<p>The Eye of the vnderstanding, is like the Eye of the Sense: For as
you may see great Obiects through small Crannies, or Leuells, So you may
see great Axiomes of Nature, through small and Contemptible Instances.
The Speedy Depredation of Aire vpon watry Moisture, and Version of the
same into Aire, appeareth in nothing more visible, than in the sudden
Discharge, or vanishing, of a little Cloud of Breath, or Vapour, from
Glasse, or the Blade of a Sword, or any such Polished Body; Such as doth
not at all Detaine, or Imbibe the Moisture; For the Mistinesse
scattereth and breaketh vp suddenly. But the like Cloud, if it were
Oyly, or Fatty, will not discharge; Not because it sticketh faster; But
because Aire preyeth vpon Water; And Flame, and Fire, vpon Oyle; And
therefore, to take out a Spot of Grease, they vse a Coale vpon browne
Paper; because Fire worketh vpon Grease, or Oyle, as Aire doth vpon
Water. And we see Paper oyled, or Wood oyled, or the like last long
moist; but Wet with Water, drie, or putrifie sooner, The Cause is, for
that Aire meddleth little with the Moisture of Oyle.</p>
<p>There is an Admirable demonstration, in the same trifling Instance of
the little Cloud vpon Glasse, or Gemmes or Blades of Swords, of the
Force of Vnion, euen in the least Quantities, and weakest Bodies, how
much it Conduceth to Preseruation of the present Forme; And the
Resisting of a New. For marke well the discharge of that Cloud; And you
shall see it euer breake vp, first in the Skirts, and last in the
middest. We see likewise, that much Water draweth forth the Iuyce of the
Body Infused; But little water, is imbibed by the Body: And this is a
Principall Cause, why in Operation vpon Bodies, for their Version or
Alteration, the Triall in great Quantities, doth not answer the Triall
in small; And so deceiueth many; For that (I say) the greater Body,
resisteth more any Alteration of Forme, and requireth farre greater
Strength in the Actiue Body, that should subdue it.</p>
<p>We haue spoken before, in the fifth Instance, of the Cause of Orient
Colours, in Birds; which is by the Finenesse of the Strainer; we will
now endeuour to reduce the same Axione to a Worke. For this Writing of
our Sylue Syluerum, is (to speake properly) not Neturall History, but a
high kinde of Naturall Magicke. For it is not a Description only of
Nature, but a Breaking of Nature, into great and strange Workes. Trie
therefore, the Anointing ouer of Pigeons, or other Birds, when they are
but in their downe; Or of Whelps, cutting their Haire as short as may
be; Or of some other Beast; with some oyntment, that is not hurtfull to
the Flesh; And that will harden, and sticke very close; And see whether
it will not alter the Colours of the Feathers, or Haire. It is receiued,
that the Pulling off, the first Feathers of Birds, cleane, will make the
new come forth white: And it is certaine, that White is a penurious
Colour, andandandand where Moisture is scant. So Blew Violets,
andandandand other Flowers, if they be starued, turne Pale and White;
Birds, and Horses, by Age, or Scarres, turne white: And the Hoare Haires
of Men, come by the same reason, And therefore in Birds, it is very
likely, that the Feathers that come first, will be many times of diuers
Colours, according to the Nature of the Bird; For that the Skin is more
porous; But when the Skin is more shut, and close, the Feathers will
come White. This is a good Experiment, not only for the Producing of
Birds, and Beasts of strange Colours; but also, for the Disclosure of
the Nature of Colours themselues; which of them require a finer
Porositie, and which a grosser.</p>
<p>It is a worke of Prouidence, that hath beene truly obserued by some;
That the Yolke of the Egge, conduceth little to the Generation of the
Bird; But onely to the Nourishment of the same: For if a Chicken be
opened, when it is new hatched; you shall finde much of the Yolke
remaining. And it is needfull, that Birds, that are shaped without the
Females Wombe; haue in the Egge, as well Matter of Nourishment, as
Matter of generation for the Body. For after the Egge is laid, and
seuered from the Body of the Hen; It hath no more Nourishment from the
Hen; But onely a quickening Heat when shee sitteth. But Beasts, and Men
need not the matter of Nourishment within themselues; Because they are
shaped within the Wombe of the Female, and are Nourished continually
from her Body.</p>
<p>It is an Inueterate and receiued Opinion, that Cantharides applyed to
any Part of the Body, touch the Bladder, and exulcerate it, if they stay
on long. It is likewise Receiued, that a kinde of Stone, which they
bring out of the West Indies, hath a peculiar force to moue Grauell, and
to dissolue the Stone; In so much, as laid but to the wrest, it hath so
forcibly sent downe Grauell, as Men haue beene glad to remoue it; It was
so violent.</p>
<p>It is receiued and confirmed by daily Experience, that the Soales of
the Feet haue great Affinity with the Head, and the Mouth of the
Stomach: As we see, Going wet-shod, to those that vse it not, affecteth
both: Applications of hot Powders to the Feet attenuate first, and after
drie the Rheume: And therefore a Physitian, that would be Mysticall,
prescribeth, for the Cure of the Rheume, that a Man should walke
Continually vpon a Camomill Alley; Meaning, that he should put Camomill
within his Sockes. Likewise Pigeons bleeding, applyed to the Soales of
the Feet, ease the Head: And Soporiferous Medicines applied vnto them,
prouoke Sleepe.</p>
<p>It seemeth, that as the Feet haue a Sympathy with the Head; So the
Wrests and Hands, haue a Sympathy with the Heart; We see the Affects and
Passions of the Heart, and Spirits, are notably disclosed by the Pulse:
And it is often tried, that Iuyces of Stock-Gilly-Flowers, Rose-Campian,
Garlicke, and other things; applied to the Wrests, and renewed; haue
cured long Agues. And I conceiue, that washing with certaine Liquours,
the Palmes of the Hands, doth much good: And they doe well in Heats of
Agues, to hold in the Hands, Egges of Alablaster, and Balls of
Crystall.</p>
<p>Of these things we shall speake more, when we handle the Title of
Sympathy and Antipathy, in the proper Place.</p>
<p>The Knowledge of man (hitherto) hath beene determined by the View, or
Sight; So that whatsoeuer is Inuisible, either in respect of the
Finenesse of the Body it selfe; Or the Smallnesse of the Parts; Or of
the Subtilty of the Motion; is little inquired. And yet these be the
Things that Gouerne Nature Principally; And without which, you cannot
make any true Analysis and Indication of the Proceedings of Nature. The
Spirits or Pneumaticals, that are in all Tangible Bodies, are searce
knowne. Sometimes they take them for Vacuum; wheras they are the most
Actiue of Bodies. Sometimes they take them for Aire; From which they
differ exceedingly, as much as Wine from Water; And as Wood from Earth.
Sometimes they will haue them to be Naturall Heat, or a Portion of the
Element of Fire; Wheras some of them are crude, and cold. And Sometimes
they will haue them to be the Vertues and Qualities of the Tangible
Parts, which they see; whereas they are Things by themselues. And then,
when they come to Plants and liuing Creatures, they call them Soules.
And such Superficiall Speculations they haue; Like Prospectiues, that
shew things inward, when they are but Paintings. Neither is this a
Question of Words, but infinitely materiall in Nature. For Spirits are
nothing else but a Naturall Body, rarified to a Proportion, andandandand
included in the Tangible Parts of Bodies, as in an Integument. And they
be no lesse differing one from the other, than the Dense or Tangible
Parts: And they are in all Tangible Bodies whatsoeuer, more or lesse:
And they are neuer (almost) at rest: And from them, and their Motions,
principally proceed Arefaction, Colliquation, Concoction, Maturation,
Putrefaction, Viuification, and most of the Effects of Nature: For, as
we haue figured them in our Sapientiâ Veterum, in the Fable of
Proserpina, you shall in the Infernall Regiment heare little Doings of
Pluto, but most of proserpina: For Tangible Parts in Bodies are Stupide
things; And the Spirits doe (in effect) all. As for the differences of
Tangible Parts in Bodies, the industry of the Chymists hath giuen some
light, in discerning by their Separations, the Oily, Crude, Pure,
Impure, Fine, grosse Parts of Bodies, and the like. And the Physitians
are content to acknowledge, that Herbs, and Drugs haue diuers parts; As
that Opiums hath a Stupefactiue Part, and a Heating Part; The one mouing
Sleepe, the other a Sweat following; And that Rubarb hath Purging Parts,
and Astringent Parts, andandandandc. But this whole Inquisition is
weakly and Negligently handled. And for the more subtill differences of
the Minute Parts, and the Posture of them in the Body, (which also hath
great Effects) they are not at all touched: As for the Motions of the
Minute Parts of Bodies, which doe so great Effects, they haue not beene
obserued at all; because they are Inuisible, and incurre not to the Eye;
but yet they are to be deprehended by Experience: As Democritus said
well, when they charged him to hold, that the World was made of such
little Moats, as were seene in the Sunne; Atomus (saith he) necessitate
Rationis andandandand Experientia esse connincitur; Atomum enim nemo
vnquam vidit. And therefore the Tumult in the parts of Solide Bodies,
when they are compressed, which is the Cause of all Flight of Bodies
thorow the Aire, and of other Mechanicall Motions, (as hath beene partly
touched before, and shall be throughly handled in due place,) is not
seene at all. But neuerthelesse, if you know it not, or enquire it not
attentiuely and diligently, you shall neuer be able to discerne, and
much lesse to produce, a Number of Mechanicall Motions. Againe, as to
the Motions Corporall, within the Enclosures of Bodies, wherby effects
(which were mentioned before) passe betweene the Spirits, and the
Tangible Parts; (which are, Arefaction, Colliquation, Concoction,
Maturation, andandandandc.) they are not at all handled. But they are
put off by the Names of Vertues, and Natures, and Actions, and Passions,
and such other Logicall Words.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that all Powers in Nature, Heat is the chiefe; both
in the Frame of Nature, and in the workes of Art. Certaine it is
likewise, that the Effects of Heat, are most aduanced, when it worketh
vpon a Body, without losse or dissipation of the Matter; for that euer
betrayeth the Account. And therefore it is true, that the power of Heat
is best perceiued in Distillations, which are performed in close
Vessels, and Receptacles. But yet there is a higher Degree; For
howsoeuer Distillations doe keepe the Body in Cells, and Cloisters,
without Going abroad; yet they giue space vnto Bodies to turne into
Vapour; To returne into Liquour; And to Separate one part from another.
So as Nature doth Expatiate, although it hath not full Liberty: wherby
the true and Vltime Operations of Heat are not attained. But if Bodies
may be altered by Heat, and yet no such Reciprocation of Rarefaction,
and of Condensation, and of Separation, admitted; then it is like that
this Proteus of Matter, being held by the Sleeues, will turne and change
into many Metaworphoses. Take therefore a Square Vessell of Iron, in
forme of a Cube, and let it haue good thicke and strong Sides. Put into
it a Cube of Wood, that may fill it as close as may be; And let it haue
a Couer of Iron, as strong (at least) as the Sides; And let it be well
Luted, after the manner of the Chymists. Then place the Vessell within
burning Coales, kept quicke kindled, for some few houres space. Then
take the Vessell from the Fire, and take off the Couer, and see what is
become of the Wood. I conceiue that since all Inflammation, and
Euaporation are vtterly prohibited, and the Body still turned vpon it
Selfe, that one of these two Effects will follow: Either that the Body
of the Wood will be turned into a kinde of Amalgama, (as the Chymists
call it;) Or that the Finer Part will bee turned into Aire, and the
Grosser sticke as it were baked, and incrustate vpon the Sides of the
Vessell; being become of a Denser Matter, than the Wood it selfe, Crude.
And for another Triall, take also Water, and put it in the like Vessell,
stopped as before; But vse a gentler Heat, and remoue the vessell
sometimes from the Fire; And againe, after some small time, when it is
Cold, renue the Heating of it: And repeat this Aloeration some few
times: And if you can once bring to passe, that the Water, which is one
of the Simplest of Bodies, be changed in Colour, Odour, or Taste, after
the manner of Compound Bodies, you may be sure that there is a great
Worke wrought in Nature, and a Notable Entrance made into strange
Changes of Bodies, and productions: And also a Way made, to doe that by
Fire, in small time, which the Sunne and Age do in long time. But of the
Admirable Effects of this Distillation in Close, (for so we will call
it) which is like the Wombes and Matrices of liuing creatures, where
nothing Expireth, nor Separateth; We will speake fully, in the due
place; Not that we Aime at the making of Paracelsus Pigmey’s; Or any
such Prodigious Follies; But that we know the Effects of Heat will be
such, as will scarce fall vnder the Conceit of Man; If the force of it
be altogether kept in.</p>
<p>There is nothing more Certaine in Nature, than that it is impossible
for any Body, to be vtterly Annibilated; But that, as it was the worke
of the Omnipotency of God, to make Somewhat of Nothing; So it requireth
the like Omnipotency, to turne Somewhat into Nothing. And therefore it
is well said, by an Obscure Writer of the Sect of the Chymists; That
there is no such way to effect the Strange Transmutations of Bodies, as
to endeuour and vrge by all meanes, the Reducing of them to Nothing. And
herein is contained also a great Secret of Preseruation of Bodies from
Change; For if you can prohibit, that they neither turne into Aire,
because no Aire commeth to them; Not goe into the Bodies Adiacent,
because they are vtterly Heterogeneall; Nor make a Round and Circulation
within themselues; they will neuer change, though they be in their
Nature neuer so Perishable, or Mutable. We see, how Flies, and Spiders,
and the like, get a Sepulcher in Amber, more Durable, than the Monument,
and Embalming of the Body of any King. And I conceiue the like will be
of Bodies put into Quick-siluer. But then they must be but thinne; As a
leafe, or a peece of Paper, or Parchment; For if they haue a greater
Crassitude, they will alter in their owne Body, though they spend not.
But of this, We shall speake more, when we handle the Title of
Conseruation of Bodies.</p>
