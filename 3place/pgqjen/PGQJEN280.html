<h4 id="section">13</h4>
<p>Thirdly, we must make a presentation to the understanding of
instances in which the nature under inquiry is found in different
degrees, more or less; which must be done by making a comparison either
of its increase and decrease in the same subject, or of its amount in
different subjects, as compared one with another. For since the form of
a thing is the very thing itself, and the thing differs from the form no
otherwise than as the apparent differs from the real, or the external
from the internal, or the thing in reference to man from the thing in
reference to the universe, it necessarily follows that no nature can be
taken as the true form, unless it always decrease when the nature in
question decreases, and in like manner always increase when the nature
in question increases. This Table therefore I call the Table of Degrees
or the Table of Comparison.</p>
<p>Table of Degrees or Comparison in Heat</p>
<p>I will therefore first speak of those substances which contain no
degree at all of heat perceptible to the touch, but seem to have a
certain potential heat only, or disposition and preparation for hotness.
After that I shall proceed to substances which are hot actually, and to
the touch, and to their intensities and degrees.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In solid and tangible bodies we find nothing which is in its
nature originally hot. For no stone, metal, sulphur, fossil, wood,
water, or carcass of animal is found to be hot. And the hot water in
baths seems to be heated by external causes; whether it be by flame or
subterraneous fire, such as is thrown up from Etna and many other
mountains, or by the conflict of bodies, as heat is caused in the
dissolution of iron and tin. There is therefore no degree of heat
palpable to the touch in animate substances; but they differ in degree
of cold, wood not being equally cold with metal. But this belongs to the
Table of Degrees in Cold.</p></li>
<li><p>As far, however, as potential heat and aptitude for flame is
concerned, there are many inanimate substances found strongly disposed
thereto, as sulphur, naphtha, rock oil.</p></li>
<li><p>Substances once hot, as horse dung from animal heat, and lime or
perhaps ashes and soot from fire, retain some latent remains of their
former heat. Hence certain distillations and resolutions of bodies are
made by burying them in horse dung, and heat is excited in lime by
sprinkling it with water, as already mentioned.</p></li>
<li><p>In the vegetable creation we find no plant or part of plant (as
gum or pitch) which is warm to the human touch. But yet, as stated
above, green herbs gain warmth by being shut up; and to the internal
touch, as the palate or stomach, and even to external parts, after a
little time, as in plasters and ointments, some vegetables are
perceptibly warm and others cold.</p></li>
<li><p>In the parts of animals after death or separation from the body,
we find nothing warm to the human touch. Not even horse dung, unless
enclosed and buried, retains its heat. But yet all dung seems to have a
potential heat, as is seen in the fattening of the land. In like manner
carcasses of animals have some such latent and potential heat, insomuch
that in burying grounds, where burials take place daily, the earth
collects a certain hidden heat which consumes a body newly laid in it
much more speedily than pure earth. We are told too that in the East
there is discovered a fine soft texture, made of the down of birds,
which by an innate force dissolves and melts butter when lightly wrapped
in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Substances which fatten the soil, as dung of all kinds, chalk,
sea sand, salt, and the like, have some disposition to heat.</p></li>
<li><p>All putrefaction contains in itself certain elements of a slight
heat, though not so much as to be perceived by the touch. For not even
those substances which on putrefaction turn to animalculae, as flesh,
cheese, etc., feel warm to the touch; no more does rotten wood, which
shines in the dark. Heat, however, in putrid substances sometimes
betrays itself by foul and powerful odors.</p></li>
<li><p>The first degree of heat therefore among those substances which
feel hot to the touch, seems to be the heat of animals, which has a
pretty great extent in its degrees. For the lowest, as in insects, is
hardly perceptible to the touch, but the highest scarcely equals the
sun’s heat in the hottest countries and seasons, nor is it too great to
be borne by the hand. It is said, however, of Constantius, and some
others of a very dry constitution and habit of body, that in violent
fevers they became so hot as somewhat to burn the hand that touched
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals increase in heat by motion and exercise, wine, feasting,
venus, burning fevers, and pain.</p></li>
<li><p>When attacked by intermittent fevers, animals are at first seized
with cold and shivering, but soon after they become exceedingly hot,
which is their condition from the first in burning and pestilential
fevers.</p></li>
<li><p>Let further inquiry be made into the different degrees of heat in
different animals, as in fishes, quadrupeds, serpents, birds; and also
according to their species, as in the lion, the kite, the man; for in
common opinion fish are the least hot internally, and birds the hottest,
especially doves, hawks, and sparrows.</p></li>
<li><p>Let further inquiry be made into the different degrees of heat in
the different parts and limbs of the same animal. For milk, blood, seed,
eggs, are found to be hot only in a moderate degree, and less hot than
the outer flesh of the animal when in motion or agitated. But what the
degree of heat is in the brain, stomach, heart, etc., has not yet been
in like manner inquired.</p></li>
<li><p>All animals in winter and cold weather are cold externally, but
internally they are thought to be even hotter.</p></li>
<li><p>The heat of the heavenly bodies, even in the hottest countries,
and at the hottest times of the year and day, is never sufficiently
strong to set on fire or burn the driest wood or straw, or even tinder,
unless strengthened by burning glasses or mirrors. It is, however, able
to extract vapor from moist substances.</p></li>
<li><p>By the tradition of astronomers some stars are hotter than
others. Of planets, Mars is accounted the hottest after the sun; then
comes Jupiter, and then Venus. Others, again, are set down as cold: the
moon, for instance, and above all Saturn. Of fixed stars, Sirius is said
to be the hottest, then Cor Leonis or Regulus, then Canicula, and so
on.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun gives greater heat the nearer he approaches to the
perpendicular or zenith; and this is probably true of the other planets
also, according to the proportion of their heat. Jupiter, for instance,
is hotter, probably, to us when under Cancer or Leo than under Capricorn
or Aquarius.</p></li>
<li><p>We must also believe that the sun and other planets give more
heat in perigee, from their proximity to the earth, than they do in
apogee. But if it happens that in some region the sun is at the same
time in perigee and near the perpendicular, his heat must of necessity
be greater than in a region where he is also in perigee, but shining
more obliquely. And therefore the altitude of the planets in their
exaltation in different regions ought to be noted, with respect to
perpendicularity or obliquity.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun and other planets are supposed to give greater heat when
nearer to the larger fixed stars. Thus when the sun is in Leo he is
nearer Cor Leonis, Cauda Leonis, Spica Virginis, Sirius and Canicula,
than when he is in Cancer, in which sign, however, he is nearer to the
perpendicular. And it must be supposed that those parts of the heavens
shed the greatest heat (though it be not at all perceptible to the
touch) which are the most adorned with stars, especially of a larger
size.</p></li>
<li><p>Altogether, the heat of the heavenly bodies is increased in three
ways: first, by perpendicularity; secondly, by proximity or perigee;
thirdly, by the conjunction or combination of stars.</p></li>
<li><p>The heat of animals, and of the rays of the heavenly bodies also
(as they reach us), is found to differ by a wide interval from flame,
though of the mildest kind, and from all ignited bodies; and from
liquids also, and air itself when highly heated by fire. For the flame
of spirit of wine, though scattered and not condensed, is yet sufficient
to set paper, straw, or linen on fire, which the heat of animals will
never do, or of the sun without a burning glass or mirror.</p></li>
<li><p>There are, however, many degrees of strength and weakness in the
heat of flame and ignited bodies. But as they have never been diligently
inquired into, we must pass them lightly over. It appears, however, that
of all flame that of spirit of wine is the softest, unless perhaps ignis
fatuus be softer, and the flames or sparklings arising from the sweat of
animals. Next to this, as I suppose, comes flame from light and porous
vegetable matter, as straw, reeds, and dried leaves, from which the
flame from hairs or feathers does not much differ. Next perhaps comes
flame from wood, especially such as contains but little rosin or pitch;
with this distinction, however, that the flame from small pieces of wood
(such as are commonly tied up in fagots) is milder than the flame from
trunks and roots of trees. And this you may try any day in furnaces for
smelting iron, in which a fire made with fagots and boughs of trees is
of no great use. After this I think comes flame from oil, tallow, wax,
and such like fat and oily substances, which have no great acrimony. But
the most violent heat is found in pitch and rosin; and yet more in
sulphur, camphor, naphtha, rock oil, and salts (after the crude matter
is discharged), and in their compounds, as gunpowder, Greek fire
(commonly called wildfire), and its different kinds, which have so
stubborn a heat that they are not easily extinguished by water.</p></li>
<li><p>I think also that the flame which results from some imperfect
metals is very strong and eager. But on these points let further inquiry
be made.</p></li>
<li><p>The flame of powerful lightning seems to exceed in strength all
the former, for it has even been known to melt wrought iron into drops,
which those other flames cannot do.</p></li>
<li><p>In ignited bodies too there are different degrees of heat, though
these again have not yet been diligently examined. The weakest heat of
all, I think, is that from tinder, such as we use to kindle flame with;
and in like manner that of touchwood or tow, which is used in firing
cannon. After this comes ignited wood or coal, and also bricks and the
like heated to ignition. But of all ignited substances, the hottest, as
I take it, are ignited metals, as iron, copper, etc. But these require
further investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Some ignited bodies are found to be much hotter than some flames.
Ignited iron, for instance, is much hotter and more consuming than flame
of spirit of wine.</p></li>
<li><p>Of substances also which are not ignited but only heated by fire,
as boiling water and air confined in furnaces, some are found to exceed
in heat many flames and ignited substances.</p></li>
<li><p>Motion increases heat, as you may see in bellows and by blowing;
insomuch that the harder metals are not dissolved or melted by a dead or
quiet fire, till it be made intense by blowing.</p></li>
<li><p>Let trial be made with burning glasses, which (as I remember) act
thus. If you place a burning glass at the distance of (say) a span from
a combustible body, it will not burn or consume it so easily as if it
were first placed at the distance of (say) half a span, and then moved
gradually and slowly to the distance of the whole span. And yet the cone
and union of rays are the same; but the motion itself increases the
operation of the heat.</p></li>
<li><p>Fires which break out during a strong wind are thought to make
greater progress against than with it; because the flame recoils more
violently when the wind gives way than it advances while the wind is
driving it on.</p></li>
<li><p>Flame does not burst out, nor is it generated, unless some hollow
space be allowed it to move and play in; except the explosive flame of
gunpowder and the like, where compression and imprisonment increase its
fury.</p></li>
<li><p>An anvil grows very hot under the hammer, insomuch that if it
were made of a thin plate it might, I suppose, with strong and
continuous blows of the hammer, grow red like ignited iron. But let this
be tried by experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>But in ignited substances which are porous, so as to give the
fire room to move, if this motion be checked by strong compression, the
fire is immediately extinguished. For instance, when tinder, or the
burning wick of a candle or lamp, or even live charcoal or coal, is
pressed down with an extinguisher, or with the foot, or any similar
instrument, the operation of the fire instantly ceases.</p></li>
<li><p>Approximation to a hot body increases heat in proportion to the
degree of approximation. And this is the case also with light; for the
nearer an object is brought to the light, the more visible it
becomes.</p></li>
<li><p>The union of different heats increases heat, unless the hot
substances be mixed together. For a large fire and a small fire in the
same room increase one another’s heat; but warm water plunged into
boiling water cools it.</p></li>
<li><p>The continued application of a hot body increases heat, because
heat perpetually passing and emanating from it mingles with the
previously existing heat, and so multiplies the heat. For a fire does
not warm a room as well in half an hour as it does if continued through
the whole hour. But this is not the case with light; for a lamp or
candle gives no more light after it has been long lighted than it did at
first.</p></li>
<li><p>Irritation by surrounding cold increases heat, as you may see in
fires during a sharp frost. And this I think is owing not merely to the
confinement and contraction of the heat, which is a kind of union, but
also to irritation. Thus, when air or a stick is violently compressed or
bent, it recoils not merely to the point it was forced from, but beyond
it on the other side. Let trial therefore be carefully made by putting a
stick or some such thing into flame, and observing whether it is not
burnt more quickly at the sides than in the middle of the
flame.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many degrees in susceptibility of heat. And first of
all it is to be observed how slight and faint a heat changes and
somewhat warms even those bodies which are least of all susceptible of
heat. Even the heat of the hand communicates some heat to a ball of lead
or any metal, if held in it a little while. So readily and so
universally is heat transmitted and excited, the body remaining to all
appearance unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>Of all substances that we are acquainted with, the one which most
readily receives and loses heat is air; as is best seen in calendar
glasses [air thermoscopes], which are made thus. Take a glass with a
hollow belly, a thin and oblong neck; turn it upside down and lower it,
with the mouth downwards and the belly upwards, into another glass
vessel containing water; and let the mouth of the inserted vessel touch
the bottom of the receiving vessel and its neck lean slightly against
the mouth of the other, so that it can stand. And that this may be done
more conveniently, apply a little wax to the mouth of the receiving
glass, but not so as to seal its mouth quite up, in order that the
motion, of which we are going to speak, and which is very facile and
delicate, may not be impeded by want of a supply of air.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The lowered glass, before being inserted into the other, must be
heated before a fire in its upper part, that is its belly. Now when it
is placed in the position I have described, the air which was dilated by
the heat will, after a lapse of time sufficient to allow for the
extinction of that adventitious heat, withdraw and contract itself to
the same extension or dimension as that of the surrounding air at the
time of the immersion of the glass, and will draw the water upwards to a
corresponding height. To the side of the glass there should be affixed a
strip of paper, narrow and oblong, and marked with as many degrees as
you choose. You will then see, according as the day is warm or cold,
that the air contracts under the action of cold, and expands under the
action of heat; as will be seen by the water rising when the air
contracts, and sinking when it dilates. But the air’s sense of heat and
cold is so subtle and exquisite as far to exceed the perception of the
human touch, insomuch that a ray of sunshine, or the heat of the breath,
much more the heat of one’s hand placed on the top of the glass, will
cause the water immediately to sink in a perceptible degree. And yet I
think that animal spirits have a sense of heat and cold more exquisite
still, were it not that it is impeded and deadened by the grossness of
the body.</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><p>Next to air, I take those bodies to be most sensitive to heat
which have been recently changed and compressed by cold, as snow and
ice; for they begin to dissolve and melt with any gentle heat. Next to
them, perhaps, comes quicksilver. After that follow greasy substances,
as oil, butter, and the like; then comes wood; then water; and lastly
stones and metals, which are slow to heat, especially in the inside.
These, however, when once they have acquired heat retain it very long;
in so much that an ignited brick, stone, or piece of iron, when plunged
into a basin of water, will remain for a quarter of an hour, or
thereabouts, so hot that you cannot touch it.</p></li>
<li><p>The less the mass of a body, the sooner is it heated by the
approach of a hot body; which shows that all heat of which we have
experience is in some sort opposed to tangible matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Heat, as far as regards the sense and touch of man, is a thing
various and relative; insomuch that tepid water feels hot if the hand be
cold, but cold if the hand be hot.</p></li>
