<ol type="1">
<li><p>For the method of tradition, I see it hath moved a controversy in
our time. But as in civil business, if there be a meeting, and men fall
at words, there is commonly an end of the matter for that time, and no
proceeding at all; so in learning, where there is much controversy,
there is many times little inquiry. For this part of knowledge of method
seemeth to me so weakly inquired as I shall report it
deficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Method hath been placed, and that not amiss, in logic, as a part
of judgment. For as the doctrine of syllogisms comprehendeth the rules
of judgment upon that which is invented, so the doctrine of method
containeth the rules of judgment upon that which is to be delivered; for
judgment precedeth delivery, as it followeth invention. Neither is the
method or the nature of the tradition material only to the use of
knowledge, but likewise to the progression of knowledge: for since the
labour and life of one man cannot attain to perfection of knowledge, the
wisdom of the tradition is that which inspireth the felicity of
continuance and proceeding. And therefore the most real diversity of
method is of method referred to use, and method referred to progression:
whereof the one may be termed magistral, and the other of
probation.</p></li>
<li><p>The latter whereof seemeth to be via deserta et interclusa. For
as knowledges are now delivered, there is a kind of contract of error
between the deliverer and the receiver. For he that delivereth knowledge
desireth to deliver it in such form as may be best believed, and not as
may be best examined; and he that receiveth knowledge desireth rather
present satisfaction than expectant inquiry; and so rather not to doubt,
than not to err: glory making the author not to lay open his weakness,
and sloth making the disciple not to know his strength.</p></li>
<li><p>But knowledge that is delivered as a thread to be spun on ought
to be delivered and intimated, if it were possible, in the same method
wherein it was invented: and so is it possible of knowledge induced. But
in this same anticipated and prevented knowledge, no man knoweth how he
came to the knowledge which he hath obtained. But yet, nevertheless,
secundum majus et minus, a man may revisit and descend unto the
foundations of his knowledge and consent; and so transplant it into
another, as it grew in his own mind. For it is in knowledges as it is in
plants: if you mean to use the plant, it is no matter for the roots —
but if you mean to remove it to grow, then it is more assured to rest
upon roots than slips: so the delivery of knowledges (as it is now used)
is as of fair bodies of trees without the roots; good for the carpenter,
but not for the planter. But if you will have sciences grow, it is less
matter for the shaft or body of the tree, so you look well to the taking
up of the roots. Of which kind of delivery the method of the
mathematics, in that subject, hath some shadow: but generally I see it
neither put in use nor put in inquisition, and therefore note it for
deficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Another diversity of method there is, which hath some affinity
with the former, used in some cases by the discretion of the ancients,
but disgraced since by the impostures of many vain persons, who have
made it as a false light for their counterfeit merchandises; and that is
enigmatical and disclosed. The pretence whereof is, to remove the vulgar
capacities from being admitted to the secrets of knowledges, and to
reserve them to selected auditors, or wits of such sharpness as can
pierce the veil.</p></li>
<li><p>Another diversity of method, whereof the consequence is great, is
the delivery of knowledge in aphorisms, or in methods; wherein we may
observe that it hath been too much taken into custom, out of a few
axioms or observations upon any subject, to make a solemn and formal
art, filling it with some discourses, and illustrating it with examples,
and digesting it into a sensible method. But the writing in aphorisms
hath many excellent virtues, whereto the writing in method doth not
approach.</p></li>
<li><p>For first, it trieth the writer, whether he be superficial or
solid: for aphorisms, except they should be ridiculous, cannot be made
but of the pith and heart of sciences; for discourse of illustration is
cut off; recitals of examples are cut off; discourse of connection and
order is cut off; descriptions of practice are cut off. So there
remaineth nothing to fill the aphorisms but some good quantity of
observation; and therefore no man can suffice, nor in reason will
attempt, to write aphorisms, but he that is sound and grounded. But in
methods,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Tantum series juncturaque pollet,</p>
<p>Tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris,”</p>
<p>as a man shall make a great show of an art, which, if it were
disjointed, would come to little. Secondly, methods are more fit to win
consent or belief, but less fit to point to action; for they carry a
kind of demonstration in orb or circle, one part illuminating another,
and therefore satisfy. But particulars being dispersed do best agree
with dispersed directions. And lastly, aphorisms, representing a
knowledge broken, do invite men to inquire further; whereas methods,
carrying the show of a total, do secure men, as if they were at
furthest.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>Another diversity of method, which is likewise of great weight,
is the handling of knowledge by assertions and their proofs, or by
questions and their determinations. The latter kind whereof, if it be
immoderately followed, is as prejudicial to the proceeding of learning
as it is to the proceeding of an army to go about to besiege every
little fort or hold. For if the field be kept, and the sum of the
enterprise pursued, those smaller things will come in of themselves:
indeed a man would not leave some important piece enemy at his back. In
like manner, the use of confutation in the delivery of sciences ought to
be very sparing; and to serve to remove strong preoccupations and
prejudgments, and not to minister and excite disputatious and
doubts.</p></li>
<li><p>Another diversity of method is, according to the subject or
matter which is handled. For there is a great difference in delivery of
the mathematics, which are the most abstracted of knowledges, and
policy, which is the most immersed. And howsoever contention hath been
moved, touching a uniformity of method in multiformity of matter, yet we
see how that opinion, besides the weakness of it, hath been of ill
desert towards learning, as that which taketh the way to reduce learning
to certain empty and barren generalities; being but the very husks and
shells of sciences, all the kernel being forced out and expulsed with
the torture and press of the method. And, therefore, as I did allow well
of particular topics for invention, so I do allow likewise of particular
methods of tradition.</p></li>
<li><p>Another diversity of judgment in the delivery and teaching of
knowledge is, according unto the light and presuppositions of that which
is delivered. For that knowledge which is new, and foreign from opinions
received, is to be delivered in another form than that that is agreeable
and familiar; and therefore Aristotle, when he thinks to tax Democritus,
doth in truth commend him, where he saith “If we shall indeed dispute,
and not follow after similitudes,” andandandandc. For those whose
conceits are seated in popular opinions need only but to prove or
dispute; but those whose conceits are beyond popular opinions, have a
double labour; the one to make themselves conceived, and the other to
prove and demonstrate. So that it is of necessity with them to have
recourse to similitudes and translations to express themselves. And
therefore in the infancy of learning, and in rude times when those
conceits which are now trivial were then new, the world was full of
parables and similitudes; for else would men either have passed over
without mark, or else rejected for paradoxes that which was offered,
before they had understood or judged. So in divine learning, we see how
frequent parables and tropes are, for it is a rule, that whatsoever
science is not consonant to presuppositions must pray in aid of
similitudes.</p></li>
<li><p>There be also other diversities of methods vulgar and received:
as that of resolution or analysis, of constitution or systasis, of
concealment or cryptic, andandandandc., which I do allow well of, though
I have stood upon those which are least handled and observed. All which
I have remembered to this purpose, because I would erect and constitute
one general inquiry (which seems to me deficient) touching the wisdom of
tradition.</p></li>
<li><p>But unto this part of knowledge, concerning method, doth further
belong not only the architecture of the whole frame of a work, but also
the several beams and columns thereof; not as to their stuff, but as to
their quantity and figure. And therefore method considereth not only the
disposition of the argument or subject, but likewise the propositions:
not as to their truth or matter, but as to their limitation and manner.
For herein Ramus merited better a great deal in reviving the good rules
of propositions —?a????? p??t??,??ta pa?t?? andandandandc. — than he did
in introducing the canker of epitomes; and yet (as it is the condition
of human things that, according to the ancient fables, “the most
precious things have the most pernicious keepers”) it was so, that the
attempt of the one made him fall upon the other. For he had need be well
conducted that should design to make axioms convertible, if he make them
not withal circular, and non-promovent, or incurring into themselves;
but yet the intention was excellent.</p></li>
<li><p>The other considerations of method, concerning propositions, are
chiefly touching the utmost propositions, which limit the dimensions of
sciences: for every knowledge may be fitly said, besides the profundity
(which is the truth and substance of it, that makes it solid), to have a
longitude and a latitude; accounting the latitude towards other
sciences, and the longitude towards action; that is, from the greatest
generality to the most particular precept. The one giveth rule how far
one knowledge ought to intermeddle within the province of another, which
is the rule they call?a?a?t?; the other giveth rule unto what degree of
particularity a knowledge should descend: which latter I find passed
over in silence, being in my judgment the more material. For certainty
there must be somewhat left to practice; but how much is worthy the
inquiry? We see remote and superficial generalities do but offer
knowledge to scorn of practical men; and are no more aiding to practice
than an Ortelius’ universal map is to direct the way between London and
York. The better sort of rules have been not unfitly compared to glasses
of steel unpolished, where you may see the images of things, but first
they must be filed: so the rules will help if they be laboured and
polished by practice. But how crystalline they may be made at the first,
and how far forth they may be polished aforehand, is the question, the
inquiry whereof seemeth to me deficient.</p></li>
<li><p>There hath been also laboured and put in practice a method, which
is not a lawful method, but a method of imposture: which is, to deliver
knowledges in such manner as men may speedily come to make a show of
learning, who have it not. Such was the travail of Raymundus Lullius in
making that art which bears his name; not unlike to some books of
typocosmy, which have been made since; being nothing but a mass of words
of all arts, to give men countenance, that those which use the terms
might be thought to understand the art; which collections are much like
a fripper’s or broker’s shop, that hath ends of everything, but nothing
of worth.</p></li>
