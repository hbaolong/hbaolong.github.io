<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>“What does it matter whether the immortal works were written by
Shakespeare (of Stratford) or by another man who bore (or assumed) the
same name?”</p>
<p>Some twenty years ago, when this question was first propounded, it
was deemed an excellent joke, and I find that there still are a great
number of persons who seem unable to perceive that the question is one
of considerable importance.</p>
<p>When the Shakespeare revival came, some eighty or ninety years ago,
people said “pretty well for Shakespeare” and the “learned” men of that
period were rather ashamed that Shakespeare should be deemed to be “the”
English poet.</p>
<p>“Three poets in three distant ages born,</p>
<p>Greece, Italy and England did adorn,</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>The force of Nature could no further go,</p>
<p>To make a third she joined the other two.”</p>
<p>Dryden did not write these lines in reference to Shakespeare but to
Milton. Where will you find the person who to-day thinks Milton comes
within any measurable distance of the greatest genius among the sons of
earth who was called by the name of Shakespeare?</p>
<p>Ninety-two years ago, viz.: in June 1818, an article appeared in
Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, under the heading “Time’s Magic Lantern.
No. V. Dialogue between Lord Bacon and Shakspeare” [Shakespeare being
spelled Shakspeare]. The dialogue speaks of “Lord” Bacon and refers to
him as being engaged in transcribing the “Novum Organum” when Shakspeare
enters with a letter from Her Majesty (meaning Queen Elizabeth) asking
him, Shakspeare, to see “her own” sonnets now in the keeping of her Lord
Chancellor.</p>
<p>Of course this is all topsy turvydom, for in Queen Elizabeth’s
reign</p>
<p>Bacon was never “Lord” Bacon or Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p>But to continue, Shakspeare tells Bacon “Near to Castalia there
bubbles also a fountain of petrifying water, wherein the muses are wont
to dip whatever posies have met the approval of Apollo; so that the
slender foliage which originally sprung forth in the cherishing brain of
a true poet becomes hardened in all its leaves and glitters as if it
were carved out of rubies and emeralds. The elements have afterwards no
power over it.”</p>
<p>Bacon. Such will be the fortune of your own productions.</p>
<p>Shakspeare. Ah my Lord! Do not encourage me to hope so. I am but a
poor unlettered man, who seizes whatever rude conceits his own natural
vein supplies him with, upon the enforcement of haste and necessity; and
therefore I fear that such as are of deeper studies than myself, will
find many flaws in my handiwork to laugh at both now and hereafter.</p>
<p>Bacon. He that can make the multitude laugh and weep as you do
Mr. Shakspeare need not fear scholars…. More scholarship might have
sharpened your judgment but the particulars whereof a character is
composed are better assembled by force of imagination than of
judgment….</p>
<p>Shakspeare. My Lord thus far I know, that the first glimpse and
conception of a character in my mind, is always engendered by chance and
accident. We shall suppose, for instance, that I, sitting in a tap-room,
or standing in a tennis court. The behaviour of some one fixes my
attention…. Thus comes forth Shallow, and Slender, and Mercutio, and Sir
Andrew Aguecheek.</p>
<p>Bacon. These are characters who may be found alive in the streets.
But how frame you such interlocutors as Brutus and Coriolanus?</p>
<p>Shakspeare. By searching histories, in the first place, my Lord, for
the germ. The filling up afterwards comes rather from feeling than
observation. I turn myself into a Brutus or a Coriolanus for the time;
and can, at least in fancy, partake sufficiently of the nobleness of
their nature, to put proper words in their mouths…. My knowledge of the
tongues is but small, on which account I have read ancient authors
mostly at secondhand. I remember, when I first came to London, and began
to be a hanger-on at the theatres, a great desire grew in me for more
learning than had fallen to my share at Stratford; but fickleness and
impatience, and the bewilderment caused by new objects, dispersed that
wish into empty air….</p>
<p>This ridiculous and most absurd nonsense, which appeared in 1818 in
Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine was deemed so excellent and so
instructive that (slightly abridged) it was copied into “Reading lessons
for the use of public and private schools” by John Pierpont, of Boston,
U.S.A., which was published in London nearly twenty years later, viz.,
in 1837.</p>
<p>As I said before, the dialogue is really all topsy turvydom, for the
writer must have known perfectly well that Bacon was not Lord Keeper
till 1617, the year after Shakspeare’s death in 1616, and was not made
Lord Chancellor till 1618, and that he is not supposed to have began to
write the “Novum Organum” before the death of Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I have therefore arrived at the conclusion that the whole article was
really intended to poke fun at the generally received notion that the
author of the plays was an unlettered man, who picked up his knowledge
at tavern doors and in taprooms and tennis courts. I would specially
refer to the passage where Bacon asks “How frame you such interlocutors
as Brutus and Coriolanus?” and Shakspeare replies “By searching
histories, in the first place, my Lord, for the germ. The filling up
afterwards comes rather from feeling than observation. I turn myself
into a Brutus or a Coriolanus for the time and can at least in fancy
partake sufficiently of the nobleness of their nature to put proper
words in their mouths.”</p>
<p>Surely this also must have been penned to open the eyes of the public
to the absurdity of the popular conception of the author of the plays as
an unlettered man who “had small Latin and less Greek”!</p>
<p>The highest scholarship not only in this country and in Germany but
throughout the world has been for many years concentrated upon the
classical characters portrayed in the plays, and the adverse criticism
of former days has given place to a reverential admiration for the
marvellous knowledge of antiquity displayed throughout the plays in the
presentation of the historical characters of bygone times; classical
authority being found for nearly every word put into their mouths.</p>
<p>What does it matter whether the immortal works were written by
Shakspeare (of Stratford) or by a great and learned man who assumed the
name Shakespeare to “Shake a lance at Ignorance”? We should not forget
that this phrase “Shake a lance at Ignorance” is contemporary, appearing
in Ben Jonson’s panegyric in the Shakespeare folio of 1623.</p>
