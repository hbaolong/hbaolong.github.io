XII. IS IT PROBABLE THAT BACON LEFT MANUSCRIPTS HIDDEN AWAY?</h4>
<p>It is difficult to leave this subject without some reference to the
articles which have appeared in the press and magazines referring to the
suggestion that there were left concealed literary remains of Bacon
hitherto undiscovered.</p>
<p>In an article which recently appeared in a Shakespearean journal, a
writer who evidently knows little about the Elizabethan period said:
“But why should Bacon want to bury manuscripts, anyhow? Who does bury
manuscripts? Besides, they had been printed and were, therefore, rubbish
and waste paper merely.” The manuscript of John Harrington’s translation
of Ariosto’s “Orlando Furioso” may be seen in the British Museum. It is
beautifully written on quarto paper. It was, apparently, the fair copy
sent to the printer from which the type was to be set up. Be this as it
may, it was undoubtedly a copy upon which Bacon marked off the verses
which are to go on each page and set out the folio of each page and the
printer’s signature which was to appear at the bottom. It also contains
instructions to the printer as to the type to be used. This manuscript
was not considered “rubbish and waste paper merely.”</p>
<p>Francis Bacon has again and again insisted upon the value of history.
In the “Advancement of Learning” he points out to the King “the
indignity and unworthiness of the history of England as it now is, in
the main continuation thereof.” No man appreciated as did Bacon the
importance in the history of England of the epoch in which he lived.
That a truthful relation of the events of those times would be
invaluable to posterity he knew full well. He of all men living at that
time was best qualified to write such a history. He recognised that
there were objections to a history being written, or, at any rate,
published, wherein the actions of persons living were described, for he
said “it must be confessed that such kind of relations, specially if
they be published about the times of things done, seeing very often that
they are written with passion or partiality, of all other narrations,
are most suspected.” It is hardly conceivable that Bacon should have
failed to provide a faithful history of his own times for the benefit of
posterity, or, at any rate, that he should have failed to preserve the
materials for such a history. Neither the history nor such materials are
known to be in existence. Supposing Bacon had prepared either the one or
the other, what could he do with it? Hand it to Rawley with instructions
for it to be printed? With a strong probability, if it were a faithful
history, that it would never be published, but that it would be
destroyed, he would never take such a risk. There would only be one
course open to him. To conceal it in some place where it would not be
likely to be disturbed, in which it might remain in safety, possibly for
hundreds of years. And then leave a clue either in cypher or otherwise
by which it might be recovered.</p>
<p>It is by no means outside the range of possibility that Bacon as
early as 1588 had opened a receptacle for books and manuscripts which he
desired should go down to posterity, and fearing their loss from any
cause, he carefully concealed them, adding to the store from time to
time. If he did so he left a problem to be solved, and arranged the
place of concealment so that it could only be found by a solution of the
problem.</p>
<p>The emblems on two title-pages of two books of the period are very
significant. “Truth brought to Light and discovered by Time” is a
narrative history of the first fourteen years of King James’ reign. One
portion of the engraved title-page represents a spreading tree growing
up out of a coffin, full fraught with various fruits (manuscripts and
books) most fresh and fair to make succeeding times most rich and rare.
In the Emblem (Fig. III.) now reproduced, which is found on the
title-page of the first edition of “New Atlantis,” 1627,30 Truth
personified by a naked woman is being revealed by Father Time, and the
inscription round the device is “Tempore patet occulta veritas — in time
the hidden truth shall be revealed.”</p>
<p>Then, in further confirmation of this view, there is the statement of
Rawley in his introduction to the “Manes Verulamiani.” Speaking of the
fame of his illustrious master he says, “Be this moreover enough, to
have laid, as it were, the foundations, in the name of the present age.
Every age will, methinks, adorn and amplify this structure, but to what
age it may be vouchsafed to set the finishing hand — this is known only
to God and the Fates.”</p>
