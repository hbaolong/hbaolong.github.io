<h4 id="chapter-iv.">CHAPTER IV.</h4>
<p>BACON SOLICITOR-GENERAL.</p>
<p>The great thinker and idealist, the great seer of a world of
knowledge to which the men of his own generation were blind, and which
they could not, even with his help, imagine a possible one, had now won
the first step in that long and toilsome ascent to success in life, in
which for fourteen years he had been baffled. He had made himself, for
good and for evil, a servant of the Government of James I. He was
prepared to discharge with zeal and care all his duties. He was prepared
to perform all the services which that Government might claim from its
servants. He had sought, he had passionately pressed to be admitted
within that circle in which the will of the King was the supreme law;
after that, it would have been ruin to have withdrawn or resisted. But
it does not appear that the thought or wish to resist or withdraw ever
presented itself; he had thoroughly convinced himself that in doing what
the King required he was doing the part of a good citizen, and a
faithful servant of the State and Commonwealth. The two lives, the two
currents of purpose and effort, were still there. Behind all the wrangle
of the courts and the devising of questionable legal subtleties to
support some unconstitutional encroachment, or to outflank the defence
of some obnoxious prisoner, the high philosophical meditations still
went on; the remembrance of their sweetness and grandeur wrung more than
once from the jaded lawyer or the baffled counsellor the complaint, in
words which had a great charm for him, Multum incola fuit anima mea— “My
soul hath long dwelt” where it would not be. But opinion and ambition
and the immense convenience of being great and rich and powerful, and
the supposed necessities of his condition, were too strong even for his
longings to be the interpreter and the servant of nature. There is no
trace of the faintest reluctance on his part to be the willing minister
of a court of which not only the principal figure, but the arbiter and
governing spirit, was to be George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.</p>
<p>The first leisure that Bacon had after he was appointed Solicitor he
used in a characteristic way. He sat down to make a minute stock-taking
of his position and its circumstances. In the summer of 1608 he devoted
a week of July to this survey of his life, its objects and its
appliances; and he jotted down, day by day, through the week, from his
present reflections, or he transcribed from former note-books, a series
of notes in loose order, mostly very rough and not always intelligible,
about everything that could now concern him. This curious and intimate
record, which he called Commentarius Solutus, was discovered by
Mr. Spedding, who not unnaturally had some misgivings about publishing
so secret and so ambiguous a record of a man’s most private confidences
with himself. But there it was, and, as it was known, he no doubt
decided wisely in publishing it as it stands; he has done his best to
make it intelligible, and he has also done his best to remove any
unfavourable impressions that might arise from it. It is singularly
interesting as an evidence of Bacon’s way of working, of his
watchfulness, his industry, his care in preparing himself long
beforehand for possible occasions, his readiness to take any amount of
trouble about his present duties, his self-reliant desire for more
important and difficult ones. It exhibits his habit of self-observation
and self-correction, his care to mend his natural defects of voice,
manner, and delivery; it is even more curious in showing him watching
his own physical constitution and health, in the most minute details of
symptoms and remedies, equally with a scientific and a practical object.
It contains his estimate of his income, his expenditure, his debts,
schedules of lands and jewels, his rules for the economy of his estate,
his plans for his new gardens and terraces and ponds and buildings at
Gorhambury. He was now a rich man, valuing his property at £24,155 and
his income at £4975, burdened with a considerable debt, but not more
than he might easily look to wipe out. But, besides all these points,
there appear the two large interests of his life — the reform of
philosophy, and his ideal of a great national policy. The “greatness of
Britain” was one of his favourite subjects of meditation. He puts down
in his notes the outline of what should be aimed at to secure and
increase it; it is to make the various forces of the great and growing
empire work together in harmonious order, without waste, without
jealousy, without encroachment and collision; to unite not only the
interests but the sympathies and aims of the Crown with those of the
people and Parliament; and so to make Britain, now in peril from nothing
but from the strength of its own discordant elements, that “Monarchy of
the West” in reality, which Spain was in show, and, as Bacon always
maintained, only in show. The survey of the condition of his
philosophical enterprise takes more space. He notes the stages and
points to which his plans have reached; he indicates, with a favourite
quotation or apophthegm— “Plus ultra”— “ausus vana contemnere”— “aditus
non nisi sub persona infantis” soon to be familiar to the world in his
published writings — the lines of argument, sometimes alternative ones,
which were before him; he draws out schemes of inquiry, specimen tables,
distinctions and classifications about the subject of Motion, in English
interlarded with Latin, or in Latin interlarded with English, of his
characteristic and practical sort; he notes the various sources from
which he might look for help and co-operation— “of learned men beyond
the seas”— “to begin first in France to print it”— “laying for a place
to command wits and pens;” he has his eye on rich and childless bishops,
on the enforced idleness of State prisoners in the Tower, like
Northumberland and Raleigh, on the great schools and universities, where
he might perhaps get hold of some college for “Inventors” — as we should
say, for the endowment of research. These matters fill up a large space
of his notes. But his thoughts were also busy about his own advancement.
And to these sheets of miscellaneous memoranda Bacon confided not only
his occupations and his philosophical and political ideas, but, with a
curious innocent unreserve, the arts and methods which he proposed to
use in order to win the favour of the great and to pull down the
reputation of his rivals. He puts down in detail how he is to recommend
himself to the King and the King’s favourites —</p>
<p>“To set on foot and maintain access with his Majesty, Dean of the
Chapel, May, Murray. Keeping a course of access at the beginning of
every term and vacation, with a memorial. To attend some time his
repasts, or to fall into a course of familiar discourse. To find means
to win a conceit, not open, but private, of being affectionate and
assured to the Scotch, and fit to succeed Salisbury in his manage in
that kind; Lord Dunbar, Duke of Lennox, and Daubiny: secret.”</p>
<p>Then, again, of Salisbury —</p>
<p>“Insinuate myself to become privy to my Lord of Salisbury’s estate.”
“To correspond with Salisbury in a habit of natural but no ways perilous
boldness, and in vivacity, invention, care to cast and enterprise (but
with due caution), for this manner I judge both in his nature freeth the
stands, and in his ends pleaseth him best, and promiseth more use of me.
I judge my standing out, and not favoured by Northampton, must needs do
me good with Salisbury, especially comparative to the Attorney.”</p>
<p>The Attorney Hobart filled the place to which Bacon had so long
aspired, and which he thought, perhaps reasonably, that he could fill
much better. At any rate, one of the points to which he recurs
frequently in his notes is to exhort himself to make his own service a
continual contrast to the Attorney’s— “to have in mind and use the
Attorney’s weakness,” enumerating a list of instances: “Too full of
cases and distinctions. Nibbling solemnly, he distinguisheth but
apprehends not;” “No gift with his pen in proclamations and the like;”
and at last he draws out in a series of epigrams his view of “Hubbard’s
disadvantages” —</p>
<p>“Better at shift than at drift…. Subtilitas sine acrimonia…. No power
with the judge…. He will alter a thing but not mend…. He puts into
patents and deeds words not of law but of common sense and discourse….
Sociable save in profit…. He doth depopulate mine office; otherwise
called inclose…. I never knew any one of so good a speech with a worse
pen.” …</p>
<p>Then in a marginal note— “Solemn goose. Stately, leastwise nodd (?)
crafty. They have made him believe that he is wondrous wise.” And,
finally, he draws up a paper of counsels and rules for his own conduct—
“Custumæ aptæ ad Individuum” — which might supply an outline for an
essay on the arts of behaviour proper for a rising official, a sequel to
the biting irony of the essays on Cunning and Wisdom for a Man’s
Self.</p>
<p>“To furnish my L. of S. with ornaments for public speeches. To make
him think how he should be reverenced by a Lord Chancellor, if I were;
Princelike.</p>
<p>“To prepare him for matters to be handled in Council or before the
King aforehand, and to show him and yield him the fruits of my care.</p>
<p>“To take notes in tables, when I attend the Council, and sometimes to
move out of a memorial shewed and seen. To have particular occasions,
fit and graceful and continual, to maintain private speech with every
the great persons, and sometimes drawing more than one together. Ex
imitatione Att. This specially in public places, and without care or
affectation. At Council table to make good my L. of Salisb. motions and
speeches, and for the rest sometimes one sometimes another; chiefly his,
that is most earnest and in affection.</p>
<p>“To suppress at once my speaking, with panting and labour of breath
and voice. Not to fall upon the main too sudden, but to induce and
intermingle speech of good fashion. To use at once upon entrance given
of speech, though abrupt, to compose and draw in myself. To free myself
at once from payt. (?) of formality and compliment, though with some
show of carelessness, pride, and rudeness.”</p>
<p>(And then follows a long list of matters of business to be attended
to.)</p>
<p>These arts of a court were not new; it was not new for men to observe
them in their neighbours and rivals. What was new was the writing them
down, with deliberate candour, among a man’s private memoranda, as
things to be done and with the intention of practising them. This of
itself, it has been suggested, shows that they were unfamiliar and
uncongenial to Bacon; for a man reminds himself of what he is apt to
forget. But a man reminds himself also of what seems to him, at the
moment, most important, and what he lays most stress upon. And it is
clear that these are the rules, rhetorical and ethical, which Bacon laid
down for himself in pursuing the second great object of his life — his
official advancement; and that, whatever we think of them, they were the
means which he deliberately approved.</p>
<p>As long as Salisbury lived, the distrust which had kept Bacon so long
in the shade kept him at a distance from the King’s ear, and from
influence on his counsels. Salisbury was the one Englishman in whom the
King had become accustomed to confide, in his own conscious strangeness
to English ways and real dislike and suspicion of them; Salisbury had an
authority which no one else had, both from his relations with James at
the end of Elizabeth’s reign, and as the representative of her policy
and the depositary of its traditions; and if he had lived, things might
not, perhaps, have been better in James’s government, but many things,
probably, would have been different. But while Salisbury was supreme,
Bacon, though very alert and zealous, was mainly busied with his
official work; and the Solicitor’s place had become, as he says, a “mean
thing” compared with the Attorney’s, and also an extremely laborious
place— “one of the painfullest places in the kingdom.” Much of it was
routine, but responsible and fatiguing routine. But if he was not in
Salisbury’s confidence, he was prominent in the House of Commons. The
great and pressing subject of the time was the increasing difficulties
of the revenue, created partly by the inevitable changes of a growing
state, but much more by the King’s incorrigible wastefulness. It was
impossible to realise completely the great dream and longing of the
Stuart kings and their ministers to make the Crown independent of
parliamentary supplies; but to dispense with these supplies as much as
possible, and to make as much as possible of the revenue permanent, was
the continued and fatal policy of the Court. The “Great Contract” — a
scheme by which, in return for the surrender by the Crown of certain
burdensome and dangerous claims of the Prerogative, the Commons were to
assure a large compensating yearly income to the Crown — was Salisbury’s
favourite device during the last two years of his life. It was not a
prosperous one. The bargain was an ill-imagined and not very decorous
transaction between the King and his people. Both parties were naturally
jealous of one another, suspicious of underhand dealing and tacit
changes of terms, prompt to resent and take offence, and not easy to
pacify when they thought advantage had been taken; and Salisbury, either
by his own fault, or by yielding to the King’s canny shiftiness, gave
the business a more haggling and huckstering look than it need have had.
Bacon, a subordinate of the Government, but a very important person in
the Commons, did his part, loyally, as it seems, and skilfully in
smoothing differences and keeping awkward questions from making their
appearance. Thus he tried to stave off the risk of bringing definitely
to a point the King’s cherished claim to levy “impositions,” or custom
duties, on merchandise, by virtue of his prerogative — a claim which he
warned the Commons not to dispute, and which Bacon, maintaining it as
legal in theory, did his best to prevent them from discussing, and to
persuade them to be content with restraining. Whatever he thought of the
“Great Contract,” he did what was expected of him in trying to gain for
it fair play. But he made time for other things also. He advised, and
advised soundly, on the plantation and finance of Ireland. It was a
subject in which he took deep interest. A few years later, with only too
sure a foresight, he gave the warning, “lest Ireland civil become more
dangerous to us than Ireland savage.” He advised — not soundly in point
of law, but curiously in accordance with modern notions — about
endowments; though, in this instance, in the famous will case of Thomas
Sutton, the founder of the Charter House, his argument probably covered
the scheme of a monstrous job in favour of the needy Court. And his own
work went on in spite of the pressure of the Solicitor’s place. To the
first years of his official life belong three very interesting
fragments, intended to find a provisional place in the plan of the
“Great Instauration.” To his friend Toby Matthews, at Florence, he sent
in manuscript the great attack on the old teachers of knowledge, which
is perhaps the most brilliant, and also the most insolently unjust and
unthinking piece of rhetoric ever composed by him — the Redargutio
Philosophiarum.</p>
<p>“I send you at this time the only part which hath any harshness; and
yet I framed to myself an opinion, that whosoever allowed well of that
preface which you so much commend, will not dislike, or at least ought
not to dislike, this other speech of preparation; for it is written out
of the same spirit, and out of the same necessity. Nay it doth more
fully lay open that the question between me and the ancients is not of
the virtue of the race, but of the rightness of the way. And to speak
truth, it is to the other but as palma to pugnus, part of the same thing
more large…. Myself am like the miller of Huntingdon, that was wont to
pray for peace amongst the willows; for while the winds blew, the
wind-mills wrought, and the water-mill was less customed. So I see that
controversies of religion must hinder the advancement of sciences. Let
me conclude with my perpetual wish towards yourself, that the
approbation of yourself by your own discreet and temperate carriage, may
restore you to your country, and your friends to your society. And so I
commend you to God’s goodness.</p>
<p>“Gray’s Inn, this 10th of October, 1609.”</p>
<p>To Bishop Andrewes he sent, also in manuscript, another piece,
belonging to the same plan — the deeply impressive treatise called Visa
et Cogitata — what Francis Bacon had seen of nature and knowledge, and
what he had come by meditation to think of what he had seen. The letter
is not less interesting than the last, in respect to the writer’s
purposes, his manner of writing, and his relations to his
correspondent.</p>
<p>“MY VERY GOOD LORD, — Now your Lordship hath been so long in the
church and the palace disputing between kings and popes, methinks you
should take pleasure to look into the field, and refresh your mind with
some matter of philosophy, though that science be now through age waxed
a child again, and left to boys and young men; and because you were wont
to make me believe you took liking to my writings, I send you some of
this vacation’s fruits, and thus much more of my mind and purpose. I
hasten not to publish; perishing I would prevent. And I am forced to
respect as well my times as the matter. For with me it is thus, and I
think with all men in my case, if I bind myself to an argument, it
loadeth my mind; but if I rid my mind of the present cogitation, it is
rather a recreation. This hath put me into these miscellanies, which I
purpose to suppress, if God give me leave to write a just and perfect
volume of philosophy, which I go on with, though slowly. I send not your
Lordship too much, lest it may glut you. Now let me tell you what my
desire is. If your Lordship be so good now as when you were the good
Dean of Westminster, my request to you is, that not by pricks, but by
notes, you would mark unto me whatsoever shall seem unto you either not
current in the style, or harsh to credit and opinion, or inconvenient
for the person of the writer; for no man can be judge and party, and
when our minds judge by reflection of ourselves, they are more subject
to error. And though for the matter itself my judgement be in some
things fixed, and not accessible by any man’s judgement that goeth not
my way, yet even in those things the admonition of a friend may make me
express myself diversly. I would have come to your Lordship, but that I
am hastening to my house in the country. And so I commend your Lordship
to God’s goodness.”</p>
<p>There was yet another production of this time, of which we have a
notice from himself in a letter to Toby Matthews, the curious and
ingenious little treatise on the Wisdom of the Ancients, “one of the
most popular of his works,” says Mr. Spedding, “in his own and in the
next generation,” but of value to us mainly for its quaint poetical
colour, and the unexpected turns, like answers to a riddle, given to the
ancient fables. When this work was published, it was the third time that
he had appeared as an author in print. He thus writes about it and
himself:</p>
<p>“MR. MATTHEWS, — I do heartily thank you for your letter of the 24th
of August from Salamanca; and in recompense thereof I send you a little
work of mine that hath begun to pass the world. They tell me my Latin is
turned into silver, and become current. Had you been here, you should
have been my inquisitor before it came forth; but I think the greatest
inquisitor in Spain will allow it…. My great work goeth forward, and,
after my manner, I alter ever when I add. So that nothing is finished
till all be finished.</p>
<p>“From Gray’s Inn, the 17th of February, 1610.”</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1611 the Attorney-General was ill, and Bacon
reminded both the King and Salisbury of his claim. He was afraid, he
writes to the King, with an odd forgetfulness of the persistency and
earnestness of his applications, “that by reason of my slowness to sue,
and apprehend occasions upon the sudden, keeping one plain course of
painful service, I may in fine dierum be in danger to be neglected and
forgotten.” The Attorney recovered, but Bacon, on New Year’s Tide of
1611/12, wrote to Salisbury to thank him for his good-will. It is the
last letter of Bacon’s to Salisbury which has come down to us.</p>
<p>“IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP, — I would entreat the new year to
answer for the old, in my humble thanks to your Lordship, both for many
your favours, and chiefly that upon the occasion of Mr. Attorney’s
infirmity I found your Lordship even as I would wish. This doth increase
a desire in me to express my thankful mind to your Lordship; hoping that
though I find age and decays grow upon me, yet I may have a flash or two
of spirit left to do you service. And I do protest before God, without
compliment or any light vein of mind, that if I knew in what course of
life to do you best service, I would take it, and make my thoughts,
which now fly to many pieces, be reduced to that center. But all this is
no more than I am, which is not much, but yet the entire of him that
is—”</p>
<p>In the following May (May 24, 1612) Salisbury died. From this date
James passed from government by a minister, who, whatever may have been
his faults, was laborious, public-spirited, and a statesman, into his
own keeping and into the hands of favourites, who cared only for
themselves. With Cecil ceased the traditions of the days of Elizabeth
and Burghley, in many ways evil and cruel traditions, but not ignoble
and sordid ones; and James was left without the stay, and also without
the check, which Cecil’s power had been to him. The field was open for
new men and new ways; the fashions and ideas of the time had altered
during the last ten years, and those of the Queen’s days had gone out of
date. Would the new turn out for the better or the worse? Bacon, at any
rate, saw the significance of the change and the critical eventfulness
of the moment. It was his habit of old to send memorials of advice to
the heads of the Government, apparently without such suggestions seeming
more intrusive or officious than a leading article seems now, and
perhaps with much the same effect. It was now a time to do so, if ever;
and he was in an official relation to the King which entitled him to
proffer advice. He at once prepared to lay his thoughts before the King,
and to suggest that he could do far better service than Cecil, and was
ready to take his place. The policy of the “Great Contract” had
certainly broken down, and the King, under Cecil’s guidance, had
certainly not known how to manage an English parliament. In writing to
the King he found it hard to satisfy himself. Several draft letters
remain, and it is not certain which of them, if any, was sent. But
immediately on Salisbury’s death he began, May 29th, a letter in which
he said that he had never yet been able to show his affection to the
King, “having been as a hawk tied to another’s fist;” and if, “as was
said to one that spake great words, Amice, verba tua desiderant
civitatem, your Majesty say to me, Bacon, your words require a place to
speak them,” yet that “place or not place” was with the King. But the
draft breaks off abruptly, and with the date of the 31st we have the
following:</p>
<p>“Your Majesty hath lost a great subject and a great servant. But if I
should praise him in propriety, I should say that he was a fit man to
keep things from growing worse, but no very fit man to reduce things to
be much better. For he loved to have the eyes of all Israel a little too
much upon himself, and to have all business still under the hammer, and
like clay in the hands of the potter, to mould it as he thought good; so
that he was more in operatione than in opere. And though he had fine
passages of action, yet the real conclusions came slowly on. So that
although your Majesty hath grave counsellors and worthy persons left,
yet you do as it were turn a leaf, wherein if your Majesty shall give a
frame and constitution to matters, before you place the persons, in my
simple opinion it were not amiss. But the great matter and most instant
for the present, is the consideration of a Parliament, for two effects:
the one for the supply of your estate, the other for the better knitting
of the hearts of your subjects unto your Majesty, according to your
infinite merit; for both which, Parliaments have been and are the
antient and honourable remedy.</p>
<p>“Now because I take myself to have a little skill in that region, as
one that ever affected that your Majesty mought in all your causes not
only prevail, but prevail with satisfaction of the inner man; and though
no man can say but I was a perfect and peremptory royalist, yet every
man makes me believe that I was never one hour out of credit with the
Lower House; my desire is to know whether your Majesty will give me
leave to meditate and propound unto you some preparative remembrances
touching the future Parliament.”</p>
<p>Whether he sent this or not, he prepared another draft. What had
happened in the mean while we know not, but Bacon was in a bitter mood,
and the letter reveals, for the first time, what was really in Bacon’s
heart about the “great subject and great servant,” of whom he had just
written so respectfully, and with whom he had been so closely connected
for most of his life. The fierceness which had been gathering for years
of neglect and hindrance under that placid and patient exterior broke
out. He offered himself as Cecil’s successor in business of State. He
gave his reason for being hopeful of success. Cecil’s bitterest enemy
could not have given it more bitterly.</p>
<p>“My principal end being to do your Majesty service, I crave leave to
make at this time to your Majesty this most humble oblation of myself. I
may truly say with the psalm, Multum incola fuit anima mea, for my life
hath been conversant in things wherein I take little pleasure. Your
Majesty may have heard somewhat that my father was an honest man, and
somewhat you may have seen of myself, though not to make any true
judgement by, because I have hitherto had only potestatem verborum, nor
that neither. I was three of my young years bred with an ambassador in
France, and since I have been an old truant in the school-house of your
council-chamber, though on the second form, yet longer than any that now
sitteth hath been upon the head form. If your Majesty find any aptness
in me, or if you find any scarcity in others, whereby you may think it
fit for your service to remove me to business of State, although I have
a fair way before me for profit (and by your Majesty’s grace and favour
for honour and advancement), and in a course less exposed to the blasts
of fortune, yet now that he is gone, quo vivente virtutibus certissimum
exitium, I will be ready as a chessman to be wherever your Majesty’s
royal hand shall set me. Your Majesty will bear me witness, I have not
suddenly opened myself thus far. I have looked upon others, I see the
exceptions, I see the distractions, and I fear Tacitus will be a
prophet, magis alii homines quam alii mores. I know mine own heart, and
I know not whether God that hath touched my heart with the affection may
not touch your royal heart to discern it. Howsoever, I shall at least go
on honestly in mine ordinary course, and supply the rest in prayers for
you, remaining, etc.”</p>
<p>This is no hasty outburst. In a later paper on the true way of
retrieving the disorders of the King’s finances, full of large and wise
counsel, after advising the King not to be impatient, and assuring him
that a state of debt is not so intolerable— “for it is no new thing for
the greatest Kings to be in debt,” and all the great men of the Court
had been in debt without any “manner of diminution of their greatness” —
he returns to the charge in detail against Salisbury and the Great
Contract.</p>
<p>“My second prayer is, that your Majesty — in respect to the hasty
freeing of your state — would not descend to any means, or degree of
means, which carrieth not a symmetry with your Majesty and greatness. He
is gone from whom those courses did wholly flow. To have your wants and
necessities in particular as it were hanged up in two tablets before the
eyes of your lords and commons, to be talked of for four months
together; To have all your courses to help yourself in revenue or profit
put into printed books, which were wont to be held arcana imperii; To
have such worms of aldermen to lend for ten in the hundred upon good
assurance, and with such entreaty (?) as if it should save the bark of
your fortune; To contract still where mought be had the readiest
payment, and not the best bargain; To stir a number of projects for your
profit, and then to blast them, and leave your Majesty nothing but the
scandal of them; To pretend even carriage between your Majesty’s rights
and ease of the people, and to satisfy neither. These courses and others
the like I hope are gone with the deviser of them; which have turned
your Majesty to inestimable prejudice.”</p>
<p>And what he thought of saying, but on further consideration struck
out, was the following. It is no wonder that he struck it out, but it
shows what he felt towards Cecil.</p>
<p>“I protest to God, though I be not superstitious, when I saw your
M.’s book against Vorstius and Arminius, and noted your zeal to deliver
the majesty of God from the vain and indign comprehensions of heresy and
degenerate philosophy, as you had by your pen formerly endeavoured to
deliver kings from the usurpation of Rome, perculsit illico animum that
God would set shortly upon you some visible favour, and let me not live
if I thought not of the taking away of that man.”</p>
<p>And from this time onwards he scarcely ever mentions Cecil’s name in
his correspondence with James but with words of condemnation, which
imply that Cecil’s mischievous policy was the result of private ends.
Yet this was the man to whom he had written the “New Year’s Tide” letter
six months before; a letter which is but an echo to the last of all that
he had been accustomed to write to Cecil when asking assistance or
offering congratulation. Cecil had, indeed, little claim on Bacon’s
gratitude; he had spoken him fair in public, and no doubt in secret
distrusted and thwarted him. But to the last Bacon did not choose to
acknowledge this. Had James disclosed something of his dead servant, who
left some strange secrets behind him, which showed his unsuspected
hostility to Bacon? Except on this supposition (but there is nothing to
support it), no exaggeration of the liberty allowed to the language of
compliment is enough to clear Bacon of an insincerity which is almost
inconceivable in any but the meanest tools of power.</p>
<p>“I assure myself,” wrote Bacon to the King, “your Majesty taketh not
me for one of a busy nature; for my estate being free from all
difficulties, and I having such a large field for contemplation, as I
have partly and shall much more make manifest unto your Majesty and the
world, to occupy my thoughts, nothing could make me active but love and
affection.” So Bacon described his position with questionable accuracy —
for his estate was not “free from difficulties” — in the new time
coming. He was still kept out of the inner circle of the Council; but
from the moment of Salisbury’s death he became a much more important
person. He still sued for advancement, and still met with
disappointment; the “mean men” still rose above him. The lucrative place
of Master of the Wards was vacated by Salisbury’s death. Bacon was
talked of for it, and probably expected it, for he drew up new rules for
it, and a speech for the new master; but the office and the speech went
to Sir George Carey. Soon after Sir George Carey died. Bacon then
applied for it through the new favourite, Rochester. “He was so
confident of the place that he put most of his men into new cloaks;” and
the world of the day amused itself at his disappointment, when the place
was given to another “mean man,” Sir Walter Cope, of whom the gossips
wrote that if the “last two Treasurers could look out of their graves to
see those successors in that place, they would be out of countenance
with themselves, and say to the world quantum mutatus.” But Bacon’s hand
and counsel appear more and more in important matters — the improvement
of the revenue; the defence of extreme rights of the prerogative in the
case against Whitelocke; the great question of calling a parliament, and
of the true and “princely” way of dealing with it. His confidential
advice to the King about calling a parliament was marked by his keen
perception of the facts of the situation; it was marked too by his
confident reliance on skilful indirect methods and trust in the look of
things; it bears traces also of his bitter feeling against Salisbury,
whom he charges with treacherously fomenting the opposition of the last
Parliament. There was no want of worldly wisdom in it; certainly it was
more adapted to James’s ideas of state-craft than the simpler plan of
Sir Henry Nevill, that the King should throw himself frankly on the
loyalty and good-will of Parliament. And thus he came to be on easy
terms with James, who was quite capable of understanding Bacon’s
resource and nimbleness of wit. In the autumn of 1613 the
Chief-Justiceship of the King’s Bench became vacant. Bacon at once gave
the King reasons for sending Coke from the Common Pleas — where he was a
check on the prerogative — to the King’s Bench, where he could do less
harm; while Hobart went to the Common Pleas. The promotion was obvious,
but the Common Pleas suited Coke better, and the place was more
lucrative. Bacon’s advice was followed. Coke, very reluctantly, knowing
well who had given it, and why, “not only weeping himself but followed
by the tears” of all the Court of Common Pleas, moved up to the higher
post. The Attorney Hobart succeeded, and Bacon at last became Attorney
(October 27, 1613). In Chamberlain’s gossip we have an indication, such
as occurs only accidentally, of the view of outsiders: “There is a
strong apprehension that little good is to be expected by this change,
and that Bacon may prove a dangerous instrument.”</p>
