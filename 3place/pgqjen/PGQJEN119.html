<p>Shackspere’s Correspondence!</p>
<p>There is only a single letter extant addressed to Shakspeare, and
this asks for a loan of £30 It is dated 25th October 1598, and is from
Richard Quiney. It reads</p>
<p>“Loveinge Countreyman I am bolde of vow as of a ffrende,</p>
<p>craveinge yowr helpe wth xxxll vppon mr Bushells andandandand my</p>
<p>securytee or mr Myttons wth me. mr Rosswell is nott come</p>

<p>ffrom the Bell in Carter Lane the 25 October 1598.</p>
<p>yowrs in all kyndenes</p>
<p>Ryc. Quyney</p>
<p>(addressed)</p>
<p>LS To my Loveinge good ffrend</p>
<p>andandandand contreymann mr wm</p>
<p>Shackespere d[e]l[ive]r thees.”</p>
<p>This letter is the only letter known to exist which was ever
addressed to William Shackspere, the illiterate householder of
Stratford, who as has been pointed out in these pages was totally unable
to read a line of print, or to write even his own name. There are
however in existence three, and three only, contemporary letters
referring in any way to him, and these are not about literature with
which the Stratford man had nothing whatever to do — but about mean and
sordid small business transactions.</p>
<p>One is from Master Abraham Sturley, who writes in 1598 to a friend in
London in reference to Shakspeare lending “Some monei on some od yarde
land or other att Shottri or neare about us.”</p>
<p>Another is dated Nov. 4th 1598, and is from the same Abraham Sturley
to Richard Quiney in which we are told that “our countriman Mr Wm Shak
would procure us monei wc I will like of.”</p>
<p>A third from Adrian Quiney written (about 1598-1599) to his son
Rycharde Quiney in which he says “yff yow bargen with Wm Sha or receve
money therfor, brynge youre money homme.”</p>
<p>There exists no contemporary letter from anyone to anyone, referring
to the Stratford actor as being a poet or as being in any way connected
with literature. But from the Court Records we learn that;</p>
<p>In 1600 Shakespeare brought action against John Clayton in London for
£7 and got judgment in his favour. He also sued Philip Rogers of
Stratford for two shillings loaned.</p>
<p>In 1604 he sued Philip Rogers for several bushels of malt sold to him
at various times between March 27th and the end of May of that year,
amounting in all to the value of £1. 15s. 10d. The poet a dealer in
malt?</p>
<p>In 1608 he prosecuted John Addenbroke to recover a debt of £6 and
sued his surety Horneby.</p>
<p>Halliwell-Phillipps tells us that “The precepts as appears from</p>
<p>memoranda in the originals, were issued by the poet’s solicitor
Thomas</p>
<p>Greene who was then residing under some unknown conditions3 at</p>
<p>New Place.”</p>
<p>Referring to these sordid stories, Richard Grant White, that strong
believer in the Stratford man, says in his “Life and genius of William
Shakespeare,” p. 156 “The pursuit of an impoverished man for the sake of
imprisoning him and depriving him both of the power of paying his debts
and supporting himself and his family, is an incident in Shakespeare’s
life which it requires the utmost allowance and consideration for the
practice of the time and country to enable us to contemplate with
equanimity — satisfaction is impossible.”</p>
<p>“The biographer of Shakespeare must record these facts because the
literary antiquaries have unearthed and brought them forward as new
particulars of the life of Shakespeare. We hunger and receive these
husks; we open our mouths for food and we break our teeth against these
stones.”</p>
<p>Yes! The world has broken its teeth too long upon these stones to
continue to mistake them for bread. And as the accomplished scholar and
poetess the late Miss Anna Swanwick once declared to the writer, she
knew nothing of the Bacon and Shakespeare controversy, but Mr. Sidney
Lee’s “Life of Shakespeare” had convinced her that his man never wrote
the plays. And that is just what everybody else is saying at Eton, at
Oxford, at Cambridge, in the Navy, in the Army, and pretty generally
among unprejudiced people everywhere, who are satisfied, as is Mark
Twain, that the most learned of works could not have been written by the
most unlearned of men.</p>
<p>Yes! It does matter that the “Greatest Birth of Time” should no
longer be considered to have been the work of the unlettered rustic of
Stratford; and the hour has at last come when it should be universally
known that this mighty work was written by the man who had taken all
knowledge for his province, the man who said “I have, though in a
despised weed [that is under a Pseudonym] procured the good of all men”;
the man who left his “name and memory to men’s charitable speeches, and
to foreign nations, and the next ages.”</p>
