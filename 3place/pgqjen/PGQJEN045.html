<h4 id="chapter-xviii">Chapter XVIII</h4>
<p>Diomed, or Zeal Explained of Persecution, or Zeal for Religion</p>
<p>DIOMED acquired great glory and honour at the Trojan war, and was
highly favoured by Pallas, who encouraged and excited him by no means to
spare Venus, if he should casually meet her in fight. He followed the
advice with too much eagerness and intrepidity, and accordingly wounded
that goddess in her hand. This presumptuous action remained unpunished
for a time, and when the war was ended he returned with great glory and
renown to his own country, where, finding himself embroiled with
domestic affairs, he retired into Italy. Here also at first he was well
received, and nobly entertained by King Daunus, who, besides other gifts
and honours, erected statues for him over all his dominions. But upon
the first calamity that afflicted the people after the stranger’s
arrival, Daunus immediately reflected that he entertained a devoted
person in his palace, an enemy to the gods, and one who had
sacrilegiously wounded a goddess with his sword, whom it was impious but
to touch. To expiate, therefore, his country’s guilt, he, without regard
to the laws of hospitality, which were less regarded by him than the
laws of religion, directly slew his guest, and commanded his statues and
all his honours to be razed and abolished. Nor was it safe for others to
commiserate or bewail so cruel a destiny; but even his companions in
arms, whilst they lamented the death of their leader, and filled all
places with their complaints were turned into a kind of swans, which are
said, at the approach of their own death, to chant sweet melancholy
dirges.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION. - This fable intimates an extraordinary and almost
singular thing for no hero besides Diomed is recorded to have wounded
any of the gods. Doubtless we have here described the nature and fate of
a man who professedly makes any divine worship or sect of religion,
though in itself vain and light, the only scope of his actions, and
resolves to propagate it by fire and sword. For although the bloody
dissensions and differences about religion were unknown to the ancients,
yet so copious and diffusive was their knowledge, that what they knew
not by experience they comprehended in thought and representation.
Those, therefore, who endeavour to reform or establish any sect of
religion, though vain, corrupt, and infamous (which is here denoted
under the person of Venus), not by the force of reason, learning,
sanctity of manners, the weight of arguments, and examples, but would
spread or extirpate it by persecution, pains, penalties, tortures, fire
and sword, may perhaps be instigated hereto by Pallas, that is, by a
certain rigid, prudential consideration, and a severity of judgment, by
the vigour and efficacy whereof they see thoroughly into the fallacies
and fictions of the delusions of this kind; and through aversion to
depravity and a well-meant zeal, these men usually for a time acquire
great fame and glory, and are by the vulgar, to whom no moderate
measures can be acceptable, extolled and almost adored, as the only
patrons and protectors of truth and religion, men of any other
disposition seeming, in comparison with these, to be lukewarm,
mean-spirited, and cowardly. This fame and felicity, however, seldom
endures to the end; but all violence, unless it escapes the reverses and
changes of things by untimely death, is commonly unprosperous in the
issue; and - if a change of affairs happens, and that sect of religion
which was persecuted and oppressed gains strength and rises again, then
the real and warm endeavours of this sort of men are condemned, their
very name becomes odious, and all their honours terminate in
disgrace.</p>
<p>As to the point that Diomed should be slain by his hospitable
entertainer, this denotes that religious dissensions may cause
treachery, bloody animosities, and deceit, even between the nearest
friends.</p>
<p>That complaining or bewailing should not, in so enormous a case, be
permitted to friends affected by the catastrophe without punishment,
includes this prudent admonition, that almost in all kinds of wickedness
and depravity men have still room left for commiseration, so that they
who hate the crime may yet pity the person and bewail his calamity, from
a principle of humanity and good nature; and to forbid the overflowings
and intercourses of pity upon such occasions were the extremest of
evils; yet in the cause of religion and impiety the very commiserations
of men are noted and suspected. On the other hand, the lamentations and
complainings of the followers and attendants of Diomed, that is, of men
of the same sect or persuasion, are usually very sweet, agreeable, and
moving, like the dying notes of swans, or the birds of Diomed. This also
is a noble and remarkable part of the allegory, denoting that the last
words of those who suffer for the sake of religion strongly affect and
sway men’s minds, and leave a lasting impression upon the sense and
memory.</p>
