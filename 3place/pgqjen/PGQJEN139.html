<h4 id="chapter-ii.">CHAPTER II.</h4>
<p>BACON AND ELIZABETH.</p>
<p>The last decade of the century, and almost of Elizabeth’s reign
(1590-1600), was an eventful one to Bacon’s fortunes. In it the vision
of his great design disclosed itself more and more to his imagination
and hopes, and with more and more irresistible fascination. In it he
made his first literary venture, the first edition of his Essays (1597),
ten in number, the first-fruits of his early and ever watchful
observation of men and affairs. These years, too, saw his first steps in
public life, the first efforts to bring him into importance, the first
great trials and tests of his character. They saw the beginning and they
saw the end of his relations with the only friend who, at that time,
recognised his genius and his purposes, certainly the only friend who
ever pushed his claims; they saw the growth of a friendship which was to
have so tragical a close, and they saw the beginnings and causes of a
bitter personal rivalry which was to last through life, and which was to
be a potent element hereafter in Bacon’s ruin. The friend was the Earl
of Essex. The competitor was the ablest, and also the most truculent and
unscrupulous of English lawyers, Edward Coke.</p>
<p>While Bacon, in the shade, had been laying the foundations of his
philosophy of nature, and vainly suing for legal or political
employment, another man had been steadily rising in the Queen’s favour
and carrying all before him at Court — Robert Devereux, Lord Essex; and
with Essex Bacon had formed an acquaintance which had ripened into an
intimate and affectionate friendship. We commonly think of Essex as a
vain and insolent favourite, who did ill the greatest work given him to
do — the reduction of Ireland; who did it ill from some unexplained
reason of spite and mischief; and who, when called to account for it,
broke out into senseless and idle rebellion. This was the end. But he
was not always thus. He began life with great gifts and noble ends; he
was a serious, modest, and large-minded student both of books and
things, and he turned his studies to full account. He had imagination
and love of enterprise, which gave him an insight into Bacon’s ideas
such as none of Bacon’s contemporaries had. He was a man of simple and
earnest religion; he sympathized most with the Puritans, because they
were serious and because they were hardly used. Those who most condemn
him acknowledge his nobleness and generosity of nature. Bacon in after
days, when all was over between them, spoke of him as a man always
patientissimus veri; “the more plainly and frankly you shall deal with
my lord,” he writes elsewhere, “not only in disclosing particulars, but
in giving him caveats and admonishing him of any error which in this
action he may commit (such is his lordship’s nature), the better he will
take it.” “He must have seemed,” says Mr. Spedding, a little too
grandly, “in the eyes of Bacon like the hope of the world.” The two men,
certainly, became warmly attached. Their friendship came to be one of
the closest kind, full of mutual services, and of genuine affection on
both sides. It was not the relation of a great patron and useful
dependant; it was, what might be expected in the two men, that of
affectionate equality. Each man was equally capable of seeing what the
other was, and saw it. What Essex’s feelings were towards Bacon the
results showed. Bacon, in after years, repeatedly claimed to have
devoted his whole time and labour to Essex’s service. Holding him, he
says, to be “the fittest instrument to do good to the State, I applied
myself to him in a manner which I think rarely happeneth among men;
neglecting the Queen’s service, mine own fortune, and, in a sort, my
vocation, I did nothing but advise and ruminate with myself … anything
that might concern his lordship’s honour, fortune, or service.” The
claim is far too wide. The “Queen’s service” had hardly as yet come much
in Bacon’s way, and he never neglected it when it did come, nor his own
fortune or vocation; his letters remain to attest his care in these
respects. But no doubt Bacon was then as ready to be of use to Essex,
the one man who seemed to understand and value him, as Essex was
desirous to be of use to Bacon.</p>
<p>And it seemed as if Essex would have the ability as well as the wish.
Essex was, without exception, the most brilliant man who ever appeared
at Elizabeth’s Court, and it seemed as if he were going to be the most
powerful. Leicester was dead. Burghley was growing old, and indisposed
for the adventures and levity which, with all her grand power of ruling,
Elizabeth loved. She needed a favourite, and Essex was unfortunately
marked out for what she wanted. He had Leicester’s fascination, without
his mean and cruel selfishness. He was as generous, as gallant, as quick
to descry all great things in art and life, as Philip Sidney, with more
vigour and fitness for active life than Sidney. He had not Raleigh’s
sad, dark depths of thought, but he had a daring courage equal to
Raleigh’s, without Raleigh’s cynical contempt for mercy and honour. He
had every personal advantage requisite for a time when intellect, and
ready wit, and high-tempered valour, and personal beauty, and skill in
affairs, with equal skill in amusements, were expected to go together in
the accomplished courtier. And Essex was a man not merely to be courted
and admired, to shine and dazzle, but to be loved. Elizabeth, with her
strange and perverse emotional constitution, loved him, if she ever
loved any one. Every one who served him loved him; and he was, as much
as any one could be in those days, a popular favourite. Under better
fortune he might have risen to a great height of character; in
Elizabeth’s Court he was fated to be ruined.</p>
<p>For in that Court all the qualities in him which needed control
received daily stimulus, and his ardour and high-aiming temper turned
into impatience and restless irritability. He had a mistress who was at
one time in the humour to be treated as a tender woman, at another as an
outrageous flirt, at another as the haughtiest and most imperious of
queens; her mood varied, no one could tell how, and it was most
dangerous to mistake it. It was part of her pleasure to find in her
favourite a spirit as high, a humour as contradictory and determined, as
her own; it was the charming contrast to the obsequiousness or the
prudence of the rest; but no one could be sure at what unlooked-for
moment, and how fiercely, she might resent in earnest a display of what
she had herself encouraged. Essex was ruined for all real greatness by
having to suit himself to this bewildering and most unwholesome and
degrading waywardness. She taught him to think himself irresistible in
opinion and in claims; she amused herself in teaching him how completely
he was mistaken. Alternately spoiled and crossed, he learned to be
exacting, unreasonable, absurd in his pettish resentments or brooding
sullenness. He learned to think that she must be dealt with by the same
methods which she herself employed. The effect was not produced in a
moment; it was the result of a courtiership of sixteen years. But it
ended in corrupting a noble nature. Essex came to believe that she who
cowed others must be frightened herself; that the stinging injustice
which led a proud man to expect, only to see how he would behave when
refused, deserved to be brought to reason by a counter-buffet as rough
as her own insolent caprice. He drifted into discontent, into
disaffection, into neglect of duty, into questionable schemings for the
future of a reign that must shortly end, into criminal methods of
guarding himself, of humbling his rivals and regaining influence. A
“fatal impatience,” as Bacon calls it, gave his rivals an advantage
which, perhaps in self-defence, they could not fail to take; and that
career, so brilliant, so full of promise of good, ended in misery, in
dishonour, in remorse, on the scaffold of the Tower.</p>
<p>With this attractive and powerful person Bacon’s fortunes, in the
last years of the century, became more and more knit up. Bacon was now
past thirty, Essex a few years younger. In spite of Bacon’s apparent
advantage and interest at Court, in spite of abilities, which, though
his genius was not yet known, his contemporaries clearly recognised, he
was still a struggling and unsuccessful man: ambitious to rise, for no
unworthy reasons, but needy, in weak health, with careless and expensive
habits, and embarrassed with debt. He had hoped to rise by the favour of
the Queen and for the sake of his father. For some ill-explained reason
he was to the last disappointed. Though she used him “for matters of
state and revenue,” she either did not like him, or did not see in him
the servant she wanted to advance. He went on to the last pressing his
uncle, Lord Burghley. He applied in the humblest terms, he made himself
useful with his pen, he got his mother to write for him; but Lord
Burghley, probably because he thought his nephew more of a man of
letters than a sound lawyer and practical public servant, did not care
to bring him forward. From his cousin, Robert Cecil, Bacon received
polite words and friendly assurances. Cecil may have undervalued him, or
have been jealous of him, or suspected him as a friend of Essex; he
certainly gave Bacon good reason to think that his words meant nothing.
Except Essex, and perhaps his brother Antony — the most affectionate and
devoted of brothers — no one had yet recognised all that Bacon was.
Meanwhile time was passing. The vastness, the difficulties, the
attractions of that conquest of all knowledge which he dreamed of, were
becoming greater every day to his thoughts. The law, without which he
could not live, took up time and brought in little. Attendance on the
Court was expensive, yet indispensable, if he wished for place. His
mother was never very friendly, and thought him absurd and extravagant.
Debts increased and creditors grumbled. The outlook was discouraging,
when his friendship with Essex opened to him a more hopeful
prospect.</p>
<p>In the year 1593 the Attorney-General’s place was vacant, and Essex,
who in that year became a Privy Councillor, determined that Bacon should
be Attorney-General. Bacon’s reputation as a lawyer was overshadowed by
his philosophical and literary pursuits. He was thought young for the
office, and he had not yet served in any subordinate place. And there
was another man, who was supposed to carry all English law in his head,
full of rude force and endless precedents, hard of heart and voluble of
tongue, who also wanted it. An Attorney-General was one who would bring
all the resources and hidden subtleties of English law to the service of
the Crown, and use them with thorough-going and unflinching resolution
against those whom the Crown accused of treason, sedition, or invasion
of the prerogative. It is no wonder that the Cecils, and the Queen
herself, thought Coke likely to be a more useful public servant than
Bacon: it is certain what Coke himself thought about it, and what his
estimate was of the man whom Essex was pushing against him. But Essex
did not take up his friend’s cause in the lukewarm fashion in which
Burghley had patronised his nephew. There was nothing that Essex pursued
with greater pertinacity. He importuned the Queen. He risked without
scruple offending her. She apparently long shrank from directly refusing
his request. The Cecils were for Coke — the “Huddler” as Bacon calls
him, in a letter to Essex; but the appointment was delayed. All through
1593, and until April, 1594, the struggle went on.</p>
<p>When Robert Cecil suggested that Essex should be content with the
Solicitor’s place for Bacon, “praying him to be well advised, for if his
Lordship had spoken of that it might have been of easier digestion to
the Queen,” he turned round on Cecil —</p>
<p>“Digest me no digesting,” said the Earl; “for the Attorneyship is
that I must have for Francis Bacon; and in that I will spend my
uttermost credit, friendship, and authority against whomsoever, and that
whosoever went about to procure it to others, that it should cost both
the mediators and the suitors the setting on before they came by it. And
this be you assured of, Sir Robert,” quoth the Earl, “for now do I fully
declare myself; and for your own part, Sir Robert, I do think much and
strange both of my Lord your father and you, that can have the mind to
seek the preferment of a stranger before so near a kinsman; namely,
considering if you weigh in a balance his parts and sufficiency in any
respect with those of his competitor, excepting only four poor years of
admittance, which Francis Bacon hath more than recompensed with the
priority of his reading; in all other respects you shall find no
comparison between them.”</p>
<p>But the Queen’s disgust at some very slight show of independence on
Bacon’s part in Parliament, unforgiven in spite of repeated apologies,
together with the influence of the Cecils and the pressure of so
formidable and so useful a man as Coke, turned the scale against Essex.
In April, 1594, Coke was made Attorney. Coke did not forget the
pretender to law, as he would think him, who had dared so long to
dispute his claims; and Bacon was deeply wounded. “No man,” he thought,
“had ever received a more exquisite disgrace,” and he spoke of retiring
to Cambridge “to spend the rest of his life in his studies and
contemplations.” But Essex was not discouraged. He next pressed eagerly
for the Solicitorship. Again, after much waiting, he was foiled. An
inferior man was put over Bacon’s head. Bacon found that Essex, who
could do most things, for some reason could not do this. He himself,
too, had pressed his suit with the greatest importunity on the Queen, on
Burghley, on Cecil, on every one who could help him; he reminded the
Queen how many years ago it was since he first kissed her hand in her
service, and ever since had used his wits to please; but it was all in
vain. For once he lost patience. He was angry with Essex; the Queen’s
anger with Essex had, he thought, recoiled on his friend. He was angry
with the Queen; she held his long waiting cheap; she played with him and
amused herself with delay; he would go abroad, and he “knew her
Majesty’s nature, that she neither careth though the whole surname of
the Bacons travelled, nor of the Cecils neither.” He was very angry with
Robert Cecil; affecting not to believe them, he tells him stories he has
heard of his corrupt and underhand dealing. He writes almost a farewell
letter of ceremonious but ambiguous thanks to Lord Burghley, hoping that
he would impute any offence that Bacon might have given to the
“complexion of a suitor, and a tired sea-sick suitor,” and speaking
despairingly of his future success in the law. The humiliations of what
a suitor has to go through torment him: “It is my luck,” he writes to
Cecil, “still to be akin to such things as I neither like in nature nor
would willingly meet with in my course, but yet cannot avoid without
show of base timorousness or else of unkind or suspicious strangeness.”
And to his friend Fulke Greville he thus unburdens himself:</p>
<p>“SIR, — I understand of your pains to have visited me, for which I
thank you. My matter is an endless question. I assure you I had said
Requiesce anima mea; but I now am otherwise put to my psalter; Nolite
confidere. I dare go no further. Her Majesty had by set speech more than
once assured me of her intention to call me to her service, which I
could not understand but of the place I had been named to. And now
whether invidus homo hoc fecit; or whether my matter must be an appendix
to my Lord of Essex suit; or whether her Majesty, pretending to prove my
ability, meaneth but to take advantage of some errors which, like
enough, at one time or other I may commit; or what is it? but her
Majesty is not ready to despatch it. And what though the Master of the
Rolls, and my Lord of Essex, and yourself, and others, think my case
without doubt, yet in the meantime I have a hard condition, to stand so
that whatsoever service I do to her Majesty it shall be thought to be
but servitium viscatum, lime-twigs and fetches to place myself; and so I
shall have envy, not thanks. This is a course to quench all good
spirits, and to corrupt every man’s nature, which will, I fear, much
hurt her Majesty’s service in the end. I have been like a piece of stuff
bespoken in the shop; and if her Majesty will not take me, it may be the
selling by parcels will be more gainful. For to be, as I told you, like
a child following a bird, which when he is nearest flieth away and
lighteth a little before, and then the child after it again, and so in
infinitum, I am weary of it; as also of wearying my good friends, of
whom, nevertheless, I hope in one course or other gratefully to deserve.
And so, not forgetting your business, I leave to trouble you with this
idle letter; being but justa et moderata querimonia; for indeed I do
confess, primus amor will not easily be cast off. And thus again I
commend me to you.”</p>
<p>After one more effort the chase was given up, at least for the
moment; for it was soon resumed. But just now Bacon felt that all the
world was against him. He would retire “out of the sunshine into the
shade.” One friend only encouraged him. He did more. He helped him when
Bacon most wanted help, in his straitened and embarrassed “estate.”
Essex, when he could do nothing more, gave Bacon an estate worth at
least £1800. Bacon’s resolution is recorded in the following letter:</p>
<p>“IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP, — I pray God her Majesty’s
weighing be not like the weight of a balance, gravia deorsum levia
sursum. But I am as far from being altered in devotion towards her, as I
am from distrust that she will be altered in opinion towards me, when
she knoweth me better. For myself, I have lost some opinion, some time,
and some means; this is my account; but then for opinion, it is a blast
that goeth and cometh; for time, it is true it goeth and cometh not; but
yet I have learned that it may be redeemed. For means, I value that
most; and the rather, because I am purposed not to follow the practice
of the law (if her Majesty command me in any particular, I shall be
ready to do her willing service); and my reason is only, because it
drinketh too much time, which I have dedicated to better purposes. But
even for that point of estate and means, I partly lean to Thales’
opinion, That a philosopher may be rich if he will. Thus your Lordship
seeth how I comfort myself; to the increase whereof I would fain please
myself to believe that to be true which my Lord Treasurer writeth; which
is, that it is more than a philosopher morally can disgest. But without
any such high conceit, I esteem it like the pulling out of an aching
tooth, which, I remember, when I was a child, and had little philosophy,
I was glad of when it was done. For your Lordship, I do think myself
more beholding to you than to any man. And I say, I reckon myself as a
common (not popular but common); and as much as is lawful to be enclosed
of a common, so much your Lordship shall be sure to have. — Your
Lordship’s to obey your honourable commands, more settled than
ever.”</p>
<p>It may be that, as Bacon afterwards maintained, the closing sentences
of this letter implied a significant reserve of his devotion. But during
the brilliant and stormy years of Essex’s career which followed, Bacon’s
relations to him continued unaltered. Essex pressed Bacon’s claims
whenever a chance offered. He did his best to get Bacon a rich wife —
the young widow of Sir Christopher Hatton — but in vain. Instead of
Bacon she accepted Coke, and became famous afterwards in the great
family quarrel, in which Coke and Bacon again found themselves face to
face, and which nearly ruined Bacon before the time. Bacon worked for
Essex when he was wanted, and gave the advice which a shrewd and
cautious friend would give to a man who, by his success and increasing
pride and self-confidence, was running into serious dangers, arming
against himself deadly foes, and exposing himself to the chances of
fortune. Bacon was nervous about Essex’s capacity for war, a capacity
which perhaps was not proved, even by the most brilliant exploit of the
time, the capture of Cadiz, in which Essex foreshadowed the heroic but
well-calculated audacities of Nelson and Cochrane, and showed himself as
little able as they to bear the intoxication of success, and to work in
concert with envious and unfriendly associates. At the end of the year
1596, the year in which Essex had won such reputation at Cadiz, Bacon
wrote him a letter of advice and remonstrance. It is a lively picture of
the defects and dangers of Essex’s behaviour as the Queen’s favourite;
and it is a most characteristic and worldly-wise summary of the ways
which Bacon would have him take, to cure the one and escape the other.
Bacon had, as he says, “good reason to think that the Earl’s fortune
comprehended his own.” And the letter may perhaps be taken as an
indirect warning to Essex that Bacon must, at any rate, take care of his
own fortune, if the Earl persisted in dangerous courses. Bacon shows how
he is to remove the impressions, strong in the Queen’s mind, of Essex’s
defects; how he is, by due submissions and stratagems, to catch her
humour —</p>
<p>“But whether I counsel you the best, or for the best, duty bindeth me
to offer to you my wishes. I said to your Lordship last time, Martha,
Martha, attendis ad plurima, unum sufficit; win the Queen: if this be
not the beginning, of any other course I see no end.”</p>
<p>Bacon gives a series of minute directions how Essex is to disarm the
Queen’s suspicions, and to neutralize the advantage which his rivals
take of them; how he is to remove “the opinion of his nature being
opiniastre and not rulable;” how, avoiding the faults of Leicester and
Hatton, he is, as far as he can, to “allege them for authors and
patterns.” Especially, he must give up that show of soldier-like
distinction, which the Queen so disliked, and take some quiet post at
Court. He must not alarm the Queen by seeking popularity; he must take
care of his estate; he must get rid of some of his officers; and he must
not be disquieted by other favourites.</p>
<p>Bacon wished, as he said afterwards, to see him “with a white staff
in his hand, as my Lord of Leicester had,” an honour and ornament to the
Court in the eyes of the people and foreign ambassadors. But Essex was
not fit for the part which Bacon urged upon him, that of an obsequious
and vigilant observer of the Queen’s moods and humours. As time went on,
things became more and more difficult between him and his strange
mistress; and there were never wanting men who, like Cecil and Raleigh,
for good and bad reasons, feared and hated Essex, and who had the craft
and the skill to make the most of his inexcusable errors. At last he
allowed himself, from ambition, from the spirit of contradiction, from
the blind passion for doing what he thought would show defiance to his
enemies, to be tempted into the Irish campaign of 1599. Bacon at a later
time claimed credit for having foreseen and foretold its issue. “I did
as plainly see his overthrow, chained as it were by destiny to that
journey, as it is possible for any man to ground a judgment on future
contingents.” He warned Essex, so he thought in after years, of the
difficulty of the work; he warned him that he would leave the Queen in
the hands of his enemies: “It would be ill for her, ill for him, ill for
the State.” “I am sure,” he adds, “I never in anything in my life dealt
with him in like earnestness by speech, by writing, and by all the means
I could devise.” But Bacon’s memory was mistaken. We have his letters.
When Essex went to Ireland, Bacon wrote only in the language of sanguine
hope — so little did he see “overthrow chained by destiny to that
journey,” that “some good spirit led his pen to presage to his Lordship
success;” he saw in the enterprise a great occasion of honour to his
friend; he gave prudent counsels, but he looked forward confidently to
Essex being as “fatal a captain to that war, as Africanus was to the war
of Carthage.” Indeed, however anxious he may have been, he could not
have foreseen Essex’s unaccountable and to this day unintelligible
failure. But failure was the end, from whatever cause; failure,
disgraceful and complete. Then followed wild and guilty but abortive
projects for retrieving his failure, by using his power in Ireland to
make himself formidable to his enemies at Court, and even to the Queen
herself. He intrigued with Tyrone; he intrigued with James of Scotland;
he plunged into a whirl of angry and baseless projects, which came to
nothing the moment they were discussed. How empty and idle they were was
shown by his return against orders to tell his own story at Nonsuch, and
by thus placing himself alone and undeniably in the wrong, in the power
of the hostile Council. Of course it was not to be thought of that Cecil
should not use his advantage in the game. It was too early, irritated
though the Queen was, to strike the final blow. But it is impossible not
to see, looking back over the miserable history, that Essex was treated
in a way which was certain, sooner or later, to make him, being what he
was, plunge into a fatal and irretrievable mistake. He was treated as a
cat treats a mouse; he was worried, confined, disgraced, publicly
reprimanded, brought just within verge of the charge of treason, but not
quite, just enough to discredit and alarm him, but to leave him still a
certain amount of play. He was made to see that the Queen’s favour was
not quite hopeless; but that nothing but the most absolute and
unreserved humiliation could recover it. It was plain to any one who
knew Essex that this treatment would drive Essex to madness. “These same
gradations of yours” — so Bacon represents himself expostulating with
the Queen on her caprices— “are fitter to corrupt than to correct any
mind of greatness.” They made Essex desperate; he became frightened for
his life, and he had reason to be so, though not in the way which he
feared. At length came the stupid and ridiculous outbreak of the 8th of
February, 1600/1601, a plot to seize the palace and raise the city
against the ministers, by the help of a few gentlemen armed only with
their rapiers. As Bacon himself told the Queen, “if some base and
cruel-minded persons had entered into such an action, it might have
caused much blow and combustion; but it appeared well that they were
such as knew not how to play the malefactors!” But it was sufficient to
bring Essex within the doom of treason.</p>
<p>Essex knew well what the stake was. He lost it, and deserved to lose
it, little as his enemies deserved to win it; for they, too, were doing
what would have cost them their heads if Elizabeth had known it —
corresponding, as Essex was accused of doing, with Scotland about the
succession, and possibly with Spain. But they were playing cautiously
and craftily; he with bungling passion. He had been so long accustomed
to power and place, that he could not endure that rivals should keep him
out of it. They were content to have their own way, while affecting to
be the humblest of servants; he would be nothing less than a Mayor of
the Palace. He was guilty of a great public crime, as every man is who
appeals to arms for anything short of the most sacred cause. He was
bringing into England, which had settled down into peaceable ways, an
imitation of the violent methods of France and the Guises. But the crime
as well as the penalty belonged to the age, and crimes legally said to
be against the State mean morally very different things, according to
the state of society and opinion. It is an unfairness verging on the
ridiculous, when the ground is elaborately laid for keeping up the
impression that Essex was preparing a real treason against the Queen
like that of Norfolk. It was a treason of the same sort and order as
that for which Northumberland sent Somerset to the block: the treason of
being an unsuccessful rival.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bacon had been getting gradually into the unofficial employ
of the Government. He had become one of the “Learned Counsel” — lawyers
with subordinate and intermittent work, used when wanted, but without
patent or salary, and not ranking with the regular law officers. The
Government had found him useful in affairs of the revenue, in framing
interrogatories for prisoners in the Tower, in drawing up reports of
plots against the Queen. He did not in this way earn enough to support
himself; but he had thus come to have some degree of access to the
Queen, which he represents as being familiar and confidential, though he
still perceived, as he says himself, that she did not like him. At the
first news of Essex’s return to England, Bacon greeted him —</p>
<p>“MY LORD, — Conceiving that your Lordship came now up in the person
of a good servant to see your sovereign mistress, which kind of
compliments are many times instar magnorum meritorum, and therefore it
would be hard for me to find you, I have committed to this poor paper
the humble salutations of him that is more yours than any man’s, and
more yours than any man. To these salutations I add a due and joyful
gratulation, confessing that your Lordship, in your last conference with
me before your journey, spake not in vain, God making it good, That you
trusted we should say Quis putasset! Which as it is found true in a
happy sense, so I wish you do not find another Quis putasset in the
manner of taking this so great a service. But I hope it is, as he said,
Nubecula est, cito transibit, and that your Lordship’s wisdom and
obsequious circumspection and patience will turn all to the best. So
referring all to some time that I may attend you, I commit you to God’s
best preservation.”</p>
<p>But when Essex’s conduct in Ireland had to be dealt with, Bacon’s
services were called for; and from this time his relations towards Essex
were altered. Every one, no one better than the Queen herself, knew all
that he owed to Essex. It is strangely illustrative of the time, that
especially as Bacon held so subordinate a position, he should have been
required, and should have been trusted, to act against his only and most
generous benefactor. It is strange, too, that however great his loyalty
to the Queen, however much and sincerely he might condemn his friend’s
conduct, he should think it possible to accept the task. He says that he
made some remonstrance; and he says, no doubt truly, that during the
first stage of the business he used the ambiguous position in which he
was placed to soften Essex’s inevitable punishment, and to bring about a
reconciliation between him and the Queen. But he was required, as the
Queen’s lawyer, to set forth in public Essex’s offences; and he admits
that he did so “not over tenderly.” Yet all this, even if we have
misgivings about it, is intelligible. If he had declined, he could not,
perhaps, have done the service which he assures us that he tried to do
for Essex; and it is certain that he would have had to reckon with the
terrible lady who in her old age still ruled England from the throne of
Henry VIII., and who had certainly no great love for Bacon himself. She
had already shown him in a much smaller matter what was the forfeit to
be paid for any resistance to her will. All the hopes of his life must
perish; all the grudging and suspicious favours which he had won with
such unremitting toil and patient waiting would be sacrificed, and he
would henceforth live under the wrath of those who never forgave. And
whatever he did for himself, he believed that he was serving Essex. His
scheming imagination and his indefatigable pen were at work. He tried
strange indirect methods; he invented a correspondence between his
brother and Essex, which was to fall into the Queen’s hands in order to
soften her wrath and show her Essex’s most secret feelings. When the
Queen proposed to dine with him at his lodge in Twickenham Park, “though
I profess not to be a poet,” he “prepared a sonnet tending and alluding
to draw on her Majesty’s reconcilement to my Lord.” It was an awkward
thing for one who had been so intimate with Essex to be so deep in the
counsels of those who hated him. He complains that many people thought
him ungrateful and disloyal to his friend, and that stories circulated
to his disadvantage, as if he were poisoning the Queen’s ear against
Essex. But he might argue fairly enough that, wilful and wrong-headed as
Essex had been, it was the best that he could now do for him; and as
long as it was only a question of Essex’s disgrace and enforced absence
from Court, Bacon could not be bound to give up the prospects of his
life — indeed, his public duty as a subordinate servant of government —
on account of his friend’s inexcusable and dangerous follies. Essex did
not see it so, and in the subjoined correspondence had the advantage;
but Bacon’s position, though a higher one might be imagined, where men
had been such friends as these two men had been, is quite a defensible
one:</p>
<p>“MY LORD, — No man can better expound my doings than your Lordship,
which maketh me need to say the less. Only I humbly pray you to believe
that I aspire to the conscience and commendation first of bonus civis,
which with us is a good and true servant to the Queen, and next of bonus
vir, that is an honest man. I desire your Lordship also to think that
though I confess I love some things much better than I love your
Lordship — as the Queen’s service, her quiet and contentment, her
honour, her favour, the good of my country, and the like — yet I love
few persons better than yourself, both for gratitude’s sake and for your
own virtues, which cannot hurt but by accident or abuse. Of which my
good affection I was ever ready and am ready to yield testimony by any
good offices, but with such reservations as yourself cannot but allow;
for as I was ever sorry that your Lordship should fly with waxen wings,
doubting Icarus’s fortune, so for the growing up of your own feathers,
specially ostrich’s, or any other save of a bird of prey, no man shall
be more glad. And this is the axletree whereupon I have turned and shall
turn, which to signify to you, though I think you are of yourself
persuaded as much, is the cause of my writing; and so I commend your
Lordship to God’s goodness. From Gray’s Inn, this 20th day of July,
1600.</p>
<p>“Your Lordship’s most humbly,</p>
<p>“FR. BACON.”</p>
<p>To this letter Essex returned an answer of dignified reserve, such as
Bacon might himself have dictated —</p>
<p>“MR. BACON, — I can neither expound nor censure your late actions,
being ignorant of all of them, save one, and having directed my sight
inward only, to examine myself. You do pray me to believe that you only
aspire to the conscience and commendation of bonus civis and bonus vir;
and I do faithfully assure you, that while that is your ambition (though
your course be active and mine contemplative), yet we shall both
convenire in codem tertio and convenire inter nosipsos. Your profession
of affection and offer of good offices are welcome to me. For answer to
them I will say but this, that you have believed I have been kind to
you, and you may believe that I cannot be other, either upon humour or
my own election. I am a stranger to all poetical conceits, or else I
should say somewhat of your poetical example. But this I must say, that
I never flew with other wings than desire to merit and confidence in my
Sovereign’s favour; and when one of these wings failed me I would light
nowhere but at my Sovereign’s feet, though she suffered me to be bruised
with my fall. And till her Majesty, that knows I was never bird of prey,
finds it to agree with her will and her service that my wings should be
imped again, I have committed myself to the mire. No power but my God’s
and my Sovereign’s can alter this resolution of</p>
<p>“Your retired friend,</p>
<p>“ESSEX.”</p>
<p>But after Essex’s mad attempt in the city a new state of things
arose. The inevitable result was a trial for high treason, a trial of
which no one could doubt the purpose and end. The examination of
accomplices revealed speeches, proposals, projects, not very
intelligible to us in the still imperfectly understood game of intrigue
that was going on among all parties at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, but
quite enough to place Essex at the mercy of the Government and the
offended Queen. “The new information,” says Mr. Spedding, “had been
immediately communicated to Coke and Bacon.” Coke, as Attorney-General,
of course conducted the prosecution; and the next prominent person on
the side of the Crown was not the Solicitor, or any other regular law
officer, but Bacon, though holding the very subordinate place of one of
the “Learned Counsel.”</p>
<p>It does not appear that he thought it strange, that he showed any
pain or reluctance, that he sought to be excused. He took it as a matter
of course. The part assigned to Bacon in the prosecution was as
important as that of Coke; and he played it more skilfully and
effectively. Trials in those days were confused affairs, often passing
into a mere wrangle between the judges, lawyers, and lookers-on, and the
prisoner at the bar. It was so in this case. Coke is said to have
blundered in his way of presenting the evidence, and to have been led
away from the point into an altercation with Essex. Probably it really
did not much matter; but the trial was getting out of its course and
inclining in favour of the prisoner, till Bacon — Mr. Spedding thinks,
out of his regular turn — stepped forward and retrieved matters. This is
Mr. Spedding’s account of what Bacon said and did:</p>
<p>“By this time the argument had drifted so far away from the point
that it must have been difficult for a listener to remember what it was
that the prisoners were charged with, or how much of the charge had been
proved. And Coke, who was all this time the sole speaker on behalf of
the Crown, was still following each fresh topic that rose before him,
without the sign of an intention or the intimation of a wish to return
to the main question and reform the broken ranks of his evidence.
Luckily he seems to have been now at a loss what point to take next, and
the pause gave Bacon an opportunity of rising. It can hardly have been
in pursuance of previous arrangements; for though it was customary in
those days to distribute the evidence into parts and to assign several
parts to several counsel, there had been no appearance as yet of any
part being concluded. It is probable that the course of the trial had
upset previous arrangements and confused the parts. At any rate so it
was, however it came to pass, that when Cecil and Essex had at last
finished their expostulation and parted with charitable prayers, each
that the other might be forgiven, then (says our reporter) Mr. Bacon
entered into a speech much after this fashion:</p>
<p>“‘In speaking of this late and horrible rebellion which hath been in
the eyes and ears of all men, I shall save myself much labour in opening
and enforcing the points thereof, insomuch as I speak not before a
country jury of ignorant men, but before a most honourable assembly of
the greatest Peers of the land, whose wisdoms conceive far more than my
tongue can utter; yet with your gracious and honourable favours I will
presume, if not for information of your Honours, yet for the discharge
of my duty, to say thus much. No man can be ignorant, that knows matters
of former ages — and all history makes it plain — that there was never
any traitor heard of that durst directly attempt the seat of his liege
prince but he always coloured his practices with some plausible
pretence. For God hath imprinted such a majesty in the face of a prince
that no private man dare approach the person of his sovereign with a
traitorous intent. And therefore they run another side course, oblique
et à latere: some to reform corruptions of the State and religion; some
to reduce the ancient liberties and customs pretended to be lost and
worn out; some to remove those persons that being in high places make
themselves subject to envy; but all of them aim at the overthrow of the
State and destruction of the present rulers. And this likewise is the
use of those that work mischief of another quality; as Cain, that first
murderer, took up an excuse for his fact, shaming to outface it with
impudency, thus the Earl made his colour the severing some great men and
councillors from her Majesty’s favour, and the fear he stood in of his
pretended enemies lest they should murder him in his house. Therefore he
saith he was compelled to fly into the City for succour and assistance;
not much unlike Pisistratus, of whom it was so anciently written how he
gashed and wounded himself, and in that sort ran crying into Athens that
his life was sought and like to have been taken away; thinking to have
moved the people to have pitied him and taken his part by such
counterfeited harm and danger; whereas his aim and drift was to take the
government of the city into his hands and alter the form thereof. With
like pretences of dangers and assaults the Earl of Essex entered the
City of London and passed through the bowels thereof, blanching rumours
that he should have been murdered and that the State was sold; whereas
he had no such enemies, no such dangers: persuading themselves that if
they could prevail all would have done well. But now magna scelera
terminantur in hæresin; for you, my Lord, should know that though
princes give their subjects cause of discontent, though they take away
the honours they have heaped upon them, though they bring them to a
lower estate than they raised them from, yet ought they not to be so
forgetful of their allegiance that they should enter into any undutiful
act; much less upon rebellion, as you, my Lord, have done. All
whatsoever you have or can say in answer hereof are but shadows. And
therefore methinks it were best for you to confess, not to
justify.’”</p>
<p>Essex was provoked by Bacon’s incredulous sneer about enemies and
dangers— “I call forth Mr. Bacon against Mr. Bacon,” and referred to the
letters which Bacon had written in his name, and in which these
dangerous enmities were taken for granted. Bacon, in answer, repeated
what he said so often— “That he had spent more time in vain in studying
how to make the Earl a good servant to the Queen and State than he had
done in anything else.” Once more Coke got the proceedings into a
tangle, and once more Bacon came forward to repair the miscarriage of
his leader.</p>
<p>“‘I have never yet seen in any case such favour shown to any
prisoner; so many digressions, such delivering of evidence by fractions,
and so silly a defence of such great and notorious treasons. May it
please your Grace, you have seen how weakly he hath shadowed his purpose
and how slenderly he hath answered the objections against him. But, my
Lord, I doubt the variety of matters and the many digressions may
minister occasion of forgetfulness, and may have severed the judgments
of the Lords; and therefore I hold it necessary briefly to recite the
Judges’ opinions.’</p>
<p>“That being done, he proceeded to this effect:</p>
<p>“‘Now put the case that the Earl of Essex’s intents were, as he would
have it believed, to go only as a suppliant to her Majesty. Shall their
petitions be presented by armed petitioners? This must needs bring loss
of property to the prince. Neither is it any point of law, as my Lord of
Southampton would have it believed, that condemns them of treason. To
take secret counsel, to execute it, to run together in numbers armed
with weapons — what can be the excuse? Warned by the Lord Keeper, by a
herald, and yet persist! Will any simple man take this to be less than
treason?’</p>
<p>“The Earl of Essex answered that if he had purposed anything against
others than those his private enemies, he would not have stirred with so
slender a company. Whereunto Mr. Bacon answered:</p>
<p>“‘It was not the company you carried with you but the assistance you
hoped for in the City which you trusted unto. The Duke of Guise thrust
himself into the streets of Paris on the day of the Barricades in his
doublet and hose, attended only with eight gentlemen, and found that
help in the city which (thanks be to God) you failed of here. And what
followed? The King was forced to put himself into a pilgrim’s weeds, and
in that disguise to steal away to scape their fury. Even such was my
Lord’s confidence too, and his pretence the same — an all-hail and a
kiss to the City. But the end was treason, as hath been sufficiently
proved. But when he had once delivered and engaged himself so far into
that which the shallowness of his conceit could not accomplish as he
expected, the Queen for her defence taking arms against him, he was glad
to yield himself; and thinking to colour his practices, turned his
pretexts, and alleged the occasion thereof to proceed from a private
quarrel.’</p>
<p>“To this” (adds the reporter) “the Earl answered little. Nor was
anything said afterwards by either of the prisoners, either in the
thrust-and-parry dialogue with Coke that followed, or when they spoke at
large to the question why judgment should not be pronounced, which at
all altered the complexion of the case. They were both found guilty and
sentence passed in the usual form.”</p>
<p>Bacon’s legal position was so subordinate a place that there must
have been a special reason for his employment. It is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that, on the part of the Government, Bacon was thus used
for the very reason that he had been the friend of Essex. He was not
commonly called upon in such prosecutions. He was not employed by Cecil
in the Winchester trials of Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham, three years
afterwards, nor in those connected with the Gunpowder Plot. He was
called upon now because no one could so much damage Essex; and this last
proof of his ready service was required by those whose favour, since
Essex had gone hopelessly wrong, he had been diligently seeking. And
Bacon acquiesced in the demand, apparently without surprise. No record
remains to show that he felt any difficulty in playing his part. He had
persuaded himself that his public duty, his duty as a good citizen to
the Queen and the commonwealth, demanded of him that he should obey the
call to do his best to bring a traitor to punishment.</p>
<p>Public duty has claims on a man as well as friendship, and in many
conceivable cases claims paramount to those of friendship. And yet
friendship, too, has claims, at least on a man’s memory. Essex had been
a dear friend, if words could mean anything. He had done more than any
man had done for Bacon, generously and nobly, and Bacon had acknowledged
it in the amplest terms. Only a year before he had written, “I am as
much yours as any man’s, and as much yours as any man.” It is not, and
it was not, a question of Essex’s guilt. It may be a question whether
the whole matter was not exaggerated as to its purpose, as it certainly
was as to its real danger and mischief. We at least know that his rivals
dabbled in intrigue and foolish speeches as well as he; that little more
than two years afterwards Raleigh and Grey and Cobham were condemned for
treason in much the same fashion as he was; that Cecil to the end of his
days — with whatever purpose — was a pensioner of Spain. The question
was not whether Essex was guilty. The question for Bacon was, whether it
was becoming in him, having been what he had been to Essex, to take a
leading part in proceedings which were to end in his ruin and death. He
was not a judge. He was not a regular law officer like Coke. His only
employment had been casual and occasional. He might, most naturally, on
the score of his old friendship, have asked to be excused. Condemning,
as he did, his friend’s guilt and folly, he might have refused to take
part in a cause of blood, in which his best friend must perish. He might
honestly have given up Essex as incorrigible, and have retired to stand
apart in sorrow and silence while the inevitable tragedy was played out.
The only answer to this is, that to have declined would have incurred
the Queen’s displeasure: he would have forfeited any chance of
advancement; nay, closely connected as he had been with Essex, he might
have been involved in his friend’s ruin. But inferior men have marred
their fortunes by standing by their friends in not undeserved trouble,
and no one knew better than Bacon what was worthy and noble in human
action. The choice lay before him. He seems hardly to have gone through
any struggle. He persuaded himself that he could not help himself, under
the constraint of his duty to the Queen, and he did his best to get
Essex condemned.</p>
<p>And this was not all. The death of Essex was a shock to the
popularity of Elizabeth greater than anything that had happened in her
long reign. Bacon’s name also had come into men’s mouths as that of a
time-server who played fast and loose with Essex and his enemies, and
who, when he had got what he could from Essex, turned to see what he
could get from those who put him to death. A justification of the whole
affair was felt to be necessary; and Bacon was fixed upon for the
distinction and the dishonour of doing it. No one could tell the story
so well, and it was felt that he would not shrink from it. Nor did he.
In cold blood he sat down to blacken Essex, using his intimate personal
knowledge of the past to strengthen his statements against a friend who
was in his grave, and for whom none could answer but Bacon himself. It
is a well-compacted and forcible account of Essex’s misdoings, on which
of course the colour of deliberate and dangerous treason was placed.
Much of it, no doubt, was true; but even of the facts, and much more of
the colour, there was no check to be had, and it is certain that it was
an object to the Government to make out the worst. It is characteristic
that Bacon records that he did not lose sight of the claims of courtesy,
and studiously spoke of “my Lord of Essex” in the draft submitted for
correction to the Queen; but she was more unceremonious, and insisted
that the “rebel” should be spoken of simply as “Essex.”</p>
<p>After a business of this kind, fines and forfeitures flowed in
abundantly, and were “usually bestowed on deserving servants or favoured
suitors by way of reward;” and Bacon came in for his share. Out of one
of the fines he received £1200. “The Queen hath done something for me,”
he writes to a friendly creditor, “though not in the proportion I had
hoped,” and he afterwards asked for something more. It was rather under
the value of Essex’s gift to him in 1594. But she still refused him all
promotion. He was without an official place in the Queen’s service, and
he never was allowed to have it. It is clear that the “Declaration of
the Treason of the Earl of Essex,” if it justified the Government, did
not remove the odium which had fallen on Bacon. Mr. Spedding says that
he can find no signs of it. The proof of it is found in the “Apology”
which Bacon found it expedient to write after Elizabeth’s death and
early in James’s reign. He found that the recollection of the way in
which he had dealt with his friend hung heavy upon him; men hesitated to
trust him in spite of his now recognised ability. Accordingly, he drew
up an apology, which he addressed to Lord Mountjoy, the friend, in
reality half the accomplice, of Essex, in his wild, ill-defined plan for
putting pressure on Elizabeth. It is a clear, able, of course ex parte
statement of the doings of the three chief actors, two of whom could no
longer answer for themselves, or correct and contradict the third. It
represents the Queen as implacable and cruel, Essex as incorrigibly and
outrageously wilful, proud, and undutiful, Bacon himself as using every
effort and device to appease the Queen’s anger and suspiciousness, and
to bring Essex to a wiser and humbler mind. The picture is indeed a
vivid one, and full of dramatic force, of an unrelenting and merciless
mistress bent on breaking and bowing down to the dust the haughty spirit
of a once-loved but rebellious favourite, whom, though he has deeply
offended, she yet wishes to bring once more under her yoke; and of the
calm, keen-witted looker-on, watching the dangerous game, not without
personal interest, but with undisturbed presence of mind, and doing his
best to avert an irreparable and fatal breach. How far he honestly did
his best for his misguided friend we can only know from his own report;
but there is no reason to think that he did Essex ill service, though he
notices in passing an allegation that the Queen in one of her angry fits
had charged him with this. But his interest clearly was to make up the
quarrel between the Queen and Essex. Bacon would have been a greater man
with both of them if he had been able to do so. He had been too deeply
in Essex’s intimacy to make his new position of mediator, with a strong
bias on the Queen’s side, quite safe and easy for a man of honourable
mind; but a cool-judging and prudent man may well have acted as he
represents himself acting without forgetting what he owed to his friend.
Till the last great moment of trial there is a good deal to be said for
Bacon: a man keenly alive to Essex’s faults, with a strong sense of what
he owed to the Queen and the State, and with his own reasonable chances
of rising greatly prejudiced by Essex’s folly. But at length came the
crisis which showed the man, and threw light on all that had passed
before, when he was picked out, out of his regular place, to be charged
with the task of bringing home the capital charge against Essex. He does
not say he hesitated. He does not say that he asked to be excused the
terrible office. He did not flinch as the minister of vengeance for
those who required that Essex should die. He did his work, we are told
by his admiring biographer, better than Coke, and repaired the blunders
of the prosecution. He passes over very shortly this part of the
business: “It was laid upon me with the rest of my fellows;” yet it is
the knot and key of the whole, as far as his own character is concerned.
Bacon had his public duty: his public duty may have compelled him to
stand apart from Essex. But it was his interest, it was no part of his
public duty, which required him to accept the task of accuser of his
friend, and in his friend’s direst need calmly to drive home a
well-directed stroke that should extinguish chances and hopes, and make
his ruin certain. No one who reads his anxious letters about preferment
and the Queen’s favour, about his disappointed hopes, about his
straitened means and distress for money, about his difficulties with his
creditors — he was twice arrested for debt — can doubt that the question
was between his own prospects and his friend; and that to his own
interest he sacrificed his friend and his own honour.</p>
