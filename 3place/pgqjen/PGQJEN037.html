<h4 id="of-prophecies">Of Prophecies</h4>
<p>I mean not to speak of divine prophecies; nor of heathen oracles; nor
of natural predictions; but only of prophecies that have been of certain
memory, and from hidden causes. Saith the Pythonissa to Saul, To-morrow
thou and thy son shall be with me. Homer hath these verses:</p>
<p>At domus Aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris,</p>
<p>Et nati natorum, et qui nascentur ab illis.</p>
<p>A prophecy, as it seems, of the Roman empire. Seneca the tragedian
hath these verses:</p>
<p>— Venient annis</p>
<p>Saecula seris, quibus Oceanus</p>
<p>Vincula rerum laxet, et ingens</p>
<p>Pateat Tellus, Tiphysque novos</p>
<p>Detegat orbes; nec sit terris</p>
<p>Ultima Thule:</p>
<p>a prophecy of the discovery of America. daughter of Polycrates,
dreamed that Jupiter bathed her father, and Apollo anointed him; and it
came to the sun made his body run with sweat, and the rain washed it.
Philip of Macedon dreamed, he sealed up his wife’s belly; whereby he did
expound it, that his wife should be barren; but Aristander the
soothsayer, told him his wife was with child because men do not use to
seal vessels, that are empty. A phantasm that appeared to M. Brutus, in
his tent, said to him, Philippis iterum me videbis. Tiberius said to
Galba, Tu quoque, Galba, degustabis imperium. In Vespasian’s time, there
went a prophecy in the East, that those that should come forth of Judea,
should reign over the world: which though it may be was meant of our
Savior; yet Tacitus expounds it of Vespasian. Domitian dreamed, the
night before he was slain, that a golden head was growing, out of the
nape of his neck: and indeed, the succession that followed him for many
years, made golden times. Henry the Sixth of England, said of Henry the
Seventh, when he was a lad, and gave him water, This is the lad that
shall enjoy the crown, for which we strive. When I was in France, I
heard from one Dr. Penal that the Queen Mother, who was given to curious
arts, caused the King her husband’s nativity to be calculated, under a
false name; and the astrologer gave a judgment, that he should be killed
in a duel; at which the Queen laughed, thinking her husband to be above
challenges and duels: but he was slain upon a course at tilt, the
splinters of the staff of Montgomery going in at his beaver. The trivial
prophecy, which I heard when I was a child, and Queen Elizabeth was in
the flower of her years, was,</p>
<p>When hempe is spun</p>
<p>England’s done:</p>
<p>whereby it was generally conceived, that after the princes had
reigned, which had the principal letters of that word hempe (which were
Henry, Edward, Mary, Philip, and Elizabeth), England should come to
utter confusion; which, thanks be to God, is verified only in the change
of the name; for that the King’s style, is now no more of England, but
of Britian. There was also another prophecy, before the year of ’88,
which I do not well understand.</p>
<p>There shall be seen upon a day,</p>
<p>Between the Baugh and the May,</p>
<p>The black fleet of Norway.</p>
<p>When that that come and gone,</p>
<p>England build houses of lime and stone,</p>
<p>For after wars shall you have none.</p>
<p>It was generally conceived to be meant, of the Spanish fleet that
came in ’88: for that the king of Spain’s surname, as they say, is
Norway. The prediction of Regiomontanus,</p>
<p>Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus,</p>
<p>was thought likewise accomplished in the sending of that great fleet,
being the greatest in strength, though not in number, of all that ever
swam upon the sea. As for Cleon’s dream, I think it was a jest. It was,
that he was devoured of a long dragon; and it was expounded of a maker
of sausages, that troubled him exceedingly. There are numbers of the
like kind; especially if you include dreams, and predictions of
astrology. But I have set down these few only, of certain credit, for
example. My judgment is, that they ought all to be despised; and ought
to serve but for winter talk by the fireside. Though when I say
despised, I mean it as for belief; for otherwise, the spreading, or
publishing, of them, is in no sort to be despised. For they have done
much mischief; and I see many severe laws made, to suppress them. That
that hath given them grace, and some credit, consisteth in three things.
First, that men mark when they hit, and never mark when they miss; as
they do generally also of dreams. The second is, that probable
conjectures, or obscure traditions, many times turn themselves into
prophecies; while the nature of man, which coveteth divination, thinks
it no peril to foretell that which indeed they do but collect. As that
of Seneca’s verse. For so much was then subject to demonstration, that
the globe of the earth had great parts beyond the Atlantic, which mought
be probably conceived not to be all sea: and adding thereto the
tradition in Plato’s Timaeus, and his Atlanticus, it mought encourage
one to turn it to a prediction. The third and last (which is the great
one) is, that almost all of them, being infinite in number, have been
impostures, and by idle and crafty brains merely contrived and feigned,
after the event past.</p>
