XXIV. THE MISSING FOURTH PART OF “THE GREAT INSTAURATION.”</h4>
<p>It has been urged by critics that Bacon, whilst professing to take
all knowledge for his province, ignored one-half of it — that half which
was a knowledge of himself; that to him the external world was
everything, the internal nothing. All that Nature revealed was external;
nothing that was internal was of much importance.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that all that we have of Bacon’s was written as
he was passing into the “vale of life.” Of his early productions nothing
has come down to the present times under his own name. The following
extracts from his acknowledged works establish two facts: — (1) That the
foregoing criticism is unfounded, for he placed the study of man’s mind
and character above all other enquiries. (2) That he had prepared
examples, being “actual types and models, by which the entire process of
the mind and the whole fabric and order of invention from the beginning
to the end in certain subjects and those various and remarkable should
be set, as it were, before the eyes.” Where are these works to be
found?</p>
<p>Bacon never tires of quoting from the Roman poet the line —</p>
<p>“Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,”</p>
<p>which, in an Elizabethan handwriting, may be seen in a contemporary
volume thus rendered —</p>
<p>“He of all others fittest is to write</p>
<p>Which with some profit allso ioynes delight.”</p>
<p>He repeats in different forms, until the reiteration becomes almost
tedious, the following incident: —</p>
<p>“And as Alexander Borgia was wont to say, of the expedition of the
French for Naples, that they came with chalk in their hands to marke up
their lodgings not with weapons to fight; so we like better, that entry
of truth, which comes peaceably where the Mindes of men, capable to
lodge so great a guest, are signed, as it were, with chalke; than that
which comes with Pugnacity, and forceth itselfe a way by contentions and
controversies.”</p>
<p>The same idea is embodied in the following example of the antitheta:
—</p>
<p>“A witty conceit is oftentimes a convoy of a Truth which otherwise
could not so handsomely have been ferried over.”</p>
<p>In the “Advancement of Learning,” Lib. II., again the same view is
insisted on: —</p>
<p>“Besides in all wise humane Government, they that sit at the helme,
doe more happily bring their purposes about, and insinuate more easily
things fit for the people, by pretexts, and oblique courses; than by
downe-right dealing. Nay (which perchance may seem very strange) in
things meerely naturall, you may sooner deceive nature, than force her;
so improper, and selfe impeaching are open direct proceedings; whereas
on the other side, an oblique and an insinuing way, gently glides along
and compasseth the intended effect.”</p>
<p>One other fact must be realised before the full import of the
quotations about to be made can be appreciated. In the “Distributio
Operis” prefixed to the “Novum Organum” the following significant
passage occurs53: —</p>
<p>“For as often as I have occasion to report anything as deficient, the
nature of which is at all obscure, so that men may not perhaps easily
understand what I mean or what the work is which I have in my head, I
shall always (provided it be a matter of any worth) take care to subjoin
either directions for the execution of such work, or else a portion of
the work itself executed by myself as a sample of the whole: thus giving
assistance in every case either by work or by counsel.”</p>
<p>In the “Advancement of Learning,” Book II., chap. i., it is
written:</p>
<p>“That is the truest Partition of humane Learning, which hath
reference to the three Faculties of Man’s soule, which is the feat of
Learning. History is referred to Memory, Poesy to the Imagination,
Philosophy to Reason. By Poesy, in this place, we understand nothing
else, but feigned History, or Fables. As for Verse, that is only a style
of expression, and pertaines to the Art of Elocution, of which in due
place.”</p>
<p>“Poesy, in that sense we have expounded it, is likewise of
Individuals, fancied to the similitude of those things which in true
History are recorded, yet so as often it exceeds measure; and those
things which in Nature would never meet, nor come to passe, Poesy
composeth and introduceth at pleasure, even as Painting doth: which
indeed is the work of the Imagination.”</p>
<p>And in the same book, Chapter XIII.: —</p>
<p>“Drammaticall, or Representative Poesy, which brings the World upon
the stage, is of excellent use, if it were not abused. For the
Instructions, and Corruptions, of the Stage, may be great; but the
corruptions in this kind abound, the Discipline is altogether neglected
in our times. For although in moderne Commonwealths, Stage-plaies be but
estimed a sport or pastime, unlesse it draw from the Satyre, and be
mordant; yet the care of the Ancients was, that it should instruct the
minds of men unto virtue. Nay, wise men and great Philosophers, have
accounted it, as the Archet, or musicall Bow of the Mind. And certainly
it is most true, and as it were, a secret of nature, that the minds of
men are more patent to affections, and impressions, Congregate, than
solitary.”</p>
<p>The third chapter of Book VII. of the “De Augmentis” is devoted to
emphasising the importance of a knowledge of the internal working of the
mind and of the disposition and character of men. The following extracts
are of special moment: —</p>
<p>“Some are naturally formed for contemplation, others for business,
others for war, others for advancement of fortune, others for love,
others for the arts, others for a varied kind of life; so among the
poets (heroic, satiric, tragic, comic) are everywhere interspersed,
representations of characters, though generally exaggerated and
surpassing the truth. And this argument touching the different
characters of dispositions is one of those subjects in which the common
discourse of men (as sometimes, though very rarely, happens) is wiser
than books.”</p>
<p>The drama as the only vehicle through which this can be accomplished
at once suggests itself to the reader. But in order to emphasize this
point he proceeds —</p>
<p>“But far the best provision and material for this treatise is to be
gained from the wiser sort of historians, not only from the
commemorations which they commonly add on recording the deaths of
illustrious persons, but much more from the entire body of history as
often as such a person enters upon the stage.”</p>
<p>Bacon becomes still more explicit. He continues: —</p>
<p>“Wherefore out of these materials (which are surely rich and
abundant) let a full and careful treatise be constructed. Not, however,
that I would have their characters presented in ethics (as we find them
in history, or poetry, or even in common discourse) in the shape of
complete individual portraits, but rather the several features and
simple lineaments of which they are composed, and by the various
combinations and arrangements of which all characters whatever are made
up, showing how many, and of what nature these are, and how connected
and subordinated one to another; that so we may have a scientific and
accurate dissection of minds and characters, and the secret dispositions
of particular men may be revealed; and that from a knowledge thereof
better rules may be framed for the treatment of the mind. And not only
should the characters of dispositions which are impressed by nature be
received into this treatise, but those also which are imposed upon the
mind by sex, by age, by region, by health and sickness, by beauty and
deformity and the like; and again, those which are caused by fortune, as
sovereignty, nobility, obscure birth, riches, want, magistracy,
privateness, prosperity, adversity and the like.”</p>
<p>Shortly after follows this remarkable pronouncement.</p>
<p>“But to speak the truth the poets and writers of history are the best
doctors of this knowledge,54 where we may find painted forth with great
life and dissected, how affections are kindled and excited, and how
pacified and restrained, and how again contained from act and further
degree; how they disclose themselves, though repressed and concealed;
how they work; how they vary; how they are enwrapped one within another;
how they fight and encounter one with another; and many more particulars
of this kind; amongst which this last is of special use in moral and
civil matters; how, I say, to set affection against affection, and to
use the aid of one to master another; like hunters and fowlers who use
to hunt beast with beast, and catch bird with bird, which otherwise
perhaps without their aid man of himself could not so easily contrive;
upon which foundation is erected that excellent and general use in civil
government of reward and punishment, whereon commonwealths lean; seeing
these predominant affections of fear and hope suppress and bridle all
the rest. For as in the government of States it is sometimes necessary
to bridle one faction with another, so is it in the internal government
of the mind.”</p>
<p>In his “Distributio Operis” Bacon thus describes the missing fourth
part of his “Instauratio Magna”: —</p>
<p>“Of these the first is to set forth examples of inquiry and
invention55 according to my method exhibited by anticipation in some
particular subjects; choosing such subjects as are at once the most
noble in themselves among those under enquiry, and most different one
from another, that there may be an example in every kind. I do not speak
of these precepts and rules by way of illustration (for of these I have
given plenty in the second part of the work); but I mean actual types
and models, by which the entire process of the mind and the whole fabric
and order of invention from the beginning to the end in certain
subjects, and those various and remarkable, should be set as it were
before the eyes. For I remember that in the mathematics it is easy to
follow the demonstration when you have a machine beside you, whereas,
without that help, all appears involved and more subtle than it really
is. To examples of this kind — being, in fact, nothing more than an
application of the second part in detail and at large — the fourth part
of the work is devoted.”</p>
<p>The late Mr. Edwin Reed has, in his “Francis Bacon our Shakespeare,”
page 126, drawn attention to a remarkable circumstance. In 1607 Bacon
had written his “Cogitata et Visa,” which was the forerunner of his
“Novum Organum.” It was not published until twenty-seven years after his
death, namely, in 1653, by Isaac Gruter, at Leyden. In 1857 Mr. Spedding
found a manuscript copy of the “Cogitata” in the library of Queen’s
College at Oxford. This manuscript had been corrected in Bacon’s own
handwriting. It contained passages which were omitted from Gruter’s
print. Spedding did not realise the importance of the omitted passages,
but Mr. Edwin Reed has made this manifest. The following extract is
specially noteworthy, the portion printed in italics having been omitted
by Gruter: —</p>
<p>“… So he thought best, after long considering the subject and
weighing it carefully, first of all to prepare Tabulæ Inveniendi or
regular forms of inquiry; in other words, a mass of particulars arranged
for the understanding, and to serve, as it were, for an example and
almost visible representation of the matter. For nothing else can be
devised that would place in a clearer light what is true and what is
false, or show more plainly that what is presented is more than words,
and must be avoided by anyone who either has no confidence in his own
scheme or may wish to have his scheme taken for more than it is
worth.</p>
<p>“But when these Tabulæ Inveniendi have been put forth and seen, he
does not doubt that the more timid wits will shrink almost in despair
from imitating them with similar productions with other materials or on
other subjects; and they will take so much delight in the specimen given
that they will miss the precepts in it. Still, many persons will be led
to inquire into the real meaning and highest use of these writings, and
to find the key to their interpretation, and thus more ardently desire,
in some degree at least, to acquire the new aspect of nature which such
a key will reveal. But he intends, yielding neither to his own personal
aspirations nor to the wishes of others, but keeping steadily in view
the success of his undertaking, having shared these writings with some,
to withhold the rest until the treatise intended for the people shall be
published.”</p>
<p>Now what conclusions may be drawn from the foregoing extracts? Bacon
attached the greatest importance to the consideration of the internal
life of man. He affirms that dramaticall or representative poesy, which
brings the world upon the stage, is of excellent use if it be not
abused. The discipline of the stage was neglected in his time, but the
care of the ancients was that it should instruct the minds of men unto
virtue, and wise men and great philosophers accounted it as the musical
bow of the mind. He has devoted the fourth part of his “Instauratio
Magna” to setting forth examples of inquiry and invention, choosing such
subjects as are at once the most noble in themselves and the most
different one from another, that there may be an example in every kind.
He is not speaking of precepts and rules by way of interpretation, but
actual types and models by which the entire process of the mind, and the
whole fabric and order of invention, should be set, as it were, before
the eyes.</p>
<p>Not only should the characters of dispositions which are impressed by
nature be received into this treatise, but those also which are imposed
upon the mind by sex, by age, by region, by health and sickness, by
beauty and deformity, and the like; and, again, those that are caused by
fortune, as sovereignty, nobility, obscure birth, riches, want,
magistracy, privateness, prosperity, adversity, and the like.</p>
<p>The fourth part of Bacon’s “Great Instauration” is missing. The above
requirements are met in the Shakespeare plays. Could the dramas be more
accurately described than in the foregoing extracts?</p>
<p>From a study of the plays let a list be made out of the
qualifications which the author must have possessed. It will be found
that the only person in whom every qualification will be found who has
lived in any age of any country was Francis Bacon. Any investigator who
will devote the time and trouble requisite for an exhaustive examination
of the subject can come to no other conclusion.</p>
<p>One cannot without feeling deep regret recognise that we have to turn
to a foreigner to give “reasons for the faith which we English have in
Shakespeare.” It was a German, Schlegel, who discovered the great
dramatist, and to-day we must turn to his “Lectures on the Drama” for
the most penetrating description of his plays. The following is a
translation of a passage which in describing the plays almost adopts the
words Bacon uses in the foregoing passages as to the scope and object of
the fourth part of his “Great Instauration.”</p>
<p>“Never, perhaps, was there so comprehensive a talent for the
delineation of character as Shakespeare’s. It not only grasps the
diversities of rank, sex, and age, down to the dawnings of infancy; not
only do the king and the beggar, the hero and the pickpocket, the sage
and the idiot speak and act with equal truth; not only does he transport
himself to distant ages and foreign nations, and portray in the most
accurate manner, with only a few apparent violations of costume, the
spirit of the ancient Romans, of the French in their wars with the
English, of the English themselves during a great part of their history,
of the Southern Europeans (in the serious part of many comedies), the
cultivated society of that time, and the former rude and barbarous state
of the North; his human characters have not only such depth and
precision that they cannot be arranged under classes, and are
inexhaustible, even in conception; no, this Prometheus not merely forms
men, he opens the gates of the magical world of spirits, calls up the
midnight ghost, exhibits before us his witches amidst their unhallowed
mysteries, peoples the air with sportive fairies and sylphs; and these
beings, existing only in imagination, possess such truth and consistency
that even when deformed monsters like Caliban, he extorts the conviction
that if there should be such beings they would so conduct themselves. In
a word, as he carries with him the most fruitful and daring fancy into
the kingdom of nature; on the other hand, he carries nature into the
regions of fancy, lying beyond the confines of reality. We are lost in
astonishment at seeing the extraordinary, the wonderful, and the unheard
of in such intimate nearness.”</p>
<p>“If Shakespeare deserves our admiration for his characters he is
equally deserving of it for his exhibition of passion, taking this word
in its widest signification, as including every mental condition, every
tone from indifference or familiar mirth to the wildest rage and
despair. He gives us the history of minds, he lays open to us in a
single word a whole series of preceding conditions. His passions do not
at first stand displayed to us in all their height, as is the case with
so many tragic poets who, in the language of Lessing, are thorough
masters of the legal style of love. He paints, in a most inimitable
manner, the gradual progress from the first origin. ‘He gives,’ as
Lessing says, ‘a living picture of all the most minute and secret
artifices by which a feeling steals into our souls; of all the
imperceptible advantages which it there gains, of all the stratagems by
which every other passion is made subservient to it, till it becomes the
sole tyrant of our desires and our aversions.’ Of all poets, perhaps, he
alone has portrayed the mental diseases — melancholy, delirium, lunacy —
with such inexpressible, and in every respect definite truth, that the
physician may enrich his observations from them in the same manner as
from real cases.”</p>
