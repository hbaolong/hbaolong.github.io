<h4 id="iv.-century.">IV. Century.</h4>
<p>ACCELERATION of Time, in Works of Nature, may well be esteemed Inter
Magnalia Naturae. And euen in Diuine Miracles, Accelerating of the Time,
is next to the Creating of the Matter. We will now therfore proceed to
the Enquiry of it: And for Acceleration of Germination, we will referre
it ouer, vnto to the place, where we shall handle the Subiect of Plants,
generally; And will now begin with other Accelerations.</p>
<p>Liquours are (many of them,) at the first, thicke and troubled; As
Must, Wort, Iuyces of Fruits, or Hearbs expressed, andandandandc. And by
Time they settle, and Clarifie. But to make them cleare, before the
Time, is a great Worke; For it is a Spurre to Nature, and putteth her
out of her pace; And besides it is of good vse, for making Drinkes, and
Sances, Potable, and Seruiceable, speedily; But to know the —— — of
Accelerating Clarification, we must first know the Causes of
Clarification. The first Cause is, by the Separation of the Gresser
Parts of the Liquour-, from the Finer. The second, by the Equall
Distribution of the Spirits of the Liquour, with the 〈8 letters〉
Parts; For that —— representeth Bodies Cleare and Vntroubled. The third,
by the Resining the Spirit it selfe, which therby giueth to the Liquour
more Splendour, and more Lustre.</p>
<p>First, for Separation; It is wrought by Weight; As in the ordinary
Residence or Settlement of Liquours: By Heat: By Motion: By
Precipitation, or Sublimation; (That is, a Calling of the seuerall
Parts, either vp, or downe, which is a kinde of Attraction:) By
Adhesion; As when a Body more Viscous is mingled and agitated with the
Liquour: which Viscous Body (afterwards seuered) draweth with it the
grosser Parts of the Liquour; And Lastly, By Percolation or Passage.</p>
<p>Secondly, for the Euen Distribution of the Spirits; It is wrought By
Gentle Heat; And By Agitation or Motion; (For of Time we speake not,
because it is that, we would anticipate andandandand represent:) And it
is wrought also, By Mixture of some other Body, which hath a vertue to
open the Liquour, and to make the Spirits the better passe thorow.</p>
<p>Thirdly, for the Refining of the Spirit, it is wrought likewise By
Heat; By Motion; And by Mixture of some Body which hath Vertue to
attenuate. So therefore (hauing shewen the Causes) for the Accelerating
of Clarification, in generall, and the Enducing of it; take these
Instances, and Trialls.</p>
<p>It is in common Practise, to draw Wine, or Beere, from the Lees,
(which we call Racking;) wherby it will Clarifie much the sooner: For
the Lees, though they keepe the Drinke in Heart, and make it lasting;
yet withall they cast vp some Spissitude: And this Instance is to be
referred to Separation.</p>
<p>On the other side, it were good to try, what the Adding to the
Liquour more Lees than his owne will worke; For thought the Lees doe
make the Liquour turbide, yet they refine the Spirits. Take therfore a
Vessell of New Beere; And take another Vessell of New Beere, and Rack
the one Vessell from the Lees, and powre the Lees of the Racked Vessell
into the vnracked Vessell, and see the Effect: This Instance is referred
to the Refining of the Spirits.</p>
<p>Take New Beere, and put in some Quantitie of Stale Beere into it, and
see whether it will not accelerate the Clarification, by Opening the
Body of the Beere, and Cutting the Grosser Parts, wherby they may fall
downe into Lees. And this Instance againe is referred to Separation.</p>
<p>The longer Malt, or Herbs, or the like, are Infused in Liquour, the
more thicke and troubled the Liquour is; But the longer they be decocted
in the Liquour, the clearer it is. The Reason is plaine, because in
infusion, the longer it is, the greater is the Part of the Grosse Body,
that goeth into the Liquour: But in Decoction, though more goeth forth,
yet it either purgeth at the Top, or fettleth at the Bottome. And
therfore the most Exact Way to Clarifie is; First to Infuse, and then to
take off the Liquour, and Decoct it; as they doe in Beere, which hath
Malt first Infused in the Liquour, and is afterwards boiled with the
Hop. This also is referred to Separation.</p>
<p>Take Hot Embers, and put them about a Bottle filled with New Beere,
almost to the very Neck: Let the Bottle be well stopped, lest it flie
out: And continue it, renewing the Embers euery day, by the space of Ten
Dayes; and then compare it with another Bottle of the same Beere set-by.
Take also Lime both Quenched, and Vnquenched, and set the Bottles in
them, vt Supra. This Instance is referred, both to the Euen
Distribution, and also to the Refining of the Spirits by Heat.</p>
<p>Take Bottles, and Swing them; Or Carry them in a Wheels-Barrow, vpon
Rough Ground; twice in a day: But then you may not fill the Bottles
full, but leaue some Aire; For if the Liquour come close to the Stopple,
it cannot play, nor flower: And when you haue shaken them well, either
way, poure the Drinke into another Bottle, stopped close, after the
vsuall manner; For if it stay with much Aire in it, the Drinke will
pall; neither will it settle so perfectly in all the Parts. Let it stand
sorce 24. houres: Then take it, and put it againe into a Bottle with
Aire, vt supra: And thence into a Bottle Stopped, vt supra: And so
repeat the same Operation for seuen dayes. Note that in the Emptying of
one Bottle into another, you must doe it swiftly, lest the Drinke pall.
It were good also, to trie it in a Bottle with a little Aire below the
Neck, without Emptying. This Instance is referred to the Euen
Distribution and Refining of the Spirits by Motion.</p>
<p>As for Percolation, Inward, and Outward, (which belongeth to
Separation,) Triall would be made, of Clarifying by Adhesion, with Milks
put into New Beere, and stirred with it: For it may be that the Grossar
Part of the Beere will cleave to the Milke: The Doubt is, whether the
Milke will feuer - ell againe; Which is soone tried. And it is vsuall in
Clarifying Ippoerasse to put in Milke; Which after seuereth and carrieth
with it the Grosser Parts of the Ippoerasse, as hath beene said
elsewhere. Also for the better Clarification by Persolation, when they
run New Beere, they vse to let it passe through a Strainer; And it is
like the finer the Strainer is, the clearer it will be.</p>
<p>The Accelerating of Maturation Wee will now enquire of. And of
Maturation it selfe. It is of three Natures. The Maturation of Fruits.
The Maturation of Drinkes: And the Maturation of Impostumes, and Vlcers.
This last we referre to another Place, where wee shall handle
Experiments Medicinall. There be also other Maturations, as of Metalls,
andandandandc. whereof we will speake as Occasion serueth. But we will
begin with that of Drinkes, because it hath such a Affinitie with the
Clarification of Liquours.</p>
<p>For the Maturation of Drinkes, it is wrought by the congregation of
the Spirits together, whereby they digest more perfectly the Grosser
Parts: And it is effected partly, by the same meanes, that Clarification
is, (wherof wee spake before;) But then more, that an Extreme
Clarification doth spread the Spirits so Smooth, as they become Dull,
and the Drinke dead, which ought to haue a little Flouring. And
therefore all your Cleare Amber Drinke is flat.</p>
<p>We see the Degrees of Maturation of Drinkes; In Must; In Wine, as it
is drunke; And in Vinegar. Whereof Must hath not the Spirits well
Congregated; Wine hath them well vnited; so as they make the Parts
somewhat more Oylie: Vinegar hath them Congregated, but more Ieiune, and
in smaller Quantitie; The greatest and finest Spirit and Part being
exhaled: For we see Vinegar is made by setting the Vessell of Wine
against the hot Sun: And therefore Vinegar will not burne; For that much
of the Finer Parts is Exhaled.</p>
<p>The Refreshing and Quickning of Drinke Palled, or Dead, is by
Enforcing the Motion of the Spirit: So wee see that Open Weather
relaxeth the Spirit, and maketh it more liuely in Motion. Wee see also
Bottelling of Beere, or Ale, while it is New, and full of Spirit, (so
that it spirteth when the Stopple is taken forth) maketh the Drinke more
quicke and windie. A Pan of Coales in the Cellar doth likewise good, and
maketh the Drinke worke againe. New Drinke, put to Drinke that is Dead,
prouoketh it to worke againe; Nay, which is more, (as some affirme,) A
Brewing of New Beere, set by Old Beere, maketh it worke againe. It were
good also to Enforce the Spirits by some Mixtures, that may excite and
quicken them; As by Putting into the Bottles, Nitre, Chalke, Lime,
andandandandc. We see Creame is Matured, and made to rise more speedily,
by Putting in Cold Water; which, as it seemeth, getteth downe the
Whey.</p>
<p>It is tried, that the Burying of Bottles of Drinke well stopped,
either in drie Earth, a good depth; Or in the Bottome of a Well within
Water; And best of all the Hanging of them in a deepe Well somewhat
aboue the Water, for some forthnights space, is an Excellent Meanes of
making Drink fresh, and quicke: for the Cold doth not cause my Exhaling
of the Spirits at all; As Heat doth, though it rarifieth the rest that
remaine: But Cold maketh the Spirits vigorous, and irritateth them,
whereby they Incorporate the Parts of the Liquour perfectly.</p>
<p>As for the Maturation of Fruits; It is wrought by the Calling forth
of the Spirits of the Body outward, and so Spreading them more Smoothly:
And likewise by Digesting, in some degree, the Grosser Parts: And this
is Effected, by Heat; Motion; Attraction; And by a Rudiment of
Putrefaction: For the Inception of Putrefaction hath in it a
Maturation.</p>
<p>There were taken Apples, and laid in Straw; In Hay; In Flower; In
Chalke; In Lime; Couered ouer with Onions; Couered ouer with Crabs;
Closed vp in Wax; Shut in a Box; andandandandc. There was also an Apple
hanged vp in Smoake: Of all which the Experiments sorted in this
Manner.</p>
<p>After a Moneths Space, the Apple Enclosed in Wax, was as Greene and
Fresh as at the first Putting in, and the Kernells continued White. The
Cause is, for that all Exclusion of Open Aire, (which is euer Predatory)
maintaineth the Body in his first Freshnesse, and Moisture: But the
Inconuenience is, that it tasteth a little of the Wax: Which, I suppose,
in a Pomgranate, or some such thick-coated Fruit, it would not doe.</p>
<p>The Apple Hanged in the Smoake, turned like an Old Mellow Apple,
Wrinkled, Drle, Soft, Sweet Yellow within. The Cause is, for that such a
degree of Heat, which doth neither Melt, nor Scorch, (For we see that in
a greater Heat, a Roast Apple Softneth and Melteth; And Pigs feet, made
of Quarters of Wardens, scorch and haue a Skin of Cole) doth Mellow, and
not Adure: The Smoake also maketh the Apple (as it were) sprinkled with
Soot, which helpeth to Mature. We see than in Drying of Peares, and
Prunes, in the Ouen, and Remouing of them often as they begin to Sweat,
there is a like Operation; But that is with a farre more Intense degree
of Heat.</p>
<p>The Apples couered in the Lime and Ashes, were well Matured; As
appeared both in their Yellownesse, and Sweetnesse. The Cause is, for
that that Degree of Heat which is in Lime, and Ashes, (being a
Smoothering Heat) is of all the rest most Proper; for it doth neither
Liquefie, nor Atefie; And that is true Maturation, N — that the Taste of
those Apples was good; And therefore it is the Experiment fittest for
Vse.</p>
<p>The Apples, Conered with Crabs, and Onions, were likewise well
Matured. The Cause is, not any, Heat; But for that the Crab and the
Onions draw forth the —— of the Apple, and spread them equally thorow
out the — , which — away Hatdnesse —— — see f — one Apple — ath against
another. And therefore in making of Cider, they turne the Apples first
vpon a heape. So one Cluster of Grapes, that toucheth another —— it
groweth ripeneth faster; —— —— —— —— —— —</p>
<p>The Apple —— —— and the S —— —— apparently, though —— —— — in the ——
— more. The Cause is, for that the Hay and Straw haue a very low degree
of Heat, but yet Close and Smoothering, and which drieth nor.</p>
<p>The Apple in the Close Box, was ripened also: The Cause is, for that
all Alfe, kept close; hath a degree of Warmth. As we see in W —— —
Plus-, andandandandc.</p>
<p>Note that all these were Compared with another Apple, of the same
kinds, that lay of it Selfe: And in Comparison of that, were more Sweet,
and more Yellow, and so appeared to be most Ripe.</p>
<p>Taken Apple, or P — , or other like Fruit and Row — it vpon a Table
hard: We see in Common Experience, that the doth Soften and Sweeten the
Fruit presently▪ Which is Nothing but the S —— —— — of the Spirits into
the Parts; For the —— D —— of the Spirits maketh the Ha — ishnesse: But
this Hard Row — is betweene Concoction, and a Simple Maturation;
Therefore, if you should Rowle them but gently, perhaps twice a day; And
some seuen dayes▪ it is like they would mature more finely, and like
vnto the Naturall Maturation.</p>
<p>Take an Apple, and cut out a Peece of the Top, and couer it, to see
whether that Solution of Continuitie will not hasten a Maturation▪ We
see that where a Waspe, or a Flie, or a Worme hath bitten, in a Grape,
or any Fruit, it will sweeten hastily.</p>
<p>Take an Apple, andandandandc. and pricke it with a Prinne full of
Holes, not deepe, and smeare it a little with Sacke, or Cinnamon Water,
or Spirit of Wine, euery day for ten dayes, to see if the Virtuall Heat
of the Wine, or Strong Waters, will not Mature it.</p>
<p>In these Trialls also, as was vsed in the first, set another of the
same Fruits by, to Compare them: And trie them, by their Yellownesse,
and by their Sweetnesse.</p>
<p>The World hath beene much abused by the Opinion of Making of Gold:
The Worke it selfe I iudge to be possible; But the Meanes (hitherto
propounded) to effect it, are, in the Practise, full of Errour and
Imposture; And in the Theory, full of vnsound Imaginations. For to say,
that Nature hath an Intention to make all Metals Gold; And that, if she
were deliuered from Impediments, she would performe her owne Worke; And
that, if the Crudities, Impurities, and Leprosities of Metals were
cured, they would become Gold; And that a little Quantitie of the
Medicine, in the Worke of Proiection, will turne a Sea of the Baser
Metall into Gold, by Multiplying: All these are but dreames: And so are
many other Grounds of Alchymy. And to helpe the Matter, the Alchymists
call in likewise many Vanities, out of Astrologie; Naturall Magicke;
Superstitious Interpretations of Scriptures; Auricular Traditions;
Faigned Testimonies of Ancient Authors; And the like. It is true, on the
other side, they haue brought to light not a few profitable Experiments,
and thereby made the World some amends. But wee, when wee shall come to
handle the Version and Transmutation of Bodies; And the Experiments
concerning Metalls, and Mineralls; will lay open the true Wayes and
Passages of Nature, which may leade to this great Effect. And wee
commend the wit of the Chineses, who despaire of Making of Gold, but are
Mad vpon the Making of Siluer: For certaine it is, that it is more
difficult to make Gold, (which is the most Ponderous and Materiate
amongst Metalls) of other Metalls, lesse Ponderous, and lesse Materiate;
than (viâ versâ) to make Siluer of Lead, or Quick-Siluer; Both which are
more Ponderous than Siluer; So that they need rather a further Degree of
Fixation, than any Condensation. In the meanetime, by Occasion of
Handling the Axiomes touching Maturation, we will direct a Triall
touching the Maturing of Metalls, and therby Turning some of them into
Gold; For we conceiue indeed, that a perfect good Concoction, or
Disgestion, or Maturation of some Metalls, will produce Gold. And here
we call to minde, that wee knew a Dutch-man, that had wrought himselfe
into the beleese of a great Person, by vndertaking that he could make
Gold: Whose discourse was, that Gold might be made; But that the
Alchymists Ouer-fired the Worke: For (he said) the Making of Gold did
require a very temperate Heat, as being in Nature a Subterrany worke,
where little Heat commeth; But yet more to the Making of Gold, than of
any other Metall; And therefore, that he would doe it with a great
Lampe, that should carry a Temperate and Equall Heat: And that it was
the Worke of many Moneths. The Deuice of the Lampe was folly; But the
Ouer-firing now vsed; And the Equall Heat to be required; And the Making
it a Worke of some good Time; are no ill Discourses.</p>
<p>We resort therefore to our Axiomes of Maturation, in Effect touched
before. The First is, that there be vsed a Temporate Heat; For they are
euer Temperate Heats that Disgest, and Mature: Wherein we meane
Temperate, according to the Nature of the Subiect; For that may be
Temperate to Fruits, and Liquours, which will not worke at all vpon
Metalls. The Second is, that the Spirit of the Metall be quickened, and
the Tangible Parts opened: For without those two Operations, the Spirit
of the Metall, wrought vpon, will not be able to disgest the Parts. The
Third is, that the Spirits doe spread themselues Euen, and moue not
Subsultorily; For that will make the Parts Close, and Pliant. And this
requireth a Heat, that doth not rise and fall, but continue as Equall as
may be. The Fourth is, that no Part of the Spirit be emitted, but
detained: For if there be Emission of Spirit, the Body of the Metall
will be Hard, and Churlish. And this will be performed, partly by the
Temper of the Fire; And partly by the closenesse of the Vessell. The
Fifth is, that there be Choice made of the likeliest and best Prepared
Metall, for the Version: For that will facilitate the Worke. The Sixth
is, that you giue Time enough for the Worke: Not to prolong Hopes (as
the Alchymists doe;) but indeed to giue Nature a conuenient Space to
worke in. These Principles are most certaine, and true; Wee will now
deriue a direction of Triall out of them; Which may (perhaps) by further
Meditation, be improued.</p>
<p>Let there be a Small Furnace made, of a Temperate Heat; Let the Heat
be such, as may keepe the Metall perpetually Moulten, and no more; For
that aboue all importeth to the Worke. For the Materiall, take Siluer,
which is the Metall that in Nature Symbolizeth most with Gold; Put in
also, with the Siluer, a Tenth Part of Quick-siluer, and a Twelfth Part
of Nitre, by weight; Both these to quicken and open the Body of the
Metall: And so let the Worke be continued by the Space of Six Moneths,
at the least. I wish also, that there be, at some times, an Iniection of
some Oyled Substance; Such as they vse in the Recouering of Gold, which
by Vexing with Separations hath beene made Churlish: And this is, to lay
the Parts more Close and Smooth, which is the Maine Worke. For Gold (as
we see) is the Closest (and therefore the Heauiest) of Metalls: And is
likewise the most Flexible, and Tensible. Note, that to thinke to make
Gold of Quick-Siluer, because it is the heauiest, is a Thing not to be
hoped; For Quick-Siluer will not endure the Mannage of the Fire. Next to
Siluer, I thinke Copper were fittest to bee the Materiall.</p>
<p>Gold hath these Natures: Greatnesse of Weight; Closenesse of Parts;
Fixation; pliant-esse, or Softnesse; Immunity from Rust; Colour or
Tincture of Yellow. Therfore the Sure Way, (though most about,) to make
Gold, is to know the Causes of the Seuerall Natures before rehearsed,
and the Axiomes concerning the same. For if a Man can make a Metall,
that hath all these Properties, Let Men dispute, whether it be Gold, or
no?</p>
<p>The Enducing and Accelerating of Putrefaction, is a Subiect of a very
Vniuersall Enquiry: For Corruption is a Reciprocall to Generation. And
they Two, are as Natures two Termes or Bundaries; And the Guides to Life
and Death, Putrefaction is the Worke of the Spirits of Bodies, which
euer are Vnquiet to Get forth, and Congregate with the Aire, and to
onioy the Sunbeames: The Getting forth, or Spreading of the Spirits,
(which is a Degree of Getting forth,) hath fine Differing Operations. If
the Spirits be detained within the Body, and moue more violently, there
followeth Colliquation; As in Metalls, andandandandc. If more Mildely,
there followeth Disgestion, or Maturation, As in Drinkes, and Fruits. If
the Spirits be not meerely Detained, but Protrude a little, and that
Motion be Confused, and Inordinate, there followeth Putrefaction; Which
euer dissolueth the Consistence of the Body into much Inequality; As in
Flesh, Rotten Fruits, Shining Wood, andandandandc. And also in the Rust
of Metalls. But if that Motion be in a certaine Order, there followeth
Viuification, and Figuration; As both in Liuing Creatures bred of
Putrefaction, and in Liuing Creatures Perfect. But if the Spirits issue
out of the Body, there followeth Deficcation, Induration, Consumption,
andandandandc. As in Bricke, Euaporation of Bodies Liquid,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Meanes to Enduce and Accelerate Putrefaction, are; First by
Adding some Crude pr Watry Moisture; As in Wetting of any Flesh, Fruit,
Wood, with Water, andandandandc. For contrariwise Vnctuous and Oyly
Substances preserue.</p>
<p>The Second is by Inuitation or Excitation; As when a Rotten Apple
lyeth close to another Apple that is Sound; Or when Dung (which is a
substance, already Putrified) is added to other Bodies. And this is also
notably seene in Church-yards, where they bury much; Where the Earth
will consume the Corps, in farre shorter time, than other Earth
will.</p>
<p>The Third is, by Closenesse, and Stopping, which detaineth the
Spirits, in Prison, more than they would; And thereby irritateth them to
seeke Issue; As in Corne, and Cloaths, which waxe Musty; and therefore
Open Aire (which they call Aer perstabilis) doth preserue: And this doth
appeare more Euidently in Agnes, which come (most of them,) of
Obstructions, and Penning the Humours, which thereupon Putrisie.</p>
<p>The Fourth is, by Solution of Continuity; As we see an Apple will rot
sooner, if it be Cut or Pierced; And so will Wood, andandandandc. And so
the Flesh of Creatures aliue, where they haue receiued any Wound.</p>
<p>The Fifth is, either by the Exhaling, or by the Driuing back of the
Principall Spirits, which preserue the Consistence of the Body; So that
when their Gouernment is Dissolued, euery Part returneth to his Nature,
or Homogeny. And this appeareth in Vrine, and Blond, when they coole,
and thereby breake; It appeareth also in the Gangrene, or Mortification
of Flesh, either by Opiates, or by Intense Colds. I conceiue also the
same Effect is in Pestilences, for that the Malignity of the Infecting
Vapour, daunceth the Principall Spirits, and maketh them fly, and leaue
their Regiment; And then the Humours, Flesh, and Secondary Spirits, doe
dissolue, and breake, as in an Anarchy.</p>
<p>The Sixth is, when a Forraine Spirit, Stronger and more Eager than
the Spirit of the Body, entreth the Body; As in the Stinging of
Serpents. And this is the Cause (generally) that vpon all Poysons
followeth Swelling: And we see Swelling followeth also, when the Spirits
of the Body it selfe, Congregate too much; As vpon Blowes, and Bruises;
Or when they are Pent in too much, as in Swelling vpon Cold. And we see
also, that the Spirits comming of Putrefaction of Humours in Agues,
andandandandc. Which may be counted as Forraine Spirits, though they be
bred within the Body, doe Extinguish and Suffocate the Naturall Spirits,
and Heat.</p>
<p>The Seuenth is, by such a Weake Degree of Heat, as setteth the
Spirits in a little Motion, but is not able, either to disgest the
Parts, or to Issue the Spirits; As is seene in Flesh kept in a Roome
that is not Coole; Whereas in a Coole and Wet Larder it will keepe
longer. And wee see, that Viuisication (whereof Putrefaction is the
Bastard Brother,) is effected by such Soft Heats; As the Hatching of
Egges; The Heat of the Wombe, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Eight is, by the Releasing of the Spirits; which before were
close kept by the Solidnesse of their Couerture, and thereby their
Appetite of Issuing checked; As in the Artificiall Rusts induced by
strong Waters, in Iron, Lead, andandandandc. And therefore Wetting
hasteneth Rust, or Putrefaction of any thing, because it softeneth the
Crust, for the Spirits to come forth.</p>
<p>The Ninth is, by the Enterchange of Heat and Cold, or Wet and dry; As
wee see in the Moulding of Earth in Frosts, and Sunne; And in the more
hasty Rotting of Wood, that is sometimes wet, sometimes dry.</p>
<p>The Tenth is, by Time, and the Worke Procedure of the Spirits
themselues, which cannot keepe their Station; Especially if they be lost
to themselues; And there be not Agitation or Locall Motion. As wee see
in Corne not stirred; And Mens Bodies not exercised.</p>
<p>All Moulds are Inceptions of Putrefaction; As the Moulds of Pyes, and
Flesh; the Moulds of Orenges, and Limons; which Moulds afterwards turne
into Wormes, or more odious Putrefactions: And therfore (commonly) proue
to be ill Odour. And if the Body be Liquid, and not apt to Putrifie
totally, it will cast vp a Mother in the Top; As the Mothers of
Distilled Waters.</p>
<p>Mosse is a kinde of Mould, of the Earth, and Trees. But it may be
better sorted as a Rudiment of Germination; To which we referre it.</p>
<p>It is an Enquiry of Excellent vse, to Enquire of the Meanes of
Preuenting or Staying Putrefaction, For therein consisteth the Meanes of
Conseruation of Bodies; For Bodies haue two Kindes of Dissolutions; The
one by Consumption, and Deficcation; The other by Putrefaction. But as
for the Putrefactions of the Bodies of Men, and Liuing Creatures, (as in
Agues, Wormes, Consumptions of the Lungs, Impostumes, and Vlcers both
Inwards and Outwards,) they are a great Part of Physicke, and Surgery:
And therefore we will reserue the Enquiry of them to the proper Place,
where we shall handle Medicinal Experiments of all Sorts. Of the rest we
will now Enter into an Enquiry: wherein much light may be taken, form
that which hath beene said, of the Meanes to Enduce or Accelerate
Putrefaction; For the Remouing that, which caused Putrefaction, doth
Preuent and Auoid Putrefaction.</p>
<p>The First Meanes of Prohibiting or Checking Putrefaction, is Cold:
For so wee see Meat and Drinke will last longer, Vnputrified, or
Vnsowred, in Winter, than in Summer: And we see that Flowers, and
fruits, put in Conseruatories of Snow, keepe fresh. And this worketh by
the Detention of the Spirits, and Constipation of the Tangible
Parts.</p>
<p>The Second is Astriction: For Astriction prohibiteth Dissolution: As
we see (generally) in Medicines, whereof such as are Astringents doe
inhibite Putrefaction; And by the same reason of Astringency, some small
Quantity of Oile of Vitrioll, will keepe Fresh Water long from
Putrefying. And this Astriction is in a substance that hath a Virtuall
Cold; And it worketh (partly) by the fame Meanes that Cold doth.</p>
<p>The Third is, the Excluding of the Aire; And againe, the Exposing to
the Aire; For these Contraries, (as it commeth often to passe;) worke
the same Effect, according to the Nature of the Subiect Matter. So we
see, that Beere, or Wine, in Bottles close stopped, last long; That the
Garners vnder Ground keepe Come longer than those aboue Ground; and that
Fruit closed in Waxe keepeth fresh: And likewise Bodies put in Honey,
and Flower, keepe more fresh; And Liquours, Drinkes, and Iuices, with a
little Oyle cast on the Top keepe fresh. Contratiwise, we see that Cloth
and Apparell, not Aired, doe breed Moathes, and Mould; And the Diuersity
is, that in Bodies that need Detenties of Spirits, the Excluston of the
Aire doth good; As in Drinkes, and C —— : But in Bodies that need
Emission of Spirits, to discharge some of the Superfluous Moisture, it
doth hurt, for they require Atring.</p>
<p>The fourth is Motion, and Stirring; For Putrefaction asketh Rest; For
the Subtill Motion, which Putrefaction requireth, is disturbed by any
Agitation; And all Locall Motion keepeth Bodies Integrall, and their
Parts together; As we see that Turning ouer of Corne in a Garner; Or
Letting it runne like an Houre-glasse, from an vpper Roome into a Lower,
doth keepe it Sweet; And Running Waters putrefie not; And in Mens
Bodles. Exercise hindreth Putrefaction; And contrariwise Rest, and Want
of Motion, or Stoppings, (whereby the Runne of Humours, or the Motion of
Perspiration, is stayed,) further Putrefaction; As we part partly
touched a little before.</p>
<p>The Fifth is, the Breathing forth of the Aduentitious Moisture in
Bodies; For as Wetting doth hasten Putrefaction; So Connenient Drying.
(wherby the more Radicall Moisture is onely kept in,) putteth backe
Putrefaction: So we see that Herbs, and Flowers, if they be dried in the
Shade; Or dried in the hot Sunne, for a small time, keepe best. For the
Emission of the Loose and Aduentitious Moisture, doth betray the
Radicall Moisture; And carryeth it out for Company.</p>
<p>The Sixth is, the Strengthning of the Spirits of Bodies; For as a
Great Heat keepeth Bodies from Putrefaction; But a Tepide Heat enclineth
them to Putrefaction: So a Strong Spirit likewise preserueth, and a
Weake or Faint Spirit disposeth to Corruption. So we finde that
Salt-water corrupteth not so soone as Fresh: And Salting of Oisters, and
Powdring of Meat, keepeth them from Putrefaction, It would be tried
also, whether Chalke put into Water, or Drinke doth not preserue it from
Putrefying, or speedy Souring. So wee see that Strong Beere, will last
longer than Small; And all Things, that are hot and Aromaticall, doe
helpe to preserue Liquours, or Powders, andandandandc. Which they doe,
as well by Strengthning the Spirits, as by Soaking out the loose
Moisture;</p>
<p>The Seuenth is, Separation of the Cruder Parts, and thereby making
the Body more Equall; for all vnperfect Mixture is apt to Putrefie; And
Watry Substances are more apt to Putrefie, than Oyly. So we see
Distilled Waters will last longer than Raw waters; And Things that haue
passed the Fire, doe last longer, than those that haue not passed the
Fire; As Dried Peares, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Eighth is, the Drawing forth continually of that part, where the
Putrefaction beginneth: Which is (commonly) the Loose and watry
Moisture; Not onely for the Reason before giuen, that it prouoketh the
Radicall Moisture to come forth with it; But because being detained in
the Body, the Putrefaction taking hold of it, insecteth the rest: As we
see in the Embalming dead Bodies; And the same Reason is of Preseruing
Herbs, or Fruits, or Flowers, in Branne, or Meale.</p>
<p>The Ninth, is the Commixiture of any Thing that is more Oily, or
Sweet: For such Bodies are least apt to Putrefie, the Aire working
little vpon them; And they not putrefying preserue the rest. And
therefore we see Syrrups, and Ointments, will last longer, than
Iuyces.</p>
<p>The Tenth is, the Commixture of somewhat that is Dry; For
Putrefaction beginneth first from the Spirits; And then from the
Moisture; And that that is dry is vnapt to puttrefie: And therefore
Smoake preserueth Flesh; As wee see in Bacon, and Neats-Tongues, and
Martlemas Beese, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Opinion of some of the Ancients, that Blowne Aires doe preserue
Bodies, longer than other Aires, seemeth to Mee Probable; For that the
Blowne Aires, being Ouer-charged and Compressed, will hardly receiue the
Exhaling of any Thing, but rather repulse it. It was tried in a Blowne
Bladder, whereinto Flesh was put, and likewise a Flower, and it sorted
not; For Dry Bladders will not Blow: And New Bladders rather further
Putrefaction: The way were therfore, blow strongly, with a Paire of
Bellowes, into a Hogshead, putting into the Hogshead (before) that which
you would haue preserued; And in the instant that you withdraw the
Bellowes, stop the Hole close.</p>
<p>The Experiments of Wood that Shineth in the Darke, we haue diligently
driuen, and pursued. The rather, for that of all Things, that giue Light
here below, it is the most Durable. And hath least Apparent Motion, Fire
and Flame are in continuall Expence; Sugar shineth onely while it is in
Scraping; And Salt-water while it is in Dashing; Glowing — es haue their
Shining while they liue or a little after; Onely Scales of Fishes
(Putrified) seeme to be of the same Nature with Shining Wood; And it is
true, that all Putrefaction hath with it an Inward Motion, as well as
Fire, or Light. The Triall sorted thus. 1. The Shining is in some Peeces
more Bright, in some more Di — ; but the most Bright of all doth not
attaine to the Light of a Glow-w —— . 2. The Woods that haue beene tried
to shine, are chiefly Sallow, and Willow; Also the A — , and Husle; It
may be, it holdeth in others. 3. Both Roots, and Bodies doe shine, but
the Roots better. 4. The Colour of the Shining Part, by Daylight, is in
some Peeces White, in some Peeces inclining to Red; Which in the
Countrey they call the White, and Red Garret. 5. The Part that Shineth,
is, (for the most part) somewhat Safe, and Moist to feele to; But some
was sound to be Firme and Hard; So as it might be figured into a Crosse,
or into Beads, andandandandc. But you must not looke to haue an Image,
or the like, in any Thing that is Lightsome; For euen a face in Iron red
Hot will not be seene, the Light confounding the small differences of
Lightsome and Darksome, which shew the figure. 6. There was the Shining
Part pared off, till you came to that, that did not Shine; But within
two Dayes the Part Contiguous began also to Shine, being laid abroad in
the Dew; So as it seemeth the Putrefaction spreadeth. 7. There was other
dead Wood of like kinde, that was Laid abroad, which Shined not at the
first; But after a Nights lying abroad began to Shine. 8. There was
other Wood, that did First Shine; And being laid dry in the House,
within fiue or six daies, Lost the Shining; And laid abroad againe,
Recouered the Shining: 9. Shining woods, being laid in a Dry Roome,
within a Seuen night, lose their Shining; But being laid in a Cellar, or
Darke Roome, kept the Shining. 10. The Boring of Holes, in that kinde of
Wood, and then laying it abroad, seemeth to conduce to make it Shine:
The Cause is, for that all Solution of Continuity doth helpe on
Putrefaction, as was touched before. 11. No Wood hath beene yet tried to
Shine, that was cut downe aliue, but such as was Rotted, both in Stocke,
and Root, while it grew. 12. Part of the Wood that Shined, was Steeped
in Oyle, and retained the Shining a Forthnight. 13. The like succeeded
in some Steeped in Water, and much better. 14. How long the Shining will
continue, if the Wood be laid abroad euery Night, and taken in and
Sprinckled with Water in the Day, is not yet tryed. 15. Triall was made
of laying it abroad in Frostie weather, which hurt it not. 16. There was
a great Peece of a Root which did shine, and the Shining Part was Cut
off, till no more Shined; Yet after two Nights, though it were kept in a
drie Roome, it got a Shining.</p>
<p>The Bringing, forth of liuing Creatures may be accelerated in two
Respects: The one, if the Embryon ripeneth and perfecteth sooner: The
other if there be some Cause from the Mothers Body, of Expulsion or
Putting it downe: whereof the Former is good, and argueth Strength; The
Latter is ill, and commeth by Accident or Disease. And therefore the
Ancient Obseruation is true, that the Childe borne in the Seuenth Mo —
th, doth commonly well; But Borne in the Eighth Moneth, doth (for the
most part) die. But the Cause assigned is Fabulous; Which is, that in
the Eighth Moneth, should be the Returne of the Raigne, of the Planet
Saturne: which (as they say) is a Planet Maligne; whereas in the Seuenth
is the Raigne of the Moone, which is a Planet Propitious. But the true
Cause is, for that where there is so great a Preuention of the Ordinary
time, it is the lustinesse of the Childe; But when it is lesse, it is
some Indisposition of the Mother.</p>
<p>To Accelerate Growth or Stature, it must proceed; Either from the
Plentie of the Nourishment; Or from the Nature of the Nourishment; Or
from the Quickening and Exciting of the Naturall Heat. For the first,
Excesse of Nourishment is hurtfull; For it maketh the Childe Corpulent;
And Growing in Breadth, rather than in Heighth. And you may take an
Experiment from Plants, which, if they spread much, are seldome tall. As
for the Nature of the Nourishment; First, it may not be too Drie; And
therefore Children in Dayrie Countries doe wax more tall, than where
they feed more vpon Bread, and Flesh. There is also a receiued Tale;
That Boyling of Dasie Roots in Milke (which it is certaine are great
Driers) will make Dogs little. But so much is true, that an Ouer-drie
Nourishment in Childhood putteth backe Stature. Secondly, the
Nourishment must be of an Opening Nature; For that Attenuateth the
Iuice, and furthereth the Motion of the Spirits, vpwards. Neither is it
without cause, that Xenophon, in the Nouriture of the Persian Children,
doth so much commend their Feeding vpon Cardamon; which (hee saith) made
them grow better, and be of a more Actiue Habit. Cardamon is in Latine
Nasturtium; And with vs Water-Cresses; Which, it is certaine, is an
Herbe, that whilest it is young, is Friendly to Life. As for the
Quickening of Naturall Heat, it must be done chiefly with Exercise; And
therefore (no doubt) much Going to Schoole, where they sit so much,
hindreth the Growth of Children; whereas Countrey People, that goe not
to Schoole, are commonly of better Stature. And againe Men must beware,
how they giue Children, any thing that is Cold in Operation; For euen
Long Sucking doth hinder both Wit, and Stature. This hath beene tried,
that a Whelpe, that hath beene fed with Nitre in Milke, hath become very
little, but extreme liuely: For the Spirit of Nitre is Cold. And though
it be an Excellent. Medicine, in Strength of yeares, for Prolongation of
Life; yet it is, in Children and young Creatures, an Enemy to Growth:
And all for the same Reason, For Heat is requisite to Growth: But after
a Man is come to his Middle Age, Heat consumeth the Spirits; which the
Coldnesse of the Spirit of Nitre doth helpe to condense, and
correct.</p>
<p>There be two Great Families of Things; You may terme them by seuerall
Names; Sulphureous and Mercuriall, which are the Chymists Words: (For as
for their Sal, which is their Third Principle, it is a Compound of the
other two;) Inflammable and Not Inflammable; Mature and Crude; Oily and
Watry. For we see that in Subterranies there are, as the Fathers of
their Tribes, Brimstone and Mercury: In Vegetables, and Liuing Creatures
there is Water and Oyle: In the Inferiour Order of Pneumaticalls there
is Aire and Flame: And in the Superiour, there is the Body of the
Starre, and the Pure Sky. And these Paires, though they be vnlike in the
Primitiue Differences of Matter, yet they seeme to haue many Consents:
For Mercury and Sulphure are principall Materialls of Metalls; Water and
Oyle, are principall Materialls of Vegetables, and Animals; And seeme to
differ but in Maturation, or Concoction: Flame (in Vulgar Opinion) is
but Aire Incensed; And they both haue Quicknesse of Motion, and Facility
of Cession, much alike: And the Interstellar Sky, (though the Opinion be
vaine, that the Starre is the Denser Part of his Orbe,) hath
notwithstanding so much Affinity with the Starre, that there is a
Rotation of that, as well as of the Starre. Therefore, it is one of the
greatest Magnalia Naturae, to turne Water, or Watry Iuyce, into Oile or
Oily Iuyce: Greater in Nature, than to turne Siluer, or Quick-siluer,
into Gold.</p>
<p>The Instances we haue, wherein Crude and Watry Substance turneth into
Fat and Oily, are of foure kindes. First in the Mixture of Earth and
Water; which mingled by the helpe of the Sunne, gather a Nitrous
Fatnesse, more than either of them haue seuerally; As we see, in that
they put forth Plants, which need both Iuyces.</p>
<p>The Second is in the Assimilation of Nourishment, made in the Bodies
of Plants, and Liuing Creatures; Where of Plants turne the Iuyce of
meere Water and Earth, into a great deale of Oily Matter: Liuing
Creatures, though much of their Fat, and Flesh, are out of Oily
Aliments, (as Meat, and Bread,) yet they Assimilate also in a Measure
their Drinke of VVater, andandandandc. But these two Wayes of Version of
Water into Oyle, (namely by Mixture, and by Assimilation) are by many
Passages, and Percolations, and by long Continuance of soft Heats, and
by Circuits of Time.</p>
<p>The third is in the Inception of Putrefaction; As in Water Corrupted;
And the Mothers of Waters Distilled; Both which haue a kinde of
Fatnesse, or Oyle.</p>
<p>The Fourth is in the Dulcoration of some Metalls; As Saccharum
Saturni, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Intention of Version of Water into a more Oily Substance, is by
Disgestion; For Oile is almost Nothing else but Water disgested; And
this Disgestion; is principally by Heats Which Heat must be either
Outward, or Inward: Againe, it may be by Prouocation, or Excitation;
Which is caused by the Mingling of Bodies already Oily, or Disgested;
For they will somewhat Communicate their Nature with the rest.
Disgestion also is strongly effected by direct Assimilation, of Bodies
Crude into Bodies Disgested; As in Plants, and Liuing Creatures, whose
Nourishment is far more Crude than their Bodies: But this Disgestion is
by a great Compasse, as hath beene said. As for the more full Handling
of these two Principles, whereof this is but a Taste; (the Enquiry of
which is one of the Profoundest Enquiries of Nature,) We leaue it to the
Title of Version of Bodies; And likewise to the Title of the First
Congregations of Matter; Which like a Generall Assembly of Estates, doth
giue Law to all Bodies.</p>
<p>A Chameleon is a Creature about the Bignesse of an Ordinary Lizard:
His Head vnproportionably bigge; His Eyes great: He moueth his Head
without the writhing of his Necke, (which is inflexible,) as a Hogge
doth: His Backe crooked; His Skin Spotted with little Tumours, lesse
Eminent nearer the Belly; His Taile slender, and long: On each Foot he
hath fiue Fingers; three on the Outside, and two on the Inside; His
Tongue of a maruellous Length in respect of his Body, and hollow at the
end; Which he will launch out to prey vpon Flses. Of Colour Greene, and
of a dusky Yellow, brighter and whiter towards the Belly; Yet spotted
with Blew, White, and Red. If hee be laid vpon Greene, the Greene
predominateth; If vpon Yellow, the Yellow; Not so if he be laid vpon
Blew, or Red, or White; Onely the Greene Spots receiue a more Orient
Lustre: Laid vpon Blacke, he looketh all Blacke, though not without a
Mixture of Greene. He feedeth not only vpon Aire, (though that be his
principall Sustenance;) For sometimes hee taketh Flies, as was said; yet
some that haue kept Chameleons a whole yeare together, could neuer
perceiue that euer they fed vpon any Thing else but Aire; And might
obserue their Bellies to swell after they had exhausted the Aire, and
closed their Iawes; Which they open commonly against the Rayes of the
Sunne. They haue a foolish Tradition in Magicke, that if a Chameleon be
burnt vpon the Top of a House, it will raise a Tempest; Supposing
(according to their vaine Dreames of Sympathies) because he nourisheth
with Aire, his Body should haue great vertue to make Impression vpon the
Aire.</p>
<p>It is reported by one of the Ancients, that in Part of Media, there
are Eruptions of Flames out of Plaines; And that those Flames are
cleare, and cast not forth such Smoake, and Ashes, and Pummice, as
Mountaine Flames doe. The Reason (no doubt) is, because the Flame is not
pent, as it is in Mountaines, and Earth-quakes which cast Flame. There
be also some Blinde Fires, vnder Stone, which flame not out, but Oile
being powred vpon them, they flame out. The Cause whereof is, for that
it seemeth, the Fire is so choaked, as not able to remoue the Stone, it
is Heat, rather than Flame; Which neuerthelesse is sufficient to Enflame
the Oyle.</p>
<p>It is reported, that in some Lakes, the Water is so Nitrous, as if
Foule Cloaths be put into it, it scoureth them of it selfe: And if they
stay any whit long, they moulder away. And the Scouring Vertue of Nitre
is the more to be noted, because it is a Body Cold; And we see Warme
Water scoureth better than Cold. But the Cause is, for that it hath a
Subtill Spirit, which seuereth and diuideth any thing that is soule, and
Viscous, and sticketh vpon a Body.</p>
<p>Take a Bladder, the greatest you can get; Fill it full of Winde, and
tye it about the Necke with a Silke thred waxed; And vpon that put
likewise Wax very close; So that when the Neck of the Bladder dryeth, no
Aire may possibly get in, nor out. Then bury it three or foure foot
vnder the Earth, in a Vault, or in a Conferuatory of Snow, the Snow
being made hollow about the Bladder; And after some Forthnights
distance, see whether the Bladder be shruncke: For if it be, then it is
plaine, that the Coldnesse of the Earth, or Snow, hath Condensed the
Aire, and brought it a Degree nearer to Water: Which is an Experiment of
great Consequence.</p>
<p>It is a Report of some good credit, that in Deepe Caues, there are
Pensile Crystall, and Degrees of Crystall that drop from aboue; And in
some other, (though more rarely) that rise from below. Which though it
be chiefly the Worke of Cold, yet it may be, that Water, that passeth
thorow the Earth, gathereth a Nature more clammy, and fitter to
Congeale, and become Solide, than Water of it selfe. Therfore Triall
would be made, to lay a Heape of Earth, in great Frosts, vpon a Hollow
Vessell, putting a Canuase betweene, that it falleth not in: And poure
Water vpon it, in such Quantitie, as will be sure to soake thorow; And
see whether it will not make an harder Ice in the bottome of the
Vessell, and lesse apt to dissolue, than ordinarily. I suppose also,
that if you make the Earth narrower at the bottome, than at the Top, in
fashion of a Sugar Loafe Reuersed, it will helpe the Experiment. For it
will make the Ice, where it Issueth, lesse in Bulke; And euermore
Smalnesse of Quantity is a Helpe to Version.</p>
<p>Take Damaske Roses, and pull them; Then dry them vpon the Top of an
House, vpon a Lead or Tarras, in the hot Sunne, in a cleare day,
betweene the Houres (onely) of twelue and two; or there abouts. Then put
them into a Sweet Dry Earthen Bottle, or a Glasse, with narrow Mouthes,
stuffing them close together, but without Bruising: Stop the Bottle, or
Glasse, close, and these Roses will retaine, not onely their Smell
Perfect, but their Colour fresh, for a yeare at least. Note, that
Nothing doth so much destroy any Plant, or other Body, either by
Putrefaction, or Arefaction, as the Aduentitious Moisture, which hangeth
loose in the Body, if it be not drawne out. For it betrayeth and tolleth
forth the Innate and Radicall Moisture, along with it, when it selfe
goeth forth. And therefore in Liuing Creatures, Moderate Sweat doth
preserue the Iuyce of the Body. Note that these Roses, when you take
them from the Drying, haue little or no Smell; So that the Smell is a
Second Smell, that issueth out of the Flower afterwards.</p>
<p>The Continuance of Flame, according vnto the diuersity of the Body
Enflamed, and other Circumstances, is worthy the Enquiry; Chiefly, for
that though Flame be (almost) of a Momentany Lasting, yet it receiueth
the More, and the Lesse: we will first therefore speake (at large) of
Bodies Enflamed, wholly, and Immediately, without any Wieke to helpe the
Inflammations. A Spoonefull of Spirit of Wine, a little heated, was
taken, and it burnt as long as came to 116. Pulses. The same Quantity of
Spirit of Wine, Mixed with the Sixth Part of a Spoonefull of Nitre,
burnt but to the space of 94. Pulses. Mixed with the like Quantity of
Bay-salt, 83. Pulses. Mixed with the like Quantity of Gunpowder, which
dissolued into a Blacke water, 110. Pulses. A Cube, or Pellet of Yellow
Waxe, was taken, as much as halfe the Spirit of Wine, and set in the
Middest, and it burnt onely to the space of 87. Pulses. Mixed with the
Sixth Part of a spoonefull of Milke, it burnt to the space of 100.
Pulses; And the Milke was crudled. Mixed with the Sixth Part of a
spoonefull of Water, it burnt to the space of 86. Pulses; With an Equall
Quantity of Water, onely to the space of 4. Pulses. A small Pebble was
laid in the Middest; and the Spirit of Wine burnt to the space of 94.
Pulses. A Peece of Wood, of the Bignesse of an Arrow, and about a
Fingers length, was set vp in the Middest, and the Spirit of Wine burnt
to the space of 94. Pulses. So that the Spirit of Wine Simple, endured
the longest; And the Spirit of Wine with the Bay-salt, and the Equall
Quantity of Water, were the shortest.</p>
<p>Consider well, whether the more speedy Going forth of the flame,
becaused, by the Greater Vigour of the Flame in Burning; Or by the
Resistance of the Body mixed, and the Auersion thereof to take Flame:
Which will appeare by the Quantitie of the Spirit of Wine, that
remaineth after the Going out of the Flame. And it seemeth cleerely to
be the latter; For that the Mixture of Things least apt to burne, is the
Speediest in going out. And note, by the way, that Spirit of Wine
burned, till it goe out of it selfe, will burne no more; And tasteth
nothing so hot in the Mouth, as it did; No nor yet sowre, (as if it were
a degree towards Vinegar,) which Burnt Wine doth; but flat and dead.</p>
<p>Note, that in the Experiment of Wax aforesaid, the Wax dissolued in
the burning, and yet did not incorporate it selfe, with the Spirit of
Wine, to produce one Flame; but wheresoeuer the Wax floated, the Flame
forsooke it, till at last it spread all ouer, and put the Flame quite
out.</p>
<p>The Experiments of the Mixtures of the Spirit of Wine enflamed, are
Things of discouerie, and not of Vse: But now wee will speake of the
Continuance of Flames, such as are vsed for Candles, Lamps, or Tapers;
consisting of Inflammable Matters, and of a Wieke that prouoketh
Inflamation. And this importeth not only Discouerie, but also Vse and
Profit; For it is a great Sauing, in all such Lights, if they can be
made as faire and bright as others, and yet last longer. Wax Pure made
into a Candle, and Wax Mixed seuerally into Candle-stuffe, with the
Particulars that follow; (viz Water, Aqua-vitae, Milke, Bay-salt, Oyle,
Butter, Nitre, Brimstone, Saw-dust,) Euery of these bearing a Sixth Part
to the Wax; And euery of these Candles mixed, being of the same Weight
and Wieke with the Wax Pure, proued thus in the Burning, and Lasting.
The Swiftest in Consuming was that with Saw-dust; Which first burned
faire, till some part of the Candle was consumed; and the Dust gathered
about the Snaste; But then it made the Snaste bigge, and long, and to
burne duskishly, and the Candle wasted in halfe the time of the Wax
Pure. The next in Swiftnesse, were the Oyle, and Butter, which consumed,
by a Fifth part, swifter than the Pure Wax. Then followed in Swiftnesse
the Cleare Wax it selfe. Then the Bay-Salt, which lasted about an Eighth
part longer than the Cleare Wax. Then followed the Aqua-vita, which
lasted about a Fifth part longer than the Cleare Wax. Then followed the
Milke, and Water, with little difference from the Aqua-vita, but the
Water slowest. And in these foure last, the Wieke would spit forth
little Sparks. For the Nitre, it would not hold lighted aboue some
Twelue Pulses; But all the while it would spit out Portions of Flame,
which afterwards would goe out into a vapour. For the Brimstone, it
would hold lighted, much about the same time with the Nitre; But then
after a little while, it would harden and cake about the Snaste; So that
the Mixture of Bay-Salt with Wax, will winne an Eighth part of the time
of lasting, and the Water a Fifth.</p>
<p>After the Seuerall Materialls were tried, Triall was likewise made of
seuerall Wickes; As of Ordinary Cotton; Sowing Thred; Rush; Silke;
Straw; and Wood. The Silke, Straw, and Wood, would flame a little, till
they came to the Wax, and then goe out: of the Other Three, the Thred
consumed faster than the Cotton, by a Sixth part of Time: The Cotton
next: Then the Rush consumed flower than the Cotton, by at least a third
part of time. For the Bignesse of the Flame, the Cotton, and Thred, cast
a Flame much alike; and the Rush much lesse, and dimmer. Quare, whether
Wood, and Wiekes both, as in Torches, consume faster, than the Wiekes
Simple?</p>
<p>We haue spoken of the Seuerall Materialls, and the Seuerall Wiekes:
But to the lasting of the Flame, it importeth also; Not only what the
Materiall is, but in the same Materiall, whether it be Hard, Soft, Old,
New, andandandandc. Good Housewines, to make their Candles burne the
longer, vse to lay them (one by one) in Bran, or Flower, which make them
harder, and so they Consume the flower: Insomuch, as by this meanes,
they will out-last other Candles, of the same Stuffe, almost Halfe in
Halfe. For Bran and Flower haue a Vertue to Harden: So that both Age,
and lying in the Bran, doth helpe to the Lasting. And wee see that Wax
Candles last longer than Tallow Candles, because Wax is more firme, and
hard.</p>
<p>The Lasting of Flame also dependeth vpon the easie Drawing of the
Nourishment; As we see in the Court of England, there is a Seruice which
they call All-night; which is (as it were) a great Cake of Wax, with the
Wieke in the Middest; whereby it commeth to passe, that the Wieke
fetcheth the Nourishment further off. Wee see also that Lamps last
longer, because the Vessell is farre broader, than the Bredth of a
Taper, or Candle.</p>
<p>Take a Turretted Lampe of Tinne, made in the forme of a Squire; The
Heighth of the Turret being thrice as much, as the length of the lower
part, whereupon the Lampe standeth: Make only one Hole in it, at the End
of the Returne furthest from the Turret. Reuerse it, and fill it full of
Oile, by that Hole; And then set it vpright againe; And put a Wieke in
at the Hole; And lighten it: You shall finde, that it will burne flow,
and a long time. Which is caused, (as was said last before,) for that
the Flame fetcheth the Nourishment a Farre off. You shall finde also,
that as the Oile wasteth, and descendeth, so the Top of the Turret, by
little and little, filleth with Aire; which is caused by the Rarefaction
of the Oile by the Heat. It were worthy the Obseruation, to make a Hole,
in the Top of the Turret, and to trie, when the Oile is almost consumed,
whether the Aire made of the Oile, if you put to it a Flame of a Candle,
in the letting of it forth, will Enflame. It were good also to haue the
Lampe made, not of Tinne, but of Glasse, that you may see how the
Vapour, or Aire gathereth, by degrees, in the Top.</p>
<p>A fourth Point, that importeth the lasting of the Flame, is the
Closenesse of the Aire, wherein the Flame burneth. Wee see, that if Wind
bloweth vpon a Candle, it wasteth apace. We see also, it lasteth longer
in a Lanthorne, than at large. And there are Traditions of Lamps, and
Candles, that haue burnt a very long time, in Caues, and Tombes.</p>
<p>A Fifth Point, that importeth the Lasting of the Flame, is the Nature
of the Aire, where the Flame burneth; whether it be Hot or Cold; Moist
or Drie. The Aire, if it be very Cold, irritateth the Flame, and maketh
it burne more fiercely; (As Fire scorcheth in Frostie weather;) And so
furthereth the Consumption. The Aire once heated, (I conceiue) maketh
the Flame burne more mildly, and so helpeth the Continuance. The Aire,
if it be Drie, is indifferent: The Aire, if it be Moist, doth in a
Degree quench the Flame: (As wee see Lights will goe out in the Dumps of
Mines:) And howsoeuer maketh it burne more dully: And so helpeth the
Continuance.</p>
<p>Burialls in Earth serue for Preseruation; And for Condensation; And
for Induration of Bodies. And if you intend Condensation, or Induration
you may burie the Bodies so, as Earth may touch them: As if you will
make Artificiall Porcellane, andandandandc. And the like you may doe for
Conseruation, if the Bodies be Hard, and Solid; As Clay, Wood,
andandandandc. But if you intend Preseruation of Bodies, more Soft and
Tender, then you must doe one of these two: Either you must put them in
Cases, whereby they may not touch the Earth; Or else you must vault the
Earth, whereby it may hang ouer them, and not touch them; For if the
Earth touch them, it will doe more hurt, by the Moisture, causing them
to putrifie, than good by the virtuall Cold, to conserue them; Except
the Earth be very Drie, and Sandie.</p>
<p>An Orenge, Limon, and Apple, wrapt in a Linnen Cloth, being buried
for a Forthnights Space, foure Foot deepe within the Earth, though it
were in a Moist Place, and a Rainie Time, yet came forth, no wayes
Mouldie, or Rotten, but were become a little harder than they were;
Otherwise fresh in their Colour; But their Iuyce somewhat flatted. But
with the Buriall of a Forthnight more they became Putrified.</p>
<p>A Bottle of Beere, buried in like manner, as before, became more
liuely, better tasted, and Clearer, than it was. And a Bottle of Wine in
like manner. A Bottle of Vinegar, so buried, came forth more liuely, and
more Odoriferous, smelling almost like a Violet. And after the whole
Moneths Buriall, all the Three came forth, as fresh and liuely, if not
better, than before.</p>
<p>It were a profitable Experiment, to presrue Orenges, Limons, and
Pomgranates, till Summer; For then their Price will be mightily
increased. This may be done, if you put them in a Pot or Vessell, well
couered, that the Moisture of the Earth come not at them; Or else by
putting them in a Conseruatorie of Snow. And generally, whosoeuer will
make Experiments of Cold, let him be prouided of three Things; A
Conseruatorie of Snow; A good large Vault, twenty foot at least vnder
the Ground; And a Deepe Well;</p>
<p>There hath beene a Tradition, that Pearle, and Cora-, and
TurchoisStone, that haue lost their Colours, may be recouered by Burying
in the Earth: Which is a thing of great profit, if it would sort: But
vpon Triall of Six Weekes Buriall, there followed no Effect. It were
good to trie it, in a Deepe Well; Or in a Conseruatory of Snow, where
the Cold may be more Constringent; And so make the Body more vnited, and
thereby more Resplendent.</p>
<p>Mens Bodier are heauier, and lesse disposed to Motion, when S — ther
— Winds blow, than when Northerne. The Cause is, for that when the
Southerne Winds blow, the Humours doe (in some Degree) melt, and waxe
fluide, and so flow into the Parts; As it is seene in Wood, and other
Bodies, which, when the Southerne Winds blow, doe swell. Besides, the
Motion and Actiuity of the Body consisteth chiefly in the Sinewes,
which, when the Southerne Wind bloweth, are more relaxe.</p>
<p>It is commonly seene, that more are Sick in the Summer, and more Dye
in the Winter; Except it be in Peslilent Diseases, which commonly raigne
in Summer, or Autumne. The Reason is, because Diseases are bred (indeed)
chiefly by Heat; But then they are Cured most by Sweat, and Purge; which
in the Summer commeth on, or is prouoked, more Easily: As for Pestilent
Diseases, the Reason why most Dye of them in Summer, is because they are
bred most in the Summer; For otherwise those that are touched are in
most Danger in the Winter.</p>
<p>The Generall Opinion is, that Yeares Hot and Moist, are most
Pestilent; Vpon the Superficiall Ground, that Heat and Moisture cause
Putrefaction. In England it is found not true; For, many times, there
haue beene great Plagues in Dry Yeares. Whereof the Cause may be, for
that Drought in the Bodies of Islanders, habituate to Moist Aires, doth
Exasperate the Humours, and maketh them more apt to Putrifie, or
Enflame: Besides, it tainteth the Waters (commonly,) and maketh them
lesse wholesome. And againe in Barbary, the Plagues breake vp in the
Summer-moneths, when the Weather is Hot and Dry.</p>
<p>Many Diseases, (both Epidemicall, and others,) breake forth at
Particular times. And the Cause is falsely imputed to the Constitution
of the Aire, at that time, when they breake forth, or raigne; whereas it
proc-edeth (indeed) from a Precedent Sequence, and Series of the Seasons
of the Yeare: And therefore Hippocrates, in his Prognosticks, doth make
good Obseruations, of the Diseases, that ensue vpon the Nature, of the
Precedent foure Seasons of the Yeare.</p>
<p>Triall hath beene made, with Earthen Bottles well stopped, hanged in
a Well of Twenty Fathome deepe, at the least; And some of the Bettles
haue beene let downe into the Water, some others haue hanged aboue,
within about a fathome of the Water; And the Liquours so tried haue
beene, Beere, (not New, but Ready for drinking,) and Wine, and Milke.
The Proofe hath beene, that both the Beere, and the Wine, (as well
within Water, as aboue,) haue not beene palled or deaded at all; But as
good, or somewhat better, than Bottles of the same Drinks, and
Stalenesse, kept in a Celler. But those which did hang aboue Water, were
apparently the best; And that Beere did flower a little; whereas that
vnder Water did not, though it were Fresh. The Milke sowred, and began
to Purrifie. Neuerthelosse it is true, that there is a Village neare
Blois, where in Deepe Canes they doe thicken Milke; In such sort, that
it becommeth very pleasant; Which was some Cause of this Triall of
Hanging Milke in the Well: But our proofe was naught; Neither doe I
know, whether that Milke in those Caues, be first boysed; It were good
therefore to try it with Milke Sodden, and with Creame; For that Milke
of it selfe is such a Compound Body, of Creame, Curds, and Whey, as it
is eas-ly Turned, and Dissolued. It were good also to try the Beere,
when it is in Wort, that it may be seene, whether the Hanging in the
Well, will Accelerate the Ripening and Clarifying of it.</p>
<p>Diuers, we see, doe Stut. The Cause may be, (in most,) the
Refrigeration of the Tongue; Whereby it is lesse apt to moue. And
therfore we see, that Naturalls doe generally Stut: And we see that in
those that Stut, if they drinke Wine moderately, they Stut lesse,
because it heateth: And so we see, that they that Stut, doe Stut more in
the first Offer to speake, than in Continuance; Because the Tongue is,
by Motion, somewhat heated. In some also, it may be, (though rarely,)
the Drinesse of the Tongue; which likewise maketh it lesse apt to moue,
as well as Cold; For it is an Affect that commeth to some Wise and Great
Men; As it did vnto Moses, who was Ling-epr apedita; And many Stutters
(we finde) are very Cholericke Men; Choler Enducing a Drinesse in the
Tongue.</p>
<p>Smells, and other Odours, are Sweeter in the Aire, at some Distance,
than neare the Nose; As hath beene partly touched heretofore. The Cause
is double: First the finer Mixture, or Incorporation of the Smell: For
we see that in Sounds likewise, they are Sweetest, when we cannot heare
euery Part by it selfe. The other Reason is, for that all Sweet Smells
haue ioyned with them, some Earthy or Crude Odours; And at some distance
the Sweet, which is the more Spirituall, is Perceiued; And the Earthy
reacheth not so farre.</p>
<p>Sweet Smells are most forcible, in Dry Substances, when they are
Broken; And so likewise in Orenges, or Limons, the Nipping of their
Rinde, giueth out their Smell more: And generally, when Bodies are Moued
or Stirred, though not Broken, they Smell more; As a SweetBagge waued.
The Cause is double: The one, for that there is a Greater Emission of
the Spirit, when Way is made: And this holdeth in the Breaking, Nipping,
or Crushing; It holdeth also, (in some Degree) in the Mouing: But in
this last, there is a Con-urrence of the Second Cause; Which is the
Impulsion of the Aire, that bringeth the Sent faster vpon vs.</p>
<p>The daintiest Smells of Flowers, are out of those Plants, whose
Leaues smell not; As Violets, Roses, Wall-flowers, Gilly-flowers,
Pinckes, Woodbines, Vine-flowers, Apple-Bloomes, Lime-Tree Bloomes,
Beane-Bloomes, andandandandc. The Cause is, for that where there is Heat
and strength enough in the Plant, to make the Leaues Odorate, there the
Smell of the Flower is rather Euanide and Weaker, than that of the
Leaues; As it is in Rose-Mary-Flowers, Lauender-Flowers, and
Sweet-Briar-Roses. But where there is lesse Heat, there the Spirit of
the Plant, is disgested and refined, and feuered from the Grosser Iuyce,
in the Esstorescence, and not before.</p>
<p>Most Odours Smell best, Broken or Crusht, as hath beene said; But
Flowers Pressed or Beaten, doe leese the Freshnesse and Sweetnesse of
their Odour. The Cause is, for that when they are Crushed, the Grosser
and more Earthy Spirit commeth out with the Finer, and troubleth it;
Whereas in stronger Odours there are no such Degrees of the Issue of the
Smell.</p>
<p>It is a Thing of very good Vse, to Discouer the Goodnesse of Waters,
The Taste, to those that Drinke Water onely, doth somewhat: But other
Experiments are more sure. First, try Waters by Weight; Wherein you may
finde some difference, though not much: And the Lighter you may account
the Better.</p>
<p>Secondly, try them by Boyling vpon an Equall Fire: And that which
consumeth away fastest, you may account the Best.</p>
<p>Thirdly, try them in Seuerall Bottles, or Open Vessels, Matches in
euery Thing else, and see which of them Last Longest, without Stench, or
Corruption. And that which holdeth Vnputrified longest, you may likewise
account the Best.</p>
<p>Fourthly, try them by Making Drinkes Stronger, or Smaller, with the
same Quantity of Mault; And you may conclude, that that Water, which
maketh the Stronger Drinke, is the more Concocted, and Nou-rishing;
though perhaps it be not so good for Medicinall vse. And such Water
(commonly) is the Water of Large and Nanigable Riuers: And likewise in
Large and Cleane Ponds of Standing Water: For vpon both them, the Sunne
hath more power, than vpon Fountaines, or Small Riuers. And I concelue
that Chalke-water is next them the best, for going furthest in Drinke:
For that also helpeth Concoction; So it be out of a Deepe Well; For then
it Cureth the Rawnesse of the Water; But Chalkie Water, towards the Top
of the Earth, is too fretting; As it appeareth in Laundry of Cloaths,
which weare out apace, if you vse such Waters.</p>
<p>Fifthly, The Houswiues doe finde a Difference in Waters, for the
Bearing, or Not Bearing of Soape: And it is likely that the more Fat
Water will beare Soape best; For the Hungry Water doth kill the Vnctuous
Nature of the Soape.</p>
<p>Sixthly, you may make a Iudgement of Waters, according to the Place,
whence they Spring, or Come: The Rain-Water is, by the Physitians,
esteemed the Finest, and the best; But yet it is said to putrifie
soonest; which is likely, because of the Finenesse of the Spirit: And in
Conseruatories of Raine-water, (such as they haue in Venice,
andandandandc.) they are and not so Choice waters; The worse, (perhaps,)
because they are Couered aloft, and kept from the Sunne. Snow-water is
held vnwholesome; In so much as the People, that dwell at the Foot of
the SnowMountaines, or otherwise vpon the Ascent, (especially the
Women,) by drinking of Snow-water, haue great Bagges hanging vnder their
Throats. Well-water, except it be vpon Chalke, or a very plentifull
Spring, maketh Meat Red; which is an ill Signe. Springs on the Tops of
High-Hills are the best: For both they seeme to haue a Lightnesse, and
Appetite of Mounting; And besides they are most pure and Vnmingled; And
againe are more Percolated thorow a great Space of Earth. For Waters in
Valleyes, ioyne in effect vnder Ground with all Waters of the same
Leuell; Whereas Springs, on the Tops of Hills, passe thorow a great
deale of Pure Earth, with lesse Mixture of other Waters.</p>
<p>Seuenthly, Iudgement may be made of Waters by the Soyle whereupon the
Water runneth; As Pebble is the Cleanest, and best tasted; And next to
that Clay-water; And Thirdly, Water vpon Chalke; Fourthly that vpon
Sand; And Worst of all vpon Mudde. Neither may you trust Waters that
Taste Sweet, For they are commonly found in Rising Grounds of great
Cities; which must needs take in a great deale of Filth.</p>
<p>In Peru, and diuers Parts of the West Indies, though vnder the Line,
the Heats are not so Intolerable, as they be in Barbary, and the Skirts
of the Torrid Zone. The Causes are, First the Great Brizes, which the
Motion of the Aire in great Circles, (such as are vnder the Girdle of
the World,) produceth; Which doe refrigerate; And therefore in those
Parts Noone is nothing so hot, when the Brizes are great, as about Nine
or Ten of the Clocke in the Fore-Noone. Another Cause is, for that the
Length of the Night, and the Dewes thereof, doe compense the Heat of the
Day. A third Cause is the Stay of the Sunne; Not in Respect of Day and
Night, (for that wee spake of before,) but in Respect of the Season; For
vnder the Line, the Sunne crosseth the Line, and maketh two Summers, and
two Winters; But in the Skirts of the Torrid Zone, it doubleth, and
goeth backe againe, and so maketh one Long Summer.</p>
<p>The Heat of the Sunne maketh Men Blacke in some Countries, as in
AEthiopia, and Ginny, andandandandc.Fire doth it not, as wee see in
GlasseMen, that are continually about the Fire. The Reason may be,
because Fire doth licke vp the Spirits, and Bloud of the Body, so as
they Exhale; So that it euer maketh Men looke Pale, and Sallow; But the
Sunne, which is a Gentler Heat, doth but draw the Bloud to the Outward
Parts; And rather Concooteth it, than Soaketh it; And therefore wee see
that all AEthiapes are Fleshy, and Plumpe, and haue great Lips; All
which betoken Moisture retained, and not drawne out. Wee see also, that
the Negroes are bred in Countries that haue Plenty of Water, by Riuers,
or otherwise: For Meroe, which was the Metropolis of AEthiopia, was vpon
a great Lake: And Congo, where the Negroes are, is full of Riuers. And
the Confines of the Riuer Niger, where the Negroes also are, are well
watered: And the Region about Capo Verde, is likewise Moist, in so much
as it is pestilent through Moisture: But the Countries of the Abyssenes,
and Barbary, and Peru. where they are Tawney, and Oliuaster, and Pale,
are generally more Sandy, and Dry. As for the AEthiopes, as they are
Plumpe, and Fleshy; So (it may bee) they are Sanguine, and ruddy
Coloured, if their blacke Skinne would suffer it to be seene.</p>
<p>Some Creatures doe moue a good while after their Head is off; As
Birds; Some a very little time; As Men, and all beasts; Some moue,
though cut in feuerall Pieces; As Snakes, Eeles, Wormes, Flies,
andandandandc. First therefore it is certaine, that the Immediate Cause
of Death, is the Resolution or Extinguishment of the Spirits; And that
the Destruction or Corruption of the Organs, is but the Mediate Cause.
But some Organs are so peremptorily necessary, that the Extinguishment
of the Spirits doth speedily follow; But yet so, as there is an Interim
of a Small Time. It is reported by one of the Ancients, of credit, that
a Sacrificed Beast hath lowed, after the Heart hath beene feuered; And
it is a Report also of Credit, that the Head of a Pigge hath beene
opened, and the Braine put into the Palme of a Mans hand, trembling,
without breaking any part of it, or feuering it from the Marrow of the
Back-bone; During which time the Pigge hath beene, in all appearance,
starke dead, and without Motion; And after a small Time the Braine hath
beene replaced, and the Skull of the Pigge closed, and the Pigge hath a
little after gone about. And certaine it is, that an Eye vpon Reuenge
hath beene thrust forth, so as it hanged a pretty distance by the
Visuall Nerue; And during that time the Eye hath beene without any Power
of Sight; And yet after (being replaced) recouered Sight. Now the
Spirits are chiefly in the Head, and Cells of the Braine which in Men,
and Beasts are Large; And therefore, when the Head is off, they moue
little or Nothing. But Birds haue small Heads, and therefore the Spirits
are a little more dispersed in the Sinewes, whereby Motion remaineth in
them a little longer; In so much as it is Extant in Story, that an
Emperour of Rome, to shew the Certainty of his Hand, did Shoote a great
Forked Arrow at an Estrich, as shee ranne swiftly vpon the Stage, and
strooke off her Head; And yet shee continued the Race, a little way,
with the Head off. As for Wormes, and Flies, and Eeles, the Spirits are
diffused almost all ouer; And therefore they moue in their Seuerall
Pieces.</p>
