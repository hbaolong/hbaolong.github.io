<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>Of the errors of such as have descended and applied themselves to
experience, and attempted to induce knowledge upon particulars. That
they have not had the resolution and strength of mind to free themselves
wholly from Anticipations, but have made a confusion and intermixture of
Anticipations and observations, and so vanished. That if any have had
the strength of mind generally to purge away and discharge all
Anticipations, they have not had that greater and double strength and
patience of mind, as well to repel new Anticipations after the view and
search of particulars, as to reject old which were in their mind before;
but have from particulars and history flown up to principles without the
mean degrees, and so framed all the middle generalities or axioms, not
by way of scale or ascension from particulars, but by way of derivation
from principles; whence hath issued the infinite chaos of shadows and
notions, wherewith both books and minds have been hitherto, and may be
yet hereafter much more pestered. That in the course of those
derivations, to make them yet the more unprofitable, they have used when
any light of new instance opposite to any assertion appeared, rather to
reconcile the instance than to amend the rule. That if any have had or
shall have the power and resolution to fortify and inclose his mind
against all Anticipations, yet if he have not been or shall not be
cautioned by the full understanding of the nature of the mind and spirit
of man, and therein of the seats, pores and passages both of knowledge
and error, he hath not been nor shall not be possibly able to guide or
keep on his course aright. That those that have been conversant in
experience and observation have used, when they have intended to
discover the cause of any effect, to fix their consideration narrowly
and exactly upon that effect itself with all the circumstances thereof,
and to vary the trial thereof as many ways as can be devised; which
course amounteth but to a tedious curiosity, and ever breaketh off in
wondering and not in knowing; and that they have not used to enlarge
their observation to match and sort that effect with instances of a
diverse subject, which must of necessity be before any cause be found
out. That they have passed over the observation of instances vulgar and
ignoble, and stayed their attention chiefly upon instances of mark;
whereas the other sort are for the most part more significant and of
better height and information. That every particular that worketh any
effect is a thing compounded (more or less) of diverse single natures,
(more manifest and more obscure,) and that it appeareth not to whether
of the natures the effect is to be ascribed, and yet notwithstanding
they have taken a course without breaking particulars and reducing them
by exclusions and inclusions to a definite point, to conclude upon
inductions in gross, which empirical course is no less vain than the
scholastical. That all such as have sought action and work out of their
inquiry have been hasty and pressing to discover some practices for
present use, and not to discover Axioms, joining with them the new
assignations as their sureties. That the forerunning of the mind to
frame recipes upon Axioms at the entrance, is like Atalanta’s golden
ball that hindereth and interrupteth the course, and is to be inhibited
till you have ascended to a certain stage and degree of generalities;
which forbearance will be liberally recompensed in the end; and that
chance discovereth new inventions by one and one, but science by knots
and clusters. That they have not collected sufficient quantity of
particulars, nor them in sufficient certainty and subtilty, nor of all
several kinds, nor with those advantages and discretions in the entry
and sorting which are requisite; and of the weak manner of collecting
natural history which hath been used. Lastly that they had no knowledge
of the formulary of interpretation, the work whereof is to abridge
experience and to make things as certainly found out by Axiom in short
time, as by infinite experiences in ages.</p>
