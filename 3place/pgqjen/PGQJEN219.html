<h4 id="section">82</h4>
<p>And as men have misplaced the end and goal of the sciences, so again,
even if they had placed it right, yet they have chosen a way to it which
is altogether erroneous and impassable. And an astonishing thing it is
to one who rightly considers the matter, that no mortal should have
seriously applied himself to the opening and laying out of a road for
the human understanding direct from the sense, by a course of experiment
orderly conducted and well built up, but that all has been left either
to the mist of tradition, or the whirl and eddy of argument, or the
fluctuations and mazes of chance and of vague and ill-digested
experience. Now let any man soberly and diligently consider what the way
is by which men have been accustomed to proceed in the investigation and
discovery of things, and in the first place he will no doubt remark a
method of discovery very simple and inartificial, which is the most
ordinary method, and is no more than this. When a man addresses himself
to discover something, he first seeks out and sets before him all that
has been said about it by others; then he begins to meditate for
himself; and so by much agitation and working of the wit solicits and as
it were evokes his own spirit to give him oracles; which method has no
foundation at all, but rests only upon opinions and is carried about
with them.</p>
<p>Another may perhaps call in logic to discover it for him, but that
has no relation to the matter except in name. For logical invention does
not discover principles and chief axioms, of which arts are composed,
but only such things as appear to be consistent with them. For if you
grow more curious and importunate and busy, and question her of
probations and invention of principles or primary axioms, her answer is
well known; she refers you to the faith you are bound to give to the
principles of each separate art.</p>
<p>There remains simple experience which, if taken as it comes, is
called accident; if sought for, experiment. But this kind of experience
is no better than a broom without its band, as the saying is — a mere
groping, as of men in the dark, that feel all round them for the chance
of finding their way, when they had much better wait for daylight, or
light a candle, and then go. But the true method of experience, on the
contrary, first lights the candle, and then by means of the candle shows
the way; commencing as it does with experience duly ordered and
digested, not bungling or erratic, and from it educing axioms, and from
established axioms again new experiments; even as it was not without
order and method that the divine word operated on the created mass. Let
men therefore cease to wonder that the course of science is not yet
wholly run, seeing that they have gone altogether astray, either leaving
and abandoning experience entirely, or losing their way in it and
wandering round and round as in a labyrinth. Whereas a method rightly
ordered leads by an unbroken route through the woods of experience to
the open ground of axioms.</p>
