<h4 id="section">48</h4>
<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the twenty-fourth place
Instances of Strife, which I also call Instances of Predominance. These
indicate the mutual predominance and subjection of virtues: which of
them is stronger and prevails, which of them is weaker and gives way.
For the motions and efforts of bodies are compounded, decomposed, and
complicated, no less than the bodies themselves. I will therefore first
propound the principal kinds of motions or active virtues in order that
we may be able more clearly to compare them together in point of
strength, and thereby to point out and designate more clearly the
instances of strife and predominance.</p>
<p>Let the first motion be that motion of resistance in matter which is
inherent in each several portion of it, and in virtue of which it
absolutely refuses to be annihilated. So that no fire, no weight or
pressure, no violence, no length of time can reduce any portion of
matter, be it ever so small, to nothing, but it will ever be something,
and occupy some space; and, to whatever straits it may be brought, will
free itself by changing either its form or its place; or if this may not
be, will subsist as it is; and will never come to such a pass as to be
either nothing or nowhere. This motion the Schoolmen (who almost always
name and define things rather by effects and incapacities than by inner
causes) either denote by the axiom “two bodies cannot be in one place,”
or call “the motion to prevent penetration of dimensions.” Of this
motion it is unnecessary to give examples, as it is inherent in every
body.</p>
<p>Let the second motion be what I call motion of connection, by which
bodies do not suffer themselves to be separated at any point from
contact with another body, as delighting in mutual connection and
contact. This motion the Schoolmen call “motion to prevent a vacuum,” as
when water is drawn up by suction or in a pump; the flesh by cupping
glasses; or when water stops without running out in perforated jars
unless the mouth of the jar be opened to let in the air; and in
numberless instances of a similar kind.</p>
<p>Let the third motion be what I call motion of liberty, by which
bodies strive to escape from preternatural pressure or tension and to
restore themselves to the dimensions suitable to their nature. Of this
motion also we have innumerable examples, such as (to speak first of
escape from pressure) the motion of water in swimming, of air in flying,
of water in rowing, of air in the undulations of winds, of a spring in
clocks — of which we have also a pretty instance in the motion of the
air compressed in children’s popguns, when they hollow out an alder twig
or some such thing and stuff it up at both ends with a piece of pulpy
root or the like, and then with a ramrod thrust one of the roots or
whatever the stuffing be toward the other hole, from which the root at
the further end is discharged with a report, and that before it is
touched by the nearer root or the ramrod. As for bodies escaping from
tension, this motion displays itself in air remaining in glass eggs
after suction; in strings, in leather and in cloth, which recoil after
tension, unless it has gained too great strength by continuance; and in
similar phenomena. This motion the Schoolmen refer to under the name of
“motion in accordance with the form of the element”; an injudicious name
enough, since it is a motion which belongs not only to fire, air, and
water, but to every variety of solid substance, as wood, iron, lead,
cloth, parchment, etc.; each of which bodies has its own proper limit of
dimension out of which it cannot easily be drawn to any considerable
extent. But since this motion of liberty is of all the most obvious, and
is of infinite application, it would be a wise thing to distinguish it
well and clearly. For some very carelessly confuse this motion with the
two former motions of resistance and connection, the motion, that is, of
escape from pressure with the motion of resistance; of escape from
tension with the motion of connection — just as if bodies when
compressed yield or expand, that there may not ensue penetration of
dimensions; and, when stretched, recoil and contract, that there may not
ensue a vacuum. Whereas if air when compressed had a mind to contract
itself to the density of water, or wood to the density of stone, there
would be no necessity for penetration of dimensions, yet there might be
a far greater compression of these bodies than they ever do actually
sustain. In the same way, if water had a mind to expand to the rarity of
air, or stone to the rarity of wood, there would be no need for a vacuum
to ensue, and yet there might be effected a far greater extension of
these bodies than they ever do actually sustain. Thus the matter is
never brought to a penetration of dimensions or to a vacuum, except in
the extreme limits of condensation and rarefaction, whereas the motions
of which I speak stop far short of these limits, and are nothing more
than desires which bodies have for preserving themselves in their
consistencies (or, if the Schoolmen like, in their forms), and not
suddenly departing therefrom unless they be altered by gentle means, and
with consent. But it is far more necessary (because much depends upon
it) that men should know that violent motion (which we call mechanical,
but which Democritus, who in expounding his primary motions is to be
ranked even below second-rate philosophers, called motion of stripe) is
nothing more than this motion of liberty, that is, of escape from
compression to relaxation. For either in a mere thrust, or in flight
through the air, there occurs no movement or change of place until the
parts of the body moved are acted upon and compressed by the impelling
body more than their nature will bear. Then, indeed, when each part
pushes against the next, one after the other, the whole is moved. And it
not only moves forward, but revolves at the same time, the parts seeking
in that way also to free themselves or to distribute the pressure more
equally. And so much for this motion.</p>
<p>Let the fourth motion be that to which I have given the name of the
motion of matter, which is in some sort the converse of the last named
motion. For in the motion of liberty bodies dread, loathe, and shun a
new dimension, or a new sphere, or new expansion or contraction (which
are all names for the same thing), and strive with all their might to
recoil, and recover their old consistency. On the contrary, in this
motion of matter bodies desire a new sphere or dimension and aspire
thereto readily and quickly, and sometimes, as in the case of gunpowder,
with most violent effort. Now the instruments of this motion, not indeed
the sole, but the most potent, or at any rate the most common, are heat
and cold. For instance, air, if expanded by tension, as by suction in
glass eggs, labors under a strong desire to recover itself. But if heat
be applied, it longs, on the contrary, to expand, and desires a new
sphere and passes into it readily as into a new form (so they phrase
it); and after a certain degree of expansion cares not to return, unless
invited thereto by the application of cold, which is not a return, but a
renewed transmutation. In the same way water, if made to contract by
pressure, resists and wishes to become such as it was, that is, larger.
But if there intervene intense and continued cold, it changes itself
spontaneously and gladly to the density of ice; and if the cold be
continued long, without interruption from heat, as in grottoes and
caverns of some depth, it turns to crystal or some similar material and
never recovers its form.</p>
<p>Let the fifth motion be the motion of continuity, by which I do not
mean simple and primary continuity with some other body (for that is the
motion of connection), but self-continuity in a given body. For it is
most certain that all bodies dread a solution of continuity, some more,
some less, but all to a certain extent. For while in hard bodies, as
steel or glass, the resistance to discontinuity is exceedingly strong,
even in liquids, where it seems to disappear or at all events to be very
feeble, it is not altogether absent but is certainly there, though in
its lowest degree of power, and betrays itself in very many experiments
as in bubbles, in the roundness of drops, in the thin threads of
droppings from roofs, in the tenacity of glutinous bodies, and the like.
But most of all does this appetite display itself if an attempt be made
to extend the discontinuity to minute fragments. For in a mortar, after
a certain amount of pulverization, the pestle produces no further
effect; water does not penetrate into minute chinks; even air itself,
notwithstanding its subtlety, does not suddenly pass through the pores
of solid vessels but only after long insinuation.</p>
<p>Let the sixth motion be that which I call motion for gain, or motion
of want. It is that by which bodies, when placed among quite
heterogeneous and hostile bodies, if they find an opportunity of
escaping from these and uniting themselves to others more cognate
(though these others be such as have no close union with them) do
nevertheless embrace the latter and choose them as preferable; and seem
to view this connection in the light of a gam (whence the term), as
though they stood in need of such bodies. For instance, gold or any
other metal in the leaf does not like the surrounding air. If therefore
it meet with any thick tangible body (as a finger, paper, what you will)
it instantly sticks to it and is not easily torn away. So too paper,
cloth, and the like do not agree well with the air which is lodged in
their pores. They are therefore glad to imbibe water or other moisture
and eject the air. A piece of sugar too, or a sponge, if dipped at one
end in water or wine, while the other stands out far above the surface,
draws the water or the wine gradually upward.</p>
<p>Hence we derive an excellent rule for opening and dissolving bodies.
For (to say nothing of corrosives and strong waters which open for
themselves a way) if there can be found a body proportioned to and more
in harmony and affinity with a given solid body than that with which it
is as of necessity mixed, the solid body immediately opens and relaxes
itself, and shutting out or ejecting the latter, receives the former
into itself. Nor does this motion for gain act or exist only in
immediate contact. For electricity (of which Gilbert and others after
him have devised such stories) is nothing else than the appetite of a
body when excited by gentle friction — an appetite which does not well
endure the air but prefers some other tangible body, if it be found near
at hand.</p>
<p>Let the seventh motion be what I call the motion of the greater
congregation, by which bodies are carried toward masses of a like nature
with themselves — heavy bodies to the globe of the earth, light to the
compass of the heaven. This the Schoolmen have denoted by the name of
natural motion from superficial considerations; either because there was
nothing conspicuous externally which could produce such motion (and
therefore they supposed it to be innate and inherent in things
themselves), or perhaps because it never ceases. And no wonder; for the
earth and heaven are ever there, whereas the causes and origins of most
other motions are sometimes absent, sometimes present. Accordingly this
motion, because it ceases not but when others cease is felt instantly,
they deem perpetual and proper, all others adscititious. This motion,
however, in point of fact is sufficiently weak and dull, being one
which, except in bodies of considerable bulk, yields and succumbs to all
other motions, as long as they are in operation. And though this motion
has so filled men’s thoughts as to have put all others almost out of
sight, yet it is but little that they know about it, being involved in
many errors with regard to it.</p>
<p>Let the eighth motion be the motion of the lesser congregation, by
which the homogeneous parts in a body separate themselves from the
heterogeneous and combine together; by which also entire bodies from
similarity of substance embrace and cherish each other, and sometimes
are attracted and collected together from a considerable distance; as
when in milk, after it has stood a while, the cream rises to the top,
while in wine the dregs sink to the bottom. For this is not caused by
the motion of heaviness and lightness only, whereby some parts rise up
and some sink down, but much more by a desire of the homogeneous parts
to come together and unite in one.</p>
<p>Now this motion differs from the motion of want in two points. One is
that in the latter there is the stronger stimulus of a malignant and
contrary nature, whereas in this motion (provided there be nothing to
hinder or fetter it) the parts unite from friendship even in the absence
of a foreign nature to stir up strife. The other point is that the union
is here closer and, as it were, with greater choice. In the former, if
only the hostile body be avoided, bodies not closely related come
together, whereas in the latter, substances are drawn together by the
tie of close relationship and, as it were, combine into one. And this
motion resides in all composite bodies and would readily show itself
were it not bound and restrained by other appetites and necessities in
the bodies which interfere with the union in question.</p>
<p>Now the binding of this motion takes place generally in three ways:
by the torpor of bodies; by the check of a dominant body; and by
external motions. Now, for the torpor of bodies, it is certain that
there resides in tangible substances a certain sluggishness, more or
less, and an aversion from change of place; insomuch that, unless they
be excited, they had rather remain as they are than change for the
better. Now this torpor is shaken off by the help of three things:
either by heat, or by the eminent virtue of some cognate body, or by
lively and powerful motion. And as for the help of heat, it is for this
reason that heat has been denned to be “that which separates
Heterogeneous and congregates Homogeneous parts”; a definition of the
Peripatetics justly derided by Gilbert, who says it is much the same as
if a man were to be denned as that which sows wheat and plants vines —
for that it is, a definition simply by effects, and those particular.
But the definition has a worse fault, inasmuch as these effects, such as
they are, arise not from a peculiar property of heat, but only
indirectly (for cold does the same, as I shall afterwards show); being
caused by the desire of homogeneous parts to unite, heat simply aiding
to shake off the torpor which had previously bound the desire. As for
the help derived from the virtue of a cognate body, it is well seen in
an armed magnet which excites in iron the virtue of detaining iron by
similarity of substance, the torpor of the iron being cast off by the
virtue of the magnet. And as for help derived from motion, it is shown
in wooden arrows, having their points also of wood, which penetrate more
deeply into wood than if they were tipped with steel, owing to the
similarity of substance, the torpor of the wood being shaken off by the
rapid motion. Of these two experiments I have spoken also in the
Aphorism on Clandestine Instances.</p>
<p>That binding of the motion of the lesser congregation which is caused
by the restraint of a dominant body is seen in the resolution of blood
and urine by cold. For as long as those bodies are filled with the
active spirit which, as lord of the whole, orders and restrains the
several parts of whatsoever sort, so long the homogeneous parts do not
meet together on account of the restraint. But as soon as the spirit has
evaporated, or been choked by cold, then the parts being freed from
restraint meet together in accordance with their natural desire. And
thus it happens that all bodies which contain an eager spirit (as salts
and the like) remain as they are, and are not resolved, owing to the
permanent and durable restraint of a dominant and commanding spirit.</p>
<p>That binding of the motion of lesser congregation which is caused by
external motion is most conspicuous in the shaking of bodies to prevent
putrefaction. For all putrefaction depends on the assembling together of
homogeneous parts, whence there gradually ensues the corruption of the
old form, as they call it, and the generation of a new. For
putrefaction, which paves the way for the generation of a new form, is
preceded by a dissolution of the old, which is itself a meeting together
of homogeneous parts. That, indeed, if not impeded, is simple
resolution. But if it be met by various obstacles there follow
putrefactions, which are the rudiments of a new generation. But if
(which is the present question) a frequent agitation be kept up by
external motion, then indeed this motion of uniting (which is a delicate
and tender one, and requires rest from things without) is disturbed and
ceases, as we see happen in numberless instances. For example, the daily
stirring or flowing of water prevents it from putrefying; winds keep off
pestilence in the air; corn turned and shaken in the granary remains
pure; all things, in short, that are shaken outwardly are the slower to
putrefy inwardly.</p>
<p>Lastly, I must not omit that meeting of the parts of bodies which is
the chief cause of induration and desiccation. For when the spirit, or
moisture turned to spirit, has escaped from some porous body (as wood,
bone, parchment, and the like), then the grosser parts are with stronger
effort drawn and collected together; whence ensues induration or
desiccation, which I take to be owing not so much to the motion of
connection to prevent a vacuum as to this motion of friendship and
union.</p>
<p>As for the meeting of bodies from a distance, that is a rare
occurrence, and yet it exists in more cases than are generally observed.
We have illustrations of it when bubble dissolves bubble; when medicines
draw humors by similarity of substance; when the chord of one violin
makes the chord of another sound a unison, and the like. I suspect also
that this motion prevails in the spirits of animals, though it be
altogether unknown. At any rate it exists conspicuously in the magnet
and magnetized iron. And now that we are speaking of the motions of the
magnet, they ought to be carefully distinguished. For there are four
virtues or operations in the magnet which should not be confounded but
kept apart, although the wonder and admiration of men have mixed them up
together. The first is, the attraction of magnet to magnet, or of iron
to magnet, or of magnetized iron to iron. The second is its polarity,
and at the same time its declination. The third, its power of
penetrating through gold, glass, stone, everything. The fourth, its
power of communicating its virtue from stone to iron, and from iron to
iron, without communication of substance. In this place, however, I am
speaking only of the first of these virtues — that is, its attractive
power. Remarkable also is the motion of attraction between quicksilver
and gold, insomuch that gold attracts quicksilver, though made up into
ointments; and men who work amid the vapors of quicksilver usually hold
a piece of gold in their mouths to collect the exhalations which would
otherwise penetrate into their skulls and bones; by which also the piece
of gold is presently turned white. And so much for the motion of the
lesser congregation.</p>
<p>Let the ninth motion be the magnetic, which, though it be of the same
genus with the motion of the lesser congregation, yet if it operates at
great distances and on large masses, deserves a separate investigation,
especially if it begin not with contact, as most, nor lead to contact,
as all motions of congregation do, but simply raises bodies or makes
them swell, and nothing more. For if the moon raises the waters, or
makes moist things swell; if the starry heaven attracts planets to their
apogees; if the sun holds Venus and Mercury so that their elongations
never exceed a certain distance; these motions seem to fall properly
neither under the greater nor the lesser congregation, but to be of a
sort of intermediate and imperfect congregation, and therefore ought to
constitute a species by themselves.</p>
<p>Let the tenth motion be that of flight (a motion the exact opposite
of that of the lesser congregation), by which bodies from antipathy flee
from and put to flight hostile bodies, and separate themselves from them
or refuse to mingle with them. For although in some cases this motion
may seem to be an accident or a consequence of the motion of the lesser
congregation, because the homogeneous parts cannot meet without
dislodging and ejecting the heterogeneous, still it is a motion that
should be classed by itself and formed into a distinct species, because
in many cases the appetite of flight is seen to be more dominant than
the appetite of union.</p>
<p>This motion is eminently conspicuous in the excretions of animals and
not less in objects odious to some of the senses, especially the smell
and the taste. For a fetid odor is so rejected by the sense of smell as
to induce by consent in the mouth of the stomach a motion of expulsion;
a rough and bitter taste is so rejected by the palate or throat as to
induce by consent a shaking of the head and a shudder. But this motion
has place in other things also. It is observed in certain forms of
reaction; as in the middle region of the air, where the cold seems to be
the effect of the rejection of the nature of cold from the confines of
the heavenly bodies; as also the great heats and burnings which are
found in subterranean places appear to be rejections of the nature of
heat from the inner parts of the earth. For heat and cold, in small
quantities, kill one another. But if they be in large masses, and as it
were in regular armies, the result of the conflict is that they displace
and eject each other in turn. It is also said that cinnamon and other
perfumes retain their scent longer when placed near sinks and
foul-smelling places because they refuse to come out and mingle with
stenches. It is certain that quicksilver, which of itself would reunite
into an entire mass, is kept from doing so by spittle, hog’s lard,
turpentine, and the like, owing to the ill consent which its parts have
with such bodies, from which, when spread around them, they draw back,
so that their desire to fly from these intervening bodies is more
powerful than their desire of uniting with parts like themselves. And
this is called the mortification of quicksilver. The fact also that oil
does not mix with water is not simply owing to the difference of weight,
but to the ill consent of these fluids, as may be seen from the fact
that spirit of wine, though lighter than oil, yet mixes well enough with
water. But most of all is the motion of flight conspicuous in niter and
such like crude bodies, which abhor flame; as in gunpowder, quicksilver,
and gold. But the flight of iron from one pole of the magnet is well
observed by Gilbert to be not a flight strictly speaking, but a
conformity and meeting in a more convenient situation.</p>
<p>Let the eleventh motion be that of assimilation, or of
self-multiplication, or again of simple generation. By which I mean not
the generation of integral bodies, as plants or animals, but of bodies
of uniform texture. That is to say, by this motion such bodies convert
others which are related, or at any rate well disposed to them, into
their own substance and nature. Thus flame over vapors and oily
substances multiplies itself and generates new flame; air over water and
watery substances multiplies itself and generates new air; spirit,
vegetable and animal, over the finer parts as well of watery as of oily
substance in its food, multiplies itself and generates new spirit; the
solid parts of plants and animals, as the leaf, flower, flesh, bone, and
the like, severally assimilate new substance to follow and supply what
is lost out of the juices of their food. For let no one adopt the wild
fancy of Paracelsus who (blinded I suppose by his distillations) will
have it that nutrition is caused only by separation, and that in bread
and meat lie eye, nose, brain, liver; in the moisture of the ground,
root, leaf, and flower. For as the artist out of the rude mass of stone
or wood educes, by separation and rejection of what is superfluous,
leaf, flower, eye, nose, hand, foot, and the like, so, he maintains,
does Archæus, the internal artist, educe out of food by separation and
rejection the several members and parts of our body. But to leave such
trifles, it is most certain that the several parts, as well similar as
organic, in vegetables and animals do first attract with some degree of
selection the juices of their food, which are alike or nearly so for
all, and then assimilate them and turn them into their own nature. Nor
does this assimilation or simple generation take place only in animate
bodies, but inanimate also participate therein, as has been stated of
flame and air. Moreover, the non-vital spirit, which is contained in
every tangible animated substance, is constantly at work to digest the
coarser parts and turn them into spirit, to be afterwards discharged;
whence ensues diminution of weight and desiccation, as I have stated
elsewhere. Nor must we set apart from assimilation that accretion which
is commonly distinguished from alimentation; as when clay between stones
concretes and turns into a stony substance, or the scaly substance on
the teeth turns into a substance as hard as the teeth themselves, and so
on. For I am of opinion that there resides in all bodies a desire for
assimilation as well as for uniting with homogeneous substances; but
this virtue is bound, as is the other, though not by the same means. But
these means, as well as the way of escape from them, ought to be
investigated with all diligence because they pertain to the rekindling
of the vital power in old age. Lastly, it seems worthy of observation
that in the nine motions of which I have spoken bodies seem to desire
only the preservation of their nature, but in this tenth the propagation
of it.</p>
<p>Let the twelfth motion be that of excitation, a motion which seems to
belong to the genus of assimilation and which I sometimes call by that
name. For it is a motion diffusive, communicative, transitive, and
multiplicative, as is the other, and agreeing with it generally in
effect though differing in the mode of effecting and in the subject
matter. For the motion of assimilation proceeds, as it were, with
authority and command; it orders and forces the assimilated body to turn
into the assimilating. But the motion of excitation proceeds, so to
speak, with art and by insinuation, and stealthily, simply inviting and
disposing the excited body to the nature of the exciting. Again, the
motion of assimilation multiplies and transforms bodies and substances.
Thus more flame is produced, more air, more spirit, more flesh. But in
the motion of excitation virtues only are multiplied and transferred;
more heat being engendered, more magnetic power, more putrefying. This
motion is particularly conspicuous in heat and cold. For heat does not
diffuse itself, in heating a body, by communication of the original heat
but simply by exciting the parts of the body to that motion which is the
form of heat, of which I have spoken in the First Vintage concerning the
nature of heat. Consequently heat is excited far more slowly and with
far greater difficulty in stone or metal than in air, owing to the
unfitness and unreadiness of those bodies to receive the motion. So that
it is probable that there may exist materials in the bowels of the earth
which altogether refuse to be heated, because through their greater
condensation they are destitute of that spirit with which this motion of
excitation generally begins. In like manner the magnet endues iron with
a new disposition of its parts and a conformable motion, but loses
nothing of its own virtue. Similarly leaven, yeast, curd, and certain
poisons excite and invite a successive and continued motion in dough,
beer, cheese, or the human body, not so much by the force of the
exciting as by the predisposition and easy yielding of the excited
body.</p>
<p>Let the thirteenth motion be the motion of impression, which also is
of the same genus with the motion of assimilation, and is of diffusive
motions the most subtle. I have thought fit, however, to make a distinct
species of it, on account of a remarkable difference between it and the
two former. For the simple motion of assimilation actually transforms
the bodies themselves, so that you may take away the first mover, and
there will be no difference in what follows. For the first kindling into
flame, or the first turning into air, has no effect on the flame or air
next generated. In like manner, the motion of excitation continues,
after the first mover is withdrawn, for a very considerable time: as in
a heated body when the primary heat has been removed; in magnetized iron
when the magnet has been put away; in dough when the leaven has been
taken out. But the motion of impression, though diffusive and
transitive, seems to depend forever on the prime mover. So that if that
be taken away or cease to act, it immediately fails and comes to an end,
and therefore the effect must be produced in a moment, or at any rate in
a very brief space of time. The motions therefore of assimilation and
excitation I call motions of the generation of Jupiter, because the
generation continues; but this, the motion of the generation of Saturn,
because the birth is immediately devoured and absorbed. It manifests
itself in three things: in rays of light, in the percussions of sounds,
and in magnetism, as regards the communication of the influence. For if
you take away light, colors and its other images instantly disappear; if
you take away the original percussion and the vibration of the body
thence produced, the sound soon after dies away. For though sounds are
troubled as they pass through their medium by winds, as if by waves, yet
it must be carefully noted that the original sound does not last all the
time the resonance goes on. For if you strike a bell, the sound seems to
be continued for a good long time, whereby we might easily be led into
the error of supposing that during the whole of the time the sound is,
as it were, floating and hanging in the air, which is quite untrue. For
the resonance is not the identical sound, but a renewal of it, as is
shown by quieting or stopping the body struck. For if the bell be held
tight so that it cannot move, the sound at once comes to an end and
resounds no more — as in stringed instruments, if after the first
percussion the string be touched, either with the finger, as in the
harp, or with the quill, as in the spinet, the resonance immediately
ceases. Again, when the magnet is removed, the iron immediately drops.
The moon indeed cannot be removed from the sea, nor the earth from the
falling body, and therefore we can try no experiment in these cases; but
the principle is the same.</p>
<p>Let the fourteenth motion be the motion of configuration or position,
by which bodies seem to desire not union or separation, but position,
collocation, and configuration with respect to others. This motion is a
very abstruse one and has not been well investigated. In some cases,
indeed, it seems to be without a cause, though not, I believe, really
so. For if it be asked why the heavens revolve rather from east to west
than from west to east, or why they turn on poles placed near the Bears
rather than about Orion, or in any other part of heaven, such questions
seem to border on insanity, since these phenomena ought rather to be
received as results of observation, and merely positive facts. But
though there are no doubt in nature certain things ultimate and without
cause, this does not appear to me to be one of them, being caused in my
opinion by a certain harmony and consent of the universe which has not
yet fallen under observation. And if we admit the motion of the earth
from west to east, the same questions remain. For it also moves on
certain poles. And why, it might be asked, should these poles be placed
where they are, rather than anywhere else? Again the polarity,
direction, and declination of the magnet are referable to this motion.
There are also found in bodies natural as well as artificial, especially
in solids, a certain collocation and position of parts, and a kind of
threads and fibers, which ought to be carefully investigated since,
until they are understood, these bodies cannot be conveniently managed
or controlled. But those eddyings in fluids, by which when pressed,
before they can free themselves, they relieve each other that they may
all have a fair share of the pressure, belong more properly to the
motion of liberty.</p>
<p>Let the fifteenth motion be the motion of transition, or motion
according to the passages, by which the virtues of bodies are more or
less impeded or promoted by their media, according to the nature of the
body and of the acting virtues, and also of the medium. For one medium
suits light, another sound, another heat and cold, another magnetic
virtues, and so on.</p>
<p>Let the sixteenth motion be the royal (as I call it) or political
motion, by which the predominant and commanding parts in any body curb,
tame, subdue, and regulate the other parts, and compel them to unite,
separate, stand still, move, and range themselves, not in accordance
with their own desires, but as may conduce to the well-being of the
commanding part; so that there is a sort of government and polity
exerted by the ruling over the subject parts. This motion is eminently
conspicuous in the spirits of animals where, as long as it is in vigor,
it tempers all the motions of the other parts. It is found however in
other bodies in a lower degree; as I said of blood and urine, which are
not decomposed till the spirit which mixes and keeps together their
parts be discharged or quenched. Nor is this motion confined to spirits,
though in most bodies the spirits are masters owing to their rapid and
penetrating motion. But in bodies of greater density and not filled with
a lively and quickening spirit (such as there is in quicksilver and
vitriol), the thicker parts are the masters, so that unless this yoke
and restraint be by some expedient shaken off, there is very little hope
of any new transformation of such bodies. But let no one suppose that I
am forgetful of the point at issue, because while this series and
distribution of motions tends to nothing else but the better
investigation of their predominancy by instances of strife, I now make
mention of predominancy among the motions themselves. For in describing
this royal motion I am not treating of the predominancy of motions or
virtues, but of the predominancy of parts in bodies; such being the
predominancy which constitutes the peculiar species of motion in
question.</p>
<p>Let the seventeenth motion be the spontaneous motion of rotation, by
which bodies delighting in motion and favorably placed for it enjoy
their own nature, and follow themselves, not another body, and court (so
to speak) their own embraces. For bodies seem either to move without
limit, or to remain altogether at rest, or to tend to a limit at which,
according to their nature, they either revolve or rest. Those which are
favorably placed, if they delight in motion, move in a circle, with a
motion, that is, eternal and infinite. Those which are favorably placed,
and abhor motion, remain at rest. Those which are not favorably placed
move in a right line (as the shortest path) to consort with bodies of
their own nature. But this motion of rotation admits of nine differences
regarding 1. the center round which the bodies move; 2. the poles on
which they move; 3. their circumference or orbit, according to their
distance from the center; 4. their velocity, according to the greater or
less rapidity of their rotation; 5. the course of their motion, as from
east to west, or from west to east; 6. their declination from a perfect
circle by spiral lines more or less distant from their center; 7. their
declination from a perfect circle by spiral lines more or less distant
from their poles; 8. the greater or lesser distance of these spirals
from each other; 9. and lastly, the variation of the poles themselves,
if they be movable; which, however, has nothing to do with rotation
unless it be circular. This motion in common and long received opinion
is looked upon as the proper motion of heavenly bodies, though there is
a grave dispute with regard to it among some both of the ancients and of
the moderns, who have attributed rotation to the earth. But a juster
question perhaps arises upon this (if it be not past question), namely,
whether this motion (admitting that the earth stands still) is confined
to the heavens, and does not rather descend and communicate itself to
the air and waters. The motion of rotation in missiles, as in darts,
arrows, musket balls, and the like, I refer to the motion of
liberty.</p>
<p>Let the eighteenth motion be the motion of trepidation, to which, as
understood by astronomers, I do not attach much credit. But in searching
carefully everywhere for the appetites of natural bodies this motion
comes before us and ought, it seems, to constitute a species by itself.
It is a motion of what may be called perpetual captivity and occurs when
bodies that have not quite found their right place, and yet are not
altogether uneasy, keep forever trembling and stirring themselves
restlessly, neither content as they are nor daring to advance further.
Such a motion is found in the heart and pulses of animals, and must of
necessity occur in all bodies which so exist in a mean state between
conveniences and inconveniences that when disturbed they strive to free
themselves, and being again repulsed, are yet forever trying again.</p>
<p>Let the nineteenth and last motion be one which, though it hardly
answers to the name, is yet indisputably a motion; and let us call it
the motion of repose, or of aversion to move. It is by this motion that
the earth stands still in its mass while its extremities are moving
toward the middle — not to an imaginary center, but to union. By this
appetite also all bodies of considerable density abhor motion. Indeed,
the desire of not moving is the only appetite they have; and though in
countless ways they be enticed and challenged to motion, they yet, as
far as they can, maintain their proper nature. And if compelled to move,
they nevertheless seem always intent on recovering their state of rest
and moving no more. While thus engaged, indeed, they show themselves
active and struggle for it with agility and swiftness enough, as weary
and impatient of all delay. Of this appetite but a partial
representation can be seen, since here with us, from the subduing and
concocting power of the heavenly bodies, all tangible substances are not
only not condensed to their utmost, but are even mixed with some portion
of spirit.</p>
<p>Thus, then, have I set forth the species or simple elements of
motions, appetites, and active virtues, which are in nature most
general. And under these heads no small portion of natural science is
sketched out. I do not, however, mean to say that other species may not
be added, or that the divisions I have made may not be drawn more
accurately according to the true veins of nature, or reduced to a
smaller number. Observe, nevertheless, that I am not here speaking of
any abstract divisions, as if one were to say that bodies desire either
the exaltation or the propagation or the fruition of their nature; or
again, that the motions of things tend to the preservation and good
either of the universe, as resistance and connection; or of great
wholes, as the motions of the greater congregation, rotation, and
aversion to move; or of special forms, as the rest. For though these
assertions be true, yet unless they be defined by true lines in matter
and the fabric of nature, they are speculative and of little use.
Meanwhile, these will suffice and be of good service in weighing the
predominancies of virtues and finding out instances of strife, which is
our present object</p>
<p>For of the motions I have set forth some are quite invincible; some
are stronger than others, fettering, curbing, arranging them; some carry
farther than others; some outstrip others in speed; some cherish,
strengthen, enlarge, and accelerate others.</p>
<p>The motion of resistance is altogether adamantine and invincible.
Whether the motion of connection be so, I am still undecided. For I am
not prepared to say for certain whether or no there be a vacuum, either
collected in one place or interspersed in the pores of bodies. But of
one thing I am satisfied, that the reason for which a vacuum was
introduced by Leucippus and Democritus (namely, that without it the same
bodies could not embrace and fill sometimes larger and sometimes smaller
spaces) is a false one. For matter is clearly capable of folding and
unfolding itself in space, within certain limits, without the
interposition of a vacuum; nor is there in air two thousand times as
much of vacuity as there is in gold. which on their hypothesis there
should be. Of this I am sufficiently convinced by the potency of the
virtues of pneumatical bodies (which otherwise would be floating in
empty space like fine dust) and by many other proofs. As for the other
motions, they rule and are ruled in turn, in proportion to their vigor,
quantity, velocity, force of projection, and also to the helps and
hindrances they meet with.</p>
<p>For instance, there are some armed magnets that hold and suspend iron
of sixty times their own weight, so far does the motion of the lesser
prevail over the motion of the greater congregation; but if the weight
be increased, it is overcome. A lever of given strength will raise a
given weight, so far does the motion of liberty prevail over that of the
greater congregation; but if the weight be increased, it is overcome.
Leather stretches to a certain extent without breaking, so far does the
motion of continuity prevail over the motion of tension; but if the
tension be increased, the leather breaks and the motion of continuity is
overcome. Water runs out at a crack of a certain size, so far does the
motion of the greater congregation prevail over the motion of
continuity; but if the crack be smaller, it gives way, and the motion of
continuity prevails. If you charge a gun with ball and sulphur only, and
apply the match, the ball is not discharged, the motion of the greater
congregation overcoming in this case the motion of matter. But if you
charge with gunpowder, the motion of matter in the sulphur prevails,
being aided by the motions of matter and of flight in the niter. And so
of other cases. Instances of strife, therefore, which point out the
predominancies of virtues together with the manner and proportion in
which they predominate or give place, should be sought and collected
from all quarters with keen and careful diligence.</p>
<p>Nor should we examine less carefully the modes in which these motions
give way. That is to say, whether they stop altogether or whether they
continue to resist but are overpowered. For in bodies here with us there
is no real rest, either in wholes or in parts, but only in appearance.
And this apparent rest is caused either by equilibrium, or by absolute
predominancy of motions: by equilibrium, as in scales, which stand still
if the weights be equal; by predominancy, as in watering pots with holes
in them, where the water rests and is kept from falling out by the
predominancy of the motion of connection. But it should be observed, as
I have said, how far these yielding motions carry their resistance. For
if a man be pinned to the ground, tied hand and foot, or otherwise held
fast, and yet struggle to rise with all his might, the resistance is not
the less though it be unsuccessful. But the real state of the case (I
mean whether by predominancy the yielding motion is, so to speak,
annihilated, or rather whether a resistance is continued, though we
cannot see it) will perhaps, though latent in the conflicts of motions,
be apparent in their concurrence. For example, let trial be made in
shooting. See how far a gun will carry a ball straight, or as they say
point-blank, and then try whether, if it be fired upward, the stroke
will be feebler than when it is fired downward, where the motion of
gravity concurs with the blow.</p>
<p>Lastly, such canons of predominance as we meet with should be
collected; for instance, that the more common the good sought, the
stronger the motion. Thus the motion of connection, which regards
communion with the universe, is stronger than the motion of gravity,
which regards only communion with dense bodies. Again, that appetites
which aim at a private good seldom prevail against appetites which aim
at a more public good, except in small quantities — rules which I wish
held good in politics.</p>
