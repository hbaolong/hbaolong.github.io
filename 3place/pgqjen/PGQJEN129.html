<p>The fragment containing this catalogue (Parasceve — Day of
Preparation) was added to Bacon’s work on method, The New Logic (Novum
Organum), 1620. Besides completing his survey and classification of the
sciences (De Augmentis Scientiarum), 1623, he published a few separate
writings on topics in the catalogue — Winds, Life and Death, Tides, etc.
In 1627, a year after his death, appeared his much misunderstood work,
Sylva Sylvarum. He had found that the Latin word sylva meant stuff or
raw material, as well as a wood, and called this final work Sylva
Sylvarum, which I would translate, “Jungle of Raw Material.” He himself
referred to it as “an undigested heap of particulars”; yet he was
willing it should be published because “he preferred the good of men to
anything that might have relation to himself.” In it, following his
catalogue, he fulfilled the promise made in 1620, of putting nature and
the arts to question. Some of the problems suggested for investigation
are: congealing of air, turning air into water, the secret nature of
flame, motion of gravity, production of cold, nourishing of young
creatures in the egg or womb, prolongation of life, the media of sound,
infectious diseases, accelerating and preventing putrefaction,
accelerating and staying growth, producing fruit without core or seed,
production of composts and helps for ground, flying in the air.</p>
<p>In the New Atlantis, a work of imagination, Bacon had represented as
already achieved for mankind some of the benefits he wished for:
artificial metals, various cements, excellent dyes, animals for
vivisection and medical experiment, instruments which generate heat
solely by motion, artificial precious stones, conveyance of sound for
great distances and in tortuous lines, new explosives. “We imitate,”
says the guide in the Utopian land, “also flights of birds; we have some
degree of flying in the air; we have ships and boats for going under
water.” Bacon believed in honoring the great discoverers and inventors,
and advocated maintaining a calendar of inventions.</p>
<p>He was a fertile and stimulating thinker, and much of his great
influence arose from the comprehensiveness that led to his celebrated
classification of the sciences.</p>
