<p>But the more difficult and laborious the work is, the more ought it
to be discharged of matters superfluous. And therefore there are three
things upon which men should be warned to be sparing of their labor, as
those which will immensely increase the mass of the work and add little
or nothing to its worth.</p>
<p>First then, away with antiquities, and citations or testimonies of
authors, and also with disputes and controversies and differing opinions
— everything, in short, which is philological. Never cite an author
except in a matter of doubtful credit; never introduce a controversy
unless in a matter of great moment. And for all that concerns ornaments
of speech, similitudes, treasury of eloquence, and such like
emptinesses, let it be utterly dismissed. Also let all those things
which are admitted be themselves set down briefly and concisely, so that
they may be nothing less than words. For no man who is collecting and
storing up materials for ship building or the like, thinks of arranging
them elegantly, as in a shop, and displaying them so as to please the
eye; all his care is that they be sound and good, and that they be so
arranged as to take up as little room as possible in the warehouse. And
this is exactly what should be done here.</p>
<p>Secondly, that superfluity of natural histories in descriptions and
pictures of species, and the curious variety of the same, is not much to
the purpose. For small varieties of this kind are only a kind of sports
and wanton freaks of nature and come near to the nature of individuals.
They afford a pleasant recreation in wandering among them and looking at
them as objects in themselves, but the information they yield to the
sciences is slight and almost superfluous.</p>
<p>Thirdly, all superstitious stories (I do not say stories of
prodigies, when the report appears to be faithful and probable, but
superstitious stories) and experiments of ceremonial magic should be
altogether rejected. For I would not have the infancy of philosophy, to
which natural history is as a nursing mother, accustomed to old wives’
fables. The time will perhaps come (after we have gone somewhat deeper
into the investigation of nature) for a light review of things of this
kind, that if there remain any grains of natural virtue in these dregs,
they may be extracted and laid up for use. In the meantime they should
be set aside. Even the experiments of natural magic should be sifted
diligently and severely before they are received, especially those which
are commonly derived from vulgar sympathies and antipathies, with great
sloth and facility both of believing and inventing.</p>
<p>And it is no small thing to relieve natural history from the three
superfluities above mentioned, which would otherwise fill volumes. Nor
is this all. For in a great work it is no less necessary that what is
admitted should be written succinctly than that what is superfluous
should be rejected, though no doubt this kind of chastity and brevity
will give less pleasure both to the reader and the writer. But it is
always to be remembered that this which we are now about is only a
granary and storehouse of matters, not meant to be pleasant to stay or
live in, but only to be entered as occasion requires, when anything is
wanted for the work of the interpreter which follows.</p>
