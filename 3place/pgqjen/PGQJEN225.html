<h4 id="section">88</h4>
<p>Far more, however, has knowledge suffered from littleness of spirit
and the smallness and slightness of the tasks which human industry has
proposed to itself. And what is worst of all, this very littleness of
spirit comes with a certain air of arrogance and superiority.</p>
<p>For in the first place there is found in all arts one general device,
which has now become familiar — that the author lays the weakness of his
art to the charge of nature: whatever his art cannot attain he sets down
on the authority of the same art to be in nature impossible. And truly
no art can be condemned if it be judge itself. Moreover, the philosophy
which is now in vogue embraces and cherishes certain tenets, the purpose
of which (if it be diligently examined) is to persuade men that nothing
difficult, nothing by which nature may be commanded and subdued, can be
expected from art or human labor; as with respect to the doctrine that
the heat of the sun and of fire differ in kind, and to that other
concerning mixture, has been already observed. Which things, if they be
noted accurately, tend wholly to the unfair circumscription of human
power, and to a deliberate and factitious despair, which not only
disturbs the auguries of hope, but also cuts the sinews and spur of
industry, and throws away the chances of experience itself. And all for
the sake of having their art thought perfect, and for the miserable
vainglory of making it believed that whatever has not yet been
discovered and comprehended can never be discovered or comprehended
hereafter.</p>
<p>And even if a man apply himself fairly to facts, and endeavor to find
out something new, yet he will confine his aim and intention to the
investigation and working out of some one discovery and no more; such as
the nature of the magnet, the ebb and flow of the sea, the system of the
heavens, and things of this kind, which seem to be in some measure
secret, and have hitherto been handled without much success. Whereas it
is most unskillful to investigate the nature of anything in the thing
itself, seeing that the same nature which appears in some things to be
latent and hidden is in others manifest and palpable; wherefore in the
former it produces wonder, in the latter excites no attention; as we
find it in the nature of consistency, which in wood or stone is not
observed, but is passed over under the appellation of solidity without
further inquiry as to why separation or solution of continuity is
avoided; while in the case of bubbles, which form themselves into
certain pellicles, curiously shaped into hemispheres, so that the
solution of continuity is avoided for a moment, it is thought a subtle
matter. In fact, what in some things is accounted a secret has in others
a manifest and well-known nature, which will never be recognized as long
as the experiments and thoughts of men are engaged on the former
only.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, in mechanics old discoveries pass for new if
a man does but refine or embellish them, or unite several in one, or
couple them better with their use, or make the work in greater or less
volume than it was before, or the like.</p>
<p>Thus, then, it is no wonder if inventions noble and worthy of mankind
have not been brought to light, when men have been contented and
delighted with such trifling and puerile tasks, and have even fancied
that in them they have been endeavoring after, if not accomplishing,
some great matter.</p>
