<h4 id="proem">Proem</h4>
<p>Francis of Verulam reasoned thus with himself and judged it to be for
the interest of the present and future generations that they should be
made acquainted with his thoughts.</p>
<p>Being convinced that the human intellect makes its own difficulties,
not using the true helps which are at man’s disposal soberly and
judiciously — whence follows manifold ignorance of things, and by reason
of that ignorance mischiefs innumerable — he thought all trial should be
made, whether that commerce between the mind of man and the nature of
things, which is more precious than anything on earth, or at least than
anything that is of the earth, might by any means be restored to its
perfect and original condition, or if that may not be, yet reduced to a
better condition than that in which it now is. Now that the errors which
have hitherto prevailed, and which will prevail for ever, should (if the
mind be left to go its own way) either by the natural force of the
understanding or by help of the aids and instruments of logic, one by
one, correct themselves, was a thing not to be hoped for, because the
primary notions of things which the mind readily and passively imbibes,
stores up, and accumulates (and it is from them that all the rest flow)
are false, confused, and overhastily abstracted from the facts; nor are
the secondary and subsequent notions less arbitrary and inconstant;
whence it follows that the entire fabric of human reason which we employ
in the inquisition of nature is badly put together and built up, and
like some magnificent structure without any foundation. For while men
are occupied in admiring and applauding the false powers of the mind,
they pass by and throw away those true powers, which, if it be supplied
with the proper aids and can itself be content to wait upon nature
instead of vainly affecting to overrule her, are within its reach. There
was but one course left, therefore — to try the whole thing anew upon a
better plan, and to commence a total reconstruction of sciences, arts,
and all human knowledge, raised upon the proper foundations. And this,
though in the project and undertaking it may seem a thing infinite and
beyond all the powers of man, yet when it comes to be dealt with it will
be found sound and sober, more so than what has been done hitherto. For
of this there is some issue; whereas in what is now done in the matter
of science there is only a whirling round about, and perpetual
agitation, ending where it began. And although he was well aware how
solitary an enterprise it is, and how hard a thing to win faith and
credit for, nevertheless he was resolved not to abandon either it or
himself, nor to be deterred from trying and entering upon that one path
which is alone open to the human mind. For better it is to make a
beginning of that which may lead to something, than to engage in a
perpetual struggle and pursuit in courses which have no exit. And
certainly the two ways of contemplation are much like those two ways of
action, so much celebrated, in this — that the one, arduous and
difficult in the beginning, leads out at last into the open country,
while the other, seeming at first sight easy and free from obstruction,
leads to pathless and precipitous places.</p>
<p>Moreover, because he knew not how long it might be before these
things would occur to anyone else, judging especially from this, that he
has found no man hitherto who has applied his mind to the like, he
resolved to publish at once so much as he has been able to complete. The
cause of which haste was not ambition for himself, but solicitude for
the work; that in case of his death there might remain some outline and
project of that which he had conceived, and some evidence likewise of
his honest mind and inclination toward the benefit of the human race.
Certain it is that all other ambition whatsoever seemed poor in his eyes
compared with the work which he had in hand, seeing that the matter at
issue is either nothing or a thing so great that it may well be content
with its own merit, without seeking other recompense.</p>
<p>Epistle Dedicatory</p>
<p>TO OUR MOST GRACIOUS AND MIGHTY PRINCE AND LORD</p>
<p>JAMES,</p>
<p>BY THE GRACE OF GOD</p>
<p>OF GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND IRELAND KING, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH,
ETC.</p>
<p>Most Gracious and Mighty King,</p>
<p>Your Majesty may perhaps accuse me of larceny, having stolen from
your affairs so much time as was required for this work. I know not what
to say for myself. For of time there can be no restitution unless it be
that what has been abstracted from your business may perhaps go to the
memory of your name and the honor of your age; if these things are
indeed worth anything. Certainly they are quite new, totally new in
their very kind: and yet they are copied from a very ancient model, even
the world itself and the nature of things and of the mind. And to say
truth, I am wont for my own part to regard this work as a child of time
rather than of wit, the only wonder being that the first notion of the
thing, and such great suspicions concerning matters long established,
should have come into any man’s mind. All the rest follows readily
enough. And no doubt there is something of accident (as we call it) and
luck as well in what men think as in what they do or say. But for this
accident which I speak of, I wish that if there be any good in what I
have to offer, it may be ascribed to the infinite mercy and goodness of
God, and to the felicity of your Majesty’s times; to which as I have
been an honest and affectionate servant in my life, so after my death I
may yet perhaps, through the kindling of this new light in the darkness
of philosophy, be the means of making this age famous to posterity; and
surely to the times of the wisest and most learned of kings belongs of
right the regeneration and restoration of the sciences. Lastly, I have a
request to make — a request no way unworthy of your Majesty, and which
especially concerns the work in hand, namely, that you who resemble
Solomon in so many things — in the gravity of your judgments, in the
peacefulness of your reign, in the largeness of your heart, in the noble
variety of the books which you have composed — would further follow his
example in taking order for the collecting and perfecting of a natural
and experimental history, true and severe (unincumbered with literature
and book-learning), such as philosophy may be built upon — such, in
fact, as I shall in its proper place describe: that so at length, after
the lapse of so many ages, philosophy and the sciences may no longer
float in air, but rest on the solid foundation of experience of every
kind, and the same well examined and weighed. I have provided the
machine, but the stuff must be gathered from the facts of nature. May
God Almighty long preserve your Majesty!</p>
<p>Your Majesty’s</p>
<p>Most bounden and devoted Servant,</p>
<p>FRANCIS VERULAM,</p>
<p>Chancellor.</p>
