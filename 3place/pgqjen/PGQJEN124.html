<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>That the state of knowledge is not prosperous nor greatly advancing,
and that a way must be opened for the human understanding entirely
different from any hitherto known, and other helps provided, in order
that the mind may exercise over the nature of things the authority which
properly belongs to it.</p>
<p>It seems to me that men do not rightly understand either their store
or their strength, but overrate the one and underrate the other. Hence
it follows that either from an extravagant estimate of the value of the
arts which they possess they seek no further, or else from too mean an
estimate of their own powers they spend their strength in small matters
and never put it fairly to the trial in those which go to the main.
These are as the pillars of fate set in the path of knowledge, for men
have neither desire nor hope to encourage them to penetrate further. And
since opinion of store is one of the chief causes of want, and
satisfaction with the present induces neglect of provision for the
future, it becomes a thing not only useful, but absolutely necessary,
that the excess of honor and admiration with which our existing stock of
inventions is regarded be in the very entrance and threshold of the
work, and that frankly and without circumlocution stripped off, and men
be duly warned not to exaggerate or make too much of them. For let a man
look carefully into all that variety of books with which the arts and
sciences abound, he will find everywhere endless repetitions of the same
thing, varying in the method of treatment, but not new in substance,
insomuch that the whole stock, numerous as it appears at first view,
proves on examination to be but scanty. And for its value and utility it
must be plainly avowed that that wisdom which we have derived
principally from the Greeks is but like the boyhood of knowledge, and
has the characteristic property of boys: it can talk, but it cannot
generate, for it is fruitful of controversies but barren of works. So
that the state of learning as it now is appears to be represented to the
life in the old fable of Scylla, who had the head and face of a virgin,
but her womb was hung round with barking monsters, from which she could
not be delivered. For in like manner the sciences to which we are
accustomed have certain general positions which are specious and
flattering; but as soon as they come to particulars, which are as the
parts of generation, when they should produce fruit and works, then
arise contentions and barking disputations, which are the end of the
matter and all the issue they can yield. Observe also, that if sciences
of this kind had any life in them, that could never have come to pass
which has been the case now for many ages — that they stand almost at a
stay, without receiving any augmentations worthy of the human race,
insomuch that many times not only what was asserted once is asserted
still, but what was a question once is a question still, and instead of
being resolved by discussion is only fixed and fed; and all the
tradition and succession of schools is still a succession of masters and
scholars, not of inventors and those who bring to further perfection the
things invented. In the mechanical arts we do not find it so; they, on
the contrary, as having in them some breath of life, are continually
growing and becoming more perfect. As originally invented they are
commonly rude, clumsy, and shapeless; afterwards they acquire new powers
and more commodious arrangements and constructions, in so far that men
shall sooner leave the study and pursuit of them and turn to something
else than they arrive at the ultimate perfection of which they are
capable. Philosophy and the intellectual sciences, on the contrary,
stand like statues, worshipped and celebrated, but not moved or
advanced. Nay, they sometimes flourish most in the hands of the first
author, and afterwards degenerate. For when men have once made over
their judgments to others’ keeping, and (like those senators whom they
called Pedarii) have agreed to support some one person’s opinion, from
that time they make no enlargement of the sciences themselves, but fall
to the servile office of embellishing certain individual authors and
increasing their retinue. And let it not be said that the sciences have
been growing gradually till they have at last reached their full
stature, and so (their course being completed) have settled in the works
of a few writers; and that there being now no room for the invention of
better, all that remains is to embellish and cultivate those things
which have been invented already. Would it were so! But the truth is
that this appropriating of the sciences has its origin in nothing better
than the confidence of a few persons and the sloth and indolence of the
rest. For after the sciences had been in several perhaps cultivated and
handled diligently, there has risen up some man of bold disposition, and
famous for methods and short ways which people like, who has in
appearance reduced them to an art, while he has in fact only spoiled all
that the others had done. And yet this is what posterity likes, because
it makes the work short and easy, and saves further inquiry, of which
they are weary and impatient. And if any one take this general
acquiescence and consent for an argument of weight, as being the
judgment of Time, let me tell him that the reasoning on which he relies
is most fallacious and weak. For, first, we are far from knowing all
that in the matter of sciences and arts has in various ages and places
been brought to light and published, much less all that has been by
private persons secretly attempted and stirred; so neither the births
nor the miscarriages of Time are entered in our records. Nor, secondly,
is the consent itself and the time it has continued a consideration of
much worth. For however various are the forms of civil polities, there
is but one form of polity in the sciences; and that always has been and
always will be popular. Now the doctrines which find most favor with the
populace are those which are either contentious and pugnacious, or
specious and empty — such, I say, as either entangle assent or tickle
it. And therefore no doubt the greatest wits in each successive age have
been forced out of their own course: men of capacity and intellect above
the vulgar having been fain, for reputation’s sake, to bow to the
judgment of the time and the multitude; and thus if any contemplations
of a higher order took light anywhere, they were presently blown out by
the winds of vulgar opinions. So that Time is like a river which has
brought down to us things light and puffed up, while those which are
weighty and solid have sunk. Nay, those very authors who have usurped a
kind of dictatorship in the sciences and taken upon them to lay down the
law with such confidence, yet when from time to time they come to
themselves again, they fall to complaints of the subtlety of nature, the
hiding places of truth, the obscurity of things, the entanglement of
causes, the weakness of the human mind; wherein nevertheless they show
themselves never the more modest, seeing that they will rather lay the
blame upon the common condition of men and nature than upon themselves.
And then whatever any art fails to attain, they ever set it down upon
the authority of that art itself as impossible of attainment; and how
can art be found guilty when it is judge in its own cause? So it is but
a device for exempting ignorance from ignominy. Now for those things
which are delivered and received, this is their condition: barren of
works, full of questions; in point of enlargement slow and languid,
carrying a show of perfection in the whole, but in the parts ill filled
up; in selection popular, and unsatisfactory even to those who propound
them; and therefore fenced round and set forth with sundry artifices.
And if there be any who have determined to make trial for themselves and
put their own strength to the work of advancing the boundaries of the
sciences, yet have they not ventured to cast themselves completely loose
from received opinions or to seek their knowledge at the fountain; but
they think they have done some great thing if they do but add and
introduce into the existing sum of science something of their own,
prudently considering with themselves that by making the addition they
can assert their liberty, while they retain the credit of modesty by
assenting to the rest. But these mediocrities and middle ways so much
praised, in deferring to opinions and customs, turn to the great
detriment of the sciences. For it is hardly possible at once to admire
an author and to go beyond him, knowledge being as water, which will not
rise above the level from which it fell. Men of this kind, therefore,
amend some things, but advance little, and improve the condition of
knowledge, but do not extend its range. Some, indeed, there have been
who have gone more boldly to work and, taking it all for an open matter
and giving their genius full play, have made a passage for themselves
and their own opinions by pulling down and demolishing former ones; and
yet all their stir has but little advanced the matter, since their aim
has been not to extend philosophy and the arts in substance and value,
but only to change doctrines and transfer the kingdom of opinions to
themselves; whereby little has indeed been gained, for though the error
be the opposite of the other, the causes of erring are the same in both.
And if there have been any who, not binding themselves either to other
men’s opinions or to their own, but loving liberty, have desired to
engage others along with themselves in search, these, though honest in
intention, have been weak in endeavor. For they have been content to
follow probable reasons and are carried round in a whirl of arguments,
and in the promiscuous liberty of search have relaxed the severity of
inquiry. There is none who has dwelt upon experience and the facts of
nature as long as is necessary. Some there are indeed who have committed
themselves to the waves of experience and almost turned mechanics, yet
these again have in their very experiments pursued a kind of wandering
inquiry, without any regular system of operations. And besides they have
mostly proposed to themselves certain petty tasks, taking it for a great
matter to work out some single discovery — a course of proceeding at
once poor in aim and unskillful in design. For no man can rightly and
successfully investigate the nature of anything in the thing itself; let
him vary his experiments as laboriously as he will, he never comes to a
resting-place, but still finds something to seek beyond. And there is
another thing to be remembered — namely, that all industry in
experimenting has begun with proposing to itself certain definite works
to be accomplished, and has pursued them with premature and unseasonable
eagerness; it has sought, I say, experiments of fruit, not experiments
of light, not imitating the divine procedure, which in its first day’s
work created light only and assigned to it one entire day, on which day
it produced no material work, but proceeded to that on the days
following. As for those who have given the first place to logic,
supposing that the surest helps to the sciences were to be found in
that, they have indeed most truly and excellently perceived that the
human intellect left to its own course is not to be trusted; but then
the remedy is altogether too weak for the disease, nor is it without
evil in itself. For the logic which is received, though it be very
properly applied to civil business and to those arts which rest in
discourse and opinion, is not nearly subtle enough to deal with nature;
and in attempting what it cannot master, has done more to establish and
perpetuate error than to open the way to truth.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, therefore, it seems that men have not been happy
hitherto either in the trust which they have placed in others or in
their own industry with regard to the sciences; especially as neither
the demonstrations nor the experiments as yet known are much to be
relied upon. But the universe to the eye of the human understanding is
framed like a labyrinth, presenting as it does on every side so many
ambiguities of way, such deceitful resemblances of objects and signs,
natures so irregular in their lines and so knotted and entangled. And
then the way is still to be made by the uncertain light of the sense,
sometimes shining out, sometimes clouded over, through the woods of
experience and particulars; while those who offer themselves for guides
are (as was said) themselves also puzzled, and increase the number of
errors and wanderers. In circumstances so difficult neither the natural
force of man’s judgment nor even any accidental felicity offers any
chance of success. No excellence of wit, no repetition of chance
experiments, can overcome such difficulties as these. Our steps must be
guided by a clue, and the whole way from the very first perception of
the senses must be laid out upon a sure plan. Not that I would be
understood to mean that nothing whatever has been done in so many ages
by so great labors. We have no reason to be ashamed of the discoveries
which have been made, and no doubt the ancients proved themselves in
everything that turns on wit and abstract meditation, wonderful men.
But, as in former ages, when men sailed only by observation of the
stars, they could indeed coast along the shores of the old continent or
cross a few small and Mediterranean seas; but before the ocean could be
traversed and the new world discovered, the use of the mariner’s needle,
as a more faithful and certain guide, had to be found out; in like
manner the discoveries which have been hitherto made in the arts and
sciences are such as might be made by practice, meditation, observation,
argumentation — for they lay near to the senses and immediately beneath
common notions; but before we can reach the remoter and more hidden
parts of nature, it is necessary that a more perfect use and application
of the human mind and intellect be introduced.</p>
<p>For my own part at least, in obedience to the everlasting love of
truth, I have committed myself to the uncertainties and difficulties and
solitudes of the ways and, relying on the divine assistance, have upheld
my mind both against the shocks and embattled ranks of opinion, and
against my own private and inward hesitations and scruples, and against
the fogs and clouds of nature, and the phantoms flitting about on every
side, in the hope of providing at last for the present and future
generations guidance more faithful and secure. Wherein if I have made
any progress, the way has been opened to me by no other means than the
true and legitimate humiliation of the human spirit. For all those who
before me have applied themselves to the invention of arts have but cast
a glance or two upon facts and examples and experience, and straightway
proceeded, as if invention were nothing more than an exercise of
thought, to invoke their own spirits to give them oracles. I, on the
contrary, dwelling purely and constantly among the facts of nature,
withdraw my intellect from them no further than may suffice to let the
images and rays of natural objects meet in a point, as they do in the
sense of vision; whence it follows that the strength and excellence of
the wit has but little to do in the matter. And the same humility which
I use in inventing I employ likewise in teaching. For I do not endeavor
either by triumphs of confutation, or pleadings of antiquity, or
assumption of authority, or even by the veil of obscurity, to invest
these inventions of mine with any majesty; which might easily be done by
one who sought to give luster to his own name rather than light to other
men’s minds. I have not sought (I say) nor do I seek either to force or
ensnare men’s judgments, but I lead them to things themselves and the
concordances of things, that they may see for themselves what they have,
what they can dispute, what they can add and contribute to the common
stock. And for myself, if in anything I have been either too credulous
or too little awake and attentive, or if I have fallen off by the way
and left the inquiry incomplete, nevertheless I so present these things
naked and open, that my errors can be marked and set aside before the
mass of knowledge be further infected by them; and it will be easy also
for others to continue and carry on my labors. And by these means I
suppose that I have established forever a true and lawful marriage
between the empirical and the rational faculty, the unkind and
ill-starred divorce and separation of which has thrown into confusion
all the affairs of the human family.</p>
<p>Wherefore, seeing that these things do not depend upon myself, at the
outset of the work I most humbly and fervently pray to God the Father,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, that remembering the sorrows of
mankind and the pilgrimage of this our life wherein we wear out days few
and evil, they will vouchsafe through my hands to endow the human family
with new mercies. This likewise I humbly pray, that things human may not
interfere with things divine, and that from the opening of the ways of
sense and the increase of natural light there may arise in our minds no
incredulity or darkness with regard to the divine mysteries, but rather
that the understanding being thereby purified and purged of fancies and
vanity, and yet not the less subject and entirely submissive to the
divine oracles, may give to faith that which is faith’s. Lastly, that
knowledge being now discharged of that venom which the serpent infused
into it, and which makes the mind of man to swell, we may not be wise
above measure and sobriety, but cultivate truth in charity.</p>
<p>And now, having said my prayers, I turn to men, to whom I have
certain salutary admonitions to offer and certain fair requests to make.
My first admonition (which was also my prayer) is that men confine the
sense within the limits of duty in respect of things divine: for the
sense is like the sun, which reveals the face of earth, but seals and
shuts up the face of heaven. My next, that in flying from this evil they
fall not into the opposite error, which they will surely do if they
think that the inquisition of nature is in any part interdicted or
forbidden. For it was not that pure and uncorrupted natural knowledge
whereby Adam gave names to the creatures according to their propriety,
which, gave occasion to the fall. It was the ambitious and proud desire
of moral knowledge to judge of good and evil, to the end that man may
revolt from God and give laws to himself, which was the form and manner
of the temptation. Whereas of the sciences which regard nature, the
divine philosopher declares that “it is the glory of God to conceal a
thing, but it is the glory of the King to find a thing out.” Even as
though the divine nature took pleasure in the innocent and kindly sport
of children playing at hide-and-seek, and vouchsafed of his kindness and
goodness to admit the human spirit for his playfellow at that game.
Lastly, I would address one general admonition to all — that they
consider what are the true ends of knowledge, and that they seek it not
either for pleasure of the mind, or for contention, or for superiority
to others, or for profit, or fame, or power, or any of these inferior
things, but for the benefit and use of life, and that they perfect and
govern it in charity. For it was from lust of power that the angels
fell, from lust of knowledge that man fell; but of charity there can be
no excess, neither did angel or man ever come in danger by it.</p>
<p>The requests I have to make are these. Of myself I say nothing; but
in behalf of the business which is in hand I entreat men to believe that
it is not an opinion to be held, but a work to be done; and to be well
assured that I am laboring to lay the foundation, not of any sect or
doctrine, but of human utility and power. Next, I ask them to deal
fairly by their own interests, and laying aside all emulations and
prejudices in favor of this or that opinion, to join in consultation for
the common good; and being now freed and guarded by the securities and
helps which I offer from the errors and impediments of the way, to come
forward themselves and take part in that which remains to be done.
Moreover, to be of good hope, nor to imagine that this Instauration of
mine is a thing infinite and beyond the power of man, when it is in fact
the true end and termination of infinite error; and seeing also that it
is by no means forgetful of the conditions of mortality and humanity
(for it does not suppose that the work can be altogether completed
within one generation, but provides for its being taken up by another);
and finally that it seeks for the sciences not arrogantly in the little
cells of human wit, but with reverence in the greater world. But it is
the empty things that are vast; things solid are most contracted and lie
in little room. And now I have only one favor more to ask (else
injustice to me may perhaps imperil the business itself) — that men will
consider well how far, upon that which I must needs assert (if I am to
be consistent with myself), they are entitled to judge and decide upon
these doctrines of mine; inasmuch as all that premature human reasoning
which anticipates inquiry, and is abstracted from the facts rashly and
sooner than is fit, is by me rejected (so far as the inquisition of
nature is concerned) as a thing uncertain, confused, and ill built up;
and I cannot be fairly asked to abide by the decision of a tribunal
which is itself on trial.</p>
