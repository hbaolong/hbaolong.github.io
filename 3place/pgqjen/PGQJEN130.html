<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>In the history which I require and design, special care is to be
taken that it be of wide range and made to the measure of the universe.
For the world is not to be narrowed till it will go into the
understanding (which has been done hitherto), but the understanding to
be expanded and opened till it can take in the image of the world as it
is in fact. For that fashion of taking few things into account, and
pronouncing with reference to a few things, has been the ruin of
everything. To resume then the divisions of natural history which I made
just now — viz., that it is a history of generations, Pretergenerations,
and arts — I divide the history of generations into five parts. The
first, of ether and things celestial. The second, of meteors and the
regions (as they call them) of air, viz., of the tracts which lie
between the moon and the surface of the earth; to which part also (for
order’s sake, however the truth of the thing may be) I assign comets of
whatever kind, both higher and lower. The third, of earth and sea. The
fourth, of the elements (as they call them), flame or fire, air, water,
earth, understanding, however, by elements, not the first principles of
things, but the greater masses of natural bodies. For the nature of
things is so distributed that the quantity or mass of some bodies in the
universe is very great, because their configurations require a texture
of matter easy and obvious, such as are those four bodies which I have
mentioned; while of certain other bodies the quantity is small and
weakly supplied, because the texture of matter which they require is
very complex and subtle, and for the most part determinate and organic,
such as are the species of natural things — metals, plants, animals.
Hence I call the former kind of bodies the “greater colleges,” the
latter the “lesser colleges.” Now the fourth part of the history is of
those greater colleges — under the name of elements, as I said. And let
it not be thought that I confound this fourth part with the second and
third, because in each of them I have mentioned air, water, and earth.
For the history of these enters into the second and third, as they are
integral parts of the world, and as they relate to the fabric and
configuration of the universe. But in the fourth is contained the
history of their own substance and nature, as it exists in their several
parts of uniform structure, and without reference to the whole. Lastly,
the fifth part of the history contains the lesser colleges, or species,
upon which natural history has hitherto been principally employed.</p>
<p>As for the history of pretergenerations, I have already said that it
may be most conveniently joined with the history of generations — I mean
the history of prodigies which are natural. For the superstitious
history of marvels (of whatever kind) I remit to a quite separate
treatise of its own; which treatise I do not wish to be undertaken now
at first, but a little after, when the investigation of nature has been
carried deeper.</p>
<p>History of arts, and of nature as changed and altered by man, or
experimental history, I divide into three. For it is drawn either from
mechanical arts, or from the operative part of the liberal arts, or from
a number of crafts and experiments which have not yet grown into an art
properly so called, and which sometimes indeed turn up in the course of
most ordinary experience and do not stand at all in need of art.</p>
<p>As soon, therefore, as a history has been completed of all these
things which I have mentioned — namely, generations, pretergenerations,
arts, and experiments, it seems that nothing will remain unprovided
whereby the sense can be equipped for information of the understanding.
And then shall we be no longer kept dancing within little rings, like
persons bewitched, but our range and circuit will be as wide as the
compass of the world.</p>
