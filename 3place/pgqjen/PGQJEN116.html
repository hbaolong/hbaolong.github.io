<h4 id="chapter-iii.">CHAPTER III.</h4>
<p>The so-called “Signatures.”</p>
<p>In Plate 14, Page 36, are shewn the five so-called signatures. These
five being the only pieces of writing in the world that can, even by the
most ardent Stratfordians, be supposed to have been written by
Shakspeare’s pen; let us consider them carefully. The Will commences “In
the name of God Amen I Willum Shackspeare.” It is written upon three
sheets of paper and each sheet bears a supposed signature. The Will is
dated in Latin “Vicesimo quinto die [Januarij] Mtij Anno Regni Dni nri
Jacobi, nunc R Anglie, andandandandc. decimo quarto andandandand Scotie
xlix° annoq Dni 1616”, or shortly in English 25th March 1616.</p>
<p>Shakspeare died 23rd April 1616 just four weeks after publishing his
will.</p>
<p>I say after “PUBLISHING his Will” advisedly, for such is the
attestation, viz., “Witnes to the publyshing hereof,”</p>
<p>“Fra: Collyns</p>
<p>Julius Shawe</p>
<p>John Robinson</p>
<p>Hamnet Sadler</p>
<p>Robert Whattcott”</p>
<p>Nothing is said about the witnessing of the signing hereof. The Will
might therefore have been, and I myself am perfectly certain that it
was, marked with the name of William Shakspeare by the Solicitor, Fra
(ncis) Collyns, who wrote the body of the Will.</p>
<p>He also wrote the names of the other witnesses, which are all in the
same hand-writing as the Will; shewing that Shakspeare’s witnesses were
also unable to write their names.</p>
<p>This fact, that Shakspeare’s name is written by the solicitor, is
conclusively proved by the recent article of Magdalene Thumm-Kintzel in
the Leipzig magazine, Der Menschenkenner, which was published in January
1909.</p>
<p>In this publication, photo reproductions of certain letters in the
body of the Will, and in the so-called Shakspeare signatures are placed
side by side, and the evidence is irresistible that they are written by
the same hand. Moreover when we remember that the Will commences “I
Willim Shackspeare” with a “c” between the “a” and “k,” the idea that
Shakspeare himself wrote his own Will cannot be deemed worthy of serious
consideration. The whole Will is in fact in the handwriting of Francis
Collyns, the Warwick solicitor, who added the attestation clause.</p>
<p>I myself was sure that the solicitor had added the so-called
signatures, when, many years ago, I examined under the strongest
magnifying glasses the Will at Somerset House.</p>
<p>Look first at the upper writings and never again call them
“signatures.” The top one is on the first page of the Will, the second
on the second page, the third on the last page of the Will.</p>
<p>The original of the top one has been very much damaged but the “W”
remains quite clear. Look first only at the “W’s”. If the writings were
signatures what could induce a man when signing his last Will to make
each “W” as different from the others as possible, and why is the second
Christian name written Willm?</p>
<p>Compare also the second and third “Shakspeare” and note that every
letter is formed in a different manner. Compare the two “S’s”, next
compare the two “h’s”, the “h” of the second begins at the bottom, the
“h” of the third begins at the top, the same applies to the next letter
the “a”, so also with respect to the “k’s “; how widely different these
are.</p>
<p>Plate 14 shews at the bottom two other names also. These are taken,
the one on the left from a deed of purchase of a dwelling house in
Blackfriars dated March 10th 1612-13 (now in the City Library of the
Corporation of London); the other on the right is from a mortgage of the
same property executed on the following day, viz: March 11th 1612-13,
which is now in the British Museum.</p>
<p>Neither of these documents states that it was “signed” but only says
that it was “sealed,” and it was at that date in no way necessary that
any signatures should be written over the seals, but the clerks might
and evidently did, place upon these deeds an abbreviated name of William
Shakspeare over the seal on each document. In the case of the other two
parties to the documents, the signatures are most beautifully written
and are almost absolutely identical in the two deeds.</p>
<p>Look at these two supposititious signatures. To myself it is
difficult to imagine that anyone with eyes to see could suppose them to
be signatures by the same hand.</p>
<p>Note on the so-called “Signatures.”</p>
<p>When part of the purchase money is what is commonly called “left on
mortgage,” the mortgage deed is always dated one day after, but is
always signed one moment before, the purchase deed, because the owner
will not part with his property before he receives his security.</p>
<p>The Shakespeare purchase deed and the mortgage deed were therefore
both signed at the same time, in the same place, with the same pen, and
the same ink.</p>
<p>This is evidently true with respect to the signatures of Wm. Johnson
and Jno. Jackson, the other parries to both of the deeds.</p>
<p>But as I wrote to the City authorities and the British Museum
authorities, it would be impossible to discover a scoundrel who would
venture to perjure himself and falsely swear that it was even remotely
possible that the two supposed signature of Wm. Shakespeare could have
been written at the same time, in the same place, with the same pen, and
the same ink, by the same hand.</p>
<p>They are widely different, one having been written by the law clerk
of the seller, the other by the law clerk of the purchaser.</p>
<p>According to the law of England, anyone may (by request) attach any
person’s name to any document, and if that person touch it, any third
person may witness it as a signature.</p>
<p>Some years ago by the courtesy of the Corporation of London, the</p>
<p>Librarian and the Chairman of the Library Committee carried the
Purchase</p>
<p>Deed to the British Museum to place it side by side with the
Mortgage</p>
<p>Deed there.</p>
<p>After they had with myself and the Museum Authorities most carefully
examined the two deeds, the Librarian of the City Corporation said to
me, there is no reason to suppose that the Corporation deed has upon it
the signature of Wm. Shakespeare, and the British Museum Authorities
likewise told me that they did not think that the Museum Mortgage Deed
had upon it a signature of William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The more you examine the whole five the more you will be certain, as
the writer is, after the most careful study of the Will and of the
Deeds, that not one of the five writings is a “signature,” or pretends
to be a “signature,” and that therefore there is a probability,
practically amounting to a certainty, that the Stratford Actor could not
so much as manage to scrawl his own name.</p>
<p>No! We possess not a scrap of writing, not even an attempt at a
signature, [see also Chapter XIV., p. 161] that can be reasonably
supposed to be written by the Stratford gentleman.</p>
<p>He is styled “gentle Shakespeare”: this does not refer to anything
relating to his character or to his manners but it means that possessing
a coat of arms he was legally entitled to call himself a
“gentleman.”</p>
