<h4 id="section">19</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>There remain two appendices touching the tradition of knowledge, the
one critical, the other pedantical. For all knowledge is either
delivered by teachers, or attained by men’s proper endeavours: and
therefore as the principal part of tradition of knowledge concerneth
chiefly writing of books, so the relative part thereof concerneth
reading of books; whereunto appertain incidently these considerations.
The first is concerning the true correction and edition of authors;
wherein nevertheless rash diligence hath done great prejudice. For these
critics have often presumed that that which they understand not is false
set down: as the priest that, where he found it written of St. Paul
Demissus est per sportam, mended his book, and made it Demissus est per
portam; because sporta was a hard word, and out of his reading: and
surely their errors, though they be not so palpable and ridiculous, yet
are of the same kind. And therefore, as it hath been wisely noted, the
most corrected copies are commonly the least correct.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second is concerning the exposition and explication of authors,
which resteth in annotations and commentaries: wherein it is over usual
to blanch the obscure places and discourse upon the plain.</p>
<p>The third is concerning the times, which in many cases give great
light to true interpretations.</p>
<p>The fourth is concerning some brief censure and judgment of the
authors; that men thereby may make some election unto themselves what
books to read.</p>
<p>And the fifth is concerning the syntax and disposition of studies;
that men may know in what order or pursuit to read.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>For pedantical knowledge, it containeth that difference of tradition
which is proper for youth; whereunto appertain divers considerations of
great fruit.</li>
</ol>
<p>As first, the timing and seasoning of knowledges; as with what to
initiate them, and from what for a time to refrain them.</p>
<p>Secondly, the consideration where to begin with the easiest, and so
proceed to the more difficult; and in what courses to press the more
difficult, and then to turn them to the more easy; for it is one method
to practise swimming with bladders, and another to practise dancing with
heavy shoes.</p>
<p>A third is the application of learning according unto the propriety
of the wits; for there is no defect in the faculties intellectual, but
seemeth to have a proper cure contained in some studies: as, for
example, if a child be bird-witted, that is, hath not the faculty of
attention, the mathematics giveth a remedy thereunto; for in them, if
the wit be caught away but a moment, one is new to begin. And as
sciences have a propriety towards faculties for cure and help, so
faculties or powers have a sympathy towards sciences for excellency or
speedy profiting: and therefore it is an inquiry of great wisdom, what
kinds of wits and natures are most apt and proper for what sciences.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the ordering of exercises is matter of great consequence to
hurt or help: for, as is well observed by Cicero, men in exercising
their faculties, if they be not well advised, do exercise their faults
and get ill habits as well as good; so as there is a great judgment to
be had in the continuance and intermission of exercises. It were too
long to particularise a number of other considerations of this nature,
things but of mean appearance, but of singular efficacy. For as the
wronging or cherishing of seeds or young plants is that that is most
important to their thriving, and as it was noted that the first six
kings being in truth as tutors of the state of Rome in the infancy
thereof was the principal cause of the immense greatness of that state
which followed, so the culture and manurance of minds in youth hath such
a forcible (though unseen) operation, as hardly any length of time or
contention of labour can countervail it afterwards. And it is not amiss
to observe also how small and mean faculties gotten by education, yet
when they fall into great men or great matters, do work great and
important effects: whereof we see a notable example in Tacitus of two
stage players, Percennius and Vibulenus, who by their faculty of playing
put the Pannonian armies into an extreme tumult and combustion. For
there arising a mutiny amongst them upon the death of Augustus Caesar,
Blaesus the lieutenant had committed some of the mutineers, which were
suddenly rescued; whereupon Vibulenus got to be heard speak, which he
did in this manner:— “These poor innocent wretches appointed to cruel
death, you have restored to behold the light; but who shall restore my
brother to me, or life unto my brother, that was sent hither in message
from the legions of Germany, to treat of the common cause? and he hath
murdered him this last night by some of his fencers and ruffians, that
he hath about him for his executioners upon soldiers. Answer, Blaesus,
what is done with his body? The mortalest enemies do not deny burial.
When I have performed my last duties to the corpse with kisses, with
tears, command me to be slain besides him; so that these my fellows, for
our good meaning and our true hearts to the legions, may have leave to
bury us.” With which speech he put the army into an infinite fury and
uproar: whereas truth was he had no brother, neither was there any such
matter; but he played it merely as if he had been upon the stage.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>But to return: we are now come to a period of rational knowledges;
wherein if I have made the divisions other than those that are received,
yet would I not be thought to disallow all those divisions which I do
not use. For there is a double necessity imposed upon me of altering the
divisions. The one, because it differeth in end and purpose, to sort
together those things which are next in nature, and those things which
are next in use. For if a secretary of estate should sort his papers, it
is like in his study or general cabinet he would sort together things of
a nature, as treaties, instructions, andandandandc. But in his boxes or
particular cabinet he would sort together those that he were like to use
together, though of several natures. So in this general cabinet of
knowledge it was necessary for me to follow the divisions of the nature
of things; whereas if myself had been to handle any particular
knowledge, I would have respected the divisions fittest for use. The
other, because the bringing in of the deficiences did by consequence
alter the partitions of the rest. For let the knowledge extant (for
demonstration sake) be fifteen. Let the knowledge with the deficiences
be twenty; the parts of fifteen are not the parts of twenty; for the
parts of fifteen are three and five; the parts of twenty are two, four,
five, and ten. So as these things are without contradiction, and could
not otherwise be.</li>
