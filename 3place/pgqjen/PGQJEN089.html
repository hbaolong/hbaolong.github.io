<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>“The TVVOO Bookes of Francis Bacon. Of the proficience and
aduancement of Learning, divine and humane. To the King. At London.
Printed for Henrie Tomes, and are to be sould at his shop at Graies Inne
Gate in Holborne. 1605.” That was the original title-page of the book
now in the reader’s hand — a living book that led the way to a new world
of thought. It was the book in which Bacon, early in the reign of James
the First, prepared the way for a full setting forth of his New Organon,
or instrument of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Organon of Aristotle was a set of treatises in which Aristotle
had written the doctrine of propositions. Study of these treatises was a
chief occupation of young men when they passed from school to college,
and proceeded from Grammar to Logic, the second of the Seven Sciences.
Francis Bacon as a youth of sixteen, at Trinity College, Cambridge, felt
the unfruitfulness of this method of search after truth. He was the son
of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Queen Elizabeth’s Lord Keeper, and was born at
York House, in the Strand, on the 22nd of January, 1561. His mother was
the Lord Keeper’s second wife, one of two sisters, of whom the other
married Sir William Cecil, afterwards Lord Burleigh. Sir Nicholas Bacon
had six children by his former marriage, and by his second wife two
sons, Antony and Francis, of whom Antony was about two years the elder.
The family home was at York Place, and at Gorhambury, near St. Albans,
from which town, in its ancient and its modern style, Bacon afterwards
took his titles of Verulam and St. Albans.</p>
<p>Antony and Francis Bacon went together to Trinity College, Cambridge,
when Antony was fourteen years old and Francis twelve. Francis remained
at Cambridge only until his sixteenth year; and Dr. Rawley, his chaplain
in after-years, reports of him that “whilst he was commorant in the
University, about sixteen years of age (as his lordship hath been
pleased to impart unto myself), he first fell into dislike of the
philosophy of Aristotle; not for the worthlessness of the author, to
whom he would ascribe all high attributes, but for the unfruitfulness of
the way, being a philosophy (as his lordship used to say) only strong
for disputatious and contentions, but barren of the production of works
for the benefit of the life of man; in which mind he continued to his
dying day.” Bacon was sent as a youth of sixteen to Paris with the
ambassador Sir Amyas Paulet, to begin his training for the public
service; but his father’s death, in February, 1579, before he had
completed the provision he was making for his youngest children, obliged
him to return to London, and, at the age of eighteen, to settle down at
Gray’s Inn to the study of law as a profession. He was admitted to the
outer bar in June, 1582, and about that time, at the age of twenty-one,
wrote a sketch of his conception of a New Organon that should lead man
to more fruitful knowledge, in a little Latin tract, which he called
“Temporis Partus Maximus” (“The Greatest Birth of Time”).</p>
<p>In November, 1584, Bacon took his seat in the House of Commons as
member for Melcombe Regis, in Dorsetshire. In October, 1586, he sat for
Taunton. He was member afterwards for Liverpool; and he was one of those
who petitioned for the speedy execution of Mary Queen of Scots. In
October, 1589, he obtained the reversion of the office of Clerk of the
Council in the Star Chamber, which was worth 1,600 pounds or 2,000
pounds a year; but for the succession to this office he had to wait
until 1608. It had not yet fallen to him when he wrote his “Two Books of
the Advancement of Learning.” In the Parliament that met in February,
1593, Bacon sat as member for Middlesex. He raised difficulties of
procedure in the way of the grant of a treble subsidy, by just objection
to the joining of the Lords with the Commons in a money grant, and a
desire to extend the time allowed for payment from three years to six;
it was, in fact, extended to four years. The Queen was offended. Francis
Bacon and his brother Antony had attached themselves to the young Earl
of Essex, who was their friend and patron. The office of
Attorney-General became vacant. Essex asked the Queen to appoint Francis
Bacon. The Queen gave the office to Sir Edward Coke, who was already
Solicitor-General, and by nine years Bacon’s senior. The office of
Solicitor-General thus became vacant, and that was sought for Francis
Bacon. The Queen, after delay and hesitation, gave it, in November,
1595, to Serjeant Fleming. The Earl of Essex consoled his friend by
giving him “a piece of land”— Twickenham Park — which Bacon afterwards
sold for 1,800 pounds — equal, say, to 12,000 pounds in present buying
power. In 1597 Bacon was returned to Parliament as member for Ipswich,
and in that year he was hoping to marry the rich widow of Sir William
Hatton, Essex helping; but the lady married, in the next year, Sir
Edward Coke. It was in 1597 that Bacon published the First Edition of
his Essays. That was a little book containing only ten essays in
English, with twelve “Meditationes Sacrae,” which were essays in Latin
on religious subjects. From 1597 onward to the end of his life, Bacon’s
Essays were subject to continuous addition and revision. The author’s
Second Edition, in which the number of the Essays was increased from ten
to thirty-eight, did not appear until November or December, 1612, seven
years later than these two books on the “Advancement of Learning;” and
the final edition of the Essays, in which their number was increased
from thirty-eight to fifty-eight, appeared only in 1625; and Bacon died
on the 9th of April, 1626. The edition of the Essays published in 1597,
under Elizabeth, marked only the beginning of a course of thought that
afterwards flowed in one stream with his teachings in philosophy.</p>
<p>In February, 1601, there was the rebellion of Essex. Francis Bacon
had separated himself from his patron after giving him advice that was
disregarded. Bacon, now Queen’s Counsel, not only appeared against his
old friend, but with excess of zeal, by which, perhaps, he hoped to win
back the Queen’s favour, he twice obtruded violent attacks upon Essex
when he was not called upon to speak. On the 25th of February, 1601,
Essex was beheaded. The genius of Bacon was next employed to justify
that act by “A Declaration of the Practices and Treasons attempted and
committed by Robert late Earle of Essex and his Complices.” But James of
Scotland, on whose behalf Essex had intervened, came to the throne by
the death of Elizabeth on the 24th of March, 1603. Bacon was among the
crowd of men who were made knights by James I., and he had to justify
himself under the new order of things by writing “Sir Francis Bacon his
Apologie in certain Imputations concerning the late Earle of Essex.” He
was returned to the first Parliament of James I. by Ipswich and
St. Albans, and he was confirmed in his office of King’s Counsel in
August, 1604; but he was not appointed to the office of
Solicitor-General when it became vacant in that year.</p>
<p>That was the position of Francis Bacon in 1605, when he published
this work, where in his First Book he pointed out the discredits of
learning from human defects of the learned, and emptiness of many of the
studies chosen, or the way of dealing with them. This came, he said,
especially by the mistaking or misplacing of the last or furthest end of
knowledge, as if there were sought in it “a couch whereupon to rest a
searching and restless spirit; or a terrace for a wandering and variable
mind to walk up and down with a fair prospect; or a tower of state for a
proud mind to raise itself upon; or a fort or commanding ground for
strife and contention; or a shop for profit or sale; and not a rich
storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man’s estate.”
The rest of the First Book was given to an argument upon the Dignity of
Learning; and the Second Book, on the Advancement of Learning, is, as
Bacon himself described it, “a general and faithful perambulation of
learning, with an inquiry what parts thereof lie fresh and waste, and
not improved and converted by the industry of man; to the end that such
a plot made and recorded to memory may both minister light to any public
designation and also serve to excite voluntary endeavours.” Bacon makes,
by a sort of exhaustive analysis, a ground-plan of all subjects of
study, as an intellectual map, helping the right inquirer in his search
for the right path. The right path is that by which he has the best
chance of adding to the stock of knowledge in the world something worth
labouring for; and the true worth is in labour for “the glory of the
Creator and the relief of man’s estate.”</p>
<p>H. M.</p>
<p>The First Book</p>
<p>There were under the law, excellent King, both daily sacrifices and
freewill offerings; the one proceeding upon ordinary observance, the
other upon a devout cheerfulness: in like manner there belongeth to
kings from their servants both tribute of duty and presents of
affection. In the former of these I hope I shall not live to be wanting,
according to my most humble duty and the good pleasure of your Majesty’s
employments: for the latter, I thought it more respective to make choice
of some oblation which might rather refer to the propriety and
excellency of your individual person, than to the business of your crown
and state.</p>
<p>Wherefore, representing your Majesty many times unto my mind, and
beholding you not with the inquisitive eye of presumption, to discover
that which the Scripture telleth me is inscrutable, but with the
observant eye of duty and admiration, leaving aside the other parts of
your virtue and fortune, I have been touched — yea, and possessed — with
an extreme wonder at those your virtues and faculties, which the
philosophers call intellectual; the largeness of your capacity, the
faithfulness of your memory, the swiftness of your apprehension, the
penetration of your judgment, and the facility and order of your
elocution: and I have often thought that of all the persons living that
I have known, your Majesty were the best instance to make a man of
Plato’s opinion, that all knowledge is but remembrance, and that the
mind of man by Nature knoweth all things, and hath but her own native
and original notions (which by the strangeness and darkness of this
tabernacle of the body are sequestered) again revived and restored: such
a light of Nature I have observed in your Majesty, and such a readiness
to take flame and blaze from the least occasion presented, or the least
spark of another’s knowledge delivered. And as the Scripture saith of
the wisest king, “That his heart was as the sands of the sea;” which,
though it be one of the largest bodies, yet it consisteth of the
smallest and finest portions; so hath God given your Majesty a
composition of understanding admirable, being able to compass and
comprehend the greatest matters, and nevertheless to touch and apprehend
the least; whereas it should seem an impossibility in Nature for the
same instrument to make itself fit for great and small works. And for
your gift of speech, I call to mind what Cornelius Tacitus saith of
Augustus Caesar: Augusto profluens, et quae principem deceret,
eloquentia fuit. For if we note it well, speech that is uttered with
labour and difficulty, or speech that savoureth of the affectation of
art and precepts, or speech that is framed after the imitation of some
pattern of eloquence, though never so excellent; all this hath somewhat
servile, and holding of the subject. But your Majesty’s manner of speech
is, indeed, prince-like, flowing as from a fountain, and yet streaming
and branching itself into Nature’s order, full of facility and felicity,
imitating none, and inimitable by any. And as in your civil estate there
appeareth to be an emulation and contention of your Majesty’s virtue
with your fortune; a virtuous disposition with a fortunate regiment; a
virtuous expectation (when time was) of your greater fortune, with a
prosperous possession thereof in the due time; a virtuous observation of
the laws of marriage, with most blessed and happy fruit of marriage; a
virtuous and most Christian desire of peace, with a fortunate
inclination in your neighbour princes thereunto: so likewise in these
intellectual matters there seemeth to be no less contention between the
excellency of your Majesty’s gifts of Nature and the universality and
perfection of your learning. For I am well assured that this which I
shall say is no amplification at all, but a positive and measured truth;
which is, that there hath not been since Christ’s time any king or
temporal monarch which hath been so learned in all literature and
erudition, divine and human. For let a man seriously and diligently
revolve and peruse the succession of the Emperors of Rome, of which
Caesar the Dictator (who lived some years before Christ) and Marcus
Antoninus were the best learned, and so descend to the Emperors of
Graecia, or of the West, and then to the lines of France, Spain,
England, Scotland, and the rest, and he shall find this judgment is
truly made. For it seemeth much in a king if, by the compendious
extractions of other men’s wits and labours, he can take hold of any
superficial ornaments and shows of learning, or if he countenance and
prefer learning and learned men; but to drink, indeed, of the true
fountains of learning — nay, to have such a fountain of learning in
himself, in a king, and in a king born — is almost a miracle. And the
more, because there is met in your Majesty a rare conjunction, as well
of divine and sacred literature as of profane and human; so as your
Majesty standeth invested of that triplicity, which in great veneration
was ascribed to the ancient Hermes: the power and fortune of a king, the
knowledge and illumination of a priest, and the learning and
universality of a philosopher. This propriety inherent and individual
attribute in your Majesty deserveth to be expressed not only in the fame
and admiration of the present time, nor in the history or tradition of
the ages succeeding, but also in some solid work, fixed memorial, and
immortal monument, bearing a character or signature both of the power of
a king and the difference and perfection of such a king.</p>
<p>Therefore I did conclude with myself that I could not make unto your
Majesty a better oblation than of some treatise tending to that end,
whereof the sum will consist of these two parts: the former concerning
the excellency of learning and knowledge, and the excellency of the
merit and true glory in the augmentation and propagation thereof; the
latter, what the particular acts and works are which have been embraced
and undertaken for the advancement of learning; and again, what defects
and undervalues I find in such particular acts: to the end that though I
cannot positively or affirmatively advise your Majesty, or propound unto
you framed particulars, yet I may excite your princely cogitations to
visit the excellent treasure of your own mind, and thence to extract
particulars for this purpose agreeable to your magnanimity and
wisdom.</p>
