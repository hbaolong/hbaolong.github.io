<h4 id="to-the-reader.">To the Reader.</h4>
<p>HAuing had the Honour to be continually with my Lord, in compiling of
this Worke; And to be employed therein; I haue thought it not amisse,
(with his Lordships good leaue and liking,) for the better satisfaction
of those that shall reade it, to make knowne somewhat of his Lordships
Intentions, touching the Ordering, and Publishing of the same. I haue
heard his Lordship often say; that if hee should haue serued the glory
of his owne Name, he had been better not to haue published this Naturall
History: For it may seeme an Indigested Heap of Particulars; And cannot
haue that Lustre, which Bookes cast into Methods haue: But that he
resolued to preferre the good of Men, and that which might best secure
it, before any thing that might haue Relation to Himselfe. And hee knew
well, that ther was no other way open, to vnloose Mens mindes, being
bound; and (as it were) Maleficiate, by the Charmes of deceiuing
Notions, and Theories; and therby made Impotent for Generation of
VVorkes; But onely no wher to depart from the Sense, and cleare
experience; But to keepe close to it, especially in the beginning:
Besides, this Naturall History was a Debt of his, being Designed and set
downe for a third part of the Instauration. I haue also heard his
Lordship discourse, that Men (no doubt) will thinke many of the
Experiments conteined in this Collection, to bee Vulgar and Triuiall;
Meane and Sordid; Curious and Fruitlesse: And therfore he wisheth, that
they would haue perpetually before their Eyes, what is now in doing; And
the Difference betweene this Naturall History, and others. For those
Naturall Histories, which are Extant, being gathered for Delight and
Vse, are full of pleasant Descriptions and Pictures; and affect and
seeke after Admiration, Rarities, and Secrets. But contrariwise, the
Scope which his Lordship intendeth, is to write such a Naturall History,
as may be Fundamentall to the Erecting and Building of a true
Philosophy: For the Illumination of the Vnderstanding; the Extracting of
Axiomes; and the producing of many Noble Works, and Effects. For he
hopeth, by this meanes, to acquit Himselfe of that, for which hee taketh
Himselfe in a sort bound; And that is, the Aduancement of all Learning
and Sciences. For hauing in this present VVorke Collected the Materialls
for the Building; And in his Novum Organum (of which his Lordship is yet
to publish a Second Part,) set downe the Instruments and Directions for
the Worke; Men shall now bee wanting to themselues, if they raise not
Knowledge to that perfection, whereof the Nature of Mortall men is
capable. And in this behalfe, I haue heard his Lordship speake
complainingly; That his Lordship (who thinketh hee deserueth to be an
Architect in this building,) should be forced to be a VVork-man and a
Labourer; And to digge the Clay, and burne the Brick; And more then
that, (according to the hard Condition of the Israelites at the latter
end) to gather the Strawe and Stubble, ouer all the Fields, to burn the
Bricks withall. For he knoweth, that except hee doe it, nothing will be
done: Men are so sett to despise the Meanes of their owne good. And as
for the Basenes of many of the Experiments; As long as they be Gods
VVorks, they are Honourable enough. And for the Vulgarnes of them; true
Axiomes must be drawne from plaine Experience, and not from doubtfull;
And his Lordships course is, to make VVonders Plaine, and not Plaine
things VVonders; And that Experience likewise must be broken and
grinded, and not whole, or as it groweth. And for Vse; his Lordship hath
often in his Mouth, the two kindes of Experiments; Experimenta
Fructifera, and Experimenta Lucifera: Experiments of Vse, and
Experiments of Light; And he reporteth himself, whether he were not a
strange Man, that should thinke that Light hath no Vse, because it hath
no Matter. Further, his Lordship thought good also, to add vnto many of
the Experiments themselues, some Glosse of the Causes; that in the
succeeding work of Interpreting Nature, and Framing Axiomes, all things
may be in more Readines. And for the Causes herein by Him assigned; his
Lordship perswadeth Himselfe, they are farr more certaine, then those
that are rendred by Others; Not for any Excellency of his owne Witt, (as
his Lordship is wont to say) but in respect of his continuall
Conuersation with Nature, and Experience. He did consider likewise, that
by this Addition of Causes, Mens mindes (which make so much hast to find
out the Causes of things;) would not think themselues vtterly lost, in a
Vast VVood of Experience, but stay vpon these Causes, (such as they are)
a little, till true Axiomes may be more fully discouered. I haue heard
his Lordship say also, that one great Reason, why he would not put these
Particulars into any exact Method, (though he that looketh attentiuely
into them, shall finde that they haue a secret Order) was, because hee
conceiued that other men would now thinke, that they could doe the like;
And so goe on with a further Collection: which if the Method had been
Exact, many would haue despaired to attaine by Imitation. As for his
Lordships loue of Order, I can referr any Man to his Lordships Latine
Booke, De Augmentis Scientiarum; which (if my Iudgment be any thing) is
written in the Exactest Order, that I know any Writing to bee. I will
conclude with an vsuall Speech of his Lordships. That this Worke of his
Naturall History, is the World, as GOD made it, and not as Men haue made
it; For that it hath nothing of Imagination.</p>
