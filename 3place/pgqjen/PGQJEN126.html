Toward a Natural and Experimental History</h4>
<p>Description of a Natural and Experimental History Such as May Serve
for the Foundation of a True Philosophy</p>
<p>My object in publishing my Instauration by parts is that some portion
of it may be put out of peril. A similar reason induces me to subjoin
here another small portion of the work, and to publish it along with
that which has just been set forth. This is the description and
delineation of a natural and experimental history, such as may serve to
build philosophy upon, and containing material true and copious and
aptly digested for the work of the interpreter which follows. The proper
place for it would be when I come in due course to the “Preparatives” of
Inquiry. I have thought it better, however, to introduce it at once
without waiting for that. For a history of this kind, such as I conceive
and shall presently describe, is a thing of very great size and cannot
be executed without great labor and expense, requiring as it does many
people to help, and being (as I have said elsewhere) a kind of royal
work. It occurs to me, therefore, that it may not be amiss to try if
there be any others who will take these matters in hand, so that while I
go on with the completion of my original design, this part which is so
manifold and laborious may even during my life (if it so please the
Divine Majesty) be prepared and set forth, others applying themselves
diligently to it along with me; the rather because my own strength (if I
should have no one to help me) is hardly equal to such a province. For
as much relates to the work itself of the intellect, I shall perhaps be
able to master that by myself; but the materials on which the intellect
has to work are so widely spread that one must employ factors and
merchants to go everywhere in search of them and bring them in. Besides
I hold it to be somewhat beneath the dignity of an undertaking like mine
that I should spend my own time in a matter which is open to almost
every man’s industry. That, however, which is the main part of the
matter I will myself now supply, by diligently and exactly setting forth
the method and description of a history of this kind, such as shall
satisfy my intention; lest men for want of warning set to work the wrong
way and guide themselves by the example of the natural histories now in
use, and so go far astray from my design. Meanwhile, what I have often
said I must here emphatically repeat: that if all the wits of all the
ages had met or shall hereafter meet together, if the whole human race
had applied or shall hereafter apply themselves to philosophy, and the
whole earth had been or shall be nothing but academies and colleges and
schools of learned men, still without a natural and experimental history
such as I am going to prescribe, no progress worthy of the human race
could have been made or can be made in philosophy and the sciences.
Whereas, on the other hand, let such a history be once provided and well
set forth, and let there be added to it such auxiliary and light-giving
experiments as in the very course of interpretation will present
themselves or will have to be found out, and the investigation of nature
and of all sciences will be the work of a few years. This, therefore,
must be done or the business must be given up. For in this way, and in
this way only, can the foundations of a true and active philosophy be
established; and then will men wake as from deep sleep, and at once
perceive what a difference there is between the dogmas and figments of
the wit and a true and active philosophy, and what it is in questions of
nature to consult nature herself.</p>
<p>First, then, I will give general precepts for the composition of this
history; then I will set out the particular figure of it, inserting
sometimes as well the purpose to which the inquiry is to be adapted and
referred as the particular point to be inquired in order that a good
understanding and forecast of the mark aimed at may suggest to men’s
minds other things also which I may perhaps have overlooked. This
history I call “Primary History,” or the “Mother History.”</p>
