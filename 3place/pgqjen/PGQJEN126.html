<h4 id="chapter-xiii.">Chapter XIII.</h4>
<p>Conclusion, with further evidences from title pages.</p>
<p>Bacon had published eleven plays anonymously, when it became
imperatively necessary for him to find some man who could be purchased
to run the risk, which was by no means inconsiderable, of being supposed
to be the author of these plays which included “Richard II.”; the
historical play which so excited the ire of Queen Elizabeth. Bacon, as
we have already pointed out, succeeded in discovering a man who had
little, if any, repute as an actor, but who bore a name which was called
Shaxpur or Shackspere, which could be twisted into something that might
be supposed to be the original of Bacon’s pen name of Shake-Speare.</p>
<p>When in 1597 through the medium of powerful friends, by means of the
bribe of a large sum of money, the gift of New Place, and the promise of
a coat of arms, this man had been secured, he was at once sent away from
London to the then remote village of Stratford-on-Avon, where scarcely a
score of people could read, and none were likely to connect the name of
their countryman, who they knew could neither read nor write and whom
they called Shak or Shackspur, with “William Shakespeare” the author of
plays the very names of which were absolutely unknown to any of
them.</p>
<p>Bacon, when Shackspur had been finally secured in 1597, brought out
in the following year 1598 “Loues Labor’s lost” with the imprint “newly
corrected and augmented by W. Shakespere,” and immediately he also
brought out under the name of Francis Meres “Wits Treasury,” containing
the statement that eleven other plays, including “Richard II.,” were
also by this same Shakespeare who had written the poems of “Venus and
Adonis” and “Lucrece.”</p>
<p>Francis Meres says: “As the soule of Euphorbus was thought to live in
Pythagoras so the sweete wittie soule of Ovid lives in mellifluous and
honytongued Shakespeare, witnes his ‘Venus and Adonis,’ his ‘Lucrece,’
his sugred Sonnets among his private friends.”</p>
<p>The Sonnets were not printed, so far as is known, before 1609, and
they as has been shown in Chapter 8 repeat the story of Bacon’s
authorship of the plays.</p>
<p>Bacon in 1598, as we have stated in previous pages, fully intended
that at some future period posterity should do him justice.</p>
<p>Among his last recorded words are those in which he commends his name
and fame to posterity, “after many years had past.” Accordingly we find,
as we should expect to find, that when he put Shakespeare’s name to
“Loues Labor’s lost” (the first play to bear that name) Bacon took
especial pains to secure that at some future date he should be
recognised as the real author. Does he not clearly reveal this to us by
the wonderful words with which the play of “Loues Labor’s lost”
opens?</p>
<p>“Let Fame, that all hunt after in their lyues,</p>
<p>Liue registred vpon our brazen Tombes,</p>
<p>And then grace vs, in the disgrace of death:</p>
<p>When spight of cormorant deuouring Time,</p>
<p>Thendeuour of this present breath may buy:</p>
<p>That honour which shall bate his sythes keene edge,</p>
<p>And make us heires of all eternitie.”</p>
<p>Bacon intended that “Spight of cormorant devouring Time” … honour….
should make [him] heir of all eternitie.</p>
<p>Compare the whole of this grand opening passage of “Loues Labor’s
lost” with the lines ascribed to Milton in the 1632 edition of
Shakespeare’s plays when Bacon was [supposed to be] dead. No epitaph
appeared in the 1623 edition, but in the 1632 edition appeared the
following:</p>
<p>“An Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet,</p>
<p>W. Shakespeare.</p>
<p>What neede my Shakespeare for his honour’d bones,</p>
<p>The labour of an Age in piled stones</p>
<p>Or that his hallow’d Reliques should be hid</p>
<p>Under a starrey-pointed Pyramid?</p>
<p>Deare sonne of Memory, great Heire of Fame,</p>
<p>What needst thou such dull witnesse of thy Name?</p>
<p>Thou in our wonder and astonishment</p>
<p>Hast built thy selfe a lasting Monument:</p>
<p>For whil’st, to th’ shame of slow-endevouring Art</p>
<p>Thy easie numbers flow, and that each part,</p>
<p>Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued Booke,</p>
<p>Those Delphicke Lines with deepe impression tooke</p>
<p>Then thou our fancy of her selfe bereaving,</p>
<p>Dost make us Marble with too much conceiving,</p>
<p>And so Sepulcher’d, in such pompe dost lie</p>
<p>That Kings for such a Tombe would wish to die.”</p>
<p>We have pointed out in Chapter 10 and in Chapter 11 how clearly in
“Loues Labour’s lost,” on page 136 of the folio of 1623, Bacon reveals
the fact that he is the Author of the Plays, and we have shewn how the
title pages of certain books support this revelation, beginning with the
title page of the first folio of 1623 with its striking revelation given
to us in the supposititious portrait which really consists of “a mask
supported on two left arms.”</p>
<p>We may, however, perhaps here mention that instructions are specially
given to all who can understand, in the little book which is said to be
a continuation of Bacon’s “Nova Atlantis,” and to be by R. H., Esquire,
[whom no one has hitherto succeeded in identifying].</p>
<p>On Plate 34, Page 149, we give a facsimile of its Title Page which
describes the book and states that it was printed in 1660.</p>
<p>In this book a number of very extraordinary inventions are mentioned
such as submarine boats to blow up ships and harbours, and telegraphy by
means of magnetic needles, but the portion to which we now wish to
allude is that which refers to a “solid kind of Heraldry.” This will be
found on pp. 23-4, and reads as follows:</p>
<p>“We have a solid kind of Heraldry, not made specious with ostentative
pydecoats and titular Atcheivements, which in Europe puzzel the tongue
as well as memory to blazon, and any Fool may buy and wear for his
money. Here in each province is a Register to record the memorable Acts,
extraordinary qualities and worthy endowments of mind of the most
eminent Patricians. Where for the Escutcheon of Pretence each noble
person bears the Hieroglyphic of that vertue he is famous for. E.G. If
eminent for Courage, the Lion; If for Innocence, the White Lamb; If for
Chastity, a Turtle; If for Charity, the Sun in his full glory; If for
Temperance, a slender Virgin, girt, having a bridle in her mouth; If for
Justice, she holds a Sword in the right, and a Scales in the left hand;
If for Prudence, she holds a Lamp; If for meek Simplicity, a Dove in her
right hand; If for a discerning Judgment, an Eagle; If for Humility, she
is in Sable, the head inclining and the knees bowing; If for Innocence,
she holds a Lilie; If for Glory or Victory, a Garland of Baies; If for
Wisdom, she holds a Salt; If he excels in Physic, an Urinal; If in
Music, a Lute; If in Poetry, a Scrowle; If in Geometry, an Astrolabe; If
in Arithmetic, a Table of Cyphers; If in Grammar, an Alphabetical Table;
If in Mathematics, a Book; If in Dialectica she holds a Serpent in
either hand; and so of the rest; the Pretence being ever paralel to his
particular Excellency. And this is sent him cut in brass, and in
colours, as he best phansies for the Field; only the Hieroglyphic is
alwayes proper.”</p>
<p>These references to a solid kind of Heraldry refer to the title pages
and frontispieces of books which may be characterised broadly as
Baconian books, and examples of every one of them can be found in books
extending from the Elizabethan period almost up to the present date.</p>
<p>We place Plate 35, Page 153, before the reader, which is a photo
enlargement of the title page of Bacon’s “History of Henry VII.,”
printed in Holland, 1642, the first Latin edition (in 12mo).</p>
<p>Here is seen the Virgin holding the Salt, shewing the Wisdom of the
Author. In her right hand, which holds the Salt, she holds also two
other objects which seem difficult to describe. They represent “a bridle
without a bit,” in order to tell us the purpose of the Plate is to
unmuzzle Bacon, and to reveal to us his authorship of the plays known as
Shakespeare’s.</p>
<p>But in order to prove that the objects represent a bridle without a
bit, we must refer to two emblem books of very different dates and
authorship.</p>
<p>First we refer our readers to Plate 36, Page 156, which is a photo
enlargement of the figure of Nemesis in the first (February 1531)
edition of Alciati’s Emblems. The picture shews us a hideous figure
holding in her left hand a bridle with a tremendous bit to destroy false
reputations, improba verba.</p>
<p>We next put before our readers the photo reproduction of the figure
of Nemesis, which will be found on page 484, of Baudoin’s Emblems, 1638.
Baudoin had previously brought out in French a translation of Bacon’s
“Essays,” which was published at Paris in 1621. In the preface to his
book of Emblems he tells us that he was induced to undertake the task by
BACON (printed in capital letters), and by Alciat (printed in ordinary
type). In this book of Emblems, Baudoin, on page 484, placed his figure
of Nemesis opposite to Bacon’s name. If the reader carefully examines
Plate 37 he will perceive that it is no longer a grinning hideous
figure, but is a figure of FAME, and carries a bridle in which there is
found to be no sign of any kind of bit, because the purpose of the
Emblem is to shew that Nemesis will unmuzzle and glorify Bacon.</p>
<p>In order to make the meaning of Baudoin’s Emblem still more
emphatically explicit a special Rosicrucian Edition of the same date,
1638, was printed, in which Baudoin’s Nemesis is printed “upside down”;
we do not mean bound upside down, but printed upside down, for there is
the printing of the previous page at the back of the engraving. We have
already alluded on page 113 to the frequent practice of the upside down
printing of ornaments and engravings when a revelation concerning
Bacon’s connection with Shakespeare is afforded to us.</p>
<p>The writer possesses an ordinary copy of Baudoin’s Emblems, 1638, and
also a copy of the edition with the Nemesis printed upside down which
appears opposite Bacon’s name. The copy so specially printed is bound
with Rosicrucian emblems outside.</p>
<p>The reader, by comparing Baudoin’s Nemesis, Plate 37, and the Title
Page of Henry VII., Plate 35, will at once perceive that the objects in
the right hand of the Virgin holding the salt box are correctly
described as representing a “bridle without a bit,” and he will know
that a revelation concerning Bacon and Shakespeare is going to be given
to him. Now we will tell him the whole story. On the right of the
picture, Plate 35 (the reader’s left) we see a knight in full armour,
and also a philosopher who is, as the roses on his shoes tell us, a
Rosicrucian philosopher. On the left on a lower level is the same
philosopher, evidently Bacon, but without the roses on his shoes. He is
holding the shaft of a spear with which he seems to stop the wheel. By
his side stands what appears to be a Knight or Esquire, but the man’s
sword is girt on the wrong side, he wears a lace collar and lace
trimming to his breeches, and he wears actor’s boots (see Plate 28, Page
118, and Plate 132, Page 127).</p>
<p>We are therefore forced to conclude that he is an Actor. And, lo, he
wears but ONE SPUR. He is therefore a Shake-spur Actor (on Plate 27,
Page 115, is shewn a Shake-spur on horseback). This same Actor is also
shaking the spear which is held by the philosopher. He is therefore also
a Shake-spear Actor. And now we can read the symbols on the wheel which
is over his head: the “mirror up to nature,” “the rod for the back of
fools,” the “basin to hold your guilty blood” (“Titus Andronicus,” v.
2), and “the fool’s bawble.” On the other side of the spear: the spade
the symbol of the workman, the cap the symbol of the gentleman, the
crown the symbol of the peer, the royal crown, and lastly the Imperial
crown. Bacon says Henry VII. wore an Imperial crown. Quite easily now we
can read the whole story.</p>
<p>The “History of Henry VII.,” though in this picture displayed on a
stage curtain, is set forth by Bacon in prose while the rest of the
Histories of England are given to the world by Bacon by means of his
pseudonym the Shake-spear Actor at the Globe to which that figure is
pointing.</p>
<p>Plain as the plate appears to the instructed eye it seems hitherto to
have failed to reveal to the uninstructed its clear meaning that</p>
<p>BACON IS SHAKE-SPEARE.</p>
