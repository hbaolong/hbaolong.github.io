ENGLAND.</p>
<p>A PRAYER MADE AND USED BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR BACON</p>
<p>THE STUDENT’S PRAYER.</p>
<p>THE WRITER’S PRAYER.</p>
<p>A PRAYER, OR PSALM, MADE BY THE LORD BACON, CHANCELLOR OF
ENGLAND.</p>
<p>Most gracious Lord God, my merciful Father, from my youth up, my
Creator, my Redeemer, my Comforter. Thou, Lord, soundest and searchest
the depths and secrets of all hearts: thou acknowledges! the upright of
heart: thou judgest the hypocrite: thou ponderest men’s thoughts and
doings as in a balance: thou measurest their intentions as with a line:
vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid from thee.</p>
<p>Remember, O Lord, how thy servant hath walked before thee: remember
what I have first sought, and what hath been principal in my intentions.
I have loved thy assemblies: I have mourned for the divisions of thy
church: I have delighted in the brightness of thy sanctuary. This vine,
which thy right hand hath planted in this nation, I have ever prayed
unto thee, that it might have the first and the latter rain; and that it
might stretch her branches to the seas and to the floods. The state and
bread of the poor and oppressed have been precious in mine eyes: I have
hated all cruelty and hardness of heart: I have, though in a despised
weed, procured the good of all men. If any have been my enemies, I
thought not of them; neither hath the sun almost set upon my
displeasure; but I have been as a dove, free from superfluity of
maliciousness. Thy creatures have been my books, but thy Scriptures much
more. I have sought thee in the courts, fields, and gardens, but I have
found thee in thy temples.</p>
<p>Thousands have been my sins,and ten thousands my transgressions; but
thy sanctifications have remained with me, and my heart, through thy
grace, hath been an unquenched coal upon thine altar. O Lord, my
strength, I have since my youth met with thee in all my ways, by thy
fatherly compassions, by thy comfortable chastisements, and by thy most
visible providence. As thy favours have increased upon me, so have thy
corrections; so as thou hast been always near me, O Lord; and ever as my
worldly blessings were exalted, so secret darts from thee have pierced
ire; and when I have ascended before men, I have descended in
humiliation before thee. And now, when I thought most of peace and
honour, thy hand is heavy upon me, and hath humbled me according to thy
former loving-kindness, keeping me still in thy fatherly school, not as
a bastard, but as a child. Just are thy judgments upon me for my sins,
which are more in number than the sands of the sea, but have no
proportion to thy mercies; for what are the sands of the sea, earth,
heavens, and all these are nothing to thy mercies. Besides my
innumerable sins, I confess before thee, that I am debtor to thee for
the gracious talent of thy gifts and graces, which I have neither put
into a napkin, nor put it, as I ought, to exchangers, where it might
have made best profit, but misspent it in things for which I was least
fit: so I may truly say, my soul hath been a stranger in the course of
my pilgrimage. Be merciful unto me, Lord, for my Saviour’s sake, and
receive me into thy bosom, or guide me in thy way.</p>
<p>A PRAYER MADE AND USED BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR BACON</p>
<p>O eternal God, and most merciful Father in Jesus Christ: Let the
words of our mouths, and the meditations of our hearts be now and ever
gracious in thy sight, and acceptable unto thee, Lord, our God, our
strength, and our Redeemer.</p>
<p>O eternal God, and most merciful Father in Jesus Christ, in whom thou
hast made a covenant of grace and mercy with all those that come unto
thee in him; in his name and mediation we humbly prostrate ourselves
before the throne of thy mercies seat, acknowledging that, by the breich
of all thy holy laws and commandments, we are become wild olive
branches, strangers to thy covenant of grace; we have defaced in
ourselves thy sacred image imprinted in us by creation; we have sinned
against heaven and before thee, and are no more worthy to be called thy
children. O admit us into the place even of hired servants. Lord, thou
hast formed us in our mothers’ wombs, thy providence hath hitherto
watched over us, and preserved us unto this period of time: stay not the
course of thy mercies and loving-kindness towards us: have mercy upon
us, O Lord, for thy dear Son Christ Jesus sake, who is the way, the
truth, and the life. In him, O Lord, we appeal from thy justice to thy
mercy, beseeching thee in his name, and for his sake only, thou wilt be
graciously pleased freely to pardon and forgive us all our sins and
disobedience, whether in thought, word, or deed, committed against thy
divine majesty; and in his precious blood-shedding, death, and perfect
obedience, free us from the guilt, the stain, the punishment, and
dominion of all our sins, and clothe us with his perfect righteousness.
There is mercy with thee, O Lord, that thou mayest be feared; yea, thy
mercies swallow up the greatness of our sins: speak peace to our souls
and consciences; make us happy in the free remission of all our sins,
and be reconciled to thy poor servants in Jesus Christ, in whom thou art
well pleased: suffer not the works of thine own hands to perish; thou
art not delighted in the death of sinners, but in their conversion. Turn
our hearts, and we shall be turned; convert us, and we shall be
converted; illuminate the eyes of our minds and understanding with the
bright beams of thy Holy Spirit, that we may daily grow in the saving
knowledge of the heavenly mystery of our redemption, wrought by our dear
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; sanctify our wills and affection by the
same Spirit, the most sacred fountain of all grace and goodness; reduce
them to the obedience of thy most holy will in the practice of all piety
toward thee, and charity towards all men. Inflame our hearts with thy
love, cast forth of them what displeaseth thee, all infidelity, hardness
of heart, profaneness, hypocrisy, contempt of thy holy word and
ordinances, all uncleanness, and whatsoever advanceth itself in
opposition to thy holy will. And grant that henceforth, through thy
grace, we may be enabled to lead a godly, holy, sober, and Christian
life, in true sincerity and uprightness of heart before thee. To this
end, plant thy holy fear in our hearts, grant that it may never depart
from before our eyes, but continually guide our feet in the paths of thy
righteousness, and in the ways of thy commandments: increase our weak
faith, grant it may daily bring forth the true fruits of unfeigned
repentance, that by the power of the death of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ we may daily die unto sin, and by the power of his resurrection
we may be quickened, and raised up to newness of life, may be truly born
anew, and may be effectually made partakers of the first resurrection,
that then the second death may never have dominion over us. Teach us, O
Lord, so to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom;
make us ever mindful of our last end, and continually to exercise the
knowledge of grace in our hearts, that in the said divorce of soul and
body, we may be translated here to that kingdom of glory prepared for
all those that love thee, and shall trust in thee; even then and ever, O
Lord, let thy holy angels pitch their tents round about us, to guard and
defend us from all the malice of Satan, and from all perils both of soul
and body. Pardon all our unthankfulness, make us daily more and more
thankful for all thy mercies and benefits daily poured down upon us. Let
these our humble prayers ascend to the throne of grace, and be granted
not only for these mercies, but for whatsoever else thy wisdom knows
needful for us; and for all those that are in need, misery, and
distress, whom, Lord, thou hast afflicted either in soul of body; grant
them patience and perseverance in the end, and to the end: And that, O
Lord, not for any merits of ours, but only for the merits of thy Son,
and our alone Saviour Christ Jesus; to whom with thee and the Holy
Spirit be ascribed all glory, andandandandc. Amen.</p>
<p>THE STUDENT’S PRAYER.</p>
<p>To God the Father, God the Word, God the Spirit, we pour forth most
humble and hearty supplications; that he remembering the calamities of
mankind, and the pilgrimage of this our life, in which we wear out days
few and evil, would please to open to us new refreshments out of the
fountains of his goodness, for the alleviating of our miseries. This
also we humbly and ear nestly beg, that human things may not prejudice
such as are divine; neither that from the unlocking of the gates of
sense, and the kindling of a greater natural light, any thing of
incredulity, or intellectual night, may arise in our minds towards
divine mysteries. But, rather, that by our mind thoroughly cleansed and
purged from fancy and vanities, and yet subject and perfectly given up
to the divine oracles, there may be given unto faith the things that are
faith’s. Amen.</p>
<p>THE WRITER’S PRAYER.</p>
<p>Thou, O Father, who gavest the visible light as the first-born of thy
creatures, and didst pour into man the intellectual light as the top and
consummation of thy workmanship, be pleased to protect and govern this
work, which coming from thy goodness, returneth to thy glorv. Thou after
thou hadst reviewed the works which thy hands had made, beheldest that
every thing was very good, and thou didst rest with complacency in them.
But man, reflecting on the works which he had made, saw that all was
vanity and vexation of spirit, and could by no means acquiesce in them.
Wherefore, if we labour in thy works with the sweat of our brows, thou
wilt make us partakers of thy vision and thy Sabbath We humbly beg that
this mind may he steadfastly in us; and that thou, by our hands, and
also by the hands of others, on whom thou shall bestow the same spirit,
wilt please to convey a largess of new alms to thy family of mankind.
These things we commend to thy everlasting love, by our Jesus, thy
Christ, God with us. Amen.</p>

<p>FOR THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, SIR ANDREW RAMSAY KNIGHT, BARRON OF
ABBOTS-HALL, andandandandC. LORD PROVOST OF EDINBURGH, AND ONE OF HIS
MAJESTIES MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL.</p>
<p>My Lord,</p>
<p>OF the Union of the two Kingdoms now happily intended, these being
the Elaborate and most Learned Thoughts and Resolutions of that great
States-man, yet more great Lawyer, but most of all, the far greatest
Schollar of his Age and Nation, Sir Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount of St. Alban, presented to our sometimes Great SOVERAIGN, King
James, the most Wise and Learned; I have advised them again to the
Press, for the satisfaction of divers Noble and Worthy Persons, the Book
in which they first came to light, being too voluminous for ordinary
use, and rarely to be found in this Kingdom. And now, my Lord, I have
made bold to give you the trouble of this Address, and present these few
Papers, though small in bulk, yet vast in matter, to your hands, both
upon my own, and the Authors account. Upon mine own, who have ever been
your most humble Client, and have had your noble Friendship and Favour
to countenance me in all my private concerns: And moreover, you do as
Chief Magistrate, govern that City in which I was first educate in the
Peripatetickwalks, and under, and in which, I have for divers years
profest Letters, or practised Chyrurgery and Physick; and with the rest
of my fellow Citizens, have found such refreshment under your Shade and
Care, that I thought it my duty to signifie it by this small testimony
of my thankfulness. And I am sure, that upon the Authors account, there
is not a fitter Person, to whom these Papers could be committed. The
great prudence and knowledge he had in State Affairs, made him very
acceptable to the Kings and People of his own Nation; and the great
moderation, watchfulness and wisdom you have used in governing this
City, one of the greatest Interests of this Kingdom, hath endeared you
to all the Princes and Chiefs of this People. What labour and trouble
you put upon your self to preserve it under the late Usurpers, your very
enemies do acknowledge and praise. How your care and resolution
preserved it from ruine, when the VVest Male-contents came marching to
its very Gates, all that were faithful to His Majesties Service are
ready to witness. And with what sweetness and calmness you have keeped
together the Union of the Burgesses, who were ready, through heat and
unadvisedness, to divide themselves, your late appearance before the
Right Honourable Committee of Trade, and your oppose to those that were
ready to violate the old Sett of the Good-Town, is a testimony above
exception. I could add many more evidences of your great Prudence and
Moderation; but I will rather forbear them, then give the least blush or
trouble to your modesty: Only this I must add, that as your Lordship
hath been a great Preserver of the Union of this Burgh; So I do not
doubt, but you, who are the most eminent Member of a Party not least
concerned in this Affair, I mean the Burroughs, will with your good
advices, endeavour such an Union of the two Kingdoms, as shall most
advance the Glory and Prerogative of our Gracious King, and promove most
the Honour, Trade and Safety of both People. This and your Preservation,
shall ever be the sincere Devotion of,</p>
<p>My Lord, Your most humble Servant,</p>
<p>C. Irvin.</p>
<p>A SPEECH USED BY SIR FRANCIS BACON IN THE LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT,
50. JACOBI, CONCERNING THE ARTICLE OF GENERAL NATURALIZATION OF THE
SCOTS NATION.</p>
<p>IT may please you (Mr. Speaker) Preface I will use none, but put my
self upon your good Opinions, to which I have been accustomed beyond my
deservings. Neither will I hold you in suspence, what way I will choose;
but now at the first, declare my self, that I mean to counsel the House
to Naturalize this Nation. Wherein, nevertheless, I have a request to
make unto you; which is of more efficacy to the purpose I have in hand,
then all that I shall say afterwards. And it is the same which
Demosthenes did, more then once in great Causes of Estate, to the people
of Athens, Ut cum calcul• Suffragiorum, sumant Magnanimitatem Reip. That
when they took into their hands, the Balls whereby to give their Voices,
(according as the manner of them was) They would raise their thoughts,
and lay aside those considerations which their private Vocations and
Degrees mought minister and represent unto them; And would take upon
them cogitations and minds, agreeable to the Dignity and Honour of the
Estate.</p>
<p>For, (Mr. Speaker) as it was aptly and sharply said by Alexander to
Parmenio; when upon the Recital of the great offers which Darius made,
Parmenio said unto him, I would accept these offers, were I as
Alexander: He turned it upon him again, So would I (saith he) were I as
Parmenio. So in this cause, if an honest English Merchant (I do not
single out that State in disgrace, for this Island ever held it
Honourable, but only for an instance of a private profession) If an
English Merchant should say, Surely I would proceed no further in the
Union, were I as the King; It mought be reasonably answered, No more
would the King, were He as an English Merchant. And the like may be said
of a Gentleman of the Countrey, be he never so worthy and sufficient; Or
of a Lawyer, be he never so wise and learned; Or of any other particular
condition in this Kingdom. For certainly (Mr. Speaker) if a man shall be
only or chiefly sensible of those respects, which his particular
Vocation and Degree shall suggest and infuse into him, and not enter
into true and worthy considerations of Estate, he shall never be able
aright to give counsel, or to take counsel in this matter. So that it
this request be granted, I account the cause obtained.</p>
<p>But to proceed to the matter it self. All Consultations do rest upon
Questions comparative. For when a question is de Vero, it is simple, for
there is but one Truth: But when a question is de Bono, it is for the
most part comparative: For there be differing degrees of Good and Evil;
and the best of the Good is to be preferred and chosen, and the worst of
the Evil is to be declined and avoided. And therefore, in a Question of
this nature, you may not look for Answers proper to every inconvenience
alledged; For somewhat that cannot be specially answered, may
nevertheless be encountred and overweighed, by matter of greater moment.
And therefore, the matter which I shall set forth unto you, will
naturally receive this distribution of three parts.</p>
<p>First, an Answer unto those inconveniences which have been alledged
to ensue, if we should give way to this Naturalization; which, I
suppose, you will find not to be so great as they have been made; but
that much dross is put into the ballance, to help to make weight.</p>
<p>Secondly, an Encounter against the remain of those inconveniences
which cannot properly be answered, by much greater inconveniences which
we shall incur, if we do not proceed to this Naturalization.</p>
<p>Thirdly, an Encounter likewise, but of another nature; That is, by
the gain and benefit which we shall draw and purchase to our selves, by
proceeding to this Naturalization. And yet to avoid confusion, which
evermore followeth of too much Generality, it is necessary for me,
before I proceed to perswasion, to use some distribution of the Points
or Parts of Naturalization: which certainly can be no better nor none
other, than the ancient distribution of Jus Civitatis, Jus Suffragii,
vel Tribus, and Petitionis, sive Honorum. For all ability and capacity
is either of private Interest, of Meum andandandand Tuum, or of publick
Service: And the publick consisteth chiefly, either in Voice or in
Office. Now it is the first of these (Mr. Speaker) that I will only
handle at this time, and in this place; and reserve the other two for a
Committee, because they receive more distinction and restriction.</p>
<p>To come therefore to the inconveniences alledged on the other part.
The first of them is, that there may ensue of this Naturalization, a
surcharge of people upon this Realm of England, which is supposed
already to have the full charge and content; and therefore, there cannot
be an adm•ssion of the adoptive, without a diminution of the Fortunes
and Conditions of those that are Native Subjects of this Realm. A grave
objection (Mr. Speaker) and very dutiful; for it proceedeth not of any
unkindness to the Scots Nation, but of a natural fastness to our selves.
For that Answer of the Virgins, Ne forte non sufficiat Vobis
andandandand Nobis, proceeded not out of any envy or malign humour, but
out of providence, and that original charity which begins with our
selves. And I must confess (Mr. Speaker) that as the Gentleman said,
when Abraham and Lot, in regard of the greatness of their Families, grew
pent and straitned; it is true, that (Brethren though they were) they
grew to difference, and to those words, Vade tu ad dextram, andandandand
ego ad sinistram, andandandandc. But certainly, I should never have
brought that example on that side; for we see what followed of it, how
that this separation, ad dextram and ad sinistram, caused the miserable
captivity of the one Brother, and the dangerous, though prosperous war,
of the other, for his rescous and recovery.</p>
<p>But to this objection (M. Speaker) being so weighty and so principal,
I mean to give three several Answers; every one of them being, to mine
understanding, by it self sufficient.</p>
<p>The first is, that this Opinion of the numbers of the Scots Nation,
that should be likely to plant themselves here amongst us, will be found
to be a thing rather in conceit then in event. For (Mr. Speaker) you
shall find these plausible similitudes, of a Tree that will thrive the
better if it be removed into the more fruitful Soil; And of Sheep or
Cattel, that if they find a gap or passage open, will leave the more
barren Pasture, and get into the more rich and plentiful; To be but
Arguments meerly superficial, and to have no sound resemblance with the
transplanting or transferring of Families. For the Tree, we know, by
nature, as soon as it is set in the better ground, can fasten upon it
and take nutriment from it; And a Sheep, as soon as he gets into the
better Pasture, what should let him to graze and feed? But there
belongeth more (I take it) to a Family or particular person, that shall
remove from one Nation to another: For if (Mr. Speaker) they have not
Stock, Means, Acquaintance and Custom, Habitation, Trades, Countenance
and the like; I hope, you doubt not but they will starve in the midst of
the rich Pasture, and are far enough off from grazing at their pleasure.
And therefore, in this point which is conjectural, experience is the
best Guide; for the time past is a Pattern of the time to come. I think
no man doubteth (Mr. Speaker) but his Majesties first coming in was as
the greatest Spring-tide, for the confluence and entrance of that
Nation. Now I would fain understand, in these four years space, and in
the fulness and strength of the Current and Tide, how many Families of
the Scots men are planted in the Cities, Burroughs and Towns of this
Kingdom? For I do assure my self, that, more then some persons of
Quality about his Majesties Person here at the Court and in London, and
some other inferiour persons that have a dependancy upon them; The
Return and Certificate, if such a Survey should be made, would be of a
number extremely small. I report me to all your private knowledges, of
the places where you inhabite.</p>
<p>Now (Mr. Speaker) as I said, Si in Ligno viridi it a fit, quid fiet
in arido? I am sure there will be no more such Spring-tides. But, you
will tell me of a multitude of Families of the Scots Nation in Polonia;
And if they multiply in a Country so far off, how much more here at
hand? For that, (Mr. Speaker) you must impute it, of necessity, to some
special accident of time and place, that draweth them thither. For you
see plainly, before your eyes, that in Germany, which is much nearer,
and in France, where they are invited with Priviledges, and with this
very Priviledge of Naturalization, yet no such number can be found: So
as it cannot be either nearness of place or priviledge of person, that
is the cause. But shall I tell you (Mr. Speaker) what I think; Of all
the places in the world, near or far off, they will never take that
course of life in this Kingdom, which they content themselves with in
Poland: For we see it to be the nature of all men, that they will rather
discover poverty abroad then at home. There is never a Gentleman that
hath over-reached himself in expence, and thereby must abate his
Countenance, but he will rather travel and do it abroad then at home.
And we know well, they have good high Stomachs, and have ever stood in
some terms and emulation with us; and therefore they will never live
here, except they can live in good fashion. So as I assure you
(Mr. Speaker) I am of opinion, that the strife which we have now to
admit them, will have like sequel as that contention had between the
Nobility and People of Rome, for the admitting of a Plebeian Consul;
which while it was in passing, was very vehement and mightily stood
upon: and when the people had obtained it, they never made any Plebeian
Consul, no not in sixty years after. And so will this be for many years,
as I am perswaded, rather a matter in opinion, then in use or effect.
And this is the first Answer that I give to this main inconvenience
pretended, of surcharge of People.</p>
<p>The second Answer which I give to this Objection, is this. I must
have leave to doubt, (Mr. Speaker) that this Realm of England is not yet
peopled to the full. For certain it is, that the Territories of France,
Italy, Flanders and some parts of Germany, do in equal space of ground
bear and contain a far greater quantity of People, if they were mustered
by the Poll. Neither can I see, that this Kingdom is so much inferiour
unto those forraign parts in fruitfulness, as it is in population; which
makes me conceive, we have not our full charge. Besides, I do see
manifestly among us, the badges and tokens rather of scarceness then of
press of people; as drowned Grounds, Commons, Wastes and the like: Which
is a plain demonstration, that howsoever there may bean over swelling
throng and press of people here about London; which is most in our eye,
yet the body of the Kingdom is but thin sown with People. And whosoever
shall compare the ruines and decayes of ancient Towns in this Realm,
with the erections and augmentations of new; cannot but judge, that this
Realm hath been far better peopled in former times, It may be, in the
Heptarchy or otherwise: For generally the Rule holdeth, The Smaller
State, the greater Population, proratd. And whether this be true or no,
we need not seek further then to call to our remembrance, how many of us
serve here in this place, for desolate and decayed Burroughs. Again
(Mr. Speaker) whosoever looketh into the Principles of Estate, must hold
it, that it is the Mediterrane Countries, and not the Maritime, which
need to fear surcharge of People. For all Sea-Provinces, especially
Islands, have another Element besides the Earth and Soil, for their
sustentation. For what an infinite number of people are and may be
sustained by Fishing, Carriage by Sea and Merchandizing? wherein I do
again discover, that we are not at all pinched by multitude of people:
For if we were, it were not possible that we should relinquish and
resign such an infinite benefit of Fishing to the Flemmings, as it is
well known we do. And therefore, I see that we have wastes by Sea, as
well as by Land: which still is an infallible Argument, that our
Industry is not awaked to seek maintainance, by any over great press or
charge of People.</p>
<p>And lastly (Mr. Speaker) there was never any Kingdom, in the Ages of
the world, had, I think, so fair and happy means to issue and discharge
the multitude of their People (if it were too great) as this Kingdom
hath; in regard of that desolate and avasted Kingdom of Ireland, which
(being a Countrey blessed with almost all the Dowries of Nature, as
Rivers, Havens, Woods, Quarries, good Soil and temperate Climate, and
now at last, under his Majesty, blessed also with obedience) doth, as it
were, continually call unto us for our Colonies and Plantations. And so
I conclude my second Answer to this pretended inconvenience of surcharge
of People.</p>
<p>The third Answer (Mr. Speaker) which I give is this. I demand, what
is the worst effect which can follow of surcharge of People? Look into
all Stories, and you shall find it none other then some honourable War,
for the enlargement of their Borders, which find themselves pent, upon
foreign parts. Which inconvenience, in a valourous and warlike Nation, I
know not whether I should term an inconvenience or no: For the saying is
most true, though in another sense, Omne solum forti Patria. It was
spoken indeed of the patience of an exil’d man; but it is no less true
of the valout of a warlike Nation. And certainly (Mr. Speaker) I hope I
may speak it without offence, That if we did hold our selves worthy,
whensoever just cause should be given, either to recover our ancient
Rights, or to revenge our late wrongs, or to attain the Honour of our
Ancestors, or to enlarge the Patrimony of our Posterity; We would never
in this manner forget considerations of Amplitude and Greatness, and
fall at variance about Profit and Reckonings; fitter a great deal for
private Persons, then for Parliaments and Kingdoms. And thus
(Mr. Speaker) I leave this first Objection, to such satisfaction as you
have heard.</p>
<p>The second Objection is, that the Fundamental Laws of both these
Kingdoms of England and Scotland, are yet divers and several; Nay more,
that it is declared by the Instrument, that they shall so continue, and
that there is no intent in his Majesty to make innovation in them: And
therefore, that it should not be seasonable to proceed to this
Naturalization, I hereby to endow them with our Rights and Priviledges,
except they should likewise receive and submit themselves to our Laws.
And this Objection likewise (Mr. Speaker) I allow to be a weighty
Objection, and worthy to be well answered and discussed.</p>
<p>The Answer which I shall offer, is this. It is true, for mine own
part (Mr. Speaker) that I wish the Scots Nation governed by our Laws;
for I hold our Laws, with some reducement, worthy to govern, if it were
the world. But, this is that which I say, and I desire therein your
attention; That, according to the true reason of Estate, Naturalization
is, in order, first and precedent to Union of Laws; in degree, a less
matter then Union of Laws; and in nature, separable, not inseparable,
from Union of Laws. For, Naturalization doth but take out the marks of a
Forraigner; but Union of Laws makes them entirely as our selves:
Naturalization taketh away separation, but Union of Laws doth take away
distinction. Do we not see (Mr. Speaker) that in the administration of
the world, under the great Monarch, God himself, that His Laws are
divers; one Law in Spirits, another in Bodies; One Law in Regions
Coelestial, another Elementary; And yet the Creatures are all one Mass
and Lump, without any vacuum or separation? Do we not see likewise, in
the State of the Church, that amongst people of all Languages and
Linages, there is one Communion of Saints; and that we are all fellow
Citizens, and naturalized of the Heavenly Hierusalem: And yet,
nevertheless, divers and several Ecclesiastical Laws, Policies and
Hierarchies? According to the Speech of that worthy Father, In veste
varietas sit, scissura non sit. And therefore, certainly (Mr. Speaker)
the Bond of Law is the more special and private Bond; and the Bond of
Naturalization the more common and general. For the Laws are rather
Figura Reip. then Forma; and rather Bonds of Perfection, then Bonds of
Entireness. And therefore, we see in the experience of our own
Government, that in the Kingdom of Ireland, all our Statute-Laws, since
Poyning-Laws, are not in force; and yet we deny them not the benefit of
Naturalization. In Gersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, our Common Laws
are not in force; and yet they have the benefit of Naturalization.
Neither need any man doubt, but that our Laws and Customs must in small
time gather and win upon theirs. For, here’s the Seat of the Kingdom,
whence come the supreme Directions of Estate; Here is the Kings Person
and Example, of which the Verse saith,</p>
<p>Regis ad exemplum tot us componitur Orbis.</p>
<p>And therefore, it is not possible, although not by solemn and formal
Act of Estates, yet by the secret operation of no long time, but they
will come under the yoke of our Laws; and so, Dulcis tractus pari jugo.
And this is the Answer I give to this second Objection.</p>
<p>The third Objection is, some inequality in the Fortunes of these two
Nations, England and Scotland; By the commixture whereof, there may
ensue advantage to them, and loss to us: Wherein (Mr. Speaker) it is
well, that this difference or disparity consisteth but in external Goods
of Fortune. For indeed, it must needs be confessed, that for the Goods
of the Mind and Body, they are Alteri Nos, Other our selves. For, to do
them but right, we know in their capacity and understanding, they are a
People ingenious; in Labour industrious; in Courage valiant; in Body
hard, active and comely. More might be said, but in commending them, we
do but in effect commend our selves: for they are of one piece and
continent with us; and the truth is, we are participant both of their
Virtues and Vices. For, if they have been noted to be a Pople not so
tractable in Government, we cannot without flattering our selves, free
our selves altogether from that fault, being a thing indeed incident to
all Martial People. As we see it evident by the example of the Romans
and others: Even like unto fierce Horses, that though they be of better
service then others, yet are they harder to guide and to mannage.</p>
<p>But for this Objection (Mr. Speaker) I purpose to answer it, not by
Authority of Scripture, which saith, Beatius est dare quam accipere; but
by an Authority, framed and derived from the judgement of our selves and
our Ancestors, in the same case as to this point. For (Mr. Speaker) in
all the Line of our Kings, none useth to carry greater commendation then
his Majesties Noble Progenitour, King Edward, the first of that Name:
And amongst his other commendations both of War and Policy, none is more
celebrated then his purpose and enterprise for the Conquest of Scotland;
as not bending his designs to glorious Acquests abroad, but to solid
strength at home: which nevertheless, if it had succeeded well, could
not but have brought in all those inconveniences, of the commixture of a
more opulent Kingdom, with a less, that are now alledged. For it is not
the yoke either of our Armes or of our Laws, that can alter the nature
of the Climate, or the nature of the Soil: Neither is it the manner of
the commixture, that can alter the matter of the commixture. And
therefore (Mr. Speaker) if it were good for us then, it is good for us
now; and not to be prised the less because we paid not so dear for it.
But a more full Answer to this Objection, I refer over to that which
will come after to be spoken, touching Surety and Greatness.</p>
<p>The fourth Objection (Mr. Speaker) is not properly an Objection, but
rather a pre-occupation of an Objection of the other side: For it may be
said, and very materially, whereabout do we contend? The benefit of
Naturalization is by the Law, in as many as have been, or shall be born
since his Majesties coming to the Crown, already settled and invested.
There is no more then, but to bring the Ante-nati into the degree of the
Post-nati; that men grown that have well-deserved, may be in no worse
case then children which have not deserved; and elder brothers in no
worse case then younger brothers. So as we stand upon Quiddam, not
Quantum; being but a little difference of time, of one Generation from
another.</p>
<p>To this (Mr. Speaker) it is said by some, that the Law is not so, but
that the Post-nati are Aliens as well as the rest. A point that I mean
not much to argue; both because it hath been well spoken to, by the
Gentleman that spoke last before me; and because I do desire in this
case and in this place, to speak rather of Convenience than of Law. Only
this will I say, That that opinion seems to me contrary to reason of
Law, contrary to form of pleading in Law, and contrary to Authority and
Experience of Law. For reason of Law, when I meditate of it, Methinks
the wisdom of the Common Laws of England, well observed, is admirable,
in the distribution of the benefit and protection of the Laws, according
to the several conditions of persons, in an excellent proportion. The
degrees are four, but bipartite; Two of Aliens, and two of Subjects. The
first degree is of an Alien, born under a King or State that is an
enemy. If such an one come into this Kingdom without safe conduct, it is
at his peril: The Law giveth him no protection, neither for Body, Lands
nor Goods; So as if he be slain, there is no remedy by any Appeal at the
parties sute, although his Wife were an English woman: Marry at the
Kings sute the case may be otherwise, in regard of the offence to the
Peace. The second degree, is of an Alien that is born under the Faith
and Allegiance of a King or State that is a friend. Unto such a person,
the Law doth impart a greater benefit and protection; that is,
concerning things personal, transitory and moveable; as Goods and
Chattels, Contracts and the like: But not concerning Freehold and
Inheritance: And the reason is, because he may be an enemy, though he be
not. For the State, under the obeysance of which he is, may enter into
quarrel and hostility; and therefore, as the Law hath but a transitory
assurance of him, so it rewards him but with transitory benefits. The
third degree is of a Subject, who having been an Alien, is by Charter
made Denizen. To such an one, the Law doth impart yet a more ample
benefit: For, it gives him power to purchase Free-hold and Inheritance
to his own use, and likewise enables the Children, born after his
Denization, to inherit: But yet, nevertheless, he cannot make Title, or
convey Pedegree from any Ancestour Paramount. For the Law thinks not
good to make him in the same degree with a Subject born; because he was
once an Alien, and so mought once have been an enemy. And Nemo subitò
fingitur: Mens affections cannot be so settled by any benefit, as when
from their Nativity they are inbred and inherent. And the fourth degree,
which is the perfect degree, is of such a person that neither is enemy,
nor can be enemy in time to come, nor could have been enemy at any time
past; And therefore, the Law gives unto him the full benefit of
Naturalization. Now (Mr. Speaker) if these be the true steps and paces
of the Law, no man can deny, but whosoever is born under the Kings
Obedience, never could, in aliquo puncto temporis, be an enemy; (a Rebel
he mought be, but no Enemy) And therefore, in reason of Law, is
naturalized: Nay, contrary-wise, he is bound, Jure Nativitatis, to
defend this Kingdom of England against all Invaders or Rebels: And
therefore, as he is oblieged to the protection of Arms, and that
perpetually and universally; So he is to have the perpetual and
universal benefit and protection of Law, which is Naturalization.</p>
<p>For form of Pleading, it is true, that hath been said, That if a man
would plead another to be an Alien, he must not only set forth
negatively and privatively, that he was born out of the obedience of our
Soveraign Lord the King, but affirmatively, under the obedience of a
forreign King or State in particular; which never can be done in this
case.</p>
<p>As for Authority, I will not press it; you know all what hath been
published by the Kings Proclamations.</p>
<p>And for experience of Law, we see it in the Subjects of Ireland, in
the Subjects of Gersey and Guernsey, parcels of the Dutchy of Normandy;
in the Subjects of Calleis (when it was English) which was parcel of the
Crown of France. But, as I said, I am not willing to enter into an
Argument of Law, but to hold my self to point of Convenience.</p>
<p>So as for my part, I hold all Post-nati naturalized, ipso jure. But
yet, I am far from opinion, that it should be a thing superfluous to
have it done by Parliament; chiefly, in respect of that true principle,
Principum Actiones praecipuè ad famam sunt componendae. It will lift up
a Sign to all the world, of our love towards them, and good agreement
with them. And these are (Mr. Speaker) the matterial Objections which
have been made of the other side, whereunto you have heard mine Answers:
Weigh them in your wisdoms. And so I conclude that general part.</p>
<p>Now (Mr. Speaker) according as I promised, I must fill the other
ballance, in expressing unto you the inconveniencies which we shall
incur, if we shall not proceed to this Naturalization: Wherein, that
inconvenience, which of all others and alone by it self, if there were
none other, doth exceedingly move me, and may move you, is a Position of
Estate, collected out of the Records of time; which is this, That
wheresoever several Kingdoms or Estates have been united in Soveraignty,
if that Union hath not been fortified and bound in with a further Union,
and namely that which is now in question, of Naturalization; this hath
followed, That at one time or other they have broken again, being upon
all occasions apt to revolt, and relapse to the former separation.</p>
<p>Of this assertion, the first example which I will set before you, is
of that memorable Union which was between the Romans and the Latines,
which continued from the Battail at the Lake of Regilla, for many years,
untill the Consulships of T. Manlius and P. Decius. At what time, there
began about this very point of Naturalization, that War which was
called, Bellum Sociale; being the most bloody and pernicious War, that
ever the Roman State endured; wherein, after numbers of Battails, and
infinite Sieges and Surprises of Towns, the Romans in the end prevailed,
and mastered the Latines. But assoon as ever they had the honour of the
War, looking back into what perdition and confusion they were near to
have been brought, they presently naturalized them all. You speak of a
Naturalization in blood; there was a Naturalization indeed in blood.</p>
<p>Let me set before you again, the example of Sparta, and the rest of
Peloponnesus their Associats. The State of Sparta was a nice and jealous
State in this point, of imparting Naturalization to their Confederates:
But what was the issue of it? After they had held them in a kind of
Society and Amity for divers years, upon the first occasion given (which
was no more, then the surprize of the Castle of Thebes, by certain
desperate Conspirators in the habit of Masquers) There ensued immediatly
a general revolt and defection of their Associats; which was the ruine
of their State, never afterwards to be recovered.</p>
<p>Of later time, let me lead your consideration to behold the like
events in the Kingdom of Arragon; which Kingdom was united with Castille
and the rest of Spain, in the persons of Ferdinando and Isabella, and so
continued many years; But yet so, as it stood a Kingdom severed and
divided from the rest of the Body of Spain in Priviledges; and directly
in this point of Naturalization, or capacity of Inheritance. What came
of this? Thus much; That now of fresh memory, not past twelve years
since, only upon the voice of a condemned man, out of the Grate of a
Prison towards the Street, that cried, Fueros, (which is as much as
Liberties, or Priviledges) There was raised a dangerous Rebellion, which
was suppressed with difficulty with an Army Royal, and their Priviledges
disannulled, and they incorporated with the rest of Spain. Upon so small
a spark, notwithstanding so long continuance, were they ready to break
and severe again.</p>
<p>The like may be said of the States of Florence and Pisa; which City
of Pisa being united unto Florence, but not endued with the benfite of
Naturalization, upon the first light of forraign Assistance, by the
expedition of Charles the eighth of France into Italy, did revolt;
though it be since again re-united and incorporated.</p>
<p>The same effect we see in the most barbarous Government; which shews
it the rather to be an effect of Nature. For, it was thought a fit
Policy by the Council of Constantinople, to retain the three Provinces
of Transilvania, Valachia and Moldavia, (which were as the very Nurses
of Constantinople, in respect of their Provisions) to the end, they
moght be the less wasted, only under Vayvods as Vaslals and Homagers,
and not under Bassa’s and Provinces of the Turkish Empire; which Policy
we see, by late experience, proved unfortunate, as appeared by the
revolt of the same three Provinces, under the Arms and conduct of
Sigismund Prince of Transilvania, a Leader very famous for a time; which
Revolt is not yet fully recovered. Whereas we seldom or never hear of
revolts of Princes incorporate to the Turkish Empire.</p>
<p>On the other part (Mr. Speaker) because it is true which the
Logicians say, Opposita, juxta se posita, magis elucescunt: let us take
a view and we shall find, That wheresoever Kingdoms and States have been
united, and that Union corroborate by the Bond of mutual Naturalization;
you shall never observe them afterwards, upon any occasion of trouble or
otherwise, to break and severe again: As we see most evidently before
our eyes, in divers Provinces of France; that is to say, Guien,
Provence, Normandy, Brittain, which, notwithstanding the infinite
infesting troubles of that Kingdom, never offered to break again.</p>
<p>We see the like effect in all the Kingdoms of Spain, which are
mutually naturalized; As Leon, Castile, Valencia, Andaluzia, Granada and
the rest; except Arragon, which held the contrary course, and therefore
had the contrary successe, as we said; and Portugal, of which there is
not yet sufficient Trial.</p>
<p>And lastly, we see the effect in our own Nation, which never rent
assunder, after it was once united; so as we now scarce know whether the
Heptarchy were a Story or a Fable. And therefore (Mr. Speaker) when I
revolve with my self these examples and others, so lively expressing the
necessity of a Naturalization, to avoid a relapse into a separation, and
do hear so many arguments and scruples made on the other side; It makes
me think on the old Bishop, which upon a publick Disputation of certain
Divines, Christians, with some learned men of the Heathens, did
extremely press to be heard; and they were loath to suffer him, because
they knew he was unlearned, though otherwise an holy and well-meaning
Man: But at last, with much ado, he got to be heard; and when he came to
speak, in stead of using Arguments, he did only say over his Belief; but
did it with such assurance and constancy, as did strike the minds of
those that heard him, more then any Argument had done. And so
(Mr. Speaker) against all these witty and subtile Arguments, I say that
I do believe, and would be sorry to be found a Prophet in it, That
except we proceed with this Naturalization (though not perhaps in his
Majesties time, who hath such Interest in both Nations) yet in the time
of his Descendants, these Realms will be in continual danger to divide
and break again. Now if any man be of that careless mind,</p>
<p>—— Maneat nostras ca cura Nepotes;</p>
<p>Or of that hard mind, to leave things to be tryed by the sharpest
Sword; sure I am, he is not of St. Paul’s opinion, who affirmeth, That
whosoever useth not fore-sight and provision for his Family, is worse
then an unbeliever: Much more, if we shall not use fore-sight for these
two Kingdoms, that comprehend so many Families, but leave things open to
the peril of future divisions. And thus have I expressed unto you, the
inconvenience which of all other sinketh deepest with me, as the most
weighty.</p>
<p>Neither do their want other inconveniences (Mr. Speaker) the effect
and influence whereof, I fear, will not be adjourned to so long a day,
as this that I have spoken of. For, I leave it to your wisdom to
consider, whether you do not think, in case by the denyal of this
Naturalization, any pike of alienation or unkindness (I do not say
where) should be thought to be, or noised to be, between these two
Nations, whether it will not quicken and excite all the envious and
malicious humours wheresoever (which are now covered) against us, either
forraign or at home; and so open the way to practices and other engines
and machinations, to the disturbance of this State? As for that other
inconvenience of his Majesties engagement into this Action, it is too
binding and pressing to be spoken of, and may do better a great deal in
your minds, then in my mouth, or in the mouth of any man else; because,
I say, it doth press our Liberty too far. And therefore (Mr. Speaker) I
come now to the third general part of my division, concerning the
Benefits which we shall purchase, by this knitting of the knot surer and
streighter between these two Kingdoms, by the communicating of
Naturalization.</p>
<p>The Benefits may appear to be two; the one Surety, the other
Greatness. Touching Surety (Mr. Speaker) it was well said by Titus
Quintius the Roman, touching the State of Peloponnesus, That the Tortois
is safe within her shell; Testudo intra tegumen tuta est; but if there
be any parts that lye open, they endanger all the rest. We know well,
that although the State at this time, be in a happy Peace; yet, for the
time past, the more ancient enemy to this Kingdom hath been the French,
and the more late the Spaniard; and both these had, as it were, their
several postern Gates, whereby they mought have approach and entrance to
annoy us. France had Scotland, and Spain had Ireland. For these were the
two accesses which did comfort and encourage both these enemies, to
assail and trouble us. We see that of Scotland is cut off, by the Union
of both these Kingdoms, if that it shall now be made constant and
permanent. That of Ireland is likewise cut off, by the convenient
situation of the North of Scotland toward the North of Ireland, where
the sore was: Which we see, being suddainly closed, hath continued
closed by means of this Salve; So as now, there are no parts of this
State exposed to danger, to be a temptation to the ambition of
Forraigners, but the approaches and avenues are taken away. For, I do
little doubt, but those Forraigners, which had so ill success when they
had these advantages, will have much less comfort now, that they be
taken from them. And so much for Surety.</p>
<p>For Greatness (Mr. Speaker) I think a man may speak it soberly, and
without bravery; That this Kingdom of England, having Scotland united,
Ireland reduced, the Sea Provinces of the Low-Countreys contracted, and
Shipping maintained, is one of the greatest Monarchies in Forces, truly
esteemed, that hath been in the world. For certainly, the Kingdoms here
one Earth, have a resemblance with the Kingdom of Heaven; which our
Saviour compareth, not to any great Kernel or Nut, but to a very small
Grain; yet such an one, as is apt to grow and spread. And such, do I
take to be, the constitution of this Kingdom; if indeed we shall refer
our Counsels to Greatness and Power, and not quench them too much with
consideration of Utility and Wealth. For (Mr. Speaker) was it not, think
you, a true Answer that Solon of Greece made to the rich King Cresus of
Lydia, when he shewed unto him a great quantity of Gold that he had
gathered together, in ostentation of his Greatness and Might? But Solon
said unto him, contrary to his expectation; Why, Sir, if another come
that hath better Iron then you, he will be Lord of all your Gold.
Neither is the Authority of Machiavel to be despised, who scorneth the
Proverb of Estate, taken first from a Speech of Mucianus, That Moneys
are the Sinews of War; And saith, There are no true Sinews of War, but
the very Sinews of the Arms of valiant men. Nay more (Mr. Speaker)
whosoever shall look into the seminaries and beginnings of the
Monarchies of the world, he shall find them founded in Poverty. Persia,
a Countrey barren and poor, in respect of the Medes whom they subdued.
Macedon, a Kingdom ignoble and mercenary, until the time of Philip, the
Son of Amyntas. Rome had poor and pastoral beginnings. The Turks, a Band
of Sarmatian Scythes, that in a vagabond manner, made impression upon
that part of Asia, which is yet called Turcomania. Out of which, after
much variety of Fortune, sprung the Ottoman Family, now the terrour of
the world. So we know the Goths, Vandals, Alanes, Huns, Lombards,
Normans, and the rest of the Northern people, in one Age of the world
made their descent or expedition upon the Roman Empire; And came not as
Rovers, to carry away prey and be gone again, but planted themselves in
a number of fruitful and rich Provinces; where not only their
Generations, but their Names, remain till this day: witness Lombardy,
Catalonia, a name compounded of Goth and Alane; Andaluzia, a name
corrupted from Vandelicia; Hungary, Normandy and others. Nay, the
fortune of the Swizzes of late years, (which ate bred in a barren and
mountainous Countrey) is not to be forgotten, who first ruined the Duke
of Burgandy, the same who had almost ruined the Kingdom of France; what
time, after the Battail of Granson, the Rich Jewel of Burgandy, prized
at many thousands, was sold for a few pence by a common Souldier, that
knew no more what a Jewel meant, then did Aesops Cock. And again, the
same Nation, in revenge of a scorn, was the ruine of the French Kings
Affairs in Italy, Lewis the 12th. For, that King, when he was pressed
somewhat rudely by an Agent of the Swizzes to raise their Pensions,
brake into words of choller, What (said he) will these Villains of the
Mountains put a Tax upon me? which words lost him his Dutchy of Millain,
and chased him out of Italy. All which examples (Mr. Speaker) do well
prove Solons opinion, of the Authority and Mastery that Iron hath over
Gold. And therefore, if I shall speak unto you mine own heart, Methinks
we should a little disdain, that the Nation of Spain (which, howsoever
of late it hath grown to Rule, yet of ancient time served many Ages,
first, under Carthage, then under Rome, after under Saracens, Goths and
others) should of late years, take unto themselves that Spirit, as to
dream of a Monarchy in the West, according to that devise, Video Solem
Orientem in Occidente; only because they have ravished from some wild
and unarmed People, Mines and store of Gold: And on the other side, that
this Island of Brittany, seated and manned as it is, and that hath (I
make no question) the best Iron in the world, (that is, the best
Souldiers of the world) should think of nothing but reckonings and
audits, and Meum and Tuum, and I cannot tell what.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I have (I take it) gone through the Parts which I
propounded to my self; Wherein, if any man shall think that I have sung
Placebo, for mine own particular, I would have him know, that I am not
so unseen in the world, but that I discern it were much alike, for my
private Fortune, to rest a Tacebo, as to sing a Placebo, in this
Business. But I have spoken out of the Fountain of my Heart, Credidi,
propter quod locutus sum; I believed therefore I spake. So as my Duty is
performed, the Judgement is yours. God direct it for the best.</p>
<p>A SPEECH USED BY SIR FRANCIS BACON IN THE LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT,
BY OCCASION OF A MOTION CONCERNING THE UNION OF LAWS.</p>
<p>AND it please you (Mr. Speaker) were it now a time to wish, as it is
to advise, no man should be more forward or more earnest then my self in
this wish, That his Majesties Subjects of England and Scotland were
governed by one Law; And that for many Reasons:</p>
<p>First, because it will be an infallible assurance, that there will
never be any relapse in succeeding Ages to a separation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Dulcis tractus pari jugo; If the Draught lye most upon us,
and the yoke lightest upon them, it is not equal.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Qualities, and (as I may term it) the Elements of their
Laws and ours are such, as do promise an excellent temperature in the
compounded Body: For if the Prerogative here be too indefinite, it may
be the Liberty there is too unbounded: If our Laws and proceedings be
too prolix and formal; it may be theirs are too informal and
summary.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I do discern, to my understanding, there will be no great
difficulty in this work. For their Laws, by that I can learn, compared
with ours, are like their Language compared with ours: For, as their
Language hath the same roots that ours hath, but hath a little more
mixture of Latine and French; So their Laws and Customs have the like
grounds that our have, with a little more mixture of the Civil Law, and
French Customs.</p>
<p>Lastly, the mean to this work seemeth to me no less excellent then
the work it self; For if both Laws shall be united, it is of necessity,
for preparation and inducement thereunto, that our own Laws be reviewed
and compiled; Then the which, I think, there cannot be a work that his
Majesty can undertake, in these times of Peace, more Politick, more
Honourable, nor more Beneficial to his Subjects for all Ages;</p>
<p>Pace datâ Terris, Animum ad Civilia vertit</p>
<p>Fura suum, Legesque tulit justissimus Auctor.</p>
<p>For this continual heaping up of Laws, without digesting them, maketh
but a Chaos and confusion, and turneth the Laws many times, to become
but snares for the People, as is said in the Scripture, Pluet super eos
Laqueos. Now, Non sunt pejores Laquei, quam Laquei Legum: And therefore,
this work, I esteem to be indeed a work (rightly to term it) Heroical.
So that for this good wish of Union of Laws, I do consent to the full;
And I think, you may perceive by that which I have said, that I come not
in this to the opinion of others, but that I was long ago settled in it
my self. Nevertheless, as this is moved out of zeal, so I take it to be
moved out of time, as commonly zealous motions are; while men are so
fast carried on to the End, as they give no attention to the Mean. For,
if it be time to talk of this now, it is either because the business now
in hand cannot proceed without it; or because in time and order, this
matter should be precedent; or because we shall leese some advantage,
towards this effect so much desired, if we should go on in the course we
are about. But none of these three, in my judgement, are true; And
therefore, the motion, as I said, unseasonable.</p>
<p>For first, that there may not be a Naturalization, without an Union
in Laws, cannot be maintained. Look into the example of the Church, and
the Union thereof, you shall see several Churches that joyn in one
Faith, one Baptism, (which are the points of spiritual Naturalization)
do many times in Policy, Constitutions and Customs, differ. And
therefore, one of the Fathers made an excellent observation, upon the
two Mysteries; the one, that in the Gospel, where the Garment of Christ
is said to have been without seam; the other, that in the Psalm, where
the Garment of the Queen is said to have been of divers colours; And
concludeth, In veste variet as sit, scissura non sit. So in this case,
(Mr. Speaker) we are now in hand to make this Monarchy of one piece, and
not of one colour. Look again into the examples of forraign Countries,
and take that next us of France; and there you shall find, that they
have this distribution, Pais du droit Escript, and Pais du droit
Constumier. For Gascoign, Languedock, Provence, Daulphenie, are
Countries governed by the Letter or Text of the Civil Law; But the Isle
of France, Tourrain, Berry, Anjou and the rest, and most of all Britain
and Normandy, are governed by Customs, which amount unto a Municipal
Law, and use the Civil Law but only for Grounds, and to decide new and
rare cases; and yet, nevertheless, Naturalization passeth through
all.</p>
<p>Secondly, that this Union of Laws should precede the Naturalization,
or that it should go on, pari passu, hand in hand, I suppose likewise
can hardly be maintained; but the contrary, that Naturalization ought to
precede. Of which my opinion, as I could yield many reasons, so because
all this is but a digression, and therefore ought to be short, I will
hold my self now only to one, which is briefly and plainly this; That
the Union of Laws will ask a great time to be perfected, both for the
compiling, and for the passing; dureing all which time, if this mark of
Strangers should be denyed to be taken away, I fear it may induce such a
habit of Strangeness, as will rather be an impediment than a preparation
to further proceeding. For he was a wise man that said, Opportuni magnis
conatibus transitus Rerum. And in those cases, Non progredi est regredi.
And like, as in a pair of Tables, you must put out the former writing,
before you can put in new; and again, that which you write in, you write
Letter by Letter; but that which you put out, you put out at once: So we
have now to deal with the Tables of mens Hearts, wherein it is in vain
to think you can enter the willing acceptance of our Laws and Customs;
except you first put forth all Notes either of Hostility or forraign
Condition. And these are to be put out simul andandandand semel, at
once, without gradations; whereas the other points are to be imprinted
and engraven distinctly and by degrees.</p>
<p>Thirdly, whereas it is conceived by some, that the communication of
our Benefits and Priviledges is a good hold that we have over them, to
draw them to submit themselves to our Laws. It is an Argument of some
probability, but yet to be answered many wayes: For first, the intent is
mistaken, which is not, as I conceive it, to draw them wholly to a
subjection to our Laws; but to draw both Nations to one uniformity of
Law. Again, to think that there should be a kind of articulate and
indented Contract, that they should receive our Laws to obtain our
Priviledges, it is a matter, in reason of Estate, not to be expected;
being that which scarcely a private man will acknowledge, if it come to
that, whereof Seneca speaketh, Beneficium accipere, est Libertatem
vendere: No, but courses of Estate do describe and delineat another way;
which is, to win them either by Benefit or Custom. For, we see in all
Creatures, that men do feed them first, and reclaim them after: And so
in the first institution of Kingdoms, Kings did first win people by many
Benfits and Protections, before they prest any yoke. And for Custom,
which the Poets call, imponere Morem; who doubts, but that the Seat of
the Kingdom, and the example of the King resting here with us, our
manners will quickly be there, to mak all things ready for our Laws:</p>
<p>And lastly, the Naturalization which is now propounded, is qualified
with such restrictions, as there will be enough kept back, to be used at
all times, for an Adamant of drawing them further on to our desires. And
therefore, to conclude, I hold this motion, of Union of Laws, very
worthy, and arising from very good minds, but not proper for this
time.</p>
<p>To come therefore to that which is now in question; It is no more,
but whether there should be a difference made in this priviledge of
Naturalization, between the Ante-nati and the Post-nati; not in point of
Law (for that will otherwise be decided) but only in point of
Convenience [as if a Law were now to be made, de novo] In which
question, I will at this time, only answer two Objections, and use two
Arguments, and so leave it to your judgement.</p>
<p>The first Objection hath been, that if a difference should be, it
ought to be in favour of the Ante-nati; because they are persons of
merit, service and proof; whereas the Postnati are infants, that (as the
Scripture saith) know not the right hand from the left.</p>
<p>This were good reason (Mr. Speaker) if the question were, of
Naturalizing some particular persons by a private Bill; but it hath no
proportion with the general. For now, we are not to look to respects
that are proper to some, but to those which are common to all. Now then,
how can it be imagined, but that those that took their first breath,
since this happy Union, inherent in his Majesties person, must be more
assured and affectionat to this Kingdom, then those generally can be
presumed to be, which were sometimes Strangers. For, Nemo subitò
fingitur; the conversions of Minds are not so swift as the conversions
of times. Nay, in effects of Grace, which exceed far the effects of
Nature, we see St. Paul makes a difference between those he calls
Neophites, that is, newly grafted into Christianity; and those that are
brought up in the Faith. And so we see, by the Laws of the Church, that
the Children of Christians shall be baptized, in regard of the Faith of
their Parents; But the Child of an Ethnick may not receive Baptism, till
he be able to make an understanding Profession of his Faith.</p>
<p>Another Ojection hath been made, that we ought to be more provident
and reserved, to restrain the Post-nati then the Ante-nati; because,
during his Majesties time, being a Prince of so approved Wisdom and
Judgement, we need no better caution, then the confidence we may repose
in him: But in the future Reigns of succeeding ages, our caution must be
in Re, and not in Persona.</p>
<p>But, (Mr. Speaker) to this I answer, That as we cannot expect a
Prince hereafter, less like to erre in respect of his Judgement; So
again, we cannot expect a Prince so like to exceed (if I may so term it)
in this point of Benificence to that Nation, in respect of the occasion.
For, whereas all Princes and all men are won, either by merit or
conversation, there is no appearance that any of his Majesties
Descendents, can have either of these causes of Bounty towards that
Nation, in so ample degree as his Majesty hath. And these be the two
Objections which seemed to me most material, why the Post-nati should be
left free, and not be concluded in the same restrictions with the
Ante-nati, whereunto you have heard the Answers.</p>
<p>The two Reasons which I will use on the other side, are briefly
these; The one being a Reason of Common Sense, the other a Reason of
Estate. We see (Mr. Speaker) the time of the Nativity is, in most cases,
principally regarded. In Nature, the time of planting and setting is
chiefly observed. And we see, the Astrologers pretend to judge of the
fortune of the party, by the time of the Nativity. In Laws, we may not
unfitly apply the case of Legitimation, to the case of Naturalization.
For, it is true, that the common Canon Law doth put the Ante-natos and
the Post-natos in one degree; But when it was moved to the Parliament of
England, Barones unâ voce responderunt, Nolumus Leges Angliae mutare.
And though it must be confessed, that the Ante-nati and Post-nati are in
the same degree in Dignities, yet were they never so in Abilities: For,
no man doubts, but the Son of an Earl or Baron, before his Creation or
Call, shall inherite the Dignity, as well as the Son born after.</p>
<p>But the Son of an Attainted Person, born before the Attainder, shall
not inherite as the after-born shall, notwithstanding Charter of
Pardon.</p>
<p>The Reason of Estate is, That any restriction of the Ante-nati is
temporary, and expireth with this Generation: But if you make it in the
Post-nati also, you do but in substance, pen a perpetuity of
Separation.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in this point I have been short, because I little
expected this doubt, as to point of Convenience; and therefore, will not
much labour, where, I suppose, there is no greater opposition.</p>
<p>A BRIEF DISCOURSE, OF THE HAPPY UNION OF THE KINGDOMES OF ENGLAND AND
SCOTLAND.</p>
<p>Dedicated in private to His MAJESTY.</p>
<p>I Do not find it strange (excellent King) that when Heraclitus (he
that was surnamed, the Obscure) had set forth a certain Book (which is
not now extant) many men took it for a Discourse of Nature, and many
others took it for a Treatise of Policy. For there is a great affinity
and consent between the Rules of Nature, and the true Rules of Policy.
The one being nothing else, but an Order in the Government of the World;
And the other, an Order in the Government of an Estate. And therefore,
the education and erudition of the Kings of Persia was in a Science,
which was termed by a Name then of great Reverence; but now degenerate,
and taken in the ill part. For the Perasin Magick, which was the secret
Literature of their Kings, was an application of the Contemplations and
Observations of Nature, unto a sense Politick; taking the fundamental
Laws of Nature, and the Branches and Passages of them, as an Original or
first Model, whence to take and describe a Copy and Imitation for
Government.</p>
<p>After this manner, the foresaid Instructers set before their Kings,
the examples of the Celestial Bodies, the Sun, the Moon and the rest,
which have great glory and veneration, but no rest or intromission,
being in a perpetual office of motion, for the cherishing (in turn and
in course) of inferiour Bodies: Expressing likewise the true manner of
the motions of Government; which though they ought to be swift and
rapide, in respect of dispatch and occasions; yet are they to be
constant and regular, without wavering or confusion.</p>
<p>So did they represent unto them, how the Heavens do not enrich
themselves by the Earth and the Sea; nor keep no dead Stock nor
untouched Treasures of that they draw to them from below: But whatsoever
moisture they do levy and take from both Elements in vapours, they do
spend and turn back again in showers; only holding and storing them up
for a time, to the end, to issue and distribute them in season.</p>
<p>But, chiefly, they did expresse and expound unto them, that
fundamental Law of Nature, whereby all things do subsist and are
preserved; which is, that every thing in Nature, although it hath his
private and particular affection and appetite, and doth follow and
pursue the same in small moments, and when it is free and delivered from
more general and common respects; yet, neverthelesse, when there is
question or case, for sustaining of the more general, they for sake
their own particularities, and attend and conspire to uphold the
publick.</p>
<p>So we see, the Iron, in small quantity, will ascend and approach to
the Load-stone, upon a particular sympathy; But, if it be any quantity
of moment, it leaveth his appetite of amity to the Load-stone, and like
a good Patriot, falleth to the Earth; which is the Place and Region of
massy Bodies.</p>
<p>So again, the Water, and other like Bodies, do fall towards the
Center of the Earth, which is (as was said) their Region or Countrey:
And yet, we see nothing more usual in all Water-works and Engines, then
that the Water (rather then to suffer any distraction or dis-union in
Nature) will ascend, for saking the love to his own Region or Countrey,
and applying it self to the Body next adjoyning.</p>
<p>But, it were too long a digression to proceed to more examples of
this kind. Your Majesty your self, did fall upon a passage of this
nature, in your gracious Speech of thanks unto your Council; when
acknowledging Princely, their vigilancies and well-deservings, it
pleased you to note, that it was a success and event above the course of
nature, to have so great Change, with so great a Quiet; Forasmuch as
suddain mutations, as well in State as in Nature, are rarely without
violence and perturbation. So as still I conclude, there is (as was
said) a congruity between the principles of Nature and Policy. And lest
that instance may seem to oppone to this Assertion, I may, even in that
particular, with your Majesties favour, offer unto you a Type or Pattern
in Nature, much resembling this event in your State: Namely Earthquakes,
which many of them bring ever much terrour and wonder, but no actual
hurt; the Earth trembling for a moment, and suddenly stablishing in
perfect quiet, as it was before.</p>
<p>This knowledge then, of making the Government of the World a mirrour
for the Government of a State, being a Wisdom almost lost (whereof the
reason I take to be, because of the difficulty for one man to imbrace
both Philosophies) I have thought good to make some proof (as far as my
weakness, and the straights of my time will suffer) to revive in the
handling of one particular, wherewith now I most humbly present your
Majesty: For surely, as hath been said, it is a form of Discourse
anciently used towards Kings; And to what King should it be more proper,
then to a King that is studious to conjoin contemplative Vertue and
active Vertue together?</p>
<p>Your Majesty is the first King that had the Honour to be Lapis
Angularis, to unite these two mighty and warlike Nations of England and
Scotland, under one Soveraignty and Monarchy. It doth not appear, by the
Records and Memories of any true History, or scarcely by the fiction and
pleasure of any fabulous Narration or Tradition, That ever, of any
Antiquity, this Island of Great Britain was united under one King before
this day. And yet there be no Mountains or races of Hills, there be no
Seas nor great Rivers, there is no diversity of Tongue or Language, that
hath invited or provoked this ancient Separation or Divorce. The lot of
Spain was, to have the several Kingdoms of that Continent (Portugal only
except) to be united in an Age not long past; and now in our Age, that
of Portugal also, which was the last that held out, to be incorporate
with the rest. The lot of France hath been, much about the same time,
likewise to have re-annexed unto that Crown, the several Dutchies and
Portions which were in former times dismembred. The lot of this Island
is the last, reserved for your Majesties happy times, by the special
Providence and Favour of God; who hath brought your Majesty to this
happy conjunction with great consent of Hearts, and in the strength of
your Years, and in the maturity of your Experience. It resteth but, that
(as I promised) I set before your Majesties Princely consideration, the
grounds of Nature touching the Union and Commixture of Bodies; and the
correspondence which they have with the grounds of Policy, in the
conjunction of States and Kingdoms.</p>
<p>First, therefore, that Position, Vis unita fortior, being one of the
common notions of the Mind, needeth not much to be induced or
illustrate.</p>
<p>We see the Sun, when he entereth, and while he continueth, under the
Sign of Leo, causeth more vehement heats then when he is in Cancer; what
time, his Beams are nevertheless more perpendicular. The reason whereof,
in great part, hath been truly ascribed to the conjunction and
corradiation, in that place of Heaven, of the Sun, with the four Stars
of the first magnitude; Syrius, Canicula, Cor Leonis, and Cauda
Leonis.</p>
<p>So the Moon likewise, by ancient tradition, while she is in the same
Sign of Leo, is said to be at the Heart; which is not for any affinity
which that place of Heaven can have with that part of mans Body; but
only, because the Moon is then, by reason of the conjunction and
nearness with the Stars aforenamed, in the greatest strength of
influence; and so worketh upon that part in inferiour Bodies, which is
most Vital and Principal.</p>
<p>So we see, Waters and Liquors, in small quantity, do easily putrifie
and corrupt; but in large quantity, subsist long, by reason of the
strength they receive by union.</p>
<p>So in Earthquakes, the more general do little hurt, by reason of the
united weight which they offer to subvert; but narrow and particular
Earthquakes have many times overturned whole Towns and Cities.</p>
<p>So then, this point, touching the force of Union, is evident. And
therefore, it is more fit to speak of the manner of Union; wherein
again, it will not be pertinent to handle one kind of Union, which is
Union by Victory, when one Body doth meerly subdue another, and
converteth the same into his own nature, extinguishing and expulsing
what part soever of it it cannot overcome. As when the Fire converteth
the Wood into Fire, purging away the smoak and the ashes, as unapt
Matter to enflame: Or, when the Body of a Living Creature doth convert
and assimilate Food and Nourishment, purging and expelling whatsoever it
cannot convert. For, these Representations do answer, in matter of
Policy, to Union of Countries by conquest, where the conquering State
doth extinguish, extirpate and expulse any part of the State conquered,
which it findeth so contrary, as it cannot alter and convert it. And
therefore, leaving violent Unions, we will consider only of natural
Unions.</p>
<p>The difference is excellent, which the best Observers in Nature do
take between Compositio and Mistio, putting together and mingling; the
one being but a conjunction of Bodies in place, the other in quality and
consent; the one the Mother of Sedition and Alteration; the other of
Peace and Continuance; the one rather a Confusion then an Union, the
other properly an Union. Therefore, we see those Bodies, which they call
imperfectè mista, last not, but are speedily dissolved. For, take for
example, Snow or Froath, which are compositions of Air and Water, and in
them you may behold, how easily they severe and dissolve, the Water
closing together and excluding the Air.</p>
<p>So those three Bodies, which the Alchymists do so much celebrate, as
the three Principles of things; that is to say, Earth, Water and Oyl,
(which it pleaseth them to term, Salt, Mercury and Sulphur) we see, if
they be united only by composition or putting together, how weakly and
rudely they do incorporate: For Water and Earth maketh but an unperfect
slime; and if they be forced together by agitation, yet by a little
settling, the Earth resideth in the bottom. So Water and Oyl, though by
agitation it be brought into an Oyntment; yet, after a little settling,
the Oyl will float on the top: So as such imperfect mistures continue no
longer then they are forced; and still in the end, the worthiest getteth
above.</p>
<p>But otherwise it is of perfect mistures. For we see these three
Bodies of Earth, Water and Oyl, when they are joined in a Vegetable or
Mineral, they are so united, as without great subtilty of Art and force
of Extraction, they cannot be separated and reduced into the same simple
Bodies again. So as the difference between Compositio and Mistio,
clearly. set down is this; That Compositio is the joining or putting
together of Bodies, without a new Form; and Mistio is the joining or
putting together of Bodies, under a new Form. For, the new form is
commune Vinculum; and without that, the old Form will be at strife and
discord.</p>
<p>Now, to reflect this Light of Nature upon matter of Estate: There
hath been put in practice, these two several kinds of Policy, in uniting
and conjoining of States and Kingdoms: The one to retain the ancient
Form still severed, and only conjoined in Soveraignty; The other to
superinduce a new Form, agreeable and convenient to the entire State.
The former of these hath been more usual, and is more easie; but the
latter is more happy. For, if a man do attentively revolve Histories of
all Nations, and judge truly thereupon, he will make this conclusion,
That there was never any States that were good commixtures, but the
Romans. Which because it was the best State of the World, and is the
best Example of this Point, we will chiefly insist thereupon.</p>
<p>In the Antiquities of Rome, Virgil bringeth in Jupiter by way of
Oracle or Prediction, speaking of the mixture of the Trojans and the
Italians:</p>
<p>Sermonem Ausonii Patrum, moresque tenebant,</p>
<p>Utque est nomen erit; Commixti Corpore tantum,</p>
<p>Subsident Teucri, Morem, Ritusque Sacrorum,</p>
<p>Adjiciam; faciamque omnes uno ore Latinos.</p>
<p>Hinc genus Ausonio mistum, quod sanguine surget,</p>
<p>Supra Homines, supra ira Deos, pietate videbis.</p>
<p>Wherein Jupiter maketh a kind of partition or distribution, That
Italy should give the Language and the Laws; Troy should give a mixture
of Men, and some Religious Rites; and both people should meet in one
name of Latines.</p>
<p>Soon after the foundation of the City of Rome, the people of the
Romans and the Sabines mingled upon equal terms. Wherein the interchange
went so even, that (as Livy noteth) the one Nation gave the Name to the
Place, the other to the People. For, Rome continued the name, but the
people were called Quirites; which was the Sabine word, derived of
Cures, the Countrey of Tatius.</p>
<p>But that which is chiefly to be noted, in the whole continuance of
the Roman Government, they were so liberal of their Naturalizations, as
in effect, they made perpetual mixtures. For the manner was, to grant
the same, not only to particular Persons, but to Families and Linages;
and not only so, but to whole Cities and Countries. So as in the end, it
came to that, that Rome was communis Patria, as some of the Civilians
call it.</p>
<p>So we read of Saint Paul, after he had been beaten with Rods, and
thereupon charged the Officer with the violation of the Priviledge of a
Citizen of Rome; The Captain said to him, Art thou then a Romane? That
Priviledge hath cost me dear. To whom Saint Paul replyed, But I was so
born. And yet in another place, Saint Paul professeth himself that he
was a Jew by Tribe: So as it is manifest, that some of his Ancestors
were naturalized; and so it was conveyed to him and their other
descendants.</p>
<p>So we read, that it was one of the first despites that was done to
Julius Casar; That whereas he had obtained Naturalization for a City in
Gaule, one of the City was beaten with Rods of the Consul Marcellus.</p>
<p>So we read in Tacitus, that in the Emperor Claudius time, the Nation
of Gaule, (that part which is called Comata, the wilder part) were
Suiters to be made capable of the honour of being Senators and Officers
of Rome. His words are these: Cum de supplendo Senatu agitaretur,
primoresque Galliae, quae Comata appellatur, faedera andandandand
Civitatem Romanam pridem assecuti, Jus adipiscendorum in urbe Honorum,
expeterent; multus, eâsuper re, variusque Rumor, andandandand studiis
diversis, apud Principem, certabatur. And in the end, after long debate,
it was ruled they should be admitted.</p>
<p>So likewise, the Authority of Nicholas Matchiavel seemeth not to be
contemned; who enquiring the causes of the growth of the Roman Empire,
doth give Judgement, there was not one greater then this, That the State
did so easily compound and incorporate with Strangers.</p>
<p>It is true, that most Estates and Kingdoms have taken the other
course. Of which this effect hath followed, That the addition of further
Empire and Territory hath been rather matter of Burthen then matter of
Strength unto them: yea, and further, it hath kept alive the seeds and
roots of Revolts and Rebellions for many Ages: As we may see, in a fresh
and notable Example of the Kingdom of Arragon; which though it were
united to Castile by Marriage, and not by Conquest, and so descended in
hereditary Union, by the space of more then one hundred years; yet,
because it was continued in a divided Government, and not well
incorporated and cemented with the other Crowns; entred into a
Rebellion, upon point of their Fueros, or Liberties, now of very late
years.</p>
<p>Now, to speak briefly of the several parts of that form, whereby
States and Kingdoms are perfectly united, they are (besides the
Soveraignty it self) four in number; Union in Name, Union in Language,
Union in Laws, Union in Employments.</p>
<p>For Name, though it seem but a superficial and outward matter, yet it
carrieth much impression and enchantment: The general and common name of
Grecia made the Greeks alwayes apt to unite (though otherwise full of
divisions amongst themselves) against other Nations, whom they called
Barbarous. The Helvetian Name is no small Band, to knit together their
Leagues and Confederacies the faster. The common Name of Spain (no
doubt) hath been a special means of the better Union and Conglutination
of the several Kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Granada, Navarrc, Valentia,
Catalonia and the rest; comprehending also now lately Portugal.</p>
<p>For Language, it is not needful to insist upon it, because both your
Majesties Kingdoms are of one Language, though of several Dialects; and
the difference is so small between them, as promiseth rather an
enriching of one Language, then a continuance of two.</p>
<p>For Laws, which are the principal Sinews of Government, they be of
three natures; Jura, which I will term Freedoms or Abilities, Leges and
Mores.</p>
<p>For Abilities and Freedoms, they were amongst the Romans of four
kinds, or rather degrees. Jus Connubii, Jus Civitatis, and Jus
Suffragii, Jus Petitionis, or Honoram. Jus Connubii is a thing in these
times, out of use; for Marriage is open between all diversities of
Nations. Jus Civitatis answereth to that we call Denization or
Naturalization. Jus Suffragii answereth to the Voice in Parliament. Jus
Petitionis answereth to place in Council or Office. And the Romans did
many times severe these Freedoms, granting Jus Connubii, sine Civitate;
And Civitatem, sine suffragio; And Suffragium, sine Jure Petitionis,
which was commonly with them the last.</p>
<p>For those we called Leges, it is a matter of curiosity and
inconveniency, to seek either to extirpate all particular Customs, or to
draw all Subjects to one place or resort of Judicature and Session. It
sufficeth there be an uniformity in the Principal and Fundamental Laws,
both Ecclesiastical and Civil: For in this point, the Rule holdeth which
was pronounced by an ancient Father, touching the diversity of Rites in
the Church; For, finding the Vesture of the Queen in the Psalm (which
did prefigure the Church) was of divers colours; and finding again, that
Christs Coat was without a seam, he concludeth well, In Veste varietas
sit, scissura non sit.</p>
<p>For Manners, a consent in them is to be sought industriously, but not
to be enforced: For nothing amongst people breedeth so much pertinacy in
holding their Customs, as suddain and violent offer to remove them.</p>
<p>And as for Employments, it is no more but in indifferent hand, and
execution of that Verse,</p>
<p>Tyrôs, Triusque mihi nullo discrimine agetur.</p>
<p>There remaineth only to remember, out of the grounds of Nature, the
two conditions of perfect mixture; whereof the former is Time. For the
Natural Philosophers say well, that Compositio is opus Hominis; and
Mistio, opus Naturae. For it is the duty of Man, to make a fit
application of Bodies together: But the perfect fermentation and
incorporation of them, must be left to Time and Nature; and unnatural
hasting thereof, doth disturb the work, and not dispatch it.</p>
<p>So we see, after the Graft is put into the Stock and bound, it must
be left to Time and Nature to make that continuum, which at the first
was but contiguum. And it is not any continual pressing or thrusting
together that will prevent Natures season, but rather hinder it. And so
in Liquors, those commixtures which are at the first troubled, grow
after clear and settled, by the benefit of rest and time.</p>
<p>The second condition is, That the greater draw the less. So we see,
when two Lights do meet, the greater doth darken and dim the less. And
when a smaller River runneth into a greater, it loseth both his Name and
Stream. And hereof, to conclude, wee see an excellent example in the
Kingdoms of Judah and Israel. The Kingdom of Judah contained two Tribes;
the Kingdom of Israel contained ten: King David raigned over Judah for
certain years; And after the death of Isbosheth, the Son of Saul
obtained likewise the Kingdom of Israel. This Union continued in him,
and likewise in his Son Salomon, by the space of seventy years at least,
between them both: But yet, because the Seat of the Kingdom was kept
still in Judah, and so the lesse sought to draw the greater; upon the
first occasion offered, the Kingdoms brake again, and so continued ever
after.</p>
<p>Thus having, in all humbleness, made oblation to your Majesty of
these simple Fruits of my Devotion and Studies; I do wish, and do wish
it, not in the nature of an impossibility (to my apprehension) That this
happy Union of your Majesties two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, may
be in as good an hour, and under the like Divine Providence, as that was
between the Romans and the Sabines.</p>
<p>CERTAIN ARTICLES OR CONSIDERATIONS, TOUCHING THE UNION OF THE
KINGDOMS OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND.</p>
<p>Collected and dispersed for His MAJESTIES better Service.</p>
<p>YOur Majesty being (I do not doubt) directed and conducted by a
better Oracle, then that which was given for light to Aeneas in his
peregrination, (Antiquam exquirite Matrem) hath a Royal, and indeed an
Heroical desire, to reduce these two Kingdoms of England and Scotland,
into the Unity of their ancient Mother Kingdom of Britain. Wherein, as I
would gladly applaud unto your Majesty, or sing aloud that Hymn or
Anthem, Sic itur ad Astra; So in a more soft and submiss voice, I must
necessarily remember unto your Majesty, that Warning or Caveat, Ardua,
quae pulchra; It is an action that requireth, yea, and needeth much, not
only of your Majesties Wisdom, but of your Felicity. In this Argument, I
presumed, at your Majesties first entrance, to write a few Lines indeed
Scholastically and Speculatively, and not Actively or Politickly, as I
held it fit for me at that time, when neither your Majesty was, in that
your desire, declared, nor my self in that Service, used or trusted. But
now, that both your Majesty hath opened your desire and purpose, with
much admiration, even of those who give it not so full an approbation;
and that my self was by the Commons, graced with the first Vote of all
the Commons, selected for that Cause; Not in any estimation of my
ability (for therein so wise an Assembly could not be so much deceived)
but in an acknowledgement of my extream labours and integrity in that
business, I thought my self every wayes bound, both in duty to your
Majesty, and in trust to that House of Parliament, and in consent to the
matter it self, and in conformity to my own travails and beginnings; not
to neglect any pains that may tend to the furtherance of so excellent a
work: Wherein I will indeavour, that that which I shall set down be
Nihil minus quam verba: For length and ornament of Speech are to be used
for perswasion of Multitudes, and not for information of Kings;
especially such a King, as is the only instance that ever I knew, to
make a man of Plato’s opinion, That all knowledge is but remembrance,
and that the mind of Man knoweth all things, and demandeth only to have
her own Notions excited and awaked. Which your Majesties rare and indeed
singular gift and faculty of swift apprehension, and infinite expansion
or multiplication of another mans knowledge by your own, as I have often
observed, so I did extremely admire in Goodwins Cause, being a matter
full of Secrets and Mysteries of our Laws, meerly new unto you, and
quite out of the path of your Education, Reading and Conference:
Wherein, nevertheless, upon a spark of light given, your Majesty took in
so dexterously and profoundly, as if you had been indeed Anima Legis,
not only in execution, but in understanding: The remembrance whereof, as
it will never be out of my mind, So it will alwayes be a warning to me,
to seek rather to excite your Judgement briefly, then to inform it
tediously; and if in a matter of that nature, how much more in this,
wherein your Princely cogitations have wrought themselves and been
conversant, and wherein the principal Light proceeded from your
Self.</p>
<p>And therefore, my purpose is only to break this matter of the Union
into certain short Articles and Questions; and to make a certain kind of
Anatomy or Analysis of the Parts and Members thereof; not that I am of
opinion, that all the Questions which I now shall open, were fit to be
in the Consultation of the Commissioners propounded. For I hold nothing
so great an enemy to good resolution, as the making of too many
questions; specially in Assemblies, which consist of many. For Princes,
for avoiding of distraction, must take many things by way of admittance;
and if questions must be made of them, rather to suffer them to arise
from others, then to grace them and authorize them, as propounded from
themselves. But unto your Majesties private consideration, to whom it
may better sort with me, rather to speak as a Remembrancer, then as a
Counceller, I have thought good to lay before you, all the Branches,
Lineaments and Degrees of this Union, that upon the view and
consideration of them and their circumstances, your Majesty may the more
clearly discern, and more readily call to mind, which of them is to be
imbraced, and which to be rejected; And of these which are to be
accepted, which of them is presently to be proceeded in, and which to be
put over to further time; And again, which of them shall require
Authority of Parliament, and which are fitter to be effected by your
Majesties Royal Power and Prerogative, or by other Policies or Means;
And lastly, which of them is liker to pass with difficulty and
contradiction, and which with more facility and smoothness:</p>
<p>First therefore, to begin with that Question, that I suppose will be
out of question.</p>
<p>Whether it be not meet, that the Statutes which were made touching
Scotland, or the Scots Nation, while the Kingdoms stood severed, be
repealed?</p>
<p>It is true, there is a diversity in these; For some of these Laws
consider Scotland as an Enemy Countrey; Other Laws consider it, as a
Forraign Countrey only: As for example, the Law of Rich. 2. Anno 70.
which prohibiteth all Armour or Victual to be carried to Scotland; And
the Law of 70. of K. H. the 7. that Enacteth all the Scots Men to depart
the Realm, within a time prefixed; Both these Laws and some others,
respect Scotland as a Countrey of hostility: But the Law of 22. of Ed.
4. that endueth Barwick with the Liberty of a Staple, where all Scots
Merchandizes should resort, that should be uttered for England; And
likewise all English Merchandizes that should be uttered for Scotland:
This Law beholdeth Scotland only as a Forraign Nation, and not so much
neither; for there have been erected Staples in Towns in England for
some Commodities, with an exclusion and restriction of other parts of
England.</p>
<p>But this is a matter of the least difficulty; your Majesty shall have
a Calendar made of the Laws, and a Brief of the Effect, and so you may
judge of them: And the like, or reciproque, is to be done by Scotland,
for such Laws as they have concerning England and the English
Nation.</p>
<p>The second Question is, what Laws, Customs, Commissions, Officers,
Garrisons and the like, are to be put down, dis-continued or taken away,
upon the Borders of both Realms?</p>
<p>This point, because I am not acquainted with the Orders of the
Marches, I can say the less.</p>
<p>Herein falleth that question, Whether that the Tennants, who hold
their Tennant-Rights in a greater freedom and exemption, in
consideration of their service, upon the Borders; and that the Countreys
themselves, which are in the same respect, discharged of Subsidies and
Taxes, should not now be brought to be in one degree with other Tennants
and Countreys? Nam cessante causâ, tollitur effectus; wherein, in my
opinion, some time would be given, Quia adhuc corum Messis in herbâ est:
But some present Ordinance would be made, to take effect at a future
time; considering it is one of the greatest points and marks of the
division of the Kingdoms. And because Reason doth dictate, that where
the principal Solution of Continuity was, there the healing and
consolidating Plaister should be chiefly applyed; There would be some
further device, for the utter and perpetual confounding of those
imaginary Bounds (as your Majesty termeth them) And therefore, it would
be considered, whether it were not convenient to plant and erect at
Carleil or Barwick, some Council or Court of Justice, the Jurisdiction
whereof might extend part into England, and part into Scotland; With a
Commission, not to proceed precisely, or meerly according to the Laws
and Customs either of England or Scotland, but mixtly, according to
Instructions by your Majesty to be set down, after the imitation and
precedent of the Council of the Marches here in England, erected upon
the Union of Wales.</p>
<p>The third Question is, that which many will make a great question of,
though perhaps, your Majesty will make no question of it; And that is,
Whether your Majesty should not make a stop, or stand here, and not to
proceed to any further Union, contenting your Self with the two former
Articles or Points?</p>
<p>For it will be said, That we are now well (thanks be to God) and your
Majesty and the State of neither Kingdom is to be repented of; And that
it is true which Hippocrates saith, That, Sana Corpora difficilè
medicationes ferunt; It is better to make alterations in sick Bodies,
then in found. The consideration of which point, will rest upon these
two Branches; What inconveniencies will ensue with time, if the Realms
stand as they are divided, which are yet not found nor sprung up. For it
may be, the sweetness of your Majesties first entrance, and the great
Benefit that both Nations have felt thereby, hath covered many
inconveniencies; Which nevertheless, be your Majesties Government never
so gracious and politick, continuance of time and the accidents of time
may breed and discover, if the Kingdoms stand divided.</p>
<p>The second Branch is, Allow no manifest or important peril or
inconvenience should ensue, of the continuing of the Kingdoms divided;
yet, on the other side, whether that, upon the further uniting of them,
there be not like to follow that addition and encrease of Wealth and
Reputation, as is worthy your Majesties Vertues and Fortune to be the
Author and Founder of, for the advancement and exaltation of your
Majesties Royal Posterity, in time to come.</p>
<p>But, admitting that your Majesty should proceed to this more perfect
and entire Union, wherein your Majesty may say, Majus opus moveo; To
enter into the parts and degrees thereof, I think fit, first, to set
down, as in a brief Table, in what points the Nations stand now at this
present time already united, and in what points yet still severed and
divided; that your Majesty may the better see what is done, and what is
to be done; and how that which is to be done, is to be inferred upon
that which is done.</p>
<p>The Points wherein the Nations stand already united are,</p>
<p>In Soveraignty.</p>
<p>In the Relative thereof, which is Subjection.</p>
<p>In Religion.</p>
<p>In Continent.</p>
<p>In Language.</p>
<p>And now lastly, by the Peace your Majesty concluded with Spain in
Leagues and Confederacies; For now both Nations have the same Friends
and the same Enemies.</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding, there is none of the six Points wherein the
Union is perfect and consummate; But every of them hath some scruple, or
rather grain of separation, enwrapped and included in them.</p>
<p>For the Soveraignty, the Union is absolute in your Majesty and your
Generation; But if it should so be, (which God of his infinite mercy
defend) that your Issue should fail, then the descent of both Realms
doth resort to the several Lines of the several Blouds Royal.</p>
<p>For Subjection, I take the Law of England to be clear, (what the Law
of Scotland is, I know not) That all Scots men, from the very instant of
your Majesties Reign begun, are become Denizens; And the Post-nati are
naturalized Subjects of England, for the time forwards: For, by our
Laws, none can be an Alien, but he that is of another Allegiance then
our Soveraign Lord the Kings; For there be but two sorts of Aliens,
whereof we find mention in our Law; an Alien Ami, and an Alien Enemy;
whereof the former is a Subject of a State in amity with the King, and
the latter a Subject of a State in hostility: But, whether he be one or
other, it is an essential difference unto the definition of an Alien, if
he be not of the Kings Allegiance; As we see it evidently in the
precedent of Ireland, who since they were Subjects to the Crown of
England, have ever been inheritable and capable, as Natural Subjects;
And yet, not by any Statute or Act of Parliament, but meerly by the
common Law, and the Reason thereof. So as there is no doubt, that every
Subject in Scotland was and is in like plight and degree, since your
Majesties coming in, as if your Majesty had granted particularly your
Letters of Denization or Naturalization to every of them, and the
Post-nati wholly Natural. But then, on the other side, for the time
backwards, and for those that were Ante-nati, the Blood is not by Law
naturalized; So as they cannot take it by descent from their Ancestors,
without Act of Parliament. And therefore, in this point, there is a
defect in the Union of Subjection.</p>
<p>For matter of Religion, the Union is perfect in points of Doctrine;
but in matter of Discipline and Government, it is imperfect.</p>
<p>For the Continent; It is true, there are no natural Boundaries of
Mountains or Seas, or Navigable Rivers; But yet there are Badges and
Memorials of Borders: Of which point, I have spoken before.</p>
<p>For the Language; It is true, the Nations are unius Labii, and have
not the first curse of disunion, which was Confusion of Tongues, whereby
one understood not another: But yet the Dialect is differing, and it
remaineth a kind of mark of distinction. But for that, Tempori
permittendum, it is to be left to time: For, considering that both
Languages do concur in the principal Office and Duty of Language, which
is to make a mans self understood; For the rest, it is rather to be
accounted (as was said) a diversity of Dialect then of Language; and as
I said in my first Writing, it is like to bring forth the enriching of
one Language, by compounding and taking in the proper and significant
Words of either Tongue, rather then a continuance of two Languages.</p>
<p>For Leagues and Confederacies; It is true, that neither Nation is now
in hostility with any State, wherewith the other Nation is in amity: but
yet so, as the Leagues and Treaties have been concluded with either
Nation respectively, and not with both jointly; which may contain some
diversity of Articles of straitness with one, more then with the
other.</p>
<p>But many of these matters may perhaps be of that kind, as may fall
within that Rule, In veste variet as sit, scissura non sit.</p>
<p>Now to descend to the particular points, wherein the Realms stand
severed and divided, over and besides the former six points of
separation, which I have noted and placed as the defects or abatements
of the six points of the Union, and therefore shall not need to be
repeated. The points, I say, yet remaining, I will divide into External
and into Internal.</p>
<p>The External Points therefore of the separation, are four.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The several Crowns; I mean, the ceremonial and material
Crowns.</p></li>
<li><p>The second is, the several Names, Stiles or
Appellations.</p></li>
<li><p>The third is, the several Prints of the Seals.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth is, the several Stamps or Marks of the Coins of
Monies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is true, that the External are, in some respect and parts, much
mingled and interlaced with considerations Internal; and that they may
be as effectual to the true Union, which must be the work of time, as
the Internal, because they are operative upon the conceits and opinions
of the People: The uniting of whose hearts and affections, is the life
and true end of this Work.</p>
<p>For the Ceremonial Crowns, the question will be, whether there shall
be framed one new Imperial Crown of Britain, to be used for the time to
come?</p>
<p>Also, admitting that to be thought convenient, whether in the Frame
thereof, there shall not be some reference to the Crowns of Ireland and
France?</p>
<p>Also, whether your Majesty should repeat or iterate your own
Coronation and your Queens; or only ordain, that such new Crown shall be
used by your Posterity hereafter?</p>
<p>The difficulties will be, in the conceit of some inequality, whereby
the Realm of Scotland may be thought to be made an accession unto the
Realm of England. But that resteth in some circumstances; for the
compounding of the two Crowns is equal; The calling of the new Crown,
The Crown of Britain, is equal. Only the place of Coronation, if it
shall be at Westminster, which is the ancient, august and sacred place
for the Kings of England, may seem to make an inequality: And again, if
the Crown of Scotland be discontinued, then that Ceremony which I hear
is used in the Parliament of Scotland, in the absence of the Kings, to
have the Crowns carried in solemnity, must likewise cease.</p>
<p>For the Name, the main question is, whether the contracted Name of
Britain shall be by your Majesty used, or the divided Names of England
and Scotland.</p>
<p>Admitting there shall be an alteration, then the case will require
these following Questions.</p>
<p>First, whether the Name of Britain shall not only be used in your
Majesties Stile, where the entire Stile is recited; and in all other
forms, the divided Names to remain, both of the Realms and of the
People; Or otherwise, that the very divided Names of Realms and People,
shall likewise be changed or turned into special or sub-divided Names of
the general Name; That is to say, for example, whether your Majesty in
your Stile, shall denominate your self, King of Britain, France and
Ireland, andandandandc. And yet, nevertheless, in any Commission, Writ
or otherwise, where your Majesty mentioneth England or Scotland, you
shall retain the ancient Names, as Secundum consuetudinem Regni nostri
Angliae; or whether those divided Names shall be for ever lost and taken
away, and turned into the sub-divisions of South-Britain and
North-Britain, and the People to be South-Britains and North-Britains;
And so in the example foresaid, the Tenour of the like clause to run,
Secundum consuetudinem Britanniae Australis.</p>
<p>Also, if the former of these shall be thought convenient, whether it
were not better for your Majesty, to take that Alteration of Stile upon
you by Proclamation, as Edward the third did the Stile of France, then
to have it enacted by Parliament?</p>
<p>Also, in the alteration of the Stile, whether it were not better to
transpose the Kingdom of Ireland, and put it immediately after Britain,
and so place the Islands together; and the Kingdom of France, being upon
the Continent, last? In regard these Islands of the Western Ocean seem,
by Nature and Providence, an entire Empire in themselves; and also, that
there was never King of England so entirely possest of Ireland as your
Majesty is: So as your Stile to run, King of Britain, Ireland, and the
Islands adjacent, and of France, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The difficulties in this have been already throughly beaten over, but
they gather but to two Heads.</p>
<p>The one, point of Honour, and love to the former Names.</p>
<p>The other, Doubt; left the alteration of the Name may induce and
involve an alteration of the Laws and Policies of the Kingdom: Both
which, if your Majesty shall assume the Stile by Proclamation, and not
by Parliament, are in themselves satisfied: For then the usual Names
must needs remain in Writs and Records; the Forms whereof cannot be
altered, but by Act of Parliament, and so the point of Honour satisfied.
And again, your Proclamation altereth no Law; and so the scruple of a
tacite or implyed alteration of Laws likewise satisfied. But then, it
may be considered, whether it were not a Form of the greatest Honour, if
the Parliament, though they did not enact it, yet should become Suiters
and Petitioners to your Majesty to assume it?</p>
<p>For the Seals, That there should be but one Great Seal of Britain,
and one Chancellor; and that there should only be a Seal in Scotland for
Processes and ordinary Justice; And that all Patents of Grants of Lands
or otherwise, as well in Scotland as in England, should pass under the
Great Seal here, kept about your Person: It is alteration Internal
whereof I do not now speak.</p>
<p>But the Question in this place is, whether the Great Seals of England
and Scotland should not be changed into one and the same form of Image
and Superscription of Britain? which nevertheless is requisite should
be, with some one plain or manifest alteration, lest there be a Buz, and
suspect that Grants of things in England may be passed by the Seal of
Scotland; Or è converso.</p>
<p>Also, whether this alteration of Form may not be done without Act of
Parliament, as the Great Seals have used to be heretofore changed, as to
their Impressions?</p>
<p>For the Moneys, as to the Real and internal consideration thereof,
the question will be, Whether your Majesty should not continue two
Mints? which (the distance of Territory considered) I suppose, will be
of necessity.</p>
<p>Secondly, how the Standards (if it be not already done, as I hear
some doubt made of it in popular rumour) may be reduced into an exact
proportion for the time to come; and likewise the computation, tale, or
valuation to be made exact, for the Moneys already beaten?</p>
<p>That done, the last Question is, (which is only proper to this place)
whether the Stamp, or the Image and Superscription of Britain, for the
time forwards, should not be made the self same in both places, without
any difference at all? A matter also which may be done, as our Law is,
by your Majesties Prerogative, without Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>These points are points of Demonstration, ad faciendum Populum; But
so much the more they go to the root of your Majesties intention, which
is to imprint and inculcate into the Hearts and Heads of the People,
that they are one People and one Nation.</p>
<p>In this kind also, I have heard it pass abroad in speech, of the
erection of some new Order of Knighthood, with a Reference to the Union,
and an Oath appropriat thereunto; which is a point likewise deserveth a
Consideration. So much for the External Points.</p>
<p>The Internal Prints of Separation, are as followeth.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Several Parliaments.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Councils of Estate.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Officers of the Crown.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Nobilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Laws.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Courts of Justice, Trials and Processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Receipts and Finances.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Admiralties and Merchandizings.</p></li>
<li><p>Several Freedoms and Liberties,</p></li>
<li><p>Several Taxes and Imposts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As touching the several States Ecclesiastical, and the several Mints
and Standards, and the several Articles and Treaties of Intercourse with
Forraign Nations, I touched them before.</p>
<p>In these points, of the straight and more inward Union, there will
interveen one principal difficulty and impediment, growing from that
root, which Aristotle in his Politicks, maketh to be the root of all
division and diffention in Common-wealths; And that is, Equality and
Inequality. For the Realm of Scotland is now an Ancient and Noble Realm,
substantive of it self: But, when this Island shall be made Britain,
then Scotland is no more to be considered as Scotland, but as a part of
Britain; no more then England is to be considered as England, but as a
part likewise of Britain: And consequently, neither of these are to be
considered as things entire in themselves, but in the proportion that
they bear to the whole. And therefore, let us imagine (Nam id Mente
possumus, quod Actu non possumus) that Britain had never been divided,
but had ever been one Kingdom; then that part of Soil or Territory,
which is comprehended under the name of Scotland, is in quantity (as I
have heard it esteemed, how true I know not) not past a third part of
Britain; And that part of Soil or Territory which is comprehended under
the name of England, is two parts of Britain; leaving to speak of any
difference of Wealth or Population, and speaking only of Quantity. So
then, if for example, Scotland should bring to Parliament as much
Nobility as England, then a third part should countervail two parts, Nam
si inaequalibus aequalia addas, omnia erunt inaequalia. And this, I
protest before God and your Majesty, I do speak, not as a man born in
England, but as a man born in Britain. And therefore, to descend to
particulars.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Parliament.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Parliaments, the consideration of that Point will fall into
four Questions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first, what proportion shall be kept between the Votes of
England, and the Votes of Scotland.</p></li>
<li><p>The second, touching the manner of Proposition, or possessing of
the Parliament of Causes there to be handled, which in England is used
to be done immediately by any Member of the Parliament, or by the
Prolocutor; and in Scotland is used to be done immediately by the Lords
of the Articles; whereof the one form seemeth to have more Liberty, and
the other more Gravity and Maturity: And therefore, the Question will
be, whether of these shall yield to other? Or, whether there should not
be a mixture of both by some Commissions, precedent to every Parliament,
in the nature of Lords of the Articles; and yet, not excluding the
Liberty of propounding in full Parliament afterwards?</p></li>
<li><p>The third, touching the Orders of Parliament, how they may be
compounded, and the best of either taken.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth, how those, which by inheritance or otherwise, have
Offices of Honour and Ceremony in both the Parliaments, as the Lord
Steward with us, andandandandc. may be satisfied, and duplicitly
accommodated?</p></li>
<li><p>Councils of Estate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the Councils of Estate, while the Kingdoms stand divided, it
should seem necessary to continue several Councils; But if your Majesty
should proceed to a strict Union then, howsoever your Majesty may
establish some Provincial Councils in Scotland, as there is here of
York, and in the Marches of Wales; Yet the Question will be, whether it
will not be more convenient for your Majesty, to have but one Privy
Council about your Person; whereof the principal Officers of the Crown
of Scotland to be, for Dignity sake, howsoever their abiding and
remaining may be as your Majesty shall imploy their Service? But this
point belongeth meerly and wholly to your Majesties Royal Will and
Pleasure.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Officers of the Crown.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Officers of the Crown, the consideration thereof will fall
into these Questions.</p>
<p>First, in regard of the latitude of your Kingdom, and the distance of
place, whether it will not be matter of necessity to continue the
several Officers, because of the impossibility for the Service to be
performed by one?</p>
<p>The second, admitting the duplicity of Officers should be continued,
yet whether there should not be a difference, that one should be the
principal Officer, and the other to be but special and subalterne? As
for example, one to be Chancellor of Britain, and the other to be
Chancellor, with some special addition; As here of the Dutchy,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>The third, if no such specialty or inferiority be thought fit, then
whether both Officers should not have the Title and the Name of the
whole Island and Precincts? As the Lord Chancellor of England, to be
Lord Chancellor of Britain, and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, to be
Lord Chancellor of Britain; But with several Proviso’s, that they shall
not intromit themselves, but within their several Precincts.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Nobilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Nobilities, the consideration thereof will fall into these
Questions.</p>
<p>The first, of their Votes in Parliament (which was touched before)
what proportion they shall bear to the Nobility of England? Wherein, if
the proportion which shall be thought fit be not full, yet your Majesty
may, out of your Prerogative, supply it: For, although you cannot make
fewer of Scotland, yet you may make more of England.</p>
<p>The second is, touching the Place and Precedence; wherein, to marshal
them according to the Precedence of England in your Majesties Stile, and
according to the Nobility of Ireland, that is, all English Earls first,
and then Scots, will be thought unequal for Scotland: To marshal them
according to Antiquity, will be thought unequal for England, because, I
hear their Nobility is generally more ancient: And therefore, the
Question will be, whether the indifferentest way were not, to take them
interchangeably; As for example, first the ancient Earl of England, and
then the ancient Earl of Scotland: And so Alternis vicibus.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Laws.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Laws, to make an entire and perfect Union, it is a matter of
great difficulty and length, both in the collecting of them, and in the
passing of them. For, first, as to the collecting of them, there must be
made by the Lawyers of either Nation, a Disgest, under Titles, of their
several Laws and Customs, as well Common Laws, as Statutes; that they
may be collated and compared, and that the diversities may appear and be
discerned of. And for the passing of them, we see by experience, that
Patrius Mos, is dear to all men, and that men are bred and nourished up
in the love of it; and therefore, how harsh Changes and Innovations are.
And we see likewise, what Disputation and Argument the alteration of
some one Law doth cause and bring forth; How much more the alteration of
the whole Corps of the Law? Therefore, the first Question will be,
whether it be not good to proceed by parts, and to take that that is
most necessary, and leave the rest to time? The parts therefore, or
subject of Laws, are for this purpose, fitliest distributed, according
to that ordinary didivision of Criminal and Civil; and those of Criminal
Causes, into Capital and Penal.</p>
<p>The second Question therefore is, Allowing the general Union of Laws
to be too great a Work to embrace, whether it were not convenient, that
Cases Capital were the same in both Nations? I say the Cases, I do not
speak of the Proceedings or Trials; That is to say, whether the same
Offences were not fit to be made Treason or Fellony in both places?</p>
<p>The third Question is, whether Cases Penal, though not Capital, yet
if they concern the Publick State, or otherwise the discipline of
Manners, were not fit likewise to be brought into one degree? As the
case of Misprision of Treason, the Case of Premunire, the Case of
Fugitives, the Case of Incest, the Case of Simony and the rest.</p>
<p>But the Question, that is more urgent then any of these, is, Whether
these Cases, at the least, be they of an higher or inferiour degree,
wherein the Fact committed or Act done in Scotland, may prejudice the
State and Subjects of England, or è converso; are not to be reduced to
one uniformity of Law and Punishment? As for example, a Perjury
committed in a Court of Justice in Scotland, cannot be prejudicial in
England, because Depositions taken in Scotland, cannot be produced and
used here in England. But a Forgery of a Deed in Scotland, I mean with a
false date of England, may be used and given in evidence in England. So
likewise, the depopulating of a Town in Scotland, doth not directly
prejudice the State of England: But if an English Merchant shall carry
Silver and Gold into Scotland, (as he may) and thence transport it into
Forraign Parts, this prejudiceth the State of England, and may be an
evasion to all the Laws of England ordained in that case: and therefore,
had need to be bridled with as severe a Law in Scotland, as it is here
in England.</p>
<p>Of this kind, there are many Laws.</p>
<p>The Law of the 50. of Rich. the 2. of going over without Licence, if
there be not the like Law in Scotland, will be frustrated and evaded:
For any Subject of England, may go first into Scotland, and thence into
Forraign parts.</p>
<p>So the Laws prohibiting transportation of sundry Commodities, as Gold
and Silver, Ordnance, Artillery, Corn, andandandand c. if there be not a
correspondence of Laws in Scotland, will in like manner be deluded and
frustrate: For any English Merchant or Subject may carry such
Commodities first into Scotland, as well as he may carry them from Port
to Port in England; And out of Scotland to Forraign parts, without any
peril of Law.</p>
<p>So Libels may be devised and written in Scotland, and published and
scattered in England.</p>
<p>Treasons may be plotted in Scotland, and executed in England.</p>
<p>And so in many other cases, if there be not the like severity of Law
in Scotland, to restrain offences, that there is in England (whereof we
are here ignorant, whether there be or no) it will be a gap or stop,
even for English Subjects, to escape and avoid the Laws of England.</p>
<p>But for Treasons, the best is, that by the Statute of 26. King Hen.
the 8th. Ca. any Treason committed in Scotland, may be proceeded with in
England, as well as Treasons committed in France, Rome, or
elsewhere.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Courts of Justice, and Administration of Laws.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Courts of Justice, Trials, Processes, and other Administration of
Laws, to make any alteration in either Nation, it will be a thing so new
and unwonted to either People, that it may be doubted, it will make the
Administration of Justice (which of all other things, ought to be known
and certain, as a beaten way) to become intricate and uncertain: And
besides, I do not see that the severalty of Administration of Justice,
though it be by Court Soveraign of last resort, (I mean, without appeal
or errour) is any impediment at all to the Union of a Kingdom: As we see
by experience, in the several Courts of Parliament in the Kingdom of
France. And I have been alwayes of opinion, that the Subjects of England
do already fetch Justice somewhat far off, more then in any Nation that
I know, the largeness of the Kingdom considered, though it be holpen in
some part, by the Circuits of the Judges, and the two Councils at York,
and in the Marches of Wales established.</p>
<p>But it may be a good Question, whether as commune vinculum, of the
Justice of both Nations, your Majesty should not erect some Court about
your Person, in the nature of the Grand Council of France; To which
Court you might, by way of evocation, draw Causes from the ordinary
Judges of both Nations; For so doth the French King from all the Courts
of Parliament in France; many of which are more remote from Paris, then
any part of Scotland is from London.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Receipts, Finances, and Patrimonies of the Crown.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Receipts and Finances, I see no Question will arise; in regard it
will be matter of necessity, to establish in Scotland a Receipt of
Treasure, for Payments and Erogations to be made in those parts: And for
the Treasure of Spare, in either Receipts, the custodies thereof may
well be several; considering, by your Majesties Commandment, they may be
at all times removed or disposed, according to your Majesties
occasions.</p>
<p>For the Patrimonies of both Crowns, I see no Question will arise;
except your Majesty would be pleased to make one compounded Annexation
for an inseparable Patrimony to the Crown, out of the Lands of both
Nations; And so the like for the Principality of Britain, and for other
Appen•ages, of the rest of your Children; Erecting likewise such
Dutchies and Honours, compounded of the Possessions of both Nations, as
shall be thought fit.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Admiralty, Navy and Merchandizing.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Admiralty or Navy, I see no great question will arise; For I see
no inconvenience your Majesty to continue Shipping in Scotland. And for
the Jurisdictions of the Admiralties, and the Profits and Casualties of
them, they will be respective unto the Coasts over against which the
Seas lye and are situated, As it is here with the Admiralties of
England.</p>
<p>And for Merchandizing, it may be a question, whether that the
Companies of the Merchant-Adventurers of the Turky Merchants and the
Muscovy Merchants (if they shall be continued) should not be compounded
of Merchants of both Nations, English and Scots? For, to leave Trade
free in the one Nation, and to have it restrained in the other, may,
per-case, breed some inconvenience.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Freedoms and Liberties.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Freedoms and Liberties, the Charter of both Nations may be
reviewed; And of such Liberties as are agreeable and convenient for the
Subjects and People of both Nations, one Great Charter may be made and
confirmed to the Subjects of Britain; And those Liberties which are
peculiar or proper to either Nation, to stand in State as they do.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Taxes and Imposts.</li>
</ol>
<p>But for Imposts and Customs, it will be a great Question how to
accommodate them, and reconcile them: For, if they be much easier in
Scotland then they be here in England, (which is a thing I know not)
then this inconvenience will follow, That the Merchants of England may
unlade in the Ports of Scotland, and this Kingdom to be served from
thence, and your Majesties Customs abated.</p>
<p>And for the Question, whether the Scots Merchants should pay
Strangers Custom in England? That resteth upon the point of
Naturalization, which I touched before.</p>
<p>Thus have I made your Majesty a brief and naked Memorial, of the
Articles and Points of this great Cause; which may serve only to excite
and stir up your Majesties Royal Judgement, and the Judgements of wiser
men, whom you will be pleased to call to it: Wherein I will not presume
to perswade, or disswade any thing, nor to interpose mine own opinion;
but expect light from your Majesties Royal Directions, unto the which, I
shall ever submit my Judgement, and apply my Travails. And I most humbly
pray your Majesty, in this which is done, to pardon my errors, and to
cover them with my good intention and meaning, and desire I have to do
your Majesty service, and to acquit the Trust that was reposed in me;
And chiefly, in your Majesties benign and gracious Acceptation.</p>

Shake-Speare by Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence</h2>
<p>Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence, 1st Baronet (1837-1914) was a British
lawyer and Member of Parliament. He is best known for his advocacy of
the Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship, asserting that Francis
Bacon was the author of Shakespeare’s plays. Durning-Lawrence published
a number of books on the subject and promoted public debates with the
academic community. The most notable book on this subject was Bacon is
Shake-Speare (1910). The most famous argument in the book suggests that
the word Honorificabilitudinitatibus, used in the play Love’s Labour’s
Lost, is an anagram for hi ludi, F. Baconis nati, tuiti orbi, Latin for
“these plays, F. Bacon’s offspring, are preserved for the world“. He
derived the argument from an earlier book by Isaac Hull Platt. The later
critic Samuel Schoenbaum argued that the anagram overlooks the fact that
Bacon would have written the genitive of his name as Baconi (from
Baconus), never Baconis (which assumes his name was Baco).</p>
