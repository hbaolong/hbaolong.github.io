<ol type="1">
<li><p>To resume private or particular good, it falleth into the
division of good active and passive; for this difference of good (not
unlike to that which amongst the Romans was expressed in the familiar or
household terms of promus and condus) is formed also in all things, and
is best disclosed in the two several appetites in creatures; the one to
preserve or continue themselves, and the other to dilate or multiply
themselves, whereof the latter seemeth to be the worthier; for in nature
the heavens, which are the more worthy, are the agent, and the earth,
which is the less worthy, is the patient. In the pleasures of living
creatures, that of generation is greater than that of food. In divine
doctrine, beatius est dare quam accipere. And in life, there is no man’s
spirit so soft, but esteemeth the effecting of somewhat that he hath
fixed in his desire, more than sensuality, which priority of the active
good is much upheld by the consideration of our estate to be mortal and
exposed to fortune. For if we might have a perpetuity and certainty in
our pleasures, the state of them would advance their price. But when we
see it is but magni aestimamus mori tardius, and ne glorieris de
crastino, nescis partum diei, it maketh us to desire to have somewhat
secured and exempted from time, which are only our deeds and works; as
it is said, Opera eorum sequuntur eos. The pre-eminence likewise of this
active good is upheld by the affection which is natural in man towards
variety and proceeding, which in the pleasures of the sense, which is
the principal part of passive good, can have no great latitude. Cogita
quamdiu eadem feceris; cibus, somnus, ludus per hunc circulum curritur;
mori velle non tantum fortis, aut miser, aut prudens, sed etiam
fastidiosus potest. But in enterprises, pursuits, and purposes of life,
there is much variety; whereof men are sensible with pleasure in their
inceptions, progressions, recoils, reintegrations, approaches and
attainings to their ends. So as it was well said, Vita sine proposito
languida et vaga est. Neither hath this active good an identity with the
good of society, though in some cases it hath an incidence into it. For
although it do many times bring forth acts of beneficence, yet it is
with a respect private to a man’s own power, glory, amplification,
continuance; as appeareth plainly, when it findeth a contrary subject.
For that gigantine state of mind which possesseth the troublers of the
world, such as was Lucius Sylla and infinite other in smaller model, who
would have all men happy or unhappy as they were their friends or
enemies, and would give form to the world, according to their own
humours (which is the true theomachy), pretendeth and aspireth to active
good, though it recedeth furthest from good of society, which we have
determined to be the greater.</p></li>
<li><p>To resume passive good, it receiveth a subdivision of
conservative and effective. For let us take a brief review of that which
we have said: we have spoken first of the good of society, the intention
whereof embraceth the form of human nature, whereof we are members and
portions, and not our own proper and individual form; we have spoken of
active good, and supposed it as a part of private and particular good.
And rightly, for there is impressed upon all things a triple desire or
appetite proceeding from love to themselves: one of preserving and
continuing their form; another of advancing and perfecting their form;
and a third of multiplying and extending their form upon other things:
whereof the multiplying, or signature of it upon other things, is that
which we handled by the name of active good. So as there remaineth the
conserving of it, and perfecting or raising of it, which latter is the
highest degree of passive good. For to preserve in state is the less, to
preserve with advancement is the greater. So in man,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Igneus est ollis vigor, et caelestis origo.”</p>
<p>His approach or assumption to divine or angelical nature is the
perfection of his form; the error or false imitation of which good is
that which is the tempest of human life; while man, upon the instinct of
an advancement, formal and essential, is carried to seek an advancement
local. For as those which are sick, and find no remedy, do tumble up and
down and change place, as if by a remove local they could obtain a
remove internal, so is it with men in ambition, when failing of the mean
to exalt their nature, they are in a perpetual estuation to exalt their
place. So then passive good is, as was said, either conservative or
perfective.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>To resume the good of conservation or comfort, which consisteth
in the fruition of that which is agreeable to our natures; it seemeth to
be most pure and natural of pleasures, but yet the softest and lowest.
And this also receiveth a difference, which hath neither been well
judged of, nor well inquired; for the good of fruition or contentment is
placed either in the sincereness of the fruition, or in the quickness
and vigour of it; the one superinduced by equality, the other by
vicissitude; the one having less mixture of evil, the other more
impression of good. Whether of these is the greater good is a question
controverted; but whether man’s nature may not be capable of both is a
question not inquired.</p></li>
<li><p>The former question being debated between Socrates and a sophist,
Socrates placing felicity in an equal and constant peace of mind, and
the sophist in much desiring and much enjoying, they fell from argument
to ill words: the sophist saying that Socrates’ felicity was the
felicity of a block or stone; and Socrates saying that the sophist’s
felicity was the felicity of one that had the itch, who did nothing but
itch and scratch. And both these opinions do not want their supports.
For the opinion of Socrates is much upheld by the general consent even
of the epicures themselves, that virtue beareth a great part in
felicity; and if so, certain it is, that virtue hath more use in
clearing perturbations then in compassing desires. The sophist’s opinion
is much favoured by the assertion we last spake of, that good of
advancement is greater than good of simple preservation; because every
obtaining a desire hath a show of advancement, as motion though in a
circle hath a show of progression.</p></li>
<li><p>But the second question, decided the true way, maketh the former
superfluous. For can it be doubted, but that there are some who take
more pleasure in enjoying pleasures than some other, and yet,
nevertheless, are less troubled with the loss or leaving of them? So as
this same, Non uti ut non appetas, non appetere ut non metuas, sunt
animi pusilli et diffidentis. And it seemeth to me that most of the
doctrines of the philosophers are more fearful and cautious than the
nature of things requireth. So have they increased the fear of death in
offering to cure it. For when they would have a man’s whole life to be
but a discipline or preparation to die, they must needs make men think
that it is a terrible enemy, against whom there is no end of preparing.
Better saith the poet:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Qui finem vitae extremum inter munera ponat Naturae.”</p>
<p>So have they sought to make men’s minds too uniform and harmonical,
by not breaking them sufficiently to contrary motions; the reasons
whereof I suppose to be, because they themselves were men dedicated to a
private, free, and unapplied course of life. For as we see, upon the
lute or like instrument, a ground, though it be sweet and have show of
many changes, yet breaketh not the hand to such strange and hard stops
and passages, as a set song or voluntary; much after the same manner was
the diversity between a philosophical and civil life. And, therefore,
men are to imitate the wisdom of jewellers: who, if there be a grain, or
a cloud, or an ice which may be ground forth without taking too much of
the stone, they help it; but if it should lessen and abate the stone too
much, they will not meddle with it: so ought men so to procure serenity
as they destroy not magnanimity.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Having therefore deduced the good of man which is private and
particular, as far as seemeth fit, we will now return to that good of
man which respecteth and beholdeth society, which we may term duty;
because the term of duty is more proper to a mind well framed and
disposed towards others, as the term of virtue is applied to a mind well
formed and composed in itself; though neither can a man understand
virtue without some relation to society, nor duty without an inward
disposition. This part may seem at first to pertain to science civil and
politic; but not if it be well observed. For it concerneth the regiment
and government of every man over himself, and not over others. And as in
architecture the direction of framing the posts, beams, and other parts
of building, is not the same with the manner of joining them and
erecting the building; and in mechanicals, the direction how to frame an
instrument or engine is not the same with the manner of setting it on
work and employing it; and yet, nevertheless, in expressing of the one
you incidently express the aptness towards the other; so the doctrine of
conjugation of men in society differeth from that of their conformity
thereunto.</p></li>
<li><p>This part of duty is subdivided into two parts: the common duty
of every man, as a man or member of a state; the other, the respective
or special duty of every man in his profession, vocation, and place. The
first of these is extant and well laboured, as hath been said. The
second likewise I may report rather dispersed than deficient; which
manner of dispersed writing in this kind of argument I acknowledge to be
best. For who can take upon him to write of the proper duty, virtue,
challenge, and right of every several vocation, profession, and place?
For although sometimes a looker on may see more than a gamester, and
there be a proverb more arrogant than sound, “That the vale best
discovereth the hill;” yet there is small doubt but that men can write
best and most really and materially in their own professions; and that
the writing of speculative men of active matter for the most part doth
seem to men of experience, as Phormio’s argument of the wars seemed to
Hannibal, to be but dreams and dotage. Only there is one vice which
accompanieth them that write in their own professions, that they magnify
them in excess. But generally it were to be wished (as that which would
make learning indeed solid and fruitful) that active men would or could
become writers.</p></li>
<li><p>In which kind I cannot but mention, honoris causa, your Majesty’s
excellent book touching the duty of a king; a work richly compounded of
divinity, morality, and policy, with great aspersion of all other arts;
and being in some opinion one of the most sound and healthful writings
that I have read: not distempered in the heat of invention, nor in the
coldness of negligence; not sick of dizziness, as those are who leese
themselves in their order, nor of convulsions, as those which cramp in
matters impertinent; not savouring of perfumes and paintings, as those
do who seek to please the reader more than nature beareth; and chiefly
well disposed in the spirits thereof, being agreeable to truth and apt
for action; and far removed from that natural infirmity, whereunto I
noted those that write in their own professions to be subject — which
is, that they exalt it above measure. For your Majesty hath truly
described, not a king of Assyria or Persia in their extern glory, but a
Moses or a David, pastors of their people. Neither can I ever leese out
of my remembrance what I heard your Majesty in the same sacred spirit of
government deliver in a great cause of judicature, which was, “That
kings ruled by their laws, as God did by the laws of nature; and ought
as rarely to put in use their supreme prerogative as God doth His power
of working miracles.” And yet notwithstanding in your book of a free
monarchy, you do well give men to understand, that you know the
plenitude of the power and right of a king, as well as the circle of his
office and duty. Thus have I presumed to allege this excellent writing
of your Majesty, as a prime or eminent example of tractates concerning
special and respective duties; wherein I should have said as much, if it
had been written a thousand years since. Neither am I moved with certain
courtly decencies, which esteem it flattery to praise in presence. No,
it is flattery to praise in absence — that is, when either the virtue is
absent, or the occasion is absent; and so the praise is not natural, but
forced, either in truth or in time. But let Cicero be read in his
oration pro Marcello, which is nothing but an excellent table of
Caesar’s virtue, and made to his face; besides the example of many other
excellent persons, wiser a great deal than such observers; and we will
never doubt, upon a full occasion, to give just praises to present or
absent.</p></li>
<li><p>But to return; there belongeth further to the handling of this
part, touching the duties of professions and vocations, a relative or
opposite, touching the frauds, cautels, impostures, and vices of every
profession, which hath been likewise handled; but how? rather in a
satire and cynically, than seriously and wisely; for men have rather
sought by wit to deride and traduce much of that which is good in
professions, than with judgment to discover and sever that which is
corrupt. For, as Solomon saith, he that cometh to seek after knowledge
with a mind to scorn and censure shall be sure to find matter for his
humour, but no matter for his instruction: Quaerenti derisori scientiam
ipsa se abscondit; sed studioso fit obviam. But the managing of this
argument with integrity and truth, which I note as deficient, seemeth to
me to be one of the best fortifications for honesty and virtue that can
be planted. For, as the fable goeth of the basilisk — that if he see you
first, you die for it; but if you see him first, he dieth — so is it
with deceits and evil arts, which, if they be first espied they leese
their life; but if they prevent, they endanger. So that we are much
beholden to Machiavel and others, that write what men do, and not what
they ought to do. For it is not possible to join serpentine wisdom with
the columbine innocency, except men know exactly all the conditions of
the serpent; his baseness and going upon his belly, his volubility and
lubricity, his envy and sting, and the rest — that is, all forms and
natures of evil. For without this, virtue lieth open and unfenced. Nay,
an honest man can do no good upon those that are wicked, to reclaim
them, without the help of the knowledge of evil. For men of corrupted
minds presuppose that honesty groweth out of simplicity of manners, and
believing of preachers, schoolmasters, and men’s exterior language. So
as, except you can make them perceive that you know the utmost reaches
of their own corrupt opinions, they despise all morality. Non recipit
stultus verba prudentiae, nisi ea dixeris quae, versantur in corde
ejus.</p></li>
<li><p>Unto this part, touching respective duty, doth also appertain the
duties between husband and wife, parent and child, master and servant.
So likewise the laws of friendship and gratitude, the civil bond of
companies, colleges, and politic bodies, of neighbourhood, and all other
proportionate duties; not as they are parts of government and society,
but as to the framing of the mind of particular persons.</p></li>
<li><p>The knowledge concerning good respecting society doth handle it
also, not simply alone, but comparatively; whereunto belongeth the
weighing of duties between person and person, case and case, particular
and public. As we see in the proceeding of Lucius Brutus against his own
sons, which was so much extolled, yet what was said?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Infelix, utcunque ferent ea fata minores.”</p>
<p>So the case was doubtful, and had opinion on both sides. Again, we
see when M. Brutus and Cassius invited to a supper certain whose
opinions they meant to feel, whether they were fit to be made their
associates, and cast forth the question touching the killing of a tyrant
being a usurper, they were divided in opinion; some holding that
servitude was the extreme of evils, and others that tyranny was better
than a civil war: and a number of the like cases there are of
comparative duty. Amongst which that of all others is the most frequent,
where the question is of a great deal of good to ensue of a small
injustice. Which Jason of Thessalia determined against the truth: Aliqua
sunt injuste facienda, ut multa juste fieri possint. But the reply is
good: Auctorem praesentis justitiae habes, sponsorem futurae non habes.
Men must pursue things which are just in present, and leave the future
to the Divine Providence. So then we pass on from this general part
touching the exemplar and description of good.</p>
