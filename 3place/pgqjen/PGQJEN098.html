<h4 id="vii.-century.">VII. Century.</h4>
<p>THe Differences betweene Animate and Inanimate Bodies, we shall
handle fully vnder the Title of Life, and Liuing Spirits, and Powers. We
shall therefore make but a briefe Mention of them in this Place. The
Maine Differences are two. All Bodies haue Spirits, and Pneumaticall
Parts within them: But the Maine Differences betweene Animate and
Inanimate, are two: The first is, that the Spirits of Things Animate,
are all Continued with themselues, and are Branched in Veines, and
secret Canales, as Bloud is: And in Liuing Creatures, the Spirits haue
not only Branches, but certaine Cells or Seats, where the Principall
Spirits doe reside, and whereunto the rest doe resort: But the Spirits
in Things Inanimate are shut in, and cut off by the Tangible Parts; And
are not peruious one to another; As Aire is in Snow. The Second Maine
Difference is, that the Spirits of Animate Bodies, are all in some
degree, (more or lesse,) kindled and inflamed; And haue a fine
Commixture of Flame, and an Aeriall Substance. But Inanimate Bodies haue
their Spirits no whit Inflamed, or Kindled. And this Difference
consisteth not in the Heat or Coolenesse of Spirits; For Cloues and
other Spices, Naphtha and Petroleum, haue exceeding Hot Spirits, (hotter
a great deale than Oyle, Wax, or Tallow, andandandandc.) but not
Inflamed. And when any of those Weake and Temperate Bodies come to be
Inflamed, then they gather a much greater Heat, than others haue
Vn-inflamed; besides their Light, and Motion, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Differences, which are Secondary, and proceed from these two
Radicall Differences, are; First, Plants are all Figurate and
Determinate, which Inanimate Bodies are not; For looke how farre the
Spirit is able to Spread and Continue it selfe; So farre goeth the
Shape, or Figure; And then is determined. Secondly, Plants doe nourish;
Inanimate Bodies doe not: They haue an Accretion, but no Alimentation.
Thirdly, Plants haue a Period of Life; which Inanimate Bodies haue not.
Fourthly, they haue a Succession, and Propagation of their Kinde; which
is not in Bodies Inanimate.</p>
<p>The Differences betweene Plants, and Metalls or Fossiles, besides
those foure before mentioned, (For Metalls I hold Inanimate,) are these:
First, Metalls are more Durable than Plants: Secondly, they are more
Solid and Hard: Thirdly, they are wholly Subterrany; Whereas Plants are
part aboue Earth, and part vnder Earth.</p>
<p>There be very few Creatures, that participate of the Nature of
Plants, and Metalls both; Corall is one of the Nearest of both Kindes:
Another is Vitrioll, for that is aptest to sprout with Moisture.</p>
<p>Another speciall Affinitie is betweene Plants and Mould or
Putrefaction: For all Putrefaction (if it dissolue not in Arefaction)
will in the end issue into Plants, or Liuing Creatures bred of
Putrefaction. I account Mosse, and Mushromes, and Agaricke, and other of
those kindes, to be but Moulds of the Ground, Walls, and Trees, and the
like. As for Flesh, and Fish, and Plants themselues, and a Number of
other things, after a Mouldinesse, or Rottensesse, or Corrupting, they
will fall to breed Wormes. These Putrefactions, which haue Affinitie
with Plants, haue this Difference from them; That they haue no
Succession or Propagation, though they Nourish, and haue a Period of
Life, and haue likewise some Figure.</p>
<p>I left once, by chance, a Citron cut, in a close Roome, for three
Summer-Moneths, that I was absent; And at my Returne, there were grown
forth, out of the Pith cut, Tufts of Haires, an Inch long, with little
blacke Heads, as if they would haue beene some Herbe.</p>
<p>The Affinities and Differences betweene Plants and Liuing Creatures,
are these that follow. They haue both of them Spirits Continued, and
Branched, and also Inflamed: But first in Liuing Creatures, the Spirits
haue a Cell or Seat, which Plants haue not; As was also formerly said:
And secondly, the Spirits of Liuing Creatures hold more of Flame, than
the Spirits of Plants doe. And these two are the Radicall Differences.
For the Secondary Differences, they are as follow. First, Plants are all
Fixed to the Earth; Whereas all Liuing Creatures are seuered, and of
themselues. Secondly, Liuing Creatures haue Locall Motion; Plants haue
not. Thirdly, Liuing Creatures nourish from their Vpper Parts, by the
Mouth chiefly; Plants nourish from below, namely from the Roots.
Fourthly, Plants haue their Seed and Seminall Parts vppermost; Liuing
Creatures haue them lower-most: And therefore it was said, not elegantly
alone, but Philosophically; Homoest Planta inuerse; Man is like a Plant
turned vpwards; For the Root in Plants, is as the Head in Liuing
Creatures. Fifthly, Liuing Creatures haue a more exact Figure than
Plants. Sixthly, Liuing Creatures haue more Diuersity of Organs within
their Bodies, and (as it were) Inward Figures, than Plants haue.
Seuenthly, Liuing Creatures haue Sense, which Plants haue not. Eighthly,
Liuing Creatures haue Voluntary Motion, which Plants haue not.</p>
<p>For the Difference of Sexes in Plants, they are oftentimes by name
distinguished; As Male-Piony, Female-Piony; Male-Rose-mary, FemaleRose
mary; Hee-Holly, Shee-Holly; andandandandc. but Generation by Copulation
(certainly) extendeth not to Plants. The nearest Approach of it, is
between the Hee-Palme, and the Shee-Palme; which, (as they report,) if
they grow neare, incline the One to the other: In so much as, (that
which is more strange,) they doubt not to report, that to keepe the
Trees vpright from Bending, they tye Ropes, or Lines, from the one to
the other, that the Contact might be enjoyed by the Contact of a Middle
Body. But this may be Faigned, or at least Amplified. Neuerthelesse, I
am apt enough to thinke, that this same Binarium of a Stronger and a
Weaker, like vnto Masculine and Feminine, doth hold in all Liuing
Bodies. It is confounded sometimes; As in some Creatures of
Putrefaction, wherein no Markes of Distinction appeare: And it is
doubled sometimes; As in Hermaphrodites: But generally there is a Degree
of Strength in most Species.</p>
<p>The Participles or Consiners betweene Plants and Liuing Creatures,
are such chiefly, as are Fixed, and haue no Locall Motion of Remoue,
though they haue a Motion in their Parts; Such as are Oysters., Cockles,
and such like. There is a Fabulous Narration, that in the Northerne
Countries, there should be an Herbe that groweth in the likenesse of a
Lambe, and feedeth vpon the Grasse, in such sort, as it will bare the
Grasse round about. But I suppose, that the Figure maketh the Fable; For
so we see, there be Bee-Flowers, andandandandc. And as for the Grasse,
it seemeth the Plant, hauing a great Stalke and Top, doth prey vpon the
Grasse, a good way about, by drawing the Iuyce of the Earth from it.</p>
<p>The Indian Fig boweth his Roots downe so low, in one yeare, as of it
selfe it taketh Root againe: And so multiplieth from Root to Root;
Making of one Tree a kinde of Wood. The Cause is the Plenty of the Sap,
and the Softnesse of the Stalke, which maketh the Bough, being
ouerloaden, and not stiffely vpheld, weigh downe. It hath Leaues, as
broad as a little Target, but the Fruit no bigger than Beanes. The Cause
is, for that the Continuall Shade increaseth the Leaues, and abateth the
Fruit; which neuerthelesse is of a pleasant Taste. And that (no doubt)
is caused, by the Supplenesse and Gentlenesse of the Iuyce of that
Plant, being that which maketh the Boughes also so Flexible.</p>
<p>It is reported by one of the Ancients, that there is a certaine
Indian Tree, hauing few, but very great, Leaues, three Cubits long, and
two broad; And that the Fruit, being of good Taste, groweth out of the
Barke. It may be, there be Plants, that poure out the Sap so fast, as
they haue no leisure, either to diuide into many Leaues, or to put forth
Stalks to the Fruit. With vs Trees (generally) haue finall Leaues, in
comparison. The Fig hath the greatest; And next it the Vine, Mulberry,
and Sycamore; And the Least are those of the Willow, Birch, and Thorne.
But there be found Herbs with farre greater Leaues than any Tree; As the
Burre, Gourd, Cucumber, and Cole-wort. The Cause is, (like to that of
the Indian Fig,) the hasty and plentifull Putting forth of the Sap.</p>
<p>There be three Things in vse for Sweetnesse; Sugar, Honey, Manna. For
Sugar, to the Ancients it was scarce knowne, and little vsed. It is
found in Canes: Quare, whether to the first Knuckle, or further vp? And
whether the very Barke of the Cane it selfe do yeeld Sugar, or no? For
Honey, the Bee maketh it, or gathereth it; But I haue heard from one,
that was industrious in Husbandry, that the labour of the Bee is about
the Wax; And that he hath knowne in the beginning of May, Honey-Combs
empty of Honey; And within a forthnight, when the Sweet Dewes fall,
filled like a Cellar. It is reported also by some of the Ancients, that
there is a Tree called Occhus, in the Valleyes of Hyrcanis, that
distilleth Honey in the Mornings. It is not vnlike, that the Sap and
Teares of some Trees, may be sweet. It may be also, that some sweet
Iuyces, fit for many vses, may be concocted out of Fruits, to the
Thicknesse of Honey, or perhaps of Sugar; The likeliest are Raisins of
the Sunne, Figs, and Corrans: The Meanes may be enquired.</p>
<p>The Ancients report of a Tree, by the Persian Sea, vpon the
ShoreSands, which is nourished with the Salt-Water; And when the Tide
ebbeth, you shall see the Roots, as it were, bare without Barke, (being
as it seemeth corroded by the Salt,) andandandand grasping the Sands
like a Crab; Which neuerthelesse beareth a Fruit. It were good to try
some Hard Trees, as a Seruice-Tree, or Firre-Tree, by setting them
within the Sands.</p>
<p>There be of Plants, which they vse for Garments, these that follow.
Hempe; Flax; Cotton; Nettles, (whereof they make Nettle-Cloth;) Sericum,
which is a Growing Silke; They make also Cables of the Barke of
Lime-Trees. It is the Stalke that maketh the Filaceous Matter, commonly;
And sometimes the Downe that groweth aboue.</p>
<p>They haue, in some Countries, a Plant of a Rosy Colour, which
shutteth in the Night, Openeth in the Morning, and Openeth wide at
Noone; which the Inhabitants of those Countries say is a Plant that
Sleepeth. There be Sleepers enow then; For almost all Flowers doe the
like.</p>
<p>Some Plants there are, but rare, that haue a Mossy or Downy Root; And
likewise that haue a Number of Threds, like Beards; As Mandrakes; wherof
Witches and Impostours make an vgly Image, giuing it the Forme of a Face
at the Top of the Root, and leaue those Strings to make a broad Beard
downe to the Foot. Also there is a Kinde of Nard, in Creet, (being a
Kinde of Phu) that hath a Root hairy, like a Rough-Footed-Doues foot, So
as you may see, there are of Roots, Bulbous Roots, Fibrous Roots, and
Hirsute Roots. And, I take it, in the Bulbous, the Sap hasteneth most to
the Aire, and Sunne: In the Fibrous, the Sap dollghreth more in the
Earth, and therefore putteth downward: And the Hirsute is a Middle
betweene both; That besides the Putting forth vpwards, and downwards,
putteth forth in Round.</p>
<p>There are some Teares of Trees, which are kembed from the Beards of
Goats: For when the Goats bite and crop them, especially in the
Mornings, the Dew being on, the Teare commeth forth, and hangeth vpon
their Beards: Of this Sort is some kinde of Ladanum.</p>
<p>The Irrigation of the Plaine-Tree by Wine, is reported by the
Ancients, to make it Fruitfull. It would be tried likewise with Roots;
For vpon Seeds it worketh no great Effects.</p>
<p>The way to carry Farraine Roots, a long Way, is to vessell them close
in Earthan Vessells. But if the Vessells be not very Great, you must
make some Holes in the Bottome, to giue some Refreshment to the Roots;
Which otherwise (as it seemeth) will decay, and suffocate.</p>
<p>The ancient Cinnamon, was, of all other Plants, while it grew, the
Dryest; And those Things, which are knowne to comfort other Plants, did
make that more Sterill: For in Showers it prospered worst: It grew also
amongst Bushes of other kindes, where commonly Plants doe not thriue:
Neither did it loue the Sunne: There might be one Cause of all those
Effects; Namely, the sparing Nourishment, which that Plant required.
Quare how farre Cassia, which is now the Substitute of Cinnamon, doth
participate of these Things.</p>
<p>It is reported by one of the Ancients that Cassia when it is
gathered, is put into the Skins of Beasts, newly fleyed; And that the
Skins Corrupting, and Breeding Wormes, the Wormes doe deuoure the Pith
and Marrow of it, and so make it Hollow; But meddle not with the Barke,
because to them it is bitter.</p>
<p>There were, in Ancient Time, Vines, of farre greater Bodies, than we
know any; For there haue beene Cups made of them, and an Image of
Iupiter. But it is like they were Wilde-Vines; For the Vines, that they
vse for Wine, are so often Cut, and so much Digged and Dressed, that
their Sap spendeth into the Grapes, and so the Stalke cannot increase
much in Bulke. The Wood of Vines is very durable, without Rotting. And
that which is strange, though no Tree hath the Twigges, while they are
greene, so brittle, yet the Wood dryed is extreme Tough; And was vsed by
the Captaines of Armies, amongst the Romans, for their Cudgells.</p>
<p>It is reported, that in some Places, Vines are suffered to grow like
Herbs, spreading vpon the Ground; And that the Grapes of those Vines are
very great. It were good to make tryall, whether Plants that vse to be
borne vp by Props, will not put forth greater Leaues, and greater
Fruits, if they be laid along the Ground; As Hops, l-y, Wood bine,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>Quinces, or Apples, andandandandc. if you will keepe them long,
drowne them in Honey; But because Honey (perhaps) will giue them a Taste
Ouerlushious, it were good to make Triall in Powder of Sugar; Or in
Syrrup of Wine onely Boyled to Height. Both these would likewise be
tried in Orenges, Limons, and Pomgranats; For the Powder of Sugar, and
Syrrup of Wine, will serue for more times than once.</p>
<p>The Conseruation of Fruit would be also tried in Vessells, filled
with fine Sand, or with Powder of Chalke; Or in Meale and Flower; Or in
Dust of Oake-wood; Or in Mill.</p>
<p>Such Fruits, as you appoint for Long Keeping, you must gather before
they be full Ripe; And in a Faire and Dry Day, towards Noone; And when
the Wind bloweth not South; And when the Moone is vnder the Earth; And
in Decrease.</p>
<p>Take Grapes, and hang them in an Empty Vessell, well Stopped; And set
the Vessell, not in a Cellar, but in some dry Place; And it is said,
they will last long. But it is reported by some, they will keepe better,
in a Vessell halfe full of Wine, so that the Grapes touch not the
Wine.</p>
<p>It is reported, that the Preseruing of the Stalke, helpeth to
preserue the Grape; Especially if the Stalke be put into the Pith of
Elder, the Elder not touching the Fruit.</p>
<p>It is reported by some of the Ancients, that Fruit put in Bottles,
and the Bottles let downe into Wells vnder Water, will keepe long.</p>
<p>Of Herbs and Plants, some are good to eat Raw; As Lettuce, Endiue,
Purslane, Tarragon, Cresses, Cucumbers, Muske-Melons, Radish,
andandandandc. Others onely after they are Boyled, or haue Passed the
Fire; As Parsley, Clary, Sage, Parsnips, Turnips, Asparagus,
Artichoakes, (though they also being young are eaten Raw:) But a Number
of Herbs are not Esculent at all; As Worme-wood, Grasse, Greeke-Corne,
Centory, Hyssope, Lauender, Balme, andandandandc. The Causes are, for
that the Herbs, that are not Esculent, do want the two Tastes, in which
Nourishment resteth; Which are, Fat, and Sweet; And haue (contrariwise)
Bitter and Ouer-strong Tastes, or a Iuyce so Crude, as cannot be ripened
to the degree of Nourishment. Herbes and Plants, that are Esculent Raw,
haue Fatnesse, or Sweetnesse, (as all Esculent Fruits;) Such are Onions,
Lettuce, andandandandc. But then it must be such a Fatnesse, (for as for
Sweet Things, they are in effect alwayes Esculent,) as is not
Ouer-grosse, and Loading of the Stomach; For Parsnips and Leeks haue
Fatnesse; But it is too Grosse and Heauy without Boyling. It must be
also in a Substance somewhat Tender; For we see Wheat, Barley,
Artichoakes, are no good Nourishment, till they haue Passed the Fire;
But the Fire doth ripen, and maketh them soft and tender, and so they
become Esculent. As for Radish, and Tarragon, and the like, they are for
Condiments, and not for Nourishment. And euen some of those Herbes,
which are not Esculent, are notwithstanding Poculent; As Hop’s, Broome,
andandandandc. Quare what Herbs are good for Drinke, besides the two
aforenamed; For that it may (perhaps) ease the Charge of Brewing, if
they make Beere to require lesse Malt, or make it last longer.</p>
<p>Parts fit for the Nourishment of Man, in Plants, are, Seeds, Roots,
and Fruits; But chiefly Seeds, and Roots. For Leaues, they giue no
Nourishment, at all, or very little: No more doe Flowers, or Blossomes,
or Stalkes. The Reason is, for that Roots, and Seeds, and Fruits, (in as
much as all Plants consist of an Oyly and Watry Substance commixed,)
haue more of the Oyly Substance; And Leaues, Flowers, andandandandc. of
the Watry. And secondly, they are more Concocted; For the Root, which
continueth euer in the Earth, is still Concocted by the Earth. And
Fruits, and Graines, (we see) are halfe a yeare, or more, in Concocting;
Whereas Leaues are out, and Perfect in a Moneth.</p>
<p>Plants (for the most part) are more strong, both in Taste, and Smell,
in the Seed, than in the Leafe, and Root. The Cause is, for that in
Plants, that are not of a Fierce and Eager Spirit, the Vertue is
increased by Concoction, and Maturation, which is euer most in the Seed;
But in Plants, that are of a Fierce and Eager Spirit, they are stronger
whilest the Spirit is enclosed in the Root; And the Spirits doe but
weaken, and dissipate, when they come to the Aire, and Sunne; As we see
it in Onions, Garlicke, Dragon, andandandandc. Nay there be Plants, that
haue their Roots very Hot, and Aromaticall; And their Seeds rather
Insipide; As Ginger. The Cause is (as was touched before,) for that the
Heat of those Plants is very Dissipable; which vnder the Earth is
contained and held in; But when it commeth to the Aire, it exhaleth.</p>
<p>The Iuyces of Fruits are either Watry, or Oyly. I reckon amongst the
Watry, all the Fruits out of which Drinke is expressed; As the Grape,
the Apple, the Peare, the Cherry, the Pomgranate, andandandandc. And
there are some others, which, though they be not in vse for Drinke, yet
they appeare to be of the same Nature; As Plummes, Serukes, Mulberries,
Rasps, Orenges, Limons, andandandandc. And for those Iuyces, that are so
fleshy, as they cannot make Drinke by Expression, yet (perhaps) they may
make Drinke by Mixture of Water;</p>
<p>Pocula{que} admistis imitantur vitea Sorbis.</p>
<p>And it may be Heps and Brier-Berries would doe the like. Those that
haue Oyly Iuyce, are; Oliues, Almonds, Nuts of all sorts, Pine-Apples,
andandandandc. And their Iuyces are all Inflammable. And you must
obserue also, that some of the Watry Iuyces, after they haue gathered
Spirit, will Burne and Enflame; As Wine. There is a Third Kinde of
Fruit, that is sweet, without either Sharpnesse, or Oylinesse: Such as
is the Fig, and the Date.</p>
<p>It hath beene noted, that most Trees, and specially those that beare
Mast, are fruitfull but once in two yeares. The Cause (no doubt) is, the
Expence of Sap; For many Orchard-Trees, well Cultured, will beare diuers
yeares together.</p>
<p>There is no Tree, which besides the Naturall Fruit, doth beare so
many Bastard-Fruits, as the Oake doth: For besides the Acorne, it
beareth Galls, Oake-Apples, and certaine Oake-Nuts, which are
Inflammable; And certaine Oake-Berries, sticking close to the Body of
the Tree, without Stalke. It beareth also Misseltoe, though rarely. The
Cause of all these may be, the Closenesse and Solidenesse of the Wood,
and Pith of the Oake; Which maketh seuerall Iuyces finde seuerall
Eruptions. And therefore, if you will deuise to make any Super-Plants,
you must euer giue the Sap Plentifull Rising, and Hard Issue.</p>
<p>There are two Excrescences, which grow vpon Trees; Both of them in
the Nature of Mushromes: The one the Romans called Boletus; Which
groweth vpon the Roots of Oakes; And was one of the Dainties of their
Table; The other is Medicinall, that is called Agaricke, (whereof we
haue spoken before,) which groweth vpon the Tops of Oakes; Though it be
affirmed by some, that it groweth also at the Roots. I doe conceiue,
that many Exerescences of Trees grow chiefly, where the Tree is dead, or
faded; For that the Naturall Sap of the Tree, corrupteth into some
Preternaturall Substance.</p>
<p>The greater Part of Trees beare Most, and Best, on the Lower Boughs;
As Oakes, Figs, Wall-Nuts, Peares, andandandandc. But some beare Best on
the TopBoughes; As Crabs, andandandandc. Those that beare best below,
are such, as Shade doth more good to, than Hurt. For generally all
Fruits beare best lowest; Because the Sap tireth not, hauing but a short
Way: And therefore in Fruits spred vpon Walls, the Lowest are the
Greatest, as was formerly said; So it is the Shade that hindereth the
Lower Boughes; Except it be in such Trees, as delight in Shade; Or at
least beare it well. And therfore, they are either Strong Trees, as the
Oake; Or else they haue large Leaues, as the Wallnut and Fig; Or else
they grow in Pyra-is, as the Peare. But if they require very much Sunne,
they beare best on the Top; As it is in Crabs, Apples, Plummes,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>There be Trees, that beare best, when they begin to be Old; As
Almonds, Peares, Vines, and all Trees that giue Mast. The Cause is, for
that all Trees that beare Mast, haue an Oyly Fruit; And Young Trees haue
a more Watry Iuyce, and lesse Concocted; And of the same kinde also is
the Almond. The Peare likewise, though it be not Oyly, yet it requireth
much Sap, and well Concocted; For we see it is a Heauy Fruit, and
Solide; Much more than Apples, Plummes, andandandandc. As for the Vine,
it is noted, that it beareth more Grapes when it is Young; But Grapes
that make better Wine, when it is Old; For that the Iuyce is better
Concocted: And wee see that Wine is Insflammable; So as it hath a kinde
of Oylinesse. But the most Part of Trees, amongst wich are Apples,
Plummes, andandandandc. beare best when they are Young.</p>
<p>There be Plants, that haue a Milke in them, when they are Cut; As
Figs, Old Lettuce, Sowe-Thistles, Spurge, andandandandc. The Cause may
be an Inception of Putrefaction: For those Milkes haue all an Acrimony;
though one would thinke they should be Lenitiue. For if you write vpon
Paper, with the Milke of the Fig, the Letters will not be seene, vntill
you hold the Paper before the Fire, and then they wax Browne; Which
sheweth that it is a Sharpe or Fretting Iuyce: Lettuce is thought
Poysonous, when it is so Old, as to haue Milke; Spurge is a kinde of
Poyson in it Selfe; And as for Sowe-Thistles, though Coneyes eat them,
yet Sheepe and Cattell will not touch them; And besides the Milke of
them, rubbed vpon Warts, in short time, weareth them away: Which sheweth
the Milke of them to be Corrosine. We see also, that Wheat, and other
Corne sowen, if you take them forth of the Ground, before they sprout,
are full of Milke; And the Beginning of Germination is euer a Kinde of
Putrefaction of the Seed. Euphorbium also hath a Milke, though not very
white, which is of a great Acrimony. And Saladine hath a yellow Milke,
which hath likewise much Acrimony; For it cleanseth the Eyes. It is good
also for Cataracts.</p>
<p>Mushromes are reported to grow, as well vpon the Bodies of Trees, as
vpon their Roots, or vpon the Earth: And especially vpon the Oake. The
Cause is, for that Strong Trees, are towards such Excresc — ces, in the
Nature of Earth; And therfore put forth Mosse, Mushromes, and the
like.</p>
<p>There is hardly found a Plant, that yeeldeth a Red Iuyce, in the
Blade, or Eare; Except it be the Tree that beareth Sanguis Draconis:
Which groweth (chiefly) in the Island Soquotra: The Herb Amaranthus,
(indeed,) is Red all ouer; And Brasill is Red in the Wood: And so is Red
Sunders. That Tree of the Sanguis Draconis, groweth in the forme of a
Sugar-loafe. It is like, that the Sap of that Plant, concocteth in the
Body of the Tree. For woe see that Grapes, and Pomegranats, are Red in
the Iuyce, but are Greene in the Teare: And this maketh the Tree of
Sanguis Draconis, lesser towards the Top; Because the Iuyce hasteneth
not vp; And besides it is very Astringent; And therefore of Slow
Motion.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Sweet Mosse, besides that vpon the Apple-Trees,
groweth likewise (sometimes) vpon Poplars; And yet (generally) the
Poplar is a Smooth Tree of Barke, and hath little Mosse. The Mosse of
the Larix Tree burneth also Sweet, and sparkleth in the Burning, Quaere
of the Mosses of Oderate Trees; As Cedar, Cypres, Lignum Aloës,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Death that is most without Paine, hath been noted to be, vpon the
Taking of the Petium of Hemloche; which in Humanity was the Forme of
Execution of Capitall Offenders in Athens. The Poyson of the Aspe, that
Cleopatra vsed, hath some affinity with it. The Cause is, for that the
Torments of Death are chiefly raised by the Strife of the Spirits; And
these Vapours quench the Spirits by Degrees; Like to the Death of an
extreme Old Man. I conceiue it is lesse Painfull than Opium:, because
Opium hath Parts of Heat mixed.</p>
<p>There be Fruits, that are Sweet before they be Ripe; As Mirabolanes;
So Reuuell-Seeds are Sweet before they ripen, and after grow Spicy. And
some neuer Ripen to be Sweet; As Tamarinds, Berberries, Crabs, Sloes,
andandandandc. The Cause is, for that the former Kinde haue — eh and
subtill Heat, which causeth Earely Sweetnesse; The latter haue a Cold
and Acide Iuyce, which no Heat of the Sunne can sweeten. But as for the
Mirabelane, it hath Parts of Contrary Natures; For it is Sweet, and yet
Astringont.</p>
<p>There bee few Herbes that haue a Salt Taste; And contrariwise all
Bloud of Liuing Creatures hath a Saltnesse: The Cause may be, for that
Salt, though it be the Audiment of Life, yet in Plants the Originall
Taste remaineth not; For you shall haue them Bitter, Sowre, Sweet,
Biting, but seldome Salt: But in Liuing Creatures, all those High Tastes
may happen to be (sometimes) in the Humours, but are seldome in the
Flesh, or Substance; Because it is of a more Oyly Nature; which is not
very Susceptible of those Tastes; And the Saltnesse it selfe of Bloud,
is but a light, and secret Saltnesse: And euen among Plants, some doe
participate of Saltnesse, as Alga Marina, Sampire, Scorny-Grasse,
andandandandc. And they report, there is, in some of the Indian-Seas, a
Swimming Plant, which they call Salgazus, spreading ouer the Sea, in
such sort, as one would thinke it were a Meadow. It is certaine, that
out of the Ashes of all Plants, they extract a Salt, which they vse in
Medicines.</p>
<p>It is reported by one of the Ancients, that there is an Herb growing
in the Water, called Lincostis, which is full of Prickles: This Herbe
putteth forth another small Herbe out of the Leafe; which is imputed to
some Moisture, that is gathered betweene the Prickles, which Putrified
by the Sunne, Germinateth. But I remember also I haue seene, for a great
Rarity, one Rose grow out of another, like Honey-Suckles, that they call
Top and Top-gallants.</p>
<p>Barley, (as appeareth in the Malting,) being steeped in Water three
dayes, and afterwards the Water drained from it, and the Barley turned
vpon a dry floare, will sprout, halfe an Inch long at least: And if it
be let alone, and not turned, much more; vntill the Heart be out. Wheat
will doe the same. Try it also with Pease, and Beanes. This Experiment
is not like that of the Orpin, and Semper-Vine; For there it is of the
old Store, for no Water is added; But here it is nourished from the
Water. The Experiment would be further driuen: For it appeareth already,
by that which hath beene said, that Earth is not necessary to the first
Sprouting of Plants; And we see that Rose-Buds set in Water, will Blow:
Therefore try whether the Sprouts of such Graines may not be raised to a
further Degree; As to an Herbe, or Flower, with Water onely; Or some
small Commixture, of Earth: For if they will, it should seeme by the
Experiments before, both of the Malt, and of the Roses, that they will
come far faster on in Water, than in Earth: For the Nourishment is
easilier drawne out of Water, than out of Earth. It may giue some light
also, that Drinke infused with Flesh, as that with the Capon,
andandandandc. will nourish faster and easilier, than Meat and Drinke
together. Try the same Experiment with Roots, as well as with Graines:
as for Example, take a Turnip, and steepe it a while, and then dry it,
and see whether it will sprout.</p>
<p>Malt in the Dren-bing will swell; And in such a manner, as after the
Putting forth in Sprouts, and the drying vpon the Keele, there will be
gained at least a Bushell in eight, and yet the Sprouts are rubbed off;
And there will be a Bushell of Dust besides the Malt: Which I suppose to
be, not onely by the loose, and open Laying of the Parts, but by some
Addition of Substance, drawne from the Water, in which it was
steeped.</p>
<p>Malt gathereth a Sweetnesse to the Taste, which appeareth yet more in
the Wort. The Dulcoration of Things is worthy to be tried to the full;
For that Dulcoration importeth a degree to Nourishment: And the Making
of Things Inalimentall, to become Alimentall, may be an Experiment of
great Profit, for Making new Victuall.</p>
<p>Most Seeds in the Growing, leaue their Huske or Rinde about the Root;
But the Onion will carry it vp, that it will be like a Cap vpon the Top
of the Young Onion. The Cause may be, for that the Skin or Huske is not
easie to breake; As we see by the Pilling of Onions, what a Holding
Substance the Skin is.</p>
<p>Plants, that haue Curled Leaues, doe all abound with Moisture; Which
commeth so fast on, as they cannot spread themselues Plaine, but must
needs gather together. The Weakest Kinde of Curling is Roughnesse; As in
Clary, and Burre. The Second is Curling on the Sides; As in Lettuce, and
Young Cabbage: And the Third is Folding into an Head; As in Cabbage full
growne, and Cabbage-Lettuce.</p>
<p>It is reported, that Firre, and Pine, especially if they be Old and
Putrified, though they shine not, as some Rotten Woods doe, yet in the
sudden Breaking they will sparkle like Hard Sugar.</p>
<p>The Roots of Trees doe, (some of them,) put downwards deepe into the
Ground; As the Oake, Pine, Firre, andandandandc. Some spread more
towards the Surface of the Earth; As the Ash, Cypresse-Tree, Oline,
andandandandc. The Cause of this latter may be, for that such Trees as
loue the Sunne, doe not willingly descend farre into the Earth; And
therefore they are (commonly) Trees, that shoot vp much; For in their
Body, their desire of Approach to the Sunne, maketh them spread the
lesse. And the same Reason, vnder Ground, to auoid Recesse from the
Sunne, maketh them spread the more. And wee see it commeth to passe in
some Trees, which haue beene planted too deepe in the Ground, that
forloue of Approach to the Sunne, they forsake their first Root, and put
out another more towards the Top of the Earth. And wee see also, that
the Oliue is full of Oylie Iuyce; And Ash maketh the best Fire; And
Cypresse is an Hot Tree. As for the Oake; which is of the former sort,
it loueth the Earth, And therefore groweth slowly. And for the Pine, and
Firre likewise, they haue so much Heat in themselues, as they need lesse
the Heat of the Sunne. There be Herbs also, that haue the same
difference; As the Herbe they call Morsus Diaboli; Which putteth the
Root downe so low, as you cannot pull it vp without Breaking; Which gaue
Occasion to the N-me, and — ; For that it was said, it was so wholesome
a Root, that the Deuill, when it was gathered, bit — for Enny. And some
of the Ancients doe report, that there was a Goodly Firre; (which they
desired to remoue whole,) that had a Root vnder Ground eight Cubits
deepe; And so the Root came vp broken.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, tha- a Branch of a Tree, being Vnberked some
space at the Botome, and so set into the Ground, hath growen; Euen of
such Trees, as if the Branch were set with the Barke on, they would not
grow; yet co — driwise we see, that a Tree-ared round in the Body, aboue
Ground, will die. The Cause may be, for that the Vnbarke Part draweth
the Nourishment best, but the Barke continueth it only.</p>
<p>Grapes will continue Fresh, and Moist, all Winter long, if you hang
them, Cluster by Cluster, in the Roofe of a Warme Roome; Especially, it
when you gather the Cluster, you take off with the Cluster some of the
Stocke.</p>
<p>The Reed or Cane is a Watry Plant, and groweth not but in the Water;
It hath these Properties; That it is Hollow; That it is Knuckled both
Stalke, and Root; That being Drie, it is more Hard and Fragile, than
other Wood; That it putteth forth no Boughs. though many Stalkes come
out of one Root. It differeth much in Greatnesse; The smallest being fit
for Thatching of Houses; And Stopping the Chinkes of Ships; Better than
Glew, or Pitch. The Second Bignesse, is vsed for Angle-Rods, and Staues;
And in China for beating of Offenders vpon the Thighs. The differing
Kindes of them are; The Common Reed; The Cassia Fistula; And the
Sugar-Reed. Of all Blants, it boweth the easiest, and riseth againe. It
seemeth, that amongst Plants, which are nourished with Mixture of Earth
and Water, it draweth most Nourishment from Water; which maketh it the
Smoothest of all others in Barke; And the Hollowest in Body.</p>
<p>The Sap of Trees, when they are let Bloud, is of differing Natures.
Some more Watry and Cleare; As that of Vines; of Beeches; of Peares.
Some Thicke; As Apples. Some Gummis; As Cherries. Some Frathie, As
Elmes. Some Milkie; As — In Mulberries, the Sap seemeth to be (almost)
towards the Barke only; For if you cut the Tree, a little into the
Barke, with a Stone, it will come forth; If you pierce it deeper with a
Toole, it will be drie. The Trees, which haue the Moistest Iuyces in
their Fruit. haue commonly the Moistest Sap in their Body; For the Vines
and Peares are very Moist; Apples somes hat more Spongie: The Milke of
the Figge hath the Qualitie of the R — nea-, to gather Cheese; And so
haue certaine Sonre Herbs wherewith they make Cheese in Lent.</p>
<p>The Timber and Wood are, in some Trees, more Cleane, in some more Kn
— tie: And it is a good Triall. to trie it by Speaking at one End, and
Laying the -are at the Other: For if it he Kn — tie, the Voice will not
passe well. Some haue the Veines more varied, and chamlotted; As Oake,
whereof Wainscat it made; Maple, whereof Trenchers are made. Some more
smooth, as Firre, and Walnnt: Some doe more easily breed Wormes and
Spiders; Some more hardly, as it is said of Irish Trees: Besides, there
be a Number of Differences that concerne their Vse; As Oake, Cedar, and
Chesu-t, are the best Builders: Some are best for Ploughs Timber; As
Ash; Some for Peeres, that are sometimes wet, and sometimes drie; As
Elme: Some for Planchers; As Deale: Some for Tables, Cupboard, and
Desks; As Wannts: Some for Ship Timber; As Oakes that grow in Moist
Grounds; For that maketh the Timber Tough, and not apt to rift with
Q-d-an — Where in English and Irish Timber are thought — excell; Some
for Mosts of Ships; As Firre, and Pine, because of their Length,
Straightnesse, and Lightnesse: Some for Pale; As Oake: Some for Fuell;
As Ash: And so of the rest.</p>
<p>The Comming of Trees and Plants in certaine Regions, and net in
others, is sometimes Casuall: For many haue beene translated, and haue
prospered well; As Damaske-Roses, that haue not beene knowne in England
aboue an hundred yeares, and now are so common. But the liking of Plants
in certaine Soiles, more than in others, is meerly Naturall; As the
Firre and Pine loue the Mountaines; The Poplar; Willow, Sallow, and
Alder, loue Riuers, and Moist Places: The Ash loueth Coppices; But is
best in Standards alone: luniper loueth Chalke; And so doe most
FruitTrees: Sampire groweth but upon Rocks: Reeds and Ofiers grow where
they are washed with Water: The Vine loueth Sides of Hills, turning vpon
the South-East Sun, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Putting forth of certaine Herbs discouereth of what Nature the
Ground where they put forth, is: As Wilde Thyme sheweth good Feeding
Ground for Cattell, Betony and Strawberries shew Grounds fit for Wood:
Ca — mill sheweth Mellow Grounds fit for Wheat. Mustard Seede, growing
after the Plough, sheweth a good Strong Ground also for Wheat: Burnet
sheweth good Meadow: And the like.</p>
<p>There are found, in diuers Countries, some other Plants, that grow
out of Trees and Plants, besides Misseltes: As in Syria, there is an
Herbe called Cassytas that groweth out of tall Trees, and windeth it
selfe about the same Tree where it groweth; And sometimes about Thornes.
There is a kinde of Polypode, that groweth out of Trees, though it
windeth not. So likewise an Herbe called Fannes, vpon the Wilde Oline.
And an Herbe called Hippopha —— vpon the Fullers Thorne; Which, they
say, is good for the Falling Sicknesse.</p>
<p>It hath beene ob-rerue-, by -ome or the Ancients, that howsoeuer Cold
and Easterly Winds, are thought to be great Enemies to Fruit; yet
neuerthelesse South Winds are also found to doe Hure; Especially in the
Blossoming time; And the more, if Showers follow. It seemeth, they call
forth the Moisture too fast. The West Winds are the best. It hath beene
obserued also that Greene and Open Winters doe hurt Trees; Insomuch as
if two or three such Winters come together, Almond-Trees, and some other
Trees, will dye. The Cause is the same with the former, because the Lust
of the Earth ouerspendeth it selfe; Howsoeuer some other of the Ancients
haue commended Warme Winters.</p>
<p>Snowes, lying long, cause a Fruitfull Yeare: For first, they keepe in
the Strength of the Earth; Secondly, they water the Earth, better than
Raine; For in Snow, the Earth doth (as it were) sucke the Water, as out
of the Teate. Thirdly, the Moisture of Snow is the finest Moisture; For
it is the Froth of the Cloudy Waters.</p>
<p>Showers, if they come a little before the Ripening of Fruits, doe
good to all Shoculent and Moist Fruits; As Vines, Oliues, Pomegranates;
Yet it is rather for Plenty, than for Goodnesse; For the best Wines are
in the Driest Vintages: Small Showers are likewise good for Corne, so as
Parching Heats come not vpon them. Generally, Night-Showers are better
than Day-Showers; For that the Sunne followeth not so fast vpon them.
And we see, euen in Watring by the Hand, it is best, in Summer time, to
water in the Euening.</p>
<p>The Differences of Earths, and the Triall of them, are worthy to be
diligently inquired. The Earth, that with Showers doth easiliest Soften,
is commended; And yet some Earth of that kinde will be very Dry, and
Hard before the Showers. The Earth that casteth vp from the Plough, a
Great Clod, is not so good, as that, which casteth vp a Smaller Clod.
The Earth, that putteth forth Mosse easily, and may bee called Mouldy,
is not good. The Earth, that smelleth well vpon the Digging, or
Ploughing, is commended; As containing the Iuyce of Vegetables almost
already prepared. It is thought by some, that the Ends of low
Raine-Bowes, fall more vpon one kinde of Earth than vpon another: As it
may well be; For that that Earth is most Roscide: And therfore it is
commended for a Signe of good Earth. The Poorenesse of the Herbs, (it is
plaine,) shew the Poorenesse of the Earth; And especially if they be in
Colour more darke: But if the Herbs shew Withered, or Blasted at the
Top, it sheweth the Earth to be very Cold: And so doth the Mossinesse of
Trees. The Earth, whereof the Grasse is soone Parched with the Sun, and
Toasted, is commonly Forced Earth, and Barren in his owne Nature. The
Tender, Chessoine, and Mellow Earth, is the best; Being meere Mould,
betweene the two Extreames of Clay, and Sand; Especially if it be not
Loamy, and Binding. The Earth, that after Raine, will scarce be
Ploughed, is commonly Fruitfull; For it is Cleaning, and full of
Iuyce.</p>
<p>It is strange, which is obserued by some of the Ancients, that Dust
helpeth the Fruitfulnesse of Trees; And of Vines, by name: Insomuch as
they catt Dust vpon them of purpose. It should seeme, that that
Powdring, when a Shower commeth, maketh a kinde of Soyling to the Tree,
being Earth and Water, finely laid on. And they note, that Countries,
where the Fields and Wayes are Dusty, beare the best Vines.</p>
<p>It is commended by the Ancients, for an Excellent Helpe to Trees, to
lay the Stalks and Leaues of Lupines about the Roots; Or to Plough them
into the Ground, where you will sowe Corne. The Burning also of the
Cuttings of Vines, and Casting them vpon land, doth much Good. And it
was generally receiued of old, that the Dunging of Grounds, when the
West Wind bloweth, and in the Decrease of the Moone, doth greatly helpe;
The Earth (as it seemeth) being then more thirsty, and open, to receiue
the Dung.</p>
<p>The Grafting of Vines vpon Vines, (as I take it,) is not now in vse:
The Ancients had it, and that three wayes: The First was Insition, which
is the Ordinary Manner of Grafting: The Second was Terebration, through
the Middle of the Stocke, and Putting in the Cions there: And the Third
was Paring of two Vines, that grow together, to the Marrow, and Binding
them close.</p>
<p>The Diseases and ill Accidents of Corne, are worthy to be enquired;
And would be more worthy to be enquired, if it were in Mens Power to
helpe them; Whereas many of them are not to be remedied. The Mildew is
one of the Greatest; which (out of question) commeth by Closenesse of
Aire; And therefore in Hills, or large Champaigne Grounds, it seldome
commeth; Such as is with vs York’s Worad. This cannot be remedied,
otherwise than that in Countries of Small Enclosure, the Grounds be
turned into larger Fields: Which I haue knowne to doe good in some
Farmes. Another Disease is the Putting forth of Wilde Oats, whereinto
Corne oftentimes, (especially Barley,) doth degenerate. It happeneth
chiefly from the Weaknesse of the Graine that is sowen; For if it be
either too Old, or Mouldy, it will bring forth Wilde Oats. Another
Disease is the Saciety of the Ground; For if you sow one Ground still
with the same Corne, (I meane not the same Corne that grew vpon the same
Ground,) but the same Kinde of Graine; (As Wheat, Barley,
andandandandc.) it will prosper but poorely: Therefore besides the
Resting of the Ground, you must vary the Seed. Another ill Accident is,
from the Winds, which hurt at two times; At the Flowring, by Shaking off
the Flowers; And at the full Ripening, by Shaking out the Corne. Another
ill Accident is, Drouth, at the Spindling of the Corne; Which with vs is
rate; But in Hotter Countries, common: Insomuch as the Word, Calamitas,
was first deriued from Calamus, when the Corne could not get out of the
Stalke. Another ill Accident is, Ouer-wet at Sowing-Time; which with vs
breedeth much Dearth; Insomuch as the Corne neuer commeth vp; And (many
times) they are forced to resow Sommer-Corne, where they sowed
Winter-Corne. Another ill Accident is Bitter Frosts, continued, without
Snow; Especially in the Beginning of the Winter, after the Seed is new
Sowen. Another Disease is Wormes; which sometimes breed in the Root, and
happen vpon Hot Sunnes, and Showers, immediately after the Sowing; And
another Worme breedeth in the Eare it Selfe; Especially when Hot Sunnes
breake often out of Clouds. Another Disease is Weeds; And they are such,
as either Choake, and Ouershadow the Corne, and beare it downe; Or
starue the Corne, and deceiue it of Nourishment. Another Disease is,
Ouer-Rancknesse of the Corne; Which they vse to remedy, by Mowing it
after it is come vp; Or putting Sheepe into it. Another ill Accident is
Laying of Corne with great Raines, neare, or in Harnest. Another ill
Accident is, if the Seed happen to haue touched Oyle, or any Thing, that
is Fat; For those Substances haue an Antipathy with Nourishment of
Water.</p>
<p>The Remedies of the Diseases of Corne haue beene obserued as
followeth. The Steeping of the Graine, before Sowing, a little time in
Wine, is thought a Presernatiue: The Mingling of Seed-Corne with Ashes,
is thought to be good: The Sowing at the Wane of the Moone, is thought
to make the Corne sound: It hath not beene practised, but it is thought
to be of vse, to make some Miscellane in Corne; As if you sow a few
Beanes with Wheat, your Wheat will be the better. It hath beene
obserued, that the Sowing of Corne with Honsleeke, doth good. Though
Graine, that toucheth Oyle, or Fat, receiueth hurt, yet the Steeping of
it, in the Dregs of Oyle, when it beginneth to Putrifie, (which they
call Amurca,) is thought to assure it against Wormes. It is reported
also, that it Corne be Mowed, it will make the Graine Longer, but
Emptier, and hauing More of the Huske.</p>
<p>It hath beene noted, that Seed of a yeare old, is the Best; And of
two or three yeares is Worse, And that which is more Old, is quite
Barren; Though (no doubt) some Seeds and Graines last better than
others. The Corne, which in the Vanning lieth lowest, is the best; And
the Corne, which broken or bitten retaineth a little Yellownesse, is
better than that which is very White.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, that of all Roots of Herbs, the Root of
Sorrell goeth the furthest into the Earth; Insomuch as it hath bin
knowne to go three Cubits deepe; And that it is the Root that continueth
fit (longest) to be set againe, of any Root that groweth. It is a Cold
and Acide Herbe, that (as it seemeth) loueth the Earth, and is not much
drawne by the Sunne.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, that some Herbs like best, being watred with
Salt-Water; As Radish, Beet, Rew, Pennyroyall; This Triall would be
extended to some other Herbs; Especially such as are Strong; As
Tarragon, Mustard-Seed, Rocket, and the like.</p>
<p>It is strange that is generally receiued, how some Poysonous Beasts
affect Odorate and Wholesome Herbs; As that the Snake loueth Fennell;
That the Toad will be much vnder Sage; That Frogs will be in Cinque
foile. It may be, it is rather the Shade, or other Couerture, that they
take liking in, than the Vertue of the Herbe.</p>
<p>It were a Matter of great Profit, (saue that I doubt it is too
Coniecturall to venture vpon,) if one could discerne, what Corne, Herbs,
or Fruits, are like to be in Plenty, or Scarcity, by some Signes and
Prognosticks. in the Beginning of the Yeare: For as for those, that are
like to be in Plenty, they may be bargained for, vpon the Ground; As the
Old Relation was of Thales; who to shew how easie it was for a
Philosopher to be rich, when he fore-saw a great Plenty of Oliues, made
a Monopoly of them. And for Scarcity, Men may make Profit in keeping
better the Old Store. Long Continuance of Snow is beleeued to make a
Fruitfull Yeare of Corne: An Earely Winter, or a very Late Winter, a
Barren Yeare of Corne: An Open and Serene Winter, an ill Yeare of Fruit:
These we haue partly touched before: But other Prognostickes of like
Nature are diligently to be enquired.</p>
<p>There seeme to be, in some Plants, Singularities, wherein they differ
from all Other; The Oliue hath the Oyly Part, only on the Outside;
Wheras all other Fruits haue it in the Nut, or Kernell. The Firre hath
(in effect) no Stone, Nut, nor Kernest; Except you will count the little
Graines Kernells. The Pom granate and Pine Apple haue onely, amongst
Fruits, Graines distinct in seuerall Cells. No Herbs haue Curled Leaues,
but Cabbage, and Cabbage-Lettuce. None haue double Leaues, one belonging
to the Stalke, another to the Fruit or Seed, but the Artichoke: No
Flower hath that kinde of Spread that the Woodbine hath. This may be a
large Field of Contemplation; For it sheweth that in the Frame of
Nature, there is, in the Producing of some Species, a Composition of
Matter, which happeneth oft, and may be much diuersified: In others,
such as happeneth rarely, and admitteth little Variety: For so it is
likewise in Beasts: Dogs haue a Resemblance with Wolnes, and Foxes;
Horses with Asses, Kine with Bustes; Hares with Coneyes; andandandandc.
And so in Birds: Kites and Kastrells haue a Resemblance with Hawkes;
Common-Doues with Ring-Dea-s, and Tortles; Black-Birds with Thrushes,
and Manisses; Crowes with Bauens, Dawes, and Choughas, andandandandc.
But Elephants, and Swine amongst Beasts; And the Bird of Paradise, and
the Peacocke amongst Birds; And some few others; haue sea — any other
Species, that haue Affinity with them.</p>
<p>We leaue the Description of Plants, and their Vertues, to Herballs,
and other like Bookes of Naturall History: Wherein Mens Diligence hath b
—— great, euen to Curiosity: For our Experiments are onely such as doe
euer ascend a Degree, to the Deriuing of Causes, and Extracting of
Axiomes, which, wee are not ignorant, but that some, both of the
Ancient, and Modeme Writers, haue also labôured, But their Causes, and
Axiomes, are so full of Imagination, and so infected with the old
Receiued Theories, as they are meere Inquinations of Experience, and
Concoct it not.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by some of the Ancients, that Skins,
(especially of — ams, newly pulled off, and applied to the Wounds of
Stripts, doe keepe them from Swelling, and Exulcerating; And likewise
Heade them, and Close them vp; And that the Whites of Eggs do the same.
The Cause is a Temperate Conglutination; For both Bodies are Glommy, and
Viscous, and doe bridle the Des-uxe of Humours to the Hu — , without
Penning them in too much.</p>
<p>You may turne (almost) all Flesh into a —— —— , if you take Flesh,
and cut it into Peeces, and put the Peeces into a Glasse couered with
Parchment; And so let the Glasse stand six or seuen Houres — Boyling
Water. It may be an Experiment of Profit, for Making of Fat, or Grease,
for many vses; But then it must be of such Flesh as is not Edible; As
Horses, Dogs, Beares, Foxes, Bodgers, andandandandc.</p>
<p>It is reported by one of the Ancients, that New Wine, put into
Vessells well stopped, and the Vessells let downe into the Sea, will
accelerate very much, the Making of them Ripe, and Potable. The same
would be tried in Wort.</p>
<p>Beasts are more Hairy than Men; And Sauage Man more than Ciuill; And
the Plumage of Birds exceedeth the Pilosity of Beasts. The Cause of the
Smoothnesse in Men, is not any Abundance of Heat, and Moisture, though
that indeed causeth Pilosity; But there is requisite to Pilosity, not so
much Heat and Moisture, as Excrementitious Heat and Moisture: (For
whatsoeuer assimilateth, goeth not into the Haire:) And Excrementitious
Moisture aboundeth most in Beasts, and Men that are more Sauage. Much
the same Reason is there of the Plumage of Birds; For Birds assimilate
lesse, and excerne more than Beasts: For their Excrements are euer
liquid, and their Flesh (generally) more dry: Besides, they haue not
Instruments for Vrine; And so all the Excrementitious Moisture goeth
into the Feathers: And therefore it is no Maruell, though Birds bee
commonly better Meat than Beasts, because their Flesh doth assimilate
more finely, and secerneth more subtilly. Againe, the Head of Man hath
Haire vpon the first Birth, which no other Part of the Body hath. The
Cause may be Want of Perspiration: For Much of the Matter of Haire, in
the other Parts of the Body, goeth forth by Insensible Perspiration; And
besides, the Skull being of a more solide Substance, nourisheth and
assimilateth lesse, and excerneth more: And so likewise doth the Chinne;
We see also that Haire commeth not vpon the Palmes of the Hands, nor
Soales of the Feet; Which are Parts more Perspirable. And Children
likewise are not Hairy, for that their Skins are more Perspirable.</p>
<p>Birds are of Swifter Motion than Beasts: For the Flight of many Birds
is Swifter, than the Race of any Beasts. The Cause is, for that the
Spirits in Birds, are in greater Proportion, in comparison of the Bulke
of their Body, than in Beasts: For as for the Reason that some giue,
that they are partly Carried, whereas Beasts goe, that is Nothing; For
by that Reason Swimming should be swifter, than Running: And that Kinde
of Carriage also, is not without Labour of the Wing.</p>
<p>The Sea is Clearer, when the North wind bloweth, than when the
South-wind. The Cause is, for that Salt-Water hath a little Oylinesse in
the Surface thereof; As appeareth in very Hot Daies: And againe, for
that the Southerne Wind relaxeth the Water somewhat; As no Water Boyling
is so Cleare as Cold Water.</p>
<p>Fire burneth Wood, making it first Luminous; Then Blacke and Brittle:
And lastly, Broken and Incinerate: Sealding Water doth none of these.
The Cause is, for that by Fire, the Spirit of the Body is first Refined,
and then Emitted; Whereof the Refining, be Attenuation causeth the
Light; And the Emission, first the Fragilitie, and after the Dissolution
into Ashes: Neither doth any other Body enter: But in Water the Spirit
of the Body is not Refined so much; And besides Part of the Water
entreth; Which doth increase the Spirit, and in a degree extinguish it:
Therefore wee see that Hot Water will quench Fire. And againe wee see,
that in Bodies, wherein the Water doth not much enter, but only the Heat
passeth, Hot Water worketh the Effects of Fire: As in Egges Boyled, and
Roasted, (into which the Water entreth not at all,) there is scarce
difference to be discerned; But in Fruit, and Flesh, whereinto the Water
entreth, in some part, there is much more difference.</p>
<p>The Bottome of a Vessell of Boyling Water, (as hath beene obserued,)
is not very much Heated; So as Men may put their Hand vnder the Vessell,
and remoue it. The Cause is, for that the Moisture of Water, as it
quencheth Coales, where it entreth; So it doth allay Heat, where it
toucheth: And therefore note well, that Moisture, although it doth not
passe thorow Bodies, without Communication of some Substance, (As Heat
and Cold doe;) yet it worketh manifest Effects; not by Entrance of the
Body, but by Qualifying of the Heat, and Cold; As wee see in this
Instance: And wee see likewise, that the Water of Things distilled in
Water, (which they call the Bath,) differeth not much from the Water of
Things Distilled by Fire: Wee see also, that Pewter-Dishes, with Water
in them, will not Melt easily; But without it, they will: Nay wee see
more, that Butter, or Oyle, which in themselues are Inflammable, yet by
Vertue of their Moisture, will doe the like.</p>
<p>It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that it is dangerous to Picke
ones Eare, whilest he Yawneth. The Cause is, for that in Yawning, the
Inner Parchment of the Eare is extended, by the Drawing in of the
Spirit, and Breath; For in Yawning, and Sighing both, the Spirit is
first strongly Drawne in, and then strongly Expelled.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Sneezing doth cease the
Hiccough. The Cause is, for that the Motion of the Hiccough, is a
Lifting vp of the Stomacke: which Sneezing doth somewhat depresse, and
diuert the Motion another way. For first wee see, that the Hiccough
commeth of Fulnesse of Meat, (especially in Children, which causeth an
Extension of the Stomacke: Wee see also, it is caused by Acide Meats, or
Drinkes, which is by the Pricking of the Stomacke: And this Motion is
ceased, either by Diuersion; Or by Detention of the Spirits: Diuersion,
as in Sneezing; Detention, as wee see Holding of the Breath, doth helpe
somewhat to cease the Hiccough: And putting a Man into an Earnest Studie
doth the like; As is commonly vsed: And Vinegar put to the Nostbrills,
or Gargarized, doth it also; For that it is Astringent, and inhibiteth
the Motion of the Spirits.</p>
<p>Looking against the Sunne, doth induce Sneezing. The Cause; is not
the Heating of the Nosthrills; For then the Holding vp of the Nosthrills
against the Sunne, though one Winke, would doe it, But the Drawing downe
of the Moisture of the Braine: For it will make the Eyes, run with
Water; And the Drawing of Moisture to the Eyes, doth draw it to the
Nosthrills, by Motion of Consent; And so followeth Sneezing; As
contrariwise, the Tickling of the Nosthrills within, doth draw the
Moisture to the Nosthrills, and to the Eyes by Consent; For they also
will Water. But yet, it hath beene obserued, that if one be about to
Sneeze, the Rubbing of the Eyes, till they run with Water, will preuent
it. Where of the Cause is, for that the Humour, which was descending to
the Nosthrills, is diuerted to the Eyes.</p>
<p>The Teeth are more, by Cold Drinke, or the like, affected, than the
other Parts. The Cause is double: The One, for that the Resistance of
Bone to Cold, is greater than of Flesh; for that Flesh shrinketh, but
the Bone resisteth, whereby the Cold becommeth more eager: The Other is,
for that the Teeth are Parts without Bloud; Whereas Bloud helpeth to
qualifie the Cold: And therefore wee see, that the Sinnewes are much
affected with Cold; For that they are Parts without Bloud: So the Bones
in Sharpe Colds wax Brittle; And therefore, it hath beene seene, that
all Contusions of Bones, in Hard Weather, are more difficult to
Cure.</p>
<p>It hath been noted, that the Tongue receiueth, more easily, Tokens of
Diseases, than the other Parts; As of Heats within, which appeare most
in the Blacknesse of the Tongue. Againe, Pied Cattell are spotted in
their Tongues, andandandandc. The Cause is, (no doubt,) the Tendernesse
of the Part; which thereby receiueth more easily all Alterations, than
any other Parts of the Flesh.</p>
<p>When the Mouth is out of Taste, it maketh Things taste, sometimes
Salt; Chiefly Bitter; And sometimes Loathsome; But neuer Sweet. The
Cause is, the Corrupting of the Moisture about the Tongue; Which many
times turneth Bitter, and Salt, and Loathsome; But Sweet neuer; For the
rest are Degrees of Corruption.</p>
<p>It was obserued in the Great Plague of the last Yeare, that there
were seene, in diuers Ditches, and low Grounds, about London, many
Toads, that had Tailes, two or three Inches long, at the least; Whereas
Toads (vsually) haue no Tailes at all. Which argueth a great Disposition
to Putrefaction in the Soile, and Aire. It is reported likewise, that
Roots, (such as Carrets, and Parsuips,) are more Sweet, and Lushious, in
Infectious Yeares, than in other Yeares.</p>
<p>Wife Physitians should with all diligence inquire, what Simples
Nature yeeldeth, that haue extreme Subtile Parts, without any
Mordication, or Acrimony: For they Vndermine that which is Hard; They
open that which is Stopped, and Shut; And they expell that which is
Offensive, gently, without too much Perturbation. Of this Kinde are
Elder-Flowers, which therefore are Proper for the Stone: Of this kinde
is the DwarfePine; which is Proper for the laundies: Of this kinde is
Harts-Horne; which is Proper for Agues, and Infections: Of this kinde is
Piony; which is Proper for Stoppings in the Head: Of this kinde is
Fumitory; which is Proper for the Spl — e: And a Number of Others.
Generally, diuers Creatures bred of Putrefaction, though they be
somewhat loathsome to take, are of this kinde; As Earth-wormes,
Timber-Sowes, Snailes, andandandandc. And I conceiue, that the
Trechischs of Vipers, (which are so much magnified,) and the Flesh of
Snakes some wayes condited, and corrected, (which of late are growne
into some Credite,) are of the same Nature. So the Parts of Beasts
Putrified; (as Castereum, and Muske, which haue extreme Subtill Parts,)
are to be placed amongst them. We see also that Patrefactions of Plants,
(as Agarichs, and lewes —— . are of greatest Vertue. The Cause is, for
that Putrefection is the Subtillest of all Motions, in the Parts of
Bodies: And since we cannot take downe the Lines of Liuing Creatures,
(which some of the — say (If they could be taken downe,) would make vs
Immortall;) the Next is for Subtilty of Operation, to take Bodies
Putresied; Such as may be safely taken.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Much vse of Venus doth
Dimme the Sight; And yet Eunuchs, which are vnable to generate, are
(neuerthelesse) also Dimme Sighted. The Cause of Dimnesse of Sight, in
the Former, is the Expence of Spirts; In the Latter, the Ouer-moisture
of the Braine: For the Ouer-moisture of the Braine doth thicken the
Spirits Visuall. and obstructeth their Passages; As we see by the Decay,
in the Sight, in Age; Where also the Diminution of the Spirits
concurreth as another Cause: we see also that Blindnesse commeth by
Rheumes, and — . Now in — . there are all the Notes of Moisture; As the
Swelling of their Thighes, the Loosenesse of their Belly, the
Smoothnesse of their Skinne, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The Pleasure in the Act of Venus is the greatest of the Pleasures of
the Senses: The Matching of it with Itch is vnproper; though that also
be Pleasing to the touch. But the Conses are Profound. First, all the
Organe of the Senses qualifie the Nations of the Spirits; And make so
many Seuerall Species of Motions, and Pleasures or Displeasures
thereupon, as there be Dinersitics of Organs. The Instruments of Sight,
Hearing, Taste, and Smell, are of seuerall frame; And so are the Parts
for Generation. Therefore Sealiger doth well, to make the Pleasure of
Generation a Sixth Sense; And if there were any other differing Organs,
and Qualified Perfraction for the spirits to passe; there would be more
than the Fiue Senses; Neither doe we well know, whether some Beasts, and
Birds, haue not Senses that we know not: And the very some of Dogs is
almost a sense it selfe. Secondly, the Pleasures of the Touch, are
greater and deeper, than those of the other Senses; As we see in Warming
vpon Cold; Or Refrigeration vpon Heat: For as the Paines of the Touch,
are greater than the Offences of other Sense; So likewise are the
Pleasures. It is true, that the Affecting of the Spirits immediately,
and (as it were) without an Organ, is of the greatest Pleasure; Which is
but in two things: Sweet Smells; And Wine, and the like Sweet Vapours.
For Smells, wee see their great and sudden Effect in fetching Men
againe, when they swoune: For Drinke, it is certaine, that the Pleasure
of Drunkennesse, is next the Pleasure of Venus: And Great Ioyes
(likewise) make the Spirits moue, and touch themselues: And the pleasure
of Venus is somewhat of the same Kinde.</p>
<p>It hath beene alwayes obserued, that Men are more inclined to Venus
in the Winter, and Women in the Summer. The Cause is, for that the
Spirits, in a Body more Hot and dry, (as the Spirits of Men are,) by the
Summer are more exhaled, and dissipated; And in the Winter more
condensed, and kept entire: But in Bodies that are Cold and Moist, (as
Womens are,) the Summer doth Cherish the Spirits, and calleth them
forth; the Winter doth dull them. Furthermore, the Abstinence or
Intermission of the Vse of Venus, in Moist and Well Habituate Bodies,
breedeth a Number of Diseases; And especially dangerous Impostumations.
The Reason is euident; For that it is a Principall Euacuation,
especially of the Spirits: For of the Spirits, there is scarce any
Euacuation, but in Venus, and Exercise. And therefore the Omission of
either of them, breedeth all Diseases of Repletion.</p>
<p>The Nature of Viuification is very worthy the Enquiry: And as the
Nature of Things, is commonly better perceiued, in Small, than in Great,
and in vnperfect, than in perfect, and in Parts, than in whole: So the
Nature of Viuification is best enquired in Creatures bred of
Putrefaction. The Contemplation whereof hath many Excellent Fruits.
First, in Disclosing the Originall of of Viuification. Secondly, in
Disclosing the Originall of Figuration. Thirdly, in Disclosing many
Things in the Nature of Perfect Creatures, which in them lye more
hidden. And Fourthly, in Traducing, by way of Operation, some
Obseruations in the Insecta, to worke Effects vpon Perfect Creatures.
Note that the word Insecta, agreeth not with the Matter, but we euer vse
it for Breuities sake, intending by it Creatures bred of
Putrefaction.</p>
<p>The Insecta are found to breed out of seuerall Matters: Some breed of
Mud, or Dung; As the Earth-wormes, Eeles, Snakes, andandandandc. For
they are both Putrefactions: For Water in Mud doth Puttifie, as not able
to Preserue it selfe: And for Dung, all Excrements are the Refuse and
Putrefactions of Nourishment. Some breed in Wood, both Growing, and Cut
down. Quare in what Woods most, and at what Seasons? We see that the
Worms with many Feet, which round themselues into Balls, are bred
chiefly vnder Logs of Timber, but not in the Timber; And they are said
to be found also, (many times,) in Gardens, where no Logs are. But it
seemeth their Generation requireth a Couerture, both from Sunne, and
Raine, or Dew; As the Timber is; And therfore they are not Venemous, but
(contrariwise) are held by the Physitians to clarifie the Bloud. It is
obserued also that Cimices are found in the Holes of Bed-Sides. Some
breed in the Haire of Liuing Creatures; As Lice, and Tikes; which are
bred by the Sweat close kept, and somewhat are fied by the Haire. The
Excrements of Liuing Creatures, do not only breed Insecta, when they are
Excerned, but also while they are in the Body; As in Wormes, whereto
Children are most subiect, and are chiefly in the Guts. And it hath
beene lately obserued by Physitians, that in many Pestilent Diseases,
there are Wormes found in the vpper Parts of the Body, where Excrements
are not, but onely Humours Putrified. Fleas breed Principally of Straw
or Mass, where there hath beene a little Moisture; Or the Chamber and
Bed-straw kept close, and not Aired. It is receiued that they are killed
by Strewing Worme-wood in the Rooms. And it is truly obserued, that
Bitter Things are apt, rather to kill, than engender Putrefaction; And
they be Things, that are Fat, or Sweet, that are aptest to Putrifie.
There is a Worme, that breedeth in Meale, of the shape of a large white
Magget, which is giuen as a great Dainty to Nightingales. The Moath
breedeth vpon Cloth, and other Lanifices; Especially if they be laid vp
dankish, and wet. It delighteth to be about the Flame of a Candle. There
is a Worme called a Wenill, brad vnder Ground, and that feedeth vpon
Roots; As Parsnips, Carrets, andandandandc. Some breed in Waters,
especially shaded, but they must be Standing-waters; As the
Water-Spider, that hath six Legs. The Fly called the Oad-fly, breedeth
of somewhat that Swimmeth vpon the Top of the Water, and is most about
Ponds. There is a Worme that breedeth of the Dregs of Wine Decayed;
which afterwards, (as is obserued by some of the Ancients,) turneth into
a Gnat. It hath bin obserued by the Ancients, that there is a Worme that
breedeth in old Snow, and is of Colour Reddish, and dull of Motion, and
dieth soone after it commeth out of Snow. Which should shew, that Snow
hath in it a secret Warmth; For else it could hardly Viuisie. And the
Reason of the Dying of the Worme, may be the sudden Exhaling of that
little Spirit, as soone as it commeth out of the Cold, which had shut it
in. For as Butterflies quicken with Heat, which were benummed with Cold;
So Spirits may exhale with Heat, which were Preserued in Cold. It is
affirmed both by Ancient and Moderne Obseruation, that in Furnaces of
Copper, and Brasse, where Chalcites, (which is Vitrioll,) is often cast
in, to mend the working, there riseth suddenly a Fly, which sometimes
moueth, as if it tooke hold on the walls of the Furnace; Sometimes is
seene mouing in the Fire below; And dieth presently, as soone as it is
out of the Furnace. Which is a Noble Instance, and worthy to be weighed;
for it sheweth that as well Violent Heat of Fire, as the Gentle Heat of
Liuing Creatures, will Viuifie, if it haue Matter Proportionable. Now
the great Axiome of Viuification is, that there must be Heat to dilate
the Spirit of the Body; An Actiue Spirit to be dilated; Matter Viscous
or Tenacious, to hold in the Spirit; And that Matter to be put forth,
and Figured. Now a Spirit dilated by so ardent a Fire, as that of the
Furnace, as soone as euer it cooleth neuer so little, congealeth
presently. And (no doubt) this Action is furthered by the Chalcites,
which hath a Spirit, that will Put forth and germinate, as we see in
Chymicall Trialls. Briefly, most Things Putrified bring forth Insecta of
seuerall Names; But wee will not take vpon vs now, to Enumerate them
all.</p>
<p>The Insecta haue beene noted by the Ancients, to feed little: But
this hath not beene diligently obserued; For Grashoppers eat vp the
Greene of whole Countries; And Silke-wormes deuoure Leaues swiftly; And
Ants make gret Prouision. It is true, that Creatures, that Sleepe and
rest much, Eat little; As Dormise, and Bats, andandandandc. They are all
without Bloud: Which may be, for that the Iuyce of their Bodies, is
almost all one; Not Bloud, and Flesh, and Skin, and Bone, as in Perfect
Creatures; The Integrall Parts haue Extreme Variety, but the Similar
Parts little. It is true, that they haue, (some of them,) a Disphragme,
and an Intestine; And they haue all Skins; Which in most of the Insecta
are cast often. They are not (generally) of long Life: Yet Bees haue
beene knowne to liue seuen yeares: And Snakes are thought, the rather
for the Casting of their Spoils, to liue till they be Old: And Eeles,
which many times breed of Putrefaction, will liue and grow very long:
And those that Enterchange from Wormes to Flyes in the Summer, and from
Flyes to Wormes in the Winter, haue beene kept in Boxes oure kyears at
the least. Yet there are certain Flyes, that are called Ephemera, that
liue but a day. The Cause is, the Exility of the Spirit; Or perhaps the
Absence of the Sunne; For that if they were brought in, or kept close,
they might liue longer. Many of the Insecta, (as Butterflies, and other
Flies,) reuiue easily, when they seeme dead, being brought to the Sunne,
or Fire, The Cause whereof is, the Diffusion of the Vitall Spirit, and
the Easie Dilating of it by a little Heat. They stirre a good while,
after their Heads are off, or that they be cut in Pecces; Which is
caused also, for that their Vitall Spirits are more diffused thorow-out
all their Parts, and lesse confined to Organs, than in Perfect
Creatures.</p>
<p>The Insecta haue Voluntary Motion, and therefore Imagination; And
whereas some of the Ancients haue said, that their Motion is
Indeterminate, and their Imagination Indefinite, it is negligently
obserued; For Arts goe right forwards to their Hills; And Bees doe
(admirably) know the way, from a Flowry Heath, two or three Miles off,
to their Hiues. It may be, Gnats, and Flyes, haue their Imagination more
mutable, and giddy, as Small Birds likewise haue. It is said by some of
the Ancients, that they haue onely the Sense of Feeling; which is
manifestly vntrue: For if they goe forthright to a Place, they must
needs haue Sight: Besides they delight more in one Flower, or Herbe,
than in another, and therefore haue Taste: And Bees are called with
Sound vpon Brasse, and therefore they haue Hearing: Which sheweth
likewise that though their Spirit be diffused, yet there is a Seat of
their Senses in their Head.</p>
<p>Other Obseruations concerning the Insecta, together with the
Enumeration of them, wee referre to that place, where wee meane to
handle the Title of Animal’s in generall.</p>
<p>A Man Leapeth better with Weights, in his Hands, than without. The
Cause is, for that the Weight, (if it be proportionable,) strengthneth
the Sinneues, by Contracting them. For otherwise, where no Contraction
is needfull, Weight hindereth. As wee see in Horse-Races, Men are
curious to fore-see, that there be not the least Weight, vpon the one
Horse, more than vpon the other. In Leaping with Weights, the Armes are
first cast backwards, and then forwards, with so much the greater Force:
For the Hands goe backward before they take their Raise. Quaere, if the
contrary Motion of the Spirits, immediately before the Motion wee
intend, doth not cause the Spirits, as it were, to breake forth with
more Force: As Breath also drawne, and kept in, commeth forth more
forcibly: And in Casting of any Thing, the Armes, to make a greater
Swing, are first cast backward.</p>
<p>Of Musicall Tones, and Vnequall Sounds, wee haue spoken before; But
touching the Pleasure, and Displeasure of the Senses, not so fully.Harsh
Sounds, as of a Sawe, when it is sharpened; Grinding of one Stone
against another; Squeaking, or Skriching Noise; make a Shiuering or
Horrour in the Body, and set the Teeth on edge. The Cause is, for that
the Obiects of the Eare, doe affect the Spirits (immediately) most with
Pleasure and Offence. We see, there is no Colour that affecteth the Eye
much with Displeasure: There be Sights, that are Horrible, because they
excite the Memory of Things that are Odious, or Fearefull; But the same
Things Painted doe little affect. As for Smells, Tastes, and Touches,
they be Things that doe affect, by a Participation, or Impulsion of the
Body, of the Obiect. So it is Sound alone, that doth immediately, and
incorporeally, affect most: This is most manifest in Musicke; and
Concords and Discords in Musicke: For all Sounds, whether they be
sharpe, or Flat, if they be Sweet, haue a Roundnesse and Equality; And
if they be Harsh, are Vnequall: For a Discord it selfe is but a
Harshnesse of Diners Sounds Meeting. It is true, that Inequality, not
Stayed vpon, but Passing, is rather an Encrease of Sweetnesse: As in the
Purling of a Wreathed String; And in the Rancity of a Trumpet; And in
the Nightinghale-Pipe of a Regall; And in a Discord straight falling
vpon a Concord: But if you stay vpon it, it is Offensiue; And therefore,
there bee these three Degrees of Pleasing, and Displeasing in Sounds;
Sweet Sounds; Discords and Harsh Sounds, which we call by diuers Names,
as Skriching, or Grating, such as wee now speake of. As for the Setting
of the Teeth on Edge, we see plainly, what an Intercourse there is,
betweene the Teeth, and the Organ of the Hearing, by the Taking of the
End of a Bow, betweene the Teeth, and Striking vpon the String.</p>
