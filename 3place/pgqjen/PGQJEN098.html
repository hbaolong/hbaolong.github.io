<ol type="1">
<li><p>The parts of human learning have reference to the three parts of
man’s understanding, which is the seat of learning: history to his
memory, poesy to his imagination, and philosophy to his reason. Divine
learning receiveth the same distribution; for, the spirit of man is the
same, though the revelation of oracle and sense be diverse. So as
theology consisteth also of history of the Church; of parables, which is
divine poesy; and of holy doctrine or precept. For as for that part
which seemeth supernumerary, which is prophecy, it is but divine
history, which hath that prerogative over human, as the narration may be
before the fact as well as after.</p></li>
<li><p>History is natural, civil, ecclesiastical, and literary; whereof
the first three I allow as extant, the fourth I note as deficient. For
no man hath propounded to himself the general state of learning to be
described and represented from age to age, as many have done the works
of Nature, and the state, civil and ecclesiastical; without which the
history of the world seemeth to me to be as the statue of Polyphemus
with his eye out, that part being wanting which doth most show the
spirit and life of the person. And yet I am not ignorant that in divers
particular sciences, as of the jurisconsults, the mathematicians, the
rhetoricians, the philosophers, there are set down some small memorials
of the schools, authors, and books; and so likewise some barren
relations touching the invention of arts or usages. But a just story of
learning, containing the antiquities and originals of knowledges and
their sects, their inventions, their traditions, their diverse
administrations and managings, their flourishings, their oppositions,
decays, depressions, oblivions, removes, with the causes and occasions
of them, and all other events concerning learning, throughout the ages
of the world, I may truly affirm to be wanting; the use and end of which
work I do not so much design for curiosity or satisfaction of those that
are the lovers of learning, but chiefly for a more serious and grave
purpose, which is this in few words, that it will make learned men wise
in the use and administration of learning. For it is not Saint
Augustine’s nor Saint Ambrose’s works that will make so wise a divine as
ecclesiastical history thoroughly read and observed, and the same reason
is of learning.</p></li>
<li><p>History of Nature is of three sorts; of Nature in course, of
Nature erring or varying, and of Nature altered or wrought; that is,
history of creatures, history of marvels, and history of arts. The first
of these no doubt is extant, and that in good perfection; the two latter
are bandied so weakly and unprofitably as I am moved to note them as
deficient. For I find no sufficient or competent collection of the works
of Nature which have a digression and deflexion from the ordinary course
of generations, productions, and motions; whether they be singularities
of place and region, or the strange events of time and chance, or the
effects of yet unknown properties, or the instances of exception to
general kinds. It is true I find a number of books of fabulous
experiments and secrets, and frivolous impostures for pleasure and
strangeness; but a substantial and severe collection of the heteroclites
or irregulars of Nature, well examined and described, I find not,
specially not with due rejection of fables and popular errors. For as
things now are, if an untruth in Nature be once on foot, what by reason
of the neglect of examination, and countenance of antiquity, and what by
reason of the use of the opinion in similitudes and ornaments of speech,
it is never called down.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of this work, honoured with a precedent in Aristotle, is
nothing less than to give contentment to the appetite of curious and
vain wits, as the manner of Mirabilaries is to do; but for two reasons,
both of great weight: the one to correct the partiality of axioms and
opinions, which are commonly framed only upon common and familiar
examples; the other because from the wonders of Nature is the nearest
intelligence and passage towards the wonders of art, for it is no more
but by following and, as it were, hounding Nature in her wanderings, to
be able to lead her afterwards to the same place again. Neither am I of
opinion, in this history of marvels, that superstitious narrations of
sorceries, witchcrafts, dreams, divinations, and the like, where there
is an assurance and clear evidence of the fact, be altogether excluded.
For it is not yet known in what cases and how far effects attributed to
superstition do participate of natural causes; and, therefore, howsoever
the practice of such things is to be condemned, yet from the speculation
and consideration of them light may be taken, not only for the
discerning of the offences, but for the further disclosing of Nature.
Neither ought a man to make scruple of entering into these things for
inquisition of truth, as your Majesty hath showed in your own example,
who, with the two clear eyes of religion and natural philosophy, have
looked deeply and wisely into these shadows, and yet proved yourself to
be of the nature of the sun, which passeth through pollutions and itself
remains as pure as before. But this I hold fit, that these narrations,
which have mixture with superstition, be sorted by themselves, and not
to be mingled with the narrations which are merely and sincerely
natural. But as for the narrations touching the prodigies and miracles
of religions, they are either not true or not natural; and, therefore,
impertinent for the story of Nature.</p></li>
<li><p>For history of Nature, wrought or mechanical, I find some
collections made of agriculture, and likewise of manual arts; but
commonly with a rejection of experiments familiar and vulgar; for it is
esteemed a kind of dishonour unto learning to descend to inquiry or
meditation upon matters mechanical, except they be such as may be
thought secrets, rarities, and special subtleties; which humour of vain
and supercilious arrogancy is justly derided in Plato, where he brings
in Hippias, a vaunting sophist, disputing with Socrates, a true and
unfeigned inquisitor of truth; where, the subject being touching beauty,
Socrates, after his wandering manner of inductions, put first an example
of a fair virgin, and then of a fair horse, and then of a fair pot well
glazed, whereat Hippias was offended, and said, “More than for
courtesy’s sake, he did think much to dispute with any that did allege
such base and sordid instances.” Whereunto Socrates answereth, “You have
reason, and it becomes you well, being a man so trim in your vestments,”
andandandandc., and so goeth on in an irony. But the truth is, they be
not the highest instances that give the securest information, as may be
well expressed in the tale so common of the philosopher that, while he
gazed upwards to the stars, fell into the water; for if he had looked
down he might have seen the stars in the water, but looking aloft he
could not see the water in the stars. So it cometh often to pass that
mean and small things discover great, better than great can discover the
small; and therefore Aristotle noteth well, “That the nature of
everything is best seen in his smallest portions.” And for that cause he
inquireth the nature of a commonwealth, first in a family, and the
simple conjugations of man and wife, parent and child, master and
servant, which are in every cottage. Even so likewise the nature of this
great city of the world, and the policy thereof, must be first sought in
mean concordances and small portions. So we see how that secret of
Nature, of the turning of iron touched with the loadstone towards the
north, was found out in needles of iron, not in bars of iron.</p></li>
<li><p>But if my judgment be of any weight, the use of history
mechanical is of all others the most radical and fundamental towards
natural philosophy; such natural philosophy as shall not vanish in the
fume of subtle, sublime, or delectable speculation, but such as shall be
operative to the endowment and benefit of man’s life. For it will not
only minister and suggest for the present many ingenious practices in
all trades, by a connection and transferring of the observations of one
art to the use of another, when the experiences of several mysteries
shall fall under the consideration of one man’s mind; but further, it
will give a more true and real illumination concerning causes and axioms
than is hitherto attained. For like as a man’s disposition is never well
known till he be crossed, nor Proteus ever changed shapes till he was
straitened and held fast; so the passages and variations of nature
cannot appear so fully in the liberty of nature as in the trials and
vexations of art.</p></li>
