<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the thirteenth place
Instances of Alliance or Union. They are those which mingle and unite
natures supposed to be heterogeneous, and marked and set down as such in
the received divisions.</p>
<p>Instances of alliance show that operations and effects attributed to
some one heterogeneous nature as peculiar to it may belong also to other
heterogeneous natures; that this supposed heterogeneity is proved to be
not real or essential, but only a modification of a common nature. They
are therefore of most excellent use in raising and elevating the
understanding from specific differences to genera, and in dispelling
phantoms and false images of things, which in concrete substances come
before us in disguise. For example, let the nature in question be heat.
We are told (and it seems to be a division quite received and
authorized) that there are three kinds of heat: the heat of heavenly
bodies, the heat of animals, and the heat of fire; and that these heats
(especially one of them as compared with the other two) are in their
very essence and species — that is to say, in their specific nature —
distinct and heterogeneous, since the heat of heavenly bodies and of
animals generates and cherishes, while the heat of fire wastes and
destroys. We have, therefore, an instance of alliance in that common
case, when the branch of a vine is brought within a house where a fire
is constantly kept up, and the grapes ripen on it a whole month sooner
than they do out of doors; so that the ripening of fruit, even while it
hangs on the tree, may be brought about by fire, though such ripening
would seem to be the proper work of the sun. From this beginning,
therefore, the understanding, rejecting the notion of essential
heterogeneity, easily rises to inquire what are in reality those points
of difference between the heat of the sun and of fire which cause their
operations to be so dissimilar, however they may themselves partake of a
common nature.</p>
<p>These differences will be found to be four. The first is that the
heat of the sun compared with the heat of fire is far milder and softer
in degree; the second is that in quality (at least as it reaches us
through the air) it is far moister; the third (and this is the main
point) is that it is exceedingly unequal, now approaching and increased,
now receding and diminished; which thing chiefly contributes to the
generation of bodies. For Aristotle was right in asserting that the
principal cause of the generations and corruptions which are going on
here on the surface of the earth is the oblique course of the sun
through the zodiac; whence the heat of the sun, partly by the
alternation of day and night, partly by the succession of summer and
winter, becomes strangely unequal. And yet this great man must go on at
once to corrupt and deprave what he has rightly discovered. For laying
down the law to nature (as his way is), he very dictatorially assigns as
the cause of generation the approach of the sun, and as the cause of
corruption his retreat; whereas both together (the approach of the sun
and his retreat), not respectively, but as it were indifferently, afford
a cause both for generation and production; since inequality of heat
ministers to generation and corruption, equality to conservation only.
There is also a fourth specific difference between the heat of the sun
and of fire, and one of very great moment; viz., that the sun operates
by gentle action through long spaces of time, whereas the operations of
fire, urged on by the impatience of man, are made to finish their work
in shorter periods. But if anyone were to set to work diligently to
temper the heat of fire and reduce it to a milder and more moderate
degree, as is easily done in many ways, and were then to sprinkle and
intermix a little moisture; and if above all he were to imitate the heat
of the sun in its inequality; and lastly if he could submit to a slow
procedure, not indeed corresponding to the operations of the sun, but
yet slower than men generally adopt in working with fire; he would
speedily get rid of the notion of different kinds of heat, and would
attempt to imitate, if not equal or in some cases even surpass the works
of the sun by the heat of fire. We have a similar instance of alliance
in the revival of butterflies stupefied and half dead with cold, by
slightly warming them at a fire. So that you may easily see that fire is
no more without the power of giving life to animals than of ripening
vegetables. Thus also Fracastorius’ celebrated invention of the heated
pan with which doctors cover the heads of apoplectic patients who are
given over, manifestly expands the animal spirits, compressed and all
but extinguished by the humors and obstructions of the brain, and
exciting them to motion, just as fire acts on air or water, by
consequence quickens and gives them life. Eggs also are sometimes
hatched by the heat of fire, which thus exactly imitates animal heat.
And there are many instances of the same kind, so that no one can doubt
that the heat of fire may in many subjects be modified so as to resemble
the heat of heavenly bodies and of animals.</p>
<p>Again, let the natures in question be motion and rest. It appears to
be a received division and drawn from the depths of philosophy, that
natural bodies either move in circle, or move straight forward, or
remain at rest. For there is either motion without limit, or rest at a
limit, or progress toward a limit. Now, that perpetual motion of
rotation seems to be proper to the heavenly bodies, station or rest
seems to belong to the globe of the earth, while other bodies (which
they call heavy or light, being indeed placed out of the region to which
they naturally belong) are carried toward the masses or congregations of
their likes; light bodies upward toward the circumference of the heaven,
heavy bodies downward towards the earth. And this is pretty talk.</p>
<p>But we have an instance of alliance in one of the lower comets, which
though far below the heaven, nevertheless revolve. And Aristotle’s
fiction of a comet being tied to or following some particular star has
long been exploded, not only because the reason for it is not probable,
but because we have manifest experience of the discursive and irregular
motion of comets through various parts of the sky.</p>
<p>Again, another instance of alliance on this subject is the motion of
air, which within the tropics, where the circles of rotation are larger,
seems itself also to revolve from east to west.</p>
<p>Again, another instance would be the ebb and flow of the sea, if it
be found that the waters themselves are carried in a motion of rotation
(however slow and evanescent) from east to west, though subject to the
condition of being driven back twice in the day. For if things be so, it
is manifest that that motion of rotation is not limited to heavenly
bodies, but is shared also by air and water.</p>
<p>Even that property of light substances, viz., that they tend upward,
is somewhat at fault. And on this point a bubble of water may be taken
as an instance of alliance. For if there be air under the water it
rapidly ascends to the surface by that motion of percussion (as
Democritus calls it) by which the descending water strikes and raises
the air upward; not by any effort or struggle of the air itself. And
when it is come to the surface of the water, then the air is stopped
from further ascent by a slight resistance it meets with in the water,
which does not immediately allow itself to be separated; so that the
desire of air to ascend must be very slight.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be weight. It is quite a received
division that dense and solid bodies move toward the center of the
earth, rare and light toward the circumference of the heaven, as to
their proper places. Now as for this notion of places, though such
things prevail in the schools, it is very silly and childish to suppose
that place has any power. Therefore philosophers do but trifle when they
say that if the earth were bored through, heavy bodies would stop on
reaching the center. Certainly it would be a wonderful and efficacious
sort of nothing, or mathematical point, which could act on bodies, or
for which bodies could have desire, for bodies are not acted on except
by bodies. But this desire of ascending and descending depends either on
the configuration of the body moved or on its sympathy or consent with
some other body. Now if there be found any body which, being dense and
solid, does not move to the earth, there is an end of this division. But
if</p>
<p>Gilbert’s opinion be received, that the earth’s magnetic power of
attracting heavy bodies does not extend beyond the orb of its virtue
(which acts always to a certain distance and no more), and if this
opinion be verified by a single instance, in that we shall have got at
last an instance of alliance on the subject of weight. But at present
there does not occur any instance on this subject certain and manifest.
What seems to come nearest to one is that of the waterspouts, often seen
in the voyage over the Atlantic Ocean toward either of the Indies. For
so great is the quantity and mass of water suddenly discharged by these
waterspouts that they seem to have been collections of water made
before, and to have remained hanging in these places, and afterward to
have been rather thrown down by some violent cause, than to have fallen
by the natural motion of gravity. So that it may be conjectured that a
dense and compact mass, at a great distance from the earth, would hang
like the earth itself and not fall unless thrust down. But on this point
I affirm nothing certain. Meanwhile in this and many other cases it will
easily be seen how poor we are in natural history, when in place of
certain instances I am sometimes compelled to adduce as examples bare
suppositions.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be discourse of reason. The
distinction between human reason and the sagacity of brutes appears to
be a perfectly correct one. Yet there are certain instances of actions
performed by animals, by which it seems that brutes too have some power
of syllogizing; as in the old story of the crow which, in a time of
great drought being half dead with thirst, saw some water in the hollow
trunk of a tree, and finding it too narrow to get in, proceeded to drop
in a number of pebbles till the water rose high enough for it to drink;
and this afterward passed into a proverb.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be visibility. It appears to be a
very correct and safe division which regards light as primarily visible,
and affording the power of seeing; while color is secondarily visible,
and cannot be seen without light, so that it appears to be nothing more
than an image or modification of light. And yet there appear to be
instances of alliance on either side, namely, snow in great quantities,
and the flame of sulphur; in one of which there appears to be a color
primarily giving light, in the other a light verging on color.</p>
