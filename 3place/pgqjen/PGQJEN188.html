XVII. THE AUTHORIZED VERSION OF THE BIBLE, 1611.</h4>
<p>Is it not strange that there is no mention of any connection of
Francis Bacon with this work? There was a conference held at Hampton
Court Palace before King James on January, 1603, between the
Episcopalians and Puritans. John Rainoldes urged the necessity of
providing for his people a uniform translation of the Bible. Rainoldes
was the leader of the Puritans, a person of prodigious reading and
doctrine, and the very treasury of erudition. Dr. Hall, Bishop of
Norwich, reports that “he alone was a well furnished library, full of
all faculties, of all studies, of all learning — the memory and reading
of that man were near a miracle.” The King approved the suggestion and
commissioned for that purpose fifty-four of the most learned men in the
universities and other places. There was a “careful selection of
revisers made by some unknown but very competent authority.” The
translators were divided into six bands of nine each, and the work of
translation was apportioned out to them. A set of rules was drawn up for
their guidance, which has happily come down to modern times — almost the
only record that remains of this great undertaking. These concise rules
have a homogeneity, breadth and vigour which point to Bacon as their
author. Each reviser was to translate the whole of the original
allocated to his company; then they were to compare their translations
together, and, as soon as a company had completed its part, it was to
communicate the result to the other companies, that nothing might pass
without the general consent. If any company, upon the review of the
translation so sent, differed on any point, they were to note their
objection and state their reasons for disagreement. If the differences
could not be adjusted, there was a committee of arbitration which met
weekly, consisting of a representative from each company, to whom the
matter in dispute was referred. If any point was found to be very
obscure, letters were to be addressed, by authority, to learned persons
throughout the land inviting their judgment. The work was commenced in
1604. Rainoldes belonged to the company to whom Isaiah and the prophets
were assigned. He died in 1607, before the work was completed. During
his illness his colleagues met in his bedroom so that they might retain
the benefit of his learning. Only forty-seven out of the fifty-four
names are known. When the companies had completed their work, one
complete copy was made at Oxford, one at Cambridge, and one at
Westminster. Those were sent to London. Then two members were selected
from each company to form a committee to review and polish the whole.
The members met daily at Stationers’ Hall and occupied nine months in
their task. Then a final revision was entrusted to Dr. Thomas Bilson and
Dr. Miles Smith, and in 1609 their labours were completed and the result
was handed to the King. Many of the translators have left specimens of
their writing in theological treatises, sermons, and other works. A
careful perusal of all these available justifies the assertion that
amongst the whole body there was not one man who was so great a literary
stylist as to be able to write certain portions of the Authorised
Version, which stamp it as one of the two greatest examples of the
English language. Naturally the interest centres on Dr. Thomas Bilson
and Dr. Miles Smith, to whom the final revision was entrusted. There are
some nine or ten theological works by the former and two sermons by the
latter. Unless the theory of a special divine inspiration for the
occasion be admitted, it is clear that neither Bilson nor Miles Smith
could have given the final touches to the Bible. And now a curious
statement has come down to us. In 1609 the translators handed their work
to the King, and in 1610 he returned it to them completed. James was
incapable of writing anything to which the term beautiful could be
applied. What had happened to the translators’ work whilst it was left
in his hands?</p>
<p>James had an officer of state at that time of whom a contemporary
biographer wrote that “he had the contrivance of all King James his
Designs, until the match with Spain.” It will eventually be proved that
the whole scheme of the Authorised Version of the Bible was Francis
Bacon’s. He was an ardent student not only of the Bible, but of the
early manuscripts. St. Augustine, St. Jerome, and writers of theological
works, were studied by him with industry. He has left his annotations in
many copies of the Bible and in scores of theological works. The
translation must have been a work in which he took the deepest interest
and which he would follow from stage to stage. When the last stage came
there was only one writer of the period who was capable of turning the
phrases with that matchless style which is the great charm of the
Shakespeare plays. Whoever that stylist was, it was to him that James
handed over the manuscripts which he received from the translators. That
man then made havoc of much of the translation, but he produced a result
which, on its literary merits, is without an equal.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago another revision took place, but, notwithstanding
the advantages which the revisers of 1880 had over their predecessors of
1611, their version has failed to displace the older version, which is
too precious to the hearts of the people for them to abandon it.</p>
<p>Although not one of the translators has left any literary work which
would justify the belief that he was capable of writing the more
beautiful portions of the Bible, fortunately Bacon has left an example
which would rather add lustre to than decrease the high standard of the
Bible if it were incorporated in it. As to the truth of this statement
the reader must judge from the following prayer, which was written after
his fall, and which was described by Addison as resembling the devotion
of an angel rather than a man: —</p>
<p>Remember, O Lord, how Thy servant hath walked before Thee; remember
what I have first sought, and what been principal in mine intentions. I
have loved Thy assemblies; I have mourned for the divisions of Thy
Church; I have delighted in the brightness of Thy sanctuary.</p>
<p>This vine, which Thy right hand hath planted in this nation, I have
ever prayed unto Thee that it might have the first and the latter rain,
and that it might stretch her branches to the seas and to the
floods.</p>
<p>The state and bread of the poor and oppressed have been precious in
mine eyes. I have hated all cruelty and hardness of heart. I have,
though in a despised weed, procured the good of all men.</p>
<p>If any have been mine enemies, I thought not of them, neither hath
the sun almost set upon my displeasure; but I have been as a dove, free
from superfluity of maliciousness.</p>
<p>Thy creatures have been my books, but Thy scriptures much more. I
have sought Thee in the courts, fields, and gardens, but I have found
Thee in Thy temples.</p>
<p>Thousand have been my sins and ten thousand my transgressions, but
Thy sanctifications have remained with me, and my heart, through Thy
grace, hath been an unquenched coal upon Thine altar.</p>
<p>O Lord, my strength, I have since my youth met with Thee in all my
ways, by Thy fatherly compassions, by Thy comfortable chastisements, and
by Thy most visible providence. As Thy favours have increased upon me,
so have Thy corrections, so that Thou hast been ever near me, O Lord;
and ever, as Thy worldly blessings were exalted, so secret darts from
Thee have pierced me, and when I have ascended before men, I have
descended in humiliation before Thee.</p>
<p>And now, when I thought most of peace and honour, Thy hand is heavy
upon me, and hath humbled me according to Thy former lovingkindness,
keeping me still in Thy fatherly school, not as a bastard but as a
child. Just are Thy judgments upon me for my sins, which are more in
number than the sands of the sea, but have no proportion to Thy mercies;
for what are the sands of the sea to the sea? Earth, heavens, and all
these are nothing to Thy mercies.</p>
<p>Besides my innumerable sins, I confess before Thee that I am debtor
to Thee for the gracious talent of Thy gifts and graces, which I have
neither put into a napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to exchangers, where
it might have made most profit, but misspent it in things for which I
was least fit so that I may truly say my soul hath been a stranger in
the course of my pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my Saviour’s sake, and receive me
into Thy bosom or guide me in Thy ways.</p>
<p>There is another feature about the first editions of the Authorised
Version which arrests attention. In 1611 the first folio edition was
published. The design with archers, dogs and rabbits which is to be
found over the address “To the Christian Reader” which introduces the
genealogies is also to be found in the folio edition of Shakespeare over
the dedication to the most noble and Incomparable paire of Brethren,
over the Catalogue and elsewhere. Except that the mark of query which is
on the head of the right hand pillar in the design in the Bible is
missing in the Shakespeare folio, and the arrow which the archer on the
right hand side is shooting contains a message in the design used in the
Bible and is without one in the Shakespeare folio.</p>
<p>In the 1612 quarto edition of the Authorised Version on the
title-page of the Genealogies are two designs; that at the head of the
page is printed from the identical block which was used on the
title-page of the first edition of “Venus and Adonis,” 1593, and the
first edition of “Lucrece,” 1594. At the bottom is the design with the
light A and dark A, which is over the dedication to Sir William Cecil in
the “Arte of English Poesie,” 1589. An octavo edition, which is now very
rare, was also published in 1612. On the title-page of the Genealogies
will be found the design with the light A and dark A which is used on
several of the Shakespeare quartos and elsewhere. (Figure XXI.)</p>
<p>The selection of these designs was not made by chance. They were
deliberately chosen to create similitudes between certain books, and
mark their connection with each other.</p>
<p>The revised translation of the Bible was undertaken as a national
work. It was carried out under the personal supervision of the King, but
every record of the proceedings has disappeared. The British Museum does
not contain a manuscript connected with the proceedings of the
translators. In the Record Office have been preserved the original
documents referring to important proceedings of that period. The
parliamentary, judicial, and municipal records are, on the whole, in a
complete condition, but ask for any records connected with the
Authorised Version of the Bible and the reply is: “We have none.” And
yet it is reasonable to suppose that manuscripts and documents of such
importance would be preserved. Where are they to be found?</p>
