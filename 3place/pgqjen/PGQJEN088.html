<h4 id="chapter-26">Chapter 26</h4>
<p>Of the impediments which have been in the nature of society and the
policies of state. That there is no composition of estate or society,
nor order or quality of persons, which have not some point of
contrariety towards true knowledge. That monarchies incline wits to
profit and pleasure, and commonwealths to glory and vanity. That
universities incline wits to sophistry and affectation, cloisters to
fables and unprofitable subtilty, study at large to variety; and that it
is hard to say, whether mixture of contemplations with an active life,
or retiring wholly to contemplations, do disable and hinder the mind
more.</p>
<p>Back Cover</p>
<p>Philosophy.</p>
<p>Line 1: see commentary</p>
<p>Line 2: libri dimidium est, pagina 34</p>
<p>Line 3: pagellarum numeri veri</p>
<p>Writing on the Back Cover of VALERIUS TERMINUS</p>
<p>The writing in the original is on the outside of the last leaf, which
is in fact the cover. The front cover, if there ever was one, is lost.
The ink with which the line containing the symbols is written
corresponds with that in the body of the manuscript; and the line itself
is placed symmetrically in the middle of the page, near the top. The two
lower lines are apparently by another hand, probably of later date,
certainly in ink of a different colour, and paler. The word “Philosophy”
is in Bacon’s own hand, written lightly in the upper corner at the left,
and is no doubt merely a docket inserted afterwards when he was sorting
his papers. What connexion there was between the note and the manuscript
it is impossible to say. But it is evidently a careful memorandum of
something, set down by somebody when the manuscript was at hand; and so
many of the characters resemble those adopted to represent the planets
and the signs of the zodiac, that one is led to suspect in it a note of
the positions of the heavenly bodies at the time of some remarkable
accident; — perhaps the plague, of which 30,578 persons died in London,
during the year ending 22nd December, 1603. The period of the
commencement, the duration, or the cessation of such an epidemic might
naturally be so noted.</p>
<p>Now three of the characters clearly represent respectively Mercury,
Aquarius, and Sagittarius. The sign for Jupiter, as we find it in old
books, is so like a 4, that the first figure of 45 may very well have
been meant for it. The monogram at the beginning of the line bears a
near resemblance to the sign of Capricorn in its most characteristic
feature. And the mark over the sign of Aquarius appears to be an
abbreviation of that which usually represents the Sun. (The blot between
1603 and B is nothing; being only meant to represent a figure 6 blotted
out with the finger before the ink was dry.) Suspecting therefore that
the writing contained a note of the positions of Mercury and Jupiter in
the year 1603, I sent a copy to a scientific friend and asked him if
from such data he could determine the month indicated. He found upon a
rough calculation (taking account of mean motions only) that Jupiter did
enter the sign of Sagittarius about the 10th of August, 1603, and
continued there for about a twelvemonth; that the Sun entered Aquarius
about the 12th or 13th of January, 1603–4; and that Mercury was about
the 16th or 17th of the same month in the 26th or 27th degree of
Capricorn:— coincidences which would have been almost conclusive as to
the date indicated, if Capricorn had only stood where Aquarius does, and
vice versa. But their position as they actually stood in the manuscript
is a formidable, if not fatal, objection to the interpretation.</p>
<p>According to another opinion with which I have been favoured, the
first monogram is a NOTA BENE; the next group may mean DIES MERCURII
(Wednesday) 26TH JANUARY, 1603; and the rest refers to something not
connected with astronomy. But to this also there is a serious objection.
The 26th of January, 1603–4, was a Friday, and it seems to me very
improbable that any Englishman would have described the preceding
January as belonging to the year 1603. Bacon himself invariably dated
according to the civil year, and the occasional use of the historical
year in loose memoranda would have involved all his dates in confusion.
I should think it more probable that the writer (who may have been
copying a kind of notation with which he was not familiar) miscopied the
sign of Venus into that of Mercury; in which case it would mean Friday,
26th January, 1603–4. But even then the explanation would he
unsatisfactory, as leaving so much unexplained. Those however who are
familiar with old manuscripts relating to such subjects may probably be
able to interpret the whole.</p>
