<h4 id="of-cunning">Of Cunning</h4>
<p>We take cunning for a sinister or crooked wisdom. And certainly there
is a great difference, between a cunning man, and a wise man; not only
in point of honesty, but in point of ability. There be, that can pack
the cards, and yet cannot play well; so there are some that are good in
canvasses and factions, that are otherwise weak men. Again, it is one
thing to understand persons, and another thing to understand matters;
for many are perfect in men’s humors, that are not greatly capable of
the real part of business; which is the constitution of one that hath
studied men, more than books. Such men are fitter for practice, than for
counsel; and they are good, but in their own alley: turn them to new
men, and they have lost their aim; so as the old rule, to know a fool
from a wise man, Mitte ambos nudos ad ignotos, et videbis, doth scarce
hold for them. And because these cunning men, are like haberdashers of
small wares, it is not amiss to set forth their shop.</p>
<p>It is a point of cunning, to wait upon him with whom you speak, with
your eye; as the Jesuits give it in precept: for there be many wise men,
that have secret hearts, and transparent countenances. Yet this would be
done with a demure abasing of your eye, sometimes, as the Jesuits also
do use.</p>
<p>Another is, that when you have anything to obtain, of present
despatch, you entertain and amuse the party, with whom you deal, with
some other discourse; that he be not too much awake to make objections.
I knew a counsellor and secretary, that never came to Queen Elizabeth of
England, with bills to sign, but he would always first put her into some
discourse of estate, that she mought the less mind the bills.</p>
<p>The like surprise may be made by moving things, when the party is in
haste, and cannot stay to consider advisedly of that is moved.</p>
<p>If a man would cross a business, that he doubts some other would
handsomely and effectually move, let him pretend to wish it well, and
move it himself in such sort as may foil it.</p>
<p>The breaking off, in the midst of that one was about to say, as if he
took himself up, breeds a greater appetite in him with whom you confer,
to know more.</p>
<p>And because it works better, when anything seemeth to be gotten from
you by question, than if you offer it of yourself, you may lay a bait
for a question, by showing another visage, and countenance, than you are
wont; to the end to give occasion, for the party to ask, what the matter
is of the change? As Nehemias did; And I had not before that time, been
sad before the king.</p>
<p>In things that are tender and unpleasing, it is good to break the
ice, by some whose words are of less weight, and to reserve the more
weighty voice, to come in as by chance, so that he may be asked the
question upon the other’s speech: as Narcissus did, relating to Claudius
the marriage of Messalina and Silius.</p>
<p>In things that a man would not be seen in himself, it is a point of
cunning, to borrow the name of the world; as to say, The world says, or
There is a speech abroad.</p>
<p>I knew one that, when he wrote a letter, he would put that, which was
most material, in the postscript, as if it had been a by-matter.</p>
<p>I knew another that, when he came to have speech, he would pass over
that, that he intended most; and go forth, and come back again, and
speak of it as of a thing, that he had almost forgot.</p>
<p>Some procure themselves, to be surprised, at such times as it is like
the party that they work upon, will suddenly come upon them; and to be
found with a letter in their hand or doing somewhat which they are not
accustomed; to the end, they may be apposed of those things, which of
themselves they are desirous to utter.</p>
<p>It is a point of cunning, to let fall those words in a man’s own
name, which he would have another man learn, and use, and thereupon take
advantage. I knew two, that were competitors for the secretary’s place
in Queen Elizabeth’s time, and yet kept good quarter between themselves;
and would confer, one with another, upon the business; and the one of
them said, That to be a secretary, in the declination of a monarchy, was
a ticklish thing, and that he did not affect it: the other straight
caught up those words, and discoursed with divers of his friends, that
he had no reason to desire to be secretary, in the declination of a
monarchy. The first man took hold of it, and found means it was told the
Queen; who, hearing of a declination of a monarchy, took it so ill, as
she would never after hear of the other’s suit.</p>
<p>There is a cunning, which we in England can, the turning of the cat
in the pan; which is, when that which a man says to another, he lays it
as if another had said it to him. And to say truth, it is not easy, when
such a matter passed between two, to make it appear from which of them
it first moved and began.</p>
<p>It is a way that some men have, to glance and dart at others, by
justifying themselves by negatives; as to say, This I do not; as
Tigellinus did towards Burrhus, Se non diversas spes, sed incolumitatem
imperatoris simpliciter spectare.</p>
<p>Some have in readiness so many tales and stories, as there is nothing
they would insinuate, but they can wrap it into a tale; which serveth
both to keep themselves more in guard, and to make others carry it with
more pleasure. It is a good point of cunning, for a man to shape the
answer he would have, in his own words and propositions; for it makes
the other party stick the less.</p>
<p>It is strange how long some men will lie in wait to speak somewhat
they desire to say; and how far about they will fetch; and how many
other matters they will beat over, to come near it. It is a thing of
great patience, but yet of much use.</p>
<p>A sudden, bold, and unexpected question doth many times surprise a
man, and lay him open. Like to him that, having changed his name, and
walking in Paul’s, another suddenly came behind him, and called him by
his true name whereat straightways he looked back.</p>
<p>But these small wares, and petty points, of cunning, are infinite;
and it were a good deed to make a list of them; for that nothing doth
more hurt in a state, than that cunning men pass for wise.</p>
<p>But certainly some there are that know the resorts and fans of
business, that cannot sink into the main of it; like a house that hath
convenient stairs and entries, but never a fair room. Therefore you
shall see them find out pretty looses in the conclusion, but are no ways
able to examine or debate matters. And yet commonly they take advantage
of their inability, and would be thought wits of direction. Some build
rather upon the abusing of others, and (as we now say) putting tricks
upon them, than upon soundness of their own proceedings. But Solomon
saith, Prudens advertit ad gressus suos; stultus divertit ad dolos.</p>
