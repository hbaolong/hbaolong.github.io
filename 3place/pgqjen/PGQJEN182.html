XI. BACON’S SECOND VISIT TO THE CONTINENT AND AFTER.</h4>
<p>In the “Reliquiæ Bodleianæ,” published in 1703, is a letter written
without date by Thomas Bodley to Francis Bacon. This letter does not
appear to have been known to Mallett, Montague, Dixon, Spedding, or any
of Bacon’s biographers. It had been lost sight of until the writer
noticed it and reproduced it in Baconiana. This is the letter: —</p>
<p>My Dear Cousin, — According to your request in your letter (dated the
19th October at Orleans, I received here the 18th of December), I have
sent you by your merchant £30 (the thirty is written thus 30 l) sterling
for your present supply, and had sent you a greater sum, but that my
extraordinary charge this year hath utterly unfurnished me. And now,
cousin, though I will be no severe exactor of the account, either of
your money or time, yet for the love I bear you, I am very desirous,
both to satisfy myself, and your friends how you prosper in your
travels, and how you find yourself bettered thereby, either in knowledge
of God, or of the world; the rather, because the Days you have already
spent abroad, are now both sufficient to give you Light, how to fix
yourself and end with counsel, and accordingly to shape your course
constantly unto it. Besides, it is a vulgar scandal unto the travellers,
that few return more religious (narrow, editor) than they went forth;
wherein both my hope and Request is to you, that your principal care be
to hold your Foundation, and to make no other use of informing your self
in the corruptions and superstitions of other nations, than only thereby
to engage your own heart more firmly to the Truth. You live indeed in a
country of two several professions, and you shall return a Novice, if
you be not able to give an account of the Ordinances, strength, and
progress of each, in Reputation, and Party, and how both are supported,
ballanced and managed by the state, as being the contrary humours, in
the Temper of Predominancy whereof, the Health or Disease of that Body
doth consist. These things you will observe, not only as an English-man,
whom it may concern, to what interest his country may expect in the
consciences of their Neighbours; but also, as a Christian, to consider
both the beauties and blemishes, the hopes and dangers of the church in
all places. Now for the world, I know it too well, to persuade you to
dive into the practices thereof; rather stand upon your own guard,
against all that attempt you there unto, or may practise upon you in
your Conscience, Reputation, or your Purse. Resolve, no Man is wise or
safe, but he that is honest: And let this Persuasion turn your studies
and observations from the Complement and Impostures of the debased age,
to more real grounds of wisdom, gathered out of the story of Times past,
and out of the government of the present state. Your guide to this, is
the knowledge of the country and the people among whom ye live; For the
country though you cannot see all places, yet if, as you pass along, you
enquire carefully, and further help yourself with Books that are written
of the cosmography of those parts, you shall sufficiently gather the
strength, Riches, Traffick, Havens, Shipping, commodities, vent, and the
wants and disadvantages of places. Wherein also, for your good
hereafter, and for your friends, it will befit to note their buildings,
Furnitures, Entertainments; all their Husbandry, and ingenious
inventions, in whatsoever concerneth either Pleasure or Profit.</p>
<p>For the people, your traffick among them, while you learn their
language, will sufficiently instruct you in their Habilities,
Dispositions, and Humours, if you a little enlarge the Privacy of your
own Nature, to seek acquaintance with the best sort of strangers, and
restrain your Affections and Participation, for your own countrymen of
whatsoever condition.</p>
<p>In the story of France, you have a large and pleasant Field in three
lines of their Kings, to observe their alliances and successions, their
Conquests, their wars, especially with us; their Councils, their
treaties; and all Rules and examples of experiences and Wisdom, which
may be Lights and Remembrances to you hereafter, to Judge of all
occurants both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Lastly, for the Government, your end must not be like an
Intelligencer, to spend all your time in fishing after the present News,
Humours, Graces, or Disgraces of Court, which happily may change before
you come home; but your better and more constant ground will be, to know
the Consanguinities, Alliances, and Estates of their Princes; Proportion
between the Nobility and Magistracy; the Constitutions of their Courts
of Justice; the state of the Laws, as well for the making as the
execution thereof; How the Sovereignty of the King infuseth itself into
all Acts and Ordinances; how many ways they lay Impositions and
Taxations, and gather Revenues to the Crown.</p>
<p>What be the Liberties and Servitudes of all degrees; what Discipline
and Preparations for wars; what Invention for increase of Traffick at
home, for multiplying their commodities, encouraging Arts and
Manufactures, or of worth in any kind. Also what establishment, to
prevent the Necessities and Discontentment of People, To cut off suits
at Law, and Duels, to suppress thieves and all Disorders.</p>
<p>To be short, because my purpose is not to bring all your Observations
to Heads, but only by these few to let you know what manner of Return
your Friends expect from you; let me, for all these and all the rest,
give you this one Note, which I desire you to observe as the Counsels of
a Friend, Not to spend your Spirits, and the precious time of your
Travel, in a Captious Prejudice and censuring of all things, nor in an
Infectious Collection of base Vices and Fashions of Men and Women, or
general corruption of these times, which will be of use only Among
Humorists, for Jests and Table-Talk: but rather strain your Wits and
Industry soundly to instruct your-self in all things between Heaven and
Earth which may tend to Virtue, Wisdom, and Honour, and which may make
your life more profitable to your country, and yourself more comfortable
to your friends, and acceptable to God. And to conclude, let all these
Riches be treasured up, not only in your memory, where time may lessen
your stock; but rather in good writings, and Books of Account, which
will keept them safe for your use hereafter.</p>
<p>And if in this time of your liberal Traffick, you will give me any
advertizement of your commodities in these kinds, I will make you as
liberal a Return from my self and your Friends here, as I shall be
able.</p>
<p>And so commending all your good Endeavours, to him that must either
wither or prosper them, I very kindly bid you farewel.</p>
<p>Your’s to be commanded,</p>
<p>Thomas Bodley.</p>
<p>Spedding prints this letter (Vol. II. p. 16) commencing with the
words, “Yet for the love I bear,” to the end, with the exception of the
last sentence, as a letter written probably by Bacon for Essex to send
to the Earl of Rutland. He identifies it as “the letter which the
compiler of Stephens’ Catalogue took for a letter addressed by Bacon to
Buckingham,” which he says it could not be. The original is at Lambeth
(MSS. 936, fo. 218). The seal remains, but the part of the last sheet
which contained the signature on one side, and the superscription on the
other, has been torn off. The letter commences, “My good Lord,” and
ends, “Your Lordship’s in all duty to serve you.” It would appear,
therefore, that someone had access to Bodley’s letter to Bacon, and,
approving its contents, used its contents a second time.</p>
<p>There are two palpable deductions to be drawn from this letter: (1)
That Bacon was on a journey through several countries to obtain
knowledge of their customs, laws, religion, military strength, shipping,
and whatsoever concerneth pleasure or profit. There is a striking
correspondence between Bodley’s advice and the description of Bacon’s
travels found in the “Life” prefixed to “L’Histoire Naturelle.” (2) That
Bacon was being supported by Bodley and other of his friends, who
desired him to keep a record of all that he observed and learnt, and to
report from time to time as he progressed, and in return, said Bodley,
“I will make you as liberal a return from myself and your friends here
as I shall be able.” This letter was written from England, and there is
a paragraph in Bodley’s “Life,” written by himself, which makes it
possible to fix the year: —</p>
<p>“My resolution fully taken I departed out of England anno 1576 and
continued very neare foure yeares abroad, and that in sundry parts of
Italy, France, and Germany. A good while after my return to wit, in the
yeare 1585 I was employed by the Queen,” etc.</p>
<p>If this letter was written between 1576 and 1579 it would appear
strange that Bodley and others should be providing Bacon with money for
his travels, and requiring reports from him, whilst his father, Sir
Nicholas Bacon, was alive and prosperous. No such difficulty, however,
arises, for the letter, being sent from England, could not have been
written between the date of Bacon’s first departure for France in 1576
and his return on his father’s death in 1579, for during the whole of
that time Bodley was abroad. It is stated in it that Bacon wrote from
Orleans a letter dated 19th October, the year not being given. This
could not be in 1580, for Bacon wrote to Lord Burghley from Gray’s Inn
on the 18th October, 1580. Spedding commences the paragraph immediately
following this letter by saying, “From this time we have no further news
of Francis Bacon till the 5th of April, 1582,” and although he does not
reproduce the letter, he relies on a letter from Faunt to Anthony Bacon,
to which that date is attributed in Birch’s “ Memorials,” Vol. I. page
22. In it Faunt refers to having seen Anthony’s mother and his brother
Francis. Faunt left Paris for England on the 22nd March, 1582. This
letter was written on the 15th of the following month, so no trace has
been found of Francis being in England between 18th October, 1580, and
5th of April, 1582. Bodley’s letter, must, therefore, have been written
in December, 1581, when Bacon was abroad making a journey through
several countries. From the foregoing facts it is impossible to form any
other conclusion. Now for the first time this journey has been made
known. There is a letter amongst the State papers in the Record Office,
dated February, 1581, written by Anthony Bacon to Lord Burghley,
enclosing a note of advice and instructions for his brother Francis.
Anthony was an experienced traveller, and was then abroad. It reads as
though he was sending advice and instructions to his younger brother,
who was about to start on travels through countries with which Anthony
was familiar. If so, Francis would leave England early in March, 1581 —
that is, if he had not left before this letter was received by
Burghley.</p>
<p>Having established beyond reasonable doubt the fact of this journey,
a new and remarkable suggestion presents itself. Spedding, when dealing
with the year 1582, prints “Notes on the State of Christendom,”29 with
the following remarks: —</p>
<p>“If that paper of notes concerning ‘The State of Europe’ which was
printed as Bacon’s in the supplement to Stephens’ second collection in
1734, reprinted by Mallet in 1760, and has been placed at the beginning
of his political writings in all editions since 1563, be really of his
composition, this is the period of his life to which it belongs. I must
confess, however, that I am not satisfied with the evidence or authority
upon which it appears to have been ascribed to him.”</p>
<p>Robert Stephens, who was Historiographer Royal in the reign of
William and Mary, states that the Earl of Oxford placed in his hands
some neglected manuscripts and loose papers to see whether any of the
Lord Bacon’s compositions lay concealed there and were fit for
publication. He found some of them written, and others amended, with his
lordship’s own hand. He found certain of the treatises had been
published by him, and that others, certainly genuine, which had not,
were fit to be transcribed if not divulged. Spedding states that he has
little doubt that this paper on the state of Europe was among these
manuscripts and loose papers, for the editor states that the
supplementary pieces (of which this was one) were added from originals
found among Stephens’ papers. The original is now among the Harleian
MSS. in the British Museum. Spedding thus describes it: —</p>
<p>“The Harleian MS. is a copy in an old hand, probably contemporary,
but not Francis Bacon’s. A few sentences have been inserted afterwards
by the same hand, and two by another which is very like Anthony Bacon’s;
none in Francis’s. The blanks have all been filled up, but no words have
been corrected, though it is obvious that in some places they stand in
need of correction.</p>
<p>“Certain allusions to events then passing (which will be pointed out
in their place) prove that the original paper was written, or at least
completed, in the summer of 1582, at which time Francis Bacon was
studying law in Gray’s Inn, while Anthony was travelling in France in
search of political intelligence and was in close correspondence with
Nicholas Faunt, a secretary of Sir Francis Walsingham’s, who had spent
the previous year in France, Germany, Switzerland, and the north of
Italy, on the same errand; and was now living about the English Court,
studying affairs at home, and collecting and arranging the observations
which he had made abroad, ‘having already recovered all his writings and
books which he had left behind him in Italy and in Frankfort’ (see
Birch’s ‘Memoirs,’ I. 24), and it is remembered that if this paper
belonged to Anthony Bacon, it would naturally descend at his death to
Francis and so remain among his manuscripts, where it is supposed to
have been found.</p>
<p>“Thus it appears that the external evidence justifies no inference as
to the authorship, and the only question is whether the style can be
considered conclusive. To me it certainly is not. But as this is a point
upon which the reader should be allowed to judge for himself, and as the
paper is interesting in itself and historically valuable and has always
passed for Bacon’s, it is here printed from the original though (to
distinguish it from his undoubted compositions) in a smaller type.”</p>
<p>Spedding’s difficulty in accepting this paper as from Bacon’s pen
really lay in the fact that from the internal evidence it is obvious
that it was written by one who had himself travelled through, at any
rate, some of the countries described. The results of personal
observation are again and again apparent. According to Spedding, Bacon
was in 1581-1582 studying law at Gray’s Inn; according to Bodley he was
on the Continent making observations for his future guidance. The reader
can judge of the value of the external evidence. It is not conclusive,
but the draft being found amongst papers which were unquestionably
Bacon’s writings and being adopted as Bacon’s and published as such by
those who found it, the balance of probabilities is distinctly in favour
of its being his. As to the internal evidence much may be said. It
corresponds as closely as it is possible with Bodley’s requirements as
set forth in his letter of December. It is exactly “the manner of
return” Bodley wrote to Francis “your friends expect from you.” “And,”
he added, “if in this time of your liberal Traffick, you will give me
any advertisement of your commodities in these kinds, I will make you as
liberal a return from myself and your friends here as I shall be
able.”</p>
<p>The date agrees with that of Bacon’s second visit to the Continent.
In Spedding’s Life and Letters it occupies twelve and a-half pages, of
which five are occupied by descriptions of Italy, one of Austria, two of
Germany (chiefly a recital of names and places), two of France,
three-quarters of Spain, one and three-quarters of Portugal, Poland,
Denmark, and Sweden. This may have been Bacon’s itinerary in 1581-2.</p>
<p>Italy is treated with considerable detail and was undoubtedly
described from personal observation, as were France and Spain. In a less
degree the description of Austria, Poland and Denmark produces this
impression; in a still smaller degree Portugal and Sweden, and it is
quite absent from the description of Germany. Florence, Venice, Mantua,
Genoa, Savoy, are dealt with in most detail. Rawley states that it was
Bacon’s intention to have stayed abroad some years longer when he was
called home by the death of his father, to find himself left in
straightened circumstances. Then followed his ineffectual suit, which he
still persisted in. Bodley evidently was, if not the instigator, at any
rate the paymaster for this second journey. Anthony’s letter of
February, 1581, points to Burghley as a participator in the project. He
would assist not only out of kindly feeling, but the journey would at
any rate get this ambitious, determined young man out of the way for a
time, and possibly the journey might get this unaccustomed suit out of
his mind. Thus it came about.</p>
<p>From Faunt’s letters, Spedding says we derive what little information
we have with regard to Francis’s proceedings from 1583 to 1584. “From
them we gather little more than that he remained studying at Gray’s Inn,
occasionally visiting his mother at Gorhambury, or going with her to
hear Travers at the Temple and occasionally appearing at the Court.”</p>
<p>But the suit was not abandoned, for there is the letter of 25th
August, 1585, to Walsingham, when Bacon writes: “I think the objection
of my years will wear away with the length of my suit. The very stay
doth in this respect concern me, because I am thereby hindered to take a
course of practice which by the leave of God, if her Majesty like not of
my suit, I must and will follow: not for any necessity of estate, but
for my credit sake, which I know by living out of action will wear.”</p>
<p>Again, the old, “rare and unaccustomed suit” of which the Queen could
have had no experience! Either the persuasive powers of Burghley had
failed or he had not exerted them. Probably the latter, because the
troublesome, determined young man is now worrying Walsingham and Hatton
to urge its acceptance with the Queen. The purport of the foregoing
extract effectually precludes the possibility of this suit referring to
his advancement at the bar. For five years it has been proceeding — he
has been indulging in hopes which have been unfulfilled. Now he will
wait no longer, but he will adopt a course which, if her Majesty like
not his suit, by the leave of God he must and will follow, not for any
necessity of making money but because he feels impelled to it by a sense
of responsibility which he must fulfil. Walsingham and Hatton do not
appear to have helped the matter forward. There was little probability
of them succeeding in influencing the Queen where Burghley had failed.
There was still less probability of them attempting to influence her if
Burghley objected. Had this suit referred to advancement in the law it
would have been granted with the aid of Burghley’s influence years
before. Had it referred to some ordinary office of State, friends so
powerful as Burghley, Walsingham and Hatton could and would have
obtained anything within reason for this brilliant young son of Sir
Nicholas Bacon, for there was no complication with Essex until after
1591. But this rare and unaccustomed suit of which there had been no
experience was another matter.</p>
<p>Six more years pass, and although there is now no suit to the Queen
there is the same idea prevailing in the letter to Burghley — a seeking
for help to achieve some great scheme upon which Bacon’s mind was so
fixed “as it cannot be removed,” “whether it be curiosity, vainglory or
nature, or (if one take it favourably) philanthropia.” Still he required
the command of more wits than of a man’s own, which is the thing he did
greatly affect. Still his course was not to get. Still the determination
to achieve the object without help, if help could not be obtained — to
achieve it by becoming some sorry bookmaker or a pioneer in that mine of
truth which Anaxagoras said lay so deep. This is emphasised. These are
“thoughts rather than words, being set down without all art, disguising
or reservation.”</p>
<p>There are two significant sentences in this letter written to
Burghley when Bacon was 31 years of age. He describes Burghley as “the
second founder of my poor estate,” and, further, he uses the expression
“And if your Lordship will not carry me on.” What can these allusions
mean but that Burghley had been rendering financial assistance to his
nephew? If the theory here put forward as to the nature of the suit be
correct, the object was one which would have Burghley’s cordial support.
That he had expressed approval of it must be deduced from the letter of
the 16th of September, 1580. The object was one which, without doubt,
would find still warmer support from Lady Mildred. But the suit was so
unprecedented that it is not to be wondered at that Burghley did not try
to force it through. The work was going forward all the time — slowly
for lack of means and official recognition. Burghley, generous in his
nature, lavish in private life, might, however, be expected to help a
work which he would be glad to see carried to a successful
conclusion.</p>
<p>Had he been less cautious and let young Francis have his head, what
might not have happened! But there was always the fear of letting this
huge intellectual power forge ahead without restraint. It was, however,
working out unseen its scheme and that, too, with Burghley’s help and
that of others. The period from 1576 to 1623 — only 47 years — sees the
English language developed from a state of almost barbaric crudeness to
the highest pitch which any language, classical or modern, has reached.
There was but one workman living at that period who could have
constructed that wonderful instrument and used it to produce such
magnificent examples of its possibilities. It is as reasonable to take
up a watch keeping perfect time and aver that the parts came together by
accident, as to contend that the English language of the Authorised
Version of the Bible and the works of Shakespeare were the result of a
general up-springing of literary taste which was diffused amongst a few
writers of very mediocre ability. The English Renaissance was conceived
in France and born in England in 1579. It ran its course and in 1623
attained its maturity; but when Francis Bacon was no more — he who had
performed that in our tongue which may be preferred either to insolent
Greece or haughty Rome— “things daily fall, wits grow downward, and
eloquence grows backward: so that he may be named and stand as the mark
and ἀχμή of our language.”</p>
