XIII. HOW THE ELIZABETHAN LITERATURE WAS PRODUCED.</h4>
<p>The half century from 1576 to 1625 stands by itself in the history of
the literature of this country. During that period not only was the
English language made, not only were there produced the finest examples
of its capacities, which to-day exist, but the knowledge and wisdom
possessed by the classical writers, the histories of the principal
nations of the world, practically everything that was worth knowing in
the literature which existed in other countries were, for the first
time, made available in the English tongue. And what is still more
remarkable, these translations were printed and published. These works
embraced every art and subject which can be imagined. Further, during
this period there were issued a large number of books crowded with
information upon general subjects. The names on the title-pages of many
of these works are unknown. It is astonishing how many men as to whom
nothing can be learnt, appear about this time to have written one book
and one book only.</p>
<p>These translations were published at a considerable cost. For such
works, being printed in the English language, purchasers were
practically confined to this country, and their number was very limited.
The quantity of copies constituting an edition must have been small. It
is impossible to believe that the sale of these books could realise the
amount of their cost.</p>
<p>Definite information on this point is difficult to obtain, for little
is known as to the prices at which these books were sold.</p>
<p>It appears from the “Transcripts of the Stationers’ Registers” that
the maximum number of copies that went to make up an edition was in the
interest of the workman fixed at 1,250 copies, so that if a larger
number were required the type had to be re-set for each additional 1,250
copies. Double impressions of 2,500 were allowed of primers, catechisms,
proclamations, statutes and almanacs. But the solid literature which
came into the language at this period would not be required in such
quantities. The printer was not usually the vendor of the books. The
publisher and bookseller or stationer carried on in most cases a
distinct business.</p>
<p>Pamphlets, sermons, plays, books of poems, formed the staple ware of
the stationer. The style of the book out of which the stationer made his
money may be gathered from the following extract from The Return from
Parnassus, Act I, scene 3: —</p>
<p>Ingenioso. —</p>
<p>Danter thou art deceived, wit is dearer than thou takest it to bee. I
tell thee this libel of Cambridge has much salt and pepper in the nose:
it will sell sheerely underhand when all those bookes of exhortations
and catechisms lie moulding on thy shopboard.</p>
<p>Danter. —</p>
<p>It’s true, but good fayth, M. Ingenioso, I lost by your last booke;
and you know there is many a one that pays me largely for the printing
of their inventions, but for all this you shall have 40 shillings and an
odde pottle of wine.</p>
<p>Ingenioso. —</p>
<p>40 shillings? a fit reward for one of your reumatick poets, that
beslavers all the paper he comes by, and furnishes the Chaundlers with
wast papers to wrap candles in: … it’s the gallantest Child my invention
was ever delivered off. The title is, a Chronicle of Cambridge Cuckolds;
here a man may see, what day of the moneth such a man’s commons were
inclosed, and when throwne open, and when any entayled some odde crownes
upon the heires of their bodies unlawfully begotten; speake quickly,
ells I am gone.</p>
<p>Danter. —</p>
<p>Oh this will sell gallantly. Ile have it whatsoever it cost, will you
walk on, M. Ingenioso, weele sit over a cup of wine and agree on it.</p>
<p>The publication of such works as Hollingshed’s “Chronicles,” North’s
“Plutarch’s Lives,” Grimston’s “History of France,” and “The French
Academy,” could not have been produced with profit as the object. A
large body of evidence may be brought forward to support this view, but
space will only permit two examples to be here set forth.</p>
<p>In the dedication to Sir William Cecil, of Hollingshed’s
“Chronicles,” 1587, the writer says:</p>
<p>Yet when the volume grew so great as they that were to defraie the
charges for the impression were not willing to go through with the
whole, they resolved first to publish the histories of England,
Scotland, and Ireland with their descriptions.</p>
<p>John Dee spent most of the year 1576 in writing a series of volumes
to be entitled “General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the perfect Art
of Navigation.” In 1577 the first volume was ready for the press. In
June he had to borrow £40 from one friend, £20 from another, and £27
upon “the chayn of gold.” In the following August John Day commenced
printing it at his press in Aldersgate. The title was “The British
Monarchy or Hexameron Brytannicum,” and the edition consisted of 100
copies.</p>
<p>The second volume, “The British Complement,” was ready in the
following December. It was never published. Dee states in his Diary that
the printing would cost many hundreds of pounds, as it contained tables
and figures, and he must first have “a comfortable and sufficient
opportunity or supply thereto.” This he was unable to procure, so the
book remained in manuscript.31</p>
<p>Books of this class were never produced with the object of making
profit. The proceeds of sale would not cover the cost of printing and
publishing, without any provision for the remuneration of the translator
or author. Why were they published, and how was the cost provided?</p>
<p>There was, however, another source of revenue open to the author of a
book. Henry Peacham, in “The Truth of our Time,” says: —</p>
<p>“But then you may say, the Dedication will bee worth a great matter,
either in present reward of money, or preferment by your Patrones
Letter, or other means. And for this purpose you prefixe a learned and
as Panegyricall Epistle as can,” etc.</p>
<p>It is beyond question that an author usually obtained a considerable
contribution towards the cost of the production of a book from the
person to whom the dedication was addressed. A number of books published
during the period from 1576 to 1598 are dedicated to the Queen, to the
Earl of Leicester, and to Lord Burghley. One can only offer a suggestion
on this point which may or may not be correct. If Francis Bacon was
concerned in the issue of these translations and other works, and
Burghley was assisting him financially, it is probable that Burghley
would procure grants from the Queen in respect of books which were
dedicated to her, and would provide funds towards the cost of such books
as were dedicated to himself. “The Arte of English Poesie” was written
with the intention that it should be dedicated to the Queen, but there
was a change in the plans, and Burghley’s name was substituted. When
Bacon, in 1591, is threatening to become “a sorry bookmaker,” he
describes Burghley as the second founder of his poor estate, and uses
the expression, “If your Lordship will not carry me on,” which can only
mean that as to the matter which is the subject of the letter, Burghley
had not merely been assisting but carrying him. The evidence which
exists is strong enough to warrant putting forward this theory as to the
frequency of the names of the Queen and Burghley on the dedications.</p>
<p>The Earl of Leicester desired to have the reputation of being a
patron of the arts, and was willing to pay for advertisement. He was the
Chancellor of Oxford University, and evidently recognised the value of
printing, for in 1585 he erected, at his own expense, a new printing
press for the use of the University. If he paid at all for dedications
he would pay liberally. But, of course, the Queen, Burghley, and
Leicester were accessible to others besides Bacon, and the argument goes
no further than that towards the production of certain books upon which
their names appear the patrons provided part of the cost. The
recognition of this fact, however, does not detract from the importance
of the expressions used by Bacon in his letter to Burghley.</p>
<p>There is abundant testimony to the fact that it was the custom,
during the Elizabethan age, for an author to suppress his own name, and
on the title-page32 substitute either the initials or name of some other
person. The title-pages of this period are as unreliable as are the
names or initials affixed to the dedications and epistles “To the
Reader.”</p>
<p>In 1624 was published “The Historie of the Life and Death of Mary
Stuart Queene of Scotland.” The dedication is signed Wil Stranguage. In
1636 it was reprinted, the same dedication being signed W. Vdall. There
are numerous similar instances.</p>
