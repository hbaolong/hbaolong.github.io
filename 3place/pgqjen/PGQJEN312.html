<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the twenty-first place
Instances of the Rod or Rule, which I also call Instances of Range or of
Limitation. For the powers and motions of things act and take effect at
distances not indefinite or accidental, but finite and fixed; so that to
ascertain and observe these distances in the investigation of the
several natures is of the greatest advantage to practice, not only to
prevent its failure but also to extend and increase its power. For we
are sometimes enabled to extend the range of powers and, as it were, to
diminish distances, as for instance by the use of telescopes.</p>
<p>Most of these powers act and take effect only by manifest contact, as
in the impact of two bodies, where the one does not move the other from
its place unless they touch each other. Also medicines that are applied
externally, as ointments or plasters, do not exert their virtues without
touching the body. Finally, the objects of the taste and touch do not
strike those senses unless they be contiguous to the organs.</p>
<p>There are also powers which act at a distance, though a very small
one; and of these only a few have been hitherto observed, albeit there
are many more than men suspect; as (to take common examples) when amber
or jet attracts straws; bubbles dissolve bubbles on being brought
together; certain purgative medicines draw humors downward, and the
like. So, too, the magnetic power by which iron and a magnet, or two
magnets, are made to meet, operates within a fixed but narrow sphere of
action; but if there be any magnetic virtue flowing from the earth (a
little below the surface), and acting on a steel needle in respect of
its polarity, the action operates at a great distance.</p>
<p>Again, if there be any magnetic power which operates by consent
between the globe of the earth and heavy bodies, or between the globe of
the moon and the waters of the sea (as seems highly probable in the
semimenstrual ebbs and floods), or between the starry sphere and the
planets whereby the latter are attracted to their apogees, all these
must operate at very great distances. There are found also certain
materials which catch fire a long way off, as we are told the naphtha of
Babylon does. Heat also insinuates itself at great distances, as also
does cold; insomuch that by the inhabitants of Canada the masses of ice
that break loose and float about the northern ocean and are borne
through the Atlantic toward that coast are perceived at a great distance
by the cold they give out. Perfumes also (though in these there appears
to be always a certain corporeal discharge) act at remarkable distances,
as those find who sail along the coasts of Florida or some parts of
Spain, where there are whole woods of lemon and orange and like
odoriferous trees, or thickets of rosemary, marjoram, and the like.
Lastly, the radiations of light and impressions of sound operate at vast
distances.</p>
<p>But whether the distances at which these powers act be great or
small, it is certain that they are all finite and fixed in the nature of
things, so that there is a certain limit never exceeded, and a limit
which depends either on the mass or quantity of matter in the bodies
acted on; or on the strength or weakness of the powers acting; or on the
helps or hindrances presented by the media in which they act — all which
things should be observed and brought to computation. Moreover, the
measurements of violent motions (as they are called), as of projectiles,
guns, wheels, and the like, since these also have manifestly their fixed
limits, should be observed and computed.</p>
<p>There are found also certain motions and virtues of a contrary nature
to those which operate by contact and not at a distance, namely, those
which operate at a distance and not by contact; and again those which
operate more feebly at a lesser distance, and more powerfully at a
greater. The act of sight for instance is not well performed in contact
but requires a medium and a distance. Yet I remember being assured by a
person of veracity that he himself under an operation for the cataract,
when a small silver needle was inserted within the first coat of the eye
in order to remove the pellicle of the cataract and push it into a
corner, saw most distinctly the needle passing over the very pupil. But
though this may be true, it is manifest that large bodies are not well
or distinctly seen except at the vertex of a cone, the rays from the
object converging at a certain distance from it. Moreover, old people
see objects better at a little distance than if quite close. In
projectiles, too, it is certain that the impact is not so violent at too
small a distance as it is a little further off. These, therefore, and
like things should be observed in the measurements of motions with
regard to distances.</p>
<p>There is also another kind of local measurement of motions which must
not be omitted. This has to do with motions not progressive, but
spherical, that is, with the expansion of bodies into a greater sphere
or their contraction into a less. For among our measurements of motions
we must inquire what degree of compression or extension bodies
(according to their nature) easily and freely endure, and at what point
they begin to resist, till at last they will bear no more. Thus, when a
blown bladder is compressed, it allows a certain compression of the air,
but if the compression be increased the air does not endure it and the
bladder bursts.</p>
<p>But this same thing I have tested more accurately by a subtle
experiment. I took a small bell of metal, light and thin, such as is
used for holding salt, and plunged it into a basin of water so that it
carried down with it the air contained in its cavity to the bottom of
the basin, where I had previously placed a small globe, on which the
bell was to light. I found then that if the globe was small enough in
proportion to the cavity, the air contracted itself into a less space
and was simply squeezed together, not squeezed out. But if it was too
large for the air to yield freely, then the air, impatient of greater
pressure, raised the bell on one side and rose to the surface in
bubbles.</p>
<p>Again, to test the extension as well as compression of which air was
susceptible, I had recourse to the following device. I took a glass egg
with a small hole at one end of it, and, having drawn out the air
through the hole by violent suction, I immediately stopped up the hole
with my finger and plunged the egg into water, and then took away my
finger. The air, having been extended by the suction and dilated beyond
its natural dimensions, and therefore struggling to contract itself
again (so that if the egg had not been plunged into the water it would
have drawn in air with a hissing sound), now drew in water in sufficient
quantities to allow the air to recover its old sphere or dimension.</p>
<p>Now it is certain that the rarer bodies (such as air) allow a
considerable degree of contraction, as has been stated, but that
tangible bodies (such as water) suffer compression with much greater
difficulty and to a lesser extent. How far they do suffer it I have
investigated in the following experiment. I had a hollow globe of lead
made, capable of holding about two pints, and sufficiently thick to bear
considerable force. Having made a hole in it, I filled it with water and
then stopped up the hole with melted lead, so that the globe became
quite solid. I then flattened two opposite sides of the globe with a
heavy hammer, by which the water was necessarily contracted into less
space, a sphere being the figure of largest capacity. And when the
hammering had no more effect in making the water shrink, I made use of a
mill or press, till the water, impatient of further pressure, exuded
through the solid lead like a fine dew. I then computed the space lost
by the compression and concluded that this was the extent of compression
which the water had suffered, but only when constrained by great
violence.</p>
<p>But the compression or extension endured by more solid, dry, or more
compact bodies, such as wood, stones and metals, is still less than
this, and scarcely perceptible. For they free themselves either by
breaking, or by moving forward, or by other efforts, as is apparent in
the bending of wood or metal, in clocks moving by springs, in
projectiles, hammerings, and numberless other motions. And all these
things with their measures should in the investigation of nature be
explored and set down, either in their certitude, or by estimate, or by
comparison, as the case will admit.</p>
