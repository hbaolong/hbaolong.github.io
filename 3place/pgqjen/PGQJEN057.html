<h4 id="of-honor-and-reputation">Of Honor and Reputation</h4>
<p>The winning of honor, is but the revealing of a man’s virtue and
worth, without disadvantage. For some in their actions, do woo and
effect honor and reputation, which sort of men, are commonly much talked
of, but inwardly little admired. And some, contrariwise, darken their
virtue in the show of it; so as they be undervalued in opinion. If a man
perform that, which hath not been attempted before; or attempted and
given over; or hath been achieved, but not with so good circumstance; he
shall purchase more honor, than by effecting a matter of greater
difficulty or virtue, wherein he is but a follower. If a man so temper
his actions, as in some one of them he doth content every faction, or
combination of people, the music will be the fuller. A man is an ill
husband of his honor, that entereth into any action, the failing wherein
may disgrace him, more than the carrying of it through, can honor him.
Honor that is gained and broken upon another, hath the quickest
reflection, like diamonds cut with facets. And therefore, let a man
contend to excel any competitors of his in honor, in outshooting them,
if he can, in their own bow. Discreet followers and servants, help much
to reputation. Omnis fama a domesticis emanat. Envy, which is the canker
of honor, is best extinguished by declaring a man’s self in his ends,
rather to seek merit than fame; and by attributing a man’s successes,
rather to divine Providence and felicity, than to his own virtue or
policy.</p>
<p>The true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign honor, are these: In
the first place are conditores imperiorum, founders of states and
commonwealths; such as were Romulus, Cyrus, Caesar, Ottoman, Ismael. In
the second place are legislatores, lawgivers; which are also called
second founders, or perpetui principes, because they govern by their
ordinances after they are gone; such were Lycurgus, Solon, Justinian,
Eadgar, Alphonsus of Castile, the Wise, that made the Siete Partidas. In
the third place are liberatores, or salvatores, such as compound the
long miseries of civil wars, or deliver their countries from servitude
of strangers or tyrants; as Augustus Caesar, Vespasianus, Aurelianus,
Theodoricus, King Henry the Seventh of England, King Henry the Fourth of
France. In the fourth place are propagatores or propugnatores imperii;
such as in honorable wars enlarge their territories, or make noble
defence against invaders. And in the last place are patres patriae;
which reign justly, and make the times good wherein they live. Both
which last kinds need no examples, they are in such number. Degrees of
honor, in subjects, are, first participes curarum, those upon whom,
princes do discharge the greatest weight of their affairs; their right
hands, as we call them. The next are duces belli, great leaders in war;
such as are princes’ lieutenants, and do them notable services in the
wars. The third are gratiosi, favorites; such as exceed not this
scantling, to be solace to the sovereign, and harmless to the people.
And the fourth, negotiis pares; such as have great places under princes,
and execute their places, with sufficiency. There is an honor, likewise,
which may be ranked amongst the greatest, which happeneth rarely; that
is, of such as sacrifice themselves to death or danger for the good of
their country; as was M. Regulus, and the two Decii.</p>
