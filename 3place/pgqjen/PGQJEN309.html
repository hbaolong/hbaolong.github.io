<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the nineteenth place
Supplementary or Substitutive Instances, which I also call Instances of
Refuge. They are those which supply information when the senses entirely
fail us, and therefore we fly to them when appropriate instances are not
to be had. Now substitution is made in two ways: either by gradual
approximation or by analogy. To take an example: There is no medium
known by the interposition of which the operation of the magnet in
drawing iron is entirely prevented. Gold placed between does not stop
it, nor silver, nor stone, nor glass, wood, water, oil, cloth or fibrous
substances, air, flame, etc. But yet by nice tests some medium may
possibly be found to deaden its virtue more than any other;
comparatively, that is, and in some degree. Thus it may be that the
magnet would not attract iron as well through a mass of gold as through
an equal space of air, or through ignited silver as well as through
cold; and so in other cases. For I have not made the trial myself in
these cases. It is enough to propose such experiments by way of example.
Again, there is no body we are acquainted with which does not contract
heat on being brought near the fire. And yet air contracts heat much
more quickly than stone. Such is the substitution which is made by
gradual approximation.</p>
<p>Substitution by analogy is doubtless useful, but is less certain, and
should therefore be applied with some judgment. It is employed when
things not directly perceptible are brought within reach of the sense,
not by perceptible operations of the imperceptible body itself, but by
observation of some cognate body which is perceptible. For example,
suppose we are inquiring into the mixture of spirits, which are
invisible bodies. There seems to be a certain affinity between bodies
and the matter that feeds or nourishes them. Now the food of flame seems
to be oil and fat substances; of air, water and watery substances; for
flame multiplies itself over exhalations of oil, air over the vapor of
water. We should therefore look to the mixture of water and oil, which
manifests itself to the sense, since the mixture of air and flame
escapes the sense. Now oil and water, which are mingled together very
imperfectly by composition or agitation, are in herbs and blood and the
parts of animals very subtly and finely mingled. It is possible,
therefore, that something similar may be the case with the mixture of
flame and air in pneumatic bodies, which, though not readily mingling by
simple commixture, yet seem to be mingled together in the spirits of
plants and animals, especially as all animate spirit feeds on moist
substances of both kinds, watery and fat, as its proper food.</p>
<p>Again, if the inquiry be not into the more perfect mixtures of
pneumatic bodies but simply into their composition, that is, whether
they be readily incorporated together; or whether there be not rather,
for example, certain winds and exhalations or other pneumatic bodies
which do not mix with common air, but remain suspended and floating
therein in globules and drops and are rather broken and crushed by the
air than admitted into or incorporated with it — this is a thing which
cannot be made manifest to the senses in common air and other pneumatic
bodies, by reason of their subtlety. Yet how far the thing may take
place we may conceive, by way of image or representation, from what
takes place in such liquids as quicksilver, oil, or water, and likewise
from the breaking up of air when it is dispersed in water and rises in
little bubbles; and again in the thicker kinds of smoke; and lastly, in
dust raised and floating in the air; in all of which cases no
incorporation takes place. Now the representation I have described is
not a bad one for the matter in question, provided that diligent inquiry
has been first made whether there can be such a heterogeneity in
pneumatic bodies as we find there is in liquids. For if there can, then
these images by analogy may not inconveniently be substituted.</p>
<p>But with regard to these supplementary instances, although I stated
that information was to be derived from them in the absence of instances
proper, as a last resource, yet I wish it to be understood that they are
also of great use even when proper instances are at hand — for the
purpose, I mean, of corroborating the information which the others
supply. But I shall treat of them more fully when I come in due course
to speak of the Supports of Induction.</p>
