<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will next place Migratory Instances.
They are those in which the nature in question is in the process of
being produced when it did not previously exist, or on the other hand of
disappearing when it existed before. And therefore, in either
transition, such instances are always twofold, or rather it is one
instance in motion or passage, continued till it reaches the opposite
state. Such instances not only accelerate and strengthen the exclusive
process, but also drive the affirmative or form itself into a narrow
compass. For the form of a thing must necessarily be something which in
the course of this migration is communicated, or on the other hand which
in the course of this migration is removed and destroyed. And though
every exclusion promotes the affirmative, yet this is done more
decidedly when it occurs in the same than in different subjects. And the
betrayal of the form in a single instance leads the way (as is evident
from all that has been said) to the discovery of it in all. And the
simpler the migration, the more must the instance be valued. Besides,
migratory instances are of great use with a view to operation, because
in exhibiting the form in connection with that which causes it to be or
not to be, they supply a clear direction for practice in some cases;
whence the passage is easy to the cases that lie next. There is,
however, in these instances a danger which requires caution; viz., lest
they lead us to connect the form too much with the efficient, and so
possess the understanding, or at least touch it, with a false opinion
concerning the form, drawn from a view of the efficient/But the
efficient is always understood to be merely the vehicle that carries the
form. This is a danger, however, easily remedied by the process of
exclusion legitimately conducted.</p>
<p>I must now give an example of a migratory instance. Let the nature to
be investigated be whiteness. An instance migrating to production or
existence is glass whole and pounded. Again, simple water and water
agitated into froth. For glass and water in their simple state are
transparent, not white, whereas pounded glass and water in froth are
white, not transparent. We must therefore inquire what has happened to
the glass or water from this migration. For it is obvious that the form
of whiteness is communicated and conveyed by that pounding of the glass
and that agitation of the water. We find, however, that nothing has been
added except the breaking up of the glass and water into small parts,
and the introduction of air. But we have made no slight advance to the
discovery of the form of whiteness when we know that two bodies, both
transparent but in a greater or less degree (viz., air and water, or air
and glass), do when mingled in small portions together exhibit
whiteness, through the unequal refraction of the rays of light.</p>
<p>But an example must at the same time be given of the danger and
caution to which I alluded. For at this point it might readily suggest
itself to an understanding led astray by efficient causes of this kind,
that air is always required for the form of whiteness, or that whiteness
is generated by transparent bodies only — notions entirely false, and
refuted by numerous exclusions. Whereas it will be found that (setting
air and the like aside) bodies entirely even in the particles which
affect vision are transparent, bodies simply uneven are white; bodies
uneven and in a compound yet regular texture are all colors except
black; while bodies uneven and in a compound, irregular, and confused
texture are black. Here then I have given an example of an instance
migrating to production or existence in the proposed nature of
whiteness. An instance migrating to destruction in the same nature of
whiteness is froth or snow in dissolution. For the water puts off
whiteness and puts on transparency on returning to its integral state
without air.</p>
<p>Nor must I by any means omit to mention that under migratory
instances are to be included not only those which are passing toward
production and destruction, but also those which are passing toward
increase and decrease; since these also help to discover the form, as is
clear from the above definition of form and the Table of Degrees. The
paper, which is white when dry, but when wetted (that is, when air is
excluded and water introduced) is less white and approaches nearer to
the transparent, is analogous to the above given instances.</p>
