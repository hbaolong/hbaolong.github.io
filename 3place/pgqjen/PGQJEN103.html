<li><p>This science being therefore first placed as a common parent like
unto Berecynthia, which had so much heavenly issue, omnes coelicolas,
omnes supera alta tenetes; we may return to the former distribution of
the three philosophies — divine, natural, and human. And as concerning
divine philosophy or natural theology, it is that knowledge or rudiment
of knowledge concerning God which may be obtained by the contemplation
of His creatures; which knowledge may be truly termed divine in respect
of the object, and natural in respect of the light. The bounds of this
knowledge are, that it sufficeth to convince atheism, but not to inform
religion; and therefore there was never miracle wrought by God to
convert an atheist, because the light of nature might have led him to
confess a God; but miracles have been wrought to convert idolaters and
the superstitious, because no light of nature extendeth to declare the
will and true worship of God. For as all works do show forth the power
and skill of the workman, and not his image, so it is of the works of
God, which do show the omnipotency and wisdom of the Maker, but not His
image. And therefore therein the heathen opinion differeth from the
sacred truth: for they supposed the world to be the image of God, and
man to be an extract or compendious image of the world; but the
Scriptures never vouchsafe to attribute to the world that honour, as to
be the image of God, but only THE WORK OF HIS HANDS; neither do they
speak of any other image of God but man. Wherefore by the contemplation
of nature to induce and enforce the acknowledgment of God, and to
demonstrate His power, providence, and goodness, is an excellent
argument, and hath been excellently handled by divers, but on the other
side, out of the contemplation of nature, or ground of human knowledges,
to induce any verity or persuasion concerning the points of faith, is in
my judgment not safe; Da fidei quae fidei sunt. For the heathen
themselves conclude as much in that excellent and divine fable of the
golden chain, “That men and gods were not able to draw Jupiter down to
the earth; but, contrariwise, Jupiter was able to draw them up to
heaven.” So as we ought not to attempt to draw down or submit the
mysteries of God to our reason, but contrariwise to raise and advance
our reason to the divine truth. So as in this part of knowledge,
touching divine philosophy, I am so far from noting any deficience, as I
rather note an excess; whereunto I have digressed because of the extreme
prejudice which both religion and philosophy hath received and may
receive by being commixed together; as that which undoubtedly will make
an heretical religion, and an imaginary and fabulous
philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise it is of the nature of angels and spirits, which is an
appendix of theology, both divine and natural, and is neither
inscrutable nor interdicted. For although the Scripture saith, “Let no
man deceive you in sublime discourse touching the worship of angels,
pressing into that he knoweth not,” andandandandc., yet notwithstanding
if you observe well that precept, it may appear thereby that there be
two things only forbidden — adoration of them, and opinion fantastical
of them, either to extol them further than appertaineth to the degree of
a creature, or to extol a man’s knowledge of them further than he hath
ground. But the sober and grounded inquiry, which may arise out of the
passages of Holy Scriptures, or out of the gradations of nature, is not
restrained. So of degenerate and revolted spirits, the conversing with
them or the employment of them is prohibited, much more any veneration
towards them; but the contemplation or science of their nature, their
power, their illusions, either by Scripture or reason, is a part of
spiritual wisdom. For so the apostle saith, “We are not ignorant of his
stratagems.” And it is no more unlawful to inquire the nature of evil
spirits, than to inquire the force of poisons in nature, or the nature
of sin and vice in morality. But this part touching angels and spirits I
cannot note as deficient, for many have occupied themselves in it; I may
rather challenge it, in many of the writers thereof, as fabulous and
fantastical.</p></li>
