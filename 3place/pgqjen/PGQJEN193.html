XXII. TWO GERMAN OPINIONS ON SHAKESPEARE AND BACON.</h4>
<p>Dr. G. G. Gervinus, the eminent German Historian and Professor
Extraordinary at Heidelberg, published in 1849 his work, “Shakespeare
Commentaries.” This was years before any suggestion had been made that
Bacon was in any way connected with the authorship of the Shakespearean
dramas.</p>
<p>In the Prospectus of “The New Shakespeare Society,” written in 1873,
Dr. F. J. Furnivall says: —</p>
<p>“The profound and generous ‘Commentaries’ of Gervinus — an honour to
a German to have written, a pleasure to an Englishman to read — is still
the only book known to me that comes near the true treatment and the
dignity of its subject, or can be put into the hands of the student who
wants to know the mind of Shakespeare.”</p>
<p>The book abounds with references to Bacon. From the Preface to the
last chapter Gervinus appears to have Bacon continually suggested to him
by the thoughts and words of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In the Preface, after speaking of the value accruing to German
literature by naturalizing Shakespeare “even at the risk of casting our
own poets still further in the shade,” he says: —</p>
<p>“A similar benefit would it be to our intellectual life if his famed
contemporary, Bacon, were revived in a suitable manner, in order to
counterbalance the idealistic philosophy of Germany. For both these, the
poet as well as the philosopher, having looked deeply into the history
and politics of their people, stand upon the level ground of reality,
notwithstanding the high art of the one and the speculative notions of
the other. By the healthfulness of their own mind they influence the
healthfulness of others, while in their most ideal and most abstract
representations they aim at a preparation for life as it is — for that
life which forms the exclusive subject of all political action.”</p>
<p>In the chapter on “His Age,” written prior to 1849, the Professor
pours out the results of a profound study of the writings attributed to
both men in the following remarkable sentences: —</p>
<p>“Judge then how natural it was that England, if not the birthplace of
the drama, should be that of dramatic legislature. Yet even this
instance of favourable concentration is not the last. Both in philosophy
and poetry everything conspired, as it were, throughout this prosperous
period, in favour of two great minds, Shakespeare and Bacon; all
competitors vanished from their side, and they could give forth laws for
art and science which it is incumbent even upon present ages to fulfil.
As the revived philosophy, which in the former century in Germany was
divided among many, but in England at that time was the possession of a
single man, so poetry also found one exclusive heir, compared with whom
those later born could claim but little.</p>
<p>“That Shakespeare’s appearance upon a soil so admirably prepared was
neither marvellous nor accidental is evidenced even by the corresponding
appearance of such a contemporary as Bacon. Scarcely can anything be
said of Shakespeare’s position generally with regard to mediæval poetry
which does not also bear upon the position of the renovator Bacon with
regard to mediæval philosophy. Neither knew nor mentioned the other,
although Bacon was almost called upon to have done so in his remarks
upon the theatre of his day. It may be presumed that Shakespeare liked
Bacon but little, if he knew his writings and life; that he liked not
his ostentation, which, without on the whole interfering with his
modesty, recurred too often in many instances; that he liked not the
fault-finding which his ill-health might have caused, nor the
narrow-mindedness with which he pronounced the histrionic art to be
infamous, although he allowed that the ancients regarded the drama as a
school for virtue; nor the theoretic precepts of worldly wisdom which he
gave forth; nor, lastly, the practical career which he lived. Before his
mind, however, if he had fathomed it, he must have bent in reverence.
For just as Shakespeare was an interpreter of the secrets of history and
of human nature, Bacon was an interpreter of lifeless nature. Just as
Shakespeare went from instance to instance in his judgment of moral
actions, and never founded a law on single experience, so did Bacon in
natural science avoid leaping from one experience of the senses to
general principles; he spoke of this with blame as anticipating nature;
and Shakespeare, in the same way, would have called the
conventionalities in the poetry of the Southern races an anticipation of
human nature. In the scholastic science of the middle ages, as in the
chivalric poetry of the romantic period, approbation and not truth was
sought for, and with one accord Shakespeare’s poetry and Bacon’s science
were equally opposed to this. As Shakespeare balanced the one-sided
errors of the imagination by reason, reality, and nature, so Bacon led
philosophy away from the one-sided errors of reason to experience; both
with one stroke, renovated the two branches of science and poetry by
this renewed bond with nature; both, disregarding all by-ways, staked
everything upon this ‘victory in the race between art and nature.’ Just
as Bacon with his new philosophy is linked with the natural science of
Greece and Rome, and then with the latter period of philosophy in
western Europe, so Shakespeare’s drama stands in relation to the
comedies of Plautus and to the stage of his own day; between the two
there lay a vast wilderness of time, as unfruitful for the drama as for
philosophy. But while they thus led back to nature, Bacon was yet as
little of an empiric, in the common sense, as Shakespeare was a poet of
nature. Bacon prophesied that if hereafter his commendation of
experience should prevail, great danger to science would arise from the
other extreme, and Shakespeare even in his own day could perceive the
same with respect to his poetry; Bacon, therefore, insisted on the
closest union between experience and reason, just as Shakespeare
effected that between reality and imagination. While they thus bid adieu
to the formalities of ancient art and science, Shakespeare to conceits
and taffeta-phrases, Bacon to logic and syllogisms, yet at times it
occurred that the one fell back into the subtleties of the old school,
and the other into the constrained wit of the Italian style. Bacon felt
himself quite an original in that which was his peculiar merit, and so
was Shakespeare; the one in the method of science he had laid down, and
in his suggestions for its execution, the other in the poetical works he
had executed, and in the suggestions of their new law. Bacon, looking
back to the waymarks he had left for others, said with pride that his
words required a century for their demonstration and several for their
execution; and so too it has demanded two centuries to understand
Shakespeare, but very little has ever been executed in his sense. And at
the same time we have mentioned what deep modesty was interwoven in both
with their self-reliance, so that the words which Bacon liked to quote
hold good for the two works:— ‘The kingdom of God cometh not with
observation.’ Both reached this height from the one starting point, that
Shakespeare despised the million, and Bacon feared with Phocion the
applause of the multitude. Both are alike in the rare impartiality with
which they avoided everything one-sided; in Bacon we find, indeed,
youthful exercises in which he endeavoured in severe contrasts to
contemplate a series of things from two points of view. Both, therefore,
have an equal hatred of sects and parties; Bacon of sophists and
dogmatic philosophers, Shakespeare of Puritans and zealots. Both,
therefore, are equally free from prejudices, and from astrological
superstition in dreams and omens. Bacon says of the alchemists and
magicians in natural science that they stand in similar relation to true
knowledge as the deeds of Amadis to those of Cæsar, and so does
Shakespeare’s true poetry stand in relation to the fantastic romance of
Amadis. Just as Bacon banished religion from science, so did Shakespeare
from Art; and when the former complained that the teachers of religion
were against natural philosophy, they were equally against the stage.
From Bacon’s example it seems clear that Shakespeare left religious
matters unnoticed on the same grounds as himself, and took the path of
morality in worldly things; in both this has been equally misconstrued,
and Le Maistre has proved Bacon’s lack of Christianity, as Birch has
done that of Shakespeare. Shakespeare would, perhaps, have looked down
just as contemptuously on the ancients and their arts as Bacon did on
their philosophy and natural science, and both on the same grounds; they
boasted of the greater age of the world, of more enlarged knowledge of
heaven, earth, and mankind. Neither stooped before authorities, and an
injustice similar to that which Bacon committed against Aristotle,
Shakespeare perhaps has done to Homer. In both a similar combination of
different mental powers was at work; and as Shakespeare was often
involuntarily philosophical in his profoundness, Bacon was not seldom
surprised into the imagination of the poet. Just as Bacon, although he
declared knowledge in itself to be much more valuable than the use of
invention, insisted throughout generally and dispassionately upon the
practical use of philosophy, so Shakespeare’s poetry, independent as was
his sense of art, aimed throughout at bearing upon the moral life. Bacon
himself was of the same opinion; he was not far from declaring history
to be the best teacher of politics, and poetry the best instructor in
morals. Both were alike deeply moved by the picture of a ruling Nemesis,
whom they saw, grand and powerful, striding through history and life,
dragging the mightiest and most prosperous as a sacrifice to her altar,
as the victims of their own inward nature and destiny. In Bacon’s works
we find a multitude of moral sayings and maxims of experience, from
which the most striking mottoes might be drawn for every Shakespearian
play, aye, for every one of his principal characters (we have already
brought forward not a few proofs of this), testifying to a remarkable
harmony in their mutual comprehension of human nature. Both, in their
systems of morality rendering homage to Aristotle, whose ethics
Shakespeare, from a passage in Troilus, may have read, arrived at the
same end as he did — that virtue lies in a just medium between two
extremes. Shakespeare would also have agreed with him in this, that
Bacon declared excess to be ‘the fault of youth, as defect is of age;’
he accounted ‘defect the worst, because excess contains some sparks of
magnanimity, and, like a bird, claims kindred of the heavens, while
defect, only like a base worm, crawls upon the earth.’ In these maxims
lie at once, as it were, the whole theory of Shakespeare’s dramatic
forms and of his moral philosophy.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kuno Fischer, the distinguished German critic and historian of
philosophy, in a volume on Bacon, published in 1856, writes: —</p>
<p>The same affinity for the Roman mind, and the same want of sympathy
with the Greek, we again find in Bacon’s greatest contemporary, whose
imagination took as broad and comprehensive a view as Bacon’s intellect.
Indeed, how could a Bacon attain that position with respect to Greek
poetry that was unattainable by the mighty imagination of a Shakspeare?
For in Shakspeare, at any rate, the imagination of the Greek antiquity
could be met by a homogeneous power of the same rank as itself; and, as
the old adage says, “like comes to like.” But the age, the spirit of the
nation — in a word, all those forces of which the genius of an
individual man is composed, and which, moreover, genius is least able to
resist — had here placed an obstacle, impenetrable both to the poet and
the philosopher. Shakspeare was no more able to exhibit Greek characters
than Bacon to expound Greek poetry. Like Bacon, Shakspeare had in his
turn of mind something that was Roman, and not at all akin to the Greek.
He could appropriate to himself a Coriolanus and a Brutus, a Cæsar and
an Antony; he could succeed with the Roman heroes of Plutarch, but not
with the Greek heroes of Homer. The latter he could only parody, but his
parody was as infelicitous as Bacon’s explanation of the “Wisdom of the
Ancients.” Those must be dazzled critics indeed who can persuade
themselves that the heroes of the Iliad are excelled by the caricatures
in “Troilus and Cressida.” The success of such a parody was poetically
impossible; indeed, he that attempts to parody Homer shows thereby that
he has not understood him. For the simple and the naïve do not admit of
a parody, and these have found in Homer their eternal and inimitable
expression. Just as well might caricatures be made of the statues of
Phidias. Where the creative imagination never ceases to be simple and
naïve, where it never distorts itself by the affected or the unnatural,
there is the consecrated land of poetry, in which there is no place for
the parodist. On the other hand, where there is a palpable want of
simplicity and nature, parody is perfectly conceivable; nay, may even be
felt as a poetical necessity. Thus Euripides, who, often enough, was
neither simple nor naïve, could be parodied, and Aristophanes has shown
us with what felicity. Even Æschylus, who was not always as simple as he
was grand, does not completely escape the parodising test. But Homer is
safe. To parody Homer is to mistake him, and to stand so far beyond his
scope that the truth and magic of his poetry can no longer be felt; and
this is the position of Shakespeare and Bacon. The imagination of Homer,
and all that could be contemplated and felt by that imagination, namely,
the classical antiquity of the Greeks, are to them utterly foreign. We
cannot understand Aristotle without Plato; nay, I maintain that we
cannot contemplate with a sympathetic mind the Platonic world of ideas,
if we have not previously sympathised with the world of the Homeric
gods. Be it understood, I speak of the form of the Platonic mind, not of
its logical matter; in point of doctrine, the Homeric faith was no more
that of Plato than of Phidias. But these doctrinal or logical
differences are far less than the formal and æsthetical affinity. The
conceptions of Plato are of Homeric origin.</p>
<p>This want of ability to take an historical survey of the world is to
be found alike in Bacon and Shakspeare, together with many excellencies
likewise common to them both. To the parallel between them — which
Gervinus, with his peculiar talent for combination, has drawn in the
concluding remarks to his “Shakespeare,” and has illustrated by a series
of appropriate instances — belongs the similar relation of both to
antiquity, their affinity to the Roman mind, and their diversity from
the Greek. Both possessed to an eminent degree that faculty for a
knowledge of human nature that at once pre-supposes and calls forth an
interest in practical life and historical reality. To this interest
corresponds the stage, on which the Roman characters moved; and here
Bacon and Shakspeare met, brought together by a common interest in these
objects, and the attempt to depict and copy them. This point of
agreement, more than any other argument, explains their affinity. At the
same time there is no evidence that one ever came into actual contact
with the other. Bacon does not even mention Shakspeare when he
discourses of dramatic poetry, but passes over this department of poetry
with a general and superficial remark that relates less to the subject
itself than to the stage and its uses. As far as his own age is
concerned, he sets down the moral value of the stage as exceedingly
trifling. But the affinity of Bacon to Shakspeare is to be sought in his
moral and psychological, not in his æsthetical views, which are too much
regulated by material interests and utilitarian prepossessions to be
applicable to art itself, considered with reference to its own
independent value. However, even in these there is nothing to prevent
Bacon’s manner of judging mankind, and apprehending characters from
agreeing perfectly with that of Shakspeare; so that human life, the
subject-matter of all dramatic art, appeared to him much as it appeared
to the great artist himself, who, in giving form to this matter,
excelled all others. Is not the inexhaustible theme of Shakspeare’s
poetry the history and course of human passion? In the treatment of this
especial theme is not Shakspeare the greatest of all poets — nay, is he
not unique among them all? And it is this very theme that is proposed by
Bacon as the chief problem of moral philosophy. He blames Aristotle for
treating of the passions in his rhetoric rather than his ethics; for
regarding the artificial means of exciting them rather than their
natural history. It is to the natural history of the human passions that
Bacon directs the attention of philosophy. He does not find any
knowledge of them among the sciences of his time. “The poets and writers
of histories,” he says, “are the best doctors of this knowledge; where
we may find painted forth with great life how passions are kindled and
incited; and how pacified and refrained; and how again contained from
act and further degree; how they disclose themselves; how they work; how
they vary; how they gather and fortify; how they are inwrapped one
within another; and how they do fight and encounter one with another;
and other the like particularities.”51 Such a lively description is
required by Bacon from moral philosophy. That is to say, he desired
nothing less than a natural history of the passions — the very thing
that Shakspeare has produced. Indeed, what poet could have excelled
Shakspeare in this respect? Who, to use a Baconian expression, could
have depicted man and all his passions more ad vivum? According to
Bacon, the poets and historians give us copies of characters; and the
outlines of these images — the simple strokes that determine characters
— are the proper objects of ethical science. Just as physical science
requires a dissection of bodies, that their hidden qualities and parts
may be discovered, so should ethics penetrate the various minds of men,
in order to find out the eternal basis of them all. And not only this
foundation, but likewise those external conditions which give a stamp to
human character — all those peculiarities that “are imposed upon the
mind by the sex, by the age, by the region, by health and sickness, by
beauty and deformity, and the like, which are inherent and not external;
and, again, those which are caused by external fortune”52 — should come
within the scope of ethical philosophy. In a word, Bacon would have man
studied in his individuality as a product of nature and history, in
every respect determined by natural and historical influences, by
internal and external conditions. And exactly in the same spirit has
Shakespeare understood man and his destiny; regarding character as the
result of a certain natural temperament and a certain historical
position, and destiny as a result of character.</p>
