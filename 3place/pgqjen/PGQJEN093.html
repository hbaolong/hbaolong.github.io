<ol type="1">
<li><p>Now I proceed to those errors and vanities which have intervened
amongst the studies themselves of the learned, which is that which is
principal and proper to the present argument; wherein my purpose is not
to make a justification of the errors, but by a censure and separation
of the errors to make a justification of that which is good and sound,
and to deliver that from the aspersion of the other. For we see that it
is the manner of men to scandalise and deprave that which retaineth the
state and virtue, by taking advantage upon that which is corrupt and
degenerate, as the heathens in the primitive Church used to blemish and
taint the Christians with the faults and corruptions of heretics. But
nevertheless I have no meaning at this time to make any exact
animadversion of the errors and impediments in matters of learning,
which are more secret and remote from vulgar opinion, but only to speak
unto such as do fall under or near unto a popular observation.</p></li>
<li><p>There be therefore chiefly three vanities in studies, whereby
learning hath been most traduced. For those things we do esteem vain
which are either false or frivolous, those which either have no truth or
no use; and those persons we esteem vain which are either credulous or
curious; and curiosity is either in matter or words: so that in reason
as well as in experience there fall out to be these three distempers (as
I may term them) of learning — the first, fantastical learning; the
second, contentious learning; and the last, delicate learning; vain
imaginations, vain altercations, and vain affectations; and with the
last I will begin. Martin Luther, conducted, no doubt, by a higher
Providence, but in discourse of reason, finding what a province he had
undertaken against the Bishop of Rome and the degenerate traditions of
the Church, and finding his own solitude, being in nowise aided by the
opinions of his own time, was enforced to awake all antiquity, and to
call former times to his succours to make a party against the present
time. So that the ancient authors, both in divinity and in humanity,
which had long time slept in libraries, began generally to be read and
revolved. This, by consequence, did draw on a necessity of a more
exquisite travail in the languages original, wherein those authors did
write, for the better understanding of those authors, and the better
advantage of pressing and applying their words. And thereof grew, again,
a delight in their manner of style and phrase, and an admiration of that
kind of writing, which was much furthered and precipitated by the enmity
and opposition that the propounders of those primitive but seeming new
opinions had against the schoolmen, who were generally of the contrary
part, and whose writings were altogether in a differing style and form;
taking liberty to coin and frame new terms of art to express their own
sense, and to avoid circuit of speech, without regard to the pureness,
pleasantness, and (as I may call it) lawfulness of the phrase or word.
And again, because the great labour then was with the people (of whom
the Pharisees were wont to say, Execrabilis ista turba, quae non novit
legem), for the winning and persuading of them, there grew of necessity
in chief price and request eloquence and variety of discourse, as the
fittest and forciblest access into the capacity of the vulgar sort; so
that these four causes concurring — the admiration of ancient authors,
the hate of the schoolmen, the exact study of languages, and the
efficacy of preaching — did bring in an affectionate study of eloquence
and copy of speech, which then began to flourish. This grew speedily to
an excess; for men began to hunt more after words than matter — more
after the choiceness of the phrase, and the round and clean composition
of the sentence, and the sweet falling of the clauses, and the varying
and illustration of their works with tropes and figures, than after the
weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of
invention, or depth of judgment. Then grew the flowing and watery vein
of Osorius, the Portugal bishop, to be in price. Then did Sturmius spend
such infinite and curious pains upon Cicero the Orator and Hermogenes
the Rhetorician, besides his own books of Periods and Imitation, and the
like. Then did Car of Cambridge and Ascham with their lectures and
writings almost deify Cicero and Demosthenes, and allure all young men
that were studious unto that delicate and polished kind of learning.
Then did Erasmus take occasion to make the scoffing echo, Decem annos
consuumpsi in legendo Cicerone; and the echo answered in Greek, Θνε,
Asine. Then grew the learning of the schoolmen to be utterly despised as
barbarous. In sum, the whole inclination and bent of those times was
rather towards copy than weight.</p></li>
<li><p>Here therefore [is] the first distemper of learning, when men
study words and not matter; whereof, though I have represented an
example of late times, yet it hath been and will be secundum majus et
minus in all time. And how is it possible but this should have an
operation to discredit learning, even with vulgar capacities, when they
see learned men’s works like the first letter of a patent or limited
book, which though it hath large flourishes, yet it is but a letter? It
seems to me that Pygmalion’s frenzy is a good emblem or portraiture of
this vanity; for words are but the images of matter, and except they
have life of reason and invention, to fall in love with them is all one
as to fall in love with a picture.</p></li>
<li><p>But yet notwithstanding it is a thing not hastily to be
condemned, to clothe and adorn the obscurity even of philosophy itself
with sensible and plausible elocution. For hereof we have great examples
in Xenophon, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, and of Plato also in some degree;
and hereof likewise there is great use, for surely, to the severe
inquisition of truth and the deep progress into philosophy, it is some
hindrance because it is too early satisfactory to the mind of man, and
quencheth the desire of further search before we come to a just period.
But then if a man be to have any use of such knowledge in civil
occasions, of conference, counsel, persuasion, discourse, or the like,
then shall he find it prepared to his hands in those authors which write
in that manner. But the excess of this is so justly contemptible, that
as Hercules, when he saw the image of Adonis, Venus’ minion, in a
temple, said in disdain, Nil sacri es; so there is none of Hercules’
followers in learning — that is, the more severe and laborious sort of
inquirers into truth — but will despise those delicacies and
affectations, as indeed capable of no divineness. And thus much of the
first disease or distemper of learning.</p></li>
<li><p>The second which followeth is in nature worse than the former:
for as substance of matter is better than beauty of words, so
contrariwise vain matter is worse than vain words: wherein it seemeth
the reprehension of St. Paul was not only proper for those times, but
prophetical for the times following; and not only respective to
divinity, but extensive to all knowledge: Devita profanas vocum
novitates, et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae. For he assigneth two
marks and badges of suspected and falsified science: the one, the
novelty and strangeness of terms; the other, the strictness of
positions, which of necessity doth induce oppositions, and so questions
and altercations. Surely, like as many substances in nature which are
solid do putrefy and corrupt into worms; — so it is the property of good
and sound knowledge to putrefy and dissolve into a number of subtle,
idle, unwholesome, and (as I may term them) vermiculate questions, which
have indeed a kind of quickness and life of spirit, but no soundness of
matter or goodness of quality. This kind of degenerate learning did
chiefly reign amongst the schoolmen, who having sharp and strong wits,
and abundance of leisure, and small variety of reading, but their wits
being shut up in the cells of a few authors (chiefly Aristotle their
dictator) as their persons were shut up in the cells of monasteries and
colleges, and knowing little history, either of nature or time, did out
of no great quantity of matter and infinite agitation of wit spin out
unto us those laborious webs of learning which are extant in their
books. For the wit and mind of man, if it work upon matter, which is the
contemplation of the creatures of God, worketh according to the stuff
and is limited thereby; but if it work upon itself, as the spider
worketh his web, then it is endless, and brings forth indeed cobwebs of
learning, admirable for the fineness of thread and work, but of no
substance or profit.</p></li>
<li><p>This same unprofitable subtility or curiosity is of two sorts:
either in the subject itself that they handle, when it is a fruitless
speculation or controversy (whereof there are no small number both in
divinity and philosophy), or in the manner or method of handling of a
knowledge, which amongst them was this — upon every particular position
or assertion to frame objections, and to those objections, solutions;
which solutions were for the most part not confutations, but
distinctions: whereas indeed the strength of all sciences is, as the
strength of the old man’s faggot, in the bond. For the harmony of a
science, supporting each part the other, is and ought to be the true and
brief confutation and suppression of all the smaller sort of objections.
But, on the other side, if you take out every axiom, as the sticks of
the faggot, one by one, you may quarrel with them and bend them and
break them at your pleasure: so that, as was said of Seneca, Verborum
minutiis rerum frangit pondera, so a man may truly say of the schoolmen,
Quaestionum minutiis scientiarum frangunt soliditatem. For were it not
better for a man in fair room to set up one great light, or branching
candlestick of lights, than to go about with a small watch-candle into
every corner? And such is their method, that rests not so much upon
evidence of truth proved by arguments, authorities, similitudes,
examples, as upon particular confutations and solutions of every
scruple, cavillation, and objection; breeding for the most part one
question as fast as it solveth another; even as in the former
resemblance, when you carry the light into one corner, you darken the
rest; so that the fable and fiction of Scylla seemeth to be a lively
image of this kind of philosophy or knowledge; which was transformed
into a comely virgin for the upper parts; but then</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Candida succinctam la — trantibus inguina monstris:</p>
<p>so the generalities of the schoolmen are for a while good and
proportionable; but then when you descend into their distinctions and
decisions, instead of a fruitful womb for the use and benefit of man’s
life, they end in monstrous altercations and barking questions. So as it
is not possible but this quality of knowledge must fall under popular
contempt, the people being apt to contemn truths upon occasion of
controversies and altercations, and to think they are all out of their
way which never meet; and when they see such digladiation about
subtleties, and matters of no use or moment, they easily fall upon that
judgment of Dionysius of Syracusa, Verba ista sunt senum otiosorum.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Notwithstanding, certain it is that if those schoolmen to their
great thirst of truth and unwearied travail of wit had joined variety
and universality of reading and contemplation, they had proved excellent
lights, to the great advancement of all learning and knowledge; but as
they are, they are great undertakers indeed, and fierce with dark
keeping. But as in the inquiry of the divine truth, their pride inclined
to leave the oracle of God’s word, and to vanish in the mixture of their
own inventions; so in the inquisition of nature, they ever left the
oracle of God’s works, and adored the deceiving and deformed images
which the unequal mirror of their own minds, or a few received authors
or principles, did represent unto them. And thus much for the second
disease of learning.</p></li>
<li><p>For the third vice or disease of learning, which concerneth
deceit or untruth, it is of all the rest the foulest; as that which doth
destroy the essential form of knowledge, which is nothing but a
representation of truth: for the truth of being and the truth of knowing
are one, differing no more than the direct beam and the beam reflected.
This vice therefore brancheth itself into two sorts; delight in
deceiving and aptness to be deceived; imposture and credulity; which,
although they appear to be of a diverse nature, the one seeming to
proceed of cunning and the other of simplicity, yet certainly they do
for the most part concur: for, as the verse noteth —</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Percontatorem fugito, nam garrulus idem est,”</p>
<p>an inquisitive man is a prattler; so upon the like reason a credulous
man is a deceiver: as we see it in fame, that he that will easily
believe rumours will as easily augment rumours and add somewhat to them
of his own; which Tacitus wisely noteth, when he saith, Fingunt simul
creduntque: so great an affinity hath fiction and belief.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>This facility of credit and accepting or admitting things weakly
authorised or warranted is of two kinds according to the subject: for it
is either a belief of history, or, as the lawyers speak, matter of fact;
or else of matter of art and opinion. As to the former, we see the
experience and inconvenience of this error in ecclesiastical history;
which hath too easily received and registered reports and narrations of
miracles wrought by martyrs, hermits, or monks of the desert, and other
holy men, and their relics, shrines, chapels and images: which though
they had a passage for a time by the ignorance of the people, the
superstitious simplicity of some and the politic toleration of others
holding them but as divine poesies, yet after a period of time, when the
mist began to clear up, they grew to be esteemed but as old wives’
fables, impostures of the clergy, illusions of spirits, and badges of
Antichrist, to the great scandal and detriment of religion.</p></li>
<li><p>So in natural history, we see there hath not been that choice and
judgment used as ought to have been; as may appear in the writings of
Plinius, Cardanus, Albertus, and divers of the Arabians, being fraught
with much fabulous matter, a great part not only untried, but
notoriously untrue, to the great derogation of the credit of natural
philosophy with the grave and sober kind of wits: wherein the wisdom and
integrity of Aristotle is worthy to be observed, that, having made so
diligent and exquisite a history of living creatures, hath mingled it
sparingly with any vain or feigned matter; and yet on the other side
hath cast all prodigious narrations, which he thought worthy the
recording, into one book, excellently discerning that matter of manifest
truth, such whereupon observation and rule was to be built, was not to
be mingled or weakened with matter of doubtful credit; and yet again,
that rarities and reports that seem uncredible are not to be suppressed
or denied to the memory of men.</p></li>
<li><p>And as for the facility of credit which is yielded to arts and
opinions, it is likewise of two kinds; either when too much belief is
attributed to the arts themselves, or to certain authors in any art. The
sciences themselves, which have had better intelligence and confederacy
with the imagination of man than with his reason, are three in number:
astrology, natural magic, and alchemy; of which sciences, nevertheless,
the ends or pretences are noble. For astrology pretendeth to discover
that correspondence or concatenation which is between the superior globe
and the inferior; natural magic pretendeth to call and reduce natural
philosophy from variety of speculations to the magnitude of works; and
alchemy pretendeth to make separation of all the unlike parts of bodies
which in mixtures of natures are incorporate. But the derivations and
prosecutions to these ends, both in the theories and in the practices,
are full of error and vanity; which the great professors themselves have
sought to veil over and conceal by enigmatical writings, and referring
themselves to auricular traditions and such other devices, to save the
credit of impostures. And yet surely to alchemy this right is due, that
it may be compared to the husbandman whereof AEsop makes the fable;
that, when he died, told his sons that he had left unto them gold buried
underground in his vineyard; and they digged over all the ground, and
gold they found none; but by reason of their stirring and digging the
mould about the roots of their vines, they had a great vintage the year
following: so assuredly the search and stir to make gold hath brought to
light a great number of good and fruitful inventions and experiments, as
well for the disclosing of nature as for the use of man’s life.</p></li>
<li><p>And as for the overmuch credit that hath been given unto authors
in sciences, in making them dictators, that their words should stand,
and not consuls, to give advice; the damage is infinite that sciences
have received thereby, as the principal cause that hath kept them low at
a stay without growth or advancement. For hence it hath come, that in
arts mechanical the first deviser comes shortest, and time addeth and
perfecteth; but in sciences the first author goeth furthest, and time
leeseth and corrupteth. So we see artillery, sailing, printing, and the
like, were grossly managed at the first, and by time accommodated and
refined; but contrariwise, the philosophies and sciences of Aristotle,
Plato, Democritus, Hippocrates, Euclides, Archimedes, of most vigour at
the first, and by time degenerate and imbased: whereof the reason is no
other, but that in the former many wits and industries have contributed
in one; and in the latter many wits and industries have been spent about
the wit of some one, whom many times they have rather depraved than
illustrated; for, as water will not ascend higher than the level of the
first spring-head from whence it descendeth, so knowledge derived from
Aristotle, and exempted from liberty of examination, will not rise again
higher than the knowledge of Aristotle. And, therefore, although the
position be good, Oportet discentem credere, yet it must be coupled with
this, Oportet edoctum judicare; for disciples do owe unto masters only a
temporary belief and a suspension of their own judgment till they be
fully instructed, and not an absolute resignation or perpetual
captivity; and therefore, to conclude this point, I will say no more,
but so let great authors have their due, as time, which is the author of
authors, be not deprived of his due — which is, further and further to
discover truth. Thus have I gone over these three diseases of learning;
besides the which there are some other rather peccant humours than
formed diseases, which, nevertheless, are not so secret and intrinsic,
but that they fall under a popular observation and traducement, and,
therefore, are not to be passed over.</p></li>
