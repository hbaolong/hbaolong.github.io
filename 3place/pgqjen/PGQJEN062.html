<h4 id="preface-by-robert-leslie-ellis">Preface by Robert Leslie
Ellis</h4>
<p>The following fragments of a great work on the Interpretation of
Nature were first published in Stephens’s Letters and Remains [1734].
They consist partly of detached passages, and partly of an epitome of
twelve chapters of the first book of the proposed work. The detached
passages contain the first, sixth, and eighth chapters, and portions of
the fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and sixteenth. The
epitome contains an account of the contents of all the chapters from the
twelfth to the twenty-sixth inclusive, omitting the twentieth,
twentythird, and twenty-fourth. Thus the sixteenth chapter is mentioned
both in the epitome and among the detached passages, and we are thus
enabled to see that the two portions of the following tract belong to
the same work, as it appears from both that the sixteenth chapter was to
treat of the doctrine of idola.</p>
<p>It is impossible to ascertain the motive which determined Bacon to
give to the supposed author the name of Valerius Terminus, or to his
commentator, of whose annotations we have no remains, that of Hermes
Stella. It may be conjectured that by the name Terminus he intended to
intimate that the new philosophy would put an end to the wandering of
mankind in search of truth, that it would be the TERMINUS AD QUEM in
which when it was once attained the mind would finally acquiesce.</p>
<p>Again, the obscurity of the text was to be in some measure removed by
the annotations of Stella; not however wholly, for Bacon in the epitome
of the eighteenth chapter commends the manner of publishing knowledge
“whereby it shall not be to the capacity nor taste of all, but shall as
it were single and adopt his reader.” Stella was therefore to throw a
kind of starlight on the subject, enough to prevent the student’s losing
his way, but not much more.</p>
<p>However this may be, the tract is undoubtedly obscure, partly from
the style in which it is written, and partly from its being only a
fragment. It is at the same time full of interest, inasmuch as it is the
earliest type of the INSTAURATIO . . .</p>
<p>Note to Preface by James Spedding</p>
<p>The manuscript from which Robert Stephens printed these fragments was
found among some loose papers placed in his hands by the Earl of Oxford,
and is now in the British Museum; Harl. manuscripts 6462. It is a thin
paper volume of the quarto size, written in the hand of one of Bacon’s
servants, with corrections, erasures, and interlineations in his
own.</p>
<p>The chapters of which it consists are both imperfect in themselves
(all but three) — some breaking off abruptly, others being little more
than tables of contents — and imperfect in their connexion with each
other; so much so as to suggest the idea of a number of separate papers
loosely put together. But it was not so (and the fact is important) that
the volume itself was actually made up. However they came together, they
are here fairly and consecutively copied out. Though it be a collection
of fragments therefore, it is such a collection as Bacon thought worthy
not only of being preserved, but of being transcribed into a volume; and
a particular account of it will not be out of place.</p>
<p>The contents of the manuscript before Bacon touched it may be thus
described.</p>
<p>A titlepage, on which is written “VALERIUS TERMINUS of the
Interpretation of Nature, with the annotations of HERMES STELLA.”</p>
<p>“Chapter I. Of the limits and end of knowledge;” with a running
title, “Of the Interpretation of Nature.”</p>
<p>“The chapter immediately following the Inventory; being the 11th in
order.”</p>
<p>“A part of the 9th chapter, immediately precedent to the Inventory,
and inducing the same.”</p>
<p>“The Inventory, or an enumeration and view of inventions already
discovered and in use, together with a note of the wants and the nature
of the supplies; being the 10th chapter, and this a fragment only of the
same.”</p>
<p>Part of a chapter, not numbered, “Of the internal and profound errors
and superstitions in the nature of the mind, and of the four sorts of
Idols or fictions which offer themselves to the understanding in the
inquisition of knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Of the impediments of knowledge; being the third chapter, the
preface only of it.”</p>
<p>“Of the impediments which have been in the times and in diversion of
wits; being the fourth chapter.”</p>
<p>“Of the impediments of knowledge for want of a true succession of
wits, and that hitherto the length of one man’s life hath been the
greatest measure of knowledge; being the fifth chapter.”</p>
<p>“That the pretended succession of wits hath been evil placed,
forasmuch as after variety of sects and opinions the most popular and
not the truest prevaileth and weareth out the rest; being the sixth
chapter.”</p>
<p>“Of the impediments of knowledge in handling it by parts, and in
slipping off particular sciences from the root and stock of universal
knowledge; being the seventh chapter.”</p>
<p>“That the end and scope of knowledge hath been generally mistaken,
and that men were never well advised what it was they sought” (part of a
chapter not numbered).</p>
<p>“An abridgment of divers chapters of the first book;” namely, the
l2th, 13th, and 14th, (over which is a running title “Of active
knowledge;”) and (without any running title) the 15th, 16th, 17th,
18th], 19th, 21st, 22nd, 25th, and 26th. These abridgments have no
headings; and at the end is written, “The end of the Abridgment of the
first book of the Interpretation of Nature.”</p>
<p>Such was the arrangement of the manuscript as the transcriber left
it; which I have thought worth preserving, because I seem to see traces
in it of two separate stages in the developement of the work; the order
of the chapters as they are transcribed being probably the same in which
Bacon wrote them; and the numbers inserted at the end of the headings
indicating the order in which, when he placed them in the transcriber’s
hands, it was his intention to arrange them; and because it proves at
any rate that at that time the design of the whole book was clearly laid
out in his mind.</p>
<p>There is nothing, unfortunately, to fix the DATE of the transcript,
unless it be implied in certain astronomical or astrological symbols
written on the blank outside of the volume; in which the figures 1603
occur. This may possibly be the transcriber’s note of the time when he
finished his work; for which (but for one circumstance which I shall
mention presently) I should think the year 1603 is likely a date as any;
for we know from a letter of Bacon’s, dated 3rd July 1603, that he had
at that time resolved “to meddle as little as possible in the King’s
causes,” and to “put his ambition wholly upon his pen;” and we know from
the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING that in 1605 he was engaged upon a work
entitled “The Interpretation of Nature:” to which I may add that there
is in the Lambeth Library a copy of a letter from Bacon to Lord
Kinlosse, dated 25th March, 1603, and written in the same hand as this
manuscript.</p>
<p>Bacon’s corrections, if I may judge from the character of the
handwriting, were inserted a little later; for it is a fact that about
the beginning of James’s reign his writing underwent a remarkable
change, from the hurried Saxon hand full of large sweeping curves and
with letters imperfectly formed and connected, which he wrote in
Elizabeth’s time, to a small, neat, light, and compact one, formed more
upon the Italian model which was then coming into fashion; and when
these corrections were made it is evident that this new character had
become natural to him and easy. It is of course impossible to fix the
precise date of such a change — the more so because his autographs of
this period are very scarce — but whenever it was that he corrected this
manuscript, it is evident that he then considered it worthy of careful
revision. He has not merely inserted a sentence here and there, altered
the numbers of the chapters, and added words to the headings in order to
make the description more exact; but he has taken the trouble to add the
running title wherever it was wanting, thus writing the words “of the
Interpretation of Nature” at full lengths not less than eighteen times
over; and upon the blank space of the titlepage he has written out a
complete table of contents. In short, if he had been preparing the
manuscript for the press or for a fresh transcript, he could not have
done it more completely or carefully — only that he has given no
directions for altering the order of the chapters so as to make it
correspond with the numbers. And hence I infer that up to the time when
he made these corrections, this was the form of the great work on which
he was engaged: it was a work concerning the Interpretation of Nature;
which was to begin where the NOVUM ORGANUM begins; and of which the
first book was to include all the preliminary considerations preparatory
to the exposition of the formula.</p>
<p>I place this fragment here in deference to Mr. Ellis’s decided
opinion that it was written before the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING. The
positive ground indeed which he alleges in support of that conclusion I
am obliged to set aside, as founded, I think, upon a misapprehension;
and the supposition that no part of it was written later involves a
difficulty which I cannot yet get over to my own satisfaction. But that
the body of it was written earlier I see no reason to doubt; and if so,
this is its proper place.</p>
<p>The particular point on which I venture to disagree with Mr. Ellis I
have stated in a note upon his preface to the NOVUM ORGANUM, promising
at the same time a fuller explanation of the grounds of my own
conclusion, which I will now give.</p>
<p>The question is, whether the “Inventory” in the 10th chapter of
VALERIUS TERMINUS was to have exhibited a general survey of the state of
knowledge corresponding with that which fills the second book of the
ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING. I think not.</p>
<p>It is true indeed that the title of that 10th chapter — namely, “The
Inventory, or an enumeration and view of inventions already discovered
and in use, with a note of the wants and the nature of the supplies” —
has at first sight a considerable resemblance to the description of the
contents of the second book of the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING— namely, “A
general and faithful perambulation of learning, with an inquiry what
parts thereof lie fresh and waste, and not improved and converted by the
industry of Man; . . . wherein nevertheless my purpose is at this time
to note only omissions and deficiencies, and not to make any
redargutions of errors,” and so on. But an “enumeration of INVENTIONS”
is not the same thing as “a perambulation of LEARNING;” and it will be
found upon closer examination that the “Inventory” spoken of in VALERIUS
TERMINUS does really correspond to one, and one only, of the fiftyone
Desiderata set down at the end of the DE AUGMENTIS; viz. that
INVENTARIUM OPUM HUMANARUM, which was to be an appendix to the MAGIA
NATURALIS. See DE AUG. iii. 5. This will appear clearly by comparing the
descriptions of the two.</p>
<p>In the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING Bacon tells us that there are two
points of much purpose pertaining to the department of Natural Magic:
the first of which is, “That there be made a calendar resembling an
Inventory of the ESTATE OF MAN, containing ALL THE INVENTIONS, BEING THE
WORKS OR FRUITS OF NATURE OR ART, which are now extant AND OF WHICH MAN
IS ALREADY POSSESSED; out of which doth naturally result a note what
things are yet held impossible or not invented; which calendar will be
the more artificial and serviceable if to every reputed impossibility
you add what thing is extant which cometh the nearest in degree to that
impossibility: to the end that by these optatives and essentials man’s
inquiry may be the more awake in deducing direction of works from the
speculation of causes.”</p>
<p>The Inventory which was to have been inserted in the 10th chapter of
VALERIUS TERMINUS is thus introduced:—“The plainest method and most
directly pertinent to this intention will be to make distribution of
SCIENCES, ARTS, INVENTIONS, WORKS, and their portions, ACCORDING TO THE
USE AND TRIBUTE WHICH THEY YIELD AND RENDER TO THE CONDITION OF MAN’S
LIFE; and under those several uses, being as several offices of
provisions, to charge and tax what may be reasonably exacted or
demanded, . . . and then upon those charges and taxations to distinguish
and present as it were in several columns what is extant and already
found, and what is DEFECTIVE AND FURTHER TO BE PROVIDED. Of which
provisions because in many of them, after the manner of slothful and
faulty accomptants, it will be returned by way of excuse that no such
are to be had, it will be fit to give some light OF THE NATURE OF THE
SUPPLIES; whereby it will evidently appear that they are to be compassed
and procured.” And that the calendar was to deal, not with knowledge in
general, but only with arts and sciences of invention in its more
restricted sense — the PARS OPERATIVA DE NATURA (DE AUG. iii. 5.)—
appears no less clearly from the opening of the 11th chapter, which was
designed immediately to follow the “Inventory.” “It appeareth then what
is now in proposition, not by general circumlocution but by particular
note. No former philosophy,” etc. etc. “but the revealing and
discovering of NEW INVENTIONS AND OPERATIONS, . . . the nature and kinds
of which inventions HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED as they could be discovered,”
etc. If further evidence were required of the exact resemblance between
the Inventory of VALERIUS TERMINUS and the Inventarium of the
ADVANCEMENT and the DE AUGMENTIS, I might quote the end of the 9th
chapter, where the particular expressions correspond, if possible, more
closely still. But I presume that the passages which I have given are
enough; and that the opinion which I have elsewhere expressed as to the
origin of the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING— namely, that the writing of it
was a by-thought and no part of the work on the Interpretation of Nature
as originally designed — will not be considered inconsistent with the
evidence afforded by these fragments.</p>
<p>That the VALERIUS TERMINUS was composed before the ADVANCEMENT,
though a conclusion not deducible from the Inventory, is nevertheless
probable: but to suppose that it was so composed EXACTLY IN ITS PRESENT
FORM, involves, as I said, a difficulty; which I will now state. The
point is interesting, as bearing directly upon the developement in
Bacon’s mind of the doctrine of Idols; concerning which see preface to
NOVUM ORGANUM, note C. But I have to deal with it here merely as bearing
upon the probable date of this fragment.</p>
<p>In treating of the department of Logic in the ADVANCEMENT, Bacon
notices as altogether wanting “the particular elenches or cautions
against three false appearances” or fallacies by which the mind of man
is beset: the “caution” of which, he says, “doth extremely import the
true conduct of human judgment.” These false appearances he describes,
though he does not give their names; and they correspond respectively to
what he afterwards called the Idols of the Tribe, the Cave, and the
Forum. But he makes no mention of the fourth; namely, the Idols of the
Theatre. Now in VALERIUS TERMINUS we find two separate passages in which
the Idols are mentioned; and in both all four are enumerated, and all by
name; though what he afterwards called Idols of the Forum, he there
calls Idols of the Palace; and it seems to me very unlikely that, if
when he wrote the ADVANCEMENT he had already formed that classification
he should have omitted all mention of the Idols of the Theatre; for
though it is true that that was not the place to discuss them, and
therefore in the corresponding passage of the DE AUGMENTIS they are
noticed as to be passed by “for the present,” yet they are noticed by
name, and in all Bacon’s later writings the confutation of them holds a
very prominent place.</p>
<p>To me the most probable explanation of the fact is this. I have
already shown that between the composition and the transcription of
these fragments the design of the work appears to have undergone a
considerable change; the order of the chapters being entirely altered.
We have only to suppose therefore that they were composed before the
ADVANCEMENT and transcribed after, and that in preparing them for the
transcriber Bacon made the same kind of alterations in the originals
which he afterwards made upon the transcript, and the difficulty
disappears. Nothing would be easier than to correct “three” into “four,”
and insert “the Idols of the Theatre” at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>And this reminds me (since I shall have so much to do with these
questions of date) to suggest a general caution with regard to them all;
namely, that in the case of fragments like these, the comparison of
isolated passages can hardly ever be relied upon for evidence of the
date or order of composition, or of the progressive developement of the
writer’s views; and for this simple reason — we can never be sure that
the passages as they now stand formed part of the original writing. The
copy of the fragment which we have may be (as there is reason to believe
this was) a transcript from several loose papers, written at different
periods and containing alterations or additions made from time to time.
We may know perhaps that when Bacon published the ADVANCEMCNT OF
LEARNING he was ignorant of some fact with which he afterwards became
acquainted; we may find in one of these fragments — say the TEMPORIS
PARTUS MASCULUS— a passage implying acquaintance with that fact. Does it
follow that the TEMPORIS PARTUS MASCULUS was written after the
ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING? No; for in looking over the manuscript long
after it was written, he may have observed and corrected the error. And
we cannot conclude that he at the same time altered the whole
composition so as to bring it into accordance with the views he then
held; for that might be too long a work. He may have inserted a
particular correction, but meant to rewrite the whole; and if so, in
spite of the later date indicated by that particular passage, the body
of the work would still represent a stage in his opinions anterior to
the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING.</p>
<p>I have felt some doubt whether in printing this fragment, I should
follow the example of Stephens, who gave it exactly as he found it; or
that of later editors, who have altered the order of the chapters so as
to make it agree with the numbers. The latter plan will perhaps, upon
the whole, be the more convenient. There can he little doubt that the
numbers of the chapters indicate the order in which Bacon meant them to
be read; and if any one wishes to compare it with the order in which
they seem to have been written, he has only to look at Bacon’s table of
contents, which was made with reference to the transcript, and which I
give unaltered, except as to the spelling.</p>
