<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>That the state of knowledge is not prosperous nor greatly advancing,
and that a way must be opened for the human understanding entirely
different from any hitherto known, and other helps provided, in order
that the mind may exercise over the nature of things the authority which
properly belongs to it.</p>
<p>It seems to me that men do not rightly understand either their store
or their strength, but overrate the one and underrate the other. Hence
it follows that either from an extravagant estimate of the value of the
arts which they possess they seek no further, or else from too mean an
estimate of their own powers they spend their strength in small matters
and never put it fairly to the trial in those which go to the main.
These are as the pillars of fate set in the path of knowledge, for men
have neither desire nor hope to encourage them to penetrate further. And
since opinion of store is one of the chief causes of want, and
satisfaction with the present induces neglect of provision for the
future, it becomes a thing not only useful, but absolutely necessary,
that the excess of honor and admiration with which our existing stock of
inventions is regarded be in the very entrance and threshold of the
work, and that frankly and without circumlocution stripped off, and men
be duly warned not to exaggerate or make too much of them. For let a man
look carefully into all that variety of books with which the arts and
sciences abound, he will find everywhere endless repetitions of the same
thing, varying in the method of treatment, but not new in substance,
insomuch that the whole stock, numerous as it appears at first view,
proves on examination to be but scanty. And for its value and utility it
must be plainly avowed that that wisdom which we have derived
principally from the Greeks is but like the boyhood of knowledge, and
has the characteristic property of boys: it can talk, but it cannot
generate, for it is fruitful of controversies but barren of works. So
that the state of learning as it now is appears to be represented to the
life in the old fable of Scylla, who had the head and face of a virgin,
but her womb was hung round with barking monsters, from which she could
not be delivered. For in like manner the sciences to which we are
accustomed have certain general positions which are specious and
flattering; but as soon as they come to particulars, which are as the
parts of generation, when they should produce fruit and works, then
arise contentions and barking disputations, which are the end of the
matter and all the issue they can yield. Observe also, that if sciences
of this kind had any life in them, that could never have come to pass
which has been the case now for many ages — that they stand almost at a
stay, without receiving any augmentations worthy of the human race,
insomuch that many times not only what was asserted once is asserted
still, but what was a question once is a question still, and instead of
being resolved by discussion is only fixed and fed; and all the
tradition and succession of schools is still a succession of masters and
scholars, not of inventors and those who bring to further perfection the
things invented. In the mechanical arts we do not find it so; they, on
the contrary, as having in them some breath of life, are continually
growing and becoming more perfect. As originally invented they are
commonly rude, clumsy, and shapeless; afterwards they acquire new powers
and more commodious arrangements and constructions, in so far that men
shall sooner leave the study and pursuit of them and turn to something
else than they arrive at the ultimate perfection of which they are
capable. Philosophy and the intellectual sciences, on the contrary,
stand like statues, worshipped and celebrated, but not moved or
advanced. Nay, they sometimes flourish most in the hands of the first
author, and afterwards degenerate. For when men have once made over
their judgments to others’ keeping, and (like those senators whom they
called Pedarii) have agreed to support some one person’s opinion, from
that time they make no enlargement of the sciences themselves, but fall
to the servile office of embellishing certain individual authors and
increasing their retinue. And let it not be said that the sciences have
been growing gradually till they have at last reached their full
stature, and so (their course being completed) have settled in the works
of a few writers; and that there being now no room for the invention of
better, all that remains is to embellish and cultivate those things
which have been invented already. Would it were so! But the truth is
that this appropriating of the sciences has its origin in nothing better
than the confidence of a few persons and the sloth and indolence of the
rest. For after the sciences had been in several perhaps cultivated and
handled diligently, there has risen up some man of bold disposition, and
famous for methods and short ways which people like, who has in
appearance reduced them to an art, while he has in fact only spoiled all
that the others had done. And yet this is what posterity likes, because
it makes the work short and easy, and saves further inquiry, of which
they are weary and impatient. And if any one take this general
acquiescence and consent for an argument of weight, as being the
judgment of Time, let me tell him that the reasoning on which he relies
is most fallacious and weak. For, first, we are far from knowing all
that in the matter of sciences and arts has in various ages and places
been brought to light and published, much less all that has been by
private persons secretly attempted and stirred; so neither the births
nor the miscarriages of Time are entered in our records. Nor, secondly,
is the consent itself and the time it has continued a consideration of
much worth. For however various are the forms of civil polities, there
is but one form of polity in the sciences; and that always has been and
always will be popular. Now the doctrines which find most favor with the
populace are those which are either contentious and pugnacious, or
specious and empty — such, I say, as either entangle assent or tickle
it. And therefore no doubt the greatest wits in each successive age have
been forced out of their own course: men of capacity and intellect above
the vulgar having been fain, for reputation’s sake, to bow to the
judgment of the time and the multitude; and thus if any contemplations
of a higher order took light anywhere, they were presently blown out by
the winds of vulgar opinions. So that Time is like a river which has
brought down to us things light and puffed up, while those which are
weighty and solid have sunk. Nay, those very authors who have usurped a
kind of dictatorship in the sciences and taken upon them to lay down the
law with such confidence, yet when from time to time they come to
themselves again, they fall to complaints of the subtlety of nature, the
hiding places of truth, the obscurity of things, the entanglement of
causes, the weakness of the human mind; wherein nevertheless they show
themselves never the more modest, seeing that they will rather lay the
blame upon the common condition of men and nature than upon themselves.
And then whatever any art fails to attain, they ever set it down upon
the authority of that art itself as impossible of attainment; and how
can art be found guilty when it is judge in its own cause? So it is but
a device for exempting ignorance from ignominy. Now for those things
which are delivered and received, this is their condition: barren of
works, full of questions; in point of enlargement slow and languid,
carrying a show of perfection in the whole, but in the parts ill filled
up; in selection popular, and unsatisfactory even to those who propound
them; and therefore fenced round and set forth with sundry artifices.
And if there be any who have determined to make trial for themselves and
put their own strength to the work of advancing the boundaries of the
sciences, yet have they not ventured to cast themselves completely loose
from received opinions or to seek their knowledge at the fountain; but
they think they have done some great thing if they do but add and
introduce into the existing sum of science something of their own,
prudently considering with themselves that by making the addition they
can assert their liberty, while they retain the credit of modesty by
assenting to the rest. But these mediocrities and middle ways so much
praised, in deferring to opinions and customs, turn to the great
detriment of the sciences. For it is hardly possible at once to admire
an author and to go beyond him, knowledge being as water, which will not
rise above the level from which it fell. Men of this kind, therefore,
amend some things, but advance little, and improve the condition of
knowledge, but do not extend its range. Some, indeed, there have been
who have gone more boldly to work and, taking it all for an open matter
and giving their genius full play, have made a passage for themselves
and their own opinions by pulling down and demolishing former ones; and
yet all their stir has but little advanced the matter, since their aim
has been not to extend philosophy and the arts in substance and value,
but only to change doctrines and transfer the kingdom of opinions to
themselves; whereby little has indeed been gained, for though the error
be the opposite of the other, the causes of erring are the same in both.
And if there have been any who, not binding themselves either to other
men’s opinions or to their own, but loving liberty, have desired to
engage others along with themselves in search, these, though honest in
intention, have been weak in endeavor. For they have been content to
follow probable reasons and are carried round in a whirl of arguments,
and in the promiscuous liberty of search have relaxed the severity of
inquiry. There is none who has dwelt upon experience and the facts of
nature as long as is necessary. Some there are indeed who have committed
themselves to the waves of experience and almost turned mechanics, yet
these again have in their very experiments pursued a kind of wandering
inquiry, without any regular system of operations. And besides they have
mostly proposed to themselves certain petty tasks, taking it for a great
matter to work out some single discovery — a course of proceeding at
once poor in aim and unskillful in design. For no man can rightly and
successfully investigate the nature of anything in the thing itself; let
him vary his experiments as laboriously as he will, he never comes to a
resting-place, but still finds something to seek beyond. And there is
another thing to be remembered — namely, that all industry in
experimenting has begun with proposing to itself certain definite works
to be accomplished, and has pursued them with premature and unseasonable
eagerness; it has sought, I say, experiments of fruit, not experiments
of light, not imitating the divine procedure, which in its first day’s
work created light only and assigned to it one entire day, on which day
it produced no material work, but proceeded to that on the days
following. As for those who have given the first place to logic,
supposing that the surest helps to the sciences were to be found in
that, they have indeed most truly and excellently perceived that the
human intellect left to its own course is not to be trusted; but then
the remedy is altogether too weak for the disease, nor is it without
evil in itself. For the logic which is received, though it be very
properly applied to civil business and to those arts which rest in
discourse and opinion, is not nearly subtle enough to deal with nature;
and in attempting what it cannot master, has done more to establish and
perpetuate error than to open the way to truth.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, therefore, it seems that men have not been happy
hitherto either in the trust which they have placed in others or in
their own industry with regard to the sciences; especially as neither
the demonstrations nor the experiments as yet known are much to be
relied upon. But the universe to the eye of the human understanding is
framed like a labyrinth, presenting as it does on every side so many
ambiguities of way, such deceitful resemblances of objects and signs,
natures so irregular in their lines and so knotted and entangled. And
then the way is still to be made by the uncertain light of the sense,
sometimes shining out, sometimes clouded over, through the woods of
experience and particulars; while those who offer themselves for guides
are (as was said) themselves also puzzled, and increase the number of
errors and wanderers. In circumstances so difficult neither the natural
force of man’s judgment nor even any accidental felicity offers any
chance of success. No excellence of wit, no repetition of chance
experiments, can overcome such difficulties as these. Our steps must be
guided by a clue, and the whole way from the very first perception of
the senses must be laid out upon a sure plan. Not that I would be
understood to mean that nothing whatever has been done in so many ages
by so great labors. We have no reason to be ashamed of the discoveries
which have been made, and no doubt the ancients proved themselves in
everything that turns on wit and abstract meditation, wonderful men.
But, as in former ages, when men sailed only by observation of the
stars, they could indeed coast along the shores of the old continent or
cross a few small and Mediterranean seas; but before the ocean could be
traversed and the new world discovered, the use of the mariner’s needle,
as a more faithful and certain guide, had to be found out; in like
manner the discoveries which have been hitherto made in the arts and
sciences are such as might be made by practice, meditation, observation,
argumentation — for they lay near to the senses and immediately beneath
common notions; but before we can reach the remoter and more hidden
parts of nature, it is necessary that a more perfect use and application
of the human mind and intellect be introduced.</p>
<p>For my own part at least, in obedience to the everlasting love of
truth, I have committed myself to the uncertainties and difficulties and
solitudes of the ways and, relying on the divine assistance, have upheld
my mind both against the shocks and embattled ranks of opinion, and
against my own private and inward hesitations and scruples, and against
the fogs and clouds of nature, and the phantoms flitting about on every
side, in the hope of providing at last for the present and future
generations guidance more faithful and secure. Wherein if I have made
any progress, the way has been opened to me by no other means than the
true and legitimate humiliation of the human spirit. For all those who
before me have applied themselves to the invention of arts have but cast
a glance or two upon facts and examples and experience, and straightway
proceeded, as if invention were nothing more than an exercise of
thought, to invoke their own spirits to give them oracles. I, on the
contrary, dwelling purely and constantly among the facts of nature,
withdraw my intellect from them no further than may suffice to let the
images and rays of natural objects meet in a point, as they do in the
sense of vision; whence it follows that the strength and excellence of
the wit has but little to do in the matter. And the same humility which
I use in inventing I employ likewise in teaching. For I do not endeavor
either by triumphs of confutation, or pleadings of antiquity, or
assumption of authority, or even by the veil of obscurity, to invest
these inventions of mine with any majesty; which might easily be done by
one who sought to give luster to his own name rather than light to other
men’s minds. I have not sought (I say) nor do I seek either to force or
ensnare men’s judgments, but I lead them to things themselves and the
concordances of things, that they may see for themselves what they have,
what they can dispute, what they can add and contribute to the common
stock. And for myself, if in anything I have been either too credulous
or too little awake and attentive, or if I have fallen off by the way
and left the inquiry incomplete, nevertheless I so present these things
naked and open, that my errors can be marked and set aside before the
mass of knowledge be further infected by them; and it will be easy also
for others to continue and carry on my labors. And by these means I
suppose that I have established forever a true and lawful marriage
between the empirical and the rational faculty, the unkind and
ill-starred divorce and separation of which has thrown into confusion
all the affairs of the human family.</p>
<p>Wherefore, seeing that these things do not depend upon myself, at the
outset of the work I most humbly and fervently pray to God the Father,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, that remembering the sorrows of
mankind and the pilgrimage of this our life wherein we wear out days few
and evil, they will vouchsafe through my hands to endow the human family
with new mercies. This likewise I humbly pray, that things human may not
interfere with things divine, and that from the opening of the ways of
sense and the increase of natural light there may arise in our minds no
incredulity or darkness with regard to the divine mysteries, but rather
that the understanding being thereby purified and purged of fancies and
vanity, and yet not the less subject and entirely submissive to the
divine oracles, may give to faith that which is faith’s. Lastly, that
knowledge being now discharged of that venom which the serpent infused
into it, and which makes the mind of man to swell, we may not be wise
above measure and sobriety, but cultivate truth in charity.</p>
<p>And now, having said my prayers, I turn to men, to whom I have
certain salutary admonitions to offer and certain fair requests to make.
My first admonition (which was also my prayer) is that men confine the
sense within the limits of duty in respect of things divine: for the
sense is like the sun, which reveals the face of earth, but seals and
shuts up the face of heaven. My next, that in flying from this evil they
fall not into the opposite error, which they will surely do if they
think that the inquisition of nature is in any part interdicted or
forbidden. For it was not that pure and uncorrupted natural knowledge
whereby Adam gave names to the creatures according to their propriety,
which, gave occasion to the fall. It was the ambitious and proud desire
of moral knowledge to judge of good and evil, to the end that man may
revolt from God and give laws to himself, which was the form and manner
of the temptation. Whereas of the sciences which regard nature, the
divine philosopher declares that “it is the glory of God to conceal a
thing, but it is the glory of the King to find a thing out.” Even as
though the divine nature took pleasure in the innocent and kindly sport
of children playing at hide-and-seek, and vouchsafed of his kindness and
goodness to admit the human spirit for his playfellow at that game.
Lastly, I would address one general admonition to all — that they
consider what are the true ends of knowledge, and that they seek it not
either for pleasure of the mind, or for contention, or for superiority
to others, or for profit, or fame, or power, or any of these inferior
things, but for the benefit and use of life, and that they perfect and
govern it in charity. For it was from lust of power that the angels
fell, from lust of knowledge that man fell; but of charity there can be
no excess, neither did angel or man ever come in danger by it.</p>
<p>The requests I have to make are these. Of myself I say nothing; but
in behalf of the business which is in hand I entreat men to believe that
it is not an opinion to be held, but a work to be done; and to be well
assured that I am laboring to lay the foundation, not of any sect or
doctrine, but of human utility and power. Next, I ask them to deal
fairly by their own interests, and laying aside all emulations and
prejudices in favor of this or that opinion, to join in consultation for
the common good; and being now freed and guarded by the securities and
helps which I offer from the errors and impediments of the way, to come
forward themselves and take part in that which remains to be done.
Moreover, to be of good hope, nor to imagine that this Instauration of
mine is a thing infinite and beyond the power of man, when it is in fact
the true end and termination of infinite error; and seeing also that it
is by no means forgetful of the conditions of mortality and humanity
(for it does not suppose that the work can be altogether completed
within one generation, but provides for its being taken up by another);
and finally that it seeks for the sciences not arrogantly in the little
cells of human wit, but with reverence in the greater world. But it is
the empty things that are vast; things solid are most contracted and lie
in little room. And now I have only one favor more to ask (else
injustice to me may perhaps imperil the business itself) — that men will
consider well how far, upon that which I must needs assert (if I am to
be consistent with myself), they are entitled to judge and decide upon
these doctrines of mine; inasmuch as all that premature human reasoning
which anticipates inquiry, and is abstracted from the facts rashly and
sooner than is fit, is by me rejected (so far as the inquisition of
nature is concerned) as a thing uncertain, confused, and ill built up;
and I cannot be fairly asked to abide by the decision of a tribunal
which is itself on trial.</p>
<p>[Reference is to Aristotle. Cf. the editor’s Introduction.]</p>
<p>The Plan of the Great Instauration</p>
<p>The Instauration includes six Parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Divisions of the Sciences</p></li>
<li><p>The New Organon; or Directions concerning the Interpretation of
Nature</p></li>
<li><p>The Phenomena of the Universe; or a Natural and Experimental
History for the Foundation of Philosophy</p></li>
<li><p>The Ladder of the Intellect</p></li>
<li><p>The Forerunners; or Anticipations of the New Philosophy</p></li>
<li><p>The New Philosophy; or Active Science</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Arguments of the Several Parts</p>
<p>It being part of my design to set everything forth, as far as may be,
plainly and perspicuously (for nakedness of the mind is still, as
nakedness of the body once was, the companion of innocence and
simplicity), let me first explain the order and plan of the work. I
distribute it into six parts.</p>
<p>The first part exhibits a summary or general description of the
knowledge which the human race at present possesses. For I thought it
good to make some pause upon that which is received; that thereby the
old may be more easily made perfect and the new more easily approached.
And I hold the improvement of that which we have to be as much an object
as the acquisition of more. Besides which it will make me the better
listened to; for “He that is ignorant (says the proverb) receives not
the words of knowledge, unless thou first tell him that which is in his
own heart.” We will therefore make a coasting voyage along the shores of
the arts and sciences received, not without importing into them some
useful things by the way.</p>
<p>In laying out the divisions of the sciences, however, I take into
account not only things already invented and known, but likewise things
omitted which ought to be there. For there are found in the intellectual
as in the terrestrial globe waste regions as well as cultivated ones. It
is no wonder, therefore, if I am sometimes obliged to depart from the
ordinary divisions. For in adding to the total you necessarily alter the
parts and sections; and the received divisions of the sciences are
fitted only to the received sum of them as it stands now.</p>
<p>With regard to those things which I shall mark as omitted, I intend
not merely to set down a simple title or a concise argument of that
which is wanted. For as often as I have occasion to report anything as
deficient, the nature of which is at all obscure, so that men may not
perhaps easily understand what I mean or what the work is which I have
in my head, I shall always (provided it be a matter of any worth) take
care to subjoin either directions for the execution of such work, or
else a portion of the work itself executed by myself as a sample of the
whole, thus giving assistance in every case either by work or by
counsel. For if it were for the sake of my own reputation only and other
men’s interests were not concerned in it, I would not have any man think
that in such cases merely some light and vague notion has crossed my
mind, and that the things which I desire and attempt are no better than
wishes, when they are in fact things which men may certainly command if
they will, and of which I have formed in my own mind a clear and
detailed conception. For I do not propose merely to survey these regions
in my mind, like an augur taking auspices, but to enter them like a
general who means to take possession. So much for the first part of the
work.</p>
<p>Having thus coasted past the ancient arts, the next point is to equip
the intellect for passing beyond. To the second part, therefore, belongs
the doctrine concerning the better and more perfect use of human reason
in the inquisition of things, and the true helps of the understanding,
that thereby (as far as the condition of mortality and humanity allows)
the intellect may be raised and exalted, and made capable of overcoming
the difficulties and obscurities of nature. The art which I introduce
with this view (which I call “Interpretation of Nature”) is a kind of
logic, though the difference between it and the ordinary logic is great,
indeed, immense. For the ordinary logic professes to contrive and
prepare helps and guards for the understanding, as mine does; and in
this one point they agree. But mine differs from it in three points
especially — viz., in the end aimed at, in the order of demonstration,
and in the starting point of the inquiry.</p>
<p>For the end which this science of mine proposes is the invention not
of arguments but of arts; not of things in accordance with principles,
but of principles themselves; not of probable reasons, but of
designations and directions for works. And as the intention is
different, so, accordingly, is the effect; the effect of the one being
to overcome an opponent in argument, of the other to command nature in
action.</p>
<p>In accordance with this end is also the nature and order of the
demonstrations. For in the ordinary logic almost all the work is spent
about the syllogism. Of induction, the logicians seem hardly to have
taken any serious thought, but they pass it by with a slight notice and
hasten on to the formulae of disputation. I, on the contrary, reject
demonstration by syllogism as acting too confusedly and letting nature
slip out of its hands. For although no one can doubt that things which
agree in a middle term agree with one another (which is a proposition of
mathematical certainty), yet it leaves an opening for deception, which
is this: the syllogism consists of propositions — propositions of words;
and words are the tokens and signs of notions. Now if the very notions
of the mind (which are as the soul of words and the basis of the whole
structure) be improperly and overhastily abstracted from facts, vague,
not sufficiently definite, faulty — in short, in many ways, the whole
edifice tumbles. I therefore reject the syllogism, and that not only as
regards principles (for to principles the logicians themselves do not
apply it) but also as regards middle propositions, which, though
obtainable no doubt by the syllogism, are, when so obtained, barren of
works, remote from practice, and altogether unavailable for the active
department of the sciences. Although, therefore, I leave to the
syllogism and these famous and boasted modes of demonstration their
jurisdiction over popular arts and such as are matter of opinion (in
which department I leave all as it is), yet in dealing with the nature
of things I use induction throughout, and that in the minor propositions
as well as the major. For I consider induction to be that form of
demonstration which upholds the sense, and closes with nature, and comes
to the very brink of operation, if it does not actually deal with
it.</p>
<p>Hence it follows that the order of demonstration is likewise
inverted. For hitherto the proceeding has been to fly at once from the
sense and particulars up to the most general propositions, as certain
fixed poles for the argument to turn upon, and from these to derive the
rest by middle terms — a short way, no doubt, but precipitate and one
which will never lead to nature, though it offers an easy and ready way
to disputation. Now my plan is to proceed regularly and gradually from
one axiom to another, so that the most general are not reached till the
last; but then, when you do come to them, you find them to be not empty
notions but well defined, and such as nature would really recognize as
her first principles, and such as lie at the heart and marrow of
things.</p>
<p>But the greatest change I introduce is in the form itself of
induction and the judgment made thereby. For the induction of which the
logicians speak, which proceeds by simple enumeration, is a puerile
thing, concludes at hazard, is always liable to be upset by a
contradictory instance, takes into account only what is known and
ordinary, and leads to no result.</p>
<p>Now what the sciences stand in need of is a form of induction which
shall analyze experience and take it to pieces, and by a due process of
exclusion and rejection lead to an inevitable conclusion. And if that
ordinary mode of judgment practiced by the logicians was so laborious,
and found exercise for such great wits, how much more labor must we be
prepared to bestow upon this other, which is extracted not merely out of
the depths of the mind, but out of the very bowels of nature.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. For I also sink the foundations of the sciences
deeper and firmer; and I begin the inquiry nearer the source than men
have done heretofore, submitting to examination those things which the
common logic takes on trust. For first, the logicians borrow the
principles of each science from the science itself; secondly, they hold
in reverence the first notions of the mind; and lastly, they receive as
conclusive the immediate informations of the sense, when well disposed.
Now upon the first point, I hold that true logic ought to enter the
several provinces of science armed with a higher authority than belongs
to the principles of those sciences themselves, and ought to call those
putative principles to account until they are fully established. Then
with regard to the first notions of the intellect, there is not one of
the impressions taken by the intellect when left to go its own way, but
I hold it as suspect and no way established until it has submitted to a
new trial and a fresh judgment has been thereupon pronounced. And
lastly, the information of the sense itself I sift and examine in many
ways. For certain it is that the senses deceive; but then at the same
time they supply the means of discovering their own errors; only the
errors are here, the means of discovery are to seek.</p>
<p>The sense fails in two ways. Sometimes it gives no information,
sometimes it gives false information. For first, there are very many
things which escape the sense, even when best disposed and no way
obstructed, by reason either of the subtlety of the whole body or the
minuteness of the parts, or distance of place, or slowness or else
swiftness of motion, or familiarity of the object, or other causes. And
again when the sense does apprehend a thing its apprehension is not much
to be relied upon. For the testimony and information of the sense has
reference always to man, not to the universe; and it is a great error to
assert that the sense is the measure of things.</p>
<p>To meet these difficulties, I have sought on all sides diligently and
faithfully to provide helps for the sense — substitutes to supply its
failures, rectifications to correct its errors; and this I endeavor to
accomplish not so much by instruments as by experiments. For the
subtlety of experiments is far greater than that of the sense itself,
even when assisted by exquisite instruments — such experiments, I mean,
as are skillfully and artificially devised for the express purpose of
determining the point in question. To the immediate and proper
perception of the sense, therefore, I do not give much weight; but I
contrive that the office of the sense shall be only to judge of the
experiment, and that the experiment itself shall judge of the thing. And
thus I conceive that I perform the office of a true priest of the sense
(from which all knowledge in nature must be sought, unless men mean to
go mad) and a not unskillful interpreter of its oracles; and that while
others only profess to uphold and cultivate the sense, I do so in fact.
Such then are the provisions I make for finding the genuine light of
nature and kindling and bringing it to bear. And they would be
sufficient of themselves if the human intellect were even and like a
fair sheet of paper with no writing on it. But since the minds of men
are strangely possessed and beset so that there is no true and even
surface left to reflect the genuine rays of things, it is necessary to
seek a remedy for this also.</p>
<p>Now the idols, or phantoms, by which the mind is occupied are either
adventitious or innate. The adventitious come into the mind from without
— namely, either from the doctrines and sects of philosophers or from
perverse rules of demonstration. But the innate are inherent in the very
nature of the intellect, which is far more prone to error than the sense
is. For let men please themselves as they will in admiring and almost
adoring the human mind, this is certain: that as an uneven mirror
distorts the rays of objects according to its own figure and section, so
the mind, when it receives impressions of objects through the sense,
cannot be trusted to report them truly, but in forming its notions mixes
up its own nature with the nature of things.</p>
<p>And as the first two kinds of idols are hard to eradicate, so idols
of this last kind cannot be eradicated at all. All that can be done is
to point them out, so that this insidious action of the mind may be
marked and reproved (else as fast as old errors are destroyed new ones
will spring up out of the ill complexion of the mind itself, and so we
shall have but a change of errors, and not a clearance); and to lay it
down once for all as a fixed and established maxim that the intellect is
not qualified to judge except by means of induction, and induction in
its legitimate form. This doctrine, then, of the expurgation of the
intellect to qualify it for dealing with truth is comprised in three
refutations: the refutation of the philosophies; the refutation of the
demonstrations; and the refutation of the natural human reason. The
explanation of which things, and of the true relation between the nature
of things and the nature of the mind, is as the strewing and decoration
of the bridal chamber of the mind and the universe, the divine goodness
assisting, out of which marriage let us hope (and be this the prayer of
the bridal song) there may spring helps to man, and a line and race of
inventions that may in some degree subdue and overcome the necessities
and miseries of humanity. This is the second part of the work.</p>
<p>But I design not only to indicate and mark out the ways, but also to
enter them. And therefore the third part of the work embraces the
“phenomena of the universe”; that is to say, experience of every kind,
and such a natural history as may serve for a foundation to build
philosophy upon. For a good method of demonstration or form of
interpreting nature may keep the mind from going astray or stumbling,
but it is not any excellence of method that can supply it with the
material of knowledge. Those, however, who aspire not to guess and
divine, but to discover and know, who propose not to devise mimic and
fabulous worlds of their own, but to examine and dissect the nature of
this very world itself, must go to facts themselves for everything. Nor
can the place of this labor and search and world-wide perambulation be
supplied by any genius or meditation or argumentation; no, not if all
men’s wits could meet in one. This, therefore, we must have or the
business must be forever abandoned. But up to this day such has been the
condition of men in this matter that it is no wonder if nature will not
give herself into their hands.</p>
<p>For first, the information of the sense itself, sometimes failing,
sometimes false; observation, careless, irregular, and led by chance;
tradition, vain, and fed on rumor; practice, slavishly bent upon its
work; experiment, blind, stupid, vague, and prematurely broken off;
lastly, natural history trivial and poor — all these have contributed to
supply the understanding with very bad materials for philosophy and the
sciences.</p>
<p>Then an attempt is made to mend the matter by a preposterous subtlety
and winnowing of argument. But this comes too late, the case being
already past remedy, and is far from setting the business right or
sifting away the errors. The only hope, therefore, of any greater
increase or progress lies in a reconstruction of the sciences.</p>
<p>Of this reconstruction the foundation must be laid in natural
history, and that of a new kind and gathered on a new principle. For it
is in vain that you polish the mirror if there are no images to be
reflected; and it is as necessary that the intellect should be supplied
with fit matter to work upon, as with safeguards to guide its working.
But my history differs from that in use (as my logic does) in many
things — in end and office, in mass and composition, in subtlety, in
selection also, and setting forth, with a view to the operations which
are to follow.</p>
<p>For first, the object of the natural history which I propose is not
so much to delight with variety of matter or to help with present use of
experiments, as to give light to the discovery of causes and supply a
suckling philosophy with its first food. For though it be true that I am
principally in pursuit of works and the active department of the
sciences, yet I wait for harvest-time and do not attempt to mow the moss
or to reap the green corn. For I well know that axioms once rightly
discovered will carry whole troops of works along with them, and produce
them, not here and there one, but in clusters. And that unseasonable and
puerile hurry to snatch by way of earnest at the first works which come
within reach, I utterly condemn and reject as an Atalanta’s apple that
hinders the race. Such then is the office of this natural history of
mine.</p>
<p>Next, with regard to the mass and composition of it: I mean it to be
a history not only of nature free and at large (when she is left to her
own course and does her work her own way) — such as that of the heavenly
bodies, meteors, earth and sea, minerals, plants, animals — but much
more of nature under constraint and vexed; that is to say, when by art
and the hand of man she is forced out of her natural state, and squeezed
and moulded. Therefore I set down at length all experiments of the
mechanical arts, of the operative part of the liberal arts, of the many
crafts which have not yet grown into arts properly so called, so far as
I have been able to examine them and as they conduce to the end in view.
Nay (to say the plain truth), I do in fact (low and vulgar as men may
think it) count more upon this part both for helps and safeguards than
upon the other, seeing that the nature of things betrays itself more
readily under the vexations of art than in its natural freedom.</p>
<p>Nor do I confine the history to bodies, but I have thought it my duty
besides to make a separate history of such virtues as may be considered
cardinal in nature. I mean those original passions or desires of matter
which constitute the primary elements of nature; such as dense and rare,
hot and cold, solid and fluid, heavy and light, and several others.</p>
<p>Then again, to speak of subtlety: I seek out and get together a kind
of experiments much subtler and simpler than those which occur
accidentally. For I drag into light many things which no one who was not
proceeding by a regular and certain way to the discovery of causes would
have thought of inquiring after, being indeed in themselves of no great
use; which shows that they were not sought for on their own account, but
having just the same relation to things and works which the letters of
the alphabet have to speech and words — which, though in themselves
useless, are the elements of which all discourse is made up.</p>
<p>Further, in the selection of the relation and experiments I conceive
I have been a more cautious purveyor than those who have hitherto dealt
with natural history. For I admit nothing but on the faith of eyes, or
at least of careful and severe examination, so that nothing is
exaggerated for wonder’s sake, but what I state is sound and without
mixture of fables or vanity. All received or current falsehoods also
(which by strange negligence have been allowed for many ages to prevail
and become established) I proscribe and brand by name, that the sciences
may be no more troubled with them. For it has been well observed that
the fables and superstitions and follies which nurses instill into
children do serious injury to their minds; and the same consideration
makes me anxious, having the management of the childhood, as it were, of
philosophy in its course of natural history, not to let it accustom
itself in the beginning to any vanity. Moreover, whenever I come to a
new experiment of any subtlety (though it be in my own opinion certain
and approved), I nevertheless subjoin a clear account of the manner in
which I made it, that men, knowing exactly how each point was made out,
may see whether there be any error connected with it and may arouse
themselves to devise proofs more trustworthy and exquisite, if such can
be found; and finally, I interpose everywhere admonitions and scruples
and cautions, with a religious care to eject, repress, and, as it were,
exorcise every kind of phantasm.</p>
<p>Lastly, knowing how much the sight of man’s mind is distracted by
experience and history, and how hard it is at the first (especially for
minds either tender or preoccupied) to become familiar with nature, I
not unfrequently subjoin observations of my own, being as the first
offers inclinations, and, as it were, glances of history toward
philosophy, both by way of an assurance to men that they will not be
kept forever tossing on the waves of experience, and also that when the
time comes for the intellect to begin its work, it may find everything
the more ready. By such a natural history, then, as I have described, I
conceive that a safe and convenient approach may be made to nature, and
matter supplied of good quality and well prepared for the understanding
to work upon.</p>
<p>And now that we have surrounded the intellect with faithful helps and
guards, and got together with most careful selection a regular army of
divine works, it may seem that we have no more to do but to proceed to
philosophy itself. And yet in a matter so difficult and doubtful there
are still some things which it seems necessary to premise, partly for
convenience of explanation, partly for present use.</p>
<p>Of these the first is to set forth examples of inquiry and invention
according to my method, exhibited by anticipation in some particular
subjects; choosing such subjects as are at once the most noble in
themselves among those under inquiry, and most different one from
another, that there may be an example in every kind. I do not speak of
those examples which are joined to the several precepts and rules by way
of illustration (for of these I have given plenty in the second part of
the work); but I mean actual types and models, by which the entire
process of the mind and the whole fabric and order of invention from the
beginning to the end, in certain subjects, and those various and
remarkable, should be set, as it were, before the eyes. For I remember
that in the mathematics it is easy to follow the demonstration when you
have a machine beside you, whereas without that help all appears
involved and more subtle than it really is. To examples of this kind —
being in fact nothing more than an application of the second part in
detail and at large — the fourth part of the work is devoted.</p>
<p>The fifth part is for temporary use only, pending the completion of
the rest, like interest payable from time to time until the principal be
forthcoming. For I do not make so blindly for the end of my journey as
to neglect anything useful that may turn up by the way. And therefore I
include in this part such things as I have myself discovered, proved, or
added — not, however, according to the true rules and methods of
interpretation, but by the ordinary use of the understanding in
inquiring and discovering. For besides that I hope my speculations may,
in virtue of my continual conversancy with nature, have a value beyond
the pretensions of my wit, they will serve in the meantime for wayside
inns, in which the mind may rest and refresh itself on its journey to
more certain conclusions. Nevertheless I wish it to be understood in the
meantime that they are conclusions by which (as not being discovered and
proved by the true form of interpretation) I do not at all mean to bind
myself. Nor need any one be alarmed at such suspension of judgment in
one who maintains not simply that nothing can be known, but only that
nothing can be known except in a certain course and way; and yet
establishes provisionally certain degrees of assurance for use and
relief until the mind shall arrive at a knowledge of causes in which it
can rest. For even those schools of philosophy which held the absolute
impossibility of knowing anything were not inferior to those which took
upon them to pronounce. But then they did not provide helps for the
sense and understanding, as I have done, but simply took away all their
authority; which is quite a different thing — almost the reverse.</p>
<p>The sixth part of my work (to which the rest is subservient and
ministrant) discloses and sets forth that philosophy which by the
legitimate, chaste, and severe course of inquiry which I have explained
and provided is at length developed and established. The completion,
however, of this last part is a thing both above my strength and beyond
my hopes. I have made a beginning of the work — a beginning, as I hope,
not unimportant: the fortune of the human race will give the issue, such
an issue, it may be, as in the present condition of things and men’s
minds cannot easily be conceived or imagined. For the matter in hand is
no mere felicity of speculation, but the real business and fortunes of
the human race, and all power of operation. For man is but the servant
and interpreter of nature: what he does and what he knows is only what
he has observed of nature’s order in fact or in thought; beyond this he
knows nothing and can do nothing. For the chain of causes cannot by any
force be loosed or broken, nor can nature be commanded except by being
obeyed. And so those twin objects, human knowledge and human power, do
really meet in one; and it is from ignorance of causes that operation
fails.</p>
<p>And all depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of
nature and so receiving their images simply as they are. For God forbid
that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of
the world; rather may he graciously grant to us to write an apocalypse
or true vision of the footsteps of the Creator imprinted on his
creatures.</p>
<p>Therefore do thou, O Father, who gavest the visible light as the
first fruits of creation, and didst breathe into the face of man the
intellectual light as the crown and consummation thereof, guard and
protect this work, which coming from thy goodness returneth to thy
glory. Thou when thou turnedst to look upon the works which thy hands
had made, sawest that all was very good, and didst rest from thy labors.
But man, when he turned to look upon the work which his hands had made,
saw that all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and could find no rest
therein. Wherefore if we labor in thy works with the sweat of our brows,
thou wilt make us partakers of thy vision and thy sabbath. Humbly we
pray that this mind may be steadfast in us, and that through these our
hands, and the hands of others to whom thou shall give the same spirit,
thou wilt vouchsafe to endow the human family with new mercies.</p>

<p>NEW METHOD</p>
<p>Translated by William Wood and Joseph Devey</p>
<p>Novum Organum Scientiarum was originally written in Latin and
published in 1620. The title is a reference to Aristotle’s work Organon,
a treatise on logic and syllogism. Bacon’s essay details a new system of
logic he believes to be superior to the old ways of syllogism. The text
was instrumental in the historical development of the scientific method.
Offering a technique centred on experimental research, Bacon’s emphasis
on the use of artificial experiments to provide additional observances
of a phenomenon is one reason that he was judged by other great
thinkers, including Voltaire, to be “the Father of the Experimental
Philosophy”. In this important text, Bacon sets the scene for science to
develop various methodologies, criticising Aristotelian approaches to
science, arguing that method was needed to understand the natural biases
and weaknesses of the human mind, including the natural bias it has to
seek metaphysical explanations not based on real observations.</p>
