<h4 id="section">89</h4>
<p>Neither is it to be forgotten that in every age natural philosophy
has had a troublesome and hard to deal with adversary — namely,
superstition, and the blind and immoderate zeal of religion. For we see
among the Greeks that those who first proposed to men’s then uninitiated
ears the natural causes for thunder and for storms were thereupon found
guilty of impiety. Nor was much more forbearance shown by some of the
ancient fathers of the Christian church to those who on most convincing
grounds (such as no one in his senses would now think of contradicting)
maintained that the earth was round, and of consequence asserted the
existence of the antipodes.</p>
<p>Moreover, as things now are, to discourse of nature is made harder
and more perilous by the summaries and systems of the schoolmen who,
having reduced theology into regular order as well as they were able,
and fashioned it into the shape of an art, ended in incorporating the
contentious and thorny philosophy of Aristotle, more than was fit, with
the body of religion.</p>
<p>To the same result, though in a different way, tend the speculations
of those who have taken upon them to deduce the truth of the Christian
religion from the principles of philosophers, and to confirm it by their
authority, pompously solemnizing this union of the sense and faith as a
lawful marriage, and entertaining men’s minds with a pleasing variety of
matter, but all the while disparaging things divine by mingling them
with things human. Now in such mixtures of theology with philosophy only
the received doctrines of philosophy are included; while new ones,
albeit changes for the better, are all but expelled and
exterminated.</p>
<p>Lastly, you will find that by the simpleness of certain divines,
access to any philosophy, however pure, is well-nigh closed. Some are
weakly afraid lest a deeper search into nature should transgress the
permitted limits of sober-mindedness, wrongfully wresting and
transferring what is said in Holy Writ against those who pry into sacred
mysteries, to the hidden things of nature, which are barred by no
prohibition. Others with more subtlety surmise and reflect that if
second causes are unknown everything can more readily be referred to the
divine hand and rod, a point in which they think religion greatly
concerned — which is in fact nothing else but to seek to gratify God
with a lie. Others fear from past example that movements and changes in
philosophy will end in assaults on religion. And others again appear
apprehensive that in the investigation of nature something may be found
to subvert or at least shake the authority of religion, especially with
the unlearned. But these two last fears seem to me to savor utterly of
carnal wisdom; as if men in the recesses and secret thought of their
hearts doubted and distrusted the strength of religion and the empire of
faith over the sense, and therefore feared that the investigation of
truth in nature might be dangerous to them. But if the matter be truly
considered, natural philosophy is, after the word of God, at once the
surest medicine against superstition and the most approved nourishment
for faith, and therefore she is rightly given to religion as her most
faithful handmaid, since the one displays the will of God, the other his
power. For he did not err who said, “Ye err in that ye know not the
Scriptures and the power of God,” thus coupling and blending in an
indissoluble bond information concerning his will and meditation
concerning his power. Meanwhile it is not surprising if the growth of
natural philosophy is checked when religion, the thing which has most
power over men’s minds, has by the simpleness and incautious zeal of
certain persons been drawn to take part against her.</p>
