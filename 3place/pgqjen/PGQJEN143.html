<p>BACON’S FALL.</p>
<p>When Parliament met on January 30, 1620/21, and Bacon, as Lord
Chancellor, set forth in his ceremonial speeches to the King and to the
Speaker the glories and blessings of James’s reign, no man in England
had more reason to think himself fortunate. He had reached the age of
sixty, and had gained the object of his ambition. More than that, he was
conscious that in his great office he was finding full play for his
powers and his high public purposes. He had won greatly on the
confidence of the King. He had just received a fresh mark of honour from
him: a few days before he had been raised a step in the peerage, and he
was now Viscount St. Alban’s. With Buckingham he seemed to be on terms
of the most affectionate familiarity, exchanging opinions freely with
him on every subject. And Parliament met in good-humour. They voted
money at once. One of the matters which interested Bacon most — the
revision of the Statute Book — they took up as one of their first
measures, and appointed a Select Committee to report upon it. And what,
amid the apparent felicity of the time, was of even greater personal
happiness to Bacon, the first step of the “Great Instauration” had been
taken. During the previous autumn, Oct. 12, 1620, the Novum Organum, the
first instalment of his vast design, was published, the result of the
work of thirty years; and copies were distributed to great people, among
others to Coke. He apprehended no evil; he had nothing to fear, and much
to hope from the times.</p>
<p>His sudden and unexpected fall, so astonishing and so irreparably
complete, is one of the strangest events of that still imperfectly
comprehended time. There had been, and were still to be, plenty of
instances of the downfall of power, as ruinous and even more tragic,
though scarcely any one more pathetic in its surprise and its shame. But
it is hard to find one of which so little warning was given, and the
causes of which are at once in part so clear, and in part so obscure and
unintelligible. Such disasters had to be reckoned upon as possible
chances by any one who ventured into public life. Montaigne advises that
the discipline of pain should be part of every boy’s education, for the
reason that every one in his day might be called upon to undergo the
torture. And so every public man, in the England of the Tudors and
Stuarts, entered on his career with the perfectly familiar expectation
of possibly closing it — it might be in an honourable and ceremonious
fashion, in the Tower and on the scaffold — just as he had to look
forward to the possibility of closing it by small-pox or the plague. So
that when disaster came, though it might be unexpected, as death is
unexpected, it was a turn of things which ought not to take a man by
surprise. But some premonitory signs usually gave warning. There was
nothing to warn Bacon that the work which he believed he was doing so
well would be interrupted.</p>
<p>We look in vain for any threatenings of the storm. What the men of
his time thought and felt about Bacon it is not easy to ascertain.
Appearances are faint and contradictory; he himself, though scornful of
judges who sought to be “popular,” believed that he “came in with the
favour of the general;” that he “had a little popular reputation, which
followeth me whether I will or no.” No one for years had discharged the
duties of his office with greater efficiency. Scarcely a trace remains
of any suspicion, previous to the attack upon him, of the justice of his
decisions; no instance was alleged that, in fact, impure motives had
controlled the strength and lucidity of an intellect which loved to be
true and right for the mere pleasure of being so. Nor was there anything
in Bacon’s political position to make him specially obnoxious above all
others of the King’s Council. He maintained the highest doctrines of
prerogative; but they were current doctrines, both at the Council board
and on the bench; and they were not discredited nor extinguished by his
fall. To be on good terms with James and Buckingham meant a degree of
subservience which shocks us now; but it did not shock people then, and
he did not differ from his fellows in regarding it as part of his duty
as a public servant of the Crown. No doubt he had enemies — some with
old grudges like Southampton, who had been condemned with Essex; some
like Suffolk, smarting under recent reprimands and the biting edge of
Bacon’s tongue; some like Coke, hating him from constitutional
antipathies and the strong antagonism of professional doctrines, for a
long course of rivalry and for mortifying defeats. But there is no
appearance of preconcerted efforts among them to bring about his
overthrow. He did not at the time seem to be identified with anything
dangerous or odious. There was no doubt a good deal of dissatisfaction
with Chancery — among the common lawyers, because it interfered with
their business; in the public, partly from the traditions of its
slowness, partly from its expensiveness, partly because, being intended
for special redress of legal hardship, it was sure to disappoint one
party to a suit. But Bacon thought that he had reformed Chancery. He had
also done a great deal to bring some kind of order, or at least
hopefulness of order, into the King’s desperate finances. And he had
never set himself against Parliament. On the contrary, he had always
been forward to declare that the King could not do without Parliament,
and that Parliament only needed to be dealt with generously, and as
“became a King,” to be not a danger and hindrance to the Crown but its
most sincere and trustworthy support.</p>
<p>What was then to portend danger to Bacon when the Parliament of
1620/21 met? The House of Commons at its meeting was thoroughly loyal
and respectful; it meant to be benedictum et pacificum parliamentum.
Every one knew that there would be “grievances” which would not be
welcome to the Court, but they did not seem likely to touch him. Every
one knew that there would be questions raised about unpopular patents
and oppressive monopolies, and about their legality; and it was pretty
well agreed upon at Court that they should be given up as soon as
complained of. But Bacon was not implicated more than the Crown lawyers
before him, in what all the Crown lawyers had always defended. There was
dissatisfaction about the King’s extravagance and wastefulness, about
his indecision in the cause of the Elector Palatine, about his supposed
intrigues with Papistical and tyrannical Spain; but Bacon had nothing to
do with all this except, as far as he could, to give wise counsel and
warning. The person who made the King despised and hated was the
splendid and insolent favourite, Buckingham. It might have been thought
that the one thing to be set against much that was wrong in the State
was the just and enlightened and speedy administration of equity in the
Chancery.</p>
<p>When Parliament met, though nothing seemed to threaten mischief, it
met with a sturdy purpose of bringing to account certain delinquents
whose arrogance and vexations of the subjects had provoked the country,
and who were supposed to shelter themselves under the countenance of
Buckingham. Michell and Mompesson were rascals whose misdemeanors might
well try the patience of a less spirited body than an English House of
Commons. Buckingham could not protect them, and hardly tried to do so.
But just as one electric current “induces” another by neighbourhood, so
all this deep indignation against Buckingham’s creatures created a
fierce temper of suspicion about corruption all through the public
service. Two Committees were early appointed by the House of Commons:
one a Committee on Grievances, such as the monopolies; the other, a
Committee to inquire into abuses in the Courts of Justice and receive
petitions about them. In the course of the proceedings, the question
arose in the House as to the authorities or “referees” who had certified
to the legality of the Crown patents or grants which had been so grossly
abused; and among these “referees” were the Lord Chancellor and other
high officers, both legal and political.</p>
<p>It was the little cloud. But lookers-on like Chamberlain did not
think much of it. “The referees,” he wrote on Feb. 29th, “who certified
the legality of the patents are glanced at, but they are chiefly above
the reach of the House; they attempt so much that they will accomplish
little.” Coke, who was now the chief leader in Parliament, began to talk
ominously of precedents, and to lay down rules about the power of the
House to punish — rules which were afterwards found to have no authority
for them. Cranfield, the representative of severe economy, insisted that
the honour of the King required that the referees, whoever they were,
should be called to account. The gathering clouds shifted a little, when
the sense of the House seemed to incline to giving up all retrospective
action, and to a limitation for the future by statute of the
questionable prerogative — a limitation which was in fact attempted by a
bill thrown out by the Lords. But they gathered again when the Commons
determined to bring the whole matter before the House of Lords. The King
wrote to warn Bacon of what was coming. The proposed conference was
staved off by management for a day or two, but it could not be averted,
and the Lords showed their eagerness for it. And two things by this time
— the beginning of March — seemed now to have become clear, first, that
under the general attack on the referees was intended a blow against
Bacon; next, that the person whom he had most reason to fear was Sir
Edward Coke.</p>
<p>The storm was growing; but Bacon was still unalarmed, though
Buckingham had been frightened into throwing the blame on the
referees.</p>
<p>“I do hear,” he writes to Buckingham (dating his letter on March 7th,
“the day I received the seal”), “from divers of judgement, that
to-morrow’s conference is like to pass in a calm, as to the referees.
Sir Lionel Cranfield, who hath been formerly the trumpet, said yesterday
that he did now incline unto Sir John Walter’s opinion and motion not to
have the referees meddled with, otherwise than to discount it from the
King; and so not to look back, but to the future. And I do hear almost
all men of judgement in the House wish now that way. I woo nobody; I do
but listen, and I have doubt only of Sir Edward Coke, who I wish had
some round caveat given him from the King; for your Lordship hath no
great power with him. But a word from the King mates him.”</p>
<p>But Coke’s opportunity had come. The House of Commons was disposed
for gentler measures. But he was able to make it listen to his harsher
counsels, and from this time his hand appears in all that was done. The
first conference was a tame and dull one. The spokesmen had been slack
in their disagreeable and perhaps dangerous duty. But Coke and his
friends took them sharply to task. “The heart and tongue of Sir Edward
Coke are true relations,” said one of his fervent supporters; “but his
pains hath not reaped that harvest of praise that he hath deserved. For
the referees, they are as transcendent delinquents as any other, and
sure their souls made a wilful elopement from their bodies when they
made these certificates.” A second conference was held with the Lords,
and this time the charge was driven home. The referees were named, the
Chancellor at the head of them. When Bacon rose to explain and justify
his acts he was sharply stopped, and reminded that he was transgressing
the orders of the House in speaking till the Committees were named to
examine the matter. What was even more important, the King had come to
the House of Lords (March 10th), and frightened, perhaps, about his
subsidies, told them “that he was not guilty of those grievances which
are now discovered, but that he grounded his judgement upon others who
have misled him.” The referees would be attacked, people thought, if the
Lower House had courage.</p>
<p>All this was serious. As things were drifting, it seemed as if Bacon
might have to fight the legal question of the prerogative in the form of
a criminal charge, and be called upon to answer the accusation of being
the minister of a crown which legal language pronounced absolute, and of
a King who interpreted legal language to the letter; and further, to
meet his accusers after the King himself had disavowed what his servant
had done. What passed between Bacon and the King is confused and
uncertain; but after his speech the King could scarcely have thought of
interfering with the inquiry. The proceedings went on; Committees were
named for the several points of inquiry; and Bacon took part in these
arrangements. It was a dangerous position to have to defend himself
against an angry House of Commons, led and animated by Coke and
Cranfield. But though the storm had rapidly thickened, the charges
against the referees were not against him alone. His mistake in law, if
it was a mistake, was shared by some of the first lawyers and first
councillors in England. There was a battle before him, but not a
hopeless one. “Modicæ fidei, quare dubitasti” he writes about this time
to an anxious friend.</p>
<p>But in truth the thickening storm had been gathering over his head
alone. It was against him that the whole attack was directed; as soon as
it took a different shape, the complaints against the other referees,
such as the Chief-Justice, who was now Lord Treasurer, though some
attempt was made to press them, were quietly dropped. What was the
secret history of these weeks we do not know. But the result of Bacon’s
ruin was that Buckingham was saved. “As they speak of the Turquoise
stone in a ring,” Bacon had said to Buckingham when he was made
Chancellor, “I will break into twenty pieces before you have the least
fall.” Without knowing what he pledged himself to, he was taken at his
word.</p>
<p>At length the lightning fell. During the early part of March, while
these dangerous questions were mooted about the referees, a Committee,
appointed early in the session, had also been sitting on abuses in
courts of justice, and as part of their business, an inquiry had been
going on into the ways of the subordinate officers of the Court of
Chancery. Bacon had early (Feb. 17th) sent a message to the Committee
courting full inquiry, “willingly consenting that any man might speak
anything of his Court.” On the 12th of March the chairman, Sir R.
Philips, reported that he had in his hands “divers petitions, many
frivolous and clamorous, many of weight and consequence.” Cranfield, who
presided over the Court of Wards, had quarrelled fiercely with the
Chancery, where he said there was “neither Law, Equity, nor Conscience,”
and pressed the inquiry, partly, it may be, to screen his own Court,
which was found fault with by the lawyers. Some scandalous abuses were
brought to light in the Chancery. They showed that “Bacon was at fault
in the art of government,” and did not know how to keep his servants in
order. One of them, John Churchill, an infamous forger of Chancery
orders, finding things going hard with him, and “resolved,” it is said,
“not to sink alone,” offered his confessions of all that was going on
wrong in the Court. But on the 15th of March things took another turn.
It was no longer a matter of doubtful constitutional law; no longer a
question of slack discipline over his officers. To the astonishment, if
not of the men of his own day, at least to the unexhausted astonishment
of times following, a charge was suddenly reported from the Committee to
the Commons against the Lord Chancellor, not of straining the
prerogative, or of conniving at his servants’ misdoings, but of being
himself a corrupt and venal judge. Two suitors charged him with
receiving bribes. Bacon was beginning to feel worried and anxious, and
he wrote thus to Buckingham. At length he had begun to see the meaning
of all these inquiries, and to what they were driving.</p>
<p>“MY VERY GOOD LORD, — Your Lordship spake of Purgatory. I am now in
it, but my mind is in a calm, for my fortune is not my felicity. I know
I have clean hands and a clean heart, and I hope a clean house for
friends or servants. But Job himself, or whosoever was the justest
judge, by such hunting for matters against him as hath been used against
me, may for a time seem foul, specially in a time when greatness is the
mark and accusation is the game. And if this be to be a Chancellor. I
think if the great seal lay upon Hounslow Heath nobody would take it up.
But the King and your Lordship will, I hope, put an end to these
miseries one way or other. And in troth that which I fear most is lest
continual attendance and business, together with these cares, and want
of time to do my weak body right this spring by diet and physic, will
cast me down; and then it will be thought feigning or fainting. But I
hope in God I shall hold out. God prosper you.”</p>
<p>The first charges attracted others, which were made formal matters of
complaint by the House of Commons. John Churchill, to save himself, was
busy setting down cases of misdoing; and probably suitors of themselves
became ready to volunteer evidence. But of this Bacon as yet knew
nothing. He was at this time only aware that there were persons who were
“hunting out complaints against him,” that the attack was changed from
his law to his private character; he had found an unfavourable feeling
in the House of Lords; and he knew well enough what it was to have
powerful enemies in those days when a sentence was often settled before
a trial. To any one, such a state of things was as formidable as the
first serious symptoms of a fever. He was uneasy, as a man might well be
on whom the House of Commons had fixed its eye, and to whom the House of
Lords had shown itself unfriendly. But he was as yet conscious of
nothing fatal to his defence, and he knew that if false accusations
could be lightly made they could also be exposed.</p>
<p>A few days after the first mention of corruption the Commons laid
their complaints of him before the House of Lords, and on the same day
(March 19) Bacon, finding himself too ill to go to the House, wrote to
the Peers by Buckingham, requesting them that as some “complaints of
base bribery” had come before them, they would give him a fair
opportunity of defending himself, and of cross-examining witnesses;
especially begging, that considering the number of decrees which he had
to make in a year — more than two thousand — and “the courses which had
been taken in hunting out complaints against him,” they would not let
their opinion of him be affected by the mere number of charges that
might be made. Their short verbal answer, moved by Southampton (March
20), that they meant to proceed by right rule of justice, and would be
glad if he cleared his honour, was not encouraging. And now that the
Commons had brought the matter before them, the Lords took it entirely
into their own hands, appointing three Committees, and examining the
witnesses themselves. New witnesses came forward every day with fresh
cases of gifts and presents, “bribes” received by the Lord Chancellor.
When Parliament rose for the Easter vacation (March 27-April 17), the
Committees continued sitting. A good deal probably passed of which no
record remains. When the Commons met again (April 17) Coke was full of
gibes about Instauratio Magna — the true Instauratio was to restore laws
— and two days after an Act was brought in for review and reversal of
decrees in Courts of Equity. It was now clear that the case against
Bacon had assumed formidable dimensions, and also a very strange, and
almost monstrous shape. For the Lords, who were to be the judges, had by
their Committees taken the matter out of the hands of the Commons, the
original accusers, and had become themselves the prosecutors, collecting
and arranging evidence, accepting or rejecting depositions, and doing
all that counsel or the committing magistrate would do preliminary to a
trial. There appears to have been no cross-examining of witnesses on
Bacon’s behalf, or hearing witnesses for him — not unnaturally at this
stage of business, when the prosecutors were engaged in making out their
own case; but considering that the future judges had of their own accord
turned themselves into the prosecutors, the unfairness was great. At the
same time it does not appear that Bacon did anything to watch how things
went in the Committees, which had his friends in them as well as his
enemies, and are said to have been open courts. Towards the end of
March, Chamberlain wrote to Carleton that “the Houses were working hard
at cleansing out the Augæan stable of monopolies, and also extortions in
Courts of Justice. The petitions against the Lord Chancellor were too
numerous to be got through: his chief friends and brokers of bargains,
Sir George Hastings and Sir Richard Young, and others attacked, are
obliged to accuse him in their own defence, though very reluctantly. His
ordinary bribes were £300, £400, and even £1000…. The Lords admit no
evidence except on oath. One Churchill, who was dismissed from the
Chancery Court for extortion, is the chief cause of the Chancellor’s
ruin.”3 Bacon was greatly alarmed. He wrote to Buckingham, who was “his
anchor in these floods.” He wrote to the King; he was at a loss to
account for the “tempest that had come on him;” he could not understand
what he had done to offend the country or Parliament; he had never
“taken rewards to pervert justice, however he might be frail, and
partake of the abuse of the time.”</p>
<p>“Time hath been when I have brought unto you genitum columbæ, from
others. Now I bring it from myself. I fly unto your Majesty with the
wings of a dove, which once within these seven days I thought would have
carried me a higher flight.</p>
<p>“When I enter into myself, I find not the materials of such a tempest
as is comen upon me. I have been (as your Majesty knoweth best) never
author of any immoderate counsel, but always desired to have things
carried suavibus modis. I have been no avaricious oppressor of the
people. I have been no haughty or intolerable or hateful man, in my
conversation or carriage. I have inherited no hatred from my father, but
am a good patriot born. Whence should this be? For these are the things
that use to raise dislikes abroad.”</p>
<p>And he ended by entreating the King to help him:</p>
<p>“That which I thirst after, as the hart after the streams, is that I
may know by my matchless friend [Buckingham] that presenteth to you this
letter, your Majesty’s heart (which is an abyssus of goodness, as I am
an abyssus of misery) towards me. I have been ever your man, and counted
myself but an usufructuary of myself, the property being yours; and now
making myself an oblation to do with me as may best conduce to the
honour of your justice, the honour of your mercy, and the use of your
service, resting as</p>
<p>“Clay in your Majesty’s gracious hands</p>
<p>“Fr. St. Aldan, Canc.</p>
<p>“March 25, 1621.”</p>
<p>To the world he kept up an undismayed countenance: he went down to
Gorhambury, attended by troops of friends. “This man,” said Prince
Charles, when he met his company, “scorns to go out like a snuff.” But
at Gorhambury he made his will, leaving “his name to the next ages and
to foreign nations;” and he wrote a prayer, which is a touching evidence
of his state of mind —</p>
<p>“Most gracious Lord God, my merciful Father, from my youth up, my
Creator, my Redeemer, my Comforter. Thou (O Lord) soundest and searchest
the depths and secrets of all hearts; thou knowledgest the upright of
heart, thou judgest the hypocrite, thou ponderest men’s thoughts and
doings as in a balance, thou measurest their intentions as with a line,
vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid from thee.</p>
<p>“Remember (O Lord) how thy servant hath walked before thee; remember
what I have first sought, and what hath been principal in mine
intentions. I have loved thy assemblies, I have mourned for the
divisions of thy Church, I have delighted in the brightness of thy
sanctuary. This vine which thy right hand hath planted in this nation, I
have ever prayed unto thee that it might have the first and the latter
rain; and that it might stretch her branches to the seas and to the
floods. The state and bread of the poor and oppressed have been precious
in my eyes: I have hated all cruelty and hardness of heart; I have
(though in a despised weed) procured the good of all men. If any have
been mine enemies, I thought not of them; neither hath the sun almost
set upon my displeasure; but I have been as a dove, free from
superfluity of maliciousness. Thy creatures have been my books, but thy
Scriptures much more. I have sought thee in the courts, fields, and
gardens, but I have found thee in thy temples.</p>
<p>“Thousand have been my sins, and ten thousand my transgressions; but
thy sanctifications have remained with me, and my heart, through thy
grace, hath been an unquenched coal upon thy altar. O Lord, my strength,
I have since my youth met with thee in all my ways, by thy fatherly
compassions, by thy comfortable chastisements, and by thy most visible
providence. As thy favours have increased upon me, so have thy
corrections; so as thou hast been alway near me, O Lord; and ever as my
worldly blessings were exalted, so secret darts from thee have pierced
me; and when I have ascended before men, I have descended in humiliation
before thee.</p>
<p>“And now when I thought most of peace and honour, thy hand is heavy
upon me, and hath humbled me, according to thy former loving-kindness,
keeping me still in thy fatherly school, not as a bastard, but as a
child. Just are thy judgements upon me for my sins, which are more in
number than the sands of the sea, but have no proportion to thy mercies;
for what are the sands of the sea to the sea, earth, heavens? and all
these are nothing to thy mercies.</p>
<p>“Besides my innumerable sins, I confess before thee that I am debtor
to thee for the gracious talent of thy gifts and graces, which I have
misspent in things for which I was least fit; so as I may truly say, my
soul hath been a stranger in the course of my pilgrimage. Be merciful
unto me (O Lord) for my Saviour’s sake, and receive me into thy bosom,
or guide me in thy ways.”</p>
<p>Bacon up to this time strangely, if the Committees were “open
Courts,” was entirely ignorant of the particulars of the charge which
was accumulating against him. He had an interview with the King, which
was duly reported to the House, and he placed his case before James,
distinguishing between the “three cases of bribery supposed in a judge —
a corrupt bargain; carelessness in receiving a gift while the cause is
going on; and, what is innocent, receiving a gift after it is ended.”
And he meant in such words as these to place himself at the King’s
disposal, and ask his direction:</p>
<p>“For my fortune, summa summarum with me is, that I may not be made
altogether unprofitable to do your Majesty service or honour. If your
Majesty continue me as I am, I hope I shall be a new man, and shall
reform things out of feeling, more than another can do out of example.
If I cast part of my burden, I shall be more strong and delivré to bear
the rest. And, to tell your Majesty what my thoughts run upon, I think
of writing a story of England, and of recompiling of your laws into a
better digest.”</p>
<p>The King referred him to the House; and the House now (April 19th)
prepared to gather up into “one brief” the charges against the Lord
Chancellor, still, however, continuing open to receive fresh
complaints.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the chase after abuses of all kinds was growing hotter in
the Commons — abuses in patents and monopolies, which revived the
complaints against referees, among whom Bacon was frequently named, and
abuses in the Courts of Justice. The attack passed by and spared the
Common Law Courts, as was noticed in the course of the debates; it
spared Cranfield’s Court, the Court of Wards. But it fell heavily on the
Chancery and the Ecclesiastical Courts. “I have neither power nor will
to defend Chancery,” said Sir John Bennett, the judge of the Prerogative
Court; but a few weeks after his turn came, and a series of as ugly
charges as could well be preferred against a judge, charges of extortion
as well as bribery, were reported to the House by its Committee. There
can be no doubt of the grossness of many of these abuses, and the zeal
against them was honest, though it would have shown more courage if it
had flown at higher game; but the daily discussion of them helped to
keep alive and inflame the general feeling against so great a
“delinquent” as the Lord Chancellor was supposed to be. And, indeed, two
of the worst charges against him were made before the Commons. One was a
statement made in the House by Sir George Hastings, a member of the
House, who had been the channel of Awbry’s gift, that when he had told
Bacon that if questioned he must admit it, Bacon’s answer was: “George,
if you do so, I must deny it upon my honour — upon my oath.” The other
was that he had given an opinion in favour of some claim of the Masters
in Chancery for which he received £1200, and with which he said that all
the judges agreed — an assertion which all the judges denied. Of these
charges there is no contradiction.4</p>
<p>Bacon made one more appeal to the King (April 21). He hoped that, by
resigning the seal, he might be spared the sentence:</p>
<p>“But now if not per omnipotentiam (as the divines speak), but per
potestatem suaviter disponentem, your Majesty will graciously save me
from a sentence with the good liking of the House, and that cup may pass
from me; it is the utmost of my desires.</p>
<p>“This I move with the more belief, because I assure myself that if it
be reformation that is sought, the very taking away the seal, upon my
general submission, will be as much in example for these four hundred
years as any furder severity.”</p>
<p>At length, informally, but for the first time distinctly, the full
nature of the accusation, with its overwhelming list of cases, came to
Bacon’s knowledge (April 20 or 21). From the single charge, made in the
middle of March, it had swelled in force and volume like a rising
mountain torrent. That all these charges should have sprung out of the
ground from their long concealment is strange enough. How is it that
nothing was heard of them when the things happened? And what is equally
strange is that these charges were substantially true and undeniable;
that this great Lord Chancellor, so admirable in his despatch of
business, hitherto so little complained of for wrong or unfair
decisions, had been in the habit of receiving large sums of money from
suitors, in some cases certainly while the suit was pending. And
further, while receiving them, while perfectly aware of the evil of
receiving gifts on the seat of judgment, while emphatically warning
inferior judges against yielding to the temptation, he seems really to
have continued unconscious of any wrong-doing while gift after gift was
offered and accepted. But nothing is so strange as the way in which
Bacon met the charges. Tremendous as the accusation was, he made not the
slightest fight about it. Up to this time he had held himself innocent.
Now, overwhelmed and stunned, he made no attempt at defence; he threw up
the game without a struggle, and volunteered an absolute and unreserved
confession of his guilt — that is to say, he declined to stand his
trial. Only, he made an earnest application to the House of Lords, in
proceeding to sentence, to be content with a general admission of guilt,
and to spare him the humiliation of confessing the separate facts of
alleged “bribery” which were contained in the twenty-eight Articles of
his accusation. This submission, “grounded only on rumour,” for the
Articles of charge had not yet been communicated to him by the accusers,
took the House by surprise. “No Lord spoke to it, after it had been
read, for a long time.” But they did not mean that he should escape with
this. The House treated the suggestion with impatient scorn (April 24).
“It is too late,” said Lord Saye. “No word of confession of any
corruption in the Lord Chancellor’s submission,” said Southampton; “it
stands with the justice and honour of this House not to proceed without
the parties’ particular confession, or to have the parties to hear the
charge, and we to hear the parties answer.” The demand of the Lords was
strictly just, but cruel; the Articles were now sent to him; he had been
charged with definite offences; he must answer yes or no, confess them
or defend himself. A further question arose whether he should not be
sent for to appear at the bar. He still held the seals. “Shall the Great
Seal come to the bar?” asked Lord Pembroke. It was agreed that he was to
be asked whether he would acknowledge the particulars. His answer was
“that he will make no manner of defence to the charge, but meaneth to
acknowledge corruption, and to make a particular confession to every
point, and after that a humble submission. But he humbly craves liberty
that, when the charge is more full than he finds the truth of the fact,
he may make a declaration of the truth in such particulars, the charge
being brief and containing not all the circumstances.” And such a
confession he made. “My Lords,” he said, to those who were sent to ask
whether he would stand to it, “it is my act, my hand, my heart. I
beseech your Lordships be merciful to a broken reed.” This was, of
course, followed by a request to the King from the House to “sequester”
the Great Seal. A commission was sent to receive it (May 1). “The worse,
the better,” he answered to the wish, “that it had been better with
him.” “By the King’s great favour I received the Great Seal; by my own
great fault I have lost it.” They intended him now to come to the bar to
receive his sentence. But he was too ill to leave his bed. They did not
push this point farther, but proceeded to settle the sentence (May 3).
He had asked for mercy, but he did not get it. There were men who talked
of every extremity short of death. Coke, indeed, in the Commons, from
his store of precedents, had cited cases where judges had been hanged
for bribery. But the Lords would not hear of this. “His offences foul,”
said Lord Arundel; “his confession pitiful. Life not to be touched.” But
Southampton, whom twenty years before he had helped to involve in
Essex’s ruin, urged that he should be degraded from the peerage; and
asked whether, at any rate, “he whom this House thinks unfit to be a
constable shall come to the Parliament.” He was fined £40,000. He was to
be imprisoned in the Tower during the King’s pleasure. He was to be
incapable of any office, place, or employment in the State or
Commonwealth. He was never to sit in Parliament or come within the verge
of the Court. This was agreed to, Buckingham only dissenting. “The Lord
Chancellor is so sick,” he said, “that he cannot live long.”</p>
<p>What is the history of this tremendous catastrophe by which, in less
than two months, Bacon was cast down from the height of fortune to
become a byword of shame? He had enemies, who certainly were glad, but
there is no appearance that it was the result of any plot or combination
against him. He was involved, accidentally, it may almost be said, in
the burst of anger excited by the intolerable dealings of others. The
indignation provoked by Michell and Mompesson and their associates at
that particular moment found Bacon in its path, doing, as it seemed, in
his great seat of justice, even worse than they; and when he threw up
all attempt at defence, and his judges had his hand to an unreserved
confession of corruption, both generally, and in the long list of cases
alleged against him, it is not wonderful that they came to the
conclusion, as the rest of the world did, that he was as bad as the
accusation painted him — a dishonest and corrupt judge. Yet it is
strange that they should not have observed that not a single charge of a
definitely unjust decision was brought, at any rate was proved, against
him. He had taken money, they argued, and therefore he must be corrupt;
but if he had taken money to pervert judgment, some instance of the
iniquity would certainly have been brought forward and proved. There is
no such instance to be found; though, of course, there were plenty of
dissatisfied suitors; of course the men who had paid their money and
lost their cause were furious. But in vain do we look for any case of
proved injustice. The utmost that can be said is that in some cases he
showed favour in pushing forward and expediting suits. So that the real
charge against Bacon assumes, to us who have not to deal practically
with dangerous abuses, but to judge conduct and character, a different
complexion. Instead of being the wickedness of perverting justice and
selling his judgments for bribes, it takes the shape of allowing and
sharing in a dishonourable and mischievous system of payment for
service, which could not fail to bring with it temptation and discredit,
and in which fair reward could not be distinguished from unlawful gain.
Such a system it was high time to stop; and in this rough and harsh way,
which also satisfied some personal enmities, it was stopped. We may put
aside for good the charge on which he was condemned, and which in words
he admitted — of being corrupt as a judge. His real fault — and it was a
great one — was that he did not in time open his eyes to the wrongness
and evil, patent to every one, and to himself as soon as pointed out, of
the traditional fashion in his court of eking out by irregular gifts the
salary of such an office as his.</p>
<p>Thus Bacon was condemned both to suffering and to dishonour; and, as
has been observed, condemned without a trial. But it must also be
observed that it was entirely owing to his own act that he had not a
trial, and with a trial the opportunity of cross-examining witnesses and
of explaining openly the matters urged against him. The proceedings in
the Lords were preliminary to the trial; when the time came, Bacon, of
his own choice, stopped them from going farther, by his confession and
submission. Considering the view which he claimed to take of his own
case, his behaviour was wanting in courage and spirit. From the moment
that the attack on him shifted from a charge of authorising illegal
monopolies to a charge of personal corruption, he never fairly met his
accusers. The distress and anxiety, no doubt, broke down his health; and
twice, when he was called upon to be in his place in the House of Lords,
he was obliged to excuse himself on the ground that he was too ill to
leave his bed. But between the time of the first charge and his
condemnation seven weeks elapsed; and though he was able to go down to
Gorhambury, he never in that time showed himself in the House of Lords.
Whether or not, while the Committees were busy in collecting the
charges, he would have been allowed to take part, to put questions to
the witnesses, or to produce his own, he never attempted to do so; and
by the course he took there was no other opportunity. To have stood his
trial could hardly have increased his danger, or aggravated his
punishment; and it would only have been worthy of his name and place, if
not to have made a fight for his character and integrity, at least to
have bravely said what he had made up his mind to admit, and what no one
could have said more nobly and pathetically, in open Parliament. But he
was cowed at the fierceness of the disapprobation manifest in both
Houses. He shrunk from looking his peers and his judges in the face. His
friends obtained for him that he should not be brought to the bar, and
that all should pass in writing. But they saved his dignity at the
expense of his substantial reputation. The observation that the charges
against him were not sifted by cross-examination applies equally to his
answers to them. The allegations of both sides would have come down to
us in a more trustworthy shape if the case had gone on. But to give up
the struggle, and to escape by any humiliation from a regular public
trial, seems to have been his only thought when he found that the King
and Buckingham could not or would not save him.</p>
<p>But the truth is that he knew that a trial of this kind was a trial
only in name. He knew that, when a charge of this sort was brought, it
was not meant to be really investigated in open court, but to be driven
home by proofs carefully prepared beforehand, against which the accused
had little chance. He knew, too, that in those days to resist in earnest
an accusation was apt to be taken as an insult to the court which
entertained it. And further, for the prosecutor to accept a submission
and confession without pushing to the formality of a public trial, and
therefore a public exposure, was a favour. It was a favour which by his
advice, as against the King’s honour, had been refused to Suffolk; it
was a favour which, in a much lighter charge, had by his advice been
refused to his colleague Yelverton only a few months before, when Bacon,
in sentencing him, took occasion to expatiate on the heinous guilt of
misprisions or mistakes in men in high places. The humiliation was not
complete without the trial, but it was for humiliation and not fair
investigation that the trial was wanted. Bacon knew that the trial would
only prolong his agony, and give a further triumph to his enemies.</p>
<p>That there was any plot against Bacon, and much more that Buckingham
to save himself was a party to it, is of course absurd. Buckingham,
indeed, was almost the only man in the Lords who said anything for
Bacon, and, alone, he voted against his punishment. But considering what
Buckingham was, and what he dared to do when he pleased, he was
singularly cool in helping Bacon. Williams, the astute Dean of
Westminster, who was to be Bacon’s successor as Lord Keeper, had got his
ear, and advised him not to endanger himself by trying to save
delinquents. He did not. Indeed, as the inquiry went on, he began to
take the high moral ground; he was shocked at the Chancellor’s conduct;
he would not have believed that it could have been so bad; his disgrace
was richly deserved. Buckingham kept up appearances by saying a word for
him from time to time in Parliament, which he knew would be useless, and
which he certainly took no measures to make effective. It is sometimes
said that Buckingham never knew what dissimulation was. He was capable,
at least, of the perfidy and cowardice of utter selfishness. Bacon’s
conspicuous fall diverted men’s thoughts from the far more scandalous
wickedness of the great favourite. But though there was no plot, though
the blow fell upon Bacon almost accidentally, there were many who
rejoiced to be able to drive it home. We can hardly wonder that foremost
among them was Coke. This was the end of the long rivalry between Bacon
and Coke, from the time that Essex pressed Bacon against Coke in vain to
the day when Bacon as Chancellor drove Coke from his seat for his bad
law, and as Privy Councillor ordered him to be prosecuted in the Star
Chamber for riotously breaking open men’s doors to get his daughter. The
two men thoroughly disliked and undervalued one another. Coke made light
of Bacon’s law. Bacon saw clearly Coke’s narrowness and ignorance out of
that limited legal sphere in which he was supposed to know everything,
his prejudiced and interested use of his knowledge, his coarseness and
insolence. But now in Parliament Coke was supreme, “our Hercules,” as
his friends said. He posed as the enemy of all abuses and corruption. He
brought his unrivalled, though not always accurate, knowledge of law and
history to the service of the Committees, and took care that the
Chancellor’s name should not be forgotten when it could be connected
with some bad business of patent or Chancery abuse. It was the great
revenge of the Common Law on the encroaching and insulting Chancery
which had now proved so foul. And he could not resist the opportunity of
marking the revenge of professional knowledge over Bacon’s airs of
philosophical superiority. “To restore things to their original” was his
sneer in Parliament, “this, Instauratio Magna. Instaurare paras —
Instaura leges justitiamque prius.” 5</p>
<p>The charge of corruption was as completely a surprise to Bacon as it
was to the rest of the world. And yet, as soon as the blot was hit, he
saw in a moment that his position was hopeless — he knew that he had
been doing wrong; though all the time he had never apparently given it a
thought, and he insisted, what there is every reason to believe, that no
present had induced him to give an unjust decision. It was the power of
custom over a character naturally and by habit too pliant to
circumstances. Custom made him insensible to the evil of receiving
recommendations from Buckingham in favour of suitors. Custom made him
insensible to the evil of what it seems every one took for granted —
receiving gifts from suitors. In the Court of James I. the atmosphere
which a man in office breathed was loaded with the taint of gifts and
bribes. Presents were as much the rule, as indispensable for those who
hoped to get on, as they are now in Turkey. Even in Elizabeth’s days,
when Bacon was struggling to win her favour, and was in the greatest
straits for money, he borrowed £500 to buy a jewel for the Queen. When
he was James’s servant the giving of gifts became a necessity. New
Year’s Day brought round its tribute of gold vases and gold pieces to
the King and Buckingham. And this was the least. Money was raised by the
sale of officers and titles. For £20,000, having previously offered
£10,000 in vain, the Chief-Justice of England, Montague, became Lord
Mandeville and Treasurer. The bribe was sometimes disguised: a man
became a Privy Councillor, like Cranfield, or a Chief-Justice, like Ley
(afterwards “the good Earl,” “unstained with gold or fee,” of Milton’s
Sonnet), by marrying a cousin or a niece of Buckingham. When Bacon was
made a Peer, he had also given him “the making of a Baron;” that is to
say, he might raise money by bargaining with some one who wanted a
peerage; when, however, later on, he asked Buckingham for a repetition
of the favour, Buckingham gave him a lecture on the impropriety of
prodigality, which should make it seem that “while the King was asking
money of Parliament with one hand he was giving with the other.” How
things were in Chancery in the days of the Queen, and of Bacon’s
predecessors, we know little; but Bacon himself implies that there was
nothing new in what he did. “All my lawyers,” said James, “are so bred
and nursed in corruption that they cannot leave it.” Bacon’s
Chancellorship coincided with the full bloom of Buckingham’s favour; and
Buckingham set the fashion, beyond all before him, of extravagance in
receiving and spending. Encompassed by such assumptions and such
customs, Bacon administered the Chancery. Suitors did there what people
did everywhere else; they acknowledged by a present the trouble they
gave, or the benefit they gained. It may be that Bacon’s known
difficulties about money, his expensive ways and love of pomp, his
easiness of nature, his lax discipline over his servants, encouraged
this profuseness of giving. And Bacon let it be. He asked no questions;
he knew that he worked hard and well; he knew that it could go on
without affecting his purpose to do justice “from the greatest to the
groom.” A stronger character, a keener conscience, would have faced the
question, not only whether he was not setting the most ruinous of
precedents, but whether any man could be so sure of himself as to go on
dealing justly with gifts in his hands. But Bacon, who never dared to
face the question, what James was, what Buckingham was, let himself be
spellbound by custom. He knew in the abstract that judges ought to have
nothing to do with gifts, and had said so impressively in his charges to
them. Yet he went on self-complacent, secure, almost innocent, building
up a great tradition of corruption in the very heart of English justice,
till the challenge of Parliament, which began in him its terrible and
relentless, but most unequal, prosecution of justice against ministers
who had betrayed the commonwealth in serving the Crown, woke him from
his dream, and made him see, as others saw it, the guilt of a great
judge who, under whatever extenuating pretext, allowed the suspicion to
arise that he might sell justice. “In the midst of a state of as great
affliction as mortal man can endure,” he wrote to the Lords of the
Parliament, in making his submission, “I shall begin with the professing
gladness in some things. The first is that hereafter the greatness of a
judge or magistrate shall be no sanctuary or protection of guiltiness,
which is the beginning of a golden world. The next, that after this
example it is like that judges will fly from anything that is in the
likeness of corruption as from a serpent.” Bacon’s own judgment on
himself, deliberately repeated, is characteristic, and probably comes
near the truth. “Howsoever, I acknowledge the sentence just and for
reformation’s sake fit,” he writes to Buckingham from the Tower, where,
for form’s sake, he was imprisoned for a few miserable days, he yet had
been “the justest Chancellor that hath been in the five changes that
have been since Sir Nicolas Bacon’s time.” He repeated the same thing
yet more deliberately in later times. “I was the justest judge that was
in England these fifty years. But it was the justest censure in
Parliament that was these two hundred years.”</p>
<p>He might have gone on to add, “the Wisest Counsellor; and yet none on
whom rested heavier blame; none of whom England might more justly
complain.” Good counsels given, submissive acquiescence in the worst —
this is the history of his statesmanship. Bacon, whose eye was
everywhere, was not sparing of his counsels. On all the great questions
of the time he has left behind abundant evidence, not only of what he
thought, but of what he advised. And in every case these memorials are
marked with the insight, the independence, the breadth of view, and the
moderation of a mind which is bent on truth. He started, of course, from
a basis which we are now hardly able to understand or allow for, the
idea of absolute royal power and prerogative which James had enlarged
and hardened out of the Kingship of the Tudors, itself imperious and
arbitrary enough, but always seeking, with a tact of which James was
incapable, to be in touch and sympathy with popular feeling. But it was
a basis which in principle every one of any account as yet held or
professed to hold, and which Bacon himself held on grounds of philosophy
and reason. He could see no hope for orderly and intelligent government
except in a ruler whose wisdom had equal strength to assert itself; and
he looked down with incredulity and scorn on the notion of anything good
coming out of what the world then knew or saw of popular opinion or
parliamentary government. But when it came to what was wise and fitting
for absolute power to do in the way of general measures and policy, he
was for the most part right. He saw the inexorable and pressing
necessity of putting the finance of the kingdom on a safe footing. He
saw the necessity of a sound and honest policy in Ireland. He saw the
mischief of the Spanish alliance in spite of his curious friendship with
Gondomar, and detected the real and increasing weakness of the Spanish
monarchy, which still awed mankind. He saw the growing danger of abuses
in Church and State which were left untouched, and were protected by the
punishment of those who dared to complain of them. He saw the confusion
and injustice of much of that common law of which the lawyers were so
proud; and would have attempted, if he had been able, to emulate
Justinian, and anticipate the Code Napoleon, by a rational and
consistent digest. Above all, he never ceased to impress on James the
importance, and, if wisely used, the immense advantages, of his
Parliaments. Himself, for great part of his life, an active and popular
member of the House of Commons, he saw that not only it was impossible
to do without it, but that, if fairly, honourably, honestly dealt with,
it would become a source of power and confidence which would double the
strength of the Government both at home and abroad. Yet of all this
wisdom nothing came. The finance of the kingdom was still ruined by
extravagance and corruption in a time of rapidly-developing prosperity
and wealth. The wounds of Ireland were unhealed. It was neither peace
nor war with Spain, and hot infatuation for its friendship alternated
with cold fits of distrust and estrangement. Abuses flourished and
multiplied under great patronage. The King’s one thought about
Parliament was how to get as much money out of it as he could, with as
little other business as possible. Bacon’s counsels were the prophecies
of Cassandra in that so prosperous but so disastrous reign. All that he
did was to lend the authority of his presence, in James’s most intimate
counsels, to policy and courses of which he saw the unwisdom and the
perils. James and Buckingham made use of him when they wanted. But they
would have been very different in their measures and their statesmanship
if they had listened to him.</p>
<p>Mirabeau said, what of course had been said before him, “On ne vaut,
dans la partie exécutive de la vie humaine, que par le caractère.” This
is the key to Bacon’s failures as a judge and as a statesman, and why,
knowing so much more and judging so much more wisely than James and
Buckingham, he must be identified with the misdoings of that ignoble
reign. He had the courage of his opinions; but a man wants more than
that: he needs the manliness and the public spirit to enforce them, if
they are true and salutary. But this is what Bacon had not. He did not
mind being rebuffed; he knew that he was right, and did not care. But to
stand up against the King, to contradict him after he had spoken, to
press an opinion or a measure on a man whose belief in his own wisdom
was infinite, to risk not only being set down as a dreamer, but the
King’s displeasure, and the ruin of being given over to the will of his
enemies, this Bacon had not the fibre or the stiffness or the
self-assertion to do. He did not do what a man of firm will and strength
of purpose, a man of high integrity, of habitual resolution, would have
done. Such men insist when they are responsible, and when they know that
they are right; and they prevail, or accept the consequences. Bacon,
knowing all that he did, thinking all that he thought, was content to be
the echo and the instrument of the cleverest, the foolishest, the
vainest, the most pitiably unmanly of English kings.</p>
