<h4 id="ix.-century.">IX. Century.</h4>
<p>IT is certaine, that all Bodies whatsoeuer, though they haue no
Sense, yet they haue Perception: For when one Body is applied to
another, there is a Kinde of Election, to embrace that which is
Agreeable, and to exclude or expell that which is Ingrate: And whether
the Body be Alterant, or Altered, euermore a Perception precedeth
Operation: For else all Bodies would be alike One to Another. And
sometimes this Perception, in some Kinde of Bodies, is farre more
Subtill than the Sense; So that the Sense is but a dull Thing in
Comparison of it: Wee see a Weather-Glasse, will finde the least
difference of the Weather, in Heat, or Cold, when Men finde it not. And
this Perception also, is sometimes at Distance, as well as vpon the
Touch; As when the Load-Stone draweth Iron; or Flame fireth Naphtha of
Babylon, a great distance off. It is therefore a Subiect of a very Noble
Enquiry, to enquire of the more Subtill Perceptions; For it is another
Key to open Nature, as well as the Sense; And sometimes Better. And
besides, it is a Principall Meanes of Naturall Diuination; For that
which in these Perceptions appeareth early, in the great Effects commeth
long after. It is true also, that it serueth to discouer that which is
Hid, as well as to foretell that which is to Come; As it is in many
Subtill Trialls; As to trie whether Seeds be old, or new, the Sense
cannot informe: But if you boile them in Water, the New Seeds will
sprout sooner: And so of Water, the Taste will not discouer the best
Water; But the Speedy Consuming of it, and many other Meanes, which we
haue heretofore set downe, will discouer it. So in all Physiognomy, the
Lineaments of the Body will discouer those Naturall Inclinations of the
Minde, which Dissimulation will conceale, or Discipline will suppresse.
Wee shall therefore now handle only, those two Perceptions, which
pertaine to Naturall Diuination, and Discouery: Leauing the Handling of
Perception in other Things, to be disposed Elsewhere. Now it is true,
that Diuination is attained by other Meanes; As if you know the Causes;
If you know the Concomitants; you may iudge of the Effect to follow: And
the like may be said of Discouery; But wee tie our Selues here, to that
Diuination and Discouery chiefly, which is Caused by an Early, or
Subtill Perception.</p>
<p>The Aptnesse or Propension of Aire, or Water, to Corrupt or Putrifie,
(no doubt,) is to be found before it breake forth into manifest Effects
of Diseases, Blastings, or the like. Wee will therefore set downe some
Prognosticks of Pestilentiall and Vnwholsome Yeares.</p>
<p>The Wind blowing much from the South, without Raine; And Wormes in
the Oake-Apple; haue beene spoken of before. Also the Plenty of Frogs,
Grashappers, Flies, and the like Creatures bred of Putrefaction, doth
portend Pestilentiall Yeares.</p>
<p>Great, and Early Heats in the Spring, (and namely in May,) without
Winds, portend the same; And generally so doe Yeares with little Wind,
or Thunder.</p>
<p>Great Droughts in Summer, lasting till towards the End of August, and
some Gentle Showres vpon them; And then some Drie Weather againe; Doe
portend a Pestilent Summer, the Yeare following: For about the End of
August, all the Sweetnesse of the Earth, which goeth into Plants, and
Trees, is exhaled; (And much more if the August be dry;) So that nothing
then can breathe forth of the Earth, but a grosse Vapour, which is apt
to Corrupt the Aire: And that Vapour, by the first Showres, if they be
Gentle, is released, and commeth forth abundantly. Therefore they that
come abroad soone after those Showres, are commonly taken with
Sicknesse: And in Affricke, no Body will stirre out of doores, after the
first Showres. But if the Showres come vehemently, then they rather wash
and fill the Earth, than giue it leaue to breathe forth presently. But
if Drie Weather come againe, then it fixeth and continueth the
Corruption of the Aire, vpon the first Showres begun; And maketh it of
ill Influence, euen to the Next Summer; Except a very Frostie Winter
discharge it; Which seldome succeedeth such Droughts.</p>
<p>The Lesser Infections, of the Small Pockes, Purple Feuers, Agues, in
the Summer Precedent, and houering all Winter, doe portend a great
Pestilence in the Summer following; For Putrefaction doth not rise to
his height at once.</p>
<p>It were good to lay a Peece of Raw Flesh, or Fish, in the Open Aire;
And if it Putrefie quickly, it is a Signe of a Disposition in the Aire
to Putrefaction. And because you cannot be informed, whether the
Putrefaction be quicke or late, except you compare this Experiment with
the like Experiment in another Yeare, it were not amisse, in the same
Yeare, and at the same Time, to lay one Peece of Flesh, or Fish, in the
Open Aire, and another of the same Kinde and Bignesse, within Doores:
For I iudge, that if a generall Disposition be in the Aire to Putrefie,
the Flesh, or Fish, will sooner Putrefie abroad, where the Aire hath
more power, than in the House, where it hath lesse, being many wayes
corrected. And this Experiment would be made about the End of March: For
that Season is likest to discouer, what the Winter hath done; And what
the Summer following will doe vpon the Aire. And because the Aire (no
doubt) receiueth great Tincture, and Infusion from the Earth; It were
good to trie that Exposing of Flesh, or Fish, both vpon a Stake of Wood,
some heighth aboue the Earth, and vpon the Flat of the Earth.</p>
<p>Take May-Dew, and see whether it putrifie quickly, or no? For that
likewise may disclose the Qualitie of the Aire, and Vapour of the Earth,
more or lesse Corrupted.</p>
<p>A Drie March, and a Drie May, portend a Wholesome Summer, if there be
a Showring Aprill betweene: But otherwise, it is a Signe of a
Pestilentiall Yeare.</p>
<p>As the Discouerie of the Disposition of the Aire, is good for the
Prognosticks of Wholesome, and Vnwholesome Yeares; So it is of much more
vse, for the Choice of Places to dwell in: At the least, for Lodges, and
Retiring Places for Health; (For Mansion Houses respect Prouisions, as
well as Health; Wherein the Experiments aboue mentioned may serue.</p>
<p>But for the Choice of Places, or Seats, it is good to make Triall,
not only of Aptnesse of Aire to corrupt, but also of the Moisture and
Drinesse of the Aire; and the Temper of it, in Heat, or Cold; For that
may concerne Health diuersly. Wee see that there be some Houses, wherein
Sweet Meats will relent, and Baked Meats will mould, more than in
others; And Wainscoats will also sweat more; so that they will almost
run with Water: All which, (no doubt,) are caused chiefly by the
Moistnesse of the Aire, in those Seats. But because it is better to know
it, before a Man buildeth his House, than to finde it after, take the
Experiments following.</p>
<p>Lay Wooll, or a Sponge, or Bread, in the Place you would trie,
comparing it with some other Places; And see whether it doth not
moisten, and make the Wooll, or Sponge, andandandandc. more Ponderous,
than the other? And if it doe, you may iudge of that Place, as Situate
in a Grosse, and Moist Aire.</p>
<p>Because it is certaine, that in some Places, either by the Nature of
the Earth, or by the Situation of Woods, and Hills, the Aire is more
Vnequall, than in Others; and Inequalitie of Aire is euer an Enemy to
Health; It were good to take two Weather-Glasses, Matches in all things,
and to set them, for the same Houres of One day, in seuerall Places,
where no Shade is, nor Enclosures: And to marke, when you set them, how
farre the Water commeth; And to compare them, when you come againe, how
the Water standeth then: And if you finde them Vnequall, you may be sure
that the Place where the Water is lowest, is in the Warmer Aire, and the
other in the Colder. And the greater the Inequalitie be, of the Ascent,
or Descent of the Water, the greater is the Inequalitie of the Temper of
the Aire.</p>
<p>The Predictions likewise of Cold and Long Winters, and Hot and Drie
Summers, are good to be knowne; As well for the Discouerie of the
Causes, as for diuers Prouisions. That of Plenty of Hawes, and Heps, and
Briar-Berries, hath beene spoken of before. If Wainscast, or Stone, that
haue vsed to Sweat, be more drie, in the Beginning of Winter; Or the
Drops of the Eaues of Houses come more slowly downe, than they vse; it
portendeth a Hard and Frostie Winter. The Cause is, for that it sheweth
an Inclination of the Aire, to Drie Weather; which in Winter is euer
ioyned with Frost.</p>
<p>Generally, a Moist and Coole Summer, portendeth a Hard Winter. The
Cause is, for that the Vapours of the Earth, are not dissipated in the
Summer, by the Sunne; And so they rebound vpon the Winter.</p>
<p>A Hot and Drie Summer, and Autumne, and especially if the Heat and
Drought extend farre into September, portendeth an Open Beginning of
Winter; And Colds to succeed, toward the latter Part of the Winter, and
the Beginning of the Spring: For till then, the former Heat and Drought
beare the Sway; And the Vapours are not sufficiently Multiplied.</p>
<p>An Open and Warme Winter portendeth a Hot and Drie Summer: For the
Vapours disperse into the Winter Showres; Whereas Cold and Frost keepeth
them in, and transporteth them into the late Spring, and Summer
following.</p>
<p>Birds that vse to change Countries, at certaine Seasons, if they come
Earlier, doe shew the Temperature of Weather, according to that Country
whence they came: As the Winter-Birds, (namely Woodcocks, Feldefares,
andandandandc.) if they come earlier, and out of the Northerne
Countries, with vs shew Cold Winters. And if it be in the same Country,
then they shew a Temperature of Season, like vnto that Season in which
they come: As swallowes, Bats, Cuckooes, andandandandc. that come
towards Summer, if they come early, shew a Hot Summer to follow.</p>
<p>The Prognosticks, more Immediate, of Weather to follow soone after,
are more Certaine than those of Seasons. The Resounding of the Sea vpon
the Shoare; And the Murmur of Winds in the Woods, without apparent Wind;
shew Wind to follow: For such Winds, breathing chiefly out of the Earth,
are not at the first perceiued, except they be pent, by Water, or Wood.
And therefore a Murmur out of Caues likewise portendeth as much.</p>
<p>The Vpper Regions of the Aire, perceiue the Collection of the Matter
of Tempest, and Winds, before the Aire here below: And therefore the
Obscuring of the Smaller Starres is is a Signe of Tempests following.
And of this kinde you shall finde a Number of Instances in our
Inquisition De Ventis.</p>
<p>Great Mountaines haue a Perception of the Disposition of the Aire to
Tempests, sooner than the Valley’s or Plaines below: And therefore they
say in Wales, when certaine Hills haue their Night-Cups on, they meane
Mischiefe. The Cause is, for that Tempests, which are for the most part
bred aboue, in the Middle Region, (as they call it,) are soonest
perceiued to collect in the Places next it.</p>
<p>The Aire, and Fire, haue Subtill Perceptions of Wind Rising, before
Men finde it. Wee see the Trembling of a Candle will discouer a Wind
that otherwise wee doe not feele; And the Flexuous Burning of Flames
doth shew the Aire beginneth to be vnquiet; And so doe Coales of Fire by
Casting off the Ashes more than they vse. The Cause, is, for that no
Wind, at the first, till it hath strooke and driven the Aire, is
Apparent to the Sense: But Flame is easier to moue, than Aire: And for
the Ashes, it is no maruell, though Wind vnperceiued shake them off; For
wee vsually trie, which way the Wind bloweth, by casting vp Grasse, or
Chaffe, or such light Things, into the Aire.</p>
<p>When Wind expireth from vnder the Sea; As it causeth some Resounding
of the Water, (whereof wee spake before,) so it causeth some Light
Motions of Bubbles, and White Circles of Froth. The Cause is, for that
the Wind cannot be perceiued by the Sense, vntill there be an Eruption
of a great Quantitie, from vnder the Water; And so it getteth into a
Body: Whereas in the first Putting vp it commeth in little Portions.</p>
<p>We spake of the Ashes, that Coales cast off; And of Grasse, and
Chaffe carried by the Wind; So any Light Thing that moueth, when we
finde no Wind, sheweth a Wind at hand: As when Feathers, or Downe of
Thistles, fly to and fro in the Aire.</p>
<p>For Prognosticks of Weather from Liuing Creatures, it is to be noted;
That Creatures that Liue in the Open Aire, (Sub Diô,) must needs haue a
Quicker Impression from the Aire, than Men that liue most within Doores;
And especially Birds, who liue in the Aire, freest, and clearest; And
are aptest by their Voice to tell Tales, what they finde; And likewise
by the Motion of their Flight to expresse the same.</p>
<p>Water-Fowles, (as Sea-Gulls, More-Hens, andandandandc.) when they
flocke and fly together, from the Sea towards the Shores; And
contrariwise, LandBirds, (as Crowes, Swallowes, andandandandc.) when
they fly from the Land to the Waters, and beat the Waters with their
Wings; doe fore-shew Raine, and Wind. The Cause is, Pleasure, that both
Kindes take in the Moistnesse, and Density of the Aire: And so desire to
be in Motion, and vpon the Wing, whither soeuer they would otherwise
goe: For it is no Maruell, that Water-Fowle doe ioy most in that Aire,
which is likest Water; And LandBirds also, (many of them,) delight in
Bathing, and Moist Aire. For the same Reason also, many Birds doe proine
their Feathers; And Geese doe gaggle; And Crowes seeme to call vpon
Raine: All which is but the Comfort they seeme to receiue in the
Relenting of the Aire.</p>
<p>The Heron, when she foareth high, (so as sometimes she is seene to
passe ouer a Cloud,) sheweth Winds: But Kites flying aloft, shew Faire
and Dry Weather. The Cause may be, for that they both mount most into
the Aire, of that Temper, wherein they delight: And the Heron, being a
Water-Fowle, taketh pleasure in the Aire, that is Condensed: And
besides, being but Heauy of Wing, needeth the Helpe of the Grosser Aire.
But the Kite affecteth not so much the Grossenesse of the Aire, as the
Cold and Freshnesse thereof; For being a Bird of Prey, and therefore
Hot, she delighteth in the Fresh Aire; And (many times) flyeth against
the Wind; As Trouts, and Salmons swimme against the Streame. And yet it
is true also, that all Birds finde an Ease in the depth of the Aire; As
Swimmers doe in a Deepe Water. And therefore when they are aloft, they
can vphold themselues with their Wings Spred, scarce mouing them.</p>
<p>Fishes, when they play towards the Top of the Water, doe commonly
foretell Raine. The Cause is, for that a Fish hating the Dry, will not
approach the Aire, till it groweth Moist; And when it is Dry, will fly
it, and Swimme Lower.</p>
<p>Beasts doe take Comfort, (generally,) in a Moist Aire; And it maketh
them eat their Meat better: And therefore Sheepe will get vp betimes in
the Morning, to feed, against Raine: And Cattell, and Deere, and
Conneyes, will feed hard before Raine: And a Heifer, will put vp his
Nose, and snuffe in the Aire, against Raine.</p>
<p>The Trifoile, against Raine, swelleth in the Stalke; and so standeth
more vpright; For by Wet, Stalkes doe erect, and Leaues bow downe. I
here is a Small Red Flower in the Stubble-Fields, which Country People
call the Wincopipe; Which if it open in the Morning, you may be sure of
a faire Day to follow.</p>
<p>Euen in Men, Aches, and Hurts, and Cornes, doe engrieue, either
towards Raine, or towards Frost: For the One maketh the Humours more to
Abound; And the Other maketh them Sharper. So we see both Extremes bring
the Gout.</p>
<p>Wormes, Vermine, andandandandc. doe fore-shew (likewise) Raine: For
Earthwormes will come forth, and Moules will cast vp more, and Fleas
bite more, against Raine.</p>
<p>Solide Bodies likewise fore-shew Raine. As Stones, and Wainscot, when
they sweat: And Boxes, and Peggs of Wood, when they Draw, and Wind hard;
Though the Former be but from an Outward Cause; For that the Stone, or
Wainscot, turneth and beateth backe the Aire against it selfe; But the
latter is an Inward Swelling of the Body of the Wood it selfe.</p>
<p>Apetite is moued chiefly by Things that are Cold, and Dry: The Cause,
is for that Cold is a Kinde of Indigence of Nature, and calleth vpon
Supply; And so is Drinesse: And therefore all Soure Things, (as Vinegar,
Iuyce of Limons, Oyle of Vitrioll, andandandandc.) prouoke Appetite. And
the Disease, which they call Appetitus Caninus, consisteth in the Matter
of an Acide and Glassy Flegme, in the Mouth of the Stomach. Appetite is
also moued by Soure Things; For that Soure Things, induce a Contraction
in the Nerues, placed in the Mouth of the Stomach; Which is a great
Cause of Appetite. As for the Cause, why Onions, and Salt, and Pepper,
in Baked Meats, moue Appetite, it is by Vellication of those Nerues; For
Motion whetteth. As for Worme-Wood, Oliues, Capers, and others of that
kinde, which participate of Bitternesse, they moue Appetite by
Abstersion. So as there be foure Principall Causes of Appetite; The
Refrigeration of the Stomach, ioyned with some Drinesse; Contraction;
Vellication; And Abstersion: Besides Hunger, which is an Emptinesse: And
yet Ouer Fasting doth (many times) cause the Appetite to cease; For that
Want of Meat maketh the Stomach draw Humours; And such Humours as are
Light, and Cholericke, which quench Appetite most.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that where a Raine-Bow
seemeth no hang ouer, or to touch, there breatheth forth a Sweet Smell.
The Cause is, for that this happeneth but in certaine Matters, which
haue in themselues some Sweetnesse; Which the Gentle Dew of the
Raine-Bow doth draw forth. And the like doe Safe Showers; For they also
make the Ground Sweet: But none are so delicate as the Dew of the
Rain-bow, where it falleth. It may be also, that the Water it selfe bath
some Sweetnesse: For the Raine-Bow consisteth of a Glo — eration of
Small Drops, which cannot possibly fall, but from the Aire, that is very
Low: And therefore may hold the very Sweetnesse of the Herbs, and
Flowers, as a Distilled Water: For Raine, and other Dew, that fall from
high, cannot preserue the Smell, being dissipated in the drawing vp:
Neither doe we know, whether some Water it selfe, may not haue some
degree of Sweetnesse. It is true, that wee finde it sensibly in no
Poole, Riuer, nor Fountaine; But good Earth, newly turned vp, hath a
Freshnesse, and good Sent; Which water, if it be not too Equall, (For
Equall Obiects neuer moue the Sense.) may also haue. Certaine it is,
that Bay-Salt, which is but a kinde of Water Congealed, will sometimes
smell like Violets.</p>
<p>To Sweet Smells Heat is requisite, to Concoct the Matter; And some
Moisture to Spread the Breath of them. For Heat, we see that Woods, and
Spices, are more Odorate in the Hot Countries, than in the Cold: For
Moisture, we see that Things too much Dried, lose their Sweetnesse: And
Flowers growing, smell better in a Morning, or Euening, than at Noone.
Some Sweet Smells are destroyed by Approach to the Fire; As Violets,
Wall-Flowers, Gilly-Flowers, Pinckes; And generally all Flowers that
haue Coole and Delicate Spirits. Some continue both on the Fire, and
from the Fire, As Rose-Water, andandandandc. Some doe scarce come forth,
or at least not so pleasantly, as by meanes of the Fire; as Iuniper,
Sweet Gums, andandandandc. And all Smells, that are Enclosed in a Fast
Body: But (generally) those Smells are the most Gratefull, where the
Degree of Heat is Small; Or where the Strength of the Smell is allayed;
For these Things doe rather wooe the Sense, than Satiate it. And
therefore the Smell of Violets, and Roses, exceedeth in Sweetnesse that
of Spices, and Gummes; And the Strongest Sort of Smells, are best in a
weft, a farre off.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that no Smell issueth, but with Emission of some
Corporeall Substance; Not as it is in Light, and Colours, and in Sounds.
For wee see plainly, that Smell doth spread nothing that distance, that
the other doe. It is true, that some Woods of Orenges, and Heathes of
Rose-Mary, will Smell a great way into the Sea, perhaps twenty Miles;
But what is that, since a Peale of Ordnance will do as much, which
moueth in a small compasse? Whereas those Woods, and Heathes, are of
Vast Spaces: Besides we see that Smells doe adhere to Hard Bodies; As in
Persuming of Gloues, andandandandc. which sheweth them Corporeall; And
doe Last a great while, which Sounds, and Light doe not.</p>
<p>The Excrements of most Creatures Smell ill; Chiefly to the same
Creature that voideth them: For we see, besides that of Man, that
Pigeons, and Horses thriue best, if their Houses, and Stables be kept
Sweet; And so of Cage-Birds: And the Cat burieth that which shee
voideth: And it holdeth chiefly in those Beasts, which feed vpon
Flesh.Dogs (almost) onely of Beasts, delight in Fetide Odours; Which
sheweth there is somewhat in their Sense of Smell, differing from the
Smells of other Beasts. But the Cause, why Excrements smell ill, is
manifest; For that the Body it selfe reiecteth them; Much more the
Spirits: And we see, that those Excrements, that are of the First
Digestion; Smell the worst; As the Excrements from the Belly: Those that
are from the Second Digestion, lesse ill; As Vrine; And those that are
from the Third, yet lesse; For Sweat is not so bad, as the other two;
Especially of some Persons, that are full of Heat. Likewise most
Putrefactions are of an Odious Smell: For they smell either Fetide, or
Mouldy. The Cause may be, for that Putrefaction doth bring forth such a
Consistence, as is most Contrary to the Consistence of the Body, whilst
it is Sound: For it is a meere dissolution of that Forme. Besides, there
is another Reason which is Profound: And it is, that the Obiects that
please any of the Senses, haue (all) some Equality, and (as it were)
Order, in their Composition: But where those are wanting, the Obiect is
euer Ingrate. So Mixture of many Disagreeing Colours is euer vnpleasant
to the Eye: Mixture of Discordant Sounds is vnpleasant to the Eare:
Mixture, or Hotch-Potch of many Tastes, is vnpleasant to the Taste:
Harshnesse and Ruggednesse of Bodies, is vnpleasant to the Touch: Now it
is certaine, that all Putrefaction, being a Dissolution of the first
Forme, is a meere Confusion, and Vnformed Mixture of the Part.
Neuerthelesse, it is strange, and seemeth to Crosse the former
Obseruation, that some Putrefactions and Excrements doe yeeld Excellent
Odours; As Ciuet, and Muske; And as some thinke Amber-Greece: For diuers
take it, (though vnprobably,) to come from the Sperme of Fish: And the
Mosse, wee spake of from Apple-Trees, is little better than an
Excretion. The Reason may be, for that there passeth in the Excrements,
and remaineth in the Putrefactions, some good Spirits; especially where
they proceed from Creatures, that are very Hot. But it may be also
ioyned with a further Cause, which is more Subtill; And it is, that the
Senses loue not to be Ouerpleased; But to haue a C —— — of somewhat is
in it selfe Ingrate. Certainly, we see how Discords in Musicke, falling
vpon Concords, make the Sweetest Straines: And we see againe, what
Strange Tastes delight the Taste; As Red-Herrings, Caueary, Parmizan,
andandandandc. And it may be, the same holdeth in Smells. For those
kinde of Smells, that we haue mentioned, are all Strong, and doe Pull
and Vellicate the Sense. And wee finde also, that Places where Men
Vrine, commonly haue some smell of Violets: And Vrine, if one hath eaten
Nutmegge, hath so too.</p>
<p>The Sloathfull, Generall, and Indefinite Contemplations, and Notions,
of the Elements, and their Coniugations; Of the Influences of Heauen; Of
Heat, Cold, Moisture, Drought; Qualities, Active, Passive; And the like;
haue swallowed vp the true Passages, and Processes, and Affects, and
Consistences of Matter, and Naturall Bodies. Therefore they are to be
set aside, being but Notionall, and ill Limited; And Definite Axiomes
are to be drawne out of Measured Instances: And so Assent to be made to
the more Generall Axiomes, by Scale. And of these Kindes of Processes of
Natures, and Characters of Matter, we will now set downe some
Instances.</p>
<p>All Putrefactions come chiefly from the Inward Spirits of the Body;
And partly also from the Ambient Body, be it Aire, Liquour, or
whatsoeuer else. And this last, by two Meanes: Either by Ingresse of the
Substance of the Ambient Body, into the Body Putrified; Or by Excitation
and Sollicitation of the Body Putrified, and the Parts thereof, by the
Body Ambient. As for the Receiued Opinion, that Putrefaction is caused,
either by Cold, or Peregrine and Preternaturall Heat, it is but
Nugation: For Cold in Things Inanimate, is the greatest Enemy that is,
to Putrefaction; though it extinguisheth Viuification, which euer
consisteth in Spirits Attenuate. which the Cold doth congeale, and
coagulate. And as for the Peregrins Heat, it is thus farre true; That if
the Proportion of the Aduentiue Heat, be greatly Predominant, to the
Naturall Heat, and Spirits of the Body, it tendeth to Dissolution, or
Notable Alteration. But this is wrought by Emission, or Suppression, or
Suffocation, of the Natiue Spirits; And also by the Disordination, and
Discomposture of the Tangible Parts; And other Passages of Nature; And
not by a Conflict of Heats.</p>
<p>In Versions, or Maine Alterations of Bodies, there is a Medium
between the Body, as it is at first, and the Body Resulting; which
Medium is Corpus imperfectè Mistum, and is Transitory, and not durable;
As Mists, Smoaks, Vapours, Chylus in the Stomach, Liuing Creatures in
the first Vinification: And the Middle Action, which produceth such
Imperfect Bodies, is fitly called, (by some of the Ancients,)
Inquination, or Inconcoction, which is a Kinde of Putrefaction; For the
Parts are in Confusion, till they settle, one way, or other.</p>
<p>The word Concoction, or Digestion, is chiefly taken into vse from
Liuing Creatures, and their Organs; And from thence extended to
Liquours, and Fruits, andandandandc. Therefore they speake of Meat
Concocted; Vrine and Excrements Concocted; And the Foure Disgestions,
(In the Stomach; In the Liuer; In the Arteries and Nerues; And in the
Seuerall Parts of the Body;) are likewise called Concoctions: And they
are all made to be the Workes of Heat: All which Notions are but
ignorant Catches of a few Things, which are most Obuious to Mens
Obseruations. The Constantest Notion of Concoction is, that it should
signifie the Degrees of Alteration, of one Body into another, from
Crudity to Perfect Concoction; Which is the Vltimity of that Action, or
Processe: And while the Body to be Conuerted and Altered, is too strong
for the Efficient, that should Conuert, or Alter it, (whereby it
resisteth and holdeth fast in some degree the first Forme, or
Consistence;) it is (all that while,) Crude, and Inconcoct; And the
Processe is to be called Crudity and Inconcoction. It is true, that
Concoction is, in great part, the Worke of Heat; But not the Worke of
Heat alone: For all Things, that further the Conuersion, or Alteration,
(as Rest, Mixture of a Body already Concocted, andandandandc.) are also
Meanes to Concoction. And there are of Concoction two Periods; The one
Assimilation, or Absolute Conuersion and Subaction; The other
Maturation: whereof the Former is most conspicuous in the Bodies of
Liuing Creatures; In which there is an Absolute Conuersion, and
Assimilation of the Nourishment into the Body: And likewise in the
Bodies of Plants: And againe in Metalls, where there is a full
Transmutation. The other, (which is Maturation,) is seene in Liquours,
and Fruits; wherein there is not desired, nor pretended, an vtter
Conuersion, but onely an Alteration to that Forme, which is most sought,
for Mans vse; As in Clarifying of Drinkes; Ripening of Fruits,
andandandandc. But note, that there be two Kindes of Absolute
Conuersions; The one is, when a Body is conuerted into another Body,
which was before; As when Nourishment is turned into Flesh; That is it
which wee call Assimilation. The other is, when the Conuersion is into a
Body meerely New, and which was not before; As if Siluer should be
turned to Gold; or Iron to Copper: And this Conuersion is better called,
for distinctions sake, Transmutation.</p>
<p>There are also diuers other Great Alterations of Matter, and Bodies,
besides those that tend to Concoction, and Maturation; For whatsoeuer
doth so alter a Body, as it returneth not againe to that it was, may be
called Alteratio Maior: As when Meat is Boyled, or Roasted, or Fried,
andandandandc. Or when Bread and Meat are Baked; Or when Cheese is made
of Curds, or Butter of Creame, or Goales of wood, or Brickes of Earth;
And a Number of others. But to apply Notions Philosophicall to Plebcian
Termes; Or to say, where the Notions cannot fitly be reconciled, that
there wanteth a Terme, or Nomenclature for it; (as the Ancients vsed;)
They be but Shifts of Ignorance; For Knowledge will be euer a Wandring
and Indigested Thing, if it be but a Commixture of a few Notions, that
are at hand and occurre, and not excited from sufficient Number of
Instances, and those well collated.</p>
<p>The Consistences of Bodies are very diuers: Dense, Rare; Tangible,
Pneumaticall, Volatile, Fixed; Determinate, Not Determinate, Hard, Soft;
Cleauing, Not Cleauing; Congealeable, Not Congealeable; Liquefiable, Not
Liquefiable; Fragile, Tough; Flexible Inflexible; Tractile, or to be
drawen forth in length, Intractile; Porous, Solide; Equall, and Smooth,
Vnequall, Venous, and Fibrous, and with Graines, Entire; And diuers
Others; All which to referre to Heat, and Cold; and Moisture, and
Drought, is a Compendious and Inutile Speculation. But of these see
principally our Abecedarium Nature; And otherwise Sparfim in this in our
Sylua Syluarum: Neuerthelesse in some good part, We shall handle diuers
of them now presently.</p>
<p>Liquefiable, and Not Liquefiable, proceed from these Causes:
Liquefaction is euer caused by the Detention of the Spirits, which play
within the Body, and Open it. Therefore such Bodies, as are more Turgide
of Spirit; Or that haue their Spirits more Sraitly Imprisoned; Or againe
that hold them Better Pleased and Content; are Liquefiable: For these
three Dispositions of Bodies, doe arrest the Emission of the Spirits. An
Example of the first two Properties is in Metalls; And of the Last in
Grease, Pitch, Sulphure, Butter, Wax, andandandandc. The Disposition not
to Liquefie proceedeth from the Easie Emission of the Spirits; whereby
the Grosser Parts contract; And therefore, Bodies Ieiune of Spirits; Or
which part with their Spirits more Willingly; are not Liquefiable; As
Wood, Clay, Freestone, andandandandc. But yet, euen many of those
Bodies, that will not Melt, or will hardly Melt, will notwithstanding
Soften; As Iron in the Forge; And a Sticke bathed in Hot Ashes, which
thereby becommeth more Flexible. Moreouer, there are some Bodies, which
doe Liquefie, or dissolue by Fire; As Metalls, Wax, andandandandc. And
other Bodies, which dissolue in Water; As Salt, Sugar, andandandandc.
The Cause of the former proceedeth from the Dilatation of the Spirits by
Heat: The Cause of the Latter proceedeth from the Opening of the
Tangible Parts, which desire to receiue the Liquour. Againe, there are
some Bodies, that dissolue with both; As Gumme, andandandandc. And those
be such Bodies, as on the One Side haue good store of Spirit; And on the
other Side, haue the Tangible Parts Indigent of Moisture; For the former
helpeth to the Dilating of the Spirits by the Fire; And the Latter
stimulateth the Parts to Receiue the Liquour.</p>
<p>Of Bodies, some are Fragile; And some are Tough, and Not Fragile; And
in the Breaking, some Fragile Bodies breake but where the Force is; Some
shatter and fly in many Peeces. Of Fragility the Cause is an Impotency
to be Extended: And therefore Stone is more Fragile than Metall; And so
Fictile Earth is more Fragile than Crude Earth; And Dry Wood than
Greene. And the Cause of this Vnaptnesse to Extension, is the Small
Quantity of Spirits; (For it is the Spirit that furthereth the Extension
or Dilatation of Bodies;) And it is euer Concomitant with Porosity, and
with Drinesse in the Tangible Parts: Contrariwise, Tough Bodies haue
more Spirit, and sewer Pores, and Moister Tangible Parts: Therefore wee
see that Parchment, or Leather will stretch, Paper will not; Woollen
Cloth will tenter, Linnen scarcely.</p>
<p>All Solide Bodies consist of Parts of two seuerall Natures;
Pneumaticall, and Tangible; And it is well to be noted, that the
Pneumaticall Substance is in some Bodies, the Nature Spirit of the Body;
And in some other, plaine Aire that is gotten in; As in Bodies
desiccate, by Heat, or Age: For in them, when the Natiue Spirit goeth
forth, and the Moisture with it, the Aire with time getteth into the
Pores. And those Bodies are euer the more Fragile; For the Natiue Spirit
is more Yeelding, and Extensiue, (especially to follow the Parts,) than
Aire. The Natiue Spirits also admit great Diuersitie; As Hot, Cold,
Active, Dull, andandandandc. Whence proceed most of the Vertues, and
Qualities (as wee call them) of Bodies: But the Aire intermixt, is
without Vertues, and maketh Things Infioide, and without any
Extimulation.</p>
<p>The Concretion of Bodies is (commonly) solued by the Contrary; As
Ice, which is congealed by Gold, is dissolued by Heat; Salt and Sugar,
which are Excocted by Heat, are Dissolued by Cold, and Moisture. The
Cause is, for that these Operations, are rather Returnes to their former
Nature, than Alterations: So that the Contrary cureth. As for Oyle, it
doth neither easily congeale with Cold, nor thicken with Heat. The Cause
of both Effects, though they be produced by Contrary Efficients, seemeth
to be the Same; And that is, because the Spirit of the Oyle, by either
Meanes, exhaleth little; For the Cold keepeth it in; and the Heat,
(except it be Vehement,) doth not call it forth. As for Cold, though it
take hold of the Tangible Parts, yet as to the Spirits, it doth rather
make them Swell, than Congeale them: As when Ice is congealed in a Cup,
the Ice will Swell in stead of Contracting; And sometimes Rift.</p>
<p>Of Bodies, some (wee see) are Hard, and some Soft: The Hardnesse is
caused (chiefly) by the Ieiunenesse of the Spirits; And their Imparitie
with the Tangible Parts: Both which, if they be in a greater degree,
maketh them, not only Hard, but Fragile, and lesse Enduring of Pressure;
As Steele, Stone, Glasse, Drie Wood, andandandandc.Softnesse commeth
(contrariwise) by the Greater Quantitie of Spirits; (which euer helpeth
to Induce Yeelding and Cession;) And by the more Equall Spreading of the
Tangible Parts, which thereby are more Sliding, and Following; As in
Gold, Lead, Wax, andandandandc. But note, that Soft Bodies, (as wee vse
the word,) are of two Kinds; The one, that easily glueth place to
another Body, but altereth not Bulke, by Rising in other Places: And
therefore wee see that Wax, if you put any Thing into it, doth not rise
in Bulke, but only giueth Place: For you may not thinke, that in
Printing of Wax, the Wax riseth vp at all; But only the depressed Part
giueth place, and the other remaineth as it was. The other, that
altereth Bulke in the Cession; As Water, or other Liquours, if you put a
Stone, or any Thing into them, they giue place (indeed) easily, but then
they rise all ouer: Which is a False Cession; For it is in Place, and
not in Body.</p>
<p>All Bodies Ductile, and Tensile, (as Metals that will be drawne into
Wires; Wooll and Towe that will be drawne into Yarne, or Thred;) haue in
them the Appetite of Not Discontinuing, Strong; Which maketh them follow
the Force, that pulleth them out; And yet so, as not to Discontinue or
forsake their owne Body.Viscous Bodies, (likewise,) as Pitch, Wax,
Bird-Lime, Cheese toasted, will draw forth, and roape. But the
difference betweene Bodies Fibrous, and Bodies Viscous, is Plaine; For
all Wooll, and Towe, and Cotton, and Silke, (especially raw Silke,)
haue, besides their Desire of Continuance, in regard of the Tenuitie of
their Thred, a Greedinesse of Moisture; And by Moisture to ioyne and
incorporate with other Thred; Especially if there be a little Wreathing;
As appeareth by the Twisting of Thred; And the Practise of Twirling
about of Spindles. And wee see also, that Gold and Siluer Thred cannot
be made without Twisting.</p>
<p>The Differences of Impressible; and Not Impressible Figurable; and
Not Figurable; Mouldable and Not Mouldable; Scissile and Not Scissile;
And many other Passions of Matter, are Plebcian Notions, applied vnto
the Instruments and Vses which Men ordinarily practise; But they are all
but the Effects of some of these Causes following; Which we will
Enumerate without Applying them, because that would be too long. The
First is the Cession, or Not Cession of Bodies, into a Smaller Space or
Roome, keeping the Outward Bulke, and not flying vp. The Second is the
Stronger or Weaker Appetite, in Bodies, to Continuitie, and to flie
Discontinuitie. The Third is the Disposition of Bodies, to Contract, or
Not Contract; And againe, to Extend, or Not Extend. The Fourth is the
Small Quantitie, or Great Quantitie, of the Pneumaticall in Bodies. The
Fifth is the Nature of the Pneumalicall, whether is — Natiue Spirit of
the Body, or Common Aire. The Sixth is, the Nature of the Natiue Spirits
in the Body, whether they be Actiue and Eager, or Dull and Gentle. The
Seuenth is the Emission or Detention of the Spirits in Bodies. The
Eighth is the Dilatation, or Contraction of the Spirits in Bodies, while
they are detained. The Ninth is the Collocation of the Spirits in
Bodies; whether the Collocation be Equall, or Vnequall; And againe,
whether the Spirits be Coaceruate, or Diffused. The Tenth is the
Densitie, or Raritie of the Tangible Parts. The Eleuenth is the
Equalitie or Inequalitie of the Tangible Parts. The Twelfth is the
Disgestion, or Cruditie of the Tangible Parts. The Thirteenth is the
Nature of the Matter, whether Sulphureous or Mercuriall, Watrie or
Oylie, Drie and Terrestriall, or Moìst and Liquid; which Natures of
Sulphureous and Mercuriall, seeme to be Natures Radicall, and
Principiall. The Fourteenth is the Placing of the Tangible Parts, in
Length, or Transuerse; (As it is in the Warpe, and the Woofe, of
Textiles;) More Inward, or More Outward; andandandandc. The Fifteenth is
the Porofitie, or Imporositie betwixt the Tangible Parts; And the
Greatnesse, or Smalnesse of the Pores. The Sixteenth is the Collocation
and Pesture of the Pores. There may be more Causes; but these doe
occurre for the Present.</p>
<p>Take Lead, and melt it, and in the Middest of it, when it beginneth
to Congeale, make a little Dint, or Hole, and put Quicke-Siluer wrapped
in a Peece of Linnen into that Hole, and the Quicke-Siluer will fix, and
run no more, and endure the Hammer. This is a Noble Instance of
Induration, by Consent of one Body with another, and Motion of
Excitation to Imitate; For to ascribe it only to the Vapour of Lead, is
lesse Probable. Quare whether the Fixing may be in such a degree, as it
will be Figured like other Metals? For if so, you may make Works of it
for some purposes, so they come not neere the Fire.</p>
<p>Sugar hath put downe the vse of Honey; Insomuch as wee haue lost
those Obseruations, and Preparations of Honey, which the Ancients had,
when it was more in Price. First, it seemeth that there was, in old
time, Tree-Honey, as well as Bee-Honey; Which was the Teare or Bloud
issuing from the Tree: Insomuch as one of the Ancients relateth, that in
Trebisond, there was Honey issuing from the Box-Trees, which made Men
Mad. Againe, in Ancient time, there was a Kinde of Honey, which either
of the owne Nature, or by Art, would grow as Hard as Sugar; And was not
so Lushious as Ours. They had also a Wine of Honey, which they made
thus. They crushed the Honey into a great Quantitie of Water, and then
strained the Liquour; After they boyled it in a Copper to the halfe:
Then they powred it into Earthen Vessels, for a small time; And after
tunned it into Vessels of Wood, and kept it for many years. They haue
also, at this day, in Russia, and those Northerne Countries, Mead
Simple, which (well made, and seasoned) is a good wholesome Drinke, and
very Cleare. They vse also in Wales, a Compound Drinke of Mead, with
Herbs, and Spices. But meane-while it were good, in recompence of that
wee haue lost in Honey, there were brought in vse a Sugar Mead- (for so
wee may call it,) though without any Mixture at all of Honey; And to
brew it, and keepe it stale, as they vse Mead; For certainly, though it
would not be so Abster siue, and Opening, and Solutiue a Drinke as Mead;
yet it will be more gratefull to the Stomach, and more Lenitiue, and fit
to be vsed in Sharpe Diseases. For wee see, that the vse of Sugar in
Beere, and Ale, hath good Effects in such Cases.</p>
<p>It is reported by the Ancients, that there was a Kinde of Steele, in
some places, which would polish almost as white and bright as Siluer.
And that there was in India a Kinde of Brasse, which (being polished)
could scarce be discerned from Gold. This was in the Naturall Vre; But I
am doubtfull, whether Men haue sufficiently refined Metals, which we
count Base; As whether Iron, Brasse, and Tinne, be refined to the
Heighth? But when they come to such a Finenesse, as serueth the ordinary
vse, they trie no further.</p>
<p>There haue beene found certaine Cements vnder Earth, that are very
Soft; And yet, taken forth into the Sunne, harden as Hard as Marble:
There are also ordinary Quarries in Sommerset-Shire, which in the Quarry
cut soft to any Bignesse, and in the Building proue firme, and hard.</p>
<p>Liuing Creatures (generally) doe change their Haire with Age, turning
to be Gray, and White: As is seene in Men, though some Earlier, some
Later; In Horses, that are Dappled, and turne White; In Old Squirrels,
that turne Grisly; And many Others. So doe some Birds; As Cygnets; from
Gray turne White; Hawkes, from Browne turne more White: And some Birds
there be, that vpon their Moulting, doe turne Colour; As
Robin-Redbrests, after their Moulting, grow to be Red againe, by
degrees; So doe Gold-Finches vpon the Head. The Cause is, for that
Moisture doth (chiefly) colour Haire, and Feathers; And Drinesse turneth
them Gray and White; Now Haire in Age waxeth Drier: So doe Feathers. As
for Feathers, after Moulting, they are Young Feathers, and so all one as
the Feathers of Young Birds. So the Beard is younger than the Haire of
the Head, and doth (for the most part,) wax Hoare later. Out of this
Ground, a Man may deuise the Meanes of Altering the Colour of Birds, and
the Retardation of Heare-Haires. But of this see the fifth
Experiment.</p>
<p>The Difference betweene Male and Female, in some Creatures, is not to
be discerned, otherwise than in the Parts of Generation: As in Horses
and Mares, Dogs and Bitches, Doues He and She, and others. But some
differ in Magnitude, and that diuersly; For in most the Male is the
greater; As in Man, Pheasants, Peacocks, Turkey’s; and the like: And in
some few, as in Hawkes, the Female. Some differ in the Haire, and
Feathers, both in the Quantitie, Crispation, and Colours of them; As
He-Lions are Mi-sute, and haue great Maines; The She’s are smooth like
Cats. Bulls are more Crispe vpon the Fore-head than Cowes; The Peacocke,
and Pheasant-Cocke, and Gold-Finch-Cocke, haue glorious and fine
Colours; The Henn’s haue not. Generally, the Hees in Birds haue the
fairest Feathers. Some differ in diuers Features; As Bucks haue Hornes,
Doe’s none; Rammes haue more wreathed Hornes than Ewes; Cocks haue great
Combes and Spurres, Henns little or none; Boares haue great Fangs, Sowes
much lesse; The TurkyCocke hath great and Swelling Gills, the Hen hath
lesse; Men haue generally Deeper and Stronger Voices than Women. Some
differ in Facultie; As the Cocks amongst Singing Birds, are the best
Singers. The Chiefe Cause of all these, (no doubt,) is, for that the
Males haue more Strength of Heat than the Females; Which appeareth
manifestly in this, that all young Creatures Males, are like Females;
And so are Eunuchs, and Gelt Creatures of all kinds, liker Females. Now
Heat causeth Greatnesse of Growth, generally, where there is Moisture
enough to worke vpon: But if there be found in any Creature, (which is
seene rarely,) an Ouer-great Heat in proportion to the Moisture, in them
the Female is the greater; As in Hawkes, and Sparrowes. And if the Heat
be ballanced with the Moisture, then there is no Difference to be seene
betweene Male and Female: As in the Instances of Horses, and Dogs. Wee
see also, that the Hornes of Oxen, and Cowes, for the most part, are
Larger than the Bulls; which is caused by abundance of Moisture, which
in the Hornes of the Bull faileth- Againe, Heat causeth Pilosuy, and
Crispation; And so likewise Beards in Men. It also expelleth finer
Moisture which Want of Heat cannot Expell: And that is the Cause of the
Beauty and Variety of Feathers: Againe, Heat doth put forth many
Excreseences, and much Solide Matter, which Want of Heat cannot do: And
this is the Cause of Hornes, and of the Greatnesse of them; And of the
Greatnesse of the Combes and Spurres of Cocks, Gills of Turky-Cocks, and
Fangs of Boares. Heat also dilateth the Pipes, and Organs, which causeth
the Deepnesse of the Voice. Againe, Heat refineth the Spirits, and that
causeth the Cock-Singing Bird, to Excell the Hen.</p>
<p>There be Fishes greater than any Beasts; As the Whale is farre
greater than the Elephant. And Beasts are (generally) greater than
Birds. For Fishes, the Cause may be, that because they Liue not in the
Aire, they haue not their Moisture drawne and Soaked by the Aire, and
Sun-Beames. Also they rest alwaies, in a manner, and are supported by
the Water, whereas Motion and Labour doe consuine. As for the Greatnesse
of Beasts, more than of Birds, it is caused, for that Beasts stay Longer
time in the Wombe, than Birds, and there Nourish, and Grow; Whereas in
Birds, after the Egge Lay’d, there is no further Growth, or Nourishment
from the Female: For the Sitting doth Vinifie, and not Nourish.</p>
<p>We haue partly touched before the Meanes of Producing Fruits, without
Coares, or Stones. And this we adde further, that the Cause must be
Abundance of Moisture; For that the Coare, and Stone are made of a Dry
Sap-. And we see that it is possible, to make a Tree put forth onely in
Blossome, without Fruit; As in Cherries with Double Flowers; Much more
into Fruit without Stone, or Coares. It is reported, that a Cions of an
Apple, grafted vpon a Colo — Stalke, sendeth forth a great Apple without
a Coare. It is not vnlikely, that if the Inward Pith of a Tree, were
taken out, so that the Iuyce came onely by the Barke, it would worke the
Effect. For it hath beene obserued, that in Pollards, if the Water get
in on the Top, and they become Hollow, they put forth the more. We adde
also, that it is deliuered for certaine by some, that if the Cions be
grafted, the Small End downwards, it will make Fruit haue little or no
Coares, and Stones.</p>
<p>Tobacco is a thing of great Price, if it be in request; For an — of
it will be worth, (as is affirmed,) two Hundred Pounds, by the yeare,
towards Charge. The Charge of making the Ground and otherwise, is great,
but nothing to the Profit. But the English Tobacco, hath small credit,
as being too Dull, and Eartby, Nay the —— Tobacco; though that be in a
Hotter Climate, can get no credit, for the same — that a Triall to make
Tobacco more Aromaticall, and better Concocted here in England, were a
Thing of great profit. Some haue gone about to doe it by Drenching the
English Tobacco, in a Decoction or Infusion of Indian Tobacco: But those
are but Sophistications, and Toyes; For Nothing that is once Perfect,
and hath run his Race, can receiue much Amendment. You must euer resort
to the Beginnings of Things for Melioration. The Way of Maturation of
Tobacco must, as in other Plants, be, from the Heat, Either of the
Earth, or of the Sunne: We see some Leading of this in Musk-Melons;
which are sowen vpon a Hot Bed, Dunged below, vpon a Bancke turned vpon
the South Sunne, to giue Heat by Reflexion; Laid vpon Tiles, which
increaseth the Heat, And Couered with Straw to keepe them from Cold.
They remoue them also, which addeth some Life: And by these Helpes they
become as good in England, as in Italy, or Prouence. These, and the like
Meanes, may be tried in Tobacco. Enquire also of the Steeping of the
Roots, in some such Liquour, as may giue them Vigour to put forth
Strong.</p>
<p>Heat of the Sunne, for the Maturation of Fruits; Yea and the Heat of
Viuification of Liuing Creatures; are both represented and supplied, by
the Heat of Fire; And likewise, the Heats of the Sunne, and Life, are
represented one by the other.Trees, set vpon the Backes of Chimneyes,
doe ripen Fruit sooner. Vines, that haue beene drawne in at the Window
of a Kitchen, haue sent forth Grapes ripe a Month (at least) before
others. Stoues, at the Backe of Walls, bring forth Orenges here with
vs. Egges, as is reported by some, haue beene hatched in the warmth of
an Ouen. It is reported by the Ancients, that the Estrich Layeth her Egs
vnder Sand, where the Heat of the Sunne disclosed them.</p>
<p>Barley in the Boyling swelleth not much; Wheat swelleth more; Rize
extremely; In so much as a Quarter of a Pint (vnboyled) will arise to a
Pint boyled. The Cause (no doubt) is, for that the more Close and
Compact the Body is, the more it will dilate: Now Barley is the most
Hollow; Wheat more Solide than that; and Rize most Solide of all. It may
be also that some Bodies haue a Kinde of Lentour, and more Depertible
Nature than others; As we see it Euident in Colouration; For a Small
Quantity of Saffron, will Tinct more, than a very great Quantity of
Bresill, or Wine.</p>
<p>Fruit groweth Sweet by Rowling, or Pressing them gently with the
Hand; As Rowling-Peares, Damasins, andandandandc. By Rottennesse; As
Medlars, Seruickes, Sloe’s, Heps, andandandandc. By Time; As Apples,
Wardens, Pomgranats, andandandandc. By certaine Speciall Maturations; As
by Laying them in Hay, Straw, andandandandc. And by Fire; As in
Roasting, Stewing, Baking, andandandandc. The Cause of the Sweetnesse by
Rowling, and Pressing, is Emollition, which they properly enduce; As in
Beating of Stock-Fish, Flesh, andandandandc. By Rottennesse is, for that
the Spirits of the Fruit, by Putrefaction, gather Heat, and thereby
disgest the Harder Part: For in all Putrefactions, there is a Degree of
Heat. By Time and Keeping is, because the Spirits of the Body, doe euer
feed vpon the Tangible Parts, and attenuate them. By Seuerall
Maturations is, by some Degree of Heat. And by Fire is, because it is
the Proper Worke of Heat to Refine, and to Incorporate; And all
Sourenesse consisteth in some Grossenesse of the Body: And all
Incorporation doth make the Mixture of the Body, more Equall, in all the
Parts; Which euer induceth a Milder Taste.</p>
<p>Of Fleshes, some are Edible; Some, except it be in Famine, not. For
those that are not Edible, the Cause is, for that they haue (commonly)
too much Bitternesse of Taste; And therefore those Creatures, which are
Fierce and Cholerick, are not Edible; As Lions, Wolnes, Squirrells,
Dogs, Foxes, Horses, andandandandc. As for Kine, Sheepe, Goats, Deere,
Swine, Conneyes, Hares, andandandandc. We see they are Milde, and
Fearefull. Yet it is true, that Horses, which are Beasts of Courage,
haue beene, and are eaten by some Nations; As the Scythians were called
Hippophagi; And the Chineses eat Horse-flesh at this day; And some
Gluttons haue vsed to haue Colts-flesh baked. In Birds, such as are
Carniuor a, and Birds of Prey, are commonly no Good Meat; But the Reason
is, rather the Cholerick Nature of those Birds, than their Feeding vpon
Flesh; For Puits, Gulls, Shouelers, Duckes, doe feed vpon Flesh, and yet
are Good Meat: And wee see, that those Birds, which are of Prey, or feed
vpon Flesh, are good Meat, when they are very Young; As Hawkes, Rookes
out of the Neast, Owles, andandandandc. Mans Flesh is not Eaten. The
Reasons are Three: First, because Men in Humanity doe abhorre it:
Secondly, because no Liuing Creature, that Dyeth of it selfe, is good to
Eat: And therefore the Ca — (themselues) eat no Mans-flesh, of those
that Dye of Themselues, but of such as are Slaine. The Third is, because
there must be (generally) some Disparity, between the Nourishment, and
the Body Nourished; And they must not be Ouer-neere, or like: Yet we
see, that in great Weaknesses, and Consumptions, Man haue beene
sustained with Womans Milke: And Ficinus fondly (as I conceiue)
aduiseth, for the Prolongation of Life, that a Veine be opened in the
Arme of some wholesome Young Man; And the Bloud to be sucked. It is
said, that Witches doe greedily eat Mens flesh; which if it be true,
besides a Diuellish Appetite in them, it is likely to proceed, for that
Mans flesh may send vp High and Pleasing Vapours, which may stirre the
Imagination; And Witches Felicity is chiefly in Imagination, as hath
beene said.</p>
<p>There is an Ancient Receiued Tradition of the Salamander, that it
liueth in the Fire, and hath force also to extinguish the Fire. It must
haue two Things, if it be true, to this Operation: The One a very Close
Skin, whereby Flame, which in the Midst is not so hot, cannot enter: For
we see that if the Palme of the Hand be annointed thicke with White of
Egge, and then Aquanita be poured vpon it, and Enflamed, yet one may
endure the Flame a pretty while. The other is some Extreme Cold and
Quenching vertue, in the Body of that Creature, which choaketh the Fire.
We see that Milke quencheth Wilde-Fire, better than Water, because it
entreth better.</p>
<p>Time doth change Fruit, (as Apples, Peares, Pomgranats,
andandandandc.) from more Soure, to more Sweet: But contrariwise
Liquours, (euen those that are of the Iuyce of Fruit,) from more Sweet
to more Soure; As Wort, Must, New Veriuyce, andandandandc. The Cause is,
the Congregation of the Spirits together: For in both Kindes, the Spirit
is attenuated by Time; But in the first Kinde, it is more Diffused, and
more Mastered by the Grosser Parts, which the Spirits doe but disgest:
But in Drinkes the Spirits doe raigne, and finding lesse Opposition of
the Parts, become themselues more Strong; Which causeth also more
Strength in the Liquour; Such, as if the Spirits be of the Hotter Sort,
the Liquour becommeth apt to Burne; But in Time, it causeth likewise,
when the Higher Spirits are Euapourated, more Sourenesse.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Plates of Metall, and
especially of Brasse, applied presently to a Blow, will keepe it downe
from Swelling. The Cause is Repercussion, without Humectation, or
Entrance of any Body: for the Plate hath onely a Virtuall Cold, which
doth not search into the Hurt; Whereas all Plasters, and Ointments doe
enter. Surely, the Cause, that Blowes and Bruises enduce Swellings, is,
for that the Spirits resorting to Succour the Part that Laboureth, draw
also the Humours with them: For we see, that it is not the Repulse, and
the Returne of the Humour in the Part Strucken, that causeth it; For
that Gouts, and Tooth-Aches cause Swelling, where there is no Percussion
at all.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Orris Root, is almost Singular; For there be few
Odoriferous Roots; And in those that are, in any degree, Sweet, it is
but the same Sweetnesse with the Wood, or Leafe: But the Orris is not
Sweet in the Leafe; Neither is the Flower any thing so Sweet as the
Root. The Root seemeth to haue a Tender dainty Heat; Which when it
commeth aboue Ground, to the Sunne, and the Aire, vanisheth: For it is a
great Mollifier; And hath a Smell like a Violet.</p>
<p>It hath been obserued by the Ancients, that a great Vessell full,
drawne into Bottles; And then the Liquour put againe into the Vessell;
will not fill the Vessell againe, so full as it was, but that it may
take in more Liquour: And that this holdeth more in Wine, than in Water.
The Cause may be Triuiall; Namely, by the Expence of the Liquour, in
regard some may sticke to the Sides of the Bottles: But there may be a
Cause more Subtill; Which is, that the Liquour in the Vessell, is not so
much Compressed, as in the Bottle; Because in the Vessell, the Liquour
meeteth with Liquour chiefly; But in the Bottles a Small Quantity of
Liquour, meeteth with the Sides of the Bottles, which Compresse it so,
that it doth not Open againe.</p>
<p>Water, being contiguous with Aire, Cooleth it, but Moisteneth it not,
except it Vapour. The Cause is, for that Heat, and Cold haue a Virtuall
Transition, without Communication of Substance; but Moisture not: And to
all Madefaction there is required an Imbibition: But where the Bodies
are of such seuerall Leuity, and Grauity, as they Mingle not, there can
follow no Imbibition. And therefore, Oyle likewise lyeth at the Top of
the Water, without Commixture: And a Drop of Water, running swiftly ouer
a Straw, or Smooth Body, wetteth not.</p>
<p>Starre-light Nights, yea and bright Moone-shine Nights, are Colder
than Cloudy Nights. The Cause is, the Drinesse and Finenesse of the
Aire, which thereby becommeth more Piercing, and Sharpe? And therefore
Great Continents are colder than Islands: And as for the Moone, though
it selfe inclineth the Aire to Moisture, yet when it shineth bright, it
argueth the Aire is dry. Also Close Aire is warmer than Open Aire; which
(it may be) is, for that the true Cause of Cold, is an Expiration from
the Globe of the Earth, which in open Places is stronger; And againe,
Aire it selfe, if it be not altered by that Expiration, is not without
some Secret Degree of Heat: As it is not likewise without some Secret
Degree of Light: For otherwise Cats, and Owles, could not see in the
Night; But that Aire hath a little Light. Proportionable to the Visuall
Spirits of those Creatures.</p>
<p>The Eyes doe moue —— — way; For when one Eye moueth to the Nosthrill,
the other moueth from the Nosthrill. The Cause is Motion of Consent,
which in the Spirits, and Parts Spirituall, is Strong. But yet Vse will
induce the Contrary: For some can Squint, when they will: And the Common
Tradition is, that if Children be set vpon a Table, with a Candle
behinde them, both Eyes will moue Outwards; As affecting to see the
Light, and so induce Squinting.</p>
<p>We see more exquisitely with One Eye Shut, than with Both Open. The
Cause is, for that the Spirits Visuall vnite themselues more, and so
become Stronger. For you may see, by looking in a Glasse, that when you
shut one Eye, the Pupill of the other Eye, that is Open, Dilateth.</p>
<p>The Eyes, if the Sight meet not in one Angle, See Things Double. The
Cause is, for that Seeing two Things, and Seeing one Thing twice,
worketh the same Effect: And therefore a little Pellet, held betweene
two Fingers, laid a-crosse, seemeth Double.</p>
<p>Pore-blinde Men, see best in the Dimmer Lights; And likewise haue
their Sight Stronger neare hand, than those that are not Pore-blinde;
And can Reade and Write smaller Letters. The Cause is, for that the
Spirits Visuall, in those that are Pore-blinde, are Thinner, and Rarer,
than in others; And therefore the Greater Light disperseth them. For the
same Cause they need Contracting; But being Contracted, are more strong,
than the Visuall Spirits of Ordinary Eyes are; As when we see thorow a
Leuell, the Sight is the Stronger: And so is it, when you gather the
Eyelids somewhat close: And it is commonly seene in those that are
Poreblinde, that they doe much gather the Eye-lids together. But Old
Men, when they would see to Reade, put the Paper somewhat a farre off.
The Cause is, for that Old Mens Spirits Visuall, contrary to those of
Pore-blinde Men, vnite not, but when the Obiect is at some good
distance, from their Eyes.</p>
<p>Men see better, when their Eyes are ouer-against the Sunne, or a
Candle, if they put their Hand a little before their Eye. The Reason is,
for that the Glaring of the Sunne, or the Candle, doth weaken the Eye;
wheras the Light Circumfused is enough for the Perception. For we see,
that an Ouerlight maketh the Eyes Dazell; Insomuch as Perpetuall Looking
against the Sunne, would Cause Blindnesse. Againe, if Men come out of a
Great Light, into a Darke Roome; And contrariwise, if they come out of a
Darke Roome, into a Light Roome, they seeme to haue a Mist before their
Eyes, and see worse, than they shall doe, after they haue stayed a
little while, either in the Light, or in the Darke. The Cause is, for
that the Spirits Visuall, are vpon a Sudden Change, disturbed, and put
out of Order; And till they be recollected, doe not performe their
Function well. For when they are much Dilated by Light, they cannot
Contract suddenly; And when they are much Contracted by Darknesse, they
cannot Dilate suddenly. And Excesse of both these, (that is, of the
Dilatation, and Contraction of the Spirits Visuall,) if it belong,
Destroyeth the Eye. For as long Looking against the Sunne, or Fire,
hurteth the Eye by Dilatation; So Curious Painting in Small Volumes, and
Reading of Small Letters, doe hurt the Eye by Contraction.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued, that in Anger, the Eyes wax Red; And in
Blushing, not the Eyes, but the Eares, and the Parts behinde them. The
Cause is, for that in Anger, the Spirits ascend and wax Eager; Which is
most easily seene in the Eyes, because they are Translucide; Though
withall it maketh both the Cheekes, and the Gills Red; But in Blushing,
it is true, the Spirits ascend likewise to Succour, both the Eyes, and
the Face, which are the Parts that labour: But then they are repulsed by
the Eyes, for that the Eyes, in Shame doe put backe the Spirits, that
ascend to them, as vnwilling to looke abroad: For no Men, in that
Passion, doth looke strongly, but Deiectedly; And that Repulsion from
the Eyes, Diuerteth the Spirits and Heat more to the Eares, and the
Parts by them.</p>
<p>The Obiects of the Sight, may cause a great Pleasure and Delight in
the Spirits, but no Paine, or great Offence; Except it be by Memory, as
hath beene said. The Glimpses and Beames of Diamonds that strike the
Eye; Indian Feathers, that haue glorious Colours; The Comming into a
Faire Garden; The Comming into a Faire Roome richly furnished; A
Beautifull Person; And the like; doe delight and exhilarate the Spirits
much. The Reason, why it holdeth not in the Offence, is, for that the
Sight is the most Spirituall of the Senses; whereby it hath no Obiect
Grosse enough to offend it. But the Cause (chiefly) is, for that there
be no Actiue Obiects to offend the Eye. For Harmonicall Sounds, and
Discordant Sounds, are both Actiue, and Positiue: So are Sweet Smels,
and Stinks: So are Bitter, and Sweet, in Tastes: So are Ouer-Hot, and
Ouer-Cold, in Touch: But Blacknesse, and Darknesse, are indeed but
Priuatiues; And therefore haue little or no Actiuitie. Somewhat they doe
Contristate, but very little.</p>
<p>Water of the Sea, or otherwise, looketh Blacker when it is moued, and
Whiter when it resteth. The Cause is, for that by meanes of the Motion,
the Beames of light passe not Straight, and therefore must be darkened,
whereas, when it resteth, the Beames doe passe Straight. Besides,
Splendour hath a Degree of Whitenesse; Especially if there be a little
Repercussion: For a Looking-Glasse with the Steele behinde, looketh
Whiter, than Glasse Simple. This Experiment deserueth to be driuen
further, in Trying by what Meanes Motion may hinder Sight.</p>
<p>Shell-Fish haue beene, by some of the Ancients, compared and sorted
with the Insecta; But I see no reason why they should; For they haue
Male, and Female, as other Fish haue: Neither are they bred of
Putrefaction; Especially such as doe Moue. Neuerthelesse it is certaine,
that Oisters, and Cockles, and Mussles, which Moue not, haue no
discriminate Sex: Quare in what time, and how they are bred? It seemeth
that Shells of Oisters are bred where none were before; A tried, that
the great Horse-Mussle, with the fine shell, that breedeth in Ponds,
hath bred within thirty yeares: But then, which is strange, it hath
beene tried, that they doe not only Gape, and Shut, as the Oisters doe,
but Remone from one Place to Another.</p>
<p>The Senses are alike Strong, both on the Right Side, and on the Left;
But the Limmes on the Right Side are Stronger. The Cause may be, for
that the Braine, which is the Instrument of Sense, is alike on both
Sides; But Motion, and Habilities of Mouing, are somewhat holpen from
the Liner, which lieth on the Right Side. It may be also, for that the
Senses are put in Exercise, indifferently, on both Sides, from the Time
of our Birth; But the Limmes are vsed most on the Right Side, whereby
Custome helpeth; For wee see that some are Left-Handed: Which are such,
as haue vsed the Left-Hand most.</p>
<p>Frictions make the Parts more Fleshie, and Full: As wee see both in
Men; And in Carrying of Horses, andandandandc. The Cause is, for that
they draw greater Quantitie of Spirits and Blond to the Parts: And
againe, because they draw the Aliment more forcibly from within: And
againe, because they relax the Pores, and so make better Passage for the
Spirits, Blond, and Aliment: Lastly, because they dissipate and disgest
any Inutile or Excrementitious Moisture, which lieth in the Flesh: All
which helpe Assimilation. Frictions also doe more F-ll, and Impinguate
the Body, than Exercise. The Cause is, for that in Frictions, the Inward
Parts are at rest; Which in Exercise are beaten (many times) too much:
And for the same Reason, (as we haue noted heretofore,) Gally-Slaues are
Fat and Fleshie, because they stirre the Limmes more, and the Inward
Parts lesse.</p>
<p>All Globes afarre off appeare Flat. The Cause is, for that Distance,
being a Secundary Obiect of Sight, is not otherwise discerned, than by
more or lesse Light; which Disparitie when it cannot be discerned, all
seemeth One: As it is (generally) in Obiects not distinctly discerned;
For so Letters, if they be so farre off, as they cannot be discerned,
shew but as a Duskish Paper: And all Engrauings, and Embossings, (afarre
off) appeare Plaine.</p>
<p>The Vtmost Parts of Shadowes seeme euer to Tremble. The Cause is, for
that the little Moats, which wee see in the Sunne, doe euer Stirre,
though there be no Wind; And therefore those Mouing, in the Meeting of
the Light and the Shadow, from the Light to the Shadow, and from the
Shadow to the Light, doe shew the Shadow to Moue, because the Medium
Moueth.</p>
<p>Shallow, and Narrow Seas, Breake more than Deepe, and Large. The
Cause is, for that the Impulsion being the same in Both; Where there is
great Quantitie of — , and likewise Space Enough; there the Water
Rowleth, and Moueth, both more Slowly, and with a Sloper Rise, and Fall:
But where there is lesse Water, and lesse Space, and the Water dasheth
more against the Bottome; there it moueth more Swiftly, and more in
Precipice; For in the Breaking of the Wanes there is euer a
Precipice.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Salt-Water Boyled, or
Boyled and Cooled againe, is more Potable, than of it selfe Raw: And yet
the Taste of Salt, in Distillations by Fire, riseth not; For the
Distilled Water will be Fresh. The Cause may be, for that the Salt Part
of the Water, doth partly rise into a Kinde of Scumme on the Top; And
partly goeth into a Sediment in the Bottome: And so is rather a
Separation, than an Euaporation. But it is too grosse to rise into a
Vapour: And so is a Bitter Taste likewise; For Simple Distilled Waters,
of Wormewood, and the like, are not Bitter.</p>
<p>It hath beene set downe before, that Pits vpon the Sea-Shoare, turne
into Fresh Water, by Percolation of the Salt through the Sand: But it is
further noted, by some of the Ancients, that in some Places of Affricke,
after a time, the Water in such Pits will become Brackish againe. The
Cause is, for that after a time, the very Sands, thorow which the
SaltWater passeth, become Salt; And so the Strainer it selfe is tincted
with Salt. The Remedie therefore is, to digge still New Pits, when the
old wax Brackish; As if you would change your Strainer.</p>
<p>It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Salt Water, will
dissolue Salt put into it, in lesse time, than Fresh Water will dissolue
it. The Cause may be, for that the Salt in the Precedent Water, doth, by
Similitude of Substance, draw the Salt new put in, vnto it; Whereby it
diffuseth in the Liquour more speedily. This is a Noble Experiment, if
it be true; For it sheweth Meanes of more Quicke and Easie Infusions;
And it is likewise a good Instance of Attraction, by Similitude of
Substance. Trie it with Sugar put into Water, formerly Sugred; And into
other Water Vnsugred.</p>
<p>Put Sugar into Wine, part of it aboue, part vnder the Wine; And you
shall finde, (that which may seeme strange,) that the Sugar aboue the
Wine, will soften and dissolue sooner, than that within the Wine. The
Cause is, for that the Wine entreth that Part of the Sugar, which is
vnder the Wine, by Simple Infusion, or Spreading; But that Part aboue
the Wine, is likewise forced by Sacking: For all Spungie Bodies expell
the Aire, and draw in Liquour, if it be Contiguous: As wee see it also
in Spunges, put part aboue the Water. It is worthy the Inquiry, to see
how you may make more Accurate Infusions, by Helpe of Attraction.</p>
<p>Water in Wells is warmer in Winter, than in Summer: And so Aire in
Caues. The Cause is, for that in the Hither Parts, vnder the Earth,
there is a Degree of some Heat; (As appeareth in Sulphureous Veines,
andandandandc.) Which shur close in, (as in Winter,) is the More; But if
it Peripire, (as it doth in Summer,) it is the Lesse.</p>
<p>It is reported, that amongst the Leucadians, in Ancient time, vpon a
Superstition, they did vse to Precipitate a Man, from a High Cliffe into
the Sea; Tying about him, with Strings, at some distance, many great
Fowles; And fixing vnto his Body diuers Feathers, spred, to breake the
Fast. Certainly many Birds of good Wing, (As Kites, and the like,) would
beare vp a good Weight, as they file; And Spreading of Feathers, thinne,
and close, and in great Bredth, will likewise beare vp a great Weight;
Being euen laid, without Tilting vpon the Sides. The further Extension
of this Experiment for Flying may be thought vpon.</p>
<p>There is, in some Places, (namely in Cephalonia,) a little Shrub,
which they call Holy-Oake, or Dwarfe-Oake: Vpon the Leaues whereof there
riseth a Tumour, like a Blister; Which they gather, and rub out of it, a
certaine Red Dust, that conuerteth (after a while) into Wormes, which
they kill with Wine, (as is reported,) when they begin to Quicken: With
this Dust they die Scarlet.</p>
<p>In Zant, it is very ordinary, to make Men Impotent, to accompany with
their Wines. The like is Practised in Gasconie; Where it is called Nouër
l’ eguillette. It is practised alwayes vpon the Wedding Day. And in
Zant, the Mothers themselues doe it, by way of Preuention; Because
thereby they hinder other Charmes, and can vndoe their Owne. It is a
Thing the Ciuill Law taketh knowledge of; And therefore is of no Light
Regard.</p>
<p>It is a Common Experiment, but the Cause is mistaken. Take a Pot, (Or
better a Glasse, because therein you may see the Motion,) And set a
Candle lighted in the Bottome of a Basen of Water; And turne the Mouth
of the Pot, or Glasse, ouer the Candle, and it will make the Water rise.
They ascribe it, to the Drawing of Heat; Which is not true: For it
appeareth plainly to be but a Motion of Nexe, which they call Ne detur
vacuum; And it proceedeth thus. The Flame of the Candle, as soone as it
is couered, being suffocated by the Close Aire, lesseneth by little and
little: During which time, there is some little Ascent of Water, but not
much: For the Flame Occupying lesse and lesse Roome, as it lesseneth,
the Water succeedeth. But vpon the Instant of the Candles Going out,
there is a sudden Rise, of a great deale of Water; For that the Body of
the Flame filleth no more Place; And so the Aire, and the Water succeed.
It worketh the same Effect, if in stead of Water, you put Flower, or
Sand, into the Basen: Which sheweth, that it is not the Flames Drawing
the Liquour, as Nourishment; As it is supposed; For all Bodies are alike
vnto it; As it is euer in Motion of Nexe; Insomuch as I haue seene the
Glasse, being held by the Hand, hath lifted vp the Basen, and all: The
Motion of Nexe did so Claspe the Bottome of the Basen. That Experiment,
when the Basen was lifted vp, was made with Oyle, and not with Water;
Neuerthelesse this is true, that at the very first Setting of the Mouth
of the Glasse, vpon the Bottome of the Basen, it draweth vp the Water a
little, and then standeth at a Stay, almost till the Candles Going out,
as was said. This may shew some Attraction at first: But of this we will
speake more, when we handle Attractions by Heat.</p>
<p>Of the Power of the Gelestiall Bodies, and what more Secret
Influences they haue, besides the two Manifest Influences of Heat, and
Light, We shall speake, when we handle Experiments touching the
Celestiall Bodies: Meane-while, wee will giue some Directions for more
certaine Trials, of the Vertue and Influences of the Moone; which is our
Nearest Neighbour.</p>
<p>The Influences of the Moone, (most obserued,) are Foure. The Drawing
forth of Heat: The Inducing of Putrefaction: The Increase of Moisture:
The Exciting of the Motions of Spirits.</p>
<p>For the Drawing forth of Heat, we haue formerly prescribed, to take
Water Warme, and to set Part of it against the Moone-Beames, and Part of
it with a Skreene betweene; And to see whether that which standeth
Exposed to the Beames, will not Coole sooner. But because this is but a
Small Interposition, (though in the Sunne wee see a Small Shade doth
much,) it were good to try it, when the Moone shineth, and when the
Moone shineth not at all; And with Water Warme in a Glasse-Bottle, as
well as in a Dish; And with C — rs; And with Iron Red-Hot;
andandandandc.</p>
<p>For the In — ing of Putrefaction, it were good to try it with Flesh,
or Fish, Exposed to the Moone-Beames; And againe Exposed to the Aire,
when the Moone shineth not, for the like time; To see whether will
corrupt sooner: And try it also with Capon, or some other Fowle, laid
abroad, to see whether it will mortifie, and become tender sooner? Try
it also with Dead Flies, or Dead Wormes, hauing a little Water cast vpon
them, to see whether will Putrifie sooner. Try it also with an Apple, or
Orenge, hauing Holes made in their Tops, to see whether will Rot or
Mould sooner- Try it also with Holland-Cheese, hauing Wine put into it,
whether will breed Mites sooner, or greater?</p>
<p>For the Increase of Moisture, the Opinion Receiued is; That Seeds
will grow soonest; And Haire, and Nailes, and Hedges, and Herbs, Cut,
andandandandc. will grow soonest, if they be Set, or Cut, in the
Increase of the Moone. Also that Braines in Rabits, Wood-cocks, Calues,
andandandandc. are fullest in the Full of the Moone: And so of — in the
Bones; And so of Oysters, and — , which of all the rest are the easiest
tried, if you haue them in Pits.</p>
<p>Take some —— —— and set some of them immediately after the Change;
And others of the same kinde immediately after the Full: Let them be as
Like as can be: The Earth also the Same as neare as may be; And
therefore beft in Pots: Let the Pots also stand, where no Raine, or
Sunne may come to them, lest the Difference of the Weather confound the
Experiment: And then see in what Time, the Seeds Set in the Increase of
the Moone, come to a certaine Height; And how they differ from chose
that are Set in the Decrease of the Moone.</p>
<p>It is like, that the Braine of Man waxeth Moister, and Fuller, vpon
the Full of the Moone: And therefore it were good for those that haue
Moist Braines, and are great Drinkers, to take Fume of Lignum Aloës,
RoseMary —— about the full of the Moone. It is like also, that the — in
mens Bodies, Increase, and Decrease, as the Moone doth; And therefore it
were good to Purge, some day, or two, after the Full; For that then the
— will not replenish so soone againe.</p>
<p>As for the — of the Motion of the Spirits, you must note that the
Growth of Hedges, Herbs, Haire, — is caused from the Moone, by — of the
Spirits, as well as by Increase of the Moisture. But for Spirite in
particular, the great Instante is in — .</p>
<p>There may be other Secret Effects of the Influence of the Moone,
which are not yet brought into Obseruation. It may be, that if it so
fill out, that the Wind be North, or North-East, in the Full of the
Moone, it increaseth Cold; And if South, or South-West, it disposeth the
Aire, for a good while, to Warmth, and Raine; Which would be
obserued.</p>
<p>It may be, that Children, and Young Cattell, that are Brought forth
in the Full of the Moone, are stronger, andandandand larger, than those
that are brought forth in the Wane: And those also which are Begotten in
the Full of the Moone: So that it might be good Husbandry, to put Rams,
and Bulls to their Females, somewhat before the Full of the Moone. It
may be also, that the Egs lay’d in the Full of the Moone, breed the
better Bird: And a Number of the like Effects, which may be brought into
Obseruation: Quare also, whether great Thunders, and Earth-Quakes, be
not most in the Full of the Moone?</p>
<p>The Turning of Wine to Vinegar, is a Kinde of Putrefaction: And in
Making of Vinegar, they vse to set Vessels of Wine ouer against the
Noone-Sunne; which calleth out the more Oyly Spirits, and leaueth the
Liquour more Soure, and Hard. We see also, that Burnt-Wine is more Hard,
and Astringent, than Wine Vnburnt. It is said, that Cider in Nauigations
vnder the Line ripeneth, when Wine or Beere soureth. It were good to set
a Rundlet of Veriuyce ouer against the Sunne, in Summer, as they doe
Vinegar, to see whether it will Ripen, and Sweeten.</p>
<p>There be diuers Creatures, that Sleepe all Winter; As the Beare, the
Hedge-hog, the Bat, the Bee, andandandandc. These all wax Fat when they
Sleepe, and egest not. The Cause of their Fattening, during their
Sleeping time, may be the Want of Assimilating, For whatsoeuer
Attimilation not to Flesh, turneth either to Sweat, or Fat. These
Creatures, for part of their Sleeping Time, haue been obserued not to
Stirre at all; And for the other part, to Stirre, but not to Remoue. And
they get Warme and Close Places to Sleepe in. When the Flemmings Wintred
in Noua Zembla, the Beares, about the Middle of Nouember, went to
Sleepe; And then the Foxes began to come forth, which durst not before.
It is noted by some of the Ancients, that the Shee-Beare breedeth, and
lyeth in with her Young, during that time of Rest: And that a Beare, Big
with Young, hath seldome beene seene.</p>
<p>Some Liuing Creatures are Procreated by Copulation betweene Male, and
Female: Some by Putrefaction; And of those which come by Putrefaction,
many doe (neuerthelesse) afterwards procreate by Copulation. For the
Cause of both Generations: First, it is most certaine, that the Cause of
all Viuification, is a Gentle and Proportionable Heat, working vpon a
Glutinous and Yeelding Substance: For the Heat doth bring forth Spirit
in that Substance: And the Substance, being Glutinous, produceth Two
Effects: The One, that the Spirit is Detained, and cannot Breake forth:
The Other, that the Matter being Gentle, and Yeelding, is driuen
forwards by the Motion of the Spirits, after some Swelling into Shape,
and Members. Therefore all Sperme, all Menstruous Substance, all Matter
whereof Creatures are produced by Putrefaction, haue euermore a
Closenesse, Lentour, and Sequacity. It seemeth therefore, that the
Generation by Sperme onely, and by Putrefaction, haue two Different
Causes. The First is, for that Creatures, which haue a Definite and
Exact Shape, (as those haue which are Procreated by Copulation,) cannot
be produced by a Weake, and Casuall Heat; Nor out of Matter, which is
not exactly Prepared, according to the Species. The Second is, for that
there is a greater Time required, for Maturation of Perfect Creatures;
For if the Time required in Viuification be of any length, then the
Spirit will Exhale, before the Creature be Mature: Except it be Enclosed
in a Place where it may haue Continuance of the Heat, Accesse of some
Nourishment to maintaine it, and Closenesse that may keepe it from
Exhaling. And such Places are the Wombes, and Matrices, of the Females.
And therefore all Creatures, made of Putrefaction, are of more
Vncertaine Shape; And are made in Shorter Time; And need not so Perfect
an Enclosure, though some Closenesse be commonly required. As for the
Heathen Opinion, which was, that vpon great Mutations of the World,
Perfect Creatures were first Engendred of Concretion; As well as Frogs,
and Wormes, and Flies, and such like, are now; Wee know it to be vaine:
But if any such Thing should be admitted, Discoursing according to
Sense, it cannot be, except you admit a Chaos first, andandandand
Commixture of Heauen, and Earth. For the Frame of the World, once in
Order, cannot effect it by any Extesse, or Casualtie.</p>
