<ol type="1">
<li><p>We proceed now to that knowledge which considereth of the
appetite and will of man: whereof Solomon saith, Ante omnia, fili,
custodi cor tuum: nam inde procedunt actiones vitae. In the handling of
this science, those which have written seem to me to have done as if a
man, that professed to teach to write, did only exhibit fair copies of
alphabets and letters joined, without giving any precepts or directions
for the carriage of the hand and framing of the letters. So have they
made good and fair exemplars and copies, carrying the draughts and
portraitures of good, virtue, duty, felicity; propounding them well
described as the true objects and scopes of man’s will and desires. But
how to attain these excellent marks, and how to frame and subdue the
will of man to become true and conformable to these pursuits, they pass
it over altogether, or slightly and unprofitably. For it is not the
disputing that moral virtues are in the mind of man by habit and not by
nature, or the distinguishing that generous spirits are won by doctrines
and persuasions, and the vulgar sort by reward and punishment, and the
like scattered glances and touches, that can excuse the absence of this
part.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason of this omission I suppose to be that hidden rock
whereupon both this and many other barks of knowledge have been cast
away; which is, that men have despised to be conversant in ordinary and
common matters, the judicious direction whereof nevertheless is the
wisest doctrine (for life consisteth not in novelties nor subtleties),
but contrariwise they have compounded sciences chiefly of a certain
resplendent or lustrous mass of matter, chosen to give glory either to
the subtlety of disputatious, or to the eloquence of discourses. But
Seneca giveth an excellent check to eloquence, Nocet illis eloquentia,
quibus non rerum cupiditatem facit, sed sui. Doctrine should be such as
should make men in love with the lesson, and not with the teacher; being
directed to the auditor’s benefit, and not to the author’s commendation.
And therefore those are of the right kind which may be concluded as
Demosthenes concludes his counsel, Quae si feceritis, non oratorem
dumtaxat in praesentia laudabitis, sed vosmetipsos etiam non ita multo
post statu rerum vestraram meliore.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither needed men of so excellent parts to have despaired of a
fortune, which the poet Virgil promised himself, and indeed obtained,
who got as much glory of eloquence, wit, and learning in the expressing
of the observations of husbandry, as of the heroical acts of
AEneas:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Nec sum animi dubius, verbis ea vincere magnum</p>
<p>Quam sit, et angustis his addere rebus honorem.”</p>
<p>And surely, if the purpose be in good earnest, not to write at
leisure that which men may read at leisure, but really to instruct and
suborn action and active life, these Georgics of the mind, concerning
the husbandry and tillage thereof, are no less worthy than the heroical
descriptions of virtue, duty, and felicity. Wherefore the main and
primitive division of moral knowledge seemeth to be into the exemplar or
platform of good, and the regiment or culture of the mind: the one
describing the nature of good, the other prescribing rules how to
subdue, apply, and accommodate the will of man thereunto.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>The doctrine touching the platform or nature of good considereth
it either simple or compared; either the kinds of good, or the degrees
of good; in the latter whereof those infinite disputatious which were
touching the supreme degree thereof, which they term felicity,
beatitude, or the highest good, the doctrines concerning which were as
the heathen divinity, are by the Christian faith discharged. And as
Aristotle saith, “That young men may be happy, but not otherwise but by
hope;” so we must all acknowledge our minority, and embrace the felicity
which is by hope of the future world.</p></li>
<li><p>Freed therefore and delivered from this doctrine of the
philosopher’s heaven, whereby they feigned a higher elevation of man’s
nature than was (for we see in what height of style Seneca writeth, Vere
magnum, habere fragilitatem hominis, securitatem Dei), we may with more
sobriety and truth receive the rest of their inquiries and labours.
Wherein for the nature of good positive or simple, they have set it down
excellently in describing the forms of virtue and duty, with their
situations and postures; in distributing them into their kinds, parts,
provinces, actions, and administrations, and the like: nay further, they
have commended them to man’s nature and spirit with great quickness of
argument and beauty of persuasions; yea, and fortified and entrenched
them (as much as discourse can do) against corrupt and popular opinions.
Again, for the degrees and comparative nature of good, they have also
excellently handled it in their triplicity of good, in the comparisons
between a contemplative and an active life, in the distinction between
virtue with reluctation and virtue secured, in their encounters between
honesty and profit, in their balancing of virtue with virtue, and the
like; so as this part deserveth to be reported for excellently
laboured.</p></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding, if before they had come to the popular and
received notions of virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, and the rest,
they had stayed a little longer upon the inquiry concerning the roots of
good and evil, and the strings of those roots, they had given, in my
opinion, a great light to that which followed; and specially if they had
consulted with nature, they had made their doctrines less prolix and
more profound: which being by them in part omitted and in part handled
with much confusion, we will endeavour to resume and open in a more
clear manner.</p></li>
<li><p>There is formed in everything a double nature of good — the one,
as everything is a total or substantive in itself; the other, as it is a
part or member of a greater body; whereof the latter is in degree the
greater and the worthier, because it tendeth to the conservation of a
more general form. Therefore we see the iron in particular sympathy
moveth to the loadstone; but yet if it exceed a certain quantity, it
forsaketh the affection to the loadstone, and like a good patriot moveth
to the earth, which is the region and country of massy bodies; so may we
go forward, and see that water and massy bodies move to the centre of
the earth; but rather than to suffer a divulsion in the continuance of
nature, they will move upwards from the centre of the earth, forsaking
their duty to the earth in regard of their duty to the world. This
double nature of good, and the comparative thereof, is much more
engraven upon man, if he degenerate not, unto whom the conservation of
duty to the public ought to be much more precious than the conservation
of life and being; according to that memorable speech of Pompeius
Magnus, when being in commission of purveyance for a famine at Rome, and
being dissuaded with great vehemency and instance by his friends about
him, that he should not hazard himself to sea in an extremity of
weather, he said only to them, Necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam. But it
may be truly affirmed that there was never any philosophy, religion, or
other discipline, which did so plainly and highly exalt the good which
is communicative, and depress the good which is private and particular,
as the Holy Faith; well declaring that it was the same God that gave the
Christian law to men, who gave those laws of nature to inanimate
creatures that we spake of before; for we read that the elected saints
of God have wished themselves anathematised and razed out of the book of
life, in an ecstasy of charity and infinite feeling of
communion.</p></li>
<li><p>This being set down and strongly planted, doth judge and
determine most of the controversies wherein moral philosophy is
conversant. For first, it decideth the question touching the preferment
of the contemplative or active life, and decideth it against Aristotle.
For all the reasons which he bringeth for the contemplative are private,
and respecting the pleasure and dignity of a man’s self (in which
respects no question the contemplative life hath the pre-eminence), not
much unlike to that comparison which Pythagoras made for the gracing and
magnifying of philosophy and contemplation, who being asked what he was,
answered, “That if Hiero were ever at the Olympian games, he knew the
manner, that some came to try their fortune for the prizes, and some
came as merchants to utter their commodities, and some came to make good
cheer and meet their friends, and some came to look on; and that he was
one of them that came to look on.” But men must know, that in this
theatre of man’s life it is reserved only for God and angels to be
lookers on. Neither could the like question ever have been received in
the Church, notwithstanding their Pretiosa in oculis Domini mors
sanctorum ejus, by which place they would exalt their civil death and
regular professions, but upon this defence, that the monastical life is
not simple contemplative, but performeth the duty either of incessant
prayers and supplications, which hath been truly esteemed as an office
in the Church, or else of writing or taking instructions for writing
concerning the law of God, as Moses did when he abode so long in the
mount. And so we see Enoch, the seventh from Adam, who was the first
contemplative and walked with God, yet did also endow the Church with
prophecy, which Saint Jude citeth. But for contemplation which should be
finished in itself, without casting beams upon society, assuredly
divinity knoweth it not.</p></li>
<li><p>It decideth also the controversies between Zeno and Socrates, and
their schools and successions, on the one side, who placed felicity in
virtue simply or attended, the actions and exercises whereof do chiefly
embrace and concern society; and on the other side, the Cyrenaics and
Epicureans, who placed it in pleasure, and made virtue (as it is used in
some comedies of errors, wherein the mistress and the maid change
habits) to be but as a servant, without which pleasure cannot be served
and attended; and the reformed school of the Epicureans, which placed it
in serenity of mind and freedom from perturbation; as if they would have
deposed Jupiter again, and restored Saturn and the first age, when there
was no summer nor winter, spring nor autumn, but all after one air and
season; and Herillus, which placed felicity in extinguishment of the
disputes of the mind, making no fixed nature of good and evil, esteeming
things according to the clearness of the desires, or the reluctation;
which opinion was revived in the heresy of the Anabaptists, measuring
things according to the motions of the spirit, and the constancy or
wavering of belief; all which are manifest to tend to private repose and
contentment, and not to point of society.</p></li>
<li><p>It censureth also the philosophy of Epictetus, which presupposeth
that felicity must be placed in those things which are in our power,
lest we be liable to fortune and disturbance; as if it were not a thing
much more happy to fail in good and virtuous ends for the public, than
to obtain all that we can wish to ourselves in our proper fortune: as
Consalvo said to his soldiers, showing them Naples, and protesting he
had rather die one foot forwards, than to have his life secured for long
by one foot of retreat. Whereunto the wisdom of that heavenly leader
hath signed, who hath affirmed that “a good conscience is a continual
feast;” showing plainly that the conscience of good intentions,
howsoever succeeding, is a more continual joy to nature than all the
provision which can be made for security and repose.</p></li>
<li><p>It censureth likewise that abuse of philosophy which grew general
about the time of Epictetus, in converting it into an occupation or
profession; as if the purpose had been, not to resist and extinguish
perturbations, but to fly and avoid the causes of them, and to shape a
particular kind and course of life to that end; introducing such a
health of mind, as was that health of body of which Aristotle speaketh
of Herodicus, who did nothing all his life long but intend his health;
whereas if men refer themselves to duties of society, as that health of
body is best which is ablest to endure all alterations and extremities,
so likewise that health of mind is most proper which can go through the
greatest temptations and perturbations. So as Diogenes’ opinion is to be
accepted, who commended not them which abstained, but them which
sustained, and could refrain their mind in praecipitio, and could give
unto the mind (as is used in horsemanship) the shortest stop or
turn.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, it censureth the tenderness and want of application in
some of the most ancient and reverend philosophers and philosophical
men, that did retire too easily from civil business, for avoiding of
indignities and perturbations; whereas the resolution of men truly moral
ought to be such as the same Consalvo said the honour of a soldier
should be, e tela crassiore, and not so fine as that everything should
catch in it and endanger it.</p></li>
