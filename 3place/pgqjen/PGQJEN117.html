<h4 id="chapter-iv.">Chapter IV.</h4>
<p>Contemporary Allusions to Shackspere.</p>
<p>Shakspeare the Actor purchased New Place at Stratford-on-Avon in 1597
for £60 and he became a “gentleman” and an esquire when he secured a
grant of arms in 1599.</p>
<p>How did the stage “honour” the player who had bought a coat of arms
and was able to call himself a “gentleman”?</p>
<p>Three contemporary plays give us scenes illustrating the
incident:</p>
<p>1st. Ben Jonson’s “Every man out of his humour” which was acted in
1599 the very year of Shakspeare’s grant of arms.</p>
<p>2nd. Shakespeare’s “As you like it” which was entered at Stationers’
Hall in 1600, although no copy is known to exist before the folio of
1623.</p>
<p>3rd. “The Return from Parnassus” which was acted at St. John’s
College, Cambridge in 1601, though not printed till 1606.</p>
<p>In addition to these three plays, there is a fourth evidence of the
way in which the Clown who had purchased a coat of arms was regarded, in
a pamphlet or tract of which only one copy is known to exist. This tract
which can be seen in the Rylands Library, Manchester, used to be in Lord
Spencer’s library at Althorp, and is reprinted by Halliwell-Phillipps in
“Outlines of the Life of Shakespeare,” 1889, Vol. I, pages 325-6.</p>
<p>To commence with Ben Jonson’s “Every man out of his humour.” The
clown who had purchased a coat of arms is said to be the brother of
Sordido (a miser), and is described as an “essential” clown (that is an
uneducated rustic), and is styled Sogliardo which is the Italian for the
filthiest possible name.</p>
<p>The other two characters in the scene (act iii. sc. I) are Puntarvolo
who, as his crest is a Boar, must be intended to represent Bacon;2 and
Carlo Buffone who is a buffoon or jester.</p>
<p>Enter Sogliardo (the filth), who is evidently the Stratford Clown,
who has just purchased a coat of arms: —</p>
<p>Actus Tertius, Scena Prima,</p>
<p>Sogliardo, Punt., Carlo.</p>
<p>Sog. Nay I will haue him, I am resolute for that, by this Parchment
Gentlemen, I haue ben so toil’d among the Harrots [meaning Heralds]
yonder, you will not beleeue, they doe speake i’ the straungest
language, and giue a man the hardest termes for his money, that euer you
knew.</p>
<p>Car. But ha’ you armes? ha’ your armes?</p>
<p>Sog. Yfaith, I thanke God I can write myselfe Gentleman now, here’s
my Pattent, it cost me thirtie pound by this breath.</p>
<p>Punt. A very faire Coat, well charg’d and full of Armorie.</p>
<p>Sog. Nay, it has, as much varietie of colours in it, as you haue
seene a Coat haue, how like you the Crest, Sir?</p>
<p>Punt. I vnderstand it not well, what is’t?</p>
<p>Sog. Marry Sir, it is your Bore without a head Rampant.</p>
<p>Punt. A Bore without a head, that’s very rare.</p>
<p>Car. I, [Aye] and Rampant too: troth I commend</p>
<p>the Herald’s wit, he has deciphered him well:</p>
<p>A Swine without a head, without braine, wit,</p>
<p>anything indeed, Ramping to Gentilitie. You</p>
<p>can blazon the rest signior? can you not?</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>Punt. Let the word be, Not without mustard, your</p>
<p>Crest is very rare sir.</p>
<p>Shakspeare’s “word” that is his “motto” was — non sanz droict — not
without right — and I desire the reader also especially to remember
Sogliardo’s words “Yfaith I thanke God” a phrase which though it appears
in the quartos is changed in the 1616 Ben Jonson folio into “I thank
them” which has no meaning.</p>
<p>Next we turn to Shakespeare’s “As you like it.” This play though
entered at Stationers’ Hall in 1600 and probably played quite as early
is not known in print till it appeared in the folio of 1623. The portion
to which I wish to refer is the commencement of Actus Quintus, Scena
Prima.</p>
<p>Act 5, Scene i. Enter Clowne and Awdrie.</p>
<p>Clow. We shall finde a time Awdrie, patience gentle</p>
<p>Awdrie.</p>
<p>Awd. Faith the priest was good enough, for all the</p>
<p>olde gentlemans saying.</p>
<p>Clow. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Awdrie, a most vile Mar-text. But
Awdrie, there is a youth heere in the forrest layes claime to you.</p>
<p>Awd. I, I know who ’tis: he hath no interest in mee in the world:
here comes the man you meane.</p>
<p>(Enter William)</p>
<p>Clo. It is meat and drinke to me to see a clowne, by my troth, we
that haue good wits, haue much to answer for: we shall be flouting: we
cannot hold.</p>
<p>Will. Good eu’n Audrey.</p>
<p>Awd. God ye good eu’n William.</p>
<p>Will. And good eu’n to you sir.</p>
<p>Clo. Good eu’n gentle friend. Couer thy head, couer thy head: Nay
prethee bee couer’d. How olde are you Friend?</p>
<p>Will. Fiue and twentie Sir.</p>
<p>Clo. A ripe age: Is thy name William?</p>
<p>Will. William, Sir.</p>
<p>Clo. A faire name. Was’t borne i’ the Forrest heere?</p>
<p>Will. I [Aye] Sir, I thanke God.</p>
<p>Clo. Thanke God: A good answer: Art rich?</p>
<p>Will. ’Faith Sir, so, so.</p>
<p>Clo. So, so, is good, very good, very excellent good: and yet it is
not, it is but so, so: Art thou wise?</p>
<p>Will. I [Aye] sir, I haue a prettie wit.</p>
<p>Clo. Why, thou saist well. I do now remember a saying: The Foole doth
thinke he is wise, but the wise man knowes himselfe to be a Foole…. You
do loue this maid?</p>
<p>Will. I do Sir.</p>
<p>Clo. Giue me your hand: art thou Learned?</p>
<p>Will. No Sir.</p>
<p>Clo. Then learne this of me, To haue is to haue. For it is a figure
in Rhetoricke, that drink being powr’d out of a cup into a glasse, by
filling the one, doth empty the other. For all your Writers do consent,
that ipse is hee: now you are not ipse, for I am he.</p>
<p>Will. Which he Sir?</p>
<p>Clo. He Sir, that must marrie this woman.</p>
<p>Firstly I want to call your attention to Touchstone the courtier who
is playing clown and who we are told “uses his folly like a stalking
horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.” Notice that
Touchstone refuses to be married to Awdrey (who probably represents the
plays of Shakespeare) by a-Mar-text, and she declares that the Clown
William “has no interest in mee in the world.” William — shall we say
Shakspeare of Stratford? — enters and is greeted as “gentle” (i. e. he
is possessed of a coat of arms). He says “Thank God” he was born in the
forest here (Ardennes, very near in sound to Arden). “Thank God” is
repeated by Touchstone and as it is the same phrase that is used by
Sogliardo in Ben Jonson’s play I expect that it was an ejaculation very
characteristic of the real man of Stratford and I am confirmed in this
belief because in the folio edition of Ben Jonson’s plays the phrase is
changed to “I thank them” which has no meaning.</p>
<p>The clown of Ardennes is rich but only rich for a clown (Shakspeare
of</p>
<p>Stratford was not really rich, New Place cost only £60).</p>
<p>Asked if he is wise, he says “aye,” that is “yes,” and adds that he
has “a pretty wit,” a phrase we must remember that is constantly used in
reference to the Stratford actor. Touchstone mocks him with a paraphrase
of the well-known maxim “If you are wise you are a Foole if you be a
Foole you are wise” which is to be found in Bacon’s “Advancement of
Learning” Antitheta xxxi. Then he asks him “Art thou learned” and
William replies “No sir.” This means, unquestionably, as every lawyer
must know, that William replies that he cannot read one line of print. I
feel sure the man called Shackspeare of Stratford was an uneducated
rustic, never able to read a single line of print, and that this is the
reason why no books were found in his house, this is the reason why his
solicitor, Thomas Greene, lived with him in his house at New Place
(Halliwell-Phillipps: Outlines, 1889, Vol. i, p. 226); — a well-known
fact that very much puzzles those who do not realize the depth of
Shakspeare’s illiteracy.</p>
