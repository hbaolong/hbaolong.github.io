<h4 id="chapter-xxv.-the-philosophy-of-bacon.">Chapter XXV. THE
PHILOSOPHY OF BACON.</h4>
<p>To attempt anything of the nature of a review of Bacon’s acknowledged
works is a task far too great for the scope of the present volume. To
attempt a survey of the whole of his works would require years of
diligent study, and would necessitate a perusal of nearly every book
published in England between 1576 and 1630. Not that it is suggested
that all the literature of this period was the product of his pen or was
produced under his supervision, but each book published should be read
and considered with attention to arrive at a selection.</p>
<p>There has been no abler judgment of the acknowledged works than that
which will be found in William Hazlitt’s “Lectures on the Literature of
the Age of Elizabeth.” Lecture VII. commences with an account of the
“Character of Bacon’s Works.”</p>
<p>It may not, however, be out of place here to try and make plain in
what sense Bacon was a philosopher.</p>
<p>In Chapter CXVI. of the “Novum Organum” he makes his position clear
in the following words: —</p>
<p>“First then I must request men not to suppose that after the fashion
of ancient Greeks, and of certain moderns, as Telesius, Patricius,
Severinus, I wish to found a new sect in philosophy. For this is not
what I am about; nor do I think that it matters much to the fortunes of
men what abstract notions one may entertain concerning nature and the
principles of things; and no doubt many old theories of this kind can be
revived, and many new ones introduced; just as many theories of the
heavens may be supposed which agree well enough with the phenomena and
yet differ with each other.</p>
<p>“For my part, I do not trouble myself with any such speculative and
withal unprofitable matters. My purpose on the contrary, is to try
whether I cannot in very fact lay more firmly the foundations and extend
more widely the limits of the power and greatness of man … I have no
entire or universal theory to propound.”</p>
<p>So the idea that there was what is termed a system of philosophy
constructed by Bacon must be abandoned. What justification is there for
calling him the father of the Inductive Philosophy?</p>
<p>It is difficult to answer this question. Spedding admits that Bacon
was not the first to break down the dominion of Aristotle. That followed
the awakening throughout the intellectual world which was brought about
by the Reformation and the revival of learning. Sir John Herschel
justifies the application to Bacon of the term “The great Reformer of
Philosophy” not on the ground that he introduced inductive reasoning,
but because of his “keen perception and his broad and spirit-stirring,
almost enthusiastic announcement of its paramount importance, as the
Alpha and Omega of science, as the grand and only chain for linking
together of physical truths and the eventual key to every discovery and
application.”</p>
<p>Bacon was 60 years of age when his “Novum Organum” was published. It
was founded on a tract he had written in 1607, which he called “Cogitata
et Visa,” not printed until long after his death. He had previously
published a portion of his Essays, the two books on “The Advancement of
Learning” and “The Wisdom of the Ancients.” Just at the end of his life
he gave to the world the “Novum Organum,” accompanied by “The
Parasceve.” Certainly it was not understood in his time. Coke described
it as only fit to freight the Ship of Fools, and the King likened it “to
the peace of God which passeth all understanding.” It is admittedly
incomplete, and Bacon made no attempt in subsequent years to complete
it. It is a book that if read and re-read becomes fascinating. Taine
describes it as “a string of aphorisms, a collection as it were of
scientific decrees as of an oracle who foresees the future and reveals
the truth.” “It is intuition not reasoning,” he adds. The wisdom
contained in its pages is profound. An understanding of the
interpretation of the Idols and the Instances has so far evaded all
commentators. Who can explain the “Latent Process”? But the book
contains no scheme of arrangement. Therein is found a series of
desultory discourses — full of wisdom, rich in analogies, abundant in
observation and profound in comprehension. From here and there in it
with the help of the “Parasceve” one can grasp the intention of the
great philosopher.</p>
<p>In Chapter LXI. he says:— “But the course I propose for the discovery
of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength
of wits, but places all wits and understandings on a level.” How was
this to be accomplished? By the systemization of labour expended on
scientific research. A catalogue of the particulars of histories which
were to be prepared is appended to the “Parasceve.” It embraces every
subject conceivable. In Chapter CXI. he says, “I plainly confess that a
collection of history, natural and experimental, such as I conceive it,
and as it ought to be, is a great, I may say a royal work, and of much
labour and expense.”</p>
<p>In the “Parasceve” he says:— “If all the wits of all the ages had met
or shall hereafter meet together; if the whole human race had applied or
shall hereafter apply themselves to philosophy, and the whole earth had
been or shall be nothing but academies and colleges and schools of
learned men; still without a natural and experimental history such as I
am going to prescribe, no progress worthy of the human race could have
been made or can be made in philosophy and the sciences. Whereas on the
other hand let such a history be once provided and well set forth and
let there be added to it such auxiliary and light-giving experiments as
in the very course of interpretation will present themselves or will
have to be found out; and the investigation of nature and of all
sciences will be the work of a few years. This therefore must be done or
the business given up.”</p>
<p>To carry out this work an army of workers was required. In the
preparation of each history some were to make a rough and general
collection of facts. Their work was to be handed over to others who
would arrange the facts in order for reference. This accomplished,
others would examine to get rid of superfluities. Then would be brought
in those who would re-arrange that which was left and the history would
be completed.</p>
<p>From Chapter CIII. it is clear that Bacon contemplated that
eventually all the experiments of all the arts, collected and digested,
should be brought within one man’s knowledge and judgment. This man,
having a supreme view of the whole range of subjects, would transfer
experiments of one art to another and so lead “to the discovery of many
new things of service to the life and state of man.”</p>
<p>Nearly three hundred years have passed since Bacon propounded his
scheme. The arts and sciences have been greatly advanced. They might
have proceeded more rapidly had the histories been prepared, but since
his time there has arisen no man who has taken “all knowledge to be his
province” — no man who could occupy the position Bacon contemplated.</p>
<p>The method by which the induction was to be followed is described in
Chapter CV. There must be an analysis of nature by proper rejections and
exclusions, and then, after a sufficient number of negatives, a
conclusion should be arrived at from the affirmative instances. “It is
in this induction,” Bacon adds, “that our chief hope lies.”</p>
<p>Bacon’s new organ has never been constructed, and all wits and
understandings have not yet been placed on a level.</p>
<p>We come back to the mystery of Francis Bacon, the possessor of the
most exquisite intellect that was ever bestowed on any of the children
of men. As an historian, he gives us a taste of his quality in “Henry
VII.” In the Essays and the “Novum Organum,” sayings which have the
effect of axioms are at once striking and self-evident. But he is always
desultory. In perceiving analogies between things which have nothing in
common he never had an equal, and this characteristic, to quote
Macaulay, “occasionally obtained the mastery over all his other
faculties and led him into absurdities into which no dull man could have
fallen.” His memory was so stored with materials, and these so diverse,
that in similitude or with comparison he passed from subject to subject.
In the “Advancement of Learning” are enumerated the deficiencies which
Bacon observed, nearly the whole of which were supplied during his
lifetime.</p>
<p>The “Sylva Sylvarum” is the most extraordinary jumble of facts and
observations that has ever been brought together. It is a literary
curiosity. The “New Atlantis” and other short works in quantity amount
to very little. Bacon’s life has hitherto remained unaccounted for. In
the foregoing pages an attempt has been made to offer an intelligible
explanation of the work to which he devoted his life, namely, to supply
the deficiencies which he had himself pointed out and which retarded the
advancement of learning.</p>
<p>Hallam has said of Bacon: “If we compare what may be found in the
sixth, seventh, and eighth books of the ‘De Augmentis,’ and the various
short treatises contained in his works on moral and political wisdom and
on human nature, with the rhetoric, ethics, and politics of Aristotle,
or with the historians most celebrated for their deep insight into civil
society and human character — with Thucydides, Tacitus, Phillipe de
Comines, Machiavel, David Hume — we shall, I think, find that one man
may almost be compared with all of these together.”</p>
<p>Pope wrote: “Lord Bacon was the greatest genius that England, or
perhaps any other country, ever produced.” If an examination, more
thorough than has hitherto been made, of the records and literature of
his age establishes beyond doubt the truth of the suggestions which have
now been put forward, what more can be said? This at any rate, that to
him shall be given that title to which he aspired and for which he was
willing to renounce his own name. He shall be called “The Benefactor of
Mankind.”</p>
<p>APPENDIX.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Bodley left behind him a short history of his life which
is of a fragmentary description. One-fourth of it is devoted to a record
of how much he suffered in permitting Essex to urge his advancement in
the State. The following is the passage: —</p>
<p>“Now here I can not choose but in making report of the principall
accidents that have fallen unto me in the course of my life, but record
among the rest, that from the very first day I had no man more to friend
among the Lords of the Councell, than was the Lord Treasurer Burleigh:
for when occasion had beene offered of declaring his conceit as touching
my service, he would alwaies tell the Queen (which I received from her
selfe and some other ear-witnesses) that there was not any man in
England so meet as myselfe to undergoe the office of the Secretary. And
sithence his sonne, the present Lord Treasurer, hath signified unto me
in private conference, that when his father first intended to advance
him to that place, his purpose was withall to make me his Colleague. But
the case stood thus in my behalf: before such time as I returned from
the Provinces united, which was in the yeare 1597, and likewise after my
returne, the then Earle of Essex did use me so kindly both by letters
and messages, and other great tokens of his inward favours to me, that
although I had no meaning, but to settle in my mind my chiefest desire
and dependance upon the Lord Burleigh, as one that I reputed to be both
the best able, and therewithall the most willing to worke my advancement
with the Queene, yet I know not how, the Earle, who fought by all
devices to divert her love and liking both from the Father and the Son
(but from the Sonne in speciall) to withdraw my affection from the one
and the other, and to winne mee altogether to depend upon himselfe, did
so often take occasion to entertaine the Queene with some prodigall
speeches of my sufficiency for a Secretary, which were ever accompanied
with words of disgrace against the present Lord Treasurer, as neither
she her selfe, of whose favour before I was thoroughly assured, took any
great pleasure to preferre me the sooner, (for she hated his ambition,
and would give little countenance to any of his followers) and both the
Lord Burleigh and his Sonne waxed jealous of my courses, as if under
hand I had beene induced by the cunning and kindnesse of the Earle of
Essex, to oppose my selfe against their dealings. And though in very
truth they had no solid ground at all of the least alteration in my
disposition towards either of them both, (for I did greatly respect
their persons and places, with a settled resolution to doe them any
service, as also in my heart I detested to be held of any faction
whatsoever) yet the now Lord Treasurer, upon occasion of some talke,
that I have since had with him, of the Earle and his actions, hath
freely confessed of his owne accord unto me, that his daily provocations
were so bitter and sharpe against him, and his comparisons so odious,
when he put us in a ballance, as he thought thereupon he had very great
reason to use his best meanes, to put any man out of hope of raising his
fortune, whom the Earle with such violence, to his extreame prejudice,
had endeavoured to dignifie. And this, as he affirmed, was all the
motive he had to set himselfe against me, in whatsoever might redound to
the bettering of my estate, or increasing of my credit and countenance
with the Queene. When I hae thoroughly now bethought me, first in the
Earle, of the slender hold-fast that he had in the favour of the Queene,
of an endlesse opposition of the cheifest of our Statesmen like still to
waite upon him, of his perillous, and feeble, and uncertain advice, as
well in his owne, as in all the causes of his friends: and when moreover
for my selfe I had fully considered how very untowardly these two
Counsellours were affected unto me, (upon whom before in cogitation I
had framed all the fabrique of my future prosperity) how ill it did
concurre with my naturall disposition, to become, or to be counted
either a stickler or partaker in any publique faction, how well I was
able, by God’s good blessing, to live of my selfe, if I could be content
with a competent livelyhood; how short time of further life I was then
to expect by the common course of nature: when I had, I say, in this
manner represented to my thoughts my particular estate, together with
the Earles, I resolved thereupon to possesse my soule in peace all the
residue of my daies, to take my full farewell of State imployments, to
satisfie my mind with that mediocrity of worldly living that I had of my
owne, and so to retire me from the Court, which was the epilogue and end
of all my actions and endeavours of any important note, till I came to
the age of fifty-three.”</p>
<p>The experience of Bodley and Bacon appears to have been identical. It
certainly materially strengthens the case of those who contend that
Bacon’s conduct to Essex was not deserving of censure on the ground of
ingratitude for favours received from him.</p>
<p>The words which Robert Cecil addressed to Bodley, namely, that “he
had very great reason to use his best meanes, to put any man out of hope
of raising his fortune whom the Earle with such violence, to his
extreame prejudice had endeavoured to dignifie,” would with equal force
have been applied to Bacon’s case. The drift of Bodley’s account of the
matter points to his feeling that Essex’s conduct had not been of a
disinterested character, and suggests that he felt the Earle had been
making a tool of him.</p>
<p>The effect of this was that Bodley adopted the course which Bacon
threatened to adopt when refused the office of Attorney-General,
solicited for him by Essex — he took a farewell of State employments and
retired from the Court to devote himself to the service of his “Reverend
Mother, the University of Oxford,” and to the advancement of her good.
To this end he became a collector of books, whereas Bacon would have
become “some sorry book-maker or a true pioner in that mine of truth
which Anaxagoras said lay so deep.”</p>

<p>ENDNOTES.</p>
<p>1 Attention is drawn to one of the inaccuracies in “An Introduction
to Mathematics,” by A. W. Whithead, Sc.D., F.R.S., published in the Home
University Library of Modern Knowledge. The author says: “Macaulay in
his essay on Bacon contrasts the certainty of mathematics with the
uncertainty of philosophy, and by way of a rhetorical example he says,
‘There has been no re-action against Taylor’s theorem.’ He could not
have chosen a worse example. For, without having made an examination of
English text-books on mathematics contemporary with the publication of
this essay, the assumption is a fairly safe one that Taylor’s theorem
was enunciated and proved wrongly in every one of them.”</p>
<p>2 There are copies of this work bearing date 1626, the year in which
Bacon died.</p>
<p>3 The concluding paragraph of the Epistle to the Reader is as
follows: “It’s easily imaginable how unconcerned I am as to the fate of
this Book either in the History, or the Observations, since I have been
so faithful in the first, that it is not my own, but the Historians; and
so careful in the second that they are not mine, but the Histories.”</p>
<p>4 “Life and Letters,” Vol. VII., page 552.</p>
<p>5 Lloyd states that this occurred when he was seven years of age.</p>
<p>6 “The Lives of Statesmen and Favourites of Elizabeth.”</p>
<p>7 Dr. Whitgift was a man of strong moral rectitude, yet in 1593 he
became one of its sponsors on the publication of “Venus and Adonis.”</p>
<p>8 It was to Sir Amias that the custody of Mary Queen of Scots was
committed.</p>
<p>9 In the “Gesta Grayorum” one of the articles which the Knights of
the Helmet were required to vow to keep, each kissing his helmet as he
took his vow, was “Item — every Knight of this Order shall endeavour to
add conference and experiment to reading; and therefore shall not only
read and peruse ‘Guizo,’ ‘The French Academy,’ ‘Galiatto the Courtier,’
‘Plutarch,’ ‘The Arcadia,’ and the Neoterical writers from time to
time,” etc. The “Gesta Grayorum,” which was written in 1594, was not
published until 1687. The manuscript was probably incorrectly read as to
the titles of the books. “Galiatto,” apparently, should be “Galateo,”
described in a letter of Gabriel Harvey as “The Italian Archbishop brave
Galateo.” The “Courtier” is the Italian work by Castiglione which was
Englished by Sir Thomas Hoby. “Guizo” should be “Guazzo.” Stefano
Guazzo’s “Civil Conversation” — four books — was Englished by G. Pettie
and Young.</p>
<p>10 “Hit” is used by Chaucer as the past participle of “Hide.” The
name thus yields a suggestive anagram, “Bacohit.”</p>
<p>11 1618 Edition, page 712.</p>
<p>12 In addition to this and to the “Gesta Grayorum” (1692) I have only
been able to find two references to “The French Academy” in the works of
English writers.</p>
<p>J. Payne Collier, in his “Poetical Decameron,” Vol. II., page 271,
draws attention to the epistle “to the Christian reader” prefixed to the
second part, and suggests that the initials T.B. which occur at the end
of the dedicatory epistle stand for Thomas Beard, the author of “Theatre
of God’s Judgments.” Collier does not appear to have read “The French
Academy.” Dibdin, in “Notes on More’s Utopia,” says, “But I entreat the
reader to examine (if he be fortunate enough to possess the book) “The
French Academy of Primaudaye,” a work written in a style of peculiarly
impressive eloquence, and which, not very improbably, was the foundation
of Derham’s and Paley’s “Natural Theology.”</p>
<p>13 “It being now forty years as I remember, since I composed a
juvenile work on this subject which with great confidence and a
magnificent title I named “The greatest birth of Time.”</p>
<p>14 The block was used on page 626 of the 1594 quarto edition of
William Camden’s “Britannia,” published in London by George Bishop, who
was the publisher of the 1586, 1589, and 1594 editions of “The French
Academy.” There is a marginal note at the foot of the imprint of the
block commencing “R. Bacons.” Francis Bacon is known to have assisted
Camden in the preparation of this work. The manuscript bears evidence of
the fact in his handwriting.</p>
<p>15 One copy of this edition bears the date 1628.</p>
<p>16 Probably Owen Felltham, author of “Felltham’s Resolves.”</p>
<p>17 Sir Thomas Smith (1512-1577) was Secretary of State under Edward
VI. and Elizabeth — a good scholar and philosopher. He, when Greek
lecturer and orator at Cambridge, with John Cheke, introduced, in spite
of strong opposition, the correct way of speaking Greek, restoring the
pronunciation of the ancients.</p>
<p>18 State Paper Office; French Correspondence.</p>
<p>19 Spedding prints this in small type, being doubtful as to the
authorship.</p>
<p>20 That is, never held a brief.</p>
<p>21 I am indebted to Mr. Harold Hardy for this interesting
information. There is an entry in the State Papers, 1608, Jan. 31: Grant
at the suit of Sir Francis Bacon to Sir William Cooke, Sir John
Constable, and three others, of the King’s reversion of the estates in
Herts above referred to. Sir Nicholas, to whom it had descended from the
Lord Keeper, conveyed the remainder to Queen Elizabeth her heirs and
successors “with the condition that if he paid £100 the grant should be
void, which was apparently done to prevent the said Sir Francis to
dispose of the same land which otherwise by law he might have done.”
When Lady Anne conveyed the Markes estate to Francis it was subject to a
similar condition, namely, that the grant was to be null and void on
Lady Ann paying ten shillings to Francis. This condition made it
impossible for Francis to dispose of his interest in the estate, hence
Anthony’s request in the letter above referred to. It is obvious that
his relatives considered that Francis was not to be trusted with
property which he could turn into money. There was evidently some heavy
strain on his resources which caused him to convert everything he could
into cash.</p>

Biography: Francis Bacon by Robert Adamson</h2>
<p>From ‘1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 3’</p>
<p>FRANCIS BACON (Baron Verulam, Viscount St Albans) (1561-1626),
English philosopher, statesman and essayist, was born at York House in
the Strand, London, on the 22nd of January 1560/1. He was the youngest
son of Sir Nicholas Bacon (q.v.). His mother, the second wife of Sir
Nicholas, was a daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, formerly tutor to Edward
VI. She was a woman of considerable culture, well skilled in the
classical studies of the period, and a warm adherent of the Reformed or
Puritan Church. Very little is known of Bacon’s early life and
education. His health being then, as always, extremely delicate, he
probably received much of his instruction at home. In April 1573 he was
entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, where for three years he resided
with his brother Anthony. At Cambridge he applied himself diligently to
the several sciences as then taught, and came to the conclusion that the
methods employed and the results attained were alike erroneous. Although
he preserved a reverence for Aristotle (of whom, however, he seems to
have known but little), he learned to despise the current Aristotelian
philosophy. It yielded no fruit, was serviceable only for disputation,
and the end it proposed to itself was a mistaken one. Philosophy must be
taught its true purpose, and for this purpose a new method must be
devised. With the first germs of this great conception in his mind,
Bacon left the university.</p>
<p>On the 27th of June 1576 he and his brother Anthony were entered de
societate magistrorum at Gray’s Inn, and a few months later he was sent
abroad with Sir Amyas Paulet, the English ambassador at Paris. The
disturbed state of government and society in France at that time
afforded him valuable political instruction. It was formerly supposed
that certain Notes on the State of Christendom, usually printed in his
works, contain the results of his observations, but Spedding has shown
that there is no reason for ascribing these Notes to him, and that they
may be attributed with more probability to one of his brother Anthony’s
correspondents.</p>
<p>The sudden death of his father in February 1578/9 necessitated
Bacon’s return to England, and exercised a very serious influence on his
fortunes. A considerable sum of money had been laid up by Sir Nicholas
for the purchase of an estate for his youngest son, the only one
otherwise unprovided for. Owing to his sudden death, this intention was
not carried out, and a fifth only of the money descended to Francis.
This was one of the gravest misfortunes of his life; he started with
insufficient means, acquired a habit of borrowing and was never
afterwards out of debt. As it had become necessary that he should adopt
some profession, he selected that of law, and took up his residence at
Gray’s Inn in 1579.</p>
<p>In the fragment De Interpretatione Naturae Prooemium (written
probably about 1603) Bacon analyses his own mental character and lays
before us the objects he had in view when he entered on public life. If
his opening sentence, “Ego cum me ad utilitates humanas natum
existimarem” (“since I thought myself born to be of advantage to
mankind”), seems at first sight a little arrogant, it must be remembered
that it is the arrogance of Aristotle’s μεγαλόψυχος, who thinks himself
worthy of great things, and is worthy. The ideal of production of good
to the human race through the discovery of truth, was combined in him
with the practical desire to be of service to his country. He purposed,
therefore, to obtain, if possible, some honourable post in the state
which would give him the means of realizing these projects, and would
enable him to do somewhat for the church, the third of the objects whose
good he had at heart. The constant striving after these three ends is
the key to Bacon’s life. His qualifications for accomplishing the task
were not small. His intellect was far-seeing and acute, quick and yet
cautious, meditative, methodical and free from prejudice. If we add to
this account that he seems to have been of an unusually amiable
disposition we have a fairly complete picture of his mental character at
this critical period of his life.</p>
<p>In 1580 he appears to have taken the first step in his career by
applying, through his uncle, Burghley, the lord treasurer, for some post
at court. His suit, though well received by the queen, was unsuccessful;
the particulars are totally unknown. For two years after this
disappointment he worked quietly at Gray’s Inn, and in 1582 was admitted
an outer barrister. In 1584 he took his seat in parliament for Melcombe
in Dorsetshire, but the notes for the session do not disclose what
reputation he gained. About the same time he made another application to
Burghley, apparently with a view to expediting his progress at the bar.
His uncle, who appears to have “taken his zeal for ambition,” wrote him
a severe letter, taking him to task for arrogance and pride, qualities
which Bacon vehemently disclaimed. As his advancement at the bar was
unusually rapid, his uncle’s influence may have been exerted in his
behalf. In 1589 he received the first substantial piece of patronage
from his powerful kinsman, the reversion of the clerkship of the Star
Chamber. The office was worth about £1600 a year; but it did not become
vacant for nearly twenty years. A considerable period of his life thus
slipped away, and his affairs had not prospered. He had written on the
condition of parties in the church; he had set down his thoughts on
philosophical reform in the lost tract, Temporis Partus Maximus; but he
had failed in obtaining the position which he looked upon as an
indispensable condition of success. A long and eloquent letter to
Burghley throws additional light upon his character, and gives a hint as
to the cause of his uncle’s slackness in promoting him.</p>
<p>Some time before this, perhaps as early as 1588, Bacon appears to
have become acquainted with the earl of Essex, Elizabeth’s favourite. At
the close of 1591 he was acting as the earl’s confidential adviser, and
exerted himself, together with his brother Anthony, diligently in the
earl’s service. In February 1593 parliament was called, and Bacon took
his seat for Middlesex. The special occasion for which the House had
been summoned was the discovery of one of the numerous popish plots that
distracted Elizabeth’s reign.</p>
<p>As Bacon’s conduct in this emergency seriously affected his fortunes
and has been much misunderstood, it is necessary to state, as briefly as
possible, the whole facts of the case. The House having been duly
informed of the state necessities, assented to a double subsidy and
appointed a committee to draw up the requisite articles. Before this was
completed, a message arrived from the House of Lords requesting a
conference, which was granted. The committee of the Commons were then
informed that the crisis demanded a triple subsidy to be collected in a
shorter time than usual, that the Lords could not assent to less than
this, and that they desired to confer on the matter. This proposal of
the Lords to discuss supply infringed upon the privileges of the
Commons; accordingly, when the report of committee was read to the Lower
House, Bacon spoke against the proposed conference, pointing out at the
same time that a communication from the Lords might be received, but
that the actual deliberation on it must be taken by themselves alone.
His motion, after some delay, was carried and the conference was
rejected. The Lords upon this lowered their demands, and desired merely
to make a communication, which, being legitimate, was at once assented
to. The House had then before them the proposal for a triple subsidy, to
be collected in three, or, as the motion ultimately was shaped, in four
years, instead of in six, as the ordinary custom would have been. Bacon,
who approved of the increased subsidy, was opposed to the short period
in which it was proposed to raise it. He suggested that it would be
difficult or impossible for the people to meet such heavy demands, that
discontent and trouble would arise, and that the better method of
procedure was to raise money by levy or imposition. His motion appears
to have received no support, and the four years’ subsidy was passed
unanimously. Bacon, as it turned out, had been mistaken in thinking that
the country would be unable to meet the increased taxation, and his
conduct, though prompted by a pure desire to be of service to the queen,
gave deep and well-nigh ineradicable offence. He was accused of seeking
popularity, and was for a time excluded from the court. His letter to
Burghley, who had told him of the queen’s displeasure with his speech,
offers no apology for what he had said, but expresses regret that his
motives should have been misunderstood. He soon felt that the queen’s
anger was not to be appeased by such a justification. The
attorney-generalship had fallen vacant and Bacon became a candidate for
the office, his most formidable rival being his life-long antagonist,
Edward Coke, who was then solicitor. Essex warmly espoused Bacon’s cause
and earnestly pressed his claims upon the queen; but his impetuous,
pettish pleading tended to retard the cause. Burghley, on the other
hand, in no way promoted his nephew’s interest; he would recommend him
for the solicitorship, but not for the attorney-generalship; and it is
not improbable that Sir Robert Cecil secretly used his influence against
his cousin. The queen delayed the appointment, and Bacon’s fortunes, as
they then stood, could ill brook delay. He was harassed with debt and at
times so disheartened that he contemplated retirement from public life.
In March 1594 it was at last understood that Coke was to be
attorney-general. Essex, though bitterly mortified, at once threw all
his energies into the endeavour to procure for Bacon the solicitorship;
but in this case also, his method of dealing, which was wholly opposed
to Bacon’s advice, seemed to irritate the queen. The old offence was not
yet forgiven, and after a tedious delay, the office was given, in
October 1595, to Serjeant Thomas Fleming. Burghley and Sir John
Puckering seem to have assisted Bacon honestly, if not over-warmly, in
this second application; but the conduct of Cecil had roused suspicions
which were not perhaps without foundation. Essex, to compensate in some
degree for Bacon’s disappointment, insisted on presenting him with a
piece of land, worth about £1800, and situated probably near Twickenham
Park. Nor did his kindness cease there; before sailing on the expedition
to Cadiz, in the beginning of 1596, he addressed letters to Buckhurst,
Fortescue and Egerton, earnestly requesting them to use their influence
towards procuring for Bacon the vacant office of master of the rolls.
Before anything came of this application, the Cadiz expedition had
resulted in a brilliant success, and Essex became the idol of the army
and the people. Bacon saw clearly that such a reputation would assuredly
alienate the affections of the queen, who loved not to have a subject
too powerful or too popular. He therefore addressed an eloquent and
imploring letter to the earl, pointing out the dangers of his position
and urging upon him what he judged to be the only safe course of action,
to seek and secure the favour of the queen alone; above all things
dissuading him from the appearance of military popularity. His advice,
however, was unpalatable and proved ineffectual. The earl still
continued his usual course of dealing with the queen, depending solely
upon her supposed affection for him, and insanely jealous of any other
whom she might seem to favour. His unskilful and unlucky management of
the sea expedition to Ferrol and the Azores in no way lowered his
popularity with the people, but undoubtedly weakened his influence with
the queen.</p>
<p>Bacon’s affairs in the meantime had not been prospering. He had
increased his reputation by the publication in 1597 of his Essays, along
with which were the Colours of Good and Evil and the Meditationes
Sacrae; but his private fortunes were in a bad condition. No public
office apparently could be found for him; a scheme for retrieving his
position by a marriage with the wealthy widow, Lady Elizabeth Hatton,
failed, and in 1598 he was arrested for debt. He seems, however, to have
been growing in favour with the queen. Some years previously (perhaps
about 1594), he had begun to be employed by her in crown affairs, and he
gradually acquired the standing of one of the learned counsel, though he
had no commission or warrant, and received no salary. At the same time
he was no longer on the former friendly terms with Essex, a certain
estrangement having sprung up between them, caused no doubt by the
earl’s dislike of his friend’s advice. The earl’s affairs were then at a
somewhat critical stage, and as our judgment upon a most important
episode in Bacon’s life depends upon our knowledge of the events of the
ensuing year, it will be requisite to enter somewhat minutely into
proceedings with which Bacon himself had nothing to do.</p>
<p>Ireland was then in a rebellious and discontented condition, and it
was difficult for the English government to decide either on a definite
course of policy with regard to it, or on a leader by whom that policy
might be carried out. A violent quarrel took place between the queen and
Essex, who for some months retired from court and refused to be
reconciled. At last he came forth from his seclusion, and it was soon
understood that he was in person to undertake the subjugation of the
rebels in Ireland, with a larger force than had ever before been sent
into that country. Into the obscure details of this unhappy campaign it
is unnecessary to enter; one fact stands out clearly, that Essex
endeavoured to carry out a treasonable design. His jealousy and
ill-temper had been so roused that the only course open to him seemed to
be the obtaining a powerful military force, the possession of which
would compel the queen to reinstate him in her favour. Whether or not
this plan was in contemplation before he undertook the Irish expedition
is not evident, though even outsiders at that time entertained some
suspicions, but there can be no doubt of the treasonable character of
the negotiations carried on in Ireland. His plans, probably not very
definite, were disturbed by an imperative message from the queen,
ordering him not to return to England without her permission. He at once
set off, and, trusting apparently to her affection for him, presented
himself suddenly before her. He was, for the moment, received kindly,
but was soon afterwards ordered to keep his chamber, and was then given
into the custody of the lord keeper at York House, where he remained
till March 1600. His great popularity, and the general ignorance of the
reasons for his imprisonment, stirred up a strong feeling against the
queen, who was reported to be influenced by Bacon, and such indignation
was raised against the latter that his friends feared his life would be
in danger. It was at last felt necessary that the queen should in some
way vindicate her proceedings, and this she at first did, contrary to
Bacon’s advice, by a declaration from the Star Chamber. This, however,
gave little or no satisfaction, and it was found expedient to do what
Bacon had always recommended, to have a fair trial, yet not one in which
the sentence must needs be damaging to the earl. The trial accordingly
took place before a body of her majesty’s councillors, and Bacon had a
subordinate and unimportant part in the accusation. Essex does not seem
to have been at all hurt by his action in this matter, and shortly after
his release they were again on friendly terms, Bacon drawing up letters
as if to or from the earl with the design of having them brought before
the queen. But Bacon did not know the true character of the transactions
in which Essex had been engaged. The latter had been released from all
custody in August, but in the meantime he had been busily engaged in
treasonable correspondence with James of Scotland, and was counting on
the Irish army under his ally, Charles Blount, Baron Mountjoy
(afterwards earl of Devonshire), the new deputy. But Mountjoy had
apparently come to see how useless the attempt would be to force upon
the queen a settlement of the succession and declined to go farther in
the matter. Essex was thus thrown upon his own resources, and his anger
against the queen being roused afresh by the refusal to renew his
monopoly of sweet wines, he formed the desperate project of seizing her
person and compelling her to dismiss from her council his enemies
Raleigh, Cobham, and Cecil. As some pretext, he intended to affirm that
his life was in danger from these men, who were in league with the
Spaniards. The plot was forced on prematurely by the suspicions excited
at court, and the rash attempt to rouse the city of London (8th of
February 1601), proved a complete fiasco. The leaders were arrested that
night and thrown into prison. Although the actual rising might have
appeared a mere outburst of frantic passion, the private examinations of
the most prominent conspirators disclosed to the government a plot so
widely spread, and involving so many of the highest in the land, that it
would have been perilous to have pressed home accusations against all
who might be implicated. Essex was tried along with the young earl of
Southampton, and Bacon, as one of her majesty’s counsel, was present on
the occasion. Coke, who was principal spokesman, managed the case with
great want of skill, incessantly allowing the thread of the evidence to
escape, and giving the prisoners opportunity to indulge in irrelevant
justifications and protestations which were not ineffectual in
distracting attention from the real question at issue. On the first
opportunity Bacon rose and briefly pointed out that the earl’s plea of
having done nothing save what was absolutely necessary to defend his
life from the machinations of his enemies was weak and worthless,
inasmuch as these enemies were purely imaginary; and he compared his
case to that of Peisistratus, who had made use of a somewhat similar
stratagem to cloak his real designs upon the city of Athens. He was
thereupon interrupted by the earl, who proceeded to defend himself, by
declaring that in one of the letters drawn up by Bacon, and purporting
to be from the earl to Anthony Bacon, the existence of these rumours,
and the dangers to be apprehended from them, had been admitted; and he
continued, “If these reasons were then just and true, not counterfeit,
how can it be that now my pretences are false and injurious?” To this
Bacon replied, that “the letters, if they were there, would not blush to
be seen for anything contained in them, and that he had spent more time
in vain in studying how to make the earl a good servant to the queen
than he had done in any thing else.” It seems to be forgotten in the
general accounts of this matter, not only that Bacon’s letters bear out
what he said, but that the earl’s excuses were false. A second time
Bacon was compelled to interfere in the course of the trial, and to
recall to the minds of those present the real question at issue. He
animadverted strongly upon the puerile nature of the defence, and in
answer to a remark by Essex, that if he had wished to stir up a
rebellion he would have had a larger company with him, pointed out that
his dependence was upon the people of London, and compared his attempt
to that of the duke of Guise at Paris. To this the earl made little or
no reply. Bacon’s use of this illustration and of the former one of
Peisistratus, has been much commented on, and in general it seems to
have been thought that had it not been for his speeches Essex might have
escaped, or, at all events, have been afterwards pardoned. But this view
of the matter depends on the supposition that Essex was guilty only of a
rash outbreak. That this was not the case was well known to the queen
and her council. Unfortunately, prudential motives hindered the
publication of the whole evidence; the people, consequently, were still
ignorant of the magnitude of the crime, and, till recently, biographers
of Bacon have been in a like ignorance. The earl himself, before
execution, confessed his guilt and the thorough justice of his sentence,
while, with singular lack of magnanimity, he incriminated several
against whom accusations had not been brought, among others his sister
Lady Rich. After his execution it was thought necessary that some
account of the facts should be drawn up and circulated, in order to
remove the prejudice against the queen’s action in the matter. This was
entrusted to Bacon, who drew up a Declaration of the Practices and
Treasons attempted and committed by Robert, late Earl of Essex, his
first draft being extensively altered and corrected by the queen and
council. Nothing is known with certainty of the reception given to this
official explanation, but the ill-feeling against Bacon was not wholly
removed, and some years later, in 1604, he published, in the form of a
letter to Mountjoy, an Apology for his action in the case. This Apology
gives a most fair and temperate history of the relations between Bacon
and Essex, shows how the prudent counsel of the one had been rejected by
the other, and brings out very clearly what we conceive to be the true
explanation of the matter. Everything that Bacon could do was done by
him, until the real nature of Essex’s design was made apparent, and
then, as he had repeatedly told the earl, his devotion and respect were
for the queen and state, not for any subject; friendship could never
take rank above loyalty. Those who blame Bacon must acquit Essex of all
wrong-doing.</p>
<p>Bacon’s private fortunes, during the period after the death of Essex,
were not in a flourishing condition. He had obtained a grant of £1200
from the fines imposed on Catesby, one of the conspirators, but his
debts were sufficient to swallow up this and much more. And, though he
was trusted by Elizabeth, and on good terms with her, he seems to have
seen that he had no chance of advancement. But her death in 1603,
followed by the undisputed succession of James, gave him new hopes. He
used every means in his power to bring himself under James’s notice,
writing to all his friends at the Scottish court and to the king
himself. He managed to obtain a personal interview with the king, but
does not seem to have been much satisfied with it. In fact, while the
king confirmed in their situations those who had held crown offices
under Elizabeth, Bacon, not holding his post by warrant, was practically
omitted. He was, however, continued, by special order of the king, as
learned counsel extraordinary, but little or no law business appears to
have been entrusted to him. He procured, through his cousin Cecil, the
dignity of knighthood, which, contrary to his inclination, he received
along with about 300 others, on the 23rd of July 1603. Between this time
and the opening of James’s first parliament he was engaged in literary
work, and sent to the king two pamphlets — one on the Union, the other
on measures for the pacification of the church. Shortly after he
published his Apology. In March 1604 parliament met, and during their
short session Bacon’s hands seem to have been full of work. It was a
busy and stirring time, and events occurred during it which carried
within them the seeds of much future dissension. Prerogative and
privilege came more than once into collision, the abuses of purveyance
and wardship were made matters of conference, though the thorough
discussion of them was deferred to a succeeding session; while James’s
temper was irritated by the objections brought against his favourite
scheme of the Union, and by the attitude taken up by the House with
regard to religious affairs. The records are barely full enough to
enable us to judge of the share taken by Bacon in these discussions; his
name generally appears as the reporter of the committees on special
subjects. We can occasionally, however, discern traces of his tact and
remarkable prudence; and, on the whole, his attitude, particularly with
regard to the Union question, recommended him to James. He was shortly
afterwards formally installed as learned counsel, receiving the salary
of £40, and at the same time a pension of £60 yearly. He was also
appointed one of the commission to treat of the conditions necessary for
the Union; and the admirable manner in which the duties of that body
were discharged must be attributed mainly to his influence and his
complete mastery of the subject. During the recess he published his
Advancement of Learning, dedicated to the king.</p>
<p>He was now brought into relations with James, and his prospects began
to improve. It is important for us to know what were his ideas upon
government, upon parliaments, prerogative, and so forth, since a
knowledge of this will clear up much that would seem inexplicable in his
life. It seems quite evident that Bacon, from position, early training
and, one might almost think, natural inclination, held as his ideal of
government the Elizabethan system. The king was the supreme power, the
centre of law and justice, and his prerogative must not be infringed.
Parliament was merely a body called to consult with the king on
emergencies (circa ardua regni) and to grant supplies. King and
parliament together make up the state, but the former is first in nature
and importance. The duty of a statesman was, therefore, to carry out the
royal will in as prudent a manner as possible; he was the servant of the
king, and stood or fell according to his pleasure. He was not singular
in his opinions and he was undoubtedly sincere; and it is only by
keeping them constantly in mind that we can understand his after
relations with the king.</p>
<p>In the second parliament there was not so much scope for the exercise
of his powers. The Gunpowder Plot had aroused in the Commons warmer
feelings towards the king; they passed severe laws against recusants,
and granted a triple subsidy. At the same time they continued the
collection of the grievances concerning which they were to move. In the
course of this session Bacon married Alice Barnham “the alderman’s
daughter, an handsome maiden, to my liking,” of whom he had written some
years before to his cousin Cecil. Little or nothing is known of their
married life.</p>
<p>The third parliament was chiefly occupied with the commercial and
legal questions rising out of the proposed Union, in particular, with
the dispute as to the naturalization of the Post Nati. Bacon argued ably
in favour of this measure, but the general feeling was against it. The
House would only pass a bill abolishing hostile laws between the
kingdoms; but the case of the Post Nati, being brought before the law
courts, was settled as the king wished. Bacon’s services were rewarded
in June 1607 by the office of solicitor. Several years passed before he
gained another step. Meantime, though circumstances had thrown him too
much into active life, he had not forgotten his cherished project of
reorganizing natural science. A survey of the ground had been made in
the Advancement, and some short pieces not published at the time were
probably written in the subsequent two or three years. Towards the close
of 1607 he sent to his friends a small tract, entitled Cogitata et Visa,
probably the first draft of what we have under that title. In 1609 he
wrote the noble panegyric, In felicem memoriam Elizabethae, and the
curiously learned and ingenious work, De Sapientia Veterum; and
completed what seems to have been the Redargutio Philosophiarum, or
treatise on the “idols of the theatre.”</p>
<p>In 1610 the famous fourth parliament of James met. Prerogative,
despite Bacon’s advice and efforts, clashed more than once with liberty;
Salisbury’s bold schemes for relieving the embarrassment caused by the
reckless extravagance of the king proved abortive, and the House was
dissolved in February 1611. Bacon took a considerable share in the
debates, consistently upheld the prerogative, and seemed yet to possess
the confidence of the Commons. The death of Salisbury, occurring soon
after, opened a position in which Bacon thought his great political
skill and sagacity might be made more immediately available for the
king’s service. How far he directly offered himself for the post of
secretary is uncertain, but we know that his hopes were disappointed,
the king himself undertaking the duties of the office. About the same
time he made two ineffectual applications for the mastership of the
wards; the first, on Salisbury’s death, when it was given to Sir George
Carey; the second, on the death of Carey. It is somewhat hard to
understand why so little favour was shown by the king to one who had
proved himself able and willing to do good service, and who, in spite of
his disappointments, still continued zealously to offer advice and
assistance. At last in 1613, a fair opportunity for promotion occurred.
The death of Sir Thomas Fleming made a vacancy in the chief justiceship
of the king’s bench, and Bacon, after some deliberation, proposed to the
king that Coke should be removed from his place in the court of common
pleas and transferred to the king’s bench. He gives several reasons for
this in his letter to the king, but in all probability his chief motive
was that pointed out by Spedding, that in the court of king’s bench
there would be less danger of Coke coming into collision with the king
on questions of prerogative, in handling which Bacon was always very
circumspect and tender. The vacancy caused by Coke’s promotion was then
filled up by Hobart, and Bacon, finally, stepped into the place of
attorney-general. The fact of this advice being offered and followed in
all essentials, illustrates very clearly the close relations between the
king and Bacon, who had become a confidential adviser on most occasions
of difficulty. That his adherence to the royal party was already noticed
and commented on appears from the significant remark of Chamberlain,
who, after mentioning the recent changes among the law officials, says,
“There is a strong apprehension that … Bacon may prove a dangerous
instrument.”</p>
<p>Further light is thrown upon Bacon’s relations with James, and upon
his political sympathies, by the letter to the king advocating the
calling of a parliament, and by the two papers of notes on which his
letter was founded. These documents, even after due weight is given to
all considerations urged in their favour, seem to confirm the view
already taken of Bacon’s theory of government, and at the same time show
that his sympathies with the royal party tended to blind him to the true
character of certain courses of action, which can only be justified by a
straining of political ethics. The advice he offered, in all sincerity,
was most prudent and sagacious, and might have been successfully carried
out by a man of Bacon’s tact and skill; but it was intensely one-sided,
and exhibited a curious want of appreciation of what was even then
beginning to be looked on as the true relation of king, parliament and
people. Unfortunately for James, he could neither adopt nor carry out
Bacon’s policy. The parliament which met in April 1614, in which Bacon
sat for Cambridge University, and was dissolved in June, after a stormy
session, was by no means in a frame of mind suitable for the king’s
purposes. The House was enraged at the supposed project (then much
misunderstood) of the “Undertakers”; objection was taken to Bacon being
elected or serving as a member while holding office as attorney-general;
and, though an exception was made in his favour, it was resolved that no
attorney-general should in future be eligible for a seat in parliament.
No supply was granted, and the king’s necessities were increased instead
of diminished. The emergency suggested to some of the bishops the idea
of a voluntary contribution, which was eagerly taken up by the noblemen
and crown officials. The scheme was afterwards extended so as to take in
the whole kingdom, but lost something of its voluntary character, and
the means taken to raise the money, which were not what Bacon would have
recommended, were calculated to stir up discontent. The general
dissatisfaction received a somewhat unguarded and intemperate expression
in a letter sent to the justices of Marlborough by a gentleman of the
neighbourhood, named Oliver St John, in which he denounced the attempt
to raise funds in this way as contrary to law, reason and religion, as
constituting in the king personally an act of perjury, involving in the
same crime those who contributed, and thereby subjecting all parties to
the curses levelled by the church at such offences. St John was summoned
before the Star Chamber for slander and treasonable language; and Bacon,
ex officio, acted as public prosecutor. The sentence pronounced (a fine
of £5000 and imprisonment for life) was severe, but it was not actually
inflicted, and probably was not intended to be carried out, the success
of the prosecution being all that was desired. St John remained a short
time in prison, and was then released, after making a full apology and
submission. The fine was remitted. It seems incredible that Bacon’s
conduct on this occasion should have been censured by his biographers.
The offence was clear; the law was undoubted; no particular sympathy was
excited for the culprit; the sentence was not carried out; and Bacon did
only what any one in his place would naturally and necessarily have
done. The nature of his office involved him in several trials for
treason occurring about the same time, and one of these is of interest
sufficient to require a somewhat longer examination. Edmund Peacham had
been committed to custody for a libel on his superior, James Montagu
(1568?-1618), bishop of Bath and Wells. In searching his house for
certain papers, the officers came upon some loose sheets stitched
together in the form of a sermon, the contents of which were of such a
nature that it was judged right to lay them before the council. As it
was at first suspected that the writing of this book had been prompted
by some disaffected persons, Peacham was interrogated, and after he had
declined to give any information, was subjected to torture. Bacon, as
one of the learned counsel, was ordered by the council to take part in
this examination, which was undoubtedly warranted by precedent, whatever
may now be thought of it. Nothing, however, was extracted from Peacham
in this way, and it was resolved to proceed against him for treason.
Now, in the excited state of popular feeling at that period, the failure
of government to substantiate an accusation of treason would have been a
serious matter. The king, with whom the council agreed, seems therefore
to have thought it desirable to obtain beforehand the opinions of the
four chief judges as to whether the alleged offence amounted to treason.
In this there was nothing unusual or illegal, and no objection would at
that time have been made to it, but James introduced a certain
innovation; he proposed that the opinions of the four judges should be
given separately and in private. It may be reasonably inferred that his
motive for this was the suspicion, or it may be the knowledge, that Coke
did not consider the matter treasonable. At all events when Coke, who as
a councillor already knew the facts of the case, was consulted regarding
the new proposal of the king, he at once objected to it, saying that
“this particular and auricular taking of opinions” was “new and
dangerous,” and “not according to the custom of the realm.” He at last
reluctantly assented, and proposed that Bacon should consult with him,
while the other law officers addressed themselves to the three puisne
judges. By Bacon’s directions the proposal to the three judges to give
their opinions separately was made suddenly and confidently, and any
scruples they might have felt were easily overcome. The first step was
thus gained, and it was hoped that if “infusion” could be avoided, if
the papers bearing on the case were presented to the judges quickly, and
before their minds could be swayed by extraneous influence, their
decision on the case would be the same as that of the king. It is clear
that the extraneous influence to be feared was Coke, who, on being
addressed by Bacon, again objected to giving his opinion separately, and
even seemed to hope that his brother judges after they had seen the
papers would withdraw their assent to giving their decisions privately.
Even after the discussion of the case with Bacon, he would not give his
opinion until the others had handed in theirs. What the other judges
thought is not definitely known, but Bacon appears to have been unable
to put in operation the plan he had devised for swaying Coke’s judgment,
or if he did attempt it, he was unsuccessful, for Coke finally gave an
opinion consistent with what he seems to have held at first, that the
book was not treasonable, as it did not disable the king’s title.
Although the opinions of the judges were not made public, yet as we
learn, not only from Bacon, but from a sentence in one of Carleton’s
letters, a rumour had got about that there was doubt as to the book
being treasonable. Under these circumstances, Bacon, who feared that
such a report might incite other people to attempt a similar offence,
proposed to the king that a second rumour should be circulated in order
to destroy the impression caused by the first. “I do think it
necessary,” he says, “that because we live in an age in which no counsel
is kept, and that it is true there is some bruit abroad that the judges
of the king’s bench do doubt of the case that it should not be treason,
that it be given out constantly, and yet as it were in secret, and so a
fame to slide, that the doubt was only upon the publication, in that it
was never published. For that (if your majesty marketh it) taketh away
or at least qualifieth the danger of the example; for that will be no
man’s case.” Bacon’s conduct in this matter has been curiously
misrepresented. He has been accused of torturing the prisoner, and of
tampering with the judges by consulting them before the trial; nay, he
is even represented as selecting this poor clergyman to serve for an
example to terrify the disaffected, as breaking into his study and
finding there a sermon never intended to be preached, which merely
encouraged the people to resist tyranny. All this lavish condemnation
rests on a complete misconception of the case. If any blame attaches to
him, it must arise either from his endeavour to force Coke to a
favourable decision, in which he was in all probability prompted by a
feeling, not uncommon with him, that a matter of state policy was in
danger of being sacrificed to some senseless legal quibble or precedent,
or from his advice to the king that a rumour should be set afloat which
was not strictly true.</p>
<p>Bacon’s share in another great trial which came on shortly
afterwards, the Overbury and Somerset case, is not of such a nature as
to render it necessary to enter upon it in detail. It may be noted,
however, that his letters about this time show that he had become
acquainted with the king’s new favourite, the brilliant Sir George
Villiers, and that he stood high in the king’s good graces. In the early
part of 1616, when Thomas Egerton, Baron Ellesmere (c. 1540-1617), the
lord chancellor, was dangerously ill, Bacon wrote a long and careful
letter to the king, proposing himself for the office, should it fall
vacant, and stating as frankly as possible of what value he considered
his services would be. In answer, he appears to have received a distinct
promise of the reversion of the office; but, as Ellesmere recovered, the
matter stood over for a time. He proposed, however, that he should be
made a privy councillor, in order to give him more weight in his almost
recognized position of adviser to the king, and on the 9th of June 1616
he took the oaths and his seat at the council board.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his great rival Coke, whose constant tendency to limit the
prerogative by law and precedent had made him an object of particular
dislike to James, had on two points come into open collision with the
king’s rights. The first case was an action of praemunire against the
court of chancery, evidently instigated by him, but brought at the
instance of certain parties whose adversaries had obtained redress in
the chancellor’s court after the cause had been tried in the court of
king’s bench. With all his learning and ingenuity Coke failed in
inducing or even forcing the jury to bring in a bill against the court
of chancery, and it seems fairly certain that on the technical point of
law involved he was wrong. Although his motive was, in great measure, a
feeling of personal dislike towards Ellesmere, yet it is not improbable
that he was influenced by the desire to restrict in every possible way
the jurisdiction of a court which was the direct exponent of the king’s
wishes. The other case, that of the commendams, was more important in
itself and in the circumstances connected with it. The general question
involved in a special instance was whether or not the king’s prerogative
included the right of granting at pleasure livings in commendam, i.e. to
be enjoyed by one who was not the incumbent. Bacon, as attorney-general,
delivered a speech, which has not been reported; but the king was
informed that the arguments on the other side had not been limited to
the special case, but had directly impugned the general prerogative
right of granting livings. It was necessary for James, as a party
interested, at once to take measures to see that the decision of the
judges should not be given on the general question without due
consultation. He accordingly wrote to Bacon, directing him to intimate
to the judges his pleasure that they should delay judgment until after
discussion of the matter with himself. Bacon communicated first with
Coke, who in reply desired that similar notice should be given to the
other judges. This was done by Bacon, though he seems to hint that in so
doing he was going a little beyond his instructions. The judges took no
notice of the intimation, proceeded at once to give judgment, and sent a
letter in their united names to the king announcing what they had done,
and declaring that it was contrary to law and to their oath for them to
pay any attention to a request that their decision should be delayed.
The king was indignant at this encroachment, and acting partly on the
advice of Bacon, held a council on the 6th of June 1616, at which the
judges attended. James then entered at great length into the case,
censuring the judges for the offensive form of their letter, and for not
having delayed judgment upon his demand, which had been made solely
because he was himself a party concerned. The judges, at the conclusion
of his speech, fell on their knees, and implored pardon for the manner
of their letter; but Coke attempted to justify the matter contained in
it, saying that the delay required by his majesty was contrary to law.
The point of law was argued by Bacon, and decided by the chancellor in
favour of the king, who put the question to the judges individually,
“Whether, if at any time, in a case depending before the judges, which
his majesty conceived to concern him either in power or profit, and
thereupon required to consult with them, and that they should stay
proceedings in the meantime, they ought not to stay accordingly?” To
this all gave assent except Coke, who said that “when the case should
be, he would do that should be fit for a judge to do.” No notice was
taken by the king of this famous, though somewhat evasive, reply, But
the judges were again asked what course they would take in the special
case now before them. They all declared that they would not decide the
matter upon general grounds affecting the prerogative, but upon special
circumstances incident to the case; and with this answer they were
dismissed. Bacon’s conduct throughout the affair has been blamed, but
apparently on wrong grounds. As attorney he was merely fulfilling his
duty in obeying the command of the king; and in laying down the law on
the disputed point, he was, we may be sure, speaking his own
convictions. Censure might more reasonably be bestowed on him because he
deliberately advised a course of action than which nothing can be
conceived better calculated to strengthen the hands of an absolute
monarch. This appeared to Bacon justifiable and right, because the
prerogative would be defended and preserved intact. Coke certainly
stands out in a better light, not so much for his answer, which was
rather indefinite, and the force of which is much weakened by his assent
to the second question of the king, but for the general spirit of
resistance to encroachment exhibited by him. He was undeniably
troublesome to the king, and it is no matter for wonder that James
resolved to remove him from a position where he could do so much harm.
On the 26th June he was called before the council to answer certain
charges, one of which was his conduct in the praemunire question. He
acknowledged his error on that head, and made little defence. On the
30th he was suspended from council and bench, and ordered to employ his
leisure in revising certain obnoxious opinions in his reports. He did
not perform the task to the king’s satisfaction, and a few months later
he was dismissed from office.</p>
<p>Bacon’s services to the king’s cause had been most important; and as
he had, at the same time, acquired great favour with Villiers, his
prospects looked brighter than before. According to his custom, he
strove earnestly to guide by his advice the conduct of the young
favourite. His letters, in which he analyses the various relations in
which such a man must stand, and prescribes the course of action
suitable for each, are valuable and deserving of attention. Very
striking, in view of future events, are the words in which he gives him
counsel as to his dealing with judges: “By no means be you persuaded to
interpose yourself by word or letter in any cause depending, or like to
be depending, in any court of justice, nor suffer any man to do it where
you can hinder it; and by all means dissuade the king himself from it,
upon the importunity of any, either for their friends or themselves. If
it should prevail, it perverts justice; but if the judge be so just, and
of so undaunted a courage (as he ought to be) as not to be inclined
thereby, yet it always leaves a taint of suspicions and prejudice behind
it.” It is probable that Villiers at this time had really a sense of the
duties attaching to his position and was willing to be guided by a man
of approved wisdom. It was not long before an opportunity occurred for
showing his gratitude and favour. Ellesmere resigned the chancellorship
on the 5th of March 1616/7, and on the 7th the great seal was bestowed
upon Bacon, with the title of lord keeper. Two months later he took his
seat with great pomp in the chancery court, and delivered a weighty and
impressive opening discourse. He entered with great vigour on his new
labours, and in less than a month he was able to report to Buckingham
that he had cleared off all outstanding chancery cases. He seemed now to
have reached the height of his ambition; he was the first law officer in
the kingdom, the accredited minister of his sovereign, and on the best
terms with the king and his favourite. His course seemed perfectly
prosperous and secure, when a slight storm arising opened his eyes to
the frailty of the tenure by which he held his position.</p>
<p>Coke was in disgrace but not in despair; there seemed to be a way
whereby he could reconcile himself to Buckingham, through the marriage
of his daughter, who had an ample fortune, to Sir John Villiers, brother
of the marquess, who was penniless or nearly so. The match was
distasteful to Lady Hatton and to her daughter; a violent quarrel was
the consequence, and Bacon, who thought the proposed marriage most
unsuitable, took Lady Hatton’s part. His reasons for disapproval he
explained to the king and Buckingham, but found to his surprise that
their indignation was strongly roused against him. He received from both
bitter letters of reproof; it was rumoured that he would be disgraced,
and Buckingham was said to have compared his present conduct to his
previous unfaithfulness to Essex. Bacon, who seems to have acted from a
simple desire to do the best for Buckingham’s own interests, at once
changed his course, advanced the match by every means in his power, and
by a humble apology appeased the indignation that had been excited
against him. It had been a sharp lesson, but things seemed to go on
smoothly after it, and Bacon’s affairs prospered.</p>
<p>On the 4th of January 1617/8 he received the higher title of lord
chancellor; in July of the same year he was made Baron Verulam and in
January 1620/1 he was created Viscount St Albans. His fame, too, had
been increased by the publication in 1620 of his most celebrated work,
the Novum Organum. He seemed at length to have made satisfactory
progress towards the realization of his cherished aims; the method
essential for his Instauration was partially completed; and he had
attained as high a rank in the state as he had ever contemplated. But
his actions in that position were not calculated to promote the good of
his country.</p>
<p>Connected with the years during which he held office is one of the
weightiest charges against his character. Buckingham, notwithstanding
the advice he had received from Bacon himself, was in the habit of
addressing letters to him recommending the causes of suitors. In many
cases these seem nothing more than letters of courtesy, and, from the
general tone, it might fairly be concluded that there was no intention
to sway the opinion of the judge illegally, and that Bacon did not
understand the letters in that sense. This view is supported by
consideration of the few answers to them which are extant. One
outstanding case, however, that of Dr Steward, casts some suspicion on
all the others. The terms of Buckingham’s note concerning it might
easily have aroused doubts; and we find that the further course of the
action was to all appearances exactly accommodated to Dr Steward, who
had been so strongly recommended. It is, of course, dangerous to form an
extreme judgment on an isolated and partially understood case, of which
also we have no explanation from Bacon himself, but if the
interpretation advanced by Heath be the true one, Bacon certainly
suffered his first, and, so far as we can see, just judgment on the case
to be set aside, and the whole matter to be reopened in obedience to a
request from Buckingham.</p>
<p>It is somewhat hard to understand Bacon’s position with regard to the
king during these years. He was the first officer of the crown, the most
able man in the kingdom, prudent, sagacious and devoted to the royal
party. Yet his advice was followed only when it chimed in with James’s
own will; his influence was of a merely secondary kind; and his great
practical skill was employed simply in carrying out the measures of the
king in the best mode possible. We know indeed that he sympathized
cordially with the home policy of the government; he had no objection to
such monopolies or patents as seemed advantageous to the country, and
for this he is certainly not to be blamed. The opinion was common at the
time, and the error was merely ignorance of the true principles of
political economy. But we know also that the patents were so numerous as
to be oppressive, and we can scarcely avoid inferring that Bacon more
readily saw the advantages to the government than the disadvantages to
the people. In November 1620, when a new parliament was summoned to meet
on January following, he earnestly pressed that the most obnoxious
patents, those of alehouses and inns, and the monopoly of gold and
silver thread, should be given up, and wrote to Buckingham, whose
brothers were interested, advising him to withdraw them from the
impending storm. This prudent advice was unfortunately rejected. But
while he went cordially with the king in domestic affairs, he was not
quite in harmony with him on questions of foreign policy. Not only was
he personally in favour of a war with Spain for the recovery of the
Palatinate, but he foresaw in such a course of action the means of
drawing together more closely the king and his parliament. He believed
that the royal difficulties would be removed if a policy were adopted
with which the people could heartily sympathize, and if the king placed
himself at the head of his parliament and led them on. But his advice
was neglected by the vacillating and peace-loving monarch, his proffered
proclamation was put aside, and a weak, featureless production
substituted in its place. Nevertheless the new parliament seemed at
first more responsive than might have been looked for. A double subsidy
was granted, which was expressly stated to be “not on any consideration
or condition for or concerning the Palatinate.” The session, however,
was not far advanced when the question of patents was brought up; a
determined attack was made upon the very ones of which Bacon had been in
dread, and it was even proposed to proceed against the referees (Bacon
and Montagu) who had certified that there was no objection to them in
point of law. This proposal, though pressed by Coke, was allowed to
drop; while the king and Buckingham, acting under the advice of
Williams, afterwards lord keeper, agreed to give up the monopolies. It
was evident, however, that a determined attack was about to be made upon
Bacon, and that the proceeding against the referees was really directed
against him. It is probable that this charge was dropped because a more
powerful weapon had in the meantime been placed in his enemies’ hands.
This was the accusation of bribery and corrupt dealings in chancery
suits, an accusation apparently wholly unexpected by Bacon, and the
possibility of which he seems never to have contemplated until it was
actually brought against him. At the beginning of the session a
committee had been appointed for inquiring into abuses in the courts of
justice. Some illegal practices of certain chancery officials had been
detected and punished by the court itself, and generally there was a
disposition to overhaul its affairs, while Coke and Lionel Cranfield,
earl of Middlesex (1575-1645) directly attacked some parts of the
chancellor’s administration. But on the 14th of March one Christopher
Aubrey appeared at the bar of the House, and charged Bacon with having
received from him a sum of money while his suit was going on, and with
having afterwards decided against him. Bacon’s letter on this occasion
is worthy of serious attention; he evidently thought the charge was but
part of the deliberate scheme to ruin him which had already been in
progress. A second accusation (Edward Egerton’s case) followed
immediately after, and was investigated by the House, who, satisfied
that they had just matter for reprehension, appointed the 19th for a
conference with the Lords. On that day Bacon, as he had feared, was too
ill to attend. He wrote to the Lords excusing his absence, requesting
them to appoint a convenient time for his defence and cross-examination
of witnesses, and imploring them not to allow their minds to be
prejudiced against him, at the same time declaring that he would not
“trick up an innocency with cavillations, but plainly and ingenuously
declare what he knew or remembered.” The charges rapidly accumulated,
but Bacon still looked upon them as party moves, and was in hopes of
defending himself. Nor did he seem to have lost his courage, if we are
to believe the common reports of the day, though certainly they do not
appear worthy of very much credit.</p>
<p>The notes bearing upon the interview which he obtained with the king
show that he had begun to see more clearly the nature and extent of the
offences with which he was charged, that he now felt it impossible
altogether to exculpate himself, and that his hopes were directed
towards obtaining some mitigation of his sentence. The long roll of
charges made upon the 19th of April finally decided him; he gave up all
idea of defence, and wrote to the king begging him to show him favour in
this emergency. The next day he sent in a general confession to the
Lords, trusting that this would be considered satisfactory. The Lords,
however, decided that it was not sufficient as a ground for their
censure, and demanded a detailed and particular confession. A list of
twenty-eight charges was then sent him, to which an answer by letter was
required. On the 30th of April his “confession and humble submission”
was handed in. In it, after going over the several instances, he says,
“I do again confess, that on the points charged upon me, although they
should be taken as myself have declared them, there is a great deal of
corruption and neglect; for which I am heartily and penitently sorry,
and submit myself to the judgment, grace, and mercy of the court.” On
the 3rd of May, after considerable discussion, the Lords decided upon
the sentence, which was, That he should undergo fine and ransom of
£40,000; that he should be imprisoned in the Tower during the king’s
pleasure; that he should be for ever incapable of any office, place or
employment in the state or commonwealth; that he should never sit in
parliament, or come within the verge of the court. This heavy sentence
was only partially executed. The fine was in effect remitted by the
king; imprisonment in the Tower lasted for about four days; a general
pardon (not of course covering the parliamentary censure) was made out,
and though delayed at the seal for a time by Lord Keeper Williams, was
passed probably in November 1621. The cause of the delay seems to have
lain with Buckingham, whose friendship had cooled, and who had taken
offence at the fallen chancellor’s unwillingness to part with York
House. This difference was finally smoothed over, and it was probably
through his influence that Bacon received the much-desired permission to
come within the verge of the court. He never again sat in
parliament.</p>
<p>So ends this painful episode, which has given rise to the most severe
condemnation of Bacon, and which still presents great and perhaps
insuperable difficulties. On the whole, the tendency of the most recent
and thorough researches has been towards the opinion that Bacon’s own
account of the matter (from which, indeed, our knowledge of it is
chiefly drawn) is substantially correct. He distinguishes three ways in
which bribes may be given, and ingenuously confesses that his own acts
amounted to corruption and were worthy of condemnation. Now, corruption
strictly interpreted would imply the deliberate sale of justice, and
this Bacon explicitly denies, affirming that he never “had bribe or
reward in his eye or thought when he pronounced any sentence or order.”
When we analyse the specific charges against him, with his answers to
them, we find many that are really of little weight. The twenty-eighth
and last, that of negligence in looking after his servants, though it
did him much harm, may fairly be said to imply no moral blame. The
majority of the others are instances of gratuities given after the
decision, and it is to be regretted that the judgment of the peers gives
us no means of determining how such gifts were looked upon, whether or
not the acceptance of them was regarded as a “corrupt” practice. In four
cases specifically, and in some others by implication, Bacon confesses
that he had received bribes from suitors pendente lite. Yet he affirms,
as we said before, that his intention was never swayed by a bribe; and
so far as any of these cases can be traced, his decisions, often given
in conjunction with some other official, are to all appearance
thoroughly just. In several cases his judgment appears to have been
given against the party bestowing the bribe, and in at least one
instance, that of Lady Wharton, it seems impossible to doubt that he
must have known when accepting the present that his opinion would be
adverse to her cause. Although, then, he felt that these practices were
really corrupt, and even rejoiced that his own fall would tend to purify
the courts from them, he did not feel that he was guilty of perverting
justice for the sake of reward. How far, then, is such defence or
explanation admissible and satisfactory? It is clear that two things are
to be considered: the one the guilt of taking bribes or presents on any
consideration, the other the moral guilt depending upon the wilful
perversion of justice. The attempt has sometimes been made to defend the
whole of Bacon’s conduct on the ground that he did nothing that was not
done by many of his contemporaries. Bacon himself disclaims a defence of
this nature, and we really have no direct evidence which shows to what
extent the offering and receiving of such bribes then prevailed. That
the practice was common is indeed implied by the terms in which Bacon
speaks of it, and it is not improbable that the fact of these gifts
being taken by officials was a thing fairly well known, although all
were aware of their illegal character, and it was plain that any public
exposure of such dealings would be fatal to the individual against whom
the charge was made out. Bacon knew all this; he was well aware that the
practice was in itself indefensible, and that his conduct was therefore
corrupt and deserving of censure. So far, then, as the mere taking of
bribes is concerned, he would permit no defence, and his own confession
and judgment on his action contain as severe a condemnation as has ever
been passed upon him. Yet in the face of this he does not hesitate to
call himself “the justest chancellor that hath been in the five changes
since Sir Nicholas Bacon’s time”; and this on the plea that his
intentions had always been pure, and had never been affected by the
presents he received. His justification has been set aside by modern
critics, not on the ground that the evidence demonstrates its falsity,
but because it is inconceivable or unnatural that any man should receive
a present from another, and not suffer his judgment to be swayed
thereby. It need hardly be said that such an a priori conviction is not
a sufficient basis on which to found a sweeping condemnation of Bacon’s
integrity as an administrator of justice. On the other hand, even if it
be admitted to be possible and conceivable that a present should be
given by a suitor simply as seeking favourable consideration of his
cause, and not as desirous of obtaining an unjust decree, and should be
accepted by the judge on the same understanding, this would not entitle
one absolutely to accept Bacon’s statement. Further evidence is
necessary in order to give foundation to a definite judgment either way;
and it is extremely improbable, nay, almost impossible, that such can
ever be produced. In these circumstances, due weight should be given to
Bacon’s own assertions of his perfect innocence and purity of intention;
they ought not to be put out of court unless found in actual
contradiction to the facts, and the reverse of this is the case, so far
as has yet appeared.</p>
<p>The remaining five years of his life, though he was still harassed by
want of means, for James was not liberal, were spent in work far more
valuable to the world than anything he had accomplished in his high
office. In March 1622 he presented to Prince Charles his History of
Henry VII.; and immediately, with unwearied industry, set to work to
complete some portions of his great work. In November 1622 appeared the
Historia Ventorum; in January 1622/3, the Historia Vitae et Mortis; and
in October of the same year, the De Augmentis Scientiarum, a Latin
translation, with many additions, of the Advancement. Finally, in
December 1624, he published his Apophthegms, and Translations of some of
the Psalms, dedicated to George Herbert; and, in 1625, a third and
enlarged edition of the Essays.</p>
<p>Busily occupied with these labours, his life now drew rapidly to a
close. In March 1626 he came to London, and when driving one day near
Highgate, was taken with a desire to discover whether snow would act as
an antiseptic. He stopped his carriage, got out at a cottage, purchased
a fowl, and with his own hands assisted to stuff it with snow. He was
seized with a sudden chill, and became so seriously unwell that he had
to be conveyed to Lord Arundel’s house, which was near at hand. Here his
illness increased, the cold and chill brought on bronchitis and he died,
after a few days’ suffering, on the 9th of April 1626.</p>
<p>Bacon’s Works and Philosophy.</p>
<p>A complete survey of Bacon’s works and an estimate of his place in
literature and philosophy are matters for a volume. It is here proposed
merely to classify the works, to indicate their general character and to
enter somewhat more in detail upon what he himself regarded as his great
achievement, — the reorganization of the sciences and the exposition of
a new method by which the human mind might proceed with security and
certainty towards the true end of all human thought and action.</p>
<p>Putting aside the letters and occasional writings, we may
conveniently distribute the other works into three classes,
Professional, Literary, Philosophical. The Professional works include
the Reading on the Statute of Uses, the Maxims of Law and the treatise
(possibly spurious) on the Use of the Law. “I am in good hope,” said
Bacon himself, “that when Sir Edward Coke’s reports and my rules and
decisions shall come to posterity, there will be (whatsoever is now
thought) question who was the greater lawyer.” If Coke’s reports show
completer mastery of technical details, greater knowledge of precedent,
and more of the dogged grasp of the letter than do Bacon’s legal
writings, there can be no dispute that the latter exhibit an infinitely
more comprehensive intelligence of the abstract principles of
jurisprudence, with a richness and ethical fulness that more than
compensate for their lack of dry legal detail. Bacon seems indeed to
have been a lawyer of the first order, with a keen scientific insight
into the bearings of isolated facts and a power of generalization which
admirably fitted him for the self-imposed task, unfortunately never
completed, of digesting or codifying the chaotic mass of the English
law.</p>
<p>Among the literary works are included all that he himself designated
moral and historical pieces, and to these may be added some theological
and minor writings, such as the Apophthegms. Of the moral works the most
valuable are the Essays, which have been so widely read and universally
admired. The matter is of the familiar, practical kind, that “comes home
to men’s bosoms.” The thoughts are weighty, and even when not original
have acquired a peculiar and unique tone or cast by passing through the
crucible of Bacon’s mind. A sentence from the Essays can rarely be
mistaken for the production of any other writer. The short, pithy
sayings have become popular mottoes and household words. The style is
quaint, original, abounding in allusions and witticisms, and rich, even
to gorgeousness, with piled-up analogies and metaphors. The first
edition contained only ten essays, but the number was increased in 1612
to thirty-eight, and in 1625 to fifty-eight. The short tract, Colours of
Good and Evil, which with the Meditationes Sacrae originally accompanied
the Essays, was afterwards incorporated with the De Augmentis. Along
with these works may be classed the curiously learned piece, De
Sapientia Veterum, in which he works out a favourite idea, that the
mythological fables of the Greeks were allegorical and concealed the
deepest truths of their philosophy. As a scientific explanation of the
myths the theory is of no value, but it affords fine scope for the
exercise of Bacon’s unrivalled power of detecting analogies in things
apparently most dissimilar. The Apophthegms, though hardly deserving
Macaulay’s praise of being the best collection of jests in the world,
contain a number of those significant anecdotes which Bacon used with
such effect in his other writings. Of the historical works, besides a
few fragments of the projected history of Britain there remains the
History of Henry VII., a valuable work, giving a clear and animated
narrative of the reign, and characterizing Henry with great skill. The
style is in harmony with the matter, vigorous and flowing, but naturally
with less of the quaintness and richness suitable to more thoughtful and
original writings. The series of the literary works is completed by the
minor treatises on theological or ecclesiastical questions. Some of the
latter, included among the occasional works, are sagacious and prudent
and deserve careful study. Of the former, the principal specimens are
the Meditationes Sacrae and the Confession of Faith. The Paradoxes
(Characters of a believing Christian in paradoxes, and seeming
contradictions), which was often and justly suspected, has been
conclusively proved by Grosart to be the work of another author.</p>
<p>Philosophical Works. — The great mass of Bacon’s writings consists of
treatises or fragments, which either formed integral parts of his grand
comprehensive scheme, or were closely connected with it. More exactly
they may be classified under three heads: (A) Writings originally
intended to form parts of the Instauratio, but which were afterwards
superseded or thrown aside; (B) Works connected with the Instauratio,
but not directly included in its plan; (C) Writings which actually
formed part of the Instauratio Magna.</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>This class contains some important tracts, which certainly
contain little, if anything, that is not afterwards taken up and
expanded in the more elaborate works, but are not undeserving of
attention, from the difference in the point of view and method of
treatment. The most valuable of them are: (1) The Advancement of
Learning, of which no detailed account need be given, as it is
completely worked up into the De Augmentis, and takes its place as the
first part of the Instauratio. (2) Valerius Terminus, a very remarkable
piece, composed probably about 1603, though perhaps retouched at a later
period. It contains a brief and somewhat obscure outline of the first
two parts in the Instauratio, and is of importance as affording us some
insight into the gradual development of the system in Bacon’s own mind.
(3) Temporis Partus Masculus, another curious fragment, remarkable not
only from its contents, but from its style, which is arrogant and
offensive, in this respect unlike any other writing of Bacon’s. The
adjective masculus points to the power of bringing forth fruit possessed
by the new philosophy, and perhaps indicates that all previous births of
time were to be looked upon as feminine or imperfect; it is used in a
somewhat similar sense in Letters and Life, vi. 183, “In verbis
masculis, no flourishing or painted words, but such words as are fit to
go before deeds.” (4) Redargutio Philosophiarum, a highly finished piece
in the form of an oration, composed probably about 1608 or 1609, and
containing in pretty full detail much of what afterwards appears in
connexion with the Idola Theatri in book i. of the Novum Organum. (5)
Cogitata et Visa, perhaps the most important of the minor philosophical
writings, dating from 1607 (though possibly the tract in its present
form may have been to some extent altered), and containing in weighty
and sonorous Latin the substance of the first book of the Organum. (6)
The Descriptio Globi Intellectualis, which is to some extent
intermediate between the Advancement and the De Augmentis, goes over in
detail the general classification of the sciences, and enters
particularly on some points of minor interest. (7) The brief tract De
Interpretatione Naturae Sententiae Duodecim is evidently a first sketch
of part of the Novum Organum, and in phraseology is almost identical
with it. (8) A few smaller pieces, such as the Inquisitio de Motu, the
Calor et Frigus, the Historia Soni et Auditus and the Phaenomena
Universi, are early specimens of his Natural History, and exhibit the
first tentative applications of the new method.</p></li>
<li><p>The second group consists of treatises on subjects connected with
the Instauratio, but not forming part of it. The most interesting, and
in many respects the most remarkable, is the philosophic romance, the
New Atlantis, a description of an ideal state in which the principles of
the new philosophy are carried out by political machinery and under
state guidance, and where many of the results contemplated by Bacon are
in imagination attained. The work was to have been completed by the
addition of a second part, treating of the laws of a model commonwealth,
which was never written. Another important tract is the De Principiis
atque Originibus secundum Fabulas Cupidinis et Caeli, where, under the
disguise of two old mythological stories, he (in the manner of the
Sapientia Veterum) finds the deepest truths concealed. The tract is
unusually interesting, for in it he discusses at some length the limits
of science, the origin of things and the nature of primitive matter,
giving at the same time full notices of Democritus among the ancient
philosophers and of Telesio among the modern. Deserving of attention are
also the Cogitationes de Natura Rerum, probably written early, perhaps
in 1605, and the treatise on the theory of the tides, De Fluxu et
Refluxu Maris, written probably about 1616.</p></li>
<li><p>The philosophical works which form part of the Instauratio must
of course be classed according to the positions which they respectively
hold in that scheme of the sciences.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The great work, the reorganization of the sciences, and the
restoration of man to that command over nature which he had lost by the
fall, consisted in its final form of six divisions.</p>
<p>I. Partitiones Scientiarum, a survey of the sciences, either such as
then existed or such as required to be constructed afresh — in fact, an
inventory of all the possessions of the human mind. The famous
classification on which this survey proceeds is based upon an analysis
of the faculties and objects of human knowledge. This division is
represented by the De Augmentis Scientiarum.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li><p>Interpretatio Naturae. — After the survey of all that has yet
been done in the way of discovery or invention, comes the new method, by
which the mind of man is to be trained and directed in its progress
towards the renovation of science. This division is represented, though
only imperfectly, by the Novum Organum, particularly book ii.</p></li>
<li><p>Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis. — The new method is
valueless, because inapplicable, unless it be supplied with materials
duly collected and presented — in fact, unless there be formed a
competent natural history of the Phaenomena Universi. A short
introductory sketch of the requisites of such a natural history, which,
according to Bacon, is essential, necessary, the basis totius negotii,
is given in the tract Parasceve, appended to the Novum Organum. The
principal works intended to form portions of the history, and either
published by himself or left in manuscript, are Historia Ventorum,
Historia Vitae et Mortis, Historia Densi et Rari, and the extensive
collection of facts and observations entitled Sylva Sylvarum.</p></li>
<li><p>Scala Intellectus. — It might have been supposed that the new
philosophy could now be inaugurated. Materials had been supplied, along
with a new method by which they were to be treated, and naturally the
next step would be the finished result. But for practical purposes Bacon
interposed two divisions between the preliminaries and the philosophy
itself. The first was intended to consist of types or examples of
investigations conducted by the new method, serviceable for keeping the
whole process vividly before the mind, or, as the title indicates, such
that the mind could run rapidly up and down the several steps or grades
in the process. Of this division there seems to be only one small
fragment, the Filum Labyrinthi, consisting of but two or three
pages.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>V. Prodromi, forerunners of the new philosophy. This part, strictly
speaking, is quite extraneous to the general design. According to the
Distributio Operis, it was to contain certain speculations of Bacon’s
own, not formed by the new method, but by the unassisted use of his
understanding. These, therefore, form temporary or uncertain
anticipations of the new philosophy. There is extant a short preface to
this division of the work, and according to Spedding some of the
miscellaneous treatises, such as De Principiis, De Fluxu et Refluxu,
Cogitationes de Natura Rerum, may probably have been intended to be
included under this head. This supposition receives some support from
the manner in which the fifth part is spoken of in the Novum Organum, i.
116.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>The new philosophy, which is the work of future ages, and the result
of the new method.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bacon’s grand motive in his attempt to found the sciences anew was
the intense conviction that the knowledge man possessed was of little
service to him. “The knowledge whereof the world is now possessed,
especially that of nature, extendeth not to magnitude and certainty of
works.” Man’s sovereignty over nature, which is founded on knowledge
alone, had been lost, and instead of the free relation between things
and the human mind, there was nothing but vain notions and blind
experiments. To restore the original commerce between man and nature,
and to recover the imperium hominis, is the grand object of all science.
The want of success which had hitherto attended efforts in the same
direction had been due to many causes, but chiefly to the want of
appreciation of the nature of philosophy and its real aim. Philosophy is
not the science of things divine and human; it is not the search after
truth. “I find that even those that have sought knowledge for itself,
and not for benefit or ostentation, or any practical enablement in the
course of their life, have nevertheless propounded to themselves a wrong
mark, namely, satisfaction (which men call Truth) and not operation.”
“Is there any such happiness as for a man’s mind to be raised above the
confusion of things, where he may have the prospect of the order of
nature and error of man? But is this a view of delight only and not of
discovery? of contentment and not of benefit? Shall he not as well
discern the riches of nature’s warehouse as the beauty of her shop? Is
truth ever barren? Shall he not be able thereby to produce worthy
effects, and to endow the life of man with infinite commodities?”
Philosophy is altogether practical; it is of little matter to the
fortunes of humanity what abstract notions one may entertain concerning
the nature and the principles of things. This truth, however, has never
yet been recognized; it has not yet been seen that the true aim of all
science is “to endow the condition and life of man with new powers or
works,” or “to extend more widely the limits of the power and greatness
of man.” Nevertheless, it is not to be imagined that by this being
proposed as the great object of search there is thereby excluded all
that has hitherto been looked upon as the higher aims of human life,
such as the contemplation of truth. Not so, but by following the new aim
we shall also arrive at a true knowledge of the universe in which we
are, for without knowledge there is no power; truth and utility are in
ultimate aspect the same; “works themselves are of greater value as
pledges of truth than as contributing to the comforts of life.” Such was
the conception of philosophy with which Bacon started, and in which he
felt himself to be thoroughly original. As his object was new and
hitherto unproposed, so the method he intended to employ was different
from all modes of investigation hitherto attempted. “It would be,” as he
says, “an unsound fancy and self-contradictory, to expect that things
which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have
never yet been tried.” There were many obstacles in his way, and he
seems always to have felt that the first part of the new scheme must be
a pars destruens, a destructive criticism of all other methods.
Opposition was to be expected, not only from previous philosophies, but
especially from the human mind itself. In the first place, natural
antagonism might be looked for from the two opposed sects, the one of
whom, in despair of knowledge, maintained that all science was
impossible; while the other, resting on authority and on the learning
that had been handed down from the Greeks, declared that science was
already completely known, and consequently devoted their energies to
methodizing and elaborating it. Secondly, within the domain of science
itself, properly so called, there were two “kind of rovers” who must be
dismissed. The first were the speculative or logical philosophers, who
construe the universe ex analogia hominis, and not ex analogia mundi,
who fashion nature according to preconceived ideas, and who employ in
their investigations syllogism and abstract reasoning. The second class,
who were equally offensive, consisted of those who practised blind
experience, which is mere groping in the dark (vaga experientia mera
palpatio est), who occasionally hit upon good works or inventions,
which, like Atalanta’s apples, distracted them from further steady and
gradual progress towards universal truth. In place of these straggling
efforts of the unassisted human mind, a graduated system of helps was to
be supplied, by the use of which the mind, when placed on the right
road, would proceed with unerring and mechanical certainty to the
invention of new arts and sciences.</p>
<p>Such were to be the peculiar functions of the new method, though it
has not definitely appeared what that method was, or to what objects it
could be applied. But, before proceeding to unfold his method, Bacon
found it necessary to enter in considerable detail upon the general
subject of the obstacles to progress, and devoted nearly the whole of
the first book of the Organum to the examination of them. This
discussion, though strictly speaking extraneous to the scheme, has
always been looked upon as a most important part of his philosophy, and
his name is perhaps as much associated with the doctrine of Idols
(Idola) as with the theory of induction or the classification of the
sciences.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the kinds of fallacies or general classes of errors
into which the human mind is prone to fall, appears in many of the works
written before the Novum Organum, and the treatment of them varies in
some respects. The classification in the Organum, however, not only has
the author’s sanction, but has received the stamp of historical
acceptation; and comparison of the earlier notices, though a point of
literary interest, has no important philosophic bearing. The Idola
(Nov. Org. i. 39) false notions of things, or erroneous ways of looking
at nature, are of four kinds: the first two innate, pertaining to the
very nature of the mind and not to be eradicated; the third creeping
insensibly into men’s minds, and hence in a sense innate and
inseparable; the fourth imposed from without. The first kind are the
Idola Tribus, idols of the tribe, fallacies incident to humanity or the
race in general. Of these, the most prominent are — the proneness to
suppose in nature greater order and regularity than there actually is;
the tendency to support a preconceived opinion by affirmative instances,
neglecting all negative or opposed cases; and the tendency to generalize
from few observations, or to give reality to mere abstractions, figments
of the mind. Manifold errors also result from the weakness of the
senses, which affords scope for mere conjecture; from the influence
exercised over the understanding by the will and passions; from the
restless desire of the mind to penetrate to the ultimate principles of
things; and from the belief that “man is the measure of the universe,”
whereas, in truth, the world is received by us in a distorted and
erroneous manner. The second kind are the Idola Specus, idols of the
cave, or errors incident to the peculiar mental or bodily constitution
of each individual, for according to the state of the individual’s mind
is his view of things. Errors of this class are innumerable, because
there are numberless varieties of disposition; but some very prominent
specimens can be indicated. Such are the tendency to make all things
subservient to, or take the colour of some favourite subject, the
extreme fondness and reverence either for what is ancient or for what is
modern, and excess in noting either differences or resemblances amongst
things. A practical rule for avoiding these is also given: “In general
let every student of nature take this as a rule, that whatever his mind
seizes and dwells upon with particular satisfaction is to be held in
suspicion”. The third class are the Idola Fori, idols of the
market-place, errors arising from the influence exercised over the mind
by mere words. This, according to Bacon, is the most troublesome kind of
error, and has been especially fatal in philosophy. For words introduce
a fallacious mode of looking at things in two ways: first, there are
some words that are really merely names for non-existent things, which
are yet supposed to exist simply because they have received a name;
secondly, there are names hastily and unskilfully abstracted from a few
objects and applied recklessly to all that has the faintest analogy with
these objects, thus causing the grossest confusion. The fourth and last
class are the Idola Theatri, idols of the theatre, i.e. fallacious modes
of thinking resulting from received systems of philosophy and from
erroneous methods of demonstration. The criticism of the demonstrations
is introduced later in close connexion with Bacon’s new method; they are
the rival modes of procedure, to which his own is definitely opposed.
The philosophies which are “redargued” are divided into three classes,
the sophistical, of which the best example is Aristotle, who, according
to Bacon, forces nature into his abstract schemata and thinks to explain
by definitions; the empirical, which from few and limited experiments
leaps at once to general conclusions; and the superstitious, which
corrupts philosophy by the introduction of poetical and theological
notions.</p>
<p>Such are the general causes of the errors that infest the human mind;
by their exposure the way is cleared for the introduction of the new
method. The nature of this method cannot be understood until it is
exactly seen to what it is to be applied. What idea had Bacon of
science, and how is his method connected with it? Now, the science which
was specially and invariably contemplated by him was natural philosophy,
the great mother of all the sciences; it was to him the type of
scientific knowledge, and its method was the method of all true science.
To discover exactly the characteristics and the object of natural
philosophy it is necessary to examine the place it holds in the general
scheme furnished in the Advancement or De Augmentis. All human
knowledge, it is there laid down, may be referred to man’s memory or
imagination or reason. In the first, the bare facts presented to sense
are collected and stored up; the exposition of them is history, which is
either natural or civil. In the second, the materials of sense are
separated or divided in ways not corresponding to nature but after the
mind’s own pleasure, and the result is poesy or feigned history. In the
third, the materials are worked up after the model or pattern of nature,
though we are prone to err in the progress from sense to reason; the
result is philosophy, which is concerned either with God, with nature or
with man, the second being the most important. Natural philosophy is
again divided into speculative or theoretical and operative or
practical, according as the end is contemplation or works. Speculative
or theoretical natural philosophy has to deal with natural substances
and qualities and is subdivided into physics and metaphysics. Physics
inquires into the efficient and material causes of things; metaphysics,
into the formal and final causes. The principal objects of physics are
concrete substances, or abstract though physical qualities. The research
into abstract qualities, the fundamental problem of physics, comes near
to the metaphysical study of forms, which indeed differs from the first
only in being more general, and in having as its results a form strictly
so called, i.e. a nature or quality which is a limitation or specific
manifestation of some higher and better-known genus. Natural philosophy
is, therefore, in ultimate resort the study of forms, and, consequently,
the fundamental problem of philosophy in general is the discovery of
these forms.</p>
<p>“On a given body to generate or superinduce a new nature or natures,
is the work and aim of human power…. Of a given nature to discover the
form or true specific difference, or nature-engendering nature (natura
naturans) or source of emanation (for these are the terms which are
nearest to a description of the thing), is the work and aim of human
knowledge.”</p>
<p>The questions, then, whose answers give the key to the whole Baconian
philosophy, may be put briefly thus — What are forms? and how is it that
knowledge of them solves both the theoretical and the practical problem
of science? Bacon himself, as may be seen from the passage quoted above,
finds great difficulty in giving an adequate and exact definition of
what he means by a form. As a general description, the following passage
from the Novum Organum, ii. 4, may be cited: —</p>
<p>“The form of a nature is such that given the form the nature
infallibly follows…. Again, the form is such that if it be taken away
the nature infallibly vanishes…. Lastly, the true form is such that it
deduces the given nature from some source of being which is inherent in
more natures, and which is better known in the natural order of things
than the form itself.”</p>
<p>From this it would appear that, since by a nature is meant some
sensible quality, superinduced upon, or possessed by, a body, so by a
form we are to understand the cause of that nature, which cause is
itself a determinate case or manifestation of some general or abstract
quality inherent in a greater number of objects. But all these are
mostly marks by which a form may be recognized, and do not explain what
the form really is. A further definition is accordingly attempted in
Aph. 13: —</p>
<p>“The form of a thing is the very thing itself, and the thing differs
from the form no otherwise than as the apparent differs from the real,
or the external from the internal, or the thing in reference to the man
from the thing in reference to the universe.”</p>
<p>This throws a new light on the question, and from it the inference at
once follows, that the forms are the permanent causes or substances
underlying all visible phenomena, which are merely manifestations of
their activity. Are the forms, then, forces? At times it seems as if
Bacon had approximated to this view of the nature of things, for in
several passages he identifies forms with laws of activity. Thus, he
says —</p>
<p>“When I speak of forms I mean nothing more than those laws and
determinations of absolute actuality which govern and constitute any
simple nature, as heat, light, weight, in every kind of matter and
subject that is susceptible of them. Thus the form of heat or the form
of light is the same thing as the law of heat or the law of light.”
“Matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention, its
configurations and changes of configuration, and simple action, and law
of action or motion; for forms are figments of the human mind, unless
you will call those laws of action forms.” “Forms or true differences of
things, which are in fact laws of pure act.” “For though in nature
nothing really exists besides individual bodies, performing pure
individual acts according to a fixed law, yet in philosophy this very
law, and the investigation, discovery and explanation of it, is the
foundation as well of knowledge as of operation. And it is this law,
with its clauses, that I mean when I speak of forms.”</p>
<p>Several important conclusions may be drawn from these passages. In
the first place, it is evident that Bacon, like the Atomical school, of
whom he highly approved, had a clear perception and a firm grasp of the
physical character of natural principles; his forms are no ideas or
abstractions, but highly general physical properties. Further, it is
hinted that these general qualities may be looked upon as the modes of
action of simple bodies. This fruitful conception, however, Bacon does
not work out; and though he uses the word cause, and identifies form
with formal cause, yet it is perfectly apparent that the modern notions
of cause as dynamical, and of nature as in a process of flow or
development, are foreign to him, and that in his view of the ultimate
problem of science, cause meant causa immanens, or underlying substance,
effects were not consequents but manifestations, and nature was regarded
in a purely statical aspect. That this is so appears even more clearly
when we examine his general conception of the unity, gradation and
function of the sciences. That the sciences are organically connected is
a thought common to him and to his distinguished predecessor Roger
Bacon. “I that hold it for a great impediment towards the advancement
and further invention of knowledge, that particular arts and sciences
have been disincorporated from general knowledge, do not understand one
and the same thing which Cicero’s discourse and the note and conceit of
the Grecians in their word circle learning do intend. For I mean not
that use which one science hath of another for ornament or help in
practice; but I mean it directly of that use by way of supply of light
and information, which the particulars and instances of one science do
yield and present for the framing or correcting of the axioms of another
science in their very truth and notion.” In accordance with this, Bacon
placed at the basis of the particular sciences which treat of God,
nature and man, one fundamental doctrine, the Prima Philosophia, or
first philosophy, the function of which was to display the unity of
nature by connecting into one body of truth such of the highest axioms
of the subordinate sciences as were not special to one science, but
common to several. This first philosophy had also to investigate what
are called the adventitious or transcendental conditions of essences,
such as Much, Little, Like, Unlike, Possible, Impossible, Being,
Nothing, the logical discussion of which certainly belonged rather to
the laws of reasoning than to the existence of things, but the physical
or real treatment of which might be expected to yield answers to such
questions as, why certain substances are numerous, others scarce; or
why, if like attracts like, iron does not attract iron. Following this
summary philosophy come the sciences proper, rising like a pyramid in
successive stages, the lowest floor being occupied by natural history or
experience, the second by physics, the third, which is next the peak of
unity, by metaphysics. The knowledge of the peak, or of the one law
which binds nature together, is perhaps denied to man. Of the sciences,
physics, as has been already seen, deals with the efficient and
material, i.e. with the variable and transient, causes of things. But
its inquiries may be directed either towards concrete bodies or towards
abstract qualities. The first kind of investigation rises little above
mere natural history; but the other is more important and paves the way
for metaphysics. It handles the configurations and the appetites or
motions of matter. The configurations, or inner structure of bodies,
include dense, rare, heavy, light, hot, cold, andandandandc., — in fact,
what are elsewhere called simple natures. Motions are either simple or
compound, the latter being the sum of a number of the former. In
physics, however, these matters are treated only as regards their
material or efficient causes, and the result of inquiry into any one
case gives no general rule, but only facilitates invention in some
similar instance. Metaphysics, on the other hand, treats of the formal
or final cause of these same substances and qualities, and results in a
general rule. With regard to forms, the investigation may be directed
either towards concrete bodies or towards qualities. But the forms of
substances “are so perplexed and complicated, that it is either vain to
inquire into them at all, or such inquiry as is possible should be put
off for a time, and not entered upon till forms of a more simple nature
have been rightly investigated and discussed.” “To inquire into the form
of a lion, of an oak, or gold, nay, even of water or air, is a vain
pursuit; but to inquire the form of dense, rare, hot, cold,
andandandandc., as well configurations as motions, which in treating of
physic I have in great part enumerated (I call them forms of the first
class), and which (like the letters of the alphabet) are not many, and
yet make up and sustain the essences and forms of all substances — this,
I say, it is which I am attempting, and which constitutes and defines
that part of metaphysic of which we are now inquiring.” Physics inquires
into the same qualities, but does not push its investigations into
ultimate reality or reach the more general causes. We thus at last
attain a definite conclusion with regard to forms, and it appears clear
that in Bacon’s belief the true function of science was the search for a
few fundamental physical qualities, highly abstract and general, the
combinations of which give rise to the simple natures and complex
phenomena around us. His general conception of the universe may
therefore be called mechanical or statical; the cause of each phenomenon
is supposed to be actually contained in the phenomenon itself, and by a
sufficiently accurate process could be sifted out and brought to light.
As soon as the causes are known man regains his power over nature, for
“whosoever knows any form, knows also the utmost possibility of
superinducing that nature upon every variety of matter, and so is less
restrained and tied in operation either to the basis of the matter or to
the condition of the efficients.”</p>
<p>Nature thus presented itself to Bacon’s mind as a huge congeries of
phenomena, the manifestations of some simple and primitive qualities,
which were hid from us by the complexity of the things themselves. The
world was a vast labyrinth, amid the windings of which we require some
clue or thread whereby we may track our way to knowledge and thence to
power. This thread, the filum labyrinthi, is the new method of
induction. But, as has been frequently pointed out, the new method could
not be applied until facts had been observed and collected. This is an
indispensable preliminary. “Man, the servant and interpreter of nature,
can do and understand so much, and so much only, as he has observed in
fact or in thought of the course of nature; beyond this he neither knows
anything nor can do anything.” The proposition that our knowledge of
nature necessarily begins with observation and experience, is common to
Bacon and many contemporary reformers of science, but he laid peculiar
stress upon it, and gave it a new meaning. What he really meant by
observation was a competent natural history or collection of facts. “The
firm foundations of a purer natural philosophy are laid in natural
history.” “First of all we must prepare a natural and experimental
history, sufficient and good; and this is the foundation of all.” The
senses and the memory, which collect and store up facts, must be
assisted; there must be a ministration of the senses and another of the
memory. For not only are instances required, but these must be arranged
in such a manner as not to distract or confuse the mind, i.e. tables and
arrangements of instances must be constructed. In the preliminary
collection the greatest care must be taken that the mind be absolutely
free from preconceived ideas; nature is only to be conquered by
obedience; man must be merely receptive. “All depends on keeping the eye
steadily fixed upon the facts of nature, and so receiving their images
simply as they are; for God forbid that we should give out a dream of
our own imagination for a pattern of the world; rather may He graciously
grant to us to write an apocalypse or true vision of the footsteps of
the Creator imprinted on his creatures.” Concealed among the facts
presented to sense are the causes or forms, and the problem therefore is
so to analyse experience, so to break it up into pieces, that we shall
with certainty and mechanical ease arrive at a true conclusion. This
process, which forms the essence of the new method, may in its entirety,
as a ministration to the reason, be called a logic; but it differs
widely from the ordinary or school logic in end, method and form. Its
aim is to acquire command over nature by knowledge, and to invent new
arts, whereas the old logic strove only after dialectic victories and
the discovery of new arguments. In method the difference is even more
fundamental. Hitherto the mode of demonstration had been by the
syllogism; but the syllogism is, in many respects, an incompetent
weapon. It is compelled to accept its first principles on trust from the
science in which it is employed; it cannot cope with the subtlety of
nature; and it is radically vitiated by being founded on hastily and
inaccurately abstracted notions of things. For a syllogism consists of
propositions, propositions of words, and words are the symbols of
notions. Now the first step in accurate progress from sense to reason,
or true philosophy, is to frame a bona notio or accurate conception of
the thing; but the received logic never does this. It flies off at once
from experience and particulars to the highest and most general
propositions, and from these descends, by the use of middle terms, to
axioms of lower generality. Such a mode of procedure may be called
anticipatio naturae (for in it reason is allowed to prescribe to
things), and is opposed to the true method, the interpretatio naturae,
in which reason follows and obeys nature, discovering her secrets by
obedience and submission to rule. Lastly, the very form of induction
that has been used by logicians in the collection of their instances is
a weak and useless thing. It is a mere enumeration of a few known facts,
makes no use of exclusions or rejections, concludes precariously, and is
always liable to be overthrown by a negative instance. In radical
opposition to this method the Baconian induction begins by supplying
helps and guides to the senses, whose unassisted information could not
be relied on. Notions were formed carefully, and not till after a
certain process of induction was completed. The formation of axioms was
to be carried on by a gradually ascending scale. “Then and only then may
we hope well of the sciences, when in a just scale of ascent and by
successive steps, not interrupted or broken, we rise from particulars to
lesser axioms; and then to middle axioms, one above the other; and last
of all to the most general.” Finally the very form of induction itself
must be new. “The induction which is to be available for the discovery
and demonstration of sciences and arts must analyse nature by proper
rejections and exclusions; and then, after a sufficient number of
negatives, come to a conclusion on the affirmative instances, which has
not yet been done, or even attempted, save only by Plato. … And this
induction must be used not only to discover axioms, but also in the
formation of notions.” This view of the function of exclusion is closely
connected with Bacon’s doctrine of forms, and is in fact dependent upon
that theory. But induction is neither the whole of the new method, nor
is it applicable to forms only. There are two other grand objects of
inquiry: the one, the transformation of concrete bodies; the other, the
investigation of the latent powers and the latent schematism or
configuration. With regard to the first, in ultimate result it depends
upon the theory of forms; for whenever the compound body can be regarded
as the sum of certain simple natures, then our knowledge of the forms of
these natures gives us the power of superinducing a new nature on the
concrete body. As regards the latent process (latens processus) which
goes on in all cases of generation and continuous development or motion,
we examine carefully, and by quantitative measurements, the gradual
growth and change from the first elements to the completed thing. The
same kind of investigation may be extended to many cases of natural
motion, such as voluntary action or nutrition; and though inquiry is
here directed towards concrete bodies, and does not therefore penetrate
so deeply into reality as in research for forms, yet great results may
be looked for with more confidence. It is to be regretted that Bacon did
not complete this portion of his work, in which for the first time he
approaches modern conceptions of change. The latent configuration
(latens schematismus) or inward structure of the parts of a body must be
known before we can hope to superinduce a new nature upon it. This can
only be discovered by analysis, which will disclose the ultimate
constituents (natural particles, not atoms) of bodies, and lead back the
discussion to forms or simple natures, whereby alone can true light be
thrown on these obscure questions. Thus, in all cases, scientific
explanation depends upon knowledge of forms; all phenomena or secondary
qualities are accounted for by being referred to the primary qualities
of matter.</p>
<p>The several steps in the inductive investigation of the form of any
nature flow readily from the definition of the form itself. For that is
always and necessarily present when the nature is present, absent when
it is absent, decreases and increases according as the nature decreases
and increases. It is therefore requisite for the inquiry to have before
us instances in which the nature is present. The list of these is called
the table of Essence and Presence. Secondly, we must have instances in
which the nature is absent; only as such cases might be infinite,
attention should be limited to such of them as are most akin to the
instances of presence. The list in this case is called table of Absence
in Proximity. Thirdly, we must have a number of instances in which the
nature is present in different degrees, either increasing or decreasing
in the same subject, or variously present in different subjects. This is
the table of Degrees, or Comparison. After the formation of these
tables, we proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of
the Baconian method, and that in which the author took most pride, the
process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the
non-essential, grounded on the fundamental propositions with regard to
forms, is the most important of Bacon’s contributions to the logic of
induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs
from all previous philosophies. It is evident that if the tables were
complete, and our notions of the respective phenomena clear, the process
of exclusion would be a merely mechanical counting out, and would
infallibly lead to the detection of the cause or form. But it is just as
evident that these conditions can never be adequately fulfilled. Bacon
saw that his method was impracticable (though he seems to have thought
the difficulties not insuperable), and therefore set to work to devise
new helps, adminicula. These he enumerates in ii., Aph. 21: —
Prerogative Instances, Supports of Induction, Rectification of
Induction, Varying the Investigation according to the Nature of the
Subject, Prerogative Natures, Limits of Investigation, Application to
Practice, Preparations for Investigation, the Ascending and Descending
Scale of Axioms. The remainder of the Organum is devoted to a
consideration of the twenty-seven classes of Prerogative Instances, and
though it contains much that is both luminous and helpful, it adds
little to our knowledge of what constitutes the Baconian method. On the
other heads we have but a few scattered hints. But although the rigorous
requirements of science could only be fulfilled by the employment of all
these means, yet in their absence it was permissible to draw from the
tables and the exclusion a hypothetical conclusion, the truth of which
might be verified by the use of the other processes; such an hypothesis
is called fantastically the First Vintage (Vindemiatio). The inductive
method, so far as exhibited in the Organum, is exemplified by an
investigation into the nature of heat.</p>
<p>Such was the method devised by Bacon, and to which he ascribed the
qualities of absolute certainty and mechanical simplicity. But even
supposing that this method were accurate and completely unfolded, it is
evident that it could only be made applicable and produce fruit when the
phenomena of the universe have been very completely tabulated and
arranged. In this demand for a complete natural history, Bacon also felt
that he was original, and he was deeply impressed with the necessity for
it; in fact, he seems occasionally to place an even higher value upon it
than upon his Organum. Thus, in the preface to his series of works
forming the third part of the Instauratio, he says: “It comes,
therefore, to this, that my Organum, even if it were completed, would
not without the Natural History much advance the Instauration of the
Sciences, whereas the Natural History without the Organum would advance
it not a little.” But a complete natural history is evidently a thing
impossible, and in fact a history can only be collected by attending to
the requirements of the Organum. This was seen by Bacon, and what may be
regarded as his final opinion on the question is given in the important
letter to Jean Antoine Baranzano (“Redemptus”: 1590-1622):— “With regard
to the multitude of instances by which men may be deterred from the
attempt, here is my answer. First, what need to dissemble? Either store
of instances must be procured, or the business must be given up. All
other ways, however enticing, are impassable. Secondly, the prerogatives
of instances, and the mode of experimenting upon experiments of light
(which I shall hereafter explain), will diminish the multitude of them
very much. Thirdly, what matter, I ask, if the description of the
instances should fill six times as many volumes as Pliny’s History? …
For the true natural history is to take nothing except instances,
connections, observations and canons”. The Organum and the History are
thus correlative, and form the two equally necessary sides of a true
philosophy; by their union the new philosophy is produced.</p>
<p>Summary. — Two questions may be put to any doctrine which professes
to effect a radical change in philosophy or science. Is it original? Is
it valuable? With regard to the first, it has been already pointed out
that Bacon’s induction or inductive method is distinctly his own, though
it cannot and need not be maintained that the general spirit of his
philosophy was entirely new.</p>
<p>The value of the method is the separate and more difficult question.
It has been assailed on the most opposite grounds. Macaulay, while
admitting the accuracy of the process, denied its efficiency, on the
ground that an operation performed naturally was not rendered more easy
or efficacious by being subjected to analysis. This objection is curious
when confronted with Bacon’s reiterated assertion that the natural
method pursued by the unassisted human reason is distinctly opposed to
his; and it is besides an argument that tells so strongly against many
sciences, as to be comparatively worthless when applied to any one.
There are, however, more formidable objections against the method. It
has been pointed out, and with perfect justice, that science in its
progress has not followed the Baconian method, that no one discovery can
be pointed to which can be definitely ascribed to the use of his rules,
and that men the most celebrated for their scientific acquirements,
while paying homage to the name of Bacon, practically set at naught his
most cherished precepts. The reason of this is not far to seek, and has
been pointed out by logicians of the most diametrically opposed schools.
The mechanical character both of the natural history and of the logical
method applied to it resulted necessarily from Bacon’s radically false
conception of the nature of cause and of the causal relation. The whole
logical or scientific problem is treated as if it were one of
co-existence, to which in truth the method of exclusion is scarcely
applicable, and the assumption is constantly made that each phenomenon
has one and only one cause. The inductive formation of axioms by a
gradually ascending scale is a route which no science has ever followed,
and by which no science could ever make progress. The true scientific
procedure is by hypothesis followed up and tested by verification; the
most powerful instrument is the deductive method, which Bacon can hardly
be said to have recognized. The power of framing hypothesis points to
another want in the Baconian doctrine. If that power form part of the
true method, then the mind is not wholly passive or recipient; it
anticipates nature, and moulds the experience received by it in
accordance with its own constructive ideas or conceptions; and yet
further, the minds of various investigators can never be reduced to the
same dead mechanical level. There will still be room for the scientific
use of the imagination and for the creative flashes of genius.</p>
<p>If, then, Bacon himself made no contributions to science, if no
discovery can be shown to be due to the use of his rules, if his method
be logically defective, and the problem to which it was applied one from
its nature incapable of adequate solution, it may not unreasonably be
asked, How has he come to be looked upon as the great leader in the
reformation of modern science? How is it that he shares with Descartes
the honour of inaugurating modern philosophy? To this the true answer
seems to be that Bacon owes his position not only to the general spirit
of his philosophy, but to the manner in which he worked into a connected
system the new mode of thinking, and to the incomparable power and
eloquence with which he expounded and enforced it. Like all epoch-making
works, the Novum Organum gave expression to ideas which were already
beginning to be in the air. The time was ripe for a great change;
scholasticism, long decaying, had begun to fall; the authority not only
of school doctrines but of the church had been discarded; while here and
there a few devoted experimenters were turning with fresh zeal to the
unwithered face of nature. The fruitful thoughts which lay under and
gave rise to these scattered efforts of the human mind, were gathered up
into unity, and reduced to system in the new philosophy of Bacon. It is
assuredly little matter for wonder that this philosophy should contain
much that is now inapplicable, and that in many respects it should be
vitiated by radical errors. The details of the logical method on which
its author laid the greatest stress have not been found of practical
service; yet the fundamental ideas on which the theory rested, the need
for rejecting rash generalization, and the necessity for a critical
analysis of experience, are as true and valuable now as they were then.
Progress in scientific discovery is made mainly, if not solely, by the
employment of hypothesis, and for that no code of rules can be laid down
such as Bacon had devised. Yet the framing of hypothesis is no mere
random guesswork; it is left not to the imagination alone, but to the
scientific imagination. There is required in the process not merely a
preliminary critical induction, but a subsequent experimental
comparison, verification or proof, the canons of which can be laid down
with precision. To formulate and show grounds for these laws is to
construct a philosophy of induction, and it must not be forgotten that
the first step towards the accomplishment of the task was made by Bacon
when he introduced and gave prominence to the powerful logical
instrument of exclusion or elimination.</p>
<p>It is curious and significant that in the domain of the moral and
metaphysical sciences his influence has been perhaps more powerful, and
his authority has been more frequently appealed to, than in that of the
physical. This is due, not so much to his expressed opinion that the
inductive method was applicable to all the sciences, as to the generally
practical, or, one may say, positive spirit of his system. Theological
questions, which had tortured the minds of generations, are by him
relegated from the province of reason to that of faith. Even reason must
be restrained from striving after ultimate truth; it is one of the
errors of the human intellect that it will not rest in general
principles, but must push its investigations deeper. Experience and
observation are the only remedies against prejudice and error. Into
questions of metaphysics, as commonly understood, Bacon can hardly be
said to have entered, but a long line of thinkers have drawn inspiration
from him, and it is not without justice that he has been looked upon as
the originator and guiding spirit of what is known as the empirical
school.</p>
<p>Bacon’s Influence. — It is impossible within our limits to do more
than indicate the influence which Bacon’s views have had on subsequent
thinkers. The most valuable and complete discussion of the subject is
contained in T. Fowler’s edition of the Novum Organum (introd. § 14). It
is there argued that, both in philosophy and in natural science, Bacon’s
influence was immediate and lasting. Under the former head it is pointed
out (i.) that the fundamental principle of Locke’s Essay, that all our
ideas are product of sensation and reflection, is briefly stated in the
first aphorism of the Novum Organum, and (ii.) that the whole atmosphere
of that treatise is characteristic of the Essay. Bacon is, therefore,
regarded by many as the father of what is most characteristic in English
psychological speculation. As he himself said, he “rang the bell which
called the wits together.” In the sphere of ethics he is similarly
regarded as a forerunner of the empirical method. The spirit of the De
Augmentis (bk. vii.) and the inductive method which is discussed in the
Novum Organum are at the root of all theories which have constructed a
moral code by an inductive examination of human consciousness and the
results of actions. Among such theories utilitarianism especially is the
natural result of the application to the phenomenon of conduct of the
Baconian experimental method. In this connexion, however, it is
important to notice that Hobbes, who had been Bacon’s secretary, makes
no mention of Baconian induction, nor does he in any of his works make
any critical reference to Bacon himself. It would, therefore, appear
that Bacon’s influence was not immediate.</p>
<p>In the sphere of natural science, Bacon’s importance is attested by
references to his work in the writings of the principal scientists, not
only English, but French, German and Italian. Fowler (op. cit.) has
collected from Descartes, Gassendi, S. Sorbière, Jean Baptiste du Hamel,
quotations which show how highly Bacon was regarded by the leaders of
the new scientific movement. Sorbière, who was by no means partial to
things English, definitely speaks of him as “celuy qui a le plus
puissamment solicité les interests de la physique, et excité le monde à
faire des expériences” (Relation d’un voyage en Angleterre, Cologne,
1666, p-64). It was, however, Voltaire and the encyclopaedists who
raised Bacon to the pinnacle of his fame in France, and hailed him as
“le père de la philosophie expérimentale” (Lettres sur les Anglois).
Condillac, in the same spirit, says of him, “personne n’a mieux connu
que lui la cause de nos erreurs.” So the Encyclopédie, besides giving a
eulogistic article “Baconisme,” speaks of him (in d’Alembert’s
preliminary discourse) as “le plus grand, le plus universel, et le plus
éloquent des philosophes.” Among other writers, Leibnitz and Huygens
give testimony which is the more valuable as being critical. Leibnitz
speaks of Bacon as “divini ingenii vir,” and, like several other German
authors, classes him with Campanella; Huygens refers to his “bonnes
méthodes.” If, however, we are to attach weight to English writers of
the latter half of the 17th century, we shall find that one of Bacon’s
greatest achievements was the impetus given by his New Atlantis to the
foundation of the Royal Society (q.v.). Dr Thomas Sprat (1635-1713),
bishop of Rochester and first historian of the society, says that Bacon
of all others “had the true imagination of the whole extent” of the
enterprise, and that in his works are to be found the best arguments for
the experimental method of natural philosophy (Hist. of the Royal
Society, p-36, and Thomas Tenison’s Baconiana, p-266). In this connexion
reference should be made also to Cowley’s Ode to the Royal Society, and
to Dr John Wallis’s remarks in Hearne’s Preface to P. Langtoft’s
Chronicle (appendix, num. xi.). Joseph Glanvill, in his Scepsis
Scientifica (dedication) says, “Solomon’s house in the New Atlantis was
a prophetic scheme of the Royal Society”; and Henry Oldenburg
(c. 1615-1677), one of the first secretaries of the society, speaks of
the new eagerness to obtain scientific data as “a work begun by the
single care and conduct of the excellent Lord Verulam.” Boyle, in whose
works there are frequent eulogistic references to Bacon, regarded
himself as a disciple and was indeed known as a second Bacon. The
predominating influence of Bacon’s philosophy is thus clearly
established in the generation which succeeded his own. There is abundant
evidence to show that in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
(especially the latter) the new spirit had already modified the old
curricula. Bacon has frequently been disparaged on the ground that his
name is not mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton. It can be shown, however,
that Newton was not ignorant of Bacon’s works, and Dr Fowler explains
his silence with regard to them on three grounds: (1) that Bacon’s
reputation was so well established that any definite mention was
unnecessary, (2) that it was not customary at the time to acknowledge
indebtedness to contemporary and recent writers, and (3) that Newton’s
genius was so strongly mathematical (whereas Bacon’s great weakness was
in mathematics) that he had no special reason to refer to Bacon’s
experimental principles.</p>
<p>If the foregoing examples are held sufficient to establish the
influence of Bacon on the intellectual development of his immediate
successors, it follows that the whole trend of typically English
thought, not only in natural science, but also in mental, moral and
political philosophy, is the logical fulfilment of Baconian principles.
He argued against the tyranny of authority, the vagaries of unfettered
imagination and the academic aims of unpractical dialectic; the vital
energy and the reasoned optimism of his language entirely outweigh the
fact that his contributions to the stock of actual scientific knowledge
were practically inconsiderable. It may be freely admitted that in the
domain of logic there is nothing in the Organum that has not been more
instructively analysed either by Aristotle himself or in modern works;
at the same time, there is probably no work which is a better and more
stimulating introduction to logical study. Its terse, epigrammatic
phrases sink into the fibre of the mind, and are a healthy warning
against crude, immature generalization.</p>
<p>While, therefore, it is a profound mistake to regard Bacon as a great
constructive philosopher, or even as a lonely pioneer of modern thought,
it is quite unfair to speak of him as a trifler. His great work consists
in the fact that he summed up the faults which the widening of knowledge
had disclosed in medieval thought, and in this sense he stands high
among those who were in many parts of 16th-century Europe striving
towards a new intellectual activity.</p>
