4 — Of the Impediments of Knowledge, Being the 4th Chapter, the Preface
Only of it</h4>
<p>In some things it is more hard to attempt than to achieve, which
falleth out when the difficulty is not so much in the matter or subject,
as it is in the crossness and indisposition of the mind of man to think
of any such thing, to will or to resolve it. And therefore Titus Livius
in his declamatory digression wherein he doth depress and extenuate the
honour of Alexander’s conquests saith, NIHIL ALIUD QUAM BENE AUSUS VANA
CONTEMNERE: in which sort of things it is the manner of men first to
wonder that any such thing should be possible, and after it is found out
to wonder again how the world should miss it so long. Of this nature I
take to be the invention and discovery of knowledge, etc.</p>
<p>THE IMPEDIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN IN THE TIMES, AND IN DIVERSION OF
WITS, BEING THE 5TH CHAPTER, A SMALL FRAGMENT IN THE BEGINNING OF THAT
CHAPTER.</p>
<p>The encounters of the times have been nothing favourable and
prosperous for the invention of knowledge; so as it is not only the
daintiness of the seed to take, and the ill mixture and unliking of the
ground to nourish or raise this plant, but the ill season also of the
weather by which it hath been checked and blasted. Especially in that
the seasons have been proper to bring up and set forward other more
hasty and indifferent plants, whereby this of knowledge bath been
starved and overgrown; for in the descent of times always there hath
been somewhat else in reign and reputation, which hath generally aliened
and diverted wits and labours from that employment.</p>
<p>For as for the uttermost antiquity which is like fame that muffles
her head and tells tales, I cannot presume much of it; for I would not
willingly imitate the manner of those that describe maps, which when
they come to some far countries whereof they have no knowledge, set down
how there be great wastes and deserts there: so I am not apt to affirm
that they knew little, because what they knew is little known to us. But
if you will judge of them by the last traces that remain to us, you will
conclude, though not so scornfully as Aristotle doth, that saith our
ancestors were extreme gross, as those that came newly from being
moulded out of the clay or some earthly substance; yet reasonably and
probably thus, that it was with them in matter of knowledge but as the
dawning or break of day. For at that time the world was altogether
home-bred, every nation looked little beyond their own confines or
territories, and the world had no through lights then, as it hath had
since by commerce and navigation, whereby there could neither be that
contribution of wits one to help another, nor that variety of
particulars for the correcting of customary conceits.</p>
<p>And as there could be no great collection of wits of several parts or
nations, so neither could there be any succession of wits of several
times, whereby one might refine the other, in regard they had not
history to any purpose. And the manner of their traditions was utterly
unfit and unproper for amplification of knowledge. And again the studies
of those times, you shall find, besides wars, incursions, and rapines,
which were then almost every where betwixt states adjoining (the use of
leagues and confederacies being not then known), were to populate by
multitude of wives and generation, a thing at this day in the waster
part of the West–Indies principally affected; and to build sometimes for
habitation towns and cities, sometimes for fame and memory monuments,
pyramids, colosses, and the like. And if there happened to rise up any
more civil wits; then would he found and erect some new laws, customs,
and usages, such as now of late years, when the world was revolute
almost to the like rudeness and obscurity, we see both in our own nation
and abroad many examples of, as well in a number of tenures reserved
upon men’s lands, as in divers customs of towns and manors, being the
devices that such wits wrought upon in such times of deep ignorance,
etc.</p>
<p>THE IMPEDIMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE FOR WANT OF A TRUE SUCCESSION OF WITS,
AND THAT HITHERTO THE LENGTH OF ONE MAN’S LIFE HATH BEEN THE GREATEST
MEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE, BEING THE 6TH CHAPTER, THE WHOLE CHAPTER.</p>
<p>In arts mechanical the first device comes shortest and time addeth
and perfecteth. But in sciences of conceit the first author goeth
furthest and time leeseth and corrupteth. Painting, artillery, sailing,
and the like, grossly managed at first, by time accommodate and refined.
The philosophies and sciences of Aristotle, Plato, Democritus,
Hippocrates, of most vigour at first, by time degenerated and imbased.
In the former many wits and industries contributed in one: In the latter
many men’s wits spent to deprave the wit of one.</p>
<p>The error is both in the deliverer and in the receiver. He that
delivereth knowledge desireth to deliver it in such form as may be
soonest believed, and not as may be easiliest examined. He that
receiveth knowledge desireth rather present satisfaction than expectant
search, and so rather not to doubt than not to err. Glory maketh the
author not to lay open his weakness, and sloth maketh the disciple not
to know his strength.</p>
<p>Then begin men to aspire to the second prizes; to be a profound
interpreter and commenter, to be a sharp champion and defender, to be a
methodical compounder and abridger. And this is the unfortunate
succession of wits which the world hath yet had, whereby the patrimony
of all knowledge goeth not on husbanded or improved, but wasted and
decayed. For knowledge is like a water that will never arise again
higher than the level from which it fell; and therefore to go beyond
Aristotle by the light of Aristotle is to think that a borrowed light
can increase the original light from whom it is taken. So then no true
succession of wits having been in the world, either we must conclude
that knowledge is but a task for one man’s life, and then vain was the
complaint that LIFE IS SHORT, AND ART IS LONG: or else, that the
knowledge that now is, is but a shrub, and not that tree which is never
dangerous, but where it is to the purpose of knowing Good and Evil;
which desire ever riseth upon an appetite to elect and not to obey, and
so containeth in it a manifest defection.</p>
