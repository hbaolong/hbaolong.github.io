<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first of these is the extreme affecting of two extremities:
the one antiquity, the other novelty; wherein it seemeth the children of
time do take after the nature and malice of the father. For as he
devoureth his children, so one of them seeketh to devour and suppress
the other; while antiquity envieth there should be new additions, and
novelty cannot be content to add but it must deface; surely the advice
of the prophet is the true direction in this matter, State super vias
antiquas, et videte quaenam sit via recta et bona et ambulate in ea.
Antiquity deserveth that reverence, that men should make a stand
thereupon and discover what is the best way; but when the discovery is
well taken, then to make progression. And to speak truly, Antiquitas
saeculi juventus mundi. These times are the ancient times, when the
world is ancient, and not those which we account ancient ordine
retrogrado, by a computation backward from ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error induced by the former is a distrust that anything
should be now to be found out, which the world should have missed and
passed over so long time: as if the same objection were to be made to
time that Lucian maketh to Jupiter and other the heathen gods; of which
he wondereth that they begot so many children in old time, and begot
none in his time; and asketh whether they were become septuagenary, or
whether the law Papia, made against old men’s marriages, had restrained
them. So it seemeth men doubt lest time is become past children and
generation; wherein contrariwise we see commonly the levity and
unconstancy of men’s judgments, which, till a matter be done, wonder
that it can be done; and as soon as it is done, wonder again that it was
no sooner done: as we see in the expedition of Alexander into Asia,
which at first was prejudged as a vast and impossible enterprise; and
yet afterwards it pleaseth Livy to make no more of it than this, Nil
aliud quam bene ausus vana contemnere. And the same happened to Columbus
in the western navigation. But in intellectual matters it is much more
common, as may be seen in most of the propositions of Euclid; which till
they be demonstrate, they seem strange to our assent; but being
demonstrate, our mind accepteth of them by a kind of relation (as the
lawyers speak), as if we had known them before.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error, that hath also some affinity with the former, is a
conceit that of former opinions or sects after variety and examination
the best hath still prevailed and suppressed the rest; so as if a man
should begin the labour of a new search, he were but like to light upon
somewhat formerly rejected, and by rejection brought into oblivion; as
if the multitude, or the wisest for the multitude’s sake, were not ready
to give passage rather to that which is popular and superficial than to
that which is substantial and profound for the truth is, that time
seemeth to be of the nature of a river or stream, which carrieth down to
us that which is light and blown up, and sinketh and drowneth that which
is weighty and solid.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error, of a diverse nature from all the former, is the
over-early and peremptory reduction of knowledge into arts and methods;
from which time commonly sciences receive small or no augmentation. But
as young men, when they knit and shape perfectly, do seldom grow to a
further stature, so knowledge, while it is in aphorisms and
observations, it is in growth; but when it once is comprehended in exact
methods, it may, perchance, be further polished, and illustrate and
accommodated for use and practice, but it increaseth no more in bulk and
substance.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error which doth succeed that which we last mentioned is,
that after the distribution of particular arts and sciences, men have
abandoned universality, or philosophia prima, which cannot but cease and
stop all progression. For no perfect discovery can be made upon a flat
or a level; neither is it possible to discover the more remote and
deeper parts of any science if you stand but upon the level of the same
science, and ascend not to a higher science.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error hath proceeded from too great a reverence, and a
kind of adoration of the mind and understanding of man; by means
whereof, men have withdrawn themselves too much from the contemplation
of nature, and the observations of experience, and have tumbled up and
down in their own reason and conceits. Upon these intellectualists,
which are notwithstanding commonly taken for the most sublime and divine
philosophers, Heraclitus gave a just censure, saying:—”Men sought truth
in their own little worlds, and not in the great and common world;” for
they disdain to spell, and so by degrees to read in the volume of God’s
works; and contrariwise by continual meditation and agitation of wit do
urge and, as it were, invocate their own spirits to divine and give
oracles unto them, whereby they are deservedly deluded.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error that hath some connection with this latter is, that
men have used to infect their meditations, opinions, and doctrines with
some conceits which they have most admired, or some sciences which they
have most applied, and given all things else a tincture according to
them, utterly untrue and improper. So hath Plato intermingled his
philosophy with theology, and Aristotle with logic; and the second
school of Plato, Proclus and the rest, with the mathematics; for these
were the arts which had a kind of primogeniture with them severally. So
have the alchemists made a philosophy out of a few experiments of the
furnace; and Gilbertus our countryman hath made a philosophy out of the
observations of a loadstone. So Cicero, when reciting the several
opinions of the nature of the soul, he found a musician that held the
soul was but a harmony, saith pleasantly, Hic ab arte sua non recessit,
andandandandc. But of these conceits Aristotle speaketh seriously and
wisely when he saith, Qui respiciunt ad pauca de facili
pronunciant.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error is an impatience of doubt, and haste to assertion
without due and mature suspension of judgment. For the two ways of
contemplation are not unlike the two ways of action commonly spoken of
by the ancients: the one plain and smooth in the beginning, and in the
end impassable; the other rough and troublesome in the entrance, but
after a while fair and even. So it is in contemplation: if a man will
begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be
content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.</p></li>
<li><p>Another error is in the manner of the tradition and delivery of
knowledge, which is for the most part magistral and peremptory, and not
ingenuous and faithful; in a sort as may be soonest believed, and not
easiest examined. It is true, that in compendious treatises for practice
that form is not to be disallowed; but in the true handling of knowledge
men ought not to fall either on the one side into the vein of Velleius
the Epicurean, Nil tam metuens quam ne dubitare aliqua de revideretur:
nor, on the other side, into Socrates, his ironical doubting of all
things; but to propound things sincerely with more or less asseveration,
as they stand in a man’s own judgment proved more or less.</p></li>
<li><p>Other errors there are in the scope that men propound to
themselves, whereunto they bend their endeavours; for, whereas the more
constant and devote kind of professors of any science ought to propound
to themselves to make some additions to their science, they convert
their labours to aspire to certain second prizes: as to be a profound
interpreter or commentor, to be a sharp champion or defender, to be a
methodical compounder or abridger, and so the patrimony of knowledge
cometh to be sometimes improved, but seldom augmented.</p></li>
<li><p>But the greatest error of all the rest is the mistaking or
misplacing of the last or furthest end of knowledge. For men have
entered into a desire of learning and knowledge, sometimes upon a
natural curiosity and inquisitive appetite; sometimes to entertain their
minds with variety and delight; sometimes for ornament and reputation;
and sometimes to enable them to victory of wit and contradiction; and
most times for lucre and profession; and seldom sincerely to give a true
account of their gift of reason to the benefit and use of men: as if
there were sought in knowledge a couch whereupon to rest a searching and
restless spirit; or a terrace for a wandering and variable mind to walk
up and down with a fair prospect; or a tower of state, for a proud mind
to raise itself upon; or a fort or commanding ground, for strife and
contention; or a shop, for profit or sale; and not a rich storehouse for
the glory of the Creator and the relief of man’s estate. But this is
that which will indeed dignify and exalt knowledge, if contemplation and
action may be more nearly and straitly conjoined and united together
than they have been: a conjunction like unto that of the two highest
planets, Saturn, the planet of rest and contemplation; and Jupiter, the
planet of civil society and action, howbeit, I do not mean, when I speak
of use and action, that end before-mentioned of the applying of
knowledge to lucre and profession; for I am not ignorant how much that
diverteth and interrupteth the prosecution and advancement of knowledge,
like unto the golden ball thrown before Atalanta, which, while she goeth
aside and stoopeth to take up, the race is hindered,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit.”</p>
<p>Neither is my meaning, as was spoken of Socrates, to call philosophy
down from heaven to converse upon the earth — that is, to leave natural
philosophy aside, and to apply knowledge only to manners and policy. But
as both heaven and earth do conspire and contribute to the use and
benefit of man, so the end ought to be, from both philosophies to
separate and reject vain speculations, and whatsoever is empty and void,
and to preserve and augment whatsoever is solid and fruitful; that
knowledge may not be as a courtesan, for pleasure and vanity only, or as
a bond-woman, to acquire and gain to her master’s use; but as a spouse,
for generation, fruit, and comfort.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Thus have I described and opened, as by a kind of dissection, those
peccant humours (the principal of them) which have not only given
impediment to the proficience of learning, but have given also occasion
to the traducement thereof: wherein, if I have been too plain, it must
be remembered, fidelia vulnera amantis, sed dolosa oscula malignantis.
This I think I have gained, that I ought to be the better believed in
that which I shall say pertaining to commendation; because I have
proceeded so freely in that which concerneth censure. And yet I have no
purpose to enter into a laudative of learning, or to make a hymn to the
Muses (though I am of opinion that it is long since their rites were
duly celebrated), but my intent is, without varnish or amplification
justly to weigh the dignity of knowledge in the balance with other
things, and to take the true value thereof by testimonies and arguments,
divine and human.</li>
