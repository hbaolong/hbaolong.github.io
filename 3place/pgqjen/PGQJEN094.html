<h4 id="dissents-of-visibles-and-audibles.">DISSENTS OF VISIBLES, and
Audibles.</h4>
<p>THe Species of Visibles soeme to be Emissions of Beames from the
Obiect seene; Almost like Odours; saue that they are more Incorporecall:
But the Species of Audibles seeme to Participate more with Locall
Motion, like Percussions or Impressions made vpon the Aire. So that
whereas all Bodies doe seeme to worke in two manners; Either by the
Communication of their Natures; Or by the Impressions and Signatures of
their Motions; The Diffusion of Species Visible seemeth to participate
more of the former Operation; and the Species Audible of the latter.</p>
<p>The Species of Audibles seeme to be carried more manifestly thorow
the Aire, than the Species of Visibles: For (I conceiue) that a Contrary
strong Wind will not much hinder the Sight of Visibles, as it will doe
the Hearing of Sounds.</p>
<p>There is one Difference, aboue all others, betweene Visibles and
Audibles, that is the most remarkable; As that wherupon many smaller
Differences doe depend: Namely, that Visibles, (except Lights,) are
carried in Right Lines; and Audibles in Ar — Lines. Heriee it commeth to
passe, that Visibles doe not intermingle; and confound one another, as
hath beene said before; But Sounds doe. Hence it commeth, that the
Solidity of Bodies doth not much hinder the Sight, so that the Bodies be
cleare. and the Pores in a Right Line as in Glasse, Crystall, Diamonds,
Water, andandandandc. But a thin Scarse, or Handkerchiefe, though they
be Bodies nothing so solide, hinder the Sight: Whereas (contrariwise)
these Porous Bodies doe not much hinder the Hearing, but solide Bodies
doe almost stop it, or at the least attenuate it. Hence also it commeth,
that to the Reflexion of Visibles, small Glasses suffice; but to the
Reuerberation of Audibles, are required greater Spaces, as hath likewise
beene said before.</p>
<p>Visibles are seene further off, than Sounds are heard; Allowing
neuerthelesse the Rate of their Bignesse; For otherwise a great Sound
will be heard further off, than a Small Body seene.</p>
<p>Visibles require (generally) some Distance betweene the Obiect, and
the Eye, to bee better seene; Whereas in Audibles, the nearer the
Approch of the Sound is to the Sense, the better. But in this there may
be a double Errour. The one, because to Seeing, there is required Light;
And any thing that toucheth the Pupill of the Eye (all ouer,) excludeth
the Light. For I haue heard of a Person very credible, (who himselfe was
cured of a Cataract in one of his Eyes,) that while the Siluer Needle
did worke vpon the Sight of his Eye, to remoue the Filme of the
Cataract, he neuer saw any thing more cleare or perfect, than that white
Needle: Which (no doubt,) was, because the Needle was lesser than the
Pupill of the Eye; and so Cooke not the Light from it. The other Errour
may be, for that the Obiect of Sight doth strike vpon the Pupill of the
Eye, directly without any interception; wheras the Caue of the Eare doth
hold off the Sound a little from the Organ: And so neuerthelesse there
is some Distance required in both.</p>
<p>Visibles are s-if-lior carried to the Sense, than Audibles; As
appeareth in Thunder and Lightning; Flame and Report of a Peece, —
Motion of the Aire in Hewing of Wood. All which haue beene set downe
heretofore, but are proper for this Title.</p>
<p>I conceiue also, that the Species of Audibles doe hang longer in the
Aire, than those of Visibles: For although euen those of Visibles, doe
hang some time, as we see in Rings turned, that shew like Spheres; In
Lute-strings fillipped, A Fire-brand caried along, which leaueth a
Traine of Light behinde it; and in the Twilight; And the like: Yet I
conceiue that Sounds stay longer, because they are carried vp and downe
with the Winde: And because of the Distance of the Time, in Ordnance a
discharged, and heard twenty Miles off.</p>
<p>In Visibles, there are not sound Obiects so odious and in grate to
the Sense, as in Audibles. For foule Sights doe rather displease, in
that they exci-e the Memory of foule Things, than in the immediate
Obiects. And therefore in —— — those foule Sights doe not much offend;
But in Audibles, the Grating of a Saw, when it is sharpned, doth offend
so much, as it Fen — the Teeth on Edge. And any of the harsh Discords in
Musicke, the Eare doth straight-waies refuse.</p>
<p>In Visibles, after great Light, if you come suddenly into the Darke;
Or contrariwise, out of the Darke into a Glaring light, the Eye is
dazled for a time; and the Sight confused; not whether any such Effect
be after great Sounds, or after a deepe Silence, may be better enquired.
It is an old Tradiribit, th — those that dwell heare the C — n — of Nil
— , are strucken deafe, But we finde no such effect, in Canno — ers, not
Millers, not those that dwell vpon Bridges.</p>
<p>It seemeth that the Impression of Colour is so weake, as it worketh
not but by a Cone of Direct Beames, or Right Lines; wherof the Basis is
in the Obiect, and the Verticall Point in the Eye; So as there is a
Corra-iation and Co — un —— of Beames; And those Beames so sent forth,
yet are not of any force to bege- the like borrowed or second Beames,
except it be by Reflexion, wherof we speake not. For the Beames passe,
and giue little Ta —— — to that — te, which is Adiacent; which if they
did, we should see Colours out of a Right line. But as this is in
Colours, so otherwise it is in the Body of Light. For when there is a
Skreene between the Candle and the Eye, yet the Light passeth to the
Paper wheron One writeth; So that the Light is seene, where the Body of
the Flame is not seene; And where any Colour (if it were placed where
the Body of the Blame is) would not be seene. I iudge that Sound is of
this Latter Nature: For when two are placed on both sides of a Wall, and
the Voice is heard, I iudge it is not onely the Originall Sound, which
passeth in an Arebed Line; But the Sound, which passeth aboue the Wall
in a Right Line, begetteth the like Motion round about it, as the first
did, though more weake.</p>
<p>All Concords and Discords of Musicke, are, (no doubt,) Sympathies,
and Antipathies of Sounds. And so (likewise) in that Musicke, which we
call Broken Musicke, or Consort Musicke; Some Consorts of Instruments
are sweeter than others; (A Thing not suffciently yet obserued:) As the
Irish Harpe, and Base Viall agree well: The Recorder and Stringed Musick
agree well: Organs and the Voice agree well; andandandandc. But the
Virginalls and the Lute; Or the Welch-Harpe, and, Irish-Harpe; Or the
Voice and Pipes alone, agree not so well; But for the Melieration of
Musicke, there is yet much lest (in this Point of Exquisite Consorts) to
try and ehquire.</p>
<p>There is a Common Obseruation, that if a Lute, or Viall, be layed
vpon the Backe, with a small Straw vpon one of the Strings; And another
Lute or Viall be laid by it; And in the other Lute or Viall, the Vnison
to that String be strucken; it will make the String, moue; Which will
appeare both to the Eye, and by the Strawes Falling off. The like will
be, if the Diapason or Eight to that String be strucken, either in the
same Lute, or Viall, or in others lying by; But in one of these there is
any Report of Sound, that can be discerned, but onely Motion.</p>
<p>It was deuised, that a Viall should haue a Lay of Wire Strings below,
as close to the Belly, as a Lute; And then the Strings of Guts mounted
vpon a Bridge, as in Ordinary Vialls; To the end, that by this means,
the vpper Strings strucken, should make the lower resound by Sympathy,
and so make the Musicke the better; Which, if it be to purpose, then
Sympathy worketh, as well by Report of Sound, as by Motion. But this
deuice I conceiue to be of no vse; because the vpper Strings, which are
stopped in great variety, cannot maintaine a Diapason or Vnison, with
the Lower, which are neuer stopped, But if it should be of vse at all;
it must be in Instruments which haue no Stops; as Virginalls, and
Harpes; wherin triall may be made of two Rowes of Strings, distant the
one from the other.</p>
<p>The Experiment of Sympathy may be transferred (perhaps) from
Instruments of Strings, to other Instruments of Sound. As to try if
there were in one Steeple, two Bells of Vnison, whether the striking of
the one would moue the other, more than if it were another Accord: And
so in pipes, (if they be of equall Bore, and Sound,) whether a little
Straw or Feather would moue in the one Pipe, when the other is blowne at
an Vnison.</p>
<p>It seemeth, both in Eare, and Eye, the Instrument of Sense hath a
Sympathy or Similitude with that which giueth the Reflexion; (As hath
beene touched befor.) For as the Sight of the Eye is like a Crystall, or
Glasse, or Water; So is the Eare a sinuous Caue, with a hard Bone, to
stop and reuerberate the Sound; Which is like to the Places that report
Eccho’s.</p>
<p>When a Man Yawneth, he cannot Heare so well. The Cause is, for that
the Membrane of the Eare is extended; And so rather casteth off the
Sound, than draweth it to.</p>
<p>We Heare better when we hold our Breath, than contrary; In so much as
in all Listening to attaine a Sound a farre off, Men hold their Breath.
The Cause is, For that in all Expiration, the Motion is Outwards; And
therefore, rather driueth away the voice, than draweth it: And besides
we see, that in all Labour to doe things with any strength, we hold the
Breath: And listening after any Sound, that is heard with difficulty, is
a kinde of Labour.</p>
<p>Let it be tryed, for the Helpe of the Hearing, (and I conceiue it
likely to succeed,) to make an Instrument like a Tunnell; The narrow
Part whereof may be of the Bignesse of the Hole of the Eare; And the
Broader End much larger, like a Bell at the Skirts; And the length halfe
a foot, or more. And let the narrow End of it be set close to the Eare:
And marke whether any Sound, abroad in the open Aire, will not be heard
distinctly, from further distance; than without that Instrument; being
(as it were) an Eare-Spectacle. And I haue heard there is in Spaine, an
Instrument in vse to be set to the Eare, that helpeth somewhat those
that are Thicke of Hearing.</p>
<p>If the Mouth be shut close, neuerthelesse there is yeelded by the
Roofe of the Mouth, a Murmur, Such as is vsed by dumbe Men: But if the
Nostrills be likewise stopped, on such Murmur can be made; Except it be
in the Bottome of the Pallate towards the Throat. Whereby it appeareth
manifestly, that a Sound in the Mouth, except such as aforesaid, if the
Mouth be stopped, passeth from the Pallate, thorow the Nostrills.</p>
<p>The Repercussion of Sounds, (which we call Eccho,) is a great
Argument of the Spirituall Essence of Sounds. For if it were
Corporeall,) the Repercussion should be created in the same maner, and
by like Instruments, with the Originall Sound-. But we see what a Number
of Exquisite Instruments must concurre in Speaking of Words, where of
there is no such Matter in the Returning of them; But onely a plaine
Stop, and Repercussion.</p>
<p>The Exquisite Differences of Articulate Sounds, carried along in the
Aire, shew that they cannot be Signalures or Impressions in the Aire, as
hath beene well refuted by the Ancients. For it is true, that Seales
make excellent Impressions: And so it may be thought of Sounds in their
first Generation: But then the Delation and Continuance of them without
any new Sealing, shew apparently they cannot be Impressions.</p>
<p>All Sounds are suddenly made, and doe suddenly perish; But neither
that, nor the Exquisite Differences of them, is Matter of so great
Admiration: For the —— e — gs, and Warblings to Lutes, and Pipes, are as
swift; And the Tongue, (which is no very fine Instrument,) doth in
Speech, make no fewer Motions, than there be Letters in all the Words,
which are vttered. But that Sounds should not onely be so speedily
generated, but carried so farre euery way, in such a momentany time,
deserueth more Admiration. As for Example; If a Man stand in the middle
of a Field, and speake aloud, he shall be heard a Furlong in round; And
that shall be in Articulate Sounds; And those shall be Entire in euery
little Portion of the Aire; And this shall be done in the Space of lesse
than a Minute.</p>
<p>The Sudden Generation and Perishing of Sounds, must be one of these
two Waies. Either that the Aire suffereth some Force by Sound, and then
restoreth it selfe; As Water doth; Which being diuided, maketh manny
Circles, till it restore it selfe to the naturall Consistence: Or
otherwise, that the Aire doth willingly imbibe the Sound as gratefull,
but cannot maintaine it; For that the Aire hath (as it should seeme) a
secret and hidden Appetite of Receiuing the Sound at the first; But then
other Grosse and more Materiate Qualities of the Aire straightwaies
suffocate it; Like vnto Flame, which is generated with Alacrity, but
straight quenched by the Enmity of the Aire, or other Ambient
Bodies.</p>
<p>There be these Differences (in generall) by which Sounds are diuided;
1. Musicall, Immusicall; 2. Treble, Base; 3. Flat, Sharpe; 4. Soft,
Loud; 5. Exteriour, Interiour, 6. Cleane, Harsb or Purling; 7.
Articulate, Inarticulate.</p>
<p>We haue laboured (as may appeare,) in this Inquisition of Sounds,
diligently; Both because Sound is one of the most Hidden Portions of
Nature, (as we said in the beginning:) And because it is a Vertue which
may be called Incorporeall, and Immateriate; wherof there be in Nature
but few. Besides, we were willing, (now in these our first Centuries,)
to make a Patterne or President of an Exact Inquisition; And we shall
doe the like hereafter in some other Subiects which require it. For we
desire that Men should learne and perceiue, how seuere a Thing the true
Inquisition of Nature is; And should accustome themselues, by the light
of Particulars, to enlarge their Mindes, to the Amplitude of the World;
And not reduce the World to the Narrownesse of their Mindes.</p>
<p>Metalls giue Orlens and Fine Colours in Dissolutions; As Gold giueth
an excellent Yellow; Quick-Siluer an excellent Greene; Tinne giueth an
excellent Azure: Likewise in their Putrefactions, or Rusts; As
Vermilion, Verdegrease, Bise, Cirrus, andandandandc. And likewise in
their vitrifications. The Cause is, for that by their Strength of Body,
they are able to endure the Fire, or Strong Waters, and to be put into
an Equall Posture; And againe to retaine Part of their principall
Spirit; Which two Things, (Equall Posture, and Quicke Spirits) are
required chiefely, to make Colours lightsome.</p>
<p>It conduceth vnto Long Life, and to the more Placide Motion of the
Spirits, which thereby doe lesse prey and consume the Iuyce of the Body;
Either that Mens Actions bee free and voluntary; That nothing bee done
Inuitâ Mineruâ, but Secundum Genium: Or on the other side, that the
Actions of Men bee full of Regulation, and Commands within themselues:
For then the Victory and Performing of the Command, giueth a good
Disposition to the Spirits; Especially if there bee a Proceeding from
Degree to Degree; For then the Sense of Victory is the greater. An
example of the former of these, is in a Countrey life; And of the
latter, in Monkes and Philosophers, and such as doe continually enioyne
themselues.</p>
<p>It is certaine, that in all Bodies, there is an Appetite of Vnion,
and Euitation of Solution of Continuity: And of this Appetite there bee
many Degrees; But the most Remarkable, and fit to bee distinguished, are
three. The first in Liquours; The second in Hard Bodies: And the third
in Bodies Cleaning or Tenacious. In Liquours, this Appetite is weake: We
see in Liquours, the Thredding of them in Stillicides, (as hath beene
said;) The Falling of them in Round Drops, (which is the forme of
Vnion;) And the Staying of them, for a little time, in Bubbles and
Froth. In the second Degree or Kinde, this Appetite is strong; As in
Iron, in Stone, in Wood, andandandandc. In the third, this Appetite is
in a Medium betweene the other two: For such Bodies doe partly follow
the Touch of another Body; And partly sticke and continue to themselues;
And therefore they roape, and draw themselues in Threds; As wee see in
Pitch, Glew, Birdlime, andandandandc. But note, that all Solide Bodies
are Cleaning, more or lesse: And that they loue better the Touch of
somewhat that is Tangible, than of Aire, For Water, in small quantity,
cleaueth to any Thing that is Solide; And so would Metall too, if the
weight drew it not off. And therefore Gold Foliate, or any Metall
Foliate, cleaueth: But those Bodies which are noted to bee Clammy, and
Cleauing, are such, as haue a more indifferent Appetite (at once,) to
follow another Body; And to hold to Themselues. And therefore they are
commonly Bodies ill mixed; And which take more pleasure in a Forraine
Body, than in preseruing their owne Consistence; And which haue little
predominance in Drought, or Moisture.</p>
<p>Time, and Heat, are Fellowes in many Effects.Heat drieth Bodies, that
doe easily expire; As Parchment, Leaues, Roots, Clay, andandandandc.
And, so doth Time or Age arefie; As in the same Bodies, andandandandc.
Heat dissolueth and melteth Bodies, that keepe in their Spirits; As in
diuers Liquefactions; And so doth Time, in some Bodies of a softer
Consistence: As a manifest in Honey, which by Age waxeth more liquid:
And the like in Sugar; And so in old Oyle, which is euer more cleare,
and more hot in Medicinable vse. Heat causeth the Spirits to search some
Issue out of the Body; As in the Volatility of Metalls; And so doth
Time; As in the Rust of Metalls. But generally Heat doththat in small
time, which Age doth in long.</p>
<p>Some Things which passe the Fire are softest at first, and by Time
grow hard; As the Crumme of Bread. Some are harder when they come from
the Fire, and afterwards giue againe, and grow soft, as the Crust of
Bread, Bisket, Sweet Meats, Salt, andandandandc. The Cause is, for that
in those things which waxe Hard with Time, the Worke of the Fire is a
Kinde of Melting: And in those that waxe Soft with Time, (contrariwise,)
the woke of the Fire is a Kinde of Baking; And whatsoeuer the Fire
baketh, Time doth in some degree dissolue.</p>
<p>Motions passe from one Man to another, not so much by Exciting
Imagination; as by Inuitation; Especially if there be an Aptnesse or
Inclination before. Therefore Gaping, or Yawning, and Stretching doe
passe from Man to Man; For that that causeth Gaping and Stretching is,
when the Spirits are a little Heauy, by any Vapour, or the like. For
then they striue, (as it were,) to wring out, and expell that which
loadeth them. So Men drowzy, and desirous to sleepe; Or before the Fit
of an Ague; doe vse to Yawne and Stretch; And doe likewise yeeld a Voice
or Sound, which is an Interiection of Expulsion: So that if another be
apt and prepared to doe the like, he followeth by the Sight of another.
So the Laughing of another maketh to Laugh.</p>
<p>There be some knowne Diseases that are Infectious; And Others that
are not. Those that are Infectious, are; First, such as are chiefly in
the Spirits, and not so much in the Humours; And therefore passe easily
from Body to Body: Such are Pestilences, Lippitudes; and such like.
Secondly, such as Taint the Breath; Which wee see passeth manifestly
from Man to Man; And not inuisibly, as the Affects of the Spirits doe:
Such are Consumptions of the Lungs, andandandandc. Thirdly such as come
forth to the Skinne; And therefore taint the Aire, or the BodyAdiacent;
Especially if they consist in an Vnctuous Substance, no apt to
dissipate; Such are Scabs, and Lepronsie. Fourthly, such as are meerely
in the Humours, and not in the Spirits, Breath, or Exhalations: And
therefore they neuer infect, but by Touch onely; and such a Touch also,
as commeth within the Epidermis; As the Venome of the French Poxe, And
the Biting of a Mad Dog.</p>
<p>Most Powders grow, more Close and Coherent by Mixture of Water, than
by Mixture of Oyle, though Oyle be the thicker Body; As Meale;
andandandandc. The Reason is the Congruity of Bodies; which if it be
more, maketh a Perfecter Imbibition, and Incorporation; Which in most
Powders is more betweene Them and Water, than betweene Them and Oyle:
But Printers Colours ground, and Ashes, doe better incorporate with
Oyle.</p>
<p>Much Motion and Exercise is good for some Bodies; And Sitting, and
lesse Motion for Others. If the Body be Hot, and Void of Superflous
Moistures, too much Motion hurteth: And it is an Errour in Physitians,
to call too much vpon Exercise. Likewise Men ought to beware, that they
vse not Exercise, and a Spare Diet both: But if much Exercise, then a
Plentifull Diet, And if Sp-ring Diet, then little Exercise. The Benefits
that come of Exercise are, First, that it sendeth Nourishment into the
Parts more forcibly. Secondly, that it helpeth to Exceme by Sweat, and
so maketh the Parts assimilate the more perfectly. Thirdly, that it
maketh the Substance of the Body more Solide and Compact; And so lesse
apt to be Consumed and Depredated by the Spirits. The Euills that come
of Exercise, are: First, that it maketh the Spirits more Hot and
Predatory. Secondly, that it doth absorbe likewise, and attenuate too
much the Moisture of the Body. Thirdly, that it maketh too great ——
sion, (especially if it be violent,) of the Inward Parts; which delight
more in Rest. But generally Exercise, if it be much, is no Friend to
Prolongation of Life; Which is one Cause, why Women liue longer than
Men, because they stirre lesse.</p>
<p>Some Food we may vse long, and much, without Glatting; As Bread,
Flesh that is not fat, or rancke, andandandandc. Some other, (though
pleasant,) Glutteth sooner; As Sweet Meats, Fat Meats, andandandandc.
The Cause is, for that Appetite consisteth in the Emptinesse of Mouth of
the Stomacke; Or possessing it with somewhat that is Astringent; and
therfore Cold and Dry. But things that are Sweet and Fat, are more
Filling: And do swimme and hang more about the Mouth of the Stomacke;
And goe not downe so speedily: And againe turne sooner to Choler, which
is hot, and euer abateth the Appetite. Wee see also, that another Cause
of Society, is an Ouer-custome; and of Appetite is Nouelty: And
therefore Meats, if the same be continually taken, induce Loathing. To
giue the Reason of the Distast of Society, and of the Pleasure in
Nouelty; and to distinguish not onely in Meats and Drinkes, but also in
Motions, Loues, Company, Delights, Studies, what they be that Custome
maketh more gratefull; And what more tedious; were a large Field. But
for Meats, the Cause is Attraction, which is quicker, and more excited
towards that which is new, than towards that whereof there remaineth a
Rellish by former vse. And (generally) it is a Rule, that whatsoeuer is
somewhat Ingrate at first, is made Gratefull by Custome; But whatsoeuer
is too Pleasing at first, groweth quickly to satiate.</p>
