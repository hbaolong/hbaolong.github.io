<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the twenty-second place
Instances of the Course, which I also call Instances of the Water,
borrowing the term from the hourglasses of the ancients, which contained
water instead of sand. These measure nature by periods of time, as the
instances of the rod by degrees of space. For all motion or natural
action is performed in time, some more quickly, some more slowly, but
all in periods determined and fixed in the nature of things. Even those
actions which seem to be performed suddenly and (as we say) in the
twinkling of an eye, are found to admit of degree in respect to
duration.</p>
<p>First, then, we see that the revolutions of heavenly bodies are
accomplished in calculated times, as also the flux and reflux of the
sea. The motion of heavy bodies to the earth, and of light bodies toward
the heavens, is accomplished in definite periods, varying with the
bodies moved and the medium through which they move. The sailing of
ships, the movements of animals, the transmission of missiles, are all
performed likewise in times which admit (in the aggregate) of
measurement. As for heat, we see boys in wintertime bathe their hands in
flame without being burned, and jugglers by nimble and equable movements
turn vessels full of wine or water upside down and then up again without
spilling the liquid; and many other things of a similar kind. The
compressions also and expansions and eruptions of bodies are performed,
some more quickly, some more slowly, according to the nature of the body
and motion, but in certain periods.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the explosion of several guns at once, which are heard
sometimes to the distance of thirty miles, the sound is caught by those
who are near the spot where the discharge is made sooner than by those
who are at a greater distance. Even in sight, whereof the action is most
rapid, it appears that there are required certain moments of time for
its accomplishment, as is shown by those things which by reason of the
velocity of their motion cannot be seen — as when a ball is discharged
from a musket. For the ball flies past in less time than the image
conveyed to the sight requires to produce an impression.</p>
<p>This fact, with others like it, has at times suggested to me a
strange doubt, viz., whether the face of a clear and starlit sky be seen
at the instant at which it really exists, and not a little later; and
whether there be not, as regards our sight of heavenly bodies, a real
time and an apparent time, just like the real place and apparent place
which is taken account of by astronomers in the correction for
parallaxes. So incredible did it appear to me that the images or rays of
heavenly bodies could be conveyed at once to the sight through such an
immense space and did not rather take a perceptible time in traveling to
us. But this suspicion as to any considerable interval between the real
time and the apparent afterward vanished entirely when I came to think
of the infinite loss and diminution of quantity which distance causes in
appearance between the real body of the star and its seen image; and at
the same time when I observed the great distance (sixty miles at the
least) at which bodies merely white are instantly seen here on earth;
while there is no doubt that the light of heavenly bodies exceeds many
times over in force of radiation not merely the vivid color of
whiteness, but also the light of every flame that is known to us. Again,
the immense velocity in the body itself as discerned in its daily motion
(which has so astonished certain grave men that they preferred believing
that the earth moved) renders this motion of ejaculation of rays
therefrom (although wonderful, as I have said, in speed) more easy of
belief. But what had most weight of all with me was that if any
perceptible interval of time were interposed between the reality and the
sight, it would follow that the images would oftentimes be intercepted
and confused by clouds rising in the meanwhile, and similar disturbances
in the medium. And thus much for the simple measures of time.</p>
<p>But not only must we seek the measure of motions and actions by
themselves but much more in comparison, for this is of excellent use and
very general application. Now we find that the flash of a gun is seen
sooner than its report is heard, although the ball must necessarily
strike the air before the flame behind it can get out. And this is
owing, it seems, to the motion of light being more rapid than that of
sound. We find, too, that visible images are received by the sight
faster than they are dismissed. Thus the strings of a violin when struck
by the finger are to appearance doubled or tripled, because a new image
is received before the old one is gone; which is also the reason why
rings being spun round look like globes, and a lighted torch, carried
hastily at night, seems to have a tail. And it was upon this inequality
of motions in point of velocity that Galileo built his theory of the
flux and reflux of the sea, supposing that the earth revolved faster
than the water could follow, and that the water therefore first gathered
in a heap and then fell down, as we see it do in a basin of water moved
quickly. But this he devised upon an assumption which cannot be allowed,
viz., that the earth moves, and also without being well informed as to
the sexhorary motion of the tide.</p>
<p>But an example of the thing I am treating of, to wit, the comparative
measures of motions — and not only of the thing itself, but also of its
eminent use (of which I spoke just now) — is conspicuous in mining with
gunpowder where vast masses of earth, buildings, and the like are upset
and thrown into the air by a very small quantity of powder. The cause of
which is doubtless this: that the motion of expansion in the impelling
powder is quicker many times over than the motion of the resisting
gravity, so that the first motion is over before the countermotion is
begun, and thus at first the resistance amounts to nothing. Hence too it
happens that in projectiles it is not the strong blow but the sharp and
quick that carries the body furthest. Nor would it be possible for the
small quantity of animal spirit in animals, especially in such huge
creatures as the whale or elephant, to bend and guide such a vast mass
of body were it not for the velocity of the spirit’s motion, and the
slowness of the bodily mass in exerting its resistance.</p>
<p>This one thing indeed is a principal foundation of the experiments in
natural magic (of which I shall speak presently) wherein a small mass of
matter overcomes and regulates a far larger mass — I mean the contriving
that of two motions one shall by its superior velocity get the start and
take effect before the other has time to act.</p>
<p>Lastly, this distinction of foremost and hindmost ought to be
observed in every natural action. Thus in an infusion of rhubarb the
purgative virtue is extracted first, the astringent afterward. And
something of the kind I have found on steeping violets in vinegar, where
the sweet and delicate scent of the flower is extracted first, and then
the more earthy part of the flower, which mars the scent. Therefore, if
violets be steeped in vinegar for a whole day the scent is extracted
much more feebly, but if you keep them in for a quarter of an hour only
and then take them out, and (since the scented spirit in violets is
small) put in fresh violets every quarter of an hour as many as six
times, the infusion is at last so enriched that although there have not
been violets in the vinegar, however renewed, for more than an hour and
a half altogether, there nevertheless remains in it a most grateful
odor, as strong as the violet itself, for an entire year. It should be
observed, however, that the odor does not gather its full strength till
after a month from the time of infusion. In the distillation too of
aromatic herbs crushed in spirit of wine, it appears that there first
rises an aqueous and useless phlegm, then a water containing more of the
spirit of wine, and lastly, a water containing more of the aroma. And of
this kind there are to be found in distillations a great many facts
worthy of notice. But let these suffice for examples.</p>
