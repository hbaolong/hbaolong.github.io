<h4 id="chapter-ii.">CHAPTER II.</h4>
<p>The Shackspere Monument, Bust, and Portrait.</p>
<p>In the year 1909 Mr. George Hookham in the January number of the
National Review sums up practically all that is really known of the life
of William Shakspeare of Stratford as follows: —</p>
<p>’We only know that he was born at Stratford, of illiterate parents —
(we do not know that he went to school there) — that, when 18-1/2 years
old, he married Anne Hathaway (who was eight years his senior, and who
bore him a child six months after marriage); that he had in all three
children by her (whom with their mother he left, and went to London,
having apparently done his best to desert her before marriage); — that
in London he became an actor with an interest in a theatre, and was
reputed to be the writer of plays; — that he purchased property in
Stratford, to which town he returned; — engaged in purchases and sales
and law-suits (of no biographical interest except as indicating his
money-making and litigious temperament); helped his father in an
application for coat armour (to be obtained by false pretences);
promoted the enclosure of common lands at Stratford (after being
guaranteed against personal loss); made his will — and died at the age
of 52, without a book in his possession, and leaving nothing to his wife
but his second best bed, and this by an afterthought. No record of
friendship with anyone more cultured than his fellow actors.</p>
<p>No letter, — only two contemporary reports of his conversation, one
with regard to the commons enclosure as above, and the other in
circumstances not to be recited unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In a word we know his parentage, birth, marriage, fatherhood,
occupation, his wealth and his chief ambition, his will and his death,
and absolutely nothing else; his death being received with unbroken and
ominous silence by the literary world, not even Ben Jonson who seven
years later glorified the plays in excelsis, expending so much as a
quatrain on his memory.’</p>
<p>To this statement by Mr. George Hookham I would add that we know W.
Shakspeare was christened 26th April 1564, that his Will which commences
“In the name of god Amen! I Willim Shackspeare, of Stratford upon Avon,
in the countie of warr gent in perfect health and memorie, god be
praysed,” was dated 25th (January altered to) March 1616, and it was
proved 22nd June 1616, Shakspeare having died 23rd April 1616, four
weeks after the date of the Will.</p>
<p>We also know that a monument was erected to him in Stratford Church.
And because L. Digges, in his lines in the Shakespeare folio of 1623
says “When Time dissolves thy Stratford Moniment,”1 it is supposed that
the monument must have been put up before 1623. But we should remember
that as Mrs. Stopes (who is by no means a Baconian) pointed out in the
Monthly Review of April 1904, the original monument was not like the
present monument which shews a man with a pen in his hand; but was the
very different monument which will be found depicted in Sir William
Dugdale’s “Antiquities of Warwickshire,” published in 1656. The bust
taken from this is shewn on Plate 5, Page 14, and the whole monument on
Plate 3, Page 8.</p>
<p>The figure bears no resemblance to the usually accepted likeness of
Shakspeare. It hugs a sack of wool, or a pocket of hops to its belly and
does not hold a pen in its hand.</p>
<p>In Plate 6, Page 15, is shewn the bust from the monument as it exists
at the present time, with the great pen in the right hand and a sheet of
paper under the left hand. The whole monument is shewn on Plate 4, Page
9.</p>
<p>The face seems copied from the mask of the so-called portrait in the
1623 folio, which is shewn in Plate 8.</p>
<p>It is desirable to look at that picture very carefully, because every
student ought to know that the portrait in the title-page of the first
folio edition of the plays published in 1623, which was drawn by Martin
Droeshout, is cunningly composed of two left arms and a mask. Martin
Droeshout, its designer, was, as Mr. Sidney Lee tells us, but 15 years
of age when Shakspeare died. He is not likely therefore ever to have
seen the actor of Stratford, yet this is the “Authentic,” that is the
“Authorised” portrait of Shakspeare, although there is no question —
there can be no possible question — that in fact it is a cunningly drawn
cryptographic picture, shewing two left arms and a mask.</p>
<p>The back of the left arm which does duty for the right arm is shewn
in</p>
<p>Plate 10, Page 26.</p>
<p>Every tailor will admit that this is not and cannot be the front of
the right arm, but is, without possibility of doubt, the back of the
left arm.</p>
<p>Plate 11 shews the front of the left arm, and you at once perceive
that you are no longer looking at the back of the coat but at the front
of the coat.</p>
<p>Head, from the [so-called]</p>
<p>Portrait, by Droeshout, in the 1623 Folio]</p>
<p>Now in Plate 12, Page 32, you see the mask, especially note that the
ear is a mask ear and stands out curiously; note also how distinct the
line shewing the edge of the mask appears. Perhaps the reader will
perceive this more clearly if he turns the page upside down.</p>
<p>Plate 13, Page 33, depicts a real face, that of Sir Nicholas Bacon,
eldest son of the Lord Keeper, from a contemporary portrait by Zucchero,
lately in the Duke of Fife’s Collection. This shews by contrast the
difference between the portrait of a living man, and the drawing of a
lifeless mask with the double line from ear to chin. Again examine
Plates 8, Pages 20, 21, the complete portrait in the folio. The reader
having seen the separate portions, will, I trust, be able now to
perceive that this portrait is correctly characterised as cunningly
composed of two left arms and a mask.</p>
<p>While examining this portrait, the reader should study the lines that
describe it in the Shakespeare folio of 1623, a facsimile of which is
here inserted.</p>
<p>To the Reader.</p>
<p>This Figure, that thou here seest put,</p>
<p>It was for gentle Shakespeare cut;</p>
<p>Wherein the Grauer had a strife</p>
<p>with Nature, to out-doo the life:</p>
<p>O, could he but haue drawne his wit</p>
<p>As well in brasse, as he hath hit</p>
<p>His face; the Print would then surpasse</p>
<p>All, that was euer writ in brasse.</p>
<p>But, since he cannot, Reader, looke</p>
<p>Not on his Picture, but his Booke.</p>
<p>B.I.</p>
<p>Plate IX.</p>
<p>VERSES ASCRIBED TO BEN JONSON, FROM THE 1623 FOLIO EDITION OF
SHAKESPEARE’S WORKS.</p>
<p>B.I. call the ridiculous dummy a “portrait” but describes it as the
“Figure put for” (that is “instead of”) and as “the Print,” and as “his
Picture”; he likewise most clearly tells us to “looke not on his
(ridiculous) Picture, but (only) his Booke.” It seems, therefore,
evident that he knew the secret of Bacon’s authorship and intended to
inform those capable of understanding that the graver had done out the
life when he writes, “Out-doo the life.” In the New English Dictionary,
edited by Sir J.A.H. Murray, there are upwards of six hundred words
beginning with “Out,” and every one of them, with scarcely a single
exception, requires, in order to be fully understood, to be read
reversed. Out-law does not mean outside of the law, but lawed out by a
legal process. “Out-doo” was used only in the sense of “do out”; thus,
in the “Cursor Mundi,” written centuries before the days of Elizabeth,
we read that Adam was out done [of Paradise]; and in Drayton’s “Barons’
Wars,” published in 1603, we find in Book V. s. li.</p>
<p>“That he his foe not able to withstand,</p>
<p>Was ta’en in battle and his eyes out-done.”</p>
<p>The graver has indeed done out the life so cleverly that for hundreds
of years learned pedants and others have thought that the figure
represented a real man, and altogether failed to perceive that it was a
mere stuffed dummy clothed in an impossible coat, cunningly composed of
the front of the left arm buttoned on to the back of the same left arm,
as to form a double left armed apology for a man. Moreover, this dummy
is surmounted by a hideous staring mask, furnished with an imaginary
ear, utterly unlike anything human, because, instead of being hollowed
in, it is rounded out something like the rounded outside of a shoe-horn,
in order to form a cup which would cover and conceal any real ear that
might be behind it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reader will more fully understand the full meaning of
B.I.’s lines if I paraphrase them as follows: —</p>
<p>To the Reader.</p>
<p>The dummy that thou seest set here,</p>
<p>Was put instead of Shake-a-speare;</p>
<p>Wherein the Graver had a strife</p>
<p>To extinguish all of Nature’s life;</p>
<p>O, could he but have drawn his mind</p>
<p>As well as he’s concealed behind</p>
<p>His face; the Print would then surpasse</p>
<p>All, that was ever writ in brasse.</p>
<p>But since he cannot, do not looke</p>
<p>On his mas’d Picture, but his Booke.</p>
<p>Do out appears in the name of the little instrument something like a
pair of snuffer which was formerly used to extinguish the candles and
called a “Doute.” Therefore I have correctly substituted “extinguished”
for “out-doo.” At the beginning I have substituted “dummy” for “figure”
because we are told that the figure is “put for” (that is, put instead
of) Shakespeare. In modern English we frequently describe a chairman who
is a mere dummy as a figurehead. Then “wit” in these lines means
absolutely the same as “mind,” which I have used in its place because I
think it refers to the fact that upon the miniature of Bacon in his 18th
year, which was painted by Hilliard in 1578, we read:— “Si tabula
daretur digna animum mallem.” This line is believed to have been written
at the time by the artist, and was translated in “Spedding”:— “If one
could but paint his mind.”</p>
<p>In March, 1911, the Tailor and Cutter newspaper stated that the
Figure, put for Shakepeare in the 1623 folio, was undoubtedly clothed in
an impossible coat, composed of the back and the front of the same left
arm. And in the following April the Gentleman’s Tailor Magazine, under
the heading of a “Problem for the Trade,” shews the two halves of the
coat as printed on page 28a, and says: “It is passing strange that
something like three centuries should have been allowed to elapse before
the tailors’ handiwork should have been appealed to in this particular
manner.”</p>
<p>“The special point is that in what is known as the authentic portrait
of William Shakespeare, which appears in the celebrated first folio
edition, published in 1623, a remarkable sartorial puzzle is
apparent.”</p>
<p>“The tunic, coat, or whatever the garment may have been called at the
time, is so strangely illustrated that the right-hand side of the
forepart is obviously the left-hand side of the backpart; and so gives a
harlequin appearance to the figure, which it is not unnatural to assume
was intentional, and done with express object and purpose.”</p>
<p>“Anyhow, it is pretty safe to say that if a Referendum of the trade
was taken on the question whether the two illustrations shown above
represent the foreparts of the same garments, the polling would give an
unanimous vote in the negative.”</p>
<p>“It is outside the province of a trade journal to dogmatise on such a
subject; but when such a glaring incongruity as these illustrations show
is brought into court, it is only natural that the tailor should have
something to say; or, at any rate, to think about.”</p>
<p>This one simple fact which can neither be disputed nor explained
away, viz., that the “Figure” put upon the title-page of the First Folio
of the Plays in 1623 to represent Shakespeare, is a doubly left-armed
and stuffed dummy, surmounted by a ridiculous putty-faced mask, disposes
once and for all of any idea that the mighty Plays were written by the
illiterate clown of Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>
<p>“He hath hit his face”</p>
<p>It is thought that hit means hid as in Chaucer’s Squiere’s Tale, line
512 etc.</p>
<p>“Right as a serpent hit him under floures</p>
<p>Til he may seen his tyme for to byte”</p>
<p>If indeed “hit” be intended to be read as “hid” then these ten lines
are no longer the cryptic puzzle which they have hitherto been
considered to be, but in conjunction with the portrait, they clearly
reveal the true facts, that the real author is writing left-handedly,
that means secretly, in shadow, with his face hidden behind a mask or
pseudonym.</p>
<p>We should also notice “out-doo” is spelled with a hyphen. In the
language of to-day and still more in that of the time of Shakespeare
all, or nearly all, words beginning with out may be read reversed,
out-bar is bar out, out-bud is bud out, out-crop is crop out, out-fit is
fit out, and so on through the alphabet.</p>
<p>If therefore we may read “out-doo the life” as “doo out the life”
meaning “shut out the real face of the living man” we perceive that here
also we are told “that the real face is hidden.”</p>
<p>The description, with the head line “To the Reader” and the signature
“B.I.,” forms twelve lines, the words of which can be turned into
numerous significant anagrams, etc., to which, however, no allusion is
made in the present work. But our readers will find that if all the
letters are counted (the two v.v.’s in line nine being counted as four
letters) they will amount to the number 287. In subsequent chapters a
good deal is said about this number, but here we only desire to say that
we are “informed” that the “Great Author” intended to reveal himself 287
years after 1623, the date when the First Folio was published, that is
in the present year, 1910, when very numerous tongues will be
loosened.</p>
<p>Examine once more the original Stratford Bust, Plate 5, Page 14, and
the present Stratford Bust, Plate 6, Page 15, with the large pen in the
right hand.</p>
<p>If the Stratford actor were indeed the author of the plays it was
most appropriate that he should have a pen in his hand. But in the
original monument as shewn in Plate 3, Page 8, the figure hugs a sack of
wool or a pocket of hops or may be a cushion. For about 120 years, this
continued to be the Stratford effigy and shewed nothing that could in
any way connect the man portrayed, with literary work. I believe that
this was not accidental. I think that everybody in Stratford must have
known that William “Shackspeare” could not write so much as his own
name, for I assert that we possess nothing which can by any reasonable
possibility be deemed to be his signature.</p>
