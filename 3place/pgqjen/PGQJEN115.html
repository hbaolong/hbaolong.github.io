<ol type="1">
<li><p>Now we descend to that part which concerneth the illustration of
tradition, comprehended in that science which we call rhetoric, or art
of eloquence, a science excellent, and excellently well laboured. For
although in true value it is inferior to wisdom (as it is said by God to
Moses, when he disabled himself for want of this faculty, “Aaron shall
be thy speaker, and thou shalt be to him as God”), yet with people it is
the more mighty; for so Solomon saith, Sapiens corde appellabitur
prudens, sed dulcis eloquio majora reperiet, signifying that
profoundness of wisdom will help a man to a name or admiration, but that
it is eloquence that prevaileth in an active life. And as to the
labouring of it, the emulation of Aristotle with the rhetoricians of his
time, and the experience of Cicero, hath made them in their works of
rhetoric exceed themselves. Again, the excellency of examples of
eloquence in the orations of Demosthenes and Cicero, added to the
perfection of the precepts of eloquence, hath doubled the progression in
this art; and therefore the deficiences which I shall note will rather
be in some collections, which may as handmaids attend the art, than in
the rules or use of the art itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding, to stir the earth a little about the roots of
this science, as we have done of the rest, the duty and office of
rhetoric is to apply reason to imagination for the better moving of the
will. For we see reason is disturbed in the administration thereof by
three means — by illaqueation or sophism, which pertains to logic; by
imagination or impression, which pertains to rhetoric; and by passion or
affection, which pertains to morality. And as in negotiation with
others, men are wrought by cunning, by importunity, and by vehemency; so
in this negotiation within ourselves, men are undermined by
inconsequences, solicited and importuned by impressions or observations,
and transported by passions. Neither is the nature of man so
unfortunately built, as that those powers and arts should have force to
disturb reason, and not to establish and advance it. For the end of
logic is to teach a form of argument to secure reason, and not to entrap
it; the end of morality is to procure the affections to obey reason, and
not to invade it; the end of rhetoric is to fill the imagination to
second reason, and not to oppress it; for these abuses of arts come in
but ex oblique, for caution.</p></li>
<li><p>And therefore it was great injustice in Plato, though springing
out of a just hatred to the rhetoricians of his time, to esteem of
rhetoric but as a voluptuary art, resembling it to cookery, that did mar
wholesome meats, and help unwholesome by variety of sauces to the
pleasure of the taste. For we see that speech is much more conversant in
adorning that which is good than in colouring that which is evil; for
there is no man but speaketh more honestly than he can do or think; and
it was excellently noted by Thucydides, in Cleon, that because he used
to hold on the bad side in causes of estate, therefore he was ever
inveighing against eloquence and good speech, knowing that no man can
speak fair of courses sordid and base. And therefore, as Plato said
elegantly, “That virtue, if she could be seen, would move great love and
affection;” so seeing that she cannot be showed to the sense by corporal
shape, the next degree is to show her to the imagination in lively
representation; for to show her to reason only in subtlety of argument
was a thing ever derided in Chrysippus and many of the Stoics, who
thought to thrust virtue upon men by sharp disputations and conclusions,
which have no sympathy with the will of man.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, if the affections in themselves were pliant and obedient
to reason, it were true there should be no great use of persuasions and
insinuations to the will, more than of naked proposition and proofs; but
in regard of the continual mutinies and seditious of the affections
—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Video meliora, proboque,</p>
<p>Deteriora sequor,”</p>
<p>reason would become captive and servile, if eloquence of persuasions
did not practise and win the imagination from the affections’ part, and
contract a confederacy between the reason and imagination against the
affections; for the affections themselves carry ever an appetite to
good, as reason doth. The difference is, that the affection beholdeth
merely the present; reason beholdeth the future and sum of time. And,
therefore, the present filling the imagination more, reason is commonly
vanquished; but after that force of eloquence and persuasion hath made
things future and remote appear as present, then upon the revolt of the
imagination reason prevaileth.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>We conclude, therefore, that rhetoric can be no more charged with
the colouring of the worst part, than logic with sophistry, or morality
with vice; for we know the doctrines of contraries are the same, though
the use be opposite. It appeareth also that logic differeth from
rhetoric, not only as the fist from the palm — the one close, the other
at large — but much more in this, that logic handleth reason exact and
in truth, and rhetoric handleth it as it is planted in popular opinions
and manners. And therefore Aristotle doth wisely place rhetoric as
between logic on the one side, and moral or civil knowledge on the
other, as participating of both; for the proofs and demonstrations of
logic are toward all men indifferent and the same, but the proofs and
persuasions of rhetoric ought to differ according to the auditors:—</li>
</ol>
<p>“Orpheus in sylvis, inter delphinas Arion.”</p>
<p>Which application in perfection of idea ought to extend so far that
if a man should speak of the same thing to several persons, he should
speak to them all respectively and several ways; though this politic
part of eloquence in private speech it is easy for the greatest orators
to want: whilst, by the observing their well-graced forms of speech,
they leese the volubility of application; and therefore it shall not be
amiss to recommend this to better inquiry, not being curious whether we
place it here or in that part which concerneth policy.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Now therefore will I descend to the deficiences, which, as I said,
are but attendances; and first, I do not find the wisdom and diligence
of Aristotle well pursued, who began to make a collection of the popular
signs and colours of good and evil, both simple and comparative, which
are as the sophisms of rhetoric (as I touched before). For example
—</li>
</ol>
<p>“Sophisma.</p>
<p>Quod laudatur, bonum: quod vituperatur, malum.</p>
<p>Redargutio.</p>
<p>Laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces.”</p>
<p>Malum est, malum est (inquit emptor): sed cum recesserit, tum
gloriabitur! The defects in the labour of Aristotle are three — one,
that there be but a few of many; another, that there elenches are not
annexed; and the third, that he conceived but a part of the use of them:
for their use is not only in probation, but much more in impression. For
many forms are equal in signification which are differing in impression,
as the difference is great in the piercing of that which is sharp and
that which is flat, though the strength of the percussion be the same.
For there is no man but will be a little more raised by hearing it said,
“Your enemies will be glad of this” —</p>
<p>“Hoc Ithacus velit, et magno mercentur Atridae.”</p>
<p>than by hearing it said only, “This is evil for you.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Secondly, I do resume also that which I mentioned before,
touching provision or preparatory store for the furniture of speech and
readiness of invention, which appeareth to be of two sorts: the one in
resemblance to a shop of pieces unmade up, the other to a shop of things
ready made up; both to be applied to that which is frequent and most in
request. The former of these I will call antitheta, and the latter
formulae.</p></li>
<li><p>Antitheta are theses argued pro et contra, wherein men may be
more large and laborious; but (in such as are able to do it) to avoid
prolixity of entry, I wish the seeds of the several arguments to be cast
up into some brief and acute sentences, not to be cited, but to be as
skeins or bottoms of thread, to be unwinded at large when they come to
be used; supplying authorities and examples by reference.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Pro verbis legis.</p>
<p>Non est interpretatio, sed divinatio, quae recedit a litera:—</p>
<p>Cum receditur a litera, judex transit in legislatorem.</p>
<p>Pro sententia legis.</p>
<p>Ex omnibus verbis est eliciendus sensus qui interpretatur
singula.”</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Formulae are but decent and apt passages or conveyances of speech,
which may serve indifferently for differing subjects; as of preface,
conclusion, digression, transition, excusation, andandandandc. For as in
buildings there is great pleasure and use in the well casting of the
staircases, entries, doors, windows, and the like; so in speech, the
conveyances and passages are of special ornament and effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>“A conclusion in a deliberative. So may we redeem the faults passed,
and prevent the inconveniences future.”</p>
