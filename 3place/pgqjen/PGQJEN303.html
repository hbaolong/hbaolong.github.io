<p>Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the fourteenth place
Instances of the Fingerpost, borrowing the term from the fingerposts
which are set up where roads part, to indicate the several directions.
These I also call Decisive and Judicial, and in some cases, Oracular and
Commanding Instances. I explain them thus. When in the investigation of
any nature the understanding is so balanced as to be uncertain to which
of two or more natures the cause of the nature in question should be
assigned on account of the frequent and ordinary concurrence of many
natures, instances of the fingerpost show the union of one of the
natures with the nature in question to be sure and indissoluble, of the
other to be varied and separable; and thus the question is decided, and
the former nature is admitted as the cause, while the latter is
dismissed and rejected. Such instances afford very great light and are
of high authority, the course of interpretation sometimes ending in them
and being completed. Sometimes these instances of the fingerpost meet us
accidentally among those already noticed, but for the most part they are
new, and are expressly and designedly sought for and applied, and
discovered only by earnest and active diligence.</p>
<p>For example, let the nature in question be the ebb and flow of the
sea; each of which is repeated twice a day, and takes six hours each
time, subject to some slight difference which coincides with the motion
of the moon. The following will be a case of the parting of the
roads.</p>
<p>This motion must necessarily be caused either by the advance and
retreat of the waters, as water shaken in a basin leaves one side when
it washes the other; or else by a lifting up of the waters from the
bottom and falling again, as water in boiling rises and falls. The
question is to which of these two causes the ebb and flow should be
assigned. Now, if we take the first, it follows that when there is a
flood on one side of the sea, there must be at the same time an ebb
somewhere on the other. To this point therefore the inquiry is brought.
Now it has been observed by Acosta and others, after careful research,
that on the shores of Florida and the opposite shores of Spain and
Africa the floods take place at the same times, and the ebbs take place
at the same times also; and not that there is an ebb from the shores of
Spain and Africa when there is a flood on the shores of Florida. And yet
if you look at it more closely, this does not prove the case in favor of
the rising and against the progressive motion. For waters may move in
progression, and yet rise upon the opposite shores of the same channel
at the same time, as when they are thrust together and driven on from
some other quarter. For so it is with rivers, which rise and fall on
both banks at the same hours. And yet that motion is clearly one of
progression, namely, of the waters entering the mouth of the rivers from
the sea. It may therefore happen in a like manner that waters coming in
a vast mass from the East Indian Ocean are driven together and pushed
into the channel of the Atlantic, and on that account flood both sides
at once. We must inquire therefore whether there be any other channel in
which the water can be retreating and ebbing at that same time; and we
have the South Sea, a sea at least as wide, indeed wider and larger than
the Atlantic, which is sufficient for the purpose.</p>
<p>At length then, we have come to an instance of the fingerpost in this
case, and it is this. If we find for certain that when there is a flood
on the opposite coasts of Florida and Spain in the Atlantic, there is
also a flood on the coasts of Peru and the back of China in the South
Sea, then indeed on the authority of this decisive instance we must
reject the assertion that the ebb and flow of the sea, which is the
thing inquired into, takes place by a progressive motion; for there is
no sea or place left in which the retreat or ebbing can be going on at
the same time. And this may be most conveniently ascertained by asking
the inhabitants of Panama and Lima (where the two oceans, the Atlantic
and Pacific, are separated by a small isthmus) whether the ebb and flow
of the sea takes place on the opposite sides of the isthmus at the same
time; or contrariwise, when it is ebbing on one side it is flowing on
the other. Now this decision or rejection appears to be certain, if we
take it for granted that the earth is immovable. But if the earth
revolves, it is perhaps possible that in consequence of the unequal
rotation (in point of speed) of the earth and waters of the sea, the
waters are violently driven upwards into a heap, which is the flood, and
(when they can bear no more piling) released and let down again, which
is the ebb. But on this inquiry should be made separately. Still, even
on this hypothesis, our position remains equally fixed, that there must
of necessity be an ebb of the sea going on in some parts at the same
time that a flood is going on in others.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be the latter of the two motions we
have supposed, namely, the rising and sinking motion, if on careful
examination we reject the former motion of which I spoke — the
progressive. With regard to this nature the road branches into three.
For the motion by which the waters rise in the flood and sink in the ebb
without any accession of other waters rolling in, must necessarily be
brought about in one of these three ways. Either there is an accession
of water poured out from the interior of the earth, and again retreating
into it; or there is no accession to the mass of water, but the same
waters (without increase of quantity) are extended or rarefied so as to
occupy a greater space and dimension, and again contract themselves; or
there is no increase either of supply or of extension, but the same
waters (the same in quantity as in density) are raised by some magnetic
force attracting them from above, and by consent therewith, and then
fall back again. Let us now dismiss the two former causes of motion and
reduce our inquiry to the last; that is to say, let us inquire whether
any such raising by consent or magnetic force may happen. Now in the
first place it is evident that the waters, as they lie in the trench or
hollow of the sea, cannot all be raised at once for want of something to
take their place at the bottom; so that even if there were in water any
such desire to rise, it would be barred and checked by the cohesion of
things, or (as it is commonly called) the abhorrence of a vacuum. It
remains that the waters must be raised in one part, and thereby be
diminished and retreat in another. Again, it will follow of necessity
that the magnetic force, since it cannot act upon the whole, will act
with the greatest intensity on the middle, so as to raise up the water
in the middle; upon which the rest must follow and fall away from the
sides.</p>
<p>Thus at length we come to an instance of the fingerpost on this
subject. For if we find that in the ebb of the sea the surface of the
water is more arched and round, the waters rising in the middle of the
sea and falling away from the sides, that is, the shores; and that in
the flood the same surface is more even and level, the waters returning
to their former position; then indeed on the authority of this decisive
instance the raising by magnetic force may be admitted; otherwise it
must be utterly rejected. And this would not be difficult to ascertain
by trial in straits with sounding lines, viz., whether during ebbs the
sea be not higher or deeper toward the middle than during floods. It is
to be observed however that, if this be the case, the waters must
(contrary to the common opinion) rise in ebbs and sink in floods, so as
to clothe and wash the shores.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature investigated be the spontaneous motion of
rotation, and in particular whether the diurnal motion whereby to our
eyes the sun and stars rise and set, be a real motion of rotation in the
heavenly bodies, or a motion apparent in the heavenly bodies, and real
in the earth. We may here take for an instance of the fingerpost the
following. If there be found in the ocean any motion from east to west,
however weak and languid; if the same motion be found a little quicker
in the air, especially within the tropics, where because of the larger
circles it is more perceptible; if the same motion be found in the lower
comets, but now lively and vigorous; if the same motion be found in
planets, but so distributed and graduated that the nearer a planet is to
the earth its motion is slower, the further a planet is distant from the
earth its motion is quicker, and quickest of all in the starry sphere;
then indeed we should receive the diurnal motion as real in the heavens,
and deny such motion to the earth. Because it will be manifest that
motion from east to west is perfectly cosmical, and by consent of the
universe, being most rapid in the highest parts of the heavens, and
gradually falling off, and finally stopping and becoming extinct in the
immovable — that is, the earth.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be that other motion of rotation so
much talked of by philosophers, the resistant and contrary motion to the
diurnal, viz., from west to east, which old philosophers attribute to
the planets, also to the starry sphere, but Copernicus and his followers
to the earth as well. And let us inquire whether any such motion be
found in nature, or whether it be not rather a thing invented and
supposed for the abbreviation and convenience of calculation, and for
the sake of that pretty notion of explaining celestial motions by
perfect circles. For this motion in the heavens is by no means proved to
be true and real, either by the failing of a planet to return in its
diurnal motion to the same point of the starry sphere, or by this, that
the poles of the zodiac differ from the poles of the world; to which two
things we owe this idea of motion. For the first phenomenon is well
accounted for by supposing that the fixed stars outrun the planets and
leave them behind; the second, by supposing a motion in spiral lines; so
that the inequality of return and the declination to the tropics may
rather be modifications of the one diurnal motion than motions contrary
or round different poles. And most certain it is, if one may but play
the plain man for a moment (dismissing the fancies of astronomers and
schoolmen, whose way it is to overrule the senses, often without reason,
and to prefer what is obscure), that this motion does actually appear to
the sense such as I have described; for I once had a machine made with
iron wires to represent it.</p>
<p>The following would be an instance of the fingerpost on this subject.
If it be found in any history worthy of credit that there has been any
comet, whether high or low, which has not revolved in manifest agreement
(however irregular) with the diurnal motion, but has revolved in the
opposite direction, then certainly we may set down thus much as
established, that there may be in nature some such motion. But if
nothing of the kind can be found, it must be regarded as questionable,
and recourse be had to other instances of the fingerpost about it.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be weight or heaviness. Here the
road will branch into two, thus. It must needs be that heavy and weighty
bodies either tend of their own nature to the center of the earth, by
reason of their proper configuration; or else that they are attracted by
the mass and body of earth itself as by the congregation of kindred
substances, and move to it by sympathy. If the latter of these be the
cause, it follows that the nearer heavy bodies approach to the earth,
the more rapid and violent is their motion to it; and that the further
they are from the earth, the feebler and more tardy is their motion (as
is the case with magnetic attraction); and that this action is confined
to certain limits. So that if they were removed to such a distance from
the earth that the earth’s virtue could not act upon them, they would
remain suspended like the earth itself, and not fall at all. With regard
to this, then, the following would be an instance of the fingerpost.
Take a clock moved by leaden weights, and another moved by the
compression of an iron spring. Let them be exactly adjusted, that one go
not faster or slower than the other. Then place the clock moving by
weights on the top of a very high steeple, keeping the other down below,
and observe carefully whether the clock on the steeple goes more slowly
than it did on account of the diminished virtue of its weights. Repeat
the experiment in the bottom of a mine, sunk to a great depth below the
ground; that is, observe whether the clock so placed does not go faster
than it did on account of the increased virtue of its weights. If the
virtue of the weights is found to be diminished on the steeple and
increased in the mine, we may take the attraction of the mass of the
earth as the cause of weight.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature investigated be the polarity of the iron needle
when touched with the magnet. With regard to this nature the road will
branch into two, thus. Either the touch of the magnet of itself invests
the iron with polarity to the north and south; or it simply excites and
prepares the iron, while the actual motion is communicated by the
presence of the earth, as Gilbert thinks, and labors so strenuously to
prove. To this point therefore tend the observations which he has
collected with great sagacity and industry. One is, that an iron nail
which has lain for a long time in a direction between north and south
gathers polarity without the touch of the magnet by its long continuance
in this position; as if the earth itself, which on account of the
distance acts but feebly (the surface or outer crust of the earth being
destitute, as he insists, of magnetic power), were yet able by this long
continuance to supply the touch of the magnet and excite the iron, and
then shape and turn it when excited. Another is, that if iron that has
been heated white-hot be, while cooling, laid lengthwise between north
and south, it also acquires polarity without the touch of the magnet; as
if the parts of the iron, set in motion by ignition and afterwards
recovering themselves, were at the very moment of cooling more
susceptible and sensitive to the virtue emanating from the earth than at
other times, and thus became excited by it. But these things, though
well observed, do not quite prove what he asserts.</p>
<p>Now with regard to this question an instance of the fingerpost would
be the following. Take a magnetic globe and mark its poles; and set the
poles of the globe toward the east and west, not toward the north and
south, and let them remain so. Then place at the top an untouched iron
needle, and allow it to remain in this position for six or seven
days.</p>
<p>The needle while over the magnet (for on this point there is no
dispute) will leave the poles of the earth and turn toward the poles of
the magnet; and therefore, as long as it remains thus, it points east
and west. Now if it be found that the needle, on being removed from the
magnet and placed on a pivot, either starts off at once to the north and
south, or gradually turns in that direction, then the presence of the
earth must be admitted as the cause; but if it either points as before
east and west, or loses its polarity, this cause must be regarded as
questionable, and further inquiry must be made.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be the corporeal substance of the
moon; that is, let us inquire whether it be rare, consisting of flame or
air, as most of the old philosophers opined, or dense and solid, as
Gilbert and many moderns, with some ancients, maintain. The reasons for
the latter opinion rest chiefly on this, that the moon reflects the rays
of the sun; nor does light seem to be reflected except by solid bodies.
Therefore instances of the fingerpost on this question will (if any) be
those which prove that reflection may take place from a rare body, as
flame, provided it be of sufficient denseness. Certainly, one cause of
twilight, among others, is the reflection of the rays of the sun from
the upper part of the air. Likewise we occasionally see rays of the sun
in fine evenings reflected from the fringes of dewy clouds with a
splendor not inferior to that reflected from the body of the moon, but
brighter and more gorgeous; and yet there is no proof that these clouds
have coalesced into a dense body of water. Also we observe that the dark
air behind a window at night reflects the light of a candle, just as a
dense body would. We should also try the experiment of allowing the
sun’s rays to shine through a hole on some dusky bluish flame. For
indeed the open rays of the sun, falling on the duller kinds of flame,
appear to deaden them so that they seem more like white smoke than
flame. These are what occur to me at present as instances of the
fingerpost with reference to this question, and better may perhaps be
found. But it should always be observed that reflection from flame is
not to be expected, except from a flame of some depth, for otherwise it
borders on transparency. This however may be set down as certain — that
light on an even body is always either received and transmitted or
reflected.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be the motion of projectiles
(darts, arrows, balls, etc.) through the air. This motion the schoolmen,
as their way is, explain in a very careless manner, thinking it enough
to call it a violent motion as distinguished from what they call a
natural motion; and to account for the first percussion or impulse by
the axiom that two bodies cannot occupy the same place on account of the
impenetrability of matter, and not troubling themselves at all how the
motion proceeds afterward. But with reference to this inquiry the road
branches into two in this way. Either this motion is caused by the air
carrying the projected body and collecting behind it, as the stream in
the case of a boat, or the wind in that of straws; or it is caused by
the parts of the body itself not enduring the impression, but pushing
forward in succession to relieve themselves from it. The former of these
explanations is adopted by Fracastorius and almost all who have entered
into the investigation with any subtlety, and there is no doubt that the
air has something to do with it. But the other notion is undoubtedly the
true one, as is shown by countless experiments. Among others the
following would be an instance of the fingerpost on this subject: that a
thin iron plate or stiffish iron wire, or even a reed or pen split in
half, when pressed into a curve between the finger and thumb, leaps
away. For it is obvious that this motion cannot be imputed to the air
gathering behind the body, because the source of motion is in the middle
of the plate or reed, not in the extremities.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be the rapid and powerful motion of
the expansion of gunpowder into flame, by which such vast masses are
upheaved, such great weights discharged, as we see in mines and mortars.
With respect to this nature the road branches into two in this way. The
motion is excited either by the mere desire of the body to expand when
set on fire, or partly by that and partly by the desire of the crude
spirit in the body, which flies rapidly away from the fire and bursts
violently from its embrace as from a prison house. The schoolmen and
common opinion deal only with the former desire. For men fancy
themselves very fine philosophers when they assert that the flame is
endowed by its elementary form with a necessity of occupying a larger
space than the body had filled when in the form of powder, and that
hence the motion ensues. Meanwhile, they forget to notice that although
this be true on the supposition that flame is generated, it is yet
possible for the generation of flame to be hindered by a mass of matter
sufficient to suppress and choke it; so that the case is not reduced to
the necessity they insist on. For that expansion must necessarily take
place, and that there must needs follow thereon a discharge or removal
of the opposing body, if flame be generated, they rightly judge. But
this necessity is altogether avoided if the solid mass suppress the
flame before it be generated. And we see that flame, especially in its
first generation, is soft and gentle, and requires a hollow space
wherein to play and try its strength. Such violence therefore cannot be
attributed to flame by itself. But the fact is that the generation of
these windy flames, or fiery winds as they may be called, arises from a
conflict of two bodies of exactly opposite natures; the one being highly
inflammable, which is the nature of sulphur, the other abhorring flame,
as the crude spirit in niter. So that there ensues a strange conflict,
the sulphur kindling into flame with all its might (for the third body,
the willow charcoal, does no more than incorporate and combine the other
two), while the spirit of the niter bursts forth with all its might and
at the same time dilates itself (as air, water, and all crude bodies do
when affected by heat), and by thus flying and bursting out fans
meanwhile the flame of the sulphur on all sides as with hidden
bellows.</p>
<p>On this subject we may have instances of the fingerpost of two kinds.
The first, of those bodies which are most highly inflammable, as
sulphur, camphor, naphtha and the like, with their compounds, which
catch fire more quickly and easily than gunpowder if not impeded (from
which it appears that the desire of bursting into flame does not produce
by itself that stupendous effect); the other, of those bodies which shun
and abhor flame, as all salts. For we find that if salts are thrown into
the fire their aqueous spirit bursts out with a crackling noise before
flame is caught; which is the case also, though in a milder degree, with
the stiffer kinds of leaves, the aqueous part escaping before the oily
catches fire. But this is best seen in quicksilver, which is not inaptly
called mineral water. For quicksilver, without bursting into flame, by
mere eruption and expansion almost equals the force of gunpowder, and is
also said, when mixed with gunpowder, to increase its strength.</p>
<p>Again, let the nature in question be the transitory nature of flame
and its instantaneous extinction. For the nature of flame appears to
have no fixed consistency here with us, to be every moment generated and
every moment extinguished; for it is clear that in flames which continue
and last, the continuance we see is not of the same individual flame,
but is caused by a succession of new flame regularly generated. Nor does
the flame remain numerically identical, as is easily seen from this,
that if the food or fuel of flame be taken away, the flame instantly
goes out. With reference to this nature the roads branch into two, thus:
the instantaneous nature proceeds either from a cessation of the cause
which at first produced the flame, as in light, sound, and the motion
called “violent”; or from this, that the flame, though able by its own
nature to remain with us, suffers violence and is destroyed by the
contrary natures that surround it.</p>
<p>On this subject therefore we may take the following as an instance of
the fingerpost. We see in large fires how high the flames ascend, for
the broader the base of the flame, the higher is its vertex. Thus
extinction appears to commence at the sides, where the flame is
compressed and troubled by the air. But the heart of the flame, which is
not touched by the air but surrounded by other flame on all sides,
remains numerically identical; nor is it extinguished until gradually
compressed by the surrounding air. Thus all flame is in the form of a
pyramid, being broader at the base where the fuel is, but sharp at the
vertex, where the air is antagonistic and fuel is wanting. But smoke is
narrow at the base and grows broader as it ascends, like an inverted
pyramid; the reason being that the air admits smoke and compresses
flame. For let no one dream that lighted flame is air, when in fact they
are substances quite heterogeneous.</p>
<p>But we may have an instance of the fingerpost more nicely adapted to
this purpose, if the thing can be made manifest with bicolored lights.
Fix a lighted wax taper in a small metal stand; place the stand in the
middle of a bowl, and pour round it spirit of wine, but not enough to
reach the top of the stand. Then set fire to the spirit of wine. The
spirit of wine will yield a bluish, the taper a yellow flame. Observe
therefore whether the flame of the taper (which is easily distinguished
by its color from the flame of the spirit of wine, since flames do not
mix at once, as liquids do) remains in a conical or rather tends to a
globular form, now that there is nothing to destroy or compress it. If
the latter is found to be the case, it may be set down as certain that
flame remains numerically identical as long as it is enclosed within
other flame and feels not the antagonistic action of the air.</p>
<p>Let this suffice for instances of the fingerpost. I have dwelt on
them at some length to the end that men may gradually learn and accustom
themselves to judge of nature by instances of the fingerpost and
experiments of light, and not by probable reasonings.</p>
