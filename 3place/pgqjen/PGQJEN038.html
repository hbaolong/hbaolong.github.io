<p>Orpheus, or Philosophy Explained of Natural and Moral Philosophy</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION - The fable of Orpheus, though trite and common, has
never been well interpreted, and seems to hold out a picture of
universal philosophy; for to this sense may be easily transferred what
is said of his being a wonderful and perfectly, divine person, skilled
in all kinds of harmony, subduing and drawing all things after him by
sweet and gentle methods and modulations. For the labours of Orpheus
exceed the labours of Hercules, both in power and dignity, as the works
of knowledge exceed the works of strength.</p>
<p>FABLE - Orpheus having his beloved wife snatched from him by sudden
death, resolved upon descending to the infernal regions, to try if, by
the power of his harp, he could reobtain her. And, in effect, he so
appeased and soothed the infernal powers by the melody and sweetness of
his harp and voice, that they indulged him the liberty of taking her
back, on condition that she should follow him behind, and he not turn to
look upon her till they came into open day; but he, through the
impatience of his care and affection, and thinking himself almost past
danger, at length looked behind him, whereby the condition was violated,
and she again precipitated to Pluto’s regions. From this time Orpheus
grew pensive and sad, a hater of the sex, and went into solitude, where,
by the same sweetness of his harp and voice, he first drew the wild
beasts of all sorts about him; so that, forgetting their natures, they
were neither actuated by revenge, cruelty, lust, hunger, or the desire
of prey, but stood gazing about him, in a tame and gentle manner,
listening attentively to his music. Nay, so great was the power and
efficacy of his harmony, that it even caused the trees and stones to
remove, and place themselves in a regular manner about him. When he had
for a time, and with great admiration, continued to do this, at length
the Thracian women, raised by the instigation of Bacchus, first blew a
deep and hoarse-sounding horn, in such an outrageous manner, that it
quite drowned the music of Orpheus. And thus the power which, as the
link of their society, held all things in order, being dissolved,
disturbance reigned anew; each creature returned to its own nature, and
pursued and preyed upon its fellow, as before. The rocks and woods also
started back to their former places; and even Orpheus himself was at
last torn to pieces by these female furies, and his limbs scattered all
over the desert. But, in sorrow and revenge for his death, the river
Helicon, sacred to the Muses, hid its waters under ground, and rose
again in other places.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION - The fable receives this explanation. The music of
Orpheus is of two kinds; one that appeases the infernal powers, and the
other that draws together the wild beasts and trees. The former properly
relates to natural, and the latter to moral philosophy, or civil
society. The reinstatement and restoration of corruptible things is the
noblest work of natural philosophy; and, in a less degree, the
preservation of bodies in their own state, or a prevention of their
dissolution and corruption. And if this be possible, it can certainly be
effected no other way than by proper and exquisite attemperations of
nature; as it were by the harmony and fine touching of the harp. But as
this is a thing of exceeding great difficulty, the end is seldom
obtained; and that, probably, for no reason more than a curious and
unseasonable impatience and solicitude.</p>
<p>And, therefore, philosophy, being almost unequal to the task, has
cause to grow sad, and hence betakes itself to human affair, insinuating
into men’s minds the love of virtue, equity, and peace, by means of
eloquence and persuasion; thus forming men into societies; bringing them
under laws and regulations; and making them forget their unbridled
passions and affections, so long as they hearken to precepts and submit
to discipline. And thus they soon after build themselves habitations,
form cities, cultivate lands, plant orchards, gardens, andandandandc. So
that they may not improperly be said to remove and call the trees and
stones together.</p>
<p>And this regard to civil affairs is justly and regularly placed after
diligent trial made for restoring the mortal body; the attempt being
frustrated in the end - because the unavoidable necessity of death, thus
evidently laid before mankind, animates them to seek a kind of eternity
by works of perpetuity, character, and fame.</p>
<p>It is also prudently added, that Orpheus was afterwards averse to
women and wedlock, because the indulgence of a married state, and the
natural affections which men have for their children, often prevent them
from entering upon any grand, noble, or meritorious enterprise for the
public good; as thinking it sufficient to obtain immortality by their
descendants, without endeavouring at great actions.</p>
<p>And even the works of knowledge, though the most excellent among
human things, have their periods; for after kingdoms and commonwealths
have flourished for a time, disturbances, seditions, and wars, often
arise, in the din thereof: first the laws are silent, and not heard; and
then men return to their own depraved natures - whence cultivated lands
and cities soon become desolate and waste. And if this disorder
continues, learning and philosophy is infallibly torn to pieces; so that
only some scattered fragments thereof can afterwards be found up and
down, in a few places, like planks after a shipwreck. And barbarous
times succeeding, the river Helicon dips under-ground; that is, letters
are buried, till things having undergone their due course of changes,
learning rises again, and show its head, though seldom in the same
place, but in some other nation.</p>
