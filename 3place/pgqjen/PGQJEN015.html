<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>Of the limits and end of knowledge.</p>
<p>In the divine nature, both religion and philosophy hath acknowledged
goodness in perfection, science or providence comprehending all things,
and absolute sovereignty or kingdom. In aspiring to the throne of power,
the angels transgressed and fell; in presuming to come within the oracle
of knowledge, man transgressed and fell; but in pursuit towards the
similitude of God’s goodness or love, which is one thing, for love is
nothing else but goodness put in motion or applied, neither man or
spirit ever hath transgressed, or shall transgress.</p>
<p>The angel of light that was, when he presumed before his fall, said
within himself, “I will ascend and be like unto the Highest;” not God,
but the Highest. To be like to God in goodness, was no part of his
emulation: knowledge, being in creation an angel of light, was not the
want which did most solicit him; only because he was a minister he aimed
at a supremacy; therefore his climbing or ascension was turned into a
throwing down or precipitation.</p>
<p>Man, on the other side, when he was tempted before he fell, had
offered unto him this suggestion, “that he should be like unto God.” But
how? not simply, but in this part, “knowing good and evil.” For being in
his creation invested with sovereignty of all inferior creatures, he was
not needy of power or dominion. But again, being a spirit newly enclosed
in a body of earth, he was fittest to be allured with appetite of light
and liberty of knowledge. Therefore this approaching and intruding into
God’s secrets and mysteries, was rewarded with a further removing and
estranging from God’s presence. But as to the goodness of God, there is
no danger in contending or advancing towards a similitude thereof; as
that which is open and propounded to our imitation. For that voice,
whereof the heathen and all other errors of religion have ever confessed
that it sounds not like man, “Love your enemies; be you like unto your
heavenly Father, that suffereth his rain to fall both upon the just and
the unjust,” doth well declare, that we can in that point commit no
excess. So again we find it often repeated in the old law, “Be ye holy
as I am holy;” and what is holiness else but goodness, as we consider it
separate and guarded from all mixture, and all access of evil!</p>
<p>Wherefore seeing that knowledge is of the number of those things
which are to be accepted of with caution and distinction; being now to
open a fountain, such as it is not easy to discern where the issues and
streams thereof will take and fall; I thought it good and necessary in
the first place, to make a strong and sound head or bank to rule and
guide the course of the waters; by setting down this position or
firmament, namely, “That all knowledge is to be limited by religion, and
to be referred to use and action.”</p>
<p>For if any man shall think, by view and inquiry into these sensible
and material things, to attain to any light for the revealing of the
nature or will of God, he shall dangerously abuse himself. It is true,
that the contemplation cf the creatures of God hath for end, as to the
natures of the creatures themselves, knowledge; out as to the nature of
God, no knowledge, butwonder; which is nothing else but contemplation
broken off, or losing itself. Nay further, as it was aptly said by one
of Plato’s school, “the sense of man resembles the sun, which openeth
and revealeth the terrestrial globe, but obscureth and concealeth the
celestial;” so doth the sense discover natural things, but darken and
shut up divine. And this appeareth sufficiently in that there is no
proceeding in invention of knowledge, but by similitude; and God is only
self-like, having nothing in common with any creature, otherwise as in
shadow and trope. Therefore attend his will as himself openeth it, and
give unto faith that which unto faith belongeth; for more worthy it is
to believe than to think or know, considering that in knowledge, as we
now are capable of it, the mind suffereth from inferior natures; but in
all belief it suffereth from a spirit, which it holdeth superior, and
more authorized than itself.</p>
<p>To conclude; the prejudice hath been infinite, that both divine and
human knowledge hath received by the intermingling and tempering of the
one with the other: as that which hath filled the one full of heresies,
and the other full of speculative fictions and vanities.</p>
<p>But now there are again, which, in a contrary extremity to those
which give to contemplation an over-large scope, do offer too great a
restraint to natural and lawful knowledge; being unjustly jealous that
every reach and depth of knowledge wherewith their conceits have not
been acquainted, should be too high an elevation of man’s wit, and a
searching and ravelling too far into God’s secrets; an opinion that
ariseth either of envy, which is proud weakness, and to be censured and
not confuted, or else of a deceitful simplicity. For if they mean that
the ignorance of a second cause doth make men more devoutly to depend
upon the providence of God, as supposing the effects to come immediately
from his hand; I demand of them, as Job demanded of his friends, “Will
you lie for God, as man will for man to gratify him?” But if any man,
without any sinister humour, doth indeed make doubt that this digging
further and further into the mine of natural knowledge, is a thing
without example, and uncommended in the Scriptures, or fruitless; let
him remember and be instructed: for behold it was not that pure light of
natural knowledge, whereby man in paradise was able to give unto every
living creature a name according to his propriety, which gave occasion
to the fall; but it was an aspiring desire to attain to that part of
moral knowledge, which defineth of good and evil, whereby to dispute
God’s commandments, and not to depend upon the revelation of his will,
which was the original temptation. And the first holy records, which
within those brief memorials of things which passed before the flood,
entered few things as worthy to be registered, but only lineages and
propagations, yet nevertheless honour the remembrance of the inventor
both of music and works in metal. Moses again, who was the reporter, is
said to have been seen in all the Egyptian learning, which nation was
early and leading in matter of knowledge. And Solomon the king, as out
of a branch of his wisdom extraordinarily petitioned and granted from
God, is said to have written a natural history of all that is green,
from the cedar to the moss, which is but a rudiment between putrefaction
and an herb, and also of all that liveth and moveth. And if the book of
Job be turned over, it will be found to have much aspersion of natural
philosophy. Nay, the same Solomon the kinga ffirmeth directly, that the
glory of God “is to conceal a thing, but the glory of the king is to
find it out,” as if, according to the innocent play of children, the
Divine Majesty took delight to hide his works, to the end to have them
found out; for in naming the king he intendeth man, taking such a
condition of man as hath most excellency and greatest commandments of
wits and means, alluding also to his own person, being truly one of
those clearest burning lamps, whereof himself speaketh in another place,
when he saith, “The spirit of man is as the lamp of God, wherewith he
searcheth all inwardness;” which nature of the soul the same Solomon,
holding precious and inestimable, and therein conspiring with the
affection of Socrates, who scorned the pretended learned men of his time
for raising great benefit of their learning, whereas Anaxagoras
contrariwise, and divers others, being born to ample patrimonies,
decayed them in contemplation, delivereth it in precept yet remaining,
“Buy the truth and sell it not; and so of wisdom and knowledge.”</p>
<p>And lest any man should retain a scruple, as if this thirst of
knowledge were rather an humour of the mind, than an emptiness or want
in nature, and an instinct from God; the same author defineth of it
fully, saying, “God hath made every thing in beauty according to season;
also he hath set the world in man’s heart, yet can he not find out the
work which God worketh from the beginning to the end:” declaring not
obscurely that God hath framed the mind of man as a glass, capable of
the image of the universal world, joying to receive the signature
thereof, as the eye is of light; yea, not only satisfied in beholding
the variety of things, and vicissitude of times, but raised also to find
out and discern those ordinances and decrees, which throughout all these
changes are infallibly observed. And although the highest generality of
motion, or summary law of nature, God should still reserve within his
own curtain; yet many and noble are the inferior and secondary
operations which are within man’s sounding. This is a thing which I
cannot tell whether I may so plainly speak as truly conceive, that as
all knowledge appeareth to be a plant of God’s own planting, so it may
seem the spreading and flourishing, or at least the bearing and
fructifying of this plant, by a providence of God, nay, not only by a
general providence but by a special prophecy, was appointed to this
autumn ot the world: for to my understanding, it is not violent to the
letter, and safe now after the event, so to interpret that place in the
prophecy of Daniel, where, speaking of the latter limes, it is said,
“Many shall pass to and fro, and science shall be increased;” as if the
opening of the world by navigation and commerce, and the further
discovery of knowledge, should meet in one time or age.</p>
<p>But howsoever that be, there are besides the authorities of
Scriptures before recited, two reasons of exceeding great weight and
force, why religion should dearly protect all increase of natural
knowledge: the one, because it leadeth to the greater exaltation of the
glory of God; for as the Psalms and other Scriptures do often invite us
to consider, and to magnify the great and wonderful works of God; so if
we should rest only in the contemplation of those shows which first
offer themselves to our senses, we should do a like injury to the
majesty of God, as if we should judge of the store of some excellent
jeweller, by that only which is set out to the street in his shop. The
other reason is, because it is a singular help and preservative against
unbelief and error: for saith our Saviour, “You err, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God;” laying before us two books or volumes
to study, if we will be secured from error; first the Scriptures
revealing the will of God, and then the creatures expressing his power;
for that latter book will certify us, that nothing which the first,
teacheth shall be thought impossible. And most sure it is, and a true
conclusion of experience, that a little natural philosophy inclineth the
mind to atheism, but a further proceeding bringeth the mind back to
religion.</p>
<p>To conclude then: Let no man presume to check the liberality of God’s
gifts, who, as was said, “hath set the world in man’s heart.” So as
whatsoever is not God, but parcel of the world, he hath fitted it to the
comprehension of man’s mind, if man will open and dilate the powers of
his understanding as he may.</p>
<p>But yet evermore it must be remembered, that the least part of
knowledge passed to man by this so large a charter from God, must be
subject to that use for which God hath granted it, which is the benefit
and relief of the state and society of man: for otherwise all manner of
knowledge becometh malign and serpentine, and therefore, as carrying the
quality of the serpent’s sting and malice, it maketh the mind of man to
swell; as the Scripture sayeth excellently, “Knowledge bloweth up, but
charity buildeth up.” And again, the same author doth notably disavow
both power and knowledge, such as is not dedicated to goodness or love;
for saith he, “If I have all faith, so as I could remove mountains,”
there is power active; “If I render my body to the fire,” there is power
passive; “If I speak with the tongues of men and angels,” there is
knowledge, for language is but the conveyance of knowledge, “all were
nothing.”</p>
<p>And therefore it is not the pleasure of curiosity, nor the quiet of
resolution, nor the raising of the spirit, nor victory of wit, nor
faculty of speech, nor lucre of profession, nor ambition of honour or
fame, or inablement for business, that are the true ends of knowledge;
some of these being more worthy than other, though all inferior and
degenerate: but it is a restitution and reinvesting, in great part, of
man to the sovereignty and power, for whensoever he shall be able to
call the creatures by their true names, he shall again command them,
which he had in his first state of creation. And to speak plainly and
clearly, it is a discovery of all operations and possibilities of
operations from immortality, if it were possible, to the meanest
mechanical practice. And therefore knowledge, that tendeth but to
satisfaction, is but as a courtesan, which is for pleasure, and not for
fruit or generation. And knowledge that tendeth to profit or profession,
or glory, is but as the golden ball thrown before Atalanta; which while
she goeth aside, and stoopeth to take up, she hindereth the race. And
knowledge referred to some particular point of use, is but as Harmodius,
which putteth down one tyrant: and not like Hercules, who did
perambulate the world to suppress tyrants and giants and monsters in
every part.</p>
<p>It is true, that in two points the curse is peremptory, and not to be
removed: the one, that vanity must be the end in all human effects;
eternity being resumed though the revolutions and periods may be
delayed. The other, that the consent of the creature being now turned
into reluctation, this power cannot otherwise be exercised and
administered but with labour, as well in inventing as in executing; yet
nevertheless chiefly that labour and travel which is described by the
sweat of the brows, more than of the body; that is, such travel as is
joined with the working and discursion of the spirits in the brain: for
as Solomon saith excellently, “The fool putteth to more strength, but
the wise man considereth which way;” signifying the election of the mean
to be more material than the multiplication of endeavour. It is true
also that there is a limitation rather potential than actual, which is
when the effect is possible, but the time or place yieldeth not the
matter or basis whereupon man should work. But notwithstanding these
precincts and bounds, let it be believed, and appeal thereof made to
time, with renunciation nevertheless to all the vain and abusing
promises of alchemists and magicians, and such like light, idle,
ignorant, credulous, and fantastical wits and sects, that the new-found
world of land was not greater addition to the ancient continent, than
there remaineth at this day a world of inventions and sciences unknown,
having respect to those that are known, with this difference, that the
ancient regions of knowledge will seem as barbarous, compared with the
new; as the new regions of people seem barbarous, compared to many of
the old.</p>
<p>The dignity of this end, of endowment of man’s life with new
commodities, appeareth by the estimation that antiquity made of such as
guided thereunto; for whereas founders of states, lawgivers, extirpers
of tyrants, fathers of the people, were honoured but with the titles of
worthies or demigods, inventors were ever consecrated amongst the gods
themselves. And if the ordinary ambitions of men lead them to seek the
amplification of their own power in their countries, and a better
ambition than that hath moved men to seek the amplification of the power
of their own countries amongst other nations: better again and more
worthy must that aspiring be, which seeketh the amplification of the
power and kingdom of mankind over the world: the rather, because the
other two prosecutions are ever culpable of much perturbation and
injustice; but this is a work truly divine, which cometh “in aura leni,”
without noise or observation.</p>
<p>The access also to this work hath been by that port or passage, which
the Divine Majesty, who is unchangeable in his ways, doth infallibly
continue and observe; that is, the felicity wherewith he hath blessed an
humility of mind, such as rather laboureth to spell, and so by degrees
to read in the volumes of his creatures, than to solicit and urge, and
as it were to invocate a man’s own spirit to divine, and give oracles
unto him. For as in the inquiry of divine truth, the pride of man hath
ever inclined to leave the oracles of God’s word, and to vanish in the
mixture of their own inventions; so in the selfsame manner, in
inquisition of nature, they have ever left the oracles of God’s works,
and adored the deceiving and deformed imagery, which the unequal mirrors
of their own minds have represented unto them. Nay, it is a point fit
and necessary in the front, and beginning of this work, without
hesitation or reservation to be professed, that it is no less true in
this human kingdom of knowledge, than in God’s kingdom of heaven, that
no man shall enter into it, “except he become first as a little
child.”</p>
<p>Of the impediments of knowledge.</p>
<p>Being the IVth chapter, the preface only of it.</p>
<p>In some things it is more hard to attempt than to achieve; which
falleth out, when the difficulty is not so much in the matter or
subject, as it is in the crossness and indisposition of the mind of man
to think of any such thing, to will or to resolve it; and therefore
Titus Livius in his declamatory digression, wherein he doth depress and
extenuate the honour of Alexander’s conquests saith, “Nihil aliud quam
bene ausus vana contemnere:” in which sort of things it is the manner of
men first to wonder that any such thing should be possible, and after it
is found out, to wonder again how the world should miss it so long. Of
this nature I take to be the invention and discovery of knowledge,
andandandandc.</p>
<p>The impediments which have been in the times, and in diversion of
wits.</p>
<p>Being the Vth chapter, a small fragment in the beginning of that
chapter.</p>
<p>The encounters of the times have been nothing favourable and
prosperous for the invention of knowledge, so as it is not only the
daintiness of the seed to take, and the ill mixture and unliking of the
ground to nourish or raise this plant, but the ill season also of the
weather, by which it hath been checked and blasted. Especially in that
the seasons have been proper to bring up and set forward other more
hasty and indifferent plants, whereby this of knowledge hath been
starved and overgrown; for in the descent of times always there hath
been somewhat else in reign and reputation, which hath generally aliened
and diverted wits and labours from that employment.</p>
<p>For as for the uttermost antiquity, which is like fame that muffles
her head, and tells tales, I cannot presume much of it; for I would not
willingly imitate, the manner of those that describe maps, which when
they come to some far countries, whereof they have no knowledge, set
down how there be great wastes and deserts there: so I am not apt to
affirm that they knew little, because what they knew is little known to
us. But if you will judge of them by the last traces that remain to us,
you will conclude, though not so scornfully as Aristotle doth, that
saith our ancestors were extreme gross, as those that came newly from
being moulded out of the clay, or some earthly substance; yet reasonably
and probably thus, that it was with them in matter of knowledge, but as
the dawning or break of day. For at that time the world was altogether
home-bred, every nation looked little beyond their own confines or
territories, and the world had no thorough lights then, as it hath had
since by commerce and navigation, whereby there could neither be that
contribution of wits one to help another, nor that variety of
particulars for the correcting the customary conceits.</p>
<p>And as there could be no great collection of wits of several parts or
nations, so neither could there be any succession of wits of several
times, where by one might refine the other, in regard they had not
history to any purpose. And the manner of their traditions was utterly
unfit and unproper for amplification of knowledge. And again, the
studies of those times, you shall find, besides wars, incursions and
rapines, which were then almost everywhere betwixt states adjoining, the
use of leagues and confederacies being not then known, were to populate
by multitude of wives and generation, a thing at this day in the waster
part of the West Indies principally effected; and to build, sometimes
for habitation, towns and cities; sometimes for fame and memory,
monuments, pyramids, colosses, and the like. And if there happened to
rise up any more civil wits; then would he found and erect some new
laws, customs, and usages, such as now of late years, when the world was
revolute almost to the like rudeness and obscurity, we see both in our
own nation and abroad many examples of, as well in a number of tenures
reserved upon men’s lands, as in divers customs of towns and manors,
being the devises that such wits wrought upon in such times of deep
ignorance, andandandandc.</p>
<p>The impediments of knowledge for want of a true succession of wits,
and that hitherto the length of one mail’s life hath been the greatest
measure of knowledge.</p>
<p>Being the VIth chapter, the whole chapter.</p>
<p>In arts mechanical the first devise cometh shortest, and time addeth
and perfecteth. But in sciences of conceit, the first author goeth
furthest, and time leeseth and corrupteth. Painting, artillery, sailing,
and the like, grossly managed at first, by time accommodate and refined.
The philosophies and sciences of Aristotle, Plato, Democritus,
Hippocrates, of most vigour at first, by time degenerated and irabased.
In the former, many wits and industries contributed in one. In the
latter many men s wits spent to deprave the wit of one.</p>
<p>The error is both in the deliverer and in the receiver. He that
delivereth knowledge, desireth to deliver it in such form as may be
soonest believed, and not as may easiliest be examined. He that
receiveth knowledge desireth rather present satisfaction than expectant
search, and so rather not to doubt than not to err. Glory maketh the
author not lay open his weakness; and sloth maketh the disciple not to
know his strength.</p>
<p>Then begin men to aspire to the second prizes, to be a profound
interpreter and commenter, to be a sharp champion and defender, to be a
methodical compounder and abridger. And this is the unfortunate
succession of wits which the world hath yet had, whereby the patrimony
of all knowledge goeth not on husbanded or improved, but wasted and
decayed. For knowledge is like a water, that will never arise again
higher than the level from which it fell. And therefore to go beyond
Aristotle by the light of Aristotle, is to think that a borrowed light
can increase the original light from whom it is taken. So then, no true
succession of wits having been in the world; either we must conclude,
that knowledge is but a task for one man’s life, and then vain was the
complaint, that “life is short, and art is long:” or else, that the
knowledge that now is, is but a shrub; and not that tree which is never
dangerous, but where it is to the purpose of knowing good and evil;
which desire ever riseth upon an appetite to elect, and not to obey, and
so containeth in it a manifest defection.</p>
<p>That the pretended succession nf wits hath been evil placed, for as
much as after variety of sects and opinions, the most popular and not
the truest prevaileth and weareth out the rest.</p>
<p>Being the VIIth chapter, a fragment.</p>
<p>It is sensible to think, that when men enter first into search and
inquiry, according to the several rames and compositions of heir
understanding, hey light upon differing conceits, and so all opinions
and doubts are beaten over; and then men having made a taste of all, wax
weary of variety, and so reject the worst, and hold themselves to te
best, either some one, if it be eminent: or some two or three, if they
be in some equality; vhich afterwards are received and carried on, and
the rest extinct.</p>
<p>But truth is contrary; and that time is like a river which carrieth
down things which are light and blown up, and sinketh and drowneth that
which is sad and weighty. For howsoever governments have several forms,
sometimes one governing, sometimes few, sometimes the multitude; yet the
state of knowledge is ever a democracy, and that prevaileth which is
most agreeable to the senses and conceits of people. As for example,
there is no great doubt, but he that did put the beginnings of things to
be solid, void, and motion to the centre, was in better earnest than he
that put matter, form, and shift; or he that put the mind, motion, and
matter. For no man shall enter into inquisition of nature, but shall
pass by that opinion of Democritus; whereas he shall never come near the
other two opinions, but leave them aloof, for the schools and
table-talk. Yet those of Aristotle and Plato, because they be both
agreeable to popular sense, and the one was uttered with subtilty and
the spirit of contradiction, and the other with a style of ornament and
majesty, did hold out, and the other gave place, andandandandc.</p>
<p>Of the impediments of knowledge, in handling it by parts, and in
slipping off particular sciences from the root and stock of universal
knowledge.</p>
<p>Being the VIIIth chapter, the whole chapter.</p>
<p>Cicero, the orator, willing to magnify his own profession, and
thereupon spending many words to maintain that eloquence was not a shop
of good words and elegancies, but a treasury and receipt of all
knowledges, so far forth as may appertain to the handling and moving of
the minds and affections of men by speech, maketh great complaint of the
school of Socrates; that whereas before his time the same professors of
wisdom in Greece did pretend to teach an universal sapience and
knowledge both of matter and words, Socrates divorced them, and withdrew
philosophy, and left rhetoric to itself, which by that destitution
became but a barren and unnoble science. And in particular sciences we
see, that if men fall to subdivide their labours, as to be an oculist in
physic, or to be perfect in some one title of the law or the like, they
may prove ready and subtile, but not deep or sufficient, no, not in that
subject which they do particularly attend, because of that consent which
it hath with the rest. And it is a matter of common discourse of the
chain of sciences, how they are linked together, insomuch as the
Grecians, who had terms at will, have fitted it of a name of
Circle-Learning. Nevertheless I that hold it for a great impediment
towards the advancement and further invention of knowledge, that
particular arts and sciences have been disincorporated from general
knowledge, do not understand one and the same thing, which Cicero’s
discourse and the note and conceit of the Grecians in their word
Circle-Learning do intend. For I mean not that use which one science
hath of another for ornament or help in practice, as the orator hath of
knowledge of affections for moving, or as military science may have use
of geometry for fortifications; but I mean it directly of that use by
way of supply of light and information, which the particulars and
instances of one science do yield and present for the framing or
correcting of the axioms of another science in their very truth and
notion. And therefore that example of oculist and title lawyers doth
come nearer my conceit than the other two; for sciences distinguished
have a dependence upon universal knowledge to be augmented and rectified
by the superior light thereof; as well as the parts and members of a
science have upon the maxims of the same science, and the mutual light
and consent which one part receiveth of another. And therefore the
opinion of Copernicus in astronomy, which astronomy itself cannot
correct, because it is not repugnant to any of the appearances, yet
natural philosophy doth correct. On the other side, if some of the
ancient philosophers had been perfect in the observations of astronomy,
and had called them to counsel, when they made their principles and
first axioms, they would never have divided their philosophy, as the
cosmographers do their descriptions by globes, making one philosophy for
heaven, and another for under heaven, as in effect they do.</p>
<p>So if the moral philosophers, that have spent such an infinite
quantity of debate touching good and the highest good, had cast their
eye abroad upon nature, and beheld the appetite that is in all things to
receive and to give; the one motion affecting preservation, and the
other multiplication; which appetites are most evidently seen in living
creatures, in the pleasure of nourishment and generation; and in man do
make the aptest and most natural division of all his desires, being
either of sense of pleasure, or sense of power; and in the universal
frame of the world are figured, the one in the beams of heaven which
issue forth, and the other in the lap of the earth which takes in: and
again, if they had observed the motion of congruity, or situation of the
parts in respect of the whole, evident in so many particulars: and
lastly, if they had considered the motion, familiar in attraction of
things, to approach to that which is higher in the same kind: when by
these observations, so easy and concurring in natural philosophy, they
should have found out this quaternion of good, in enjoying or fruition,
effecting or operation, consenting or proportion, and approach or
assumption; they would have saved and abridged much of their long and
wandering discourses of pleasure, virtue, duty, and religion. So
likewise in this same logic and rhetoric, or acts of argument and grace
of speech, if the great masters of them would but have gone a form
lower, and looked but into the observations of grammar concerning the
kinds of words, their derivations, deflexions, and syntax, specially
enriching the same, with the helps of several languages, with their
differing properties of words, phrases, and tropes, they might have
found out more and better footsteps of common reason, help of
disputation, and advantages of cavillation, than many of these which
they have propounded. So again, a man should be thought to dally, if he
did note how the figures of rhetoric and music are many of them the
same. The repetitions and traductions in speech, and the reports and
hauntings of sounds in music, are the very same things. Plutarch hath
almost made a book of the Lacedæmonian kind of jesting, which joined
every pleasure with distaste. “Sir,” said a man of art to Philip king of
Macedon, when he controlled him in his faculty, “God forbid your fortune
should be such as to know these things better than I.” In taxing his
ignorance in his art, he represented to him the perpetual greatness of
his fortune, leaving him no vacant time for so mean a skill. Now in
music it is one of the ordinariest flowers to fall from a discord, or
hard tune, upon a sweet accord. The figure that Cicero and the rest
commend, as one of the best points of elegancy, which is the fine
checking of expectation, is no less well known to the musicians, when
they have a special grace in flying the close or cadence. And these are
no allusions but direct communities, the same delights of the mind being
to be found not only in music, rhetoric, but in moral philosophy,
policy, and other knowledges, and that obscure in the one, which is more
apparent in the other; yea, and that discovered in the one, which is not
found at all in the other; and so one science greatly aiding to the
invention and augmentation of another. And therefore, without this
intercourse, the axioms of sciences will fall out to be neither full nor
true; but will be such opinions, as Aristotle in some places doth wisely
censure, when he saith, “These are the opinions of persons that have
respect but to a few things.” So then we see, that this note leadeth us
to an administration of knowledge in some such order and policy, as the
King of Spain, in regard of his great dominions, useth in state: who,
though he hath particular councils for several countries and affairs,
yet had one council of state, or last resort, that receiveth the
advertisements and certificates from all the rest. Hitherto of the
diversion, succession, and conference of wits.</p>
<p>That the end and scope nf knowledge hath been generally mistaken, and
that men were never well advised what it was they sought.</p>
<p>Being the IXth chapter, immediately preceding the Inventory, and
inducing the same.</p>
<p>It appeareth then how rarely the wits and labours of men have been
converted to the severe and original inquisition of knowledge; and in
those who have pretended, what hurt hath been done by the affectation of
professors, and the distraction of such as were no professors; and how
there was never in effect any conjunction or combination of wits in the
first and inducing search, but that every man wrought apart, and would
either have his own way, or else would go no further than his guide,
having in the one case the honour of a first, and in the other the ease
of a second; and lastly, how in the descent and continuance of wits and
labours, the succession hath been in the most popular and weak opinions,
like unto the weakest natures, which many times have most children; and
in them also the condition of succession hath been rather to defend and
to adorn, than to add; and if to add, yet that addition to be rather a
refining of a part, than an increase of the whole. But the impediments
of time and accidents, though they have wrought a general indisposition,
yet are they not so peremptory and binding, as the internal impediments
and clouds in the mind and spirit of man, whereof it now followeth to
speak.</p>
<p>The Scripture, speaking of the worst sort of error, saith, “Errare
fecit eos in invio et non in via.” For a man may wander in the way, by
rounding up and down; but if men have failed in their very direction and
address, that error will never by good fortune correct itself. Now it
hath fared with men in their contemplations, as Seneca saith it fareth
with them in their actions, “De partibus vitæ quisque deliberat, de
summa nemo.” A course very ordinary with men who receive for the most
part their final ends from the inclination of their nature, or from
common example and opinion, never questioning or examining them, nor
reducing them to any clear certainty, and use only to call themselves to
account and deliberation touching the means and second ends, and thereby
set themselves in the right way to the wrong place. So likewise upon the
natural curiosity and desire to know, they have put them selves in way
without foresight or consideration of their journey’s end.</p>
<p>For I find that even those that have sought knowledge for itself, and
not for benefit, or ostentation, or any practicable enablement in the
course of their life, have nevertheless propounded to themselves a wrong
mark, namely, satisfaction, which men call truth, and not operation. For
as in the courts and services of princes and slates, it is a much easier
matter to give satisfaction than to do the business; so in the inquiring
of causes and reasons it is much easier to find out such causes as will
satisfy the mind of man and quiet objections, than such causes as will
direct him and give him light to new experiences and inventions. And
this did Celsus note wisely and truly, how that the causes which are in
use, and whereof the knowledges now received do consist, were in time
minors and subsequents to the knowledge of the particulars, out of which
they were induced and collected; and that it was not the light of those
causes which discovered particulars, but only the particulars being
first found, men did fall on glossing and discoursing of the causes;
which is the reason, why the learning that now is hath the curse of
barrenness, and is courtesan-like, for pleasure and not for fruit. Nay,
to compare it rightly, the strange fiction of the poets of the
transformation of Scylla, seemeth to be a lively emblem of this
philosophy and knowledge: a fair woman upward in the parts of show, but
when you come to the parts of use and generation, barking monsters: for
no better are the endless distorted questions, which ever have been, and
of necessity must be, the end and womb of such knowledge. . . . . .</p>
<p>But yet nevertheless, here I may be mistaken, by reason of some which
have much in their pen the referring sciences to action and the use of
man, which mean quite another matter than I do. For they mean a
contriving of directions, and precepts for readiness of practice, which
I discommend not, so it be not occasion that some quantity of the
science be lost; for else it will be such a piece of husbandry, as to
put away a manor lying somewhat scattered, to buy in a close that lieth
handsomely about a dwelling. But my intention contrariwise is to
increase and multiply the revenues and possessions of man, and not to
trim up only, or order with conveniency the grounds whereof he is
already stated. Wherefore the better to make myself understood, that I
mean nothing less than words, and directly to demonstrate the point
which we are now upon, that is, what is the true end, scope, on office
of knowledge, which I have set down to consist not in any plausible,
delectable, reverend, or admired discourse, or any satisfactory
arguments, but in effecting and working, and in discovery of particulars
not revealed before, for the better endowment and help of man’s life; I
have thought good to make, as it were, a kalendar or inventory of the
wealth, furniture, or means of man, according to his present estate, as
far as it is known; which I do not to show any universality of sense or
knowledge, and much less to make a satire of reprehension in respect of
wants and errors, but partly because cogitations new had need of some
grossness and inculcation to make them perceived, and chiefly to the
end, that for the time to come, upon the account and state now made and
cast up, it may appear what increase this new manner of use and
administration of the stock, if it be once planted, shall bring with it
hereafter; and for the time present, in case I should be prevented by
death to propound and reveal this new light as I purpose, yet I may at
the least give some awaking note, both of the wants in man’s present
condition, and the nature of the supplies to be wished; though for mine
own part neither do I much build upon my present anticipations, neither
do I think ourselves yet learned or wise enough to wish reasonably: for
as it asks some knowledge to demand a question not impertinent; so it
asketh some sense to make a wish not absurd.</p>
<p>The Inventory, or an enumeration and view of inventions already
discovered in use, together with a note of the wants, and the nature of
the supplies.</p>
<p>Being the Xth chapter; and this a small fragment thereof, being the
preface to the Inventory.</p>
<p>The plainest method, and most directly pertinent to this intention,
will be to make distribution of sciences, arts, inventions, works, and
their portions, according to the use and tribute which they yield and
render to the conditions of man’s life, and under those several uses,
being as several offices of provisions, to charge and tax what may be
reasonably exacted or demanded, not guiding ourselves neither by the
poverty of experiences and probations, nor according to the vanity of
credulous imaginations; and then upon those charges and taxations to
distinguish and present, as it were, in several columns, what is extant
and already found, and what is defective and further to be provided. Of
which provisions, because in many of them, after the manner of slothful
and faulty officers and accomptants, it will be returned by way of
excuse, that no such are to be had, it will be fit to give some light of
the nature of the supplies, whereby it will evidently appear, that they
are to be compassed and procured. And yet nevertheless on the other side
again, it will be as fit to check and control the vain and void
assignations, and gifts, when by certain ignorant, extravagant, and
abusing wits have pretended to indue the state of man with wonders,
differing as much from truth in nature, as Cæsar’s Commentaries
differeth from the acts of King Arthur, or Huon of Bourdeaux in story.
For it is true that Cæsar did greater things than those idle wits had
the audacity to feign their supposed worthies to have done; but he did
them not in that monstrous and fabulous manner.</p>
<p>The chapter immediately following the Inventory.</p>
<p>Being the XIth in order, a part thereof.</p>
<p>It appeareth then, what is now in proposition, not by general
circumlocution, but by particular note, no former philosophy varied in
terms or method; no new placet or speculation upon particulars already
known; no referring to action by any manual of practice, but the
revealing and discovering of new inventions and operations. This to be
done without the errors and conjectures of art, or the length or
difficulties of experience; the nature and kinds of which inventions
have been described as they could be discovered; for your eye cannot
pass one kenning without further sailing: only we have stood upon the
best advantages of the notions received, as upon a mount, to show the
knowledges adjacent and confining. If therefore the true end of
knowledge not propounded, hath bred large error, the best and perfectest
condition of the same end, not perceived, will cause some declination.
For when the butt is set up, men need not rove, but except the white be
placed, men cannot level. This perfection we mean, not in the worth of
the effects, but in the nature of the direction; for our purpose is not
to stir up men’s hopes, but to guide their travels. The fulness of
direction to work, and produce any effect, consisteth in two conditions,
certainty and liberty. Certainty is, when the direction is not only true
for the most part, but infallible. Liberty is, when the direction is not
restrained to some definite means, but comprehendeth all the means and
ways possible: for the poet saith well, “Sapientibus undique latæ sunt
viæ;” and where there is the greatest plurality of change, there is the
greatest singularity of choice. Besides, as a conjectural direction
maketh a casual effect, so a particular and restrained direction is no
less casual than uncertain. For those particular means whereunto it is
tied may be out of your power, or may be accompanied with an overvalue
of prejudice; and so if for want of certainty in direction you are
frustrated in success, for want of variety in direction you are stopped
in the attempt. If therefore your direction be certain, it must refer
you, and point you to somewhat, which, if it be present, the effect you
seek will of necessity follow, else may yon perform and not obtain. If
it be free, then must it refer you to somewhat, which, if it be absent,
the effect you seek will of necessity withdraw, else may you have power
and not attempt. This notion Aristotle had in light, though not in use.
For the two commended rules by him set down, whereby the axioms of
sciences are precepted to be made convertible, and which the latter men
have not without elegancy surnamed, the one the rule of truth, because
it preventeth deceit, the other the rule of prudence, because it freeth
election, are the same thing in speculation and affirmation, which we
now observe. An example will make my meaning attained, and yet percase
make it thought that they attained it not.</p>
<p>Let the effect to be produced be whiteness; let the first direction
be, that if air and water be intermingled, or broken in small portions
together, whiteness will ensue, as in snow, in the breaking of the ways
of the sea and rivers, and the like. This direction is certain, but very
particular, and restrained, being tied but to air and water. Let the
second direction be, that if air be mingled as before with any
transparent body, such nevertheless as is uncoloured and more grossly
transparent than air itself, that then, andandandandc. as glass or
crystal, being beaten to fine powder, by the interposition of the air
becometh white; the white of an egg, being clear of itself, receiving
air by agitation, becometh white, receiving air by concoction becometh
white; here you are freed from water, and advanced to a clear body, and
still tied to air. Let the third direction exclude or remove the
restraint of an uncoloured body, as in amber, sapphires, andandandandc.
which beaten to fine powder, become, white in wine and beer; which
brought to froth, become white. Let the fourth direction exclude the
restraint of a body more grossly transparent than air, as in flame,
being a body compounded between air and a finer substance than air;
which flame if it were not for the smoke, which is the third substance
that incorporateth itself and dieth the flame would be more perfect
white. In all these four directions air still beareth a part. Let the
fifth direction then be, that if any bodies, both transparent, but in an
unequal degree, be mingled as before, whiteness will follow; as oil and
water beaten to an ointment, though by settling, the air which gathereth
in the agitation be evaporate, ye remaineth white; and the powder of
glass, or crystal, put into water, whereby the air giveth place, yet
remaineth white, though not so perfect. Now are you freed from air, but
still you are tied to transparent bodies. To ascend further by scale I
do forbear, partly because it would draw on the example to an over-great
length, but chiefly because it would open that which in this work
determine to reserve; for to pass through the whole history and
observation of colours and objects visible, were too long a digression;
and our purpose is now to give an example of a free direction, theieby
to distinguish and describe it; and not to set down a form of
interpretation how to recover and attain it. But as we intend not now to
reveal, so we are circumspect not to mislead; and therefore, this
warning being given, returning to our purpose in hand, we admit the
sixth direction to be, that all bodies, or parts of bodies, which are
unequal equally, that is, in a simple proportion, do represent
whiteness; we will explain this, though we induce it not. It is then to
be understood, that absolute equality produceth transparence, inequality
in simple order or proportion produceth whiteness, inequality in
compound or respective order or proportion prcduceth other colours, and
absolute or orderless inequality produceth blackness; which diversity if
so gross a demonstration be needful, may be signified by four tables; a
blank, a chequer, a fret, and a medley; whereof the fret is evident to
admit great variety. Out of this assertion are satisfied a multitude of
effects and observations, as that whiteness and blackness are most
incompatible with transparence; that whiteness keepeth light, and
blackness stoppeth light, but neither passeth it; that whiteness or
blackness are never produced in rainbows, diamonds, crystals, and the
like; that white giveth no dye, and black hardly taketh dye; that
whiteness seemeth to have an affinity with dryness, and blackness with
moisture; that adufition causeth blackness, and calcination whiteness;
that flowers are generally of fresh colours, and rarely black,
andandandandc., all which I do now mention confusedly by way of
derivation, and not by way of induction. This sixth direction, which I
have thus explained, is of good and competent liberty, for whiteness
fixed and inherent; but not for whiteness fantastical, or appearing, as
shall be afterwards touched. But first do you need a reduction back to
certainty or verity; for it is not all position or contexture of unequal
bodies that will produce colours; for aquafortis, oil of vitriol,
andandandandc. more manifestly, and many other substances more
obscurely, do consist of very unequal parts, which yet are transparent
and clear. Therefore the reduction must be, that the bodies or parts of
bodies so intermingled as before, be of a certain grossness or
magnitude; for the unequalities which move the sight must have a further
dimension and quantity than those which operate many other effects. Some
few grains of saffron will give a tincture to a tun of water, but so
many grains of civet will give a perfume to a whole chamber of air. And
therefore when Democritus, from whom Epicurus did borrow it, held that
the position of the solid portions was the cause of colours; yet in the
very truth of this assertion he should have added, that the portions are
required to be of some magnitude. And this is one cause why colours have
little inwardness and necessitude with the nature and proprieties of
things, those things resembling in colour, which otherwise differ most,
as salt and sugar: and contrariwise differing in colour, which otherwise
resemble most, as the white and blue violets, and the several veins of
one agate or marble, by reason that other virtues consist in more
subtile proportions than colours do; and yet are there virtues and
natures which require a grosser magnitude than colours, as well as
scents and divers other require a more subtile; for as the portion of a
body will give forth scent, which is too small to be seen; so the
portion of a body will show colours, which is too small to be endued
with weight: and therefore one of the prophets with great elegancy
describing how all creatures carry no proportion towards God the
creator, saith, “That all the nations in respect of him are like the
dust upon the balance;” which is a thing appeareth, but weigheth not.
But to return, there resteth a further freeing of this sixth direction:
for the clearness of a river or stream showeth white at a distance, and
crystalline glasses deliver the face or any other object falsified in
whiteness, and long beholding the snow to a weak eye giveth an
impression of azure, rather than of whiteness. So as for whiteness in
apparition only, and representation, by the qualifying of the light,
altering the intermedium, or affecting the eye itself, it reacheth not.
But you must free your direction to the producing of such an incidence,
impression, or operation, as may cause a precise and determinate passion
of the eye, a matter which is much more easy to induce than that which
we have passed through; but yet because it hath a full coherence both
with that act of radiation, which hath hitherto been conceived and
termed so unproperly and untruly, by some, an effluxion of spiritual
species, and by others, an investing of the intermedium, with a motion
which successively is conveyed to the eye, and with the act of sense,
wherein I should likewise open that which I think good to withdraw, I
will omit.</p>
<p>Neither do I contend, but that this notion, which I call the freeing
of a direction in the received philosophies, as far as a swimming
anticipation could take hold, might be perceived and discerned; being
not much other matter than that which they did not only aim at in the
two rules of axioms before remembered, but more nearly also than that
which they term the form or formal cause, or that which they call the
true difference; both which, nevertheless, it seemeth they propound
rather as impossibilities and wishes, than as things within the compass
of human comprehension: for Plato casteth his burden, and saith, “that
he will revere him as a God, that can truly divide and define:” which
cannot be but by true forms and differences, wherein I join hands with
him. confessing as much, as yet assuming to myself little; for if any
man can, by the strength of His anticipations, find out forms, I will
magnify him with the foremost. But as any of them would say, that if
divers things, which many men know by instruction and observation,
another knew by revelation, and without those means, they would take him
for somewhat supernatural and divine; so I do acknowledge that if any
man can by anticipations reach to that which a weak and inferior wit may
attain to by interpretation, he cannot receive too high a title. Nay, I
for my part do indeed admire to see how far some of them have proceeded
by their anticipations; but how? it is as I wonder at some blind men, to
see what shift they make without their eye-sight; thinking with myself
that if I were blind, I could hardly do it. Again, Aristotle’s school
confesseth, that there is no true knowledge but by causes, no true cause
but the form, no true form known except one, which they are pleased to
allow; and therefore thus far their evidence standeth with us, that both
hitherto there hath been nothing but a shadow of knowledge, and that we
propound now that which is agreed to be worthiest to be sought, and
hardest to be found. There wanteth now a part very necessary, not by way
of supply, but by way of caution: for as it is seen for the most part,
that the outward tokens and badge of excellency and perfection are more
incident to things merely counterfeit, than to that which is true, but
for a meaner and baser sort: as a dubline is more like a perfect ruby
than a spinel, and a counterfeit angel is made more like a true angel,
than if it were an angel coined of China gold; in like manner, the
direction carrieth a resemblance of a true direction in verity and
liberty, which indeed is no direction at all. For though your direction
seem to be certain and free, by pointing you to nature that is
unseparable from the nature you inquire upon; yet if it do not carry you
on a degree or remove nearer to action, operation, or light, to make or
produce, it is but superficial and counterfeit. Wherefore to secure and
warrant what is a true direction, though that general note I have given
be perspicuous in itself, for a man shall soon cast with himself,
whether he be ever the near to effect and operate or no, or whether he
have won but an abstract or varied notion, yet for better instruction I
will deliver three particular notes of caution. The first is, that the
nature discovered be more original than the nature supposed, and not
more secondary or of the like degree; as to make a stone bright, or to
make it smooth, it is a good direction to say make it even; but to make
a stone even, it is no good direction to say, make it bright, or make it
smooth; for the rule is, that the disposition of any thing referring to
the state of it in itself, of the parts, is more original than that
which is relative or transitive towards another thing. So evenness is
the disposition of the stone in itself, but smooth is to the hand, and
bright to the eye, and yet nevertheless they all cluster and concur; and
yet the direction is more unperfect, if it do appoint you to such a
relative, as is in the same kind, and not in a diverse. For in the
direction, to produce brightness by smoothness, although properly it win
no degree, and will never teach you any new particulars before unknown,
yet by way of suggestion, or bringing to mind, it may draw your
consideration to some particulars known but not remembered; as you shall
sooner remember some practical means of making smoothness, than if you
had fixed your consideration only upon brightness; but if the direction
had been to make brightness, by making reflection, as thus, make it such
as you may see your face in it; this is merely secondary, and helpeth
neither by way of informing, nor by way of suggesting. So if in the
inquiry of whiteness you were directed to make such a colour as should
be seen furthest in a dark light; here you are advanced nothing at all.
For these kinds of natures are but proprieties, effects, circumstances,
concurrences, or what else you shall like to call them, and not radical
and formative natures towards the nature supposed. The second caution
is, that the nature inquired be collected by division before
composition, or to speak more properly, by composition subaltern, before
you ascend to composition absolute, andandandandc.</p>
<p>Of the internal and profound errors and superstitions in the nature
of the mind, and of the four sorts of idols or fictions which offer
themselves to the understanding in the inquisition of knowledge.</p>
<p>Being the XVIth chapter, and this a small fragment thereof, being a
preface to the inward elenches of the mind.</p>
<p>The opinion of Epicurus, that the gods were of human shape, was
rather justly derided than seriously confuted by the other sects,
demanding whether every kind of sensible creature did not think their
own figure fairest, as the horse, the bull, and the like, which found no
beauty but in their own forms, as in appetite of lust appeared. And the
heresy of the Anthropomorphites was ever censured for a gross conceit,
bred in the obscure cells of solitary monks that never looked abroad.

custom and familiarity. The reflection also from glasses so usually
resembled to the imagery of the mind, every man knoweth to receive error
and variety both in colour, magnitude, and shape, according to the
quality of the glass. But yet no use hath been made of these and many
the like observations to move men to search out, and upon search to give
true cautions of the native and inherent errors in the mind of man,
which have coloured and corrupted all his notions and impressions.</p>
<p>I do find therefore in this enchanted glass four idols, or false
appearances of several and distinct sorts, every sort comprehending many
subdivisions: the first sort, I call idols of the nation or tribe; the
second, idols of the palace; the third, idols of the cave; and the
fourth, idols of the theatre, andandandandc.</p>

the Interpretation of Nature.</p>
