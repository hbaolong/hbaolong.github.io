<ol type="1">
<li><p>There remaineth the fourth kind of rational knowledge, which is
transitive, concerning the expressing or transferring our knowledge to
others, which I will term by the general name of tradition or delivery.
Tradition hath three parts: the first concerning the organ of tradition;
the second concerning the method of tradition; and the third concerning
the illustration of tradition.</p></li>
<li><p>For the organ of tradition, it is either speech or writing; for
Aristotle saith well, “Words are the images of cogitations, and letters
are the images of words.” But yet it is not of necessity that
cogitations be expressed by the medium of words. For whatsoever is
capable of sufficient differences, and those perceptible by the sense,
is in nature competent to express cogitations. And, therefore, we see in
the commerce of barbarous people that understand not one another’s
language, and in the practice of divers that are dumb and deaf, that
men’s minds are expressed in gestures, though not exactly, yet to serve
the turn. And we understand further, that it is the use of China and the
kingdoms of the High Levant to write in characters real, which express
neither letters nor words in gross, but things or notions; insomuch as
countries and provinces which understand not one another’s language can
nevertheless read one another’s writings, because the characters are
accepted more generally than the languages do extend; and, therefore,
they have a vast multitude of characters, as many, I suppose, as radical
words.</p></li>
<li><p>These notes of cogitations are of two sorts: the one when the
note hath some similitude or congruity with the notion; the other ad
placitum, having force only by contract or acceptation. Of the former
sort are hieroglyphics and gestures. For as to hieroglyphics (things of
ancient use and embraced chiefly by the Egyptians, one of the most
ancient nations), they are but as continued impresses and emblems. And
as for gestures, they are as transitory hieroglyphics, and are to
hieroglyphics as words spoken are to words written, in that they abide
not; but they have evermore, as well as the other, an affinity with the
things signified. As Periander, being consulted with how to preserve a
tyranny newly usurped, bid the messenger attend and report what he saw
him do; and went into his garden and topped all the highest flowers,
signifying that it consisted in the cutting off and keeping low of the
nobility and grandees. Ad placitum, are the characters real before
mentioned, and words: although some have been willing by curious
inquiry, or rather by apt feigning, to have derived imposition of names
from reason and intendment; a speculation elegant, and, by reason it
searcheth into antiquity, reverent, but sparingly mixed with truth, and
of small fruit. This portion of knowledge touching the notes of things
and cogitations in general, I find not inquired, but deficient. And
although it may seem of no great use, considering that words and
writings by letters do far excel all the other ways; yet because this
part concerneth, as it were, the mint of knowledge (for words are the
tokens current and accepted for conceits, as moneys are for values, and
that it is fit men be not ignorant that moneys may be of another kind
than gold and silver), I thought good to propound it to better
inquiry.</p></li>
<li><p>Concerning speech and words, the consideration of them hath
produced the science of grammar. For man still striveth to reintegrate
himself in those benedictions, from which by his fault he hath been
deprived; and as he hath striven against the first general curse by the
invention of all other arts, so hath he sought to come forth of the
second general curse (which was the confusion of tongues) by the art of
grammar; whereof the use in a mother tongue is small, in a foreign
tongue more; but most in such foreign tongues as have ceased to be
vulgar tongues, and are turned only to learned tongues. The duty of it
is of two natures: the one popular, which is for the speedy and perfect
attaining languages, as well for intercourse of speech as for
understanding of authors; the other philosophical, examining the power
and nature of words, as they are the footsteps and prints of reason:
which kind of analogy between words and reason is handled sparsim,
brokenly though not entirely; and, therefore, I cannot report it
deficient, though I think it very worthy to be reduced into a science by
itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Unto grammar also belongeth, as an appendix, the consideration of
the accidents of words; which are measure, sound, and elevation or
accent, and the sweetness and harshness of them: whence hath issued some
curious observations in rhetoric, but chiefly poesy, as we consider it,
in respect of the verse and not of the argument. Wherein though men in
learned tongues do tie themselves to the ancient measures, yet in modern
languages it seemeth to me as free to make new measures of verses as of
dances; for a dance is a measured pace, as a verse is a measured speech.
In these things this sense is better judge than the art:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Coenae fercula nostrae</p>
<p>Mallem convivis quam placuisse cocis.”</p>
<p>And of the servile expressing antiquity in an unlike and an unfit
subject, it is well said, “Quod tempore antiquum videtur, id
incongruitate est maxime novum.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>For ciphers, they are commonly in letters or alphabets, but may
be in words. The kinds of ciphers (besides the simple ciphers, with
changes, and intermixtures of nulls and non-significants) are many,
according to the nature or rule of the infolding, wheel-ciphers,
key-ciphers, doubles, andandandandc. But the virtues of them, whereby
they are to be preferred, are three; that they be not laborious to write
and read; that they be impossible to decipher; and, in some cases, that
they be without suspicion. The highest degree whereof is to write omnia
per omnia; which is undoubtedly possible, with a proportion quintuple at
most of the writing infolding to the writing infolded, and no other
restraint whatsoever. This art of ciphering hath for relative an art of
deciphering, by supposition unprofitable, but, as things are, of great
use. For suppose that ciphers were well managed, there be multitudes of
them which exclude the decipherer. But in regard of the rawness and
unskilfulness of the hands through which they pass, the greatest matters
are many times carried in the weakest ciphers.</p></li>
<li><p>In the enumeration of these private and retired arts it may be
thought I seek to make a great muster-roll of sciences, naming them for
show and ostentation, and to little other purpose. But let those, which
are skilful in them, judge whether I bring them in only for appearance,
or whether in that which I speak of them (though in few words) there be
not some seed of proficience. And this must be remembered, that as there
be many of great account in their countries and provinces, which, when
they come up to the seat of the estate, are but of mean rank and
scarcely regarded; so these arts, being here placed with the principal
and supreme sciences, seem petty things: yet to such as have chosen them
to spend their labours and studies in them, they seem great
matters.</p></li>
