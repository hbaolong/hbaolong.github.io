<p>In like manner the investigation and discovery of the latent
configuration in bodies is a new thing, no less than the discovery of
the latent process and of the form. For as yet we are but lingering in
the outer courts of nature, nor are we preparing ourselves a way into
her inner chambers. Yet no one can endow a given body with a new nature,
or successfully and aptly transmute it into a new body, unless he has
attained a competent knowledge of the body so to be altered or
transformed. Otherwise he will run into methods which, if not useless,
are at any rate difficult and perverse and unsuitable to the nature of
the body on which he is operating. It is clear therefore that to this
also a way must be opened and laid out.</p>
<p>And it is true that upon the anatomy of organized bodies (as of man
and animals) some pains have been well bestowed and with good effect;
and a subtle thing it seems to be, and a good scrutiny of nature. Yet
this kind of anatomy is subject to sight and sense, and has place only
in organized bodies. And besides it is a thing obvious and easy, when
compared with the true anatomy of the latent configuration in bodies
which are thought to be of uniform structure, especially in things and
their parts that have a specific character, as iron, stone; and again in
parts of uniform structure in plants and animals, as the root, the leaf,
the flower, flesh, blood, and bones. But even in this kind, human
industry has not been altogether wanting; for this is the very thing
aimed at in the separation of bodies of uniform structure by means of
distillations and other modes of analysis; that the complex structure of
the compound may be made apparent by bringing together its several
homogeneous parts. And this is of use too, and conduces to the object we
are seeking, although too often fallacious in its results, because many
natures which are in fact newly brought out and superinduced by fire and
heat and other modes of solution are taken to be the effect of
separation merely, and to have subsisted in the compound before. And
after all, this is but a small part of the work of discovering the true
configuration in the compound body; which configuration is a thing far
more subtle and exact, and such as the operation of fire rather
confounds than brings out and makes distinct.</p>
<p>Therefore a separation and solution of bodies must be effected, not
by fire indeed, but by reasoning and true induction, with experiments to
aid; and by a comparison with other bodies, and a reduction to simple
natures and their forms, which meet and mix in the compound. In a word,
we must pass from Vulcan to Minerva if we intend to bring to light the
true textures and configurations of bodies on which all the occult and,
as they are called, specific properties and virtues in things depend,
and from which, too, the rule of every powerful alteration and
transformation is derived.</p>
<p>For example, we must inquire what amount of spirit there is in every
body, what of tangible essence; and of the spirit, whether it be copious
and turgid, or meager and scarce; whether it be fine or coarse, akin to
air or to fire, brisk or sluggish, weak or strong, progressive or
retrograde, interrupted or continuous, agreeing with external and
surrounding objects or disagreeing, etc. In like manner we must inquire
into the tangible essence (which admits of no fewer differences than the
spirit), into its coats, its fibers, its kinds of texture. Moreover, the
disposition of the spirit throughout the corporeal frame, with its
pores, passages, veins and cells, and the rudiments or first essays of
the organized body, falls under the same investigation. But on these
inquiries also, and I may say on all the discovery of the latent
configuration, a true and clear light is shed by the primary axioms
which entirely dispels darkness and subtlety.</p>
