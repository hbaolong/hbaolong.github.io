<p>Perseus, or War Explained of the Preparation and Conduct Necessary to
War</p>
<p>THE fable relates, that Perseus was despatched from the cast by
Pallas, to cut off Medusa’s head, who had committed great ravage upon
the people of the west; for this Medusa was so dire a monster as to turn
into stone all those who but looked upon her. She was a Gorgon, and the
only mortal one of the three, the other two being invulnerable. Perseus,
therefore, preparing himself for this grand enterprise, had presents
made him from three of the gods: Mercury gave him wings for his heels;
Pluto, a helmet; and Pallas, a shield and a mirror. But though he was
now so well equipped, he posted not directly to Medusa, but first turned
aside to the Greæ, who were half-sisters to the Gorgons. These Greæ were
gray-headed, and like old women from their birth, having among them all
three but one eye, and one tooth, which, as they had occasion to go out,
they each wore by turns, and laid them down again upon coming back. This
eye and this tooth they lent to Perseus, who now judging himself
sufficiently furnished, he, without farther stop, flies swiftly away to
Medusa, and finds her asleep. But not venturing his eyes, for fear she
should wake, he turned his head aside, and viewed her in Pallas’s
mirror; and thus directing his stroke, cut off her head; when
immediately, from the gushing blood, there darted Pegasus, winged.
Perseus now inserted Medusa’s head into Pallas’s shield, which thence
retained the faculty of astonishing and benumbing all who looked on
it.”</p>
<p>This fable seems invented to show the prudent method of choosing,
undertaking, and conducting a war; and, accordingly, lays down three
useful precepts about it, as if they were the precepts of Pallas.</p>
<p>(1.) The first is, that no prince should be over-solicitous to subdue
a neighbouring nation; for the method of enlarging an empire is very
different from that of increasing an estate. Regard is justly had to
contiguity, or adjacency, in private lands and possessions; but in the
extending of empire, the occasion, the facility, and advantage of a war,
are to be regarded instead of vicinity. It is certain that the Romans,
at the time they stretched but little beyond Liguria to the west, had by
their arms subdued the provinces as far as Mount Taurus to the east. And
thus Perseus readily undertook a very long expedition, even from the
east to the extremities of the west.</p>
<p>The second precept is, that the cause of the war be just and
honourable; for this adds alacrity both to the soldiers, and the people
who find the supplies; procures aids, alliances, and numerous other
conveniences. Now there is no cause of war more just and laudable, than
the suppressing of tyranny, by which a people are dispirited, benumbed,
or left without life and vigour, as at the sight of Medusa.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is prudently added, that as there were three of the
Gorgons, who represent war, Perseus singled her out for his expedition
that was mortal; which affords this precept, that such kind of wars
should be chose as may be brought to a conclusion, without pursuing vast
and infinite hopes.</p>
<p>Again, Perseus’s setting-out is extremely well adapted to his
undertaking, and in a manner commands success; he received despatch from
Mercury, secrecy from Pluto, and foresight from Pallas. It also contains
an excellent allegory, that the wings given him by Mercury were for his
heels, not for his shoulders; because expedition is not so much required
in the first preparations for war, as in the subsequent matters, that
administer to the first; for there is no error more frequent in war,
than, after brisk preparations, to halt for subsidiary forces and
effective supplies.</p>
<p>The allegory of Pluto’s helmet, rendering men invisible and secret,
is sufficiently evident of itself; but the mystery of the shield and the
mirror lies deeper, and denotes, that not only a prudent caution must be
had to defend, like the shield, but also such an address and penetration
as may discover the strength, the motions, the counsels, and designs of
the enemy; like the mirror of Pallas.</p>
<p>But though Perseus may now seem extremely well prepared, there still
remains the most important thing of all; before he enters upon the war,
he must of necessity consult the Greæ. These Greæ are treasons; half,
but degenerate sisters of the Gorgons; who are representatives of wars:
for wars are generous and noble; but treasons base and vile. The Greæ
are elegantly described as hoary-headed, and like old women from their
birth; on account of the perpetual cares, fears, and trepidations
attending traitors. Their force, also, before it breaks out into open
revolt, consists either in an eye or a tooth; for all faction, alienated
from a state, is both watchful and biting; and this eye and tooth are,
as it were, common to all the disaffected; because whatever they learn
and know is transmitted from one to another, as by the hands of faction.
And for the tooth, they all bite with the same; and clamour with one
throat; so that each of them singly expresses the multitude.</p>
<p>These Greæ, therefore, must be prevailed upon by Perseus to lend him
their eye and their tooth; the eye to give him indications, and make
discoveries; the tooth for sowing rumours, raising envy, and stirring up
the minds of the people. And when all these things are thus disposed and
prepared, then follows the action of the war.</p>
<p>He finds Medusa asleep; for whoever undertakes a war with prudence,
generally falls upon the enemy unprepared, and nearly in a state of
security; and here is the occasion for Pallas’s mirror: for it is common
enough, before the danger presents itself, to see exactly into the state
and posture of the enemy; but the principal use of the glass is, in the
very instant of danger, to discover the manner thereof, and prevent
consternation; which is the thing intended by Perseus’s turning his head
aside, and viewing the enemy in the glass.</p>
<p>Two effects here follow the conquest: 1. The darting forth of
Pegasus; which evidently denotes fame, that flies abroad, proclaiming
the victory far and near. 2. The bearing of Medusa’s head in the shield,
which is the greatest possible defence and safeguard; for one grand and
memorable enterprise, happily accomplished, bridles all the motions and
attempts of the enemy, stupifies disaffection, and quells
commotions.</p>
