<ol type="1">
<li><p>Leaving therefore divine philosophy or natural theology (not
divinity or inspired theology, which we reserve for the last of all as
the haven and sabbath of all man’s contemplations) we will now proceed
to natural philosophy. If then it be true that Democritus said, “That
the truth of nature lieth hid in certain deep mines and caves;” and if
it be true likewise that the alchemists do so much inculcate, that
Vulcan is a second nature, and imitateth that dexterously and
compendiously, which nature worketh by ambages and length of time, it
were good to divide natural philosophy into the mine and the furnace,
and to make two professions or occupations of natural philosophers —
some to be pioneers and some smiths; some to dig, and some to refine and
hammer. And surely I do best allow of a division of that kind, though in
more familiar and scholastical terms: namely, that these be the two
parts of natural philosophy — the inquisition of causes, and the
production of effects; speculative and operative; natural science, and
natural prudence. For as in civil matters there is a wisdom of
discourse, and a wisdom of direction; so is it in natural. And here I
will make a request, that for the latter (or at least for a part
thereof) I may revive and reintegrate the misapplied and abused name of
natural magic, which in the true sense is but natural wisdom, or natural
prudence; taken according to the ancient acception, purged from vanity
and superstition. Now although it be true, and I know it well, that
there is an intercourse between causes and effects, so as both these
knowledges, speculative and operative, have a great connection between
themselves; yet because all true and fruitful natural philosophy hath a
double scale or ladder, ascendent and descendent, ascending from
experiments to the invention of causes, and descending from causes to
the invention of new experiments; therefore I judge it most requisite
that these two parts be severally considered and handled.</p></li>
<li><p>Natural science or theory is divided into physic and metaphysic;
wherein I desire it may be conceived that I use the word metaphysic in a
differing sense from that that is received. And in like manner, I doubt
not but it will easily appear to men of judgment, that in this and other
particulars, wheresoever my conception and notion may differ from the
ancient, yet I am studious to keep the ancient terms. For hoping well to
deliver myself from mistaking, by the order and perspicuous expressing
of that I do propound, I am otherwise zealous and affectionate to recede
as little from antiquity, either in terms or opinions, as may stand with
truth and the proficience of knowledge. And herein I cannot a little
marvel at the philosopher Aristotle, that did proceed in such a spirit
of difference and contradiction towards all antiquity; undertaking not
only to frame new words of science at pleasure, but to confound and
extinguish all ancient wisdom; insomuch as he never nameth or mentioneth
an ancient author or opinion, but to confute and reprove; wherein for
glory, and drawing followers and disciples, he took the right course.
For certainly there cometh to pass, and hath place in human truth, that
which was noted and pronounced in the highest truth:— Veni in nomine
partis, nec recipits me; si quis venerit in nomine suo eum recipietis.
But in this divine aphorism (considering to whom it was applied, namely,
to antichrist, the highest deceiver), we may discern well that the
coming in a man’s own name, without regard of antiquity or paternity, is
no good sign of truth, although it be joined with the fortune and
success of an eum recipietis. But for this excellent person Aristotle, I
will think of him that he learned that humour of his scholar, with whom
it seemeth he did emulate; the one to conquer all opinions, as the other
to conquer all nations. Wherein, nevertheless, it may be, he may at some
men’s hands, that are of a bitter disposition, get a like title as his
scholar did:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Felix terrarum praedo, non utile mundo Editus exemplum,
andandandandc.”</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>“Felix doctrinae praedo.”</p>
<p>But to me, on the other side, that do desire as much as lieth in my
pen to ground a sociable intercourse between antiquity and proficience,
it seemeth best to keep way with antiquity usque ad aras; and,
therefore, to retain the ancient terms, though I sometimes alter the
uses and definitions, according to the moderate proceeding in civil
government; where, although there be some alteration, yet that holdeth
which Tacitus wisely noteth, eadem magistratuum vocabula.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>To return, therefore, to the use and acception of the term
metaphysic as I do now understand the word; it appeareth, by that which
hath been already said, that I intend philosophia prima, summary
philosophy and metaphysic, which heretofore have been confounded as one,
to be two distinct things. For the one I have made as a parent or common
ancestor to all knowledge; and the other I have now brought in as a
branch or descendant of natural science. It appeareth likewise that I
have assigned to summary philosophy the common principles and axioms
which are promiscuous and indifferent to several sciences; I have
assigned unto it likewise the inquiry touching the operation or the
relative and adventive characters of essences, as quantity, similitude,
diversity, possibility, and the rest, with this distinction and
provision; that they be handled as they have efficacy in nature, and not
logically. It appeareth likewise that natural theology, which heretofore
hath been handled confusedly with metaphysic, I have enclosed and
bounded by itself. It is therefore now a question what is left remaining
for metaphysic; wherein I may without prejudice preserve thus much of
the conceit of antiquity, that physic should contemplate that which is
inherent in matter, and therefore transitory; and metaphysic that which
is abstracted and fixed. And again, that physic should handle that which
supposeth in nature only a being and moving; and metaphysic should
handle that which supposeth further in nature a reason, understanding,
and platform. But the difference, perspicuously expressed, is most
familiar and sensible. For as we divided natural philosophy in general
into the inquiry of causes and productions of effects, so that part
which concerneth the inquiry of causes we do subdivide according to the
received and sound division of causes. The one part, which is physic,
inquireth and handleth the material and efficient causes; and the other,
which is metaphysic, handleth the formal and final causes.</p></li>
<li><p>Physic (taking it according to the derivation, and not according
to our idiom for medicine) is situate in a middle term or distance
between natural history and metaphysic. For natural history describeth
the variety of things; physic the causes, but variable or respective
causes; and metaphysic the fixed and constant causes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Limus ut hic durescit, et haec ut cera liquescit, Uno eodemque
igni.”</p>
<p>Fire is the cause of induration, but respective to clay; fire is the
cause of colliquation, but respective to wax. But fire is no constant
cause either of induration or colliquation; so then the physical causes
are but the efficient and the matter. Physic hath three parts, whereof
two respect nature united or collected, the third contemplateth nature
diffused or distributed. Nature is collected either into one entire
total, or else into the same principles or seeds. So as the first
doctrine is touching the contexture or configuration of things, as de
mundo, de universitate rerum. The second is the doctrine concerning the
principles or originals of things. The third is the doctrine concerning
all variety and particularity of things; whether it be of the differing
substances, or their differing qualities and natures; whereof there
needeth no enumeration, this part being but as a gloss or paraphrase
that attendeth upon the text of natural history. Of these three I cannot
report any as deficient. In what truth or perfection they are handled, I
make not now any judgment; but they are parts of knowledge not deserted
by the labour of man.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>For metaphysic, we have assigned unto it the inquiry of formal
and final causes; which assignation, as to the former of them, may seem
to be nugatory and void, because of the received and inveterate opinion,
that the inquisition of man is not competent to find out essential forms
or true differences; of which opinion we will take this hold, that the
invention of forms is of all other parts of knowledge the worthiest to
be sought, if it be possible to be found. As for the possibility, they
are ill discoverers that think there is no land, when they can see
nothing but sea. But it is manifest that Plato, in his opinion of ideas,
as one that had a wit of elevation situate as upon a cliff, did descry
that forms were the true object of knowledge; but lost the real fruit of
his opinion, by considering of forms as absolutely abstracted from
matter, and not confined and determined by matter; and so turning his
opinion upon theology, wherewith all his natural philosophy is infected.
But if any man shall keep a continual watchful and severe eye upon
action, operation, and the use of knowledge, he may advise and take
notice what are the forms, the disclosures whereof are fruitful and
important to the state of man. For as to the forms of substances (man
only except, of whom it is said, Formavit hominem de limo terrae, et
spiravit in faciem ejus spiraculum vitae, and not as of all other
creatures, Producant aquae, producat terra), the forms of substances I
say (as they are now by compounding and transplanting multiplied) are so
perplexed, as they are not to be inquired; no more than it were either
possible or to purpose to seek in gross the forms of those sounds which
make words, which by composition and transposition of letters are
infinite. But, on the other side, to inquire the form of those sounds or
voices which make simple letters is easily comprehensible; and being
known induceth and manifesteth the forms of all words, which consist and
are compounded of them. In the same manner to inquire the form of a
lion, of an oak, of gold; nay, of water, of air, is a vain pursuit; but
to inquire the forms of sense, of voluntary motion, of vegetation, of
colours, of gravity and levity, of density, of tenuity, of heat, of
cold, and all other natures and qualities, which, like an alphabet, are
not many, and of which the essences (upheld by matter) of all creatures
do consist; to inquire, I say, the true forms of these, is that part of
metaphysic which we now define of. Not but that physic doth make inquiry
and take consideration of the same natures; but how? Only as to the
material and efficient causes of them, and not as to the forms. For
example, if the cause of whiteness in snow or froth be inquired, and it
be rendered thus, that the subtle intermixture of air and water is the
cause, it is well rendered; but, nevertheless, is this the form of
whiteness? No; but it is the efficient, which is ever but vehiculum
formae. This part of metaphysic I do not find laboured and performed;
whereat I marvel not; because I hold it not possible to be invented by
that course of invention which hath been used; in regard that men (which
is the root of all error) have made too untimely a departure, and too
remote a recess from particulars.</p></li>
<li><p>But the use of this part of metaphysic, which I report as
deficient, is of the rest the most excellent in two respects: the one,
because it is the duty and virtue of all knowledge to abridge the
infinity of individual experience, as much as the conception of truth
will permit, and to remedy the complaint of vita brevis, ars longa;
which is performed by uniting the notions and conceptions of sciences.
For knowledges are as pyramids, whereof history is the basis. So of
natural philosophy, the basis is natural history; the stage next the
basis is physic; the stage next the vertical point is metaphysic. As for
the vertical point, opus quod operatur Deus a principio usque ad finem,
the summary law of nature, we know not whether man’s inquiry can attain
unto it. But these three be the true stages of knowledge, and are to
them that are depraved no better than the giants’ hills:—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam,</p>
<p>Scilicet atque Ossae frondsum involvere Olympum.”</p>
<p>But to those which refer all things to the glory of God, they are as
the three acclamations, Sante, sancte, sancte! holy in the description
or dilatation of His works; holy in the connection or concatenation of
them; and holy in the union of them in a perpetual and uniform law. And,
therefore, the speculation was excellent in Parmenides and Plato,
although but a speculation in them, that all things by scale did ascend
to unity. So then always that knowledge is worthiest which is charged
with least multiplicity, which appeareth to be metaphysic; as that which
considereth the simple forms or differences of things, which are few in
number, and the degrees and co-ordinations whereof make all this
variety. The second respect, which valueth and commendeth this part of
metaphysic, is that it doth enfranchise the power of man unto the
greatest liberty and possibility of works and effects. For physic
carrieth men in narrow and restrained ways, subject to many accidents
and impediments, imitating the ordinary flexuous courses of nature. But
latae undique sunt sapientibus viae; to sapience (which was anciently
defined to be rerum divinarum et humanarum scientia) there is ever a
choice of means. For physical causes give light to new invention in
simili materia. But whosoever knoweth any form, knoweth the utmost
possibility of superinducing that nature upon any variety of matter; and
so is less restrained in operation, either to the basis of the matter,
or the condition of the efficient; which kind of knowledge Solomon
likewise, though in a more divine sense, elegantly describeth: non
arctabuntur gressus tui, et currens non habebis offendiculum. The ways
of sapience are not much liable either to particularity or chance.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The second part of metaphysic is the inquiry of final causes, which
I am moved to report not as omitted, but as misplaced. And yet if it
were but a fault in order, I would not speak of it; for order is matter
of illustration, but pertaineth not to the substance of sciences. But
this misplacing hath caused a deficience, or at least a great
improficience in the sciences themselves. For the handling of final
causes, mixed with the rest in physical inquiries, hath intercepted the
severe and diligent inquiry of all real and physical causes, and given
men the occasion to stay upon these satisfactory and specious causes, to
the great arrest and prejudice of further discovery. For this I find
done not only by Plato, who ever anchoreth upon that shore, but by
Aristotle, Galen, and others which do usually likewise fall upon these
flats of discoursing causes. For to say that “the hairs of the eyelids
are for a quickset and fence about the sight;” or that “the firmness of
the skins and hides of living creatures is to defend them from the
extremities of heat or cold;” or that “the bones are for the columns or
beams, whereupon the frames of the bodies of living creatures are
built;” or that “the leaves of trees are for protecting of the fruit;”
or that “the clouds are for watering of the earth;” or that “the
solidness of the earth is for the station and mansion of living
creatures;” and the like, is well inquired and collected in metaphysic,
but in physic they are impertinent. Nay, they are, indeed, but remoras
and hindrances to stay and slug the ship from further sailing; and have
brought this to pass, that the search of the physical causes hath been
neglected and passed in silence. And, therefore, the natural philosophy
of Democritus and some others, who did not suppose a mind or reason in
the frame of things, but attributed the form thereof able to maintain
itself to infinite essays or proofs of Nature, which they term fortune,
seemeth to me (as far as I can judge by the recital and fragments which
remain unto us) in particularities of physical causes more real and
better inquired than that of Aristotle and Plato; whereof both
intermingled final causes, the one as a part of theology, and the other
as a part of logic, which were the favourite studies respectively of
both those persons; not because those final causes are not true and
worthy to be inquired, being kept within their own province, but because
their excursions into the limits of physical causes hath bred a vastness
and solitude in that tract. For otherwise, keeping their precincts and
borders, men are extremely deceived if they think there is an enmity or
repugnancy at all between them. For the cause rendered, that “the hairs
about the eyelids are for the safeguard of the sight,” doth not impugn
the cause rendered, that “pilosity is incident to orifices of moisture —
muscosi fontes, andandandandc.” Nor the cause rendered, that “the
firmness of hides is for the armour of the body against extremities of
heat or cold,” doth not impugn the cause rendered, that “contraction of
pores is incident to the outwardest parts, in regard of their adjacence
to foreign or unlike bodies;” and so of the rest, both causes being true
and compatible, the one declaring an intention, the other a consequence
only. Neither doth this call in question or derogate from Divine
Providence, but highly confirm and exalt it. For as in civil actions he
is the greater and deeper politique that can make other men the
instruments of his will and ends, and yet never acquaint them with his
purpose, so as they shall do it and yet not know what they do, than he
that imparteth his meaning to those he employeth; so is the wisdom of
God more admirable, when Nature intendeth one thing and Providence
draweth forth another, than if He had communicated to particular
creatures and motions the characters and impressions of His Providence.
And thus much for metaphysic; the latter part whereof I allow as extant,
but wish it confined to his proper place.</li>
