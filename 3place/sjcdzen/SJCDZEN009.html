<h4 id="旧约-传道书ecclesiastes-第-9-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
传道书(Ecclesiastes) – 第 9 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:1
我将这一切事放在心上，详细考究，就知道义人和智慧人，并他们的作为都在　神手中；或是爱，或是恨，都在他们的前面，人不能知道。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare
all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the
hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before
them.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:1 So I reflected on all this and concluded that the
righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no man
knows whether love or hate awaits him.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:1 For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it
that righteous men, wise men, and their deeds are in the hand of God.
Man does not know whether it will be love or hatred; anything awaits
him.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:2
凡临到众人的事都是一样：义人和恶人都遭遇一样的事；好人，洁净人和不洁净人，献祭的与不献祭的，也是一样。好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的如何，怕起誓的也如何。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to
the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to
the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not:
as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that
feareth an oath.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:2 All share a common destiny–the righteous and the
wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer
sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the
sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid
to take them.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:2 It is the same for all. There is one fate for the
righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the
unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not
sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so
is the one who is afraid to swear.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:3
在日光之下所行的一切事上，有一件祸患，就是众人所遭遇的都是一样，并且世人的心充满了恶。活着的时候心里狂妄，后来就归死人那里去了。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:3 This is an evil among all things that are done under
the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the
sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they
live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:3 This is the evil in everything that happens under the
sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are
full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and
afterward they join the dead.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun,
that there is one fate for all men. Furthermore, the hearts of the sons
of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their
lives. Afterwards they go to the dead.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:4
与一切活人相连的，那人还有指望，因为活着的狗比死了的狮子更强。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is
hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:4 Anyone who is among the living has hope –even a live
dog is better off than a dead lion!</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:4 For whoever is joined with all the living, there is
hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:5
活着的人知道必死，死了的人毫无所知，也不再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead
know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
of them is forgotten.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead
know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them
is forgotten.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:5 For the living know they will die; but the dead do
not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory
is forgotten.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:6
他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒，早都消灭了。在日光之下所行的一切事上，他们永不再有份了。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is
now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in any thing
that is done under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:6 Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long
since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that
happens under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:6 Indeed their love, their hate and their zeal have
already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is
done under the sun.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:7
你只管去欢欢喜喜吃你的饭，心中快乐喝你的酒，因为　神已经悦纳你的作为。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy
wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:7 Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine
with a joyful heart, for it is now that God favors what you do.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:7 Go then, eat your bread in happiness and drink your
wine with a cheerful heart; for God has already approved your works.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:8 你的衣服当时常洁白，你头上也不要缺少膏油。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head
lack no ointment.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:8 Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your
head with oil.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:8 Let your clothes be white all the time, and let not
oil be lacking on your head.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:9
在你一生虚空的年日，就是　神赐你在日光之下虚空的年日，当同你所爱的妻快活度日，因为那是你生前在日光之下劳碌的事上所得的份。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the
days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun,
all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in
thy labor which thou takest under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:9 Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the
days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun– all
your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome
labor under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:9 Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days
of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this
is your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under
the sun.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:10
凡你手所当作的事，要尽力去作，因为在你所必去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy
might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your
might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working
nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your
might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in
Sheol where you are going.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:11
我又转念：见日光之下，快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，智慧的未必得粮食，明哲的未必得资财，灵巧的未必得喜悦：所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is
not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of
skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:11 I have seen something else under the sun: The race
is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to
the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time
and chance happen to them all.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:11 I again saw under the sun that the race is not to
the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to
the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for
time and chance overtake them all.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:12
原来人也不知道自己的定期；鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中，也是如此。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes
that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth
suddenly upon them.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:12 Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As
fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men
are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:12 Moreover, man does not know his time: like fish
caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare, so the sons of
men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:13 我见日光之下有一样智慧，据我看乃是广大，</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it
seemed great unto me:</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:13 I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that
greatly impressed me:</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:13 Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun,
and it impressed me.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:14
就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，修筑营垒，将城围困。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and
there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great
bulwarks against it:</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:14 There was once a small city with only a few people
in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge
siegeworks against it.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:14 There was a small city with few men in it and a
great king came to it, surrounded it and constructed large siegeworks
against it.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:15
城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by
his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor
man.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:15 Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise,
and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor
man.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:15 But there was found in it a poor wise man and he
delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor
man.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:16
我就说，智慧胜过勇力；然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength:
nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not
heard.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:16 So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.“ But the
poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:16 So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.“ But
the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:17
宁可在安静之中听智慧人的言语，不听掌管愚昧人的喊声。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than
the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:17 The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded
than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:17 The words of the wise heard in quietness are better
than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 9:18 智慧胜过打仗的兵器，但一个罪人能败坏许多善事。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
destroyeth much good.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner
destroys much good.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one
sinner destroys much good.</p>
