<h4 id="旧约-传道书ecclesiastes-第-4-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
传道书(Ecclesiastes) – 第 4 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:1
我又转念，见日光之下所行的一切欺压。看哪，受欺压的流泪，且无人安慰；欺压他们的有势力，也无人安慰他们。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:1 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions
that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:1 Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was
taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed– and they
have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors– and they
have no comforter.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:1 Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression
which were being done under the sun. And behold I saw the tears of the
oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of
their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:2 因此，我赞叹那早已死的死人，胜过那还活着的活人。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead
more than the living which are yet alive.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:2 And I declared that the dead, who had already died,
are happier than the living, who are still alive.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:2 So I congratulated the dead who are already dead
more than the living who are still living.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:3
并且我以为那未曾生的，就是未见过日光之下恶事的，比这两等人更强。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:3 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet
been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:3 But better than both is he who has not yet been, who
has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:3 But better off than both of them is the one who has
never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under
the sun.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:4
我又见人为一切的劳碌和各样灵巧的工作就被邻舍嫉妒。这也是虚空，也是捕风。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:4 Again, I considered all travail, and every right
work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity
and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:4 And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring
from man’s envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing
after the wind.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:4 I have seen that every labor and every skill which
is done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbor. This
too is vanity and striving after wind.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:5 愚昧人抱着手，吃自己的肉；</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his
own flesh.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:5 The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:5 The fool folds his hands and consumes his own
flesh.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:6 满了一把，得享安静，强如满了两把，劳碌捕风。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:6 Better is a handful with quietness, than both the
hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:6 Better one handful with tranquillity than two
handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:6 One hand full of rest is better than two fists full
of labor and striving after wind.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:7 我又转念，见日光之下有一件虚空的事：</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:7 Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:7 Then I looked again at vanity under the sun.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:8
有人孤单无二，无子无兄，竟劳碌不息，眼目也不以钱财为足。他说：我劳劳碌碌，刻苦自己，不享福乐，到底是为谁呢？这也是虚空，是极重的劳苦。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea,
he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor;
neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do
I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a
sore travail.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:8 There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor
brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content
with his wealth. “For whom am I toiling,“ he asked, “and why am I
depriving myself of enjoyment?“ This too is meaningless– a miserable
business!</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:8 There was a certain man without a dependent, having
neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor.
Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked, “And
for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure?“ This too is
vanity and it is a grievous task.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:9 两个人总比一个人好，因为二人劳碌同得美好的果效。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:9 Two are better than one; because they have a good
reward for their labor.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:9 Two are better than one, because they have a good
return for their work:</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:9 Two are better than one because they have a good
return for their labor.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:10
若是跌倒，这人可以扶起他的同伴；若是孤身跌倒，没有别人扶起他来，这人就有祸了！</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow:
but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
help him up.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:10 If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But
pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:10 For if either of them falls, the one will lift up
his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to
lift him up.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:11 再者，二人同睡，就都暖和；一人独睡，怎能暖和呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but
how can one be warm alone?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:11 Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.
But how can one keep warm alone?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:11 Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep
warm, but how can one be warm alone?</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:12
有人攻胜孤身一人，若有二人便能敌挡他；三股合成的绳子不容易折断。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand
him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:12 Though one may be overpowered, two can defend
themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:12 And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can
resist him. A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:13 贫穷而有智慧的少年人，胜过年老不肯纳谏的愚昧王。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and
foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:13 Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish
king who no longer knows how to take warning.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:13 A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and
foolish king who no longer knows how to receive instruction.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:14
这人是从监牢中出来作王；在他国中，生来原是贫穷的。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also
he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:14 The youth may have come from prison to the kingship,
or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:14 For he has come out of prison to become king, even
though he was born poor in his kingdom.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:15
我见日光之下一切行动的活人，都随从那第二位，就是起来代替老王的少年人。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:15 I considered all the living which walk under the
sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:15 I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun
followed the youth, the king’s successor.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:15 I have seen all the living under the sun throng to
the side of the second lad who replaces him.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 4:16
他所治理的众人，就是他的百姓，多得无数。在他后来的人，尚且不喜悦他。这真是虚空，也是捕风。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:16 There is no end of all the people, even of all that
have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:16 There was no end to all the people who were before
them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This
too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 4:16 There is no end to all the people, to all who were
before them, and even the ones who will come later will not be happy
with him, for this too is vanity and striving after wind.</p>
