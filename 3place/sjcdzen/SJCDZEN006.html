<h4 id="旧约-传道书ecclesiastes-第-6-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
传道书(Ecclesiastes) – 第 6 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:1 我见日光之下有一宗祸患重压在人身上，</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and
it is common among men:</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:1 I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs
heavily on men:</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and
it is prevalent among men–</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:2
就是人蒙　神赐他资财、丰富、尊荣，以致他心里所愿的一样都不缺，只是　神使他不能吃用，反有外人来吃用。这是虚空，也是祸患。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and
honor, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it:
this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:2 God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor, so
that he lacks nothing his heart desires, but God does not enable him to
enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a
grievous evil.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:2 a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and
honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has
not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is
vanity and a severe affliction.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:3
人若生一百个儿子，活许多岁数，以致他的年日甚多，心里却不得满享福乐，又不得埋葬；据我说，那不到期而落的胎比他倒好。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:3 If a man beget a hundred children, and live many
years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled
with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely
birth is better than he.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:3 A man may have a hundred children and live many
years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his
prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn
child is better off than he.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many
years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good
things and he does not even have a proper burial, then I say, “Better
the miscarriage than he,</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:4 因为虚虚而来，暗暗而去，名字被黑暗遮蔽，</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in
darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:4 It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and
in darkness its name is shrouded.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:4 for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity;
and its name is covered in obscurity.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:5 并且没有见过天日，也毫无知觉，这胎比那人倒享安息。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any
thing: this hath more rest than the other.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:5 Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has
more rest than does that man–</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:5 “It never sees the sun and it never knows anything;
it is better off than he.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:6
那人虽然活千年，再活千年，却不享福，众人岂不都归一个地方去吗？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:6 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet
hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:6 even if he lives a thousand years twice over but
fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:6 “Even if the other man lives a thousand years twice
and does not enjoy good things–do not all go to one place?“</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:7 人的劳碌都为口腹，心里却不知足。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:7 All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the
appetite is not filled.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:7 All man’s efforts are for his mouth, yet his appetite
is never satisfied.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:7 All a man’s labor is for his mouth and yet the
appetite is not satisfied.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:8
这样看来，智慧人比愚昧人有什么长处呢？穷人在众人面前知道如何行，有什么长处呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath
the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:8 What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does
a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:8 For what advantage does the wise man have over the
fool? What advantage does the poor man have, knowing how to walk before
the living?</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:9
眼睛所看的，比心里妄想的倒好。这也是虚空，也是捕风。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of
the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:9 Better what the eye sees than the roving of the
appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:9 What the eyes see is better than what the soul
desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:10
先前所有的，早已起了名，并知道何为人，他也不能与那比自己力大的相争。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:10 That which hath been is named already, and it is
known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier
than he.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:10 Whatever exists has already been named, and what man
is has been known; no man can contend with one who is stronger than
he.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:10 Whatever exists has already been named, and it is
known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than
he is.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:11 加增虚浮的事既多，这与人有什么益处呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity,
what is man the better?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:11 The more the words, the less the meaning, and how
does that profit anyone?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:11 For there are many words which increase futility.
What then is the advantage to a man?</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 6:12
人一生虚度的日子，就如影儿经过；谁知道什么与他有益呢？谁能告诉他身后在日光之下有什么事呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 6:12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life,
all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can
tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 6:12 For who knows what is good for a man in life, during
the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can
tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 6:12 For who knows what is good for a man during his
lifetime, during the few years of his futile life? He will spend them
like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the
sun?</p>
