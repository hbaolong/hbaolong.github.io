我又见日光之下，在审判之处有奸恶，在公义之处也有奸恶。</p>

judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness,
that iniquity was there.</p>

of judgment–wickedness was there, in the place of justice–wickedness was
there.</p>

place of justice there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness
there is wickedness.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 3:17
我心里说：　神必审判义人和恶人，因为在那里，各样事务，一切工作，都有定时。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous
and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
every work.</p>

both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every
activity, a time for every deed.“</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 3:17 I said to myself, “God will judge both the
righteous man and the wicked man,“ for a time for every matter and for
every deed is there.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 3:18
我心里说：这乃为世人的缘故，是　神要试验他们，使他们觉得自己不过像兽一样。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the
sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
they themselves are beasts.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 3:18 I also thought, “As for men, God tests them so that
they may see that they are like the animals.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 3:18 I said to myself concerning the sons of men, “God
has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but
beasts.“</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 3:19
因为世人遭遇的，兽也遭遇，所遭遇的都是一样；这个怎样死，那个也怎样死，气息都是一样。人不能强于兽，都是虚空。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth
beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence
above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 3:19 Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same
fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same
breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is
meaningless.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 3:19 For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of
beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have
the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is
vanity.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 3:20 都归一处，都是出于尘土，也都归于尘土。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all
turn to dust again.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 3:20 All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to
dust all return.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 3:20 All go to the same place. All came from the dust
and all return to the dust.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 3:21 谁知道人的灵是往上升，兽的魂是下入地呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and
the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 3:21 Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if
the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?“</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 3:21 Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and
the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth?</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 3:22
故此，我见人莫强如在他经营的事上喜乐，因为这是他的份；他身后的事谁能使他回来得见呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 3:22 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better,
than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his
portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 3:22 So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than
to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see
what will happen after him?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 3:22 I have seen that nothing is better than that man
should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will
bring him to see what will occur after him?</p>
