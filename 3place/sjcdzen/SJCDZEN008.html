传道书(Ecclesiastes) – 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:1
谁如智慧人呢？谁知道事情的解释呢？人的智慧使他的脸发光，并使他脸上的暴气改变。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the
interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and
the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:1 Who is like the wise man? Who knows the
explanation of things? Wisdom brightens a man’s face and changes its
hard appearance.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:1 Who is like the wise man and who knows the
interpretation of a matter? A man’s wisdom illumines him and causes his
stern face to beam.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:2
我劝你遵守王的命令，既指　神起誓，理当如此。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:2 I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment,
and that in regard of the oath of God.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:2 Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took
an oath before God.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:2 I say, “Keep the command of the king because of
the oath before God.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:3
不要急躁离开王的面前，不要固执行恶，因为他凡事都随自己的心意而行。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in
an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:3 Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s
presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he
pleases.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:3 “Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not join
in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases.“</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:4 王的话本有权力，谁敢问他说：你作什么呢？</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and
who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:4 Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to
him, “What are you doing?“</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:4 Since the word of the king is authoritative, who
will say to him, “What are you doing?“</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:5
凡遵守命令的，必不经历祸患，智慧人的心，能辨明时候和定理（原文作“审判”。下节同）。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil
thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and
judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:5 Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm,
and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:5 He who keeps a royal command experiences no
trouble, for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:6
各样事务成就，都有时候和定理，因为人的苦难重压在他身上。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:6 Because to every purpose there is time and
judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:6 For there is a proper time and procedure for
every matter, though a man’s misery weighs heavily upon him.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:6 For there is a proper time and procedure for
every delight, though a man’s trouble is heavy upon him.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:7
他不知道将来的事，因为将来如何，谁能告诉他呢？</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who
can tell him when it shall be?</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:7 Since no man knows the future, who can tell him
what is to come?</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:7 If no one knows what will happen, who can tell
him when it will happen?</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:8
无人有权力掌管生命，将生命留住，也无人有权力掌管死期。这场争战，无人能免，邪恶也不能救那好行邪恶的人。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit
to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and
there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
those that are given to it.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:8 No man has power over the wind to contain it; so
no one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in
time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice
it.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:8 No man has authority to restrain the wind with
the wind, or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge
in the time of war, and evil will not deliver those who practice
it.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:9
这一切我都见过，也专心查考日光之下所作的一切事。有时这人管辖那人，令人受害。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto
every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man
ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:9 All this I saw, as I applied my mind to
everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over
others to his own hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:9 All this I have seen and applied my mind to
every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised
authority over another man to his hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:10
我见恶人埋葬，归入坟墓；又见行正直事的离开圣地，在城中被人忘记。这也是虚空。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and
gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city
where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:10 Then too, I saw the wicked buried–those who used
to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where
they did this. This too is meaningless.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:10 So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those
who used to go in and out from the holy place, and they are soon
forgotten in the city where they did thus. This too is
futility.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:11
因为断定罪名，不立刻施刑，所以世人满心作恶。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not
executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
in them to do evil.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:11 When the sentence for a crime is not quickly
carried out, the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:11 Because the sentence against an evil deed is
not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them
are given fully to do evil.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:12
罪人虽然作恶百次，倒享长久的年日。然而我准知道，敬畏　神的，就是在他面前敬畏的人，终久必得福乐。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:12 Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his
days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
that fear God, which fear before him:</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:12 Although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes
and still lives a long time, I know that it will go better with
God-fearing men, who are reverent before God.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:12 Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and
may lengthen his life, still I know that it will be well for those who
fear God, who fear Him openly.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:13
恶人却不得福乐，也不得长久的年日；这年日好像影儿，因他不敬畏　神。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:13 But it shall not be well with the wicked,
neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he
feareth not before God.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:13 Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will
not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a
shadow.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:13 But it will not be well for the evil man and he
will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear
God.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:14
世上有一件虚空的事，就是义人所遭遇的，反照恶人所行的；又有恶人所遭遇的，反照义人所行的。我说，这也是虚空。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth;
that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of
the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according
to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:14 There is something else meaningless that occurs
on earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men
who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is
meaningless.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:14 There is futility which is done on the earth,
that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the
deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it
happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is
futility.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:15
我就称赞快乐，原来人在日光之下，莫强如吃喝快乐，因为他在日光之下，　神赐他一生的年日，要从劳碌中时常享受所得的。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no
better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry:
for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which
God giveth him under the sun.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:15 So I commend the enjoyment of life, because
nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be
glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life
God has given him under the sun.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:15 So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing
good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry,
and this will stand by him in his toils throughout the days of his life
which God has given him under the sun.</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:16
我专心求智慧，要看世上所作的事。（有昼夜不睡觉，不合眼的。）</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to
see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:16 When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to
observe man’s labor on earth–his eyes not seeing sleep day or
night–</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:16 When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see
the task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never
sleep day or night),</p></li>
<li><p>〔CUV〕 传 8:17
我就看明　神一切的作为，知道人查不出日光之下所作的事；任凭他费多少力寻查，都查不出来，就是智慧人虽想知道，也是查不出来。</p></li>
<li><p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:17 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man
cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a
man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though
a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find
it.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:17 then I saw all that God has done. No one can
comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search
it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he
knows, he cannot really comprehend it.</p></li>
<li><p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:17 and I saw every work of God, I concluded that
man cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even
though man should seek laboriously, he will not discover; and though the
wise man should say, “I know,“ he cannot discover.</p></li>
