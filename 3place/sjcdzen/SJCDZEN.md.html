all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on
men!</p>

come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that
have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of
wisdom and knowledge.</p>

wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is
a chasing after the wind.</p>

传道书(Ecclesiastes) – 第 2 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:1
我心里说：来吧！我以喜乐试试你，你好享福。谁知，这也是虚空。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee
with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is
vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:1 I thought in my heart, “Come now, I will test you
with pleasure to find out what is good.“ But that also proved to be
meaningless.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:1 I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with
pleasure. So enjoy yourself.“ And behold, it too was futility.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:2 我指嬉笑说：这是狂妄；论喜乐说：有何功效呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:2 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What
doeth it?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:2 “Laughter,“ I said, “is foolish. And what does
pleasure accomplish?“</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:2 I said of laughter, “It is madness,“ and of
pleasure, “What does it accomplish?“</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:3
我心里察究，如何用酒使我肉体舒畅，我心却仍以智慧引导我；又如何持住愚昧，等我看明世人，在天下一生当行何事为美。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:3 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I
might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do
under the heaven all the days of their life.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:3 I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing
folly–my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was
worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their
lives.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:3 I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body
with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely, and how to take hold of
folly, until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do
under heaven the few years of their lives.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:4 我为自己动大工程，建造房屋，栽种葡萄园；</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:4 I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted
me vineyards:</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:4 I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself
and planted vineyards.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:4 I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself, I
planted vineyards for myself;</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:5 修造园囿，在其中栽种各样果木树；</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees
in them of all kind of fruits:</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:5 I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of
fruit trees in them.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:5 I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in
them all kinds of fruit trees;</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:6 挖造水池，用以浇灌嫩小的树木。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood
that bringeth forth trees:</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:6 I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing
trees.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:6 I made ponds of water for myself from which to
irrigate a forest of growing trees.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:7
我买了仆婢，也有生在家中的仆婢；又有许多牛群羊群，胜过以前在耶路撒冷众人所有的。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:7 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born
in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:7 I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves
who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than
anyone in Jerusalem before me.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:7 I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn
slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded
me in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:8
我又为自己积蓄金银和君王的财宝，并各省的财宝；又得唱歌的男女和世人所喜爱的物，并许多的妃嫔。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar
treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women
singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments,
and that of all sorts.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:8 I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the
treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a
harem as well–the delights of the heart of man.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:8 Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the
treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female
singers and the pleasures of men–many concubines.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:9
这样，我就日见昌盛，胜过以前在耶路撒冷的众人。我的智慧仍然存留。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were
before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:9 I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem
before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:9 Then I became great and increased more than all who
preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:10
凡我眼所求的，我没有留下不给他的；我心所乐的，我没有禁止不享受的；因我的心为我一切所劳碌的快乐，这就是我从劳碌中所得的份。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from
them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all
my labor: and this was my portion of all my labor.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused
my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was
the reward for all my labor.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:10 All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I
did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased
because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:11
后来，我察看我手所经营的一切事和我劳碌所成的功，谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had
wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was
vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the
sun.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:11 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and
what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing
after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:11 Thus I considered all my activities which my hands
had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity
and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:12
我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。在王以后而来的人还能作什么呢？也不过行早先所行的就是了。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness,
and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
which hath been already done.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:12 Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and
also madness and folly. What more can the king’s successor do than what
has already been done?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:12 So I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly;
for what will the man do who will come after the king except what has
already been done?</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:13 我便看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as
light excelleth darkness.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:13 I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as
light is better than darkness.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:13 And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels
darkness.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:14
智慧人的眼目光明（“光明”原文作“在他头上”）；愚昧人在黑暗里行。我却看明有一件事，这两等人都必遇见。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:14 The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool
walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event
happeneth to them all.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:14 The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool
walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate
overtakes them both.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:14 The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool
walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:15
我就心里说：愚昧人所遇见的，我也必遇见，我为何更有智慧呢？我心里说，这也是虚空。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the
fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:15 Then I thought in my heart, “The fate of the fool
will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?“ I said in my
heart, “This too is meaningless.“</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:15 Then I said to myself, “As is the fate of the fool,
it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?“ So I said
to myself, “This too is vanity.“</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:16
智慧人和愚昧人一样，永远无人记念，因为日后都被忘记；可叹智慧人死亡，与愚昧人无异。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of
the fool forever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all
be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:16 For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long
remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the
wise man too must die!</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:16 For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man
as with the fool, inasmuch as in the coming days all will be forgotten.
And how the wise man and the fool alike die!</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:17
我所以恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所行的事，我都以为烦恼，都是虚空，都是捕风。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is
wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and
vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:17 So I hated life, because the work that is done under
the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after
the wind.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:17 So I hated life, for the work which had been done
under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and
striving after wind.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:18
我恨恶一切的劳碌，就是我在日光之下的劳碌，因为我得来的必留给我以后的人。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:18 Yea, I hated all my labor which I had taken under
the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after
me.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:18 I hated all the things I had toiled for under the
sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.</p>

had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come
after me.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:19
那人是智慧，是愚昧，谁能知道？他竟要管理我劳碌所得的，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。这也是虚空。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a
fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored,
and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This is also
vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:19 And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a
fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have
poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:19 And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a
fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which
I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:20
故此，我转想我在日光之下所劳碌的一切工作，心便绝望。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair
of all the labor which I took under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:20 So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome
labor under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:20 Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit
of my labor for which I had labored under the sun.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:21
因为有人用智慧、知识、灵巧所劳碌得来的，却要留给未曾劳碌的人为份。这也是虚空，也是大患。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:21 For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in
knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not labored therein
shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great
evil.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:21 For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and
skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked
for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:21 When there is a man who has labored with wisdom,
knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored
with them. This too is vanity and a great evil.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:22
人在日光之下劳碌累心，在他一切的劳碌上得着什么呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:22 For what hath man of all his labor, and of the
vexation of his heart, wherein he hath labored under the sun?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:22 What does a man get for all the toil and anxious
striving with which he labors under the sun?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:22 For what does a man get in all his labor and in his
striving with which he labors under the sun?</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:23
因为他日日忧虑，他的劳苦成为愁烦，连夜间心也不安。这也是虚空。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:23 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief;
yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:23 All his days his work is pain and grief; even at
night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:23 Because all his days his task is painful and
grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:24
人莫强如吃喝，且在劳碌中享福，我看这也是出于　神的手。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:24 There is nothing better for a man, than that he
should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul good in his
labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:24 A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink
and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of
God,</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:24 There is nothing better for a man than to eat and
drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen
that it is from the hand of God.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:25 论到吃用、享福，谁能胜过我呢？</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto,
more than I?</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:25 for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:25 For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without
Him?</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 2:26
　神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧、知识和喜乐，惟有罪人，　神使他劳苦，叫他将所收聚的、所堆积的归给　神所喜悦的人。这也是虚空，也是捕风。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 2:26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight
wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God.
This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 2:26 To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom,
knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of
gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases
God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 2:26 For to a person who is good in His sight He has
given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the
task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good
in God’s sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind.</p>

above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 3:19 Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same
fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same
breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is
meaningless.</p>

beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have

vanity.</p>

than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his
portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>

to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see
what will happen after him?</p>

work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity

from man’s envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing

<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 4:8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea,
he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor;
neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do
I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a
sore travail.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 4:8 There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor
brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content
with his wealth. “For whom am I toiling,“ he asked, “and why am I
depriving myself of enjoyment?“ This too is meaningless– a miserable
business!</p>

vanity and it is a grievous task.</p>

his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to
lift him up.</p>

have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:4 Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him,
“What are you doing?“</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:4 Since the word of the king is authoritative, who

<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to
retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there
is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that
are given to it.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:8 No man has power over the wind to contain it; so no
one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in time
of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:8 No man has authority to restrain the wind with the
wind, or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in

<p>〔CUV〕 传 8:9
这一切我都见过，也专心查考日光之下所作的一切事。有时这人管辖那人，令人受害。</p>

work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth
over another to his own hurt.</p>

done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to

deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised
authority over another man to his hurt.</p>

我见恶人埋葬，归入坟墓；又见行正直事的离开圣地，在城中被人忘记。这也是虚空。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and
gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city
where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:10 Then too, I saw the wicked buried–those who used to
come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where
they did this. This too is meaningless.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:10 So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who
used to go in and out from the holy place, and they are soon forgotten
in the city where they did thus. This too is futility.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 8:11 因为断定罪名，不立刻施刑，所以世人满心作恶。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not
executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
in them to do evil.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:11 When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried
out, the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:11 Because the sentence against an evil deed is not
executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are
given fully to do evil.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 8:12
罪人虽然作恶百次，倒享长久的年日。然而我准知道，敬畏　神的，就是在他面前敬畏的人，终久必得福乐。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:12 Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his
days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
that fear God, which fear before him:</p>

still lives a long time, I know that it will go better with God-fearing
men, who are reverent before God.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:12 Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and may
lengthen his life, still I know that it will be well for those who fear

shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not
before God.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:13 Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not
go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:13 But it will not be well for the evil man and he
will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear
God.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 8:14
世上有一件虚空的事，就是义人所遭遇的，反照恶人所行的；又有恶人所遭遇的，反照义人所行的。我说，这也是虚空。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that
there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the
wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to
the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:14 There is something else meaningless that occurs on
earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who
get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:14 There is futility which is done on the earth, that
is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of
the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens
according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is
futility.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 8:15
我就称赞快乐，原来人在日光之下，莫强如吃喝快乐，因为他在日光之下，　神赐他一生的年日，要从劳碌中时常享受所得的。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better
thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God
giveth him under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:15 So I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing
is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad.
Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has
given him under the sun.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:15 So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good
for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry, and
this will stand by him in his toils throughout the days of his life
which God has given him under the sun.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 8:16
我专心求智慧，要看世上所作的事。（有昼夜不睡觉，不合眼的。）</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see
the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:16 When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe
man’s labor on earth–his eyes not seeing sleep day or night–</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:16 When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the
task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never
sleep day or night),</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 8:17
我就看明　神一切的作为，知道人查不出日光之下所作的事；任凭他费多少力寻查，都查不出来，就是智慧人虽想知道，也是查不出来。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 8:17 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot
find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labor
to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man
think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 8:17 then I saw all that God has done. No one can
comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search
it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he
knows, he cannot really comprehend it.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 8:17 and I saw every work of God, I concluded that man
cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even though
man should seek laboriously, he will not discover; and though the wise
man should say, “I know,“ he cannot discover.</p>

all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the
hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before
them.</p>

righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no man
knows whether love or hate awaits him.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 9:1 For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it
that righteous men, wise men, and their deeds are in the hand of God.
Man does not know whether it will be love or hatred; anything awaits

凡临到众人的事都是一样：义人和恶人都遭遇一样的事；好人，洁净人和不洁净人，献祭的与不献祭的，也是一样。好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的如何，怕起誓的也如何。</p>

wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer

sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid
to take them.</p>

sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so
is the one who is afraid to swear.</p>

人活多年，就当快乐多年；然而也当想到黑暗的日子。因为这日子必多，所要来的都是虚空。</p>

all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many.
All that cometh is vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 11:8 However many years a man may live, let him enjoy
them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be
many. Everything to come is meaningless.</p>

<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 11:9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy
heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these
things God will bring thee into judgment.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 11:9 Be happy, young man, while you are young, and let
your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of
your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these
things God will bring you to judgment.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 11:9 Rejoice, young man, during your childhood, and let
your heart be pleasant during the days of young manhood. And follow the
impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes. Yet know that God
will bring you to judgment for all these things.</p>
<p>〔CUV〕 传 11:10
所以你当从心中除掉愁烦，从肉体克去邪恶，因为一生的开端和幼年之时，都是虚空的。</p>
<p>〔KJV〕 Ecc 11:10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put
away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</p>
<p>〔NIV〕 Ecc 11:10 So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast
off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.</p>
<p>〔NASB〕 Ecc 11:10 So, remove grief and anger from your heart and put
away pain from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are
fleeting.</p>
