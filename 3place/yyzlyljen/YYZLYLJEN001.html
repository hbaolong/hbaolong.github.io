<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>IN THE TEN YEARS that have passed since Language, Truth and Logic was
first published, I have come to see that the questions with which it
deals are not in all respects so simple as it makes them appear; but I
still believe that the point of view which it expresses is substantially
correct. Being in every sense a young man’s book, it was written with
more passion than most philosophers allow themselves to show, at any
rate in their published work, and while this probably helped to secure
it a larger audience than it might have had otherwise, I think now that
much of its argument would have been more persuasive if it had not been
presented in so harsh a form. It would, however, be very difficult for
me to alter the tone of the book without extensively re-writing it, and
the fact that, for reasons not wholly dependent upon its merits, it has
achieved something of the status of a text-book is, I hope, a sufficient
justification for reprinting it as it stands. At the same time, there
are a number of points that seem to me to call for some further
explanation, and I shall accordingly devote the remainder of this new
introduction to commenting briefly upon them.</p>
<p>THE PRINCIPLE OF VERIFICATION</p>
<p>The principle of verification is supposed to furnish a criterion by
which it can be determined whether or not a sentence is literally
meaningful. A simple way to formulate it would be to say that a sentence
had literal meaning if and only if the proposition it expressed was
either analytic or empirically verifiable. To this, however, it might be
objected that unless a sentence was literally meaningful it would not
express a proposition;1 for it is commonly assumed that every
proposition is either true or false, and to say that a sentence
expressed what was either true or false would entail saying that it was
literally meaningful. Accordingly, if the principle of verification were
formulated in this way, it might be argued not only that it was
incomplete as a criterion of meaning, since it would not cover the case
of sentences which did not express any propositions at all, but also
that it was otiose, on the ground that the question which it was
designed to answer must already have been answered before the principle
could be applied. It will be seen that when I introduce the principle in
this book I try to avoid this difficulty by speaking of “putative
propositions” and of the proposition which a sentence “purports to
express”; but this device is not satisfactory. For, in the first place,
the use of words like “putative” and “purports” seems to bring in
psychological considerations into which I do not wish to enter, and
secondly, in the case where the “putative proposition” is neither
analytic nor empirically verifiable, there would, according to this way
of speaking, appear to be nothing that the sentence in question could
properly be said to express. But if a sentence expresses nothing there
seems to be a contradiction in saying that what it expresses is
empirically unverifiable; for even if the sentence is adjudged on this
ground to be meaningless, the reference to “what it expresses” appears
still to imply that something is expressed.</p>
<p>This is, however, no more than a terminological difficulty, and there
are various ways in which it might be met. One of them would be to make
the criterion of verifiability apply directly to sentences, and so
eliminate the reference to propositions altogether. This would, indeed,
run counter to ordinary usage, since one would not normally say of a
sentence, as opposed to a proposition, that it was capable of being
verified, or, for that matter, that it was either true or false; but it
might be argued that such a departure from ordinary usage was justified,
if it could be shown to have some practical advantage. The fact is,
however, that the practical advantage seems to lie on the other side.
For while it is true that the use of the word “proposition” does not
enable us to say anything that we could not, in principle, say without
it, it does fulfil an important function; for it makes it possible to
express what is valid not merely for a particular sentence s but for any
sentence to which s is logically equivalent. Thus, if I assert, for
example, that the proposition p is entailed by the proposition q I am
indeed claiming implicitly that the English sentence s which expresses p
can be validly derived from the English sentence r which expresses q,
but this is not the whole of my claim. For, if I am right, it will also
follow that any sentence, whether of the English or any other language,
that is equivalent to s can be validly derived, in the language in
question, from any sentence that is equivalent to r; and it is this that
my use of the word “proposition” indicates. Admittedly, we could decide
to use the word “sentence” in the way in which we now use the word
“proposition,” but this would not be conducive to clarity, particularly
as the word “sentence” is already ambiguous. Thus, in a case of
repetition, it can be said either that there are two different sentences
or that the same sentence has been formulated twice. It is in the latter
sense that I have so far been using the word, but the other usage is
equally legitimate. In either usage, a sentence which was expressed in
English would be accounted a different sentence from its French
equivalent, but this would not hold good for the new usage of the word
“sentence” that we should be introducing if we substituted “sentence”
for “proposition.” For in that case we should have to say that the
English expression and its French equivalent were different formulations
of the same sentence. We might indeed be justified in increasing the
ambiguity of the word “sentence” in this way if we thereby avoided any
of the difficulties that have been thought to be attached to the use of
the word “proposition”; but I do not think that this is to be achieved
by the mere substitution of one verbal token for another. Accordingly, I
conclude that this technical use of the word “sentence,” though
legitimate in itself, would be likely to promote confusion, without
securing us any compensatory advantage.</p>
<p>A second way of meeting our original difficulty would be to extend
the use of the word “proposition,” so that anything that could properly
be called a sentence would be said to express a proposition, whether or
not the sentence was literally meaningful. This course would have the
advantage of simplicity, but it is open to two objections. The first is
that it would involve a departure from current philosophical usage; and
the second is that it would oblige us to give up the rule that every
proposition is to be accounted either true or false. For while, if we
adopted this new usage, we should still be able to say that anything
that was either true or false was a proposition, the converse would no
longer hold good; for a proposition would be neither true nor false if
it was expressed by a sentence which was literally meaningless. I do not
myself think that these objections are very serious, but they are
perhaps sufficiently so to make it advisable to solve our terminological
problem in some other way.</p>
<p>The solution that I prefer is to introduce a new technical term; and
for this purpose I shall make use of the familiar word “statement,”
though I shall perhaps be using it in a slightly unfamiliar sense. Thus
I propose that any form of words that is grammatically significant shall
be held to constitute a sentence, and that every indicative sentence,
whether it is literally meaningful or not, shall be regarded as
expressing a statement. Furthermore, any two sentences which are
mutually translatable will be said to express the same statement. The
word “proposition,” on the other hand, will be reserved for what is
expressed by sentences which are literally meaningful. Thus, the class
of propositions becomes, in this usage, a sub-class of the class of
statements, and one way of describing the use of the principle of
verification would be to say that it provided a means of determining
when an indicative sentence expressed a proposition, or, in other words,
of distinguishing the statements that belonged to the class of
propositions from those that did not.</p>
<p>It should be remarked that this decision to say that sentences
express statements involves nothing more than the adoption of a verbal
convention; and the proof of this is that the question, “What do
sentences express?” to which it provides an answer is not a factual
question. To ask of any particular sentence what it is that it expresses
may, indeed, be to put a factual question; and one way of answering it
would be to produce another sentence which was a translation of the
first. But if the general question, “What do sentences express?” is to
be interpreted factually, all that can be said in answer is that, since
it is not the case that all sentences are equivalent, there is not any
one thing that they all express. At the same time, it is useful to have
a means of referring indefinitely to “what sentences express” in cases
where the sentences themselves are not particularly specified; and this
purpose is served by the introduction of the word “statement” as a
technical term. Accordingly, in saying that sentences express
statements, we are indicating how this technical term is to be
understood, but we are not thereby conveying any factual information in
the sense in which we should be conveying factual information if the
question we were answering was empirical. This may, indeed, seem a point
too obvious to be worth making; but the question, “What do sentences
express?” is closely analogous to the question, “What do sentences
mean?” and, as I have tried to show elsewhere,2 the question, “What do
sentences mean?” has been a source of confusion to philosophers because
they have mistakenly thought it to be factual. To say that indicative
sentences mean propositions is indeed legitimate, just as it is
legitimate to say that they express statements. But what we are doing,
in giving answers of this kind, is to lay down conventional definitions;
and it is important that these conventional definitions should not be
confused with statements of empirical fact.</p>
<p>Returning now to the principle of verification, we may, for the sake
of brevity, apply it directly to statements rather than to the sentences
which express them, and we can then reformulate it by saying that a
statement is held to be literally meaningful if and only if it is either
analytic or empirically verifiable. But what is to be understood in this
context by the term “verifiable”? I do indeed attempt to answer this
question in the first chapter of this book; but I have to acknowledge
that my answer is not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>To begin with, it will be seen that I distinguish between a “strong”
and a “weak” sense of the term “verifiable,” and that I explain this
distinction by saying that “a proposition is said to be verifiable in
the strong sense of the term, if and only if its truth could be
conclusively established in experience,” but that “it is verifiable, in
the weak sense, if it is possible for experience to render it probable.”
And I then give reasons for deciding that it is only the weak sense of
the term that is required by my principle of verification. What I seem,
however, to have overlooked is that, as I represent them, these are not
two genuine alternatives.3 For I subsequently go on to argue that all
empirical propositions are hypotheses which are continually subject to
the test of further experience; and from this it would follow not merely
that the truth of any such proposition never was conclusively
established but that it never could be; for however strong the evidence
in its favour, there would never be a point at which it was impossible
for further experience to go against it. But this would mean that my
“strong” sense of the term “verifiable” had no possible application, and
in that case there was no need for me to qualify the other sense of
“verifiable” as weak; for on my own showing it was the only sense in
which any proposition could conceivably be verified.</p>
<p>If I do not now draw this conclusion, it is because I have come to
think that there is a class of empirical propositions of which it is
permissible to say that they can be verified conclusively. It is
characteristic of these propositions, which I have elsewhere4 called
“basic propositions,” that they refer solely to the content of a single
experience, and what may be said to verify them conclusively is the
occurrence of the experience to which they uniquely refer. Furthermore,
I should now agree with those who say that propositions of this kind are
“incorrigible,” assuming that what is meant by their being incorrigible
is that it is impossible to be mistaken about them except in a verbal
sense. In a verbal sense, indeed, it is always possible to misdescribe
one’s experience; but if one intends to do no more than record what is
experienced without relating it to anything else, it is not possible to
be factually mistaken; and the reason for this is that one is making no
claim that any further fact could confute. It is, in short, a case of
“nothing venture, nothing lose.” It is, however, equally a case of
“nothing venture, nothing win,” since the mere recording of one’s
present experience does not serve to convey any information either to
any other person or indeed to oneself; for in knowing a basic
proposition to be true one obtains no further knowledge than what is
already afforded by the occurrence of the relevant experience.
Admittedly, the form of words that is used to express a basic
proposition may be understood to express something that is informative
both to another person and to oneself, but when it is so understood it
no longer expresses a basic proposition. It was for this reason, indeed,
that I maintained, in the fifth chapter of this book, that there could
not be such things as basic propositions, in the sense in which I am now
using the term; for the burden of my argument was that no synthetic
proposition could be purely ostensive. My reasoning on this point was
not in itself incorrect, but I think that I mistook its purport. For I
seem not to have perceived that what I was really doing was to suggest a
motive for refusing to apply the term “proposition” to statements that
“directly recorded an immediate experience”; and this is a
terminological point which is not of any great importance.</p>
<p>Whether or not one chooses to include basic statements in the class
of empirical propositions, and so to admit that some empirical
propositions can be conclusively verified, it will remain true that the
vast majority of the propositions that people actually express are
neither themselves basic statements, nor deducible from any finite set
of basic statements. Consequently, if the principle of verification is
to be seriously considered as a criterion of meaning, it must be
interpreted in such a way as to admit statements that are not so
strongly verifiable as basic statements are supposed to be. But how then
is the word “verifiable” to be understood?</p>
<p>It will be seen that, in this book, I begin by suggesting that a
statement is “weakly” verifiable, and therefore meaningful, according to
my criterion, if “some possible sense-experience would be relevant to
the determination of its truth or falsehood.” But, as I recognize, this
itself requires interpretation; for the word “relevant” is uncomfortably
vague. Accordingly, I put forward a second version of my principle,
which I shall restate here in slightly different terms, using the phrase
“observation-statement,” in place of “experiential proposition,” to
designate a statement “which records an actual or possible observation.”
In this version, then, the principle is that a statement is verifiable,
and consequently meaningful, if some observation-statement can be
deduced from it in conjunction with certain other premises, without
being deducible from those other premises alone.</p>
<p>I say of this criterion that it “seems liberal enough,” but in fact
it is far too liberal, since it allows meaning to any statement
whatsoever. For, given any statement “S” and an observation-statement
“0,” “0” follows from “S” and “if S then 0” without following from “if S
then 0” alone. Thus, the statements ”the Absolute is lazy” and “if the
Absolute is lazy, this is white” jointly entail the
observation-statement “this is white,” and since “this is white” does
not follow from either of these premises, taken by itself, both. of them
satisfy my criterion of meaning. Furthermore, this would hold good for
any other piece of nonsense that one cared to put, as an example, in
place of “the Absolute is lazy,” provided only that it had the
grammatical form of an indicative sentence. But a criterion of meaning
that allows such latitude as this is evidently unacceptable.5</p>
<p>It may be remarked that the same objection applies to the proposal
that we should take the possibility of falsification as our criterion.
For, given any statement “S” and any observation-statement “0”, ”0” will
be incompatible with the conjunction of “S” and “if S then not 0.” We
could indeed avoid the difficulty, in either case, by leaving out the
stipulation about the other premises. But as this would involve the
exclusion of all hypotheticals from the class of empirical propositions,
we should escape from making our criteria too liberal only at the cost
of making them too stringent.</p>
<p>Another difficulty which I overlooked in my original attempt to
formulate the principle of verification is that most empirical
propositions are in some degree vague. Thus, as I have remarked
elsewhere,6 what is required to verify a statement about a material
thing is never the occurrence of precisely this or precisely that
sense-content, but only the occurrence of one or other of the
sense-contents that fall within a fairly indefinite range. We do indeed
test any such statement by making observations which consist in the
occurrence of particular sense-contents; but, for any test that we
actually carry out, there is always an indefinite number of other tests,
differing to some extent in respect either of their conditions or their
results, that would have served the same purpose. And this means that
there is never any set of observation-statements of which it can truly
be said that precisely they are entailed by any given statement about a
material thing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is only by the occurrence of some sense-content, and
consequently by the truth of some observation-statement, that any
statement about a material thing is actually verified; and from this it
follows that every significant statement about a material thing can be
represented as entailing a disjunction of observation-statements,
although the terms of this disjunction, being infinite, can not be
enumerated in detail. Consequently, I do not think that we need be
troubled by the difficulty about vagueness, so long as it is understood
that when we speak of the “entailment” of observation-statements, what
we are considering to be deducible from the premises in question is not
any particular observation-statement, but only one or other of a set of
such statements, where the defining characteristic of the set is that
all its members refer to sense-contents that fall within a certain
specifiable range.</p>
<p>There remains the more serious objection that my criterion, as it
stands, allows meaning to any indicative statement whatsoever. To meet
this, I shall emend it as follows. I propose to say that a statement is
directly verifiable if it is either itself an observation-statement, or
is such that in conjunction with one or more observation-statements it
entails at least one observation-statement which is not deducible from
these other premises alone; and I propose to say that a statement is
indirectly verifiable if it satisfies the following conditions: first,
that in conjunction with certain other premises it entails one or more
directly verifiable statements which are not deducible from these other
premises alone; and secondly, that these other premises do not include
any statement that is not either analytic, or directly verifiable, or
capable of being independently established as indirectly verifiable. And
I can now reformulate the principle of verification as requiring of a
literally meaningful statement, which is not analytic, that it should be
either directly or indirectly verifiable, in the foregoing sense.</p>
<p>It may be remarked that in giving my account of the conditions in
which a statement is to be considered indirectly verifiable, I have
explicitly put in the proviso that the “other premises” may include
analytic statements; and my reason for doing this is that I intend in
this way to allow for the case of scientific theories which are
expressed in terms that do not themselves designate anything observable.
For while the statements that contain these terms may not appear to
describe anything that anyone could ever observe, a “dictionary” may be
provided by means of which they can be transformed into statements that
are verifiable; and the statements which constitute the dictionary can
be regarded as analytic. Were this not so, there would be nothing to
choose between such scientific theories and those that I should dismiss
as metaphysical; but I take it to be characteristic of the
metaphysician, in my somewhat pejorative sense of the term, not only
that his statements do not describe anything that is capable, even in
principle, of being observed, but also that no dictionary is provided by
means of which they can be transformed into statements that are directly
or indirectly verifiable.</p>
<p>Metaphysical statements, in my sense of the term, are excluded also
by the older empiricist principle that no statement is literally
meaningful unless it describes what could be experienced, where the
criterion of what could be experienced is that it should be something of
the same kind as actually has been experienced.7 But, apart from its
lack of precision, this empiricist principle has, to my mind, the defect
of imposing too harsh a condition upon the form of scientific theories;
for it would seem to imply that it was illegitimate to introduce any
term that did not itself designate something observable. The principle
of verification, on the other hand, is, as I have tried to show, more
liberal in this respect, and in view of the use that is actually made of
scientific theories which the other would rule out, I think that the
more liberal criterion is to be preferred.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been assumed by my critics that I take the principle
of verification to imply that no statement can be evidence for another
unless it is a part of its meaning; but this is not the case. Thus, to
make use of a simple illustration, the statement that I have blood on my
coat may, in certain circumstances, confirm the hypothesis that I have
committed a murder, but it is not part of the meaning of the statement
that I have committed a murder that I should have blood upon my coat,
nor, as I understand it, does the principle of verification imply that
it is. For one statement may be evidence for another, and still neither
itself express a necessary condition of the truth of this other
statement, nor belong to any set of statements which determines a range
within which such a necessary condition falls; and it is only in these
cases that the principle of verification yields the conclusion that the
one statement is part of the meaning of the other. Thus, from the fact
that it is only by the making of some observation that any statement
about a material thing can be directly verified it follows, according to
the principle of verification, that every such statement contains some
observation-statement or other as part of its meaning, and it follows
also that, although its generality may prevent any finite set of
observation-statements from exhausting its meaning, it does not contain
anything as part of its meaning that cannot be represented as an
observation-statement; but there may still be many
observation-statements that are relevant to its truth or falsehood
without being part of its meaning at all. Again, a person who affirms
the existence of a deity may try to support his contention by appealing
to the facts of religious experience; but it does not follow from this
that the factual meaning of his statement is wholly contained in the
propositions by which these religious experiences are described. For
there may be other empirical facts that he would also consider to be
relevant; and it is possible that the descriptions of these other
empirical facts can more properly be regarded as containing the factual
meaning of his statement than the descriptions of the religious
experiences. At the same time, if one accepts the principle of
verification, one must hold that his statement does not have any other
factual meaning than what is contained in at least some of the relevant
empirical propositions; and that if it is so interpreted that no
possible experience could go to verify it, it does not have any factual
meaning at all.</p>
<p>In putting forward the principle of verification as a criterion of
meaning, I do not overlook the fact that the word “meaning” is commonly
used in a variety of senses, and I do not wish to deny that in some of
these senses a statement may properly be said to be meaningful even
though it is neither analytic nor empirically verifiable. I should,
however, claim that there was at least one proper use of the word
“meaning” in which it would be incorrect to say that a statement was
meaningful unless it satisfied the principle of verification; and I
have, perhaps tendentiously, used the expression “literal meaning” to
distinguish this use from the others, while applying the expression
“factual meaning” to the case of statements which satisfy my criterion
without being analytic. Furthermore, I suggest that it is only if it is
literally meaningful, in this sense, that a statement can properly be
said to be either true or false. Thus, while I wish the principle of
verification itself to be regarded, not as an empirical hypothesis,8 but
as a definition, it is not supposed to be entirely arbitrary. It is
indeed open to anyone to adopt a different criterion of meaning and so
to produce an alternative definition which may very well correspond to
one of the ways in which the word “meaning” is commonly used. And if a
statement satisfied such a criterion, there is, no doubt, some proper
use of the word “understanding” in which it would be capable of being
understood. Nevertheless, I think that, unless it satisfied the
principle of verification, it would not be capable of being understood
in the sense in which either scientific hypotheses or common-sense
statements are habitually understood. I confess, however, that it now
seems to me unlikely that any metaphysician would yield to a claim of
this kind; and although I should still defend the use of the criterion
of verifiability as a methodological principle, I realize that for the
effective elimination of metaphysics it needs to be supported by
detailed analyses of particular metaphysical arguments.</p>
<p>THE “A PRIORI”</p>
<p>In saying that the certainty of a priori propositions depends upon
the fact that they are tautologies, I use the word “tautology” in such a
way that a proposition can be said to be a tautology if it is analytic;
and I hold that a proposition is analytic if it is true solely in virtue
of the meaning of its constituent symbols, and cannot therefore be
either confirmed or refuted by any fact of experience. It has, indeed,
been suggested9 that my treatment of a priori propositions makes them
into a sub-class of empirical propositions. For I sometimes seem to
imply that they describe the way in which certain symbols are used, and
it is undoubtedly an empirical fact that people use symbols in the ways
that they do. This is not, however, the position that I wish to hold;
nor do I think that I am committed to it. For although I say that the
validity of a priori propositions depends upon certain facts about
verbal usage, I do not think that this is equivalent to saying that they
describe these facts in the sense in which empirical propositions may
describe the facts that verify them; and indeed I argue that they do
not, in this sense, describe any facts at all. At the same time I allow
that the usefulness of a priori propositions is founded both on the
empirical fact that certain symbols are used in the way that they are
and on the empirical fact that the symbols in question are successfully
applied to our experience; and I try in the fourth chapter of this book
to show how this is so.</p>
<p>Just as it is a mistake to identify a priori propositions with
empirical propositions about language, so I now think that it is a
mistake to say that they are themselves linguistic rules.10 For apart
from the fact that they can properly be said to be true, which
linguistic rules cannot, they are distinguished also by being necessary,
whereas linguistic rules are arbitrary. At the same time, if they are
necessary it is only because the relevant linguistic rules are
presupposed. Thus, it is a contingent, empirical fact that the word
“earlier” is used in English to mean earlier, and it is an arbitrary,
though convenient, rule of language that words that stand for temporal
relations are to be used transitively; but, given this rule, the
proposition that, if A is earlier than B and B is earlier than C, A is
earlier than C becomes a necessary truth. Similarly, in Russell’s and
Whitehead’s system of logic, it is a contingent, empirical fact that the
sign “ ɔ” should have been given the meaning that it has, and the rules
which govern the use of this sign are conventions, which themselves are
neither true nor false; but, given these rules the a priori proposition
“q. ɔ .p ɔ q” is necessarily true. Being a priori, this proposition
gives no information in the ordinary sense in which an empirical
proposition may be said to give information, nor does it itself
prescribe how the logical constant “ ɔ ” is to be used. What it does is
to elucidate the proper use of this logical constant; and it is in this
way that it is informative.</p>
<p>An argument which has been brought against the doctrine that a priori
propositions of the form “p entails q” are analytic is that it is
possible for one proposition to entail another without containing it as
part of its meaning; for it is assumed that this would not be possible
if the analytic view of entailment were correct.11 But the answer to
this is that the question whether one proposition is part of the meaning
of another is ambiguous. If you say, for example, as I think most of
those who raise this objection would, that q is not part of the meaning
of p if it is possible to understand p without thinking of q, then
clearly one proposition can entail another without containing it as part
of its meaning; for it can hardly be maintained that anyone who
considers a given set of propositions must be immediately conscious of
all that they entail. This is, however, to make a point with which I do
not think that any upholder of the analytic view of entailment would
wish to disagree; for it is common ground that deductive reasoning may
lead to conclusions which are new in the sense that one had not
previously apprehended them. But if this is admitted by those who say
that propositions of the form “p entails q” are analytic, how can they
also say that if p entails q the meaning of q is contained in that of p?
The answer is that they are using a criterion of meaning, whether the
verification principle or another, from which it follows that when one
proposition entails another the meaning of the second is contained in
that of the first. In other words, they determine the meaning of a
proposition by considering what it entails; and this is, to my mind, a
perfectly legitimate procedure.12 If this procedure is adopted the
proposition that, if p entails q, the meaning of q is contained in that
of p, itself becomes analytic; and it is therefore not to be refuted by
any such psychological facts as those on which the critics of this view
rely. At the same time, it may fairly be objected to it that it does not
give us much information about the nature of entailment; for although it
entitles us to say that the logical consequences of a proposition are
explicative of its meaning, this is only because the meaning of a
proposition is understood to depend upon what it entails.</p>
<p>PROPOSITIONS ABOUT THE PAST AND ABOUT OTHER MINDS</p>
<p>By saying of propositions about the past that they are “rules for the
prediction of those ‘historical’ experiences which are commonly said to
verify them” I seem to imply that they can somehow be translated into
propositions about present or future experiences. But this is certainly
incorrect. Statements about the past may be verifiable in the sense that
when they are conjoined with other premises of a suitable kind they may
entail observation-statements which do not follow from these other
premises alone; but I do not think that the truth of any
observation-statements which refer to the present or the future is a
necessary condition of the truth of any statement about the past. This
does not mean, however, that propositions referring to the past cannot
be analysed in phenomenal terms; for they can be taken as implying that
certain observations would have occurred if certain conditions had been
fulfilled. But the trouble is that these conditions never can be
fulfilled; for they require of the observer that he should occupy a
temporal position that ex hypothesi he does not. This difficulty,
however, is not a peculiarity of propositions about the past; for it is
true also of unfulfilled conditionals about the present that their
protases cannot in fact be satisfied, since they require of the observer
that he should be occupying a different spatial position from that which
he actually does. But, as I have remarked elsewhere,13 just as it is a
contingent fact that a person happens at a given moment to be occupying
a particular position in space, so is it a contingent fact that he
happens to be living at a particular time. And from this I conclude that
if one is justified in saying that events which are remote in space are
observable, in principle, the same may be said of events which are
situated in the past.</p>
<p>Concerning the experiences of others I confess that I am doubtful
whether the account that is given in this book is correct; but I am not
convinced that it is not. In another work, I have argued that, since it
is a contingent fact that any particular experience belongs to the
series of experiences which constitutes a given person, rather than to
another series which constitutes someone else, there is a sense in which
“it is not logically inconceivable that I should have an experience that
is in fact owned by someone else”; and from this I inferred that the use
of “the argument from analogy” might after all be justified.14 More
recently, however, I have come to think that this reasoning is very
dubious. For while it is possible to imagine circumstances in which we
might have found it convenient to say of two dif ferent persons that
they owned the same experience, the fact is that, according to our
present usage, it is a necessary proposition that they do not; and,
since this is so, I am afraid that the argument from analogy remains
open to the objections that are brought against it in this book.
Consequently, I am inclined to revert to a “behaviouristic”
interpretation of propositions about other people’s experiences. But I
own that it has an air of paradox which prevents me from being wholly
confident that it is true.15</p>
<p>THE EMOTIVE THEORY OF VALUES</p>
<p>The emotive theory of values, which is developed in the sixth chapter
of this book, has provoked a fair amount of criticism; but I find that
this criticism has been directed more often against the positivistic
principles on which the theory has been assumed to depend than against
the theory itself.16 Now I do not deny that in putting forward this
theory I was concerned with maintaining the general consistency of my
position; but it is not the only ethical theory that would have
satisfied this requirement, nor does it actually entail any of the
non-ethical statements which form the remainder of my argument.
Consequently, even if it could be shown that these other statements were
invalid, this would not in itself refute the emotive analysis of ethical
judgements; and in fact I believe this analysis to be valid on its own
account.</p>
<p>Having said this, I must acknowledge that the theory is here
presented in a very summary way, and that it needs to be supported by a
more detailed analysis of specimen ethical judgements than I make any
attempt to give.17 Thus, among other things, I fail to bring out the
point that the common objects of moral approval or disapproval are not
particular actions so much as classes of actions; by which I mean that
if an action is labelled right or wrong, or good or bad, as the case may
be, it is because it is thought to be an action of a certain type. And
this point seems to me important, because I think that what seems to be
an ethical judgement is very often a factual classification of an action
as belonging to some class of actions by which a certain moral attitude
on the part of the speaker is habitually aroused. Thus, a man who is a
convinced utilitarian may simply mean by calling an action right that it
tends to promote, or more probably that it is the sort of action that
tends to promote, the general happiness; and in that case the validity
of his statement becomes an empirical matter of fact. Similarly, a man
who bases his ethical upon his religious views may actually mean by
calling an action right or wrong that it is the sort of action that is
enjoined or forbidden by some ecclesiastical authority; and this also
may be empirically verified. Now in these cases the form of words by
which the factual statement is expressed is the same as that which would
be used to express a normative statement; and this may to some extent
explain why statements which are recognized to be normative are
nevertheless often thought to be factual. Moreover, a great many ethical
statements contain, as a factual element, some description of the
action, or the situation, to which the ethical term in question is being
applied. But although there may be a number of cases in which this
ethical term is itself to be understood descriptively, I do not think
that this is always so. I think that there are many statements in which
an ethical term is used in a purely normative way, and it is to
statements of this kind that the emotive theory of ethics is intended to
apply.</p>
<p>The objection that if the emotive theory was correct it would be
impossible for one person to contradict another on a question of value
is here met by the answer that what seem to be disputes about questions
of value are really disputes about questions of fact. I should, however,
have made it clear that it does not follow from this that two persons
cannot significantly disagree about a question of value, or that it is
idle for them to attempt to convince one another. For a consideration of
any dispute about a matter of taste will show that there can be
disagreement without formal contradiction, and that in order to alter
another man’s opinions, in the sense of getting him to change his
attitude, it is not necessary to contradict anything that he asserts.
Thus, if one wishes to affect another person in such a way as to bring
his sentiments on a given point into accordance with one’s own, there
are various ways in which one may proceed. One may, for example, call
his attention to certain facts that one supposes him to have overlooked;
and, as I have already remarked, I believe that much of what passes for
ethical discussion is a proceeding of this type. It is, however, also
possible to influence other people by a suitable choice of emotive
language; and this is the practical justification for the use of
normative expressions of value. At the same time, it must be admitted
that if the other person persists in maintaining his contrary attitude,
without however disputing any of the relevant facts, a point is reached
at which the discussion can go no further. And in that case there is no
sense in asking which of the conflicting views is true. For, since the
expression of a value judgement is not a proposition, the question of
truth or falsehood does not here arise.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS</p>
<p>In citing Bertrand Russell’s theory of descriptions as a specimen of
philosophical analysis, I unfortunately made a mistake in my exposition
of the theory. For, having taken the familiar example of “The author of
Waverley was Scotch,” I said that it was equivalent to “One person, and
one person only, wrote Waverley, and that person was Scotch.” But, as
Professor Stebbing pointed out in her review of this book, “if the word
‘that’ is used referentially, then ‘that person was Scotch’ is
equivalent to the whole of the original,” and if it is used
demonstratively, then the defining expression “is not a translation of
the original.”18 The version sometimes given by Russell himself19 is
that “The author of Waverley was Scotch” is equivalent to a conjunction
of the three propositions “At least one person wrote Waverley”; “At most
one person wrote Waverley”; and “Whoever wrote Waverley was Scotch.”
Professor Moore, however, has remarked20 that if the words “whoever
wrote Waverley” are understood “in the most natural way,” the first of
these propositions is superfluous; for he argues that part of what would
ordinarily be meant by saying that whoever wrote Waverley was Scotch is
that somebody did write Waverley. Accordingly, he suggests that the
proposition which Russell intended to express by the words “whoever
wrote Waverley was Scotch” is “one which can be expressed more clearly
by the words ‘There never was a person who wrote Waverley but was not
Scotch.’” And even so he does not think that the proposed translation is
correct. For he objects that to say of someone that he is the author of
a work does not entail saying that he wrote it, since if he had composed
it without actually writing it down he could still properly be called
its author. To this Russell has replied that it was “the inevitable
vagueness and ambiguity of any language used for every-day purposes”
that led him to use an artificial symbolic language in Principia
Mathematica, and that it is in the definitions given in Principia
Mathematica that the whole of his theory of descriptions consists;21 In
saying this, however, he is, I think, unjust to himself. For it seems to
me that one of the great merits of his theory of descriptions is that it
does throw light upon the use of a certain class of expressions in
ordinary speech, and that this is a point of philosophical importance.
For, by showing that expressions like “the present King of France” do
not function as names, the theory exposes the fallacy that has led
philosophers to believe in “subsistent entities.” Thus, while it is
unfortunate that the example most frequently chosen to illustrate the
theory should contain a minor inaccuracy, I do not think that this
seriously affects its value, even in its application to every-day
language. For, as I point out in this book, the object of analysing “The
author of Waverley was Scotch” is not just to obtain an accurate
translation of this particular sentence, but to elucidate the use of a
whole class of expressions, of which “the author of Waverley” serves
merely as a typical example.</p>
<p>A more serious mistake than my misrendering of “The author of
Waverley was Scotch” was my assumption that philosophical analysis
consisted mainly in the provision of “definitions in use.” It is,
indeed, true that what I describe as philosophical analysis is very
largely a matter of exhibiting the inter-relationship of different types
of propositions;22 but the cases in which this process actually yields a
set of definitions are the exception rather than the rule. Thus the
problem of showing how statements about material things are related to
observation-statements, which is, in effect, the traditional problem of
perception, might be thought to require for its solution that one should
indicate a method of translating statements about material things into
observation-statements, and thereby furnish what could be regarded as a
definition of a material thing. But, in fact, this is impossible; for,
as I have already remarked, no finite set of observation statements is
ever equivalent to a statement about a material thing. What one can do,
however, is to construct a schema which shows what sort of relations
must obtain between sense-contents for it to be true, in any given case,
that a material thing exists: and while this process cannot, properly
speaking, be said to yield a definition, it does have the effect of
showing how the one type of statement is related to the other.23
Similarly, in the field of political philosophy, one will probably not
be able to translate statements on the political level into statements
about individual persons; for although what is said about a State, for
example, is to be verified only by the behaviour of certain individuals,
such a statement is usually indefinite in a way that prevents any
particular set of statements about the behaviour of individuals from
being exactly equivalent to it. Nevertheless, here again it is possible
to indicate what types of relations must obtain between individual
persons for the political statements in question to be true: so that
even if no actual definitions are obtained, the meaning of the political
statements is appropriately clarified.</p>
<p>In such cases as these one does indeed arrive at something that
approaches a definition in use; but there are other cases of
philosophical analysis in which nothing even approaching a definition is
either provided or sought. Thus, when Professor Moore suggests that to
say that “existence is not a predicate” may be a way of saying that
“there is some very important difference between the way in which
‘exist’ is used in such a sentence as ‘Tame tigers exist’ and the way in
which ‘growl’ is used in ‘Tame tigers growl,’”he does not develop his
point by giving rules for the translation of one set of sentences into
another. What he does is to remark that whereas it makes good sense to
say “All tame tigers growl” or “Most tame tigers growl” it would be
nonsense to say “All tame tigers exist” or “Most tame tigers exist.”24
Now this may seem a rather trivial point for him to make, but in fact it
is philosophically illuminating. For it is precisely the assumption that
existence is a predicate that gives plausibility to “the ontological
argument”; and the ontological argument is supposed to demonstrate the
existence of a God. Consequently Moore by pointing out a peculiarity in
the use of the word “exist” helps to protect us from a serious fallacy;
so that his procedure, though different from that which Russell follows
in his theory of descriptions, tends to achieve the same philosophical
end.25</p>
<p>I maintain in this book that it is not within the province of
philosophy to justify our scientific or common-sense beliefs; for their
validity is an empirical matter, which cannot be settled by a priori
means. At the same time, the question of what constitutes such a
justification is philosophical, as the existence of “the problem of
induction” shows. Here again, what is required is not necessarily a
definition. For although I believe that the problems connected with
induction can be reduced to the question of what is meant by saying that
one proposition is good evidence for another, I doubt if the way to
answer this is to construct a formal definition of “evidence.” What is
chiefly wanted, I think, is an analysis of scientific method, and
although it might be possible to express the results of this analysis in
the form of definitions, this would not be an achievement of primary
importance. And here I may add that the reduction of philosophy to
analysis need not be incompatible with the view that its function is to
bring to light “the presuppositions of science.” For if there are such
presuppositions, they can no doubt be shown to be logically involved in
the applications of scientific method, or in the use of certain
scientific terms.</p>
<p>It used to be said by positivists of the Viennese school that the
function of philosophy was not to put forward a special set of
“philosophical” propositions, but to make other propositions clear; and
this statement has at least the merit of bringing out the point that
philosophy is not a source of speculative truth. Nevertheless I now
think that it is incorrect to say that there are no philosophical
propositions. For, whether they are true or false, the propositions that
are expressed in such a book as this do fall into a special category;
and since they are the sort of propositions that are asserted or denied
by philosophers, I do not see why they should not be called
philosophical. To say of them that they are, in some sense, about the
usage of words, is, I believe, correct but also inadequate; for
certainly not every statement about the usage of words is
philosophical.26 Thus, a lexicographer also seeks to give information
about the usage of words, but the philosopher, differs from him in being
concerned, as I have tried to indicate, not with the use of particular
expressions but with classes of expressions; and whereas the
propositions of the lexicographer are empirical, philosophical
propositions, if they are true, are usually analytic.27 For the rest I
can find no better way of explaining my conception of philosophy than by
referring to examples; and one such example is the argument of this
book.</p>
