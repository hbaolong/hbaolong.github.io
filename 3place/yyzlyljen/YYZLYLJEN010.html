VIII SOLUTIONS OF OUTSTANDING PHILOSOPHICAL DISPUTES</h4>
<p>ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTS of this treatise has been to show that there
is nothing in the nature of philosophy to warrant the existence of
conflicting philosophical parties or “schools.” For it is only when the
available evidence is insufficient to determine the probability of a
proposition that a difference of opinion concerning it is justifiable.
But with regard to the propositions of philosophy this can never be the
case. For, as we have seen, the function of the philosopher is not to
devise speculative theories which require to be validated in experience,
but to elicit the consequences of our linguistic usages. That is to say,
the questions with which philosophy is concerned are purely logical
questions; and although people do in fact dispute about logical
questions, such disputes are always unwarranted. For they involve either
the denial of a proposition which is necessarily true, or the assertion
of a proposition which is necessarily false. In all such cases,
therefore, we may be sure that one party to the dispute has been guilty
of a miscalculation which a sufficiently close scrutiny of the reasoning
will enable us to detect. So that if the dispute is not immediately
resolved, it is because the logical error of which one party is guilty
is too subtle to be easily detected, and not because the question at
issue is irresoluble on the available evidence.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we who are interested in the condition of philosophy can
no longer acquiesce in the existence of party divisions among
philosophers. For we know that if the questions about which the parties
contend are logical in character, they can be definitively answered.
And, if they are not logical, they must either be dismissed as
metaphysical, or made the subject of an empirical enquiry. I propose,
therefore, to examine in turn the three great issues concerning which
philosophers have differed in the past, to sort out the problems of
which these issues consist, and to provide for each problem a solution
appropriate to its nature. It will be found that some of these problems
have already been dealt with in the course of this book, and in such
cases we shall be content to recapitulate our solution without repeating
the argument on which it was founded.</p>
<p>The questions which we are now about to consider are those that lie
at issue between rationalists and empiricists, between realists and
idealists, and between monists and pluralists. In each case, we shall
find that the thesis which is maintained by one school and controverted
by another is partly logical, partly metaphysical, and partly empirical,
and that there is no strict logical connection between its constituent
parts; so that it is legitimate to accept some portions of it and reject
others. And, indeed, we do not claim that for anyone to be accounted a
member of a particular school it is necessary for him to adhere to all
the doctrines which we hold to be characteristic of the school, but
rather that it is sufficient if he adheres to any of them. It is
advisable for us to say this in order to protect ourselves against a
possible charge of historical inaccuracy. But it must be understood from
the outset that we are not concerned to vindicate any one set of
philosophers at the expense of any other, but simply to settle certain
questions which have played a part in the history of philosophy which is
out of all proportion to their difficulty or their importance. We shall
now begin with the questions which enter into the rationalist-empiricist
controversy.</p>
<p>RATIONALISM AND EMPIRICISM</p>
<p>The metaphysical doctrine which is upheld by rationalists, and
rejected by empiricists, is that there exists a supra-sensible world
which is the object of a purely intellectual intuition and is alone
wholly real. We have already dealt with this doctrine explicitly in the
course of our attack on metaphysics, and seen that it is not even false
but senseless. For no empirical observation could have the slightest
tendency to establish any conclusion concerning the properties, or even
the existence, of a supra-sensible world. And therefore we are entitled
to deny the possibility of such a world and to dismiss as nonsensical
the descriptions which have been given of it.</p>
<p>With the logical aspect of the rationalist-empiricist controversy we
have also dealt very fully, and pronounced, it will be remembered, in
favour of the empiricists. For we showed that a proposition only had
factual content if it was empirically verifiable, and, consequently,
that the rationalists were mistaken in supposing that there could be a
priori propositions which referred to matters of fact. At the same time
we disagreed with those empiricists who maintain that the distinction
which is ordinarily drawn between a priori propositions and empirical
propositions is an illegitimate distinction, and that all significant
propositions are empirical hypotheses, whose truth may be in the highest
degree probable but can never be certain. We admitted that there were
propositions which were necessarily valid apart from all experience, and
that there was a difference in kind between these propositions and
empirical hypotheses. But we did not account for their necessity by
saying, as a rationalist might, that they were speculative “truths of
reason.” We accounted for it by saying that they were tautologies. And
we showed that the fact that we sometimes make mistakes in our a priori
reasonings, and that even when we have not made any mistake we may
arrive at an interesting and unexpected conclusion, is in no way
incompatible with the fact that such reasonings are purely analytic. And
thus we found that our rejection of the logical thesis of rationalism,
and of all forms of metaphysics, did not oblige us to deny that there
could be necessary truths.</p>
<p>An explicit rejection of metaphysics, as distinct from a mere
abstention from metaphysical utterances, is characteristic of the type
of empiricism which is known as positivism. But we have found ourselves
unable to accept the criterion which the positivists employ to
distinguish a metaphysical utterance from a genuine synthetic
proposition. For they require of a synthetic proposition that it should,
in principle at least, be conclusively verifiable. And as, for reasons
which we have already given, no proposition is capable, even in
principle, of being verified conclusively, but only at best of being
rendered highly probable, the positivist criterion, so far from marking
the distinction between literal sense and nonsense, as it is intended to
do, makes every utterance nonsensical. And therefore, as we have seen,
it is necessary to adopt a weakened form of the positivist verification
principle, as a criterion of literal significance, and to allow a
proposition to be genuinely factual if any empirical observations would
be relevant to its truth or falsehood. So that an utterance is by us
accounted metaphysical only if it is neither a tautology nor yet capable
of being substantiated to any degree whatsoever by any possible
observation. In practice, indeed, very little of what is allowed to_ be
significant by this criterion would not be allowed also by the
positivists. But that is because they do not apply their own criterion
consistently.</p>
<p>It should be added that we dissent also from the positivist doctrine
with regard to the significance of particular symbols. For it is
characteristic of a positivist to hold that all symbols, other than
logical constants, must either themselves stand for sense-contents or
else be explicitly definable in terms of symbols which stand for
sense-contents. It is plain that such physical symbols as “atom” or
“molecule” or “electron” fail to satisfy this condition, and some
positivists, including Mach, have been prepared on this account to
regard the use of them as illegitimate.103 They would not have been so
ruthless if they had realised that they ought also, if they were to be
consistent in the application of their criterion, to have condemned the
use of symbols which stand for material things. For, as we have seen,
even such familiar symbols as “table” or “chair” or “coat” cannot be
defined explicitly in terms of symbols which stand for sense-contents,
but only in use. And, accordingly, we must allow that the employment of
a symbol is legitimate if it is possible, at any rate in principle, to
give a rule for translating the sentences in which it occurs into
sentences which refer to sense-contents—or, in other words, if it is
possible to indicate how the propositions which it helps to express may
be empirically substantiated. And this condition is as well satisfied by
the physical symbols which positivists have condemned as by the symbols
which stand for familiar material things.</p>
<p>Finally, it must again be emphasized that we are not committed by our
logical thesis to any of the factual doctrines which have been
propounded by empiricist authors. We have, indeed, already expressed our
dissent from the psychological atomism of Mach and Hume; and we may add
that, although we agree in the main with Hume’s epistemological views
concerning the validity of general propositions of law, we do not accept
his account of the way in which such propositions actually come to be
formulated. We do not hold, as he apparently did, that every general
hypothesis is, in fact, a generalization from a number of observed
instances. We agree with the rationalists that the process by which
scientific theories come into being is often deductive rather than
inductive. The scientist does not formulate his laws only as the result
of seeing them exemplified in particular cases. Sometimes he considers
the possibility of the law before he is in possession of the evidence
which justifies it. It “occurs” to him that a certain hypothesis or set
of hypotheses may be true. He employs deductive reasoning to discover
what he ought to experience in a given situation if the hypothesis is
true; and if he makes the required observations, or has reason to
believe that he could make them, he accepts the hypothesis. He does not,
as Hume implied, passively wait for nature to instruct him; rather, as
Kant saw, does he force nature to answer the questions which he puts to
her. So that there is a sense in which the rationalists are right in
asserting that the mind is active in knowledge. It is not true, indeed,
that the validity of a proposition is ever logically dependent upon the
mental attitude of anyone towards it, nor is it true that every physical
fact is either logically or causally dependent upon a mental fact, nor
yet that observation of a physical object necessarily causes any change
in it, although it may in fact do so in some cases. But it is true that
the activity of theorizing is, in its subjective aspect, a creative
activity, and that the psychological theories of empiricists concerning
“the origins of our knowledge” are vitiated by their failure to take
this into account.</p>
<p>But while it must be recognised that scientific laws are often
discovered through a process of intuition, this does not mean that they
can be intuitively validated. As we have said many times already, it is
essential to distinguish the psychological question, How does our
knowledge originate? from the logical question, How is it certified as
knowledge? Whatever may be the correct answers to these two questions,
it is clear that they are logically independent of one another. And,
accordingly, we can consistently allow that the psychological theories
of rationalists concerning the part played by intuition in the
acquisition of our knowledge are very probably true, while at the same
time we reject as self-contradictory their logical thesis that there are
synthetic propositions of whose validity we have an a priori
guarantee.</p>
<p>REALISM AND IDEALISM</p>
<p>Whereas the main points in the dispute between rationalists and
empiricists, of which we have now finally disposed, have been referred
to constantly throughout this book, comparatively little attention has
yet been paid to the realist-idealist controversy, which, to the
historian of modern philosophy at any rate, is almost equally important.
All that we have done so far in connection with it is to rule out its
metaphysical aspect, and to assert that the logical questions which it
involves are questions concerning the analysis of existential
propositions. We have seen that the dispute between idealists and
realists becomes a metaphysical dispute when it is assumed that the
question whether an object is real or ideal is an empirical question
which cannot be settled by any possible observation. We showed that in
the ordinary sense of the term “real,” the sense in which “being real”
is opposed to “being illusory,” there were definite empirical tests for
determining whether an object was real or not; but that those who,
agreeing that an object was real in this sense, went on to dispute
whether it had a completely undetectable property, which they called
also the property of being real, or an equally undetectable property of
being ideal, were debating an altogether fictitious question. And to
this we need not now add anything further, but may proceed at once to
consider the realist-idealist controversy in its logical aspect.</p>
<p>The logical doctrines which are maintained by idealists and
controverted by realists are all concerned with the question, What is
entailed by sentences of the form “x is real”? Thus, it is the
contention of Berkeleyan idealists that the sentence “x is real” or “x
exists,” where x stands for a thing and not for a person, is equivalent
to “x is perceived,” so that it is self-contradictory to assert that
anything exists unperceived; and they hold, furthermore, that “x is
perceived” entails “x is mental,” and so conclude that everything that
exists is mental. Both these propositions are denied by realists, who
maintain for their part that the concept of reality is unanalysable, so
that there is no sentence referring to perceptions which is equivalent
to the sentence “x is real.” In fact, we shall find that the realists
are right in what they deny, but wrong in what they affirm.</p>
<p>Briefly, the grounds on which Berkeley held that no material thing
could exist unperceived were these. He maintained, first, that a thing
was nothing more than the sum of its sensible qualities, and, secondly,
that it was self-contradictory to assert that a sensible quality existed
unsensed. And from these premises it does follow that a thing cannot
without self-contradiction be said to exist unperceived. But since he
recognized that the common-sense assumption that things did exist when
no human being was perceiving them was certainly not self-contradictory,
and, indeed, himself believed it to be true, Berkeley allowed that a
thing might exist unperceived by any human being, inasmuch as it could
still be perceived by God. And he appears to have regarded the fact that
he was obliged to rely on the perceptions of God to bring his doctrine
into harmony with the fact that things very probably do exist at times
when no human being is perceiving them as constituting a proof of the
existence of a personal god: whereas, in truth, what it proves is that
there is an error in Berkeley’s reasoning. For, since propositions which
assert the existence of material things have an undisputed factual
significance, it cannot be correct to analyse them in terms of such
metaphysical entities as the perceptions of a transcendent god.</p>
<p>We must now consider exactly where the error in Berkeley’s reasoning
lies. It is customary for realists to deny his proposition that a
sensible quality cannot possibly exist unsensed. Taking him, I think
rightly, to be using the terms “sensible quality” and “idea of
sensation,” as we have been using the term “sense-content,” to refer to
an entity which is sensibly given, they assert that he makes a faulty
analysis of sensation through failing to distinguish between the object
sensed and the act of consciousness which is directed upon it, and that
there is no contradiction involved in supposing that the object may
exist independently of the act.104 But I do not think that this
criticism is just. For these acts of sensing, which realists reproach
Berkeley for having ignored, appear to me to be completely inaccessible
to any observation. And I suggest that those who believe in them have
been misled by the grammatical fact that the sentences which they use to
describe their sensations contain a transitive verb, just as those who
believe that the self is given in sensation are misled by the fact that
the sentences which people use to describe their sensations contain a
grammatical subject: while what those who claim to detect the presence
of such acts of sensing in their visual and tactual experiences are, I
think, really detecting is the fact that their visual and tactual
sense-fields have the sensible property of depth.105 And, therefore,
although Berkeley made a psychological error in supposing that the
succession of “ideas” which constituted a person’s sense-history was
sensibly discrete, I believe that he was right to regard these “ideas”
as the contents rather than the objects of sensations, and consequently
that he was justified in asserting that a “sensible quality” could not
conceivably exist unsensed. Accordingly we may allow that his dictum,
“Esse est percipi,” is true with regard to sense-contents, for to speak
of the existence of sense-contents is, as we have seen, merely a
misleading way of speaking of their occurrence, and a sense-content
cannot without self-contradiction be said to occur except as part of a
sense-experience.</p>
<p>But although it is a fact that a sense-content cannot by definition
occur without being experienced, and that material things are
constituted by sense-contents, it is a mistake to conclude, as Berkeley
did, that a material thing cannot exist unperceived. And the mistake is
due to his misconception of the relationship between material things and
the sense-contents which constitute them. If a material thing were
really the sum of its “sensible qualities”—that is to say, an aggregate
of sense-contents, or even a whole composed of sense-contents—then it
would follow from the definitions of a material thing and a
sense-content that no thing could exist unperceived. But, in fact, we
have seen that sense-contents are not in any way parts of the material
things which they constitute; the sense in which a material thing is
reducible to sense-contents is simply that it is a logical construction
and they are its elements; and this, as we have previously made clear,
is a linguistic proposition which states that to say anything about it
is always equivalent to saying something about them. Moreover the
elements of any given material thing are not merely actual but also
possible sense-contents—that is to say, the sentences referring to
sense-contents, which are the translations of the sentences referring to
a material thing, need not necessarily express categorical propositions;
they may be hypothetical. And this explains how it is possible for a
material thing to exist throughout a period when none of its elements
are actually experienced: it is sufficient that they should be capable
of being experienced—that is, that there should be a hypothetical fact
to the effect that, if certain conditions were fulfilled, certain
sense-contents, belonging to the thing in question, would be
experienced. There is, indeed, no contradiction involved in asserting
the existence of a material thing which is never actually perceived. For
in asserting that the thing existed, one would be asserting only that
certain sense-contents would occur if a particular set of conditions
relating to the faculties and the position of an observer was fulfilled;
and such a hypothetical proposition may very well be true, even though
the relevant conditions never are fulfilled. And, as we shall show later
on, we may in some cases not merely have to recognise the existence of
an unperceived material thing as a logical possibility, but may actually
possess good inductive grounds for believing in it.</p>
<p>This analysis of propositions asserting the existence of material
things, which is in conformity with Mill’s conception of a material
thing as “a permanent possibility of sensation,” enables us not merely
to dispense with the perceptions of God, but also to allow that people
can be said to exist in the same sense as material things. It is, I
think, a serious defect in Berkeley’s theory that it does not allow
this. For, failing to give the phenomenalist account of the self which,
as Hume saw, his empiricism demanded, he found himself unable either to
hold that the existence of people consisted, like the existence of
material things, in their being perceived, or to put forward any other
analysis of it. We, on the contrary, maintain that a man must define his
own existence, and the existence of other people, no less than that of
material things, in terms of the hypothetical occurrence of
sense-contents. And I think we have succeeded in proving the necessity
of such a thoroughgoing phenomenalism, and in meeting the objections to
which it seems at first sight to be exposed.</p>
<p>The proposition that whatever is perceived is necessarily mental,
which forms the second stage in the argument of the Berkeleyan idealist,
rests on the assumption that the immediate data of sense are necessarily
mental, together with the assumption that a thing is literally the sum
of its “sensible qualities.” And these are both assumptions which we
have rejected. We have seen that a thing is to be defined, not as a
collection of sense-contents, but as a logical construction out of them.
And we have seen that the terms “mental” and “physical” apply only to
logical constructions, and not to the immediate data of sense
themselves. Sense-contents themselves cannot significantly be said
either to be or not to be mental. And while it is certainly significant
to assert that all the things which we ordinarily take to be unconscious
are really conscious, we shall find that this is a proposition which we
have very good reason to disbelieve.</p>
<p>I think that the idealist view that what is immediately given in
sense-experience must necessarily be mental derives historically from an
error of Descartes. For he, believing that he could deduce his own
existence from the existence of a mental entity, a thought, without
assuming the existence of any physical entity, concluded that his mind
was a substance which was wholly independent of anything physical; so
that it could directly experience only what belonged to itself. We have
already seen that the premise of this argument is false; and, in any
case, the conclusion does not follow from it. For, in the first place,
the assertion that the mind is a substance, being a metaphysical
assertion, cannot follow from anything. Secondly, if the term “thought”
is used, as Descartes apparently used it, to refer to a single
introspective sense-content, then a thought cannot, as in the ordinary
usage, properly be said to be mental. And, finally, even if it were true
that the existence of a conscious being could be validly deduced from an
isolated mental datum, it would not in the least follow that such a
being could not, in fact, stand in direct causal and epistemological
relations to material things. And, indeed, we have previously shown that
the proposition that mind and matter are completely independent is one
which we have good empirical grounds for disbelieving, and one which no
a priori argument could possibly serve to prove.</p>
<p>Although the responsibility for the view that it is possible to
experience directly only what is mental rests ultimately with Descartes,
subsequent philosophers have supported it with arguments of their own.
One of these is the so-called argument from illusion. This argument
proceeds from the fact that the sensible appearances of a material thing
vary with the point of view of the observer, or with his physical and
psychological condition, or with the nature of the attendant
circumstances such as the presence or absence of light. Each of these
appearances is, it is argued, in itself as “good” as any other, but,
since they are in many cases mutually incompatible, they cannot all
really characterize the material thing; and thence it is concluded that
none of them are “in the thing,” but that they are all “in the mind.”
But this conclusion is plainly unwarranted. All that this argument from
illusion proves is that the relationship of a sense-content to the
material thing to which it belongs is not that of part to whole. It does
not have the least tendency to show that any sense-content is “in the
mind.” Nor does the fact that a sense-content is partly dependent for
its quality on the psychological state of an observer in any way go to
prove that it is a mental entity itself.</p>
<p>Another argument of Berkeley’s is superficially more plausible. He
points out that sensations of all kinds are in some degree pleasant or
painful, and argues that, as the sensation is not phenomenally
distinguishable from the pleasure or the pain, the two must be
identified. But pleasure and pain, he thinks, are indubitably mental,
and so he concludes that the objects of sense are mental.106 The error
in this argument consists in the identification of pleasures and pains
with particular sense-contents. It is true that the word “pain” is
sometimes used to denote an organic sense-content, as in the sentence,
“I feel a pain in my shoulder,” but in this usage a pain cannot properly
be said to be mental; and it is noteworthy that there is no
corresponding usage of the word “pleasure.” And in the usage in which
pains and pleasures can properly be said to be mental, as in the
sentence, “Domitian took pleasure in torturing flies,” the terms denote,
not sense-contents, but logical constructions. For to refer to pains and
pleasures, in this usage, is a way of referring to people’s behaviour,
and so ultimately to sense-contents, which are themselves, as always,
neither mental nor physical.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of some idealists, who are not Berkeleyans, to
hold that “x is real,” where x stands for a thing and not for a person,
is equivalent to “x is thought of,” so that it is self-contradictory to
hold that anything exists unthought of, or that anything which is
thought of is unreal. In support of the first of these consequences, it
is argued that if I make any judgement whatsoever about a thing I must
necessarily be thinking of it. But while it is true that the sentence “I
judge that x exists” entails “x is thought of,” it does not follow from
this that it is self-contradictory to assert that anything unthought of
exists. For the sentence “I judge that x exists” is plainly not
equivalent to “x exists,” nor does it entail it, nor is it entailed by
it. I may very well judge that a thing exists which in fact does not
exist, and a thing may very well exist without my judging that it does,
or, indeed, without anybody’s judging that it does, or without anybody’s
ever thinking of it. It is true that the fact that I assert that a thing
exists shows that I am thinking of it, or have thought of it, but this
does not mean that part of what I assert when I say that a thing exists
is that I am thinking of it. It is essential here to distinguish between
that of which the occurrence of a sentence is in fact evidence, and that
which the sentence formally entails. Having made this distinction we can
see that there is no formal contradiction involved in asserting that
things which are unthought of exist.</p>
<p>The view that whatever is thought of must necessarily be real is not
confined to idealists. It depends, as Moore has shown,107 upon the
mistaken assumption that such a sentence as “Unicorns are thought of” is
of the same logical form as “Lions are killed.” “Lions are killed” does
indeed entail “lions are real”; and so it is supposed that “unicorns are
thought of” must analogously entail “unicorns are real.” But, in fact,
“being thought of” is not an attribute like “being killed,” and there
is, accordingly, no contradiction involved in asserting that such things
as unicorns, or centaurs, although they are thought of, do not actually
exist. The realist view that such imaginary objects “have real being,”
even though they do not exist, has already been shown to be
metaphysical, and need not be further discussed.</p>
<p>It may be added that even if it were true that “x is real” was
equivalent to “x is thought of,” which we have shown not to be the case,
the idealists’ belief that everything that exists is mental would not
thereby be justified. For “x is mental,” is not entailed by “x is
thought of,” any more than by “x is perceived.” Nor does this
proposition that everything that exists is mental appear capable of
being substantiated in any other way. For the fact that “x is real” does
not formally entail “x is mental” proves that it is not an a priori
truth. And while it is logically possible that all the things, such as
houses and pens and books, which we believe to be unconscious are really
conscious, it is highly improbable. For these things have never yet been
observed to behave in the way which is characteristic of conscious
beings. Chairs do not show any signs of purposive activity, nor do
clothes appear to be sensitive to pain. And, in general, there is no
empirical ground for supposing that what we ordinarily take to be
material things are all conscious beings in disguise.</p>
<p>There remains still to be considered one empirical question which is
a subject of controversy between realists and idealists. We have seen
that the realists are justified in maintaining that it is not
self-contradictory to assert that a thing exists unperceived; and we
must now consider whether they have the right to maintain also that
things do so exist in fact. Against them it has been argued that, even
if things do in fact continue to exist when no one is perceiving them,
we cannot have any good reason to suppose that they do.108 For it is
plainly impossible for anyone ever to observe a thing existing
unobserved. But this argument is plausible only so long as the notion of
unperceived existence is left unanalysed. As soon as we analyse it, we
find that there can be a good inductive ground for believing that a
thing exists unperceived. For what we are asserting when we say of a
thing that it exists although no one is perceiving it is, as we have
seen, that certain sense-contents would occur if certain conditions
relating mainly to the faculties and position of an observer were
fulfilled, but that in fact the conditions are not being fulfilled. And
these are propositions which we do frequently have good reason to
believe. For instance, the fact that I am now experiencing a series of
sense-contents which belong to a table, a chair, and other material
things, and that in similar circumstances I always have perceived these
material things, and also remarked that other human beings perceived
them, gives me a good inductive basis for the generalization that in
such circumstances these material things always are perceptible—a
hypothesis whose validity is independent of the fact that at a given
moment no one may actually be in a position to perceive them. Having now
left my room, I have good reason to believe that these things are not in
fact being perceived by anyone. For I observed that no one was there
when I left, and I have observed that no one has since entered by the
door or the window; and my past observations of the ways in which human
beings make their entry into rooms gives me the right to assert that no
one has entered the room in any other way. In addition, my past
observations of the way in which material things come to be destroyed
support my belief that if I were now in my room I should not be
perceiving any such process of destruction. And thus, having shown that
I may simultaneously have good reason to believe that no one is
perceiving certain material things in my room, and also that if anyone
were in my room he would be perceiving them, I have shown that it is
possible to have good inductive grounds for believing that a material
thing exists unperceived.</p>
<p>We have mentioned, also, that there may be good inductive grounds for
believing in the existence of things which have never at any time been
perceived. And this, too, can easily be shown with the help of an
example. Suppose that flowers have been observed to grow at a certain
altitude on all the mountains of a given range which have ever been
climbed; and suppose that there is one mountain in the range which
appears to be exactly like the others but happens never to have been
climbed; in such a case we may infer by analogy that if anyone were to
climb this mountain he would perceive flowers growing there also. And
this is to say that we are entitled to regard it as probable that
flowers do exist there, although they are never in fact perceived.</p>
<p>MONISM AND PLURALISM</p>
<p>Having dealt with the various aspects of the realist-idealist
controversy, we come finally to treat of the dispute between monists and
pluralists. We have, indeed, already remarked that the assertion that
Reality is One, which it is characteristic of a monist to make and a
pluralist to controvert, is nonsensical, since no empirical situation
could have any bearing on its truth. But this metaphysical assertion is
apt to be the outcome of certain logical errors which it is desirable to
examine. And this we shall now proceed to do.</p>
<p>The line of argument which most monists pursue is this: everything in
the world, they say, is related to everything else in some way or other;
a proposition which for them is a tautology since they regard otherness
as being a relation. And, further, they hold that every relation is
internal to its terms. A thing is what it is, they declare, because it
has the properties which it has. That is, all its properties, including
all its relational properties, are constitutive of its essential nature.
If it is deprived of any one of its properties, then, they say, it
ceases to be the same thing. And from these premises it is deduced that
to state any fact about a thing involves stating every fact about it,
and that this involves stating every fact about everything. And this is
tantamount to saying that any true proposition can be deduced from any
other, from which it follows that any two sentences which express true
propositions are equivalent. And this leads monists, who are given to
using the words “truth” and “reality” interchangeably, to make the
metaphysical assertion that Reality is One.</p>
<p>It should be added that it is admitted even by monists that the
sentences which people actually use to express propositions that they
believe to be true are not all equivalent to one another. But they
regard this fact, not as throwing any doubt on their conclusion that
every true proposition can be deduced from every other, but as showing
that none of the propositions which anyone ever believes are in fact
true. They say, indeed, that, while it is impossible for human beings
ever to express wholly true propositions, they can, and do, express
propositions which have a varying degree of truth. But what precisely
they mean by this, and how they reconcile it with their premises, I have
never yet been able to understand.</p>
<p>Clearly, the crucial step in the monist’s argument, which leads him
to such paradoxical conclusions, is the assumption that all the
properties of a thing, including all its relational properties, are
constitutive of its nature. And this assumption has only to be stated
clearly and unambiguously for its falsity to become apparent. In the
form in which we have stated it so far, which is the form in which it is
commonly stated, it is not, indeed, unambiguous. For to speak of the
nature of a thing may simply be a way of referring to the behaviour
which is characteristic of it— as in the sentence “It is in the nature
of a cat to catch mice.” But it may also, as we have seen, be a way of
referring to the definition of a thing—as in the sentence “It is in the
nature of an a priori proposition to be independent of experience.” So
that the words “all the properties of a thing are constitutive of its
nature” may legitimately be used to express either the proposition that
all the properties of a thing are relevant to its behaviour, or else the
proposition that all the properties of a thing are defining properties
of it. And it is not easy to tell from the writings of monists which of
these propositions they wish to maintain. Sometimes, indeed, they seem
to uphold both, without drawing a very clear distinction between them.
But it is plain that it must be the second that they employ in the
argument which we are now considering, whether they are aware of it or
not. For even if it were true, which it is not, that it was necessary to
take all the properties of a thing into account in order to predict its
behaviour, it would not follow that every fact about the thing was
logically deducible from every other. Whereas this conclusion does
follow from the proposition that all the properties of a thing belong to
it by definition. For, in that case, to assert that the thing exists at
all is implicitly to assert every fact about it. But we know that to
ascribe to a thing a property which belongs to it by definition is to
express an analytic proposition, a tautology. And thus the assumption
that all the properties of a thing are constitutive of its nature leads,
in this usage, to the absurd consequence that it is impossible, even in
principle, to express a synthetic fact about anything. And I regard this
as being sufficient to show that the assumption is false.</p>
<p>What makes this false assumption superficially plausible is the
ambiguity of such sentences as “If this thing had not got the properties
which it has, it would not be what it is.” To assert this may be to
assert merely that if a thing has a property, it cannot also lack
it—that if, for example, my newspaper is on the table in front of me, it
is not the case that it is not on the table. And this is an analytic
proposition whose validity no one would dispute. But to allow this is
not to allow that all the properties which a thing has are defining
properties. To say that if my newspaper were not on the table in front
of me it would not be what it is, is false if it is equivalent to saying
that it is necessary for my newspaper to be on the table in the sense in
which it is necessary for it to contain news. For whereas the
proposition that my newspaper contains news is analytic, the proposition
that it is on the table in front of me is synthetic. It is
self-contradictory to assert that my newspaper does not contain news,
but it is not self-contradictory to assert that my newspaper is not on
the table in front of me, although it happens to be false. And it is
only when “A has not p” is a self-contradictory proposition that p can
be said to be a defining, or internal, property of A.</p>
<p>In discussing this question, we have employed the factual terminology
in which it is commonly presented, but this has not prevented us from
recognising that it is linguistic in character. For we have seen that to
say that a property p is a defining property of a thing A is equivalent
to saying that the sentence which is formed out of the symbol “A” as
subject and the symbol “p” as predicate expresses an analytic
proposition.109 And it must be added that the use of factual terminology
is particularly inadvisable in this instance, because a predicate which
serves to express an analytic proposition when combined with one
descriptive phrase may serve to express a synthetic proposition when
combined with another descriptive phrase which nevertheless refers to
the same object. Thus to have written Hamlet is an internal property of
the author of Hamlet, but not of the author of Macbeth, nor yet of
Shakespeare. For it is self-contradictory to say that the author of
Hamlet did not write Hamlet, but it is not self-contradictory, although
it is false, to say that the author of Macbeth did not write Hamlet, or
that Shakespeare did not write Hamlet. If we use the current factual
terminology and say that it was logically necessary for the author of
Hamlet to have written Hamlet, but not for Shakespeare or the author of
Macbeth, or that Shakespeare and the author of Macbeth could conceivably
have existed without writing Hamlet but the author of Hamlet could not,
or that Shakespeare and the author of Macbeth would still have been
themselves if they had not written Hamlet but the author of Hamlet would
not, we should appear in each case to be contradicting ourselves; for we
allow that the author of Hamlet is the same person as Shakespeare and as
the author of Macbeth. But when it is recognised that these are simply
ways of saying that “the author of Hamlet wrote Hamlet” is an analytic
proposition, whereas “Shakespeare wrote Hamlet” and “the author of
Macbeth wrote Hamlet” are synthetic, the appearance of
self-contradiction is completely removed.</p>
<p>With this we conclude our examination of the logical errors which
give rise to the metaphysical doctrine of monism. But we must still
mention that it is characteristic of a monist to affirm, and of a
pluralist to deny, not only that every fact is logically contained in
every other, but also that every event is causally connected with every
other. There are some, indeed, who would say that the latter proposition
could be derived from the former, on the ground that causality was
itself a logical relation. But this would be a mistake. For if causality
were a logical relation, then the contradictory of every true
proposition which asserted a causal connection would be
self-contradictory. But it is allowed even by those who maintain that
causality is a logical relation that propositions which assert the
existence either of general or of particular causal connections are
synthetic. In Hume’s phraseology, they are propositions concerning
matters of fact. And we have shown that the validity of such
propositions cannot be established a priori, as Hume himself made clear.
“It implies no contradiction,” he says, “that the course of nature may
change, and that an object, seemingly like those which we have
experienced, may be attended with different or contrary effects. May I
not clearly and distinctly conceive, that a body, falling from the
clouds, and which in all other respects resembles snow, has yet the
taste of salt or feeling of fire? Is there any more intelligible
proposition than to affirm, that all the trees will flourish in December
and January, and decay in May and June? Now whatever is intelligible,
and can be distinctly conceived, implies no contradiction, and can never
be proved false by any demonstrative argument or abstract reasoning a
priori.”110 Here Hume is supporting our contention that it is only by
experience that the validity of synthetic propositions can be
determined. Propositions which cannot be denied without
self-contradiction are analytic. And it is to the class of synthetic
propositions that those which assert causal connection belong.</p>
<p>We may conclude from this that the monistic doctrine that every event
is causally connected with every other is logically independent of the
other monistic doctrine which we have examined—that every fact is
logically contained in every other. We have, indeed, no a priori ground
either for accepting or for rejecting the doctrine that every event is
causally connected with every other, but there are good empirical
grounds for rejecting it, inasmuch as it denies the possibility of
natural science. For it is plain that in making any given prediction we
are able to consider only a limited set of data; what we do not take
into account, we assume that we are entitled to ignore as irrelevant. I
assume, for example, that in order to determine whether it will rain
tomorrow I need not take into account the present state of mind of the
Emperor of Manchukuo. If we were not entitled to make such assumptions,
there would be no likelihood of our predictions ever being successful,
for we should always be ignoring the greater part of the relevant data.
The fact that our predictions are very often successful gives us reason
to believe that some at least of our judgements of irrelevance are
correct, and so to reject the monistic doctrine which denies their
legitimacy.</p>
<p>It is important for us to expose the errors which are commonly
associated with monism, because there is a sense in which we ourselves
desire to uphold the unity of science. For we maintain that it is a
mistake to conceive of the various “special sciences” as portraying
different “aspects of reality.” We have shown that all empirical
hypotheses refer ultimately to our sense-contents. They all function
alike as “rules for the anticipation of future experience”; and it is
very seldom the case that, in making a particular prediction, we are
guided by the hypotheses of only one science. What chiefly prevents this
unity from being recognized at present is the unnecessary multiplicity
of current scientific terminologies.111</p>
<p>For our part we are concerned to emphasize not so much the unity of
science as the unity of philosophy with science. With regard to the
relationship of philosophy and the empirical sciences, we have remarked
that philosophy does not in any way compete with the sciences. It does
not make any speculative assertions which could conflict with the
speculative assertions of science, nor does it profess to venture into
fields which lie beyond the scope of scientific investigation. Only the
metaphysician does that, and produces nonsense as a result. And we have
also pointed out that it is impossible merely by philosophizing to
determine the validity of a coherent system of scientific propositions.
For the question whether such a system is valid is always a question of
empirical fact; and, therefore, the propositions of philosophy, since
they are purely linguistic propositions, can have no bearing upon it.
Thus the philosopher is not, qua philosopher, in a position to assess
the value of any scientific theory; his function is simply to elucidate
the theory by defining the symbols which occur in it.</p>
<p>It might be thought that the philosophical elucidation of scientific
theories was required only for the popularization of science, and could
not be of much benefit to the scientists themselves. But this would be a
mistake. One has only to consider the importance to contemporary physics
of Einstein’s definition of simultaneity, in order to realise how
necessary it is for the experimental physicist to be furnished with
clear and definitive analyses of the concepts which he employs. And the
need for such analyses is even greater in the less advanced sciences.
For example, the failure of psychologists at the present time to
emancipate themselves from metaphysics, and to co-ordinate their
enquiries, is principally due to the use of symbols such as
“intelligence” or “empathy” or “subconscious self,” which are not
precisely defined. The theories of psycho-analysts are particularly full
of metaphysical elements which a philosophical elucidation of their
symbols would remove. It would be the philosopher’s business to make
clear what was the real empirical content of the propositions of
psycho-analysts, and what was their logical relationship to the
propositions of behaviourists or Gestalt psychologists, a relationship
at present obscured by unanalysed differences of terminology. And it can
hardly be disputed that such a work of clarification would be
favourable, if not essential, to the progress of the science as a
whole.</p>
<p>But if science may be said to be blind without philosophy, it is true
also that philosophy is virtually empty without science. For while the
analysis of our everyday language is useful as a means of preventing, or
exposing, a certain amount of metaphysics, the problems which it
presents are not of such difficulty or complexity as to make it probable
that they will remain long unsolved. Indeed we have dealt with most of
them in the course of this book, including the problem of perception,
which is perhaps the most difficult problem of those which are not
essentially connected with the language of science; a fact which
explains why it has played so large a part in the history of modern
philosophy. What confronts the philosopher who finds that our everyday
language has been sufficiently analysed is the task of clarifying the
concepts of contemporary science. But for him to be able to achieve
this, it is essential that he should understand science. If he is
incapable of understanding the propositions of any science, then he is
unable to fulfil the philosopher’s function in the advancement of our
knowledge. For he is unable to define the symbols which, most of all,
require to be made clear.</p>
<p>It is indeed misleading to draw a sharp distinction, as we have been
doing, between philosophy and science. What we should rather do is to
distinguish between the speculative and the logical aspects of science,
and assert that philosophy must develop into the logic of science. That
is to say, we distinguish between the activity of formulating
hypotheses, and the activity of displaying the logical relationship of
these hypotheses and defining the symbols which occur in them. It is of
no importance whether we call one who is engaged in the latter activity
a philosopher or a scientist. What we must recognise is that it is
necessary for a philosopher to become a scientist, in this sense, if he
is to make any substantial contribution towards the growth of human
knowledge.</p>
